  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">UNCOMMONLY sensitive to her owner's moods&mdash;for he had
  imputed personality to her&mdash;Dr. Paige's rakish blue coupé noted at a
  glance that this was one of those eventful mornings when she would be
  expected to steer her own course to Parkway Hospital.</p>

  <p>The signs of Dr. Paige's preoccupation were unmistakable. Sylvia, who
  usually plunged through the street door of the Hermitage Apartments wagging
  her tawny tail from a hinge located in the lumbar region, was following her
  broad-shouldered master with an air of gravity absurdly appropriate to the
  serious concern of his flexed jaw and faraway eyes. Pete, the garage-boy,
  instead of loitering to tell the young surgeon what kind of day it was, had
  ambled off without venturing the customary amenities valued at a quarter.</p>

  <p>Assured that her entire family was safely aboard, the coupé hummed a
  subdued monody on her twelve well-organized cylinders, and glided into
  action. Reckless of Sylvia's precarious dignity on the slippery rumble seat,
  she illegally swung herself around in the middle of the busy block, narrowly
  missing a ten-ton removal-van, and earning an impolite salutation from the
  burly driver of a gasoline tank. Dusting apprehensive fenders for a half-mile
  on Elm, she nonchalantly scraped the whole arc of the right kerb at the
  corner of Euclid, made pretence of colour-blindness at One Hundred and
  Eighty-Sixth, where she knew the cop, grazed a hub-cap at the narrow entrance
  gate, forced an empty ambulance into the dogwood bushes as she scudded round
  the big stone building, and demobilized a small convention of smoke-stealing
  orderlies in the parking-ground at the rear.</p>

  <p>Pleased with her undamaged arrival, she belatedly made a great show of
  professional poise, by rolling to a discreet stop on the crunching gravel
  between Dr. Armstrong's sand-coloured sedan and the five-year-old roadster of
  Dr. Lane, who at that moment was noisily tuning up for departure.</p>

  <p>Sighting the smart car sliding into the stall beside him, the grey-haired
  anæsthetist turned off his cyclone and nodded a greeting without
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Where to?" queried Paige. "We're doing that tuberculous kidney at
  nine."</p>

  <p>"Not till to-morrow," explained Lane discontentedly. "What's the
  trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;Endicott has been detained somehow. Just now 'phoned from
  Harrisburg or some place. Business conference or something. Back in the
  morning, or some time. I wish he had given orders for you to go ahead with
  it."</p>

  <p>Paige, still at the wheel, absently lifted an expressive hand, and with a
  single flick of the fingers acknowledged the compliment and dismissed the
  suggestion.</p>

  <p>"The lady is Dr. Endicott's patient, Lane. Came here especially to have
  him&mdash;and quite properly, too," he added meaningly, almost militantly,
  after a frosty pause.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" agreed Lane, too fervently to be convincing. "I said I wished
  you were doing this Dexter excision because I dislike these postponements.
  They're too hard on the patient's morale. Once you've got a case all nerved
  up for an operation, it's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The banal platitude perished of its own stupidity under the unfocused
  steel-blue stare. Paige wasn't hearing a word; just sitting there glowering
  at a distant ghost. What was eating him? Lane guessed&mdash;and thought he
  knew.</p>

  <p>Silently curious and more than a little perturbed, he watched the athletic
  young fellow's abstracted movements as he locked the gears, stepped out of
  his car, chained the whimpering setter to the steering-wheel, and
  mechanically moved away without another word or a backward glance. It wasn't
  like Newell Paige to do that.</p>

  <p>With narrowed eyes he broodingly followed the tall figure towards the rear
  entrance, a bit hurt but not offended. He liked young Paige, often wondering
  why; for, as a passionate social radical, Lane was naturally contemptuous of
  the well-to-do.</p>

  <p>He chuckled a little. Dr. Benjamin Montgomery Booth&mdash;specialist in
  radium, with a degree from Edinburgh, one of Paige's most intimate
  friends&mdash;had just been curtly disposed of with the briefest of nods as
  they encountered each other in the doorway. Bennie Booth's open-mouthed
  expression of bewilderment was amusing. Paige was playing no favourites; he
  evidently had something important on his mind.</p>

  <p>Lane's grin changed to a reflective scowl. Drawing a tiny red book from
  his ticket-pocket, he moistened his thumb and extracted a thin leaf; brought
  up a small hard package of cheap tobacco, opened it, tilted it, peppered the
  leaf expertly, tugged the package shut with two fingers and his teeth, rolled
  a cigarette, ran his tongue along the margin, struck a match, inhaled deeply,
  all the while reminiscently spinning the reel of Paige's singular
  relationship to the celebrated Endicott.</p>

  <p>It was a dramatic story, the first spectacular episode of which had been
  witnessed by a very small audience. Lane, himself, knew it only from hearsay,
  for he had been a mere stripling at the tail of a muddy ambulance in France
  when Jim Paige died, here at Parkway, of a swift pneumonia, following the
  malignant flu that had mown a broad swath through the hospitals after the
  manner of a medieval pestilence.</p>

  <p>His old friend Sandy McIntyre, long since a lung specialist in Phoenix,
  had once recited that initial chapter for Lane in a dusty day-coach on the
  Santa Fe inexpensively <i>en route</i> from Chicago to the Coast.</p>

  <p>"I understand Jim's boy is working now at Parkway," McIntyre had remarked
  in the course of their shop-talk. "Does he still take such good care of his
  hands?"</p>

  <p>"Hadn't noticed," Lane remembered having replied. "Why?"</p>

  <p>McIntyre had grinned broadly.</p>

  <p>"They used to say that when the kid was thirteen or so he would sit on the
  fence and watch the rest of 'em play ball. Willing to play tennis, sail a
  boat, ride a horse, dive from high places, and almost anything else requiring
  speed, skill, and courage, but he wouldn't play baseball for fear of damaging
  his fingers. Said he was going to be a surgeon. Took up the violin, not
  because he wanted to be a musician, but to improve the dexterity of his left
  hand. They tell me that chap could walk right on to a stage and play the
  fiddle along with the best of 'em if he wanted to. Newell's a chip off the
  old block. You should have known Jim."</p>

  <p>Sandy had followed with a dreamily reflective monologue. He had been Jim's
  classmate through their medical training. Knew all about him. He had also
  known the incomparable Sally Newell.</p>

  <p>"As a student," McIntyre had recounted meditatively, "I used to think that
  Jim was the luckiest chap of my acquaintance. Boy!&mdash;he had everything!
  Plenty of money, and mighty generous with it, too. Handsome as a Greek god.
  Brilliant student. Born surgeon, if there ever was one. Not quite so
  audacious as Endicott, who was seven years his senior and already making a
  name for himself, but in a fair way to be as competent when he had had the
  experience.</p>

  <p>"Never knew anybody as serious as he was about his profession," McIntyre
  had rumbled on, half to himself. "They ragged him about it a good deal when
  we were in school. You remember, Lane, the sort of fooling that goes on among
  cocky young medicals, as if the whole business was full of hanky-panky. Can't
  blame 'em much; just sensitive, scared youngsters, trying to build up some
  kind of defence-apparatus against the screams and shocking sights and
  stupefying stinks of a big hospital. But Jim hated their kidding about
  it.</p>

  <p>"I recall one cruelly hot afternoon when Brute Spangler&mdash;best
  diagnostician we ever had, but hard-boiled as the handles o' hell&mdash;was
  leading a flock of us through the open ward of the women's surgical, he
  growled at Jim, out of the corner of his mouth, 'Cheer up, Father Paige.
  We're not doing the stations of the cross.' Jim's heavy black brows drew
  together into one straight line, and looking down into Spangler's beady
  little eyes, he said, without a smile, 'No&mdash;we're not, unfortunately.
  Perhaps that's what ails us!'</p>

  <p>"And then&mdash;there was Sally Newell&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There had been a long pause at this point in McIntyre's memories. They had
  made a tedious job of reloading their pipes to account for the delay.</p>

  <p>"Paige's wife?" Lane had queried at length, knowing the answer.</p>

  <p>"It was an ideal match," declared McIntyre. "Most beautiful girl I ever
  saw. You may be sure it hadn't required old Oliver Newell's money to make her
  the exact centre of interest wherever she went."</p>

  <p>Lane, who had taken more than a merely inquisitive interest in
  psychoanalysis, would have liked to ask a few pertinent questions at this
  point, but had hesitated, knowing that the lean Scot with the prominent pink
  cheek-bones would have closed up like a clam. McIntyre didn't need anybody to
  inform him&mdash;even by tactful indirection&mdash;that the heart is located
  close to the lungs. There was another long wait while McIntyre fondled the
  things he had laid away in lavender.</p>

  <p>"Nothing in my professional experience," he continued moodily, "ever
  stirred me more deeply than the wan and weary little face of their boy on the
  afternoon of Jim's death. Sally had gone out the same way two days before.
  God&mdash;how helpless we were!</p>

  <p>"Naturally, we couldn't let the child into his father's room, for the
  stuff was deadly. His grandmother, Mrs. Newell, waited in the sun-parlour at
  the end of the hall. The elder Paiges were still on their way in from
  California. This boy haunted the corridor for hours, his dry, bloodshot eyes
  fastened on the door. Every time anyone came out, there he was, eager for
  news and wanting to come in. I'm afraid we weren't very attentive to his
  questions or his grief. We had all been too worn down to be considerate.</p>

  <p>"That was the only time I ever saw Bruce Endicott stampeded. I always
  maintained he was the greatest surgeon I ever knew, and I don't expect to
  have any occasion to change my mind about that. Never met anybody with such
  complete mastery over a situation.... Well&mdash;I drew the sheet up over
  Jim's cracked lips and swollen cheeks, and followed Endicott out into the
  hall. There was this boy&mdash;Newell. I told the nurse to go and tell Jim's
  mother-in-law. Endicott took the lad by the hand and we went back to the
  library. It was unoccupied. Nobody was patronizing the library much during
  that frantic period.</p>

  <p>"'Well, sonny,' began Endicott, closing the door, 'we did everything we
  knew.'</p>

  <p>"The boy swallowed hard, a couple of times, and asked, 'Is my
  daddy&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' growled Endicott, as if he were reporting some monstrous
  injustice, 'he is; but&mdash;' he repeated lamely, 'we did everything we
  knew.'</p>

  <p>"I fully expected to see the gallant little fellow cave in, for he was
  nervously exhausted from worry and loss of sleep. But he had a lot of strong
  stuff packed away that we didn't know about. He stood there tense, his fists
  clenched until his thin knuckles showed white, his babyish mouth twisted into
  a hard knot, looking as if he had just been struck a blow in the face. And
  then, to our amazement, he piped out in a shrill treble, 'Now I'll have to be
  a doctor!'</p>

  <p>"Endicott took a turn or two, up and down the room, muttering, 'Doctor!...
  My God!... He wants to be a doctor!' Then he stood for a long time at the
  window, looking out. After a while, he came back, reached out his hand to the
  boy as he might have done had they been contemporaries, and controlling a
  shaky voice, he said, 'Very good, sir. And if I may be of any service to you,
  I am yours to command.'"</p>

  <p>In white duck, Newell Paige emerged from the dressing-room on the top
  floor, where he found Francis Ogilvie. It was not a surprise. He was always
  meeting her.</p>

  <p>By agreement, arrived at many months earlier, they waived the conventional
  greetings and restricted their talk to necessary business.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Endicott is not to be here to-day," she said crisply.</p>

  <p>"I know," Paige replied. "I met Dr. Lane outside. Has Mrs. Dexter been
  told of the postponement? We were to have had her first."</p>

  <p>Miss Ogilvie's cryptic smile was unpleasant.</p>

  <p>"I believe not," she said. "The others have been notified, but"&mdash;the
  carefully pencilled brows arched slightly&mdash;"I thought you might wish to
  talk to Mrs. Dexter yourself." There was an inquiring pause which Dr. Paige
  might make use of, if he desired, for purpose of explanations, denials, or
  just plain stammering, but he allowed the opportunity to pass. "I understand
  Mrs. Dexter has become very fond of you," finished Miss Ogilvie.</p>

  <p>"Thanks." Paige pushed the button for the elevator.</p>

  <p>A bit of a problem&mdash;this competent, bronze-haired, physically
  opulent, chief surgical nurse. Once a warm comradeship between them had been
  in the making, but they had spoiled it for each other beyond any hope of
  mending.</p>

  <p>One stormy afternoon in March, quite exasperated over Paige's wilful
  inattentiveness to her rather obvious and slightly disconcerting overtures,
  she had impetuously tossed herself at him, with awkward results. He had been
  sitting alone in the laboratory for a half-hour, studying an X-ray thoracic
  which wasn't any too generous with its disclosures. For some minutes she had
  stood at his elbow looking over his shoulder, before he became aware that she
  had no errand in the room. Her arm touched his lightly.</p>

  <p>"Hello," he drawled, preoccupied. "What's the good news with you, Miss
  Ogilvie?"</p>

  <p>She did not respond to the casual inanity as he had expected, and a
  meaningful silence had ensued, of such duration that he had put the plate
  down on the table and turned his head in her direction, looking squarely and
  at very close range into a pair of questing blue-green eyes. Had the cloudy
  pleura been as easy to read, Paige need not have been detained in the
  laboratory for another moment. The girl's full lips were parted, and there
  was an entreating little smile on her face, so near to his that the freckles,
  left over from last summer, were clearly defined on her white cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I'm lonesome as the devil&mdash;if you really want to know," she
  confided, in a low tone of intimacy, adding presently, "and my name is
  Frances&mdash;I hate 'Miss Ogilvie.'"</p>

  <p>Paige hooked the rung of a neighbouring stool with his toe and dragged it
  nearer. "Sit down, won't you?"</p>

  <p>She complied with some reluctance, her half-impatient gesture and audible
  sigh implying a wish that she were well out of this unhappy situation.</p>

  <p>"I like that name," said Paige companionably. "If the hospital regulations
  encouraged us to have Christian names, it would be easy to call you by
  yours."</p>

  <p>Her face brightened a little and she murmured, "I could say yours, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"For it fits you&mdash;exactly," continued Paige hastily. "I don't know
  very many people who have as good a right to it&mdash;Saint Francis, you
  know," he explained, when it had become apparent she was not following
  him.</p>

  <p>The shapely lips were a little derisive as she replied, "Rubbish! I have
  no ambition to be a saint. I'm all fed up with everything; silly rules,
  stuffy discipline, pompous doctors, jealous nurses, and earnest social
  welfarers.... Tell me something, won't you? Why do you dislike me so? I've
  got to know!"</p>

  <p>"But I don't!" protested Paige sincerely. "Quite to the contrary. I never
  knew an operating nurse with a more authentic talent for surgery. If I
  haven't told you so, it's only because I don't bubble over."</p>

  <p>"Just once&mdash;you did," she muttered, with averted eyes. "Remember the
  day we did the little Morton boy's osteo sarcoma?"</p>

  <p>Paige winced at the recollection. "My word!&mdash;that was a tough
  experience."</p>

  <p>"I kept up with you pretty well, you seemed to think, with the forceps and
  ties. And when it was done, you said&mdash;oh, no matter. You've probably
  forgotten."</p>

  <p>"I hope it was something pleasant."</p>

  <p>"It sounds awfully silly, but it meant a great deal to me. You looked me
  straight in the face, for the first and last time, and said, 'You're a good
  egg!' I had never thought much about being an egg before." They both laughed,
  nervously, and Paige, vastly in need of a little occupational therapy,
  sharpened a pencil.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said reminiscently, "that was the worst one I ever saw. The
  little fellow didn't have one chance in a thousand, did he?"</p>

  <p>She sighed, rose, and moved slowly toward the door, hesitating there for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would be better all around if I left Parkway, Dr. Paige," she
  hazarded.</p>

  <p>"I don't see the necessity of that." He had risen and stood facing her.
  "You are needed here," he continued, in a tone of challenge. "My God, woman,
  aren't you big enough to understand that our profession is more important
  than our personal desires, and gets the right of way over
  everything&mdash;<i>over everything, I tell you!</i> Stay&mdash;and play the
  game!"</p>

  <p>She studied the floor, tugging at her lip with agitated fingers.</p>

  <p>"You saw my cards," she said morosely. "It isn't fair."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" scoffed Paige. "I wasn't looking. I don't even know what suit
  was trump.... Look here&mdash;you've been working too hard, and the whole
  business has got on your nerves. I'll tell Dr. Endicott you need a week in
  the country."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," she said listlessly. "There's no need of that. And&mdash;I'll
  stay&mdash;if you're sure you want me to."</p>

  <p>Paige smiled his satisfaction. "You're a credit to the hospital," he
  declared warmly. "It's the proper spirit. I knew you had it."</p>

  <p>"And may I still be&mdash;an egg?" she queried, with a brave attempt to be
  playful.</p>

  <p>"An uncommonly good one!" He offered her his hand.</p>

  <p>When she got to her room that night, Frances Ogilvie found three dozen
  long-stemmed American Beauty roses bearing Paige's card. It was a mistake, as
  he discovered next day. If, he reflected afterward, he had wanted to send her
  some token of his regard for her excellent sportsmanship in a trying
  position, he should have given her a new clinical thermometer in a gold case,
  or <i>The Life of Osier,</i> or a dated, candled, de luxe egg. Miss Ogilvie
  was, as Paige had conceded, an exceptionally able operating nurse,
  but&mdash;long before that&mdash;she was a woman. She would make a courageous
  effort to play the game, but she couldn't abandon her belief that hearts were
  trumps. So the roses, which had been intended to symbolize their friendship
  on a safer footing, had not cleared the air at all. Newell Paige came to
  dread the necessity for working in the laboratory, where he was almost sure
  to be brought to bay. Keenly interested in bacteriology, he had enjoyed
  nothing better than microscopical research, but no sooner would he be lost in
  his scientific problem than Frances would saunter in to bend over his
  shoulder, ruthlessly reckless as she pressed closely against him. He was for
  ever bumping into her in the corridors. She was at his heels until the whole
  place buzzed merrily. At length he had been obliged to be almost surly with
  her, to shut off the insufferable smiles and winks.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she agreed tartly. "Strictly business, then, from now on. You
  wouldn't know how to be kind, anyhow&mdash;except possibly to your dog."</p>

  <p>Confused and defenceless, Paige had replied, absurdly, "Well&mdash;Sylvia
  <i>is</i> a good dog."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lawrence Dexter's day nurse, Bunny Mather, obediently but
  unrewardedly studied Dr. Paige's face as he entered the room.</p>

  <p>Bunny had been given a difficult assignment. It had been suggested to her
  that she should try to discover the nature of Dr. Paige's peculiar interest
  in her wealthy and prominent patient. She had so much wanted to please Miss
  Ogilvie, whom she admired to the extent of attempted imitation. Miss
  Ogilvie's fleeting smile, executed with half-closed eyes and a whimsical
  little pout, had cost Bunny several long sessions of private smirkings before
  her diminutive mirror in the nurses' home.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately there had been almost nothing to report so far. Dr. Paige
  had been visiting Mrs. Dexter at least twice daily ever since her arrival for
  observation two weeks ago. She was not his patient. Dr. Endicott had brought
  him in, that first day, to present him.</p>

  <p>"I want you to become acquainted with my associate, Dr. Newell Paige, Mrs.
  Dexter," he had said breezily. "You two should know each other. It is no
  secret, Mrs. Dexter," he had added, "that Dr. Paige is in the running to be
  the chief of staff here when the old fellow retires to the Lido or Waikiki
  Beach."</p>

  <p>The acquaintance ripened quickly into an unusual comradeship. Sometimes
  Dr. Paige stayed with Mrs. Dexter for an hour or more. As her disability was
  neither painful nor fatiguing, there was no reason why she should not receive
  callers if she desired. No one of her family was in town. Her husband, an
  investment broker in a huge Mid-Western city, would come if an operation were
  decided on. A daughter, Grace, at home with her father, would accompany him.
  There was another daughter, Phyllis, in Europe for the summer with a party of
  Vassar classmates. The trip was Phyllis's Commencement gift.</p>

  <p>So little had Bunny learned about her interesting patient who, contrary to
  custom, had been disinclined to discuss her private affairs with her nurse.
  As for the sudden friendship which had developed between her and the young
  surgeon, Bunny was regretfully unable to enlighten Miss Ogilvie. No&mdash;she
  hadn't the faintest idea what they talked about, for she was always promptly
  excused from attendance while these conversations were in progress.</p>

  <p>"I mean," she had explained, under heavy pressure, "they never have said
  anything while I was in the room&mdash;not anything that really meant
  anything, if you know what I mean. They have both travelled; maybe they talk
  about that. Once I heard her saying something about a ship."</p>

  <p>"One they had sailed on?" pursued Miss Ogilvie, alert. "Perhaps they knew
  each other before. Maybe she came here for that reason."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. She quoted something that a dean had said to her about
  a ship."</p>

  <p>"Dean of a college?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. She was talking in a very low tone. I couldn't hear very
  well."</p>

  <p>"Did Dr. Paige make any reply?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;he said he didn't believe it."</p>

  <p>"And then they laughed, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't just a little joke, then?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;they were pretty serious."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;how do they look at each other?" Miss Ogilvie had persisted,
  after a thoughtful interval. "You know what I mean&mdash;as if they had
  something between them?"</p>

  <p>"M-maybe," Bunny had ventured uncertainly. "I'll try to notice from now
  on, Miss Ogilvie&mdash;honest I will&mdash;but"&mdash;she added,
  truthfully&mdash;"I don't think I'm going to be very good at it."</p>

  <p>"Was she nettled," inquired Miss Ogilvie, unwilling to leave a stone
  unturned, "when Dr. Paige said he didn't believe whatever it was about the
  ship?"</p>

  <p>"No," Bunny had replied. She patted Dr. Paige's hand, and said, "I hope it
  doesn't cost you too much."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;in God's name&mdash;what on earth does that mean, Mather?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know, Miss Ogilvie. You asked me what I heard them say,
  and I've tried to tell you."</p>

  <p>Anyone should have known at a glance that Bunny Mather was not fitted, by
  nature, for sleuthing. Life had not been very complicated for Bunny. She had
  no talent for dramatizing the small episodes which sporadically punctuated
  her routine. An inordinate appetite for candy, cream, and other fattening
  refreshments had earned her the cherubic rolypolyness of a Delia Robbia
  medallion. She was not built for the sinister task of crouching at keyholes.
  Her wide-open, slightly protuberant, birds-egg-blue eyes lent to her round
  face an expression of ineffable guilelessness. This ocular phenomenon was due
  to an incipient exophthalmic goitre, but the fact remained that Bunny was
  almost, if not quite, as naïve and artless as she looked.</p>

  <p>To-day she was resolved to stay in the room with them until definitely and
  firmly invited to leave. No mere hint or inquiring glance in her direction
  would be sufficient to dislodge her. She had just learned that Mrs. Dexter's
  operation had been put off until to-morrow. After that, there might be a week
  or more when conversation would be impossible.</p>

  <p>One thing seemed sure: it was not a flirtation. Mrs. Dexter was nearly old
  enough to have been Dr. Paige's mother. And she certainly wasn't the sort to
  initiate or encourage a gusty little romance for the sake of passing the
  time.</p>

  <p>Dr. Paige always had the manner of a person coming in for advice on some
  important problem. He was very serious. He never entered with the capable
  condescension of the physician making his rounds, carolling, "And how do we
  find ourselves this morning?" Bunny had thought of saying to Miss Ogilvie
  that Dr. Paige acted as if he were going to school to Mrs. Dexter, but had
  decided against that because it sounded too silly. She didn't care to risk
  hearing Miss Ogilvie say, as she had once said to her in reply to a remark,
  "Don't be an ass, Mather!"</p>

  <p>Bunny busied her fat fingers rearranging the books and bottles on the
  table, glancing up frequently to note Dr. Paige's expression and movements.
  He stood for some moments at the foot of the bed, toying with his platinum
  watch-chain. Then he slowly nodded his head, and smiled; not a greeting, but
  an affirmative.</p>

  <p>Quickly shifting her search to Mrs. Dexter's face, Bunny tried to
  interpret it, but realized that she had arrived the fraction of a second too
  late. Mrs. Dexter's sensitive lips were parted as if she had just asked an
  inarticulate question with them&mdash;some single-word query that might have
  been expressed with the lips only. If so&mdash;they had a very good
  understanding between them, these two.</p>

  <p>And that would be natural, reflected Bunny, for they were very much alike.
  They were thoroughbreds. You could always tell. People didn't get to be like
  that by personal effort or education. If you had it, it was because you were
  born with it, and nobody could take it from you. You had it whether you were
  rich or poor, sick or well, happy or wretched. All the money in the world
  couldn't buy even a cheap imitation of it. Bunny knew very well she didn't
  have it. She knew Miss Ogilvie didn't have it.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Dexter had the eyes of a thoroughbred; steady greyish-blue eyes that
  never widened suddenly in surprise or alarm or curiosity; serene eyes that
  never gave her thoughts away. There was one little snow-white curl slightly
  to the left of the parting on the low forehead, definitely outlined from the
  environing burnished gold. The white lock was not a disfigurement but a
  distinction. One suspected that in Mrs. Dexter's youth her Titian hair had
  been of a brighter yellow. There were deep dimples in her cheeks. Her hands
  were long and slender, and she could say things with them. Dr. Paige had the
  same slow-moving eyes and the same speaking hands. He had taken one of Mrs.
  Dexter's expressive hands in both of his and had seated himself at her
  bedside. These people were somehow related, Bunny felt.</p>

  <p>He said something to her in an undertone, and she replied, with a smile,
  "What does it matter?&mdash;to-day, to-morrow, the day after. Don't be
  troubled about this little delay. I shall not be fretting. No, no&mdash;it
  isn't a pose, I assure you. I am quite in earnest. It doesn't matter in the
  least and I'm content."</p>

  <p>"You are a very fortunate woman," responded Dr. Paige. "Last night I was
  thinking over some of the things you had said, and it occurred to me that if
  somehow it could be reduced to simple terms and communicated, it would
  practically revolutionize the whole problem of human happiness. But I doubt
  whether it could ever be made elementary enough for the ordinary intellect. I
  admit it's too much for mine. I think I get spasmodic little tugs of
  it&mdash;and then it is gone. One would have to be something of a mystic, I
  presume."</p>

  <p>"No." Mrs. Dexter's negative was accompanied by a slow shake of her head
  on the pillow. "No&mdash;it isn't a matter of mental capacity or even of
  temperament. The trouble is that the average individual leaves most of his
  tasks unfinished, his mental tasks in particular. The world is fairly crowded
  with truncated minds belonging to people who learned the scales up to three
  flats and two sharps. If the tune they are interested in happens to be
  written in any higher signature, they have either to transpose it into one of
  the keys they have learned or give it up. Most people try to get along with a
  vocabulary of about six hundred words. This enables them to understand what
  is going on in the kitchen, the shop, and on the street. Any idea that can't
  be translated into kitchen-lore or shop-lore or street-lore is
  dismissed."</p>

  <p>"Did Dean Harcourt ever try to put this into print?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;nor has he more than hinted at it in public addresses. He does
  it all by the case-method. People in trouble come to him and he tells them.
  It's really amazing what happens to them. Why&mdash;I've known
  instances&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You may run along now and have a bit of relaxation, Miss Mather," Mrs.
  Dexter interrupted herself to say, without detaching her eyes from Dr.
  Paige's face.</p>

  <p>Bunny still lingered, tinkering with the magazines and vases, consumed
  with curiosity to hear what was coming next.</p>

  <p>"That will be all for the present," said Dr. Paige, with finality. "We
  will ring when you are needed."</p>

  <p>Bunny slowly and reluctantly walked to the door, opened it, and softly
  closed it behind her.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BY admonition and example Dr. Bruce Endicott&mdash;elsewhere
  genial and talkative&mdash;had discouraged all unnecessary conversation in
  his operating-theatres at Parkway Hospital. The sentiment he had built up
  against superfluous chatter on the part of his associates and assistants was
  not restricted to the period when surgery was actually in process. He did not
  like to be distracted even during the preparatory business of scrubbing-up.
  Nothing annoyed him more than some cold-bloodedly irrelevant remark, when an
  operation was impending, "as if one were making ready to bake a pie or patch
  a boot." Daily experience of working together in silence had so harmoniously
  integrated this particular group of five, that their respective rôles in the
  drama were adroitly enacted without need of prompting or conference.</p>

  <p>On this eventful Wednesday the pantomime had been in progress for fifteen
  minutes, unattended by any noise but the padding of competent rubber-shod
  feet on the tiled floor, the muffled plunk of the sterilizing machines as
  they grudgingly disgorged their immaculate contents through belching billows
  of steam, the intermittent swirl and swish of water rushing into capacious
  porcelain basins, and the patter and rattle and clink and clank of variously
  sized, curiously shaped instruments, hot, clean, gleaming.</p>

  <p>Gingerly and at arms' length Miss Ogilvie held up the surgical coat, and
  Dr. Paige stretched out his dripping arms toward it, instinctively aware that
  her eyes were inviting him as they always were in this thrice-a-day
  experience of a face-to-face contact which lacked only a little of an
  embrace. The Tweedy girl stood behind him, gowned and masked, waiting to tie
  the tapes down his back. Dr. Endicott was still vigorously polishing his
  nails. In a moment he, too, would be offering himself to Ogilvie for the same
  ministrations his associate had just received. By custom everybody was made
  ready before Endicott.</p>

  <p>The anxious face of Lucy Reid, the chief's secretary, appeared in the
  crack of the corridor door. Miss Ogilvie glanced over her shoulder, visibly
  annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Could Dr. Endicott answer the telephone?" inquired the girl nervously,
  aware that she was taking an unforgivable liberty.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" snapped Miss Ogilvie, through her gauze. "You ought to
  know that much."</p>

  <p>"I told them," explained Miss Reid defensively, "but they insisted it was
  very urgent, and said that Dr. Endicott would be at a serious disadvantage if
  the message was not delivered at once."</p>

  <p>"Who was it?" boomed Endicott, without looking up.</p>

  <p>"Riley, Brooks, and Bannister, Doctor. Shall I say you will call them up
  later?"</p>

  <p>He released the faucet-pedal and stood for an instant, head tilted to one
  side, as if listening for a decision.</p>

  <p>"They said it was of immediate importance?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Very well, I'll go.... Sorry, Dr. Paige. I shall not be long."</p>

  <p>Abstractedly stroking the fingers of his gloves, Paige walked through the
  alcove, passed the operating-table, and entered the adjacent chamber. Mrs.
  Dexter, with the customary modicum of morphine to reduce her active interest
  in the occasion, spread out her hand apathetically and signed that she was
  too drowsy to offer it, to which he wordlessly replied, by holding up his
  own, that he would be unable to touch her, anyway.</p>

  <p>Grace Dexter, whom he had met briefly an hour earlier, stood in the
  doorway at a discreet distance, a bit pale, but entirely self-possessed. Her
  patrician face had the general contour of her mother's. Had the black hair
  been straight she could have done an acceptable madonna. Her figure was
  slight but shapely, as the severely tailored suit, unrelieved by any touch of
  colour, testified. The brooding grey eyes hinted at a well-developed talent
  for introspection, an effect augmented by the slightly drooping, sensitive
  lips. Slim, meditative fingers caressed a silver crucifix depending from a
  heavy chain about her white throat. Dr. Paige smiled, and she answered the
  recognition.</p>

  <p>"Did your father come up?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and just now went down again. To the telephone, I think. He
  will be back in a moment. Mother seems quite fit, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"Never better!" said Paige confidently. Then, leaning over Mrs. Dexter, he
  whispered something in her ear which she approved with a contented sigh and
  several reassuring little nods. She closed her eyes, and the slightly smiling
  lips relaxed.</p>

  <p>"Do I know what that was about?" queried Grace, in the tone of one asking
  for a password. Paige nodded and retraced his steps into the operating-room,
  and through the alcove where the white-swathed little company waited.</p>

  <p>Presently the door opened and the chief appeared, quite plainly upset
  about something. Paige watched him anxiously as he resumed his washing with
  nervous haste. His face was flushed and the muscles of his cheeks twitched.
  The silence was taut. Endicott seemed to sense it with defenceless
  irritation. Everybody in the room knew that he had been engaged in an
  emergency conversation with his brokers, and he knew that they all knew. They
  knew that he knew they knew. He plunged his arms into the surgical coat with
  such force that he tore it out of Ogilvie's grip and it fell to the floor.
  Tweedy came promptly with another. His exasperation was all but out of
  control. At length, in spite of his haste, he was ready. They filed into the
  operating-room and gathered about the table.</p>

  <p>Lane's thin fingers trembled a little as he readjusted the mask more
  effectively over Mrs. Dexter's face. Endicott noticed it and frowned. He
  stared glassily straight ahead through the high, bright windows while they
  waited for the increasingly laboured respiration to signal the moment for
  action. One more shuddering inhalation would do it. Lane slowly looked up,
  pursed his lips slightly, and nodded.</p>

  <p>A hand-made Swiss watch could have had no better understanding of itself
  than this close-knit company of five. Endicott signed his commands to Paige
  and Ogilvie, Ogilvie signed to the Tweedy and Larimer girls&mdash;all the
  orders given with dexterous gestures. Endicott was working faster than
  usual.</p>

  <p>The hands of the surgeons opened and whatever they required was instantly
  thrust into them; the others hovering close, alert, lynx-eyed.... A scalpel
  for Endicott, the swift use of a sponge thrust into Paige's fingers by
  Tweedy, a pair of forceps for Paige, the deft swipe of a sponge by Larimer,
  more forceps for Paige furnished by Ogilvie, fresh sponges for Tweedy
  furnished by Larimer, more forceps for Paige; clip, clip, clip, forceps,
  forceps, forceps for Paige, more gauze for Tweedy, a clamp for Paige,
  long-handled scissors for Endicott&mdash;a tense pause, quiet and stiff as a
  tableau. Larimer stood ready with the threaded ligator. Ogilvie offered the
  handles of a secondary clamp. Endicott shook his head. That meant he couldn't
  use it because there was no room to apply it. There was a quick, barely
  audible sucking intake of breath by Ogilvie. Endicott frowned.</p>

  <p>"I'll hold your clamp, Dr. Paige," he muttered huskily. "You make the tie,
  please."</p>

  <p>Paige realized that the pedicle had been cut too short for safe ligation.
  He adjusted the ligature with difficulty and drew it as tightly as possible.
  Endicott slowly and with apparent reluctance relaxed the clamp and withdrew
  it. They waited. The chief breathed as if he had recently been running
  uphill. He had made two grave mistakes. In his nervous excitement he had
  neglected to dissect the pedicle&mdash;sheath of the renal artery&mdash;with
  sufficient care, and had severed it too short for a secure tie.... The
  pedicle slowly rejected the ligature.</p>

  <p>"<i>My fault!"</i> gasped Paige, as the flood broke. "I should have drawn
  it tighter. <i>My God!"</i></p>

  <p>The hæmorrhage was instantly out of control. Sponges would have been
  equally serviceable at a crumbled dam. The increasing tempo of the splash of
  big drops falling from the table to the floor quickened to a brisk patter and
  accelerated to a steady stream.</p>

  <p>The chief seemed suddenly to go to pieces&mdash;a shocking sight to those
  who had never seen him panic-driven. He panted for breath and his hands
  shook. Ogilvie thrust a huge bunch of gauze into the pouring wound. He
  shouted to her to remove it, and frantically groped in the depths of the
  geyser with his clamp, hoping to recapture the spouting pedicle by mere blind
  chance.</p>

  <p>"A donor&mdash;immediately!" he commanded hoarsely. "Here, Paige," handing
  him the clamp, "see what you can do." The frenzied grappling continued.</p>

  <p>"How's she holding up, Lane?" mumbled Endicott, half incoherently.</p>

  <p>Lane shook his head and closed the valves. Miss Tweedy collapsed on the
  slippery floor in a dead faint. Larimer dragged her out of the way. Ogilvie
  sponged the sweat from Paige's white face. The hæmorrhage was subsiding now.
  It had almost stopped. There was no further energy driving it.</p>

  <p>Endicott and Paige washed at adjoining basins without the exchange of a
  word or a look. The chief was still breathing with an asthmatic wheeze. Paige
  was so shaken that his tears ran unrestrained.</p>

  <p>Two orderlies were mopping the floor. The body had been wheeled into a
  room across the hall. Tweedy, quite nauseated, slumped over a basin in the
  corner, supported by Larimer, who was swallowing hard and apparently on the
  verge of crumpling.</p>

  <p>Paige made a quick task of his ablutions, dashed to the dressing-room, and
  changed to his street clothes. Nothing seemed to matter now but a prompt
  escape from this place at top speed. His hands shook so violently that he
  could hardly manage his buttons.</p>

  <p>Frances Ogilvie was waiting for him when he came out into the corridor. He
  pretended not to notice her, and moved quickly to the elevator. She followed,
  clutching at his sleeve. "Wait!" she cried. "I know exactly what happened and
  I'm going to tell everybody the truth."</p>

  <p>"You're going to mind your own business," retorted Paige, measuring his
  words, sternly. "It was my fault and I've admitted it. And that settles it.
  You are to stay out of it, and keep your mouth shut."</p>

  <p>The sluggish elevator was in use, its remote rumble threatening a long
  delay. Unable to bear any more of the tempest that had reduced the Ogilvie
  girl to a tear-smeared sputter of protestations, Paige suddenly pushed her
  out of his path and started for the stairway. She pursued him, sobbing aloud.
  He lost her somewhere between the third and second floors, and ran on. The
  last he heard of her was an hysterical scream, "You'll be sorry!"</p>

  <p>In the main hall, the superintendent, Watts, called to him, but he did not
  stop. At the front door he ran into Ted Rayburn, the house physician. He had
  been closer to Rayburn, for a couple of years, than to any of the others,
  with the possible exception of Bennie Booth.</p>

  <p>"Where are you bolting to?" demanded Rayburn, holding out both arms,
  semaphore fashion. "What's happened? You're white!"</p>

  <p>"They'll tell you&mdash;in there," Paige replied, over his shoulder,
  hurrying on.</p>

  <p>Walking swiftly to the gate, he hailed a cruising taxi and ordered the
  driver to take him home. He did not reply when the elevator boy at the
  Hermitage inquired why he was not using his own car.</p>

  <p>The apartment was cool and quiet. Inagaki was out, probably attending to
  his marketing.</p>

  <p>Paige flung his hat on to the table in the small vestibule and walked
  through the living-room into his library. Although temperate almost to the
  point of abstinence, he maintained a cabinet of choice liquors for the use of
  his guests. He went directly to it, poured himself a stiff drink of cognac,
  and gulped it raw. Unaccustomed to such heroic potations, and having had
  nothing to eat&mdash;it was now twelve-thirty&mdash;since his light breakfast
  at seven, he felt the fiery stuff make his head swim.</p>

  <p>Telephoning the garage, he instructed Pete to go out to the hospital for
  his car.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;nothing the matter with it. Drive it back to the garage and
  bring Sylvia here."</p>

  <p>For a long time he stood at one of the front windows of his quite
  luxurious living-room, beating a tattoo on the sash with restless fingers.
  The thick traffic on the street below was a confused blur of noisy futility.
  Everything was carrying on down there as if no sudden world-destroying
  catastrophe had occurred. These people apparently hadn't heard yet that there
  was no reason for any further effort.</p>

  <p>The tragic affair of the forenoon clamoured for appraisal, but it was all
  too painfully recent for a sensible survey. On the trip home in the taxicab
  the one blistering fact that mattered most was the wanton destruction of his
  idol. As they had stood there, side by side, almost touching elbows,
  scrubbing off the blood that had been so needlessly shed, he had momentarily
  expected the big, dynamic, generous-hearted fellow to turn to him and say,
  courageously: "I was to blame, Newell. We both know that. I shall clear you
  of any responsibility, you may be sure." And he had already composed the
  quick reply, "Better let the matter rest the way it is." But
  Endicott&mdash;damn him!&mdash;had buried his hairy arms and pallid face in
  the square porcelain tub, splashing and spluttering, without a single glance,
  much less a friendly word. Endicott had crashed, completely cracked up. All
  that noble talk in his sumptuous library of an evening about professional
  ethics, good sportsmanship, the inviolability of the Hippocratic (or was it
  the hypocritic?) oath, the devotion to duty that demanded precedence over any
  and all personal ambitions&mdash;bah!&mdash;and to hell with it!</p>

  <p>Mentally inspecting him now, toppled from his pedestal, Paige realized
  that Endicott's moral disaster had not been entirely unpredictable. He had
  seen the big man slipping, slipping, day after day. Too much concern about
  money. Too much fretting about investments. Too many business conferences
  downtown. Too much travelling all night and rushing into operations in the
  morning, for which he had not prepared.</p>

  <p>There had been that Baldwin girl, for instance, only last Thursday.
  Simplest possible appendectomy. Could have done it with his eyes shut. No
  occasion at all for a fifty-minute exploratory. Hadn't studied the plate,
  that was the trouble. Was making a speech that night before the P.T.A. on
  (God help us!) "The Changing Thought of the Public in Respect to Surgery."
  Probably was thinking about that when they showed him the picture of the
  little stenographer's insides. Or wondering, perhaps, whether steel and rails
  would be stronger to-day. No matter if the twenty-dollar-a-week office clerk
  was kept in bed ten days longer than necessary. That wouldn't discommode the
  chief.</p>

  <p>No&mdash;Endicott had not crashed from some dizzy height. He had been
  sliding for a long time. Paige admitted to himself now that he had been
  afraid to see the chief operate on Mrs. Dexter. Old Lane had been afraid of
  it too. As much as said so. He regretted that he had been so surly and
  highhanded with Lane. Lane was an honest fellow, for all his fanatical rot
  about the soul-destroying effect of easy money. Maybe frowsy old Lane was
  right. One thing was sure&mdash;money hadn't improved Endicott. It had made
  him puffy, arrogant, bumptious. And now, in an emergency, he had turned out
  to be a coward and a cad.</p>

  <p>Newell's hard-driven pulse pounded in his ears. Unwilling to torture
  himself any further with thoughts of the execrable Endicott, he went into the
  library and wrote a brief letter of resignation to Watts, splutteringly
  addressed an envelope, and rose unsteadily to take another drink of cognac.
  Briefly cleared, he resumed his stand at the window, and thought of Mrs.
  Dexter.</p>

  <p>Subconsciously he had been dreading the moment when his memory would
  compel a review of her case. To his amazement, the thought of Mrs. Dexter
  calmed him somewhat. He had anticipated that the recollection of her tragedy
  would haunt him for life. Strangely enough, the painful sight of her on the
  operating-table, rapidly melting away, was driven into complete eclipse by
  the enduring vision of her in her room. Incomparably steady, she now seemed
  to stand apart from all the blundering pomposities and blustering
  incompetence and whimpering anxiety of his madly careering world&mdash;an
  indestructible symbol of self-possession.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, seated at ease in her tranquil presence, he had found himself
  smiling indulgently as she talked of "the things that make for personal
  adequacy." Under ordinary circumstances he would, he knew, have distrusted
  the phrase. People who chattered glibly of "the-things-that-make-for" this
  and that were tiresome, and more often than not turned out to be mentally
  untidy.</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Dexter's confident talk about "personal adequacy" was refreshing.
  He had enjoyed hearing it because it was so evident that she believed it. He
  had gone back to her, day after day, just to hear her say it. The very
  enunciation of the phrase had put her singularly mobile lips through all
  their pretty paces. And it was a nice theory to toy with, academically; about
  as practical as a house made of tissue-paper; very bright and attractive, so
  long as it doesn't rain.</p>

  <p>He had teasingly said this to her&mdash;just about this way&mdash;and she
  had replied, smilingly unruffled, "But doesn't it look a little like
  rain&mdash;over my house? You don't think I shall go to pieces, do you?"</p>

  <p>"No," he had declared, with sincere conviction, "you'll not go to pieces,
  whatever the weather, but that will not be because of your curious
  philosophy. It's not the philosophy that insures Mrs. Dexter: it's Mrs.
  Dexter that insures the philosophy. What difference does it make, after all,
  what one believes? If your ductless glands are functioning properly, and
  you're biologically built to be optimistic, your creed will sound attractive.
  Your Father, Son, and Holy Ghost will allure them. Or your Transmigration of
  Souls. Or your Iza-Nagi's Magic Wand. Or your Mystic Shrine of the Blue
  Flame. People with an undeveloped anterior lobe of the pituitary or an
  enlarged spleen will come with flowers for your altar, thinking it is the
  thing you believe that has made you enviably competent to survive the shocks
  and storms and live beautifully.... You might as well expect to get results
  by screwing a Rolls-Royce name-plate onto a wheelbarrow, and command it to
  get about under its own power."</p>

  <p>He distinctly remembered her drawling reply, "Pouf!&mdash;You and your
  glands! You'd better turn your old hospital into a nice new garage."</p>

  <p>It had been very stimulating to talk with Mrs. Dexter. There was nothing
  wormlike about her serenity. Nothing annoyed her, but she was abundantly able
  to take care of herself in an argument.</p>

  <p>The first time she had hinted at her curious theory, a bit shyly, he had
  suspected it of being some sort of esoteric religion, and inwardly sighed.
  Such a charming personality she was, and now she was going to be just another
  of those boresome, cult-harried women, preparing to unload an
  incomprehensible mess of sweet and sticky twitter relayed from some
  soul-surgeon. (Tuesdays at eleven in the Gold Room of the Ritz; a
  dollar-fifty, or the entire course of twelve for ten, the deep-breathing book
  gratis to subscribers.)</p>

  <p>But it was soon observable that Mrs. Dexter, far from being just a
  gullible neurasthenic, was as remote as he himself from any interest in
  metaphysical cream-puffs. Indeed, she was his superior in respect to their
  attitudes toward such fatuities. He was acutely irritated by them;
  caustically satirical about them. Once he had said to her: "All religions are
  opiatic. The old ones stick to straight chloroform. The new ones like a
  little rose-verbena in their ether, just so it makes them too drowsy to
  think. One method is good as another." Mrs. Dexter did not deride any of
  them. She gracefully dismissed them with outspread passionless hands.
  Sometimes she had shocked him beyond belief with her bland insistence upon
  what seemed like an uncompromising fatalism.</p>

  <p>"It's an odd thing," he had said, one day. "You seem the most gentle of
  spirits, but this belief you hold is hard as tool-steel. You have the
  temperament of a mystic, but your philosophy would bite a hole in a
  battleship!"</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;she would be an everlasting inspiration. Tomorrow or next day
  they would carry her out to some shady spot and leave her there to become one
  with the soil. That grisly aspect of human mortality was made strangely
  unrepellent as he remembered her self-confessed integration with "a planned
  universe" which, in her opinion, was every way sound and worthy.</p>

  <p>The door-bell rang. He answered it mechanically. Pete silently handed him
  the end of the leash and departed unthanked. Sylvia licked his hand as he
  unfastened the snap from her collar. She followed him closely into the
  library, and when he slumped into a chair she sniffed his fingers with
  quivering nostrils and whined.</p>

  <p>"Go lie down!" growled Paige savagely. Then he went to the bathroom and
  washed his hands, thoroughly, this time. Having finished, he disrobed
  completely and spent a long time under the shower. Donning a dressing-gown,
  he sought the liquor cabinet again, telling himself he must not take any more
  cognac. It should be something light. He was barely able to move about. He
  poured a copious drink of rye whisky. The telephone was ringing, but he did
  not answer it. With a whirling head, he staggered into his living-room and
  sprawled at full length on the sofa, and slept.</p>

  <p>Shortly after four he woke. Inagaki stood near, regarding him with
  concern.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Rayburn is on the 'phone, sir," said the diminutive Nipponese.</p>

  <p>"Tell him I'm out," muttered Paige thickly. "Tell everybody I'm out."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;I told him you were in, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, you go back and tell him you're a little liar!"</p>

  <p>Presently Inagaki was on hand again. He had a tall glass in which ice
  tinkled. It had a welcome sound. Paige reached for it.</p>

  <p>"Did you tell Dr. Rayburn what I said, Inagaki?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. He also say I am the little liar. He will come."</p>

  <p>"I might have known it.... What is this stuff, Inagaki?"</p>

  <p>"Limeade, sir."</p>

  <p>"It's pretty flat. Put some gin in it."</p>

  <p>Inagaki found him sound asleep when he returned, and did not molest him.
  Paige slept fitfully. The room was darker each time he was roused by the
  telephone bell and the voice of Inagaki reassuringly replying to solicitous
  inquirers. Once he heard him say, "No, Miss, Dr. Paige is at the hospital....
  He is not? Then I do not know."</p>

  <p>At length he was aware of talk close beside him. A painfully pungent whiff
  of ammonia stung him wide awake.</p>

  <p>"Hurry that coffee along, Inagaki," Rayburn was saying, "and make it
  strong."</p>

  <p>Raising himself on one elbow, Paige ran his long fingers through his
  tousled hair and regarded his guests with a feeble grin. "It's love of
  humanity brought 'em here," he intoned, with deep solemnity. "Spirit of
  service. Man can't even get quietly inebri&mdash;ineber&mdash;can't even get
  quietly drunk in his own house without stirring up a lot of excitement. Did
  you fellows bring the ambulance?"</p>

  <p>Bennie Booth chuckled a little, but Rayburn drew down the corners of his
  mouth and scowled.</p>

  <p>"If you were in the habit of getting quietly drunk in your own house,
  there would be no occasion to call out the troops." He settled an ice-bag
  firmly about Paige's temples. "Here, drink this!"</p>

  <p>"Better mix yourselves something," suggested their host, his thick head
  clearing slightly as he sat up and sipped the scalding coffee, "if you don't
  like to see me drunk by myself."</p>

  <p>Booth thought it wasn't a bad idea. No use to humiliate Newell
  unnecessarily. He would feel better if they had something. Assisted by
  Inagaki, whose bewilderment over his master's plight amused them even in the
  face of their own anxiety, they returned with ample glasses of Scotch and
  soda.</p>

  <p>"We've got to see this thing through, Bennie," Rayburn had said, under his
  breath. "Newell isn't fit to be left alone. He might do himself some damage.
  We've had enough of that for one day."</p>

  <p>Seating himself on the couch beside his dishevelled friend, Rayburn
  studied his glass, and remarked casually, "Well&mdash;tell us all about it,
  Newell. What happened? Or don't you want to talk about it yet?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet&mdash;or ever!" mumbled Paige bitterly. "Inagaki, make me one of
  those."</p>

  <p>"Mostly soda, Inagaki," added Bennie, over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"But I would like to know one thing," said Paige, when the whisky had
  lifted his fog a little, "how did the girl&mdash;and her father&mdash;bear
  up? I didn't see them afterward. Wasn't quite man enough to face 'em."</p>

  <p>Booth and Rayburn exchanged glances, each waiting for the other to invent
  an acceptable lie. Then Bennie shook his head; but Rayburn, noting that
  Newell had caught them in the act of conference, plunged into the truth.</p>

  <p>"It has been a kind of complicated affair," he began ponderously. "Of
  course you've been laid up and haven't seen the evening papers. There was a
  terrific crash in the stock market to-day. The whole town is shocked. This
  man Dexter appears to have been cleaned out, along with a half-million other
  well-to-do's. Lost his shirt. That, on top of this accident at the
  hospital&mdash;or this on top of that&mdash;was a little too much for him. So
  he pushed off, this afternoon, about five. Not a very neat job. Didn't know
  his anatomy in the cardiac zone. Lived for a couple of hours."</p>

  <p>"Ted looked after him," interjected Booth, "unconscious all the
  while."</p>

  <p>"He means Dexter was," Rayburn explained, hopeful of lifting Newell's
  dejection.</p>

  <p>"Damned silly remark," growled Paige sullenly. "And what became of the
  girl? Is she dead, too?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no; we put her to bed, over at Parkway, and sprinkled a little
  poppy-dust over her worries," replied Rayburn, pleased to be making an
  encouraging report. "But she had herself pretty well in hand, considering
  everything she'd been through: father and mother both dead and the family
  stony-broke&mdash;all in the course of about eight hours. Took it with her
  chin up. Maybe she was just stunned. Didn't want to go to bed. We thought
  she'd better. We sent some telegrams for her including a cable to her sister;
  addressed it to the young woman who is with her sister in London."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Endicott about?" inquired Paige thickly.</p>

  <p>"Huh!" snorted Bennie. "<i>That</i> bird!" Instantly aware of the
  injudicious slip, he added promptly: "I dare say he was busy. He had had a
  hard day. They say he took an awful beating in the market collapse."</p>

  <p>Newell shut off this criticism with the surly comment that he didn't care
  to hear any criticism of Dr. Endicott, denouncing Bennie for a drunken fool
  who ought to have his envy under better control. To clear the air of this
  slight disharmony, they made another highball. Inagaki offered his employer
  some advice while this was in progress and was sent scurrying off to bed.</p>

  <p>At two, the host having quite definitely passed out, Rayburn and Booth
  repaired to the kitchen, where they scrambled half a dozen eggs, grilled some
  bacon, and crowned Inagaki's statuette of Buddha with an inverted gin-jigger.
  Heartened by their success in giving a jaunty air to so profound a matter, it
  occurred to them that Newell, on waking in the morning, might appreciate some
  little memento of their playful mood at the time of taking their departure.
  Composing his arms and legs, they placed a bunch of celery across his breast,
  and drawing up two small tables at his head and feet put a pair of candelabra
  on guard. Bennie was for lighting the candles, but Rayburn, slightly less
  drunk, vetoed this mad suggestion.</p>

  <p>At four-thirty Paige woke, bewilderedly took stock of his position which
  under any less tragic circumstances would have been ridiculous, dizzily
  struggled to his feet and muttered, "Dead, eh?... Why not?"</p>

  <p>Reviving himself with another glass of cognac, he wrote a brief,
  business-like letter to his valued friend, Eugene Corley, junior member of
  the firm of attorneys who had long since handled his affairs and his father's
  before him, confident that his secret would be kept and his instructions
  meticulously obeyed. He rather wished he might have an intimate talk with his
  bachelor crony, who, although fully ten years his senior, had always been
  delightfully congenial. A postcript was added to this effect.</p>

  <p>He left the letter, sealed and stamped, on the library table, and dressed
  quickly in a rough suit of tweeds and well-worn walking shoes, the dog
  following about closely from room to room, sitting on her haunches directly
  before him while he laced his shoes, studying his face with a somewhat
  annoying solicitude.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;you can't go, Sylvia," he said gruffly, patting her on the head.
  "Not where I'm going. You're still alive. Try to make the most of it."</p>

  <p>She followed him to the door, and when he opened it squeezed past him and
  bounded out into the hall. He tried to coax her back, but Sylvia took
  advantage of his necessity to depart without raising the house. She made for
  the stairway, indifferent to her master's low-voiced cajolery and
  command.</p>

  <p>It was still dark in the street and nobody in the vicinity was astir.
  There was a decided snap in the October breeze from the lake.</p>

  <p>Paige turned south on Elm and walked briskly. Sylvia trotted at his
  heels.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MISS ARLEN and Phyllis saw them off on the <i>Berengaria</i>
  and took the noon char-à-banc back to London.</p>

  <p>It was pleasant to think that they were to have six weeks of leisurely
  browsing about together after the seventy-two hot and helter-skelter days on
  the Continent. Phyllis, especially, had reasons for anticipating this
  experience with pleasant excitement.</p>

  <p>Lined up along the rail on B-deck, as the last hawser splashed, the
  homeward-bound party looked into the upturned faces of Phyllis and Miss Arlen
  with undisguised envy&mdash;all but Patty Sumner, who was going home to be
  married on the sixteenth of October, and Miss Cogswell, who, in spite of her
  permission to arrive at Poughkeepsie a week later for the opening of the
  autumn term, was conspicuously restless to be back at her post. At least a
  normal amount of dispraise had been Miss Cogswell's portion during the
  twenty-five years of her professional career, but nobody had ever said she
  was not in earnest.</p>

  <p>All things considered, the summer's excursion had been a success. Miss
  Cogswell, recognized historian and competent art critic, had remained an
  inflexible pedagogue throughout, marshalling her high-spirited wards with a
  solicitude that had proved irksome at times, but she had been an able
  director of the tour, providing handsomely for their comfort.</p>

  <p>The managerial technique of Miss Cogswell was canny and irresistible. From
  the first day out, she had assumed that her young women (she never called
  them girls, though her discipline&mdash;the result of ten years' experience
  in a prep. school previous to her professorship in college&mdash;was better
  suited to the mood of fifteen than twenty-two) were in Europe on a serious
  errand, flatteringly imputing to them an ardent desire to devote every minute
  to the pursuit of culture.</p>

  <p>Only one unfortunate episode had briefly interrupted their mutually
  forbearing display of concord. That had been at Milan. It was too fine a
  night to be put to bed at nine-thirty. They had just arrived at seven, from a
  week in Florence of such vast improvement to the mind that an hour of
  frivolous diversion seemed appropriate.</p>

  <p>Miss Cogswell had been bathing her lame heels, when the sixth sense she
  had evolved through an earlier decade of listening and sniffing at tensely
  quiet dormitory doors warned her that the peace which rested over their suite
  in the Metropole was too complete to be real. Tugging on her shapeless
  dressing-gown, she had paddled about, peering into darkened and disordered
  rooms. Not a mother's daughter of her flock was to be found.</p>

  <p>At eleven she and Miss Arlen located them, rosily merry, huddled close
  together about a round table in the exact centre of the Café Cova, stowing
  away tall <i>parfaits.</i> Before each culprit reposed an oily plate hinting
  at a recent <i>antipasto,</i> and an empty glass of the size and shape
  frequently used in the serving of cocktails. It was a humiliating moment, in
  which the tour-director's young women looked and felt like naughty little
  kindergarteners.</p>

  <p>On the way back to the hotel, Miss Cogswell taciturnly leading on with
  stiffened spine, determined stride, straight lips, and stony eyes, Phyllis
  Dexter had lagged a little and fallen into step with Miss Arlen who was
  dispassionately defending their retreat. Phyllis admired her pretty English
  professor almost to the extent of adoration, and disliked the thought of
  having annoyed her. And sometimes she had felt genuinely sorry for her, too,
  because it was so manifest that she and Miss Cogswell&mdash;of necessity
  paired together&mdash;had very little in common.</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully sorry and ashamed," admitted Phyllis, rather shyly.</p>

  <p>"You may be sorrier an hour from now," replied Miss Arlen indifferently.
  "It was a shocking mess&mdash;sardines and ice cream."</p>

  <p>Phyllis risked a smile, but suspecting that the time was hardly propitious
  for a light-hearted view of their misdemeanour, sobered instantly and said
  with contrition, "We were horrid&mdash;making you turn out when you were
  tired and sleepy."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't sleepy," drawlingly dissented Miss Arlen, "and it is a lovely
  night. All the stars on duty."</p>

  <p>"You're a darling!" breathed Phyllis, impetuously hugging Miss Arlen's
  shapely arm. And then, just as she was withdrawing her hand, abashed over the
  impulsive liberty she had taken&mdash;for Professor Patricia Arlen, Ph.D.,
  was too coolly dignified and remote to be pawed over in this manner&mdash;to
  Phyllis's unbounded delight there was a warm pressure of response to her
  caress. It brought sudden tears to her eyes. She had distantly worshipped
  Miss Arlen, often wondering what it might be like to share the confidence of
  this enigmatic, exquisite woman. She thought she had discovered a little
  secret. Miss Arlen was human. On the inside, she was a regular fellow.</p>

  <p>No attempt was made, next day, to improve upon the comradeship they had
  tentatively confessed. Miss Arlen was smilingly distant and impartial. But
  before the week was out, it had been arranged that if Phyllis could secure
  consent from home, she would remain for a few weeks in London with Miss
  Arlen, who had contrived a four months' leave to study in the British Museum.
  She had already won recognition with her two volumes of essays on the
  Victorian Poets, and now hoped to do another book on a subject she had not
  bothered to confide to anyone, <i>The Droller Aspects of the
  Restoration.</i></p>

  <p>They followed along the dock as the <i>Berengaria</i> was tugged out,
  waving good-byes, Phyllis wondering how soon they could decently call it a
  closed incident and seek the shade. Besides, she was pipingly impatient to
  have Miss Arlen all to herself. What would it be like to live in such
  intimate contact with Miss Arlen; to share the same room with her? Phyllis
  was on tiptoe with curiosity; just a little frightened, too. She must be
  restrained, mindful of her teacher's quite justifiable dignity.</p>

  <p>At length Miss Arlen turned about, apparently satisfied that the ceremony
  of farewell had been adequately attended to, and they strolled over to the
  South Western Hotel where they were to board the char-à-banc. Presently they
  were bowling swiftly along High Street, revelling in the welcome shade. As
  they rattled under the old Bargate Arch, Miss Arlen tugged off her prim
  little hat with a girlish gesture of independence, as if the boundary of Miss
  Cogswell's jurisdiction had now been passed, and the significant smile she
  turned on Phyllis said, as plainly as if she had spoken it, "There! We are
  free now to do as we like!"</p>

  <p>Phyllis, almost suffocated with pride and happiness over Miss Arlen's
  comradely informality, again warned herself against the temptation to ignore
  the considerable difference in their rank and years.</p>

  <p>Absorbed in the quaintness of the villages and the ripened serenity of the
  countryside, they had but little to say to each other until they were within
  sight of Winchester. Phyllis was eager to talk.</p>

  <p>"Are we going back to the Tate Gallery to-morrow?" she asked, remembering
  Miss Cogswell's parting recommendation, and feeling herself on safe ground
  here.</p>

  <p>Miss Arlen tightened her pretty mouth, gave Phyllis a sidelong glance of
  mock dismay, and grinned! It was not a smile but a lazy grin! Miss Arlen
  closed one eye in a deliberate, diabolical wink!</p>

  <p>"We are going out to Kew Gardens," she said firmly, "to lie flat on our
  backs in the grass and watch the clouds. And the first one who says the word
  'art' has to buy the lunch."</p>

  <p>Phyllis sighed happily.</p>

  <p>"I'm so glad now&mdash;about that affair in Milan," she said reflectively.
  "If it hadn't happened, I might have gone home with the others. Then I should
  have missed all this&mdash;being with you, I mean. You were so understanding,
  that night."</p>

  <p>"It didn't call for much understanding," drawled Miss Arlen. "I was
  sitting in the dark by my window and saw you go. Your dash for liberty was no
  surprise."</p>

  <p>By the time they reached Basingstoke they were arriving at a least common
  denominator of mood and manner of talk. Phyllis was ecstatically loving
  London as they roared and sputtered into increasingly heavy traffic. Miss
  Arlen had forgotten her professorship.</p>

  <p>They had their baggage taken to a little hotel in Bloomsbury, round the
  corner from the Museum. Phyllis had never stopped at a place so
  unpretentious; it had been Miss Arlen's suggestion. She had need to
  economize. Unpacking, they put on their prettiest gowns, Phyllis noting with
  shy admiration that Miss Arlen, so consistently conservative on the outside,
  was almost startlingly modern while in the act of hanging her travel togs in
  the closet. At that moment she didn't look at all like an authority on
  Tennyson. It had been agreed that they would go to the Trocadero for dinner,
  Phyllis begging the right to play hostess on this festive occasion. With the
  assurance of excellent experience she ordered with discrimination, finding
  Miss Arlen in full approval of her choices.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if we shouldn't have a glass of sherry first?" suggested
  Phyllis, a bit uncertainly. "It has been a busy day; you're tired."</p>

  <p>"Please," replied Miss Arlen. "But not because I'm tired. I never felt
  better in my life."</p>

  <p>"It seems an awfully long time since you were my teacher," mused Phyllis,
  as they sipped their wine, smiling into each other's eyes, to which Miss
  Arlen responded, casually, "That occurred during one of our earlier
  incarnations. We will try to live it down."</p>

  <p>After dinner they saw <i>Bitter Sweet,</i> and returned to Bloomsbury in a
  musty little cab at midnight&mdash;Miss Arlen rather pensive and quiet.
  Without much further talk they went to their beds, Phyllis instinctively
  sensing that <i>Bitter Sweet</i> hadn't been just the thing.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Phyllis, dear," called Miss Arlen, from the depth of her
  pillow.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," responded Phyllis, her eyes misty, adding, in a reckless
  whisper, "Patricia." Her heart pounded as the silence piled up. She had made
  the very blunder she had been trying so valiantly to avoid, spoiling
  everything for them on the first day.</p>

  <p>After five long hot minutes of acute misery, she murmured contritely,
  "Please forgive me, Miss Arlen. I hadn't the right to do that."</p>

  <p>"They never called me Patricia," said Miss Arlen drowsily, "except when
  they disapproved of me. When they liked me it was always Pat."</p>

  <p>"Would it be just terribly rude&mdash;and presumptuous?" asked Phyllis,
  her voice trembling a little.</p>

  <p>"I think it would be very sweet of you, dear," replied Miss Arlen
  tenderly.</p>

  <p>Phyllis drifted out, wishing her mother knew how supremely happy she was.
  She could see her mother's smile when, at home again, she would tell her all
  about it. And she distinctly heard Sally Welker saying, "You didn't call Miss
  Arlen 'Pat'&mdash;not to her face&mdash;not really!"</p>

  <p>Had it occurred to either of them, through those enchanted days, to
  compute in terms of years their respective contributions to the diminishing
  of the distance which naturally lay between them, it would have been
  incorrect to think that they had settled upon a relationship midway in mood
  between twenty-two and thirty-five.</p>

  <p>Miss Arlen had, indeed, recovered something of her youth, but to a more
  marked degree had Phyllis achieved maturity. The attractive girl had had her
  little problems, but they had been of cartilaginous structure. She had
  bruised easily and painfully, but repair was prompt and complete. She had
  never seen a compound fracture of lime-hardened bones. Not until now. Miss
  Arlen had not uncovered her scars with a morbid wish to shock, or a
  self-piteous bid for commiseration. With cool unconcern she had exposed her
  irreparable injuries, and Phyllis had grown almost to full stature at the
  sight. She had even ventured to offer a possible remedy.</p>

  <p>The disclosure had come about naturally enough. They had been strolling
  through the Cathedral grounds at Salisbury on a brown-and-gold mid-October
  afternoon. Amused by antique epitaphs on the grass-ruffed, eroded stones,
  blandly certifying to the towering superiority of long-departed husbands as
  compared with the mousiness of their wives, the talk drifted from mere
  whimsical satire to a serious discussion of this indefensible relationship
  and the inevitable problems of matrimony.</p>

  <p>"Funny you never married, Pat," remarked Phyllis. "I wonder how you
  escaped it."</p>

  <p>"I'm not unwilling to tell you. It is quite a long story, though." Pat
  deliberated a suitable beginning. After a moment's reflection with averted
  eyes she said calmly, "He fell in love with my sister."</p>

  <p>Phyllis winced and gave a quick little breath of pained surprise, but
  offered no comment, for it was to be quite a long story and she must not
  interrupt. She waited, with startled eyes.</p>

  <p>"That's all," said Pat, in the same tone Phyllis had often heard her use
  when dismissing a class. "That's all&mdash;except that the invitations were
  out and the presents were coming in&mdash;and I found them in each other's
  arms when I came down to the library to show him my new travelling
  suit&mdash;and my favourite brother fought him and was hurt&mdash;and I ran
  away where they couldn't find me for ever so long&mdash;and they were
  married, and there are children I have never seen&mdash;and my mother lives
  with them&mdash;and all my people are in the same town&mdash;and I can't go
  home."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;my dear!" sympathized Phyllis. "How can you bear it?"</p>

  <p>"I can't," replied Pat woodenly. "That's the trouble. The effort to bear
  it has frozen me."</p>

  <p>"But you aren't, Pat!" Phyllis brightened hopefully. "I never felt so
  close to anyone, outside my own family."</p>

  <p>Pat sighed, smiled wistfully, and nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know, dear. I have been very selfish, warming myself at your bright
  fire. I'm surprised it hasn't chilled you. It really has been a Godsend to
  me&mdash;much more than you realize."</p>

  <p>Phyllis murmured an inarticulate little protest and laid her hand on Pat's
  affectionately.</p>

  <p>"I do wish you could talk with my mother," she said, searching the heavy
  eyes with loyal concern. "She has helped so many people. You'd be
  surprised."</p>

  <p>Pat's involuntary shrug doubted it. For a silent moment she reproved
  herself for having bared her wounds, fearing that she was about to learn of
  some metaphysical patent-medicine&mdash;some echo of a psychological
  wizardry, perhaps, that would dismiss cold fact with an amiable grin and a
  careless, "There, there; you'll be all right now." She closed her eyes,
  tightened her lips, and shook her head decisively.</p>

  <p>"Nothing would help me, Phyllis, but utter forgetfulness of it all. Your
  mother couldn't help me to that, however kindly she might try."</p>

  <p>"But that's just it!" exulted Phyllis. "She does it! It's something our
  Dean taught her when my little brother was drowned. I was only a baby then,
  so my mother has always had it, ever since I can remember."</p>

  <p>"Your Dean?" repeated Pat, mildly inquisitive.</p>

  <p>"Dean Harcourt&mdash;of our Cathedral&mdash;at home."</p>

  <p>"I'm not religious&mdash;not the least bit."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;but neither is he!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly!" laughed Pat.</p>

  <p>"I mean&mdash;this thing that I'm thinking about isn't religion; heaps
  bigger and more important than that. I'll try to tell you. But it won't be
  easy. You see&mdash;I've never been hurt. You have to be, I think, before it
  means very much. I guess it's a good deal like planting a tree. You have to
  dig the hole first."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I could qualify," said Pat dryly. "Let's have it."</p>

  <p>For more than two hours they sat on the grey stone bench at the entrance
  to the cloister, the fallen leaves eddying about their feet, Pat slowly
  tracing meaningless patterns on the dusty flagging with the tip of her
  umbrella, Phyllis, falteringly at first but with mounting confidence,
  pointing to the mere mirage of an oasis she had had no occasion to seek
  personally. She was conscious, all the time, that she was making a very poor
  job of it; and when, at last, her vague ideas were exhausted, an extended
  silence meant nothing other than that Pat had remained unconvinced and
  unstirred.</p>

  <p>"I think you get just a flash of it," pursued Phyllis, unwilling to
  surrender&mdash;"not the real essence of it, of course, but just a faint
  glimpse, among these old things we've been seeing lately. I've thought about
  it, a lot.</p>

  <p>"Remember the other day when we were down at Saint Olave's, sitting there
  in the dusky gloom, looking up at the bust of Elizabeth Pepys? And you had
  just been talking about all she and Sam had been through; the London fire,
  the plague, the smash-up of two governments, the frights, the flights, the
  shocks, the sorrows; and there she was, so calm, so secure; and&mdash;outside
  in the street&mdash;you could hear it pouring in through the open
  doors&mdash;the dull mutter and rumble of traffic mumbling, 'On, on, on,
  on'&mdash;and you could hear the measured plop-plop of big shaggy hoofs on
  the cobble-stones, The same old loads were still moving. Same kind of
  straining horses, bracing their lathery shoulders against the same hot
  collars, lashed and yelled at by the same cloddish drivers; and Elizabeth, up
  there, not listening, but hearing; not gladly approving, but
  accepting....</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;what? Well&mdash;I'm afraid I don't know. I can't quite define
  it. Maybe it has no bearing at all on the thing I've been trying to talk
  about... I just know that for an instant, down at Saint Olave's, there came
  over me an almost stifling wave of&mdash;of comprehension. And I said to
  myself, 'If ever I get into trouble, I should like to be able to come to some
  place like this, where to-day's struggle and pain is being hammered down hard
  on top of yesterday's&mdash;and let mine be pounded into dust and silence,
  along with Elizabeth's.'"</p>

  <p>She laid her warm hand, trembling a little with emotion, around Pat's
  slumped shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Do you follow my mood, my dear? Or am I just talking nonsense? I
  mean&mdash;about the&mdash;the foreverness of the mumble-rumble, 'On, on, on,
  on!'... Three hundred years ago it was fragile, foolish, sensitive, little
  Elizabeth Pepys, all milled up in the traffic, swept along with it, bruised
  by it, afraid of it, allured by it, but in it and of it&mdash;and now it's
  Patricia Arlen and Phyllis Dexter.</p>

  <p>"But the thing of it is that it's going on, and it has been going on, and
  it is going to keep on going on&mdash;as it was in the beginning, is now, and
  ever shall be&mdash;and my troubles, in the face of it all, aren't really
  worth worrying about.... Do you see what I mean, Pat?"</p>

  <p>"Phyllis, child," said Pat moodily, "it explains nothing, but it's a
  sedative. I think it helps&mdash;a little.... You mean"&mdash;she continued,
  gropingly&mdash;"you mean that we're all caught in the grip of something
  that's bigger and stronger than we are&mdash;something planned from the
  beginning&mdash;something inevitable&mdash;and we've simply got to keep
  coming along with it, whether we like it or not?... That's
  <i>Fatalism&mdash;</i>in case you don't know the exact name of it!"</p>

  <p>Phyllis shook her head vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Not at all, Pat. Fatalism is a treadmill. This movement I'm talking about
  is a <i>procession.</i> Fatalism says, 'I'm caught in the machinery of
  destiny and am being whirled around by it. I can't understand what it's all
  about, and I hereby give it up, and just let it grind me to bits.' That's
  Fatalism.... The thing I believe in admits the existence of the machinery,
  but sees it <i>going forward</i> instead of merely <i>going round.</i> And
  instead of asking you, as Fatalism does, to <i>submit,</i> this better theory
  invites you to <i>understand!</i> It says, 'Come along&mdash;but come with
  your eyes open!'"</p>

  <p>"It's quite worth thinking about," conceded Pat.</p>

  <p>"I wish my mother could tell you," said Phyllis wistfully. "It is so very
  beautiful, the way she explains it and lives it."</p>

  <p>Phyllis had dashed over to a little shop on Southampton Row to load her
  camera. They were going out to the old Caledonian Market to-day. There had
  been a fog when they woke at seven, but it seemed to be clearing now.
  Doubtless by the time they had done the tube trip the sun would be shining.
  Phyllis hoped so, for three consecutive days of murky sky and chilly rains
  had kept them under roofs.</p>

  <p>While she was gone, Pat received the cable. She sat down weakly, buried
  her face in her hands, and dizzily considered how with the least cruelty she
  might break the shocking news. Phyllis would be back at any moment, eyes
  alight, eager to be off for the day's excursion. The door swung open.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;are we ready? It's going to be lovely in an hour or two;
  you'll see... What is it, dear? Don't you feel well?"</p>

  <p>"Phyllis, would you mind very much if we didn't go out there to-day, I'm
  not quite in the mood for it. Maybe the fog has been dampening me. How about
  going down to Saint Olave's&mdash;to talk to Elizabeth? I believe I'd like
  to. We'll try out your little theory on me. Agreed?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," consented Phyllis cheerfully, a little disturbed by Pat's
  sudden depression. "We can go to the Caledonian thing any time. ... I think I
  would be glad to have another session with Elizabeth."</p>

  <p>Most of the trip was done by buses and little was said on the way. Pat was
  so obviously in low spirits this morning that Phyllis decided on silence as
  her own best contribution to her friend's search for tranquillity. But she
  must try to do something for Pat to-day while they were at Saint Olave's.
  Perhaps she could make her understand what she herself had felt in that
  steadying environment.</p>

  <p>It was only ten when they arrived, and they had the little church all to
  themselves. Walking slowly forward through the central aisle, they seated
  themselves in the right front pew where they could look up into the apse at
  the marble bust of Elizabeth. For ten minutes they sat together in
  silence.</p>

  <p>Stirred by the sound of a suppressed sob and the sight of Pat's face wet
  with tears, Phyllis interlaced their fingers, and whispered, hopefully,
  "Can't you hear it, my dear?"</p>

  <p>"That doesn't matter so much," said Pat thickly. "Just so <i>you</i> hear
  it."</p>

  <p>"I do!" Phyllis's tone was confident. "It thrills me! 'On, on, on,
  on'&mdash;not just going round and round&mdash;but pressing on! Headed toward
  something that has to be worked out&mdash;not alone by Elizabeth, or you, or
  me&mdash;or on some particular day in 1669 or 1929&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Pat suddenly clutched Phyllis's hand in both of hers, and whispered,
  brokenly: "Darling&mdash;I must tell you now. Something quite dreadful has
  happened... I wish it had happened to <i>me,</i> instead of you. One more
  tragedy wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Phyllis paled a little and her eyes widened, bewilderedly, as she searched
  Pat's distressed face. She swallowed convulsively and asked, with a nervous
  catch in her voice, "Pat!&mdash;what are you trying to tell me?"</p>

  <p>With agitated hands Pat opened her handbag, took out the folded and
  refolded yellow message, tucked it into Phyllis's palm and closed her fingers
  upon it. Then she slipped to her knees on the worn and faded hassock, bowing
  her head over her tightly folded arms....</p>

  <p>The steady rumble of the ancient city, symbolic of the everlasting
  procession, throbbed dully in their ears.</p>

  <p>Phyllis stared at Grace's cable. It was addressed to Pat.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">FATHER AND MOTHER DIED THIS AFTERNOON ACCIDENT TELL
  PHYLLIS GENTLY</p><br>

  <p>The message slowly slipped from her relaxed fingers and drifted to the
  floor.</p>

  <p>Too stunned to concentrate, she was conscious only of a pang of such
  loneliness as she had never experienced. The harsh, strident racket of this
  foreign city assailed her, its rasp and rattle stinging her to full awareness
  that she was far from home. There wasn't a sound, in all this tumultuous,
  metallic, unconscionable din that could be associated with anything she had
  ever known or believed or cherished. Even the dejected shoulders of the woman
  kneeling there seemed strangely unfamiliar. She was alone.</p>

  <p>Presently the tears came welling to her relief, great, scalding tears that
  freed the suffocating tightness of her throat a little. She blindly groped
  with her knees for a hassock and snuggled her trembling body close to Pat,
  who put an arm tenderly about her.</p>

  <p>For a long time they knelt together, Phyllis utterly devastated with grief
  and sobbing heart-breakingly. The old verger's wife sympathetically brought a
  glass of water. Pat wanly smiled their gratitude, but did not allow Phyllis
  to be disturbed. The sobbing gradually subsided. Phyllis was very quiet now.
  Pat waited. The minutes dragged out into the third quarter struck from a
  neighbouring clock-tower.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Phyllis stirred and stiffened to attention. Pat was ruthlessly
  snatched out of a painful reverie by the clutch of the girl's strong fingers
  on her arm.</p>

  <p>"What is it, dear?" asked Pat.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" whispered Phyllis, wide-eyed. "Pat!" she called, with an
  exultant little smile, "<i>I can hear it!"</i></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT is presumable that among the more thoughtful of those who
  sought the counsel of Dean Harcourt, some were impressed by the fact that,
  although he was a unique personality, not too easily evaluable, his mind and
  mood were essentially the product of the Cathedral.</p>

  <p>For more than three-quarters of a century, Trinity Cathedral had been one
  of the most highly respected institutions of the entire Middle West. This
  distinction may have been due partly to her imposing architecture, a stately
  Gothic strongly reminiscent of York Minster. It may have been accounted for
  also by her commanding location, for the Cathedral close was bounded by four
  spacious streets, one of them Lake Boulevard, the most prominent avenue in
  the city. Moreover, the great edifice faced beautiful Madison Park, to the
  considerable advantage of her massive towers and old-worldish buttresses.</p>

  <p>But Trinity's influential position rested upon something more
  consequential than these fortunate external phenomena. There had grown up a
  general public sentiment to the effect that you always knew where to find
  her. She was not subject to the sudden chills and fevers which wobbled the
  erratic pulse of many another institution displaying similar symbols in the
  windows. Trinity had been singularly immune to widespread emotional
  epidemics. Sometimes neighbouring churches of clamorous importance were
  exasperated over her reluctance or downright refusal to participate in their
  tempestuous crusades of reform, and many an ardent front-paged apostle of
  despair had eloquently rated her for cold-blooded indifference to society's
  imminent collapse. A devastating crisis was on, shouted the gloomsters, and
  Trinity merely sat there and mumbled: "In all time of our tribulation; in all
  time of our prosperity, Good Lord, deliver us."</p>

  <p>She had even kept her poise throughout the war, remaining discreetly
  neutral until the Government had officially declared itself otherwise, a
  difficult position which had drawn the fire of several prophets who were
  eager to be early on the field of battle and hotly impatient of these
  lackadaisical delays.</p>

  <p>Then she had loyally advocated patriotic sacrifice, but without the
  prevalent hysteria, which had been interpreted by many as another proof of
  her habitual unconcern. One zealot preached a widely quoted sermon on the
  Laodiceans, who were neither hot nor cold, and pointed in the direction of
  the well-known Yorkish towers as a deplorable case of such apathy.</p>

  <p>But Trinity did not allow herself to be disconcerted. When most of the
  other churches were hanging the Kaiser, Sunday after Sunday, she continued to
  intone, with a dispassionateness that infuriated the swashbucklers, "Save and
  deliver us, we humbly beseech thee, from the hands of our enemies." That was
  all you could expect, rasped the militants, of prayers that had to be read
  from a book! They had no capacity to arouse moral indignation!</p>

  <p>When peace arrived and it was again prudent for Christian pacifism to put
  forth foliage and blossoms, Trinity's neighbours had given themselves to an
  orgy of increasingly bold resolutions that they would never, under any
  circumstance whatsoever, take up arms in an aggressive movement. Heartened by
  response to this endeavour, they took the next step fearlessly, declaring
  that they would never fight even in the defence of their country. Trinity did
  not go on record with convictions on this subject, and when heavily pressed
  for a declaration, announced that so far as she was concerned all such
  matters would have to be dealt with on their own merits when and if they
  called for a decision. The younger fry among the clergy pointed a
  disapproving finger toward her, asserting that Trinity was dead on her feet
  and didn't realize that she was stricken of a disease that would presently
  carry her off. But she continued to carry on as if quite unaware of the
  supposed lethal nature of the infirmity.</p>

  <p>In the north-east tower a carillon of great value and wide repute played
  on week-days, from four to five, the historic hymns of the Anglican faith,
  and it was traditional that this daily programme always began and ended with
  <i>O God Our Help in Ages Past,</i> which seemed to be Trinity's theme song.
  On certain occasions of national grief or gratification, when the emotional
  tide ran high, these serenely confident measures may have stirred many people
  who ordinarily did not think much about their own spiritual reliances, and it
  is not inconceivable that some of the more discriminating, who had been
  bullied and badgered from one extreme opinion to another by institutions
  given to noisy tantrums of ecstasy or woe, were at least momentarily
  stabilized.</p>

  <p>A high wrought-iron fence enveloped on three sides the Cathedral close.
  This gave the whole establishment an air of sequestration from the raucous
  hurly-burly of secular affairs, a redundant precaution, perhaps, for it was
  hardly necessary that Trinity should thus emphasize her insular aloofness
  from the contemporary fret.</p>

  <p>At the back of the main edifice and facing on to Marlborough, were the
  Bishop's Mansion, the Parish House, and the residence of the Dean.</p>

  <p>It was rumoured that there were telephones, typewriters, an adding
  machine, a few clerks, and the inevitable paraphernalia of business covertly
  tucked away in a remote corner of the Parish House, but the casual visitor
  who had occasion to call there was not assaulted at the front door by the
  metallic racket of modern machinery.</p>

  <p>Latterly there had been a fad, originated by city churches and amusingly
  imitated by the less busy elsewhere, to give the impression that the
  operation of "The Kingdom" should be pursued by up-to-date techniques
  consonant with the methods of great factories engaged in the fabrication and
  distribution of commercial commodities. In such enterprising strongholds the
  prophet's desk was cluttered with telephones dangling from adjustable
  brackets. A row of buttons served his urgency in buzzing the various members
  of his staff into his presence to report on the success of last night's
  'banquet' of the Carpenter's Apprentices, to present printer's proofs of the
  weekly bulletin and the newspaper advertising for Sunday, the programme for
  the Advance Club, and what had been ascertained about the leak in the roof.
  His stenographer sat with her pad on her knee, licking the point of her
  pencil, poised for action. The Millennium was about to be delivered, F.O.B.,
  as per yours of the thirteenth which, if you have further occasion to advert
  to it in future negotiations, should be keyed MBX13579.</p>

  <p>Trinity had never railed at this nonsense, considering it none of her
  business, but she had not gone in for it herself. The people who entered her
  quiet precincts were asked the nature of their errands by unflustered
  employees trained to understand that the less professional they were, the
  more ably they would discharge their duties.</p>

  <p>George Harcourt was a product of Trinity Cathedral. Her mind and his were
  in complete accord. Perhaps they may have influenced one another somewhat
  during the twenty years of his deanship. His serenity had become so potent
  that persons of every conceivable type came to him for advice, consolation,
  and encouragement. It was a heavy load to carry, but he never complained of
  it.</p>

  <p>Every week-day but Saturday a procession of men tarried in the
  reception-room of his residence, taking turns in conference with him, keeping
  him at his desk from ten to one. In the afternoon, from three to six, women
  of all ages and ranks appeared there for the same purpose. He never referred
  to it or thought of it as a 'clinic'. He compiled no statistics, posted no
  records, permitted no clerical fussiness in the handling of this strange
  business. An unassuming volunteer for the day welcomed the callers and seated
  them. In due time they would have their turn.</p>

  <p>Every morning at eight two young curates placed strong hands under the
  Dean's elbows and led him&mdash;for he was a cripple&mdash;into the dimly
  lighted chancel of the Cathedral, where, whatever storms might be blowing
  outside, whatever tumultuous issues might be agitating the city or the nation
  or the world, his resonant voice intoned a petition "for all sorts and
  conditions of men; that Thou wouldst be pleased to make Thy ways known unto
  them."</p>

  <p>When the early morning service was ended, the curates would assist the
  Dean to a chair placed for him in the centre of the chancel, facing the high
  altar, and leave him alone for a half-hour.</p>

  <p>And thus it was that when broken people came to Dean Harcourt for
  reconditioning, most of them, it was said, went out of his presence with the
  feeling that they had been very close to Headquarters.</p>

  <p>She entered the Dean's office-library and crossed it with the agile,
  elastic, assured stride of complete physical fitness under superb control,
  seated herself gracefully in the chair he indicated, directly facing him,
  laid an expensive handbag on the spacious mahogany desk which separated them,
  and loosened the collar of an exquisite Persian-lamb coat.</p>

  <p>"Sonia Duquesne," she said, in response to his low-voiced query.</p>

  <p>The interview did not proceed any further than that for a long moment.</p>

  <p>Bearing most of his weight on the broad arms of his tall-backed churchly
  chair, the Dean leaned forward, pursed his lips thoughtfully, and took
  friendly stock of her. The rather hard, sophisticated smile she had brought
  along was gradually replaced by an almost entreating expression of
  self-defence, of meekness, of tenderness too, for it was now apparent to her
  that his deep-lined face bore unmistakable evidence of suffering.</p>

  <p>They studied each other silently, with candid concern, Sonia so impressed
  and stilled by the spiritual majesty of the man that she accepted his
  scrutiny of her without the slightest sensation of self-consciousness.</p>

  <p>It was a singularly interesting face. The upper lip was extraordinarily
  long, giving the firm but generous mouth an appearance of being securely
  locked. Perhaps, reflected Sonia, it was his mouth that encouraged strangers
  to confide in him. A friend had told her that people found it easy to tell
  him all about themselves without embarrassment or restraint. Doubtless it was
  the mouth that made them confident. It seemed to have been built especially
  for the safe keeping of secrets. And there was something uncannily prescient
  in his eyes. They were dark, almost cavernous. A veritable sunburst of
  crow's-feet at the outer corners gave the effect of a residual smile of
  compassion, which softened the penetrating search and interpreted it as a
  comradely quest. His thick white hair shone silver in the single light
  suspended above his head, a light that intensified, by strong shadows, the
  ruggedness of his face.</p>

  <p>"That is your real name?" asked the Dean.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I know it is a bit fantastic. But it is mine. My father's people
  were of French descent and my mother thought Sonia a pretty name. She saw it
  in a story."</p>

  <p>"It is a pretty name, and I had not thought it incongruous, but you do not
  look foreign. When was it and where&mdash;that your mother read the
  story?"</p>

  <p>"In 1901&mdash;Cedar Rapids."</p>

  <p>"You are unmarried?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Sonia, her eyes occupied with the gloves which she had
  unbuttoned and was tugging off, finger by finger. Glancing up, she met his
  gaze, and added, "No&mdash;I was never married."</p>

  <p>"Am I right in surmising that you are engaged in something
  theatrical?"</p>

  <p>"Again I must answer&mdash;yes and no&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Dean acknowledged her honest candour with a slight inclination of the
  head. Sonia saw that she had said the right thing.</p>

  <p>"I am the proprietor of a little shop, dealing in gowns. My
  clients&mdash;my customers prefer to think I am Parisian. I make no effort to
  counteract that belief. The place does have a foreign atmosphere. Perhaps I
  am theatrical&mdash;to the extent of playing a part in the course of my daily
  business."</p>

  <p>"Do you attend the services of the Cathedral?" asked the Dean, still
  smiling a little over her frank confession.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; I have no religion."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then. Let us begin. Tell me all about it. What brought you
  here?&mdash;and remember that the more directly you come to it, the more time
  we will have to talk&mdash;profitably. What has he done to you?"</p>

  <p>She sat for a while with a perplexed expression, her lips parted, slightly
  baring pretty teeth, tensely locked.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I am not a mind-reader," explained the Dean gently, "but I have
  had much experience in listening."</p>

  <p>"I believe that," said Sonia. "Well&mdash;he has decided to go back to his
  wife. She is not very well, and thinks she wants him. She has treated him
  very shabbily. It was her fault that he lost interest in their home. Now she
  begs him to return. I urged him to go. And I intend never to see him
  again.... That was yesterday." Sonia finished pulling off her gloves, and
  laid them on the desk beside the handbag with a little gesture of finality.
  Her hands were white and well cared for.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;I really did not come to you for advice," she continued. "For
  there is nothing to decide. They told me you were able to help people who had
  trouble. That's why I came. I'm glad I did... this is a very restful place.
  You will not scold me. I've had all the punishment I can take."</p>

  <p>"You love him&mdash;I think."</p>

  <p>"Devotedly! And he loves me. He needs me, too, for he has been very
  unfortunate recently&mdash;since the crash."</p>

  <p>"Did he contribute to your support?"</p>

  <p>"Never! It wasn't on that basis, at all. In fact, for the past few
  weeks&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt's lips tightened, and he slowly raised a hand.</p>

  <p>"Don't you want me to tell you?" asked Sonia, wide-eyed, shaking her head
  girlishly.</p>

  <p>"Not that.... I think you will feel better afterwards if you do not
  confide that part of it."</p>

  <p>Sonia looked puzzled; then nodded approval.</p>

  <p>"I take it that you bear his wife no ill-will?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, not at all," she replied quickly. "In fact, lately, since he has
  been so hard-pressed, and I knew she was ill, I have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't!" commanded the Dean, so sternly that she winced under his
  unexpected rebuke. "You mustn't tell that to anybody&mdash;not even to me!"
  His voice grew gentle. "And may I add that I consider you a very fortunate
  woman to be possessed of such a soul.... If you were my daughter I would be
  proud of you."</p>

  <p>Her lips trembled as she replied, "Soul? I hardly knew I had one."</p>

  <p>"Yes," sighed the Dean, running his long fingers through the shaggy hair
  at his temples. "Yes&mdash;that's the trouble. People collide with
  circumstances that push them off the commonly accepted moral
  reservation&mdash;and then they assume that they have lost their souls....
  See here! Do you know anything about football?"</p>

  <p>"A little. I often go. I did&mdash;last Saturday."</p>

  <p>"Very good. You will have noticed then that a player sometimes runs out of
  bounds. Often it's his own fault, though frequently he is <i>forced</i> over
  the chalk-line. But, however it may have happened, he isn't sent home in
  disgrace. The game officials mark the spot where he went out, and carry the
  ball back into the field from that point."</p>

  <p>"And then," said Sonia, "he loses his right to it."</p>

  <p>"Only temporarily," corrected the Dean, pleased with this feature of his
  allegory. "He may quickly regain his right to pick up the ball. There is no
  telling but the next time he lays hands on it, he will go through for a
  touchdown."</p>

  <p>"You don't think I've lost my soul, then?"</p>

  <p>"I should be more disposed to think," declared the Dean warmly, "that you
  have just now come to the place in your life where the essential fineness of
  you is about to have its great chance."</p>

  <p>"What would you have me do?" asked Sonia sincerely.</p>

  <p>"You must find somebody or something to absorb your love&mdash;a child,
  perhaps, or a worthy charity in which you may invest yourself personally.
  Your case is not so difficult as you think. You came to grief through love.
  It is the people who get into trouble through hate&mdash;they're the ones I
  worry over. Sometimes it is very hard to help them. Love is a
  gift&mdash;abused, overlooked, misdirected, quite frequently&mdash;but a
  gift, nevertheless. Hate is a disease. And you, obviously, are not a
  hater.</p>

  <p>"This encourages me to believe that you may be able to understand to what
  an extent the happiness of the world depends upon the clear vision of people
  who have a natural talent for love&mdash;to neutralize the bad influence of
  the people who are diseased by hate. Let me show you what I mean...."</p>

  <p>The Dean edged himself far forward in his chair, rested his elbows on the
  desk, and looked Sonia steadily in the eyes, urging her earnest
  concentration.</p>

  <p>"You see&mdash;not many people take time to consider how they are related
  to the Long Parade. They snatch their little pleasures; they bemoan their
  little disappointments; they smile and smirk and sigh and sulk, reacting
  variously to events affecting them as individuals. But they do not think of
  themselves as component parts of <i>an era.</i> They fail to understand that
  we are all trudging along, elbow to elbow, in an endless, tightly integrated
  procession, in which our most important interests are held in common.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes they sense it a little when some large catastrophe has
  frightened them into a huddle. It is often reported of groups that they have
  felt it keenly in time of shipwreck, battle, or some mass tragedy. Then they
  live, for an hour, in a previously unexperienced state of nobility,
  discovering themselves to be brave, and suddenly impressed by the fact that
  human beings are all related.</p>

  <p>"People with an extraordinary talent for love should be able to understand
  this in the ordinary process of living, and get the same thrill out of
  uneventful daily life that the shipwrecked experience when tugged together by
  sudden misfortune.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;this brings us up to your case&mdash;your love has been so
  urgent that it has led you to defy the social canons. You would like to atone
  for it, or at least try to justify your possession of a love so reckless.
  Very well&mdash;I say!&mdash;you can do it! You <i>must</i> do it! Try to
  begin your thinking about this by believing that the successful onward push
  of the human procession is the important thing, after all; far more important
  than any of the trifling ups and downs of the individuals.... Sometimes I
  like to think of civilization as a ship. That ship, my friend, is more
  important than any member of the crew! If you want to pay for the privilege
  of your love&mdash;and the mistakes of your love&mdash;believe that!"</p>

  <p>They sat for a little while in silence. The Dean had made a platitude
  sound vital, dynamic. Sonia distinctly felt the strong tug of it. Her eyes
  were contemplative.</p>

  <p>"That's all," said the Dean, rousing from the reverie into which he had
  momentarily drifted. "I shall be thinking of you. We will try to find
  something specific for you to do. Are you agreed?"</p>

  <p>She rose to go, apparently reluctant to leave.</p>

  <p>"I hope I can hold this feeling when I am outside again&mdash;in the
  street," she said meditatively. "There is something about this
  place&mdash;and you&mdash;that has made my worries seem very small....
  Forgive my asking&mdash;if this isn't the thing to say&mdash;but shouldn't I
  pay somebody for this interview&mdash;pay it to the Cathedral, maybe?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the Dean, "I was just coming to that. You are to go through
  that door at the right. You will find a small dressing-room. Take off your
  hat and coat, and return to me."</p>

  <p>She stood for a moment, mystified; then smiled, and obeyed. Presently she
  was back, waiting orders, her face full of inquiry.</p>

  <p>"Now I want you to go out to the reception-room where you waited when you
  came here, and inquire who is next. You will take that woman, whoever she is,
  into the small adjacent room: you know the one I mean."</p>

  <p>"Where your secretary took me," said Sonia. "Really&mdash;she was the
  sweetest person I ever met, Dean Harcourt. She was so tender&mdash;and
  understanding."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you found her so.... Well&mdash;you take your lady into that
  little room and let her tell you all she wants to about her reasons for
  coming here, asking her the same general questions you were asked. And then
  you come back and tell me. After that, you may bring her to my door. Then you
  will be free to recover your belongings and go your way. There is another
  exit from the dressing-room, leading into the hall."</p>

  <p>Sonia hesitated.</p>

  <p>"But, Dean Harcourt"&mdash;she protested&mdash;"it seems such a pity to
  ask <i>me</i> to do this when I have had no experience&mdash;and there is
  your secretary, outside, who knows exactly what to say to people. I never met
  anyone so&mdash;so thoroughly fitted to deal with a person in trouble."</p>

  <p>The Dean smiled enigmatically.</p>

  <p>"That woman is not my secretary," he said quietly. "She was my last
  caller&mdash;just before you came."</p>

  <p>Sonia's amazement parted her lips and narrowed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you always make them do that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;just the ones I think I can trust to do it well."</p>

  <p>"I'll try," she said.</p>

  <p>She was gone for about five minutes and returned with a distressed face.
  It was quite evident that she had been crying.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;Dean Harcourt&mdash;it's about her little girl. The doctors told
  her this morning that the little thing isn't ever going to be right,
  mentally; a brain tumour, or something. She's simply heart-broken.... And
  there wasn't a thing I could say that would have been of any comfort to
  her.... I just held her&mdash;and couldn't talk. I'm afraid you made a
  mistake in sending me out there."</p>

  <p>"It was very well done, I think," said the Dean. "Now go and bring her in.
  And then you go round to the dressing-room and powder your nose&mdash;and run
  along. It has been a good day's work."</p>

  <p>Sonia impulsively clasped his hand.</p>

  <p>"I think you're wonderful!" she exclaimed, smiling pensively through her
  tears.</p>

  <p>"No, Sonia," he replied, measuring his words slowly, "I'm not
  wonderful.... But you have made connexion with something, this afternoon,
  that <i>is wonderful</i>&mdash;<i>wonderful!"</i> Drawing himself out of the
  introspective mood in which he seemed to have been speaking more to himself
  than to her, he added: "When you leave the dressing-room, if you turn to the
  right the hallway will lead you directly into the nave of the Cathedral....
  Go out that way. And when you are there, tarry a moment, sit down, face the
  altar, and say a little prayer for me.... I am not very strong, you know, and
  I need the co-operation of people like you."</p>

  <p>The clock in the great bell-tower was striking four. Trinity's theme-song
  vibrated in the air.</p>

  <p>Sonia sank to her knees beside the Dean's chair and murmured, brokenly,
  "People like <i>me!... Oh, my God!"</i></p>

  <p>He laid a firm hand on her quivering shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said gently, "your friend is waiting."</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet and walked unsteadily to the door, stood for a moment
  with her hand on the knob, wiping her eyes and striving valiantly to regain
  her self-control. Then she glanced back at the Dean, who sat with his elbows
  on the desk, his seamed face cupped in his hand, and a rapt expression in his
  eyes, listening to the bells.</p>

  <p>Sonia smiled bravely, and turned the knob.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll be all right now," she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;child," replied the Dean, as one answering from a dream,
  "you'll be&mdash;all right&mdash;now."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"SOMETHING tells me, Dr. Norwood, that you came here to
  please our mutual friend Sinclair rather than in pursuit of a personal
  wish."</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt significantly tapped the typed note with his gold pince-nez
  and regarded his taciturn guest with an interrogatory smile.</p>

  <p>Andrew Norwood, who with suppressed impatience had been dourly torturing a
  closely clipped, fair moustache, stole a quick glance from under his
  contracted brows, reluctantly met the Dean's inquiring eyes, recrossed the
  lengthy legs of a former all-American tackier, and drew his normally pleasant
  mouth into something half-way between a scowl and a grin.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," amplified the Dean, with the barest suggestion of a bantering
  twinkle, "a letter of introduction is a white elephant."</p>

  <p>The interview was not taking off as Norwood had expected. This Dean
  Harcourt was anything but the benignly naïve old gentleman he had pictured.
  His infrequent glimpses of the distinguished churchman had been at a long
  range. He had seen him, a time or two, on the platform at large civic
  assemblies; had heard him read a formal prayer at a Commencement; had
  indifferently assumed him to be the typical stage-jeered clergyman, medieval,
  other-wordly, unctuous, and sweetly suave. Doubtless he would be so flattered
  by an unsolicited call from a university professor, bearing a letter from a
  prominent bank president, that his surprised delight would make him
  annoyingly agreeable. Norwood knew now that he had been mistaken, and felt
  himself at an absurd disadvantage in the presence of this man who had the
  eyes of a fluoroscope.</p>

  <p>"It is quite true, sir," he confessed stiffly, "that I might not have
  asked for this conference but for the suggestion of Mr. Sinclair."</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt received this frankness with a cordial bow. Bombarded all
  day long with the emotional onslaughts of people who hurled their troubles at
  him through a drizzle of tears, it was refreshing to face this sullen but
  handsome fellow whose every gesture said that he hadn't wanted to come.</p>

  <p>"Robert Sinclair," remarked the Dean casually, "is a trustee of Trinity
  Cathedral and a personal friend of mine. May I inquire how he is related to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"He did not tell you?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Norwood stroked his strong jaw moodily, and considered an explanation.</p>

  <p>"I had hoped you might not ask me that," he said, at length, with a trace
  of asperity. "I had occasion yesterday to negotiate a modest loan. As a small
  depositor with no collateral, I was referred to Mr. Sinclair. In the course
  of our conversation, which involved an intimate account of my personal
  affairs from the cradle to the grave, he advised me to talk to you."</p>

  <p>"And granted you the loan on that condition?"</p>

  <p>"Well," admitted Norwood, flushing slightly, "he did not demand it, in so
  many words; but he made it quite clear that he expected me to comply."</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt adjusted his glasses and dipped his pen in the ink.</p>

  <p>"Now that you have discharged this part of your obligation to Mr.
  Sinclair," he said dryly, "I shall sign my name to his letter and restore it
  to you so that you may be able to prove&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I say, sir," growled Norwood, hitching his chair a little closer to
  the big mahogany desk, "I haven't meant to be so testy and impolite. I have
  been in trouble. But it isn't the sort of thing I want to confide. If I did,
  I wouldn't go&mdash;off my own bat&mdash;to a member of your profession.
  Whatever feeling I have toward the church is antagonistic. My presence here
  is an impertinence. And&mdash;anyway&mdash;I dislike to air my private
  perplexities."</p>

  <p>"I can understand that attitude." The Dean leaned back at ease in his tall
  chair, as if the business of their conference had been concluded. "Your
  disinclination to talk about your troubles puts me on your side, I think. You
  are fortunate in that you do not want to be pitied. In most cases, pity is
  ruinous. All one needs to say to many an unhappy person is, 'You poor thing!'
  and the victim immediately sets about it to demonstrate how poor a thing he
  is."</p>

  <p>Norwood pulled a crooked smile which said that he was not going to be
  taken into camp easily.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;we don't have to discuss your affairs," continued Dean Harcourt.
  "I observe that you are a professor of modern history. Perhaps you would
  prefer to talk about that. Who, for instance, did more for
  England&mdash;Gladstone or Disraeli?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I am a professor of history," snapped Norwood, suddenly aflame.
  "My trouble is located at that spot," he went on impetuously. "I came to the
  university as an associate professor in 1923. Two years later I was given a
  full professorship. It was no secret in the faculty that when Professor
  Denton reached retirement age, I was expected to succeed him as head of the
  department. It was his wish. As you are undoubtedly aware, Dr. Denton, after
  many months of illness&mdash;during which time I assumed his
  duties&mdash;died in September. Our new president, Dr. Markham, has just
  announced that he is bringing in Ware of Oxford to take the position.</p>

  <p>"This has been a serious disappointment to me, sir. For one thing, I have
  need of the increased salary; had already liberalized my budget in
  anticipation of it. But&mdash;far more importantly&mdash;this has been a blow
  to my career."</p>

  <p>He paused, and for the first time looked Dean Harcourt squarely in the
  eyes with a man-to-man request for sympathetic understanding, meeting
  encouragement in the deep-lined face. Norwood was suddenly struck with the
  ineradicable marks of long-borne pain which furrowed the tense lips.</p>

  <p>"Since the death of my wife," Norwood surprised himself by confiding,
  "there has been little to absorb my time and thought but my profession. That
  was four years ago. We were very good companions. I have a small child. I am
  trying to keep her with me. She is a comfort, of course, but the care of her
  limits my outside interests. My profession, therefore, constitutes my present
  life. I have thrown myself into it with complete abandonment of everything
  else. And now it appears that I have gone about as far in it as I am likely
  to go. At sixty I shall be exactly where I am&mdash;at thirty-eight."</p>

  <p>"Do your students appear to have any opinions on this subject?"
  interjected Dean Harcourt.</p>

  <p>"They do!" declared Norwood promptly. "I am told there was a well-attended
  indignation meeting, the night before last."</p>

  <p>"Rather unfortunate," remarked the Dean. "However, you will be able to
  correct that before it has done any damage."</p>

  <p>"Damage! What damage? Shouldn't they have the right to express themselves
  on this injustice?"</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt sat silently toying with a paper-knife, broodingly searching
  his visitor's troubled face. Presently his eyes drifted slowly to a beautiful
  etching on the southern wall, at his left&mdash;a superb reproduction of
  Holman Hunt's <i>The Light of the World.</i> Norwood's gaze, instinctively
  following along, rested briefly on the picture. He was annoyed. The Dean was
  staging a rebuke.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he muttered, nodding his head toward the etching, "that is
  the ideal attitude to take&mdash;crown of thorns&mdash;meek
  submission&mdash;gentle tapping on the door that has been slammed in one's
  face. Not much of that on display at the university, I can assure
  you!&mdash;and it's supposedly a Christian institution. <i>He</i> may have
  been the light of the world; but, so far as I can see, organized Christianity
  has done more to keep the world in darkness than any other influence in human
  history! Even the Buddhists never burned a scientist at the stake!"</p>

  <p>"They never had any to burn," said Dean Harcourt quietly. "But&mdash;be
  all that as it may, Dr. Norwood," he continued, waiving the irascible
  comments of his gloomy guest, "it seems to me that this apparent misfortune
  of yours is an important event in your career. You have now been
  offered&mdash;left-handedly, I admit&mdash;an unusual opportunity. Here are
  the facts in the case. You have been badly treated and the university knows
  it. A position to which you were entitled has been given to a stranger. Your
  students are loyally incensed. They will be prejudiced against the new man
  when he arrives. This will make it difficult for the history department to
  function properly.</p>

  <p>"You, I take it, would be the last man to desire that unhappy state of
  things, for you are sincerely interested in the welfare of your
  department&mdash;so much so, indeed, that you should have been put in command
  of it. Why don't you call a meeting of your indignant students and request
  them to accept the situation exactly as it stands? The ship is more important
  than any member of the crew&mdash;including the captain and the first mate.
  When this Oxford professor turns up, be his friend."</p>

  <p>Norwood, slightly mollified, was listening attentively now.</p>

  <p>"You will discover," predicted the Dean, "that your faculty friends will
  be glad that an episode threatening disruption and bad feeling has been
  handled with diplomacy. And as for your students... man!&mdash;what a chance!
  If you are looking for a brilliant career as a teacher, step into it. It is
  ready and waiting for you. The average college youngster is much more
  interested in sportsmanship than scholarship. This disappointment of yours,
  if properly interpreted, is going to add importance to every word you say in
  your classroom.</p>

  <p>"History must be rather difficult to teach, these days," pursued the Dean,
  soliloquizing. "So much of it has been shown to be merely nationalistic
  propaganda; monumental falsehoods, spread on a large canvas; unjustifiable
  mass martyrdoms demanded by the greed and egotism of selfish and pompous
  men.... And that's a pity, for there has been no influence so far-reaching
  and ennobling as these epics of gallant hazards. To preserve the essential
  values of that stirring saga, it must be interpreted to this new generation
  by men who, themselves, are morally equipped to recognize bravery when they
  see it. If this task of evaluating history is delegated to muck-rakers,
  idol-smashers, and grave-robbers, the moral losses will be incalculable, and
  a great deal of the damage will be irreparable. The oncoming crop of young
  men have had it explained to them that war is a racket. And perhaps it is
  just as well, for the sake of the world's peace, that this sentiment should
  be developed. But it should also be taught that <i>courage is not a
  racket!</i> And the man best qualified to point out that distinction is one
  who can talk about heroism with the authority of personal experience.</p>

  <p>"You see, my friend," persisted Dean Harcourt earnestly, "we are at our
  best when serving as time-binders. Heaven help the era that scornfully
  repudiates its past! The normal human spirit has an instinctive talent for
  the building of monuments and a reverent regard for the sanctity of tombs.
  The average man, whether he realizes it or not, has been more directly guided
  into whatever nobility he possesses by the silent inspiration of the valiant
  dead than the clarion challenges of his own time. Would it not be a vast
  misfortune if, by the ruthless destruction of that guidance, we and those who
  come after us should be doomed to live in a world of pillaged sepulchres and
  desecrated shrines?</p>

  <p>"Now it happens that the very large majority of all these inspiring
  memorabilia are reminiscent of wars. Most of the heroes who sit on iron
  horses in the public parks of all nations were celebrated soldiers; most of
  the marble busts of eminent statesmen in the world's cherished halls of fame
  perpetuate the glory of diplomatists who came by their distinction during
  periods of strife.... You historians are very properly teaching the potential
  leaders of the new day to despise and discountenance war. So be it. You are
  on the right track, I think. But the thing that worries me is the utter
  absence of a programme for the monuments to be erected now and henceforth.
  What kind of people are going to bestride the iron horses of the future? What
  symbols of valour do you suggest? Perhaps you will advocate the type of
  courage exemplified in personal sacrifice and self-renunciation for the sake
  of the general good. Do you think you could ever stir a youngster's pulse
  with that manner of appeal? Could you make the call of self-abandoning duty
  alluring enough to compete with the rattle of a drum? I firmly believe you
  could! But&mdash;to do it with any hope of success, you yourself would have
  to come into your lecture-hall armed with the credentials certifying that
  <i>you had tried it!"</i>...</p>

  <p>"I do see your point," agreed Norwood, "and I admit the soundness of your
  argument. But&mdash;even so&mdash;to have been completely thwarted in one's
  rightful expectation of professional advancement is a nasty dose to take.
  Perhaps"&mdash;he went on, feeling his way&mdash;"perhaps you do not realize
  just what that means, Dean Harcourt. You yourself have been a very successful
  man in your profession. You are well at the top of it. I dare say you never
  experienced what I am going through."</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt slowly raised his dark, cavernous eyes, and gave Norwood a
  long, searching look that made him wonder to what length of inexcusable
  impudence he had committed himself. It was so very plainly written on this
  man's face that he had suffered.</p>

  <p>He waited, flushed with chagrin, for the Dean to defend himself against
  the charge that he had counselled a sacrifice of personal ambition without a
  first-hand knowledge of its cost. A whole minute passed. Dean Harcourt
  ventured no reply to the challenge; sat now with bowed head. It left Norwood
  defencelessly despising himself.</p>

  <p>After a while the Dean glanced up from the reflective mood into which he
  had fallen, and smiled. It was exactly as if he were tolerantly ignoring the
  awkward, blustering arrogance of a ten-year-old boy. Norwood disliked to have
  the interview close on this diminished seventh chord, but it was now quite
  obvious that Dean Harcourt had no intention of ending it otherwise.</p>

  <p>"I meant no offence, sir," ventured Norwood uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Then there is none," replied the Dean.</p>

  <p>Norwood rose to go.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said deferentially, extending his hand.</p>

  <p>"I wish there was some way for me to repay you for the time you have given
  me."</p>

  <p>The Dean's eyes suddenly lighted.</p>

  <p>"I think you mean that," he said cordially, "and I am going to accept your
  tentative offer. Of late, I have been seriously disturbed about this very
  matter we have been discussing&mdash;the menaced values of history. I want
  some light on the subject. I have need to consult an expert in this field.
  There are many questions of a technical nature that I should like to ask you,
  for my personal benefit. This is, of course, quite unrelated to your own
  dilemma.... I wonder how you would like to come here to my house&mdash;it is
  difficult for me to go to yours&mdash;and spend an evening with me, some time
  in the very near future. I need your counsel, Norwood."</p>

  <p>"It would be a great pleasure, sir."</p>

  <p>"You would come to dinner, I hope, and afterwards we will talk. It is a
  custom with us here to have a few guests at dinner on Thursday evenings.
  Quite informal. A visitor or two; men, usually, though not always. My
  curates&mdash;both of them accomplished and interesting men; Talbot, with an
  M.A. in English Literature from Cambridge, and Simpson of Harvard: perhaps
  you recall his record mile.... How about this coming Thursday?"</p>

  <p>"Just at the moment," replied Norwood regretfully, "I am kept close in the
  evening. My little girl. I hope to make, better arrangements soon. She was at
  a good boarding-school, but she became homesick.... Sorry, sir."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't bring your little girl along, could you? How old is
  she?"</p>

  <p>"Only eight. I fear it would be an imposition."</p>

  <p>"If you only knew," declared the Dean, "how we bachelors grab at the
  chance to entertain small children in this lonely house, you would realize
  that you are conferring a great favour.... May we expect you?"</p>

  <p>"I hope it won't be a burden," said Norwood, offering his hand.</p>

  <p>Shortly after five that afternoon Sonia came in, a pleasing picture of
  radiant vitality, self-confidence, and urbanity.</p>

  <p>She paused a moment inside the door, considering Dean Harcourt with such a
  look of filial tenderness that he raised his hand to her in a welcoming
  salute, and regarded her with smiling interest as she approached his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Sonia&mdash;nobody has any business to be as happy as you are. What has
  happened to you?"</p>

  <p>"I had a message from Dean Harcourt, asking me to come and see him. Isn't
  that enough?" She unpinned a bunch of violets from her coat, laid them on the
  desk beside his hand, and seated herself in the chair opposite him. "Do tell
  me what it's all about!"</p>

  <p>"It is something you can do for me. On Thursday evening we are to have a
  few guests here. It is a custom of the house&mdash;these Thursday evening
  affairs. Most of the people who come here are in need of companionship.
  Usually they are strangers to one another. And it is not always too easy
  to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No," assisted Sonia, laughing. "I shouldn't think it would be."</p>

  <p>"And I need you&mdash;this Thursday evening."</p>

  <p>"Thanks! I'll be delighted!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;don't be too sure about that. Sometimes we contrive to gather
  up an oddly assorted lot. This time, as it happens, we are to have a
  motherless child of eight. I particularly want to devote most of my attention
  to this little girl's father. And I wondered if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So <i>that's</i> why I'm asked to your dinner!" commented Sonia,
  pretending a pout. "Just as I was having visions of myself at the Dean's
  right hand, maybe, in my new black velvet, comes an order to eat my porridge
  in the nursery along with another little girl."</p>

  <p>"I have not seen this child," said the Dean, amused. "She may be the most
  engaging little angel you ever met. It is quite possible, on the other hand,
  that she may defy your best efforts to entertain her. If she is anything like
  her father, she will probably resent baby-talk."</p>

  <p>"You mean," said Sonia, impishly wide-eyed with surprise, "her father
  doesn't talk any baby-talk at all?"</p>

  <p>"Not to me, he didn't," replied the Dean, enjoying her drollery. "There
  was a gold football on his watch-chain and I doubt if he ever painted a
  picture. Well&mdash;how about this party? Will you come?"</p>

  <p>"You know perfectly well, Dean Harcourt," she said, suddenly serious,
  "that I should be happy doing anything for you."</p>

  <p>"Very good, my friend. I must let you go now. There are many waiting, and
  I dare not detain them while I talk with a woman as little in need of
  assistance as you are. Get along with you!"</p>

  <p>She tarried at the door, seeming to have something on her mind; turned
  toward him, smiled, waited.</p>

  <p>"Sonia!" called the Dean, "would you oblige me by showing the next caller
  in?"</p>

  <p>She swiftly recrossed the room, taking off her modish little black toque
  as she came, and patting her rumpled hair.</p>

  <p>"Do you always read people's thoughts?" she asked, at the door of the
  dressing-room.</p>

  <p>"Just their better ones," the Dean replied gently.</p>

  <p>An uncommonly attractive girl, in her early twenties, arose when Sonia,
  appearing in the doorway of the reception-room, asked which of those waiting
  was next in turn.</p>

  <p>"Will you come with me?" asked Sonia graciously, leading the way into the
  adjoining room. "Sit down, please." She pointed to the sofa in the farther
  corner, and they seated themselves together there.</p>

  <p>Sonia, to whom the slightest detail of apparel was important, noted that
  the caller's clothing, expensively elegant, was not quite of the current
  mode, instantly surmising that the fair-haired girl, whose manner spoke of
  special privilege, belonged to the increasing ranks of the poor rich.</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you for a moment," began Sonia kindly, "before you see
  Dean Harcourt. Perhaps you do not know that the Dean is very hard-pressed all
  day long by people who come to him for advice. We try to shield him all we
  can. Sometimes it seems that callers have problems on their minds which could
  be dealt with by one of the curates. So&mdash;we make an effort to find out
  at least a little about it before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you do," said the girl, in a low voice. "That's quite
  right."</p>

  <p>"I knew you would understand. Is there anything you would like me to tell
  the Dean about you?"</p>

  <p>"Tell him Phyllis is here."</p>

  <p>Sonia, arriving early as she had promised, learned from Mrs. Crandall, the
  housekeeper, who showed her to an upstairs sitting-room, that there were to
  be no other women present.</p>

  <p>Conscious of her specific errand there to extend hospitality to the
  Norwood child, she considered herself a member of the Dean's <i>ménage</i>
  rather than his guest, and found the sensation decidedly pleasant. The whole
  place stood for her as a refuge and sanctuary. To be housed here even as a
  servant, she thought, would be an honour.</p>

  <p>Gifted with a natural flair for easy adjustment to circumstances&mdash;she
  enjoyed nothing so much as playing an improvised <i>rôle</i> in some
  impromptu drama&mdash;Sonia quite mystified the gentle-spirited old lady with
  the confident assurance of her movements as she put away her hat and coat and
  gave brief but competent attention to herself in the cheval glass. Mrs.
  Crandall, as they had entered the room, was on the point of saying that Miss
  Duquesne should make herself entirely at home. On further thought, this
  suggestion seemed superfluous. Indeed, Mrs. Crandall would not have been
  surprised had Miss Duquesne said as much to her.</p>

  <p>Mr. Talbot appeared in the doorway and was presented. Mr. Talbot was
  stocky, florid, round of face and sparse of hair, genial but not effusive. He
  hoped Miss Duquesne would not be so absorbed by her duty that the rest of
  them would have no chance to talk to her. It was jolly good of her to come,
  and the Dean would appreciate it mightily.</p>

  <p>Sonia liked him, liked the tender note that crept into his voice when he
  spoke of the Dean. It instantly made them kin. She envied Mr. Talbot, and
  said so with a disarming directness that lighted his pale blue eyes. It was
  evident that Mr. Talbot was accepting Sonia as 'one of us', however little
  she appeared to belong in this ecclesiastical atmosphere.</p>

  <p>There was a pleasant confusion in the hall downstairs as of arriving
  guests. Mr. Talbot excused himself. Mrs. Crandall told Sonia she might wait
  where she was, returning presently with the anticipated child, a slim,
  serious, dark-eyed little creature who, upon interrogation, unshyly replied
  that her name was Celeste, that her toes were not cold, and that the wooden
  box she had put down on the table while her coat was being tugged off
  contained playthings.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;do let me see!" exclaimed Sonia. "I wonder if they're dolls...
  why, they're tin soldiers!"</p>

  <p>"No," corrected Celeste indulgently, pouring the contents of the box out
  on the rug and kneeling before them. "Kings and queens and&mdash;such things.
  I expect you know them all." She began setting them up on their feet in a
  row.</p>

  <p>"Well, not intimately," confessed Sonia, adopting the child's serious
  attitude, "but it would be interesting to meet them."</p>

  <p>"You know her, of course," said Celeste, beginning with an easy one.
  "Queen Elizabeth, with the tiara on her head."</p>

  <p>"And the tyre around her neck," assisted Sonia, straight-faced, exploring
  her small guest's capacity for humour.</p>

  <p>"That's a ruff," Celeste explained, politely repressing a grin.</p>

  <p>"I'll wager it was," said Sonia sympathetically. "It looks very
  uncomfortable."</p>

  <p>Celeste laughed merrily.</p>

  <p>"You're funny," she said, without looking up. "This is Charles I. His hat
  comes off."</p>

  <p>"I thought his head came off, too." Sonia had joined Celeste on the rug.
  They looked into each other's eyes, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" inquired Celeste irrelevantly, stroking the velvet
  sleeve softly with her finger-tips.</p>

  <p>"Sonia."</p>

  <p>"Miss Sonia?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;just Sonia."</p>

  <p>"Is Mrs.&mdash;the lady&mdash;your mother?"</p>

  <p>"No, dear. I don't live here. I am a guest, same as you."</p>

  <p>"May I sit by you at dinner?"</p>

  <p>Sonia picked up the cool little hand and rubbed the back of it against her
  cheek. "Yes, dear."</p>

  <p>"And will you play with me&mdash;afterwards? Or do you have to talk?"</p>

  <p>"Dean Harcourt will be joining us in a few minutes," Talbot was explaining
  cordially. "He asked me to keep you company until he comes down. You are
  aware, I presume, that the Dean does not get about easily. The lift was an
  afterthought in this house, and the only place it could be installed on this
  level was in the dining-room, so we always meet the Dean there when he comes
  down from his living-quarters."</p>

  <p>"I knew Dean Harcourt was crippled," said Norwood. "I never learned the
  extent of it, or how he came by it. An accident?"</p>

  <p>"It is an interesting story," replied the curate. "For a full appreciation
  of the Dean, one ought to know it. When Dean Harcourt was thirty-three, he
  was stricken with infantile paralysis. For three years he had been the curate
  in a suburban parish, and had just been appointed its rector. He was already
  winning considerable attention as a brilliant speaker, and it was expected
  that he might become in time one of the great pulpit prophets. Aware of his
  gifts in that field, he was earnestly ambitious to develop. Life held out
  welcoming hands to him. He was very successful. His engagement had been
  announced to a beautiful young woman of distinguished social standing.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;like a storm out of a clear sky, came this tragic thing that
  struck him down. He spent ten months in bed, utterly helpless from his
  hips."</p>

  <p>Norwood winced, and coloured slightly. "I have been with him now for more
  than six years," continued Talbot, "and in that time he has spoken to me but
  once of that period he spent on his back. That was in reference to the joy he
  had felt when he discovered that he could wiggle his big toe. What he must
  have gone through, in mental torture, nobody has ever been informed, so far
  as I know. He may have told the Bishop."</p>

  <p>"I wish I had known that," said Norwood, "when I talked with him the other
  day. I went to him very much upset over a little predicament of mine,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, the Dean doesn't want any sympathy&mdash;if that's what worries you.
  But I can assure you there isn't anything you are likely to tell him about
  yourself that can match the troubles he experienced through those days....
  His fiancée decided, quite naturally, I presume, that matrimony was out of
  the question, and he cheerfully released her without any bitterness. His
  church was obliged to call another priest to take his place when it had
  become obvious that he could not carry on with his work. In short, his career
  collapsed.</p>

  <p>"After an almost endless convalescence, he was able to sit at a desk.
  Eager to give him some little thing to do, the Bishop had him brought down,
  two days a week, to assist with his office interviews. After a while it
  became apparent that he was singularly equipped to deal with a wide variety
  of difficult cases requiring an understanding sympathy. The word began to
  spread. He sat there, day after day, building up a reputation probably unlike
  that of any other man in our profession, and when it was suggested that he be
  made the Dean of the Cathedral, everybody hailed the choice with enthusiasm.
  He carries a heavy load. We often wonder how he does it. It would probably
  have killed a normal man long since."</p>

  <p>Norwood was spared the necessity of comment by the announcement that
  dinner was served. The Dean was already in his chair at the head of the table
  when they arrived in the dining-room. The others were there. Celeste detached
  herself from her new friend, at the sight of her father, and drew him by the
  hand while he was receiving an introduction to Simpson.</p>

  <p>"Sonia," she said, indifferent to the interested group that had been
  brought to attention by her childish treble, "this is my daddy." And then
  added, with ice-breaking <i>naïveté, "</i>Daddy&mdash;she's wonderful!"</p>

  <p>"So you found that out, too!" called the Dean. "I want you to sit by me,
  little fellow."</p>

  <p>"And Sonia next?" insisted Celeste. "And Daddy there?"</p>

  <p>"That will be a very good arrangement," said Mrs. Crandall, amused.</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt spoke a brief grace, Celeste regarding the unfamiliar rite
  with baffled eyes.</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" she inquired confidentially, but quite audibly, in the
  momentary hush that followed the Dean's words.</p>

  <p>"I thanked God for our food," he replied, making a greater effort to be
  sober than either of his curates could recall of him.</p>

  <p>Celeste glanced over the table appraisingly and returned her eyes to
  his.</p>

  <p>"There'll be some here, presently," he assured her.</p>

  <p>"Do you always do that?" pressed Celeste respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Always."</p>

  <p>Sonia had begun to feel that somebody had better declare it a closed
  incident pretty soon, but disliked to take the risk of offending the child.
  Norwood's dress collar was fitting too snugly. Simpson and Talbot, he
  observed, were enjoying the episode with shining eyes.</p>

  <p>"Even when there's nothing," persevered Celeste, "but a glass of milk and
  a cooky?"</p>

  <p>This proved too much for everybody, including the Dean, and Celeste,
  suddenly suspecting that she was stealing the show, remembered a recent
  parental injunction strongly bearing on this matter, and blinkingly consulted
  her father's glowing face for counsel.</p>

  <p>"Mushroom soup," whispered Sonia, "just as we had hoped."</p>

  <p>Norwood, relieved, addressed himself to Mrs. Crandall, but remained quite
  conscious of Sonia, who with tender tact had caught up his own flesh and
  blood on the brink of a social disaster. He warmed toward her, and wondered
  what manner of person she was. Sonia instinctively sensed his interest. The
  party was too small to encourage group conversations, and they had almost
  nothing to say directly to each other, but on the few occasions when Sonia
  ventured a remark to him, she found Norwood quickly attentive and apparently
  eager to draw her out.</p>

  <p>"Celeste has been showing me her gallery of immortals," remarked Sonia. "I
  wondered if this wouldn't be a good way to teach history in college."</p>

  <p>"A novelty, at least," replied Norwood, interested in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You could have a stage, and move them about."</p>

  <p>"Like chess-men," he assisted.</p>

  <p>"Why not? One often hears of the chess-board of history," reflected Sonia,
  hoping the stream she had ventured into was safe for wading.</p>

  <p>Catching Dean Harcourt's questing eye, Norwood drew him in by explaining
  briefly, Sonia illumining the talk with a fragment of the discussion she had
  had with Celeste about the unfortunate Charles Stuart.</p>

  <p>"It's a useful idea, Dr. Norwood," observed the Dean. "You could rig up a
  working model of a dynastic machine shop operating during the reign of
  Charles, for example, showing George Villiers in the jaws of a lathe being
  turned into the Duke of Buckingham, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And Wentworth being turned into the Earl of Strafford," supplied Norwood,
  pleased with the game. "Not a bad idea, at all."</p>

  <p>Sonia, mindful of her trust, smilingly retreated from this cryptic
  conversation to assist Celeste with her lamb chop, Norwood wondering how
  closely she had been able to follow. To his delight, she returned to say,
  "And the whole Cromwell outfit being turned from tavern-keepers into puffy
  land-holders."</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" approved the Dean. "Now we really are getting somewhere. You
  could show the Cromwells leaving their pubs for mansions. Ah, but what a boon
  the Reformation was for the brand-new lords who divided among themselves the
  land stolen from the monasteries. But it was hard on the nation. The machine
  made a great many nobodies, like the Cromwells, suddenly dangerous."</p>

  <p>Norwood was so happily surprised at this self-disclosure of the old
  churchman's unprejudiced breadth that his amazement showed in his face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I'm a Protestant," the Dean hastened to add, "but that does
  not blind me to the facts. Had there been no property involved in the
  Reformation in England, it would have been a far different affair. But the
  same thing is true of all the religious wars, don't you think, Dr. Norwood?
  The common people were always informed that their holy war was led by men of
  consecration to a righteous cause; most of them never lived long enough to
  find out that they had been led by men bent on the confiscation of
  property."</p>

  <p>"Will there be room in the historical machine shop for all that?" inquired
  Sonia, dividing her question between Norwood and their host.</p>

  <p>"I'll undertake to answer for him," said the Dean. "There's always more
  room in the modern history class for an elucidation of that sickening fact
  than the picture of honestly brave men throwing their lives away under the
  impression that they were obeying the divine will of the Lord."</p>

  <p>"Logically, then," put in Talbot, "it probably wasn't the will of the Lord
  that there should have been a Reformation, at all, and in that case
  Protestantism is a mistake&mdash;and Trinity Cathedral is a mistake!"</p>

  <p>"There you are," said the Dean, directing himself toward the professor,
  almost as if they were alone. "That brings us back to the thing we were
  talking about the other day, Norwood. You and I know exactly how we got our
  Protestantism. But however we came by it, here it is! And whatever
  is&mdash;in the long run&mdash;is right! You can depend on that! Here, too,
  is Catholicism&mdash;stronger than ever. By the same token, it, too, is
  right!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," suggested Sonia, when the Dean's eyes had drifted to her,
  "perhaps these common men who sincerely fought for their respective creeds
  weren't so very far wrong, then, in the light of history, when they thought
  they were doing God's will. Maybe it <i>was</i> God's will!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Wouldn't</i> that be funny!" chuckled Celeste, feeling that she had
  been left beached long enough. Simpson, also an innocent bystander, led the
  laughter in which Celeste tardily but hilariously joined when the general
  appreciation of her witticism had moved her to regard it a better thing than
  she had suspected.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Crandall observed that it was a pity the great and solemn
  ecclesiastical conventions couldn't be attended by a few little folks like
  Celeste who might clear the fog with an occasional comment; then the party
  adjourned, Talbot and Simpson excusing themselves, the ladies returning to
  the upstairs sitting-room, Norwood wheeling the Dean into a quiet corner of
  the living-room. It gave him a feeling of tenderness.</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt plunged at once into a series of questions. Did Dr. Norwood
  believe in a 'planned universe'?</p>

  <p>"It certainly seems so, sometimes," Dr. Norwood heard himself saying, not
  quite sure whether his reply had been dictated by courtesy, conviction, or
  confusion.</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;if it was planned at all, what proportion of its phenomenal
  activity, in the opinion of Dr. Norwood, was directed, and how much of it was
  'on the loose'? Take a devastating pestilence, for example: was that put on
  for the purpose of pruning a superabundant or undesirable population; or was
  it just the natural recompense of filthy living?</p>

  <p>"The latter, more likely," guessed Dr. Norwood, adding, "though I make no
  pretence to be an authority on sociology&mdash;or pathology, either."</p>

  <p>"How about a costly forest fire, touched off by lightning: would you
  consider that accidental or ordained?"</p>

  <p>"I am not a theologian, sir," parried Norwood, pleased that he had found
  temporary shelter.</p>

  <p>"Granted. You are not a sociologist, biologist, or theologian. You are an
  historian. Now&mdash;when the monarchies began to cave in, was that
  attributable to a widespread epidemic of democracy, or did it indicate that
  the monarchical system had, for the time at least, served its purpose? And
  now that the democracies are giving it up, in favour of dictatorships, does
  that mean that the monarchical system was right, all the while, and that the
  effort to democratize was a mistake?"</p>

  <p>"But it hasn't been proved that we ever had any democracies. What we have
  called democracies were oligarchies."</p>

  <p>"But the private citizen has had the right to vote for the kind of
  government he prefers. Isn't that true?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite," objected Norwood. "He has been permitted to choose which of
  two or three oligarchies he would consider the least insufferable."</p>

  <p>"Then democracy hasn't really failed, seeing that we've never tried
  it."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it's the oligarchy that has failed," said Norwood.</p>

  <p>"Would you call it a failure," queried the Dean thoughtfully, "or might it
  be more correct to say that the oligarchy had been brought on to dispose of
  the abuses of despotism? If the latter, it was not a failure but a phase of
  political progress. Does the present clamour for dictators indicate that the
  social order is at its best under absolute monarchies? Dr. Norwood, do you
  believe that 'whatever is, is right'&mdash;in the long run?... <i>I</i>
  do!"</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure about that."</p>

  <p>"Then you'll have to give up your idea of 'a planned universe.'"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;that won't be hard to do. I'm not sure of that, either."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what becomes of history, then? Doesn't it lose all its
  significance?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say, sir," asked Norwood seriously, "that you interpret
  every social, political, and economic movement as a response to a predestined
  arrangement? The bloody revolutions, for example: not a very happy
  arrangement for the people who experienced them, surely."</p>

  <p>"No," said the Dean, "but they were a phase of human progress; and, as I
  said to you the other day, 'the ship is more important than the crew.' You
  and I both know that this is true, in our own experience; don't we?" His
  voice had lowered to a note of comradeship.</p>

  <p>Norwood, with the story of the Dean's vicissitudes fresh in his mind, felt
  a bond of mutual interest between them. At the moment, his own problems
  seemed of negligible concern. Was it Dean Harcourt's philosophy that had done
  it, or had his own difficulties been driven into the shadow by a new
  interest?... Who was this Sonia Duquesne?</p>

  <p>They left shortly before ten, for Celeste must be put to bed. Sonia,
  attractively attired for the street, brought the child down, and asked Mrs.
  Crandall if she might telephone for a taxi.</p>

  <p>"Can't we take Sonia home, Daddy?" entreated Celeste.</p>

  <p>Sonia mildly protested, but consented when Norwood's invitation was
  pressed.</p>

  <p>After the hall door had been closed on them, Mrs. Crandall returned to the
  living-room where the Dean sat, alone, lost in his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Odd little elf, that Celeste," remarked Mrs. Crandall.</p>

  <p>"Yes; isn't she?" smiled the Dean absently.</p>

  <p>"And you're an old match-maker."</p>

  <p>"Not this time."</p>

  <p>"He was very much charmed."</p>

  <p>"It takes two. And Sonia wasn't intended for the faculty of a university.
  Perhaps Celeste will attend to it, but I doubt it. However&mdash;Norwood
  needs something new to worry about. A good cure for trouble is a little more.
  It's on the principle of a serum."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!" said Mrs. Crandall. "And it's your bedtime."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Colonel Livingstone Brock was ceremoniously laid away,
  one dripping April afternoon in 1911, with his militant grey imperial stiffly
  waxed and the bluish-white fingers of his renowned right hand thrust between
  the first and second buttons of his worn Prince Albert, it was editorially
  observed by the <i>Courier-Journal</i> that the regrettable departure of this
  beloved citizen of Leeds marked the close of a picturesque era in forensic
  oratory.</p>

  <p>For sixteen consecutive years no debatable measure had been acted upon by
  the State Legislature without the benefit of Colonel Brock's expressed
  opinion. Not always were his views or his vote predictable. Although by
  disposition and training a conservative, it not infrequently occurred that a
  passionately eloquent plea from some gallant old spell-binder of his own
  political faith would bring the Colonel to his feet; whereupon, to the
  surprise of nobody more than its beleaguered defenders, this tall,
  straight-backed senator from Leeds would come valiantly to the rescue of the
  embattled cause, for sheer love of skilful argument, the felicitous phrase,
  and the rounded period.</p>

  <p>"No matter what was the nature of the resolution," continued Mr. Trumbull,
  who had been reciting this story for the delectation of a newly arrived guest
  at the Mansion, as they smoked after supper on the spacious veranda, "it made
  no difference how insignificant it was, the Colonel's peroration always
  called upon high heaven to witness and hallow his imperishable hope that the
  fair name of the great State of Kentucky might remain forever unsullied as
  the driven snow on inaccessible Alpine crags, sacred as the love of a mother
  for the sleeping babe at her breast, and dependable as the everlasting
  stars."</p>

  <p>"And then," suggested the urbane stranger, whom the local attorney was
  beginning to like immensely, "the Colonel probably retired to cool himself
  off with a mint julep."</p>

  <p>"Precisely!" agreed Mr. Trumbull, delighted that Providence had sent him
  someone capable of appreciating his ponderous drollery.
  "Precisely!&mdash;accompanied by the spokesman for the opposition."</p>

  <p>"Who no doubt paid for the drinks," added the handsome visitor
  encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Precisely! I see you're getting an accurate picture of the old Colonel,
  which is necessary to an understanding of this house and our
  landlord&mdash;and the town, too, for that matter."</p>

  <p>The lean-faced, middle-aged bachelor pounded out his pipe in the rail of
  the veranda, filled it with fine-cut, draped a long, shabby leg over the
  squeaking arm of the disintegrating wicker chair, munched reminiscently, and
  grinned. It had been a great while since he had reviewed the Brock saga, and
  never had he told it to anyone so prompt to savour the piquant flavour of his
  ironical wit and to view with quick understanding the pastel nuances of
  straight-faced pleasantries. Mr. Trumbull was at peace with the world. This
  quiet-voiced Yankee in the adjoining chair was one of the most charming
  personalities he had ever met. Moreover, the supper had been unusually good,
  befitting the arrival of a new guest whom the Mansion hoped to impress
  favourably. The low afternoon sun, unseasonably warm for late November,
  comforted his spirit.</p>

  <p>"And generally," he went on, chuckling drily, "the Colonel's speech would
  put it over, too.... The first time I ever heard him make it, I was just a
  young smart aleck, fresh from law school. It was on a bill to reimburse some
  poor devil of a farmer four dollars and fifty cents for a couple of shoats
  that had drowned in a pond on state property. I knew it was funny, but I
  didn't laugh&mdash;not while it was going on."</p>

  <p>"Was there snow in the Alps that time, too?" wondered the good-natured
  stranger.</p>

  <p>"Precisely&mdash;and the Morning Stars sang together."</p>

  <p>"How about the shoats?"</p>

  <p>"You'd make a good lawyer, Mr.&mdash;your name is Parker, isn't it? I
  noticed it on the register. Mine is Trumbull&mdash;Jefferson D. Trumbull."
  They rose and shook hands, reseated themselves, and Mr. Trumbull continued.
  "The shoats were paid for by the great State of Kentucky, and if the Colonel
  had gone on for another five minutes, there would have been a really fine
  bronze tablet put up in their memory."</p>

  <p>"And our Mr. Brock," queried the interested stranger, "was he the
  Colonel's sole heir?"</p>

  <p>"Well," hesitated Mr. Trumbull, screwing up his face judicially, "perhaps
  'heir' isn't just the word we're looking for. Clay was the Colonel's sole
  survivor&mdash;if that's what you mean. And he did inherit the old man's
  childlike indifference to the practical things of this world, such as monthly
  bills and notes payable. Clay's other legacy was this fine old house, which
  has been gradually falling to pieces for many years.</p>

  <p>"I dare say it is a fine thing," he rumbled on, taking elaborate pains to
  be serious, "for a municipality to be distinguished for something unique.
  Take Leadville, Colorado. Highest altitude. People like to go there so they
  can write a postcard to the folks from the highest town in the land. And
  there is a little place over here in Indiana that claims to be the exact
  centre of U.S. population. You take New York: they've got something that sets
  them apart. The lions out in front of the Public Library have longer tails
  than any other lions in this country.... Now I want to tell you something
  distinctive about Leeds. Maybe you don't know that this old house&mdash;right
  where we're sitting&mdash;has, in proportion to its assessed value, the
  biggest mortgage on it of any hotel property in the whole world!"</p>

  <p>"I fancy there's quite a brisk competition, too," commented Mr. Parker.
  "Is that why they don't paint it?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely! The mortgage covers it from the shingles to the ground. This
  happens to be fresh in my mind just now, because&mdash;" Mr. Trumbull glanced
  over his shoulder, took stock of the open windows, and lowered his voice
  confidentially&mdash;"because I am Clay Brock's attorney and the interest
  will be due again a week from to-morrow. I don't know of any stated event
  that comes around faster than these dates for Brock's mortgage interest. It's
  a good deal like Mr. Rockefeller's birthday; seems to have one every few
  weeks."</p>

  <p>"Hard up, is he? Mr. Brock&mdash;I mean."</p>

  <p>"Hard <i>up!...</i> I don't know the exact value of that phrase up North
  where you come from, but down here in this country when we say a man's hard
  up, we merely mean that he's broke. Clay's dropped out of that class. The
  Colonel had dropped out of it before Clay was born&mdash;forty-five years
  ago.... By the way&mdash;though I reckon it's none of my business&mdash;are
  you planning to stop off here at the Mansion for a spell? I hope you are, if
  you don't mind my saying so."</p>

  <p>"It is quite possible&mdash;thank you. I rather like the old place."</p>

  <p>"In that case, I want to tell you something. Clay Brock&mdash;God bless
  him&mdash;is a great hand to borrow ten dollars until Saturday. I'm sure I
  don't know what bright promise Saturday holds out to him above the other days
  of the week. I reckon he just selected Saturday as a day when he would pay
  his debts if he had the money; and he <i>would, too!"</i> Mr. Trumbull's
  loyalty to his landlord-client was almost belligerent. "He's a fine fellow!
  No, <i>sir!</i> There's nothing wrong with Clay Brock except that he was
  brought up in this expensive house to believe that he would be looked after
  by the Lord God of Hosts."</p>

  <p>"Maybe that's why he went into the hotel business," ventured the amiable
  Parker, gravely.</p>

  <p>The seedy lawyer permitted himself to laugh aloud, disclosing the need of
  much dental attention; then, suddenly sobering, he looked about, furtively,
  and in a subdued tone advised, "You want to be careful with remarks like that
  in Leeds. We take the Lord mighty serious down here."</p>

  <p>"Don't you suppose He has a sense of humour?"</p>

  <p>"Umm&mdash;perhaps. But I don't think the local brethren play it up much.
  Be that as it may, I've often wondered if Clay Brock isn't being cared for by
  the angels. For seven years I have lived under this leaky roof. The Brocks
  managed to get along somehow. There's always enough to eat. And you'll find
  Clara Brock to be one of the finest women you ever saw! Now, I wouldn't leave
  you under the impression that Clay isn't respected. Why, he has been the
  mayor of Leeds for years.... See that traffic light out there on the corner?
  He had that put up&mdash;just to give Leeds an air."</p>

  <p>"I'm rather glad he did," declared the whimsical Parker. "It really
  accounts for our being here. We were headed in the general direction of New
  Orleans, but in no great hurry. Sort of a vacation trip. The St.
  Louis-to-Nashville bus came to a stop at that light, and while it
  waited&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And it waits a long time," interposed Mr. Trumbull, grinning. "That's to
  let the heavy cross-town traffic through. I reckon you noticed the
  congestion."</p>

  <p>Mr. Parker, with half-closed eyes, took a long, deep inhalation from his
  cigarette before offering the playful rejoinder which he knew was expected.
  In that brief, painful pause, his thoughts were running riot. How
  transparently clear it was that this shabby, disappointed country lawyer,
  whom Life had shunted on to this grass-grown siding, hoped to win an hour of
  friendly attention with his droll persiflage. Destiny hadn't even been decent
  enough to Jefferson D. Trumbull to hand him a tragedy loaded with agony.
  Once&mdash;when he was that young "smart-aleck just out of law
  school"&mdash;Trumbull had hugged the idea of a brilliant career; had sat in
  the gallery of the State Legislature looking down on the shining bald heads
  and leonine shocks of white hair, saying to himself, "I shall sit there, some
  day!" And Life had elbowed him out to little Leeds.</p>

  <p>It suddenly occurred to Parker that the world must be fairly well stocked
  with brittle old chaps like Trumbull who sat on unpainted country hotel
  verandas of an evening, ironically spoofing their defeat to the tune of the
  frogs and the crickets. Once, doubtless, Trumbull had been in a grand state
  of impatience; then the impatience had mounted to desperation; then the
  desperation had burned out, leaving the grey ashes of resignation. Now he had
  reached the point where&mdash;lacking even a great tragedy to remember in the
  afternoon of his life&mdash;he was willing to call his pitiful little show a
  comedy!</p>

  <p>"God!" thought Parker, closing his eyes against the smarting smoke, "will
  I ever sink to the point where I can joke about it to a stranger?"</p>

  <p>Pulling himself together with an effort, he grinned and met Jefferson D.
  Trumbull on the ground he had staked off. "No; my attention was too absorbed
  by this beautiful old house; these tall white columns, the rambling
  second-floor veranda, the shady lawn. I thought it might be pleasant if we
  got off here for a few days. We're not travelling on a very rigid
  schedule."</p>

  <p>"We?" repeated Mr. Trumbull curiously. "Somebody with you? I saw only one
  name in the book."</p>

  <p>"I never register for her," explained Parker, motioning with his head
  toward his companion, who, suspecting an introduction was impending, rose
  from her contented sprawl in the corner and sauntered toward them.</p>

  <p>"Is that <i>your</i> dog? I was meaning to ask somebody how she got here.
  Didn't recognize her, and I know most of the really good dogs in this
  town.... Come here, sister; what's your name?" The shaggy-haired lawyer
  glanced up inquiringly, and her owner supplied the information.</p>

  <p>"What?... Well, if that isn't a hell of a name for a dog," drawled Mr.
  Trumbull, stroking the long, silky ears. "We'll have to take you out into the
  country and show you some partridge&mdash;Sylvia."</p>

  <p>A week had passed&mdash;with surprising swiftness, too, for an idle man
  who had been long accustomed to a crowded programme of exacting duties. Leeds
  accepted him for what he seemed to be&mdash;a quiet, genteel, young man of
  leisure. Sylvia, forever at his heels, disarmed whatever suspicion might have
  disturbed the mind of the dog-loving public in respect to the stranger.</p>

  <p>He had written 'Nathan Parker' on a blank page at the Mansion with an
  unhesitating hand, for it was not the first time he had registered that way.
  The name had been adopted a month ago without much premeditation beyond a
  feeling that it would be convenient if the initials of his alias agreed with
  the monogram on a silver cigarette-case which was about all he had left now,
  besides Sylvia, to remind him of the life he had abandoned.</p>

  <p>Sometimes he had been amazed at the ease and rapidity of his
  self-adjustment to his new identity, responding automatically when addressed
  as "Mr. Parker". He wondered whether it would come as a shock if someone ever
  ventured to call him "Nathan," but that was unlikely. Pains would be taken to
  see that nobody entered quite that fully into his confidence.</p>

  <p>It pleased Nathan Parker that the Mansion Hotel had shown no signs of
  being actively inquisitive about him. Mr. Brock, who had not been about when
  he arrived, had come up to his huge, shabby, high-ceilinged, second-floor
  room at nine that first night, to inquire whether he was comfortable. He had
  tarried for a half-hour, seated on the bed&mdash;what time he was not
  journeying dignifiedly to and from an impressive brass cuspidor, hard-by the
  antique walnut desk&mdash;genially offering comments on his town of Leeds, of
  which he spoke with proprietorial pride and an affection implied by his tone
  rather than his words. Mr. Brock seemed to feel that the visitor from afar
  should be much interested in the fact that you could drive from here into
  Illinois or Missouri or Tennessee "in two hours; an hour and a half&mdash;if
  you step on it." Mr. Brock, himself, had nothing to "step on" but his own two
  feet.</p>

  <p>As for Mr. Parker's relation to other natural phenomena, the improvident,
  lovable son of the famed Colonel Brock exhibited no outward concern. Perhaps
  this attitude did not guarantee a total want of interest. Indeed, reflected
  the vagabond, it might indicate a conviction on Brock's part that his guest
  had something to conceal, and therefore might be disconcerted by cordial
  questions which under any other circumstances would have been considered in
  good taste.</p>

  <p>Young Clay, obviously unhappy and restless at twenty-two, had been for two
  or three days teetering on the edge of a decision to scrape acquaintance,
  Parker observed with considerable gratification. The boy was tall, slim,
  serious, almost sullen; though whether his gloomy reticence was
  temperamental, or explained by the fact that his clothing was shabby and his
  menial tasks distasteful, was difficult for a stranger to determine. He would
  let the youth attend to the overtures of whatever friendship they might have
  when he got around to it.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brock, supervising the whole establishment, was by instinct clearly a
  lady; by background too, no doubt, for her father, the venerable Dr. Graham,
  who lived three blocks down the shady street, was, according to Mr. Trumbull,
  one of the most important men in the community. Willing to talk&mdash;for she
  had begun to manifest something like solicitude for the lonesome fellow who
  strolled all day with his dog and retired early to read&mdash;Clara Brock had
  spoken of her father and of Elise, his granddaughter, who lived with him. It
  was apparent that she took a great deal of pride in the girl.</p>

  <p>"Elise has a voice," she confided, one evening, as they sat on the
  veranda. "I don't mean that she just sings a little better than the other
  girls in the church choir. She has a great voice, and it's a pity she can't
  do anything about it. Father sent her to Louisville for three winters, but
  times are going to be too bad this season. And Father isn't so strong any
  more. Seventy-three. He'll have to stop some day soon. We all think it is a
  shame that he has to make those long trips; all kinds of weather and terrible
  roads off the main highways in the winter. But I reckon you understand how it
  is: when a man's been doctoring in one place for forty-two years, it's
  impossible for anybody either to come into the world or go out of it unless
  Father's present. So&mdash;he's breaking, and mustn't try to do any more for
  Elise. It's hard on poor Clay, too, for his grandpa had hoped he would be
  able to help him when the time came."</p>

  <p>Parker murmured his polite regret that the young lady was unable to finish
  her voice training.</p>

  <p>"The trouble is, Elise hasn't anyone to give her an introduction to the
  sort of people she ought to know if she's ever to make anything out of her
  music. It takes money to put on a recital in such a way that she could get a
  little attention. Of course&mdash;I reckon it's natural for a
  mother&mdash;I'm even more worried about Clay. How that poor child has
  worked, these past four years, putting himself through the State
  University&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is that true?" Parker queried with surprise. "I had no idea he was a
  university graduate; seems so young for that," he added quickly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know he doesn't look much like it, around here, helping in the
  kitchen and doing all manner of odd jobs. He had so wanted to follow in his
  grandpa's footsteps. I'm sure I don't know what we're ever going to do with
  him. It's just breaking his spirit. I can see it&mdash;a little more every
  day."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brock rocked gently, thoughtfully, for a moment, and returned to
  Elise.</p>

  <p>"She's kept pretty busy now, what with that big house on her hands, and
  the telephone, and the dispensary patients&mdash;Father has his dispensary
  right there where you can't get away from it, day or night&mdash;and meals at
  all hours. You wouldn't believe what a trial it is to have a busy doctor in
  your family. Can't plan anything an hour ahead&mdash;not even your supper.
  So&mdash;we don't see Elise very often, unless we go over there. I don't
  believe she has been here for a month.... Well&mdash;I must see what's going
  on in the kitchen. Excuse me for bothering you with our family worries. I
  don't often talk to people about them."</p>

  <p>Parker said he appreciated her confidence.</p>

  <p>"But I reckon," she observed, with a pensive little smile, as she took her
  leave, "everybody has his troubles."</p>

  <p>"I dare say," agreed Parker, resuming his book.</p>

  <p>The next afternoon Elise had come to see her Aunt Clara. Parker had been
  out for a ramble that had taken him through the town, past the little huddle
  of shops&mdash;Brinkley's Harness and Saddles, with the not unpleasant tang
  of good leather in the air about the open door; a chain grocery store, whose
  gaudy front made its neighbours drab; a men's clothing store, with the wax
  dummy of a wide-eyed, pink-cheeked, stiffly smirking boulevardier dressed in
  a tight, fawn-coloured suit ticketed at sixteen dollars seventy-five, and a
  large pile of rough overalls which the saunterer thought he would prefer to
  the suit in case he was required to fit himself out there; Tanner's Drug
  Store, a versatile institution with an uncommonly sloppy soda fountain just
  inside the entrance and a battered lending-library at the rear. On the corner
  was Vaughn's more impressive establishment&mdash;a shining plough in one
  window and assorted tools in the other. Across the street, Sizer's Department
  Store, a rubbish clutter of cheap merchandise, and the First National Bank,
  resembling a mausoleum, held down the corners.</p>

  <p>Then there was the Post Office with a worn and splintered doorsill, oiled
  floor, and dingy rows of boxes; Miller's Feed Store with a tin incubator and
  some meal-bags in the window; Hawkins's Meat Shop, a pair of gilded horns
  over the entrance; a ridiculous little millinery establishment with a display
  of a dozen hopeless hats priced from a dollar to two-ninety.</p>

  <p>This brought you to a petrol station, occupying a great deal of room on
  the corner, and beyond that was the High School, after which you came to some
  very good residences. The brown house, with diamond-shaped panes in what were
  probably the library windows, was Dr. Graham's. A small office jutted from
  the south wing. The little car, out in front, had seen better days. Perhaps
  it belonged to the doctor. It sat there with an air of accustomedness.</p>

  <p>The stroller had turned, at that point, to retrace his steps, Sylvia, as
  usual, winning many a pleasant smile. Parker was glad now that Sylvia had
  insisted on coming along out of that other life, realizing that his present
  unstable relation to the normal scheme of things would be insupportable
  without the company of his dog.</p>

  <p>Frequently men bade Parker the time of day as he passed them, remembering
  that they had seen him in the street before. He assumed that they remembered
  Sylvia, and, as an afterthought, recalled that there had been a tall man, of
  thirty or thereabouts, striding along in her company.</p>

  <p>It set him browsing on the subject of the animal's relation to the
  so-called social order. Not that Sylvia was an animal, of course. The English
  language was distinguished by a few blind spots. Things had to be either
  mineral, vegetable, or animal. In this purely academic respect Sylvia was an
  animal because she was not a mineral or a vegetable. So was he himself, for
  that matter. He and Sylvia belonged to the same 'kingdom'. And men in the
  street said "Howdy" to him because Sylvia apparently admitted herself to be
  his property. All that being true, wasn't it more correct to say that he was
  Sylvia's property? In the opinion of the universe, at present, Sylvia was the
  more important of the two.</p>

  <p>He stopped in at Tanner's Drug Store and purchased a tin of flea powder.
  Mr. Tanner himself made the sale.</p>

  <p>"Even good dogs have fleas," observed Mr. Tanner, pleasantly making talk
  with the newcomer.</p>

  <p>Parker thought diligently about that for the remainder of the stroll back
  to the Mansion. Somehow Sylvia's importance seemed to dignify fleas.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Brock and Elise were talking earnestly in the hall when he entered
  the hotel. Elise's Aunt Clara could easily have presented him, but she had
  merely acknowledged his presence with a polite smile. He interpreted it to
  mean that Clara Brock, while cheerfully willing as his hostess to extend the
  amenities due a guest in her house&mdash;even to the point of impulsively
  discussing her own anxieties&mdash;felt under no compulsion to back him
  socially. This, thought Parker, showed her good breeding and common
  sense.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the little episode was disquieting. He was forced to admit
  to himself that his equivocal position in this house would presently demand
  clarification. He must either be on his way or give a satisfactory reason for
  remaining. A depressing sensation of loneliness swept him as he ascended to
  his room. For a long time he sat before the window revolving the problem that
  had been troubling him for a month. Perhaps if he ordered some books and
  pretended to be pursuing a specific course of study, his occupation would be
  considered valid. But&mdash;what kind of books? He had picked up a little
  volume, <i>en route,</i> on <i>The Choice of a Vocation.</i> Doubtless there
  was plenty of literature to be had on that. He would write to Chicago for
  information. The decision cheered him.</p>

  <p>Elise was walking down the street now, on her way home. Doubtless, he
  reflected, his undeniable interest in her could be accounted for mostly by
  the fact that he had not been permitted to make her acquaintance. Had Clara
  Brock introduced them to each other, his curiosity about the girl would
  probably have been satisfied. As the matter stood, he found himself possessed
  of a desire to meet her.</p>

  <p>In his one brief glance at close range, he had noted that Elise was a
  comely brunette, a little better dressed than most of the young women he had
  seen in the street; had observed also that her impersonal survey of him,
  without the slightest trace of shyness, hinted a wider social experience than
  Leeds would be likely to afford. He wondered how much she fretted here,
  imagining he had read discontent in the moody brown eyes.</p>

  <p>Next day Elise again had some occasion to visit her Aunt Clara. Parker had
  passed her on the front steps as she was arriving. Their eyes admitted, this
  time, the existence of each other, at least; but she did not speak, nor, of
  course, did he.</p>

  <p>That evening, young Clay tapped on the door. Upon being invited in, he
  said, with some embarrassment, "I was putting in a new light bulb, this
  morning, and noticed that book." He pointed to the little volume on
  vocational problems. "When you are through with it, sir, would you let me
  read it?"</p>

  <p>"Sit down, won't you?" said Parker cordially. "You may have the book at
  once, if you like. I have finished it. And I am rather glad you are
  interested, for I am making a little study of the question. There will be
  quite a sizable library on this subject shipped to me within a few days. You
  will be welcome to read these books when they come. You're casting about for
  something to do, I suppose. Want to talk about it?"</p>

  <p>"I mustn't pester you with my problems, Mr. Parker. And there's nothing
  unusual or interesting about my case. I finished college in June. Worked my
  way through, with a little help from my grandfather."</p>

  <p>"What was your major?"</p>

  <p>"Pre-medic, sir. That's all I've ever had any interest in. But I can't
  make a go of it in a medical school and work for my living; do you
  think?"</p>

  <p>Parker shook his head and replied that he had always understood a medical
  course demanded very close application to one's studies.</p>

  <p>"So," continued Clay, with a hopeless little shrug, "I reckon I'll have to
  give that up. But&mdash;I don't see how I can stay here&mdash;not much
  longer."</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not," Parker reluctantly admitted, after a considerable
  pause during which he sat preoccupiedly stroking the backs of his fingers
  after the manner of one rubbing on a pair of snug-fitting gloves, an odd
  little trick he was apt to fall into when thinking with complete absorption.
  "There wouldn't be much chance for you here, I'm afraid.... It is sometimes
  very difficult to decide just what one ought to do with one's life."</p>

  <p>As he glanced up to meet Clay's eyes, Parker was conscious of the boy's
  intense interest in this platitude, and wondered whether he was suspecting
  the nature of the need that had inspired it. The silence lengthened as each
  speculated on the other's thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," said Clay, rising.</p>

  <p>"We'll be talking about it again, I hope." Parker tried to sound
  optimistic. "Something will open up. Meantime&mdash;don't be discouraged,
  and&mdash;I wish you the very best of good luck."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied Clay respectfully, retreating toward the door. "Same
  to you, sir."</p>

  <p>Now exactly what did this young cub mean by that? Probably nothing, at
  all. He had said, "Same to you, sir," perfunctorily, routinishly, as he might
  have mouthed it had one wished him a Happy New Year.</p>

  <p>For a little while he sat very still and envied this gloomy, threadbare
  Clay Brock. "Don't be discouraged," he had counselled the boy. He chuckled
  deep in his throat, bitterly, remembering the old wheeze, "Here is an
  excellent hair tonic, sir," purred the bald-headed barber.... "Don't be
  discouraged... don't be discouraged"... <i>God!</i></p>

  <p>The arrival of his books by express on Saturday afternoon so immediately
  and definitely changed Parker's status at the Mansion that he hardly knew
  himself for the same person within an hour following their delivery. Mrs.
  Brock, who seemed to have got wind of it, though she had not been present
  when they came, appeared at his door to say that she had found a small
  bookcase for him, and wondered if the table in his room would be large
  enough.</p>

  <p>Her previous solicitude, which had clearly been tinctured with anxiety, if
  not downright pity, now moved up a peg. The uneasy concern he had begun to
  notice in her eyes had been replaced by an almost obsequious respect.</p>

  <p>Brock himself dropped in, late that afternoon, reckoning that Mr. Parker
  would probably remain with them for some time, and hoping so with a friendly
  sincerity out of all proportion to his former attitude of civility.</p>

  <p>Next morning, as he sat on the sunny veranda with a Sunday paper strewn
  about him, Parker looked up to see Clara Brock standing before him, gravely
  arrayed in an outmoded black silk into which she was so tightly squeezed that
  she fairly bubbled through the little round interstices between her heroic
  hooks and eyes.</p>

  <p>"Church?" he ventured, noting her hesitation to say whatever it was she
  had on her mind.</p>

  <p>"I reckon you wouldn't care to go," she said, rather wistfully.</p>

  <p>Somewhat to his own surprise, he promptly consented, warning her playfully
  that he was but little short of being a pagan and would have to be coached
  when to sit, kneel, and stand.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;we don't have much of that," assured Mrs. Brock. "We stand up
  for the hymns, and sit through all the rest of it. You'll hear Elise. She's
  singing a solo. It will be good, too! I want you to listen, whether you're
  musical or not. Maybe you are."</p>

  <p>"I used to fiddle a little," confessed Parker, as they strolled down the
  quiet street. "But I was never very good at it."</p>

  <p>"Well," Mrs. Brock observed philosophically, "when strangers say things
  like that about themselves you never can tell just what they mean, can
  you?... There's our Elise&mdash;going in now. The young man with her is Randy
  Vaughn. His father is Vaughn's Hardware and Implement Store. They generally
  come to the hotel for dinner on Sundays."</p>

  <p>The little church was ugly without and dingy within, smelling of varnish,
  though there was no evidence that any had been applied recently. The pews
  were severely straight-backed and bare, pitched at an angle demanding a
  posture which made the scattered company of worshippers appear of formidable
  character, as if their religion was something that required them to come to
  attention. It was not a very good place to relax into a leisurely
  contemplation of the everlasting quest for more information about Deity.
  Parker ventured a little excursion into the mass-psychology of the company.
  It was not expectant, as it would have been with the same number of people
  sitting in a railroad station. It was not fidgety, as it would have been in
  the receiving-room of a free clinic. It did not evince the eager anticipation
  of a theatre audience pulling off its hat as the lights dimmed. It was
  stolid, stiff, and a bit grim&mdash;not unlike the daguerreotypes of his
  great-grandparents.</p>

  <p>Presently the principals came in, by doors leading to the choir and the
  pulpit; a dozen young women and four men edging deferentially into the pews
  facing the little cabinet organ; and the minister, a youngish man of sober
  mien, taking his seat in a tall chair, where, it was evident, he sat with a
  discomfort befitting an occasion whose serious purpose had already been
  implied by the gravity of the congregation. The organ, at the behest of a
  plump lady with a large hat, embarked uncertainly on a prelude which at least
  one member of the audience recalled&mdash;not without a pang of
  nostalgia&mdash;as an exercise he had been required to learn when he began
  his piano lessons. He had been seven, then. The piece was entitled 'Evening'.
  Quite pretty, too. Elise was not listening to it.</p>

  <p>'Evening' quickly passed, swooning at the end as the organist permitted
  the wind to play out before removing her hands from the keys. The minister
  rose, and everybody stood with him. He closed his eyes and said, "Shall we
  pray?" It occurred to Parker that the psychology of this query was
  unfortunate. Surely, if other people were as indifferent to the exercise as
  he himself, they should be urged&mdash;if not positively commanded&mdash;to
  make the adventure. He was still thinking about this as he held one side of
  the frowsy hymn-book from which Mrs. Brock sang with fervour. The Bible, a
  sad book, was read with a becoming gloom. And our Elise arose to sing.</p>

  <p>Her selection was a simple little thing, probably chosen with a
  consideration for the organist's inexperience, but our Elise could sing! She
  was a pure contralto. In the lower register there was a peculiar haunting
  diapason quality, and when the score carried her up to the point of a slight
  voice replacement you saw where she was bound for and, remembering how far
  down she had been, you wondered whether she would arrive taut and anxious at
  her destination, but it was accomplished on perfect pitch and effortlessly.
  Parker was amazed and delighted.</p>

  <p>There were three stanzas of the little poem which provided the text, and
  while she was singing the last one, he changed her badly made brown dress
  into a modish white chiffon, led her out of the stuffy little choir-box on to
  a lighted stage, admiring the poise with which she waited for the
  black-haired man at the grand piano to introduce her first, throbbing,
  soul-gripping tone.</p>

  <p>It was not a large audience, for Elise was of no reputation, but it was an
  exclusive and discriminating company of persons likely to recognize talent
  when they saw it.</p>

  <p>The song, he felt, would have to be something unpretentious, appropriate
  to the occasion of presenting an unknown artist whose way must be made on the
  strength of native ability rather than the finish achieved by much training.
  'Calm as the Night'&mdash;that, he thought, would be about the right thing.
  They would go mad about her and she would have the good sense, when she came
  back, to give them Schubert's 'Serenade'. No&mdash;it mustn't be anything
  showy.</p>

  <p>He pursued these reflections throughout the sermon, which was based on
  something that Moses had said to Pharaoh quite a long time ago. Moses, it
  appeared, was putting on some sort of revolution in which there was a
  confused jumble of threats, imprecations, flies, frogs, and a bad epidemic
  among the cattle. "Let my people go!" Moses kept shouting. "Let my people
  go!"</p>

  <p>"A<i>-men!"</i> ejaculated a quavering old voice from one of the front
  rows. Nobody smiled. Parker glanced up at Elise and was distressed to note
  that even she gave no evidence of suppressed amusement. Perhaps she had not
  heard the fervent response. Perhaps she was not hearing anything. Her brown
  eyes were cloudy and the corners of her pretty mouth drooped a little,
  contemplatively. He wondered where she was.</p>

  <p>Moved, doubtless, by the same cerebral activity manifested by the
  behaviour of those who, as raconteurs, inevitably repeat the point of a joke
  that had won a little&mdash;but not enough&mdash;applause, the earnest parson
  lowered his voice impressively and muttered, yet again, "Let my people
  go!"</p>

  <p>It was, thought Parker, a good, sound epigram. Why didn't the town of
  Leeds let Elise go? Why didn't they help her go; insist on her going? Here
  they were, pretending to agonize over the predicament of certain primitive
  captives on the other side of the globe, thirty-five centuries ago, utterly
  indifferent to the quite obvious fact that they, themselves, were keeping
  their eagle in a chicken-pen. Apparently it hadn't occurred to anybody that
  they should set Elise free to realize the splendour of her great gift. Clara
  Brock sensed it a little, but even she was not fully aware of what Elise
  possessed.</p>

  <p>Yes&mdash;little Leeds, he thought impatiently, would continue to shake
  itself down for dimes and quarters to send to the mission station in
  Ting-a-ling, and their own golden-throated Elise would stay here and shrivel.
  They would never know that they had committed the unpardonable sin of
  watching a great talent die of starvation.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she will be over, this afternoon," remarked Mrs. Brock, as they
  walked slowly back to the Mansion, Parker having warmly expressed his
  admiration for her niece's voice. "Would you like to meet her, if she
  comes?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RANDY had said he would let himself out and she had
  listlessly permitted him to do so, smiling an apathetic good-night without
  rising from the piano stool.</p>

  <p>For the past hour or more their conversation had been difficult for Randy
  to support unassisted; and when, the hall clock having struck ten, Elise had
  inquired if that was eleven, he had decided to call it a day.</p>

  <p>Toward the last of it, Randy's monotonous monologue had settled into a
  sort of chantey; rhythmic, melodious, sedative, with a well-ordered refrain
  at the end of each stanza. Vaughn's&mdash;all things considered&mdash;hadn't
  done so badly this season. Nine hay tedders, four manure spreaders;
  <i>tedders, spreaders, tedders, spreaders.</i> They had disposed of much
  binder-twine and dynamite, and had done good business in fertilizers and
  cultivators; <i>fertilizers, cultivators, binder-twine and dynamite.</i> They
  had done very well with hoes and weeders. There had been a large sale of
  ploughs and seeders; <i>hoes and weeders, ploughs and seeders.</i> Randy's
  face had blurred, but Elise could still see his mouth going.</p>

  <p>He had paused once to inquire solicitously if she wasn't uncomfortable on
  the piano stool, his eyes drifting toward the sofa, but she had shaken her
  head and maintained her irksome posture, believing the strain of it would
  help her keep awake and feeling also that she needed to do penance for the
  thoughts which crowded her mind.</p>

  <p>After the front door had closed and the purr of the Vaughn motor had faded
  out down the road, Elise meditatively ran through the album of Chopin
  Preludes on the desk of her cherished baby grand until she came to Number 20.
  Tilting up her chin and closing her eyes, she gathered up into her strong,
  slim fingers a dozen resounding measures of the most potently heart-stirring
  chords she knew.</p>

  <p>Thus cleansed and reinvigorated, she rose, carried the tall glass vase out
  to the kitchen, changed the water she had poured in at six, carefully snipped
  off an inch from the long stem of the white chrysanthemum, and restored it to
  its place on the piano. Cupping the beautiful flower in both hands, she bent
  over it and inhaled deeply. It was a stimulating fragrance.</p>

  <p>Resuming her seat, she sang "He Shall Feed His Flock", realizing that she
  was doing it uncommonly well. There were tears in her eyes when she finished.
  After that, she sat very still for a long time, looking at the white
  chrysanthemum with the steady concentration of a crystal-gazer until it grew
  very large and the graceful blades of the petals shimmered with a pale
  opalescence. She drew a deep sigh and her fingers softly stroked the ends of
  the white keys. Now slippered footsteps and the familiar reek of iodoform
  brought her back to say, gently, "Through for to-day, Grampa?"</p>

  <p>Elise had not turned her face toward him, but her mental picture of the
  kindly-spirited old man was, she knew, entirely accurate. An affectionate
  smile softened the white-bearded lips. The great mop of silver hair was
  tousled. The knowing eyes were so black you couldn't define the pupil from
  the iris. He was wearing the tattered, quilted, maroon dressing-gown that
  Grandma had made for him years ago&mdash;the last product of her patient and
  competent needle. Elise could feel the worn texture against her bare elbow as
  he fondled the lobes of her ears, one of his favourite expressions of
  endearment since her early childhood. She reached up and caressed his
  leathery hands.</p>

  <p>"Sure you don't want anything more to eat?"</p>

  <p>"I should say not! The Pipers had everything they'd ever raised on the
  table, including a tough old gander. And I was ready for it, you'd better
  believe. Big job of carpenter-work I had to do out there."</p>

  <p>"Bad break, was it?" Elise had heard the details twice, but knew he wanted
  to talk about it.</p>

  <p>"Nastiest fracture I ever saw, I think. Young Jud&mdash;maybe I told you
  this&mdash;had been up in an old hickory shaking a limb when it broke with
  him. All of fifteen feet. It was a nasty one... right there. 'Potts
  fracture', we call it. Look." He put up a foot on the piano stool, rolled
  down his woollen sock, and diagrammed the accident. Elise winced a little
  when she saw how white and sharp his shin was. "Very nasty," he repeated,
  recovering his balance. "He'll do well if he's off his crutches by Groundhog
  Day."</p>

  <p>Elise was appropriately sympathetic and presumed that the Piper tribe was
  badly upset about it.</p>

  <p>"Well," sighed the old man wheezily, sinking into the deep chair that was
  still warm with farm machinery, "it can't be helped. How did you find the
  folks over at Clara's?"</p>

  <p>Suddenly brightening, Elise swung herself around on the stool, and having
  casually dismissed the perfunctory query about Clara's folks, remarked, "And
  I met the Mr. Parker who has come here to&mdash;to get away from everything
  while he does some special study. Perhaps he's writing a book about it,
  though he didn't say so. He wouldn't, of course. Very modest. Doesn't talk
  about himself, at all."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; he's the tall, city-looking fellow with the white sweater and
  the bird-dog. Where does he hail from?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't ask him. Up North, somewhere." Elise's hasty dismissal of this
  question proved its unimportance. "But he is a gentleman; perfect manners. I
  know you would like him, Grandpa. He's your kind of a man."</p>

  <p>Elise's grandfather stroked his short white whiskers and grinned. His
  black eyes twinkled. His lips puckered, teasingly. He imitated her own
  childish gesture of whittling one index finger with the other, her favourite
  method of discrediting a tall remark.</p>

  <p>"Certainly <i>not!"</i> denied Elise, colouring charmingly, and
  exasperatingly conscious of it. "Nothing of the <i>sort!</i> Mr. Parker is
  cultured, knows a lot about music, talks of things I'm interested in.
  Naturally&mdash;I like him. We speak the same language. And I can tell you
  it's a relief"&mdash;she continued with increasing warmth&mdash;"to find a
  person in this vicinity who is able to talk about something else
  besides&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Monkey-wrenches and post-augers?" suggested her grandfather, noting her
  hesitancy to make an immediate selection from a stock so comprehensive. "I
  agree with you, dear. But you'd better go slow with this man Parker until we
  find out a little more about him. And be careful you don't get Randolph sore
  at you. I see he left early."</p>

  <p>"He wanted to go," explained Elise glumly.</p>

  <p>"That's what I mean. We'll have to be careful about that."</p>

  <p>For some time Elise, her knees crossed, sat swinging one foot negligently,
  to prove that her meditation was guileless. Then, with a half-wheedling
  accent, she said softly, "Grandpa."</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear," answered the old man, kindly but not without suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Grandpa&mdash;would you object if I asked Mr. Parker here for supper some
  evening? He's awfully lonesome, and it seems to me it's almost up to some of
  us to extend a little of the hospitality we've bragged about so much."</p>

  <p>"Asking Randolph, too?" challenged her grandfather seriously.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;if you think we must. But&mdash;don't you see? Randy isn't
  interested in music or&mdash;or anything else that we would want to talk
  about. And Mr. Parker is too much of a gentleman to discuss things in Randy's
  presence that he knows nothing of. We would just have to keep to hardware...
  and I don't think it's fair," she finished dismally.</p>

  <p>Resolving to let the matter simmer for the present, the old gentleman
  nodded a few times and cast about for a diverting topic.</p>

  <p>"That's an unusually fine chrysanthemum," he observed. "It doesn't look
  like a local product."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it simply wonderful?" Elise offered it to him for close inspection.
  "He gave Aunt Clara some because she had asked him to have dinner with the
  family to-day. She doesn't know how in the world he got them here so soon
  from St. Louis unless he telephoned for them. They came&mdash;special
  delivery&mdash;while I was there. And when I thought they were lovely, he
  asked Aunt Clara if he might give me one. Gorgeous, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Elise, dear," muttered her grandfather ominously, "let me repeat that we
  must not offend the Vaughns. I never bothered you with this, for I feared you
  might be sensitive about it, but Henry Vaughn lent me six hundred dollars, in
  all, while you were in Louisville taking your vocal lessons. I had hoped to
  have it paid back long before now." His face was penitent.</p>

  <p>"Oh!... Grandpa!" moaned Elise. "Does that mean that I mustn't ever talk
  to anyone but Randy until this money is returned to his father?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it isn't quite that bad. But, as I have just said, we shouldn't
  go out of our way to annoy them.... You needn't worry about it, but be
  discreet." He yawned, to encourage her to think that the problem wasn't
  really disastrous, and said he reckoned it was time for him to go to bed.
  "I've been a bit short of breath all day. Had to crank the old machine this
  morning. Battery's worn out."</p>

  <p>"You ought to get a new one," replied Elise. "Vaughns have them, don't
  they?"</p>

  <p>"I expect so," he said wearily, "but collections are slow, and I don't
  like to ask Henry for any more credit.... You invite your Mr. Parker here, if
  you want to, but better ask Randolph too, and maybe one of the
  girls&mdash;Sue Sizer, or somebody. That would make it all right, I
  reckon."</p>

  <p>Elise went to bed with what she thought must be the sensations of a slave
  held for debt. She turned her hot pillow over and over. What a mess her life
  was going to be!</p>

  <p>Perhaps Randy would have to go down to Nashville for a couple of days'
  business before long. He had spoken of it. If she waited until he had made
  definite arrangements, she could ask Mr. Parker over while Randy was out of
  town. No&mdash;that wouldn't do at all. Randy would have even more cause to
  feel offended.</p>

  <p>Maybe she could have Mr. Parker here and keep it a secret from Randy,
  though that would be difficult, with everybody knowing everybody else's
  business.... Her heart pounded. Maybe she could have him on short notice when
  Grandpa was away on a long trip&mdash;a baby case, perhaps. That took all
  day, generally.</p>

  <p>There never had been such expressive hands. And how devoted Clay was!
  Surely that proved how attractive he was, for Clay was always so reserved
  with strangers. He had honestly liked her voice, too. He wasn't saying it
  just to be polite. You can tell. "Distinguished talent." He didn't have to do
  that if he was merely wanting to be pleasant. "You could go far." And his
  face was so serious when he said it.</p>

  <p>Funny how some people seemed to be a part of their clothes. Even his blue
  polka-dotted four-in-hand looked as if it had been made especially for him.
  His shoes, too. It was probably stamped on the inner sole&mdash;'Handmade for
  Mr. Parker.' No, it wouldn't say that. It would be 'Handmade for Nathan
  Parker.' She wondered if his people called him Nathan. Nat, more likely. It
  would be fun to ask him when they were better acquainted. She heard herself
  doing it; heard herself saying that his name somehow fitted him exactly.
  Funny about that: everything Mr. Parker had&mdash;eyes, hands, collar,
  shoes&mdash;fitted together. And his name, too. Names were such queer things,
  anyhow; seemed to have personality; seemed to be as much a part of you as
  your hands or your voice. Elise&mdash;for instance. That was as it should be.
  Elise. She couldn't think of herself being anything else but Elise. She had
  always felt like an Elise. Elise Graham.... She snuggled her face into the
  pillow... Elise Parker... Elise Graham Parker.</p>

  <p>She was making a lovely monogram of this when she heard Grandpa slowly
  padding down the stairs in his felt slippers; a step, a long pause, a siege
  of coughing, another step, a longer pause. The banister creaked as if he
  might be leaning on it heavily. Perhaps he was going to the dispensary for
  some medicine. It always annoyed him if she seemed anxious about his health;
  disliked to have her fluttering about him when he had these little spells
  with shortness of breath. She lay quite still and listened. He had reached
  the bottom now. Doubtless he would be coming up again presently.</p>

  <p>When the clock struck twelve, Elise decided to go down. He was sitting
  very straight at the desk in his pungent little room, rather pitiful in the
  absurd old flannelette nightgown, unbuttoned over his bony chest. He had his
  fingers on his pulse and his blue lips were counting. Each wheezy exhalation
  of his gasps gave him a spasmodic kick in the stomach. His eyes were
  straining as if they, too, were sucking for air.</p>

  <p>"Can I do anything, Grandpa?" inquired Elise, trying to keep her alarm out
  of her voice.</p>

  <p>He shook his head and remained intent on his pulse.</p>

  <p>"I'll do a morphine injection," he said huskily, "if I don't get
  relief&mdash;pretty soon. I've had my quota of digitalis." He pointed to the
  hypodermic syringe to let her know he had been doing something for himself.
  "It's these damned stairs," he explained, "and that cranking I did
  to-day."</p>

  <p>"Shall I make up the sofa for you?"</p>

  <p>He nodded and tried to smile.</p>

  <p>Elise was glad to be doing something. She hurried upstairs and collected
  the necessary bedding. After a while he came, walking very slowly, and eased
  himself down on to the couch. She patted the pillow, but he shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," he said. "Must sit up. I've been neglecting&mdash;my digitalis
  lately.... Great thing&mdash;digitalis.... Couldn't live&mdash;without it."
  He grinned feebly. "We both have&mdash;favourite posies&mdash;Elise.... White
  chrysanthemum&mdash;and purple foxglove.... You better&mdash;go to bed
  now."</p>

  <p>For an hour she sat on the floor, her feet drawn up under her, nestling
  her check against his knee. It was a great relief to her when he said he
  thought he might lie down. He seemed very sleepy.</p>

  <p>They met in the Post Office at nine, Elise rather flustered and rosy; for,
  half a block away, she had seen Mr. Parker entering and knew that an
  encounter would be unavoidable.</p>

  <p>It was not that she didn't want to meet him. Her accelerated pulse
  testified to that. But she wasn't certain that their contact on the street or
  in the Post Office, which at this hour of the morning was well patronized,
  would be a very happy one.</p>

  <p>If she greeted him with anything like the personal interest she felt,
  someone would be sure to notice it and perhaps comment on it. If, on the
  other hand, she protected herself against the possibility of being chattered
  about, Mr. Parker might be hurt by her attitude of cool unconcern.</p>

  <p>Her steps lagged while she debated the respective disadvantages of either
  course, but quickened when she decided that it would be better to meet him in
  the Post Office than outside. He was stowing stamps in his wallet as she
  approached the little window. His casual greeting gave their slight
  acquaintance the exact value it deserved, suddenly restoring her
  self-confidence. Surely nothing would be thought of it if she showed some
  friendly attention to the dog. Sylvia, however, seemed a bit remote.
  Observing that she was about to have her ears tousled, she side-stepped the
  caress, Mr. Parker apologizing for her frosty indifference. Sylvia, he said,
  was a man's dog. A hunter, you know. Elise accepted the explanation,
  wondering whether Sylvia's attitude toward women was shared by her
  master.</p>

  <p>They walked out of the Post Office together, Elise completely forgetting
  the apprehensions that had bothered her a few minutes earlier. It seemed the
  most natural thing in the world to be walking down the street talking to Mr.
  Parker, and the fact that Leeds could see him accompanying her home did not
  disturb her in the least.</p>

  <p>Grandpa's indisposition being uppermost in her mind, she confided her
  anxiety, her tall companion manifesting a sympathetic interest which, thought
  Elise, was just what one might expect of him. She had never met anyone so
  responsive. He was inquiring now whether they had called a doctor.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," she replied. "Grandpa always knows what to do when he has these
  attacks. I don't know what causes them. He always coughs very hard when he
  has them, whether he has a cold or not. And he has a lot of trouble with his
  feet; shoes too tight. I wanted him to stay in bed to-day, but he says he
  positively must go out into the country to see a boy who broke his leg
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose there is anyone he could send in his place," suggested
  Mr. Parker. "It sounds as if he should be quiet for a few days."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he'll be all right," hoped Elise. "He always takes a medicine
  that helps. I've forgotten the name of it. He said last night that he had
  been neglecting it and had let himself down to about eighteen grains,
  whatever that may mean."</p>

  <p>"How much does he weigh?" asked Mr. Parker, to Elise's surprise, for the
  question was so decidedly irrelevant.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;about a hundred and fifty pounds. Why?"</p>

  <p>"I just wondered," drawled Mr. Parker. "It <i>was</i> rather off the
  subject, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Grandpa says this boy has the worst break he ever saw. That's why he's so
  insistent on going to see him. He said it was 'a Potts fracture', whatever
  that is," explained Elise, smiling companionably over their mutual ignorance.
  "Now you know all about it, <i>don't</i> you?"</p>

  <p>He nodded his head, profoundly, seeming to pretend wisdom.</p>

  <p>"Think your grandfather would object to giving me a ride with him out into
  the hinterland?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," replied Elise, mentally attempting a picture of
  Grandpa's reaction to such a proposal. "You might hint. Look! He's just
  leaving now." She waved a hand, and the old man waited for them to approach.
  An introduction was effected, her grandfather delighting her with his
  cordiality.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Parker has just been saying that he envied you your drive out into
  the hills," said Elise, secretly hoping, for Grandpa's sake, that he would
  invite Mr. Parker to come along, and reproaching herself for wishing, too,
  that it might turn out some other way. It would be pleasant to ask Mr. Parker
  in.</p>

  <p>After a long moment, during which the old doctor looked the newcomer over
  with an amusingly frank interest, he told Parker to hop in, if he didn't have
  anything better to do.</p>

  <p>"I'll let you drive, too, if you like. Dog going along? Very well. Just
  open that rumble.... Back about noon, Elise."</p>

  <p>It had all happened very quickly. Mr. Parker gave her a canny wink as he
  started the little car. She wondered if he realized what that brief gesture
  of comradeship meant to her.</p>

  <p>"Ever see a broken leg?" shrilled Dr. Graham, above the racket, after some
  desultory talk about the glorious weather and various points of local
  interest along the road.</p>

  <p>"A time or two," Parker admitted ingenuously.</p>

  <p>"Make you sick to look at injuries?"</p>

  <p>Parker replied that he presumed he had an average stomach.</p>

  <p>"I may ask you to lend me a hand, out here, if you don't object. I put
  splints on this leg yesterday, but I wasn't very well satisfied and I may
  decide to make a cast for it to-day. If so, I'll need somebody to help hold
  it in position while I do the bandaging. Was going to ask one of the boys,
  but members of the family aren't much good. Too squeamish. Think you'd be up
  to it? Rather nasty business."</p>

  <p>"I can try," agreed Parker obligingly, "if you're not afraid I'll be in
  your way&mdash;or do the wrong thing."</p>

  <p>"There won't be any trouble about that. I'll tell you exactly what to do.
  Simple job of leg-pulling. You will take his foot and pull while I apply the
  bandages. They will be wet plaster, and when they dry out&mdash;there you
  are! Hard as a rock."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes you X-ray these bad breaks, don't you, Doctor?" asked Parker
  artlessly.</p>

  <p>"S-u-r-e! That's what should be done, by all means, in this case. But
  these worthless Pipers haven't a dime. They never paid a doctor's bill in
  their lives. I've attended the arrival of all the children, and the total
  proceeds were a couple of hams and a few gallons of blackberries. I advised
  the X-ray, of course, just to be doing my duty, but they were against it.
  They're as afraid of a hospital as they might be of a pest-house. No&mdash;in
  cases like this, we just do the best we can and trust to luck and Old Lady
  Nature. It's amazing, the recuperative capacity of the benighted."</p>

  <p>Sylvia consented to be tied in the little car when they drew up under the
  shade of a big beech in front of the unpainted old house. A half-dozen male
  Pipers, assorted sizes of a single pattern, viewed the arrival with big,
  empty eyes, and hands thrust elbow-deep into the pockets of their tattered
  pants. Mrs. Piper, lacking several front teeth, rolled her thin arms in her
  brown apron and led the way into the bedroom that probably served as a
  parlour ordinarily. Mr. Piper, in patched blue overalls, lounged into the
  room and leaned against the head of the iron bed, sucking a cold corncob
  pipe. Herman, eighteen, stood in the doorway, scowling sympathetically. The
  patient tried to grin, without much success. He admitted having had a bad
  night.</p>

  <p>Parker watched the old doctor with interest as he paternally chaffed his
  patient while unwrapping the bulky bandages made of torn-up, coarse,
  household sheets. He found it difficult to keep from smiling as he surveyed
  the strange array of home-made plaster bandages that came out of the
  capacious leather bag he had carried into the house.</p>

  <p>"Now, here, Mr. Parker," began Dr. Graham, "you see what we have to deal
  with. See there? Run your fingers gently along there. That bone&mdash;you've
  probably forgotten your physiology&mdash;is the tibia. That's the big one.
  That's the bad one. Feel that? Now this one&mdash;the fibula&mdash;you can't
  feel the break there quite so plainly, but it's broken, too. Both bones
  broken above the ankle and the ends spread apart&mdash;so. Understand? Now,
  when you pull the foot, it will have a tendency to straighten these fragments
  out to their proper position. I shall put on the plaster bandage while this
  tension is on&mdash;after I've manipulated the ends of the bones into place.
  Got it?"</p>

  <p>"Sounds like it might hurt a little," observed Parker.</p>

  <p>"We'll give him a few whiffs of chloroform," confided the doctor, a
  private announcement that brought instant relief to the patient's face.</p>

  <p>"<i>Who</i> will?" Parker inquired, wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>"His father," replied Dr. Graham, adding, reassuringly, "I'll show him
  how."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;my God!" exclaimed Parker impulsively. "Isn't that a
  frightfully risky thing to do?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Graham shook his head unconcernedly. "I'll keep an eye on him. This
  doesn't call for a deep anæsthesia. I mean," he explained, "he'll not need
  very much. It will be safe enough."</p>

  <p>Well, thought Parker, if this doesn't call for a deep anæsthesia, the
  Piper boy is going to be a cripple for life. He began to feel sorry for
  everybody connected with the absurd little tragedy. His amusement and
  amazement kept abreast as he helplessly watched the preparations for this
  strange surgical phenomenon. Herman, obedient to instructions, came in from
  the barn with the long leather lines belonging to the buggy harness and
  anchored his brother's shoulders to the head of the bed. Mrs. Piper came with
  a bread-pan half-full of water and the rolled-up plaster-filled bandages were
  immersed.</p>

  <p>"Soon as it stops bubbling," said Dr. Graham, sprinkling the swollen leg
  with talcum powder, "we're ready."</p>

  <p>For a moment, Parker was inclined to be indignant. What right had this old
  man to do such a slipshod piece of work? But, after all, what else was there
  left him to do under the circumstances?</p>

  <p>They were ready now. Father Piper, as sluggish an organism as had ever
  been sent in motion among the higher primates, was instructed how to hold the
  wad of gauze into which the doctor had poured an ounce or more of chloroform.
  Young Jud's apprehensive tension relaxed after a few eager sniffs at it. The
  air was already so heavy with the potent stuff that Parker wondered which one
  of them would go out first.</p>

  <p>Standing helplessly at the foot of the bed, he found his nails digging
  savagely into his palms. In a flash there recurred to him the old story of
  the retired fire-department horse that had kicked the garbage-wagon to pieces
  when the alarm sounded, and galloped away from her degrading job to race
  alongside the gleaming apparatus as it went shrieking down the street.</p>

  <p>Parker's fingers itched to lay hold on those young bones that throbbed for
  competent attention.... X-ray?... Parker had a picture of that Potts fracture
  in his head! Of all the cruel detainments he had experienced since that
  fateful morning at Parkway Hospital, this moment of supine waiting for a
  broken old man to finish his feeble pottering, preparatory to sentencing a
  husky youth to hobble through life, demanded a type of self-restraint that
  was an offence to his soul.</p>

  <p>"Do you reckon it will hurt him bad?" mumbled Mrs. Piper, her scrawny
  knuckles pressed hard against her wrinkled lips.</p>

  <p>"The doctor says not," consoled Parker, feeling that she was at least
  entitled to whatever relief could be offered at the moment. There would be
  plenty of time, later, for Mrs. Piper to grieve. She would watch him trudging
  lopsidedly in from the fields, and say, "My poor boy." And when he was forty,
  the neighbours would speak of him as "Crip" Piper.</p>

  <p>There was a code of ethics in the medical profession. It had been Parker's
  religion. It was a built-in fixture. He would abide by it. But his nails cut
  his palms.</p>

  <p>Dr. Graham, with very shaky hands and a million tiny glistening beads of
  perspiration on his ash-white forehead, was manipulating the fractures."</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Parker," he said in a frail treble, "take the foot firmly in
  both hands and pull steadily&mdash;not too hard." There was a strained look
  on his face as he turned to the little marble-topped table for the first of
  the plaster-saturated bandages. Parker saw him stagger and clutch at the
  table for support.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Piper," commanded Parker. "Get Dr. Graham a chair and a glass of
  cold water.... Herman, come here and hold this foot exactly the way I'm doing
  it.... Mr. Piper, you're holding that much higher than Dr. Graham told you.
  Put it down&mdash;closer to the face! That's more like it. Don't let it touch
  his nose, but keep it close." He took a sheet they had pulled off the bed and
  threw it over Piper's forearm, and reached into the pan for a bandage. After
  a long minute of waiting, he muttered into Herman's ear, "Now, my son, you
  pull just as hard as ever you can!"</p>

  <p>The deft, vice-like compression of Parker's hands as he manipulated the
  fractures and tightly applied the bandage, together with Herman's strong tug,
  fetched a yell from under the sheet that flattened a half-dozen Piper noses
  against the window-panes.</p>

  <p>"That will do for the present, Mr. Piper," said Parker. "Put that gauze
  aside. We will wait now until Dr. Graham feels a little better, and he will
  do the important part of the bandaging."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes the gallant old fellow had staggered back to the
  bedside.</p>

  <p>"That's excellent, Mr. Parker!" he approved enthusiastically. "I believe
  we've got it now exactly where we want it." The business of applying the rest
  of the bandages went forward in a workmanly manner, Dr. Graham still
  breathing hard but in good spirits.</p>

  <p>After they had waited for the cast to dry sufficiently for the leg to be
  comfortably laid on a pillow, the doctor said they would be off now. Parker
  could hardly resist smiling as he walked out of the ramshackle house, past
  the tattered, barefooted Pipers, carrying Dr. Graham's shabby old leather
  kit. He knew people who would have been interested in seeing a picture of
  it.</p>

  <p>For the first half-mile of execrable road, the old doctor had nothing to
  say, but when they came to smoother going on the gravel, and the increased
  speed stirred an invigorating breeze, he seemed inclined to talk.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Parker," he said respectfully, "you were a great help to me out
  there. More, perhaps, than you realize." He chuckled to himself a little as
  if he had a private joke. "If this affair was written up for a medical
  journal, none of the city fellows would believe it. How you ever managed to
  bind up that leg the way you did, I'm sure I don't know. Did Piper go to
  sleep at his post? I never heard a more blood-curdling howl than you got out
  of that boy Jud. But I believe we're going to have a fairly good leg there,
  thanks to your strong hands."</p>

  <p>Parker idly dismissed the commendation with a remark that he had tried
  only to obey the doctor's orders, playfully insisting that Dr. Graham was
  pleasantly exercising his talent for the traditional courtesy of the
  Southland. This being the old gentleman's chief pride, he capitulated to the
  handsome young Mr. Parker&mdash;horse, foot, and guns&mdash;and upon their
  arrival home, Parker's protestation that he should not accept the pressing
  invitation to stay for dinner, on such short notice to the hostess, was
  clamorously overridden.</p>

  <p>"My dear," announced her grandfather to the rosily excited Elise, when
  they were seated at the table, "this young fellow missed his calling." And
  when she begged for an explanation, he told her, with much merriment, the
  story of the morning's adventure. Then, with great seriousness, he said, "All
  jesting aside&mdash;I've seen <i>doctors</i> do worse jobs!"</p>

  <p>Parker allowed a deprecatory grin and remarked in an aside to Elise, who
  beamed brightly over the little implication of intimacy, "Dr. Graham is
  having a spot of fun at my expense." It occurred to him that with more truth
  he might have said, "And so am I."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT would have been quite impossible for Nat&mdash;she had
  attended promptly to this abridgement&mdash;not to have observed, from the
  first, that Elise Graham was warmly interested in him. To a degree he shared
  this feeling and was comforted by a comradeship which he badly needed.</p>

  <p>After his many weeks of aimless wandering, almost as much a fugitive as if
  he were stealthily creeping from the scene of a major crime, and heart-sore
  over the sudden collapse of a promising career to which he had given himself
  with full devotion, this charming and talented girl's unrestricted proffer of
  confidence was&mdash;to say the least&mdash;soothing. He was hungry for
  companionship, and here it was to be had without stint.</p>

  <p>It was the last night of 1929. He had just returned from the Grahams',
  leaving at ten-thirty for reasons which he considered good. Something warned
  him against a <i>tête-à-tête</i> celebration of the New Year at midnight,
  their close friendship having reached the stage where it needed only such a
  flick of the whip to send it galloping in a direction which, he had firmly
  resolved, it was not to take.</p>

  <p>For nearly a month, Nat Parker had been seeing Elise almost daily,
  cheerfully abetted by her indulgent grandparent who, nonchalantly
  "to-helling" his earlier misgivings over the warrantable annoyance of the
  Vaughns, had welcomed the urbane stranger to his hearth and table with a
  cordiality that threatened to become more and more perplexing.</p>

  <p>Whimsically trading on the lenient consideration due to the elderly by
  their juniors, the fine old gentleman had been increasingly reckless with his
  genial innuendoes. Desirous of nothing so much as the happiness of Elise, and
  observing her avowal of affection in every tone and gesture, he seemed to be
  viewing with impatience any further effort to conceal something that had now
  become plain as a pikestaff. Apparently nothing was farther from his
  conjecture than that Parker might have any other opinion on this matter than
  his own.</p>

  <p>Leaving them alone together after supper on Christmas Eve, Dr. Graham had
  paused in the wide doorway of the living-room to gaze significantly at the
  mistletoe above his head, after which he had departed with an omniscient
  grin.</p>

  <p>"Grandpa's so fond of mistletoe," Elise had explained. "He always hangs it
  there." And then she had added, in a confidential tone, "Grandpa is simply
  impossible sometimes."</p>

  <p>"He's a dear old fellow," Nat had replied. "Loves to tease."</p>

  <p>Seriously taking stock of their present relationship, in the final hour of
  the year, Parker thought he could truthfully say that he had done little to
  add impetus to its development. From the first day of this acquaintance,
  Elise had appointed herself curator of their fellowship, administering its
  affairs with a generosity at once flatteringly trustful and giddily
  indiscreet.</p>

  <p>The situation, he now felt, was beginning to clamour for quite a bit of
  taking in hand. He knew he was not in love with Elise. Indeed, he had never
  been really in love with anybody. Young women had briefly stirred his
  interest, from time to time, but his profession had been so jealous a
  mistress that there was no chance for any of these budding romances to put
  forth a flower. After he had been obliged to make half a dozen last-minute
  cancellations of engagements with some attractive girl, she became
  justifiably indignant or tiresomely petulant.</p>

  <p>For Woman&mdash;viewed as an institution&mdash;he was conscious of a deep
  respect bordering on veneration. She stirred his protective instinct and
  appealed to his chivalry. The insoluble mystery of the feminine mind and
  heart had been of such interest to him that her body seemed mysterious too,
  even in the face of a scientific knowledge which, one would have thought, had
  long since made it as prosaic as the multiplication table. But Parker had
  never loved any one woman, not even Elise. His calmly considered judgment
  assured him that her undisguised affection for him needed no ampler
  explanation than the simple fact that at the moment there was nothing better
  she could do with it. Any other personable man, he believed, could have had
  it.</p>

  <p>However much or little they might have been mutually congenial under
  normal conditions, the peculiar setting in which Nat and Elise had discovered
  each other's social isolation was highly inflammable. His own extended period
  of bitter loneliness and her hopeless frustration in dull little Leeds had
  given their friendship a necessitous quality almost as urgent as if they had
  been shipwrecked and cast up together on a desert island.</p>

  <p>Parker liked her thoroughly, sincerely admiring her superb talent, her
  ready wit, her vivacity, and her prompt responses to a given atmosphere.
  There had been, for instance, the inevitable inquisition to be gone through
  very early in their acquaintance, concerning the exact state of his heart and
  the degree of his liberty. Experience had taught him to expect this. He could
  not recall ever having conversed a second time with any girl whose curiosity
  on this subject was entirely absent. It was not, he honestly believed, that
  these chance acquaintances had any designs on him as an individual, but
  rather as if their inquiries&mdash;impudently direct or playfully
  implied&mdash;were propelled by some instinct demanding them to ascertain
  where a man stood in relation to their species.</p>

  <p>Driven by this biological urge, Elise had man&oelig;uvred their talk into
  this quarter with all the premeditated cunning of an experienced chess-player
  until he was left with but one possible move. Tacitly acknowledging the
  stalemate, he had conceded her a bootless victory, blandly inviting her
  attention to other conversational activities, a decision she accepted with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>Persevering as a spider, she had, on another occasion shortly afterward,
  requested him to jump through the hoop which she had suddenly thrust in his
  way; and, upon noting his hesitation, had given him the encouragement of a
  heartening example by jumping through it herself, in the course of which
  adventure she had confided more than she had any business to concerning her
  relation to Randy Vaughn who, she observed, had always taken too many things
  for granted. But the Vaughns were like that. It was a congenital infirmity
  with the Vaughns to consider it an act of impiety on anyone's part to deny
  them a request.</p>

  <p>Somewhat restless in the confessional, Parker had politely absolved Elise
  of any further obligation to the Vaughns, agreeing that her life should be
  her own to be disposed of as she wished&mdash;after which he had lighted a
  cigarette and irrelevantly asked her if she was acquainted with the full
  story of Franz Schubert's composition of Symphony Number Eight in B Minor.
  She had listened to the tale with full attention.</p>

  <p>To-night, as he was leaving, Elise had made quite a long and elaborate
  ceremony of putting into his coat-lapel one of the violets he had brought her
  in honour of the occasion. She had had to reach up a little and stood very
  close, looking up into his face, offering him a temptation which he was glad
  now he had been able to withstand, however awkward it had made him feel at
  the moment of ignoring the gift she had so clearly intended him to take.</p>

  <p>Nothing was plainer than that their relationship would now have to be
  repitched in another key, or he would be obliged to leave Leeds at once. It
  would be a very ungracious thing to run away. The Grahams had taken him into
  their confidence almost as a member of their household and at a time when he
  was all but desperate for congenial friends. He felt himself under an
  obligation to Elise and her gentle-hearted old grandfather. It could not be
  discharged by his going through the motions of requiting Elise's affection.
  He wished there was something tangible he might do for her.</p>

  <p>A bright idea! He wondered why it hadn't occurred to him before. He would
  try to give Elise a chance to demonstrate what she could do with her voice!
  If all that she required was a public appearance, set up under influential
  auspices, he would provide the necessary funds.</p>

  <p>After much thought about the devices he would be obliged to invent in an
  effort to bring this about, Parker sat at his desk and composed a letter of
  considerable length to his warm friend and confident, Eugene Corley, junior
  member of the firm of Corley, Corley and Corley, his attorneys. The
  churchbells rang and the whistle at the Dietz sawmill blew while he was
  signing his name to it. A new year had arrived. A sudden cold wave of utter
  dejection swept over him. He pushed the chair back from the desk and bowed
  his head in his hands. Sylvia strolled over from her corner and nuzzled into
  the crook of his elbow.</p>

  <p>Happy New Year!</p>

  <p>Once a sick man at Parkway, recently bereft of his wife, to whom he had
  been singularly devoted, had confided how&mdash;deep in the night&mdash;he
  sometimes reached out a hand, and, waking, was gripped by a loneliness so
  utterly desolating that he was physically chilled.</p>

  <p>The Baptist bell and the Methodist bell and the whistle at the Dietz
  sawmill clamoured of a new year. Presently the midnight dissonance subsided,
  and Leeds was quiet again.</p>

  <p>Parker had experienced many a dark hour since his renunciation of
  everything that life held dear. This hour was the darkest.</p>

  <p>He felt sure Elise had the letter to-day, for he had received one from
  Eugene stating that hers was going forward by the same post. Eugene had said
  that instructions were being followed in every detail. There was a
  pen-written postscript chaffing him. "As if it wasn't enough for you to lose
  your job and your name, you seem now to have lost your heart. Do you still
  have your dog?"</p>

  <p>At eight, he strolled down to the Grahams'. Elise met him at the door in a
  grand state of exultation, threw her arms about him and stood on tiptoes to
  be kissed. He was happy to meet this impetuous display of gratitude, tendered
  in the presence of her grandfather, who, with beaming eyes, hovered close
  behind her. Everything now was exactly as it should be, Parker felt. Elise
  was going to be his sister. Her chance to make something important of herself
  had driven her infatuation for him into complete eclipse.</p>

  <p>She hurried him by the hand into the living-room, pushed him down on the
  end of the sofa under the reading-lamp, thrust the epoch-making letter at
  him, and with all the spontaneous enthusiasm of a delighted child pressed her
  cheek against his shoulder, following the lines of the impressive document
  while he read aloud.</p>

  <p>The firm of Corley, Corley and Corley was pleased to advise Miss Graham
  that their client, Mrs. Norma Phelps, who frequently made small
  "courtesy-loans" to promising artists in need of "an encouraging subsidy",
  having learned through Mr. Nathan Parker of Miss Graham's unusual talent,
  desired to place at her disposal sufficient funds to insure her a deserved
  recognition.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, Mrs. Phelps's immediate departure for Europe would make it
  impossible for her to manifest a more personal interest, at this time, in
  Miss Graham's success. Whatever communication Miss Graham might wish to have
  with Mrs. Phelps should be cleared through the office of Corley, Corley and
  Corley.</p>

  <p>The sum of two thousand dollars had been placed in the Fidelity Bank of
  Louisville, subject to Miss Graham's order. At her convenience, the money
  could be repaid, with or without interest, as she herself might elect. If,
  for any reason, the contemplated promotion failed to achieve substantial
  results, Miss Graham need not consider herself obliged to restore the money,
  Mrs. Phelps assuming this risk of her own volition.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it simply marvellous?" cried Elise. "You'll help me, won't you,
  Nat? I'll need a lot of advice."</p>

  <p>Parker had worried more than a little over the transparency of this
  singular proposition. He felt greatly relieved to find that Elise did not
  consider it at all preposterous, probably because she had so great faith in
  her ability to justify the beneficence of her good angel, Mrs. Phelps.</p>

  <p>For all of two hours she bubbled with plans for the stupendous event which
  was to give her her chance, Parker amazed and touched by the evident time and
  thought she had previously given to this matter. It showed how passionately
  she had longed for some such thing to come to pass.</p>

  <p>"And it wouldn't have been possible but for you, Nat," she paused once to
  declare gratefully, to which he replied that it was Mrs. Phelps who deserved
  all the credit.</p>

  <p>"Do tell me what she's like!" Elise settled herself comfortably to hear a
  personal sketch of her benefactress. "Tell me all about her!"</p>

  <p>Nat had not prepared for this, and never before having ventured to assume
  any of the prerogatives of the Creator, this bringing Mrs. Norma Phelps into
  existence with no construction materials at hand except her name, obliged him
  to do some rapid thinking.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Phelps, he presumed, was about sixty-five. "In her stocking-feet," he
  added, hoping Elise, already in hilarious mood, might consider it droll
  enough to laugh at, thus permitting him a little more time to organize the
  good lady's biography in such a manner as to reflect no discredit on her.
  Mrs. Phelps, he admitted, had an odd taste in hats. She was an inveterate
  globe-trotter and an ardent collector; had long since given up maintaining a
  home; lived in hotels, and liked it. Elise, full of interest, wanted to know
  what Mrs. Phelps collected, and Nat promptly replied, "Rugs."</p>

  <p>"How funny!" observed Elise. "What does she do with her rugs, having no
  home to put them in?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know!" replied Nat, with a gesture implying that Mrs. Phelps's
  ways were, after all, inscrutable. "You'll meet her sometime, doubtless, and
  you can ask her. I'm sure you're capable of it," he added. "I never knew
  anyone so inquisitive."</p>

  <p>Next day Nat Parker went to the city, at Elise's request, and laid her
  case before an experienced advertising man. They lunched with a feature
  writer who was quick to interest herself in the fascinating story of the
  "discovery" that had been made in little Leeds.</p>

  <p>"Of course, there is no reason why anyone should try to tell <i>you,</i>
  Miss Davidson, who Mrs. Norma Phelps is or what she has done to put unknown
  artists on their feet," remarked Mr. Parker craftily. He had prepared himself
  to expect that Miss Davidson might be a bit hesitant here and accept the
  statement&mdash;if she accept it at all&mdash;on the first bounce. To his
  happy surprise, she caught it on the fly, running eagerly to meet it.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mrs. Phelps!</i> To be sure! Why, the girl will be made!"</p>

  <p>There was free discussion of Miss Graham's relation to the late Colonel
  Brock, a beloved figure still well remembered by the Old Guard. A tender note
  was sounded concerning her grandfather's long service, largely unrewarded, on
  behalf of the poor, for whom he had travelled the back roads by day and by
  night for more than forty years. It was a good story, Miss Davidson said; nor
  did she change her mind when Mr. Parker, taking leave of her, tarried at the
  little floral shop near the hotel entrance, to present her with a corsage of
  gardenias. "With Miss Graham's compliments," he said. "She will be wanting to
  meet you and express her thanks."</p>

  <p>Having given this effective publicity a couple of days to soak into the
  imagination of the city's musically inclined, Mr. Parker made another
  journey, taking Elise with him. They contrived to secure an interview with
  Darien Moore, the best-known accompanist in that zone, whose sponsorship of
  an unfamiliar name would carry great weight. He had seen the story about Miss
  Graham, and agreed that whoever received the sanction of Mrs. Phelps was
  surely worth attention. Elise sang for him in his studio, and he was
  delighted. She asked him if he would play for her on the night of her
  recital, and he consented. Before they left, Parker confided to Mr. Moore the
  fee that Mrs. Phelps had suggested if they were able to secure for Miss
  Graham the services of a widely recognized accompanist. Mr. Moore blinked a
  little. Whatever inquiries may have floated through his mind respecting the
  identity of Mrs. Norma Phelps could now be safely dismissed.</p>

  <p>The movement was gathering speed and momentum with such amazing ease that
  Parker was heartened to unplanned audacities. A drawing-room recital for an
  exclusive group of potential patronesses was arranged for the coming week. It
  was a notable success.</p>

  <p>Nat Parker had certain qualms about the methods he was pursuing, but he
  knew he wasn't cheating. He could deliver the goods, however shady was the
  technique of propaganda. The point of it was, <i>Elise could sing!</i> Any
  measure that would help her to her rightful chance was pardonable.</p>

  <p>"You've been a darling!" murmured Elise, on the returning train, when it
  had become assured that the recital was being backed to the limit by the most
  influential people in town.</p>

  <p>"It has been a lot of fun," he said, "and I'm very happy for you. Mrs.
  Phelps will be very pleased."</p>

  <p>That night he wrote to Eugene Corley telling him that the recital, billed
  to occur on Tuesday night, the fourth of February, was&mdash;from advance
  reports&mdash;not only going to pay for itself, but net a nice little
  balance.</p>

  <p>"This business of serving as an impresario," he concluded, "has been full
  of excitement and adventure. I have met some of the most charming people I
  have ever known, and I have told more lies in the past forty-eight hours than
  the sum total of all I ever told in my life.... Quite incidentally, your
  recent kittenish comment implying that I am in love with this girl convinces
  me that the subject is too much on your mind. I can definitely assure you I
  am not."</p>

  <p>On Nat's advice, Elise had gone up to the city for two weeks of intensive
  work with Mr. Jaqua, her former vocal instructor. Not only would it serve to
  give her more confidence, but, they were all agreed, she should be free of
  home responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jaqua was glad enough to give her this special attention. He was quite
  ecstatic over his favourite pupil's good fortune, and the fact that he was
  about to bask in the reflected glory of her talent made him garrulously
  enthusiastic. Who, indeed, had been chiefly responsible for the proper
  placement of that golden voice if not Jaqua? He said this in several
  quarters, and in consequence was interviewed at length concerning his
  impressions of Miss Graham, thus adding fresh fuel to the bright bonfire of
  publicity which was lighting her path to glory. The whole event had now been
  set up in such a manner that Elise would have to do very badly indeed to
  escape the recognition planned for her.</p>

  <p>"Nat," she said, in the final conference they were having on the night
  before she left home, "you think I am to make a little money with this
  recital. I am very anxious to give it to Clay, so he can matriculate at the
  medical school at the beginning of this next term."</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" approved Nat. "You are a very good girl."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;Grandpa borrowed six hundred dollars from Mr. Vaughn when I was
  studying," continued Elise, with a troubled voice, "and it really should be
  paid back to him. I can't do both things."</p>

  <p>"Why not? Mrs. Phelps does not expect you to return her loan immediately.
  Pay back part of it now, and attend to Mr. Vaughn and Clay with the
  balance."</p>

  <p>"Would that be quite fair?"</p>

  <p>"Write to Mr. Corley," Nat advised, "and tell him all about it. As Mrs.
  Phelps's attorney, he will unquestionably approve. I am very glad about your
  thought for Clay. My dear&mdash;there's something fine in you that keeps
  cropping up."</p>

  <p>"Isn't it natural," she asked, with a self-deprecatory little gesture,
  "that I should want to help my cousin, now that so much has been done for
  me?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Nat brusquely, "it isn't. Unfortunately the genius possessed of
  an outstanding gift is more often than not afflicted with a badly inflamed
  ego, and a shocking capacity for self-indulgence. The very best thing about
  you, Elise, is your simplicity&mdash;and your ability to keep your head. Have
  you said anything to Clay?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. I didn't want to take the risk of disappointing him."</p>

  <p>"Good sense again&mdash;but now you may tell him. He should be given time
  to make his plans; the new term will be opening in a few days."</p>

  <p>Elise was thoughtful. How could Nat be so sure that Mrs. Phelps, or Mrs.
  Phelps's attorney, would sanction her wish? He must be much closer to Mrs.
  Phelps than he had admitted. The query added mystery to the vasty spaces in
  Nat Parker's life which, to her, was <i>terra incognita.</i> For a moment he
  seemed almost a stranger.</p>

  <p>"And afterwards?" she murmured, half to herself.</p>

  <p>"After <i>what?"</i> asked Nat absently, for he, too, had been
  wool-gathering.</p>

  <p>"After the recital. What am I to do then? Come back here and wait for
  something to turn up? Have you any further plans for me?" Her eyes queried
  him childishly. "I can't expect you to stay here in Leeds very long. You
  don't belong here. We both know that. You've another world. I am not
  acquainted with it, but I know there is one. I've tried to piece little
  scraps together and paint a background for you, but there's been very little
  to work on. Except for your early childhood, and the music, you might as well
  have lived on Mars, so far as my own information goes." She was very pensive,
  her moody eyes accusing him of not being quite fair. "What am I going to do,"
  she asked after a little silence, "when you leave me?"</p>

  <p>"It's quite the other way about," countered Nat, seizing upon her last
  query. "You will be leaving <i>me.</i> Your liberating chance is plainly in
  sight. Your career is just arriving. Mine, you see, has just&mdash;" He left
  the sentence unfinished, and when she prodded him with "&mdash;Has just
  <i>what?"</i> he replied, jocularly, "Well&mdash;yours is nearly full-blown,
  and mine is too full-blown; blown up, in fact." He ventured a little laugh,
  to prove that it didn't matter; that he was readjusted.</p>

  <p>"Nat&mdash;did you get into trouble?" Elise's voice was tender.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;will you be content not to ask me anything more about it? It's
  a very painful subject."</p>

  <p>She nodded reluctantly and laid her hand on his.</p>

  <p>"Will I ever be told?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Probably not." He rose, and signed that he should be taking his leave.
  "As for you," continued Nat, "your future is assured. I shall always be
  keeping track of you, wherever you are, wherever I am."</p>

  <p>"Will there ever be anything I can do for you?" asked Elise, putting both
  hands on his arms affectionately.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" he replied, almost gruffly. "<i>Succeed!"</i> He turned away toward
  the door, altered his mood suddenly and said, with a companionable smile,
  "I'll be seeing you&mdash;on the triumphant Tuesday!"</p>

  <p>"It's almost as if we'd been saying good-bye for ever," murmured
  Elise.</p>

  <p>Dr. Graham and Clara Brock and Clay had proudly put her on the train, next
  morning, Clara reporting an hour afterward that Randy Vaughn had shown up at
  the station to offer his good wishes.</p>

  <p>"Poor Randy," added Clara, offering Parker a chance to comment, "he's been
  feeling rather left out of things lately, I reckon." She laughed knowingly,
  as if they had a little secret.</p>

  <p>"Good practice for him," observed Parker drily, which made Clara laugh
  quite gaily, for Elise and Nat had not been able to fool her very much. She
  knew how <i>that</i> was going to turn out, and had known it 'from the first
  day they had set eyes on each other'.</p>

  <p>"I think Randy knows his suit is lost," she said, confidentially muffling
  her prediction behind her hand.</p>

  <p>"Randy never had a case," agreed Parker, meeting her secretive mood. "He
  should have known he couldn't harness the Heavenly Maid to a plough." Clara
  missed the allusion, considered it an exuberant outburst of devotion, and
  squeezed his hand, whispering, "You two!" He had a notion to detain her and
  attempt to set her right, but she had scurried away, satisfied that her
  suspicions had been happily confirmed.</p>

  <p>The days dragged abominably, Parker more restless than he had ever been in
  his life, his sole diversion&mdash;except for tedious evening hours with Jeff
  Trumbull&mdash;being Clay's eagerness to be off. The youngster, curiously
  enough, had determined to go to the one medical school that Parker knew from
  crypt to spire. It was sometimes difficult, in the face of the boy's almost
  hysterical enthusiasm, not to offer some detailed information and a few
  helpful hints.</p>

  <p>"Isn't Elise a brick?" he exclaimed fervently, watching Parker's face for
  tokens; hopeful of learning something.</p>

  <p>"It runs in the family, I think," drawled his non-committal friend. "Very
  stout fellows&mdash;all of you. You'll probably make a famous doctor, Clay;
  mostly because you want to. That's the main thing. Some day I might live in
  your town and want my liver taken out."</p>

  <p>"I'd do it," said Clay happily, "for nothing."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't get the full value of it that way. Anything you get for
  nothing is no good. I'll pay for it. I'll pay you now!" He drew out his
  wallet. "There. Run down to Nashville to-morrow and order a suit of clothes.
  And remember," added Parker sternly, "it's on account!"</p>

  <p>Clay tried to protest, but Parker was firm. The next morning, after
  breakfast, when he went up to his room, Clara was making his bed herself,
  which was unusual. For a little while she busied herself with her task,
  paying him no attention, and then she blurted out, explosively, half-crying,
  "I don't know why you're so good to my boy, but he just loves you&mdash;and
  so do all the rest of us"&mdash;after which she bustled out of the room, very
  much overwrought.</p>

  <p>Dr. Graham was taking his meals, through these days, at the Mansion. The
  slight alteration of his mode of living was a bit exciting. He tarried to
  talk frequently, and in the genial buzz and stir of the little hotel he
  seemed to find pleasure. It was doubtful, however, whether this distraction
  from the calm routine of his quiet home was good for him.</p>

  <p>They marvelled at the Mansion that he was so spry and told him so,
  thinking to please him. It was true. He was spry&mdash;too spry.</p>

  <p>One afternoon Parker accompanied him into the country to make a call,
  tactfully suggesting in the course of their conversation that physical
  exercise could easily be overdone. More people in mature life, he thought,
  were damaged by overactivity than underactivity.</p>

  <p>"Any of your relatives doctors?" inquired the old man.</p>

  <p>"My father, sir."</p>

  <p>"Ever go with him?&mdash;ever see him set a broken leg, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. My father died when I was a small boy."</p>

  <p>"You would have made a good doctor yourself, I think."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Parker, wondering how much more of this there was going to
  be.</p>

  <p>"Ever consider it?" persisted Dr. Graham, measuring his words
  significantly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, perhaps." Parker tried to be casual. "Every boy toys with the idea at
  some time.... It's nice that Clay is to have his chance, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>On the Sunday evening preceding the recital, Dr. Graham was quiet and
  pale. He ate little and tottered feebly out of the dining-room. Parker could
  hear him in the hall assuring Clara there was nothing the matter except a
  little shortness of breath.</p>

  <p>Shortly after nine, it suddenly occurred to Parker, who had retired to his
  room early to read, that he should stroll down to the Graham house. It was in
  darkness except for the little dispensary where a single light glowed through
  the shutters. He rang the bell, rapped with his knuckles on the door-panel,
  and after long waiting, turned the knob.</p>

  <p>Dr. Graham, wide-eyed with agony, was seated astride a chair, his hands
  clutching the top, desperately struggling for breath. It was evident that he
  was badly frightened, as he had a right to be. His nails and lips were
  cyanotic. Parker laid a hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Anything I can do?" he asked sympathetically. The old man pointed a shaky
  finger toward the familiar leather bag on the table, and Parker held it open
  on the back of the chair. After much frantic rummaging, a tarnished
  hypodermic case was fetched up from the depth of the clutter of tools and
  bottles, and the doctor tried unsuccessfully to open it with cold, impotent
  hands.</p>

  <p>This was no time, decided Parker, for an attempt to preserve his
  secret&mdash;not at the risk of another man's life! He tossed the worn old
  bag aside and took the hypodermic case from Dr. Graham's hands. Opening it,
  he laid out the steel syringe and what seemed to be the best of the small
  assortment of needles. He found a test-tube and heated a small quantity of
  water over a candle-flame, the old man's anguished eyes following him
  closely. He looked over the long, slim phials of tablets in the old-fashioned
  case, and tapped one out of the morphine tube.</p>

  <p>"A quarter?" he inquired. Dr. Graham nodded.</p>

  <p>The tablet was quickly dissolved in the warm water, sucked up into the
  barrel of the syringe, and the shank of the needle deftly screwed on. The old
  man was fumbling with his sleeve button. Parker bared the arm, polished a
  little spot with a wisp of cotton saturated with alcohol, grasped the
  pathetically flabby skin with experienced fingers; and, tipping up the
  syringe, pushed the piston gently to expel the air. He caught Dr. Graham's
  searching black eyes, realizing that if nothing he had done, so far, had
  given him completely away, surely this last tell-tale gesture with the
  hypodermic instrument would settle the matter. It was quite beyond belief, he
  knew, that a layman would go about this business with the quick precision
  which certified to thorough understanding and long practice.</p>

  <p>The administration of the drug was adroitly, painlessly accomplished,
  Parker gently massaging the little bump with his thumb after the needle had
  been withdrawn. The effect was almost instantaneous. The doctor drew several
  long sighs and began to relax. Then he looked steadily for a minute into his
  young friend's eyes, and said, huskily, "I should have known it&mdash;that
  day&mdash;out at Pipers'&mdash;when you reduced the Potts. <i>I did know it
  when I took off the cast!"</i></p>

  <p>"Would you mind&mdash;keeping this a secret, Dr. Graham?" said Parker. "I
  have good reasons for asking."</p>

  <p>"It's a pity," mumbled the old fellow.</p>

  <p>"It's a secret?" repeated Parker. "Not even Elise. Agreed?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Graham nodded, and clung tightly to Parker's arm as they went into the
  living-room.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I shall not be able to go to Elise's recital."</p>

  <p>"No," said Parker, "nor shall I unless you are much steadier in the
  morning. Be at ease now. I'm staying with you to-night."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Dr. Parker." The tired old voice was very husky. "Your name is
  Parker, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"No.... Perhaps you'd better give your poppies a chance now."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so," came the sleepy drawl. "Thank you&mdash;Doctor."</p>

  <p>It was a great disappointment to miss witnessing Elise's triumph, but Nat
  felt that his first duty kept him close to the fine old man in Leeds.</p>

  <p>Unable to go, he ordered a great armful of roses, wired encouragement
  before and congratulations after, reassuringly explaining her grandfather's
  absence on the ground of "extra pressure of emergency work", which was nearly
  true, since the old gentleman was at that time putting in twenty-four hours a
  day trying to keep a worn-out pump going.</p>

  <p>Next morning he jubilantly read to Dr. Graham&mdash;obediently in
  bed&mdash;the abundant and flattering press reports of the mighty victory.
  All the rich adjectives of unlimited commendation were sprinkled generously
  through the chronicles of "the season's outstanding musical event".</p>

  <p>"It's what she has always dreamed of," said the old man weakly. "And she
  has you to thank for it&mdash;Doctor."</p>

  <p>Elise was to arrive home that evening at eight. Her grandfather watched
  the clock, impatient to hear her story from her own lips. Clara stayed with
  him while Nat went to the train.</p>

  <p>As she descended from the steps of the Pullman to the old wooden platform,
  it was quite evident that something epochal had happened to Elise. She had
  realized her possibilities&mdash;had glimpsed her destiny. She had gone up to
  the city a half-frightened girl, and had returned a self-possessed woman,
  calmly conscious of her new estate. From now on, henceforward&mdash;her
  manner said&mdash;she was insured. Parker was delighted.</p>

  <p>In the loose-jointed little taxicab she did not let herself splutter a
  torrent of superlatives, as he had anticipated while waiting for her train.
  Elise was a confident artist now. She reached for his hand in the dark, but
  he knew that her thoughts were on more important matters.</p>

  <p>"I've been having a very interesting correspondence with Mr. Corley," she
  said casually. "Naturally I wrote to Mrs. Phelps, thanking her for
  everything. Mr. Corley replied that he was forwarding my letter to her and
  suggested that she might appreciate a photograph. So I sent him one&mdash;you
  remember, the one with the little black hat."</p>

  <p>"Eugene will like that one, I know," agreed Parker.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;he does. So&mdash;then&mdash;I asked him if he couldn't send me
  a picture of Mrs. Phelps to hang in my studio: the one I'm going to
  have."</p>

  <p>"And he sent you one?"</p>

  <p>"No; he said that unfortunately they had no photograph of Mrs. Phelps, but
  seeing I was transacting all of my business with her through him, he would,
  if I desired it, send me one of his photographs. Wasn't that odd?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;no; not for Eugene. Is it a pretty picture?"</p>

  <p>"Marvellous!... And Mr. Laughton, the booking-agent, is coming down to
  talk over contracts and such things on Saturday."</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" said Nat, still smiling in the dark.</p>

  <p>"And I've promised to sing at Trinity Cathedral at Easter. Mrs. Robert
  Sinclair&mdash;wife of <i>the</i> Robert Sinclair, you know&mdash;attended
  the reception. She was visiting her sister, Mrs. Carter. You
  remember&mdash;you met her. Mrs. John Fielding Carter. Mrs. Sinclair's
  husband is prominently connected with Trinity Cathedral. Has a lot to say
  about the music. It's a male choir, of course, but I'm to sing a solo on
  Easter morning, and I'm to be Mrs. Sinclair's guest. Isn't that marvellous,
  Nat?"</p>

  <p>He tried to keep pace with her enthusiasm. Privately he was browsing among
  the memories he cherished of the most important woman he had ever known and
  her recurrent allusions to Trinity Cathedral. She had wanted him to go there,
  some day, and see for himself. She had hoped he would meet her Dean Harcourt.
  How strangely one's life seemed to proceed on a definite orbit, as if
  predetermined from without!</p>

  <p>For a fleeting moment he toyed with an idea that would have seemed absurd
  a year ago. Was it possible that all the bother he had given himself these
  past few weeks on Elise's behalf was for the purpose of driving
  him&mdash;willy-nilly&mdash;into the presence of the great Harcourt?...
  Ridiculous!</p>

  <p>"You'll go, won't you, Nat?" Elise was insisting.</p>

  <p>"Go?" His voice came back from a long distance.</p>

  <p>"At Easter&mdash;to hear me sing&mdash;at Trinity Cathedral. Promise!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered soberly.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SPRING had been in no hurry. Indeed, she was so sluggish
  that many of the temperamentally frail of faith had begun to wonder if the
  whole universe had not been slowed up by the economic depression. But early
  in the second week of April, as if suddenly startled wide awake, lethargic
  spring had developed an amazing energy, arriving in a few hours at full
  gallop and steaming hot, attended by excited convoys of overdue robins and
  bluejays.</p>

  <p>A noisy and colourful pageant of thunder and lightning had preluded a
  pelting rain that washed the city as nearly clean as it was ever likely to
  be. Hyacinths, tulips, and daffodils popped up like mushrooms. On teeming
  pavements, tops and marbles screamed above the din of the hurdy-gurdy for
  their ancient rights in the dizzying confusion of roller-skates and
  skipping-ropes. In the parks, new perambulators and old canes made long slim
  parallel lines and neat little round holes in the spongy gravel paths. The
  big buses careered top-heavily as they sputtered along Lake Boulevard with
  top decks crowded and plenty of room inside. The big aviary in Madison Park
  was a pandemonium of shrieks and squawks in every key and a-flutter with
  loose feathers of every hue. And everywhere the hope-reviving, spring-like
  scent of warm, moist earth, was in the air.</p>

  <p>This impetuous advent of belated spring had put the spur to every manner
  of business affected by the seasons, crowding the streets, the shops, the
  suburban trains. Harried merchants, who in exasperation had daily watched
  great splotches of wet snow ironically blurring the windows they had
  decorated with straw hats, gay ginghams, lawn furniture, and Easter fluffies,
  now found themselves so busy that some of the more optimistic said, "We have
  turned the corner."</p>

  <p>Sonia, happily weary after a long Saturday's profitable toil in her small
  but elegant Parisian shop, had felt justified in the unaccustomed
  extravagance of a taxi, telephoning home immediately before taking it.
  Unlocking her apartment door, she smiled, sniffed appreciatively, and
  followed the aromatic trail of a sizzling steak.</p>

  <p>"Phyllis, dear," she chided, "you're much too tired to be doing that. We
  should have gone out. But now you're at it, I certainly am glad. I'm tired as
  a cart-horse and hungry as a wolf."</p>

  <p>"So am I. It will be ready in five minutes."</p>

  <p>Lingering in the doorway of the snug little kitchen, Sonia carefully
  lifted off her swagger spring hat and surveyed the impromptu cook with
  affectionate admiration.</p>

  <p>"I believe I'll put in a line of aprons <i>de luxe,"</i> she remarked,
  with professional finesse, "provided you will consent to act as model and
  show them off. Of course, no apron could ever hope to look like that on
  anybody else, but a lot of women might think it would. What an adorable
  figure you have, Phyllis."</p>

  <p>"Thankee, mum." Phyllis bobbed a kitchen curtsey. "Faith an' ye ought to
  know, mum, a-wearin' a sixteen, and it's many a tear Oi've shed fer ye, what
  with yer a-drinkin' th' coffee black, and a-rollin' on th' floor ivry blessed
  morn like an animal to presarve yer a-lookin' like a high school lass... but
  it's a good thought," she went on, abandoning her foolery&mdash;"about the
  aprons, I mean. If our customers are to do their own work, they may as well
  look their best. We'll dignify the kitchen and glorify the apron and make
  cooking a noble art."</p>

  <p>"You'd have a rough time selling that sublime idea to me," scoffed Sonia.
  "I hate greasy pots and pans&mdash;and I thank God I do!"</p>

  <p>"That's because you have another job," argued Phyllis. "If it had been
  your destiny to run a house, and circumstances forced you into the kitchen,
  you'd welcome anything that would make your drudgery less ugly. Perhaps if we
  sold pretty aprons, we should be contributing that much to the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I know," broke in Sonia teasingly, "to the sum of human
  happiness. That's what the Dean would say."</p>

  <p>"And he would be right&mdash;as usual."</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear. Everything one does should somehow be good for the troops. You
  still believe that; don't you?"</p>

  <p>"And so do you," retorted Phyllis, "for all your pretended spoofing."</p>

  <p>"Of course. I just wanted to hear you say your catechism."</p>

  <p>"Get on!... Wait!&mdash;hand me that platter.
  Now&mdash;scram!&mdash;unless you want to eat this cold."</p>

  <p>The intimate friendship of the two had become firmly established almost
  immediately upon their chance meeting at Trinity Cathedral more than four
  months ago. Sonia, momentarily serving as Dean Harcourt's "secretary", had
  met the charming stranger in the reception-room. After a minute's friendly
  talk, she had returned to the Dean, saying, "A very lovely girl, cultured, in
  her early twenties, wants me to tell you that Phyllis is here. Perhaps you
  will know."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I do," replied the Dean quietly. "Bring her in&mdash;and after
  about twenty minutes, come back."</p>

  <p>Phyllis, quite calm and self-possessed, had followed along until they
  reached the familiar library door which she had so often entered with her
  mother. Entirely unaware of the tender relationship between the attractive
  caller and Dean Harcourt, Sonia had opened the door, expecting the girl to
  enter rather diffidently. So completely taken by surprise that she stood for
  a moment unable to turn away, Sonia heard a little cry of mingled sorrow and
  relief, and had a fleeting glimpse of Phyllis&mdash;her well-disciplined
  reserve utterly tossed aside&mdash;as she rushed across the room like a
  frightened child running to her mother's arms. Obedient to instructions,
  Sonia returned after a while. Phyllis had drawn up a chair very close beside
  Dean Harcourt's, and had regained her composure, though it was evident that
  she had given way to her grief.</p>

  <p>"Come here, Sonia," said the Dean gently. "My Phyllis Dexter&mdash;and
  yours too, I think&mdash;has been very badly hurt. Her father and mother,
  both warm friends of mine, recently met tragic deaths and her home is
  consequently broken up. She has just returned from England. Her only sister
  is in the hospital, convalescent from an illness. The other relatives live
  elsewhere. There are plenty of friends to whom she might go, people who would
  welcome her, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean you're going to let me have her?" asked Sonia entreatingly,
  confidentially, almost as if Phyllis were not present.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you are going to take her for a few days&mdash;until she decides
  what next to do.... You see, dear," tightening his clasp on Phyllis's hand,
  "I knew what Sonia would say."</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;Sonia," murmured Phyllis, looking up with admiring eyes.
  "I want to go with you."</p>

  <p>"It's like this," explained the Dean meditatively. "If Phyllis goes out to
  the Sinclairs or the Duncans or almost anywhere else among the people with
  whom the Dexter family has been intimate, they will keep her thinking and
  talking about her trouble and treat her with the well-intended but thoroughly
  enervating compassion that delays prompt readjustments.... Now, run along,
  and see what you make of each other."</p>

  <p>Phyllis had risen, pensively grateful, laying her hand on Sonia's arm in a
  little gesture of confidence. Sonia hesitated, and seemed suddenly
  depressed.</p>

  <p>"Did you tell her"&mdash;the words came reluctantly, almost
  inaudibly&mdash;"about&mdash;about me?"</p>

  <p>"Phyllis," said the Dean soberly, "do you believe there is anything I
  could tell you about Sonia that would alter your present estimate of
  her?"</p>

  <p>For an instant the two women looked each other squarely in the eyes.
  Phyllis's lips parted in a smile, and she slipped her arm through Sonia's,
  their fingers interlacing.</p>

  <p>"Does that answer your question, Sonia?" asked the Dean gently.</p>

  <p>"You are very good to me," she said, barely above a whisper, again as if
  they were alone.</p>

  <p>They left the room, arm in arm, turning at the door to smile a farewell.
  Without any silly conceit, each was aware that the pair of them offered a
  startling contrast in feminine pigments&mdash;Sonia a striking brunette, hair
  so black it was blue, skin so white it was almost pallid; Phyllis with
  yellow-gold bobbed curls, dark brown eyes, and pink cheeks deeply
  dimpled.</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt held up an outspread hand as the door was closing and they
  paused&mdash;Gaul and Saxon at their fittest, heads close together&mdash;to
  hear his parting injunction, suspecting from the merry twinkle in his eyes
  that it was not going to be a very solemn utterance.</p>

  <p>"If you two highly gifted women," he said slowly, "are as different on the
  inside as you appear on the outside, you should have an interesting
  friendship."</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" exclaimed Phyllis, as Sonia joined her at the table.
  "Pat's coming!"</p>

  <p>"For Easter? How awfully jolly!... No potatoes, thanks."</p>

  <p>"Gets here Thursday evening; stays through Tuesday. Look&mdash;I'll read
  it you: 'I am very anxious to see your Sonia, and I think she is a darling to
  want me to come&mdash;' By the way, doesn't anybody in the whole world know
  that you have another name besides Sonia?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but I'd like some of the Worcester sauce. Proceed, please."</p>

  <p>"'But I don't like the idea of crowding you, as is likely if her apartment
  is as tiny as mine.'"</p>

  <p>"I'll wire her a night letter to ease her mind.... And the pepper.... I
  can sleep comfortably on the sofa. No, little one, you're too long-legged....
  Does she talk like a university professor? Her subject is English, isn't it?
  I hope I'll pass. I've just failed in Modern History."</p>

  <p>"Sonia! You don't mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do! The man isn't in love with me. He is lonely and Celeste
  likes me and that's about all there ever was to it. I interest him because
  I'm not too hard to look at, and know how to wear my clothes, and pick the
  right spoon, and am amusing to his little girl. But he doesn't love me and
  I'm not the least tiny mite in love with him. Really&mdash;I think Andy was
  relieved when I told him so. He knows I wouldn't fit into that university
  picture. I would never feel comfortable. And there's another
  reason&mdash;plenty good, too&mdash;that you don't know about."</p>

  <p>On two or three previous occasions when confidences were being exchanged,
  Sonia had cryptically turned the knob of her closet door with a hint that
  there was a rattle-able skeleton.</p>

  <p>"If you ever want to tell me, my dear, I'll listen," said Phyllis quietly.
  "And if it's anything very bad, I won't believe it.... I've a letter from
  Grace," she continued, when it had become apparent that Sonia had no notion
  of pursuing the veiled topic.</p>

  <p>"How is she liking it by now at Saint Agnes's?"</p>

  <p>"Well, for one thing, she has more liberty than I supposed. It's an
  Anglican institution. I don't think their regulations are quite as severe as
  the older sisterhoods.... I would like to read you part of it.</p>

  <p>"She says&mdash;'Sooner or later I would have come here in any event. It
  has been on my mind for some time. The thing that happened to us brought me
  to a prompt decision. There was nothing I could have done for you. I would
  have been just one more problem on your hands. I'm utterly unpractical. If I
  had tried to go through the motions of making my own living, I would have
  been a mere pensioner on the charity of an employer who might have taken me
  on for Father's sake.'"</p>

  <p>"Don't read it to me," murmured Sonia, when Phyllis had paused for an
  instant. "It sounds very private."</p>

  <p>"But I'd like to talk it over with you. Let me go on.... 'Frankly, I had
  grown tired of the world. It wasn't the flesh, which I always had fairly well
  in hand, or the devil, who is a just a fantastic old myth; but the world, in
  my opinion, isn't a natural habitat for a creature of my disposition.'"</p>

  <p>"What a deliciously droll way to say it!" laughed Sonia. "She must be
  awfully funny."</p>

  <p>"Grace inherited her dry humour from our mother."</p>

  <p>"You got quite a generous share of it yourself, Phyllis, besides the gift
  of her eyes and her mouth. Your resemblance to your mother's picture at your
  age is the most amazing likeness I ever saw.... Well&mdash;go on! Grace's
  letter promises to be good."</p>

  <p>"'I don't feel a bit like a dependant here,'" read Phyllis. "'Even if
  Father hadn't made that lavish gift, back in '25, I would have no misgivings
  about putting in at Saint Agnes's. The people who support this institution
  get their money's worth out of us. They know we pray for them, which is of
  course only common decency on our part; though, personally, I would be
  willing to do my share of that, anyway. I know some of them very well and I
  think I can say&mdash;without betraying any secret&mdash;that they are jolly
  well in need of it.</p>

  <p>"'Sister Cecilia, who is supposed to read all our outgoing mail, may
  stroke her pretty chin and wonder whether the foregoing paragraph is
  discreet, but I don't see how she can consistently delete it, for if our
  benefactors are not in need of supplications, we are wasting a good deal of
  our time, and we rather pride ourselves here on the worthwhileness of our
  daily intercession.' Evidently," commented Phyllis, "Sister Cecilia decided
  to let this indiscretion pass."</p>

  <p>"Something tells me I'd rather like that censorship job," drawled Sonia.
  "Frightfully entertaining!"</p>

  <p>"'You may want to know why I grew tired of the world. I'll tell you. In
  the first place, it's too noisy, and growing noisier every day. Many of the
  newer noises are leading to mental decay. The world has now quite passed the
  point where an individual may decide whether or not take the risk of
  listening to the radio. It now intrudes upon him&mdash;in the hotel, in the
  observation car, on the highway. There is no place left where one is
  protected from the throaty sobs of bad music set to worse grammar. Don't
  misunderstand me. I have no quarrel with these soloists. Doubtless they are
  very fine people. Nor am I contending that the general public is to be
  criticized for liking and wanting this sort of entertainment. The fault is
  entirely with me. The world loves it: I don't. I am pleased to be insulated
  against it.</p>

  <p>"'There is a high stone wall round this place and it is three miles from
  the town. No motors, no automatic rivet-hammers, no crash and clatter of
  tramways; no ambulance sirens shrieking that another pair of people, showing
  off their recklessness, have met head on and catapulted through their
  windscreens. And, what is much more important&mdash;<i>no speeches!</i> You
  can't realize, until you've experienced it, the ineffable peace that derives
  from one's knowledge that one is for ever out of earshot of the pompous,
  arrogant, opinionated men who harangue the world from every corner. I believe
  I could have stood the world if it hadn't been for the loud vulgarity of the
  people who are trying to save it.'"</p>

  <p>"I wonder what the Dean would say to that," speculated Sonia.</p>

  <p>"He would probably agree," thought Phyllis, "though he might say it
  differently."</p>

  <p>"'But that wasn't all I wanted to escape from. I was weary of a world of
  haste, worry, strain, and artificial whoopee; weary of the frantic struggle
  to say and do the things that happened to be vogue this week in our social
  set; weary of sour grins across the bridge table and the poor sportsmanship
  of losers; weary of trying to decide whether I would rather be a fuddled
  giggler at the country club or refuse the cocktails and be sneered at for a
  prig and a spoil-sport. And I was tired of being pawed and mussed by men for
  whom I had no intellectual respect&mdash;big, brassy creatures who liked to
  brag that they didn't know one picture from another, and ridiculed classical
  music, and hadn't read a book all the way through for two years; hadn't
  anything but money (and now hadn't even <i>that</i>&mdash;which made their
  poverty complete). They couldn't talk to you intelligently; seemed to think
  you ought to feel yourself flattered if they tousled you...'</p>

  <p>"Look, Sonia!" Phyllis reversed the page, showing where three lines had
  been carefully inked out.</p>

  <p>"That must have been too thick for our Cecilia," chuckled Sonia. "I wonder
  if she grinned when she read it."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Phyllis declared. "She's a woman. There isn't a woman on
  earth who wouldn't think that was amusing.</p>

  <p>"'Here at Saint Agnes's, there is pleasant work to do. We have an
  excellent library, pianos, orchestral records for our recreation hours. The
  garden is lovely. Each of us has a little plot of her own. There are looms
  and workshops where we make pretty and serviceable things of leather, wood,
  brass, silver, and clay. Some of us specialize in needlework. In the
  afternoons at five we assemble for a half-hour's organ recital and the vesper
  service. Nobody preaches about the mistakes of the Government or what would
  become of us if we had another war. It is all very peaceful.</p>

  <p>"'I want you to come here, some day, and see me. You may find it
  uneventful, for you will be not allowed to stay long enough to cool off. The
  calmness is just a bit bewildering until your nerves have had a chance to
  relax their tension. That takes some time, depending of course on how badly
  diseased they were.</p>

  <p>"'Don't worry about me. I am not morbid. I am not moping. I am not
  fanatical. I am not goofy. We have a good time. We laugh with each other and
  at each other&mdash;not boisterously, but merrily. There is no talk of
  money&mdash;either to prattle of money made, or sulk over money lost. Nobody
  frets because she can't afford to buy the hat that would make Mary Does's hat
  look&mdash;'" Phyllis paused to explain. "Cecilia has scratched out a word
  here and writen 'out-moded' above it. What do you suppose it was?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Lousy,"</i> suggested Sonia. "That's what the world was calling a bad
  hat when Grace retired.... In fact, it's a good word <i>yet</i>&mdash;for a
  bad hat," she added thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"'Nor am I worrying for fear the lapels on my last season's spring jacket
  may be three-eighths of an inch too narrow. Saint Agnes's doesn't bring out a
  new model very often; hasn't, at least, since I've been here. And in that
  length of time, out in the world, I might have had two complete new outfits
  and already be looking like something that ought to be under glass in the
  Smithsonian.... Don't pity me. I don't need it.'"</p>

  <p>"Sounds good, doesn't it?" sighed Sonia. "Especially when you're tired....
  Any more?"</p>

  <p>"Just a few lines. 'I haven't many responsibilities here, and am still
  childishly indulged by my betters. They seem to understand that I came here
  in response to a push rather than a pull. I'm not yet sure whether or not I
  have a vocation.'"</p>

  <p>"Maybe it's a vacation," observed Sonia. "Whatever it is, I can't help
  envying her all that peace and quiet."</p>

  <p>"And not having to try to keep in the fashion," added Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"That reminds me!" Sonia pushed back her chair and beckoned Phyllis to
  follow her into the modernistic living-room. Opening a box and tossing aside
  the tissue-paper, she held up for inspection a sports blouse. "That," she
  declared, with conviction, "is the best-looking beige we've ever had!"</p>

  <p>Monday had been another very active day in the little shop until about
  four when, as usual, business slacked. Sonia had retired to the tiny cubicle
  she called her office and was busy totting up her accounts.</p>

  <p>"Phyllis," she called, "get out! We're through for to-day except for this
  desk-work and you can't do anything about that. Run along. I'll be home about
  six-thirty."</p>

  <p>Strolling for a short way down Lake Boulevard, Phyllis boarded a bus,
  leaving it at the corner of Madison Park, where she sauntered for a while
  among the formal flowerbeds, inhaling the fragrance of the fresh spring
  blooms. The massive towers of Trinity Cathedral, across the way, were casting
  long shadows. The carillon was booming <i>Lead, Kindly Light.</i></p>

  <p>She was not often alone, these days. Perhaps that was just as well. Sonia
  had been a precious darling, had taken her into the shop and given her a
  chance to be busy; useful, too, Phyllis believed, reassured by her
  sales-slips and Sonia's increasing confidence in her ability. And Sonia had
  taken her into her home, where she had been happier than she had ever
  expected to be again after the sudden devastation of everything that had
  constituted her life.</p>

  <p>But now that the bewildering novelty of the new scene had rubbed down to
  something like a settled order, Phyllis was beginning to find herself
  occasionally inundated by an almost suffocating wave of unrest. Work in the
  shop had been quite a lark at first; ever so much more pleasant than she had
  anticipated. Remembering stories she had read about the trying experiences of
  sales-people, she had fortified herself to deal with women whose attitude
  might range all the way from pitying condescension to insufferable hauteur,
  deciding in advance that she would probably prefer forthright rudeness to
  lofty compassion.</p>

  <p>To her happy surprise, there had been very little of this, and what little
  there was had been merely amusing. She had talked about it to Sonia.</p>

  <p>"Both right," Sonia had declared laconically, "you and the stories you
  used to read. There has come a great change. The customer isn't quite so sure
  of herself. She doesn't know what minute she'll have to ask for credit. Much
  better manners on tap now in all the shops. And worse manners in the
  street."</p>

  <p>Phyllis had asked for further light on this psychology and Sonia had
  elaborated her theory.</p>

  <p>"I figure it this way," she said judicially. "Many men whose positions
  were secure a little while ago are now on tenderhooks for fear they'll lose
  their jobs, or have to take a cut that will damage their pride and curtail
  their budget. They go about, all day long, smiling and smirking and
  yes-sir-ing and after-you-sir-ing; and when they get out in the street
  they've simply got to compensate for the day's bootlicking. Of
  course&mdash;after they've <i>had</i> the big cut, and are doing twice the
  work for half the salary, then they begin to be a little more considerate.
  I'm afraid I haven't any formula that will explain this part of it. I just
  know it's true. But you can depend on it, young woman, when some big,
  red-faced bruiser tries to run over your toes, with a savage twist of his
  wheel at a right-hand turn, or runs close to the kerb so he can splash you,
  he hasn't got his cut yet, but has spent a bad day of crawling about on all
  fours, hoping to stave it off."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that a pretty low estimate of people's general character?" Phyllis
  had asked, rather ingenuously.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," agreed Sonia, adding dryly, "experience has taught me to
  practice some restraint in making up that invoice."</p>

  <p>This afternoon, perhaps because of fatigue, Phyllis was gradually slumping
  into a mood of dejection such as she had not experienced for many weeks. The
  future looked grey. Her awareness of being utterly bereft swept her all the
  way through. Impulsively she decided to attempt a few minutes with the Dean.
  Happily for her, only one caller remained in the reception-room, and in a few
  minutes her case was dispatched. Mr. Talbot came in, smiled pleasantly, and
  said, "You know the way."</p>

  <p>She entered, slowly crossed the already shadowed room, and, without
  speaking, raised the hand he offered her and held it tightly in both of hers,
  pressing it hard against her throat.</p>

  <p>"Somebody been hurting you?" he asked gently.</p>

  <p>She did not answer for a moment, but stood with downcast eyes slowly
  rubbing her soft chin against the back of his hand. Then, suddenly
  brightening, she shook her head and seated herself opposite him.</p>

  <p>"Everybody's been good to me," she said, forcing a smile. "Sonia
  especially&mdash;Sonia's wonderful. I think these warm spring days make one
  restless. I can't remember ever having been so&mdash;so caged. Does one grow
  more restless, in springtime, as one grows older?"</p>

  <p>"No. It is a physiological phenomenon," replied the Dean playfully,
  "common to later adolescence. By thirty, the attacks are said to be quite
  harmless. I think the actual figures on sad spring poetry report that the
  peak of production is reached on the fourteenth of April by persons in their
  twenty-second year."</p>

  <p>Phyllis pulled a pensive little smile and shook her head. "Twenty-three,"
  she corrected. "Going on for twenty-four.... Going on going where, going on
  doing what, going on being what?... Are you ashamed of me?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not ashamed," mused the Dean, "but I suppose you should be
  quarantined until you get over it. It's contagious."</p>

  <p>"Speaking of quarantine, I've a long letter from Grace."</p>

  <p>"So have I. Good place for her, down there. Valuable institution. There
  ought to be more of them. Perhaps there will be, some day. We can't afford it
  now; have to spend all our money making new trinkets and whim-whams for Mars.
  There has been a great change in Mars. He used to be a brave and burly old
  ruffian who made his own tools; whittled out his bows and arrows; gathered up
  his own stones and clubs. But we've indulged him until he isn't content with
  last year's machinery. We've humoured him with expensive luxuries until I
  fear he has become somewhat of a coward. Quite a different fellow, shooting
  ten-thousand-dollar cartridges at long range, from what he was when he fought
  in the open with a long-handled axe. I'm afraid his character is
  deteriorating.... Well&mdash;what I meant to say&mdash;we'll probably call a
  halt on this big expense, sometime, and that will leave us a little money to
  spend on other institutions. I should like to see a number of walled towns
  built where people may go who can't bear the racket and confusion of the
  modern world. They could study, meditate, create new art-forms, compose
  music, verse, plays, literature. And raise their own vegetables."</p>

  <p>"How does one get in?" inquired Phyllis, falling into step with his
  whimsical mood.</p>

  <p>"I was just coming to that. Whenever a man declares that the world is, in
  his opinion, going to the dickens, and expresses his belief that the times
  are out of joint, he could be sent there for an indeterminate period, exactly
  as we put people away who suffer from any other serious hallucination."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't some people want to go there just because they were lazy?"</p>

  <p>"Doubtless&mdash;but we should have the lazy to keep, anyway," observed
  the Dean. "It would add nothing to the general expense."</p>

  <p>"But," queried Phyllis, remembering the Brook Farm experiment and other
  similar sequestrations, "do you think these maladjusted people, who can't get
  along in the world, could be entirely happy penned up at close quarters with
  one another?"</p>

  <p>"Probably not; but that isn't the point. They would not be at large,
  contaminating persons who are free of the complaint.... My thought is,"
  soliloquized the Dean, "that all our restless people&mdash;particularly those
  given to expressing their views in public places&mdash;should be asked to
  decide whether they wished to be considered a component part of the social
  order, believing in it, hopeful for it, sharing its risks, burdens,
  joys&mdash;not as spectators and reporters but
  participants&mdash;understanding its wistfulness, its infirmities, its
  internal contest of the angel and the tiger&mdash;or preferred to withdraw
  behind some walled enclosure and say, 'Go by, mad world.'</p>

  <p>"I've often thought, Phyllis, that our conventional statements of
  Christian faith are inadequate at this point. We seem to be doing so little
  to improve the public's estimate of our civilization. We practise a very
  faulty psychology, pleading on the one hand for world fellowship,
  neighbourliness, and faith in the ultimate victory of the good, the true, and
  the beautiful, but spending the best of our time and energy rating the world
  for its disabilities. Instead of these flagellations, we should be offering a
  graphic picture of civilization as it stood a hundred years ago, three
  hundred, five hundred, and plot the curve. We've had a lot to say in our
  pulpits and journals of religious opinion about the greed of the so-called
  capitalistic system, but mighty little about free clinics, day nurseries,
  hospitals for crippled children, parks and playgrounds, maternity homes for
  unfortunate girls, and a myriad of rehabilitation schemes which the world
  hadn't dreamed of so recently as a half-century ago.</p>

  <p>"The trouble is, some of us are too impatient. We forget how rapidly we
  have come from the jungle and observe only how slowly we are approaching the
  Golden Age. Or, if forced to admit ourselves better off to-day than men were
  a hundred years ago, we contend that we are standing still <i>now.</i> And,
  of course, this can't be true. Civilization is an organism&mdash;like a tree.
  If it ever is required to give a final account of itself, the Great Forester
  who cuts it down will find on its stump hard, narrow rings made by eras of
  drought and struggle to survive, and broad, pulpy rings left by seasons of
  nourishing rains and easy living, but there will be <i>some kind of ring</i>
  to testify to every year of that growth! At present, we're making a narrow,
  hard, tough one! But it's <i>growth!</i>... Why, can't you see that?"</p>

  <p>For some time Dean Harcourt sat silently contemplating the Holman Hunt
  picture toward which his gaze so frequently wandered when he talked.
  Phyllis's eyes followed his and lingered on the placid face.</p>

  <p>"<i>He</i> wasn't impatient," said the Dean reverentially.</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder a person so sensitive as that didn't run away from it all,
  and live by himself," ventured Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"He did think of it&mdash;once. Don't you recall the wilderness?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;of course! And was tempted to turn stones into bread, so He
  wouldn't starve to death."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a matter of starving. A friend of His had lived out there for
  years&mdash;eating locusts and wild honey.... No&mdash;it wasn't that. He
  went out alone to consider what it was the world needed to make it a suitable
  place for people to live in."</p>

  <p>"And decided that the big thing was bread?" queried Phyllis, with
  increasing interest.</p>

  <p>"Well, He was tempted to think so," answered the Dean, "because He was
  very hungry. For a little while it seemed to Him that if the world could
  solve the bread problem, the other questions would solve themselves. It was
  for bread that nations made war, and neighbours quarrelled, and traders
  cheated, and robbers stole. If you could find some way to feed the world all
  it wanted to eat&mdash;some magical process such as <i>Stones</i>&mdash;<i>be
  bread!</i>&mdash;you would dispose of all the world's grief and confusion and
  enmity in an hour."</p>

  <p>"And I believe it <i>would,</i> too!" declared Phyllis.</p>

  <p>Again Dean Harcourt was silent for some moments, deep in reflection. Then,
  as if returning from a long distance, he said softly: "<i>He</i> didn't think
  so. He considered the world's need from every possible angle and decided that
  <i>bread wasn't the solution."</i></p>

  <p>"But <i>we</i> think so," said Phyllis, <i>"don't</i> we?"</p>

  <p>"Mostly," agreed the Dean. "But fewer people are sure of it to-day than
  ever before.... Now, I have preached to you quite long enough. Let's talk
  about <i>you."</i></p>

  <p>"There isn't much to be said about <i>me</i>&mdash;not after that,"
  Phyllis replied dreamily. "It's a funny thing," she went on, thinking aloud,
  "I get so worried over my own problems, and then, when I talk to you, they
  seem to be so little and insignificant. It's like coming to a fountain when
  you're very thirsty."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you feel that way, Phyllis. But&mdash;I am not the fountain. I
  just lend you my cup."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ALTHOUGH he had been warned that one must arrive early for
  the eleven o'clock Easter service, Nathan Parker was astonished at the
  density of the crowd in which he found himself wedged at ten-forty on the
  broad steps of Trinity Cathedral.</p>

  <p>He was even more surprised at the personnel of this fan-shaped throng
  whose apex poured through the huge bronze doors into the enveloping gloom of
  the Cathedral nave. All about him were interesting and attractive faces of
  people he felt were worth knowing.</p>

  <p>Parker had never given any determined reflection to the matter, but he had
  gathered from innumerable half-contemptuous quips that church-goers, as a
  class, were persons of restricted social interests and dubious mentality, who
  relied upon religious forms to recompense them for their lack or loss of the
  material things which furnish a privileged life.</p>

  <p>The Church, as an institution, had no place in his inventory of
  significant concerns. Never in his life had he entered a church entirely on
  his own initiative or in response to a personal wish. His appearance here
  to-day was pursuant to a promise he had made Elise. Honesty compelled him to
  admit that he hoped also to satisfy his curiosity concerning the man who had
  provided an inspiration for the most charming personality he had ever known;
  but that inquisitiveness would not have brought him to Trinity Cathedral
  to-day or ever.</p>

  <p>That the event, considered as a whole, would be boring, Parker had no
  doubt. He would slip in quietly and share a pew between a straight-lipped,
  whaleboned spinster of the sort dear to the cartoonist and a smug old
  gentleman with white whiskers and a black umbrella.</p>

  <p>It was now quite evident that the mental picture he had drawn of this
  occasion was startlingly incorrect. These people about him, pressing forward
  by inches toward the Cathedral doors, failed to conform to the type that
  dutifully drowsed through tedious sermons in the half-empty and wholly stupid
  church of the 'comics'. In fact, from where Parker stood, the waiting crowd
  graded somewhat higher intellectually, he thought, than an equivalent number
  of people congregated at 8.25 p.m. in the foyer of a fashionable theatre, or
  clustered about the gate leading down to the Twentieth Century Limited.</p>

  <p>A few minutes before, he had sauntered across Madison Park with something
  like a grin, wondering how it would feel to be an integral part of an
  audience composed of the queer, the isolated, the other-worldly. It occurred
  to him now that he might feel a bit more comfortable if he had gone to the
  bother of providing himself with formal clothes. The paragraphers and comic
  artists, he felt, had let him down.</p>

  <p>The pew to which he was shown was well to the back, but his aisle-seat was
  favourable to a comprehensive observation. From overhead in the spacious
  organ gallery drifted music of a quality calculated to build up an atmosphere
  of serenity and reverence. Every appointment of the place was symbolic of
  religious history, memorializing the legends of Christianity and the earlier
  Hebraic culture from which it had derived a considerable amount of its
  emblems and tokens.</p>

  <p>Parker found himself unresistingly relaxing into the hypnosis which, he
  assumed, this environment promised to induce, but retaining enough active
  consciousness to analyse rather uncritically the nature of the appeal made by
  these venerable emblems.</p>

  <p>It seemed clear enough that the towering Gothic arches aimed at the
  dwarfing of the individual. But in what respect would this illusion of his
  own diminutiveness minister to a man's spirit? Of course, reflected Parker,
  the smaller I am, the less important are my perplexities. The smaller I am,
  the lighter my burdens. These tall arches and gigantic pillars invite me to
  look at myself through the big end of the telescope. Thus viewed, my
  anxieties are reduced to a minimum. Doubtless if one considered this matter
  while standing on the pavement in front of the Woolworth Buildings, one would
  entertain the same sensation; for, after all, was this not a mere illusion
  produced by comparative heights and weights? Or was it? Parker half-dreamily
  considered the problem and decided that it would be utterly impossible to
  think such thoughts while under the influence of the Woolworth
  Building&mdash;or the Rock of Gibraltar.</p>

  <p>The organ music continued to pour through the great nave in waves,
  graduated in length and strength with the quality of an incoming tide on a
  level shore, the tempo and urgency of one's reflections measuring to the ebb
  and flow, now inundating one with the roll and break and futile spray of
  elemental problems mounting high and dashing themselves into total
  disintegration by their own weight, now returning quietly to the mystery from
  whence they were derived.</p>

  <p>But, mused Parker, this theory of one's perplexities being diminished by
  the vastly superior height of these Gothic arches cannot have any foundation
  in fact, for the same inverted telescope that minifies my burdens also
  minifies my capacity to carry them, leaving me exactly of the same stature as
  before. My spirit would be dwarfed commensurately with my anxieties.</p>

  <p>Curiously enough, although he was aware of the illusion of diminutiveness
  in respect to his worries, Parker could not sense a relative diminution of
  personal power to deal with them. There must be something in the appeal of
  the Gothic that minifies one group of values leaving other considerations
  untouched, or actually magnifying them. His burdens were dwarfed in the
  presence of these lofty arches, but his capacity to carry burdens was
  undiminished&mdash;increased, if anything. How should one account for it?</p>

  <p>Parker was suddenly struck with the fact that every detail of the Gothic
  worked toward the creation of a majestic, harmonious whole. Not a line or a
  curve or a device had gone into it that distracted from the one inevitable
  demand <i>to be lifted up!</i> The whole task of the arch and every
  infinitesimal detail composing that arch was in reply to the Gothic's <i>urge
  to rise!</i> Therefore, it called to the Gothic element in every man's soul.
  It did not actually diminish the importance of the 'un-Gothic' in one's
  mind&mdash;such as secular worries, fears, chagrins. It so strongly attracted
  and evoked the Gothic properties of a man's life that everything
  else&mdash;including perplexities, terrors, and despairs&mdash;remained
  static, while his aspiration mounted to meet the challenge of this strange
  art-form.</p>

  <p>The windows were crowded with saints who had distinguished themselves for
  wisdom, courage, and sacrifice. They may have been separated chronologically
  by a double handful of centuries, but here in the pictorial windows they were
  nearly enough alike to have been blood brothers of one undernourished family,
  with a strong hereditary leaning toward melancholia and a probable tendency
  to pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

  <p>Taking stock of them by normal standards, Parker decided that none of them
  would be able to qualify for any vocation requiring genius, strength, or
  adroitness. He would have been very reluctant to hire this Peter to lay a
  wall, dig a well, stitch a wound, sing a song, or mow a lawn. But, for all
  that, these ancients had something; no question about that. Query: had this
  'something' been imputed to them by centuries of sacred tradition, or was
  there an intrinsic value resident in these anæmic figures not one of whom, if
  set in motion in our contemporary scene, could earn his daily bread? Parker
  tried to make short work of the whole illusion by accounting for the
  spiritual superiority of these saints on the ground of their antiquity. They
  seemed of another category because they had belonged to remote ages. This was
  sheer nonsense, however, for in that case one would have the same sensations
  in the presence of a sculptured Hercules.</p>

  <p>There wasn't a symbol on the Cathedral dating from a period closer than
  the crusades&mdash;a thousand years ago. It occurred to Parker that this
  place was just a museum. But he knew he had never entertained such thoughts
  in a museum. Now he had it! It was simply an appeal to the æsthetic. But
  this, too, was nonsense. People didn't feel like this in an art gallery.</p>

  <p>The organ had altered its dreamy mood and was introducing the stirring
  measures of an Easter hymn. The congregation stood. A tall young man in
  vestments, bearing a crozier, was moving slowly up the aisle. Behind him came
  the choir in pairs; little boys first, quite angelic in fresh surplices,
  their childish voices shrill. Now the boys were growing taller. Now they were
  grown men. Among the tenors Parker found Elise. He wondered how many of the
  congregation observed that there was a girl in the choir. It was not too easy
  to discover at a glance, with her black bobbed hair and the same uniform. The
  basses rumbled ponderously. "Alleluia!... Alleluia!"</p>

  <p>After a little space, two clergymen followed, and behind them an ethereal
  old man of obvious distinction, gorgeously arrayed. Someone in Parker's pew
  whispered, "The Bishop!" It was pleasant to know that the Bishop was to be on
  duty to-day. Parker had never seen a bishop. He was disappointed, however,
  for he had hoped to have a glimpse of Dean Harcourt.</p>

  <p>The choir was presently swallowed up in the dimness of the distant chancel
  and the ritualistic service began, the Bishop in charge. The beautifully
  gowned woman on Parker's right tried hard to steer him through the maze of
  the prayer book. He felt at a disadvantage. Whenever religion or the Church
  was mentioned in his presence, he had been in the habit of confessing himself
  a 'pagan'. In this declaration of paganism, he identified himself as of that
  genteel company who trust nothing to warm emotions which cannot be accepted
  by cold intellect. It had pleased him to think that he was too sophisticated
  to consider the Church seriously. At this moment, however, dumbly bewildered
  over proceedings which these cultured people understood as thoroughly as the
  alphabet, his appraisal of himself was anything but complacent. He suspected
  that the well-groomed lady whose baffling black book he shared was not saying
  to herself, "The man is sophisticated." It was more likely she was thinking,
  "<i>Gauche!"</i> Parker didn't feel a bit superior; just <i>de trop....</i>
  It made him very warm and uncomfortable&mdash;and humble.</p>

  <p>For a while he was so intent upon his own dilemma that he almost lost
  sight of the goings-on in the chancel. At length they sat, not as people
  poised to rise or kneel, but with an air of relative desistence from their
  duties, and a hush fell over the congregation. The organ&mdash;a generous
  part of whose pipes, Parker had discovered, were located in great alcoves on
  either side of the chancel&mdash;softly modulated into Mendelssohn's "But the
  Lord is Mindful of His Own." He was glad the place was so quiet for the
  opening notes of the solo. He had thought he knew what Elise could do with
  the muted 'cello in her throat, but this heart-stirring diapason of hers
  surpassed anything he had ever heard. Elise had demonstrated, on previous
  occasions, the quality of her contralto, but this was the first chance she
  had been given to set it free in an environment that lent it wings. To
  realize that what Elise had to offer demanded a cathedral!</p>

  <p>It was evident that the organist was deeply moved, too, for when the final
  measure of the solo had been taken, the accompaniment was muted
  down&mdash;and down&mdash;and out&mdash;until nothing was left of it; and
  Elise's golden voice, sustaining the retarded tone, finished alone. You
  hardly knew exactly when the bell-like vibrations ceased. She had stood at
  the end of the choir-stall, facing the audience, and when she sat, there was
  a long, slow intake of breath, almost as if the people had suspended
  respiration throughout this impressive event.</p>

  <p>Another hush settled over the congregation. The two clergymen Parker had
  seen in the processional were assisting a crippled man into the pulpit. He
  grasped the desk firmly with both hands as his aids turned and left him
  there. 'Nobility' was the only word adequate to describe this man's face.
  Parker remembered now that Mrs. Dexter had said Dean Harcourt was a
  cripple.</p>

  <p>The first words were spoken very quietly, their restraint serving to make
  them more unusual than they might have seemed had they been uttered with
  intent to be oratorical.</p>

  <p>"The implications of this hour," began the Dean, "represent the utmost
  reach of human audacity. Men's ambitions, throughout the ages, have mounted
  from their terrains of experience, dearly earned, toward heights of
  achievement, to be as dearly bought. We have warmed our hearths at the
  world's internal fires. We have broken white sunlight into healing rays. We
  have traversed under the water, through the mountains, and in the air. We
  have found antidotes for every poison, anodynes for every pain. Yesterday's
  miracle becomes to-morrow's commonplace; yesterday's luxury, to-morrow's
  necessity. But no aspiration of ours will ever rival the hope we celebrate
  to-day&mdash;<i>immortality!"</i></p>

  <p>Parker no longer attempted to analyse his own thoughts, resigning himself
  utterly to the appeal of the dynamic, pain-scarred, spiritually majestic
  prophet.... A legendary Adam had been expelled from Eden "lest he eat of the
  tree of life and live for ever."... A comprehending Christ, when men
  marvelled at his capacity for surmounting the pains and perplexities of our
  flesh, had said, "Greater works than these shall ye do!" Adam had been
  condemned for inquisitiveness. Christ had said, "Seek, and ye shall
  find!"</p>

  <p>It was like a tonic. It was like an injection of strychnia! It was an
  invigorating breeze rushing through the stuffy darkness of Parker's
  unexplored soul.... "But if ever you are to be immortal," declared the Dean,
  "you are immortal <i>now!"</i></p>

  <p>Never in his lifetime had Parker invested so much mental energy in
  following a public address. Dean Harcourt's words were not mere words as
  words are commonly conceived. They walked up and down on Parker! They lifted
  him out of his lethargy, shook him wide awake, tramped ruthlessly on his
  sophistications, and companionably held out a hand to his despairs. He had
  always presumed that sermons were tedious. This one was now finished, leaving
  him taut as an E string.... God!&mdash;what wouldn't he give for an
  hour&mdash;alone&mdash;with this man!</p>

  <p>As for the rest of it, Parker hardly knew what was going on. They took the
  collection and he tossed in the largest bank-note he had. There was a long
  prayer which he did not follow. The choir was filing out of the stalls and
  into the aisle, singing the recessional&mdash;<i>Jerusalem, the Golden.</i>
  They were out in the spacious vestibule now. The Bishop pronounced a
  benediction.</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt was being led out of the chancel through a side door, two
  young men in vestments supporting him. Parker wished he dared go back there
  and see this man at close range; wanted to take his hand and look into his
  face. Indeed, the impulse was so strong that he tarried indecisively in the
  foyer, jostled from all sides, until the current swept him along.</p>

  <p>The bright sunlight did not eclipse his meditative mood. He crossed the
  street and entered the park, still debating whether to return. Deciding that
  it might be an untimely intrusion, he abandoned the idea with reluctance, sat
  down on a sunny bench, and studied his own mental upheaval, but vaguely
  conscious of the stream of strollers on the broad gravel path before him.</p>

  <p>Parker felt that he had recovered something that offered compensation for
  the most serious loss he had ever experienced. To have looked toward one
  dominant personality for years, focusing one's admiration there, and then to
  have seen that anchorage slip its moorings, had been a catastrophe that had
  shaken his life through and through. In certain bitter moments he had said to
  himself that he would never again risk a similar disillusionment.... But
  to-day another dynamic personality had captured him. There was a peculiar
  spiritual magnetism resident in this man Harcourt. Human life, which had
  recently seemed to Parker a mere matter of reflexes instinctively responding
  to heat and cold, hunger and thirst&mdash;mere motor-replies to the same
  urges that propelled Sylvia, for example&mdash;now appeared as a high
  adventure directed by forces from without. Human interests were more than
  mere elaborations and refinements of jungle necessities and atavistic
  desires. Life had suddenly taken on majestic proportions.</p>

  <p>Until now, spiritual concerns, in Parker's opinion, had been a hazy
  conglomeration of untenable myths and impractical mysticisms. To-day,
  personal power seemed to belong properly among the energies dealt with in
  textbooks on physics.</p>

  <p>Under the dreamy spell of his own reflections Parker became so detached
  from his environment that the people passing by meant nothing but a
  succession of shapes and shadows.... A man drifted out of the stream and
  joined him on the iron bench, but Parker, thoroughly absorbed, took no notice
  of him. Presently the man spoke.</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon," he said, "but aren't you Mrs. Norma Phelps?"</p>

  <p>The reunion with Corley was attended by some peculiar sensations. Not to
  have seen a familiar face for six months, or to have heard oneself addressed
  in terms associated with one's true identity, had wrought changes in the
  lonely man of which he himself had not been fully aware until momentarily
  tugged back into the life he had surrendered. For a little while they tried
  to conduct the conversation in a light bantering atmosphere of persiflage.
  Eugene admitted, under much hectoring, that his business errand in the city
  had been fortunately timed to coincide with Elise's appearance at Trinity
  Cathedral.</p>

  <p>"And did you ever hear anything like it, Newell?" exulted Corley. "She had
  'em completely hypnotized!"</p>

  <p>Newell agreed that Elise had indeed given a very moving performance,
  acquitting herself with high credit, and added: "She would have had to do
  very poorly not to have impressed <i>you.</i> It's easily seen that you were
  in a hypnoid state, at least, when you decided to come."</p>

  <p>"Yes," sighed Eugene comfortably, "She's a great little girl."</p>

  <p>"That settles it," drawled Newell. "When a hard-boiled old thing like you
  calls a grown-up woman 'a great little girl,' it's time to make out the
  commitment papers."</p>

  <p>When, after a while, the talk became serious&mdash;Corley spluttering
  impatiently of Paige's aimless vagabonding&mdash;the vagrant grew restless
  and suggested luncheon. He must go and feed Sylvia, he said.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to tell me that you take that dog along everywhere you
  go?" chaffed Corley.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't seem silly to you," Paige muttered, "if the only thing you
  had left in the world was a dog." Suddenly it occurred to him that this
  statement was giving the lie to his real feelings. Brightening, he queried,
  "What did you think of Dean Harcourt?"</p>

  <p>There was a long silence before Corley answered.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you see"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"all that sort of thing is
  out of my line. I never think about it&mdash;one way or the other.
  So&mdash;my opinion really isn't worth a damn. But I'll say this much: if
  somebody had gone to the trouble of drilling that idea of life into me when I
  was in my teens&mdash;" The sentence was left unfinished.</p>

  <p>"Too late now, eh?" queried Newell moodily.</p>

  <p>"Certainly.... Nobody does any new thinking after he's thirty."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"I mean," explained Corley, "one doesn't do any thinking after thirty that
  demands a brand-new outfit of hypothesis concerning himself and his place in
  the scheme of things. You don't believe it possible, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," answered Paige. "I would give a good deal to find out. I'm
  looking for some new ideas about myself&mdash;and <i>my</i> place in the
  scheme of things."</p>

  <p>Phyllis turned to Patricia and smiled as the congregation rose to go.
  Sonia, at the end of the pew, was leading the way.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I might see him?" Pat whispered. "We could try," said
  Phyllis, detaining Sonia, who nodded agreement.</p>

  <p>They went through a side door from the nave and down a long hall. Mr.
  Talbot was just coming out of the Dean's library.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he would see us&mdash;for a minute?" asked Sonia.</p>

  <p>Mr. Talbot said he would inquire, and reappeared presently telling them to
  go in. The Dean was alone and would be glad to see them, he said. Sonia led
  the way, turning to wink a stealthy 'I-told-you-so' to Phyllis while Pat's
  attention was briefly engaged by some little amenity of Talbot's. They had
  brought Pat almost by force to the Cathedral. "Why, how ridiculous!" she had
  exclaimed at breakfast. "To spend a glorious morning like this&mdash;in a
  musty old church! What must you be thinking of?"</p>

  <p>"But you will hear Dean Harcourt," Sonia had replied. "Phyllis and I think
  no day is quite fine enough to interfere with that."</p>

  <p>After much persuasion, Pat had reluctantly consented to go with them,
  remarking at the Cathedral doors that she would stroll in the park until the
  service was over. At this, they had closed in on her, deaf to her protests.
  Once inside and seated, Pat had resigned herself to the affair rather
  indifferently, but when Dean Harcourt began to speak, she had gripped
  Phyllis's hand. Sonia, stealing a sidelong glance at Pat's enraptured face,
  smiled. The Dean had bowled Pat over completely. It was almost amusing.</p>

  <p>Sonia now led the way into the library. Dean Harcourt had shed his
  surplice and sat at the big mahogany desk robed in his long black cassock.
  The three of them crossed the room and stood before him.</p>

  <p>"We aren't staying long," said Phyllis. "We wanted to present Dr. Patricia
  Arlen."</p>

  <p>Patricia was uncomfortable. The use of her title seemed farcical. In this
  presence she had none of the sensations of a Ph.D., or a college professor.
  Her state of mind was rather that of a small child shyly approaching an
  idolized teacher.</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt held out his hand and she walked around the desk to take it.
  Every well-worn phrase of the conventional prattle employed in receiving an
  introduction seemed either stiffly affected or trivial and inept. While she
  was debating what to say to him, he kindly took the situation out of her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"You are Phyllis's Pat, aren't you? And Sonia's too, I see. I'm glad you
  wanted to come to the Cathedral this morning."</p>

  <p>"But I didn't want to," Pat was surprised to hear herself
  saying&mdash;wondering whether this man's eyes had the capacity to evoke the
  unvarnished truth from everybody as they were now demanding it from her. "I
  never do. They insisted.... But I wouldn't have missed it for anything in the
  world! You were talking directly to <i>me."</i></p>

  <p>"I always preach to myself," said the Dean. "I've found that if I talk
  about the problems that interest me personally, and the hopes that are of
  urgent concern to me, I am likely to make other people feel that I am well
  acquainted with their dilemmas&mdash;and their wistfulness, too."</p>

  <p>"You make people feel as if they all belonged to one family," said
  Sonia.</p>

  <p>"Don't they?" inquired the Dean, artlessly sincere.</p>

  <p>"We seemed so to-day," agreed Patricia.</p>

  <p>Apparently deciding they had had enough serious talk, Dean Harcourt asked
  Patricia how long she was remaining in the city, suggesting that the three of
  them should come to dinner with him on Tuesday evening, an invitation
  promptly and unanimously accepted in face of their remembrance that tickets
  had already been bought for a popular musical comedy that night.</p>

  <p>"Sonia, your shop should be rather quiet on the day after Easter. My
  secretary is to have a few days' vacation and I need someone in the reception
  room to-morrow morning. Could you or Phyllis come?"</p>

  <p>"I want to," announced Phyllis. "May I, Sonia?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, dear&mdash;but you'll not have a very good time. He sees
  nothing but men in the mornings," commented Sonia, with a slow wink. "Are
  they ever interesting men, Dean Harcourt?"</p>

  <p>"All men are interesting, Sonia," declared the Dean, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she agreed. "In the same sense that you would say, 'All men are
  mortal.'"</p>

  <p>"But Dean Harcourt wouldn't say, 'All men are mortal,'" objected
  Patricia.</p>

  <p>"Would <i>you?"</i> he asked gently, searching her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Patricia. "I think I might have said yes if you
  had asked me two hours ago."</p>

  <p>There was a little pause which nobody seemed disposed to make use of. They
  said their good-byes and moved toward the door. Patricia's steps lagged.
  Returning on impulse to the Dean's desk, she said, rather nervously, "I must
  have a talk with you&mdash;please."</p>

  <p>"Quite right. At three&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Eugene Corley had left Paige at the hotel immediately after their
  luncheon, promising that he would preserve from Elise the secret of Newell's
  identity. This problem had not seemed of much importance until now that they
  were all together at close quarters, likely to be thrown into contact at any
  time.</p>

  <p>"I am Parker to you," demanded Newell. "See that you don't make any
  slips!"</p>

  <p>"You are expecting to see Elise, aren't you?" asked Eugene.</p>

  <p>Newell grinned amiably.</p>

  <p>"I think you're better able to answer that question yourself. You have
  probably planned to monopolize all of her time while she's here. I shall try
  to content myself with a telephone conversation. Doubtless she will be
  satisfied with that.... And you can tell her I think she was wonderful
  to-day. That will be true!"</p>

  <p>He had expected to be lonely after Eugene scurried away, intent on his
  engagement. To his surprise he was serenely contented, and glad to have an
  opportunity to resume his thoughts. It was strange how this two-hour
  association with his old friend Corley had reappraised his own personality.
  He seemed to have divested himself of the Parker concept and to have reverted
  to Paige, probably assisted by Corley's frequent use of his name.</p>

  <p>It was as Newell Paige, therefore, that he strolled along the beautifully
  landscaped lake front, Sylvia tagging him rather demurely. He had not talked
  to her very much today.</p>

  <p>Had he seemed preoccupied when Corley was with him? It occurred to him
  that there had been long lapses in their talk. And why wasn't he more eager
  to meet Elise? He had sent roses and a warm note to her by messenger, but had
  no desire to talk with her, or with anyone. Except, of course, Dean Harcourt.
  This idea kept recurring&mdash;his need of an interview with this man who now
  seemed to offer a harbour for his storm-riddled mind.</p>

  <p>If any one had told Paige that he could possibly be gripped by a
  dissertation on 'Immortal Life', he would have grinned. He didn't believe in
  it; didn't want to believe in it; couldn't think of anything less desirable
  than immortal life. The very thought of living for ever made his flesh
  creep.</p>

  <p>The Harcourt interpretation of it, however, had made an incision into the
  problem in an unexpected quarter. The Dean had urged his listeners to be
  "Eternity-minded". "<i>Eternity-conscious</i>".</p>

  <p>"Time that is measured in terms of so many sunrises and sunsets per
  month," Dean Harcourt had declared, "is more of an obstacle than a
  convenience to straight thinking.... What happens to-day&mdash;of good or
  ill&mdash;or what promises or threatens to happen to-morrow, is never of
  enough importance to disturb the ballast of men and women who hold the
  concept of 'the everlasting life'."</p>

  <p>"Has it ever struck you queerly," the Dean had continued, "that every race
  and nation, ancient and contemporary, barbaric and civilized, has possessed
  an inherent desire for and belief in immortality? For the most
  part&mdash;probably because it was so much easier to practise&mdash;the
  people have interpreted this immortality as a continuance of consciousness
  after death. They have dated it from the grave and speculated on it in terms
  foreign to human experience. Only a few, comparatively, make use of the
  immortality concept as a practical measure available <i>here and now.</i>
  Whatever may be the value of it elsewhere, in some other pattern of life, its
  chief benefit accrues to us in our daily living.</p>

  <p>"For Eternity deals with the big issues! They who are Eternity-minded are
  stabilized. Nothing disastrous can happen to them. Their ups and downs
  compensate. They expect their ship to pitch and roll, but they know it will
  not capsize. When some mental, moral, or physical victory is won by a
  group&mdash;for a season&mdash;they do not raise the hysterical shout that
  the Kingdom has come! And when some circumstance has brought on a period of
  savage selfishness, ruthless fraud, and the various phenomena of
  retrogression, they do not whine, 'Lo&mdash;there goes the Kingdom.' If you
  are Eternity-conscious, you are not only insured against transient
  ecstasies&mdash;loaded with the makings of disappointment&mdash;but protected
  against buckling under the strain of some apparent catastrophe.</p>

  <p>"The Eternity-minded do not believe in catastrophes. There is no place in
  their vocabulary for such a word as 'crisis'. In their opinion, what the
  day-by-day and hand-to-mouth opportunists would call a 'crisis' is but a
  phase of <i>the irresistible onward drive!"</i></p>

  <p>Newell entered his hotel after dark, physically weary but mentally alert,
  resolved that he would make an attempt to see Dean Harcourt to-morrow. He was
  not sure what questions he wanted to ask. The main thing was to have a
  face-to-face contact with this man. He understood now the nature of the
  influence that the Dean had exercised over Mrs. Dexter&mdash;one that had
  given her a mysterious radiance. It amply explained her possession of the
  gift she had so often referred to as "personal adequacy".</p>

  <p>Learning after breakfast that Dean Harcourt was available for private
  interviews between ten and noon, Paige had set out for the Cathedral early,
  arriving as the clock was striking ten.</p>

  <p>He had taken Sylvia with him, knowing that she would wait interminably for
  him outside a door or wherever she was told to remain. It seemed very strange
  to be having an errand in a church, and as he rounded the corner and neared
  the Dean's residence he wished for a better knowledge of the procedure and
  proprieties incident to such a call.</p>

  <p>A small printed card in the glass door-panel extended an invitation to
  enter. This unqualified bid seemed broad enough to admit Sylvia into the
  vestibule. At Paige's bidding she crouched on the rug obediently while her
  master proceeded along the hall to an open doorway. He moved slowly,
  adjusting his eyes from the bright sunshine without to the gloom of the rangy
  old house. The reception-room was apparently unoccupied.</p>

  <p>Walking in quietly, Paige saw that he was not alone. A young woman stood
  in the bay at the far end of the room, looking out through the window. She
  was without hat or coat, and evidently belonged to the establishment. The
  sunshine lighted her gold hair. Intent upon what she was seeing or thinking,
  the girl remained unaware of his presence. He walked slowly toward her,
  momentarily expecting her to hear his step.</p>

  <p>His position was bidding fair to produce an awkward moment. To proceed any
  farther in her direction was to take the risk of startling her. To be caught
  beating a retreat would be equally embarrassing. He stood&mdash;waiting. At
  length she seemed to sense that she was not alone and slowly turned her head.
  Paige caught his breath at the sight of her profile. She faced him directly
  now.</p>

  <p>Reconstructing the baffling moment, later, Paige realized that her
  expression of perplexed inquiry was a mere reflection of his own. She stood
  there motionless, unsmiling, with wide eyes and parted lips, while he
  silently regarded her with an amazement quite undisguised. She was the living
  image of Mrs. Dexter as she might have appeared in the full bloom of her
  youth!</p>

  <p>Just how long they stood there staring at each other neither of them knew.
  At length, the girl stirred, smiled tentatively, advanced a short step, and
  said, in a low voice, "You came to see Dean Harcourt?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Paige, still searching her eyes&mdash;the same heavy
  lashes, the same patrician arch of the brows, the same dark-amber iris. "My
  name is Parker," he added. "I am a stranger to the Dean. I do not live
  here."</p>

  <p>"Please sit down, Mr. Parker," she said, with a little indication towards
  a big leather chair&mdash;the same trick of hand that had made Mrs. Dexter's
  brief and restrained gestures so strikingly expressive. "I will tell Dean
  Harcourt you are here." She took a few steps toward the door, his eyes
  following her graceful movement as she walked. Apparently on impulse, she
  halted, faced him again, and said, "I am Miss Dexter."</p>

  <p>Paige bowed and replied, almost inaudibly, "Yes... Miss Dexter."</p>

  <p>Phyllis left the room and started down the hall toward the Dean's library
  in a state of complete mystification. The peculiar experience had shaken her
  a little and her heart was beating fast. Suspecting that her cheeks were
  flushed, she delayed her entrance to the library until she felt herself under
  better control.</p>

  <p>Opening the door and crossing to the Dean's desk, she said, "There is a
  Mr. Parker here to see you."</p>

  <p>The Dean had been poring over a letter. At the sound of her voice, he
  raised his eyes slowly and looked steadily into hers for a moment. Then he
  smiled and beckoned her to come closer. She responded, standing close beside
  his elbow. He took her hand in both of his, raised it closer to his eyes,
  bent back her pretty fingers gently, and inspected her palm after the manner
  of a fortune-teller, pretending to be intently studying the lines. Releasing
  her hand with affectionate reluctance, he nodded, after the manner of one
  confirming a guess, glanced up with an expression of kindly concern, and said
  quietly, "Show him in."</p>

  <p>Making no comment, Phyllis left the room. Dean Harcourt smiled as he
  watched her go, fully expecting her to turn at the door and offer some
  reaction to his playful pantomime, but to his slight surprise she did not do
  so.</p>

  <p>When she returned to the reception-room, Mr. Parker was standing by the
  window where he had found her upon his arrival. She hesitated in the doorway,
  disliking to speak to him from that distance. It would sound too perfunctory.
  She hesitated, also, to cross the room to where he stood, for she did not
  feel herself disposed to face another direct encounter with those searching
  eyes. He glanced in her direction and walked toward her. The barest
  suggestion of a smile was on his lips. It was, Phyllis thought, almost a
  comradely smile.</p>

  <p>"He will see you now," she said, leading the way.</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;Miss Dexter," said Mr. Parker, as they halted before the
  closed door of the library.</p>

  <p>Phyllis glanced up into his eyes and seemed about to speak&mdash;to ask a
  question, perhaps; but, deciding otherwise, opened the door, and without
  accompanying him into the room, closed it softly behind him. Then she walked
  very slowly through the hall, past the door of the reception-room, and toward
  the front entrance.</p>

  <p>Sylvia rose as she approached, and sat on her haunches. Phyllis stroked
  her silky head, murmuring little phrases of friendly attention. Then,
  turning, she went back into the reception-room and preoccupiedly resumed the
  position she had earlier maintained at the window. Presently she was stirred
  from her thoughts by a soft, warm, wet touch on the back of her hand. She sat
  down on the window-seat, and the dog laid its muzzle on her knee.</p>

  <p>"I believe you like me," whispered Phyllis confidentially. "You think you
  know me&mdash;don't you?... Well&mdash;you don't. I never saw you before."
  She toyed with the setter's long ears. "But&mdash;no matter," she murmured
  softly. "I like you&mdash;just the same.... We will be friends&mdash;won't
  we?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DEAN HARCOURT did not extend his hand or offer any word of
  conventional greeting as his caller approached the desk. Pushing aside the
  pile of correspondence and slowly removing his gold pince-nez, he indicated
  the vacant chair near him with a gesture that was hospitable but not
  effusive.</p>

  <p>"And what brings you in out of the sunshine, Mr. Parker?" he asked quietly
  when his guest was seated.</p>

  <p>Perhaps under any other circumstances the direct query, phrased and
  inflected as if acquaintance had already been made, might have helped a
  stranger to proceed with dispatch to a statement of his errand. As the case
  stood, this abrogation of the conventional amenities&mdash;so useful to the
  needs of subterfuge&mdash;left Mr. Parker with an uncomfortably short run for
  his take-off.</p>

  <p>However difficult it had been to look down into the long-lashed,
  amber-tinted Dexter eyes and lie about his identity, it was even harder to
  face the analytical gaze levelled at him from beneath the serious brows of
  Dean Harcourt.</p>

  <p>"My name is Paige, sir," he replied, after a moment's hesitation. "Newell
  Paige."</p>

  <p>The Dean slowly raised his head and seemed to be making a more intensive
  survey of his visitor.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said, with deliberation. "I must have
  misunderstood."</p>

  <p>For an instant, Newell debated the advisability of letting the matter rest
  there, but the cavernous eyes insisted on integrity. They did not pry. It was
  rather as if they entreated.</p>

  <p>"There was no misunderstanding," he found himself confessing. "I did tell
  the young lady that my name was Parker. There are reasons why I
  have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You need not explain," interposed the Dean, "unless it comforts you to do
  so. I dare say your reasons are not dishonourable, else you would not have
  confided your real name.... Tell me why you wanted to see me."</p>

  <p>There was something peculiarly intimate in the tone of the low-pitched
  voice, something almost paternal; not the slightest hint of a reserved
  suspicion or a suppressed curiosity. Paige felt himself in the presence of a
  powerful personality whose scrutiny of him was not that of a photographer but
  rather that of a radiologist. The deep-set, pain-circled eyes seemed to
  ignore such superficial, impermanent phenomena as clothes and names,
  penetrating through to one's durable inner structure.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir," said Paige gratefully, drawing his chair a little
  closer. "I came to see you about your&mdash;about the address you delivered
  here yesterday morning."</p>

  <p>"I observe that you are not in the habit of attending religious services,"
  remarked the Dean dryly.</p>

  <p>"That is quite true, sir. I should be interested to learn how you knew.
  Perhaps I look like a heathen."</p>

  <p>"You referred to my sermon as an address," the Dean explained, with a
  responsive smile. "You were on the point of calling it a sermon, but shied
  off at the word because you dislike to admit that you have any interest in
  sermons. I can't say that I blame you much. Now, just what was it in
  my&mdash;in the address that brought you back to ask questions?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir&mdash;you talked about the terms of a stabilized life. The idea
  attracts me. I wondered if you might not be willing to pursue the subject a
  little further for my personal benefit. I am in need of it."</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt relaxed in his chair, stretched his long arms to full
  torsion, interlaced his fingers behind his head, and gave himself to a
  reminiscent monologue that began far afield from the focal point of
  inquiry.</p>

  <p>"I have not driven a car for many years," he mused companionably. "It used
  to be my favourite recreation. I distinctly recall that when I learned to
  drive, my instructor took me out on a quiet country road in the early morning
  and taught me the rudiments. I think I must have had a natural feel for it
  from the first. Within an hour I was operating my new car with a good deal of
  self-assurance. I could start it, stop it, go forward, backward, and shift
  the gears smoothly. It seemed to me that driving wasn't much more than a
  trick, after all, and I remarked to the man that I thought the difficulties
  of managing an automobile had been largely exaggerated.</p>

  <p>"He said, 'Maybe so,' with a mysterious air of mental reservation, and
  suggested that we drive back to the main highway and see how the new car
  behaved before company. This pleased me very much, for I knew it would be
  more interesting. It was after eight o'clock now and the city-bound traffic
  was in full swing."</p>

  <p>Paige smiled his comprehension of the problem that was about to arise, but
  the Dean carried on with his allegory.</p>

  <p>"Immediately upon being hurled into the ruck of all this confusion, I
  found it difficult to remember what I had just been taught. I became
  nervously sensitive to the swift scurry of cars overtaking and passing me
  from behind at dangerously close quarters and appalled by the threatening
  aspect of reckless monsters bearing down on me from the front. The road
  seemed so narrow and the drivers so unconscionably inconsiderate that I felt
  my confidence rapidly oozing, and at the first corner we came to I turned
  off, slowed my car to a jerky stop, and said, a bit shakily, 'If it weren't
  for the other people!...' 'Yes,' replied the man, with a grin, 'that's about
  all there is to driving a car: the other people.'"</p>

  <p>The Dean disengaged his hands and made a little gesture implying that the
  story should now be able to speak for itself without need of further
  elaboration.</p>

  <p>"I quite agree," nodded Paige, feeling that some response was expected.
  "One never knows what the other people are likely to do&mdash;even one's
  trusted friends.... I have come to believe that it's just as well to assume,
  on the road, that the other people are going to do the wrong thing; don't you
  think so?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied the Dean, "I don't think so. I did&mdash;at first. The man
  ahead of me was my potential enemy. I believed him entirely capable of enough
  absent-minded selfishness to nail his wheels to the asphalt almost any time
  without signalling his intention. And sometimes he did so, obliging me to
  grind hard on my brakes to avoid a collision.... But, after my indignation
  had cooled, I was usually able to recall that in the excitement of protecting
  myself I had quite neglected to let the fellow behind me know what was about
  to happen. And then it would occur to me that perhaps the fellow ahead of me
  had done the same thing.</p>

  <p>"That was a long time ago," the Dean continued. "Experience and
  observation have taught me a few facts in the meantime. I think&mdash;if I
  were able to drive again&mdash;I would try to do it in a slightly different
  state of mind; vigilant, of course, but a little more sympathetic. Instead of
  glaring suspiciously at the back of the other man's head, and wondering what
  species of fool he might be, I believe I would be inclined to appraise him
  now as a person beset by the same conditions which make my own presence on
  the busy road perplexing to all the other people who follow me."</p>

  <p>"You would give the other fellow the benefit of the doubt?" commented
  Paige.</p>

  <p>"It's practically impossible to live a stabilized life in any other mood,
  my friend. Sometimes"&mdash;the Dean went on, soliloquizingly&mdash;"my
  cronies drive me about, and it always interests me to observe their
  respective attitudes toward those with whom they share the highway. One
  friend of mine, in particular, keeps himself in a steaming stew. 'Now
  <i>will</i> you look at <i>that!'</i> he growls, when somebody cuts out of
  line on a hill. 'People like <i>that!'</i> he grumbles. 'They ought to have
  their licenses taken away!'... Well&mdash;perhaps. But the fact remains that
  all sorts and conditions of men are on the road, and it is decidedly in the
  interest of one's poise and peace to accept the traffic problem exactly as it
  is, without too much fretting over other people's bad driving.</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;apropos of stability&mdash;it would be quite simple, at least
  for healthy minds, to manage one's own machinery if it were not for the
  confusion of one's environment and the uncertainty of other men's
  decisions.... But what is more difficult for most of us to remember is that
  we ourselves are contributing to this general confusion. Even the <i>good</i>
  people. Sometimes they add to it at the very moments when they are most
  complacent about their behaviour. They go into the temple to reflect that
  they are law-abiding, generous, just, and fortunately unlike almost everybody
  else. They feel that some merit attaches to the business of being isolated
  from the pack. There is almost no limit to the versatility of human error,
  but <i>this is the great mistake!</i> What we most need to drill into
  ourselves is that we are essentially alike, and that&mdash;in the
  main&mdash;the problems of each are the problems of all. This is the first
  requirement of any man who hopes to achieve poise and stability. If you want
  better information on the matter, I suggest a painstaking study of the Sermon
  on the Mount&mdash;and the poems of Walt Whitman."</p>

  <p>Newell Paige was conscious of registering an expression of surprise at
  hearing these unrelated documents rated in the same category by an accredited
  ecclesiastic. The Dean, prompt to interpret the query on his visitor's face,
  defended his attitude.</p>

  <p>"Many persons," he observed reflectively, "seem to think the only way you
  may do honour to a hero or his deed is by proclaiming him and it unique. Thus
  they try to sublimate the Author of the Sermon on the Mount high apart from
  the ordinary current of human life. I do not believe the Great Galilean
  wanted that. He was too deeply touched with a feeling of our infirmities for
  that. I think He would have liked Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass'. He might have
  regarded it as a fit companion-piece to his own rhapsody, 'Consider the
  Lilies '.... Yes&mdash;shaggy old Walt unquestionably captured the spirit of
  the Master when he wrote, 'Passing Stranger&mdash;you do not know how
  longingly I look upon you. Surely somewhere I have lived a life with you. You
  grew up with me, were a boy with me or a girl with me. I must see to it that
  I do not lose you.'"</p>

  <p>The Dean sat in silence for a while; then, stirring from his reverie, he
  asked gently, "Have I been answering your questions&mdash;at all?"</p>

  <p>"I particularly like the idea about the road, sir," said Paige.</p>

  <p>"It bears acquaintance," nodded the Dean. "Indeed, there is no end to its
  possibilities. Sometimes it is helpful to attempt a mental reconstruction of
  that highway from the very beginning and trace it forward through human
  history. Endless procession. On foot, at first&mdash;barefoot; then
  sandal-shod; then on mule-back. Clumsy wooden sledges, sledges with rounded
  runners, sledges on rollers, rude carts on heavy wheels drawn by ropes.
  Better carts with lighter wheels drawn by horses. Accelerated speed.
  Reduction of drudgery. Motors!... Every little while a radical change in
  methods, manners, mechanisms&mdash;but the same old procession! Ah&mdash;but
  it has passed through a lot of discomfort to come so far! When I review it, I
  know that nothing could possibly happen to me which hasn't happened to
  others&mdash;thousands of times before&mdash;and immeasurably more severe.
  I'm rather proud to belong to the procession. Mighty sound stuff in that old
  parade, my friend! It has travelled a long way&mdash;up&mdash;out of the
  wilderness."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that we evolved from something prehuman, Dean Harcourt?"
  asked Paige, not quite sure whether the question would fit into the
  thoughtful churchman's picture of the valiant pilgrimage.</p>

  <p>"We've been a little inclined to impose on that word 'human'," replied the
  Dean. "It's the arbitrary names we assign to things that fog our thinking.
  We've always done it; have gone to war, again and again, over words and
  names. You may recall that in the legend reporting the creation of Adam, the
  first thing that he did, after surveying his surroundings, was to name
  everything in sight. That has been our chief occupation ever
  since&mdash;naming things, and getting into trouble with one another over
  it.... It's very difficult to fix the day when the remote cave-ancestors of
  Pithecanthropus achieved the right to be called 'human', according to our
  present valuation of that word. It's as difficult as to define the exact
  moment when an unborn child may be properly referred to as a 'human' being.
  Perhaps we might do clearer thinking if we permitted ourselves to speak of
  degrees of 'humanness'. In that case we might say that the uncivilized
  bushman of Central Africa&mdash;engaged in a coco-nut war with the
  baboons&mdash;is slightly less human than we, since he is more at home with
  the monkeys than he might be in urbane society.... But&mdash;let us leave the
  word 'human' out of it for the present, and that will dispose of 'pre-human'
  too. Agreed?"</p>

  <p>"Quite!" Paige found himself heartily enjoying Dean Harcourt's technique
  of clearing away the brush before stating his views.</p>

  <p>"Let us begin, then, with the hypothesis that from the very dawn of
  animate life there was a potential man-in-the-making, related to present-day
  man much as an acorn is related to the oak it is to be. At one phase of this
  creature's upward progress, he closely resembled what we know as the harbour
  seal. Dissatisfied with his ocean, because he was possessed of an instinctive
  urge to escape his limitations, he climbed up on a rock and at the cost of
  who knows how much agony&mdash;endured by generations of his kind&mdash;he
  achieved a capacity for recovering oxygen from the air instead of the water.
  It is quite conceivable that of all these creatures who made the experiment,
  only a comparative few had the fortitude to see it through.</p>

  <p>"The next phase in the evolution of the most audacious was to crawl and
  flop along the ground, inland, nature gradually helping them and their
  posterity to more suitable means of locomotion than flippers. The new food
  demanded new teeth, with a differently shaped oral arch to accommodate them,
  and a larger brain to handle the increasing business of the ambitious
  creature's sensory and motor plexuses.... I feel sure you are familiar with
  this part of the story, but it is possible you have not considered the
  sub-plot.</p>

  <p>"That sub-plot concerns the creatures who were left behind. Some of them
  hadn't the courage to climb up on the rock, at all. Some climbed up and
  stayed a little while, but were glad enough to slip back into their sea. Some
  went through all the suffering necessary to achieve lungs to replace the old
  gills, but hadn't the valour to travel inland. They remained sprawling on the
  rocks, when they were not swimming about with all manner of things more or
  less like them.</p>

  <p>"The most venturesome, then, moved upon the land, leaving the harbour
  seals behind them. I presume you are acquainted with the story of the next
  step."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," ventured Paige. "The foolhardy ex-seal climbed a tree and
  developed legs. Right?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And when, after a few hundred thousand years, he decided to
  climb down and fight it out with the tigers, he left up there in the
  tree-tops a large number of creatures who, like himself, had been brave
  enough to go through all the pain of escaping from the sea, but weren't up to
  the job of forsaking the shelter of the forest. They chattered shrilly as
  they watched this little handful of daredevils build a hut, shape a stone
  axe, and hollow a log into a boat for more ambitious fishing.... Then came
  the day when a smaller selected group decided on a long trek into the distant
  mountains, the large majority voting to stay where they were and take no
  further risks. Those who went forth encountered fresh hardships which taught
  them things they had never known in the jungle and bound them together
  socially for mutual defence. After that the development proceeded with
  rapidity. The primitive and his sons built a habitable house, made a wheel,
  tamed the cattle, turned the soil, sheared the sheep, fired a forge, raised
  an altar, elected a mayor&mdash;and began to pay taxes."</p>

  <p>"His dull friends, back in the woods, were spared the taxes, anyway,"
  observed Paige, with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;they dodged the assessor and occupied themselves with their
  ancient flea-quest.... Now our chief trouble in thinking about evolution is
  that we fail to understand that it is going on <i>to-day!</i> This creature
  with the irresistible desire to rise is still evolving. His physical
  readjustments to meet the imperative demands of new climates, new soils, and
  radically altered modes of existence, seem to have been completed. But that
  does not mean that his evolution is finished&mdash;any more than it means a
  baby's development is finished when the teeth he had cut, at the cost of much
  pain, have turned him from milk to meat. Man's evolution has been operating
  for some time in the field of his mental progress. He is now about to make
  long strides <i>morally!</i></p>

  <p>"The harbour seal who, at a frightful price, learned to breathe, but
  who&mdash;at the one critical hour of deciding whether to justify this
  suffering by going on&mdash;inland, to possess the earth&mdash;is now sadly
  imitated by the people who have endured the pain and grief and anxiety of
  their existence, but lack the courage to proceed toward the achievement of
  that peace and personal power which is their rightful wage. Many people who
  have fully paid for it have no awareness of their own <i>personal
  adequacy!"</i></p>

  <p>"That phrase stirs me, sir," muttered Paige. "I have heard it before."</p>

  <p>"It is very satisfying," remarked the Dean. "I often have occasion to use
  it."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I know." Paige's voice was husky, and he measured his words.
  "The person who offered me that phrase said she had got it from you,
  sir."</p>

  <p>The Dean leaned forward attentively.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to tell me?" he queried searchingly.</p>

  <p>"I had it from Mrs. Dexter&mdash;in Parkway Hospital&mdash;a few days
  before I helped to&mdash;to take her life."</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt folded his arms on the desk and looked Paige squarely in the
  eyes for a long moment.</p>

  <p>"I was never satisfied with the story, Dr. Paige," he declared firmly.
  "There was something very mysterious about it&mdash;even though the
  responsibility seemed to rest on you&mdash;when you ran away. I have often
  worried about you, my son, wondering where you were, and if you were still
  alive.... I confess it was a bit of a shock when you told me your name, a
  while ago."</p>

  <p>"I had not meant to tell you, sir, when I came."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," acknowledged the Dean. "I surmised as much."</p>

  <p>"I should like to talk to you about it. Would it be impertinent if I asked
  you to promise me that you will let me revert to 'Parker' when I
  leave&mdash;and keep my secret?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Dr. Paige. I shall keep your secret."</p>

  <p>"Forgive me for asking. I didn't want to risk an accident that might tell
  Miss Dexter of my identity. Of course," he added, "she might not recognize my
  name." He paused, and, after a considerable silence on the part of the Dean,
  inquired, "Would she?"</p>

  <p>"Yes... she would."</p>

  <p>"She thinks I was responsible for the death of her mother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she does," replied the Dean reluctantly. "But <i>I</i> don't!" He
  raised his hand, and pointing a finger directly toward Paige's face, said,
  almost accusingly, "<i>You took the blame!...</i> I strongly suspected
  it&mdash;all along! Endicott told me&mdash;though he didn't mean to! You were
  a brave fellow! I'm proud of a chance to talk with you!"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I don't feel very brave," muttered Paige. "It's good of you to
  take that view of it, sir."</p>

  <p>"Don't misunderstand me, Doctor. I said you were a brave fellow when you
  shouldered the blame. I'm not so sure you were a brave fellow when you ran
  off and hid. Surely there must have been some better way out of your
  predicament than that! What do you intend to do&mdash;remain a fugitive for
  life?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir." Paige bowed his head despondently. "It's almost
  killing me. I'm not sure how long I can stand it...." Then, shaking off his
  mood of despair, he asked, suddenly, "Is she bitter toward me?"</p>

  <p>"Phyllis?... Yes, and no. If anyone asked her if she thought of you
  bitterly, she would probably deny it. She wouldn't like that word. But she
  thinks you caused her mother's death, through carelessness or ignorance, and
  naturally any mention of your name would be painful.... However&mdash;no
  occasion need arise for any further contacts between you. So that feature of
  your problem need not be worried over&mdash;do you think?"</p>

  <p>Paige raised his eyes to meet the Dean's, was on the point of shaking his
  head, but&mdash;after some delay&mdash;replied, in a tone that was barely
  audible: "I'm not so sure about that.... Mrs. Dexter was one of the most
  remarkable personalities I have ever known. I think my&mdash;my affection
  went out to her more than to anyone else I ever met."</p>

  <p>"And Phyllis resembles her so much that you want to be sure she bears you
  no ill-will&mdash;is that it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;something like that," agreed Paige, confused.</p>

  <p>Had anyone told Newell, an hour earlier, that he was likely to speak of
  his tragedy to Dean Harcourt, he would have thought it quite impossible. But
  now he found himself not only talking about his problem but literally
  forced&mdash;by those demanding eyes&mdash;to tell the story straight!</p>

  <p>"Do you have any theories&mdash;you surely must have some&mdash;about Dr.
  Endicott's reasons for&mdash;for letting you down?" asked the Dean, when
  Paige had finished.</p>

  <p>Newell shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My sympathy is all with you, Dr. Paige. Perhaps, if I were in your place,
  I might find it very difficult to think of any extenuation for your chief.
  But it seems to me that this case calls for a great deal of calm and
  impartial understanding.... Endicott had been building a reputation for many
  years; had come to the height of his powers; couldn't afford to have anyone
  think he was capable of a mistake. A bad state of mind, to be sure, but not
  unique. It's an old man's disease. I think it quite possible that if you
  hadn't left town that day his spirit of decency and good sportsmanship would
  have prodded him into doing the right thing.... But you were gone&mdash;and
  he put it off; and the fact that you had run away made it seem so obvious you
  were to blame. So he never got up the courage to tell the truth. I dare say
  he is a very unhappy man. In fact&mdash;I know he is. When he talked to me,
  on the occasion of an errand he had in the city a few weeks later, he was too
  painstaking in his explanation. It was much on his mind&mdash;festering,
  painfully. Endicott's development came to an abrupt halt on the day he lacked
  the courage necessary to the carrying-on of his evolution. Up to that hour,
  we may say, he had fulfilled the requirements to be a real man! But at that
  one moment of testing, he decided to remain behind. Same old story that we
  recounted of our early ancestors. Endicott, figuratively, had gone through
  all the pain and fatigue of crawling up out of the ocean. He had walked on
  the bleeding stubs of his flippers into the forest. He had succeeded in
  climbing the tree, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But funked it on the day he should have climbed down?" ventured
  Paige.</p>

  <p>"It would seem so.... Now&mdash;will you not try to look at it that way?
  It will ease your mind. I promise you."</p>

  <p>"And I"&mdash;muttered Paige&mdash;"funked it on the day I ran away?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence. The Cathedral clock tolled noon. Paige became
  suddenly aware that he was imposing on Dean Harcourt; had monopolized the
  whole morning. He rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment!" The Dean's gesture commanded him to sit down again.
  "Before you leave I have something further to say to you. I want you to know
  that I am not a stranger to the problem of frustration. It has not been my
  custom to speak of my own dilemmas, but you have a right to benefit by my
  experience. Whatever I have been able to achieve&mdash;in personal poise,
  stability, adequacy&mdash;has come to me by way of the obstacles I have
  met.... This has always been true of men&mdash;since the dawn of the world.
  Emergencies have always been necessary to men's evolution. It was the
  darkness that produced the lamp. It was the fog that produced the compass. It
  was winter that clothed us, hunger that drove us to exploration. The aviator
  can taxi all day on the ground with the wind behind his back, but if he hopes
  to rise he must drive into the face of it. Doubtless you will find a way to
  solve your problem; and, when you do, you will discover that your evolution
  has proceeded faster than could have been possible&mdash;but for this heroic
  test!"</p>

  <p>The timbre of the Dean's voice&mdash;habitually low and
  resonant&mdash;seemed to have changed markedly. His tone was vibrant as he
  proceeded:</p>

  <p>"For your comfort, my son, let me tell you that I have laid hold upon a
  truth powerful enough to sustain me until I die! I know that, in spite of all
  the painful circumstances I have met, <i>my course is upward!</i> I know that
  the universe is on my side! It will not let me down! I have been held up at
  times&mdash;but&mdash;eventually <i>I go on through!"</i></p>

  <p>Paige stared, almost transfixed, and listened breathlessly to the mounting
  crescendo of Dean Harcourt's voice as the masterly, pain-battered prophet
  leaned farther forward over the desk, the deep-set eyes radiant with some
  inner light.</p>

  <p>Supporting himself on his elbows and outspread hands, the Dean seemed
  actually rising from his chair. He was all but on his impotent feet now.</p>

  <p>"<i>I go on through!"</i> he repeated earnestly. "I have
  suffered&mdash;but I know that I am all right.... <i>You</i> have
  suffered&mdash;but <i>you, too, can carry on through!...</i> Take it from me!
  I know! In spite of all the little detainments, disappointments,
  disillusionments&mdash;<i>I get the lucky breaks! I get the signal to go
  forward!</i> I have been
  delayed&mdash;long&mdash;long&mdash;long&mdash;but&mdash;at length&mdash;<i>I
  get the</i> GREEN LIGHT!"</p>

  <p>It was very quiet in the room for several minutes. Dean Harcourt had sunk
  back into his chair, quite spent by his exertion. Newell Paige had an awesome
  feeling that he had witnessed a dramatic episode which very few people would
  have suspected possible of the calm, self-possessed Dean of Trinity
  Cathedral. He had heard men and women casually mumble their "I believes".
  To-day it had been his high privilege <i>to see</i>&mdash;<i>in active
  operation</i>&mdash;<i>the force that propelled a majestic soul.</i>
  Occasionally he had stood in great power-houses, almost stupefied and
  suffocated by the flashing lights and clamorous noise and vibrating
  floor&mdash;watching huge, tortured dynamos hurling forth energy! To-day he
  had seen the Herculean possibilities of a trained human spirit! It stirred
  him to his depths. His voice sounded very unlike his own when he impulsively
  broke the silence, exclaiming, hoarsely, "God!&mdash;<i>I wish I had
  that!"</i></p>

  <p>Newell had taken his departure through the Cathedral nave, and was seated
  on a bench in Madison Park, waiting for the clock to strike the second
  quarter. Then he would go back for Sylvia.</p>

  <p>He felt limp. The close of his interview with Dean Harcourt had been quite
  upsetting to his emotions, and he had behaved in a manner entirely out of
  accord with his customary management of himself. He had been in the act of
  going when the Dean had said, very gently, "Come here, my boy"&mdash;and had
  taken his hand in both of his own.</p>

  <p>It had been such a long, torturing strain, these past six months. He
  hadn't quite realized, until now, how painfully tense he had become, or how
  near to the breaking-point. Dean Harcourt's fatherly tenderness had finished
  him off He had pinched his eyes tight shut and clenched his
  teeth&mdash;but&mdash;damn it!&mdash;the tears would come.... However, the
  Dean understood; knew he was neurally fagged. The Dean wouldn't think him a
  baby. Newell had felt like a little boy&mdash;a weary, hurt, bewildered,
  little boy.</p>

  <p>Now that he was pulling himself together and getting steadied up again in
  the air and sunshine, it occurred to him that he had indeed played a juvenile
  part, especially when the Dean had said, tactfully, "You needn't go out the
  way you came in, Newell.... Take this hall to the right, and leave through
  the Cathedral nave."</p>

  <p>"But I left my dog back there," he had explained, for all the world like a
  ten-year-old. It had helped to clear the air a bit for both of them. They had
  laughed, the Dean wiping his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;go and get him."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I don't believe I can face that girl again, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then leave the dog here," suggested the Dean. "Miss Dexter will be going
  presently. About half-past, I should think. You can come back. We will take
  care of him for you."</p>

  <p>This had sounded sensible. He had made his exit as directed, out through
  the huge front door into the bright noon, into the green park.</p>

  <p>When the bell in the tower had tolled the third quarter, Newell felt that
  he had waited long enough. He was about to rise, when he saw them entering
  the park, Sylvia walking so close that she brushed her tawny flank against
  Phyllis's dress. Very odd of Sylvia and quite out of keeping with her habits.
  His heart pounded as he watched them approaching. He strolled to meet them.
  Phyllis smiled&mdash;the same slow, rather enigmatic smile he remembered so
  well when some bit of playful drollery impended.</p>

  <p>"Really, Mr. Parker, I didn't coax her to come along," said Phyllis
  defensively. "She followed me&mdash;just as if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just as if she knew you were going out to get something to eat," aided
  Mr. Parker, noting her slight flush when the sentence she had begun seemed to
  be getting her into difficulties.</p>

  <p>They were standing face to face now, Phyllis's eyes studying his with an
  almost childish inquiry.</p>

  <p>"I waited for you," she said companionably. "Did you forget the dog?"</p>

  <p>"No... To be quite honest, I wasn't up to seeing anyone&mdash;after I left
  Dean Harcourt. I was going back, a little later, for Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"Funny name for a dog," laughed Phyllis. Then, sobering, she knitted her
  pretty brows, and said, half to herself, "Where <i>was</i> it? Some place I
  heard of another dog whose name was Sylvia...." A little cloud swept her
  face, and she murmured, almost inaudibly, "I remember now," and apparently
  dismissing whatever serious recollection had been stirred, she brightened,
  smiled amiably, and seemed about to move on. "Now that you and Sylvia are
  reunited," she said casually, "I shall go to my lunch."</p>

  <p>He bowed, lifted his hat, and thanked her. Phyllis said good-bye, patted
  Sylvia on the head, and turned away in the direction from which she had come.
  This, too, he thought, was strange. Had she known, or suspected, that he was
  in the park? And had she come here purposely, expecting to find him? He
  stared at her graceful retreating figure for a moment and slowly took a step
  or two. Sylvia, probably supposing her master expected to rejoin her new
  friend, trotted on ahead and was presently at Phyllis's side, where she
  turned to make sure her deductions had been correct. He had stopped now
  indecisively. Phyllis, finding the dog beside her, glanced back over her
  shoulder, smiled, halted. Sylvia, much disturbed, slowly retraced her steps
  to half the distance between them, looking from one to the other. Phyllis
  laughed merrily.</p>

  <p>"Let's all go to lunch together," called Parker, "and afterwards Sylvia
  can decide what she wants to do."</p>

  <p>For a moment Phyllis remained standing where she was, obviously debating
  whether the invitation should be accepted. Parker walked toward her, Sylvia
  gleefully wagging herself almost off her balance.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that I ought to," reflected Phyllis, in a tone that all but
  invited him to counsel her as to the prudence of it. "After all&mdash;leaving
  the dog out of it&mdash;we aren't acquainted, are we?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;we really can't leave Sylvia out of it," admonished Parker.
  "It's on account of her that we are here together. And&mdash;if this doesn't
  sound too silly&mdash;I want to say this is a very discriminating dog, very
  fussy about her friends, and a little inclined to be a snob. Sylvia's social
  approval should be sufficient." He fell into step with Phyllis and they
  walked slowly toward the park entrance.</p>

  <p>"I really shouldn't," she protested mildly, as they waited on the corner
  for an empty taxi. "I promised to meet a couple of friends in town at
  one."</p>

  <p>"Might we&mdash;collect them&mdash;and all have lunch together?" suggested
  Parker, not very enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," murmured Phyllis, with a chiding grin.</p>

  <p>"Why?&mdash;because we're not acquainted?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think that's a good reason?"</p>

  <p>The taxi had drawn up at the kerb, the driver stretching an arm back to
  open the door.</p>

  <p>"Can't you telephone them?" entreated Parker.</p>

  <p>She nodded, and, having made her decision, gave herself to the little
  adventure whole-heartedly. Sylvia, with lolling red tongue, sat on her
  haunches, looking up into their faces with such an absurd expression of
  complacency that it made them laugh.</p>

  <p>"I never saw so friendly a dog," remarked Phyllis. "It's a wonder you can
  keep her from following people&mdash;and getting lost."</p>

  <p>"Sylvia is <i>not</i> a friendly dog," said Parker, turning to look
  Phyllis soberly in the eyes. "She never followed anyone before in her
  life&mdash;and has been almost rude to women."</p>

  <p>"How curious!" exclaimed Phyllis. "She acts as if she had known me."</p>

  <p>Parker was suddenly stirred to remembrance.... He had long since forgotten
  the little episode. One day, in comradely conversation with Mrs. Dexter, he
  had mentioned his dog, and she had expressed a wish to see her. Next morning,
  he had led Sylvia on her leash into Mrs. Dexter's room, where she had been
  patted and talked to almost as if she were a person, an attitude she had
  liked, apparently, since it was much the same as his own&mdash;for he had
  never addressed Sylvia with any of the puppy-talk commonly employed by most
  people in speaking to their dogs.... But it was incredible that Sylvia
  remembered!</p>

  <p>"I feel as if <i>I</i> had known you, too, somewhere," confessed Parker,
  with averted eyes.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it odd?" murmured Phyllis. "I felt that you did&mdash;though I knew
  you were mistaken. And now"&mdash;she went on, rather breathlessly
  reckless&mdash;"somehow&mdash;I feel that way about <i>you!...</i> I can't
  understand it." She glanced up, with a puzzled expression, and let her wide
  eyes ramble over his face, completely unselfconscious. Parker's pulse beat
  faster under her candid scrutiny, and it was quite impossible for him to
  disguise his tender admiration in the responsive look he gave her. Intent
  upon her study of his face, in an effort to recover a recollection, Phyllis
  had not looked squarely into his eyes. She met them now, and was held for an
  instant, her lips parted. She glanced away quickly, and a slow flush crept up
  her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Where are we bound for?" she asked, a bit nervously, searching for solid
  ground on which their conversation might proceed.</p>

  <p>Parker had it in mind to say, "I wish I knew...." Evidently in the anxiety
  of her deciding whether to accompany him Phyllis had not heard his order to
  the driver. "We'll go up to the St. Lawrence&mdash;my hotel," he replied,
  "and turn Sylvia over to the porter. He knows what to do for her.... Then, if
  you are agreed, we will go to a nice little restaurant I know where there is
  quite decent music. Would you like that?"</p>

  <p>"Please," said Phyllis, preoccupied.</p>

  <p>At the St. Lawrence they disposed of the dog, and were presently on their
  way down Lake Boulevard in the swift current of traffic, Parker trying to be
  casual in his talk, regardless of his feelings. Phyllis was finding it
  difficult to share responsibility for their conversation.... At length, as
  they were moving slower in the congestion of the thick traffic area, she said
  abruptly: "I have remembered, Mr. Parker, where I heard about the other
  dog&mdash;Sylvia. My mother, who died a few months ago, wrote to me about it.
  I was in London at the time, and did not know that my mother was so ill. And
  she needn't have died."</p>

  <p>Her voice trembled, and Parker's mouth was dry as he waited apprehensively
  for her to continue.</p>

  <p>"There was a young surgeon, a Dr. Paige. She was so fond of him and he
  came to see her every day. Once he brought his dog. Her name was Sylvia....
  Then they operated on my mother and Dr. Paige helped. He made some frightful
  mistake that cost her life. Of course"&mdash;she went on, brokenly&mdash;"it
  was just a dreadful accident, and he must have been terribly sorry. He ran
  away. They never saw him again."</p>

  <p>She lifted her swimming eyes to Parker's face. It was white and haggard.
  For a long moment, Phyllis stared, frightened. Then, with a slow, audible
  intake of breath that articulated an agonized little "Oh!" she buried her
  face in her hands and shuddered.</p>

  <p>They were approaching a corner now, and, when they slowed to a stop in the
  heavy traffic, she said, in a husky undertone, "Would you be&mdash;just
  awfully hurt&mdash;if I were to get out&mdash;here?... I don't believe I
  can&mdash;I know I can't possibly go on with it.... I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>Newell tried to think of something to say to her, as they stepped out of
  the cab, but no words seemed adequate to express his feelings. It had all
  happened so quickly that, before he realized he was losing her, Phyllis had
  murmured good-bye and sped away.</p>

  <p>He stood watching her until the little red feather on the jaunty black hat
  had disappeared in the milling crowd.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DRIVEN by an almost frantic desire to escape, Phyllis had
  pushed half-blindly into the dense throng of midday saunterers, grateful for
  the shelter.</p>

  <p>At the next corner she turned to the right and with slowing steps and
  trembling knees covered the distance westward to Commonwealth, so upset by
  her unhappy discovery of Mr. Parker's real identity that she took no account
  of her surroundings or the rough jostling she received while passing the exit
  from the roaring elevated railway at grim and grimy Wallace Street.</p>

  <p>On brighter and wider Commonwealth, Phyllis turned again to the right,
  proceeding north in the direction of the largest of the department stores,
  where Pat and Sonia would be waiting and wondering what had become of
  her.</p>

  <p>When nearing this destination, a mirrored glimpse of her heavy eyes and
  drooping mouth discouraged the feeble hope that she might contrive to brave
  it out. While passing the entrance to the Potter House, she had slipped into
  the corridor and touched up her pale lips with a cold, shaky finger, but the
  shock she had suffered was too devastating to be camouflaged with rouge.
  Never had she felt so forlornly desolate.</p>

  <p>Occasionally she paused, pretending interest in an attractive window
  display, trying to gather courage to face the two pairs of solicitously
  inquisitive eyes, knowing all the time that it was quite impossible. She
  practised the smile they would expect, but when she appraised its
  authenticity in the glass it conveyed about as much genuine light-heartedness
  as the grinning bravado of a convict on the way to execution.</p>

  <p>Perhaps if it were either Sonia or Pat, alone, she might have made the
  venture, though at the almost assured risk of being called upon to explain
  what ailed her.... On further consideration, she knew that her problem was
  too complicated, too heavily charged with conflicting emotions, to be
  confided to anybody&mdash;even to Patricia, who knew her through and through,
  even to dear Sonia, whose sympathetic understanding could always be counted
  on, even to the Dean, incomparably kind and wise.</p>

  <p>Phyllis now decided to go home, directing her uneven steps toward Lake
  Boulevard again to take a north-bound bus. There was a renewed surge of panic
  as she contemplated the affrighting possibility of coming face to face with
  <i>him.</i> But it was unlikely. He would be at lunch by now. Unhappy,
  doubtless, though still able to eat. Men were said to be that way. As for
  herself, the thought of food was intolerable.</p>

  <p>When the traffic changed she crossed with the stream of pedestrians to the
  east side of the street and took her position at the kerb where the bus would
  stop. It suddenly occurred to her now that Pat would unquestionably return to
  the apartment in a little while. She didn't want to see Pat&mdash;or
  anyone.</p>

  <p>The famous Art Institute, only a minute's walk, offered sanctuary. She
  decided impulsively to go there and make an effort to compose herself.
  Phyllis was not a stranger to this interesting place. Frequently she came
  here to look at the pictures and other noted art objects. Her favourite room
  was the big, two-storey hall which housed massive replicas of heroic
  statuary, medieval tombs, shrines, sculptured facades. An open hallway, after
  the manner of a viaduct, transversed the great room on the second floor,
  narrow stairs descending from it. Standing now on this bridge, and about to
  go down, Phyllis moodily surveyed the huge plaster reproductions which rose
  impressively from the ground floor below.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she started, pressing her white knuckles hard against her
  agitated lips, for at the south end of the spacious hall, he was slowly and
  dejectedly pacing back and forth, his head inclined, eyes fixed on the
  flagging, his soft grey hat crushed under his arm, hands deep in his coat
  pockets.</p>

  <p>Furtively, self-defensively, Phyllis retreated on tiptoe out of range,
  tarrying for a brief instant in the broad doorway of the corridor to look
  down with brooding eyes. Safe within the arch, she stopped, tugged off her
  hat, and nervously swept her forehead with the back of her wrist as if to
  erase the painful scene on which she had unwittingly intruded, reflecting
  that she had no right to witness his agony, however desperate her own might
  be. A wave of something like compassion overwhelmed her.</p>

  <p>For so long had the name of Newell Paige been indissolubly associated with
  her mother's tragic death that it had acquired, in Phyllis's memory, a
  peculiarly sinister quality, symbolic of an inexcusable and irreparable
  disaster. She had never tried to visualize him. To have given Newell Paige,
  in her imagination, a concrete face and form, would have been as unthought-of
  as to attempt a mental materialization of Nemesis, Mythol, or Karma. Just his
  name&mdash;that was all&mdash;a name that served as a sort of arbitrary
  algebraic symbol for the catastrophe that had destroyed everything she had
  held dear. Sometimes she had made an attempt to resolve that frightful
  combination of circumstances into its component parts. Doubtless her
  indulgent father's self-destruction was to be partly accounted for by his
  financial losses, perhaps Grace's retirement from normal life was destined to
  happen, anyway, possibly her mother might have died of her disease in any
  event&mdash;but, after she was all done trying to disentangle the various
  factors of the problem, the final result was <i>Newell Paige.</i></p>

  <p>The fact that her mother's reported interest in him had been but little
  short of maternal devotion was completely shadowed by the stark calamity in
  which he served as axis, core, and pivot. Granted that it was an
  accident&mdash;it was one of those accidents whose recollection sears
  everything it touches.</p>

  <p>Phyllis had never harboured the fear that they might meet&mdash;it was
  reasonably sure that he would keep his distance. Now&mdash;the whole Paige
  concept had been radically altered for her. It suddenly occurred to her that
  her mother&mdash;if she could be aware of it&mdash;would be deeply grieved
  over this wretched situation. Suppose it <i>were</i> her mother, instead of
  herself, who had come here and found Newell Paige disconsolately lonely,
  tortured by the ineradicable memory of his fatal blunder. What would
  <i>she</i> do? Or, suppose her mother&mdash;by some means aware of their
  strangely spontaneous mutual interest, and the unfortunate discovery that had
  destroyed it in a flash&mdash;were to walk in here to-day and take stock of
  their misery. Phyllis could hardly imagine her mother doing otherwise than
  taking each of them by the hand and delivering them to each other.</p>

  <p>For an instant she was gripped by an almost uncontrollable urge to run
  down the stairs and apologize for the pain she had caused him. She even
  ventured a step in that direction; then clutched at the wall, frightened.</p>

  <p>At length she went with spiritless, uncertain steps to the picture
  galleries. Seating herself in a room temporarily free of visitors, she tried
  to bring her turbulent mind to order. Sooner or later she must return and
  account for her strange behaviour, and the longer she remained away, the more
  explaining she would have to do. She had, she felt, caused enough distress
  to-day without adding anything to it unnecessarily. But for a full half-hour
  she sat there dully staring at canals and clouds in the Netherlands, and a
  Spanish dancer, unsympathetically gay with her fan and castanets, whose
  derisive, disillusioned mouth seemed about to inquire whether Phyllis hadn't
  better get to the root of the matter, with ruthless honesty.</p>

  <p>Searching herself critically, Phyllis was obliged to admit&mdash;though
  this candid analysis made her cheeks burn&mdash;that her heavy anxiety to
  relieve Newell Paige's mental agony was inextricably tangled with the
  undeniable fact of her personal feeling for him. This sentiment she now tried
  to assay. It wasn't, she told herself confidently, a mere physical
  attraction. His being six feet tall and strikingly handsome, really,
  truthfully, had nothing whatsoever to do with it, she said. It wasn't a
  matter of his being urbane and distinctly of her own world. Nor was it his
  slow smile, his curious trick of brief but singularly expressive gestures,
  his serious, searching eyes that rambled all over your face and came to rest
  in the exact centre of yours&mdash;not impudently, but earnestly in quest of
  you. No&mdash;it was his tenderness.... She could account for that now,
  though it had puzzled her at the time. He knew who she was and wanted to tell
  her how sorry he felt.... But&mdash;wasn't it a little more than that? When
  she talked, he had watched her lips with a queer little smile in his eyes. He
  had liked her. She knew that.</p>

  <p>Phyllis glanced at her wrist-watch. It was two-thirty now and high time to
  go, yet she found it very difficult to venture out into the corridor. The
  long emotional strain had made her an easy victim to a peculiar
  hallucination. For the past few minutes she had been increasingly sensitive
  to the shadows moving across the open doorway. Something inside her had begun
  to urge an attentive interest in these shadows cast by people strolling
  through the corridor. A timid little obsession maintained that presently one
  of these shadows would materialize into a person who would enter by that
  door.</p>

  <p>So strong had this expectation grown that Phyllis knew she would have to
  take herself severely in hand to move in that direction. She would meet him,
  she knew, directly in that doorway. It became so real that she vividly
  experienced it in imagination. Mentally she crossed the room, heart pounding
  hard. In the doorway she encountered him, face to face. For a long minute
  they stood staring into each other's eyes, Phyllis trying to wink back the
  hot tears. He held out both hands to her, and she, trying desperately to
  breathe through the sob that nearly suffocated her, gave him her hands, and
  whispered, "I'm&mdash;so awfully sorry."</p>

  <p>The powerfully realistic little drama left her wet-eyed, limp, and
  nerveless. Summoning all her resolution, Phyllis rose unsteadily and walked
  toward the door, certain that the stirring day-dream would actually come
  true.</p>

  <p>But no one met her there. She drew a deep breath, not quite sure whether
  she was disappointed or relieved. Then, straightening, she achieved the
  briskly assured stride habitual with her, and proceeded, chin up and eyes
  clear, down the corridor, her competent heels clicking regularly and
  determinedly on the marble floor, and thus into the outer air.</p>

  <p>The incident of her discovery of the real Newell Paige was now definitely
  closed. It was inconceivable that she would ever see him again. The
  conditions that would keep them apart were insurmountable, irrevocable. But
  she had, Phyllis felt, gained something of value by this chance meeting,
  however painful had been its eventuality. She had been relieved of a
  self-poisoning aversion. Hereafter, the name of Newell Paige would not be an
  embittering symbol for the chain of disasters that had made her life
  difficult. From now on, she told herself, his name would stand for the one
  enchanting half-hour of singularly sweet comradeship&mdash;an event to be for
  ever cherished, though never repeated.</p>

  <p>Finding the apartment unoccupied, Phyllis went directly to the telephone
  and called Sonia at the shop. It comforted her to find that Sonia had not
  been very much upset by her failure to appear, a complacency probably
  accounted for by the news with which she was bubbling&mdash;Andy Norwood had
  invited the three of them to have dinner with him.</p>

  <p>"Tell Pat to prettify herself," advised Sonia.</p>

  <p>"Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"Having a talk with the Dean. Didn't you know?"</p>

  <p>Phyllis remembered now, thinking it odd that she had forgotten about Pat's
  engagement to go, this afternoon, to Trinity Cathedral. For it had been much
  on her mind, yesterday, and she had wondered what might happen
  there&mdash;reproaching herself for wishing she might be a mouse on that
  occasion. To-day's strange events had swept it all from her memory.</p>

  <p>Breathing more freely, now that attention had been diverted from her
  unusual behaviour, Phyllis became almost light-hearted, made herself an
  egg-nog, and took pleasure in putting the apartment to rights. She carried
  her mother's photograph to the window and looked at it for a long time. Then
  she went with it to the mirror of her vanity-table and sat down to study her
  eyes. The likeness had never before seemed so uncannily identical. Perhaps
  her own experience to-day had matured her eyes a little, or at least had
  offered a hilltop glimpse of a destination to be arrived at in due
  time&mdash;something like the feeling of autumn briefly sensed on a crisp
  early morning in latter August.</p>

  <p>Exploring the box of rather pitiful little keepsakes in her trunk, Phyllis
  re-read her mother's long letter&mdash;her last one&mdash;in which there had
  been so much of Newell Paige, his almost obsessive interest in his
  profession, the high opinion in which he was held by Dr. Endicott who, she
  understood, had already nominated the talented young surgeon as his successor
  when the time should come for his own retirement.</p>

  <p>"I think it quite beautiful&mdash;almost touching," continued the
  letter&mdash;"this relationship between these two brilliant men. Whenever Dr.
  Endicott's name is mentioned, Dr. Paige reacts to it much as an exceptionally
  devoted son might speak of an admired and revered father. I gather that he
  thinks Dr. Endicott is working too hard."</p>

  <p>Phyllis lifted her eyes and stared at the wall, her thoughts busy
  elsewhere. Then she shook her head, reluctantly, and read on.</p>

  <p>"It occurs to me also that this charming young fellow lives a very lonely
  life without quite realizing how completely his duties have cut him off from
  the interests and associations a man needs, especially at his age. Everybody
  seems to like him tremendously, but nobody, apparently, gets very close to
  him. He often talks about his love of music, occasionally dropping remarks
  which indicate that he is well posted. I asked him once if he had ever
  considered music as a profession. His eyes widened as if the thought had
  never before crossed his mind, and he replied, 'Oh, dear, no! There's never
  been anything but this&mdash;not for a minute!' Every morning, in fair
  weather, his dog comes along to the hospital and sits waiting in his car. I
  told him I wished I might see his dog, not imagining that he would give my
  casual request another thought. Quite to my surprise he brought her up to my
  room&mdash;a beautiful red setter named (if you will believe it) Sylvia! If
  he has any other intimate friends I do not know about them.</p>

  <p>"You will be wondering why I go on chattering about this lovable boy (for
  in spite of his professional dignity he is, at heart, very boyish), but I
  can't help thinking about him. There are so many wide-open gaps in his
  experience of life. Thoroughly materialistic, and on the surface cold-blooded
  as the Sphinx, but giving himself away, every little while, as a sensitive,
  wistful fellow in great need of something to tie up to besides tinkering
  people's organs into proper running order. I already have a promise from him
  that he will come to see us some time when we are all at home again. I think
  you would like him."</p>

  <p>Phyllis folded the letter and replaced it with the others in the box. Her
  mother seemed very near, to-day. And her bereavement swept over her almost as
  if she were fully realizing it for the first time.</p>

  <p>Pat was now quietly letting herself in, very deliberate about taking off
  her things. Phyllis called, but received no answer. Presently Pat appeared in
  the doorway of the bedroom.</p>

  <p>"Hello, darling," said Phyllis, over her shoulder. "Did you have a nice
  visit with the Dean?"</p>

  <p>Pat nodded, rather pensively, and turned away, Phyllis following her into
  the living-room, where they sat down together on the sofa.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't talk about it&mdash;not just yet," said Pat, in a
  muffled voice. "I've been up above the snow-line&mdash;in a strong gale...
  almost <i>too</i> refreshing&mdash;up there. Air very light&mdash;makes you
  giddy. Makes you feel heavy when you come back to sea-level.... I'll be all
  right... but don't ask me anything about it."</p>

  <p>"I know, dear," sympathized Phyllis. "He does that to people. I'm glad you
  went. Aren't you?"</p>

  <p>Pat's face had been averted, but now she turned slowly to confront Phyllis
  with cloudy eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure yet," she replied hesitantly. There was a long pause.
  "God!&mdash;it's a frightful price!" she suddenly muttered, as if to herself.
  "And&mdash;if I can't afford it&mdash;I'm worse off than I was before I saw
  him.... That man's <i>hard!"</i> She pressed her finger-tips so deeply into
  her temples that they left little chalk-white marks.</p>

  <p>"You needn't try to tell me, dear." Phyllis affectionately patted the
  shapely arm. "There are plenty of things one can't talk about. Believe
  me&mdash;I know!"</p>

  <p>Pat's wan and puckery little smile hinted that an inexperienced young
  thing like Phyllis was hardly in a position to understand the full
  significance of her own platitude. A great deal of water, remarked the brief,
  bitterish smile, would have to go over the dam before Phyllis
  Dexter&mdash;dimpled and rosy and twenty-three&mdash;could realize what it
  meant to have a double handful of deep-rooted fixations ripped out of your
  viscera or wherever they were located, and every dangling, aching, red nerve
  fibre of them coolly examined under a microscope.... Phyllis interpreted the
  smile, and returned to her room wearing one that looked very much like it.
  She too&mdash;if Pat only knew it&mdash;had been pretty thoroughly ploughed
  up since they had breakfasted together.</p>

  <p>"Pat!" she called, after some minutes had passed. "We're dining with Dr.
  Norwood. Sonia telephoned."</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>"Even if you don't feel quite up to it, Pat, better make the effort. Sonia
  will be frightfully disappointed, you know."</p>

  <p>There was a stir in the living-room, but no reply.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather be shot, myself," pursued Phyllis, from the depth of her
  clothes-closet. "I've had a rough day, too, I'm telling you!"</p>

  <p>"Very well," came Pat's weary voice resignedly. "But I don't feel very
  playful."</p>

  <p>"Of course you don't, but we mustn't let Sonia down. She's counting on
  us.... What are you going to wear&mdash;so our colours won't fight?" Perhaps
  this query might prove diverting, Phyllis thought.</p>

  <p>"How about sackcloth and ashes?&mdash;both of us."</p>

  <p>Phyllis grinned. The sardonic note in Pat's voice was encouraging; sounded
  more natural. Pat strolled in and sat on the bed.</p>

  <p>Sonia now arrived breezily, glanced suspiciously from one to the other,
  drew a long face, and intoned lugubriously, "If there are no further remarks
  concerning the deceased, we will now repair to the cemetery."</p>

  <p>"Sonia!" chided Phyllis. "Pat's been talking to the Dean."</p>

  <p>"I know it, and I've a notion she feels as if she'd been tugged feet-first
  through a knot-hole.... I had that experience, Pat, and damn near cried my
  eyes out for three days. But you're a lot steadier person than I am, and
  you've just got to pull yourself together! You're going to meet my Andy
  Norwood. And he's quite a dear&mdash;if I do have to say it myself."</p>

  <p>"How silly!" chuckled Pat. "Sounds as if you'd brought him up&mdash;from
  the bottle."</p>

  <p>"Well," blurted Sonia, "when I began to take charge of Andy, he was
  nothing but one of those dry old university professors! couldn't talk about
  anything more recent than the French Revolution. Now he can dance&mdash;'n'
  everything.... You go and take a hot bath and a half-hour's rest."</p>

  <p>Unable to withstand Sonia's blithe commands, Pat yielded and was presently
  splashing in the bathroom.</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> must have had an exciting day, little one," began Sonia, when
  they were alone. "One o'clock&mdash;we were hungry as bears&mdash;I called up
  the Cathedral office to see what had become of you. Mr. Simpson answered;
  said he had seen you going down Marlborough a few minutes earlier accompanied
  by a red dog. Is Simpson crazy&mdash;or am I?"</p>

  <p>"A little, I should say&mdash;both of you," replied Phyllis
  "but"&mdash;her voice grew confidential&mdash;"there was a red dog. Her name
  was Sylvia."</p>

  <p>"Sylvia!&mdash;a dog?... Well&mdash;go on. But it doesn't sound the way it
  ought to. You wouldn't try to spoof me; would you?"</p>

  <p>"There was a Mr. Parker came to see the Dean. He left his dog in the hall.
  After two hours he escaped by the front entrance. Sylvia remained. About
  half-past twelve I went to the Dean's library&mdash;the other man who had
  come to see him had given it up and gone away&mdash;and, finding Mr. Parker
  was not there, I said, 'He forgot his dog.' 'Perhaps he will
  remember&mdash;and come back,' the Dean said."</p>

  <p>"Why should <i>you</i> have cared?" demanded Sonia meaningly. "It must
  have been an uncommonly attractive dog."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Phyllis absently.</p>

  <p>"So was Mr. Parker&mdash;I'll bet you a pair of gloves!"</p>

  <p>Under this affectionate but relentless inquisition, Phyllis proceeded to
  narrate her strange encounter with the absent-minded Mr. Parker, the amusing
  circumstances of his inviting her to go with him to luncheon, their taxi
  drive to the St. Lawrence Hotel with the dog&mdash;"and&mdash;and
  then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But this is <i>most</i> exciting!" beamed Sonia, as the reel snapped,
  leaving the story hung up in mid-air. "And then&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Phyllis, a bit frightened, busied herself with a rearrangement of the vase
  of blue irises on the table, Sonia watching with shining eyes.</p>

  <p>"So then," she continued reminiscently, "we drove to a little French
  restaurant that he knew of&mdash;it was in Hayes Street."</p>

  <p>"How funny!" interposed Sonia. "In <i>Hayes</i> Street&mdash;of all
  places."</p>

  <p>"Yes," lied Phyllis gallantly, her voice trembling a little, "and we
  had&mdash;let me think&mdash;a caviare canape&mdash;and sherry&mdash;and an
  omelet&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And one of those sweet wooden pancakes on fire, I suppose," assisted
  Sonia, eager to push on with it.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;<i>crêpes suzette....</i> And then we danced&mdash;there was
  very nice music."</p>

  <p>"Good dancer?" wondered Sonia, to which Phyllis replied with a nod and a
  brave though not very convincing smile, still fingering the flowers. "Did you
  like him?" persisted Sonia. "Of course I see you did. You look no end
  guilty."</p>

  <p>Pat, in her dressing-gown, rejoined them at this juncture, to Phyllis's
  immeasurable relief, Sonia suggesting that she follow Pat's example. As soon
  as the door closed on Phyllis, Sonia perched on the arm of Pat's chair and
  grew suddenly confidential.</p>

  <p>"Look!... Phyllis met a man to-day, more or less by accident, and he seems
  to have put her in some kind of trance. I gather that they fell for each
  other&mdash;hard. For he took her to lunch on short notice, and she was
  terribly fussed when she tried to tell me about it&mdash;leaving big chunks
  out of the story, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And probably," drawled Pat, "putting big chunks <i>in</i>."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless&mdash;and I don't blame her, for I had her on the run, and she
  was doing her best to dodge me. Well, it has just occurred to me: this chap's
  a gentleman, obviously&mdash;and I'm going to ask Andy if he won't try to
  connect with him and ask him to the dinner to-night. Wouldn't that be fun?
  We'll say nothing to Phyllis&mdash;and there he'll be!"</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," reflected Pat. "If everything was in order, I
  don't believe Phyllis would have found it so hard to tell you. She's been
  quite upset about something. Maybe she doesn't want to see this man. Better
  ask her&mdash;don't you think?"</p>

  <p>Sonia impulsively went to the bathroom door, rapped, opened it an inch,
  and called, above the racket of the shower, "Phyllis! Will it be all right if
  Andy asks your Mr. Parker to dinner to-night?"</p>

  <p>There was a protracted silence, during which the water was shut off, and
  much swift thinking could be imagined.... Pat closed her eyes, shook her
  head, and felt that Sonia's well-meant interference in this affair was
  turning out badly.</p>

  <p>"He won't come," said Phyllis, as from a long distance. "Thanks, all the
  same, Sonia. Don't bother, please." The shower came on again noisily.</p>

  <p>"They've had a tiff," growled Sonia. "It's a beastly shame! She has been
  the loneliest thing, restless, discontented as a fish out of water&mdash;and
  here comes the first man she's had any interest in&mdash;and something silly
  has turned up to make them peeved at each other."</p>

  <p>"If we knew a little more about him&mdash;" speculated Pat.</p>

  <p>Muttering something unintelligible that began with "damn," Sonia walked
  determinedly to the telephone, called the Cathedral, and got Mr. Simpson,
  who, locating Dean Harcourt in his private rooms, put him on the line.</p>

  <p>"Sorry if I'm a nuisance," she began, "but our Phyllis met a Mr. Parker by
  mere chance to-day. He'd been calling on you. Forgot his dog. That's how it
  came about. I would like to include him in a little dinner-party to-night. Is
  he all right? Know anything about him? Shall I ask him?"</p>

  <p>Pat listened attentively to the resonant voice of the Dean, plainly
  audible from where she sat. Sonia's eyes were brightening.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I know him.... He is all right; I would have no hesitation
  about inviting him to <i>my</i> house."</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" exclaimed Sonia. "Maybe you <i>will</i>&mdash;tomorrow
  night!"</p>

  <p>"I'll&mdash;see," hesitated the Dean, after a lengthy pause.</p>

  <p>After Sonia had put down the receiver, she sat for a while with puzzled
  eyes, tapping her knuckles against her pretty teeth.</p>

  <p>"Pat," she said seriously, "we've stumbled into a secret. Parker is all
  right&mdash;fine fellow&mdash;good enough to be invited to the Dean's
  table&mdash;<i>but not to-morrow night."</i></p>

  <p>"Better let it go now," advised Pat, "before you get yourself in a
  mess."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," declared Sonia. "I'm going to see it through!"</p>

  <p>Taking up the telephone again, she found Norwood, explained that Phyllis
  had made a delightful new acquaintance, and easily secured his consent that
  Mr. Parker should be asked to the party.</p>

  <p>"It's a bit late to invite him," commented Norwood. "He probably has
  something else to do; but I'll call him.... St. Lawrence&mdash;did you
  say?"</p>

  <p>Phyllis, emerging from the bathroom, found Sonia at the telephone-desk in
  a tense attitude of expectancy. She glanced from one to the other
  inquiringly, and Pat, feeling she should be loyal to her hostess's
  well-intended intrigue, no matter how much she privately doubted the wisdom
  of it, explained, "We're going to have a pleasant little surprise for you in
  about a minute."</p>

  <p>The telephone bell jangled, as if to offer prompt confirmation of this
  threat, as Phyllis stood wide-eyed and undisguisedly apprehensive of whatever
  dismaying plot might have been contrived in her behalf.</p>

  <p>"He left the hotel about an hour ago," boomed the friendly voice of Andy
  Norwood. "Didn't say where he was going and left no forwarding address.
  Phyllis must have had a bad effect on him. Perhaps he jumped in the
  lake."</p>

  <p>Sonia begged his pardon for the trouble she had caused him and
  clatteringly dropped the receiver into its slot.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, with an air of finality, "that's that!... Your Mr.
  Parker has left town."</p>

  <p>"I could have told you that," replied Phyllis quietly, "and saved you all
  this bother."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Sonia's inflection hinted at a trace of chagrin over her audacity in
  trying&mdash;with so little co-operation&mdash;to accomplish a generous deed.
  "So he told you he was leaving&mdash;at once?"</p>

  <p>Two pairs of affectionate eyes waited, watched, and wondered, Phyllis
  realizing that she had misled Sonia into an awkward situation. Impetuously
  deciding that the truth was now demanded, she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "He didn't."</p>

  <p>Sonia rose with a little gesture of bafflement and sauntered toward the
  door. Pausing, she grinned rather sheepishly and facing Pat remarked in the
  approved manner of litigious dryness, "You may take the witness.... The State
  rests."</p>

  <p>Phyllis quickly followed her into their bedroom, put an arm around her,
  and murmured: "Darling&mdash;I didn't mean to hurt you. But I simply couldn't
  see him any more. Can't you understand? Forgive me for not telling it all
  quite&mdash;quite as it was. I couldn't!"</p>

  <p>"It's not your fault at all, Phyllis," conceded Sonia gently. "I was a
  meddlesome Miss Fixit.... But I thought you really liked him and I wanted to
  do you a good turn. You know that; don't you, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sonia&mdash;of course!" Phyllis hugged her close. "But&mdash;please!
  Let's drop it now&mdash;and never speak of him again."</p>

  <p>Shortly before five on Tuesday Phyllis went to the Cathedral, relieved to
  find that the last caller for the day was just leaving. Dean Harcourt was
  alone in the library. Crossing to where he sat at his desk, she stood very
  close to the arm of his chair, almost childishly waiting for him to say
  something.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;you delivered the dog to Mr. Parker," he said, at length,
  looking up into her moody eyes. "They told me the dog was in your company
  when you left, and there has been no report that Mr. Parker returned to claim
  him."</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Phyllis. "We met in the park."</p>

  <p>"Pleasant fellow."</p>

  <p>"Very."</p>

  <p>"Something tells me you rather liked Mr. Parker, Phyllis."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid he deceived you. His name is not Parker."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that? Did he tell you?"</p>

  <p>"No. Not directly. But I have reasons for being quite sure that is the Dr.
  Paige who ran away after he made that terrible mistake in Mother's
  operation."</p>

  <p>"Does Mr. Parker know that you suspect him of being this Dr. Paige?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I'll tell you all about it," said Phyllis, seating herself
  opposite him.</p>

  <p>It was quite a long story and not an easy one to tell, especially the part
  in the Art Institute. Several times Phyllis stopped and waited so long that
  it seemed the story was ended. Then she would compose herself and continue.
  At length she relaxed in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," reflected Dean Harcourt, "you would have done better to obey
  your impulse. I agree with you that your mother, under such circumstances,
  would probably have gone to him and relieved his mind."</p>

  <p>"But I'm a <i>girl!</i> I couldn't!" she protested, with swimming
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm not chiding you, my dear," assured the Dean kindly, "but it seems to
  me you might have approached him&mdash;seeing how distressed he
  was&mdash;with some little token of your sympathetic feeling for him."</p>

  <p>"That's just <i>it!"</i> Phyllis expostulated. "If it had been only a
  matter of forgiveness, but&mdash;" She dropped her eyes and her voice lowered
  almost to a whisper. "I liked him&mdash;very much&mdash;and I'm afraid he
  couldn't help knowing it.... That put me in an&mdash;an awkward position to
  go to him&mdash;about <i>anything....</i> If it had been the other way about,
  and he had come to me&mdash;it would have been different."</p>

  <p>There was a little silence, and Phyllis, coming to attention, seemed
  struggling with a desire to say something more&mdash;something that was
  difficult to express.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind if I asked you a question?" she entreated.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the Dean. "If it's the question I think you are going to
  ask, I would indeed mind&mdash;very much. You mustn't."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I suppose not." She brightened a little and began tugging on her
  gloves. "Forgive me&mdash;won't you&mdash;for asking?"</p>

  <p>"You didn't ask, Phyllis."</p>

  <p>"That's true." She rose to go.</p>

  <p>"We'll be seeing you to-night at our dinner?" said the Dean.</p>

  <p>She nodded, patted his hand, and crossed the room. At the door, she
  paused, smiled, and said softly, "I'm glad he wanted to tell you all about
  it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN her gentle and modest way Mrs. Crandall felt that she was
  an efficient hostess, and enjoyed a secret pride in her accomplishments at
  the other end of Dean Harcourt's table. But to-night she had occasion to
  question the infallibility of that sixth sense on which she had long relied
  for guidance in the suitable seating of his guests.</p>

  <p>At five-thirty she had written their ten names on as many slips of white
  paper, spreading them out on her tidy desk and jockeying them into position
  with a due regard for their respective superiority, their precedence in
  relation to this particular affair, and their probable congeniality.</p>

  <p>She had always been exceptionally good at this, even when her knowledge of
  a dinner's personnel was so sketchy that she had little more than instinct to
  direct her, plus the practical belief&mdash;which Mrs. Crandall confidently
  carried into her various undertakings&mdash;that all things work together for
  good to them that love God, including such minor articulations as the one in
  which she was at that moment engaged.</p>

  <p>Because they were interesting out-of-towners, it was clear enough that
  Professor Patricia Arlen and Miss Elise Graham should be seated at their
  host's right and left. The distinguished lawyer whom the Sinclairs were
  bringing&mdash;probably a business friend of Mr. Sinclair&mdash;might find
  Miss Arlen an enjoyable companion. Sonia Duquesne, whose sparkling small-talk
  could be counted on, should assist in this entertainment of Mr. Corley, with
  Dr. Norwood at her right of course, for these two must not be separated.
  Doubtless their friendship would have flourished amazingly by this time.</p>

  <p>The Robert Sinclairs, man and wife, Mrs. Crandall proposed to take care of
  herself, for she wanted to discuss with them the urgent need of a new rug for
  the large sitting-room in the Parish House. Mr. Talbot, at the right of Mr.
  Sinclair, would be primed in advance to assist her in this worthy cause, and
  since Talbot wouldn't relish the job she would put Phyllis Dexter next to him
  as a reward of merit. Simpson, on the other side of Phyllis, could amuse this
  Miss Graham whenever the Dean might be engaged in learned talk with Professor
  Arlen.... So&mdash;there you are, said Mrs. Crandall to herself, and a very
  nice arrangement too, she added, quite erroneously.</p>

  <p>It was not until they were seated and the grace had been said and the soup
  had been served that Mrs. Crandall began to suspect her hitherto dependable
  instinct of having fallen asleep while on duty.</p>

  <p>Sonia was saying to Dr. Norwood, "You and Patricia must have had a
  wonderful time this afternoon. She came in simply beaming!"</p>

  <p>And Dr. Norwood, purringly pleased and self-conscious as a cat caught in
  the cream, had replied, "Indeed?" with such unsuccess at casualness that he
  had hastened to add in a confidential tone, "It was a great day for
  <i>me,</i> Sonia."</p>

  <p>"I asked her," Sonia was continuing, teasingly, "how she liked the new
  University Library&mdash;you were to have taken her there, you
  remember&mdash;and she looked a bit dazed for a minute, and then said,
  'Oh&mdash;<i>that.</i> It's quite wonderful, isn't it? I mean&mdash;we didn't
  get there. Drove up to Lake Grove, instead. Everything so beautiful!
  Marvellous!' Andy, I told you the right woman would show up, some day....
  <i>Didn't</i> I?" she persisted, when his reply had been slightly delayed by
  a sip of soup. Dr. Norwood grinned amiably, nodded an indulgent affirmation,
  and leaned forward a little to see how Miss Arlen was getting on. But he
  needn't have been exercised for fear she lacked attention. Mr. Eugene Corley
  was seeing to that&mdash;and no mistake! At the moment, Mr. Corley was making
  an audacious pretence of confiding something of an amusing nature into the
  pretty pink ear of Miss Arlen, during the Dean's temporary occupation with
  the Kentucky contralto.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Crandall's brief absorption in this little drama had been made
  possible by Phyllis's replies across the table to maternally solicitous
  queries from Mrs. Sinclair, and Mr. Talbot's dissertation to Mr. Sinclair on
  the dry-fly as a preferential trout-bait. She reluctantly detached herself
  when Mrs. Sinclair, leaning close, mumbled, "We've been in an odd tangle,
  this afternoon."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Crandall, with the pursed smile and far-away look of one roaming
  about with an exploratory toe for the elusive bell-push-button, said,
  "Oh?"</p>

  <p>"You know Elise Graham is just as good as engaged to Mr. Corley... didn't
  you? Well&mdash;they are. That's why he is in town, really. They've been
  together almost constantly. And they had arranged to see each other this
  afternoon at three. Mr. Corley had a luncheon engagement with some old
  college friends who kept him so long that Elise&mdash;who is rather
  impulsive&mdash;thought he had forgotten. So she was out when he arrived.
  They haven't seen each other since&mdash;not alone, I mean&mdash;and I
  observe that there is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Danger of a slight frost to-night," cannily assisted Mr. Sinclair, as Dr.
  Norwood, at that unpropitious moment, turned to make himself agreeable to his
  hostess. "We occasionally have them," amplified Mr. Sinclair, "late as the
  middle of May." He raised his bushy brows to Dr. Norwood, who felt obliged to
  confess he'd never noticed.</p>

  <p>So <i>that</i> accounted for what was going on at the other end of the
  table. Mr. Corley was proving by his gaiety that so far as he was concerned
  there was peace on earth and good will among men, nor did any constraint
  exist between himself and a fellow creature.</p>

  <p>And Miss Graham, not to be outdone by this geniality, was demonstrating a
  guileless gladness that would have made a surly cynic of Pollyanna. Elise
  had, it appeared, been just now receiving much adulation for her singing on
  Sunday&mdash;Simpson, really, was an awful blarney&mdash;and the table,
  gradually drawn into it, was making appreciative little noises in
  confirmation of this tribute which she well deserved, for she had indeed sung
  beautifully, and it was no more than fair, Mrs. Crandall thought, that Elise
  should have the entire stage to herself while she took her bow.</p>

  <p>She accepted the applause very prettily, and began replying to queries,
  the Dean's first, who wanted to know something about life in little Leeds;
  and Simpson's, who hoped she would give them the high lights on her recent
  spectacular début in Louisville. Perhaps it was the proprietorial complacency
  of Mr. Corley's expression that determined Elise's decision to share her
  honours with her valued friend, Nathan Parker, who, she gratefully conceded,
  was responsible for her success, and without whose timely assistance she
  might have gone on for life unrecognized. She spoke his name softly,
  caressingly.</p>

  <p>"Tell them about him, dear," urged Mrs. Sinclair. "I think it is <i>so</i>
  interesting," she added, intimately and with promising little nods to Sonia,
  whose eyes she had happened to pick up at the moment.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;to make a long story of it&mdash;" began Elise, girlishly
  ingenuous. "Nathan Parker mysteriously dropped in at Leeds, late last autumn,
  on no particular errand, accompanied by a lovely red setter."</p>

  <p>"I <i>say!"</i> piped Mr. Talbot's Oxonian treble. "Dashed if that isn't
  odd! Wasn't that the chap's name, sir, you said would return to claim a dog
  he'd left here yesterday? He must have come back while I was out."</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt seemed unimpressed by this coincidence, returning his
  attention immediately to Miss Graham, implying with a nod that her narrative
  had the right of way. Simpson was observed to be grinningly mumbling
  something into Phyllis's ear which brought a quick flush to her cheeks and an
  entreating glance toward Sonia whose alert eyes registered a knowledgeable
  interest.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;by Jove!" went on Mr. Talbot, blinkingly suspicious of this
  by-play of Simpson's, "you must have seen him, Miss Dexter&mdash;and the dog,
  too. Whatever became of him&mdash;the dog, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Better tell him," growled Simpson, "so Miss Graham can proceed. It's his
  British instinct. Once he gets hold of an idea, you might as well help him
  work it out, for there's no peace until&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's no secret," said Phyllis evenly. "The dog insisted on going along
  with me when I left, and we met Mr. Parker outside."</p>

  <p>"Then that can't possibly be my Mr. Parker," commented Elise decisively,
  "though it is a fact that Nathan Parker is in town; I hope to see
  him&mdash;to-morrow. But I happen to know that Sylvia wouldn't walk away with
  anyone.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia!" exclaimed several voices in various pitches of incredulity.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and a one-man dog if there ever was such an animal. If Sylvia
  were going to follow a stranger&mdash;which she wouldn't&mdash;I'm sure it
  would not be a girl. She hates women. I saw her nearly every day for months
  and she never thawed&mdash;not the least bit."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Crandall thought she observed a little smile playing about Phyllis's
  eyes which were raised to meet Sonia's. And Sonia, looking into them, was
  replying with a slow sly wink.... This whole affair was becoming more
  complicated every minute.</p>

  <p>"That point being cleared up, then," the Dean was remarking quietly, "Mr.
  Nathan Parker arrived in Leeds, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And lived at my Uncle Clay Brock's hotel," continued Elise drily, the
  interruptions seeming to have dampened her enthusiasm. "Naturally&mdash;we
  met, and&mdash;well"&mdash;she hesitated, lowered her eyes shyly, and groped
  her way&mdash;"that's about all there is to it. Nat took an interest in my
  voice and arranged everything for my recital in Louisville.... And my
  grandfather liked him so much that&mdash;that we saw quite a lot of him."
  There was another pause, accompanied by a delicious telltale confusion which
  fetched a high-keyed "<i>Ah-ha!"</i> from the privileged Talbot, followed by
  a brief outburst of merriment. Elise, it seemed, had unwittingly given
  herself away.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what she's up to&mdash;the little rascal!" muttered Mrs.
  Sinclair out of the corner of her mouth.</p>

  <p>"Punishing Mr. Corley, I should say," reflected Mrs. Crandall.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;she musn't!" decided Mrs. Sinclair. Raising her voice, she
  said sweetly, "Oh&mdash;do tell them, Elise, how Mr. Parker helped your
  grandfather the time he fell ill while putting on a cast... <i>such</i> a
  droll story, Dean Harcourt."</p>

  <p>Elise, who had recovered now from her embarrassment, told it all and told
  it well&mdash;the interesting case of the Potts fracture&mdash;"Really, the
  very worst kind of break there is, Grandpa says"&mdash;and how, by sheer
  accident, and not knowing a blessed thing about it, Nat had successfully
  applied the cast.... During this recital, Sonia's eyes never left Phyllis's
  face, and Phyllis's eyes did not rise from her plate.</p>

  <p>"I <i>say!</i>&mdash;but that <i>was</i> odd!" squeaked Mr. Talbot.
  "Incredible! Maybe the chap <i>was</i> a doctor!"</p>

  <p>Elise shook her head, smiling tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"My grandfather would have known," she said. "Wouldn't he, Dean
  Harcourt?"</p>

  <p>"One would think so," agreed the Dean, politely but rather
  non-committally. Sonia still intently studied Phyllis's face, and Phyllis,
  actively interested again, had turned her eyes questingly toward Dean
  Harcourt, who, briefly encountering them, gave his attention to Miss Arlen,
  his attitude seeming to say that we could now do nicely with another topic of
  conversation. Mrs. Crandall had definitely decided that there was a great
  deal going on at this party.</p>

  <p>Dr. Norwood, in excellent spirits on arrival, was taciturnly tinkering
  with his fork. Sonia had left off prodding him back to life and was herself
  preoccupied and demure. Phyllis was seeing ghosts. Talbot, probably still
  pondering over Mr. Parker's lay performance of difficult surgery, was
  blinking rapidly in that curious way he had when agitated and perplexed, a
  nervous batting of the eyes that twitched his nose, rabbit fashion. Mr.
  Corley, whose exact relation to other objects was in doubt, smiled glassily
  as if in a mood to welcome good tidings from almost any quarter.</p>

  <p>"And how is our little Celeste?" inquired the Dean jovially, rousing
  Norwood to attention.</p>

  <p>"Quite contented, sir, in Miss Warren's school."</p>

  <p>Patricia leaned forward, smiling interestedly.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Norwood's little girl," explained the Dean, "contributed a valuable
  thought to a weighty discussion here, some weeks ago."</p>

  <p>"It was also the <i>final</i> thought on that occasion," remarked
  Sonia.</p>

  <p>"<i>Most</i> amusing!" said Talbot, who was requested to describe the
  event for the benefit of the party. It wasn't too easy a job, but Talbot
  managed, general laughter rewarding his tale.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," observed Norwood, "Celeste's droll comment suddenly
  terminated a stimulating discourse at a point of absorbing interest. As Mr.
  Talbot has said, Dean Harcourt was declaring, or at least strongly
  implying&mdash;if I misquote you, sir, please correct me&mdash;that a whole
  generation may be involved in a violent clash of opinion, apparently of local
  and transient significance, and never live to realize that their fanatical
  struggle was of signal importance to the progress of civilization. I
  remember, sir, that I was eager for this question to be pursued."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" called Mr. Sinclair, "I think we should all like to hear
  something of the sort from the Dean."</p>

  <p>Attention promptly centred on Dean Harcourt, who sat for a moment with
  narrowed eyes apparently debating a suitable point of departure toward the
  suggested talk.</p>

  <p>"It all gets back at last," he began thoughtfully, "to the engaging story
  of the Long Parade. We must break our bad habit of talking about human
  progress as if it were a gradual upward journey from the jungle to Utopia. It
  isn't quite as simple as that. We'll have to think of that upward course in
  terms of planes, as if mankind proceeded on a series of steps up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Like climbing a terrace?" asked Mr. Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Exactly! The half-dozen generations comprising a certain era will move
  along rather uneventfully, at times almost apathetically, on an approximately
  level plane. The upheavals, revolutions, and excitements of climbing up out
  of the era immediately preceding will already have become legendary. In this
  particular economic and political system that we are considering, customs
  crystallize rapidly into laws, the laws take on dignity and resolve
  themselves into codes, constitutions, charters. Manners beget morals.
  Traditions become established. After a while, there is a well-defined group
  of reliances: the State, the Church, hero worship, ceremonials; standards of
  beauty in art, standards of gallantry in conflict, standards of social
  conduct, standards of intellectual fitness. Very well. Then&mdash;when
  everything has become neatly integrated and the Parade has had its relatively
  serene period of recuperation from the now almost forgotten struggle of the
  climb to the level on which it is travelling, it wants to look out!&mdash;for
  the time has come for the taking of another steep grade!</p>

  <p>"Customarily, these sharp ascents have been made within the space of a
  single generation. Sometimes it has taken a little longer&mdash;but not
  often. The people who are called upon to make the climb up to the next level
  unquestionably get a more comprehensive view of the great plan for humanity's
  eventual destiny than is possible for the people who live midway in an era
  when things are, as we would say, normal. In the course of this rough
  scrambling up to the next plane of living, practically all of the old
  reliances are under heavy stress. Long-respected statutes are found to be
  obsolete and obstructive. Emergency measures of an economic nature inevitably
  upset the morals which had prevailed&mdash;for the ethical imperatives of a
  given time are, in most cases, the product of economic conditions. Cherished
  dogmas, vital and useful yesterday but now defunct, are skinned and stuffed
  for museums. Art&mdash;supposedly long-lived, in relation to the fleetingness
  of Time&mdash;yields to the clamour for reappraisal, along with everything
  else.... A hectic period that does strange tricks of transformation to the
  people appointed to go through it..."</p>

  <p>"Appointed?" asked Patricia.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;think so," declared the Dean, measuring his words. The room was
  very quiet. "Yes," he repeated, after a little silence, "I think so...
  <i>appointed</i> to go through it."</p>

  <p>"Because they're stronger, better, fitter?" wondered Talbot.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not necessarily. And not appointed as individuals. The time had
  come for another step upward. The era&mdash;as an era&mdash;had&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Had done its stuff," suggested Corley, as the Dean hesitated
  momentarily.</p>

  <p>"Exactly! If a fair judge were to have analysed its personnel, perhaps it
  would be seen that if all the people participant in that era were as
  forward-looking as three per cent of them, the era would have been much
  shorter, and if all had been as sluggish as half of them, it would have been
  longer. But&mdash;taking the era as a whole, it now had&mdash;as Mr. Corley
  puts it&mdash;'done its stuff'.... No, Mr. Sinclair, the people who happen to
  be in the line of march when destiny determines that a step up is to be taken
  may be no better, no stronger than their fathers; no fitter than their sons.
  They just happen by chance to be members of the Long Parade when it arrives
  at the foot of the ascending hill."</p>

  <p>"Hard on the old folks," grinned Mr Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Quite!... Whatever sympathy may be felt for bewildered youth on these
  occasions, the people in the Parade who find the climb most difficult and
  painful are the mature. For they have learned all they know about living
  under the more or less stable and predictable regimentation of the long
  plateau over which they have come. It does strange things to them, as
  individuals. The same degree of heat required to refine gold will utterly
  consume a pine forest&mdash;and that doesn't mean that a pine forest is of no
  value. In such periods of transition many individuals who, in a normal time,
  might have been very useful, crumple into defeat. Many others who, under
  normal conditions, might have lived mediocre lives, endure the unusual with
  high distinction."</p>

  <p>"Proving," reflected Mr. Sinclair, "that the race is not to the swift or
  the battle to the strong."</p>

  <p>"Under ordinary circumstances," the Dean observed, "that old saw is backed
  by a substantial element of fact. During the period of taking a hill, all the
  old saws are valueless."</p>

  <p>"And then the good people and the wise people get their innings?" piously
  inquired Elise, whose conservative religious training inspired her to think
  it was about time for the Dean to be insisting on something of the sort.</p>

  <p>"That's where most of the trouble comes from, my dear, on these difficult
  ascents. The old standards have been tossed aside. The good people and the
  wise people who had earned their reputation for goodness and wisdom by
  steadfastly maintaining that twelve inches make one foot, and a penny saved
  is a penny earned, and that children should be seen but not heard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And a woman's place is in the home," aided Sonia.</p>

  <p>"Where charity begins," added Talbot.</p>

  <p>"And ends," remarked Patricia.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said the Dean, "all of you.... These wise and good are usually
  persons of ripe age who have become incapable of drastic readjustments."</p>

  <p>"Which gives the youngsters a chance," declared Simpson brightly.</p>

  <p>"Who are too immature," said the Dean, "for such a responsibility.
  So&mdash;they all go scrambling up the hill, everybody talking at once, very
  shrilly. And, at length, they reach the top and come out upon a broad
  plateau; write off their losses, tie up their bruises, mend their tattered
  boots, and the Long Parade trudges on. New customs settle into laws. New
  codes are framed. New constitutions written. New moral standards agreed
  upon... and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Another half-dozen generations of <i>that,"</i> assisted Norwood.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and when everything has become nicely articulated again in that
  era, so that the people know practically what to expect of their
  institutions, their schools, their banks, their parliaments, their methods of
  transportation, communication, propaganda, social welfare; then you need to
  look out! It's about time to take another step up!"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;we're taking one <i>now!"</i> exclaimed Elise, wide-eyed.
  <i>"Aren't</i> we?"</p>

  <p>"And we're having coffee in the drawing-room," announced Mrs. Crandall,
  who for the past ten minutes had been on the edge of her chair waiting for a
  semicolon to appear. Simpson chuckled merrily. She felt like shaking him
  sometimes. And he knew it, too!</p>

  <p>They all rose, and Simpson stepped to the back of the Dean's wheel-chair,
  prepared to guide it out of the room. Dean Harcourt raised his hand and they
  came to attention, grouped near the doorway.</p>

  <p>"A moment&mdash;before we leave this," he said soberly. "As Miss Graham
  has just observed, we are taking one of these steps now. It isn't asked of us
  whether or not we would like to be members of the Long Parade during this
  brief period of hard climbing. We <i>are</i> members of it. And the only
  option extended to us, as individuals, is our privilege to determine whether
  we prefer to be <i>dragged up</i>&mdash;in which case we are an obstacle and
  a liability&mdash;<i>or to go under our own power.</i> Some of us&mdash;like
  my good Simpson&mdash;will have to give others a push, now and again.... Very
  well, beloved," he finished, giving Simpson's hand an affectionate pat, "lead
  on.... We will have our coffee now."</p>

  <p>Patricia, standing close to Norwood, who had moved at once in her
  direction, laid her hand on his arm, and murmured, "Isn't he superb?"</p>

  <p>"If we were all like him," rumbled Norwood, "there would be no plateaux.
  We would climb&mdash;directly&mdash;on&mdash;up!"</p>

  <p>Phyllis lagged as the others filed out of the dining-room.</p>

  <p>"May I help too?" she asked tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Simpson," said the Dean, over his shoulder, "think up some little errand
  for yourself. I want to ask her a question."</p>

  <p>With a companionable wink at Phyllis, Simpson sauntered toward the door
  and waited. Dean Harcourt's eyes twinkled. Taking Phyllis's hand, he drew her
  closer and she bent over him, listening.</p>

  <p>"Did Sylvia snap at you?" he asked, barely above a whisper.</p>

  <p>Phyllis shook her head and pinioned a smiling lip with a row of pretty
  teeth.</p>

  <p>"No," she answered, flushing a little. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"I just wondered," said the Dean drily. "She hates women.... Simpson!" he
  called, "we're ready now."</p>

  <p>They saw Pat off on the midnight train for the East&mdash;Sonia, Phyllis,
  and Norwood. At the gate Sonia said, "We can't all go through. You take her,
  Andy." He had smiled his gratitude.</p>

  <p>Their steps grew shorter and slower as they walked down the platform
  towards Pat's carriage.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what will come of that?" speculated Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"Vacancy on the Vassar faculty," said Sonia.</p>

  <p>Pat and Andy had stopped now and were shaking hands. Then Pat waved a hand
  to Sonia and Phyllis. Andy followed her into the car. The porters shouted
  "All aboard" and tossed their portable steps into the vestibules. Andy
  stepped down as the train began to move and waited until Pat's car had
  passed, holding out a hand towards her window; then, with squared shoulders
  and shining eyes, he came back to the gate.</p>

  <p>"We didn't like to say good-bye to Pat, did we, Andy?" teased Sonia
  gently, slipping her hand through his arm as they moved towards the taxi
  stand.</p>

  <p>"'<i>Au revoir</i>,'" corrected Andy. "That's what we said to Pat."</p>

  <p>Then he rode home with them, a trip distinguished for the long lapses in
  their conversation. They bade him good night at the door of their apartment
  house, and the taxi scurried away with him.</p>

  <p>Each being busy with her own thoughts, no communication was established
  between Sonia and Phyllis for the first ten minutes, except the exchange of
  weary smiles when they collided at the open doors of the clothes-closet.</p>

  <p>"How did you like Miss Graham?" inquired Sonia, rather indistinctly, with
  her pretty black velvet half off over her head. "Unhook me, won't you? I seem
  to be caught."</p>

  <p>"I thought she had a lovely voice," said Phyllis, attending to the task of
  setting Sonia free. "And she played her own accompaniment beautifully."</p>

  <p>"She knows your Mr. Parker very well, it seems."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Phyllis, slipping into her kimono. "Odd&mdash;wasn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I gathered that a good deal of that was for Mr. Corley's benefit,"
  pursued Sonia, busy with her hairbrush. "She was taking him for a ride."</p>

  <p>"I felt a little like a passenger, too," confessed Phyllis, "part of the
  time."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you think that yarn was exaggerated&mdash;about Mr. Parker's
  setting that badly broken leg?"</p>

  <p>Phyllis, sitting on the edge of her bed, continued patting her face with
  cold cream, silent so long that Sonia slowly turned towards her
  inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Phyllis absently.</p>

  <p>"It didn't sound right to me," declared Sonia. "I don't believe anyone
  would have known how to do that&mdash;not the way she told it&mdash;but a
  surgeon."</p>

  <p>"He <i>is</i> a surgeon," muttered Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"Then she was just stringing us about Mr. Parker?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so.... I don't believe she knows much about him."</p>

  <p>"You do&mdash;apparently."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I know that much about her Mr. Parker. He is a surgeon."
  Phyllis rose and strolled towards the door leading to their living-room. "And
  his name is not Parker... I think I'm ready to tell you all about it now,"
  she added unsteadily.</p>

  <p>For a half-hour they sat facing each other on either end of the sofa,
  their feet drawn up under them. Phyllis reciting from the beginning all that
  she knew about Newell Paige, Sonia infrequently venturing a query. Mrs.
  Dexter's final letter lay open between them.</p>

  <p>"I know how painful it must be," said Sonia gently, "for you to be
  reminded of the operation, but do you think you could recall the details of
  it just as Grace gave them to you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think Grace knew very much about it," replied Phyllis, with a
  deep sigh. "She and Father and the nurse went up with Mother to the
  operating-room&mdash;or to a little room connecting. And while they waited,
  Father was called to the telephone. Mother had been taken in, and was under
  the operation when he returned. Father seemed very much excited. Grace didn't
  know at the time what troubled him. Of course they were both anxious and
  nervous because Mother was in there. They walked to the end of the hall, she
  said, and waited. Father was white and shaky."</p>

  <p>"You said Grace saw Dr. Paige for a moment just before the operation. Did
  she say whether he was upset or excited?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;she didn't notice anything like that. The nurse said they were
  being delayed a little because Dr. Endicott had been sent for to go to the
  telephone."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it queer," speculated Sonia, "that he should be doing any business
  on the telephone at the moment when everything was set for an
  operation&mdash;patient waiting&mdash;and all that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"Emergency call, perhaps," thought Phyllis. "Maybe it was the same
  emergency that took your father to the telephone."</p>

  <p>"It's quite possible," Phyllis agreed. "I recall now&mdash;Grace told me
  it was reported that Dr. Endicott lost nearly everything he had, that
  day."</p>

  <p>Sonia shifted her position, leaning forward, her arms folded, her brows
  contracted studiously.</p>

  <p>"Let's try to organize a little picture, Phyllis. Dr. Endicott is getting
  to be an old man. Everything he thinks he owns is tied up in stocks. He is
  just ready to go into a difficult operation. He is called to the telephone
  and told that he hasn't a dime left to bless himself with. He is an older man
  than your father&mdash;and you know what that same news did to him.
  Then&mdash;Dr. Endicott comes back from the phone&mdash;<i>and
  operates."</i></p>

  <p>Phyllis stared, pressing the back of her hand against her lips.</p>

  <p>"Now"&mdash;pursued Sonia steadily&mdash;"let's come at it from another
  angle. Young Dr. Paige is the assistant. Dr. Paige"&mdash;she tapped the
  letter with her finger-tips&mdash;"is devotedly attached to Dr. Endicott. The
  operation proves to be fatal, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And Dr. Paige runs away&mdash;and hides," said Phyllis thickly, "which he
  would not have done if he hadn't made a terrible mistake."</p>

  <p>"I've just been wondering," reflected Sonia, half to herself. "I've been
  wondering which of those two men would have been the more likely to make a
  mistake&mdash;on that particular occasion."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but why should he have taken the blame?"</p>

  <p>Sonia took up the letter, and slowly read a few lines aloud.</p>

  <p>"'I think it beautiful&mdash;almost touching&mdash;this relationship
  between these two brilliant men. Whenever Dr. Endicott's name is mentioned,
  Dr. Paige reacts to it much as an exceptionally devoted son might speak of an
  admired and revered father'&mdash;listen to <i>this</i>, dear&mdash;'I gather
  that he thinks Dr. Endicott is working too hard.'"</p>

  <p>Phyllis shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I tried to make something of that, too," she said dismally. "But it
  doesn't make sense. Dr. Paige had no interests at all, except his profession.
  I think it very doubtful that he would throw his life away to shield another
  man."</p>

  <p>"You mean," queried Sonia seriously, "that from what little you saw of
  him, yesterday, you doubt if he is the sort to do such a thing?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I don't mean that, at all.... Perhaps he might." Phyllis was
  thoughtfully silent for a little while. "I think he might," she added.</p>

  <p>"And <i>I</i> think he <i>did!"</i> said Sonia decisively. "There are
  people loyal enough to do that. I fancy he's one of 'em."</p>

  <p>"We'll probably never know." Phyllis slowly disengaged herself from the
  steamer rug, and tugged Sonia to her feet. "Come, dear, it's late.... There's
  nothing we can do about it. I've told you everything there is to tell. Let's
  forget it now."</p>

  <p>"Meaning&mdash;truly"&mdash;said Sonia, putting an arm around
  her&mdash;"that you'd rather not talk about it&mdash;any
  more&mdash;ever?"</p>

  <p>Phyllis nodded pensively.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to put the whole thing out of my mind," she insisted. "I never
  expect to see him again&mdash;and no amount of worrying on my part would do
  him any good."</p>

  <p>"Very well, dear," agreed Sonia, "if that's the way you feel about
  it."</p>

  <p>They went to their beds, snapped off the lights, and there was a full
  half-hour of silence.</p>

  <p>Phyllis cautiously rose up on her elbow and listened.</p>

  <p>"Sonia!" she whispered. "You awake?"</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't that absurd&mdash;what she said about his dog?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MOMENTARILY stunned by Phyllis's impulsive decision to leave
  him, Newell had stood at the open door of the taxi&mdash;deaf to the
  indignant honking of impeded traffic&mdash;dazedly watching her until she was
  lost in the surging crowd.</p>

  <p>Jarred now to full consciousness of the driver's rasping demand for
  further instructions, he clumsily fumbled in his wallet, overpaid the surly
  fellow, and turned away. It had all come to pass so suddenly that he had not
  even said good-bye. Her final "I'm sorry" lingered in his ears. It had been
  spoken hardly above a whisper, intimate, almost sympathetic, as of a shared
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>With no definite plan except to seek some quieter spot where his painful
  bewilderment would be less conspicuous, he crossed to the comparative
  tranquillity of the east side of the boulevard, finding himself in the
  immediate vicinity of the Art Institute. It suggested a temporary refuge.
  Mounting the broad steps, he entered and proceeded along the main
  corridor.</p>

  <p>Such vague attention as he paid to his surroundings seemed vested only in
  a fantastic desire to know how many people annually drifted into this place
  for the sole purpose of self-recovery from a cruel blow, or privately to take
  stock of what little still remained after some unanticipated loss.
  Doubtless&mdash;especially now that the tide was exceptionally strong&mdash;a
  considerable quantity of well-gowned flotsam and white-collared jetsam washed
  up here, dismayed people of the better sort who, finding their burdens too
  heavy to carry, might put them down for an hour while they made pretence of
  interest in these various works of art.</p>

  <p>Nor need it be a mere pretence. It was not inconceivable, thought Newell,
  as he strolled down the corridor lined with exquisite statuettes and busts on
  pedestals, that many a thoughtful person&mdash;subconsciously remembering
  that the greatest of the artists lived in poverty and executed their best
  work under stress of heartbreak&mdash;might find in these things a strange
  comradeship.</p>

  <p>Arriving in a great hall of gigantic reproductions of European
  church-doors, elaborately carved choir-stalls, shrines, and the like, Newell
  sauntered among them with misgivings. For it was quite impossible to
  appreciate, to-day, either their historical significance or their artistic
  value. Under normal circumstances, he knew, they would have stirred him
  deeply.</p>

  <p>He paused before the Colombe tomb-statue wrought in memory of Francis II,
  last Duke of Brittany, and Marguerite de Foix, his wife, whose recumbent
  figures surmounted the catafalque. A stringy, high-domed lad of fourteen,
  accompanied by a near-sighted cleric of forty who was obviously his tutor,
  discreetly palmed a yawn and indifferently asked in a fluty treble, "What did
  <i>he</i> do?"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;nothing," replied the bookish one with equal unconcern, as if
  this sort of immortality could be had at small cost.</p>

  <p>"Then why is he here?" queried the boy, with unexpected wisdom, thought
  Paige, glad to be diverted for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;he really isn't," confided the tutor. "It's Colombe that's
  here. This Duke Francis was a nobody. He wasn't even <i>there</i>"&mdash;he
  chuckled drily&mdash;"that is, he wasn't <i>all</i> there."</p>

  <p>"Was Colombe so important, then?" grinned the boy.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact&mdash;no," replied the tutor with a shrug. "Michel
  Colombe was just a good all-round stone-mason. He made this piece from a
  drawing by Jehan Perreal."</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;Colombe isn't here either," decided the youngster. "It's
  <i>Perreal</i> who's really here."</p>

  <p>"Mmm," agreed the tutor, with a forward thrust of his underlip. "That is,
  if Perreal actually conceived the idea. There's no telling. He may have
  stolen it from sketches drawn by some bright pupil."</p>

  <p>"Like me, for instance," suggested the boy, apparently willing to toss his
  teacher this cue for some astringent pleasantry.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;at least that bright." Pleased with his disciple's reaction to
  this sally, the tutor sobered and pointed to the foremost of the supporting
  figures on the west side of the statue. "This one, you will observe, has two
  faces, the younger one looking forward, the grim, bearded, old one looking
  backward. Make a note of that and do me a page or two of your impressions..."
  His further instructions became inaudible to Paige as the pair ambled
  away.</p>

  <p>It occurred to the eavesdropper that he would be much interested himself
  in seeing what this smooth-cheeked, inexperienced lad might write about the
  ironic playfulness of Fate in perching the effigy of a ducal nonentity atop
  this celebrated memorial to a good, all-round stone-mason who had copied the
  drawing of an artist who might have filched the design from a clever student.
  It was incomprehensible how some men were tossed into the hall of fame
  accidentally, while others, who had earned a right to be there, lacked even a
  grave-marker in some neglected cemetery. Paige thought it would be
  interesting to hear a few words on that from Dean Harcourt. And what might
  the Dean have to say about this gloomy old owl who looked backward over the
  course that the bent-shouldered bearers of Francis the Unimportant had
  plodded, these three thousand miles and four hundred years? How much of this
  bewhiskered old philosopher's dull-eyed apathy was attributable to fatigue,
  how much to saintly patience, how much to human understanding, and how much
  to a weary disgust?... Oh, well&mdash;what the hell!... The longer you
  thought about this sort of thing, the more addled you were.</p>

  <p>Newell turned away and walked to the extreme south end of the vast room,
  where for a long time he paced slowly back and forth. "I'm sorry," she was
  still saying in that low-pitched voice of hers that made everything she said
  sound almost like a confidence. He sensed her presence as keenly as when she
  had sat close beside him in the taxi. Doubtless the feeling would pass,
  presently, and the image would fade, but for the moment Phyllis seemed very
  near&mdash;so near he could see the little gold flecks in the amber of her
  uplifted eyes. The spot on his wrist, where her bare forearm had rested for
  an instant when they were fondling Sylvia's silky head, was still aware of
  that accidental contact.</p>

  <p>His longing to have another word with her&mdash;to replace the poignant
  memory of that ultimate "I'm sorry"&mdash;was so strong that Newell
  tentatively sparred with the idea of writing her a note, but when he ventured
  in imagination upon the first sentence of it, he rejected the thought. It
  would only cause them both more unhappiness to reopen this hopeless case.</p>

  <p>A strolling guard seemed mildly curious. Newell caught his inquisitive
  glance and slowly moved away, mounted the narrow stairs to the next level,
  and sauntered down the long corridor whose succession of open doors led into
  the picture galleries. He walked aimlessly around the walls of two of them,
  the paintings blurring into a motley panorama of meaningless irrelevance. In
  the third room he sat for a while trying to debate what next to do.... Elise
  had called up saying she would be engaged throughout to-day and to-morrow. He
  had promised to see her on Wednesday afternoon. But what was the good of it?
  The very thought of trying to be sprightly and amusing for Elise's
  entertainment was irksome, even repugnant. He would drop her a line.</p>

  <p>So&mdash;what? Go back to weedy little Leeds? For what purpose? True, he
  had told the Brocks and Dr. Graham that he would return&mdash;but what did it
  matter? He was under no obligation to do so. If he did, he would probably be
  trumping up errands to come back here, again and again, in the hope of a
  reconciliation that could never be effected. No&mdash;the farther away the
  better. Why not to the Coast? Why not <i>now?</i> He glanced at his watch. It
  was half-past two. Plenty of time to gather up his light baggage and take a
  late afternoon train.</p>

  <p>He rose, reproaching himself again for his dull indifference to the
  pictures, and crossed the room, glancing briefly at two or three of the more
  arresting subjects. With listless steps he continued along the corridor
  which, forming a huge square, would lead him back to the main entrance. At
  open doors he halted briefly, wishing he might shake off his lethargy and
  take advantage of an opportunity he would have welcomed in any other state of
  mind. Through one doorway he caught a colourful glimpse of the lithe,
  life-sized figure of a green-gowned dancing girl, a mocking, twisted smile on
  her red lips. He stood, for a moment, half-minded to go in and view her at
  closer range. After an instant of irresolution, he walked on.</p>

  <p>Out in the street again, he hailed a taxi and drove across town, securing
  accommodation on the 5.45 train, returned to the St. Lawrence, and began
  packing.</p>

  <p>Once more the idea of writing Phyllis a brief letter was debated and
  dismissed. Common civility suggested his cancelling the engagement he had
  with Elise, but after experimenting with several explanations to account for
  his sudden departure, he damned all the half-scribbled pages into the
  waste-basket and gave it up. His mind turned toward Dean Harcourt. It would
  be ungracious to rush away without some expression of gratitude to this wise
  and kind priest. The note he composed was brief, but the Dean would
  understand. "I am leaving this afternoon," he wrote, "for the West. You were
  very good to me..." He tapped the barrel of his pen against his teeth,
  meditating a sentence that might explain his abrupt decision to go so far
  away, but shook his head. A few moments later, in the lobby floral shop, he
  ordered a heavily budded rosebush to be sent to the Dean, accompanied by the
  note.</p>

  <p>Sylvia eyed him reproachfully as he led her past the long row of Pullmans
  to the baggage-car. She had become accustomed to travelling in this manner,
  but it was plain that she did not care for it.</p>

  <p>The train rolled out through the yards, gathering speed. A white-capped,
  white-aproned waiter passed through with a dinner-gong under his arm. The
  elderly lady across the aisle considered the respective merits of the
  half-dozen magazines her relatives had handed her to beguile the time. The
  heavy cars pounded the rail-ends with increasing zeal. Newell stared moodily
  out the window. "I'm sorry," murmured Phyllis. "I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>The tall, tanned young man with the bronze hair and belted sport clothes
  had ineffectively snapped his lighter several times and Paige, who also had
  been among the earliest to emerge for the comfort of a cigarette, offered the
  appropriate courtesy.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said the accommodated, after a deep inhalation. "Pretty fair
  show&mdash;for stock."</p>

  <p>"Not too bad," agreed Paige. "It'll do for a time-killer."</p>

  <p>By consent they fell into step, moving slowly through the chattering
  foyer's increasing crowd, which they conspicuously overtopped, fetching up in
  a quiet corner well out of the foggy whirlpool.</p>

  <p>"You San Franciscans," Paige was remarking idly, "have a great lot of fun
  panning the golden sunshiners farther down the coast, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"They really do," chuckled the other mirthlessly. "Surefire stage joke.
  The childish interest these two big towns take in berating each other is
  quite beyond all sober calculation."</p>

  <p>"You don't belong out here, I take it," said Paige unnecessarily.</p>

  <p>"Nor anywhere." The grin accompanying the growl was unpleasant. "Once upon
  a time"&mdash;a little more graciously&mdash;"the south shore of Lake Erie
  was my habitat."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? Same with me. My name is Paige." Might as well tell the truth
  this time, he thought. Not likely ever to see this chap again.</p>

  <p>"Mine's Ingram&mdash;David Ingram. Glad to have run across you." They
  smiled briefly and shook hands. "Been here long, Mr. Paige?"</p>

  <p>"Since noon. Spent most of the time since arrival in a Turkish bath,
  boiling out the sand. Dirty trip. Very tedious."</p>

  <p>"Don't I know?" grumbled Ingram. "Landed here from Shanghai, two weeks ago
  yesterday. Round-trip to New York since then."</p>

  <p>"Back to China now, eh?" wondered Paige.</p>

  <p>"No." Ingram was curt.</p>

  <p>Paige flicked the ashes from his cigarette and gave an involuntary shrug
  as if to say it was of no momentous consequence to him where sullen Mr.
  Ingram went.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean to be rude," said Ingram gruffly. "I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>Paige nodded his acceptance of the apology. When would people stop telling
  him they were sorry... 'I'm sorry'... There wasn't a phrase in the language
  that had caused him more mental torture. He ground out his cigarette-butt in
  a convenient ash-tray.</p>

  <p>The buzzer sounded a warning that the third act was ready, and they
  sauntered into the crowd drifting toward the entrances to the aisles.</p>

  <p>"Doing anything in particular afterwards?" asked Ingram.</p>

  <p>"No," said Paige brusquely, "nothing."</p>

  <p>"Meet you&mdash;out here, maybe?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mind."</p>

  <p>They separated in the dimming light, Paige groping into his seat down in
  the third row centre. The comedy carried on, noisily overplayed but amusing.
  The <i>ingénue</i> was fairly good, Newell thought, but thinned down cruelly
  for thirty-two. Women at that age had to be careful. Couldn't stand continued
  starvation, especially these blondish types. Odd thing about that: brunettes
  could take more punishment; seemed to be strung up better, neurally. Room for
  some intensive thinking on that subject: relation of pigmentation to
  nerve-structure. This Clarissa Montrose ought to be carrying at least fifteen
  pounds more. Knife-edged clavicles, ash-white elbows, acute pelvic
  definition, and breathed only from the top.</p>

  <p>"And you thought I was Jerry's wife!" twittered Clarissa coyly.</p>

  <p>"All the eggs she can hold, a quart of milk a day, and keep her quiet,"
  Newell heard himself saying to the nurse, outside her door.</p>

  <p>"Angel!" cooed the leading man, tipping up her lean chin with his
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," reflected Newell, "but she's going to be." He pulled down the
  sheet, applied the dangling end of his stethoscope to the upper tip of her
  right lung. "Say 'ninety-nine', Clarissa.... Now, take a deep breath. That's
  good. Hold it!" He moved the bell of the stethoscope across to the pitifully
  flabby left breast and listened to the regurgitation of a gallant but not
  indestructible heart.</p>

  <p>"We won't tell Jerry yet," counselled the leading man.</p>

  <p>"He might not approve."</p>

  <p>"I know I wouldn't," meditated Newell, "if she were my sister. Your
  kidneys are full of copper, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;" He consulted the
  programme. "&mdash;Mr. Romaine.... I'll want another specimen of that, nurse,
  to check up on that albumen cast we got yesterday. Might have known what we'd
  find, of course. Big, spongy ankles, puffy lower lids, cloudy cornea.
  Drinking too much hard stuff.... No more red meat, Mr. Romaine, until I tell
  you. And your highballs for the next six months are going to be made of
  sauerkraut juice with a little dash of spinach."</p>

  <p>"My mistake!" Jerry was expostulating as he blundered into the scene while
  Clarissa was being kissed.</p>

  <p>"You're making a bigger mistake than that," mused Newell, eyeing him
  critically. "You'd do well to have a dental X-ray. I saw you wince when
  Clarissa clutched your arm a while ago. If you don't look out these focal
  infections are going to make one solid arthritical chunk of you, from your
  neck to your heels, by the time you're fifty-five."</p>

  <p>Newell's entertaining pastime of conducting these imaginary clinics was
  growing on him of late. Sometimes, as he sat in a hotel lobby or a railroad
  station, he diagnosed everybody in sight, fervently wishing he might verify
  the more abstruse by laboratory tests.</p>

  <p>On the train coming out, two middle-aged cronies seated next him in the
  club car were engaged in desultory talk, and the one with the squint remarked
  that he'd lately been having hot shooting pains in his legs&mdash;"like
  rheumatism, only worse"&mdash;and couldn't read very long without seeing
  double.... Newell had put down his book and glanced at the speaker out of the
  tail of his eye. A moment afterward, he resumed his novel disinterestedly,
  reflecting that it wouldn't be long&mdash;a couple of years,
  perhaps&mdash;until the least informed layman could interpret the exact
  meaning of these two canes this fellow would be stamping hard against the
  pavement, to steady his shambling gait.</p>

  <p>"Funny," the man was saying. "Bottoms of my feet feel like I'm walking on
  wool."</p>

  <p>"It's not a bit funny," Newell mentally replied, "locomotor ataxia
  isn't."</p>

  <p>"Yep," sighed the man, "it's difficult getting around, these days."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," thought Newell, "you've been around."</p>

  <p>Sometimes he held extended debates with himself on the ethics of his
  former profession. This code had constituted the fundamental premises of his
  loyalty. Its demands were, to him, the most urgent of all the moral
  imperatives. Lacking a religion, this had served in its stead. Indifferent to
  political movements and an adherent of no party, this was his politics and
  this his patriotism.</p>

  <p>In his present plight, Newell had occasion to wonder whether some of these
  recommendations were sound. For instance, there was that old man with whom he
  had rubbed elbows in the Pullman dressing-room. With elaborate care the fine
  old fellow had gingerly shaved around the edges of a small sullen sore on his
  cheek-bone. The ethics of the medical profession bade Newell mind his own
  business and volunteer no counsel. He wanted very much to say, "My friend, if
  I had that little spot on my face, I would see a good cancer specialist
  without delay." He couldn't and didn't say it. But something told him he had
  failed of a duty that made a higher bid for his action than the code of
  ethics which forbade it.</p>

  <p>Ingram was waiting for him after the show, and they strolled out into the
  balmy May-day evening towards the hotel where both were stopping. Prudently
  casual queries were exchanged and discreetly evasive replies were given,
  Ingram taking the initiative, for Paige still remembered the fellow's
  gruffness in the theatre lobby and did not propose to encore it.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, lounging with unbuttoned collars and open waistcoats in
  Ingram's room, they had admitted to each other that they were adrift. Neither
  had come to the point of disgorging details, but after much careful
  cat-footing around the rim of their respective predicaments and a few drinks
  from Ingram's quart bottle, supplemented by ice and ginger ale from below, it
  became clear enough that however they might have arrived at their present
  state of uselessness, they were equally useless.</p>

  <p>Suddenly candid, Ingram launched upon his story. Most of it was hot and
  spluttery, for the rank injustice that themed it was fresh in his mind. He
  had been out in China for five years in the employ of a great American
  industry. Under no circumstances would he have endured all the discomforts
  incident to this small-paid job but for the promise&mdash;at least the
  reasonable expectation&mdash;of frequent advancements in salary and
  responsibility.</p>

  <p>The girl had finally decided, two years ago, after a tedious and
  nerve-destroying correspondence, that she wasn't quite up to spending her
  life in a foreign land. So that was that, and Ingram had got over it without
  much damage; with a sense of relief, to have the matter settled. With
  increased interest in his job&mdash;for it was now up to him to demonstrate
  to himself that textile machinery was more important than
  Hortense&mdash;Ingram became a glutton for work, permitting himself to be
  shockingly imposed upon by his superiors. Nothing mattered any more but to
  please the company. He merely grinned when Hortense wrote that she was
  marrying Bradford, his closest friend back home. It had always been in the
  back of his head that Bradford would be his best man. He wished them luck and
  hurried to catch a train to Tientsin on an errand another chap should have
  done.</p>

  <p>Entitled to a six months' leave, he had sailed for the States, not
  hilariously, for there was nothing he cared to come back to, but mildly
  curious to note the changes in his country. He had gone directly to New York
  for the customary interview with the people at The Top, and had been informed
  of reorganization that would degrade him both in pay and prestige, explained
  of course by the Depression, which Ingram profanely declared would now be
  offered as an excuse for fraud, ingratitude, extortion, and the evasion of
  contracted obligations.</p>

  <p>During the latter part of his narrative, Ingram paced the floor, gesturing
  with his glass, just drunk enough to disclose his real feelings, but not so
  drunk as to convert the story into maudlin melodrama.</p>

  <p>Newell's eyes interestedly and sympathetically followed him up and down
  the room, vicariously relieving his own pent-up sentiments by listening to
  Ingram's passionate speech. On occasions he, too, could be fairly competent
  in the use of strong terms, but he was obliged to concede tonight that this
  man's versatility in all the accepted techniques of vituperation made him
  feel very humble indeed. Newell learned, during David's peroration, that
  certain adjectives of damnation could be converted into adverbs, giving them
  a fresh piquancy. Deeply as he sympathized with his new friend, it was
  difficult at times for him to keep his face straight when the tempest was in
  full fury.</p>

  <p>He kept wondering whether Ingram's complete purgation of all his
  bottled-up venom was going to require him to turn himself inside-out also.
  Even in the sweat and sacrilege of David's address, Newell found himself
  concocting an autobiography that might be adequate to account for his own
  plight. He had no notion of telling Ingram the exact truth.</p>

  <p>It soon appeared, however, that the red-faced chronicler was much too
  obsessed with his own misfortunes to insist on knowing the nature of Paige's
  calamity.</p>

  <p>"Look!" Ingram, winded and perspiring, had become suddenly inspired with a
  large idea. "You and I need a long breath of absolutely fresh air. Away up in
  the mountains. Away up above the fog. We gotta get out of the sight and sound
  and smell of the whole damned farce. We'll buy a coupla blankets and some
  beans and lease a burro&mdash;and lose ourselves for a month or two.
  Whaddayuh say?"</p>

  <p>Paige grinned and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't be any good at that sort of thing. Never went camping in my
  life."</p>

  <p>"Neither did I. We'll take a guide. Get one for a song."</p>

  <p>"Maybe we'd better wait and talk it over when we're both sober," suggested
  Paige indulgently.</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;'both sober'!" challenged Ingram truculently.</p>

  <p>"When <i>I'm</i> sober, then, little one, if you're so sensitive."</p>

  <p>Ingram slumped into a chair, scowled, grinned, mopped his face, and said
  he needed a bowl of hot onion soup. Paige reflected that a glass of iced
  buttermilk would be more to the purpose. After a quarrel about the respective
  merits of these restoratives, they started to go down to the grill.</p>

  <p>"You'd make a much better impression there if you wore your shirt,"
  advised Paige. "Here it is&mdash;and brush your hair."</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;that's what comes from living soft!" rumbled Ingram. "Gotta
  wear a shirt. Gotta brush your hair. I want a breath o' air. Mountains!
  Beans! Burro! Open spaces!"</p>

  <p>"All right! A-l-l-r-i-g-h-t!" drawled Paige. "We'll do it. Sounds
  silly&mdash;and I'll bet we're back in twenty-four hours. But&mdash;we'll try
  it."</p>

  <p>They had considered themselves lucky to have found a guide at liberty.
  True, Pete was an ugly, sullen rascal, but&mdash;as Ingram said&mdash;they
  weren't taking him along as a social companion, and if he minded his own
  business and didn't try to be too chummy, so much the better.</p>

  <p>It was late afternoon when their train arrived at Bayley's Gulch. Leaving
  their luggage with the station-master, they had sauntered up the shabby
  street to the General Store which was also the Post Office. Restrained
  curiosity dully smouldered in the eyes of the loafers seated in all the
  postures of indolence and fatigue on the unpainted wooden steps. Something
  like a sneer accompanied the unanimous inspection of the strangers' new boots
  as they came to a stand in front of the ramshackle building.</p>

  <p>Ingram inquired pleasantly whether it would be possible to secure a guide
  to take them up into the mountains on a hiking trip. Two sourly shook their
  heads, three or four shifted their positions slightly and gazed at one
  another in silence; then they all spat, in concert.</p>

  <p>"Well!" said Ingram testily; and the two of them tramped up the steps and
  into the store. The postmaster was gruffly responsive, but didn't know of
  anyone who might want the job.</p>

  <p>"How long?" growled a swarthy hulk of a fellow, seated on a nail-keg in
  the far corner.</p>

  <p>Ingram and Paige moved in his direction and outlined their plans.
  Pete&mdash;he seemed not to have another name&mdash;drove a hard bargain, but
  they were in no position to haggle in such a tight market. It was agreed that
  they would start in the morning, shortly after sunrise. The postmaster gave
  them a room for the night and they slept together on a thin mattress in a bed
  that squeakingly protested.</p>

  <p>They were off at five-thirty, Pete and the burro leading. The day was fine
  and the adventurers were in excellent form. Sylvia, unused to walking on
  sharp stones, picked her footing daintily, pausing now and then with elevated
  nose to sniff the new atmosphere with an amusing attitude of distaste for
  this unprecedented foolishness.</p>

  <p>"Pete," remarked Paige, as they sat eating their lunch at eleven beside a
  noisy little mountain stream, "we're not trying to break any records, you
  know. This climbing business is not exactly in our line and we'll be needing
  a day or two before we're as tough as you are. Better take it a little slower
  this afternoon."</p>

  <p>At six they called it a day and sprawled on the ground, admiring the
  sunset and nursing their lame feet. Pete stolidly prepared supper. It was
  delicious&mdash;thick-sliced greasy bacon, beans&mdash;Ingram was especially
  pleased with the beans&mdash;leather flapjacks, and heroically strong
  coffee.</p>

  <p>"No great hurry to-morrow, Pete," counselled Ingram. "We've got all the
  time in the world."</p>

  <p>In spite of the admonition, breakfast was a-sizzle at five and they were
  scrambling up the difficult trail at six. Pete seemed in slightly lighter
  spirits when they halted at noon in a comparatively level spot where a
  waterfall had encouraged some hardy vegetation. He suggested that they might
  camp here for a day or two, his clients heartily approving.</p>

  <p>At one Pete sauntered off with a pick on his shoulder and did not return
  until dark. They watched him leave the trail a hundred yards up the slope and
  turn to the left, disappearing among the white crags. When it was
  supper-time, and he was still absent, they proceeded to do their own cooking,
  agreeing that it was more tasty than Pete's, and not caring whether the
  contemptuous fellow ever came back.</p>

  <p>"One thing about the Chinks," continued David, refilling his pipe as they
  lounged on their elbows before the smouldering fire, "they're fundamentally
  honest about their work. A sort of innate respect for their jobs. The Chink's
  employment is never thought of as a vocation. It is an inheritance. If his
  honourable parent is a cobbler, he has no itch to be something better or
  other than a cobbler. His great-great-grandfather was a cobbler and his
  great-great-grandson will be a cobbler. If he was born on the land, he stays
  on the land&mdash;same land that was tilled by a whole graveyardful of
  ancestors.</p>

  <p>"Which, I suppose," reflected Newell, "accounts for their lack of
  enterprise."</p>

  <p>"Judged by our Yankee conception of progress&mdash;yes." David tugged
  energetically on his pipe for a while, and continued: "A fellow was telling
  me in New York the other day, that when you have your oil changed at a garage
  you had better stand right there and watch carefully to see that the chap
  screws the nut back on tightly, or he's likely to neglect it, and he wouldn't
  care if all your oil leaked out at the cost of a burned bearing."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe that happens very often," Newell objected
  patriotically.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;this fellow thought it did; said he thought the majority of
  the young fry in this country considered themselves too good for their jobs,
  ingenious only in devising methods to avoid work, hating the idea of serving
  anybody, and with no interest whatsoever in sound workmanship for its own
  sake. No more guild-pride.... You don't think that's so?"</p>

  <p>"In the main&mdash;no. But perhaps I'm not the person to consult. As I
  remember the conduct of the people who worked with me, I think most of them
  were very attentive to their business. It might have been a bit different in
  their case, however. It was rather dangerous to be reckless in that
  institution."</p>

  <p>"Powder factory?"</p>

  <p>Newell delayed his reply, making quite a task of poking the embers into a
  blaze.</p>

  <p>"Hospital," he answered, at length. "I think I'll tell you about it."</p>

  <p>It was after ten o'clock when they rolled into their blankets, Ingram
  indignantly muttering that they'd both had a rotten deal, Paige replying that
  perhaps they'd better try to forget about it and make use of their excursion,
  in view of what it had done to their feet.</p>

  <p>Pete was gone, the next morning, before they were up.</p>

  <p>"I've a notion," observed Newell, "that instead of hiring a guide, we're
  financing a prospector."</p>

  <p>"It's no matter," chuckled David. "I'm just as glad he isn't hanging about
  all the time. So long as he doesn't abscond with the food and leave us
  marooned up here, I'm willing he should keep out of sight."</p>

  <p>After breakfast they decided on a tramp to the right of the trail. It was
  rough going and an hour of it was plenty. They sat to rest near what had once
  been a waterfall.</p>

  <p>"Pretty bit of rock, that," remarked Newell, rolling a fist-sized chunk of
  parti-coloured stone about with the toe of his boot. "The green is copper, no
  doubt. What are those bright brassy flecks?"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;you'll be finding gold," yawned David, stretching flat on his
  back, hands behind his head. "Boy!&mdash;if there was any of that stuff lying
  around loose on the ground, this close to civilization, there'd be a mob up
  here fighting for it."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure about that. We're three-quarters of a mile off the trail.
  This particular spot may never have been visited before." Newell was idly
  hammering his discovery with a hefty round stone.</p>

  <p>"And it's never going to be visited again, far as I'm concerned," muttered
  David sleepily.</p>

  <p>"I say, old man," exclaimed Newell, "have a look at this stuff!"</p>

  <p>It was dusk again when Pete returned to find his employers making the
  fire. Paige told him he had arrived just in time to be useful, a hint he
  acted upon reluctantly. It was evident that Pete was in an ugly mood. He had
  had a bad day, no doubt.</p>

  <p>"Might as well push on to-morrow," he advised gruffly.</p>

  <p>"No hurry," replied Ingram. "We like it here... Eh, Sylvia, old lady?"</p>

  <p>"There's nothin' to see," growled Pete. "Better view higher up."</p>

  <p>"We'll see it when we get there," said Paige shortly. "We're staying here
  for a couple of days. If you want to ramble about, that's your
  privilege."</p>

  <p>Pete sulkily lumbered off after supper, tethered the burro some fifty
  yards farther away, and seated himself at some distance from the fire.</p>

  <p>"He has thoughts of moving on early in the morning without us," suspected
  Ingram. "I think I'll drag the pack over here where he isn't so likely to be
  tempted."</p>

  <p>If Pete had been meditating an unannounced get-away, there was no evidence
  of it next morning. He was surprisingly attentive at breakfast and made no
  move to leave camp. Ingram grinned and winked.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if the chap hasn't smelled a mouse," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"We can easily find out," thought Newell, outlining a plan.</p>

  <p>Lighting their pipes, they strolled off toward the left of the trail,
  elaborately unconcerned about their course, leaving Pete polishing the pans
  with amazing diligence. After nearly a half-mile of wearisome clambering over
  tumbled rocks, they agreed they'd had enough and sat down in the lee of a big
  one to smoke their pipes. Ingram took off his cap, twenty minutes later, and
  cautiously drew himself up to peer over the top of the ledge.</p>

  <p>"Yep&mdash;he's a faithful guide," reported Ingram. "Coming right
  along."</p>

  <p>"That kind of devotion should be rewarded. Let's go back and present him
  with one of our pebbles. If he wants to think we found it over here, that
  will be his own affair."</p>

  <p>Pete was back in camp when they returned. Paige dug in his pocket and
  handed him a little stone with the remark that it looked as if there was a
  bit of gold in it.</p>

  <p>"'Bout five cents a ton," scoffed Pete disgustedly.</p>

  <p>"That all?" Paige threw it away, appearing indifferent to the assay, an
  episode that seemed to amuse Ingram.</p>

  <p>As they had expected, Pete strolled off early in the afternoon on an
  unnecessarily circuitous route toward the place where he had seen them in the
  morning. When he was safely out of sight, they retraced their steps to the
  wash where they had found the gold.</p>

  <p>"God&mdash;Newell&mdash;don't let that dangle!" groaned Ingram. "It's
  broken in a dozen places&mdash;grinding&mdash;ends scratching."</p>

  <p>"I know," panted Paige, "but there isn't anything I can do about
  it&mdash;not out here. I'll be as easy as possible." The one hundred and
  seventy pounds burden on his back was beginning to make his head swim. Sylvia
  was excitedly scampering in aimless circles, with high-keyed little whimpers
  of sympathy as if she regretted her inability to help.</p>

  <p>Pete had set off early that morning with his pick on his shoulder, David
  watching him go. He shook Newell awake.</p>

  <p>"Look!" he said, laughing. "Hot on the gold-trail!"</p>

  <p>Newell yawned, stretched mightily, and raised up on an elbow, his thick
  mop of hair tousled.</p>

  <p>"That leaves us free for a good day's work," he said. "Our Pete isn't as
  crafty as we thought."</p>

  <p>Arrived at the precipitous slope where long ago the wash had been left on
  the mountain-side by a stream whose course had been deflected, perhaps by an
  avalanche, they began to climb, admitting to each other that it was very
  risky business for inexperienced people.</p>

  <p>A dwarf pine had snapped with Ingram, dropping him twenty feet&mdash;rigid
  and topside up&mdash;on a slanting rock. He had crumpled, clutching his leg.
  Paige had quickly followed down, slipping, sliding, clawing for hand-holds. A
  hasty examination of the injury showed a serious fracture. The torturing trip
  back to camp was begun.</p>

  <p>"Stiff upper lip, old fellow!" encouraged Newell. "Not
  very&mdash;far&mdash;now." He heartily wished he was telling the truth. At
  times he feared he was about all in.</p>

  <p>After a few eternities, with his head pounding and his lungs on fire from
  the gruelling strain, he gently eased his burden down, and set about the task
  of attending to Ingram's hurt.</p>

  <p>"Now this is going to be nothing but a makeshift, my lad," he warned, as
  he began tearing up their shirts into bandages and drawing nails from the
  wooden box containing their tinned meats. "We'll have to wait until we're
  down before this can be properly set. I shall do the very best I can for
  you."</p>

  <p>"By the way"&mdash;Ingram gritted his teeth&mdash;"how are we going to get
  down? Think this rapscallion can be trusted to go for help?" He clenched his
  fists and watched Paige's experienced hands fashioning the splint.</p>

  <p>"No," muttered Paige. "We are all going down together."</p>

  <p>"Look&mdash;he's coming now! He followed us, after all."</p>

  <p>Paige hotly confronted Pete with the charge that he had trailed along
  behind them, too lazy and indifferent to offer help. Pete grinned sourly and
  declared it was none of his business if they broke their legs trying to hide
  a find from him.</p>

  <p>Ingram ventured to express his feelings on this subject, but Paige
  silenced him with a shake of the head. They couldn't afford to make war on
  Pete&mdash;not in this predicament.</p>

  <p>"Break camp at once, Pete," commanded Paige. "Pack the stuff. We will
  start down immediately."</p>

  <p>"Not to-day," growled Pete. "I'm staying here over tomorrow. Mean to have
  another look around&mdash;over there where he broke his leg."</p>

  <p>Something in Paige's head snapped. The limit of his forbearance had been
  reached. His right first crashed into the fellow's jaw. Pete measured his
  length and lay very still.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR the first time in his adult life, Newell Paige had slept
  all the way around the clock. He awoke drenched with perspiration, his eyes
  blinded by the dazzling sunshine. Dully exploring his stiff lips with the tip
  of a sluggish tongue, he encountered the longest bristles he had ever
  acquired.</p>

  <p>The severely simple appointments of the room helped him to locate himself.
  He closed his throbbing eyes for a long moment and shuddered at the
  recollection. Every sore and swollen muscle of his body protested as he
  raised up on an elbow to reach for his watch on the white enamel table beside
  the high narrow bed. It was ten-thirty. He grimacingly eased himself back on
  the damp pillow and ventured a heavy sigh which was so strongly objected to
  that he gave it up.</p>

  <p>There was a gentle thumping on the floor beneath the bed. Newell grinned,
  lowered an arm over the edge, snapped his fingers softly, and felt Sylvia's
  wet tongue on his hand. Then her red head appeared and her forepaws were laid
  on the mattress close beside his pillow.</p>

  <p>"What have you got there?" inquired Newell.</p>

  <p>Sylvia opened her jaws and put down on his chest a ragged piece of dusty,
  hard-textured cloth about the size of a man's two outspread hands. Newell
  held up the doubtful gift and inspected it closely. Then he chuckled, and
  Sylvia laid her muzzle against his arm.</p>

  <p>The door, which had been left ajar, was now cautiously pushed open. The
  nurse, with basin and towels, smilingly approached the bed, Sylvia dropping
  down on all fours to make way for her.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;you're awake. How do you feel?" She began washing his face. "If
  we didn't have the most awful time with this dog, last night! We tried to
  keep her out of your room, but she made so much racket that Dr. Stafford said
  we'd better let her in before she roused the whole hospital."</p>

  <p>"I can't remember much about it," said Paige listlessly. "She just now
  handed me this. It looks suspiciously like a fragment of somebody's corduroy
  trousers."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;it's the seat. I know about it. We found you and your friend Mr
  Ingram lying out in the driveway, the dog barking furiously. You were so
  thoroughly exhausted that you passed out completely. A big rough-looking
  fellow was leading a burro away. And while we were carrying you both in, your
  dog turned and went after the man and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And paid her parting regards," finished Paige. "Did she hurt him?"</p>

  <p>"Probably not seriously. He got away under his own power."</p>

  <p>A big bushy-haired man in white duck appeared in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"This is Dr. Stafford," said the nurse. "I suppose you don't recall much
  about being put to bed."</p>

  <p>The doctor entered and stood for a moment grinning amiably, with his arms
  folded, and his rubber-soled feet wide apart. His expression hinted that he
  had a joke on his patient. Paige nodded in response to the sly smile and
  wondered what sort of banter was to follow.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;what can we get you first?" asked Dr. Stafford companionably.
  "Poached eggs on toast and a cup of coffee?"</p>

  <p>"I think I'd like a deep breath," replied Paige, with a wince.</p>

  <p>The doctor stepped forward, unbuttoned the coarse white jacket and gently
  prodded him in the ribs with inquisitive finger-tips. "Hurt?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It's deeper in, Doctor."</p>

  <p>"Where does it seem to catch you&mdash;internal intercostals?"</p>

  <p>The doctor gave the nurse a slow wink that tipped up the corner of his
  friendly mouth. They were sharing a little mystery. Paige thought he knew
  what it was and decided to be dumb. Perhaps he could bluff it out.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to talk English to me, Doctor," he replied, guileless as a
  child.</p>

  <p>"Now don't you try to kid me, my son." Dr. Stafford pointed a challenging
  finger close to Paige's innocent eyes. "When I took off that splintage I
  found it to be the work of an experienced surgeon. And you put it on because
  your friend Ingram said so. He denied that you were a doctor, but I know
  better. I have just seen the plate and the adjustment is perfect. The
  fracture was slightly comminuted, too, if you know what that means&mdash;and
  I damn' well know you do.... <i>Now!</i> Just where does it grip you when you
  inhale. You may tell me 'in English' if you don't mean to come clean about
  yourself.... Where? Ribs or belly?"</p>

  <p>"Cordiform tendon," growled Paige.</p>

  <p>"Attaboy!" Stafford nodded a triumphant I-told-you-so at the nurse. "Now,
  how do you want your eggs, Dr. Paige?"</p>

  <p>"Promptly.... How's Ingram?"</p>

  <p>"Fit as a fiddle and asking about you. That must have been a frightful
  trip. You got your lame diaphragm by heavy lifting. Mr. Ingram says you not
  only had him to look after, but had to keep a vigilant eye on your rascally
  guide. Never mind&mdash;we're going to make it hot for that fellow. I don't
  see how you managed."</p>

  <p>"My dog helped. She stayed very close to him with her nose wrinkled and
  all her teeth on display."</p>

  <p>"I see she got her name in the papers this morning," said the doctor.
  "Miss Adams, go and see if you can find a copy of <i>The Chronicle....</i> We
  had a little accident in the mine, late yesterday afternoon," he explained.
  "Some timbers slipped and produced a couple of cracked heads and a flock of
  bad contusions. Young fellow here&mdash;Johnny Malloy&mdash;wires mine news
  to San Francisco. He dropped in to inquire about our patients just as your
  party was arriving. We had a lot of excitement. Your dog was racing about in
  the hall with this piece of pants in her mouth; you were dead to the world;
  your friend wouldn't talk. Naturally, Johnny was curious."</p>

  <p>"Printed our names, too, I suppose," muttered Paige, rather testily and
  revealing a good deal of anxiety.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;we did not give him your names. Your friend objected. However,
  Johnny heard him call to the dog. That's how he got her name. And I think
  somebody told him that the broken leg had been uncommonly well looked after,
  which led him to hint&mdash;as you will notice&mdash;that the whole affair
  seemed a bit mysterious."</p>

  <p>Paige took up the paper which the nurse had laid on the bed before
  scurrying away with the announcement that she would be back presently with
  his breakfast. The brief dispatch had dealt jocularly with Sylvia's revenge
  on a disobliging guide who had refused to be of assistance to an injured
  friend of hers. The accident had occurred in the mountains and a serious
  fracture had been expertly treated. Both the injured man and his
  extraordinarily competent friend, who knew more about first-aid than most,
  had seemed to prefer that their names be kept out of the news.</p>

  <p>When he had finished reading, Paige glanced up to find Stafford's eyes
  fixed on him interestedly. He seemed to have something perplexing on his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"I feel forced to say"&mdash;he lowered his voice&mdash;"that you two
  strangers, and this long-nosed Johnny Malloy, have placed me in an awkward
  position. This hospital is maintained by the Grey Lode Mining Corporation for
  the exclusive use of its employees. Emergency cases from the immediate
  neighbourhood are accepted, but the company is very particular about full
  reports on outsiders. I'm especially sensitive because I really don't belong
  on this job. I am filling in for my friend Newcomb, who is the chief here,
  while he is East on a three months' leave. The company will see this paper
  and ask questions. As for you, a day's rest should put you right, but I'm
  obliged to report on you just the same. Ingram can't be moved for some time.
  He will have to make arrangements. We will want to know more about both of
  you than you have been disposed to tell."</p>

  <p>"I understand your position, Doctor," conceded Paige. "Ingram's all
  right."</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope so." Stafford's tone was curt. "We don't want to get
  ourselves in a scrape.... Sure he isn't wanted somewhere&mdash;for
  something?"</p>

  <p>Paige pulled a wry grin and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said drily. "That's his trouble. He isn't wanted
  anywhere&mdash;by anybody. Lost his job. But&mdash;he can tell you about
  himself. Probably will, if you explain your reasons for wanting to know."</p>

  <p>"That's good. How about <i>you</i>?" Stafford's voice was more
  conciliatory.</p>

  <p>"It's a bit different with me. I can assure you that no trouble will come
  to the hospital or you because of my being here. But my little problem isn't
  the sort of thing that I care to talk about. In short&mdash;I don't want
  anybody to know where I am, and I'd like to keep my name out of
  circulation."</p>

  <p>His breakfast had arrived now, and Dr. Stafford, not wishing to pursue
  their talk before the nurse, picked up the paper and strolled out of the
  room, promising to return later in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>He wished this affair hadn't turned up. It had been the first annoying
  situation since he had taken over for Newcomb. The brief assignment had been
  very pleasant, after his long and dangerous twenty months in the Government's
  research laboratory in a Montana forest studying the virus of the deadly
  Rocky Mountain spotted fever. He would be expected to return to that
  pestilential little workshop three weeks from to-day to resume a monotonous,
  repulsive, and extra-hazardous occupation&mdash;deucedly important, but
  decidedly unpleasant and risky. Three young bacteriologists had died up
  there. It would be unfortunate if, during his brief tenure at Grey Lode
  Hospital, the institution became implicated in some kind of mess. Couldn't
  take the chance of harbouring a couple of criminals. These chaps might be all
  right&mdash;but he had only their word for it.</p>

  <p>Back in his little office Stafford looked again at the copy he had made of
  the only scrap of writing they had found in Paige's pockets. Having noted
  Ingram's reluctance to confide, and disturbed by the obvious lie he had told
  when asked if Paige was a physician, he had felt obliged to go through their
  clothes. It went against the grain to do it. Both were abundantly supplied
  with money, but that was no recommendation; it might even be considered a
  reason for suspicion. The only thing he had found on Paige was an address
  written on the stationery of the Hotel St. Lawrence&mdash;"Harcourt, 9721
  Marlborough."</p>

  <p>This Harcourt, whoever he was, might be willing to talk. If young Paige
  was trying to lose himself out here&mdash;which certainly didn't look very
  well for a highly-trained surgeon, prowling about in the hills, unwilling to
  give himself a clean bill when queried by a colleague&mdash;perhaps this
  Harcourt, man or woman, might supply a few of the missing links.... For a
  while he meditated a letter of inquiry; then an idea occurred to him. He
  pursed his lips and nodded. This, he thought, should fetch a query from
  Harcourt. Opening his pocketknife, he cut the provocative paragraph from
  <i>The Chronicle,</i> slipped it into an envelope bearing the hospital
  insignia, wrote his name below the device, addressed it&mdash;as bluntly
  laconic as the memorandum he had found in Paige's pocket&mdash;and affixed
  airmail postage.</p>

  <p>The company messenger lounged in with a capacious leather bag slung from
  his shoulder and Stafford handed him the outgoing mail. It was a hot day,
  they agreed.... Miss Adams stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Paige would like to speak to you," she said.</p>

  <p>Stafford nodded and proceeded down the hall to Number 63. Paige was
  sitting up in bed. He had shaved, and his lean jaw was flexed determinedly.
  It was evident that he was in a serious mood.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for coming, Dr. Stafford. I want to apologize for putting you
  in an embarrassing position. I am ready to tell you about myself. It would
  please me if you were to regard it as a confidence&mdash;at least as much of
  it as may not be absolutely necessary to your report."</p>

  <p>Stafford pushed the door shut, straddled a chair, and folded his arms on
  the back of it.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said quietly. "Tell it straight&mdash;because I am
  disposed to believe you."</p>

  <p>Ingram bore his misfortune with easy fortitude, chuckling drily when
  sympathy was offered. He was really having the time of his life. What with a
  half-dozen impressionable nurses competing in their efforts to entertain the
  urbane stranger, and Dr. Stafford's leisurely calls, and Newell Paige's
  whole-afternoon visits, Ingram's sagged morale improved until it was evident
  that the accident which had detained him was worth all the bother and
  discomfort it had cost.</p>

  <p>Nor had Paige fretted over his unanticipated sojourn at the Grey Lode
  Mine. Stafford had secured comfortable accommodation for him in the company's
  club-house, where several of the bachelors among the younger executives were
  quartered and where their married seniors drifted in after dinner for cards
  and pipe-chat.</p>

  <p>He had been very cordially received. Nobody seemed actively curious about
  him, his presence being amply explained by the fact that his friend was laid
  up. Only one trifling incident, which occurred during the first week, caused
  him an anxious moment. Twice he had been invited to join in at the nightly
  poker game pursued by a few of the junior members in the far corner of the
  big smoking-lounge. He had declined graciously, and when pressed had replied
  that it wouldn't be quite fair to pit 'beginner's luck' against experienced
  skill.</p>

  <p>One night about ten&mdash;Stafford had been over to spend an hour, and had
  just left&mdash;Newell was starting up the open stairs to go to his room when
  Billy Masters, a callow young chemical engineer, called to him from the card
  table. Masters had been steadily winning all evening and was in an expansive
  mood. The stakes had not been large, but he seemed pleased with the little
  handful of crumpled ones and twos and fives which represented his
  success.</p>

  <p>"Better join us, Mr. Paige," he called, his tone just a bit derisive, "and
  contribute something to this worthy cause."</p>

  <p>Not wishing to appear standoffish, Newell turned, came down, and
  approached the table, inquiring idly how they had all fared. The losers
  grinned sourly and Masters pointed to his winnings.</p>

  <p>"Want a stack of chips?" he inquired. "The blue ones are a quarter, the
  red ones are only a dime, and the white ones can be had for a nickel. A few
  white ones&mdash;maybe?"</p>

  <p>The smile that Paige had brought to the table was replaced by a dark
  frown. He rolled his magazine tightly in hands that seemed to need some
  distracting employment, and replied, "Thank you. I'm turning in."</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a Scotsman," drawled Masters, without looking up.</p>

  <p>The other four glanced inquisitively at Paige, observing his flush of
  annoyance and wondering how much of this sort of thing he would be likely to
  take without active resentment.</p>

  <p>"I regret to have conveyed the idea that I am too stingy to risk some
  small change," he said frostily. "I don't care to play&mdash;but I wouldn't
  mind cutting the deck with you, Mr. Masters."</p>

  <p>"That's the proper spirit!" Masters handed the cards to Madison, with a
  gesture inviting him to shuffle the pack. "How much&mdash;ten dollars? Best
  two out of three?"</p>

  <p>"As you like." Paige's nonchalant rejoinder hinted that it was a very
  small matter, the outcome of which gave him no concern.</p>

  <p>"Let's say twenty," suggested Masters, attempting to be equally
  casual.</p>

  <p>"Let's say a hundred&mdash;and one cut instead of two out of three." Paige
  drew out his wallet and laid his bet on the table, the money in one
  piece.</p>

  <p>"Agreed!" snapped Masters, counting his wager in bills of various
  denominations. It was observed that he held his pocket-book rather close to
  his face as he extracted the bulk of the money, obviously unwilling to reveal
  the strength&mdash;or more likely, the weakness&mdash;of his resources.</p>

  <p>Madison shoved the deck towards the newcomer, the others leaning forward
  in their chairs attentively. Paige unconcernedly made a cut and produced the
  Jack of diamonds. Masters more deliberately drew the eight-spot of spades and
  gave his money an impatient flick of his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Want to cut again&mdash;maybe?" asked Paige, making no move to pick up
  his winnings.</p>

  <p>Masters growled his agreement and pushed the deck back to Madison for
  another shuffle.</p>

  <p>"Two hundred?" Paige inquired.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" said Masters arrogantly; then, grimly, added, "Provided you'll
  take my IOU for half of it if I lose. I'm not in the habit of carrying
  everything I own on my person."</p>

  <p>"It's good with me," consented Paige indifferently. "Your first cut this
  time."</p>

  <p>Masters' hand trembled a little as he slowly exhibited the ten of clubs
  and swallowed noisily. Paige topped it with the Queen of spades.</p>

  <p>"Another?" he asked, with exasperating disinterest.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that will do for me, thanks," muttered Masters, scribbling a
  memorandum on the back of his card, the others quietly winking at one another
  with sly grins.</p>

  <p>Paige pocketed the money with no show of pleasure, said good night with
  quiet cordiality, and started upstairs again.</p>

  <p>He left his door open, knowing that Masters would pass it presently on the
  way to his own room. It was almost an hour before he came up.</p>

  <p>"Come in here a minute, won't you?"</p>

  <p>Masters paused at the summons and strolled in, hands deep in his pockets,
  an unpleasant grin twisting his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, won't you?" invited Paige pleasantly. "I hope you're not going
  to be offended, but I don't want your money. There it is." He laid it on the
  table beside Masters's elbow.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;excuse <i>me!"</i> snarled Masters, rising. "I'm no piker, I
  want you to understand!"</p>

  <p>"You sit down there, young fellow!" commanded Paige, crossing the room to
  close the door. "And keep your shirt on!"</p>

  <p>The sudden outburst, so unexpected, dazed Masters a little and he resumed
  his seat, scowling darkly.</p>

  <p>"You say you're no piker," continued Paige, towering over him ominously.
  "You tried to insult me before your friends down there to-night, feeling
  pretty sure that as a guest of this club I would ignore it rather than have a
  row. And I let you get away with it. You're a reckless, cocky young ass,
  working on a small salary and pretending you're a sport. You probably have
  spells of wishing you could save up enough money to go back to Colorado and
  marry that girl ... I suppose&mdash;" His voice suddenly lost its crisp
  derision, and he resumed his chair, tipping it back against the wall&mdash;"I
  suppose there is a girl, there or somewhere..." The half-finished sentence
  trailed off in a soliloquizing rumble as if he had completely forgotten his
  quarrel with the contemptible little Masters, who sat staring,
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>A whole minute passed in silence, Paige dreamily puffing at his pipe, his
  far-away eyes&mdash;mere narrow slits&mdash;searching in the milling crowd
  for a final glimpse of a jaunty little red feather on a snug little black hat
  aslant on bright-gold curls.... Her last words came back, words spoken
  half-chokingly, but very tenderly.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said, rousing to attention. "As I was saying&mdash;you
  shouldn't be throwing your money away. But if you're bound to throw it away,
  you'll have to throw it at somebody else besides me. I don't want it and I
  won't have it." He pointed again at the crumpled bills on the table and began
  tearing up the profligate little I.O.U. into small, precise squares.</p>

  <p>Masters scowled and grinned.</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> would have kept it," he muttered, "if I had won it from
  <i>you."</i></p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Paige, after a pause. "Perhaps not. I've a notion that, if
  you had reasons to suspect that my impetuous bet had stripped me clean, you
  would have hunted me up afterwards and given it back to me. I don't like you,
  Masters, but&mdash;well&mdash;something tells me you could be depended on to
  do about the same thing I'm doing, under similar circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," said Masters, elaborately dry. "You flatter me."</p>

  <p>Paige nodded slowly. "Yes," he drawled, "I see that&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>There was an extended silence, Masters blinking rapidly as he meditated an
  appropriate reply. Paige studied his face and gave way to a smile.</p>

  <p>"A short time ago," he said cordially, "a very fine old chap was telling
  me about his experience in learning to drive a car. Fellow in front of him
  would come to a sudden stop without signalling. People all along the line
  would come to sudden stops, each cursing the man ahead of him for failing to
  signal and no one of them putting out a hand to let the man behind him know
  what was going to happen.... To-night you were hectoring me, probably because
  somebody had been hectoring you. You may not have been conscious of your
  desire to pass along your grievance to someone else, but I think it likely
  you've been recently ruffled. That so?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see how it's any of your business," grumbled Masters.</p>

  <p>"There you are," said Paige quietly. "Just as I thought. It isn't any of
  my business, but what I've been saying is true. Somebody has been getting
  your goat, and because you felt bereft without it, you thought you'd get
  mine. And I'm bound to say you did."</p>

  <p>Masters ventured a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;I've had a rough day, all right. Old Man Huntington. Tired of
  licking his boots. He's my boss in the lab. Mean as hell!"</p>

  <p>"Had it ever occurred to you that the old man may have been having his
  tail twisted by some of the Higher Ups?"</p>

  <p>"I hope they tie a hard knot in it!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps his immediate superior has an infected tooth&mdash;or a kidney
  stone."</p>

  <p>Masters noisily exhaled a cynical sigh through a cloud of cigarette
  smoke.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's easy enough for you to dope up some psychology that
  explains it all very nicely. If somebody had handed you a dirty deal, maybe
  you wouldn't be quite so damned calm. You're probably sitting on top of the
  world. You act like it, anyway."</p>

  <p>After Masters had sauntered out&mdash;he had refused the money, but was
  plainly weakening in his resolution not to accept it and would undoubtedly
  comply by to-morrow&mdash;Newell lighted his pipe and gave himself to some
  rather cheerful reflections. This young cub had felt sure that nobody could
  be so damned calm if he had experienced a serious injustice.</p>

  <p>Sitting on top of the world! That was the impression he had made on
  Masters. Perhaps Dean Harcourt's philosophy wasn't so fantastically
  unpractical after all. It couldn't be dismissed with an indulgent grin and a
  smothered "Oh&mdash;yeah?" Now that Newell had tried to explain it to
  Masters, it sounded in every way plausible. At all events, he had impressed
  Masters as a person who had himself well in hand, with nothing to worry about
  and possessed of a sense of&mdash;of what? The haunting phrase, so frequently
  recurring on Mrs. Dexter's pretty lips, came back to him with a fresh
  vitality. "Personal adequacy." That's what young Masters had seen at work in
  him.</p>

  <p>"Come here, Sylvia."</p>

  <p>With a prodigious yawn, she rose, came to his chair, squatted facing him,
  and looked up inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"I observe," confided Newell, "that you took no embarrassing interest in
  the savage remarks I exchanged with Mr. Masters. I presume your serenity may
  be accounted for on the ground that you knew I could have pitched him through
  the window without your assistance. You showed excellent taste, I think, in
  remaining quietly seated on your haunches and not giving way to your private
  sentiments. I thank you. As I have often remarked in your presence, it's a
  pity you can't talk. I am sure there is something you would like to say."</p>

  <p>Sylvia yawned again, self-consciously, and, assuming that the brief
  conference was adjourned, went to her favourite corner and sprawled on her
  cherished steamer rug.</p>

  <p>"I've something else to say to you."</p>

  <p>She returned deliberately and, putting her forepaws on his knees, thrust
  her muzzle so close to Newell's face that he leaned back a little to dodge
  the caress which Sylvia occasionally bestowed if he was not vigilantly on
  guard. He gently tapped her on the nose with an impressive finger-tip.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia," he declared solemnly, "perhaps you hadn't noticed it, but we're
  sitting on top of the world."</p>

  <p>As an interested and competent student of the <i>genus homo,</i> not only
  in respect to the creature's physical structure but its psychological states,
  Newell Paige was well aware that a superficial view of a casual acquaintance
  is likely to be misleading.</p>

  <p>On meeting a stranger, he often found himself speculating on the probable
  depth, contents, configuration, and natural history of the subterranean
  mountain whose exposed summit, painstakingly landscaped, had possessed its
  comparatively little self of an identity, a name, a tongue, a fleet, and a
  flag. Sometimes, on further acquaintance, he had made dismaying discoveries
  just below the sea-line, and again, of course, he had been happily
  surprised.</p>

  <p>He presumed that there were two Staffords, but he was totally unprepared
  for his first glimpse of the sub-Stafford. So much of the Dr. Sidney Stafford
  as had been candidly on display was rather noisily amiable, fussily
  energetic, and artificially gay with a good-humour that seemed to be operated
  under forced draught.</p>

  <p>Newell couldn't help liking him, though he found the man's nervous tension
  somewhat wearing after an hour with him. More often than not, Stafford came
  to the club-house about nine and, after a breezy round of the loungers, whom
  he hilariously teased and spoofed without regard for age, rank, or brevity of
  acquaintance, he would suggest to Paige that they go up to his room for a
  quiet chat. Paige smiled at the recollection of these quiet chats. Stafford
  was never still for an instant, for ever lighting his pipe which seemed
  always to be out, shifting from one chair to another, pacing the floor,
  tousling Sylvia, fiddling with the magazines on the table.</p>

  <p>On a couple of occasions, Newell had tried to sound him concerning his
  work in the research laboratory in Montana, but his replies were laconic and
  the conversation was swiftly led into other quarters. When Newell persisted,
  Stafford waved the subject aside with a dismissing gesture of his pipe. The
  Government was trying to find out what was the source of spotted fever, that
  was all. They had been at it long enough to know that the virus was carried
  by some sort of insect&mdash;a wood tick, very likely&mdash;and now the job
  was to find what manner of poison the bug carried, and where he got it, and
  under what circumstances he made use of it. Then&mdash;if they ever
  discovered these facts&mdash;doubtless they could contrive an antitoxin.</p>

  <p>"Damned tiresome job," said Stafford, and waved his pipe to indicate he
  was ready now to talk about something more interesting, such as travel tales
  and stories of adventure on the sea and in the jungle. He had seemed almost
  obsessed by blood-freezing yarns of foolhardy fellows risking their lives in
  big-game hunts, and he had an inexhaustible repertoire of frightfulness that
  made one's flesh fairly crawl. No matter what you talked about, sooner or
  later you knew you were going to be plopped down into tall jungle-grass for a
  debate with a nest of cobras, or pitched out of the boat into a flock of
  crocodiles.</p>

  <p>Sometimes it seemed as if Stafford studied your face to see how you liked
  the idea. He'd let a shark bite your leg off at the knee, and then pause at
  whatever he had been fussing with&mdash;his hands were never in
  repose&mdash;to stare at you for your reactions. Tarantulas in your bed,
  exotic nettles that pricked your hand and grinned at you while you swelled up
  and died. Odd mentality&mdash;Sidney Stafford's. Funny thing&mdash;he never
  seemed to get going on his pet horrors in any other company but Newell's.</p>

  <p>"I should think there would be plenty of danger in your tick business,"
  Newell had remarked.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;now and then," Stafford had replied, off-hand, rummaging through
  his pockets for the match-box that was always eluding him, "now and then...
  mostly dull and nasty tinkering with bug-juice... ever take any special
  interest in bacteriology?"</p>

  <p>"Very much. If I hadn't gone in for surgery, I might have moved in that
  direction, I think."</p>

  <p>"Ever find time since school days," asked Stafford, "to squint into a
  microscope?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;quite often. It was a little hobby. I <i>own</i> a Greenhough
  Binocular."</p>

  <p>"My uncle!" shouted Stafford. "I'll say it was a little hobby!"</p>

  <p>On the sultry morning that Newell made his startling discovery of the
  sub-Stafford that was not on public view, he had dropped in at the hospital
  to take Ingram the papers. On the way out, as he passed the chief's office,
  he met the Adams girl who had looked after him when he had arrived with
  Ingram. She seemed upset about something as she closed Stafford's door behind
  her and stood holding the knob and looking frightened.</p>

  <p>"Go in there," she said huskily, "and talk to him."</p>

  <p>Stafford was slumped down in his swivel-chair with his elbows on the desk
  and his face in his hands. He looked up, heavy-eyed.</p>

  <p>"Hope I'm not intruding," said Paige. "Anything I can do?"</p>

  <p>"No." Stafford's voice was thick. "Look at that wire. Spaulding's dead; my
  chief, up there, you know. Died of it. Closest friend I ever had. The dirty
  stuff just melted him down. Sick eight hours. And practically alone, except
  for old Murray, our orderly. And here I was&mdash;safe as a baby in a
  cradle&mdash;spending my time daubing iodine on sore thumbs, while Spaulding
  was up there by himself risking his life&mdash;and losing it.... Just been
  talking to San Francisco. I'm to be relieved here in the morning. So I can go
  back. I'll be in charge now. Alone, too, until I can find somebody that's as
  big a damn' fool as I am."</p>

  <p>"Do you think <i>I</i> am?" asked Paige quietly.</p>

  <p>Stafford slowly drew himself up, leaned heavily against the desk, and
  looked him squarely in the eyes from under level brows.</p>

  <p>"Don't say that, Paige, unless you really mean it!" he growled.</p>

  <p>"I mean it, Stafford. I'm going with you."</p>

  <p>"Do you realize that it may cost you your life?"</p>

  <p>Paige nodded, and offered Stafford a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Can you be ready to go at noon to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"Quite!" Paige's eyes were shining.</p>

  <p>Stafford studied him with frank interest.</p>

  <p>"I hope," he drawled meaningly, "that you're not thinking of this as some
  sort of pleasure excursion."</p>

  <p>"No," said Paige seriously, "I understand&mdash;but I don't mind telling
  you that I was never so happy in my life. I'll be dying sometime,
  anyway&mdash;and I'd rather burn than rot."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DR. STAFFORD'S lengthy letter was, he felt, the most
  interesting communication he had ever received. And this was saying much, for
  no small part of Dean Harcourt's daily labour was the handling of
  correspondence voluminous in bulk and confidential in character.</p>

  <p>His incoming mail was of infinite variety. Most of it came from troubled
  people who had heard him speak in the Cathedral&mdash;as if to them
  individually&mdash;and, lacking either the audacity or opportunity to confer
  with him face-to-face, had, according to their respective tempers, dipped
  their pens in their hearts' blood or their livers' bile to write of every
  conceivable perplexity in moods ranging all the way from saintly resignation
  to sour despair, frequently shrilling up to shrieking crescendos of
  spank-worthy hysteria; pardonable, of course, for the times were bad and you
  couldn't blame the poor things, said the Dean, for blowing the whistle, which
  was ever so much better than blowing the boiler.</p>

  <p>Some, to be sure, were mere cranks with windy verbosities to exploit. They
  challenged him to substantiate the public statement that had pricked their
  pet balloon, waxing vehement in defence of fine-spun dogmas and
  hair-splitting categories. He did not permit such documents to annoy him.
  When he had read into one of them far enough to see which way it was headed,
  he would sigh, smile, and pass the letter across the desk to Talbot, who
  usually helped him with his mail, and Talbot, interpreting the gesture, would
  file it in the folio assigned to the housing of controversial communications
  relating to dogmas and categories&mdash;the label on which he had absurdly
  abbreviated to "Dogs and Cats."</p>

  <p>But Dean Harcourt would have considered himself seriously impoverished
  without this mounting flood of agony mail. Most people, he believed, were
  more likely to state their cases honestly and clearly in letters than under
  the stress of oral confessions in an unfamiliar atmosphere. And it was to
  these letters, the Dean freely conceded, that he owed much of his intimate
  knowledge of the various anxieties which bedevil the mind of the average
  citizen.</p>

  <p>Talbot had just left the room with the usual armful of mail bearing
  pencilled notations for his guidance in replying to fully three-fourths of
  it. Such letters as the Dean proposed to answer himself lay open on his desk.
  Stafford's he read again more slowly.</p>

  <p>He had almost given up hope of hearing from Stafford. Two months had gone
  by since his mystified receipt of the newspaper clipping and his own prompt
  reply to it.</p>

  <p>An invisible spectator, on that occasion, would have decided that Dean
  Harcourt had encountered a difficult problem. He had read the clipping
  through several times with alternating smiles and frowns. Then he had slowly
  relaxed in his tall chair, tipped back his head, and with half-closed eyes
  had sat for a long time meditatively tapping his tightly pursed lips with his
  gold pince-nez.</p>

  <p>As for the clipping itself, deduction was simple enough. Paige had
  evidently fallen in with another gentleman-vagabond who had met with an
  accident forcing them into the nearest hospital. They had refused to give
  their names, which seemed unnecessarily imprudent in Paige's case, whatever
  good&mdash;or bad&mdash;reasons the other man may have had.</p>

  <p>No&mdash;the real mystery of this affair concerned this Dr. Sidney
  Stafford's strange action in mailing him the clipping unaccompanied by a note
  of explanation&mdash;sent by air, too, as if he had thought its prompt
  delivery important. And the return address on the envelope clearly hinted
  that a reply was expected.</p>

  <p>"Harcourt"&mdash;that was the way it had been sent. Just
  "Harcourt"&mdash;nothing more&mdash;except the street and house number. Not
  even "Mr. Harcourt."</p>

  <p>It was obvious that Paige had not voluntarily provided the address. What
  other conclusion could be arrived at but that the name had been found on his
  person and probably used without his knowledge? The whole affair was very
  odd. The Dean had pondered deeply for a half-hour. Then he had reached for a
  sheet of stationery.</p>

  <p>"Dear Dr. Stafford," he wrote, "I have received the clipping from <i>The
  Chronicle</i> of San Francisco, the envelope bearing your name, which
  indicates your hope that I may make some comment, and airmail postage which
  suggests that your query is urgent.</p>

  <p>"The only dog I know named Sylvia belongs to an exceptionally able and
  trustworthy young man of thirty-one whose decision to conceal his identity is
  inconvenient and embarrassing to himself and his friends, but reflects no
  discredit on him.</p>

  <p>"If this unidentified young man in your hospital is the person I have in
  mind, you may be assured of his integrity. If he is in difficulty, please
  wire me. I shall be obliged to you for further information."</p>

  <p>And now&mdash;two months afterward&mdash;Dr. Stafford had written this
  unusual letter from Wembelton, Montana.... The Dean read it with absorbing
  interest.</p>

  <p>The first page offered a brief apology for the manner in which the
  clipping had been sent, verified the Dean's guess that Paige's pockets had
  furnished the blunt address, and explained the writer's special reasons for
  wanting to identify his patients to the full satisfaction of the Grey Lode
  Mining Corporation.</p>

  <p>On the second page Stafford had explained the nature of his own work in
  the Research Laboratory in Montana, the circumstances of his brief
  supervision of the mine hospital, the reasons for his sudden return to take
  command of the laboratory, and Paige's impulsive decision to go along.</p>

  <p>"He has talked so much about you, sir," continued the letter, "that I feel
  acquainted with you. This lonesome and dangerous business has made close
  friends of Paige and me. I haven't felt like telling him that I had informed
  you of his being in the hospital. It was an underhand trick&mdash;my sending
  you that clipping&mdash;and Paige wouldn't like to know that I had done it.
  Consequently, he does not know that I had a letter from you, and of course
  does not know that I am writing this.</p>

  <p>"I think you, as his friend, have a right to know that he is usefully
  employed on a loathsome, thoroughly nasty, poorly paid, hazardous job, and
  apparently happy in it. At present, Paige and I are the only ones here. In
  the past four years, men have come and gone, three to their graves; a
  half-dozen or so&mdash;who either couldn't stand it or saw no hope of its
  success&mdash;returning to more comfortable occupations. We have a three-room
  shack on the top of Boone Mountain, seven miles from Wembelton, a town of
  about two thousand, where not more than four men know the nature of our
  work.</p>

  <p>"The reason for this secrecy will be apparent to you. If it were generally
  known that we are up here handling the makings of spotted fever&mdash;they
  are scared to death of it, and very properly&mdash;we should be shunned when
  obliged to go down for supplies and on other necessary business. The fact is
  that the only way you can get this fever is from the virus carried by a tick
  which feeds on... we're here to find out what. So we are not 'carriers' and
  are harmless to other people. But it would be difficult to make the public
  believe that.</p>

  <p>"In the opinion of Wembelton&mdash;if Wembelton may be said to have any
  interest in us at all&mdash;we are hunters and loafers living a worthless
  existence as hermits. A couple of years ago, the Government strung a
  telephone line up here to the shack, but few people know about it and our
  number is not in the book. When we go down, we dress in rough woodsman's
  togs. We are shabby, shaggy, untalkative, and, of course, inhospitable.
  Occasional hikers and hunters are turned from the peep-hole of our door with
  a savage curse. This, I think, is the meanest part of our job&mdash;damning
  strangers off the premises. But, you see, we positively cannot let them come
  in and take the risk of exposure to the stuff we're playing with, and we
  cannot explain, for they might go away and tell about it.</p>

  <p>"The one man in town who knows the most about our affairs is the mayor and
  superintendent of the most important gold mine in this region. His name is
  Frank Gibson. If it wasn't for the Gibsons, our life would be pretty bleak.
  He's not only in full sympathy with what the Government has been trying to do
  here&mdash;his mine operatives have died like flies in some of these
  midsummer epidemics&mdash;but he makes an effort to be cordial to us who are
  here on this unpleasant errand. Gibson is very well-to-do and has a beautiful
  home. I have spent many delightful hours in it these past two years. Paige is
  fond of the Gibsons, too. Goes there quite often to see his dog. These bugs
  we are studying are just as poisonous to animals as humans. Gibson offered to
  look after the dog, but she misses Paige. He has a bad time trying to detach
  himself from her whenever he goes there. It's quite pathetic&mdash;the way
  Sylvia cries when he leaves.</p>

  <p>"This letter is far too long, and yet I haven't come to the real reason
  for my writing it. Of course I wanted you to know about Paige. He's risking
  his life in an undertaking that may or may not dispose of spotted fever. He
  is over in the lab right now, dissecting a fresh batch of blood-swollen ticks
  that we picked off a sick sheep yesterday. If he accidentally scratches his
  arm with his tweezers, the chances are he will be as dead as cold mutton by
  to-morrow morning. But he is contented, and nobody could ask for a more
  congenial companion.</p>

  <p>"Now for the real purpose of this letter. Frank Gibson told me a couple of
  days ago, when I was in his office, that about a dozen families of the more
  prosperous sort who have girls approaching college age are thinking seriously
  of organizing a private school for them and want to find some well-educated
  socially experienced young woman, recently graduated from a high-grade
  university&mdash;preferably Eastern, Gibson thinks, for the sake of importing
  a little of that atmosphere&mdash;who will come out here and supplement what
  these girls are getting in the local High School, which seems to be a very
  frail institution.</p>

  <p>"Gibson asked me if I knew of anyone who might be likely to fill the bill,
  and of course I didn't, for I have lost all contact with such matters. I told
  him I would write to you and inquire, feeling quite sure&mdash;from what
  Paige has told me of your wide acquaintance&mdash;that you might make a
  suggestion.</p>

  <p>"I fear, sir, that it has taken me a long time to arrive at the primary
  errand of this letter. I apologize for its length. When you reply, please
  address me in a plain envelope."</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt put down the letter and sat for some time absently toying
  with his paper-knife. A happy twinkle began playing about the innumerable
  pain-chiselled crows'-feet at the outer corner of his deep-set eyes...
  Phyllis!&mdash;why not?</p>

  <p>Sonia rattled her keys and opened the mail-box.</p>

  <p>"One for you, dear," she called, sorting the letters.</p>

  <p>"That would be Pat, I suppose." Phyllis, who had preceded her up the short
  flight of steps in the apartment-house lobby, waited at the open door,
  leaning wearily against its stiff tension. They had been invoicing stock all
  day. And it was as hot as Tophet. She reached for the letter.</p>

  <p>"<i>Wembelton!</i>" Bracing a foot against the insistent door, Phyllis
  tore off the envelope with impatient fingers and ran her eyes swiftly down
  the page, picking up life-saving phrases&mdash;dollar signs leading salary
  figures, the suggested date of her emancipating journey, words of welcome,
  proffers of hospitality. "Look&mdash;Sonia! I've got it!" She tried to steady
  her voice. "It's from that Mr. Gibson himself."</p>

  <p>They mounted the stairs, arm in arm, Phyllis quite beside herself with
  happy excitement. "Isn't it simply wonderful?" she kept saying. "I can't
  believe it! Aren't you glad, Sonia?"</p>

  <p>Sonia was glad. No end sorry, of course, but more relieved than she cared
  to say. It was going to be very hard to give up Phyllis. The radiant girl had
  been a godsend, coming into her life at a moment when she was desperate for
  some new interest to divert her mind from the drab little tragedy that had
  made everything seem so futile.</p>

  <p>But business in the shop was bad, with no prospect of early improvement.
  Small enterprises like Sonia's were collapsing daily. She had not confided to
  Phyllis the extent of her anxiety, but had kept up a brave front; when
  queried, she had been reassuring. "Nonsense!" she would say whenever Phyllis
  voiced her misgivings. "I couldn't possibly get along without you. Don't you
  give it another thought." The Wembelton offer had come along at the right
  time. It would be possible now to retrench considerably. She would give up
  the apartment, pare her expenses to the elementary necessities, and try to
  weather the gale.</p>

  <p>"Glad?" murmured Sonia. "Why, of course, dear. But I shall miss you
  frightfully. You know that." She jangled her keys again and unlocked their
  door. "I don't see how I can live here after you're gone."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gibson offers to advance me money for travel," called Phyllis, from
  the little hall where she had paused by the pillar light to read her letter
  more carefully.</p>

  <p>"Don't take it," counselled Sonia, from the bedroom. "Never let a man
  accommodate you in money matters. If you haven't enough on hand to see you
  out to Montana&mdash;strictly first-class and no skimping&mdash;I can let you
  have it."</p>

  <p>"You're so suspicious," reproved Phyllis, amused.</p>

  <p>"I'm so experienced," defended Sonia in a muffled tone that sounded as if
  she was already in the throes of peeling off her natty blue frock.</p>

  <p>"The Dean says," bantered Phyllis, "that we should be more trustful of our
  fellow-men. There's something about it in the Bible, too."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;the Dean never was a woman," came Sonia's reflection from deep
  in the clothes-closet. "And the Bible was written by men&mdash;for men."</p>

  <p>"Dare you to say that to the Dean," Phyllis lounged in, tossed her hat
  aside, and sat on the edge of her bed.</p>

  <p>"About the Bible? It was the Dean who told me. He says there should have
  been at least one book in the Bible written by a woman&mdash;for Women."
  Sonia turned on the shower. "Wouldn't mind taking a shot at it myself!" she
  shouted, through the racket. "I'd call it 'Prissy Proverbs'&mdash;and the
  first one would be&mdash;'All men are savages; don't trust any of 'em.'"</p>

  <p>Phyllis laughed; then sobered. A pair of entreating steel-blue eyes
  invited her to believe that Sonia's declaration of unfaith in men should be
  qualified.... She walked slowly into the living-room and laid the
  epoch-making letter on the desk. Montana! The wan little hope she had
  nourished that sometime she might meet him&mdash;just long enough to see a
  bit of relief come into that haggard face&mdash;must now be definitely given
  up. Every mile and every hour of her impending journey west would diminish
  the likelihood of a chance meeting.</p>

  <p>It wasn't, she told herself, that they could ever get together on a basis
  of friendship. But the feeling had been growing more and more intense that by
  some means she must rid herself of the torturing haunt&mdash;those dazed,
  hurt, questing eyes. In her dreams they kept following her about. In her
  mirror she caught painful glimpses of them, reflected in her own. Sometimes
  she wondered if the hallucination had not become at least mildly obsessive.
  Whenever their telephone rang, the query involuntarily flung itself into the
  front of her mind&mdash;"There!&mdash;he has come!" A telegram&mdash;a
  special-delivery letter&mdash;when she met the boy with the cap and the book
  and the pencil, her heart would pound hard. "There!" she would whisper to
  herself. "He is coming!..." Now she was going to put some more distance
  between them.</p>

  <p>But she must be happy! The Wembelton position was setting her free from a
  situation that would shortly become impossible. The Dean must be notified at
  once. What a darling he had been to find this place for her! She called him
  up and after a moment's delay heard his deep voice. Yes, he said, he too had
  heard from Mr. Gibson to-day. Yes&mdash;he was very glad it had turned out
  that way. Yes&mdash;Phyllis must come and see him soon. And Sonia too. Things
  always came out right&mdash;didn't they?&mdash;if you weren't too
  impatient.</p>

  <p>"It's almost too much to hope that <i>everything</i> will always come out
  right," Phyllis was saying into the telephone, wondering why she said it, for
  surely this was no time to be pensively doubtful.</p>

  <p>There was a little pause before the Dean commented on this remark. She
  reproached herself for having expressed the implied lament in the face of all
  he had done for her.</p>

  <p>"Don't stop hoping, Phyllis," he said slowly. "Hope is brimful of
  vitamins. Better for you than spinach."</p>

  <p>Sonia had not been very favourably impressed with Elise Graham on the
  evening they spent together at Dean Harcourt's dinner-party, and if it had
  been proposed to her on that occasion that she should share her apartment
  with the popular contralto from Kentucky the suggestion would have been
  viewed without interest.</p>

  <p>Now that they had been living together for a month, Sonia had quite
  altered her first judgment. Elise was rather a dear, after all, with a pretty
  wit, a desire to be companionable, and bubbling with refreshing news of
  interests to which Sonia had never experienced such direct access. She had
  found a good position in a well-paid church quartet and was filling club
  engagements in the surrounding suburbs. Later in the year she would be on
  tour in the Mid-West under direction of a manager. She was going to marry
  Eugene&mdash;eventually, but why not now?</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt had been responsible for their decision to join forces. It
  had come about very naturally. Sonia, sickeningly lonesome after Phyllis had
  left&mdash;she had never felt so desolate in her life as when she stood alone
  on the platform watching the red eye at the tail of the train grow smaller
  and dimmer&mdash;had closed her shop at four, the next afternoon, to seek
  comfort with the Dean.</p>

  <p>"I was rather hopeful of seeing you to-day," he had said, when she was
  seated opposite him. "In fact, I was so confident you would come that I
  ordered these violets for you, remembering that you like them."</p>

  <p>She had taken up the little vase on his desk, inhaled deeply of their shy
  fragrance, and smiled gratefully.</p>

  <p>"That's one of the many things about you, Dean Harcourt, that I'll never
  quite understand." Sonia's eyes were misty. "So many people coming to you,
  leaning on you, and yet you remember all their little likes&mdash;and their
  little hurts."</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;not all of them, unfortunately. You see, Sonia, there's a side
  of my life that would be seriously undernourished if I didn't have a few
  people in my thoughts whose welfare and happiness mean much to me. I cannot
  get about. It is too laborious to travel. I have no family life. I tire of
  reading. The evenings are long. It interests me to think about a few choice
  spirits and I spend much time wondering how they are&mdash;and what they are
  doing."</p>

  <p>"And scheming plans," added Sonia, with a knowing little pucker of her
  lips. "That was awfully sweet&mdash;what you did for Phyllis."</p>

  <p>"She got off all right, last night?"</p>

  <p>Sonia nodded, and buried her face in the cool violets.</p>

  <p>"You'll be lonely without Phyllis. That's why I had hoped I might see you
  to-day. You remember Miss Graham? She was in here, yesterday, telling me she
  was looking for a congenial place to live."</p>

  <p>"With me&mdash;you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you like her?"</p>

  <p>"I hadn't thought much about her. She seemed a bit silly at your dinner
  when she was trying to hurt Mr. Corley. We were amused over her pretence of
  intimate friendship with that Mr. Parker who had done so much for her. I
  happen to know that it's little enough she knew about him. She didn't even
  know his real name."</p>

  <p>"Do you?"</p>

  <p>"Phyllis told me. He is Dr. Paige&mdash;the man who made the terrible
  mistake in her mother's operation. Didn't you know?" Sonia shook her head
  involuntarily, as she often did when anticipating a negative reply.</p>

  <p>The Dean had dropped his pen on the floor and after several efforts to
  retrieve it was assisted by his guest. Sonia carefully scrubbed off the point
  with a piece of crumpled paper from the waste-basket and returned to her
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Sonia. What were we talking about? Oh, yes&mdash;Elise." The
  Dean's tone was dry&mdash;just a bit office-like. It made Sonia grin. What a
  canny old darling he was! "Elise is an interesting person and she is looking
  for an interesting companion. I took the liberty of asking her if she
  remembered you. She seemed much pleased. I told her I would speak to you
  about it."</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to take her in with me?" Sonia searched his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why not? She would be pleasant company."</p>

  <p>"Any other reason?... Because, if there is, I ought to be let into the
  secret, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>The Dean regarded her reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"And after I went to all the trouble to get you the violets, Sonia, you
  calmly sit there and hint that I'd keep a secret from you."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I dare say I'll find out what I'm expected to do," she
  countered, pretending a pout.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," replied the Dean, with the merest suggestion of a smile.</p>

  <p>"Will I hear from her?"</p>

  <p>"Very soon. I'll drop her a line at once."</p>

  <p>"Shall I go now?" she asked childishly.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Want to show the next lady in?"</p>

  <p>She pulled off her pretty hat and walked to the door of the little
  dressing-room, not bothering to close it while she stood toying with her
  exquisitely coiffured blue-black hair before the mirror in plain sight of the
  Dean. The spontaneous gesture of unrestraint implied a filial affection that
  brought a brooding tenderness into his shadowed eyes. Returning, she paused
  for a moment at his side, detained by his outstretched hand. Sonia took it in
  both of hers and held it tightly.</p>

  <p>"Sonia, my dear," he said gently, "you and I have a little job to do. And
  as I am sworn to secrecy I fear I can't co-operate with you very helpfully.
  But you will know exactly what your own part is, when the time comes."</p>

  <p>"Is it&mdash;something&mdash;about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you'd better run along now. She will be waiting for you."</p>

  <p>"Thanks! That's all I wanted to know."</p>

  <p>"That's good," rejoined the Dean, as she slowly released his hand and
  moved away. "I wish somebody would tell me all <i>I</i> want to know."</p>

  <p>In a week it was arranged, and Elise had moved in. Sonia had been somewhat
  reserved at first, partly because she felt a bit ill at ease with a
  comparative stranger in her house after the many months of close comradeship
  with Phyllis; partly, too, because she had had a letter, that afternoon,
  brimming with unusual and absorbing interest. It was difficult to think about
  much else, and Elise found her rather more preoccupied, on the evening of her
  arrival, than she had expected.</p>

  <p>Phyllis had written lengthily of her first impressions. The Gibsons had
  met her at the train&mdash;delightful people, Mr. G. tall and slim, Mrs. G.
  short and fat, young Gerry sweetly pert and pleasantly spoiled. Drove home in
  a big car. Huge house. Plenty of servants. Almost everything shiny new.</p>

  <p>"And what do you think was the first thing I saw when I went in? I'm
  trying to write about it calmly, but I never was so completely at a loss to
  know what to do. I tell you, for a minute I was paralysed! Mrs. Gibson was
  leading the way through the wide hall. I saw this red dog lying there, chin
  on front paws, looking as if it had lost its last friend, and it seemed odd
  to me that it didn't get up, as any normal dog ought to do, to welcome the
  family. Well&mdash;if you'll believe it&mdash;as soon as I passed the dog, it
  scrambled to its feet and began to jump up on me, and Mr. Gibson, following
  me, shouted, 'What do you suppose has got into that dog?' Mrs. Gibson seemed
  terribly embarrassed. Then it occurred to her that I might want to go at once
  to my room, so we went up, and the dog came to. She tried to drive it
  downstairs, but it kept right beside me, so close I could hardly keep on my
  feet. I told her she might as well let the dog stay; that it didn't bother
  me; and she said it was the oddest thing&mdash;for Sylvia didn't pay any
  attention to anybody.... So I closed the door and sat down, a little weak in
  the knees, and Sylvia came and put her two front feet on my lap and stood
  there looking into my face with her mouth wide open and her red tongue
  lolling out, and her eyes fairly popping with excitement. You would have
  sworn she was wanting to talk&mdash;the way she would close her mouth, and
  swallow, and then open it again, panting, just as if she was ready now to say
  it&mdash;whatever it was. Well&mdash;I don't want you to think I'm a baby. I
  was tired from the long trip, and about ready to do something silly. And I
  was lonesome too, dear, away off from everything.... I put my arms round
  Sylvia's neck and held her big soft head against my face and cried until I
  was completely frazzled. And&mdash;I'm half-ashamed to tell you this, though
  I know you'll understand&mdash;I let that crazy dog lick my face and my neck
  and my hair until I smelled like a spoiled steak and looked like a peeled
  onion. When I couldn't stand it any more, we went into the bathroom and
  looked at ourselves, Sylvia standing up beside me with her paws on the basin.
  Then the whole thing began to seem funny and I laughed until my stomach
  ached. Really&mdash;I wasn't fit to be seen. I don't know what they thought
  of me. I didn't try to go down for an hour. Sylvia doesn't leave me. It's
  just a bit embarrassing. Wherever I go&mdash;there she is."</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Gibson explained that the dog had been left in their care by a
  friend of Mr: Gibson's who is up in the mountains hunting. This sounds a bit
  odd. You'd think a hunter wouldn't park his dog somewhere. They don't seem to
  want to talk about it. Of course I'm consumed by curiosity."</p>

  <p>Sonia had finished the rest of the letter hastily. Then she went to the
  telephone and called Dean Harcourt.</p>

  <p>"I've heard from Phyllis."</p>

  <p>"Good! Make the trip comfortably?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. She is stopping at the Gibsons' until she locates permanent
  living-quarters. Who do you think met her at the door when she arrived?"</p>

  <p>"One of the Pharaohs."</p>

  <p>"<i>Sylvia!"</i></p>

  <p>"Sylvia <i>who?"</i></p>

  <p>"Don't you know?"</p>

  <p>"How should I?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Sylvia Paige!"</i> Sonia's voice rose a little higher than she had
  intended&mdash;almost an impatient shriek. There was a pause.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" The Dean's rising inflection hinted that he was mildly interested.
  "So he's out in that country, is he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;it's a strange coincidence." Sonia's tone indicated that there
  was a great deal more she could say.</p>

  <p>"And how are you?" he asked paternally.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'm just about the way you'd think I'd be&mdash;with a big
  mystery on my hands&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I realize that," said the Dean steadily&mdash;though Sonia felt
  that he was smiling: it seemed somehow to get into his calm
  enunciation&mdash;"and is Elise living with you yet?"</p>

  <p>"Comes to-night."</p>

  <p>There was another long pause&mdash;so long that Sonia said "Hello?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you'd better not confide anything to her about Sylvia&mdash;yet
  awhile. If she has anything to impart, let her do it. I'm told it is
  customary&mdash;anyhow&mdash;for the visiting lady to deal first."</p>

  <p>Then Sonia laughed&mdash;and murmured something into the telephone that
  sounded like an endearment that had got itself tangled up with an
  exasperation. He was an old meanie, she reflected, as she plopped the
  telephone down, but he was also an old dear.</p>

  <p>Elise had returned very late from a rehearsal followed by a party and for
  a half-hour had been luxuriating on the sofa in a pink negligee, reading her
  mail. Suddenly she sat up and perforated the midnight silence with a
  startling, "Well&mdash;I'll <i>be</i>!&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sonia, curled up in a big chair on the other side of the lamp, deep in the
  most exciting episode of a detective story, responded to the clamour with a
  jerk, and dropped her book on the floor.</p>

  <p>"I've found out who Nathan Parker is!" declared Elise, measuring her words
  dramatically.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;who is he?" asked Sonia, still jumpy. "Nathan Parker?"</p>

  <p>"Come here! I'll tell you a story that will beat the one you're reading."
  Elise moved over and made room. "You've often heard me speak of my pet
  cousin, Clay Brock. Lately he has been seeing a lot of a young nurse at
  Parkway Hospital. The other night there was a party&mdash;nurses and
  medicals, mostly&mdash;and Clay fell into conversation with the Head Nurse,
  Miss Ogilvie.... Listen!...</p>

  <p>"'She wanted to know where I lived and I told her about Leeds. She asked
  me about my people and I told her about you. She seemed interested in your
  story, so I told her about Mr. Parker and all he had done to give you a push.
  Then she wanted to know about Mr. Parker&mdash;most inquisitive woman I ever
  saw, I think&mdash;and I told her a good deal. When I mentioned Sylvia, she
  shut up like a clam and grew very sober.</p>

  <p>"'Later in the evening, as we were leaving, she pulled me aside and said
  she wanted to talk to me, and would I come to see her, the next afternoon. I
  did&mdash;and she told me that Mr. Parker was Dr. Newell Paige who had been
  Dr. Endicott's assistant surgeon and had run away after an operation in which
  the patient died. All that will be interesting enough to you, I imagine, if
  he never told you himself, but the rest of the story is a knock-out! I don't
  know whether anything can ever be done about it, but Miss Ogilvie says the
  surgical mistake was made by <i>old man Endicott!</i> She saw it with her own
  eyes! It was this way, if I can explain it so you'll understand. The old boy
  was doing a kidney excision. The renal artery is well covered with a thick
  sheath of membranes. He was all shot to pieces, that morning&mdash;day of the
  first big crash on the Stock Exchange, and he had just got word of his heavy
  losses&mdash;so, Miss Ogilvie says, he was in no condition to be operating at
  all, much less on such a job as that.</p>

  <p>"'Well&mdash;Endicott failed to dissect out the artery from the fatty
  sheath and naturally the tie slipped off and the patient died on the table.
  And here's where Paige comes in. He had applied the ligature. So it's his
  fault. And why didn't he deny it? Because&mdash;says Miss Ogilvie&mdash;he
  had been almost literally brought up by Endicott and was dippy in his
  devotion to him. She says it's a clear case that Paige decided to take the
  rap himself, and save the old man's reputation.</p>

  <p>"'And there never has been a peep out of Dr. Endicott on the subject. He
  isn't known ever to have inquired what became of Paige. Lately he hasn't been
  doing very much surgery. He delivered the convocation lecture at the opening
  of the term. It was the only time I ever saw him, and he seemed to me rather
  fagged and listless, though maybe I was expecting too much. I saw an article
  about him, one time, that played up his tremendous energy, etc. When he left
  the platform, he looked to me as if he was shuffling off to an engagement in
  the cemetery. Now that I've been thinking over Miss Ogilvie's tale, it occurs
  to me that he had the appearance of a man who had seen a ghost. (I reckon
  that's all imagination on my part, for I didn't think of him that way at the
  time.)</p>

  <p>"'I reckon it was impudent, but I couldn't help inquiring why she hadn't
  informed somebody so that justice could be done Paige, and then she grew
  sulky and didn't want to talk any more about it. I think she's neurotic and
  apt to go off at half-cock and then reproach herself for being so chatty. I
  have a hunch that she is in love with Paige, or has been. Anyway&mdash;he's
  on her mind. I'm sure I don't know why she waits nearly a year&mdash;and then
  tells <i>me.</i> Perhaps she had to get it out of her system.</p>

  <p>"'Of course I'm not in a position to do anything about it. If it ever came
  to old Endicott's ears that a measly little first-year medical had bobbed up
  with a story fit to ruin him, I'd go back to washing dishes at the Mansion.
  And yet it does seem pretty cold-blooded, after all the kindness we had from
  Paige, for us to do and say nothing while he rambles about the country with
  Sylvia. You haven't heard anything more from him, have you?"</p>

  <p>"'You can't believe everything you hear around a place like this, but
  there's a persistent rumour that Endicott is tapering off and likely to
  retire at the end of the year. It would be rather too bad if the old boy
  passed out before somebody gives him a chance to come clean and save his
  soul&mdash;in case you've not become too sophisticated to believe in hell and
  all that sort of nonsense.'"</p>

  <p>Sonia had not been as much amazed over the letter as Elise had expected.
  She had listened calmly, her eyes moody, meditative.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that terrible?" said Elise, prodding Sonia to some appropriate
  comment. "Do you realize," she urged, "what a frightful thing this is?"</p>

  <p>After a long moment, Sonia, stirred from her thoughts, brought her eyes
  slowly back to the mystified and half-miffed Elise, nodded several times,
  woodenly, and then, leaning forward with an apologetic expression, she said,
  rather huskily, "Sorry, dear... What was that you just now said to me?"</p>

  <p>Elise drew an audible sigh of carefully disciplined exasperation, reached
  over the end of the sofa, and picked up the book that had slid out of Sonia's
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to read this, I think," she said, with precise irony. "It must
  be very absorbing."</p>

  <p>Sonia had very soft, pretty hands, and took such extraordinarily good care
  of them that Elise had not suspected the sharpness of her claws, or she
  would&mdash;she reflected afterward&mdash;have been a little more tactful in
  offering her rebuke. There came a sudden hardness into Sonia's eyes.</p>

  <p>"You think I've not been listening to that letter, don't you?
  Well&mdash;let me tell you something! I'm a whole lot more stirred up over it
  than you are, if you want to know. And after all that Dr. Paige has done for
  you, helping you to a career, you haven't the slightest intention of moving a
  finger to clear things up for him!... I never saw him&mdash;<i>but I mean to
  get into it!"</i></p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;my goodness&mdash;Sonia!" Elise swallowed hard and her eyes
  swam with sudden tears. "Who would ever have thought that you could pop off
  like that!"</p>

  <p>Sonia laid a hand on her knee.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, won't you?" she entreated contritely. "I didn't mean to hurt
  you." And to prove it, Sonia went out to the refrigerator, returning
  presently with an avocado&mdash;one of Elise's failings&mdash;and some
  sandwiches.</p>

  <p>At one o'clock, her feelings quite repaired, Elise yawned off to bed.
  Sonia sat very still for an hour, on the sofa, her forehead pressed hard
  against her knees, her arms clasping herself into a compact little bundle of
  earnest speculation concerning the audacious thing she hoped to do. When the
  clock struck two, she went to the telephone, dialled a number, and waited,
  eyes closed. A voice growled response and she came to brisk attention.</p>

  <p>"Information?... What time do I get a train East tomorrow night on the New
  York Central?"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WEMBELTON offered many surprises. Phyllis's conception of a
  small town had been furnished by straw-munching comedians and bucolic novels
  besprinkled with tiresome dialect.</p>

  <p>The picture she had set up was not altogether incorrect. Her constituency
  spoke a language distinguished for its homely elisions and grotesque idioms.
  She had never been fussily meticulous in her speech, but in Wembelton what
  she had to say sounded&mdash;even to herself&mdash;amusingly precise.</p>

  <p>She was by no means a snob, but the democracy of Wembelton was so pure and
  undefiled that she could hardly believe her own eyes and ears when Fanny the
  cook leaned against the highly varnished newel-post and yelled up the
  staircase&mdash;"Chuck Sloat is here about that wood!"&mdash;to which Chuck,
  standing in the hall, bellowingly added, "Is it fer the fireplace, Frank?"
  And Frank, upstairs dressing for supper, shouted, "That's right,
  Chuck&mdash;three foot." In imagination Phyllis saw them all at ten years
  old, playing hide-and-seek&mdash;Frank Gibson, Fanny Withers, and Chuck
  Sloat. Their present relationship probably certified to their good sense, but
  it was a novelty.</p>

  <p>In tow of Geraldine, Phyllis had walked down to the Post Office on the
  night of her arrival, astonished to learn that it would be open for business
  until nine, and was very prettily introduced to Mr. Flook, who wore broad
  braces, a green eye-shade attached visor-fashion to the merest skeleton of a
  white canvas cap, and spectacles on the end of a long slim nose. He lowered
  his head and grinned at you over the top, for all the world as it was done in
  vaudeville.</p>

  <p>Mr. Flook's hands were not very clean, but were moist and warm, and the
  stamps stuck to his fingers a little. Their palatableness was still further
  reduced when he laid them sticky-side-down on the grimy window counter, but
  his friendliness was genuine. He welcomed the newcomer to Wembelton in
  phrases more felicitous than one had a right to expect. Phyllis thanked him
  graciously and bade him good night.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gibson had been thoughtfully prompt in handing her the amount of her
  travelling expenses and she was here primarily to return what she had
  borrowed from Sonia. So she stepped to the window labelled 'Money Orders'.
  There Mr. Flook met her cordially and accommodated her. She laughed a little
  at meeting Mr. Flook again after the so recent leave-taking, and Gerry, who
  had been ready to burst, but had doubted the propriety of letting herself go,
  released a shrill giggle that bore startling testimony to the cruel
  compression under which it had been detained.... Small-town stuff, reflected
  Phyllis, good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>Then they stopped at Himes's Pharmacy, Gerry's thought, and had a
  maple-nut sundae. "Hello, Buster," said Gerry to the tall boy who waited on
  them at the glass-topped table filled with cosmetics on display. "And don't
  be holdin' out on the nuts," she added, blowing up one cheek and closing the
  other eye, impishly. Suspecting, from the involuntary and almost
  imperceptible lift of Phyllis's shapely eyebrows that her pantomime was
  ill-timed, she thought to redeem it somewhat by calling attention to the
  difficulty of its execution. "That isn't so easy to do," she confided, "as
  you might think. Look!" She did it again. "Try it!" Phyllis smilingly replied
  that she would have to experiment in the mirror before attempting it in
  public. Gerry considered this an adroit parry and thought she would like her
  new teacher.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Goldie," she replied cordially, to a similar salute from an
  adjoining table. Phyllis glanced a moment later in that direction. Goldie was
  what Sonia would have referred to as a nine-minute egg. And unquestionably
  Gerry knew it.... Here they sat, these Wembeltonians, knowing no caste,
  huddled together, as utterly cut off from the outside world as they might
  have been on a coral reef in the South Seas.</p>

  <p>Next morning when breakfast was all but finished&mdash;they were at the
  bottom of the second cup of coffee served in Cauldron&mdash;Mrs. Gibson
  excused herself and, going to the telephone within easy earshot, said: "That
  you, Sadie? Oh, I'm well, thanks. Let me have Charley Ritter's meat shop...
  That you, Charley? I want a rib roast for tonight. Bones out&mdash;and send
  'em along. Yes&mdash;about ten pounds net."</p>

  <p>"Welmp"&mdash;said Mr. Gibson, folding his napkin and squinting one eye
  against the smoke of his big cigar&mdash;"I got things to do to-day."</p>

  <p>Phyllis rather pitied the friendly fellow, marooned here for life, moving
  routinishly from home to office and back again&mdash;same programme, day
  after day. Every morning, doubtless, at eight-twenty, Frank Gibson pushed
  back his chair, folded his napkin, and drawled, "Welmp&mdash;I got things to
  do to-day."... He was at the telephone now.</p>

  <p>"Sadie&mdash;get me Harvey Aikens, Plymouth Hotel, Seattle."</p>

  <p>After a minute's wait, during which conversation languished at the table,
  he said: "That you, Harv? Yeah&mdash;Frank Gibson. Goin' to be there all day?
  Good. Think I'll run over and join you at lunch. I've got some suggestions
  for that new smelter. Are you fixed so you could go to Pittsburgh again with
  me to-morrow, in case you like my ideas? ... O.K., Harv."</p>

  <p>Returning to the dining-room, he said, "Got to go to Seattle, Maudie.
  Anything you want?... Welmp&mdash;see you later, Miss Dexter. Don't let them
  give you any wooden money. 'Bye, Gerry. 'Bye, Maudie. Likely Harv Aikens will
  be here for supper."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know we were that close to Seattle," said Phyllis, bewilderedly,
  when the front door had closed.</p>

  <p>"'Tisn't very far." Mrs. Gibson's grimace scorned the distance. "Four
  hundred miles&mdash;or such a matter."</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Gibson is going to be there for lunch&mdash;and back here again
  this evening?"</p>

  <p>"Sure! He goes by plane." She chuckled. "You'd never catch Frank Gibson
  wasting his time on a railway train. I don't believe any of our family has
  been on one for all of five years. Any place we can't drive, we fly."</p>

  <p>Small-town stuff like that, eh?... Phyllis, who had never been in an
  aeroplane, wondered if her picture of a small town was not in need of a
  little reorganization.</p>

  <p>Noting with dismay the width of the chasm between the curriculum of
  Wembelton High School and the requirements for college entrance, she ventured
  to hint that it would be a great help if the board could find a Latin teacher
  to assist, and when they agreed promptly she said they really needed a
  Mathematics teacher too. "Welmp," observed Mr. Gibson, "anything you say,
  Miss Dexter. We want it to be a success. And, as fer the expense, we might as
  well throw the tail in with the hide." She heard herself saying, in reply to
  some future remark in urbane quarters concerning 'small-town
  stuff'&mdash;"Just a minute! I'll tell you something about a small town."</p>

  <p>When she had been there a week, Mrs. Gibson asked Phyllis if she'd mind
  remaining with them as their guest. It would be so good for Gerry. Phyllis
  was happy to consent, provided she might be permitted to pay for the
  accommodation.</p>

  <p>Frank, sauntering into the room, heard this and remarked, just a bit
  gruffly, "Nope!&mdash;we're not stuck up, Maudie and me, but this ain't no
  boardin'-house"&mdash;after which blunt confirmation of his wife's hospitable
  offer, he grinned and hoped she would get used to their ways.</p>

  <p>"I guess Gerry will have to be rubbed down a little before she'll take a
  polish," he observed shrewdly, "but you'll know how to do it so it won't
  hurt. The buffer's more tedious than emery, but Gerry'll like it better."</p>

  <p>"You can do anything you want with her, she's that fond of you," said Mrs.
  Gibson. "You wouldn't believe what a big change you've made in her already,
  Miss&mdash;Dexter."</p>

  <p>"Will you call me Phyllis, if I stay?"</p>

  <p>They beamed&mdash;and Frank, puffing billowing clouds from his big cigar,
  ventured that they would all have a fine time together. Gerry, appearing in
  the doorway at this point, was informed by her mother of what had happened. A
  week earlier, she would have received such gratifying news with a boisterous
  "Say!&mdash;that's swell!"</p>

  <p>She crossed the room with so faithful an imitation of Phyllis's graceful
  walk&mdash;confident footsteps put down in a straight line&mdash;that her
  father carefully rubbed a smile from the outer corner of one eye, to the
  neglect of the other, and her mother tucked in her chin contentedly as if she
  were saying, "Just look at that&mdash;won't you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm awfully happy!" said Gerry, raising her pretty eyebrows slightly and
  enunciating the <i>p</i>'s in 'happy' as if she had something in her mouth
  that was a little too delicious to swallow just yet. Phyllis looked up at her
  affectionately and flushed slightly. Then she sobered for a brief instant. It
  was almost the way her own mother's lips had always looked when she said
  "happy".</p>

  <p>It was the last Sunday of October, and the air was already crisp with the
  feel of winter stealthily slipping down the heavily wooded slopes of Mount
  Boone into the snug pocket that was Wembelton.</p>

  <p>A dinner of festival proportions was always served at one-thirty on
  Sundays, after which the Gibsons demobilized for naps. About five the family
  began to revive and reappear. Almost any time after that callers were likely
  to drift in, for the mayor's big house was a rendezvous for the dozen
  families who gave Wembelton a reason for carrying on.</p>

  <p>Gerry had been invited to the home of a friend for the day and the
  spacious house had been unusually quiet. When dinner was over and bedroom
  doors had softly closed, Phyllis&mdash;restless and lonesome&mdash;decided to
  take a walk. Sylvia noted with mounting interest the change of costume and
  could hardly contain herself when the heavy-soled tramping shoes came out of
  the closet.</p>

  <p>One didn't have to walk very far in Wembelton to reach the suburbs and the
  open country. The easiest way led west and was Phyllis's favourite course,
  over the gently rising wagon-road which, if pursued far enough, was said to
  terminate some four miles distant in an obsolete logging-camp. And from
  there, at least two well-worn narrow footpaths diverged to straggle
  circuitously up the increasingly rugged flanks of Boone, the highest mountain
  in that region.</p>

  <p>It would be pleasant to feel that one might safely proceed alone here as
  far as one cared to go, but it seemed rather imprudent. Phyllis had taken
  this walk several times, continuing only so long as the roofs of Wembelton
  were well in sight and the wood was comparatively open. This time she was
  venturing a little farther, made bold by the passing of two lads who overtook
  her and glanced back over their shoulders to grin admiringly at Sylvia. The
  pleasant episode allayed her anxiety and she pressed on, feeling it a
  friendly road.</p>

  <p>After another half-mile the trees began to close in on her and with
  slowing steps she decided reluctantly to return. It was deucedly inconvenient
  to be a girl. Not more than two hundred yards farther on, a huge plateau of
  rock to the left of the road opened a generous space where, she thought, one
  might have a good view of the valley in which little Wembelton drowsed.
  Venturing this added distance, Phyllis walked over the great flat ledge of
  grey granite until a charming vista broke through the tops of the pines.
  Retreating to a slightly higher vantage, she sat, arms clasping her knees,
  feeling very far away from everybody and everything that constituted her
  natural environment.</p>

  <p>Sylvia crouched beside her, so close she felt the dog's warmth through her
  short tweed skirt. It was a great pity, thought Phyllis for the hundredth
  time, that Sylvia couldn't talk. Doubtless she would have many interesting
  things to say. There were important questions Phyllis wanted to ask her. And
  it was quite possible that Sylvia, too, might like to propound a few queries
  of her own&mdash;as, for instance&mdash;"Where is my master, and why does he
  neglect me so?"</p>

  <p>The dog's predicament, Phyllis suspected, was just one little phase of a
  mystery that clamoured for a great deal of explaining. On several occasions
  it had seemed that a bit of light was about to be shed on this secret, but
  the tentative promise had always failed.</p>

  <p>The Gibsons had been much amused over Sylvia's marked attentions to their
  guest; but, as Mrs. Gibson casually observed, there was no accounting for
  what a dog might do. The Woodruffs' Scotty had become so fond of their baby
  that he wouldn't even let Alice herself touch the child without raising a
  great hullabaloo.</p>

  <p>Gerry, when tactfully asked about Sylvia, had replied disinterestedly that
  she belonged to a fellow named Paige who lived up in the woods somewhere with
  an older man, a Mr. Stafford, who occasionally came to talk with her father
  and sometimes stayed for dinner in his big boots and rough clothes&mdash;"a
  very fidgety man, who can't sit still."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't know what they do up there," Gerry had remarked
  indifferently. "Hunt&mdash;maybe. I don't believe they're much good, either
  of them, though Mr. Paige is very handsome. They look like a couple of bums
  who have seen better times. They may be hiding from somebody. Father won't
  talk about them and Mother always says it's none of our business. I don't
  know what they see in this shabby old Stafford, but when he comes here they
  treat him as if he was somebody, and Mother despises tramps and loafers. Last
  year she spent a long time knitting a heavy sweater. I thought it was for
  Father, but when it was done she gave it to Mr. Stafford.... Don't ask
  <i>me</i>!"</p>

  <p>Once Phyllis had had a glimpse of Mr. Stafford who was just leaving the
  house as she was arriving. Mr. Gibson had introduced them, telling him that
  Miss Dexter was their new teacher, but failing to say who or what was
  Stafford. He was, indeed, a pretty tough-looking specimen of something that
  had reverted to type. The fact that Newell Paige had not appeared at the
  Gibson home since her arrival made her believe that Mr. Stafford had reported
  her presence in Wembelton. If so, his continued absence could be easily
  explained. He didn't want to meet her, naturally.</p>

  <p>For a while Phyllis had alternately dreaded and longed to see him, but as
  the weeks passed, and there was no sign of any intention on his part to
  revisit the Gibsons&mdash;her anxiety on the matter subsided. She was not to
  see him. He would attend to that.</p>

  <p>This afternoon she gave herself to some very realistic day-dreaming. With
  absolute fidelity to the smallest details, she painstakingly reviewed every
  step, every minute, every word, gesture, smile, of that eventful day when she
  had met him at the Cathedral; his strange behaviour when he first looked into
  her eyes with something like a startled recognition, her own bewildered
  emotions when she saw that he thought he knew her and the curious warmth of
  her immediate response to his tender interest.... And the amusing encounter
  in the park, Sylvia's effort to introduce them, the indecision when a taxi
  drew up, the ride to the St. Lawrence, the earnest, serious way he searched
  your face and watched your lips when you talked, and you couldn't move a
  finger without him inspecting your hands almost as if he'd never seen a
  girl's hands before. It made you so self-conscious that you knew your cheeks
  were glowing and you talked too fast and too much in an effort to cover your
  confusion. And then you grew so inquisitive to know what was happening to you
  that you looked him squarely in the eyes, and saw something that made your
  heart pound until you were afraid he could hear it.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Sylvia raised up, cocked her head on one side attentively and
  lifted one front paw a little, as if she were signalling for complete
  silence, though goodness knows the silence was absolute.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Sylvia?" whispered Phyllis apprehensively, her heart beating
  now in a different rhythm.</p>

  <p>With a bound and a bark, she was off, over the rocks, through the trees,
  and had disappeared. Phyllis quickly scrambled to her feet and followed
  along, trembling a little. At the end of the great ledge near the trees, she
  paused, preferring to remain in the open until she knew for certain what was
  up. There she stood, with a dry throat, listening to Sylvia who was barking
  her head off for joy.</p>

  <p>Presently she saw them coming, Sylvia leaping ahead and running back to
  him in hysterical swoops. He was roughly clad in heavy corduroy trousers
  thrust into high boots, a leather jacket, and an old, battered, grey felt hat
  drawn well down over his eyes. His lean face was deeply tanned.</p>

  <p>He took off his hat as he neared and ventured a reassuring smile, the sort
  of smile he would probably wear to hearten any frightened girl he might have
  met in an unfrequented spot. But he had the same hurt look in his eyes that
  had haunted her ever since they parted.</p>

  <p>A wave of contrition swept over Phyllis. Momentarily experiencing a
  recapture of the mood in which she had sat waiting for him that day in the
  Art Institute, she advanced a few steps to meet him. His eyes quickly
  responded to the overture of conciliation, and when she extended her hand he
  grasped it tightly. Phyllis lowered her eyes under his penetrating quest.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she murmured, at length, quite at a loss to know what to say,
  but anxious to voice her long delayed apology.</p>

  <p>"Please!" entreated Paige huskily. "Anything but <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>Fortunately for both of them at this trying moment, Sylvia, who had been
  politely demanding attention without success, lost her patience and began
  bounding up and down before them, pawing at Paige's leather-clad arm. They
  were thankful for the distraction.</p>

  <p>"She's happy to see you again," said Phyllis, her voice steadier.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia?... Yes, it's a long time. No way to treat a friend, but&mdash;"
  His explanation spun out to an inane "couldn't very well be helped." He
  stooped and quieted the dog with his hand; then, straightening, he faced
  Phyllis with a troubled look. "I don't like your being up here," he said
  soberly.</p>

  <p>"I'll go, then," she declared quickly.</p>

  <p>"You know what I mean." He defended his remark without a smile, which made
  her feel about nine years old. "All sorts of people prowling in these woods.
  Hasn't anyone told you that?"</p>

  <p>"Sylvia wouldn't let me be hurt," she replied carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;" His muttered ejaculation was sceptical.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia doesn't carry a gun. It wouldn't take much of a marksman to
  dispose of her. You positively must never do this again, my friend!"</p>

  <p>It was queer about words. You thought you knew exactly what some very
  common word meant, and then&mdash;somebody would say it with a peculiar
  intonation that gave it a brand-new value. She had been hearing the word
  'friend' all her life. It wasn't much of a word, really; didn't mean
  anything. "My friend&mdash;how far is it to Gary?"... "May I trouble you for
  a light&mdash;my friend?"... It was quite another word now, perhaps because
  it had been spoken so tenderly, so protectingly. What a lovely
  word&mdash;<i>friend.</i></p>

  <p>"Very well, Dr. Paige," she agreed respectfully, "I shall not do it again.
  And I should be going now&mdash;I was just about to," she decided to add, for
  politeness's sake.</p>

  <p>"There's no danger now. I'll walk down with you, if I may. But can't we
  stay and talk for a little while&mdash;now we're here? It's early yet." He
  did not smile, but his eyes quietly entreated.</p>

  <p>Phyllis nodded, after a brief hesitation, and they strolled back to the
  slight elevation where she had sat musing for so long.</p>

  <p>"Lovely!" commented Phyllis, when they were seated facing the valley.</p>

  <p>Sylvia snuggled herself in between them and sank down with a contented
  sigh. Paige approved the scenery with "Mmm."</p>

  <p>"Likes you&mdash;doesn't she?" He ran his long fingers through Sylvia's
  red coat.</p>

  <p>Phyllis, dreamily occupied with the view, nodded absently.</p>

  <p>"It's rather strange," he commented, half to himself.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" The rising inflection hinted at a lack of interest, but the fleeting
  suggestion of a smile made her laconic reply awkward to deal with.</p>

  <p>"You know what I mean," muttered Paige, with a little trace of impatience.
  "Sylvia has never cared for women. Look here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Phyllis accommodated him literally with wide blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind my asking you a question?" he ventured seriously, "just to
  satisfy my curiosity? Did Sylvia know you&mdash;when you came to the
  Gibsons'?"</p>

  <p>She pursed her lips in a half-reluctant smile and slowly redirected her
  eyes toward the valley; then laughed a little, in spite of her resolve not
  to, as the recollection returned with a bound. She reached out and patted
  Sylvia's head, companionably.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad," said Paige. "It must have been pleasant to be welcomed by an
  acquaintance when you arrived."</p>

  <p>"It was," she admitted. "Sylvia has been very attentive."</p>

  <p>"She sticks close&mdash;a little too close, sometimes. She has often
  wakened me up in the night," drawled Paige reminiscently, "scratching her
  back against the bed-slats."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind," said Phyllis.</p>

  <p>He chuckled good-humouredly, but she remained soberly unaware that
  anything funny had been said.</p>

  <p>"She's a great conversationalist." Paige's somewhat declamatory tone
  sounded as if he was losing faith in his own ability to promote sprightly
  talk. "It's because she's such a good listener," he explained. "But I don't
  suppose you ever chatted to her seriously."</p>

  <p>"Don't you?" Phyllis privately believed this remark to have broken an
  all-time record for pitching a conversation overboard.</p>

  <p>Paige sank back on one elbow, and ran his hand through his own hair,
  meditatively, Sylvia turning her head to regard him with interest.</p>

  <p>"You're a bright dog," he confided softly, pulling her ears. "Some day
  you'll tire of listening&mdash;and tell everything you've ever heard anyone
  say, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"She'd better not," threatened Phyllis, in an aside.</p>

  <p>Paige sat up again attentively, and she had a sudden suspicion that he was
  about to reopen the subject she had been trying so valiantly to avoid. It was
  quite evident that their futile sparring with each other, talking in cryptics
  and riddles, had come to an end. He was leaning toward her now, and she knew
  he was going to discuss it.</p>

  <p>"Phyllis&mdash;" His voice was very tender.</p>

  <p>She slowly shook her head, and turned toward him with eyes half-closed and
  lips parted to ask him not to go on. But the right words would not come. He
  was waiting for her reply. After a little silence, she closed her lips
  tightly, and shook her head again. He sighed.</p>

  <p>"I can't!" she said decisively. "Come!" With a quick assumption of
  lightness, she sprang to her feet. "It's high time I went back. The Gibsons
  will be worried about me. Would you like to walk a little way&mdash;really?
  Sure it's no trouble? Were you going up or down?"</p>

  <p>He was going up, he admitted&mdash;but no matter about that. Up
  where?&mdash;she wanted to know, as they strolled back to the path.
  Oh&mdash;to a shack that he and another fellow had, farther up the
  mountain&mdash;quite on top of it, in fact.... Was it fun?... Not
  particularly.... Was he hunting? Yes, that's right&mdash;he was hunting....
  Getting anything?... Well, not much yet; nothing to brag about.</p>

  <p>The conversation was choppy, inconsequential, unsatisfactory. He gave so
  poor an account of himself that Phyllis had some difficulty keeping her
  impatience and disappointment out of her queries. After all&mdash;it was none
  of her business, she reflected, and if he was doing so little that he was
  ashamed to talk about it, of course it was his own affair.</p>

  <p>"I should think," she did venture to say, rather crisply, "that one would
  be frightfully bored&mdash;doing&mdash;what you seem to be doing. Have you
  anything up there to read&mdash;just to while away the time?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," he answered, as if it didn't matter much.</p>

  <p>"And you like it?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I've got to live somewhere, haven't I?"</p>

  <p>The frowsy outskirts of Wembelton lay in plain sight only five minutes
  away.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't take you any farther, Dr. Paige," said Phyllis, halting. "I am
  glad to have seen you because I have felt badly over the rude way I treated
  you when you tried to be nice to me."</p>

  <p>"Will I see you again&mdash;while you're here?" he asked, not very
  hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. Of course you know that I'm awfully busy with my school, and you
  have your&mdash;your work up on the mountain."</p>

  <p>He searched her with a peculiar stare. "How do you mean&mdash;my
  <i>work</i>?" he demanded, almost gruffly.</p>

  <p>Then she saw that she had offended him. Doubtless he deserved a little
  prod, if he was loafing his life away. He was humiliated over it, too, it was
  easy to see, and painfully sensitive on the subject, as he had a right to be.
  But she wasn't going to hurt him still further and carry the image of his
  injury back with her.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said softly.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to leave me with that&mdash;again?" he protested.</p>

  <p>She turned and took a step.</p>

  <p>"It's true." Phyllis's tone was gentle but uttered with sincere
  conviction. "It's true," she declared pensively. "I'm much sorrier than I
  was&mdash;the other time."</p>

  <p>"For <i>me</i>&mdash;you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!... Why do you throw yourself away?"</p>

  <p>Apparently there was nothing further to be said. Phyllis's "Good-bye"
  tried to sound good-natured, as if nothing unpleasant had occurred. He
  responded, in a tone of discontent, and watched her go. Neither of them had
  reckoned on Sylvia's dilemma, which now loomed up with dramatic importance.
  For a moment she stood at Paige's side, giving short barks directed toward
  the receding Phyllis. Then she bounded down the path and blocked the way,
  barking another noisy fusillade.</p>

  <p>Phyllis turned and waited Paige's approach. They were both reluctantly
  amused. The disconcerting incident seemed likely to alter the nature of their
  leave-taking. They had parted with such an air of hopeless finality, and here
  they were with a common problem on their hands. He drew a not very happy
  grin.</p>

  <p>"Go on&mdash;Sylvia!" he commanded, trying to be gruff.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you take her with you?" queried Phyllis. "I should think a
  hunter might need a dog."</p>

  <p>"You don't understand, Phyllis," he replied glumly. "Call her, please...
  Sylvia&mdash;Go!" He turned his back on them and with long, swift strides
  started up the path.</p>

  <p>"Come, Sylvia," she said, suddenly depressed. "He doesn't need you." The
  dog dejectedly moped alongside, occasionally looking back and whining, but
  resuming the journey down the hill. Phyllis patted her head. "Maybe he'll
  come for you, some day." Her eyes were hot with tears of disappointment....
  What a mess they had made of everything!</p>

  <p>The epochal letter, closely written on both sides, had been folded so that
  its last sentence was the first to catch Phyllis's attention. "I am leaving
  at ten-forty to-night," she read, mystified, "to have an interview with Dr.
  Endicott. Here's hoping something comes of it. Love, Sonia."</p>

  <p>The Gibsons were giving a Halloween party that night, and everybody
  connected with the new school would be there&mdash;parents, teachers, and of
  course the girls themselves. And because it was to be a costume affair,
  Phyllis had yielded to the clamour for an afternoon off. Sonia's letter lay
  on the hall table when she came home for lunch. Hurrying to her room, she
  tore open the unusually bulky script&mdash;Sonia's letters had never been
  more than two pages long&mdash;and began to read with widening eyes and
  racing heart.</p>

  <p>"We know now to a certainty that the mistake made in your mother's
  operation was Dr. Endicott's fault! The chief nurse, who saw it all, told
  young Clay Brock. Here is the full story as he wrote it to Elise."</p>

  <p>Phyllis's breath came faster as she proceeded. Her knees were trembling
  and she dropped into a chair. Her eyes were shining and her happiness was
  almost suffocating. She pushed her little hat far back off her forehead,
  absurdly. As she read, there was an occasional long "Oh!" articulated in a
  gasp of sheer delight. Newell Paige hadn't done it! Newell Paige had taken
  the blame to protect his senior whom he loved! Sonia was going to see whether
  Dr. Endicott would respond to the situation. She hadn't decided exactly what
  course to pursue&mdash;but she was going to do <i>something</i>!</p>

  <p>When she had finished reading the letter, Phyllis took off her hat,
  dragged her chair closer to the window, and read the letter again....
  Wonderful!... Marvellous!...</p>

  <p>There was a tap on the door and Mrs. Gibson entered.</p>

  <p>"Ah-<i>ha</i>!" she teased. "Caught you reading a love-letter, didn't
  I?"</p>

  <p>Phyllis rose quickly and, slipping an arm through Maudie Gibson's, said,
  in a tone that vibrated with happy excitement: "It's from Sonia.... A friend
  of ours has been&mdash;has come into good fortune!... It's too good to
  believe!... I'll tell you about it&mdash;when there's time. Long story."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that fine?" Mrs. Gibson's felicitation carried just a trace of
  friendly raillery. "<i>Friend</i> of yours!&mdash;you ought to see your face!
  Lovely, dear! And the heavens were opened&mdash;and all the little angels
  were skipping the rope, and singing till their eyes popped out!... Don't you
  try to hold out on your Aunt Maudie!"</p>

  <p>Phyllis hugged her warmly and murmured that she was a darling.</p>

  <p>"I expect there's something I ought to be doing, down there, isn't there?"
  she asked, attempting to descend to practical considerations.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it's all done. I came to call you down to lunch. Rather have it
  up here? Of course you would, seeing the state you're in. I'll tell Ida...
  Does that dog bother you too much?" Sylvia had her forepaws on the west
  window-sill, looking out. In that posture, she seemed to occupy a great deal
  of space.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," declared Phyllis. "I like her."</p>

  <p>"Well, just at the moment," Mrs. Gibson observed banteringly, "you'd
  probably say you liked a horse in your room if there happened to be one....
  But this dog would worry me into the jitters if I had her on my hands day and
  night, the way you do. I wish the man who owns her would come and get her. So
  does Frank. It's too much of a responsibility. Now that the cold weather has
  come, there's no reason why Mr. Paige shouldn't take her."</p>

  <p>"Cold weather?" Phyllis didn't understand.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gibson moved towards the door, replying indifferently: "He was afraid
  she would be stung with&mdash;with gnats, or something. They should all be in
  their holes by now&mdash;or wherever they go."</p>

  <p>The dainty luncheon came up in a few minutes. Phyllis had no notion what
  she was eating. Her face was radiant and sometimes she drew a long, ecstatic
  sigh. Sylvia's head was in her lap, gratefully and noisily wolfing the
  sandwiches that were passed down to her. They were all gone now, and so was
  the cake.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia&mdash;I know something!" Phyllis's voice was serious. "He left you
  here so the gnats wouldn't bite you. Now the gnats are all dead, but he won't
  take you because you like me and I like you, and he's sitting up there,
  lonely and dismal, waiting for you. Wouldn't you like to see him? Wouldn't he
  be surprised?"</p>

  <p>She rose and walked to the window, Sylvia following. The Gibsons thought
  Sylvia's owner should take her; couldn't understand why he didn't; wished he
  would. Newell&mdash;she was finding it a beautiful name, and murmured it
  caressingly&mdash;needed Sylvia.... The light of a sudden, happy decision
  shone in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'm going out for a little tramp," she explained, meeting Mrs. Gibson,
  ten minutes later, in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Don't blame you," grinned her hostess. "Go out and walk it off."</p>

  <p>They took the familiar path which Sunday's events had mapped indelibly,
  Phyllis mounting the increasingly steeper slope with determined steps and a
  joyful heart. Sylvia grew excited and kept speeding on ahead and stopping to
  wait with restless impatience. When they came to the spot where the open
  space in the timber to the left of the road marked the broad ledge of
  granite, Phyllis paused.</p>

  <p>"Sylvia!" she shouted, pointing a straight arm up the path,
  "<i>Go</i>&mdash;<i>find him!"</i></p>

  <p>For a moment Sylvia stood, wagging her tail energetically, her red tongue
  dripping. Phyllis thought of picking up a stick and brandishing it
  threateningly, but wasn't capable of putting the act into execution. She
  walked toward the dog, trying to explain and realizing how silly it was to
  suppose she would be understood. Dropping to her knees in the rustling
  leaves, she laid her cheek against Sylvia's long silky ear, and whispered:
  "You've simply got to go, you know! I don't want to give you up, but he needs
  you. Hurry up there and find him. And bark 'I love you!'... and do it a few
  times for me, too!"</p>

  <p>Phyllis's eyes were misty when she scrambled to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Go&mdash;Sylvia!" she commanded sternly.</p>

  <p>Then she turned and walked swiftly, resolutely, down the path. Hearing no
  sound behind her, she slowed, after a while, and glanced back over her
  shoulder. Sylvia had disappeared.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DR. BRUCE ENDICOTT could not remember the number of times he
  had commanded men of affairs in their late fifties and early sixties to take
  it easy. Out of his own abundant vitality he had cheerfully boomed the advice
  at them, and scurried away to do eighteen holes before sundown. Good joke on
  them, his manner seemed to say.</p>

  <p>"Just two courses open to you now," he would breezily declare, with a
  twinkle. "You must either slow up or slow down. Take your pick." When, after
  a week or two of slowing, they fretted under the regulations and invented
  ingenious devices to dodge the orders he had issued, he always felt they were
  acting the baby and sometimes went to the length of telling them so.</p>

  <p>Now that he was in this predicament himself, Endicott had discovered that
  it was no fun to be a semi-invalid. A man would be ever so much better off,
  he growled, if he were put to bed and waited on, hand and foot, sucking his
  insipid slops through a glass tube. To be up on one's feet, moving about
  cautiously at reduced speed, watching other people bungle one's work,
  enjoined to make no unnecessary trips upstairs, to abjure red meat, to retire
  at ten&mdash;Hell!&mdash;a man might as well be dead and done with it!</p>

  <p>In exasperation he had stood out for a few minor self-indulgences. They
  had grudgingly winked at his firm determination to smoke one cigar half an
  hour after dinner. It was about the only luxury he had left now, and there
  was something both amusing and pathetic in the childish eagerness with which
  he sat in the evenings, in his sumptuous library, watching a taunting clock
  whose hands seemed painted on the dial.</p>

  <p>Endicott sat here alone. His wife had died, his children had married and
  were out on their own. The very considerable fortune-on-paper that had
  demanded so much looking after and fretting over had gone the way of all
  perishing things. Enough had been salvaged, fortunately, to leave the big
  house in his possession and permit its maintenance on much the same scale as
  before the crash. He could be glad of that, he reflected. Penury would have
  been unbearable.</p>

  <p>It was eight-ten now. At a quarter past, he would be free to enjoy the
  sedative that could be counted on to untwist his fiddle-string nerves. He
  drew the cigar-box toward him, took out an expensive Corona, sniffed it
  appreciatively, and opened his pocket-knife.</p>

  <p>Edwards the butler sedately entered the room.</p>

  <p>"A young lady, sir; says she has an appointment."</p>

  <p>He had forgotten. But it was a fact. He had been foolish enough to consent
  to see some newspaper syndicate writer. The office clerk at the hospital had
  relayed the request to him when he was busy. He had protested that the whole
  day was occupied. Then she had begged through the Reid girl for an early
  evening appointment and he had snapped impatiently, "Very
  well&mdash;eight-fifteen&mdash;my house&mdash;for a few minutes only."... So
  here the woman was, and he would have to see her.</p>

  <p>"She's early," he complained gruffly. "Let her wait a while." And as
  Edwards backed himself out, he added, "What kind of a person is she?"</p>

  <p>"Uncommonly handsome, sir, if I may say so."</p>

  <p>"There's no reason why you shouldn't say so if that's your honest
  conviction." Dr. Endicott expertly cut the end off the Corona. It might not
  be so troublesome, after all, to have a little chat with a bright young woman
  on an otherwise empty evening. "What's so handsome about her, Edwards?"</p>

  <p>"Very stylish, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;go and get her." He struck a match and sat holding it
  promisingly. "I've never seen a stylish newspaper woman." He applied the
  light and puffed with benign contentment. "But&mdash;about half-past eight,
  Edwards, you can come back and effect a rescue."</p>

  <p>"You will be wanted immediately at the hospital, sir?" Edwards ventured a
  conspiratory grin.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that will do very nicely." He rose, after the door had closed
  softly, and pushed the two luxurious red leather chairs facing the grate to a
  more companionable angle. He hoped this would turn out to be an interesting
  event. The altered circumstances of his life had made unexpected changes in
  his state of mind. A year ago, he said to himself, an unknown caller dropping
  in from nowhere would have had to tell her story in full to someone else
  before she reached him personally. Now&mdash;so lonesome and bored that
  almost any sort of distraction was welcome&mdash;he was preparing to receive
  a young woman who would probably try to sell him a twenty-six-volume set of
  war memoirs that some alleged 'newspaper syndicate' was trying to float by
  private subscription. He ardently hoped not. A great many interesting
  visitors had sat in one of those two comfortable red chairs&mdash;eminent
  doctors, and other celebrities; colleagues, cronies. A little wisp of pain
  twitched his cheeks at the recollection of the most delightful of them
  all&mdash;the brilliant young fellow who had followed his every gesture with
  devoted eyes. He backed up to the fireplace and puffed meditatively.</p>

  <p>"Miss Duquesne, sir," said Edwards, visibly impressed.</p>

  <p>She entered without hesitation and walked towards him with the confident
  air of sound social experience, unflustered, self-contained. It was quite
  evident that she had nothing to sell. Her urbane smile was gracious enough,
  but it threatened no wheedling or obsequious boot-licking. The smile augured
  well, thought Dr. Endicott, as he stepped forward. The hand she gave him was
  soft, slim, and well-kept, with the firm grip of a business man's. It pleased
  him to see that she carried her gloves. She had taken them off because she
  intended to stay until her errand was finished. It was a sign that she was
  not accustomed to think mousily of her own affairs, whatever they were.</p>

  <p>"So you're a newspaper woman," he said amiably, when she was seated. "I'm
  bound to say, if it isn't too personal, that you don't look like one....
  Cigarette?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks." Her voice was pleasantly soft, and when she lifted her face
  toward the match he offered, its patrician lines interested him. She was a
  little older than he had thought at first, now that he was close enough to
  see the fine tracery in her temples. "What <i>do</i> I look like?" she
  countered.</p>

  <p>"The stage, I should say, on a chance guess." Endicott relaxed comfortably
  in his chair and surveyed her with undisguised pleasure. "Wouldn't you like
  to lay aside your coat? It's warm in here."</p>

  <p>She complied, her host rising to assist, and stood before him momentarily
  in an expertly tailored black velvet that sculptured her beautifully.</p>

  <p>"No," she replied, "I am not on the stage. It's queer, though, your
  thinking so. For you are, I'm sure, accustomed to sizing up strangers and
  making deductions. It hasn't been so very long since another man of wide
  experience in reading people asked me if I were not in the theatrical
  business. Perhaps you would like to know. It was Dean Harcourt, of Trinity
  Cathedral. Doubtless you have met him. I notice that important men seem to
  encounter one another in various ways."</p>

  <p>Dr. Endicott's amiable lips protruded slightly. Bright young woman, he
  observed, but moving rather rapidly. However, Dean Harcourt was a safe enough
  topic of conversation. Besides&mdash;he sincerely admired the man and would
  be glad to talk about him.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I'm proud to say that I know the Dean. Very remarkable person.
  You belong to his flock, perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"Unofficially. One of the black sheep. He has been like a father to me. My
  own died when I was little. Sometimes I've thought that it would work out
  more happily if an orphan could adopt a father, rather than the other way
  about. I know of a young man, for instance, whose parents are dead, and a
  very brilliant older man showed him a lot of attention. And he literally
  worshipped this big man with a devotion you don't often see even in a
  flesh-and-blood son." Sonia's eyes asked for a confirmation of this truism,
  but Dr. Endicott was moodily studying the flame-patterns in the grate, and
  offered no comment. "They were surgeons," she added, as if she thought a
  surgeon might find increased interest in the incident.</p>

  <p>"Umm... Yes.... Well... Reverting to Dean Harcourt&mdash;" Dr. Endicott
  recrossed his legs and carefully deposited a loose fleck of cigar-ash in the
  tray at his elbow. "I have the profoundest admiration for the man. I suppose
  no one&mdash;except possibly an experienced diagnostician&mdash;can even
  surmise the physical difficulties he has met."</p>

  <p>"But they have made him so great!" Sonia's tone was devout.</p>

  <p>"You infer that he might not have been so great if he had not been so
  unfortunate physically?"</p>

  <p>"I fear it would be merely impertinent for me to try to guess what kind of
  man he might have been but for his illness. Isn't it true, though, Dr.
  Endicott, that a serious disability sometimes sharpens the wits and softens
  the heart?"</p>

  <p>"Well," grumped Endicott, with reservations, "that all depends, I should
  say, on how much wit and heart one had to start with. And I've known some
  fairly capable men who went decidedly acid and mean when laid up." He drew a
  significantly sour grin which his guest might interpret any way she liked.
  Sonia noted it and felt that he knew she would.</p>

  <p>"You can't possibly be referring to yourself, Dr. Endicott," she objected
  gently. "They told me you hadn't been very well. I'm sorry. But I can testify
  it hasn't made you unkind. Look how you're treating me!"</p>

  <p>Endicott stroked his jaw thoughtfully. Perhaps it was time to discover
  which way they were headed here. Delightful young woman, and all that, but it
  would be better for her to offer her motion, now, and clear the air of this
  uncertainty.</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I've been doing anything for you, Miss Duquesne, except
  detaining you from a statement of your errand." This sounded more brusque
  than he had intended, so he added, smilingly, "You're to take your time over
  it, of course. There's no hurry."</p>

  <p>Edwards appeared at this juncture to say that Dr. Endicott was wanted
  immediately at Parkway Hospital.</p>

  <p>The doctor twisted his head around and growled that they'd have to get
  along the best they could. He wasn't going out any more to-night. Edwards
  bowed and left with the slightest perceptible bulge in his impassive cheek.
  Sonia regarded her host with wide eyes. She had just ventured a discreet
  tribute to his kindness and he had thrown it away with a refusal to answer an
  emergency call to the hospital. He observed her unspoken query and decided to
  restore himself to her good opinion.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," he confided, "Edwards is under instruction to come
  in and say that I'm wanted when he thinks I may be in need
  of&mdash;of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you aren't&mdash;now?" asked Sonia solicitously. "Sure?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" he said solemnly, burning the last bridge with an amazing
  recklessness. "You stay as long as you like."</p>

  <p>Sonia drew a long, happy sigh and smiled delightedly.</p>

  <p>"I knew it!" she murmured. "And I'm very glad. It has helped wonderfully.
  I did so hope you would be kind to me, Dr. Endicott. And now that you've
  confessed you'd made plans to pitch me out&mdash;and aren't going
  to&mdash;it's up to me to tell you that I got access to you with a wee little
  fib&mdash;not a big, solid one like the excuse you had fixed up for me!...
  I'm not a newspaper person at all."</p>

  <p>"I would have sworn you weren't," he chuckled. "Excuse me a second. I'm
  going to have another cigar.... Cigarette?"... There you are. Now! Proceed!
  And take your time."</p>

  <p>"I'll begin at the beginning, then. For some months I have been sharing my
  apartment with a young woman who was brought up very tenderly and given every
  privilege that money could buy. The family fortune was knocked to pieces a
  year ago, and the family, too, leaving this girl quite adrift. She secured a
  small position doing something she doesn't care for, and has been living with
  me. At present, she is in a distressing predicament. I would like to state
  her case."</p>

  <p>Dr. Endicott squirmed a little in his chair and chewed hard on his
  cigar.</p>

  <p>"Well, now, I sincerely hope," he grumbled, "that this isn't going to be
  what I'm pretty damned sure it's going to be." He shook his head
  vigorously.</p>

  <p>"No," said Sonia. "It isn't that&mdash;if what I imagine you mean is what
  you mean, and I'm pretty damned sure it is."</p>

  <p>At that, Endicott laughed. He couldn't remember when he had laughed so
  uproariously. This young woman was certainly refreshing. She had a very
  responsive wit. Besides&mdash;he was relieved. It wasn't that&mdash;she had
  promised. He laughed again, wheezing a little.</p>

  <p>"But it is a distressing predicament, just the same," affirmed Sonia, when
  the purple-faced doctor was again ready to listen. "This girl has fallen
  hopelessly in love with a chap who has turned out to be quite worthless."</p>

  <p>"That's bad," said Endicott sympathetically. "Would you object to telling
  me just how I get in on it?"</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to that. This young fellow is a doctor. I wondered if you
  might not have some counsel to offer in regard to his rehabilitation.... But,
  first, may I proceed with Phyllis's story? Naturally I'm better posted with
  that part of it. Phyllis Dexter's mother was a patient of yours about a year
  ago and died, I believe, here in Parkway Hospital." Sonia paused a moment, at
  this point of her narrative, and Endicott, stertorously clearing his throat,
  said he remembered the incident.</p>

  <p>"Her father died, too," continued Sonia, "and her sister entered a
  convent. Phyllis came back home, though in actual fact there was no home to
  come to, and immediately sought the advice of Dean Harcourt. He had known the
  family very well. It was there that I met her. I took her to live with
  me."</p>

  <p>"Supporting her, you mean?" Endicott's eyes were troubled.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. Perhaps I should have told you earlier what my business is. I
  am the proprietor of a dress shop."</p>

  <p>"I can well believe it." His eyes lighted a little with undisguised
  admiration.</p>

  <p>"Thank you. Everyone likes pretty clothes, I think.... So I took Phyllis
  into the shop, where she has been very useful to me, though I know she
  despised her job like the devil. A few months ago&mdash;she quite often went
  to Trinity Cathedral to see Dean Harcourt&mdash;Phyllis met a very handsome
  young fellow who was there for a long private conference with the Dean."</p>

  <p>"I'm not surprised," Endicott interposed reminiscently. "There's something
  positively fascinating about the man's philosophy. The last time I met
  him&mdash;it was in his own library; I happened to be in the city&mdash;very
  shortly after Mrs. Dexter's death, by the way&mdash;and, knowing of their
  warm friendship, I wanted to talk to him. There he sat, resting his weight on
  his elbows, pain-shattered eyes looking at you, and through you, and beyond
  you, discoursing on what he pleased to call 'The Long Parade'&mdash;his stock
  phrase for the human scene. In that atmosphere, one seemed to be curiously
  hypnotized out of one's participation in contemporary affairs and forced to
  view the pilgrimage objectively. I remember that while he was calmly pursuing
  his theme the siren of a swift ambulance screamed, a few streets away, and
  the thought flashed across my mind&mdash;'No matter. A few are hurt, here and
  there. Some fall down, and have to be gathered up. But nothing can stop the
  Long Parade. It carries on....' He has a very real and amazingly convincing
  belief in compensation. You do get what you're looking for. The wages, in the
  long run, are fair. Things come out right, in the general average.... You're
  almost obliged to believe it&mdash;at least while he's talking." Endicott
  became suddenly aware that he had interrupted a narrative and apologetically
  signed to Sonia that she should continue. "So&mdash;Phyllis met her young
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;by mere chance. But it proved to be a case of love at first
  sight, if there is any such thing. He didn't tell her any details about
  himself, but she discovered accidentally that he was&mdash;or had
  been&mdash;a surgeon.</p>

  <p>"Then he suddenly disappeared, leaving no word. My Phyllis became a
  different girl; lost her appetite, lost her spirits, lost interest in
  everything and everybody. I grew quite distressed about her.... And then,
  some weeks ago, to our great delight, Dean Harcourt found a splendid position
  for her, supervising a girls' private school in Montana."</p>

  <p>"Delightful!" exclaimed Endicott.</p>

  <p>"That part of it&mdash;yes. But she had no more than arrived when she
  learned that her charming young doctor was rusticating with another older
  ne'er-do-well in a mountain shack, hunting and loafing, apparently quite
  indifferent to what anyone might think of his complete collapse into such
  degradation. It was a shocking disappointment!"</p>

  <p>"Most unusual coincidence, I should say, their drifting into the same
  locality."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;if it was a coincidence." Sonia's tone and brows were
  sceptical. "I can't forget that this young fellow had been in a confidential
  conversation with Dean Harcourt before he left, and it was the Dean who
  discovered the position for Phyllis."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't sound much like Harcourt," observed Endicott, perplexed, "to
  send this fine young woman out to cultivate acquaintance with a chap of that
  sort."</p>

  <p>"Now&mdash;there you are!" declared Sonia impressively. "What sort of
  chap? Evidently the Dean knows more about him than we do. And has confidence
  in him."</p>

  <p>"He hasn't said?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word&mdash;except that he was bound to secrecy."</p>

  <p>"It's very odd." Endicott studied the fire for a moment. "How did Phyllis
  happen to learn about this fellow? Run into him accidentally out there?"</p>

  <p>Sonia meditated a reply and thought she would like another cigarette. Her
  experienced host was happy to oblige. He brought her the lacquered box and
  was hovering over her with a lighted match when she suddenly answered his
  question.</p>

  <p>"He had left his dog at the house where she lives&mdash;a fine red setter.
  She recognized the dog&mdash;Sylvia."</p>

  <p>Dr. Endicott's hand trembled. He fumbled in the box for another match and
  had great trouble lighting it. His eyes were averted. Sonia saw that she had
  given him a serious shock. Muttering an apology for his clumsiness, he
  returned to his chair and slumped down in it with the supine posture of a
  very old man.</p>

  <p>"So"&mdash;concluded Sonia&mdash;"there they are&mdash;Phyllis worrying
  her heart out in little Wembelton&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wembelton?" echoed Endicott, scouring his memory.</p>

  <p>"Yes, just a little town.... And the young doctor she's in love with is
  living the life of a tramp and a hermit in a shack on top of Boone
  Mountain."</p>

  <p>Endicott's eyes suddenly came to attention and his face twitched with
  excitement. He gave a cry of mingled rage and grief, rose from his chair, and
  began pacing, staggeringly, back and forth before her, his trembling hands
  clenched into fists. Sonia sat regarding him with frozen horror.</p>

  <p><i>"Boone Mountain!"</i> he was shouting. <i>"Boone Mountain! By
  God!&mdash;I won't have him up there on Boone Mountain!</i> I know all about
  that shack on Boone Mountain! It has cost the lives of the three finest
  bacteriologists in this country&mdash;men who deserved a better death than
  that of a guinea pig in that damned pest-hole! <i>I won't have him up there,
  I tell you!"</i></p>

  <p>Sonia sat stupefied with amazement. If she had come here to give Dr.
  Endicott a hard jolt, he had most assuredly returned it in full. He staggered
  back to his chair now and sank into it, burying his livid face in his
  quivering hands. She waited, with mounting anxiety. What if the shock should
  be too much for him!</p>

  <p>"Is there anything I can get for you, Doctor?" she asked, thoroughly
  frightened now. There was no reply. "Shall I ring, Dr. Endicott?" she
  insisted, in an agitated voice. "Do you want me to call the man?" She laid a
  hand on his sagging shoulder.</p>

  <p>He shook his head, without looking up. It was a very difficult moment.
  Sonia, deeply moved by Endicott's utter breakdown, touched his bowed white
  head. He straightened a little and, becoming aware of her solicitude, roused
  to his duty as her host.</p>

  <p>"You'll be wanting to go now, my dear," he muttered huskily. "Push that
  button, the one by the door, please. Edwards will let you out."</p>

  <p>Sonia went away bewildered by conflicting emotions, exultant over the
  clear vindication of Paige and the amazing disclosure that would certainly
  revolutionize the world for Phyllis, but quite undone by her participation in
  the scene of an eminent man's collapse.</p>

  <p>She had once stood with blanched lips and troubled eyes watching a
  beautiful and costly building in flames; had seen the fire shatter the large
  plate-glass windows, blacken the finely wrought cornices, and thrust mocking
  red tongues through the sculptured doorway. But the devastation she had
  witnessed to-night was infinitely more spectacular. It had completely
  unnerved her. The best she had hoped for was an opportunity to inform Dr.
  Endicott how the case stood. She had had no notion of attempting anything so
  brazenly audacious and unquestionably futile as the twisting of a confession
  out of the sick and unhappy surgeon. It would be enough to leave the thought
  with him that he might, if he wished, undo at least a little of the damage he
  had caused; that he had it in his power to bring happiness to the daughter of
  the woman whose life had been sacrificed to pay for his inexcusable
  blunder.</p>

  <p>It had been her hope to take the eleven-fifteen train home, but she
  decided that the incredible event must be reported to Phyllis without delay.
  She went quickly to her room, slipped out of her black velvet and into pink
  silk, seated herself at the desk and wrote, as calmly as was possible in her
  state of upheaval, the full minutes of the meeting with Dr. Endicott.</p>

  <p>The letter was finished at midnight. Affixing airmail postage, she
  summoned a boy and sent it down. Neurally spent, she tumbled into bed and
  slept the sleep of utter exhaustion.</p>

  <p>Edwards seemed quite mystified by Dr. Endicott's request for a whisky and
  soda. It had been a very rare occurrence for the doctor to indulge in
  anything more potent than a glass of light wine, and even this innocuous
  beverage had been denied him for many weeks.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, sir," hesitated Edwards. "Did I understand you, sir? Whisky,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;you understood me. Go and get it." Endicott had not stirred
  from his supine slump in the red-leather chair before the grate.</p>

  <p>The wretched year passed in review, the humiliating pageant opening with
  the scene of his standing beside Newell when they were scrubbing up after the
  fatal operation. He had been too dismayed over what had just
  happened&mdash;on top of the announcement that he had lost a quarter of a
  million&mdash;to venture any conversation. The hour's events had left him
  speechless. He had postponed the other operation scheduled for the day and
  had gone home. To-morrow he would see Newell and relieve him of the blame he
  had volunteered to assume for his chief's sake. But Newell did not appear at
  Parkway the next morning. A rumour had it that he had left town. Doubtless
  the chap had been so upset over the tragedy that he wanted a day or two for
  recovery. He would be back presently, and their amicable relations could be
  resumed. The days became weeks. Nobody seemed to know anything about Newell's
  whereabouts. Well&mdash;he wouldn't stay away indefinitely. One would have to
  wait until the young fellow returned.</p>

  <p>But the worrisome uncertainty had gradually become a torture. One went to
  bed with it at night and got up with it in the morning. After a while it was
  not content to be the final blistering thought as the light went out and the
  first depressing thought when the dawn streamed in. It now resolved to rouse
  one at three in the morning. It further determined to defer one's sleep until
  two. It stood before the reader as he sat in his library in the evenings, and
  sullenly rebuked him at every brief interval when he turned a page.</p>

  <p>It had not been Newell's fault, but somehow his name had come to stand for
  the torture that was now ubiquitous and continuous. Any chance reference to
  him was painful. Endicott had stopped hoping that he would come back. The
  sight of him would be unendurable.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;Boone Mountain had completely reappraised this miserable
  situation. The young fellow he had admired and loved from childhood, and had
  counselled as a student, and promoted to a position of distinction, was in
  danger of losing his life.</p>

  <p>Endicott took another generous gulp of his Scotch and soda.</p>

  <p>So he had confided in Harcourt, had he? Harcourt would probably have
  contrived to get the whole story out of him. It was unlikely that Newell
  would go there for that purpose; but, once there, the uncannily prescient
  Harcourt would make short work of his reticence. He took another large
  swallow and shuddered&mdash;shuddered at the bitter flame of the drink, and
  shuddered at the thought of Dean Harcourt's disappointment and disgust. For,
  he remembered, Harcourt had been most comradely in his attitude; had
  gracefully imputed to him a devotion to tireless duty in the cause of human
  rehabilitation.</p>

  <p>Queer fellow, this Harcourt!&mdash;with his other-worldly detachment, as
  if he were a spectator on a neighbouring star, taking notes on the human
  scene, viewing it whole, from the dim days of the stone axe to the present
  clamour of a mechanized era&mdash;and yet able to evaluate, with uncanny
  understanding, the psychology of an endless procession of wretched people who
  came to him with their difficulties. Endicott recalled that he himself had
  felt deeply explored when meeting the challenge of those cavernous eyes. The
  eyes had not directly accused him of anything, but they had diligently
  inquired how he was getting along&mdash;inside.</p>

  <p>'The Long Parade'&mdash;that was Harcourt's self-coined phrase. It's the
  integrity of the Long Parade that we're striving for; not the skyrockety
  conspicuousness of the few who, however high they may contrive to hoist
  themselves for an hour or two, are quickly forgotten.</p>

  <p>Endicott remembered that he had whimsically asked the Dean whether he
  really believed that humanity was being pushed <i>en masse</i> by some
  irresistible urge, as the strange propulsion that occasionally seizes and
  drives the uncountable millions of little lemmings across the plains of
  Sweden, through the towns, over the mountains, and into the sea&mdash;and had
  been suddenly sobered when the man had stoutly declared, "No! No! We are not
  driven from behind, but lured from before! Not pushed, but pulled! Magnetized
  from beyond!"</p>

  <p>And Harcourt had been willing to talk to him in this mystical, idealistic
  fashion because he believed him worthy of opinions about human destiny;
  considered him, too, an idealist and mystic. Harcourt probably thought of him
  now as a shameless cad.</p>

  <p>Could it be possible, reflected Endicott, that his own moral collapse had
  been responsible for his physical decline? Was it this catastrophe that had
  been making an old man of him in his prime, slowing his step, shortening his
  breath, dulling his eye, deadening his spirit? Could it be
  true&mdash;absurdly paradoxical as it sounded&mdash;that whoever tried to
  save his own life would lose it?... He rose, stretched his arms to their full
  tension, clenched his fists with determination, and walked with something
  like his old self-confident stride to his desk.</p>

  <p>His hand trembled a little as he took up the pen, but it was the agitation
  of conscious victory. His eyes were misty as he wrote:</p>

  <p class="letter">"My dear Boy."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PAIGE patted the sand and gravel down evenly with the flat
  of his spade, and walking a little way apart sat, rather preoccupied, gazing
  at the small rectangular mound he had made.</p>

  <p>The work had taken him more than an hour to complete, and he had done it
  bareheaded, saying to himself, as he tossed his battered grey felt hat aside,
  that he could dig better without it; but now that the task was done, he did
  no put the hat back on as he sat there dreamily contemplating this little
  heap of mountain rubble.</p>

  <p>He had resolved not to be sentimental about it. Sylvia had been such a
  meticulously clean person that it was no more than her rightful due, he
  thought, to be carefully wrapped in heavy burlap, sewn with firm stitches,
  and nailed securely into the tight pine box, before putting her back into the
  elements from which she had come.</p>

  <p>Stafford had generously volunteered to do it, and had gruffly counselled
  his associate researchist to "get the hell out o' here and take a walk" while
  he disposed of poor Sylvia who last night was a wretched little bundle of hot
  misery and this morning was cold and stiff.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think I'd better do it, old man. Thanks, just the same," Paige had
  replied, feeling that Sylvia really deserved his presence on this occasion.
  He wasn't going to be silly and soft about it, of course. Dogs, barring
  accidents, only lived to be a dozen or so years old. Sylvia was nearly seven.
  He mustn't pretend it was out of the natural course of things, or make any
  display of his feelings to the disgust of Stafford, who affected a hard
  contempt toward any sign of emotion.</p>

  <p>One thing had troubled Paige more than a little. He should have been more
  prudent about safeguarding Sylvia. When she had come bounding into the shack,
  a few days ago, he had been so happy to see her that he hadn't reckoned
  seriously enough on the danger of allowing her to remain. After all, the wood
  ticks had given up the battle for the season, and the chances of Sylvia's
  being bitten were very remote. Of course, there was all manner of stuff in
  the laboratory that she mustn't on any account get into, but they could
  easily keep her out of there. He hadn't counted on Tobias, the sick monkey.
  Tobias had assisted in the spotted-fever research for some weeks and had
  proved himself to be almost incredibly hardy. Stafford had suggested, after
  one particularly venomous inoculation of a mess that should have invalided
  any normal beast, "Tobias is too damned mean for a germ to live in; that's
  the trouble. Toxins pumped into his hide simply give up the ghost."
  But&mdash;even so&mdash;Tobias had fallen ill of a fever, and no debate was
  needed to discover what kind of fever it was. He had made a great deal of
  noise. Whether it had excited Sylvia's sympathy or merely her curiosity, she
  had stood in front of the unpleasant and indisposed Tobias regarding him
  interestedly with her soft brown eyes. The monkey had suddenly thrust a hot,
  hairy arm through the cage and scratched one of Sylvia's long, silky ears.
  They had cauterized the small lesion thoroughly and trusted to luck that they
  had caught it in time.... But that was the way with this dirty stuff; it
  began operations immediately. Germicides seemed to have no value at all.</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;whoever was to blame, what had happened had happened, and there
  wasn't anything to be done about it... Sylvia probably had been up the
  mountain road far enough to sense the direction. A day earlier she had seen
  him climbing the slope. She had strolled out of the Gibson house and
  proceeded on her own, as any bright dog might have done under the
  circumstances.... And as for the poisonous fury of the hell-cat Tobias, such
  accidents were difficult to foresee. No&mdash;it was useless to brood about
  it. No amount of moping would do Sylvia the least bit of good.</p>

  <p>But you could be as unsentimental as you pleased, the fact remained that
  the death of Sylvia marked the end of an epoch. She had been the one warm,
  loyal, affectionate link with that other phase of his life. She had sat in
  his car patiently waiting while he spent the morning in the operating-room
  back in the days&mdash;how remote they seemed, and only a year off in terms
  of the calendar&mdash;when life had been lived to the full.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;critically examined&mdash;was it so full? The work at Parkway
  had been an unfailing source of challenging interest and the beautiful
  apartment at the Hermitage had been a luxurious haven after the day's work.
  But, in sober truth, hadn't the whole routinish round of hospital duties and
  bachelor-suite diversions resolved itself into a sort of unobjectionable
  treadmill? Honesty obliged him to confess that he hadn't really lived until
  the day he met Phyllis.</p>

  <p>There had been plenty of time for thinking about her. Sometimes, during
  his stay at the Grey Lode Mine, after an hour's steady review of her wide
  blue eyes, her full mobile lips, her ravishingly deep dimples, her
  exquisitely shaped hands and sinuous form, his censor mind cynically
  suggested that he had probably idealized the girl out of all proportion to
  her actual gifts, hinting that if ever he saw her again&mdash;which was
  improbable&mdash;he might marvel at the hoax he had perpetrated on himself.
  But last Sunday Phyllis had not only justified all his day-dreaming: she had
  disclosed some charming little tricks of manner, gesture, inflection, that
  had made him want her with a longing too deep to be trusted to any words that
  might attempt to define his feeling.</p>

  <p>Sylvia was gone&mdash;and with her departure there had gone also his sense
  of hopeless wishing for a recovery of the monotonous life he had lived as a
  surgeon at Parkway Hospital. True&mdash;surgery was his natural
  <i>métier,</i> and he would never feel entirely at home and happy doing
  anything else; but he could readjust himself, he thought, to some other type
  of activity&mdash;bacteriology or research perhaps&mdash;if only he might
  have Phyllis.</p>

  <p>Of course, he would have a great deal of explaining to do, but he could
  make out a good case for himself. He grinned a little. Phyllis thought he was
  a tramp, a shaggy bum. He had allowed her to think so. Indeed, he hadn't much
  option in this matter, for Stafford had exacted a promise that he would tell
  no one what they were doing, and Phyllis assuredly was <i>someone.</i> She
  would find out, in due time, and whatever disgust she had felt because of his
  alleged idleness would vanish. She might even go so far as to be pleased that
  he had tried to make himself useful in a job that was far from enjoyable.</p>

  <p>He heartily wished he might have an hour's chat with Dean Harcourt. He
  believed he would be able to summon the courage necessary to state the case
  of his love for Phyllis and ask for counsel. It was odd&mdash;her coming out
  here where he was. Curious coincidence. The thought occurred that he might
  write a letter to the Dean and tell him how things stood&mdash;and did he
  have a right to tell Phyllis how he felt? Instantly he rejected this idea.
  You couldn't hope to tell it in a letter.</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;good old Stafford would be thinking it was about time for him
  to show up. He gathered a few armfuls of leaves and threw them over Sylvia's
  grave, shouldered his spade, and strolled toward the shack. There was a note
  on the table. Stafford had had his lunch and had gone down to Wembelton for
  the afternoon. "I suppose you'd be just as well pleased to be alone to-day,"
  he had scribbled, as a postscript. "I'll be back about five."</p>

  <p>Newell poached a couple of eggs, toasted a slice of bread, ate his simple
  fare standing, lighted his pipe, locked the door, and went out, taking the
  path down the mountain with the thought that it would be comforting to lounge
  for an hour on the gray granite ledge where, a week ago, he had found
  Phyllis.</p>

  <p>He had dreamed about her so much, and longed for her so passionately, that
  he was distrustful of his own sight, fearing what he thought and hoped he saw
  would turn out to be an hallucination. With pounding heart he stood for a
  long moment wondering if his vision were playing a cruel trick on him.</p>

  <p>No&mdash;there she was, adorable creature, sitting exactly where they had
  sat on the slight elevation of the great rock where the full view of the
  valley burst through the graceful tops of the pines. For some time she was
  wholly unaware of his coming; sat with arms clasping her knees, her little
  hat tossed aside, her coat thrown open and off her shapely shoulders.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly towards her from the thick wood and presently she glanced
  quickly, startled, in his direction. Then&mdash;the thing that happened
  swiftly, incredibly, so astonished him that he stopped in his tracks, unable
  to fathom it. Phyllis had leaped to her feet and was running towards him with
  all the abandon of an ecstatic child. She was flourishing an open letter.</p>

  <p>"Look!" she shouted. "Oh&mdash;I'm so glad for you! I was <i>so</i> in
  hope you'd come!" She thrust the letter into his hand, and taking his arm,
  began tugging him along to the place where she had been sitting.</p>

  <p>"Read it!" she commanded, curling up so close beside him that her head
  touched his shoulder. "It's wonderful!" she whispered. Then, impulsively, she
  laid a hand over the letter and facing him asked, with an impatience that
  could wait no longer, "What is it that's so dangerous on Boone Mountain?"</p>

  <p>His promise to Stafford seemed to give way to the prior privilege of this
  question. She had a right to know.</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;he explained, hesitatingly&mdash;"the Government Research
  Laboratory for the investigation of spotted fever is up there: is that what
  you mean?"</p>

  <p>"And you are in it?" she asked, laying her hand on his arm, anxiously.</p>

  <p>He nodded, and smiled into her apprehensive eyes.</p>

  <p>There were two big, hot tears on her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Please forgive me&mdash;for what I said to you&mdash;the other day."</p>

  <p>Newell patted her hand and said it was all right and that she hadn't any
  way of knowing what he was up to&mdash;out here on the mountain.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she said, when she had recovered her voice a little, "did Sylvia
  get there safely? I wanted you to have her, and Mrs. Gibson said there wasn't
  any reason that she knew of why you shouldn't&mdash;so I brought her up this
  far and told her to go and find you."</p>

  <p>"You're a dear girl, Phyllis," he said slowly&mdash;a little downcast,
  though, she thought. "Sylvia arrived&mdash;in gay spirits."</p>

  <p>Phyllis studied his face intently when she saw that he was avoiding her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Funny she isn't with you. I should have loved to see her."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied mechanically, "and she would have liked to see you."</p>

  <p>"Newell!" It was the first time she had spoken his name and it stirred him
  deeply. She caught his arm tightly in both hands. "Don't tell me that
  anything has happened to Sylvia!"</p>

  <p>There was an extended silence while he tried to think of some gracious way
  to break the bad news. Interpreting his perplexity, she tugged hard at his
  arm, and asked in a frightened voice, "Newell&mdash;is Sylvia sick?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted, adding, "that is&mdash;she <i>was</i> sick."</p>

  <p>Phyllis pressed her forehead against his shoulder and wept like a little
  child. For an instant he was strongly tempted to put his arm about her, but
  doubted his right to take advantage of a moment when she was giving way to
  her sorrow and regret over the loss of Sylvia. He laid his hand tenderly on
  her yellow-gold head.</p>

  <p>"You must not blame yourself, dear," he said consolingly. "You didn't know
  there was any danger. And there wasn't, really, if I had taken proper
  precautions.... And I believe that Sylvia would have been glad to know that
  her death had&mdash;" He paused for a moment, groping for the right words,
  and finished with "She was very fond of us both, you know."</p>

  <p>He felt the yellow-gold head nod an affirmation against his arm.</p>

  <p>"She would gladly have died to make friends of us," said Newell
  gently.</p>

  <p>Presently Phyllis straightened, rubbed the tears out of her eyes with the
  backs of her wrists, as a very little girl might have done, he reflected, and
  said, thickly, "Read that letter!"</p>

  <p>To Newell's amazement, she snuggled very close to his side&mdash;so close
  that he could feel her soft contours and the beating of her heart against the
  arm she held tightly. With her cheeks pressed hard against him as she
  followed the lines he was reading, it was very difficult for him to
  concentrate on Sonia's excited scrawl.</p>

  <p>Phyllis felt him growing more and more tense as the amazing chronicle
  moved forward toward its dramatic climax. He was almost there now, and his
  hands were trembling as he shifted the pages.</p>

  <p>"<i>God!"</i> he shouted. "<i>The good old duffer's going to come through!
  He's going to come clean! He's going to set me free!"</i></p>

  <p>Thoroughly shaken with excitement, he tossed the letter aside, and
  catching Phyllis in his arms, hugged her so tightly that her cheek touched
  his. At the contact, they both drew back a little and soberly looked into
  each other's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean to be so rough with you," he stammered apologetically.
  "This means so much to me, dear, that I lost my head. I'm sorry." But he had
  not released her, and she had made no effort to pull away.</p>

  <p>His conciliating smile of penitence for his audacity entreated her to
  believe that he had been overcome with the joyful news, but Phyllis did not
  respond to the smile. Looking up at him steadily from under her heavy lashes,
  she gazed long and earnestly at his face. Her lips were parted, and she
  seemed about to speak, but she remained silent, letting her amber-tinted look
  of inquiry ramble from his tanned forehead to his tense jaw, and back again,
  dreamily, confidently, to the questing steel-blue eyes that waited and
  wondered. Her breath was coming fast. His grasp tightened ever so little;
  and, closing her eyes, Phyllis relaxed contentedly into his arms. Her hand
  crept up his coat, lingered for an instant on his shoulder, and stole gently
  around his neck, caressing his hair.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;my darling!" he whispered. "Can this wonderful thing be
  true?"</p>

  <p>Sometimes, when half-mad with loneliness and desire for her, he had
  indulged himself in a fleeting speculation on the ecstasy of having Phyllis
  in his arms. But his imagination had never pictured the confident and tender
  response she made to his kiss. After a while he ran his long, strong fingers
  through her curls. She opened her eyes and smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's a lovely head," he told her softly.</p>

  <p>Phyllis sighed.</p>

  <p>"It has worried&mdash;a lot&mdash;about you," she whispered, regarding him
  with brooding affection. There was a long pause.</p>

  <p>"Tell me something," said Newell intimately. "How did you happen to come
  away out here to Wembelton?"</p>

  <p>"Dean Harcourt," she replied, smiling.</p>

  <p>"But you didn't know <i>I</i> was here, did you?"</p>

  <p>Phyllis shook her head, the smile deepening her dimples, and said, a bit
  teasingly, "Now you'll be asking me if I would have come if I had known."</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;it was just a marvellous accident&mdash;our coming together in
  this beautiful land." Newell's enraptured eyes swept the valley and returned
  to hers.</p>

  <p>She laughed softly, and laid her palm against his bronzed cheek.</p>

  <p>"I called it beautiful, last Sunday, and you just said, 'Mmm'&mdash;like
  that."</p>

  <p>"It was true, last Sunday," he declared, "'Mmm' was quite sufficient to
  describe it." He drew her very tightly to him again. A great miracle had
  happened. They weren't quite sure yet that it was real.</p>

  <p>On the way down they met Stafford. He seemed to loom up suddenly through
  the pines like an apparition. Phyllis freed her hand and whispered, "Now
  you've some explaining to do, my boy."</p>

  <p>Stafford's eyes widened with interest. The three of them halted and
  considered each other in an embarrassing silence for a moment, and since it
  was high time somebody offered an observation, no matter how unimportant, the
  older man ventured the opinion that it had been a pleasant afternoon.</p>

  <p>"You don't know the half of it!" remarked Newell mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I can guess," grunted Stafford. "Congratulations!"</p>

  <p>"It isn't exactly impromptu, Doctor," explained Newell. "We have known
  each other for some time&mdash;long before we were thrown together
  accidentally out here."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;accidentally!" Stafford growled. "<i>I</i> was
  responsible for Miss Dexter's coming here. My friend Dean
  Harcourt&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you know Dean Harcourt?" Phyllis and Newell shouted in concert.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" Stafford's boast was expansive. "Old buddies. Last time I was out
  there, we went fishin' together..."</p>

  <p>Newell grinned.</p>

  <p>"When was that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;five years ago, maybe," he lied reminiscently. "By the way,
  Paige, here's a letter for you I picked up at the Post Office. Old man Flook
  opened up for me.... Well&mdash;I'll trudge along. Good luck to you both." He
  touched his shapeless old hat and resumed his tramp up the hill. Newell
  inspected the handwriting on the envelope, and gathered Phyllis into his
  arms, his lips close to her ear.</p>

  <p>"It's from Dr. Endicott!" he whispered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was twenty minutes after four. The carillon was booming
  historic hymn tunes from the taller of Trinity Cathedral's massive towers.
  Old Saltus, who played the chimes, was evidently under the influence of this
  bright and perfumed June afternoon, for his selections were high-spirited.
  Talbot, who had been expecting him, met Newell at the street door of the
  Dean's Residence and welcomed him with beaming smiles. The wide hallway
  brought back stirring memories. There was the thick rug, just inside the
  door, where Sylvia had waited, and beyond was the reception room where
  Phyllis had been found gazing moodily out through the window&mdash;fourteen
  months ago.</p>

  <p>"I shall take you directly to Dean Harcourt," said Talbot. "He will be
  wanting to see your papers before the others arrive."</p>

  <p>As they passed the door of the reception room, Newell glanced in and saw
  several women callers waiting. Talbot paused there and made the brief
  announcement that the Dean would be occupied for a little while, but would
  see each of them later on if they did not object to a slight delay.</p>

  <p>Then they went on until they reached the library door, which Talbot opened
  and, stepping aside, signed to Newell to enter alone.</p>

  <p>The Dean's deep-set eyes smiled affectionately. "I have been looking
  forward to this day, my son," he said warmly, as Newell clasped the
  outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>"And so have I, sir. It was a long winter&mdash;and an almost interminable
  spring."</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Newell.... You were wise to wait. It gave Phyllis a chance to
  keep faith with her people at the girls' school, and you stuck it out bravely
  with that fine fellow Stafford until he found a good man to replace you."</p>

  <p>Newell grinned reminiscently.</p>

  <p>"I have often wondered how Stafford made connection with you, sir. He
  speaks of you as his pal; says you went fishing together some five years
  ago."</p>

  <p>"I wish it might have been true," said the Dean. "And when do you begin
  your work at Parkway Hospital?"</p>

  <p>"In September. The Board generously consented that I might have a few
  weeks before taking charge. It is fortunate for us. We have planned a trip.
  Doubtless Phyllis told you."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I had a visit from her yesterday. You are attending the
  Arlen-Norwood wedding in New York on Thursday and you sail on Saturday for
  England."</p>

  <p>"Phyllis wants to show me some things in London."</p>

  <p>"Saint Olave's Church, for one, I think."</p>

  <p>"She says you can hear the past&mdash;at Saint Olave's."</p>

  <p>"And the present and the future. You go there with her, Newell, and listen
  with Phyllis. If you hear what she hears, you may feel that you are almost
  worthy of her companionship.... May I see your licence now? They will be
  arriving any minute."</p>

  <p>Newell produced his precious papers and, standing close beside the Dean,
  laid a hand gently on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I have been trying, sir, to think of something to say&mdash;something
  that might express at least a little of the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dean Harcourt glanced up and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I know what you feel, my boy. It isn't necessary to offer any resolutions
  of gratitude. I have been abundantly repaid by the happiness that has come to
  you both. Let's not try to talk about it."</p>

  <p>"You gave me back my life, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;don't forget that our keen-witted Sonia had a great deal to do
  with that. Dr. Endicott might have been a long time deciding to do his duty
  if it hadn't been for the&mdash;for the encouragement Sonia offered him....
  Very good stuff in Endicott, after all. He came to see me afterwards. I
  regard that conversation as one of the most interesting events of my
  life."</p>

  <p>"I know I shall never live long enough to forget the interview <i>I</i>
  had with you, sir, the day you talked to me about the 'Green Light'."</p>

  <p>"You believe that now, don't you? You ought to." The Dean searched
  Newell's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I do, sir!"</p>

  <p>"So does Endicott. Don't be afraid to talk with him about it sometime.
  He's pretty well posted on the subject&mdash;now that his health is so much
  better."</p>

  <p>The door opened and Talbot ushered in Phyllis and Sonia&mdash;Phyllis
  adorable in a silver-grey travelling suit touched with an enlivening bit of
  cherry, and a smart little hat involved in the same scheme; Sonia stunning in
  severely tailored black, so admirably expressive of her dashing type.</p>

  <p>With affectionate smiles for salutations, they quietly gathered in front
  of the big mahogany desk and the Dean opened his liturgy. When the <i>I
  do's</i> had been spoken and the rings exchanged and the impressive blessing
  had been pronounced, Newell took Phyllis in his arms. Then, reluctantly
  releasing her, he kissed Sonia tenderly and told her she was a darling.</p>

  <p>"Listen to what old Saltus is playing now!" squeaked the excited Talbot,
  as the melodious measures of <i>Oh, Perfect Love</i> fairly shook the air.
  Newell and Sonia beamed their recognition of the significant song, but
  Phyllis was occupied with a private conference she was having with Dean
  Harcourt, her arm about his neck and her lips close to his ear. She kissed
  him then, and rejoined Newell, who drew her very close. There was a moment's
  silence.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it ever permissible," inquired Phyllis roguishly, "for the
  officiating clergyman to kiss the bridesmaid?"</p>

  <p>Newell and Talbot joined in approving the playful suggestion, fully
  expecting the Dean and Sonia to accept the challenge without the slightest
  hesitation or constraint.</p>

  <p>A barely perceptible wince of pain fleetingly clouded Dean Harcourt's
  brooding eyes as he drew a brief smile in response to Phyllis's question.
  Sonia's face was sober. After an instant of indecision, she went to him,
  stooped over him, and tenderly kissed him on the forehead. He took both of
  her pretty hands in his and, holding them for a moment against his deep-lined
  cheeks, pressed his lips on her fingertips. Not a word was exchanged, or a
  smile.</p>

  <p>Talbot noisily cleared his throat and announced boisterously that it was
  high time to say good-bye if they were to catch their train. Sonia, quite
  herself again, followed them to the door, where Phyllis and Newell paused,
  arms tightly linked, to wave farewell.</p>

  <p>Then they were gone; and Sonia, slowly returning to the desk, responded to
  the Dean's quiet gesture and sat down opposite him.</p>

  <p>Nothing was said for a little while.</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;Dean Harcourt's voice was husky but attempted to be
  casual&mdash;"it has been a good day's work."</p>

  <p>Sonia nodded, rather pensively, without looking up.</p>

  <p>There was another extended pause.</p>

  <p>"Well"&mdash;said the Dean again, quite obviously with no definite plans
  for the rest of the sentence&mdash;"I suppose I should be letting you go
  now."</p>

  <p>Sonia nodded again, and began stroking a glove on to her slim fingers.</p>

  <p>"There are some callers still waiting out there, I think," he said gently,
  significantly.</p>

  <p>She rose, pulled off her exquisite little black hat, and walked to the
  door of the dressing-room. Standing before the mirror, she toyed for a moment
  with the blue-black hair at her temples. He reached out his hand as she
  passed him, and she held it in both of hers, very tightly, her head bowed and
  her eyes closed. Then she moved away reluctantly.</p>

  <p>It was five now, and Trinity's stirring theme-song confidently confessed
  its faith&mdash;<i>O God, our help in ages past; our hope for years to
  come.</i></p>

  <p>At the door Sonia paused, her back pressed against it, her hand grasping
  the knob. The Dean's eyes were dreamily contemplating the Holman Hunt etching
  on the wall while he listened to the bells.</p>

  <p>She stood there, her own eyes following his to the patient face in the
  picture, until the vibration of the last triumphant measure had begun to die
  away. Then she turned, and, softly opening the door, as softly closed it
  behind her.</p>
