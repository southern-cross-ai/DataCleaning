<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">ME and my white bulldog Mike was peaceably taking
our beer in a joint on the waterfront when Porkey Straus come
piling in, plumb puffing with excitement.</p>

<p>"Hey, Steve!" he yelped. "What you think? Joe Ritchie's in port
with Terror."</p>

<p>"Well?" I said.</p>

<p>"Well, gee whiz," he said, "you mean to set there and let on
like you don't know nothin' about Terror, Ritchie's fightin'
brindle bull? Why, he's the pit champeen of the Asiatics. He's
killed more fightin' dogs than&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah," I said impatiently. "I know all about him. I been
listenin' to what a bear-cat he is for the last year, in every
Asiatic port I've touched."</p>

<p>"Well," said Porkey, "I'm afraid we ain't goin' to git to see
him perform."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Johnnie Blinn, a shifty-eyed bar-keep.</p>

<p>"Well," said Porkey, "they ain't a dog in Singapore to match
ag'in' him. Fritz Steinmann, which owns the pit and runs the dog
fights, has scoured the port and they just ain't no canine which
their owners'll risk ag'in' Terror. Just my luck. The chance of a
lifetime to see the fightin'est dog of 'em all perform. And they's
no first-class mutt to toss in with him. Say, Steve, why don't you
let Mike fight him?"</p>

<p>"Not a chance," I growled. "Mike gets plenty of scrappin' on the
streets. Besides, I'll tell you straight, I think dog fightin' for
money is a dirty low-down game. Take a couple of fine, upstandin'
dogs, full of ginger and fightin' heart, and throw 'em in a
concrete pit to tear each other's throats out, just so a bunch of
four-flushin' tin-horns like you, which couldn't take a punch or
give one either, can make a few lousy dollars bettin' on 'em."</p>

<p>"But they likes to fight," argued Porkey. "It's their
nature."</p>

<p>"It's the nature of any red-blooded critter to fight. Man or
dog!" I said. "Let 'em fight on the streets, for bones or for fun,
or just to see which is the best dog. But pit-fightin' to the death
is just too dirty for me to fool with, and I ain't goin' to get
Mike into no such mess."</p>

<p>"Aw, let him alone, Porkey," sneered Johnnie Blinn nastily.
"He's too chicken-hearted to mix in them rough games. Ain't you,
Sailor?"</p>

<p>"Belay that," I roared. "You keep a civil tongue in your head,
you wharfside rat. I never did like you nohow, and one more crack
like that gets you this." I brandished my huge fist at him and he
turned pale and started scrubbing the bar like he was trying for a
record.</p>

<p>"I wantcha to know that Mike can lick this Terror mutt," I said,
glaring at Porkey. "I'm fed up hearin' fellers braggin' on that
brindle murderer. Mike can lick him. He can lick any dog in this
lousy port, just like I can lick any man here. If Terror meets Mike
on the street and gets fresh, he'll get his belly-full. But Mike
ain't goin' to get mixed up in no dirty racket like Fritz Steinmann
runs and you can lay to that." I made the last statement in a voice
like a irritated bull, and smashed my fist down on the table so
hard I splintered the wood, and made the decanters bounce on the
bar.</p>

<p>"Sure, sure, Steve," soothed Porkey, pouring hisself a drink
with a shaky hand. "No offense. No offense. Well, I gotta be
goin'."</p>

<p>"So long," I growled, and Porkey cruised off.</p>

<p>Up strolled a man which had been standing by the bar. I knowed
him&mdash;Philip D'Arcy, a man whose name is well known in all
parts of the world. He was a tall, slim, athletic fellow, well
dressed, with bold gray eyes and a steel-trap jaw. He was one of
them gentleman adventurers, as they call 'em, and he'd did
everything from running a revolution in South America and flying a
war plane in a Balkan brawl, to exploring in the Congo. He was
deadly with a six-gun, and as dangerous as a rattler when somebody
crossed him.</p>

<p>"That's a fine dog you have, Costigan," he said. "Clean white.
Not a speck of any other color about him. That means good luck for
his owner."</p>

<p>I knowed that D'Arcy had some pet superstitions of his own, like
lots of men which live by their hands and wits like him.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "anyway, he's about the fightin'est dog you ever
seen."</p>

<p>"I can tell that," he said, stooping and eying Mike close.
"Powerful jaws&mdash;not too undershot&mdash;good teeth&mdash;broad
between the eyes&mdash;deep chest&mdash;legs that brace like iron.
Costigan, I'll give you a hundred dollars for him, just as he
stands."</p>

<p>"You mean you want me to sell you Mike?" I asked kinda
incredulous.</p>

<p>"Sure. Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why not!" I repeatedly indignantly. "Well, gee whiz, why not
ask a man to sell his brother for a hundred dollars? Mike wouldn't
stand for it. Anyway, I wouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"I need him," persisted D'Arcy. "A white dog with a dark
man&mdash;it means luck. White dogs have always been lucky for me.
And my luck's been running against me lately. I'll give you a
hundred and fifty."</p>

<p>"D'Arcy," I said, "you couldst stand there and offer me money
all day long and raise the ante every hand, but it wouldn't be no
good. Mike ain't for sale. Him and me has knocked around the world
together too long. They ain't no use talkin'."</p>

<p>His eyes flashed for a second. He didn't like to be crossed in
any way. Then he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"All right. We'll forget it. I don't blame you for thinking a
lot of him. Let's have a drink."</p>

<p>So we did and he left.</p>

<p>I went and got me a shave, because I was matched to fight some
tramp at Ace Larnigan's Arena and I wanted to be in shape for the
brawl. Well, afterwards I was walking down along the docks when I
heard somebody go: "Hssst!"</p>

<p>I looked around and saw a yellow hand beckon me from behind a
stack of crates. I sauntered over, wondering what it was all about,
and there was a Chinese boy hiding there. He put his finger to his
lips. Then quick he handed me a folded piece of paper, and beat it,
before I couldst ask him anything.</p>

<p>I opened the paper and it was a note in a woman's handwriting
which read:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Steve.<br>
<br>
I have admired you for a long time at a distance, but have been too
timid to make myself known to you. Would it be too much to ask you
to give me an opportunity to tell you my emotions by word of mouth?
If you care at all, I will meet you by the old Manchu House on the
Tungen Road, just after dark.<br>
<br>
An affectionate admirer.<br>
<br>
P .S. Please, oh please be there! You have stole my heart away!</p>

<p>"Mike," I said pensively, "ain't it plumb peculiar the strange
power I got over wimmen, even them I ain't never seen? Here is a
girl I don't even know the name of, even, and she has been eatin'
her poor little heart out in solitude because of me. Well&mdash;" I
hove a gentle sigh&mdash;"it's a fatal gift, I'm afeared."</p>

<p>Mike yawned. Sometimes it looks like he ain't got no romance at
all about him. I went back to the barber shop and had the barber to
put some ile on my hair and douse me with perfume. I always like to
look genteel when I meet a feminine admirer.</p>

<p>Then, as the evening was waxing away, as the poets say, I set
forth for the narrow winding back street just off the waterfront
proper. The natives call it the Tungen Road, for no particular
reason as I can see. The lamps there is few and far between and
generally dirty and dim. The street's lined on both sides by lousy
looking native shops and hovels. You'll come to stretches which
looks clean deserted and falling to ruins.</p>

<p>Well, me and Mike was passing through just such a district when
I heard sounds of some kind of a fracas in a dark alley-way we was
passing. Feet scruffed. They was the sound of a blow and a voice
yelled in English: "Halp! Halp! These Chinese is killin' me!"</p>

<p>"Hold everything," I roared, jerking up my sleeves and plunging
for the alley, with Mike at my heels. "Steve Costigan is on the
job."</p>

<p>It was as dark as a stack of black cats in that alley. Plunging
blind, I bumped into somebody and sunk a fist to the wrist in him.
He gasped and fell away. I heard Mike roar suddenly and somebody
howled bloody murder. Then <i>wham!</i> A blackjack or something
like it smashed on my skull and I went to my knees.</p>

<p>"That's done yer, yer blawsted Yank," said a nasty voice in the
dark.</p>

<p>"You're a liar," I gasped, coming up blind and groggy but
hitting out wild and ferocious. One of my blind licks musta
connected because I heard somebody cuss bitterly. And then
<i>wham</i>, again come that blackjack on my dome. What little
light they was, was behind me, and whoever it was slugging me,
couldst see me better'n I could see him. That last smash put me
down for the count, and he musta hit me again as I fell.</p>

<p>I couldn't of been out but a few minutes. I come to myself lying
in the darkness and filth of the alley and I had a most splitting
headache and dried blood was clotted on a cut in my scalp. I groped
around and found a match in my pocket and struck it.</p>

<p>The alley was empty. The ground was all tore up and they was
some blood scattered around, but neither the thugs nor Mike was
nowhere to be seen. I run down the alley, but it ended in a blank
stone wall. So I come back onto the Tungen Road and looked up and
down but seen nobody. I went mad.</p>

<p>"Philip D'Arcy!" I yelled all of a sudden. "He done it. He stole
Mike. He writ me that note. Unknown admirer, my eye. I been played
for a sucker again. He thinks Mike'll bring him luck. I'll bring
him luck, the double-crossin' son-of-a-seacook. I'll sock him so
hard he'll bite hisself in the ankle. I'll bust him into so many
pieces he'll go through a sieve&mdash;"</p>

<p>With these meditations, I was running down the street at full
speed, and when I busted into a crowded thoroughfare, folks turned
and looked at me in amazement. But I didn't pay no heed. I was
steering my course for the European Club, a kind of ritzy place
where D'Arcy generally hung out. I was still going at top-speed
when I run up the broad stone steps and was stopped by a pompous
looking doorman which sniffed scornfully at my appearance, with my
clothes torn and dirty from laying in the alley, and my hair all
touseled and dried blood on my hair and face.</p>

<p>"Lemme by," I gritted, "I gotta see a mutt."</p>

<p>"Gorblime," said the doorman. "You cawn't go in there. This is a
very exclusive club, don't you know. Only gentlemen are allowed
here. Cawn't have a blawsted gorilla like you bursting in on the
gentlemen. My word! Get along now before I call the police."</p>

<p>There wasn't time to argue.</p>

<p>With a howl of irritation I grabbed him by the neck and heaved
him into a nearby goldfish pond. Leaving him floundering and
howling, I kicked the door open and rushed in. I dashed through a
wide hallway and found myself in a wide room with big French
winders. That seemed to be the main club room, because it was very
scrumptiously furnished and had all kinds of animal heads on the
walls, alongside of crossed swords and rifles in racks.</p>

<p>They was a number of Americans and Europeans setting around
drinking whiskey-and-sodas, and playing cards. I seen Philip D'Arcy
setting amongst a bunch of his club-members, evidently spinning
yards about his adventures. And I seen red.</p>

<p>"D'Arcy!" I yelled, striding toward him regardless of the card
tables I upset. "Where's my dog?"</p>

<p>Philip D'Arcy sprang up with a kind of gasp and all the club men
jumped up too, looking amazed.</p>

<p>"My word!" said a Englishman in a army officer's uniform. "Who
let this boundah in? Come, come, my man, you'll have to get out of
this."</p>

<p>"You keep your nose clear of this or I'll bend it clean outa
shape," I howled, shaking my right mauler under the aforesaid nose.
"This ain't none of your business. D'Arcy, what you done with my
dog?"</p>

<p>"You're drunk, Costigan," he snapped. "I don't know what you're
talking about."</p>

<p>"That's a lie," I screamed, crazy with rage. "You tried to buy
Mike and then you had me slugged and him stole. I'm on to you,
D'Arcy. You think because you're a big shot and I'm just a common
sailorman, you can take what you want. But you ain't gettin' away
with it. You got Mike and you're goin' to give him back or I'll
tear your guts out. Where is he? Tell me before I choke it outa
you."</p>

<p>"Costigan, you're mad," snarled D'Arcy, kind of white. "Do you
know whom you're threatening? I've killed men for less than
that."</p>

<p>"You stole my dog!" I howled, so wild I hardly knowed what I was
doing.</p>

<p>"You're a liar," he rasped. Blind mad, I roared and crashed my
right to his jaw before he could move. He went down like a
slaughtered ox and laid still, blood trickling from the corner of
his mouth. I went for him to strangle him with my bare hands, but
all the club men closed in between us.</p>

<p>"Grab him," they yelled. "He's killed D'Arcy. He's drunk or
crazy. Hold him until we can get the police."</p>

<p>"Belay there," I roared, backing away with both fists cocked.
"Lemme see the man that'll grab me. I'll knock his brains down his
throat. When that rat comes to, tell him I ain't through with him,
not by a dam' sight. I'll get him if it's the last thing I do."</p>

<p>And I stepped through one of them French winders and strode away
cursing between my teeth. I walked for some time in a kind of red
mist, forgetting all about the fight at Ace's Arena, where I was
already due. Then I got a idee. I was fully intending to get ahold
of D'Arcy and choke the truth outa him, but they was no use trying
that now. I'd catch him outside his club some time that night.
Meanwhile, I thought of something else. I went into a saloon and
got a big piece of white paper and a pencil, and with much labor, I
printed out what I wanted to say. Then I went out and stuck it up
on a wooden lamp-post where folks couldst read it. It said:</p>

<p class="headline">I WILL PAY ANY MAN FIFTY DOLLARS ($50)<br>
THAT CAN FIND MY BULDOG MIKE<br>
WHICH WAS STOLE BY A LO-DOWN SCUNK.<br>
STEVE COSTIGAN.</p>

<p>I was standing there reading it to see that the words was
spelled right when a loafer said: "Mike stole? Too bad, Sailor. But
where you goin' to git the fifty to pay the reward? Everybody knows
you ain't got no money."</p>

<p>"That's right," I said. So I wrote down underneath the rest:</p>

<p class="headline">P.S. I AM GOING TO GET FIFTY DOLLARS<br>
FOR LICKING SOME MUTT AT ACE'S AREENER<br>
THAT IS WHERE THE REWARD MONEY IS COMING FROM.<br>
S. C.</p>

<p>I then went morosely along the street wondering where Mike was
and if he was being mistreated or anything. I moped into the Arena
and found Ace walking the floor and pulling his hair.</p>

<p>"Where you been?" he howled. "You realize you been keepin' the
crowd waitin' a hour? Get into them ring togs."</p>

<p>"Let 'em wait," I said sourly, setting down and pulling off my
shoes. "Ace, a yellow-livered son-of-a-skunk stole my dog."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" said Ace, pulling out his watch and looking at it.
"That's tough, Steve. Hustle up and get into the ring, willya? The
crowd's about ready to tear the joint down."</p>

<p>I climbed into my trunks and bathrobe and mosied up the aisle,
paying very little attention either to the hisses or cheers which
greeted my appearance. I clumb into the ring and looked around for
my opponent.</p>

<p>"Where's Grieson?" I asked Ace.</p>

<p>"'E 'asn't showed up yet," said the referee.</p>

<p>"Ye gods and little fishes!" howled Ace, tearing his hair.
"These bone-headed leather-pushers will drive me to a early doom.
Do they think a pummoter's got nothin' else to do but set around
all night and pacify a ragin' mob whilst they play around? These
thugs is goin' to lynch us all if we don't start some action right
away."</p>

<p>"Here he comes," said the referee as a bath-robed figger come
hurrying down the aisle. Ace scowled bitterly and held up his hands
to the frothing crowd.</p>

<p>"The long delayed main event," he said sourly. "Over in that
corner, Sailor Costigan of the <i>Sea Girl,</i> weight 190 pounds.
The mutt crawlin' through the ropes is 'Limey' Grieson, weight 189.
Get goin'&mdash;and I hope you both get knocked loop-legged."</p>

<p>The referee called us to the center of the ring for instructions
and Grieson glared at me, trying to scare me before the scrap
started&mdash;the conceited jassack. But I had other things on my
mind. I merely mechanically noted that he was about my
height&mdash;six feet&mdash;had a nasty sneering mouth and mean
black eyes, and had been in a street fight recent. He had a bruise
under one ear.</p>

<p>We went back to our corners and I said to the second Ace had
give me: "Bonehead, you ain't seen nothin' of nobody with my
bulldog, have you?"</p>

<p>"Naw, I ain't," he said, crawling through the ropes. "And
beside... Hey, look out."</p>

<p>I hadn't noticed the gong sounding and Grieson was in my corner
before I knowed what was happening. I ducked a slungshot right as I
turned and clinched, pushing him outa the corner before I broke. He
nailed me with a hard left hook to the head and I retaliated with a
left to the body, but it didn't have much enthusiasm behind it. I
had something else on my mind and my heart wasn't in the fight. I
kept unconsciously glancing over to my corner where Mike always
set, and when he wasn't there, I felt kinda lost and sick and
empty.</p>

<p>Limey soon seen I wasn't up to par and began forcing the fight,
shooting both hands to my head. I blocked and countered very
slouchily and the crowd, missing my rip-roaring attack, began to
murmur. Limey got too cocky and missed a looping right that had
everything he had behind it. He was wide open for a instant and I
mechanically ripped a left hook under his heart that made his knees
buckle, and he covered up and walked away from me in a hurry, with
me following in a sluggish kind of manner.</p>

<p>After that he was careful, not taking many chances. He jabbed me
plenty, but kept his right guard high and close in. I ignores left
jabs at all times, so though he was outpointing me plenty, he
wasn't hurting me none. But he finally let go his right again and
started the claret from my nose. That irritated me and I woke up
and doubled him over with a left hook to the guts which wowed the
crowd. But they yelled with rage and amazement when I failed to
foller up. To tell the truth, I was fighting very
absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>As I walked back to my corner at the end of the first round, the
crowd was growling and muttering restlessly, and the referee said:
"Fight, you blasted Yank, or I'll throw you h'out of the ring."
That was the first time I ever got a warning like that.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Sailor?" said Bonehead, waving the
towel industriously. "I ain't never seen you fight this way
before."</p>

<p>"I'm worried about Mike," I said. "Bonehead, where-all does
Philip D'Arcy hang out besides the European Club?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" he said. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I wanta catch him alone some place," I growled. "I
betcha&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's the gong, you mutt," yelled Bonehead, pushing me out of
my corner. "For cat's cake, get in there and FIGHT. I got five
bucks bet on you."</p>

<p>I wandered out into the middle of the ring and absent-mindedly
wiped Limey's chin with a right that dropped him on his all-fours.
He bounced up without a count, clearly addled, but just as I was
fixing to polish him off, I heard a racket at the door.</p>

<p>"Lemme in," somebody was squalling. "I gotta see Meest Costigan.
I got one fellow dog belong along him."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," I growled to Limey, and run over to the ropes,
to the astounded fury of the fans, who rose and roared.</p>

<p>"Let him in, Bat," I yelled and the feller at the door hollered
back: "Alright, Steve, here he comes."</p>

<p>And a Chinese kid come running up the aisle grinning like all
get-out, holding up a scrawny brindle bull-pup.</p>

<p>"Here that one fellow dog, Mees Costigan," he yelled.</p>

<p>"Aw heck," I said. "That ain't Mike. Mike's white. I thought
everybody in Singapore knowed Mike&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment I realized that the still groggy Grieson was
harassing me from the rear, so I turned around and give him my full
attention for a minute. I had him backed up ag'in' the ropes,
bombarding him with lefts and rights to the head and body, when I
heard Bat yell: "Here comes another'n, Steve."</p>

<p>"Pardon me a minute," I snapped to the reeling Limey, and run
over to the ropes just as a grinning coolie come running up the
aisle with a white dog which might of had three or four drops of
bulldog blood in him.</p>

<p>"Me catchum, boss," he chortled. "Heap fine white dawg. Me
catchum fifty dolla?"</p>

<p>"You catchum a kick in the pants," I roared with irritation.
"Blame it all, that ain't Mike."</p>

<p>At this moment Grieson, which had snuck up behind me, banged me
behind the ear with a right hander that made me see about a million
stars. This infuriated me so I turned and hit him in the belly so
hard I bent his back-bone. He curled up like a worm somebody'd
stepped on and while the referee was counting over him, the gong
ended the round.</p>

<p>They dragged Limey to his corner and started working on him.
Bonehead, he said to me: "What kind of a game is this, Sailor? Gee
whiz, that mutt can't stand up to you a minute if you was tryin'.
You shoulda stopped him in the first round. Hey, lookit there."</p>

<p>I glanced absent-mindedly over at the opposite corner and seen
that Limey's seconds had found it necessary to take off his right
glove in the process of reviving him. They was fumbling over his
bare hand.</p>

<p>"They're up to somethin' crooked," howled Bonehead. "I'm goin'
to appeal to the referee."</p>

<p>"Here comes some more mutts, Steve," bawled Bat and down the
aisle come a Chinese coolie, a Jap sailor, and a Hindoo, each with
a barking dog. The crowd had been seething with bewildered rage,
but this seemed to somehow hit 'em in the funny bone and they began
to whoop and yell and laugh like a passel of hyenas. The referee
was roaming around the ring cussing to hisself and Ace was jumping
up and down and tearing his hair.</p>

<p>"Is this a prize-fight or a dog-show," he howled. "You've rooint
my business. I'll be the laughin' stock of the town. I'll sue you,
Costigan."</p>

<p>"Catchum fine dawg, Meest' Costigan," shouted the Chinese,
holding up a squirming, yowling mutt which done its best to bite
me.</p>

<p>"You deluded heathen," I roared, "that ain't even a bull dog.
That's a chow."</p>

<p>"You clazee," he hollered. "Him fine blull dawg."</p>

<p>"Don't listen," said the Jap. "Him bull dog." And he held up one
of them pint-sized Boston bull-terriers.</p>

<p>"Not so," squalled the Hindoo. "Here is thee dog for you, sahib.
A pure blood Rampur hound. No dog can overtake him in thee
race&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ye gods!" I howled. "Is everybody crazy? I oughta knowed these
heathens couldn't understand my reward poster, but I
thought&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Look out, sailor,"</i> roared the crowd.</p>

<p>I hadn't heard the gong. Grieson had slipped up on me from
behind again, and I turned just in time to get nailed on the jaw by
a sweeping right-hander he started from the canvas. <i>Wham!</i>
The lights went out and I hit the canvas so hard it jolted some of
my senses back into me again.</p>

<p>I knowed, even then, that no ordinary gloved fist had slammed me
down that way. Limey's men hadst slipped a iron knuckle-duster on
his hand when they had his glove off. The referee sprung forward
with a gratified yelp and began counting over me. I writhed around,
trying to get up and kill Limey, but I felt like I was done. My
head was swimming, my jaw felt dead, and all the starch was gone
outa my legs. They felt like they was made outa taller.</p>

<p>My head reeled. And I could see stars over the horizon of
dogs.</p>

<p>"...Four..." said the referee above the yells of the crowd and
the despairing howls of Bonehead, who seen his five dollars fading
away. "...Five ... Six ... Seven..."</p>

<p>"There," said Limey, stepping back with a leer. "That's done
yer, yer blawsted Yank."</p>

<p><i>Snap!</i> went something in my head. That voice. Them same
words. Where'd I heard 'em before? In the black alley offa the
Tungen Road. A wave of red fury washed all the grogginess outa
me.</p>

<p>I forgot all about my taller legs. I come off the floor with a
roar which made the ring lights dance, and lunged at the horrified
Limey like a mad bull. He caught me with a straight left coming in,
but I didn't even check a instant. His arm bent and I was on top of
him and sunk my right mauler so deep into his ribs I felt his heart
throb under my fist. He turned green all over and crumbled to the
canvas like all his bones hadst turned to butter. The dazed referee
started to count, but I ripped off my gloves and pouncing on the
gasping warrior, I sunk my iron fingers into his throat.</p>

<p>"Where's Mike, you gutter rat?" I roared. "What'd you do with
him? Tell me, or I'll tear your windpipe out."</p>

<p>"'Ere, 'ere," squawked the referee. "You cawn't do that. Let go
of him, I say. Let go, you fiend."</p>

<p>He got me by the shoulders and tried to pull me off. Then,
seeing I wasn't even noticing his efforts, he started kicking me in
the ribs. With a wrathful beller, I rose up and caught him by the
nape of the neck and the seat of the britches and throwed him clean
through the ropes. Then I turned back on Limey.</p>

<p>"You Limehouse spawn," I bellered. "I'll choke the life outa
you."</p>

<p>"Easy, mate, easy," he gasped, green-tinted and sick. "I'll tell
yer. We stole the mutt? Fritz Steinmann wanted him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Steinmann?" I howled in amazement.</p>

<p>"He warnted a dorg to fight Ritchie's Terror," gasped Limey.
"Johnnie Blinn suggested he should 'ook your Mike. Johnnie hired me
and some strong-arms to turn the trick&mdash;Johnnie's gel wrote
you that note&mdash;but how'd you know I was into it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I oughta thought about Blinn," I raged. "The dirty rat. He
heard me and Porkey talkin' and got the idee. Where is Blinn?"</p>

<p>"Somewheres gettin' sewed up," gasped Grieson. "The dorg like to
tore him to ribbons afore we could get the brute into the bamboo
cage we had fixed."</p>

<p>"Where is Mike?" I roared, shaking him till his teeth
rattled.</p>

<p>"At Steinmann's, fightin' Terror," groaned Limey. "Ow,
lor'&mdash;I'm sick. I'm dyin'."</p>

<p>I riz up with a maddened beller and made for my corner. The
referee rose up outa the tangle of busted seats and cussing fans
and shook his fist at me with fire in his eye.</p>

<p>"Steve Costigan," he yelled. "You lose the blawsted fight on a
foul."</p>

<p>"So's your old man," I roared, grabbing my bathrobe from the
limp and gibbering Bonehead. And just at that instant a regular
bedlam bust loose at the ticket-door and Bat come down the aisle
like the devil was chasing him. And in behind him come a mob of
natives&mdash;coolies, 'ricksha boys, beggars, shopkeepers, boatmen
and I don't know what all&mdash;and every one of 'em had at least
one dog and some had as many as three or four. Such a horde of
chows, Pekineses, terriers, hounds and mongrels I never seen and
they was all barking and howling and fighting.</p>

<p>"Meest' Costigan," the heathens howled, charging down the
aisles: "You payum flifty dolla for dogs. We catchum."</p>

<p>The crowd rose and stampeded, trompling each other in their
flight and I jumped outa the ring and raced down the aisle to the
back exit with the whole mob about a jump behind me. I slammed the
door in their faces and rushed out onto the sidewalk, where the
passers-by screeched and scattered at the sight of what I reckon
they thought was a huge and much battered maniac running at large
in a red bathrobe. I paid no heed to 'em.</p>

<p>Somebody yelled at me in a familiar voice, but I rushed out into
the street and made a flying leap onto the running board of a
passing taxi. I ripped the door open and yelled to the horrified
driver: "Fritz Steinmann's place on Kang Street&mdash;and if you
ain't there within three minutes I'll break your neck."</p>

<p>We went careening through the streets and purty soon the driver
said: "Say, are you an escaped criminal? There's a car followin'
us."</p>

<p>"You drive," I yelled. "I don't care if they's a thousand cars
follerin' us. Likely it's a Chinaman with a pink Pomeranian he
wants to sell me for a white bull dog."</p>

<p>The driver stepped on it and when we pulled up in front of the
innocent-looking building which was Steinmann's secret arena, we'd
left the mysterious pursuer clean outa sight. I jumped out and
raced down a short flight of stairs which led from the street down
to a side entrance, clearing my decks for action by shedding my
bathrobe as I went. The door was shut and a burly black-jowled thug
was lounging outside. His eyes narrowed with surprise as he noted
my costume, but he bulged in front of me and growled: "Wait a
minute, you. Where do you think you're goin'?"</p>

<p>"In!" I gritted, ripping a terrible right to his unshaven
jaw.</p>

<p>Over his prostrate carcass I launched myself bodily against the
door, being in too much of a hurry to stop and see if it was
unlocked. It crashed in and through its ruins I catapulted into the
room.</p>

<p>It was a big basement. A crowd of men&mdash;the scrapings of the
waterfront&mdash;was ganged about a deep pit sunk in the concrete
floor from which come a low, terrible, worrying sound like dogs
growling through a mask of torn flesh and bloody hair&mdash;like
fighting dogs growl when they have their fangs sunk deep.</p>

<p>The fat Dutchman which owned the dive was just inside the door
and he whirled and went white as I crashed through. He threw up his
hands and screamed, just as I caught him with a clout that smashed
his nose and knocked six front teeth down his throat. Somebody
yelled: "Look out, boys! Here comes Costigan! He's on the
kill!"</p>

<p>The crowd yelled and scattered like chaff before a high wind as
I come ploughing through 'em like a typhoon, slugging right and
left and dropping a man at each blow. I was so crazy mad I didn't
care if I killed all of 'em. In a instant the brink of the pit was
deserted as the crowd stormed through the exits, and I jumped down
into the pit. Two dogs was there, a white one and a big brindle
one, though they was both so bloody you couldn't hardly tell their
original color. Both had been savagely punished, but Mike's jaws
had locked in the death-hold on Terror's throat and the brindle
dog's eyes was glazing.</p>

<p>Joe Ritchie was down on his knees working hard over them and his
face was the color of paste. They's only two ways you can break a
bull dog's death-grip; one is by deluging him with water till he's
half drowned and opens his mouth to breathe. The other'n is by
choking him off. Ritchie was trying that, but Mike had such a
bull's neck, Joe was only hurting his fingers.</p>

<p>"For gosh sake, Costigan," he gasped. "Get this white devil off.
He's killin' Terror."</p>

<p>"Sure I will," I grunted, stooping over the dogs. "Not for your
sake, but for the sake of a good game dog." And I slapped Mike on
the back and said: "Belay there, Mike; haul in your grapplin'
irons."</p>

<p>Mike let go and grinned up at me with his bloody mouth, wagging
his stump of a tail like all get-out and pricking up one ear.
Terror had clawed the other'n to rags. Ritchie picked up the
brindle bull and clumb outa the pit and I follered him with
Mike.</p>

<p>"You take that dog to where he can get medical attention and you
do it pronto," I growled. "He's a better man than you, any day in
the week, and more fittin' to live. Get outa my sight."</p>

<p>He slunk off and Steinmann come to on the floor and seen me and
crawled to the door on his all-fours before he dast to get up and
run, bleeding like a stuck hawg. I was looking over Mike's cuts and
gashes, when I realized that a man was standing nearby, watching
me.</p>

<p>I wheeled. It was Philip D'Arcy, with a blue bruise on his jaw
where I'd socked him, and his right hand inside his coat.</p>

<p>"D'Arcy," I said, walking up to him. "I reckon I done made a
mess of things. I just ain't got no sense when I lose my temper,
and I honestly thought you'd stole Mike. I ain't much on fancy
words and apologizin' won't do no good. But I always try to do what
seems right in my blunderin' blame-fool way, and if you wanta, you
can knock my head off and I won't raise a hand ag'in' you." And I
stuck out my jaw for him to sock.</p>

<p>He took his hand outa his coat and in it was a cocked
six-shooter.</p>

<p>"Costigan," he said, "no man ever struck me before and got away
with it. I came to Larnigan's Arena tonight to kill you. I was
waiting for you outside and when I saw you run out of the place and
jump into a taxi, I followed you to do the job wherever I caught up
with you. But I like you. You're a square-shooter. And a man who
thinks as much of his dog as you do is my idea of the right sort.
I'm putting this gun back where it belongs&mdash;and I'm willing to
shake hands and call it quits, if you are."</p>

<p>"More'n willin'," I said heartily. "You're a real gent." And we
shook. Then all at once he started laughing.</p>

<p>"I saw your poster," he said. "When I passed by, an Indian babu
was translating it to a crowd of natives and he was certainly
making a weird mess of it. The best he got out of it was that Steve
Costigan was buying dogs at fifty dollars apiece. You'll be hounded
by canine-peddlers as long as you're in port."</p>

<p>"The <i>Sea Girl's</i> due tomorrer, thank gosh," I replied.
"But right now I got to sew up some cuts on Mike."</p>

<p>"My car's outside," said D'Arcy. "Let's take him up to my rooms.
I've had quite a bit of practice at such things and we'll fix him
up ship-shape."</p>

<p>"It's a dirty deal he's had," I growled. "And when I catch
Johnnie Blinn I'm goin' kick his ears off. But," I added, swelling
out my chest seven or eight inches, "I don't reckon I'll have to
lick no more saps for sayin' that Ritchie's Terror is the champeen
of all fightin' dogs in the Asiatics. Mike and me is the
fightin'est pair of scrappers in the world."</p>
