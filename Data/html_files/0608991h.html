<h3><a name="I" id="I"></a><b>I</b></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Oct</span>. <i>21st</i>.&mdash;They have
told me to-day, with obvious reluctance, and in the kindest
fashion, that I am to go to-morrow to the house of a Dr.
Schreiber, in whose care I am to remain until I am restored to
health. Restored to health!&mdash;my God! I am as healthy a lad
of nineteen (I believe) as any one would wish to meet; certainly
I have no recollection of any illness beyond a dose of measles
when I was seven, and a very slight touch of scarlet fever a few
years ago. Restored to health!&mdash;no, that is merely their
kind way of putting it. What they really mean is: I am to go and
live with this Dr. Schreiber, whoever he may be, until he, and
they, and the doctors whom they have brought to see me so often
lately, think I am&mdash;<i>sane</i>.</p>

<p>That, of course, is the real truth. I have often wondered, as
I have grown up out of my lonely childhood towards manhood, how
strange it is that what seems so easy to the child about
truth-telling seems so difficult to the man&mdash;now I am
beginning to understand. All the same, it would have been much
more to my taste if my guardian and his wife had said to me,
"Angus, we're very, very sorry, but the doctors and we don't
think everything is as it should be with your intellect, and Dr.
Schreiber is a famous mental specialist, and&mdash;&mdash;" so
on.</p>

<p>But then&mdash;equally, of course&mdash;they couldn't have
said that to me if they really believe that I <i>am</i> mad. And
they <i>do. I</i> know&mdash;I have seen them not once, but a
thousand times since I came here to London from Alt-na-Shiel two
years ago (when shall I see it again, and the mists on the
mountains!), watching me as country folk watch the freaks at a
fair. There is a puzzled look which comes into their faces; their
brows knit, and their lips are slowly compressed, or pursed up,
and&mdash;if they think I do not see them&mdash;<i>they look at
each other and shake their heads and sigh</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot think of more than three things which should make
them believe me mad. One is that I am very fond of solitude,
liking to be left to myself as much as I can. Another is that I
think a great deal&mdash;just as I read a great deal&mdash;and
that I sometimes frown at my thoughts, sometimes smile at them,
sometimes laugh, long and loud, at them. Perhaps, when Major
Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy and I are alone after dinner, he reading
<i>The Times</i> and she busied with her knitting, behaviour of
this sort on my part may seem strange&mdash;it is only now
occurring to me that it <i>may</i>. Certainly I have seen the
Major drop his newspaper and jump&mdash;literally
<i>jump</i>&mdash;in his arm-chair when, thinking of something
that amused me, I have indulged in a sudden peal of
laughter&mdash;yet why should one not laugh whenever one sees or
thinks of something to laugh at? But I have found that a great
many of the people whom I have met in London only laugh when a
sort of signal is given. Those are two reasons. The only other
reason I can think of is that I have told them once or
twice&mdash;just as I told the doctors whom they have at times
brought to see me&mdash;that I can <i>see</i> things which, I
find out, most other people do not or cannot see. The first time
I told them, for instance, of the spirit which I have seen a
score or so of times at Alt-na-Shiel, they stared at me as if I
were telling them lies, and they both looked curiously
uncomfortable. Now, my old nurse, Margaret Lang, never looked
uncomfortable when I told her of these things, neither did Dugald
Graeme, my father's old body-servant. They seemed to realize and
to understand my meaning.</p>

<p>I have been thinking to-day (since I heard what my guardian
and his wife had to tell me&mdash;he, poor man, in his stiff
military-modelled sentences, and she more by tears than by words)
about my life as a child and afterwards as a boy. Alt-na-Shiel is
in one of the loneliest glens of the Strathern Mountains-a very
great way indeed from the railways. There my father&mdash;Angus
Maclntyre, like myself&mdash;went to live just after he was
married to my mother, and there my mother died just after I was
born. My father was a man of books, and after my mother's death
he thought of nothing but books. Margaret Lang&mdash;helped by
Dugald Graeme&mdash;brought me up, but after I was able to walk,
my real nurse and mother was the open air. I used to sit
out&mdash;anywhere&mdash;all day long, content to see the sky,
and hear the countryside sounds, and smell the heather and the
gorse and the bracken. And I cannot remember, looking back, when
it was that I did not see things that other people did not see. I
was never afraid of anything that I ever saw.</p>

<p>I have gone on <i>seeing</i> ever since&mdash;now, usually, at
long intervals. When I was seventeen my father died, and it was
found that Major Kennedy, a distant connection, was to be my
guardian, and that I was to live with him until my twenty-first
year. That is why I am now writing this in my journal in my own
room in Major Kennedy's house in Bayswater&mdash;and why I am
to-morrow to take up my residence with Dr. Schreiber at Wimbledon
Common. Possibly I am writing it because, for anything I know,
this may be my last day of complete liberty. I do not know what
the rules are in these private mad-houses&mdash;if this to which
I am going is such a place.</p>

<p>If I may speak frankly to myself in these pages, I must say
that I cannot see why I should be considered at all mentally
afflicted. I am, as things go, fairly well educated; fond as I am
of solitude, I am fond of games, especially of football, golf,
and tennis; I am certainly very strong in body, and of rude
health. And as for my appetite...</p>

<p>However, they say I suffer from occasional delusions. We shall
see.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="II" id="II"></a><b>II</b></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Oct</span>. <i>2nd</i>.&mdash;I came
here&mdash;to Dr. Schreiber's house&mdash;yesterday afternoon,
accompanied by Dr. Wilkinson, one of the two doctors who have
been to see me so often lately. The parting between the Kennedys
and myself made me think of the conventional descriptions of boys
going to school. Major Kennedy shook hands with me at least six
times, and Mrs. Kennedy cried. Dr. Wilkinson and I talked
football all the way from Bayswater to Wimbledon, and I found out
that he got his Blue at Oxford&mdash;I forget in what year.</p>

<p>Just before we got to Wimbledon Common I thought I would have
a little straightforward conversation with Dr. Wilkinson.</p>

<p>"Look here, sir," I said. "You, in common with Dr. Gordon and
Major and Mrs. Kennedy, think I am a little mad?"</p>

<p>"I think that a few months' residence with Dr. Schreiber will
turn you out as fit as a fiddle," he replied. "Why do most people
give an evasive answer when it would be much simpler to tell the
truth in one word?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Ah, why don't they?" he answered. "I've often wondered that
myself."</p>

<p>"Or, again," said I, "how is it that people who happen through
no fault of their own to possess a certain faculty, or certain
faculties, which other people&mdash;most people&mdash;do not
possess, are invariably considered to be&mdash;queer?"</p>

<p>He shook his head, and I relapsed into such a profound and
cogitative silence that at last he asked me what I was thinking
about.</p>

<p>"I was thinking, sir," I replied, "how admirably you would
have filled the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of those physicians of the
Middle Ages who, whenever powerful monarchs or statesmen wanted
to get rid of any person inimical to them, were ever ready to
testify to their madness and to enclose them within a dungeon or
an oubliette, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you'll not find Dr. Schreiber's place much of a
dungeon, my boy!" he said, laughing. "Here we are, so you can see
for yourself."</p>

<p>I got out of the brougham and looked about me. This house is
an old-fashioned structure of red brick, covered over with
climbing plants, and it stands in the midst of a bright green
lawn, the flower-beds and borderings of which are just now
cheerful with a profusion of autumn blooms. There is not a
suspicion of anything prison-like about it&mdash;on the contrary,
its appearance suggests freedom and liberty. My first glance at
it forced me to set up a comparison between it and Bayswater.</p>

<p>Dr. Schreiber came out to meet us. He is a youngish
man&mdash;perhaps thirty-five, perhaps forty&mdash;tall,
muscular, broad-shouldered, bronzed, cheery. I should have taken
him for one of the sweller sort of professional cricketers rather
than for what I was led to believe him&mdash;a private mad-house
keeper. He welcomed me in a very friendly way, and after Dr.
Wilkinson had gone volunteered to show me round the house and
grounds. I was somewhat astonished to find no one about, except
servants in the house and a gardener sweeping up fallen leaves on
the lawn.</p>

<p>"Where, sir," I asked, "are the rest of us?"</p>

<p>"The rest of whom?" he inquired, looking surprised.</p>

<p>"The rest of your other mad folk," I answered. "I am sent here
because they think me mad."</p>

<p>He laughed&mdash;burst, rather, into laughter&mdash;and
slapped my shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, hang all that, old chap!" he said. "There's no one here
but you, myself, my assistant, Pollard, who's a real good sort,
and the servants. You're as free as air here, and if I don't give
you a first-class time it won't be my fault."</p>

<p>Later we fell to talking about golf. To-day, after he had been
to visit his patients&mdash;he seems to have a pretty extensive
practice&mdash;we managed to get a full round in before dusk came
on. He beat me by two up and one to play.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="III" id="III"></a><b>III</b></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Oct</span>. <i>27th</i>.&mdash;I have been
very happy here so far&mdash;much happier, I believe&mdash;nay,
am sure, than I have ever been since I left Alt-na-Shiel. Life is
very pleasant in this house, and with Dr. Schreiber. He is very
different, I think, to all other men I have ever met. I have been
with him frequently to visit some of his poorer patients&mdash;it
seemed to me that he <i>laughs</i> them out of their complaints.
I do not mean that he laughs <i>at</i> them, but that his
cheeriness is infectious, and lifts them out of themselves. He is
certainly a great man&mdash;a big <i>human</i>.</p>

<p>Last night, after dinner, he and I were playing billiards, and
somehow&mdash;I do not know how&mdash;we reached the question of
what those other people call my delusion. We sat down&mdash;this
was the first time I had ever spoken of it to him&mdash;and I
told him of some things which I had seen&mdash;especially of the
ghost (if it is a ghost) of the parish clerk of Ardnashonach.
Instead of looking as if he could scarcely believe his ears (as
Major Kennedy looks), or shaking his head (as Dr. Wilkinson did),
he listened most intently, and asked me a lot of questions. Not
questions about myself, which is what I detest, but sensible
questions.</p>

<p>"And they aren't delusions, you know," I said at the end. "I
<i>have</i> seen these things&mdash;<i>seen</i> them! You believe
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I do. Look here&mdash;if you ever <i>see</i>
anything while you're here, just come that minute and tell me.
Now, then, we've time for another hundred before bed."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov.</span> <i>4th</i>.&mdash;I have been
examining this old house inside and out with some interest since
Dr. Schreiber told me, a day or two ago, that it was once (a
century or more ago) the residence of a famous statesman. It is,
I think, Early Georgian, and has the most delightful rooms, many
of which are panelled in oak to a considerable height. There is
one, now used as a dining-room, but formerly the library, which
attracts me more than all the rest. It has four high narrow
windows overlooking the garden, and with its quaint old oak
furniture (which Dr. Schreiber took over from his predecessor in
the practice, a man named Turrell, who was, he says, one of the
cleverest men of his day) it makes a picture of colour and
distinction. There is an old oak long settle near the deep
fireplace in which I shall love to sit when the winter really
settles in&mdash;if it ever does in this soft-aired, sunny south,
so different to the far-away north.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov.</span> <i>17th</i>.&mdash;Something
has happened.</p>

<p>That seems a trite enough thing to write down, but the three
words, after all, mean much, followed by an explanation. The
truth is, my curious sense (extra sense, I suppose), has
manifested itself again. I believe the last time was five years
ago, when I saw the fairies near the church of Dalnarossie.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, about five o'clock, Dr. Schreiber having
gone to London, and Mr. Pollard to visit a patient across the
Common, I was alone in the dining-room, and sitting in the corner
of the long settle. There was no light in the room except that of
the fire, which had burnt itself down to that clear glow which
fires get on sharp, frosty afternoons of late autumn. I had spent
most of the time since lunch reading a curious old book which I
had found in Dr. Schreiber's study the day before, and was
leaning back against the cushions of the long settle with my eyes
closed&mdash;thinking of what I had read, and enjoying the quiet
of the shadowy, scarcely-lighted room&mdash;when I suddenly
<i>felt</i> that I was not alone. The feeling was so strong, so
acute, that for a full minute I remained quiescent. At last I
opened my eyes, knowing without doubt that I was going to see
something.</p>

<p>What I saw was this:</p>

<p>There stood upon the big, square hearthrug, within a few feet
of me, a young man whom I judged to be of about my own
age&mdash;perhaps a little older. He was tall, he stooped
slightly, and he was spare of figure. His attire was
modern&mdash;a black morning coat and vest and dark, striped
trousers&mdash;and he stood with his hands in his pockets, after
the fashion affected by Eton boys&mdash;somewhat slouchingly. His
head was bent forward, and at first I could not see his face, but
he presently turned a little, and the glow of the fire fell on
it. I knew then that I was regarding a ghost.</p>

<p>The face confirmed me in my belief that this was&mdash;had
been, I should say&mdash;a young man of say, nineteen years of
age. It was a sad, uneasy face&mdash;a face whereon were many
signs of anxiety, trouble, perplexity&mdash;and it was curiously
<i>old</i>. It was not a strong face&mdash;the chin was small and
delicate; the mouth amiable, but weak; the eyes, big and blue,
were the eyes of a child&mdash;and there was a frightened
expression in them.</p>

<p>I sat perfectly still, watching. The figure remained in an
irresolute position&mdash;fidgeting on the hearthrug for a minute
or so&mdash;then it walked slowly to the window, stood looking
out into the garden awhile, then came back to the hearthrug,
lingered there a minute more, and finally crossed the room and
opened the door. I followed it through the doorway on the
instant; the servants had already lighted the hall lamp, and the
hall was clearly illuminated. And the hall was empty. There was
no figure there.</p>

<p>I told Dr. Schreiber all this after we had finished our usual
game of billiards last night. He listened with the gravest
attention to everything I said, and when I had finished merely
remarked:</p>

<p>"Angus, if you should ever see this apparition, or whatever it
may be, again, do not be afraid to tell me at once."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov.</span> <i>22nd</i>.&mdash;I have seen
the ghost of the young man again.</p>

<p>This afternoon I went out to stroll about the neighbourhood,
and in the course of my wanderings turned into Wimbledon
churchyard. I was walking aimlessly about the paths, looking at
the tombstones and wondering if they had any unusual names or
quaint epitaphs upon them, when I suddenly saw the apparition
again, standing at the side of a grave which lay at the chancel
end of the church. It was attired exactly as before, and stood in
a similar fashion, slightly slouching, with its hands in the
pockets of its trousers. The face was just as sad and troubled as
ever, and had the same air of perplexity. The big, blue, childish
eyes turned from the grave to the headstone, and from the
headstone to the grave, as if trying to read something on the one
or to see something on the other. Then they stared all round the
churchyard&mdash;wonderingly.</p>

<p>I drew nearer, and looked at the inscription on the tombstone
by which the ghost stood&mdash;in fact, I approached to within a
few feet of the ghost itself. It seemed to me that it saw
me&mdash;but only looked at me in the casual, uninterested way in
which strangers regard each other.</p>

<p>The inscription was short and simple:</p>

<blockquote>Here lieth the body of Major-General Sir Arthur
Debenham, K.C.B.; born January 15th, 1831; died October 4th,
1892. Also that of Florence Georgiana, his wife; born September
12th, 1834; died February 7th, 1893. Also in memory of their only
child, Everard; born August 12th, 1874; died July 20th, 1893, at
Hudiksvall, Sweden, where he is interred.</blockquote>

<p>When I looked round again the apparition had disappeared.</p>

<p>I came straight back to Dr. Schreiber's house, and happened to
catch him just coming in. After I had told him of this second
appearance he remained silent for some time, and at last, without
making any comment, asked me to go with him into the garden. He
approached the gardener, an oldish man, who was at work there
before Dr. Schreiber took over the practice.</p>

<p>"Gregson," he said, "you've lived a long time about here,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Man and boy, five-and-fifty years, sir," replied Gregson.</p>

<p>"Did you ever know Major-General Sir Arthur Debenham?"</p>

<p>"Know the old General, sir? I should think I did!&mdash;why,
he lived not half a mile from here. I knew 'em all. Why, the
young gentleman, poor Mr. Everard, he lived here in this very
house with your predecessor, Dr. Turrell, for some months after
Lady Debenham died. Dr. Turrell and him was a-travelling on the
Continent when Mr. Everard died, sir."</p>

<p>"What was the matter with him&mdash;with Mr. Everard?"</p>

<p>"Matter, sir? Why, what I calls a galloping consumption. He
was a weak, white-faced lad always, and he got a deal worse after
he came to live with the doctor. That was why they went to
foreign parts&mdash;to see if it would do him any good."</p>

<p>"Why did he come to live with Dr. Turrell&mdash;had he no
relations of his own that he could go to?"?</p>

<p>"They did say, sir, that he'd neither kith nor kin. Dr.
Turrell had been the old General's doctor, and Lady Debenham's
too&mdash;he was about the only friend they had hereabouts, sir.
They were a bit queer, the old gentleman and his
wife&mdash;eccentric, as they term it."</p>

<p>"Was the General rich?"</p>

<p>Gregson scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say he was a warm man, sir&mdash;always
considered to be so, anyway. Kept his carriage, and so on," he
answered.</p>

<p>After a few more questions we went away. But I have since been
asking more questions of Gregson and of the housekeeper. Their
description of Everard Debenham is that of the apparition of the
young man whose ghost I have now seen on two occasions.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nov.</span> <i>28th</i>.&mdash;I think
that even Major Kennedy will now believe that I possess some
curious power of seeing the usually unseen.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, at two o'clock, Dr. Schreiber, Mr.
Pollard, and myself were lunching in the dining-room when I
suddenly saw the ghost enter. It came in very quietly&mdash;in
its usual half-slouching attitude, and immediately upon entering
the room halted and stood looking about it in an irresolute
manner. The expression of the face was, if anything, more anxious
than ever, and the eyes were almost miserable in their
perplexity.</p>

<p>My companions saw me lay down my knife and fork and look
towards the door with a fixed expression.</p>

<p>"What is it, Angus?" inquired Dr. Schreiber.</p>

<p>"It is here again," I answered, knowing that Mr. Pollard was
by this time acquainted with the matter.</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Standing between you and the door. It looks as if it did not
know where to go, or what to do, or as if it were seeking
somebody or something."</p>

<p>"Watch it closely, then, and tell us what happens."</p>

<p>Then I began to report the ghost's movements to them.</p>

<p>"It has walked over to the window and is standing there,
looking out into the garden ... now it has come to the hearthrug,
and is staring into the fire ... and now it is going out of the
room again...."</p>

<p>"Follow it," said Dr. Schreiber. The three of us left the
table and followed the ghost out of the room. This time it did
not disappear&mdash;instead, it turned to the right along the
hall and went into Dr. Schreiber's study.</p>

<p>"What is it doing?" asked the doctor, when we got within.</p>

<p>"It is standing in front of your desk, looking at your
writing-chair. It seems more perplexed than ever. Now it has gone
round to the hearth and is looking all along the mantelpiece as
if it wanted to find something ... now it is leaving the
room.</p>

<p>"Follow it."</p>

<p>The ghost went out through the hall into the garden&mdash;we
three close upon its heels. It stood on the step outside the door
for a moment, looking very dejected; then moved slowly away
across the garden and walked round the lawn in the centre once or
twice. It now slouched more than ever, and its head hung forward
as if it were in trouble or pain. Suddenly it turned away by a
side path towards a part of the garden given up to trees and
shrubs. I described its further movements to my companions.</p>

<p>"It is walking up that little path which leads to the
summer-house ... now it has entered the summer-house ... it is
standing there looking just as lost, perplexed, troubled as ever
... now it ... ah!"</p>

<p>"What do you see, Angus?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"It has gone&mdash;disappeared," I replied.</p>

<p>We turned back to the house.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, Pollard?" said Dr. Schreiber.</p>

<p>"Queer!" replied Mr. Pollard.</p>

<p>Nobody said anything more just then, and very soon afterwards
the two doctors went out together. An hour later they returned
with a carpenter and his assistant and a couple of men who looked
like navvies. Dr. Schreiber asked me to come with them, and then
led the way to the summer-house. When we arrived there he
addressed the carpenter.</p>

<p>"I want the floor of this place removed, and the soil beneath
excavated until I tell the men to stop," he said. "Do it at
once."</p>

<p>It did not take much time for the carpenter and his men to
take up the floor, which was formed of squares of pine wood,
easily detachable.</p>

<p>Then the men began to dig.</p>

<p>There is no necessity to write down the details of this
gruesome search. We found the body of the young man whose ghost I
had seen so many times. It was dressed just as the ghost was
dressed. Gregson at once identified it as that of Evererd
Debenham.</p>

<p>Dr. Schreiber has communicated with the Home Office, the
police, and the coroner.</p>

coroner's inquest is just over. The expert from the Home Office,
a famous doctor, says that Everard Debenham was poisoned, and the
jury have returned a verdict of wilful murder against Dr.
Turrell, to whom, it seems, all General Debenham's estate was
left in the event of Everard's death if that took place previous
to his marriage and the birth of children. We hear that Dr.
Turrell has been arrested at Edinburgh, where he had gone to live
after selling his practice to Dr. Schreiber.</p>

21<i>st.</i>&mdash;<i>Alassio, Italy</i>.&mdash;On arriving here
this afternoon we found the English newspapers, and learnt from
them that Dr. Turrell was hanged at Wandsworth Gaol last week,
and that he left a full confession. There are also articles
commenting upon the strange circumstances under which the crime
was discovered.</p>

<p>But there was nothing strange about them to me.</p>
