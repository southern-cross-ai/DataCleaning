<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">I DON'T have to have a man tell me he craves war.
I can tell it by the set of his jaw, the glare in his eyes. So,
when Sven Larson raised his huge frame on his bunk and accused me
of swiping his tobaccer, I knowed very well what his idee was. But
I didn't want to fight Sven. Havin' licked the big cheese three or
four times already, I seen no need in mauling him any more. So
somewhat to the surprise of the rest of the crew, I said:</p>

<p>"Sven, that's purty crude. You didn't need to think up no lie to
pick a fight with me. I know you crave to be champion of the <i>Sea
Girl,</i> but they ain't a chance, and I don't want to hurt
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>I got no further, because with a bull's beller he heaved hisself
offa his bunk and come for me like a wild man. Gosh, what a
familiar scene that was&mdash;the fierce, hard faces ringing us,
the rough bunks along the wall, the dim light of the lantern
swinging overhead, and me standing in the middle, barefooted and
stripped to the waist, holding my only title against all comers!
They ain't a inch of that forecastle floor that I ain't reddened
with my blood. They ain't a edge of a upper bunk that I ain't had
my head smashed against. And since I been a man grown they ain't a
sailor on the Seven Seas that can say he stood up to me in that
forecastle and beat me down.</p>

<p>The lurching of the ship and the unsteady footing don't bother
me none, nor the close space and foul, smoke-laden air. That's my
element, and if I couldst fight in the ring like I can in the
forecastle, with nothing barred, I'd be champion of something
besides a tramp wind-jammer.</p>

<p>Well, Sven come at me with his old style&mdash;straight up, wide
open, with a wild swinging right. I ducked inside it and smashed my
left under his heart, following instantly with a blasting right
hook to the jaw as he sagged. He started falling and a lurch of the
ship throwed him half under a opposite bunk. They's no mercy ast,
give or expected in a forecastle fight; it's always to the finish.
I was right after him, and no sooner hadst he got to his feet than
I smashed him down again before he could get his hands up.</p>

<p>"Let's call it a day, Sven," I growled. "I don't want to punch
you no more."</p>

<p>But he come weaving up, spitting blood and roaring in his own
tongue. He tried to clinch and gouge, but another right hook to the
jaw sent him down and out. I shook the sweat outa my eyes and
glared down at him in some irritation, which was mixed with the
satisfaction of knowing that again I hadst proved my right to the
title of champion of the toughest ship afloat. Maybe you think
that's a mighty small thing, but it's the only title I got and I'm
proud of it.</p>

<p>But I couldn't get onto Sven. Me and him was good friends
ordinarily, but ever so often he'd get the idee he couldst lick me.
So the next day I looked him up between watches and found him
sulking and brooding. I looked over his enormous frame and shook my
head in wonder to think that I hadst gotten no further in the
legitimate ring than I have, when I can lay out such incredible
monsters as Sven so easy.</p>

<p>Six feet four he was in his socks, and his two hundred and
forty-five pounds was all muscle. I can bend coins between my
fingers, tear up decks of cards and twist horseshoes in two, but
Sven's so much stronger'n me they's no comparison. But size and
strength ain't everything.</p>

<p>"Sven," said I, "how come you forever got to be fightin'
me?"</p>

<p>Well, at first he wouldn't say, but at last it come out.</p>

<p>"Aye bane got girl at Stockholm. She bane like me purty good,
but they bane another faller. His name bane Olaf Ericson and he own
fishing smack. Always when Aye go out with my girl, he bane yump on
me and he always lick me. Aye tank if Aye ever lick you, Aye can
lick Olaf."</p>

<p>"So you practice on me, hey?" I said. "Well, Sven, you never
will lick me nor Olaf nor any man which can use his hands unless
you change your style. Oh, uh course, you're a bear-cat when it
comes to fightin' ignorant dock-wallopers and deck-hands which
never seen a glove and can't do nothin' but bite and gouge. But you
see what happens when you get up against a real fightin' man.
Sven," said I on a sudden impulse, like I usually do, "far be it
from me to see a deep water seaman get beat up regular by a Baltic
fish-grabber. It's a reflection on the profession and on the ship.
Sven," said I, "I'm goin' to train you to lick this big
cheese."</p>

<p>Well, I hadn't never give much thought to Sven before, only in a
general way&mdash;you can't pay close attention to every
square-head which comes and goes aboard a trading ship&mdash;but in
the weeks which followed I done my best to make a fighting man of
him. I rigged up a punching bag for him and sparred with him
between watches. When him or me wasn't doing our trick at the wheel
or holystoning the deck, or scraping the cable or hauling on a
rope, or trimming sail or exchanging insults with the mates, I
tried to teach him all I knowed.</p>

<p>Understand, I didn't try to make no boxing wizard outa him. The
big slob couldn't of learned even if I could of taught him. And I
didn't know how myself. I ain't a clever boxer. I'm a rough and
willing mixer in the ring, but compared to such rough-house
scrappers as Sven, I'm a wonder. The simple ducking, slipping and
blocking, which even the crudest slugger does in the ring, is
beyond the ken of the average untrained man, and as for scientific
hitting, they never heard of it. They just draw back the right and
let it go without any aim, timing nor nothing. Well, I just taught
Sven the fundamentals&mdash;to stand with his left foot forward and
not get his legs crossed, to lead with his left and to time and aim
a little. I got him outa the habit of swinging wild and wide open
with his right all the time, and by constant drilling I taught him
the knack of hooking and hitting straight. I also give him a lot of
training to harden his body muscles, which was his weak spot.</p>

<p>Well, the big Swede took to it like a duck takes to water, and
after I'd explained each simple move upwards of a thousand times,
he'd understand it and apply it and he wouldn't forget. Like lots
of square-heads, he was slow to learn, but once he had learned, he
remembered what he'd learned. And his great size and strength was a
big asset.</p>

<p>Bill O'Brien says, "Steve, you're trainin' the big sap to take
your title away from you." But I merely laughed with great
merriment at the idee.</p>

<p>Sven had a wallop like a mule's kick in either hand, and when he
learned to use it, he was dangerous to any man. He was pretty
tough, too, or got so before I got through with him. He wasn't very
fast, and I taught him a kind of deep defensive crouch like
Jeffries used. He took to it natural and developed a surprising
left for the body.</p>

<p>After six months of hard work on him, I felt sure that he could
lick the average alley-fighter easy. And about this time we was
cruising Baltic waters and headed for Stockholm.</p>

<p>As we approached his native heath, Sven grew impatient and
restless. He had a lot more self-confidence now and he craved
another chance at Olaf, the demon rival. Sven wasn't just a big
unwieldy slob no more. Constant sparring with me and Bill O'Brien
had taught him how to handle hisself and how to use his bulk and
strength. A few days outa Stockholm he had a row with Mushy Hansen,
which was two hundred pounds of fighting man, and he knocked the
Dane so cold it took us a hour and a half to bring him to.</p>

<p>Well, that cheered Sven up considerable and when we docked, he
said to me: "Aye go see Segrida, my girl, and find out if Olaf bane
in port. He bane hang out at dey Fisherman's Tavern. Aye go past
with Segrida and he come out and yump on me, like usual. Only diss
time Aye bane lick him."</p>

<p>Well, at the appointed time me and Bill and Mushy was loafing
around the Fisherman's Tavern, a kind of bar where a lot of tough
Swedish fishermen hung out, and pretty soon, along come Sven.</p>

<p>He had his girl with him, all right, a fine, big blonde
girl&mdash;one of these tall, slender yet well-built girls which is
overflowing with health and vitality. She was so pretty I was plumb
astounded as to what she seen in a big boob like Sven. But women is
that way. They fall for the dubs and pass up the real
prizes&mdash;like me, for instance.</p>

<p>Segrida looked kind of worried just now and as they neared the
Tavern, she cast a apprehensive eye that way. Well, they was
abreast of the door when a kind of irritated roar sounded from
within and out bulged what could of been nobody but Olaf the
Menace, hisself, in person.</p>

<p>There was a man for you! He was fully as tall as Sven, though
not as heavy. Tall, lithe and powerful he was, like a big, blond
tiger. He was so handsome I couldst easily see why Segrida
hesitated between him and Sven&mdash;or rather I couldn't see why
she hesitated at all! Olaf looked like one of these here Vikings
you read about which rampaged around in old times, licking
everybody. But he had a hard, cruel eye, which I reckon goes with
that kind of nature.</p>

<p>He had some fellers with him, but they stayed back in the
doorway while he swaggered out and stopped square in front of Sven.
He had a most contemptuous sneer and he said something which of
course I couldn't understand, but as Mushy later translated the
conversation to me, I'll give it like Mushy told to me and
Bill.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Olaf, "looking for another licking, eh? Your
deep sea boy friend is back in port looking for his usual
trouncing, eh, Segrida?"</p>

<p>"Olaf, please," said Segrida, frightened. "Don't fight,
please!"</p>

<p>"I warned you what would happen to him," said Olaf, "if you went
out with him&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment Sven, who had said nothing, shocked his bold
rival by growling: "Too much talk; put up your hands!"</p>

<p>Olaf, though surprised, immediately done so, and cut Sven's lip
with a flashing straight left before the big boy couldst get in
position. Segrida screamed but no cops was in sight and the battle
was on.</p>

<p>Olaf had learned boxing some place, and was one of the fastest
men for his size I ever seen. For the first few seconds he
plastered Sven plenty, but from the way the big fellow hunched his
shoulders and surged in, I hadst no doubt about the outcome.</p>

<p>Sven dropped into the deep, defensive crouch I'd taught him, and
I seen Olaf was puzzled. He hisself fought in the straight-up
English sparring position and this was the first time he'd ever met
a man who fought American style, I could see. With Sven's crouch
protecting his body and his big right arm curved around his jaw,
all Olaf couldst see to hit was his eyes glaring over the arm.</p>

<p>He battered away futilely at Sven's hard head, doing no damage
whatever, and then Sven waded in and drove his ponderous left to
the wrist in Olaf's midriff. Olaf gasped, went white, swayed and
shook like a leaf. He sure couldn't take it there and I yelled for
Sven to hit him again in the same place, but the big dumb-bell
tried a heavy swing for the jaw, half straightening out of his
crouch as he swung and Olaf ducked and staggered him with a
sizzling right to the ear. Sven immediately went back into his
shell and planted another battering-ram left under Olaf's
heart.</p>

<p>Olaf broke ground gasping and his knees trembling, but Sven kept
right on top of him in his plodding sort of way. Olaf jarred him
with a dying-effort swing to the jaw, but them months of punching
hadst toughened Sven and the big fellow shook his head and leaned
on a right to the ribs.</p>

<p>That finished Olaf; his knees give way and he started falling,
grabbing feebly at Sven as he done so. But Sven, with one of the
few laughs I ever heard him give, pushed him away and crashed a
tremendous right-hander to his jaw. Olaf straightened out on the
board-walk and he didn't even quiver.</p>

<p>A low rumble of fury warned us and we turned to see Olaf's
amazed but wrathful cronies surging towards the victor. But me and
Bill and Mushy and Mike kind of drifted in between and at the sight
of three hard-eyed American seamen and a harder-eyed Irish bulldog,
they stopped short and signified their intention of merely taking
Olaf into the Tavern and bringing him to.</p>

<p>At this Sven, grinning placidly and turning to Segrida with open
arms, got the shock of his life. Instead of falling on to his manly
bosom, Segrida, who hadst stood there like she was froze, woke up
all at once and bust into a perfect torrent of speech. I would of
give a lot to understand it. Sven stood gaping with his mouth wide
open and even the rescue party which had picked up Olaf, stood
listening. Then with one grand burst of oratory, she handed Sven a
full-armed, open-handed slap that cracked like a bull-whip, and
busting into tears, she run forward to help with Olaf. They
vanished inside the Tavern.</p>

<p>"What'd she say? What's the idee?" I asked, burnt up with
curiosity.</p>

<p>"She say she bane through with me," Sven answered dazedly. "She
say Aye bane a brute. She say she ain't bane want to see me no
more."</p>

<p>"Well, keel-haul me," said I profanely. "Can ya beat that? First
she wouldn't choose Sven because he got licked by Olaf all the
time; now she won't have him because he licked Olaf. Women are all
crazy."</p>

<p>"Never mind, old timer," said Bill, slapping the dejected Sven
on the back. "Anyway, you licked Olaf to a fare-you-well. Come
along, and we'll buy you a drink."</p>

<p>But Sven just shook his head sullen-like and moped off by
hisself; so after arguing with him unsuccessfully, me and Bill and
Mushy betook ourselves to a place where we couldst get some real
whiskey and not the stuff they make in them Scandinavian countries.
The barkeep kicked at first because I give my white bulldog, Mike,
a pan-full of beer on the floor, but we overcome that objection and
fell to talking about Sven.</p>

<p>"I don't savvy dames," I said. "If she gives Sven the bounce for
beatin' up Olaf, whyn't she give Olaf the bounce long ago for
beatin' up Sven so much?"</p>

<p>"It's Olaf she really loves," said Mushy.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Bill. "And maybe he's just persistent. But women
is kind- hearted. They pities a poor boob which has just got
punched in the nose, and as long as Sven was gettin' licked all the
time, he got all her pity. But now her pity and affections is
transferred to Olaf, naturally."</p>

<p>Well, we didn't see no more of Sven till kind of late that
night, when in come one of our square-head ship-mates named Fritz
to the bar where me and Bill and Mushy was, and said he: "Steve,
Sven he say maybeso you bane come down to a place on Hjolmer
Street; he bane got something to show you."</p>

<p>"Now what could that Swede want now?" said Bill testily, but I
said, "Oh well, we got nothin' else to do." So we went to Hjolmer
Street, a kind of narrow street just out of the waterfront section.
It wasn't no particularly genteel place&mdash;kind of dirty and
dingy for a Swedish street, with little crumby shops along the way,
all closed up and deserted that time of night. The square-head,
Fritz, led us to a place which was lighted up, though the shutters
was closed. He knocked on the door and a short fat Swede opened it
and closed it behind us.</p>

<p>To my surprise I seen the place was a kind of third-rate
gymnasium. They was a decrepit punching bag, a horizontal bar and a
lot of bar-bells, dumb-bells, kettle bells&mdash;in fact, all the
lifting weights you couldst imagine. They was also a rastling mat
and, in the middle of the floor, a canvas covered space about the
size of a small ring. And in the middle of this stood Sven, in
fighting togs and with his hands taped.</p>

<p>"Who you goin' to fight, Sven?" I asked curiously.</p>

<p>He scowled slightly, flexed his mighty arms kind of
embarrassed-like, swelled out his barrel chest and said: "You!"</p>

<p>You could of bowled me over with a jib boom.</p>

<p>"Me?" I said in amazement. "What kind of joke is this?"</p>

<p>"It bane no yoke," he answered stolidly. "Mine friend Knut bane
own diss gym and teach rastlin' and weight liftin'. He bane let us
fight here."</p>

<p>Knut, a stocky Swede with the massive arms and pot belly of a
retired weight lifter, give me a kind of apologetic look, but I
glared at him.</p>

<p>"But what you want to fight me for?" I snarled in perplexity.
"Ain't I taught you all you know? Didn't I teach you to lick Olaf?
You ungrateful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye ain't got no grudge for you, Steve," the big cheese
answered placidly. "But Aye tank Aye like be champion of dass
<i>Sea Girl.</i> Aye got to lick you to be it, ain't it? Sure!"</p>

<p>Bill and Mushy was looking at me expectantly, but I was all at
sea. After you've worked six months teaching a man your trade and
built him up and made something outa him, you don't want to undo it
all by rocking him to sleep.</p>

<p>"Why're you so set on bein' champ of the <i>Sea Girl</i>?" I
asked irritably.</p>

<p>"Well," said the overgrown heathen, "Aye tank Aye lick you and
then Aye can lick Olaf, and Segrida she like me. But Aye lick Olaf,
and Segrida she give me dass gate. Dass bane your fault, for teach
me to lick Olaf. But Aye ain't blame you. Aye like you fine, Steve,
but now Aye tank Aye be champ of dass <i>Sea Girl.</i> Aye ain't
got no girl no more, so Aye got to be something. Aye lick Olaf so
Aye can lick you. Aye lick you and be champ and we be good friends,
ya?"</p>

<p>"But I don't want to fight you, you big mutton-head!" I snarled
in wrathful perplexity.</p>

<p>"Then Aye fight you on the street or the fo'c's'le or wherever
Aye meet you," he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>At that my small stock of temper was plumb exhausted. With a
blood thirsty howl I ripped off my shirt. "Bring on the gloves, you
square-headed ape!" I roared. "If I got to batter some sense into
your solid ivory skull I might as well start now!"</p>

<p>A few minutes later I was clad in a dingy pair of trunks which
Knut dragged out of somewhere for me, and we was donning the gloves
a set lighter than the standard weight, which Knut hadst probably
got as a present from John L. Sullivan or somebody.</p>

<p>We agreed on Bill as referee, but Sven being afraid of Mike,
made me agree to have Mushy hold him, though I assured him Mike
wouldn't interfere in a glove fight. They was no ropes around the
canvas space, no stools nor gong. However, as it happened, they
wasn't needed.</p>

<p>As we advanced toward each other I realized more'n ever how much
of a man Sven was. Six feet four&mdash;245 pounds&mdash;all bone
and muscle. He towered over me like a giant, and I musta looked
kinda small beside him, though I'm six feet tall and weigh 190
pounds. Under his white skin the great muscles rolled and billowed
like flexible iron, and his chest looked more like a gorilla's than
a human's.</p>

<p>But size ain't everything. Old Fitz used to flatten men which
outweighed him over a hundred pounds, and lookit what Dempsey and
Sharkey used to do to such like giants&mdash;and I'm as tough as
Sharkey and can hit as hard as either of them other palookas, even
if I ain't quite as accurate or scientific.</p>

<p>No, I hadst no worries about Sven, but I'd got over being mad at
him and I seen his point of view. Sven wasn't sore at me, nor
nothing. He just wanted to be champ of his ship, which was a
natural wish. Since his girl give him the air, he wanted to more'n
ever to kind of soothe his wounded vanity, as they say.</p>

<p>No, I cooled down and kind of sympathized with Sven's point of
view which is a bad state of mind to enter into any kind of a
scrap. They ain't nothing more helpful than a good righteous anger
and a feeling like the other bird is a complete rascal and
absolutely in the wrong.</p>

<p>As we come together, Sven said: "No rounds, Steve; we fight to
dass finish, yes?"</p>

<p>"All right," I said with very little enthusiasm. "But, Sven, for
the last time&mdash;have you just got to fight me?"</p>

<p>His reply was a left which he shot for my jaw so sudden like I
just barely managed to slip it. I come back with a slashing right
which he blocked, clumsy but effective. He then dropped into the
deep crouch I'd taught him and rammed his left for my wind. But I
knowed the counter to that, having seen pictures of the second
Fitzsimmons-Jeffries riot. I stepped around and inside his ramming
left, slapping a left uppercut inside the crook of his right arm,
to his jaw, cracking his teeth together and rocking his head up and
back for a right hook which I opened a gash on his temple with.</p>

<p>He give a deafening roar and immediately abandoned his defensive
posture and come for me like a mad bull. I figured, here's where I
end this scrap quick, like always. But in half a second I seen my
error.</p>

<p>Sven didn't rush wide open, flailing wild, like he used to. He
come plunging in, bunched in a compact bulk of iron muscles and
fighting fury; he hooked and hit straight, and he kept his chin
clamped down on his hairy chest and his shoulders hunched to guard
it, half crouching to protect his body. Even the rudiments of
boxing science he'd learned, coupled with his enormous size and
strength made him plenty formidable to any man.</p>

<p>I don't know how to tin-can and back pedal. If Jeffries hisself
was to rush me, all I'd know to do wouldst be to stand up to him
and trade punches until I went out cold. I met Sven with a right
smash that was high, but stopped him in his tracks. Blood spattered
and he swayed like a big tree about to crash, but before I could
follow up, he plunged in again, hitting with both hands. He hit and
he hit&mdash;and&mdash;he&mdash;hit!</p>

<p>He throwed both hands as fast as he could drive one after the
other and every blow had all his weight behind it. Outa the depths
of his fighting fit he'd conjured up amazing speed. It happens some
time. I never seen a man his size hit that fast before or since. It
was just like being in a rain of sledge-hammers that never quit
coming. All I couldst see was his glaring eyes, his big shoulders
hunched and rocking as he hit&mdash;and a perfect whirlwind of big
glove-covered clubs.</p>

<p>He wasn't timing or aiming much&mdash;hitting too fast for that.
But even when he landed glancing-like, he shook me, with that
advantage of fifty-five pounds. And he landed solid too often to
suit me.</p>

<p>Try as I would, I couldn't get in a solid smash under the heart,
or on the jaw. He kept his head down, and my vicious uppercuts
merely glanced off his face, too high to do much good. Black and
blue bruises showed on his ribs and shoulders, but his awkward half
crouch kept his vitals protected.</p>

<p>It's mighty hard to hammer a giant like him out of
position&mdash;especially when you're trying to keep him from
tearing off your head at the same time. I bored in close, letting
Sven's blows go around my neck while I blasted away with both
hands. No&mdash;they was little science used on either side. It was
mostly a wild exchange of sledge-hammer wallops.</p>

<p>In one of our rare clinches, Sven lifted me off my feet and
throwed me the full width of the room where I hit the
wall&mdash;<i>wham!</i>&mdash;like I was going on through. This
made Bill, as referee, very mad at Sven and he cussed him and
kicked him heartily in the pants, but the big cheese never paid no
attention.</p>

<p>I was landing the most blows and they rocked Sven from stem to
stern, but they wasn't vital ones. Already his face was beef. One
eye was closed, his lips were pulped and his nose was bleeding; his
left side was raw, but, if anything, he seemed to be getting
stronger. My training hadst toughened him a lot more than I'd
realized!</p>

<p><i>Blim!</i> A glancing slam on my jaw made me see plenty of
stars. <i>Wham!</i> His right met the side of my head and I shot
back half-way across the room to crash into the wall. Long ago we'd
got off the canvas; we was fighting all over the joint.</p>

<p>Sven was after me like a mad bull, and I braced myself and
stopped him in his tracks with a left hook that ripped his ear
loose and made his knees sag for a second. But the Swede had worked
hisself into one of them berserk rages where you got to mighty near
kill a man to stop him. His right, curving up from his hip, banged
solid on my temple and I thought for a second my skull was caved in
like an egg-shell.</p>

<p>Blood gushed down my neck when he drawed his glove back, and,
desperate, I hooked my right to his body with everything I had
behind it. I reckon that was when I cracked his rib, because I
heard something snap and he kind of grunted.</p>

<p>Both of us was terrible looking by this time and kind of in a
dream like, I saw Knut wringing his hands and begging Bill and
Mushy and Fritz to stop it&mdash;I reckon he'd never saw a real
glove battle before and it was so different from lifting weights!
Naturally, they, who was clean goggle-eyed and yelling theirselves
deaf and dumb, paid no attention to him at all, and so in a second
Knut turned and run out into the street like he was going for the
cops.</p>

<p>But I paid no heed. For the first time in many a day I was
fighting with my back to the wall against one of my own crew. Sven
was inhuman&mdash;it was like fighting a bull or an elephant. He
was landing solid now, and even if them blows was clumsy, with 245
pounds of crazy Swede behind them, they was like the blows of a
pile-driver.</p>

<p>He knowed only one kind of footwork&mdash;going forward. And he
kept plunging and hitting, plunging and hitting till the world was
blind and red. I shook my head and the blood flew like spray. The
sheer weight of his plunges hurtled me back in spite of myself.</p>

<p>Once more I tried to rock his head up for a solid shot to the
jaw. My left uppercut split his lips and rattled his teeth, but his
bowed neck was like iron. In desperation I banged him square on the
side of the head where his skull was hardest.</p>

<p>Blood spurted like I'd hit him with a hand spike, and he swayed
drunkenly&mdash;then he dropped into a deep crouch and shot his
left to my midriff with all his weight behind it. Judas! It was so
unexpected I couldn't get away from it. I was standing nearly
upright and that huge fist sank into my solar-plexus till I felt it
banged against my spine. I dropped like a sack and writhed on the
floor like a snake with a busted back, fighting for air. Bill said
later I was purple in the face.</p>

<p>Like I was looking through a thick fog, I seen Bill, dazed and
white-faced, counting over me. I dunno how I got up again. I was
sick&mdash;I thought I was dying. But Sven was standing right over
me, and looking up at him, a lot of thoughts surged through my
numbed and battered brain in a kind of flash.</p>

<p>The new champion of the <i>Sea Girl</i>, I thought, after all
these years I've held my title against all comers. After all the
men I've fought and licked to hold the only title I got. All the
cruel punishment I've took, all the blood I've spilt, now I lose my
only title to this square-head that I've licked half a dozen times.
Like a dream it all come back&mdash;the dim-lighted, smelly, dingy
forecastle, the yelling, cursing seamen&mdash;and me in the middle
of it all&mdash;the bully of the forecastle. And now&mdash;never no
more to defend my title&mdash;never to hear folks along the docks
say: "That's Steve Costigan, champ of the toughest ship
afloat!"</p>

<p>With a kind of gasping sob, I grabbed Sven's legs and climbed
up, up, till I was on my feet, leaning against him chest to chest,
till he shook me off and smashed me down like he was driving a nail
into the floor. I reeled up just as Bill began to count, and this
time I ducked Sven's swing and clinched him with a grip even he
couldn't break.</p>

<p>And as I held on and drew in air in great racking gasps, I
looked over his straining shoulder and seen Knut come rushing in
through the door with a white-faced girl behind him&mdash;Segrida.
But I was too near out to even realize that Sven's ex-girl was
there.</p>

<p>Sven pushed me away finally and dropped me once more with a
punch that was more a push than anything else. This time I took the
count of nine, resting, as my incredible vitality, the wonder of
manys the sporting scribe, began to assert itself.</p>

<p>I rose suddenly and beat Sven to the punch with a wild right
that smashed his nose. Like most sluggers, I never lose my punch,
no matter how badly beaten I am. I'm dangerous right to the last
second, as better men than Sven Larson has found out.</p>

<p>Sven wasn't going so strong hisself as he had been. He moved
stiff and mechanical and swung his arms awkwardly, like they was
dead. He walked in stolidly and smashed a club-like right to my
face. Blood spattered and I went back on my heels, but surged in
and ripped my right under the heart, landing square there for the
first time.</p>

<p>Another right smashed full on Sven's already battered mouth,
and, spitting out the fragments of a tooth, he crashed a flailing
left to my body, which I distinctly felt bend my ribs to the
breaking point.</p>

<p>I ripped a left to his temple, and he flattened my ear with a
swinging right, rocking drunkenly like a tall ship in the Trades
with all sails set. Another right glanced offa the top of my head
as I ducked and for the first time I seen his unguarded jaw as he
loomed above me where I crouched.</p>

<p>I straightened, crashing my right from the hip, with every ounce
of my weight behind it, and all the drive they was in leg, waist,
shoulder and arm. I landed solid on the button with a jolt that
burst my glove and numbed my whole arm&mdash;I heard a
scream&mdash;I seen Sven's eyes go blank&mdash;I seen him sway like
a falling mast&mdash;I seen him pitching forward&mdash;<i>bang!</i>
The lights went out.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>I was propped up in a chair and Bill was sloshing me with water.
I looked around at the dingy gym; then I remember. A queer, sad,
cold feeling come over me. I felt old and worn out. After all, I
wasn't a boy no more. All the hard, bitter years of fighting the
sea and fighting men come over me and settled like a cold cloud on
my shoulders. All the life kind of went out of me.</p>

<p>"Believe me, Steve," said Bill, slapping at me with his towel,
"that fight sure set Sven solid with Segrida. Right now she's
weepin' over his busted nose and black eye and the like, and
huggin' him and kissin' him and vowin' everlastin' love. I knowed I
was right all the time. Knut run after her to get her to stop the
bout. Gosh, the Marines couldn't a stopped it! Mushy clean chawed
Mike's collar in two, he was that excited! Say, would you uh
thought a slob like Sven coulda made the fightin' man he has in six
months?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," I said listlessly, scratching Mike's ear as he licked my
hand. "Well, he had it comin'. He worked hard enough. And he was
lucky havin' somebody to teach him. All I know, I learned for
myself in cruel hard battles. But, Bill, I can't stay on the <i>Sea
Girl</i> now; I just can't get used to bein' just a contender on a
ship where I was champion."</p>

<p>Bill dropped his towel and glared at me: "What you talkin'
about?"</p>

<p>"Why, Sven's the new champ of the <i>Sea Girl</i>, lickin' me
this way. Strange, what a come-back he made just as I thought he
was goin' down."</p>

<p>"You're clean crazy!" snorted Bill. "By golly, a rap on the dome
has a funny effect on some skates. Sven's just now comin' to. Mushy
and Fritz and Knut has been sloshin' him with water for ten
minutes. You knocked him stiff as a wedge with that last right
hook."</p>

<p>I come erect with a bound! "What? Then I licked Sven? I'm still
champion? But if he didn't knock me out, who did?"</p>

<p>Bill grinned. "Don't you know no man can hit you hard enough
with his fist to knock you out? Swedish girls is impulsive. Segrida
done that&mdash;with a iron dumb-bell!"</p>
