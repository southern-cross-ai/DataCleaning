<p class="first">THE minute I seen the man which was going to
referee my fight with Slip Harper in the Amusement Palace Fight
Club, Shanghai, I takes a vi'lent dislike to him. His name was
Hoolihan, a fighting sailor, same as me, and he was a big
red-headed gorilla with hands like hairy hams, and he carried
hisself with a swagger which put my teeth on edge. He looked like
he thought he was king of the waterfront, and that there is a title
I aspires to myself.</p>

<p>I detests these conceited jackasses. I'm glad that egotism ain't
amongst my faults. Nobody'd ever know, from my conversation, that I
was the bully of the toughest ship afloat, and the terror of bucko
mates from Valparaiso to Singapore. I'm that modest I don't think
I'm half as good as I really am.</p>

<p>But Red Hoolihan got under my hide with his struttings and
giving instructions in that fog-horn beller of his'n. And when he
discovered that Slip Harper was a old shipmate of his'n, his
actions growed unbearable.</p>

<p>He made this discovery in the third round, whilst counting over
Harper, who hadst stopped one of my man-killing left hooks with his
chin.</p>

<p>"Seven! Eight! Nine!" said Hoolihan, and then he stopped
counting and said: "By golly, ain't you the Johnny Harper that used
to be bos'n aboard the old <i>Saigon</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yuh&mdash;yeah!" goggled Harper, groggily, getting his legs
under him, whilst the crowd went hysterical.</p>

<p>"What's eatin' you, Hoolihan?" I roared indignantly. "G'wan
countin'!"</p>

<p>He gives me a baleful glare.</p>

<p>"I'm refereein' this mill," he said. "You tend to your part of
it. By golly, Johnny, I ain't seen you since I broke jail in
Calcutta&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Johnny was up at last, and trying to keep me from taking him
apart, which all that prevented me was the gong.</p>

<p>Hoolihan helped Harper to his corner, and they kept up an
animated conversation till the next round started&mdash;or rather
Hoolihan did. Harper wasn't in much condition to enjoy
conversation, having left three molars embedded in my right
glove.</p>

<p>Whilst we was whanging away at each other during the fourth, I
was aware of Hoolihan's voice.</p>

<p>"Stand up to him, Johnny," he said. "I'll see that you get a
square deal. G'wan, sink in your left. That right to the guts
didn't hurt us none. Pay no attention to them body blows. He's
bound to weaken soon."</p>

<p>Enraged beyond control, I turned on him and said, "Look here,
you red-headed baboon, are you a referee or a second?"</p>

<p>I dunno what retort he was fixing to make, because just then
Harper takes advantage of my abstraction to slam me behind the ear
with all he had. Maddened by this perfidy, I turned and sunk my
left to the hilt in his midriff, whereupon he turned a beautiful
pea-green.</p>

<p>"Tie into him, Johnny," urged Hoolihan.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Red," gurgled Harper, trying to clinch. "You're makin'
him mad, and he's takin' it out on <i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"Well, we can take it," begun Hoolihan, but at that moment I
tagged Harper on the ear with a meat-cleaver right, and he done a
nose-dive, to Hoolihan's extreme disgust.</p>

<p>"One!" he hollered, waving his arm like a jib-boom. "Two! Three!
Get up, Johnny. This baboon can't fight."</p>

<p>"Maybe he can't," said Johnny, dizzily, squinting up from the
canvas, with his hair full of resin, "but if he hits me again like
he just done, I'll be a candidate for a harp. And I hate music. You
can count all night if you want to, Red, but as far as I'm
concerned, the party's over!"</p>

<p>Hoolihan give a snort of disgust, and grabbed my right arm and
raised it and hollered: "Ladies and gents, it is with the deepest
regret that I announce this bone-headed gorilla as the winner!"</p>

<p>With a beller of wrath, I jerked my arm away from him and hung a
clout on his proboscis that knocked him headfirst through the
ropes. Before I couldst dive out on top of him, as was my firm
intention, I was seized from behind by ten special
policemen&mdash;rough-houses is so common in the Amusement Palace
that the promoter is always prepared. Whilst I was being interfered
with by these misguided idjits, Hoolihan riz from amongst the ruins
of the benches and customers, and tried to crawl back into the
ring, bellering like a bull and spurting blood all over everything.
But a large number of people fell on him with piercing yells and
dragged him back and set on him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile forty or fifty friends of the promoter hadst come to
the rescue of the ten cops, and eventually I found myself back in
my dressing-room without having been able to glut my righteous
wrath on Red Hoolihan's huge carcass. He'd been carried out through
one door whilst several dozen men was hauling me through another.
It's a good thing for them that I'd left my white bulldog Mike
aboard the <i>Sea Girl.</i></p>

<p>I was so blind mad I couldn't hardly get my clothes on, and by
the time I hadst finished I was alone in the building. Gnashing my
teeth slightly, I prepared to sally forth and find Red Hoolihan.
Shanghai was too small for both of us.</p>

<p>But as I started for the door that opened into the corridor, I
heard a quick rush of feet in the alley outside, and the back door
of the dressing-room bust open. I wheeled, with my fists cocked,
thinking maybe it was Red&mdash;and then I stopped short and gawped
in surprise. It wasn't Red. It was a girl.</p>

<p>She was purty as all get-out, but now she was panting and pale
and scared-looking. She shut the door and leaned against it.</p>

<p>"Don't let them get me!" she gurgled.</p>

<p>"Who?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Those Chinese devils!" she gasped. "The terrible Whang Yi!"</p>

<p>"Who's them?" I inquired, considerably bewildered.</p>

<p>"A secret society of fiends and murderers!" she said. "They
chased me into that alley! They'll torture me to death!"</p>

<p>"They won't, neither," I said. "I'll mop up the floor with 'em.
Lemme look!"</p>

<p>I pushed her aside and opened the door and stuck my head out in
the alley. "I don't see nobody," I said.</p>

<p>She leaned back against the wall, with one hand to her heart. I
looked at her with pity. Beauty in distress always touches a warm
spot in my great, big, manly bosom.</p>

<p>"They're hiding out there, somewhere," she whimpered.</p>

<p>"What they chasin' you for?" I asked, forgetting all about my
hurry to smear the docks with Red Hoolihan.</p>

<p>"I have something they want," she said. "My name is Laura
Hopkins. I do a dance act at the European Grand Theater&mdash;did
you ever hear of Li Yang?"</p>

<p>"The bandit chief which was raising Cain around here a couple of
years ago?" I said. "Sure. He raided all up and down the coast.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Last night I came upon a Chinaman dying in the alley behind the
theater," she said. "He'd been stabbed. But he had a piece of paper
in his mouth, which had been overlooked by the men who killed him.
He had been one of Li Yang's soldiers. He gave me that paper, when
he knew he was dying. It was a map showing where Li Yang had hidden
his treasure."</p>

<p>"The heck you say!" I remarked, much interested.</p>

<p>"Yes. And the spot is less than a day's journey from here," she
said. "But somehow the killers learned that I had this map. They
call themselves the Whang Yi. They are the men who were the enemies
of Li Yang in his lifetime. They want the treasure themselves. So
they're after me. Oh, what shall I do?" she said, wringing her
hands.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," I said. "I'll pertect you from them
yeller-bellied rats."</p>

<p>"I want to get away," she whimpered. "I'm afraid to stay in
Shanghai. They'll kill me. I dare not try to find the treasure. I'd
give them the map if they'd only spare my life. But they'll kill me
just for knowing about it. Oh, if I only had money enough to get
away! I'd sell the map for fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"You would?" I ejaculated. "Why, that there treasure is likely
to be a lot of gold and silver and jewerls and stuff. He was a
awful thief."</p>

<p>"It won't do me any good dead," she answered. "Oh, what shall I
do?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," I said, digging into my britches. "Sell it to
me. I'll give you fifty bucks."</p>

<p>"Would you?" she cried, jumping up, her eyes shining.
"No&mdash;oh, no; it wouldn't be fair to you. It's too dangerous.
I'll tear the map up, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" I hollered. "Don't do that, dern it! I'll take
the risks. I ain't scared of no yeller bellies. Here, here's the
fifty. Gimme the map."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll regret it," she said. "But here it is."</p>

<p>Whilst she was counting the fifty, I looked at the map, feeling
like I was holding a fortune in my hand. It seemed to represent a
small island laying a short distance offa the mainland, with trees
and things growing on it. One of these trees was taller'n the
others and stood off to itself. A arrer run from it to a spot on
the beach, which was marked with a "x." There was a lot of Chinese
writing on the edge of the map, and a line of English.</p>

<p>"Fifty paces south of that tall tree," said Miss Hopkins. "Five
feet down in the loose sand. The island is only a few hours run
from the port, if you take a motor launch. Full directions are
written out there in English."</p>

<p>"I'll find it," I promised, handling the map with awe and
reverence. "But before I start, I'll see you home so them Whang Yis
won't try to grab you."</p>

<p>But she said, "No, I'll go out the front way and hail a cab.
Tomorrow night I'll be safe on the high seas. I'll never forget
what you've done for me."</p>

<p>"If you'll give me the address of where you're goin'," I said,
"I'll see that you get a share of the treasure if I finds it."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that," she said. "You've already done more
for me than you realize. Goodbye! I hope you find all you
deserve."</p>

<p>And she left in such a hurry I hardly realized she had went till
she was gone.</p>

<p>Well, I wasted no time. I forgot all about Red Hoolihan&mdash;a
man with millions on his mind ain't got no time for such
hoodlums&mdash;and I headed for a certain native quarter of the
waterfront as fast as I could leg it. I knowed a Chinese fisherman
named Chin Yat who had a motor launch which he rented out, and
being as I had given all my money to Miss Hopkins, I didn't have no
dough, and he was the only one which I knowed would let me have his
boat on credit.</p>

<p>It was late, because the fight card had been a unusually long
one. It was away past midnight when I got to Chin Yat's, and I seen
him and a big white man puttering around the boat, under the light
of torches burning near the wharves. I bust into a run, because I
was afraid he'd rent the boat before I could get there, though I
couldn't figger what any white man would want with a boat that time
of night.</p>

<p>As I hove up, I hollered, "Hey Chin, I wanta rent your
boat&mdash;"</p>

<p>The big white man turned around, and the torchlight fell on his
face. It was Red Hoolihan.</p>

<p>"What you doin' here?" he demanded, clenching his fists.</p>

<p>"I got no time to waste on you," I snarled. "I'll fix you later.
Chin, I gotta have your motor-boat."</p>

<p>He shook his head and sing-songed, "Velly solly. No can do."</p>

<p>"What you mean?" I hollered. "How come you can't?"</p>

<p>"'Cause it's already rented to me," said Hoolihan, "and I've
done paid him his dough in advance."</p>

<p>"But this here's important," I bellered. "I <i>got</i> to have
that boat! It means a lot of dough."</p>

<p>"What d'you know about a lot of dough?" snorted Hoolihan. "I
need that boat because I'm goin' after more dough than you ever
dreamed of, you bone-headed ape! You know why I ain't takin' the
time to caulk the wharf-timbers with your gore? Well, I'll tell
you, so you won't get no false ideas. I ain't got the time to waste
on a baboon like you. I'm goin' after hidden treasure! When I come
back, that boat'll be loaded to the gunnels with gold!"</p>

<p>And so saying, he waved a piece of paper in my face.</p>

<p>"Where'd you get that?" I yelped.</p>

<p>"None of your business," he said. "That's&mdash;hey, leggo
that!"</p>

<p>I had made a grab for it, in my excitement, and he took a poke
at me. I busted him in the snout in return, and he nearly went over
the lip of the wharf. He managed to catch hisself&mdash;and then he
let out a agonized beller. The paper had slipped outa his hand and
vanished in the black water.</p>

<p>"Now look what you done!" he howled frantically. "You've lost me
a fortune. Put up your mitts, you spawn of the devil's gutter! I'm
goin' to knock&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did your map look like this?" I asked, pulling out mine and
showing it to him in the torchlight. The sight sobered him
quick.</p>

<p>"By Judas!" he bawled. "The same identical map! Where'd you get
it?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," I said. "The p'int is, we both knows
what the other'n's after. We both wants the treasure Li Yang hid
before the Federalists bumped him off. I got a map but no boat, you
got a boat but no map. Let's go!"</p>

<p>"Before I'd share anything with you," he said bitterly, "I'd
lose the whole shebang."</p>

<p>"Who said anything about sharin' anything?" I roared. "The best
man takes the loot. I still got a score to settle with you. We
finds the plunder, and then we settles our argument. Winner takes
the treasure!"</p>

<p>"Okay with me," he agreed, blood-thirstily. "Come on!"</p>

<p>But as we sputtered outa the harbor in the starlight, a sudden
thought hit me.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" I said. "Does this here island lie south or north of
the port?"</p>

<p>"Cut off the engine and we'll look at the map," he said, holding
up a lantern. I done so, and we peered at the line of English which
was writ in a very small, femernine hand.</p>

<p>"That's a 'n'," said Red, pointing at it with his big, hairy
finger. "It means the island lies north of the harbor."</p>

<p>"It looks like a 's' to me," I said. "I believe it means the
island's south of the harbor."</p>

<p>"I say north!" exclaimed Hoolihan, angrily.</p>

<p>"South!" I snarled.</p>

<p>"We goes north!" bellered Hoolihan, brandishing his fists. He
hadn't no control over his temper at all. "We goes north or
nowheres!"</p>

<p>As I started to rise, my foot hit something in the bottom of the
launch. It was a belaying pin. I ain't a man to be gypped out of a
fortune account of the stubbornness of some misguided jackass. I
laid that belaying pin over Red Hoolihan's ear with a full-arm
swing.</p>

<p>"We goes south," I repeated truculently, and they was no
opposing voice.</p>

<p>Feeling your way along that coast at night in a motor-launch
ain't no picnic. Hoolihan come to just about daylight, and he got
up and rubbed the lump over his ear, and cussed free and
fervent.</p>

<p>"I won't forget this," he said. "This here is another score to
settle with you. Where at are we?"</p>

<p>"There's the island, dead ahead," I answered.</p>

<p>He scowled over the map, and said, "It don't look like the one
on the map."</p>

<p>"You expect a ignerant Chinese to draw a perfect map?" I
retorted. "It's bound to be the one. Look for a tall tree standing
kinda out alone. It oughta be on this end of the island."</p>

<p>But it wasn't; they wasn't nothing there but low, thick bushes
rising outa marshy land. We tried the other end of the island, and
I said: "This is it. The Chinee made another mistake. He put the
tree on the wrong end of the island. There's a sandy beach and a
tall palm standin' out from the rest of the growth."</p>

<p>Hoolihan had forgot all about his doubts. He was as impatient as
me to get ashore. We run in and tied up in a narrow cove, and
tramped through the deep sand to the trees, packing the picks and
shovels we had brung along, and my heart beat faster as I realized
that in a short time I wouldst be a millionaire.</p>

<p>That tall palm was a lot closer to the water than it looked like
on the map. When we'd stepped off fifty paces to the south, we was
waist-deep in water!</p>

<p>"I see where we meets with engineerin' problems in our
excavations," I said, but Hoolihan scowled and flexed his enormous
arms, and said, "That ain't worryin' me. I'm thinkin' about
somethin' else. Here we are, there's the treasure, lyin' under five
foot of sand and water. All we got to do is dig it up. But we ain't
settled yet whose treasure it is."</p>

<p>"All right," I said, shedding my shirt, "we settles it now."</p>

<p>With a roar, Hoolihan ripped off his shirt and squared off, the
morning sun gleaming on the red hair of his gigantic chest, and the
muscles standing out in knots all over his arms and shoulders. He
come plunging in like the wild bull of Bashen, and I met him breast
to breast with both maulers flailing.</p>

<p>He'd never been licked in a ring or out, they said. He was two
hundred pounds of bone and bulging muscle, and he was quick as a
cat on his feet. Or he would of been, if'n he'd had a chance to
be.</p>

<p>We was standing ankle-deep in sand. They wasn't no chance for
foot-work. It was like dragging our feet through hot mush. The sun
riz higher and beat down on us like the pure essence of hell-fire,
and it soaked vitality out of us like water out of a sponge. And
that awful sand! It was worse'n having iron weights fastened to our
ankles. There wasn't no foot-work, side-stepping&mdash;nothing but
slug, slug, slug! Toe to toe, leaning head to head, with our four
maulers working like sledge-hammers fastened on pistons.</p>

<p>I dunno how long we fought. It musta been hours, because the sun
crawled up and up, and beat down on us like red hot lances.
Everything was floating red before me; I couldn't hear nothing
except Red's gusty panting, the scruff of our feet through that
hellish sand, and the thud and crunch of our fists.</p>

<p>Talk about the heat Jeffries and Sharkey fought in at Coney
Island, and the heat of the ring at Toledo! Them places was Eskimo
igloos compared to that island, under that awful sun! I got so numb
I could scarcely feel the jolt of Hoolihan's iron fists. I'd done
quit any attempt at defense, and so had he. We was just driving in
our punches wide open and with all we had behind 'em.</p>

<p>One of my eyes was closed, the brow split and the lid sagging
down like a curtain. Half the hide was missing from my face, and
one cauliflowered ear was pounded into a purple pulp. Blood was
oozing from my lips, nose and ears. Sweat poured off my chest and
run down my legs till I was standing in mud. We was both slimy with
sweat and blood. I could hear the agonized pound of my own heart,
and it felt like it was going to bust right through my ribs. My
calf muscles and thigh muscles was quivering cords of fire, where
they wasn't numb and dead. Every time I dragged a foot through that
clinging, burning sand it felt like the joints of my limbs was
giving apart.</p>

<p>But Hoolihan was reeling like a stabbed ox, staggering and
blowing. His breath was sobbing through his busted teeth, and blood
streamed down his chin. His belly was heaving like a sail in the
wind, and his ribs was raw beef from my body punching.</p>

<p>I was driving him before me, step by step. And the next thing I
knowed, we was under the shade of that big palm tree, and the sun
wasn't flaying my back no more. It was almost like a dash of cold
water. It revived Hoolihan a little, too. I seen him stiffen and
lift his head, but he was done. My body beating hadst took all the
starch outa his spine. My legs were dead, and I couldn't rush him
no more, but I fell into him and, as I fell, I crashed my right
overhand to his jaw with my last ounce of strength.</p>

<p>It connected, and we went down together, him under me. I laid
there for a second, and then I groped around and caught hold of the
tree and hauled myself to my feet. Hanging on with one hand, I
shook the blood and sweat outa my eyes, and begun counting. I was
so dopey and groggy I got mixed up three or four times and had to
start over, and finally I passed out on my feet, cause when I come
to I was still counting up around thirty or forty. Hoolihan hadn't
moved.</p>

<p>I tried to say, "By golly, the dough's mine!" But all I could do
was gulp like a dying fish. I took one staggering step towards the
picks and shovels, and then my legs give way and I went headfirst
into the sand. And there I laid, like a dead man.</p>

<p>It was the sound of a motor putt-putting above the wash of the
surf which first roused me. Then, a few minutes later, I heard feet
scruff through the sand, and men talking and laughing. Then
somebody swore loud and freely.</p>

<p>I shook the red glare outa my eyes and blinked up. Four men was
standing there, with picks and shovels in their hands, staring down
at me, and I rekernized 'em: Smoky Harrigan, Bat Schimmerling, Joe
Donovan and Tom Storley, as dirty a set of rats as ever infested a
wharf.</p>

<p>"Well, by Jupiter!" said Smoky, with the sneer he always wore.
"What do you know about this? Costigan and Hoolihan! How come these
gorillas to land on <i>this</i> island?"</p>

<p>I tried to get up, but my legs wouldn't work, and I sunk back
into the sand. Hoolihan groaned and cussed groggily somewhere near
me. Harrigan stooped and picked up something which I seen was my
map which had fell into the sand.</p>

<p>He showed it to the others and they laughed loud and jeeringly,
which dully surprised me. My brain was still too numb from
Hoolihan's punching and that awful sun to hardly know what it was
all about.</p>

<p>"Put that map down before I rises and busts you in half," I
mumbled through pulped lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it yours?" asked Smoky, sardonically.</p>

<p>"I bought it offa Miss Laura Hopkins," I said groggily. "It's
mine, and so is the dough. Gimme it before I lays you like a
carpet."</p>

<p>"Laura Hopkins!" he sneered. "That was Suez Kit, the slickest
girl-crook that ever rolled a drunk for his wad. She worked the
same gyp on that big ox Hoolihan. I saw her take him as he left the
fight club."</p>

<p>"What d'you mean?" I demanded, struggling up to a sitting
posture. I still couldn't get on my feet, and Hoolihan was in even
worse shape. "She sold the same map to Hoolihan? Is that where he
got his'n?"</p>

<p>"Why, you poor sucker!" sneered Harrigan. "Can't you understand
nothing? Them maps was fakes. I dunno what you're doin' here, but
if you'd followed 'em, you'd been miles away to the north of the
harbor, instead of the south."</p>

<p>"And there ain't no treasure of Li Yang?" I moaned.</p>

<p>"Sure there is," he said. "What's more, it's hid right here on
this island. And this is the right map." He waved a strip of
parchment all covered with lines and Chinese writing. "There's
treasure here. Li Yang didn't hide it here hisself, but it was left
here for him by a smuggler. Li Yang got bumped off before he could
come for it. An old Chinee fence named Yao Shan had the map. Suez
Kit bought it off him with the hundred bucks she gypped out of you
and Hoolihan. He must have been crazy to sell it, but you can't
never tell about them Chineses."</p>

<p>"But the Whang Yis?" I gasped wildly.</p>

<p>"Horseradish!" sneered Smoky. "A artistic touch to put the story
over. But if it'll make you feel any better, I'll tell you that
Suez Kit lost the map after all. I'd been follerin' her for days,
knowin' she was up to something, though I didn't know just what.
When she got the map from old Yao Shan, I tapped her on the head
and took it. And here we are!"</p>

<p>"The treasure's as much our'n as it is your'n," I protested.</p>

<p>"Heh! heh! heh!" he replied. "Try and get it. Gwan, boys, get to
work. These big chumps has fought each other to a frazzle, and we
got nothin' to fear from 'em."</p>

<p>So I laid there and et my soul out whilst they set about
stealing our loot right under our noses. Smoky paid no attention to
the palm tree. Studying the map closely, he located a big rock
jutting up amongst some bushes, and he stepped off ten paces to the
west. "Dig here," he said.</p>

<p>They pitched in digging a lot harder'n I had any idee them rats
could work, and the sand flew. Purty soon Bat Schimmerling's pick
crunched on something solid, and they all yelled.</p>

<p><i>"Look here!"</i> yelled Tom Storley. "A lacquered chest,
bound with iron bands!"</p>

<p>They all yelled with joy, and Hoolihan groaned dismally. He'd
come to in time to get what it was all about.</p>

<p>"Gypped!" he moaned. "Cheated! Swindled! Framed! And now them
thieves is robbin' us right before us!"</p>

<p>I hauled myself painfully across the sands, and stared down into
the hole, and my heart leaped as I seen the top of a iron-bound
chest at the bottom. A wave of red swept all the weakness and
soreness outa my frame.</p>

<p>Smoky turned and yelled at me, "See what you've missed, you dumb
chump? See that chest? I dunno what's in it, but whatever it is,
it's worth millions! 'More precious than gold,' old Yao Shan said.
And it's our'n! While you and that other gorilla are workin' out
your lives haulin' ropes and eatin' resin dust, we'll be rollin' in
luxury!"</p>

<p>"You'll roll in somethin' else first!" I yelled, heaving up
amongst 'em like a typhoon. Harrigan swung up a pick, but before he
couldst bring it down on my head, I spread his nose all over his
face with a left hook which likewise deprived him of all his front
teeth and rendered him <i>horse-de-combat.</i> At this moment Bat
Schimmerling broke a shovel over my head, and Tom Storley run in
and grappled with me. This was about the least sensible thing he
could of done, as he instantly realized, and just before he lapsed
into unconsciousness he hollered for Donovan to get a gun.</p>

<p>Donovan took the hint and run for the launch, where he procured
a shotgun and come back on the jump. He hesitated to fire at long
range, because I was so mixed up with Storley and Schimmerling that
he couldn't hit me without riddling them. But about that time I
untangled myself from Storley's senseless carcass and caressed
Schimmerling's chin with a right uppercut which stood him on his
head in the hole on top of the chest.</p>

<p>Donovan then give a yelp of triumph and throwed the gun to his
shoulder&mdash;but Hoolihan had crawled up behind him on all-fours,
and as Joe pulled the trigger, Red swept his legs out from under
him. The charge combed my hair, it missed me that close, and
Donovan crashed down on top of Hoolihan, who stroked his whiskers
with a right that nearly tore his useless head off.</p>

<p>Hoolihan then crawled to the edge of the hole and looked
down.</p>

<p>"It's your'n," he gulped. "You licked me. But it busts my heart
to think of the dough I've lost."</p>

<p>"Aw, shut up," I growled, grabbing Schimmerling by the hind laig
and dragging him out of the hole. "Help me get this chest outa
here. Whatever's in it, you get half."</p>

<p>Hoolihan gaped at me.</p>

<p>"You mean that?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"He may, but I don't!" broke in a hard, femernine voice, and we
whirled to behold Miss Laura Hopkins standing before us. But they
was considerable change in her appearance. She wore a man's shirt,
for one thing, and khaki pants and boots, and her face was a lot
harder'n I remembered it. Moreover, they was a bandage on her head
under her sun-helmet, and she had a pistol in her hand, p'inting at
us. She looked like Suez Kit now, all right.</p>

<p>She give a sneer at Smoky and his minions, which was beginning
to show signs of life.</p>

<p>"That fool thought he'd finished me, eh? Pah! I don't kill that
easy," she said. "Stole my map, the rat! How did you two gorillas
get here? Those maps I sold you were for an island half a day from
here."</p>

<p>"It was my mistake," I said, and I added, limping disconsolately
towards her, "I believed you. I thought you was in distress."</p>

<p>"The more fool you," she sneered. "I <i>had</i> to have a
hundred dollars to buy Yao Shan's map. That gyp I worked on you and
Hoolihan was the best one I could think of, at the spur of the
moment. Now get to work and hoist that chest out, and load it in my
boat. You're a sap to trust anybody&mdash;<i>ow</i>!"</p>

<p>I'd slapped the gun out of her hand so quick she didn't have
time to pull the trigger. It went spinning into the water and
sunk.</p>

<p>"Just because <i>you're</i> smart, you think everybody else is a
sap," I snorted. "C'mon, Red, le's get our chest out."</p>

<p>Suez Kit stood staring wildly at us. "But it's mine!" she
hollered. "I gave Yao Shan a hundred dollars&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You give him our hundred," I snorted. "You make me sick."</p>

<p>Me and Red bent down and got hold of the chest and rassled it
out of the hole. Suez Kit was doing a war-dance all over the
beach.</p>

<p>"You dirty, double-crossing rats!" she wept. "I might have known
I couldn't trust any man! Robbers! Bandits! Oh, this is too
much!"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up," I said wearily. "We'll give you some of the
loot&mdash;gimme that rock, Red. The lock is plumb rotten."</p>

<p>I took the stone and hit the lock a few licks, and it come all
to pieces. Smoky and his gang had come to, and they watched us
wanly. Suez Kit fidgeted around behind us, and I heard her breath
coming in pants. Red throwed open the lid. They was a second of
painful silence, and then Suez Kit let out an awful scream and
staggered back, her hands to her head. Harrigan and his mob lifted
up their voices in lamentation.</p>

<p>That chest wasn't full of silver, nor platinum, nor jewels. It
was full of machine-gun cartridges!</p>

<p>"Bullets!" said Hoolihan, kinda numbly. "No wonder Yao Shan was
willing to sell the map. 'More precious than gold,' he said. Of
course, this ammunition <i>was</i> more precious than gold to a
bandit chief. Steve, I'm sick!"</p>

<p>So was Smoky and his gang. And Suez Kit wept like she'd sot on a
hornet.</p>

<p>"Steve," said Red, as him and me limped towards our boat whilst
the sounds of weeping and wailing riz behind us, "was it because I
kept Donovan from blowin' your head off that you decided to split
the treasure with me?"</p>

<p>"Do I look like a cheapskate?" I snapped. "I knowed from the
first that I was going to split with you."</p>

<p>"Then why in the name of thunderation," he bellered, turning
purple in the face, "did you have to beat me up like you done, when
you was intendin' to split anyway? What was we fightin' about,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"You might of been fightin' for the loot," I roared, brandishing
my fists in his face, "but I was merely convincin' you who was the
best man."</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't convinced," he bellered, waving <i>his</i> fists.
"It was the sand and the sun which licked me, not you. We'll settle
this in the ring tonight, at the Amusement Palace."</p>

<p>"Let's go!" I yelled, leaping into the launch. "I'm itchin' to
prove to the customers that you're as big a flop as a fighter as
you were as a referee."</p>
