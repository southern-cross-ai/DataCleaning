<h2><a id="iron1" name="iron1">1. &mdash; [UNTITLED]</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">A CANNON-BALL for a left and a thunderbolt for a
right! A granite jaw, and chilled steel body! The ferocity of a
tiger, and the greatest fighting heart that ever beat in an
iron-ribbed breast! That was Mike Brennon, heavyweight
contender.</p>

<p>Long before the sports writers ever heard the name of Brennon, I
sat in the "athletic tent" of a carnival performing in a small
Nevada town, grinning at the antics of the barker, who was volubly
offering fifty dollars to anyone who could stay four rounds with
"Young Firpo, the California Assassin, champeen of Los Angeles and
the East Indies!" Young Firpo, a huge hairy fellow, with the
bulging muscles of a weight-lifter and whose real name was
doubtless Leary, stood by with a bored and contemptuous expression
on his heavy features. This was an old game to him.</p>

<p>"Now, friends," shouted the spieler, "is they any young man here
what wants to risk his life in this here ring? Remember, the
management ain't responsible for life or limb! But if anybody'll
git in here at his own risk&mdash;"</p>

<p>I saw a rough-looking fellow start up&mdash;one of the usual
"plants" secretly connected with the show, of course&mdash;but at
that moment the crowd set up a yell, "Brennon! Brennon! Go on,
Mike!"</p>

<p>At last a young fellow rose from his seat, and with an
embarrassed grin, vaulted over the ropes. The "plant"
hesitated&mdash;Young Firpo evinced some interest, and from the
hawk-like manner in which the barker eyed the newcomer, and from
the roar of the crowd, I knew that he was on the
"up-and-up"&mdash;a local boy, in other words.</p>

<p>"You a professional boxer?" asked the barker.</p>

<p>"I've fought some here, and in other places," answered Brennon.
"But you said you barred no one."</p>

<p>"We don't," grunted the showman, noting the difference in the
sizes of the fighters.</p>

<p>While the usual rigmarole of argument was gone through, I
wondered how the carnival men intended saving their money if the
boy happened to be too good for their man. The ring was set in the
middle of the tent; the dressing-rooms were in another part. There
was no curtain across the back of the ring where the local fighter
could be pressed to receive a blackjack blow from the confederate
behind the curtain.</p>

<p>Brennon, after a short trip to the dressing-room, climbed into
the ring and was given a wild ovation. He was a finely built lad,
six feet one in height, slim-waisted and tapering of limb, with
remarkably broad shoulders and heavy arms. Dark, with narrow gray
eyes, and a shock of black hair falling over a low, broad forehead,
his was the true fighting face&mdash;broad across the
cheekbones&mdash;with thin lips and a firm jaw. His long, smooth
muscles rippled as he moved with the ease of a huge tiger. Opposed
to him Young Firpo looked sluggish and ape-like.</p>

<p>Their weights were announced, Brennon 189, Young Firpo 191. The
crowd hissed; anyone could see that the carnival boxer weighed at
least 210.</p>

<p>The battle was short, fierce and sensational, and with a
bedlam-like ending. At the gong Brennon sprang from his corner,
coming in wide open, like a bar-room brawler. Young Firpo met him
with a hard left hook to the chin, stopping him in his tracks.
Brennon staggered, and the carnival boxer swung his right flush to
the jaw&mdash;a terrific blow which, strangely enough, did not seem
to worry Brennon as had the other. He shook his head and plunged in
again, but as he did so, his foe drew back the deadly left and
crashed it once more to his jaw. Brennon dropped like a log, face
first. The crowd was frenzied. The barker, who was also referee,
began counting swiftly, Young Firpo standing directly over the
fallen warrior.</p>

<p>At "five!" Brennon had not twitched. At "seven!" he stirred and
began making aimless motions. At "eight!" he reeled to his knees,
and his reddened, dazed eyes fixed themselves on his conqueror.
Instantly they blazed with the fury of the killer. As the spieler
opened his mouth to say "ten!" Brennon reeled up in a blast of
breath-taking ferocity that stunned the crowd.</p>

<p>Young Firpo, too, seemed stunned. Face whitening, he began a
hurried retreat. But Brennon was after him like a blood-crazed
tiger, and before the carnival fighter could lift his hands,
Brennon's wide-looping left smashed under his heart and a sweeping
right found his chin, crashing him face down on the canvas with a
force that shook the ring.</p>

<p>The astounded barker mechanically began counting, but Brennon,
moving like a man in a trance, pushed him away and stooping, tore
the glove from Young Firpo's limp left hand. Removing something
therefrom, held it up to the crowd. It was a heavy iron affair,
resembling brass knuckles, and known in the parlance of the ring as
a knuckle-duster. I gasped. No wonder Young Firpo had been unnerved
when his victim rose! That iron-laden glove crashing twice against
Brennon's jaw should have shattered the bone, yet he had been able
to rise within ten seconds and finish his man with two blows!</p>

<p>Now all was bedlam. The barker tried to snatch the
knuckle-duster from Brennon, and one of Young Firpo's seconds
rushed across the ring and struck at the winner. The crowd, sensing
injustice to their favorite, surged into the ring with the avowed
intention of wrecking the show! As I made my way to the nearest
exit I saw an infuriated townsman swing up a chair to strike the
still prostrate Young Firpo. Brennon sprang forward and caught the
blow on his own shoulder, going to his knees under it; then I was
outside and as I walked away, laughing, I still heard the turmoil
and the shouts of the policemen.</p>

<p>Some time later I saw Brennon fight again, in a small club on
the West Coast. His opponent was a second-rater named Mulcahy.
During the fight my old interest in Brennon was renewed. With
incredible stamina, with as terrific a punch as I ever saw, it was
evident his one failing was an absolute lack of science. Mulcahy,
though strong and tough, was a mere dub, yet he clearly outboxed
Brennon for nearly two rounds, and hit him with everything he had,
though his best blows did not even make the dark-browed lad wince.
With the second round a half minute to go, one of Brennon's
sweeping swings landed and the fight was over.</p>

<p>I thought to myself: that lad looks like a champion, but he
fights like a longshoreman, but I won't attach too much importance
to that. Many a fighter stumbles through life and never learns
anything, simply because of an ignorant or negligent manager.</p>

<p>I went to Brennon's dressing-room and spoke to him.</p>

<p>"My name is Steve Amber. I've seen you fight a couple of
times."</p>

<p>"I've heard of you," he answered. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>Overlooking his abrupt manner, I asked: "Who's your
manager?"</p>

<p>"I haven't any."</p>

<p>"How would you like me to manage you?"</p>

<p>"I'd as soon have you as anybody," he answered shortly. "But
this was my last fight. I'm through. I'm sick of flattening dubs in
fourth-rate joints."</p>

<p>"Tie up with me. Maybe I'll get you better matches."</p>

<p>"No use. I had my chance twice. Once against Sailor Slade; once
against Johnny Varella. I flopped. No, don't start to argue. I
don't want to talk to you&mdash;or to anybody. I'm through, and I
want to go to bed."</p>

<p>"Suit yourself," I answered. "I never coax&mdash;but here's my
card. If you change your mind, look me up."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="iron2" name="iron2">2. &mdash; SCENTING THE KILL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WEEKS stretched into months. But Mike Brennon was
not a man one could forget easily. When I dreamed, as all fight
fans and fighters' managers dream, of a super-fighter, the form of
Mike Brennon rose unbidden&mdash;a dark, brooding figure, charged
with the abysmal fighting fury of the primitive.</p>

<p>Then one day Brennon came to me&mdash;not in a day-dream, but in
the flesh. He stood in the office of my training camp, his crumpled
hat in his hand, an eager grin on his dark face&mdash;a very
different man from the morose and moody youth to whom I had talked
before.</p>

<p>"Mr. Amber," he said directly, "if you still want me, I'd like
to have you manage me."</p>

<p>"That's fine," I answered.</p>

<p>Brennon appeared nervous.</p>

<p>"Can you get me a fight right away?" he asked. "I need
money."</p>

<p>"Not so fast," I said. "I can advance you some money if you're
in debt&mdash;"</p>

<p>He made an impatient gesture. "It's not that&mdash;can you get
me a fight this week?"</p>

<p>"Are you in trim? How long since you've been in the ring?"</p>

<p>"Not since you saw me last; but I always stay in shape."</p>

<p>I took Brennon to my open-air ring where Spike Ganlon, a clever
middleweight, was working out, and instructed them to step for a
few fast rounds. Brennon was eager enough, and I was astonished to
see him put up a very fair sort of boxing against the shifty
Ganlon. True, he was far out-stepped and out-classed, but that was
to be expected, as Ganlon was a rather prominent figure in the
fistic world. But I did not like the way Mike sent in his punches.
They lacked the old trip-hammer force, and he was slower than I had
remembered him to be. However, when I had him slug the heavy bag he
flashed his old form, nearly tearing the bag loose from its
moorings, and I decided that he had been pulling his punches
against Ganlon.</p>

<p>The days that followed were full of hard work and careful
coaching. Brennon listened carefully to what Ganlon and I told him,
but the result was far from satisfying. He was intelligent, but he
could not seem to apply practically the things he learned easily in
theory.</p>

<p>Still, I did not expect too much of him at first. I worked with
him patiently for several weeks, importing a fairly clever
heavyweight for his sparring partner. The first time they really
let go, I was amazed and disappointed. Mike shuffled and floundered
awkwardly with futile, flabby blows. When a sharp jab on the nose
stung him, he quit trying to box and went back to his old style of
wild and aimless swinging. However, these swings were the old
sledge-hammer type, and his erratic speed had returned to him. I
quickly called a halt.</p>

<p>"I'm wrong," I said. "I've been trying to make a boxing wizard
out of you. But you're a natural slugger, though you seem to have
little of the natural slugger's aptitude. Looks like you'd have
learned something from your actual experience in the ring.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, I'm going to make a real slugger like Dempsey,
Sullivan and McGovern out of you. I know how you are; you've got
the slugger's instinct. You can box fairly well with a friend when
you're just doing it for fun, but when you're in the ring, or
somebody stings you, you forget everything but your natural style.
It's no discredit to a man's mentality. Dempsey was a clever boxer
when he was sparring, but he never boxed in the ring. And he swung
like you do, till DeForest taught him to hit straight.</p>

<p>"Still, Mike, I'll tell you frankly that at his crudest, Dempsey
showed more aptitude for the game than you do. Now, this is for
your own good. Dempsey, Ketchell and McGovern, even when they were
just starting, used instinctive footwork and kept stepping around
their men. They ducked and weaved and hit accurately. You go in
straight up and wide open, and a blind man could duck your swings.
You've unusual speed, but you don't know how to use it. But now
that I know where I've been making my mistake, I'll change my
tactics."</p>

<p>For a time it seemed as though my dreams were coming
true&mdash;that Mike was a second Dempsey. In spite of his urging
that I get him a fight, I kept him idle for three months&mdash;that
is, he was not fighting. For hours each day I had him practice
hooking the heavy bag with short smashes to straighten his punches
and eliminate so much aimless swinging. He would never learn to put
force behind a straight punch, but I intended making him a vicious
hooker like Dempsey. And I tried to teach him the weave of that old
master and the trick of boring in, protected by a barricade of
gloves and elbows until in close; and the fundamentals of footwork
and feinting. It was not easy.</p>

<p>"Mike," said Ganlon to me, "is a queer nut. He's got a fighter's
heart and body, but he ain't got a fighter's brain. He understands,
but he can't do what you teach him. He has to work for hours on the
simplest trick&mdash;and then he's liable to forget it. If he was a
bonehead, I'd understand it. But he's brainy in other ways."</p>

<p>"Maybe he fought so long in second-rate clubs he formed habits
he can't break."</p>

<p>"Partly. But it goes deeper. They's a kink in his brain."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, a kink?" I asked uneasily.</p>

<p>"I dunno. But it's somethin' that breaks down his coordination
and keeps his mind from workin' with his muscles. When he tries to
box he has to stop and think, and in the ring you ain't got time.
You see a punch comin' and in that split-second you got to know
what you can't do and what you can do to get outa the way and
counter. 'Course, you don't exactly study it all out, but you
<i>know,</i> see? That is, if you're a fast boxer. If you're a
wide-open slugger like Mike, you don't think nothin'. You just take
the punch as a matter of course, spit out your teeth and keep
borin' in."</p>

<p>"But any slugger is that way," I objected. "And we're not trying
to teach Mike to be clever, in the technical sense of the
word."</p>

<p>Ganlon shook his head. "I know. But Mike's different. He ain't
cut out for this game. Even these simple tricks are too complicated
for him. Well, he's got to learn some defense, or he'll be punched
cuckoo in a few years. All the great sluggers had some. Some weaved
and crouched, like Dempsey; some wrapped their arms around their
skull and barged in, like Nelson and Paolino. Them that fought wide
open didn't last no time, 'specially among the heavies. The padded
cell and paper-doll cut-outs for most of 'em. It don't stand to
reason a human skull can stand up under the beatin's it gets like
that."</p>

<p>"You're a born croaker. Mike's rugged but intelligent. He'll
learn."</p>

<p>"At anything else, yes&mdash;at this game&mdash;maybe."</p>

<p>Not long after my talk with Spike, Brennon came to me.</p>

<p>"Steve," he said, "I've got to have a fight. I need
money&mdash;bad."</p>

<p>"Mike," said I, "it's none of my business, but I don't see why
you should be so desperately insistent. You've been at no expense
at all, here in the camp. You said you weren't in debt, and you've
refused my offer to loan you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What business is it of yours?" he broke in, white at the
lips.</p>

<p>"None at all," I hastened to assure him. "Only as your manager,
I've got your financial interests at heart, naturally. I
apologize."</p>

<p>"I apologize, too, Steve," he answered abruptly, his manner
changing. "I should have known you weren't trying to pry into my
private affairs. But I've got to have at least&mdash;" And he named
a sum of money which rather surprised me.</p>

<p>"There's only one way to get that much," I answered.
"Understand, I don't believe you're ready to go in with a
first-string man. But since money is the object&mdash;Monk Barota
is on the coast now, padding his kayo record. He'll be looking for
set-ups. The promoter at the Hopi A.C. is a friend of mine. I can
get you a match with him at close to the figure you named. You
understand that a bad defeat now might ruin you. Don't say I didn't
warn you. But you're in fine shape, and if you fight as we've
taught you, I believe you can whip him."</p>

<p>"I'll whip him," Mike nodded grimly.</p>

<p>I hoped he was more sincere in his belief than I was. I really
felt in my heart that he was not ready for a first-rater and I had
intended building him up more gradually. But there was fierce,
driving intensity about him when he spoke of the money he needed
that broke down my resolution. Brennon was, in many ways, a
character of terrific magnetic force. Like Sullivan, he dominated
all about him, trainers, handlers and matchmakers. But only in the
matter of money was he unreasonable, and this quirk in his nature
amounted to an obsession.</p>

<p>Mainly through my influence, Brennon, an entirely unknown
quantity, was matched with Barota for a ten-rounder; at ringside
the odds were three to one on the Italian, with no takers. My last
instructions to Mike were: "Remember! Use the crouch and guard
Ganlon taught you. If you don't have some defense, he'll ruin
you!"</p>

<p>The lights went out except those over the ring. The gong
sounded. The crowd fell silent&mdash;that breathless, momentary
silence that marks the beginning of the fight. The men slid out of
their corners and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my gosh!" wailed Ganlon at my side. "He's doin' everything
backward!"</p>

<p>Mike wore his old uncertain manner. Under the lights, with his
foe before him and the roar of the crowd deafening him, he was like
a trapped jungle beast, bewildered and confused. Barota
led&mdash;Mike ducked clumsily the wrong way, and took the punch in
the eye. That flicking left was hard for any man to avoid, but Mike
incessantly ducked into it.</p>

<p>Ganlon was raving at my side. "After all these months of work,
he forgets! You better throw in the sponge now. Look there!" as
Mike tried a left of his own. "He can't even hook right. The whole
house knows what's comin'. Same as writin' a letter about it."</p>

<p>Barota was taking his time. In spite of the fact that his foe
seemed to have nothing but a scowl, no man could look into Mike
Brennon's face and take him lightly. But a round of clumsy
floundering and ineffectual pawing lulled his suspicions.
Meanwhile, he flitted around the bewildered slugger, showering him
with stinging left jabs. Ganlon was nearly weeping with rage as if
his pupil's inaptness somehow reflected on him.</p>

<p>"All I know, I taught him, and there's that wop makin' a monkey
outa him!"</p>

<p>With the round thirty seconds to go, Barota suddenly tore in
with one of his famous attacks. Mike abandoned all attempts at
science and began swinging wildly and futilely. Barota worked
untouched between his flailing arms, beating a rattling barrage
against Brennon's head and body. The gong stopped the
punishment.</p>

<p>Mike's face was somewhat cut, but he was as fresh as if he had
not just gone through a severe beating. He broke in on Ganlon's
impassioned soliloquy to remark: "This fellow can't hit."</p>

<p>"Can't hit!" Ganlon nearly dropped the sponge. "Why, he's got a
kayo record as long as a subway! Ain't he just pounded you all over
the ring?"</p>

<p>"I didn't feel his punches, anyway," answered Mike, and then the
gong sounded.</p>

<p>Barota came out fast, in a mood to bring this fight to a sudden
close. He launched a swift attack, cut Mike's lips with a right;
then began hammering at his body with the left-handed assault which
had softened so many of his opponents for the kayo. The crowd went
wild as he battered Mike around the ring, but suddenly I felt
Ganlon's fingers sink into my arm.</p>

<p>"Bat Nelson true to life!" he whispered, his voice vibrating
with excitement. "The crowd thinks, and Barota thinks, them left
hooks is hurtin' Mike&mdash;but he ain't even feelin' 'em. He's got
one chance&mdash;when Barota shoots the right&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment Barota stepped back, feinted swiftly and shot the
right. He was proud of the bone-crushing quality of that right
hand. He had a clear opening and every ounce of his weight went
behind it. The leather-guarded knuckles backed by spar-like arm and
heavy shoulder, crashed flush against Mike's jaw. The impact was
plainly heard in every part of the house. A gasp went up, nails
sank deep into clenching palms. Mike swayed drunkenly, but he did
not fall.</p>

<p>Barota stopped short for a flashing instant&mdash;frozen by the
realization that he had failed to even floor his man. And in that
second Mike swung a wild left and landed for the first
time&mdash;high on the cheek bone, but Barota went down. The crowd
rose screaming. Dazed, the Italian rose without a count and Mike
tore into him with the ferocity of a tiger that scents the kill.
Barota, blinded and dizzy, was in no condition to defend himself,
yet Mike missed with both hands until a mine-sweeping right-hander
caught his man flush on the temple, and he dropped&mdash;not merely
out, but senseless.</p>

<p>The crowd was in a frenzy, but Ganlon said to me: "He's an iron
man, don't you see? A natural-born freak like Grim and Goddard.
He'll never learn anything, not if he trains a hundred years."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="iron3" name="iron3">3. &mdash; WHITE-HOT FIGHTING
FURY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE day after Mike Brennon had shocked the
sporting world by his victory, he, Ganlon and I sat at breakfast,
and we were a far from merry gang. Ganlon read the morning papers
and growled.</p>

<p>"The whole country's on fire," he muttered. "Sports writers
goin' cuckoo over the new find. Tellin' Barota cried and took on in
his dressin'-room when he come to; and talkin' about how Mike
'fooled' his man in the first round by lookin' like a
dub&mdash;callin' him a second Fitzsimmons! Applesauce. But here's
a old-timer that knows his stuff.</p>

<p>"'If I am not much mistaken,'" he read, "'this Brennon is the
same who looked like a deckhand against Sailor Slade in Los Angeles
last year. His kayo of Barota had all the ear-marks of a fluke. He
is, however, incredibly tough.'</p>

<p>"Uhmhuh," said Ganlon, laying down the paper. "Quite true. Mike,
I hate to say it, but as a fighter you're a false alarm. It ain't
your fault. You got the heart and the body, but you got no more
natural talent than a ribbon clerk, and you can't learn. You got
the fightin' instinct, but not the fighter's instinct&mdash;and
they's a flock of difference.</p>

<p>"You're just a heavyweight Joe Grim. A iron man; never was one
but Jeffries who could learn anything. I'm advisin' you to quit the
ring&mdash;now. Your kind don't come to no good end. Too many
punches on the head. They get permanently punch drunk. You don't
have to go around countin' your fingers; you got brains enough to
succeed somewhere else.</p>

<p>"You got three courses to follow: first, you can go around
fightin' set-ups at the small clubs. You can make a livin' that
way, and last a long time. Second, you can sign up with some of the
offers you're bound to get now. Fightin' clever first-raters you
won't win much, if any, but you'll be an attraction like Grim was.
But you won't last. You'll crack under the incessant fire of
smashes, and wind up in the booby hatch. Third and best, you can
take what money you got and step out. Me and Steve will gladly lend
you enough to start in business in a modest way."</p>

<p>I nodded. Mike shook his head and spread his iron fingers on the
table in front of him. As usual he dominated the scene&mdash;a
great somber figure of unknown potentialities.</p>

<p>"You're right, Spike, in everything you've said. I've always
known there was a deficiency somewhere. No man could be as
impervious to punishment as I am and have a perfectly normal brain.
Not alone at boxing; I've failed at everything else I've tried. As
for boxing, the crowd dazes me, for one thing. But that isn't all.
I just can't remember what to do next, and have to struggle through
the best way I can.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I <i>can take it!</i> That's my one hope. That's why
I'm not quitting the game. At the cost of my reflexes, maybe,
Nature gave me an unusual constitution. You admit I'd be a drawing
card. Well, I'm like Battling Nelson&mdash;not human when it comes
to taking punishment. The only man that ever hurt me was Sailor
Slade, and he couldn't stop me. Nobody can now. Eventually, after
years of battering, someone will knock me out. But before that
time, I'm going to cash in on my ruggedness. Capitalize on the fact
that no man can keep me down for the count. I'll accumulate a
fortune if I'm handled right."</p>

<p>"Great heavens, man!" I exclaimed. "Do you realize what that
means&mdash;the frightful punishment, the mutilations? You'll be
fighting first-raters now&mdash;men with skill and terrific
punches. You have no defense. You sap, they'd hammer you to a red
pulp."</p>

<p>"My defense is a granite jaw and iron ribs," he answered. "I'll
take them all on and wear them down."</p>

<p>"Maybe," I answered. "A man can wear himself down punching a
granite boulder, as I've seen men do with Tom Sharkey and Joe
Goddard, but what about the boulder! You were lucky with Barota.
The next man will watch his step."</p>

<p>"They can't hurt me. And I can beat any man I can hit. Win or
lose, I'll be a drawing card, and that means big purses. That's
what I'm after. Do you think I'd go through this purgatory if the
need wasn't great?"</p>

<p>"If it's poverty&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"What do you know about poverty?" he cried in a strange passion.
"Were you left in a basket on the steps of an orphanage almost as
soon as you were born? Did you spend your childhood mixed in with
five hundred others, where the needs of all were so great that no
one of you got more than the barest necessities? Did you pass your
boyhood as a tramp and hobo worker, riding the rods and starving? I
did!</p>

<p>"But that's neither here nor there; nor it isn't my own personal
poverty so much that drove me back in the ring&mdash;but let it
pass. As my manager, I want you to get busy. If I can win another
fight it will increase my prestige. I don't expect to win many.
Later on, they'll come packing in to see me, for the same reason
they went to see Joe Grim&mdash;to see if I can be knocked out.
Until the fans find out I'm a freak, I'll have to go on my merits.
Barota wants a return match. I don't want him now, or any other
clever man who'll outpoint me and make me look even worse than I
am. I want the fans to see me bloody and staggering&mdash;and still
carrying on! That's what draws the crowd. Get me a
mankiller&mdash;a puncher who'll come in and try to murder me. Get
me Jack Maloney!"</p>

<p>"It's suicide!" I cried. "Maloney'll kill you! I won't have
anything to do with it!"</p>

<p>"Then, by heaven," Brennon roared, heaving erect and crashing
his fist on the table, "our ways part here! You could help me
better than anyone else&mdash;you know the ballyhoo. But if you
fail me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you're determined," I said huskily, my mind almost numbed by
the driving force of his will-power, "I'll do all I can. But I warn
you, you'll leave this game with a clouded brain."</p>

<p>His nervous grip nearly crushed my fingers as he said shortly:
"I knew you'd stand by me. Never mind my brain; it's cased in solid
iron."</p>

<p>As he strode out Ganlon, slightly pale, said to me in a low
voice: "A twist in his head sure. Money&mdash;all the
time&mdash;money. I'm no dude, but he dresses like a wharfhand.
What's he do with his money? He ain't supportin' no aged mother,
it's a cinch. You heard him say he was left on a doorstep."</p>

<p>I shook my head. Brennon was an enigma beyond my
comprehension.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The rise of Iron Mike Brennon is now ring history, and of all the
vivid pages in the annals of this heart-stirring game, I hold that
the story of this greatest of all iron men makes the most lurid,
fantastic and pulse-quickening chapter.</p>

<p>Iron Mike Brennon! Look at him as he was when his exploits swept
the country. Six feet one from his narrow feet to the black tousled
shock of his hair; one hundred and ninety pounds of steel springs
and whalebone. With his terrible eyes glaring from under heavy
black brows, thin, blood-smeared lips writhed in snarl of battle
fury&mdash;still when I dream of the super-fighter there rises the
picture of Mike Brennon&mdash;a dream charged with bitterness. Take
a man with incredible stamina and hitting power; take from him the
ability to remember one iota of science in actual combat and leave
out of his make-up the instinct of the natural fighter, and you
have Iron Mike Brennon. A man who would have been the greatest
champion of all time, but for that flaw in his make-up.</p>

<p>His first fight, after that memorable breakfast table
conversation, was with Jack Maloney&mdash;one hundred and
ninety-five pounds of white-hot fighting fury, with a right hand
like a caulking mallet. They met at San Francisco.</p>

<p>With the aid of Ganlon and friendly scribes, I set the old
ballyhoo working. The papers were full of Mike Brennon. They
pointed out that he had over twenty knockouts to his credit,
ignoring the fact that all of these victims, except one, were
unknown dubs. They glossed over the fact that he had been
out-pointed by second-raters and beaten to a pulp by Sailor Slade.
They angrily refuted charges that his kayo of Barota was a
fluke.</p>

<p>The stadium was packed that night. The crowd paid their money,
and they got its worth. Before the bell I was whispering a few
instructions which I knew would be useless, when Mike cut in with
fierce eagerness: "What a sell-out! Look at that crowd! If I win
it'll mean more sell-outs and bigger purses! I've <i>got</i> to
win!" His eyes gleamed with ferocious avidity.</p>

<p>Two giants crashed from their corners as the gong sounded.
Maloney came in like the great slugger he was, body crouched, chin
tucked behind his shoulder, hands high. Brennon, forgetting
everything before the blast of the crowd and his own fighting fury,
rushed like a longshoreman, head lifted, hands clenched at his
hips, wide open&mdash;as iron men have fought since time
immemorial&mdash;with but one thought&mdash;to get to his foe and
crush him.</p>

<p>Maloney landed first, a terrific left hook which spattered
Brennon with blood and brought the crowd to its feet, roaring. I
heard a note of relief in the shouts of Maloney's manager. This
bird was going to be easy, after all! Like most sluggers, when they
find a man they can hit easily, Maloney had gone fighting crazy. He
lashed Brennon about the ring, hitting so hard and fast that Mike
had no time to get set. The few swings he did try swished
harmlessly over Maloney's bobbing head.</p>

<p>"He's slowin' down," muttered Ganlon as the first round drew to
a close. "The old iron man game! Maloney's punchin' hisself
out."</p>

<p>True, Jack's blows were coming not weaker, but slower. No man
could keep up the pace he was setting. Brennon was as strong as
ever, and just before the gong he staggered Maloney with a sweeping
left to the body&mdash;his first blow.</p>

<p>Back in his corner Ganlon wiped the blood from Mike's battered
face and grinned savagely: "Joe Goddard had nothin' on you. I'm
beginnin' to believe you'll beat him. You've took plenty and you'll
take more; he'll come out strong but each round he'll get weaker;
he'll be fought out."</p>

<p>The fans thundered acclaim as Maloney rushed out for the second.
But he had sensed something they had not. He had hit this man with
everything he possessed and had failed to even floor him. So he
tore in like a wild man, and again drove Brennon about the ring
before a torrent of left and right hooks that sounded like the
kicks of a mule. Brennon, eyes nearly closed, lips pulped, nose
broken, showed no sign of distress until the latter part of the
round, when Maloney landed repeatedly to the jaw with his maul-like
right. Then Mike's knees trembled momentarily, but he straightened
and cut his foe's cheek with a glancing right.</p>

<p>At the gong the crowd began to realize what was going on. The
timbre of their yells changed. They began to inquire at the top of
their voices if Maloney was losing his famed punch, or if Brennon
was made of solid iron.</p>

<p>Ganlon, wiping Brennon's gory features and offering the smelling
salts, which he pushed away, said swiftly: "Maloney's legs trembled
as he went back to his corner; he looked back over his shoulder
like he couldn't believe it when he saw you walk to your corner
without a quiver. He knows he ain't lost his punch! He knows you're
the first man ever stood up to him wide open; he knows you been
through a tough grind and ain't even saggin'. You got his goat. Now
go get <i>him</i>!"</p>

<p>The gong sounded. Maloney came in, the light of desperation in
his eyes, to redeem his slipping fame as a knocker-out. His blows
were like a rain of sledge-hammers and before that rain Mike
Brennon went down. The referee began counting. Maloney reeled back
against the ropes, breath coming in great gasps&mdash;completely
fought out.</p>

<p>"He'll get up," said Ganlon calmly.</p>

<p>Brennon was half crouching on his knees, dazed, not hurt. I saw
his lips move and I read their motion: "More fights&mdash;more
money&mdash;"</p>

<p>He bounded erect. Maloney's whole body sagged. Brennon's rising
took more morale out of Jack than any sort of a blow would have
done. Mike, sensing the mental condition and physical weariness of
Maloney, tore in like a tiger. Left, right, he missed, shaking off
Maloney's weakening blows as if they had been slaps from a girl. At
last he landed&mdash;a wide left hook to the head. Maloney
tottered, and a wild over-hand right crashed under his cheek bone,
dashing him to his knees. At "nine!" he staggered up, but another
right that a blind man in good condition could have ducked, dropped
him again. The referee hesitated, then raised Mike's hand,
beckoning to Maloney's seconds.</p>

<p>As Maloney, aided by his handlers, reeled to his corner on
buckling legs, I noted the ironical fact: the winner was a gory,
battered wreck, while the loser had only a single cut on his cheek.
I thought of the old fights in which iron men of another day had
figured: of Joe Goddard, the old Barrier Champion, outlasting the
great Choynski, finishing each of their terrible battles a bloody
travesty of a man, but winner. I thought of Sharkey dropping Kid
McCoy; of Nelson outlasting Gans; Young Corbett&mdash;Herrerra. And
I sighed. Of all the men who relied on their ruggedness to carry
them through, Brennon was the most wide open, the most erratic.</p>

<p>As I sponged his cuts in the dressing-room, I could not help
saying: "You see what fighting a first-string hitter means; you
won't be able to answer the gong for months."</p>

<p>"Months!" he mumbled through smashed lips. "You'll sign me up
with Johnny Varella for a bout next week!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="iron4" name="iron4">4. &mdash; IRON MIKE'S DREAD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER the Maloney fight, fans and scribes realized
what he was&mdash;an iron man&mdash;and as such his fame grew. He
became a drawing card just as he had predicted&mdash;one of the
greatest of his day. And his inordinate lust for money grew with
his power as an attraction. He haggled over prices, held out for
every cent he could get, and rather than pass up a fight, would
always lower his price. For the first and only time in my life, I
was merely a figure-head. Brennon was the real power behind the
curtain. And he insisted on fighting at least once a month.</p>

<p>"You'll crack three times as quickly fighting so often," I
protested. "Otherwise you might last for years."</p>

<p>"But why stretch it out if I can make the same amount of money
in a few months that I could make in that many years?"</p>

<p>"But consider the strain on you!" I cried.</p>

<p>"I'm not considering anything about myself," he answered
roughly. "Get me a match."</p>

<p>The matches came readily. He had caught the crowd's fancy and no
matter whom he fought, the fans flocked to see him. He met them
all&mdash;ferocious sluggers, clever dancers, and dangerous
fighters who combined the qualities of slugger and boxer. When
first-rate opponents were not forthcoming quickly enough, he went
into the sticks and pushed over second-raters. As long as he was
making money, no matter how much or how little, he was satisfied.
What he did with that money, I did not know. He was honest, always
shot square with his obligations; but beyond that he was a miser.
He lived at the training camps or at the cheapest hotels, in spite
of my protests; he bought cheap clothes and allowed himself no
luxuries whatever.</p>

<p>At first he won consistently. He was dangerous to any man.
Coupled with his abnormal endurance was a mental state&mdash;a
driving, savage determination&mdash;which dragged him off the
canvas time and again. This was above and beyond his natural
fighting fury, and he had acquired it between the time he had first
retired and the next time I saw him.</p>

<p>At the time he was in his prime, there was a wealth of material
in the heavyweight ranks, and Brennon loomed among them as the one
man none of them could stop. That fact alone put him on equal
footing with men in every other way his superiors.</p>

<p>Following the Maloney fight, the public clamored for a match
between my iron man and Yon Van Heeren, the Durable Dutchman, who
was considered, up to that time, the toughest man in the world, one
who had never been knocked out, and whose only claim to fame, like
Brennon's, was his ruggedness. A certain famous scribe, referring
to this fight as "a brawl between two bar-room thugs," said: "This
unfortunate affair has set the game back twenty years. No sensitive
person seeing this slaughter for his or her first fight, could ever
be tempted to see another. People who do not know the game are
likely to judge it by the two gorillas, who, utterly devoid of
science, turned the ring into a shambles."</p>

<p>Before the men went into the ring they made the referee promise
not to stop the fight under any circumstances&mdash;an unusual
proceeding, but easily understood in their case.</p>

<p>The fight was a strange experience to Mike; most of the
punishment was on the other side. Van Heeren, six feet two and
weighing 210 pounds, was a terrific hitter, but lacked Mike's
dynamic speed and fury. Those sweeping haymakers which had missed
so many others, crashed blindingly against the Dutchman's head or
sank agonizingly into his body. At the end of the first round his
face was a gory wreck. At the end of the fourth his features had
lost all human semblance; his body was a mass of reddened
flesh.</p>

<p>Toe to toe they stood, round after round, neither taking a back
step. The fifth, sixth and seventh rounds were nightmares, in which
Mike was dropped three times, and Van Heeren went down twice that
many times. All over the stadium women were fainting or being
helped out; fans were shrieking for the fight to be stopped.</p>

<p>In the ninth, Van Heeren, a hideous and inhuman sight, dropped
for the last time. Four ribs broken, features permanently ruined,
he lay writhing, still trying to rise as the referee tolled off the
"Ten!" that marked his finish as a fighting man.</p>

<p>Mike Brennon, clinging to the ropes, dizzy and nearly punched
out for the only time in his life, stood above his victim,
acknowledged king of all iron men. This fight finished Van Heeren,
and nearly finished boxing in the state, but it added to Brennon's
fame, and his real pity for the broken Dutchman was mingled with a
fierce exultation of realized power. More money&mdash;more packed
houses! The world's greatest iron man! In the three years he fought
under my management he met them all, except the champion of his
division. He lost about as many as he won, but the only thing that
could impair his drawing power was a knockout&mdash;and this seemed
postponed indefinitely. He won more of his fights against the hard
punchers than against the light tappers, as the latter took no
chances. Many a slugger, after battering him to a red ruin, blew up
and fell before his aimless but merciless attack. He broke the
hands and he broke the hearts of the men who tried to stop him.</p>

<p>The light hitters outboxed him, but did not hurt him, and his
wild swings were dangerous even to them. Barota outpointed him, and
Jackie Finnegan, Frankie Grogan and Flash Sullivan, the lightheavy
champion.</p>

<p>The hard hitters made the mistake of trading punches with him.
Soldier Handler dropped him five times in four rounds, and then
stopped a right-hander that knocked him clear out of the ring and
into fistic oblivion. Jose Gonzales, the great South American,
punched himself out on the iron tiger and went down to defeat.
Gunboat Sloan battered out a red decision over him, but still
believing he could achieve the impossible, went in to trade punches
in a return bout, and lasted less than a round. Brennon finished
Ricardo Diaz, the Spanish Giant, and beat down Snake Calberson
after his toughness had broken the Brown Phantom's heart. Johnny
Varella and several lesser lights broke their hands on him and
quit. He met Whitey Broad and Kid Allison in no decision bouts;
knocked out Young Hansen, and fought a fierce fifteen-round draw
with Sailor Steve Costigan, who never rated better than a
second-class man, but who gave some first-raters terrific
battles.</p>

<p>To those who doubt that flesh and blood can endure the
punishment which Brennon endured, I beg you to look at the records
of the ring's iron men. I point to your attention, Tom Sharkey
plunging headlong into the terrible blows of Jeffries; that same
Sharkey shooting headlong over the ropes onto the concrete floor
from the blows of Choynski, yet finishing the fight a winner.</p>

<p>I call to your attention Mike Boden, who had no more defense
than had Brennon, staying the limit with Choynski; and Joe Grim
taking all Fitzsimmons could hand him&mdash;was it fifteen or
sixteen times he was floored? Yet he finished that fight standing.
No man can understand the iron men of the ring. Theirs is a long,
hard, bloody trail, with oftentimes only poverty and a clouded mind
at the end, but the red chapter their clan has written across the
chronicles of the game will never be effaced.</p>

<p>And so Brennon fought on, taking all his cruel punishment,
hoarding his money, saying little&mdash;as much a mystery to me as
ever. Sports writers discovered his passion for money, and raked
him. They accused him of being miserly and refusing aid to his less
fortunate fellows&mdash;the battered tramps who will occasionally
touch a successful fighter for a hand-out. This was only partly
true. He did sometimes give money to men who needed it desperately,
but the occasions were infrequent.</p>

<p>Then he began to crack. Ganlon, his continual champion, first
sensed it. Crouching beside me the night Mike fought Kid Allison,
Spike whispered to me out of the corner of his mouth: "He's slowin'
down. It's the beginnin' of the end."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
That night Spike spoke plainly to his friend.</p>

<p>"Mike, you're about through. You're slippin'. Punches jar you
worse than they used to. You've lasted three years of terrible hard
goin'. You got to quit."</p>

<p>"When I'm knocked out," said Mike stubbornly. "I haven't taken
the count yet."</p>

<p>"When a bird like you takes the count, it means he's a
punch-drunk wreck," said Ganlon. "When the blows begin to hurt you,
it means the shock of them is reachin' the brain and hurtin' it.
Remember Van Heeren, that you finished? He's wanderin' around,
sayin' he's trainin' to fight Fitzsimmons, that's been dead for
years."</p>

<p>A shadow crossed Mike's dark face at the mention of the
Dutchman's name. The beatings he had taken had disfigured him and
given him a peculiarly sinister look, which however, did not rob
his face of its strange dominating quality.</p>

<p>"I'm good for a few more fights," he answered. "I need
money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Always money!" I exclaimed. "You must have half a million
dollars at least. I'm beginning to believe you <i>are</i> a
miser&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Steve," said Ganlon suddenly, "Van Heeren was around here
yesterday."</p>

<p>"What of it?"</p>

<p>Ganlon continued almost accusingly, "Mike gave him a thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"What if I did?" cried Brennon in one of his rare inexplicable
passions. "The fellow was broke&mdash;in no condition to earn any
money&mdash;I finished him&mdash;why shouldn't I help him a little?
Whose business is it?"</p>

<p>"Nobody's," I answered. "But it shows you're not a miser. And it
deepens the mystery about you. Won't you tell me why you need more
money?"</p>

<p>He made a quick impatient gesture. "There's no need. You get the
matches&mdash;I do the fighting. We split the money, and that's all
there is to it."</p>

<p>"But, Mike," I said as kindly as I could, "there is more to it.
You've made me more money than either of the champions I've
managed, and if I didn't sincerely wish for your own good, I'd say
for you to stay in the ring.</p>

<p>"But you <i>ought</i> to quit. You can even get your features
fixed up&mdash;plastic face building is a wonderful art. Fight even
one more time, and you may spend your days in a padded cell."</p>

<p>"I'm tougher than you think," he answered. "I'm as good as I
ever was and I'll prove it. Get me Sailor Slade."</p>

<p>"He beat you once before, when you were better than you are now.
How do you expect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't have the incentive to win then, that I have now."</p>

<p>I nodded. What this incentive was I did not know, but I had seen
him rise again and again from what looked like certain
defeat&mdash;had seen him, writhing on the canvas, turn white, his
eyes blue with sudden terror as he dragged himself upright. Terror?
Of losing! A terror that kept him going when even his iron body was
tottering on the verge of collapse and when the old fighting frenzy
had ceased to function in the numbed brain. What prompted this
dread? It was a mystery I could not fathom, but that in some way it
was connected with his strange money-lust, I knew.</p>

<p>"You'll sign me for four fights," Brennon was saying. "With
Sailor Slade, Young Hansen, Jack Slattery and Mike Costigan."</p>

<p>"You're out of your head!" I exclaimed sharply. "You've picked
the four most dangerous battlers in the world!"</p>

<p>"Hansen, it'll be easy. I beat him once, and I can do it again.
I don't know about Slattery. I want to take him on last. First,
I've got to hurdle Slade. After him, I'll fight Costigan. He's the
least scientific of the four, but the hardest hitter. If I'm
slipping I want to get him before I've gone too far."</p>

<p>"It's suicide!" I cried. "If you've got to fight, pass up these
mankillers and take on some set-ups. If Slade don't knock you out,
he'll soften you up so Costigan will punch you right into the
bughouse. He's a murderer. They call him Iron Mike, too."</p>

<p>"I'll pack them in," he answered heedlessly. "Slade's nearly the
drawing card I am, and as for Costigan, the fans always turn out to
see two iron men meet."</p>

<p>As usual, there was no answer to be made.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="iron5" name="iron5">5. &mdash; THE ROLL OF THE IRON
MEN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT WAS a few nights before the Brennon-Slade
fight. I had wandered into Mike's room and my eye fell on a
partially completed letter on his writing table. Without any
intention of spying, I idly noted that it was addressed to a girl
named Marjory Walshire, at a very fashionable girls' school in New
York state.</p>

<p>I saw that a letter from this girl lay beside the other one, and
though it was an atrocious breach of manners, in my curiosity to
know why a girl in a society school like that would be writing to a
prize-fighter, I picked up the partially completed letter and
glanced idly over it. The next moment I was reading it with fierce
intensity, all scruples, forgotten. Having finished it, I snatched
up the other and ruthlessly tore it open.</p>

<p>I had scarcely finished reading this when Mike entered with
Ganlon. His eyes blazed with sudden fury, but before he could say a
word I launched an offensive of my own&mdash;for one of the few
times in my life, wild with rage.</p>

<p>"You born fool!" I snarled. "So this is why you've been
crucifying yourself!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by getting into my private correspondence?"
his voice was husky with fury.</p>

<p>I sneered. "I'm not going to enter into a discussion of
etiquette. You can beat me up afterward, but just now I'm going to
have my say.</p>

<p>"You've been keeping some girl in a ritzy finishing school back
East. Finishing school! It's nearly finished you! What kind of a
girl is she, to let you go through this mill for her? I'd like for
her to see your battered map now! While she's been lolling at ease
in the most expensive school she could find, you've been flattening
out the resin with your shoulders and soaking it down with your
blood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" roared Brennon, white and shaking.</p>

<p>He leaned back against the table, gripping the edge so hard his
knuckles whitened as he fought for control. At last he spoke more
calmly.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the incentive that's kept me going. That girl is
the only girl I ever loved&mdash;the only thing I ever had to
love.</p>

<p>"Listen, do you know how lonely a kid is when he has absolutely
nobody in the world to love? The folks in the home were kind, but
there were so many children&mdash;I got the beginnings of a good
education. That's all.</p>

<p>"Out in the world it was worse. I worked, tramped, starved. I
fought for everything I ever got. I have a better education than
most, you say. I worked my way through high school, and read all
the books in my spare time that I could beg, steal or borrow. Many
a time I went hungry to buy a book.</p>

<p>"I drifted into the ring from fighting in carnivals and the
like. I never got anywhere. After I whipped Mulcahy the night you
talked to me, I quit. Drifted. Then in a little town on the Arizona
desert I met Marjory Walshire.</p>

<p>"Poverty? She knew poverty! Working her fingers to the bone in a
cafe. Good blood in her too, just as there is in me, somewhere. She
should have been born to the satins and velvets&mdash;instead she
was born to the greasy dishes and dirty tables of a second-class
cafe. I loved her, and she loved me. She told me her dreams that
she never believed would come true&mdash;of education&mdash;nice
clothes&mdash;refined companions&mdash;every thing that any girl
wants.</p>

<p>"Where was I to turn? I could take her out of the
cafe&mdash;only to introduce her to the drudgery of a laboring
man's wife. So I went back into the ring. As soon as I could, I
sent her to school. I've been sending her money enough to live as
well as any girl there, and I've saved too, so when she gets out of
school and I have to quit the ring, we can be married and start in
business that won't mean drudgery and poverty.</p>

<p>"Poverty is the cause of more crimes, cruelty and suffering than
anything else. Poverty kept me from having a home and people like
other kids. You know how it is in the slums&mdash;parents toiling
for a living and too many children. They can't support them all.
Mine left me on the door-step of the orphanage with a note: 'He's
honest born. We love him, but we can't keep him. Call him Michael
Brennon.'</p>

<p>"Poverty can be as cruel in a small town as in a
city&mdash;Marjory, who'd never been out of the town where she was
born&mdash;with her soul starved and her little white hands
reddened and callused&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's the thought of her that's kept me on my feet when the
whole world was blind and red and the fists of my opponent were
like hammers on my shattering brain&mdash;that's the thought that
dragged me off the canvas when my body was without feeling and my
arms hung like lead, to strike down the man I could no longer see.
And as long as she's waiting for me at the end of the long trail,
there's no man on earth can make me take the count!"</p>

<p>His voice crashed through the room like a clarion call of
victory, but my old doubts returned.</p>

<p>"But how can she love you so much," I exclaimed, "when she's
willing for you to go through all this for her?"</p>

<p>"What does she know of fighting? I made her believe boxing was
more or less of a dancing and tapping affair. She'd heard of
Corbett and Tunney, clever fellows who could step twenty rounds
without a mark, and she supposed I was like them. She hasn't seen
me in nearly four years&mdash;not since I left the town where she
worked. I've put her off when she's wanted to come and see me, or
for me to come to her. When she does see my battered face it'll be
a terrible shock to her, but I was never very handsome
anyway&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me," I broke in, "that she never tunes in
on one of your fights, never reads an account of them, when the
papers are full of your doings?"</p>

<p>"She don't know my real name. After I quit the game the first
time, I went under the name of Mike Flynn to duck the two-by-four
promoters I'd fought for, and who were always pestering me to fight
for them again. The first time I saw Marjory I began to think of
fighting again, and I never told her differently. The money I've
sent has been in cashier's checks. To her, I'm simply Mike Flynn, a
fighter she never hears of. She wouldn't recognize my picture in
the papers."</p>

<p>"But her letters are addressed to Mike Brennon."</p>

<p>"You didn't look closely. They're addressed to Michael Flynn,
care of Mike Brennon, this camp. She thinks Brennon is merely a
friend of her Mike. Well, now you know why I've fought on and
stinted myself. With Van Heeren, it was different. I'm responsible
for his condition. I had to help him.</p>

<p>"These four fights now; one of them may be my last. I've got
money, but I want more. I intend that Marjory shall never want
again for anything. I'm to get a hundred grand for this fight. My
third purse of that size. With good management, thanks to you, I've
made more money than many champions. If I whip these four men, I'll
fight on. If I'm knocked out, I'll have to quit. Let's drop the
matter."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
I haven't the heart to tell of the Brennon-Slade fight in detail.
Even today the thought of the punishment Mike took that night takes
the stiffening out of my knees. He had slipped even more than we
had thought. The steel-spring legs, which had carried him through
so many whirlwind battles, had slowed down. His sweeping haymakers
crashed over with their old power, but they did not continually
wing through the air as of old. Blows that should not have jarred
him, staggered him. The squat sailor, wild with the thought of a
knockout, threw caution to the winds. How many times he floored
Mike I never dared try to remember, but Brennon was still Iron
Mike. Again and again the gong saved him; in the fourteenth round
Slade went to pieces, and the iron tiger he had punched into a red
smear, found him in the crimson mist and blindly blasted him into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Brennon collapsed in his corner after Slade was counted out, and
both men were carried senseless from the ring. I sat by Mike's side
that night while he lay in a semi-conscious state, occasionally
muttering brokenly as his bruised brain conjured up red visions. He
lay, both eyes closed, his oft-broken nose a crushed ruin, cut and
gashed all about the head and face, now and then stirring uneasily
as the pain of three broken ribs stabbed him.</p>

<p>For the first time he spoke the name of the girl he loved,
groping out his hands like a lost child. Again he fought over his
fearful battles and his mighty fists clenched until the knuckles
showed white and low bestial snarls tore through his battered
lips.</p>

<p>In his delirium he raised himself painfully on one elbow, his
burning, unseeing eyes gleaming like slits of flame between the
battered lids; he spoke in a low voice as if answering and
listening to the murmur of ghosts: "Joe Grim! Battling Nelson! Mike
Boden! Joe Goddard! Iron Mike Brennon!"</p>

<p>My flesh crawled. I cannot impart to you the uncanniness of
hearing the roll call of those iron men of days gone by, muttered
in the stillness of night through the pulped and delirious lips of
the grimmest of them all.</p>

<p>At last he fell silent, and went into a natural slumber. As I
went softly into the other room, Ganlon entered, his savage eyes
blazing with fierce triumph. With him was a girl&mdash;a darling of
high society she seemed, with her costly garments and air of
culture, but she exhibited an elemental anxiety such as no pampered
and sophisticated debutante would, or could have done.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" she cried desperately. "Where is Mike? I must see
him!"</p>

<p>"He's asleep now," I said shortly, and added in my cruel
bitterness: "You've done enough to him already. He wouldn't want
you to see him like he is now."</p>

<p>She cringed as from a blow. "Oh, let me just look in from the
door," she begged, twining her white hands together&mdash;and I
thought of how often Mike's hands had been bathed in blood for
her&mdash;"I won't wake him."</p>

<p>I hesitated and her eyes flamed; now she was the primal
woman.</p>

<p>"Try to stop me and I'll kill you!" she cried, and rushed past
me into the room.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="iron6" name="iron6">6. &mdash; A CINCH TO WIN!</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE girl stopped short on the threshold. Mike
muttered restlessly in his sleep and turned his blind eyes toward
the door, but did not waken. As the girl's eyes fell on that
frightfully disfigured face, she swayed drunkenly; her hands went
to her temples and a low whimper like an animal in pain escaped
her. Then, her face corpse-white and her eyes set in a deathly
stare, she stole to the bedside and with a heart-rending sob, sank
to her knees, cradling that battered head in her arms.</p>

<p>Mike muttered, but still he did not waken. At last I drew her
gently away and led her into the next room, closing the door behind
us. There she burst into a torrent of weeping. "I didn't know!" she
kept sobbing over and over. "I didn't know fighting was like that!
He told me never to go to a fight, or listen to one over the radio,
and I obeyed him. Why, how could I know&mdash;here's one of the few
letters in which he even mentioned his fights. I've kept them
all."</p>

<p>The date was over three years old. I read: "Last night I stopped
Jack Maloney, a foremost contender. He scarcely laid a glove on me.
Don't worry about me, darling, this game is a cinch."</p>

<p>I laughed bitterly, remembering the gory wreck Maloney had made
of Mike before he went out.</p>

<p>"I've been doing you an injustice," I said. "I didn't think a
man could keep a girl in such ignorance as to the real state of
things, but it's true. You're O.K. Maybe you can persuade Mike to
give up the game&mdash;we can't."</p>

<p>"Surely he can't be thinking of fighting again if he lives?" she
cried.</p>

<p>I laughed. "He won't die. He'll be laid up a while, that's all.
Now I'll take you to a hotel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to stay here close to Mike," she answered
passionately. "I could kill myself when I think how he's suffered
for me. Tomorrow I'm going to marry him and take him away."</p>

<p>After she was settled in a spare room, I turned to Spike: "I
guess you're responsible for this. You might have waited till Mike
was out of bed. That was a terrible shock for her."</p>

<p>"I intended it should be," he snarled. "I wrote and told her did
she know her boy Mike Flynn was really Mike Brennon which was
swiftly bein' punched into the booby-hatch? And I gave her some
graphic accounts of his battles. I wrote her in time for her to get
here to see the fight, but she says she missed a train."</p>

<p>"Let him fight," Spike spat. "Costigan will kill him, if they
fight. I've seen these iron men crack before. I was in Tom Berg's
corner the night Jose Gonzales knocked him out, and he died while
the referee was countin' over him. Some men you got to kill to
stop. Mike Brennon's one of 'em. If the girl's got a spark of real
womanhood in her, she'll persuade him to quit."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Morning found the battered iron man clear of mind, his super-human
recuperative powers already asserting themselves. I brought Marjory
to his bedside and before he could say anything, I left them alone.
Later she came to me, her eyes red with weeping.</p>

<p>"I've argued and begged," she cried desperately, "but he won't
give in!"</p>

<p>All of us surrounded Mike's bedside. "Mike," I said, "you're a
fool. The punches have gone to your head. You can't mean you'll
fight again!"</p>

<p>"I'm good for some more big purses," he replied with a grin.</p>

<p>Marjory cried out as if he had stabbed her. "Mike&mdash;oh,
Mike! We have more money now than we'll ever use. You haven't been
fair to me. I'd have rather gone in rags, and worked my fingers to
the bone in the lowest kind of drudgery than to have you
suffer!"</p>

<p>His face lighted with a rare smile. He reached out a hand,
amazingly gentle, and took one of the girl's soft hands in his
own.</p>

<p>"White little hands," he murmured. "Soft, as they were meant to
be, now. Why, just looking at you repays me a thousand times for
all I've gone through. And what have I gone through? A few
beatings. The old-timers took worse, and got little or
nothing."</p>

<p>"But there's no reason for your crucifying yourself&mdash;and
me&mdash;any longer."</p>

<p>He shook his head with that strange abnormal stubbornness which
was the worst defect in his character.</p>

<p>"As long as I can draw down a hundred thousand dollars a fight,
I'd be a fool to quit. I'm tougher than any of you think. A hundred
thousand dollars!" His eyes gleamed with the old light. "The crowd
roaring! And Iron Mike Brennon taking everything that's handed out,
and finishing on his feet! No! No! I'll quit when I'm counted
out&mdash;not before!"</p>

<p>"Mike!" the girl cried piercingly. "If you fight again, I'll
swear I'll go away and never see you again!"</p>

<p>His gaze beat her eyes down, and her head sank on her breast. I
never saw the human being&mdash;except one&mdash;who could stand
the stare of Mike Brennon's magnetic eyes.</p>

<p>"Marjory," his deep voice vibrated with confidence, "you're just
trying to bluff me into doing what you want me to do. But you're
mine, and you always will be. You won't leave me, now. You
can't!"</p>

<p>She hid her tear-blinded face in her hands and sobbed weakly. He
stroked her bowed head tenderly. A failure in the ring perhaps, but
outside of it Brennon had a power over those with whom he came in
contact that none could overcome. The way he had beaten down the
girl's weak pretense was almost brutal.</p>

<p>"Mike!" snarled Ganlon, speaking harshly and bitterly to hide
his emotions; for a moment the hard-faced middleweight with his two
hundred savage ring battles behind him, dominated the scene: "Mike,
you're crazy! You got everything a man could want&mdash;things that
most men work their lives out for and never get. You're on the
borderline. You couldn't whip a second-rater.</p>

<p>"Costigan's as tough as you ever were. If I thought he'd flatten
you with a punch or two, I'd say, go to it. But he won't. He'll
knock you out, but it'll be after a smashin' that'll ruin you for
life. You'll die, or you'll go to the bughouse. What good will your
money, or Marjory's love do you then?"</p>

<p>Mike took his time about replying, and again his strange
influence was felt like a cloud over the group.</p>

<p>"Costigan's over-rated. I'll show him up. He never saw the day
he could take as much as I can, or hit as hard."</p>

<p>Spike made a despairing gesture, and turned away. Later he said
to the girl and me: "No use arguin'. He thinks it's the money, but
it ain't. The game's in his blood. And he's jealous of Mike
Costigan. These iron men is terrible proud of their toughness.
Remember how Van Heeren fought?"</p>

<p>"Win or lose, ten rounds with Costigan means Mike's finish. Each
is too tough to be knocked out quick. It'll be a long, bloody
grind, and it <i>may</i> finish Costigan, but it'll <i>sure</i>
finish Mike. He'll end that fight dead, or punched nutty. At his
best, Brennon would likely have wore Costigan down like he did Van
Heeren. But Mike's gone away back, and Costigan is young&mdash;in
his prime&mdash;which in a iron man is the same as sayin' you
couldn't hurt him with a pile-driver."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Mike Brennon trained conscientiously, as always. I discharged his
sparring partners and had him punch the light bag for speed, and do
a great deal of road work in a vain effort to recover some of the
former steel spring quality of his weakening legs. But I knew it
was useless. It was not a matter of conditioning&mdash;his trouble
lay behind him in the thousands of cruel blows he had absorbed. A
clever boxer may get out of condition, lose fights and come back;
but when an iron man slips there is no comeback.</p>

<p>In the four months which preceded the Costigan fight, an air of
gloom surrounded the camp which affected all but Mike himself.
Marjory, after days of passionate pleading, sank into a sort of
apathy. That he was being bitterly cruel to the girl never occurred
to Mike, and we could not make him see it. He laughed at our fears
as foolish, and insisted that he was practically in his prime. He
swore that his fight with Slade, far from showing that he had
slipped, proved that he was better than ever! For had he not beaten
Slade, the most dangerous man in the ring? As for Costigan&mdash;a
few rounds of savage slugging would send him down and out.</p>

<p>Mike was aware of his fistic faults; he frankly admitted that
any second-rater who could avoid his swings could outpoint him; but
he sincerely believed that he was still superior in ruggedness to
any man that ever lived. And deep in his heart, I doubt if Mike
really believed he would ever be knocked out.</p>

<p>One thing he insisted on; that Marjory should not see the fight.
And she made one last plea for him to give it up.</p>

<p>"No use to start all that," he answered calmly. "Think, Marjory!
My fourth hundred-thousand-dollar purse! That's a record few
champions have set! One hundred thousand with Flash
Sullivan&mdash;Gonzales&mdash;Slade&mdash;and now Costigan!
Thousands of tickets sold in advance! I've got to go on now,
anyhow. And I'm a cinch to win!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="iron7" name="iron7">7. &mdash; FRAMED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">AS if it were yesterday I visualize the scene; the
ring bathed in the white glow above it; while the great crowd that
filled the huge outside bowl swept away into the darkness of each
side. A circle of white faces looked up from the ringside seats.
Farther out only a twinkling army of glowing cigarettes evidenced
the multitude, and a vast rippling undertone came from the soft
darkness.</p>

<p>"Iron Mike Brennon, 190 pounds; in this corner, Iron Mike
Costigan, 195!"</p>

<p>Brennon sat in his corner, head bowed, a contrast to the
nervous, feline-like picture he had offered when he had paced the
floor in his dressing-room. I wondered if he was still seeing the
tear-stained face of Marjory as she kissed him in his dressing-room
before he came into the ring.</p>

<p>When the men were called to the center of the ring for
instructions, Mike, to my surprise, seemed apathetic. He walked
with dragging feet. However, in front of his foe he came awake with
fierce energy. Iron Mike Costigan was dark, with tousled black
hair. Five feet eleven, and heavier than Brennon, what he lacked in
lithe ranginess he made up in oak and iron massiveness.</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men burned into each other with savage
intensity. Volcanic blue for Costigan; cold steel gray for Brennon.
Their sun-browned faces were set in unconscious snarls. But as they
stood facing each other, Brennon's stare of concentrated cold
ferocity wavered and fell momentarily before Costigan's savage blue
eyes. I realized that this was the first man who had ever looked
Mike down, and I thought of Corbett staring down Sullivan&mdash;of
McGovern's eyes falling before Young Corbett's.</p>

<p>Then the men were back in their corners, and the seconds and
handlers were climbing through the ropes. I hissed to Mike that I
was going to throw in the sponge if the going got too rough, but he
made no reply. He seemed to have sunk into that strange apathy
again.</p>

<p><i>The gong!</i>
</p>

<p>Costigan hurtled from his corner, a compact bulk of fighting
fury. Brennon came out more slowly. At my side Ganlon hissed:
"What's the matter with Mike? He acts like he was drunk!"</p>

<p>The two Iron Mikes had met in the center of the ring. Costigan
might have been slightly awed by the fame of the man he faced. At
any rate he hesitated. Brennon walked toward his foe, but his feet
dragged.</p>

<p>Then Costigan suddenly launched an attack, and shot a straight
left to Brennon's face. As if the blow had roused him to his full
tigerish fury, Mike went into action. The old sweeping haymakers
began to thunder with all their ancient power. Costigan had, of
course, no defense. A sweeping left-hander crashed under his heart
with a sound like a caulking mallet striking a ship's side; a
blasting right that whistled through the air, cannon-balled against
his jaw. Costigan went down as though struck by a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Then even as the crowd rose, he reeled up again. But I was
watching Brennon. As though that sudden burst of action had taken
all the strength out of him, he sagged against the ropes, limp,
cloudy-eyed. Now sensing that his foe was up, he dragged himself
forward with halting and uncertain motions.</p>

<p>Costigan, still dizzy from that terrific knockdown, was
conscious of only one urge&mdash;the old instinct of the iron
man&mdash;bore in and hit until somebody falls! Now he crashed
through Brennon's groping arms and shot a right hook to the chin.
Brennon swayed and fell, just as a drunken man falls when a prop
against which he has been leaning is removed.</p>

<p>Over his motionless form the referee was counting: "Eight! Nine!
Ten!" And the ring career of Iron Mike Brennon was at an end. A
stunned silence reigned, and Iron Mike Costigan, new king of all
iron men, leaned against the ropes, unable to believe his senses.
<i>Mike Brennon had been knocked out!</i></p>

<p>Around the ring the typewriters of the reporters were ticking
out the fall of a king: "Evidently Mike Brennon's famous iron jaw
has at last turned to crockery after years of incredible
bombardings..."</p>

<p>We carried Mike, still senseless, to his dressing-room. Ganlon
was muttering under his breath, and as soon as we had Mike safe on
a cot with a physician looking to him, the middleweight vanished.
Marjory had been waiting for us and now she stood, white-faced and
silent, by the cot where her lover lay.</p>

<p>At last he opened his eyes, and instantly he leaped erect, hands
up. Then he halted, swayed and rubbed his eyes. Marjory was at his
side in an instant and gently forced him back on the cot.</p>

<p>"What happened? Did I win?" he asked dazedly.</p>

<p>"You were knocked out in the first round, Mike." I felt it
better to answer him directly. His eyes widened with amazement.</p>

<p>"I? Knocked out? Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mike, you were," I assured him, expecting him to do any of
the things I have seen fighters do on learning of their first
knock-out&mdash;weep terribly, faint, rave and curse, or rush out
looking for the conqueror. But being Mike Brennon and a
never-to-be-solved enigma, he did none of these things. He merely
rubbed his chin and laughed cynically.</p>

<p>"Guess I'd gone farther back than I thought. I don't remember
the punch that put me out; funny thing&mdash;I've come through my
last fight without a mark."</p>

<p>"And now you'll quit!" cried Marjory. "This is the best thing
that could have happened to you. You promised you'd quit if you
were knocked out, Mike." Her voice was painful in its
intensity.</p>

<p>"Why, I wouldn't draw half a house now," Mike was beginning
ruefully, when Ganlon burst in, eyes blazing.</p>

<p>"Mike!" he snarled. "Steve! Don't you two boneheads see there's
somethin' wrong here? Mike, when did you begin feelin' drowsy?"</p>

<p>Brennon started. "That's right. I'd forgotten. I began feeling
queer when I climbed in the ring. I sort of woke up when the
referee was talking to us, and I remember how Costigan's eyes
blazed. Then when I went back to my corner I got dizzy and drunken.
Then I knew I was moving out in the ring and I saw Costigan through
a fog. He hit me a hummer and I woke up and started swinging and
saw him go down. That's the last I remember until I came to
here."</p>

<p>Ganlon laughed bitterly. "Sure. You was out on your feet before
Costigan hit you. A girl coulda pushed you over, and that's all
Costigan done!"</p>

<p>"Doped!" I cried. "Costigan's crowd&mdash;or the gambling
ring&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Naw&mdash;Mike's been crossed by the last person you'd think
of. I been doin' some detective work. Mike, just before you left
your dressin'-room, you drunk a small cup of tea, didn't you? Kinda
unusual preparation for a hard fight, eh? But you drunk it to
please somebody&mdash;"</p>

<p>Marjory was cowering in the corner. Mike was troubled and
puzzled.</p>

<p>"But Spike, Marjory made that tea herself&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Yeah, and she doped it herself! She framed you to
lose!</i>"</p>

<p>Our eyes turned on the shrinking girl&mdash;amazement in mine,
anger in Ganlon's, and a deep hurt in Mike's.</p>

<p>"Marjory, why did you do that?" asked Mike, bewildered. "I might
have won&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, you might have won!" she cried in a sudden gust of
desperate and despairing defiance. "After Costigan had battered you
to a red ruin! Yes, I drugged the tea. It's my fault you were
knocked out. You can't go back now, for you've lost your only
attraction. You can't draw the crowds. I've gone through tortures
since I first saw you lying on that cot after your fight with
Slade&mdash;but you've only laughed at me. Now you'll have to quit.
You're out of the game with a sound mind&mdash;that's all I care.
I've saved you from your mad avarice and cruel pride in spite of
yourself! And you can beat me now, or kill me&mdash;I don't
care!"</p>

<p>For a moment she stood panting before us, her small fists
clenched, then as no one spoke, all the fire went out of her. She
wilted visibly and moved droopingly and forlornly toward the door.
The wrap which enveloped her slender form, slid to the floor as she
fumbled at the door-knob, revealing her in a cheap gingham dress.
Mike, like a man awakening from a trance, started forward:</p>

<p>"Marjory! Where are you going? What are you doing in that
rig?"</p>

<p>"It's the dress I was wearing when you first met me," she
answered listlessly, "I wrote and got back my old job at the
cafe."</p>

<p>He crossed the room with one stride, caught her slim shoulders
and spun her around to face him, with unconsciously brutal force.
"What do you mean?" he said.</p>

<p>She collapsed suddenly in a storm of weeping. "Don't you hate me
for drugging you?" she sobbed. "I didn't think you'd ever want to
see me again."</p>

<p>He crushed her to him hungrily. "Girl, I swear I didn't realize
how it was hurting you. I thought you were foolish&mdash;willful. I
couldn't see how you were suffering. But you've opened my eyes. I
must have been insane! You're right&mdash;it was
pride&mdash;senseless vanity&mdash;I couldn't see it then, but I do
now. I didn't understand that I was ruining your happiness. And
that's all that matters now, dear. We've got our life and love
before us, and if it rests with me, you're going to be happy all
the rest of your life."</p>

<p>Ganlon beckoned me and I followed him out. For the only time
since I had known him, Mike's hard face had softened. The sentiment
that lies at the base of the Irish nature, however deeply hidden
sometimes, made his steely eyes almost tender.</p>

<p>"I had her down all wrong," Ganlon said softly. "I take back
everything I might have said about her. She's a regular&mdash;and
Mike&mdash;well, he's the only iron man I ever knew that got the
right breaks at last."</p>
