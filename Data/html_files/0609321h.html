<h2>THE LIGHTHOUSE ON SHIVERING SAND</h2>

<h4>by</h4>

<h3>J. S. Fletcher</h3>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>When Mordecai Chiddock came to join the lighthouse staff on
Shivering Sand, Jezreel Cornish was taking his allowance of
sleep, and Chiddock,</p>

<p>being new to the place, did not know who it was he would meet
when Cornish woke up. Otherwise, the boat which had brought him
and a month's provisions over from the mainland would never have
gone back without him.</p>

<p>Until Chiddock came we had never been more than two at the
Shivering Sand. That was a bad arrangement, of course, and it was
I who got the worst of it. Once Reuben Cleary fell sick, and had
to take to his bed. That was just after the monthly boat had
been, and until it came again I had to work night and day and
nurse him into the bargain. Then there was Pharaoh Nanjulian; he
was a melancholy sort from his youth, and the loneliness and
monotony affected his brain. His wits gave out at last, and he
used to spend the whole day in singing psalms and hymns, and
preaching to the sea-birds. We had great storms that autumn, and
the monthly boat came a fortnight late, and found me about done
for, what with living day and night with a madman, and doing work
for two. And it was because of what I said&mdash;not mincing
matters&mdash;that it was decided to send a third man, so that in
such cases as those of Cleary and Nanjulian the other man should
not be utterly and badly alone.</p>

<p>Chiddock was the man who was sent. Of course, neither Cornish
nor myself knew who would be sent; all we knew was that the
September boat would bring a third keeper off with it.</p>

<p>It was a fine, bright morning when he came, and I watched him
narrowly as he came on to the platform at the foot of the
lighthouse, which you could only make at certain times. He was a
thick-set, swarthy man of middle age; he had curling black hair
and beard, and his eyes were shiftier than I cared about.
However, he bade me good morning civilly enough, and when he had
got his own things up from the boat, gave me a ready hand with
the month's stores. It was not till the boat was off again that
he seemed disposed for conversation.</p>

<p>"My name's Chiddock," he says. "Mordecai Chiddock."</p>

<p>"Mine's John Graburn," I answered him.</p>

<p>He offered me a plug of tobacco, and took a sort of
comprehensive glance all around him.</p>

<p>"This," he says, "is a lonelier place than most of 'em."</p>

<p>"You'll make all the more company," I says. "There'll be three
of us now."</p>

<p>He gave a glance at the door at the top of the stone stairway,
as if he expected to see the third man appear.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "and what sort of shipmate is the other
partner?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's all right," said I, off-hand. "He's only been here
this last month, but he's a decent man, is Jezreel."</p>

<p>Chiddock turned round on me like a flash, and I saw a queer
look come into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Jezreel!" he said, short and sharp-like. "That's an uncommon
name. I knew a man of that name once. This man's other name, what
might it be, now, Graburn?"</p>

<p>"Cornish," I answered, "Jezreel Cornish."</p>

<p>Then I knew that something was amiss, for his cheeks lost all
their dark colour and turned a strange pasty white, and I saw
sweat burst out on them. He came a step nearer and looked at me
with burning eyes, and his lips quivered under his black
moustache.</p>

<p>"Jezreel Cornish!" he says, almost in a whisper. "Jezreel
Cornish! A tallish, scraggy-built man with a long, sharp nose and
red hair and ferrety eyes; is it a man like that?"</p>

<p>"And what if it is?" I said, watching him.</p>

<p>He drew a long breath, and, turning, looked out across the bay
after the boat from the mainland, as if he would call her back.
But she was already a speck in the distance, and he turned again
to me, breathing hard.</p>

<p>"If it is," he says, muttering his words, "if it is,
mister&mdash;well, then, I wish I was in that craft out there, or
on shore, or anywhere, that's all. Jezreel Cornish&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>I saw his face suddenly change from white to red, and from red
to white, and, turning, there was Cornish himself coming down the
stairs, yawning and stretching after his sleep. And quick as
lightning the newcomer's hand went round to his hip-pocket, and I
guessed what he had there.</p>

<p>"If that's a pistol you've got," I says, sharp and quick, "you
can leave it where it is. I'm boss here, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He seemed to give no more heed to me than if I had been a
child, and he kept his eyes on Cornish with the watchfulness of a
dog that expects a blow. And I turned then to look at Cornish,
wondering what it was that was about to happen.</p>

<p>He was not a quick man at noticing things, Cornish, and he had
got to the foot of the stairs before he looked fully at Chiddock.
But when he looked, I saw all the colour go out of his face, too,
and when it came back it was a sort of dark red, and there was
that in his eyes which meant murder. He crouched his body up and
together, as an animal does when it's going to spring, and he
came forward with his sharp teeth showing under his ragged red
moustache; and I knew then that I was going to have a troublous
time before the boat came again. For these two, Chiddock and
Cornish, stood glaring at each other for all the world like wild
beasts that are mad to be at grips, and I could see that it
needed but a word to let hell loose between them.</p>

<p>Cornish was the first to speak, and I shouldn't have known his
voice; it was so changed and so awful. And it was to me that he
spoke, and not to Chiddock.</p>

<p>"Is this the new keeper, Graburn?" says he. "Am I looking at
him?"</p>

<p>"You are," I says, "and not any pleasanter than he's looking
at you, Jezreel Cornish. And I'm not so blind that I can't see
that there's black, cruel, bad blood between you two, and I tell
you I'll have none of that sort of thing here; so mind your
manners, both of you."</p>

<p>"And he'll be here with us, night and day, shut up with us on
Shivering Sand!" says Cornish, watching Chiddock with the eyes of
a hungry devil. "Shut up on Shivering Sand, and with me!"</p>

<p>"And with me, and both of you under my orders!" I rapped out
sternly. "And I'll see that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cornish spat on the ground at his feet.</p>

<p>"Last time I set eyes on your devil's face, Mordecai
Chiddock," he says, in a voice that had suddenly turned as mild
as milk, "I told you I'd murder you when the time came for my
chance. It's come! I've got you to myself now, and by God above,
I'll kill you!"</p>

<p>What next happened was over in a flash. For Chiddock suddenly
whipped the revolver out of his pocket and had Cornish covered.
But before he could shoot I knocked it out of his hand, and the
next instant had kicked it clean over the edge of the rock into
the sea. And with that Chiddock suddenly turned more frightened
than before, and it seemed to me that he was going to whimper
like a child whose nurse has just checked it.</p>

<p>But Cornish only laughed in a sniggering, sneering fashion,
and he turned away from us and went slowly up the stairway into
the lighthouse, leaving Chiddock standing there before me with
his limbs trembling as if he'd suddenly got the ague, and his
damp face whiter than ever. When he spoke his voice was as
spiritless as could be, and I saw the man was badly
frightened.</p>

<p>"You've left me defenceless, Mr. Graburn," he says, in a
queer-sounding voice. "He'll kill me!"</p>

<p>"There's going to be no killing while I'm about here, my man,"
I answered; "and you'd best tell me what all this is about.
There's a blood feud between you?"</p>

<p>But, instead of answering me directly, he began to talk and
murmur to himself, and I could make nothing of what I overheard;
and all the time he talked his eyes, as restless as a freshly
trapped animal's, were searching the sea all round us, as if he
hoped to signal some vessel to come and take him off.</p>

<p>"There's no living soul will come to this rock until the boat
comes a month hence, Chiddock," says I. "You can make up your
mind to that. So if you want me to help you you'd best to speak,
quick."</p>

<p>He turned then, and glowered at me with a sullen rage burning
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't treated me as you have," he said, nodding
towards the spot where the revolver had gone, "I'd have shot him
there and then, and been free of him. As it is, you'll have to
stand between us."</p>

<p>"Jezreel Cornish has no firearms," I said. "There's nothing on
the rock but an old fowling-piece, and the powder and shot are in
my care, and nobody but me can come at them."</p>

<p>Now, this was not strictly true, because I had a revolver of
my own carefully hidden away for emergencies; but I was not going
to let anybody know of it. However, Chiddock seemed to think
nothing of what I had just said.</p>

<p>"He'll kill me," he repeated, "and it'll be murder on your
part if you let him! You'll have to get me away, Mr. Graburn; and
till you do, how will I get meat or sleep? I'm hungry and thirsty
now."</p>

<p>"It strikes me you're a coward!" says I. "Sit you down while I
go up and see what Cornish can tell me about this."</p>

<p>He sat himself down on a rock as obediently as a child might,
and I climbed the stair and made into our living-room, where I
found Cornish eating and drinking as unconcernedly as if nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>"Now then, Cornish," I says, sitting down between him and the
door, "what's all this about? I'm headkeeper here, and I'm going
to know what you're after."</p>

<p>"What I'm after," he says, coolly, "is killing that man
outside, which I shall surely do. There's no hurry. The last time
I met him I told him what I should do, and I should have done it
then, but he was too cunning, and gave me the slip. That he
cannot do this time. He can't swim to the mainland, and he can't
fly; he's netted. I can bide my time, but he'll never go off this
rock alive!"</p>

<p>"What's he done to you?" I asked him. "As you're so candid
about killing him, you might as well be candid about the crime
you've got against him."</p>

<p>Before he answered he cut himself a great slab of the corned
beef he was eating, and ate heartily of it, just as if he hadn't
a trouble in the world.</p>

<p>"That man," he said at last, nodding towards the open door,
through which you could see a patch of dancing sea, "that man
isn't a man at all; he's a devil! A low, mean, black devil, Mr.
Graburn. Him and me was shipmates once, and we were in Valparaiso
together, and there we made a nice bit of money&mdash;never mind
how. I was struck down with a bad fever; the last thing I
remembered was trusting him with my money, and his promising to
send most of it home to my wife in England. Then the deliriums
came on, and I never knew any more until I came to in a charity
hospital. The skunk had taken all I had and left me. What's more,
he sailed home to England, found my wife, got her to sell up the
home and a bit of a little shop she'd got together on pretence of
sending the money to me, and persuaded her to trust him with the
sending of it&mdash;which, naturally, he never did. And when I
did come home, my wife was dead&mdash;died in the workhouse,
where I found the kids. And, of course, I've got to kill
him!"</p>

<p>"If all you say's true, Cornish," I said, "he deserves more
than that. But I'll have no killing here, understand, now!"</p>

<p>"I don't say that I'll kill him to-day, or to-morrow," he
says, paying no more heed to me than if I hadn't been there. "Any
time'll do me, now that he's trapped. I'll play with him as a cat
plays with a mouse. I'll make him as he can't sleep o' nights
with fear that death's close on him. I shall enjoy thinking what
way I'll kill him; I'll invent something good!"</p>

<p>"I'm inclined to think trouble and anger have turned your
brain, Cornish," says I.</p>

<p>"You can think what you're pleased to think," he says, still
as cold in his manner as a jelly-fish, "but you'll see Mordecai
Chiddock's corpse before the boat comes again."</p>

<p>"If his living body's turned into a corpse by you, Jezreel
Cornish," says I, "you'll only swing for it."</p>

<p>He laughed at that in his sneering fashion.</p>

<p>The sound of it made me frightened, for I could not bring
myself to decide whether the man was in his right mind or gone
out of his senses like Pharaoh Nanjulian.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have a chance of escape," I said.</p>

<p>"Who says I wanted one?" he says. "Since I found my wife dead
in the workhouse I've only lived to kill Mordecai Chiddock. And I
say you shall see his corpse, Mr. Graburn&mdash;and I don't care
if you see mine after you've seen his. But I tell you, once for
all, I'll kill him!"</p>

<p>I left him sitting there, still eating, and went down to the
rocks again, to find Chiddock where I had left him. He turned
round on me with fright in his eyes.</p>

<p>"If what I've heard about you is true," I said, "you're the
lowest-down scoundrel I ever heard of, Chiddock. Death's too good
for you, it's too easy. You ought to be skinned alive!"</p>

<p>"I knew that you'd side with him!" he growled. "But it'll be
found out, and it'll be murder against the two of you&mdash;mind
you that, mister."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me," says I, and put down at his side some
victuals and drink that I had brought out with me. "And in the
meantime," I says, "get that food into you and be more of a
man."</p>

<p>He made no reply to that, but fell upon the victuals like a
famished wolf, while I turned back again to the lighthouse. I had
a notion in my head, and I was going to put it into shape at
once.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to keep these two men apart. That
Cornish would kill Chiddock I now had no doubt&mdash;no more than
that Chiddock would have killed Cornish if I had not knocked the
revolver out of his hand. Now, that revolver had given me an
idea. I, being the only man of the three with a weapon, was
certainly master of the situation. And accordingly, as soon as I
re-entered the lighthouse, I went to my own chamber, secured and
loaded my revolver, and turned into the living-room to speak,
with authority, to Jezreel Cornish.</p>

<p>Jezreel had finished his eating, but he still sat at his end
of the table, staring moodily at the empty plate. I sat down at
the other end; when he at last looked up it was to look straight
into the barrel of the revolver.</p>

<p>"What's&mdash;what's the meaning of that?" he growled.</p>

<p>"The meaning, Jezreel, my lad, is that," says I, "I'm master
here in more ways than one, but especially because I'm the only
man of the three that's got a weapon. Now, you and the man
outside are not going to meet. It's your turn for duty; you'll go
up that stair, and I shall lock you in. When it's your hour for
coming off I'll let you out; but you'll not see him, because
he'll be locked up, too, until you're locked in your own chamber.
You and him, Cornish, are going to do all the work this next
month; I'm going to do nothing but play gaoler and cook until the
boat comes and takes one of you off. Now you can just go up to
your duty, and I'll draw the bolt on you. Get under way,
Cornish!"</p>

<p>"And what if I don't?" he says, looking ugly.</p>

<p>"There's no ifs in this case," says I. "Come!"</p>

<p>He stared hard at me and the revolver for a good minute, then
he pushed back his chair and got up.</p>

<p>"I want some tobacco out of the cupboard," he says. "I suppose
I can get that?"</p>

<p>"You can get what you like out of the cupboard," I answered
him, "so long as you get upstairs thereafter. And remember I've
got the drop on you, Cornish."</p>

<p>He mumbled something that I couldn't catch, and going over to
the cupboard where we kept our general stores, went in. He
mumbled and grumbled all the time he was in the cupboard, and his
face was angry and scowling when he came out. But he marched
straight off to the door of the winding stair which led up to the
lantern, and in another second I had turned the key on him.</p>

<p>Now, I ought to tell you what this lighthouse was like. Some
fifteen miles from the mainland, it stood on a gaunt, bare rock
which rose behind a permanent bank in the sea, that had long been
known as the Shivering Sand because of the strange motion of the
water over it. The entrance was gained by a stone stairway, which
led to a double door some twenty feet above the rock; when you
passed that door you found yourself in the living-room, which
made a half of the circular space of the lighthouse; the other
half was divided into four segments, each forming separate
chambers. A winding stair went out of the living-room into an
upper room, which we used for stores, material, and such-like;
where it passed from one to the other was a strong door, the one
that I had secured against Cornish's descent.</p>

<p>Above that was a stair of eighty-nine steps to the lamp-room
and lantern, from which a revolving light shone out to warn all
craft away from us.</p>

<p>So long as I was master I saw no difficulty in keeping
Chiddock and Cornish separate. Every door in the place was fitted
with good strong locks; on Cornish's I resolved to fit a bolt
from a store of hardware which I had by me. Before I released one
man from duty I would lock the other in his room; when the
released man was safely locked up I would let the other out.</p>

<p>All this being settled, and Cornish safely secured, I went to
the door and called to Chiddock, telling him that it would now be
safe for him to enter. He came to the foot of the stairway,
cringing and fearful; the more I saw of him the more I knew what
an arrant coward he was. As things turned out I had to go halfway
down the stair and explain what I had done before he would
consent to gather his things together and come up.</p>

<p>"Now then, Chiddock," I said, showing him his chamber, "this
is your room. You know the arrangement. You came here to do one
turn of work in three, as things are you'll do one in two. And
keep to what I've arranged, or I'll let Jezreel Cornish loose on
you."</p>

<p>"He'll not forgive you for baulking him," he muttered. "Look
to yourself, mister. You did me a bad turn in knocking that
revolver away. I know Cornish when he's roused."</p>

<p>I made no answer to that, but went about the job of fixing the
bolt on the outside of Cornish's door. And with this and other
things the afternoon passed quietly, and at the usual time I
began to busy myself in making ready for supper.</p>

<p>Mordecai Chiddock sat watching me as if he meant to eat all
that I was preparing for the table. For a man in his position and
under such fear, he was the hungriest man I ever met, and when we
sat down he fell upon the food and the hot coffee as if he had
tasted nothing for years.</p>

<p>It gave me no pleasure to sit at meat with a man who had
robbed his mate and his mate's wife and children, and I soon got
up and left him to finish, after which I served out our usual
allowance of rum. I made no answer when he gave me some sort of
pledge or toast; instead, I carried my tot into my own chamber
and sat down on my bunk to drink it at my leisure. After that I
remember lying down for my usual forty winks and feeling more
than usually sleepy, and then I remember nothing until I woke to
find myself staring at Jezreel Cornish, whose sharp nose and
ferrety eyes were very close to my face. It did not take a moment
to realise that I was bound about arms and shoulders with a rope
that pressed somewhat unpleasantly, and that my revolver was in
Cornish's right hand.</p>

<p>"You made a mistake in letting me go to that cupboard,
Graburn," he said, sneering at me. "I drugged the coffee and the
rum.</p>

<p>"And as for locking me up like a gaolbird, you forgot that a
man like me thinks nothing of coming down a hundred-foot rope. I
told you I should kill Mordecai Chiddock."</p>

<p>"You've murdered him!" I gasped.</p>

<p>"I'm murdering him," he says, as cool as ever. "He's a-staring
at his death in the face. I'm a merciful man, Graburn, I'm giving
him time to repent. Come and see him die. And&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>He suddenly menaced me so meaningly with the revolver that I
struggled to my feet and let him half-pull, half-thrust me from
the room. He forced me across the living-room, and through the
double door, and down the stair upon the plateau of rock into the
brightest and silverest moonlight I ever remember&mdash;a night
so calm and still and beautiful that you'd have wondered any
human being could have had anything but good thoughts in his
heart between then and sunrise. But Jezreel Cornish was no longer
a human being; the devil had taken possession of him.</p>

<p>"Come and see Mordecai Chiddock being a-murdered of, Graburn,"
he said, chuckling as if it was all a joke. "Come and hear him
a-begging and a-praying for mercy&mdash;Mordecai what never had
no mercy on man nor woman! Come, I tell you!" and he dragged me
along as if I had been no more than an infant. "Now look at
Mordecai Chiddock, a-facing of his death like the brave sailorman
he is!"</p>

<p>From the point to which he dragged me I could see all the
devilish ingenuity of what Cornish had done. In the outline of
the rock on which Shivering Sand Lighthouse stood there was a
crescent-shaped indentation which might have been cut through as
you cut into a cheese with a tin scoop. We stood on the edge of
one side of this; on the other, dangling from ropes which had
been fastened about his waist and under his armpits, the bright
moonlight shining full upon him, hung Mordecai Chiddock, a
swaying, trembling figure against the silent, pitiless rock
behind him.</p>

<p>And he was up to his waist in the advancing tide, and he would
soon be submerged and drowned!</p>

<p>I felt myself seized with a sudden fury at the sight of this
specimen of Cornish's cruelty, and turned on him with a feeling
that would have manifested itself in an attack on him if I had
not been bound.</p>

<p>"You devil!" I cried. "You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he raised the revolver, and for a second I thought my time
was come.</p>

<p>"Keep a civil tongue, Mr. Graburn," he said, sullenly. "It
doesn't much matter to me whether you live or die, but I don't
want to murder you. After all, I'm not murdering Chiddock; I'm
carrying out justice on him. Nice to hear him, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The wretch swinging in the rising sea not ten yards in front
of us had caught sight of me and burst into frantic entreaties
for help. But these entreaties were mingled with the most awful
curses and blasphemies I had ever heard, and suddenly Cornish
began to add a demoniac laughter and jeering to them.</p>

<p>There was nothing but Chiddock's head left above the waves at
last. I knew exactly where the water would rise to, and that in
another five minutes he would have gone. And Cornish knew that
too, and an idea seemed to strike him. He laughed aloud&mdash;a
devilish laugh that made my blood turn to ice.</p>

<p>"He's only a few minutes left," he said, "I'll go nearer and
whisper a few words of parting to him. It'll be a friendly thing
to remind him of what a lot of friends he'll meet presently."</p>

<p>He made off towards the point where Chiddock was hanging, with
the evident intention of calling over the edge into the wretched
man's very ears.</p>

<p>As he came near, just as if Providence had it in mind that he
should be cheated of seeing his victim die, he tripped over the
rope by which Chiddock was secured. He pitched head foremost over
the edge of the rock, and I heard his head strike on the ledge
beneath, and saw him cleave the oily-faced water like a plummet.
And after that neither I nor any man ever saw Jezreel Cornish
again.</p>

<p>It was then that I fainted, hearing a long cry of final
despair from Chiddock. It may have been unconsciousness rather
than fainting&mdash;it was long after daybreak when I came round.
I crawled to the edge of the rock, and looked into the cove.
Chiddock hung limp against the rock, his head dangling on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>I could do nothing to help myself; Cornish had made certain in
securing me. During the day I contrived to drag myself into
shelter against the fierce sunlight, but I almost went mad with
hunger and thirst and horror of my situation. That night no light
shone out from the Shivering Sand. But its failure saved me, for
the darkened lighthouse roused suspicion, and before midnight a
fast Government vessel was at the rock to find one dead man
hanging over the waves where another was tossing, and a man who
was not far from dead, and utterly delirious, babbling
incoherently of what he had seen.</p>
