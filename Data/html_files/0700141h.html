<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="adedi">DEDICATION.</a></b><P>

&nbsp; &nbsp; BOB SOUTHEY! You're a poet--Poet-laureate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And representative of all the race,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although't is true that you turn'd out a Tory at<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Last,--yours has lately been a common case;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now, my Epic Renegade! what are ye at?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all the Lakers, in and out of place?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A nest of tuneful persons, to my eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like 'four and twenty Blackbirds in a pye;'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Which pye being open'd they began to sing'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (This old song and new simile holds good),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'A dainty dish to set before the King,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or Regent, who admires such kind of food;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Coleridge, too, has lately taken wing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But like a hawk encumber'd with his hood,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Explaining metaphysics to the nation--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish he would explain his Explanation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You, Bob! are rather insolent, you know,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At being disappointed in your wish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To supersede all warblers here below,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And be the only Blackbird in the dish;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then you overstrain yourself, or so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tumble downward like the flying fish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gasping on deck, because you soar too high, Bob,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fall, for lack of moisture, quite a-dry, Bob!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Wordsworth, in a rather long Excursion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (I think the quarto holds five hundred pages),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Has given a sample from the vasty version<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his new system to perplex the sages;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is poetry--at least by his assertion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And may appear so when the dog-star rages--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And he who understands it would be able<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To add a story to the Tower of Babel.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You--Gentlemen! by dint of long seclusion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From better company, have kept your own<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At Keswick, and, through still continued fusion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of one another's minds, at last have grown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To deem as a most logical conclusion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Poesy has wreaths for you alone:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a narrowness in such a notion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which makes me wish you'd change your lakes for ocean.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I would not imitate the petty thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For all the glory your conversion brought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since gold alone should not have been its price.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You have your salary; was't for that you wrought?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You're shabby fellows--true--but poets still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And duly seated on the immortal hill.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your bays may hide the baldness of your brows---<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps some virtuous blushes;--let them go---<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs---<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for the fame you would engross below,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The field is universal, and allows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe will try<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Gainst you the question with posterity.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contend not with you on the winged steed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fame you envy and the skill you need;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And recollect a poet nothing loses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In giving to his brethren their full meed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of merit, and complaint of present days<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is not the certain path to future praise.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He that reserves his laurels for posterity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Who does not often claim the bright reversion)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Has generally no great crop to spare it, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being only injured by his own assertion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And although here and there some glorious rarity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The major part of such appelants go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To--God knows where--for no one else can know.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If, fallen in evil days on evil tongues,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Milton appeal'd to the Avenger, Time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If Time, the Avenger, execrates his wrongs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And makes the word Miltonic' mean'sublime,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He deign'd not to belie his soul in songs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor turn his very talent to a crime;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He did not loathe the Sire to laud the Son,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Think'st thou, could he--the blind Old Man--arise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Samuel from the grave, to freeze once more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The blood of monarchs with his prophecies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or be alive again--again all hoar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With time and trials, and those helpless eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And heartless daughters--worn--and pale--and poor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would he adore a sultan? he obey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Cold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Transferr'd to gorge upon a sister shore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The vulgarest tool that Tyranny could want,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With just enough of talent, and no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To lengthen fetters by another fix'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And offer poison long already mix'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An orator of such set trash of phrase<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ineffably--legitimately vile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor foes--all nations--condescend to smile,---<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not even a sprightly blunder's spark can blaze<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That turns and turns to give the world a notion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of endless torments and perpetual motion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A bungler even in its disgusting trade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And botching, patching, leaving still behind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Something of which its masters are afraid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; States to be curb'd and thoughts to be confined,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Conspiracy or Congress to be made--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cobbling at manacles for all mankind--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With God and man's abhorrence for its gains.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If we may judge of matter by the mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Emasculated to the marrow It<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hath but two objects, how to serve and bind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Eutropius of its many masters,--blind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fearless--because no feeling dwells in ice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its very courage stagnates to a vice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where shall I turn me not to view its bonds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I will never feel them?--Italy!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beneath the lie this State-thing breathed o'er thee--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thy clanking chain, and Erin's yet green wounds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have voices, tongues to cry aloud for me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Europe has slaves, allies, kings, armies still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Southey lives to sing them very ill.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In honest simple verse, this song to you.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, if in flattering strains I do not predicate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is that I still retain my 'buff and blue;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My politics as yet are all to educate:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Apostasy's so fashionable, too,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To keep one creed's a task grown quite Herculean;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; VENICE, September 16, 1818.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="ai">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CANTO THE FIRST.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I WANT a hero: an uncommon want,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When every year and month sends forth a new one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The age discovers he is not the true one;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We all have seen him, in the pantomime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Followers of fame, 'nine farrow' of that sow:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; France, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were French, and famous people, as we know:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With many of the military set,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exceedingly remarkable at times,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But not at all adapted to my rhymes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nelson was once Britannia's god of war,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's no more to be said of Trafalgar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is with our hero quietly inurn'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because the army's grown more popular,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At which the naval people are concern'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Brave men were living before Agamemnon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And since, exceeding valorous and sage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But then they shone not on the poet's page,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so have been forgotten:--I condemn none,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But can't find any in the present age<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So, as I said, I 'll take my friend Don Juan.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most epic poets plunge 'in medias res'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What went before--by way of episode,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While seated after dinner at his ease,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beside his mistress in some soft abode,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is the usual method, but not mine--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My way is to begin with the beginning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The regularity of my design<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore I shall open with a line<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Although it cost me half an hour in spinning)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And also of his mother, if you 'd rather.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Famous for oranges and women--he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who has not seen it will be much to pity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So says the proverb--and I quite agree;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cadiz perhaps--but that you soon may see;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A noble stream, and call'd the Guadalquivir.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His father's name was Jose--Don, of course,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A true Hidalgo, free from every stain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than Jose, who begot our hero, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Begot--but that's to come--Well, to renew:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His mother was a learned lady, famed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For every branch of every science known<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In every Christian language ever named,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With virtues equall'd by her wit alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And even the good with inward envy groan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finding themselves so very much exceeded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In their own way by all the things that she did.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All Calderon and greater part of Lope,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that if any actor miss'd his part<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She could have served him for the prompter's copy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For her Feinagle's were an useless art,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he himself obliged to shut up shop--he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could never make a memory so fine as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That which adorn'd the brain of Donna Inez.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her favourite science was the mathematical,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In short, in all things she was fairly what I call<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A prodigy--her morning dress was dimity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She knew the Latin--that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Greek--the alphabet--I 'm nearly sure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She read some French romances here and there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although her mode of speaking was not pure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For native Spanish she had no great care,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least her conversation was obscure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She liked the English and the Hebrew tongue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said there was analogy between 'em;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She proved it somehow out of sacred song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I must leave the proofs to those who 've seen 'em;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this I heard her say, and can't be wrong<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all may think which way their judgments lean 'em,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ''T is strange--the Hebrew noun which means "I am,"<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some women use their tongues--she look'd a lecture,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An all-in-all sufficient self-director,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose suicide was almost an anomaly--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One sad example more, that 'All is vanity'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity').<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In short, she was a walking calculation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or 'Coelebs' Wife' set out in quest of lovers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Morality's prim personification,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To others' share let 'female errors fall,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For she had not even one--the worst of all.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh! she was perfect past all parallel--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of any modern female saint's comparison;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So far above the cunning powers of hell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even her minutest motions went as well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save thine 'incomparable oil,' Macassar!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perfect she was, but as perfection is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insipid in this naughty world of ours,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where our first parents never learn'd to kiss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Went plucking various fruit without her leave.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a mortal of the careless kind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With no great love for learning, or the learn'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And never dream'd his lady was concern'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world, as usual, wickedly inclined<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To see a kingdom or a house o'erturn'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whisper'd he had a mistress, some said two--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But for domestic quarrels one will do.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A great opinion of her own good qualities;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then she had a devil of a spirit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And let few opportunities escape<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This was an easy matter with a man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And even the wisest, do the best they can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And why and wherefore no one understands.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is pity learned virgins ever wed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With persons of no sort of education,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grow tired of scientific conversation:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't choose to say much upon this head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm a plain man, and in a single station,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But--Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Jose and his lady quarrell'd--why,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not any of the many could divine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though several thousand people chose to try,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I loathe that low vice--curiosity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But if there's anything in which I shine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not having of my own domestic cares.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so I interfered, and with the best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think the foolish people were possess'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For neither of them could I ever find,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although their porter afterwards confess'd--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that's no matter, and the worst's behind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A pail of housemaid's water unawares.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And mischief-making monkey from his birth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His parents ne'er agreed except in doting<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To school, or had him soundly whipp'd at home,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To teach him manners for the time to come.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Jose and the Donna Inez led<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For some time an unhappy sort of life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They lived respectably as man and wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gave no outward signs of inward strife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until at length the smother'd fire broke out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And put the business past all kind of doubt.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Inez call'd some druggists and physicians,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as he had some lucid intermissions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She next decided he was only bad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet when they ask'd her for her depositions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No sort of explanation could be had,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save that her duty both to man and God<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Required this conduct--which seem'd very odd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And open'd certain trunks of books and letters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then she had all Seville for abettors,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hearers of her case became repeaters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some for amusement, others for old grudges.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then this best and weakest woman bore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With such serenity her husband's woes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Never to say a word about them more--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And saw his agonies with such sublimity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is philosophic in our former friends;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The more so in obtaining our own ends;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conduct like this by no means comprehends;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Revenge in person's certainly no virtue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And help them with a lie or two additional,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm not to blame, as you well know--no more is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Any one else--they were become traditional;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, their resurrection aids our glories<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And science profits by this resurrection--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their friends had tried at reconciliation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then their relations, who made matters worse.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom it may be best to have recourse--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't say much for friend or yet relation):<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But scarce a fee was paid on either side<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He died: and most unluckily, because,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to all hints I could collect<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From counsel learned in those kinds of laws<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Although their talk's obscure and circumspect),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thousand pities also with respect<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To public feeling, which on this occasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was manifested in a great sensation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, ah! he died; and buried with him lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His house was sold, his servants sent away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A Jew took one of his two mistresses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A priest the other--at least so they say:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I ask'd the doctors after his disease--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And left his widow to her own aversion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet Jose was an honourable man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I must say who knew him very well;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore his frailties I 'll no further scan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed there were not many more to tell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if his passions now and then outran<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Discretion, and were not so peaceable<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let's own--since it can do no good on earth--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was a trying moment that which found him<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No choice was left his feelings or his pride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save death or Doctors' Commons--so he died.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which, with a long minority and care,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Promised to turn out well in proper hands:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And answer'd but to nature's just demands;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An only son left with an only mother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is brought up much more wisely than another.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sagest of women, even of widows, she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And worthy of the noblest pedigree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then for accomplishments of chivalry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In case our lord the king should go to war again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how to scale a fortress--or a nunnery.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But that which Donna Inez most desired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And saw into herself each day before all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The learned tutors whom for him she hired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Much into all his studies she inquired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so they were submitted first to her, all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The languages, especially the dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The arts, at least all such as could be said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be the most remote from common use,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In all these he was much and deeply read;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But not a page of any thing that's loose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or hints continuation of the species,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was ever suffer'd, lest he should grow vicious.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His classic studies made a little puzzle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But never put on pantaloons or bodices;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for their AEneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were forced to make an odd sort! of apology,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ovid's a rake, as half his verses show him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucretius' irreligion is too strong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although no doubt his real intent was good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For speaking out so plainly in his song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So much indeed as to be downright rude;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then what proper person can be partial<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan was taught from out the best edition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expurgated by learned men, who place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Too much their modest bard by this omission,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pitying sore his mutilated case,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They only add them all in an appendix,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of being scatter'd through the Pages;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till some less rigid editor shall stoop<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To call them back into their separate cages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of standing staring all together,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like garden gods--and not so decent either.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Missal too (it was the family Missal)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was ornamented in a sort of way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could turn their optics to the text and pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is more than I know--But Don Juan's mother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kept this herself, and gave her son another.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And homilies, and lives of all the saints;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He did not take such studies for restraints;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So well not one of the aforesaid paints<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which make the reader envy his transgressions.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can't but say that his mamma was right,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If such an education was the true one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You might be sure she was a perfect fright;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She did this during even her husband's life--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I recommend as much to every wife.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young Juan wax'd in goodliness and grace;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At six a charming child, and at eleven<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With all the promise of as fine a face<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As e'er to man's maturer growth was given:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He studied steadily, and grew apace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For half his days were pass'd at church, the other<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At six, I said, he was a charming child,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although in infancy a little wild,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her young philosopher was grown already.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what I say is neither here nor there:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I knew his father well, and have some skill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In character--but it would not be fair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From sire to son to augur good or ill:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But scandal's my aversion--I protest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Against all evil speaking, even in jest.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For my part I say nothing--nothing--but<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This I will say--my reasons are my own--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That if I had an only son to put<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To school (as God be praised that I have none),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Him up to learn his catechism alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No--no--I 'd send him out betimes to college,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For there it was I pick'd up my own knowledge.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For there one learns--'t is not for me to boast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though I acquired--but I pass over that,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As well as all the Greek I since have lost:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say that there's the place--but 'Verbum sat.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think I pick'd up too, as well as most,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Knowledge of matters--but no matter what--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I never married--but, I think, I know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That sons should not be educated so.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And everybody but his mother deem'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Him almost man; but she flew in a rage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bit her lips (for else she might have scream'd)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If any said so, for to be precocious<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selected for discretion and devotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was the Donna Julia, whom to call<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pretty were but to give a feeble notion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of many charms in her as natural<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (But this last simile is trite and stupid).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The darkness of her Oriental eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Accorded with her Moorish origin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some went to Africa, some stay'd in Spain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She married (I forget the pedigree)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His blood less noble than such blood should be;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At such alliances his sires would frown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In that point so precise in each degree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That they bred in and in, as might be shown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Marrying their cousins--nay, their aunts, and nieces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This heathenish cross restored the breed again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ruin'd its blood, but much improved its flesh;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But there's a rumour which I fain would hush,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However this might be, the race went on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Improving still through every generation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until it centred in an only son,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who left an only daughter; my narration<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May have suggested that this single one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I shall have much to speak about), and she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And love than either; and there would arise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A something in them which was not desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mounting at times to a transparent glow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Possess'd an air and grace by no means common:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her stature tall--I hate a dumpy woman.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wedded she was some years, and to a man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Especially in countries near the sun:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all the fault of that indecent sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That howsoever people fast and pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is much more common where the climate's sultry.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Happy the nations of the moral North!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where all is virtue, and the winter season<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lover, who must pay a handsome price,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because it is a marketable vice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man well looking for his years, and who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorr'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They lived together, as most people do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suffering each other's foibles by accord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not exactly either one or two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Julia was--yet I never could see why--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Between their tastes there was small sympathy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For not a line had Julia ever penn'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some people whisper but no doubt they lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For malice still imputes some private end)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that still keeping up the old connection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which time had lately render'd much more chaste,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She took his lady also in affection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly this course was much the best:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She flatter'd Julia with her sage protection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At least she left it a more slender handle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With other people's eyes, or if her own<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Discoveries made, but none could be aware<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indifferent from the first or callous grown:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm really puzzled what to think or say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She kept her counsel in so close a way.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Caress'd him often--such a thing might be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I am not so sure I should have smiled<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These few short years make wondrous alterations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er the cause might be, they had become<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And much embarrassment in either eye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There surely will be little doubt with some<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Donna Julia knew the reason why,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as for Juan, he had no more notion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tremulously gentle her small hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Withdrew itself from his, but left behind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And slight, so very slight, that to the mind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wrought change with all Armida's fairy art<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if she met him, though she smiled no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She must not own, but cherish'd more the while<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For that compression in its burning core;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even innocence itself has many a wile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And will not dare to trust itself with truth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But passion most dissembles, yet betrays<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in whatever aspect it arrays<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Coldness or anger, even disdain or hate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are masks it often wears, and still too late.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And burning blushes, though for no transgression,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All these are little preludes to possession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which young passion cannot be bereft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And merely tend to show how greatly love is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Embarrass'd at first starting with a novice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She felt it going, and resolved to make<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The noblest efforts for herself and mate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For honour's, pride's, religion's, virtue's sake;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her resolutions were most truly great,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As being the best judge of a lady's case.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She vow'd she never would see Juan more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And next day paid a visit to his mother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And look'd extremely at the opening door,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Grateful she was, and yet a little sore--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Again it opens, it can be no other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is surely Juan now--No! I 'm afraid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That night the Virgin was no further pray'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She now determined that a virtuous woman<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should rather face and overcome temptation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That flight was base and dastardly, and no man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should ever give her heart the least sensation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is to say, a thought beyond the common<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Preference, that we must feel upon occasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For people who are pleasanter than others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then they only seem so many brothers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And even if by chance--and who can tell?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The devil's so very sly--she should discover<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That all within was not so very well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, if still free, that such or such a lover<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I recommend young ladies to make trial.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then there are such things as love divine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such as the angels think so very fine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And matrons who would be no less secure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Platonic, perfect, 'just such love as mine;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus Julia said--and thought so, to be sure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so I 'd have her think, were I the man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On whom her reveries celestial ran.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such love is innocent, and may exist<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between young persons without any danger.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But hear these freedoms form the utmost list<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But not my fault--I tell them all in time.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love, then, but love within its proper limits,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was Julia's innocent determination<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exertion might be useful on occasion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He might be taught, by love and her together--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I really don't know what, nor Julia either.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In mail of proof--her purity of soul--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She, for the future of her strength convinced.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that her honour was a rock, or mole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With any kind of troublesome control;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But whether Julia to the task was equal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is that which must be mention'd in the sequel.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not scandal's fangs could fix on much that's seizable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or if they did so, satisfied to mean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A quiet conscience makes one so serene!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That all the Apostles would have done as they did.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if in the mean time her husband died,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Never could she survive that common loss;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But just suppose that moment should betide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I only say suppose it--inter nos.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (This should be entre nous, for Julia thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I only say suppose this supposition:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan being then grown up to man's estate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would fully suit a widow of condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even seven years hence it would not be too late;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in the interim (to pursue this vision)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The mischief, after all, could not be great,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For he would learn the rudiments of love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I mean the seraph way of those above.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poor little fellow! he had no idea<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of his own case, and never hit the true one;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He puzzled over what he found a new one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But not as yet imagined it could be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His home deserted for the lonely wood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tormented with a wound he could not know,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm fond myself of solitude or so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But then, I beg it may be understood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By solitude I mean a sultan's, not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A hermit's, with a haram for a grot.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where transport and security entwine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here thou art a god indeed divine.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the exception of the second line,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For that same twining 'transport and security'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the good sense and senses of mankind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very thing which every body feels,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As all have found on trial, or may find,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That no one likes to be disturb'd at meals<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or love.--I won't say more about 'entwined'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or 'transport,' as we knew all that before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But beg'security' will bolt the door.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young Juan wander'd by the glassy brooks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thinking unutterable things; he threw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Himself at length within the leafy nooks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There poets find materials for their books,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every now and then we read them through,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that their plan and prosody are eligible,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His self-communion with his own high soul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had mitigated part, though not the whole<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of its disease; he did the best he could<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With things not very subject to control,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And turn'd, without perceiving his condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He thought about himself, and the whole earth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how the deuce they ever could have birth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How many miles the moon might have in girth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of air-balloons, and of the many bars<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In thoughts like these true wisdom may discern<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Longings sublime, and aspirations high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which some are born with, but the most part learn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To plague themselves withal, they know not why:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was strange that one so young should thus concern<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His brain about the action of the sky;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you think 't was philosophy that this did,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't help thinking puberty assisted.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And heard a voice in all the winds; and then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And how the goddesses came down to men:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he look'd upon his watch again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He found how much old Time had been a winner--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He also found that he had lost his dinner.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Boscan, or Garcilasso;--by the wind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even as the page is rustled while we look,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So by the poesy of his own mind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if 't were one whereon magicians bind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to some good old woman's tale.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus would he while his lonely hours away<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A bosom whereon he his head might lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With--several other things, which I forget,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She saw that Juan was not at his ease;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her only son with question or surmise:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether it was she did not see, or would not,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or, like all very clever people, could not.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For instance--gentlemen, whose ladies take<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leave to o'erstep the written rights of woman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And break the--Which commandment is 't they break?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (I have forgot the number, and think no man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A real husband always is suspicious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But still no less suspects in the wrong place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The last indeed's infallibly the case:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus parents also are at times short-sighted;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The while the wicked world beholds delighted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till some confounded escapade has blighted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The plan of twenty years, and all is over;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then the mother cries, the father swears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wonders why the devil he got heirs.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Inez was so anxious, and so clear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had some other motive much more near<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For leaving Juan to this new temptation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps to finish Juan's education,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In case he thought his wife too great a prize.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was upon a day, a summer's day;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so is spring about the end of May;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And stand convicted of more truth than treason,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That there are months which nature grows more merry in,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was on a summer's day--the sixth of June:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I like to be particular in dates,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not only of the age, and year, but moon;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Change horses, making history change its tune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaving at last not much besides chronology,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Excepting the post-obits of theology.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of half-past six--perhaps still nearer seven--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Julia sate within as pretty a bower<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With all the trophies of triumphant song--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He won them well, and may he wear them long!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She sate, but not alone; I know not well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How this same interview had taken place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And even if I knew, I should not tell--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People should hold their tongues in any case;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No matter how or why the thing befell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But there were she and Juan, face to face--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But very difficult, to shut their eyes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Glow'd in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How self-deceitful is the sagest part<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The precipice she stood on was immense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So was her creed in her own innocence.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of the folly of all prudish fears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Victorious virtue, and domestic truth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because that number rarely much endears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When people say, 'I've told you fifty times,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They mean to scold, and very often do;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By all the vows below to powers above,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She never would disgrace the ring she wore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quite by mistake--she thought it was her own;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unconsciously she lean'd upon the other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which play'd within the tangles of her hair:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And to contend with thoughts she could not smother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She seem'd by the distraction of her air.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To leave together this imprudent pair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She who for many years had watch'd her son so--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm very certain mine would not have done so.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gently, but palpably confirm'd its grasp,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if it said, 'Detain me, if you please;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet there's no doubt she only meant to clasp<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had she imagined such a thing could rouse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot know what Juan thought of this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what he did, is much what you would do;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love is so very timid when 't is new:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The devil's in the moon for mischief; they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who call'd her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their nomenclature; there is not a day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The longest, not the twenty-first of June,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sees half the business in a wicked way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On which three single hours of moonshine smile--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then she looks so modest all the while.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a dangerous silence in that hour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To open all itself, without the power<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of calling wholly back its self-control;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A loving languor, which is not repose.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And half retiring from the glowing arm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But then the situation had its charm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then--God knows what next--I can't go on;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With your confounded fantasies, to more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Immoral conduct by the fancied sway<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your system feigns o'er the controulless core<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of human hearts, than all the long array<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of poets and romancers:--You 're a bore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A charlatan, a coxcomb--and have been,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At best, no better than a go-between.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until too late for useful conversation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wish indeed they had not had occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not that remorse did not oppose temptation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A little still she strove, and much repented<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'--consented.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is said that Xerxes offer'd a reward<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To those who could invent him a new pleasure:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Methinks the requisition's rather hard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And must have cost his majesty a treasure:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I care not for new pleasures, as the old<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I make a resolution every spring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of reformation, ere the year run out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Start not! still chaster reader--she 'll be nice hence--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This liberty is a poetic licence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which some irregularity may make<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the design, and as I have a high sense<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To beg his pardon when I err a bit.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This licence is to hope the reader will<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without whose epoch my poetic skill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For want of facts would all be thrown away),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But keeping Julia and Don Juan still<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In sight, that several months have pass'd; we 'll say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was in November, but I 'm not so sure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; About the day--the era's more obscure.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We 'll talk of that anon.--'T is sweet to hear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our coming, and look brighter when we come;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lisp of children, and their earliest words.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From civic revelry to rural mirth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sweet is revenge--especially to women,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The unexpected death of some old lady<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or gentleman of seventy years complete,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who 've made 'us youth' wait too--too long already<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For an estate, or cash, or country seat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still breaking, but with stamina so steady<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That all the Israelites are fit to mob its<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next owner for their double-damn'd post-obits.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Particularly with a tiresome friend:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dear is the helpless creature we defend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is first and passionate love--it stands alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Adam's recollection of his fall;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd--all's known--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And life yields nothing further to recall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fire which Prometheus filch'd for us from heaven.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Man's a strange animal, and makes strange use<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his own nature, and the various arts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And likes particularly to produce<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some new experiment to show his parts;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the age of oddities let loose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where different talents find their different marts;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 'd best begin with truth, and when you 've lost your<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Labour, there's a sure market for imposture.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What opposite discoveries we have seen!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One makes new noses, one a guillotine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But vaccination certainly has been<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By borrowing a new one from an ox.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But has not answer'd like the apparatus<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the Humane Society's beginning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By which men are unsuffocated gratis:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I said the small-pox has gone out of late;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps it may be follow'd by the great.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is said the great came from America;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps it may set out on its return,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The population there so spreads, they say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With war, or plague, or famine, any way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that civilisation they may learn;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the patent-age of new inventions<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For killing bodies, and for saving souls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All propagated with the best intentions;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Humphry Davy's lantern, by which coals<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Man's a phenomenon, one knows not what,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pleasure's a sin, and sometimes sin's a pleasure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Few mortals know what end they would be at,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The path is through perplexing ways, and when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The goal is gain'd, we die, you know--and then--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What then?--I do not know, no more do you--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so good night.--Return we to our story:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was in November, when fine days are few,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the far mountains wax a little hoary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the sea dashes round the promontory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the loud breaker boils against the rock,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And sober suns must set at five o'clock.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's something cheerful in that sort of light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even as a summer sky's without a cloud:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was midnight--Donna Julia was in bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sleeping, most probably,--when at her door<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arose a clatter might awake the dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If they had never been awoke before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that they have been so we all have read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And are to be so, at the least, once more;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; First knocks were heard, then 'Madam--Madam--hist!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'For God's sake, Madam--Madam--here's my master,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With more than half the city at his back--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is not my fault--I kept good watch--Alack!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Do pray undo the bolt a little faster--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They 're on the stair just now, and in a crack<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Surely the window's not so very high!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With torches, friends, and servants in great number;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The major part of them had long been wived,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of any wicked woman, who contrived<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Examples of this kind are so contagious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were one not punish'd, all would be outrageous.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But for a cavalier of his condition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without a word of previous admonition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hold a levee round his lady's bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Poor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Mind--that I do not say--she had not slept),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if she had just now from out them crept:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't tell why she should take all this trouble<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Appear'd like two poor harmless women, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had thought one man might be deterr'd by two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore side by side were gently laid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the hours of absence should run through,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And truant husband should return, and say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'My dear, I was the first who came away.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Has madness seized you? would that I had died<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ere such a monster's victim I had been!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What may this midnight violence betide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Search, then, the room!'--Alfonso said, 'I will.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And found much linen, lace, and several pair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With other articles of ladies fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arras they prick'd and curtains with their swords,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wounded several shutters, and some boards.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the bed they search'd, and there they found--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No matter what--it was not that they sought;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They open'd windows, gazing if the ground<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then they stared each other's faces round:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of looking in the bed as well as under.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During this inquisition, Julia's tongue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was not asleep--'Yes, search and search,' she cried,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was for this that I became a bride!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For this in silence I have suffer'd long<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A husband like Alfonso at my side;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If ever you indeed deserved the name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is 't worthy of your years?--you have threescore--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How dare you think your lady would go on so?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Is it for this I have disdain'd to hold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The common privileges of my sex?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That I have chosen a confessor so old<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And deaf, that any other it would vex,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And never once he has had cause to scold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But found my very innocence perplex<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So much, he always doubted I was married--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I favor'd none--nay, was almost uncivil?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were there not also Russians, English, many?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who kill'd himself for love (with wine) last year.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Have I not had two bishops at my feet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I praise your vast forbearance not to beat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Me also, since the time so opportune is--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock'd trigger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Was it for this you took your sudden journey.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under pretence of business indispensable<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With that sublime of rascals your attorney,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of having play'd the fool? though both I spurn, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deserves the worst, his conduct's less defensible,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And not from any love to you nor me.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'If he comes here to take a deposition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By all means let the gentleman proceed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 've made the apartment in a fit condition:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let every thing be noted with precision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I would not you for nothing should be fee'd--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, as my maid's undrest, pray turn your spies out.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Oh!' sobb'd Antonia, 'I could tear their eyes out.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'There is the closet, there the toilet, there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The antechamber--search them under, over;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The chimney--which would really hold a lover.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And make no further noise, till you discover<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The secret cavern of this lurking treasure--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when 't is found, let me, too, have that pleasure.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Doubt upon me, confusion over all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pray have the courtesy to make it known<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is the man you search for? how d' ye cal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Him? what's his lineage? let him but be shown--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hope he's young and handsome--is he tall?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tell me--and be assured, that since you stain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My honour thus, it shall not be in vain.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At that age he would be too old for slaughter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or for so young a husband's jealous fears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Antonia! let me have a glass of water).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am ashamed of having shed these tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are unworthy of my father's daughter;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My mother dream'd not in my natal hour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That I should fall into a monster's power.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You saw that she was sleeping by my side<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When you broke in upon us with your fellows:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look where you please--we 've nothing, sir, to hide;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Only another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or for the sake of decency abide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A moment at the door, that we may be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Drest to receive so much good company.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The little I have said may serve to show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I leave you to your conscience as before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T will one day ask you why you used me so?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Antonia! where's my pocket-handkerchief?'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its snow through all;--her soft lips lie apart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And louder than her breathing beats her heart.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, turning up her nose, with looks abused<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her master and his myrmidons, of whom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not one, except the attorney, was amused;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Knowing they must be settled by the laws.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Following Antonia's motions here and there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With much suspicion in his attitude;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For reputations he had little care;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that a suit or action were made good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Small pity had he for the young and fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And ne'er believed in negatives, till these<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were proved by competent false witnesses.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When, after searching in five hundred nooks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And treating a young wife with so much rigour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Added to those his lady with such vigour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had pour'd upon him for the last half-hour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quick, thick, and heavy--as a thunder-shower.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At first he tried to hammer an excuse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And indications of hysterics, whose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He saw too, in perspective, her relations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then he tried to muster all his patience.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But sage Antonia cut him short before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The anvil of his speech received the hammer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With 'Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or madam dies.'--Alfonso mutter'd, 'D--n her,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He cast a rueful look or two, and did,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With him retired his 'posse comitatus,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The attorney last, who linger'd near the door<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Antonia let him--not a little sore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An awkward look; as he revolved the case,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The door was fasten'd in his legal face.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No sooner was it bolted, than--Oh shame!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How can you do such things and keep your fame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to proceed--for there is more behind:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young Juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had been hid--I don't pretend to say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How, nor can I indeed describe the where--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt, in little compass, round or square;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But pity him I neither must nor may<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His suffocation by that pretty pair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, secondly, I pity not, because<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had no business to commit a sin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least 't was rather early to begin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So much as when we call our old debts in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And find a deuced balance with the devil.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of his position I can give no notion:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that the medicine answer'd very well;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For David lived, but Juan nearly died.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What's to be done? Alfonso will be back<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The moment he has sent his fools away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But no device could be brought into play--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how to parry the renew'd attack?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But press'd her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even then their love they could not all command,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And half forgot their danger and despair:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Antonia's patience now was at a stand--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She whisper'd, in great wrath--'I must deposit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This pretty gentleman within the closet:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who can have put my master in this mood?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What will become on 't--I 'm in such a fright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The devil's in the urchin, and no good--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Had it but been for a stout cavalier<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But for a child, what piece of work is here!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I really, madam, wonder at your taste<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Come, sir, get in)--my master must be near:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if we can but till the morning keep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our counsel--(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Closed the oration of the trusty maid:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, present remedy was none,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso paused a minute--then begun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He would not justify what he had done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But there were ample reasons for it, none<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which he specified in this his pleading:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Julia said nought; though all the while there rose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A ready answer, which at once enables<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A matron, who her husband's foible knows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By a few timely words to turn the tables,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is to retort with firmness, and when he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that can't be, as has been often shown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lady with apologies abounds;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It might be that her silence sprang alone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There might be one more motive, which makes two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mention'd his jealousy but never who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had been the happy lover, he concluded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Conceal'd amongst his premises; 't is true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To speak of Inez now were, one may say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A hint, in tender cases, is enough;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Silence is best, besides there is a tact<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But it will serve to keep my verse compact)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which keeps, when push'd by questions rather rough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lady always distant from the fact:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The charming creatures lie with such a grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's nothing so becoming to the face.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They blush, and we believe them; at least I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have always done so; 't is of no great use,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In any case, attempting a reply,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A tear or two, and then we make it up;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then--and then--and then--sit down and sup.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And laid conditions he thought very hard on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Denying several little things he wanted:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With useless penitence perplex'd and haunted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beseeching she no further would refuse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A pair of shoes!--what then? not much, if they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (No one can tell how much I grieve to say)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was but a moment's act.--Ah! well-a-day!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso first examined well their fashion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then flew out into another passion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He left the room for his relinquish'd sword,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Julia instant to the closet flew.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven's sake--not a word--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The door is open--you may yet slip through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The passage you so often have explored--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is the garden-key--Fly--fly--Adieu!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Haste--haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Day has not broke--there's no one in the street:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; None can say that this was not good advice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The only mischief was, it came too late;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all experience 't is the usual price,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And might have done so by the garden-gate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who threaten'd death--so Juan knock'd him down.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Antonia cried out 'Rape!' and Julia 'Fire!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso, pommell'd to his heart's desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And they continued battling hand to hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His temper not being under great command,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso's days had not been in the land<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Much longer.--Think of husbands', lovers' lives!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how ye may be doubly widows--wives!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan throttled him to get away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then his only garment quite gave way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An awkward spectacle their eyes before;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Antonia in hysterics, Julia swoon'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And liking not the inside, lock'd the out.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here ends this canto.--Need I sing, or say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How Juan naked, favour'd by the night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who favours what she should not, found his way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The pleasant scandal which arose next day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were in the English newspapers, of course.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you would like to see the whole proceedings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The depositions, and the cause at full,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's more than one edition, and the readings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are various, but they none of them are dull;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Donna Inez, to divert the train<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of one of the most circulating scandals<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That had for centuries been known in Spain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least since the retirement of the Vandals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; First vow'd (and never had she vow'd in vain)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then, by the advice of some old ladies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had resolved that he should travel through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All European climes, by land or sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To mend his former morals, and get new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially in France and Italy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (At least this is the thing most people do).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Julia was sent into a convent: she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shown in the following copy of her Letter:--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is wise--'t is well, but not the less a pain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have no further claim on your young heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mine is the victim, and would be again;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To love too much has been the only art<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I used;--I write in haste, and if a stain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I loved, I love you, for this love have lost<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet can not regret what it hath cost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So dear is still the memory of that dream;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've nothing to reproach, or to request.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is woman's whole existence; man may range<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And few there are whom these cannot estrange;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men have all these resources, we but one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To love again, and be again undone.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beloved and loving many; all is o'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For me on earth, except some years to hide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These I could bear, but cannot cast aside<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The passion which still rages as before--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so farewell--forgive me, love me--No,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That word is idle now--but let it go.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But still I think I can collect my mind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My blood still rushes where my spirit's set,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As roll the waves before the settled wind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My heart is feminine, nor can forget--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To all, except one image, madly blind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I have no more to say, but linger still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet I may as well the task fulfil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My misery can scarce be more complete:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I must even survive this last adieu,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And bear with life, to love and pray for you!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This note was written upon gilt-edged paper<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It trembled as magnetic needles do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet she did not let one tear escape her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The seal a sun-flower; 'Elle vous suit partout,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The motto cut upon a white cornelian;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall proceed with his adventures is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dependent on the public altogether;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We 'll see, however, what they say to this:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their favour in an author's cap's a feather,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And no great mischief's done by their caprice;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if their approbation we experience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My poem's epic, and is meant to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Divided in twelve books; each book containing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; New characters; the episodes are three:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A panoramic view of hell's in training,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the style of Virgil and of Homer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that my name of Epic's no misnomer.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All these things will be specified in time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which makes so many poets, and some fools:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Prose poets like blank-verse, I 'm fond of rhyme,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've got new mythological machinery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And very handsome supernatural scenery.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's only one slight difference between<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Me and my epic brethren gone before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And here the advantage is my own, I ween<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Not that I have not several merits more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this will more peculiarly be seen);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whereas this story's actually true.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If any person doubt it, I appeal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To history, tradition, and to facts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To plays in five, and operas in three acts;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All these confirm my statement a good deal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that which more completely faith exacts<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is that myself, and several now in Seville,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Saw Juan's last elopement with the devil.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If ever I should condescend to prose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll write poetical commandments, which<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That went before; in these I shall enrich<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My text with many things that no one knows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And carry precept to the highest pitch:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or, Every Poet his own Aristotle.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Commit--flirtation with the muse of Moore.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt not covet Mr. Sotheby's Muse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His Pegasus, nor anything that's his;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt not bear false witness like 'the Blues'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (There's one, at least, is very fond of this);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thou shalt not write, in short, but what I choose:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is true criticism, and you may kiss--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exactly as you please, or not,--the rod;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If any person should presume to assert<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This story is not moral, first, I pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That they will not cry out before they 're hurt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That this is not a moral tale, though gay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very place where wicked people go.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If, after all, there should be some so blind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To their own good this warning to despise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Led by some tortuosity of mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And cry that they 'the moral cannot find,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Should captains the remark, or critics, make,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They also lie too--under a mistake.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The public approbation I expect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And beg they 'll take my word about the moral,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which I with their amusement will connect<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (So children cutting teeth receive a coral);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime, they 'll doubtless please to recollect<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My epical pretensions to the laurel:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've bribed my grandmother's review--the British.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I sent it in a letter to the Editor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who thank'd me duly by return of post--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm for a handsome article his creditor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And break a promise after having made it her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Denying the receipt of what it cost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And smear his page with gall instead of honey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All I can say is--that he had the money.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think that with this holy new alliance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I may ensure the public, and defy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All other magazines of art or science,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have not essay'd to multiply their clients,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Treat a dissenting author very martyrly.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consule Planco,' Horace said, and so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Say I; by which quotation there is meant a<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hint that some six or seven good years ago<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was most ready to return a blow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And would not brook at all this sort of thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In my hot youth--when George the Third was King.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now at thirty years my hair is grey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (I wonder what it will be like at forty?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I thought of a peruke the other day)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And feel no more the spirit to retort; I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have spent my life, both interest and principal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And deem not, what I deem'd, my soul invincible.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No more--no more--Oh! never more on me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which out of all the lovely things we see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Extracts emotions beautiful and new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To double even the sweetness of a flower.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No more--no more--Oh! never more, my heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Once all in all, but now a thing apart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The illusion's gone for ever, and thou art<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in thy stead I 've got a deal of judgment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My days of love are over; me no more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Can make the fool of which they made before,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In short, I must not lead the life I did do;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The copious use of claret is forbid too,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think I must take up with avarice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ambition was my idol, which was broken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the two last have left me many a token<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, like Friar Bacon's brazen head, I 've spoken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Time is, Time was, Time's past:'--a chymic treasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is glittering youth, which I have spent betimes--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A certain portion of uncertain paper:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some liken it to climbing up a hill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To have, when the original is dust,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What are the hopes of man? Old Egypt's King<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cheops erected the first pyramid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And largest, thinking it was just the thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But somebody or other rummaging,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let not a monument give you or me hopes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I being fond of true philosophy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say very often to myself, 'Alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All things that have been born were born to die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if you had it o'er again--'t would pass--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So thank your stars that matters are no worse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But for the present, gentle reader! and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still gentler purchaser! the bard--that's I--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so 'Your humble servant, and good-b'ye!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We meet again, if we should understand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each other; and if not, I shall not try<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your patience further than by this short sample--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T were well if others follow'd my example.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Go, little book, from this my solitude!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I cast thee on the waters--go thy ways!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The world will find thee after many days.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can't help putting in my claim to praise--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The four first rhymes are Southey's every line:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For God's sake, reader! take them not for mine.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="aii">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;             CANTO THE SECOND.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; OH ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I pray ye flog them upon all occasions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It mends their morals, never mind the pain:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The best of mothers and of educations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Juan's case were but employ'd in vain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since, in a way that's rather of the oddest, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Became divested of his native modesty.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had he but been placed at a public school,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the third form, or even in the fourth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His daily task had kept his fancy cool,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least, had he been nurtured in the north;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Spain may prove an exception to the rule,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But then exceptions always prove its worth--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lad of sixteen causing a divorce<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Puzzled his tutors very much, of course.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't say that it puzzles me at all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If all things be consider'd: first, there was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His lady-mother, mathematical,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A--never mind; his tutor, an old ass;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A pretty woman (that's quite natural,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or else the thing had hardly come to pass);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A husband rather old, not much in unity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With his young wife--a time, and opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Well--well, the world must turn upon its axis,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all mankind turn with it, heads or tails,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The king commands us, and the doctor quacks us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The priest instructs, and so our life exhales,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fighting, devotion, dust,--perhaps a name.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pretty town, I recollect it well--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Or was, before Peru learn'd to rebel),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And such sweet girls--I mean, such graceful ladies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their very walk would make your bosom swell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't describe it, though so much it strike,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor liken it--I never saw the like:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No--none of these will do;--and then their garb!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their veil and petticoat--Alas! to dwell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon such things would very near absorb<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A canto--then their feet and ankles,--well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank Heaven I 've got no metaphor quite ready<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (And so, my sober Muse--come, let's be steady--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Chaste Muse!--well, if you must, you must)--the veil<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flashes into the heart:--All sunny land<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of love! when I forget you, may I fail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To--say my prayers--but never was there plann'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her son to Cadiz only to embark;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To stay there had not answer'd her intent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But why?--we leave the reader in the dark--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was for a voyage that the young man was meant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To wean him from the wickedness of earth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And send him like a dove of promise forth.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan bade his valet pack his things<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According to direction, then received<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lecture and some money: for four springs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was to travel; and though Inez grieved<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (As every kind of parting has its stings),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She hoped he would improve--perhaps believed:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of good advice--and two or three of credit.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the mean time, to pass her hours away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For naughty children, who would rather play<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Infants of three years old were taught that day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The great success of Juan's education,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Spurr'd her to teach another generation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan embark'd--the ship got under way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wind was fair, the water passing rough:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I, who 've cross'd it oft, know well enough;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, standing upon deck, the dashing spray<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And there he stood to take, and take again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His first--perhaps his last--farewell of Spain.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't but say it is an awkward sight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To see one's native land receding through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The growing waters; it unmans one quite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially when life is rather new:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But almost every other country's blue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When gazing on them, mystified by distance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We enter on our nautical existence.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So Juan stood, bewilder'd on the deck:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wind sung, cordage strain'd, and sailors swore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the ship creak'd, the town became a speck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From which away so fair and fast they bore.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The best of remedies is a beef-steak<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against sea-sickness: try it, sir, before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You sneer, and I assure you this is true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For I have found it answer--so may you.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beheld his native Spain receding far:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; First partings form a lesson hard to learn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even nations feel this when they go to war;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a sort of unexprest concern,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At leaving even the most unpleasant people<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And places, one keeps looking at the steeple.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan had got many things to leave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that he had much better cause to grieve<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than many persons more advanced in life;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if we now and then a sigh must heave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At quitting even those we quit in strife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt we weep for those the heart endears--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'd weep,--but mine is not a weeping Muse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young men should travel, if but to amuse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan wept, and much he sigh'd and thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While his salt tears dropp'd into the salt sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'sweets to the sweet' (I like so much to quote;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You must excuse this extract, 't is where she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flowers to the grave); and, sobbing often, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reflected on his present situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And seriously resolved on reformation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!' he cried,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Farewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Farewell, too, dearest Julia!--(Here he drew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her letter out again, and read it through.)<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'And, oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that's impossible, and cannot be--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or think of any thing excepting thee;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A mind diseased no remedy can physic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, Julia! what is every other wo?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Julia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond the best apothecary's art,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The loss of love, the treachery of friends,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or death of those we dote on, when a part<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the sea acted as a strong emetic. I<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love's a capricious power: I 've known it hold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out through a fever caused by its own heat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And find a quincy very hard to treat;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Against all noble maladies he's bold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor inflammations redden his blind eye.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But worst of all is nausea, or a pain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About the lower region of the bowels;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love, who heroically breathes a vein,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shrinks from the application of hot towels,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could Juan's passion, while the billows roar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Resist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ship, call'd the most holy 'Trinidada,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For there the Spanish family Moncada<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were settled long ere Juan's sire was born:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They were relations, and for them he had a<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Letter of introduction, which the morn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of his departure had been sent him by<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His Spanish friends for those in Italy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His suite consisted of three servants and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who several languages did understand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His headache being increased by every billow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the waves oozing through the port-hole made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His berth a little damp, and him afraid.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was not without some reason, for the wind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Increased at night, until it blew a gale;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And though 't was not much to a naval mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some landsmen would have look'd a little pale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At sunset they began to take in sail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the sky show'd it would come on to blow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At one o'clock the wind with sudden shift<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Started the stern-post, also shatter'd the<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Herself from out her present jeopardy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The pumps, and there were four feet water found.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One gang of people instantly was put<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the pumps and the remainder set<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To get up part of the cargo, and what not;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But they could not come at the leak as yet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At last they did get at it really, but<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still their salvation was an even bet:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The water rush'd through in a way quite puzzling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into the opening; but all such ingredients<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Despite of all their efforts and expedients,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for the pumps: I 'm glad to make them known<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To all the brother tars who may have need hence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For fifty tons of water were upthrown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By them per hour, and they had all been undone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As day advanced the weather seem'd to abate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A gust--which all descriptive power transcends--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There she lay motionless, and seem'd upset;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The water left the hold, and wash'd the decks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And made a scene men do not soon forget;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or any other thing that brings regret,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus drownings are much talk'd of by the divers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Immediately the masts were cut away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The main-mast follow'd: but the ship still lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eased her at last (although we never meant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To part with all till every hope was blighted),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then with violence the old ship righted.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It may be easily supposed, while this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was going on, some people were unquiet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That passengers would find it much amiss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That even the able seaman, deeming his<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As upon such occasions tars will ask<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As rum and true religion: thus it was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some plunder'd, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The high wind made the treble, and as bas<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Clamour'd in chorus to the roaring ocean.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Got to the spirit-room, and stood before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It with a pair of pistols; and their fears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if Death were more dreadful by his door<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Give us more grog,' they cried, 'for it will be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All one an hour hence.' Juan answer'd, 'No!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is true that death awaits both you and me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But let us die like men, not sink below<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like brutes;'--and thus his dangerous post kept he,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And none liked to anticipate the blow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The good old gentleman was quite aghast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made a loud and pious lamentation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Repented all his sins, and made a last<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Irrevocable vow of reformation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To quit his academic occupation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now there came a flash of hope once more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Day broke, and the wind lull'd: the masts were gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They tried the pumps again, and though before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their desperate efforts seem'd all useless grown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a sail.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the vessel's keel the sail was past,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for the moment it had some effect;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still 't is best to struggle to the last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is never too late to be wholly wreck'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And though 't is true that man can only die once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without their will, they carried them away;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For they were forced with steering to dispense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And never had as yet a quiet day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On which they might repose, or even commence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A jurymast or rudder, or could say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still swam--though not exactly like a duck.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the ship labour'd so, they scarce could hope<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To weather out much longer; the distress<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was also great with which they had to cope<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For want of water, and their solid mess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was scant enough: in vain the telescope<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was used--nor sail nor shore appear'd in sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Again the weather threaten'd,--again blew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A gale, and in the fore and after hold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Water appear'd; yet, though the people knew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All this, the most were patient, and some bold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until the chains and leathers were worn through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all our pumps:--a wreck complete she roll'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like human beings during civil war.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In his rough eyes, and told the captain he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could do no more: he was a man in years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if he wept at length, they were not fears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That made his eyelids as a woman's be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two things for dying people quite bewildering.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ship was evidently settling now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some went to prayers again, and made a vow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of candles to their saints--but there were none<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To pay them with; and some look'd o'er the bow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That begg'd Pedrillo for an absolution,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who told him to be damn'd--in his confusion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some cursed the day on which they saw the sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And others went on as they had begun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Getting the boats out, being well aware<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The worst of all was, that in their condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Having been several days in great distress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was difficult to get out such provision<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As now might render their long suffering less:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in the long-boat they contrived to stow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A portion of their beef up from below,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Been stove in the beginning of the gale;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the long-boat's condition was but bad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As there were but two blankets for a sail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And one oar for a mast, which a young lad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To save one half the people then on board.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over the waste of waters; like a veil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of one whose hate is mask'd but to assail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Been their familiar, and now Death was here.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some trial had been making at a raft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With little hope in such a rolling sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sort of thing at which one would have laugh'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any laughter at such times could be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless with people who too much have quaff'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Half epileptical and half hysterical:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their preservation would have been a miracle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For yet they strove, although of no great use:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was no light in heaven but a few stars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, going down head foremost--sunk, in short.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As eager to anticipate their grave;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And down she suck'd with her the whirling wave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like one who grapples with his enemy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And strives to strangle him before he die.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And first one universal shriek there rush'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Louder than the loud ocean, like a crash<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of echoing thunder; and then all was hush'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of billows; but at intervals there gush'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Accompanied with a convulsive splash,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of some strong swimmer in his agony.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The boats, as stated, had got off before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in them crowded several of the crew;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet their present hope was hardly more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than what it had been, for so strong it blew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was slight chance of reaching any shore;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then they were too many, though so few--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were counted in them when they got afloat.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All the rest perish'd; near two hundred souls<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had left their bodies; and what's worse, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When over Catholics the ocean rolls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They must wait several weeks before a mass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because, till people know what's come to pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They won't lay out their money on the dead--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It costs three francs for every mass that's said.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan got into the long-boat, and there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seem'd as if they had exchanged their care,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Juan wore the magisterial face<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Battista; though (a name call'd shortly Tita),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the same cause, conducive to his loss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Left him so drunk, he jump'd into the wave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They could not rescue him although so close,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because the sea ran higher every minute,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And for the boat--the crew kept crowding in it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A small old spaniel,--which had been Don Jose's,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For on such things the memory reposes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With tenderness--stood howling on the brink,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Knowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Off, threw him in, then after him he leap'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He also stuff'd his money where he could<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About his person, and Pedrillo's too,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not knowing what himself to say, or do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As every rising wave his dread renew'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan, trusting they might still get through,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And deeming there were remedies for any ill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus re-embark'd his tutor and his spaniel.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That the sail was becalm'd between the seas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though on the wave's high top too much to set,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They dared not take it in for all the breeze:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each sea curl'd o'er the stern, and kept them wet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made them bale without a moment's ease,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that themselves as well as hopes were damp'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the poor little cutter quickly swamp'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kept above water, with an oar for mast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two blankets stitch'd together, answering ill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though every wave roll'd menacing to fill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And present peril all before surpass'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They grieved for those who perish'd with the cutter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the continuance of the gale: to run<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before the sea until it should grow fine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was all that for the present could be done:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were served out to the people, who begun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And most of them had little clothes but rags.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They counted thirty, crowded in a space<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They did their best to modify their case,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One half sate up, though numb'd with the immersion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While t'other half were laid down in their place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ague in its cold fit, they fill'd their boat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With nothing but the sky for a great coat.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is very certain the desire of life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Survive through very desperate conditions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is said that persons living on annuities<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are longer lived than others,--God knows why,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless to plague the grantors,--yet so true it is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That some, I really think, do never die;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that's their mode of furnishing supply:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In my young days they lent me cash that way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which I found very troublesome to pay.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is thus with people in an open boat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They live upon the love of life, and bear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More than can be believed, or even thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had a curious crew as well as cargo,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But man is a carnivorous production,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And must have meals, at least one meal a day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although his anatomical construction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your labouring people think beyond all question,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus it was with this our hapless crew;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For on the third day there came on a calm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And though at first their strength it might renew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lying on their weariness like balm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lull'd them like turtles sleeping on the blue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fell all ravenously on their provision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of hoarding it with due precision.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The consequence was easily foreseen--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In spite of all remonstrances, and then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It would have been more wise to save their victual.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What could they do? and hunger's rage grew wild:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was kill'd and portion'd out for present eating.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan, who had still refused, because<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The creature was his father's dog that died,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With some remorse received (though first denied)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a great favour one of the fore-paws,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which he divided with Pedrillo, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Devour'd it, longing for the other too.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The seventh day, and no wind--the burning sun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blister'd and scorch'd, and, stagnant on the sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save in the breeze that came not; savagely<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They glared upon each other--all was done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Water, and wine, and food,--and you might see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The longings of the cannibal arise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At length one whisper'd his companion, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whisper'd another, and thus it went round,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then into a hoarser murmur grew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was but his own, suppress'd till now, he found:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And who should die to be his fellow's food.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But ere they came to this, they that day shared<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some leathern caps, and what remain'd of shoes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then they look'd around them and despair'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And none to be the sacrifice would choose;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But of materials that much shock the Muse--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Having no paper, for the want of better,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In silent horror, and their distribution<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lull'd even the savage hunger which demanded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; None in particular had sought or plann'd it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was nature gnaw'd them to this resolution,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By which none were permitted to be neuter--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He but requested to be bled to death:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The surgeon had his instruments, and bled<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pedrillo, and so gently ebb'd his breath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You hardly could perceive when he was dead.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He died as born, a Catholic in faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like most in the belief in which they 're bred,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And first a little crucifix he kiss'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then held out his jugular and wrist.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The surgeon, as there was no other fee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But being thirstiest at the moment, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Preferr'd a draught from the fast-flowing veins:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And such things as the entrails and the brains<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Regaled two sharks, who follow'd o'er the billow--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sailors ate him, all save three or four,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who were not quite so fond of animal food;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To these was added Juan, who, before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Feel now his appetite increased much more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was not to be expected that he should,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even in extremity of their disaster,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dine with them on his pastor and his master.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The consequence was awful in the extreme;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For they, who were most ravenous in the act,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Went raging mad--Lord! how they did blaspheme!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Drinking salt water like a mountain-stream,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And some of them had lost their recollection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Happier than they who still perceived their woes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But others ponder'd on a new dissection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if not warn'd sufficiently by those<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who had already perish'd, suffering madly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For having used their appetites so sadly.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And next they thought upon the master's mate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As fattest; but he saved himself, because,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides being much averse from such a fate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There were some other reasons: the first was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had been rather indisposed of late;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that which chiefly proved his saving clause<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By general subscription of the ladies.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of poor Pedrillo something still remain'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But was used sparingly,--some were afraid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And others still their appetites constrain'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or but at times a little supper made;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All except Juan, who throughout abstain'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At length they caught two boobies and a noddy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then they left off eating the dead body.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember Ugolino condescends<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To eat the head of his arch-enemy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The moment after he politely ends<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without being much more horrible than Dante.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the same night there fell a shower of rain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When dried to summer dust; till taught by pain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men really know not what good water's worth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or with a famish'd boat's-crew had your berth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or in the desert heard the camel's bell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 'd wish yourself where Truth is--in a well.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It pour'd down torrents, but they were no richer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when they deem'd its moisture was complete<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a full pot of porter, to their thinking<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suck'd in the moisture, which like nectar stream'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the rich man's in hell, who vainly scream'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To beg the beggar, who could not rain back<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A drop of dew, when every drop had seem'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To taste of heaven--If this be true, indeed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some Christians have a comfortable creed.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with them their two sons, of whom the one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was more robust and hardy to the view,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he died early; and when he was gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One glance at him, and said, 'Heaven's will be done!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can do nothing,' and he saw him thrown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into the deep without a tear or groan.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The other father had a weaklier child,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of a soft cheek and aspect delicate;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the boy bore up long, and with a mild<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And patient spirit held aloof his fate;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Little he said, and now and then he smiled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if to win a part from off the weight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He saw increasing on his father's heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the deep deadly thought that they must part.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when the wish'd-for shower at length was come,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brighten'd, and for a moment seem'd to roam,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into his dying child's mouth--but in vain.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The boy expired--the father held the clay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And look'd upon it long, and when at last<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He watch'd it wistfully, until away<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was borne by the rude wave wherein 't was cast;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now overhead a rainbow, bursting through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Resting its bright base on the quivering blue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all within its arch appear'd to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Clearer than that without, and its wide hue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wax'd broad and waving, like a banner free,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then changed like to a bow that's bent, and then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck'd men.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It changed, of course; a heavenly chameleon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The airy child of vapour and the sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Glittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And blending every colour into one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (For sometimes we must box without the muffle).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our shipwreck'd seamen thought it a good omen--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is as well to think so, now and then;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And may become of great advantage when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Folks are discouraged; and most surely no men<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had greater need to nerve themselves again<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than these, and so this rainbow look'd like hope--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quite a celestial kaleidoscope.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; About this time a beautiful white bird,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Webfooted, not unlike a dove in size<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And plumage (probably it might have err'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon its course), pass'd oft before their eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And tried to perch, although it saw and heard<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The men within the boat, and in this guise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It came and went, and flutter'd round them till<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Night fell: this seem'd a better omen still.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in this case I also must remark,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because the tackle of our shatter'd bark<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was not so safe for roosting as a church;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Returning there from her successful search,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which in their way that moment chanced to fall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With twilight it again came on to blow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But not with violence; the stars shone out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The boat made way; yet now they were so low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They knew not where nor what they were about;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some fancied they saw land, and some said 'No!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all mistook about the latter once.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As morning broke, the light wind died away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he who had the watch sung out and swore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If 't was not land that rose with the sun's ray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He wish'd that land he never might see more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For shore it was, and gradually grew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then of these some part burst into tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And others, looking with a stupid stare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could not yet separate their hopes from fears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And seem'd as if they had no further care;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While a few pray'd (the first time for some years)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the bottom of the boat three were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The day before, fast sleeping on the water,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which yielded a day's life, and to their mind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Proved even still a more nutritious matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because it left encouragement behind:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They thought that in such perils, more than chance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had sent them this for their deliverance.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The land appear'd a high and rocky coast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And higher grew the mountains as they drew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set by a current, toward it: they were lost<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In various conjectures, for none knew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To what part of the earth they had been tost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So changeable had been the winds that blew;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some thought it was Mount AEtna, some the highlands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime the current, with a rising gale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their living freight was now reduced to four,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And three dead, whom their strength could not avail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To heave into the deep with those before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though the two sharks still follow'd them, and dash'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The spray into their faces as they splash'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Famine, despair, cold, thirst, and heat, had done<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their work on them by turns, and thinn'd them to<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such things a mother had not known her son<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By night chill'd, by day scorch'd, thus one by one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They perish'd, until wither'd to these few,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In washing down Pedrillo with salt water.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unequal in its aspect here and there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They felt the freshness of its growing green,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That waved in forest-tops, and smooth'd the air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lovely seem'd any object that should sweep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Away the vast, salt, dread, eternal deep.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And girt by formidable waves; but they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A reef between them also now began<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But finding no place for their landing better,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They ran the boat for shore,--and overset her.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had often turn'd the art to some account:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could, perhaps, have pass'd the Hellespont,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He buoy'd his boyish limbs, and strove to ply<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The beach which lay before him, high and dry:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The greatest danger here was from a shark,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for the other two, they could not swim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So nobody arrived on shore but him.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor yet had he arrived but for the oar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which, providentially for him, was wash'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 't was dash'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Roll'd on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With just enough of life to feel its pain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And deem that it was saved, perhaps in vain.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With slow and staggering effort he arose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But sunk again upon his bleeding knee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And quivering hand; and then he look'd for those<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who long had been his mates upon the sea;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But none of them appear'd to share his woes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save one, a corpse, from out the famish'd three,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who died two days before, and now had found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An unknown barren beach for burial ground.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Swam round and round, and all his senses pass'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Droop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, like a wither'd lily, on the land<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As fair a thing as e'er was form'd of clay.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How long in his damp trance young Juan lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Time had nothing more of night nor day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For his congealing blood, and senses dim;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how this heavy faintness pass'd away<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And tingling vein, seem'd throbbing back to life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Death, though vanquish'd, still retired with strife.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His eyes he open'd, shut, again unclosed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He still was in the boat and had but dozed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wish'd it death in which he had reposed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then once more his feelings back were brought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lovely female face of seventeen.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was bending dose o'er his, and the small mouth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seem'd almost prying into his for breath;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recall'd his answering spirits back from death;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each pulse to animation, till beneath<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To these kind efforts made a low reply.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then was the cordial pour'd, and mantle flung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Raised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pillow'd his death-like forehead; then she wrung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His dewy curls, long drench'd by every storm;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And watch'd with eagerness each throb that drew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sigh from his heaved bosom--and hers, too.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And lifting him with care into the cave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gentle girl and her attendant,--one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And more robust of figure,--then begun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Light to the rocks that roof'd them, which the sun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was, appear'd distinct, and tall, and fair.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In braids behind; and though her stature were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even of the highest for a female mould,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a something which bespoke command,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As one who was a lady in the land.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were black as death, their lashes the same hue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deepest attraction; for when to the view<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is as the snake late coil'd, who pours his length,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hurls at once his venom and his strength.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Short upper lip--sweet lips! that make us sigh<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ever to have seen such; for she was one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fit for the model of a statuary<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (A race of mere impostors, when all's done--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've seen much finer women, ripe and real,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One should not rail without a decent cause:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was an Irish lady, to whose bust<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A frequent model; and if e'er she must<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They will destroy a face which mortal thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ne'er compass'd, nor less mortal chisel wrought.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And such was she, the lady of the cave:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her dress was very different from the Spanish,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, as you know, the Spanish women banish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Around them (what I hope will never vanish)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The basquina and the mantilla, they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seem at the same time mystical and gay.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But with our damsel this was not the case:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her dress was many-colour'd, finely spun;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her locks curl'd negligently round her face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But through them gold and gems profusely shone:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flow'd in her veil, and many a precious stone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Flash'd on her little hand; but, what was shocking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The other female's dress was not unlike,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But of inferior materials: she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had not so many ornaments to strike,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her hair had silver only, bound to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As black, but quicker, and of smaller size.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And these two tended him, and cheer'd him both<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which are (as I must own) of female growth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And have ten thousand delicate inventions:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They made a most superior mess of broth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the best dish that e'er was cook'd since Homer's<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll tell you who they were, this female pair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lest they should seem princesses in disguise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of clap-trap which your recent poets prize;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so, in short, the girls they really were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They shall appear before your curious eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of an old man who lived upon the water.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A fisherman he had been in his youth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And still a sort of fisherman was he;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But other speculations were, in sooth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Added to his connection with the sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little smuggling, and some piracy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Left him, at last, the sole of many masters<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A fisher, therefore, was he,--though of men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Peter the Apostle,--and he fish'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sometimes caught as many as he wish'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The cargoes he confiscated, and gain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sought in the slave-market too, and dish'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a Greek, and on his isle had built<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A very handsome house from out his guilt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there he lived exceedingly at ease;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sad old fellow was he, if you please;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this I know, it was a spacious building,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had an only daughter, call'd Haidee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, so very beautiful was she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She grew to womanhood, and between whiles<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rejected several suitors, just to learn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How to accept a better in his turn.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And walking out upon the beach, below<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Insensible,--not dead, but nearly so,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan, almost famish'd, and half drown'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But being naked, she was shock'd, you know,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet deem'd herself in common pity bound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As far as in her lay, 'to take him in,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A stranger' dying, with so white a skin.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But taking him into her father's house<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was not exactly the best way to save,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But like conveying to the cat the mouse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or people in a trance into their grave;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because the good old man had so much 'nous,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He would have hospitably cured the stranger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And sold him instantly when out of danger.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (A virgin always on her maid relies)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To place him in the cave for present rest:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when, at last, he open'd his black eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their charity increased about their guest;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And their compassion grew to such a size,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It open'd half the turnpike-gates to heaven<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They made a fire,--but such a fire as they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the moment could contrive with such<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Materials as were cast up round the bay,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were nearly tinder, since so long they lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That there was fuel to have furnish'd twenty.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Haidee stripped her sables off to make<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And warm, in case by chance he should awake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They also gave a petticoat apiece,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She and her maid--and promised by daybreak<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus they left him to his lone repose:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just for the present; and in his lull'd head<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not even a vision of his former woes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throbb'd in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unwelcome visions of our former years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young Juan slept all dreamless:--but the maid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who smooth'd his pillow, as she left the den<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Look'd back upon him, and a moment stay'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And turn'd, believing that he call'd again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He slumber'd; yet she thought, at least she said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had pronounced her name--but she forgot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That at this moment Juan knew it not.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And pensive to her father's house she went,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She being wiser by a year or two:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A year or two's an age when rightly spent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which is acquired in Nature's good old college.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fast in his cave, and nothing clash'd upon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the young beams of the excluded sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And need he had of slumber yet, for none<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had suffer'd more--his hardships were comparative<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To those related in my grand-dad's 'Narrative.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not so Haidee: she sadly toss'd and tumbled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dream'd of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And handsome corpses strew'd upon the shore;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And call'd her father's old slaves up, who swore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In several oaths--Armenian, Turk, and Greek--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They knew not what to think of such a freak.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But up she got, and up she made them get,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With some pretence about the sun, that makes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With mist, and every bird with him awakes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And night is flung off like a mourning suit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Worn for a husband,--or some other brute.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I say, the sun is a most glorious sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have sat up on purpose all the night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so all ye, who would be in the right<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In health and purse, begin your day to date<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From daybreak, and when coffin'd at fourscore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Haidee met the morning face to face;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From heart to cheek is curb'd into a blush,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or the Red Sea--but the sea is not red.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And down the cliff the island virgin came,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While the sun smiled on her with his first flame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And young Aurora kiss'd her lips with dew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Taking her for a sister; just the same<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when into the cavern Haidee stepp'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then she stopp'd, and stood as if in awe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as death<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bent with hush'd lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus like to an angel o'er the dying<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who die in righteousness, she lean'd; and there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All tranquilly the shipwreck'd boy was lying,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As o'er him the calm and stirless air:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must breakfast--and betimes, lest they should ask it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She drew out her provision from the basket.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She knew that the best feelings must have victual,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that a shipwreck'd youth would hungry be;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, being less in love, she yawn'd a little,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And felt her veins chill'd by the neighbouring sea;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so, she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can't say that she gave them any tea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Scio wine,--and all for love, not money.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The coffee made, would fain have waken'd Juan;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Haidee stopp'd her with her quick small hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And without word, a sign her finger drew on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because her mistress would not let her break<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That sleep which seem'd as it would ne'er awake.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A purple hectic play'd like dying day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where the blue veins look'd shadowy, shrunk, and weak;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And his black curls were dewy with the spray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which weigh'd upon them yet, all damp and salt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mix'd with the stony vapours of the vault.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hush'd as the babe upon its mother's breast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Droop'd as the willow when no winds can breathe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lull'd like the depth of ocean when at rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In short, he was a very pretty fellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although his woes had turn'd him rather yellow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the fair face which met his eyes forbade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had further sleep a further pleasure made;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For woman's face was never form'd in vain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Juan, so that even when he pray'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He turn'd from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus upon his elbow he arose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And look'd upon the lady, in whose cheek<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The pale contended with the purple rose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As with an effort she began to speak;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although she told him, in good modern Greek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now Juan could not understand a word,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And her voice was the warble of a bird,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sort of sound we echo with a tear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without knowing why--an overpowering tone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whence Melody descends as from a throne.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan gazed as one who is awoke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By a distant organ, doubting if he be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the watchman, or some such reality,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or by one's early valet's cursed knock;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least it is a heavy sound to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who like a morning slumber--for the night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shows stars and women in a better light.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan, too, was help'd out from his dream,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or sleep, or whatso'er it was, by feeling<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A most prodigious appetite: the steam<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon his senses, and the kindling beam<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To stir her viands, made him quite awake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But beef is rare within these oxless isles;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, when a holiday upon them smiles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Others are fair and fertile, among which<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This, though not large, was one of the most rich.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That the old fable of the Minotaur--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From which our modern morals rightly shrinking<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A cow's shape for a mask--was only (sinking<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The allegory) a mere type, no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For we all know that English people are<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fed upon beef--I won't say much of beer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because 't is liquor only, and being far<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From this my subject, has no business here;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We know, too, they very fond of war,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pleasure--like all pleasures--rather dear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So were the Cretans--from which I infer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That beef and battles both were owing to her.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to resume. The languid Juan raised<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His head upon his elbow, and he saw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sight on which he had not lately gazed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As all his latter meals had been quite raw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, feeling still the famish'd vulture gnaw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He fell upon whate'er was offer'd, like<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He ate, and he was well supplied: and she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who watch'd him like a mother, would have fed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such appetite in one she had deem'd dead;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Zoe, being older than Haidee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That famish'd people must be slowly nurst,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so she took the liberty to state,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rather by deeds than words, because the case<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless he wish'd to die upon the place--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She snatch'd it, and refused another morsel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next they--he being naked, save a tatter'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pair of scarce decent trowsers--went to work,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in the fire his recent rags they scatterd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And dress'd him, for the present, like a Turk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or Greek--that is, although it not much matter'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Omitting turban, slippers, pistols, dirk,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They furnish'd him, entire, except some stitches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But not a word could Juan comprehend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although he listen'd so that the young Greek in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, as he interrupted not, went eking<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her speech out to her protege and friend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till pausing at the last her breath to take,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She saw he did not understand Romaic.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And read (the only book she could) the lines<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The answer eloquent, where soul shines<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And darts in one quick glance a long reply;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus in every look she saw exprest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A world of words, and things at which she guess'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And words repeated after her, he took<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt, less of her language than her look:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As he who studies fervently the skies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus Juan learn'd his alpha beta better<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From Haidee's glance than any graven letter.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is pleasing to be school'd in a strange tongue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By female lips and eyes--that is, I mean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When both the teacher and the taught are young,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As was the case, at least, where I have been;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They smile so when one's right, and when one's wrong<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They smile still more, and then there intervene<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I learn'd the little that I know by this:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Italian not at all, having no teachers;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Much English I cannot pretend to speak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Barrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I study, also Blair, the highest reachers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of eloquence in piety and prose--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I hate your poets, so read none of those.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for the ladies, I have nought to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wanderer from the British world of fashion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where I, like other 'dogs, have had my day,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like other men, too, may have had my passion--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But that, like other things, has pass'd away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all her fools whom I could lay the lash on:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Foes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But dreams of what has been, no more to be.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Return we to Don Juan. He begun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hear new words, and to repeat them; but<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some feelings, universal as the sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were such as could not in his breast be shut<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More than within the bosom of a nun:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was in love,--as you would be, no doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With a young benefactress,--so was she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just in the way we very often see.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And every day by daybreak--rather early<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She came into the cave, but it was merely<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To see her bird reposing in his nest;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And she would softly stir his locks so curly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As o'er a bed of roses the sweet south.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And every morn his colour freshlier came,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every day help'd on his convalescence;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was well, because health in the human frame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is pleasant, besides being true love's essence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For health and idleness to passion's flame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without whom Venus will not long attack us.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While Venus fills the heart (without heart really<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love, though good always, is not quite so good),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But who is their purveyor from above<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Heaven knows,--it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Juan woke he found some good things ready,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That ever made a youthful heart less steady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides her maid's as pretty for their size;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I have spoken of all this already--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And repetition's tiresome and unwise,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Well--Juan, after bathing in the sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Came always back to coffee and Haidee.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Both were so young, and one so innocent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That bathing pass'd for nothing; Juan seem'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To her, as 'twere, the kind of being sent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of whom these two years she had nightly dream'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A something to be loved, a creature meant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be her happiness, and whom she deem'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To render happy; all who joy would win<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must share it,--Happiness was born a twin.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was such pleasure to behold him, such<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enlargement of existence to partake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To live with him forever were too much;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But then the thought of parting made her quake;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like a rich wreck--her first love, and her last.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus a moon roll'd on, and fair Haidee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Paid daily visits to her boy, and took<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such plentiful precautions, that still he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remain'd unknown within his craggy nook;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At last her father's prows put out to sea<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For certain merchantmen upon the look,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not as of yore to carry off an Io,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that, her father being at sea, she was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Free as a married woman, or such other<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Female, as where she likes may freely pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without even the incumbrance of a brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The freest she that ever gazed on glass;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now she prolong'd her visits and her talk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So much as to propose to take a walk,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For little had he wander'd since the day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On which, like a young flower snapp'd from the stalk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And saw the sun set opposite the moon.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A better welcome to the tempest-tost;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save on the dead long summer days, which make<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The outstretch'd ocean glitter like a lake.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the small ripple spilt upon the beach<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scarcely o'erpass'd the cream of your champagne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who please,--the more because they preach in vain,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sermons and soda-water the day after.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Man, being reasonable, must get drunk;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The best of life is but intoxication:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Glory, the grape, love, gold, in these are sunk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hopes of all men, and of every nation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without their sap, how branchless were the trunk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to return,--Get very drunk; and when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You wake with headache, you shall see what then.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ring for your valet--bid him quickly bring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some hock and soda-water, then you 'll know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For not the bless'd sherbet, sublimed with snow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Vie with that draught of hock and soda-water.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The coast--I think it was the coast that<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was just describing--Yes, it was the coast--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lay at this period quiet as the sky,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And dolphin's leap, and little billow crost<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By some low rock or shelve, that made it fret<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Against the boundary it scarcely wet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I have said, upon an expedition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save Zoe, who, although with due precision<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She waited on her lady with the sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thought daily service was her only mission,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Circling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the other, and the rosy sky,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With one star sparkling through it like an eye.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over the shining pebbles and the shells,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Glided along the smooth and harden'd sand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the worn and wild receptacles<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Work'd by the storms, yet work'd as it were plann'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yielded to the deep twilight's purple charm.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They gazed upon the glittering sea below,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And saw each other's dark eyes darting light<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into each other--and, beholding this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And beauty, all concentrating like rays<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into one focus, kindled from above;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such kisses as belong to early days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the blood's lava, and the pulse a blaze,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each kiss a heart-quake,--for a kiss's strength,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think, it must be reckon'd by its length.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By length I mean duration; theirs endured<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heaven knows how long--no doubt they never reckon'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if they had, they could not have secured<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sum of their sensations to a second:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They had not spoken; but they felt allured,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if their souls and lips each other beckon'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They were alone, but not alone as they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The silent ocean, and the starlight bay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The twilight glow which momently grew less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The voiceless sands and dropping caves, that lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Around them, made them to each other press,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if there were no life beneath the sky<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save theirs, and that their life could never die.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They felt no terrors from the night, they were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All in all to each other: though their speech<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was broken words, they thought a language there,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all the burning tongues the passions teach<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Found in one sigh the best interpreter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of nature's oracle--first love,--that all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Haidde spoke not of scruples, ask'd no vows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor offer'd any; she had never heard<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of plight and promises to be a spouse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or perils by a loving maid incurr'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was all which pure ignorance allows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And flew to her young mate like a young bird;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had not one word to say of constancy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She loved, and was beloved--she adored,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their intense souls, into each other pour'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If souls could die, had perish'd in that passion,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But by degrees their senses were restored,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, beating 'gainst his bosom, Haidee's heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Felt as if never more to beat apart.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was that in which the heart is always full,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, having o'er itself no further power,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Prompts deeds eternity can not annul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But pays off moments in an endless shower<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of hell-fire--all prepared for people giving<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pleasure or pain to one another living.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! for Juan and Haidee! they were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So loving and so lovely--till then never,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Excepting our first parents, such a pair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had run the risk of being damn'd for ever;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Haidee, being devout as well as fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hell and purgatory--but forgot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just in the very crisis she should not.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They look upon each other, and their eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Round Juan's head, and his around her lies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He hers, until they end in broken gasps;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus they form a group that's quite antique,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when those deep and burning moments pass'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sustain'd his head upon her bosom's charms;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now and then her eye to heaven is cast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pillow'd on her o'erflowing heart, which pants<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With all it granted, and with all it grants.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An infant when it gazes on a light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A child the moment when it drains the breast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A devotee when soars the Host in sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An Arab with a stranger for a guest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A miser filling his most hoarded chest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Feel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All that it hath of life with us is living;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All it hath felt, inflicted, pass'd, and proved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hush'd into depths beyond the watcher's diving:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There lies the thing we love with all its errors<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all its charms, like death without its terrors.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lady watch'd her lover--and that hour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'erflow'd her soul with their united power;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where nought upon their passion could intrude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all the stars that crowded the blue space<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Saw nothing happier than her glowing face.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! the love of women! it is known<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be a lovely and a fearful thing;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For all of theirs upon that die is thrown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To them but mockeries of the past alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Torture is theirs, what they inflict they feel.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is always so to women; one sole bond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Awaits them, treachery is all their trust;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Taught to conceal, their bursting hearts despond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Over their idol, till some wealthier lust<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Buys them in marriage--and what rests beyond?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A thankless husband, next a faithless lover,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then dressing, nursing, praying, and all's over.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some take a lover, some take drams or prayers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some mind their household, others dissipation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some run away, and but exchange their cares,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Few changes e'er can better their affairs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Theirs being an unnatural situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From the dull palace to the dirty hovel:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some play the devil, and then write a novel.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Haidee was Nature's bride, and knew not this;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Haidee was Passion's child, born where the sun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Made but to love, to feel that she was his<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was her chosen: what was said or done<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Elsewhere was nothing. She had naught to fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How much it costs us! yet each rising throb<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is in its cause as its effect so sweet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Joy of its alchymy, and to repeat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To make us understand each good old maxim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So good--I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now 't was done--on the lone shore were plighted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By their own feelings hallow'd and united,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And they were happy, for to their young eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each was an angel, and earth paradise.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, Love! of whom great Caesar was the suitor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Titus the master, Antony the slave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Horace, Catullus, scholars, Ovid tutor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All those may leap who rather would be neuter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, Love! thou art the very god of evil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For, after all, we cannot call thee devil.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Caesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have much employ'd the muse of history's pen;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such worthies Time will never see again;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thou mak'st philosophers; there's Epicurus<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Aristippus, a material crew!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who to immoral courses would allure us<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By theories quite practicable too;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If only from the devil they would insure us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And should he have forgotten her so soon?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't but say it seems to me most truly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Does these things for us, and whenever newly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Else how the devil is it that fresh features<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I hate inconstancy--I loathe, detest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No permanent foundation can be laid;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet last night, being at a masquerade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which gave me some sensations like a villain.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But soon Philosophy came to my aid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And whisper'd, 'Think of every sacred tie!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I will, my dear Philosophy!' I said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or neither--out of curiosity.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'stop!' cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian);<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'stop!' so I stopp'd.--But to return: that which<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men call inconstancy is nothing more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than admiration due where nature's rich<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Profusion with young beauty covers o'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some favour'd object; and as in the niche<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lovely statue we almost adore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This sort of adoration of the real<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is but a heightening of the 'beau ideal.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is the perception of the beautiful,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A fine extension of the faculties,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Platonic, universal, wonderful,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Drawn from the stars, and filter'd through the skies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without which life would be extremely dull;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In short, it is the use of our own eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With one or two small senses added, just<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To hint that flesh is form'd of fiery dust.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet 't is a painful feeling, and unwilling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For surely if we always could perceive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the same object graces quite as killing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As when she rose upon us like an Eve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (For we must get them any how or grieve),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How pleasant for the heart as well as liver!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But changes night and day, too, like the sky;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And darkness and destruction as on high:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But when it hath been scorch'd, and pierced, and riven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pours forth at last the heart's blood turn'd to tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which make the English climate of our years.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The liver is the lazaret of bile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But very rarely executes its function,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the first passion stays there such a while,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all the rest creep in and form a junction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Life knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like earthquakes from the hidden fire call'd 'central,'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the mean time, without proceeding more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this anatomy, I 've finish'd now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That being about the number I 'll allow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For them and theirs with all who deign to read.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="aiii">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CANTO THE THIRD.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; HAIL, Muse! et cetera.--We left Juan sleeping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pillow'd upon a fair and happy breast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And watch'd by eyes that never yet knew weeping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To feel the poison through her spirit creeping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had soil'd the current of her sinless years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And turn'd her pure heart's purest blood to tears!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, Love! what is it in this world of ours<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With cypress branches hast thou Wreathed thy bowers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made thy best interpreter a sigh?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And place them on their breast--but place to die--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In her first passion woman loves her lover,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the others all she loves is love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fits her loosely--like an easy glove,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One man alone at first her heart can move;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She then prefers him in the plural number,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not finding that the additions much encumber.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But one thing's pretty sure; a woman planted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After a decent time must be gallanted;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet there are some, they say, who have had none,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But those who have ne'er end with only one.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of human frailty, folly, also crime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That love and marriage rarely can combine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although they both are born in the same clime;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Marriage from love, like vinegar from wine--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sad, sour, sober beverage--by time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is sharpen'd from its high celestial flavour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Down to a very homely household savour.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's something of antipathy, as 't were,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between their present and their future state;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A kind of flattery that's hardly fair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is used until the truth arrives too late--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet what can people do, except despair?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same things change their names at such a rate;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For instance--passion in a lover's glorious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They sometimes also get a little tired<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The same things cannot always be admired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet 't is'so nominated in the bond,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That both are tied till one shall have expired.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our days, and put one's servants into mourning.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's doubtless something in domestic doings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which forms, in fact, true love's antithesis;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Romances paint at full length people's wooings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But only give a bust of marriages;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He would have written sonnets all his life?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All tragedies are finish'd by a death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All comedies are ended by a marriage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The future states of both are left to faith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For authors fear description might disparage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They say no more of Death or of the Lady.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The only two that in my recollection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have sung of heaven and hell, or marriage, are<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dante and Milton, and of both the affection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of fault or temper ruin'd the connection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar):<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some persons say that Dante meant theology<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Beatrice, and not a mistress--I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although my opinion may require apology,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deem this a commentator's fantasy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Decided thus, and show'd good reason why;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meant to personify the mathematics.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Haidee and Juan were not married, but<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fault was theirs, not mine; it is not fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Chaste reader, then, in any way to put<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The blame on me, unless you wish they were;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The book which treats of this erroneous pair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before the consequences grow too awful;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet they were happy,--happy in the illicit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indulgence of their innocent desires;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But more imprudent grown with every visit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Haidee forgot the island was her sire's;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When we have what we like, 't is hard to miss it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least in the beginning, ere one tires;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus she came often, not a moment losing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whilst her piratical papa was cruising.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For into a prime minister but change<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But he, more modest, took an humbler range<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of life, and in an honester vocation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And merely practised as a sea-attorney.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The good old gentleman had been detain'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By winds and waves, and some important captures;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, in the hope of more, at sea remain'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although a squall or two had damp'd his raptures,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By swamping one of the prizes; he had chain'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His prisoners, dividing them like chapters<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In number'd lots; they all had cuffs and collars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To his Tunis correspondents, save one man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Toss'd overboard unsaleable (being old);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rest--save here and there some richer one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reserved for future ransom--in the hold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were link'd alike, as for the common people he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The merchandise was served in the same way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pieced out for different marts in the Levant;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Except some certain portions of the prey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Light classic articles of female want,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Guitars and castanets from Alicant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All which selected from the spoil he gathers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robb'd for his daughter by the best of fathers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He chose from several animals he saw--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who dying on the coast of Ithaca,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These to secure in this strong blowing weather,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He caged in one huge hamper altogether.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then having settled his marine affairs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despatching single cruisers here and there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His vessel having need of some repairs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shaped his course to where his daughter fair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Continued still her hospitable cares;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His port lay on the other side o' the isle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And there he went ashore without delay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Having no custom-house nor quarantine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To ask him awkward questions on the way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About the time and place where he had been:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He left his ship to be hove down next day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With orders to the people to careen;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that all hands were busy beyond measure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arriving at the summit of a hill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which overlook'd the white walls of his home,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He stopp'd.--What singular emotions fill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With love for many, and with fears for some;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The approach of home to husbands and to sires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After long travelling by land or water,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most naturally some small doubt inspires--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A female family's a serious matter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (None trusts the sex more, or so much admires--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An honest gentleman at his return<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The odds are that he finds a handsome urn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To his memory--and two or three young misses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that his Argus--bites him by the breeches.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If single, probably his plighted fair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But all the better, for the happy pair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May quarrel, and the lady growing wiser,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He may resume his amatory care<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As cavalier servente, or despise her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Write odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And oh! ye gentlemen who have already<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some chaste liaison of the kind--I mean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An honest friendship with a married lady--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The only thing of this sort ever seen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To last--of all connections the most steady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the true Hymen (the first's but a screen)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet for all that keep not too long away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've known the absent wrong'd four times a day.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Much less experience of dry land than ocean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the true reason of his not being sad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or that of any other strong emotion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He saw his white walls shining in the sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His garden trees all shadowy and green;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The distant dog-bark; and perceived between<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The umbrage of the wood so cool and dun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of arms (in the East all arm)--and various dyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of colour'd garbs, as bright as butterflies.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as the spot where they appear he nears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He hears--alas! no music of the spheres,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But an unhallow'd, earthly sound of fiddling!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A melody which made him doubt his ears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A most unoriental roar of laughter.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And still more nearly to the place advancing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Descending rather quickly the declivity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Midst other indications of festivity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing a troop of his domestics dancing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To which the Levantines are very partial.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And further on a group of Grecian girls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were strung together like a row of pearls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Link'd hand in hand, and dancing; each too having<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Down her white neck long floating auburn curls<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (The least of which would set ten poets raving);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their leader sang--and bounded to her song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With choral step and voice, the virgin throng.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And here, assembled cross-legg'd round their trays,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Small social parties just begun to dine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Above them their dessert grew on its vine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dropp'd in their laps, scarce pluck'd, their mellow store.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A band of children, round a snow-white ram,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While peaceful as if still an unwean'd lamb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His sober head, majestically tame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His brow, as if in act to butt, and then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The innocence which happy childhood blesses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that the philosophical beholder<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sigh'd for their sakes--that they should e'er grow older.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of rocks bewitch'd that open to the knockers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Transform'd their lords to beasts (but that's a fact).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here was no lack of innocent diversion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the imagination or the senses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perceiving in his absence such expenses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dreading that climax of all human ills,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The inflammation of his weekly bills.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ah! what is man? what perils still environ<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The happiest mortals even after dinner--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A day of gold from out an age of iron<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is all that life allows the luckiest sinner;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pleasure (whene'er she sings, at least)'s a siren,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lambro's reception at his people's banquet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was such as fire accords to a wet blanket.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He--being a man who seldom used a word<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (In general he surprised men with the sword)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His daughter--had not sent before to advise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of his arrival, so that no one stirr'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And long he paused to re-assure his eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact much more astonish'd than delighted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To find so much good company invited.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He did not know (alas! how men will lie)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That a report (especially the Greeks)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Avouch'd his death (such people never die),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And put his house in mourning several weeks,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now their eyes and also lips were dry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The bloom, too, had return'd to Haidee's cheeks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her tears, too, being return'd into their fount,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She now kept house upon her own account.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which turn'd the isle into a place of pleasure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The servants all were getting drunk or idling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A life which made them happy beyond measure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her father's hospitality seem'd middling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Compared with what Haidee did with his treasure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was wonderful how things went on improving,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While she had not one hour to spare from loving.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He flew into a passion, and in fact<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was no mighty reason to be pleased;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To teach his people to be more exact,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that, proceeding at a very high rate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He show'd the royal penchants of a pirate.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 're wrong.--He was the mildest manner'd man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With such true breeding of a gentleman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You never could divine his real thought;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No courtier could, and scarcely woman can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gird more deceit within a petticoat;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pity he loved adventurous life's variety,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was so great a loss to good society.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Advancing to the nearest dinner tray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With a peculiar smile, which, by the way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Boded no good, whatever it express'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He ask'd the meaning of this holiday;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His question, much too merry to divine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And without turning his facetious head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Presented the o'erflowing cup, and said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Talking's dry work, I have no time to spare.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A second hiccup'd, 'Our old master's dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You 'd better ask our mistress who's his heir.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Our mistress!' quoth a third: 'Our mistress!--pooh!--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You mean our master--not the old, but new.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They thus address'd--and Lambro's visage fell--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And o'er his eye a momentary gloom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pass'd, but he strove quite courteously to quell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The expression, and endeavouring to resume<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His smile, requested one of them to tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The name and quality of his new patron,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who seem'd to have turn'd Haidee into a matron.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I know not,' quoth the fellow, 'who or what<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is, nor whence he came--and little care;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this I know, that this roast capon's fat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that good wine ne'er wash'd down better fare;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if you are not satisfied with that,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Direct your questions to my neighbour there;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He 'll answer all for better or for worse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For none likes more to hear himself converse.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I said that Lambro was a man of patience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly he show'd the best of breeding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which scarce even France, the paragon of nations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E'er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He bore these sneers against his near relations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The insults, too, of every servile glutton,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who all the time was eating up his mutton.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now in a person used to much command--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bid men come, and go, and come again--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To see his orders done, too, out of hand--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether the word was death, or but the chain--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It may seem strange to find his manners bland;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet such things are, which I can not explain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though doubtless he who can command himself<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is good to govern--almost as a Guelf.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not that he was not sometimes rash or so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But never in his real and serious mood;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He lay coil'd like the boa in the wood;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With him it never was a word and blow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in his silence there was much to rue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And his one blow left little work for two.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He ask'd no further questions, and proceeded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On to the house, but by a private way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that the few who met him hardly heeded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So little they expected him that day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If love paternal in his bosom pleaded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Haidee's sake, is more than I can say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But certainly to one deem'd dead, returning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This revel seem'd a curious mode of mourning.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If all the dead could now return to life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Which God forbid!) or some, or a great many,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For instance, if a husband or his wife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Nuptial examples are as good as any),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt whate'er might be their former strife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The present weather would be much more rainy--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tears shed into the grave of the connection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would share most probably its resurrection.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He enter'd in the house no more his home,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing to human feelings the most trying,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And harder for the heart to overcome,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To find our hearthstone turn'd into a tomb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And round its once warm precincts palely lying<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond a single gentleman's belief.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He enter'd in the house--his home no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For without hearts there is no home; and felt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The solitude of passing his own door<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without a welcome; there he long had dwelt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Over the innocence of that sweet child,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His only shrine of feelings undefiled.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a man of a strange temperament,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Moderate in all his habits, and content<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With temperance in pleasure, as in food,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quick to perceive, and strong to bear, and meant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For something better, if not wholly good;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His country's wrongs and his despair to save her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The love of power, and rapid gain of gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hardness by long habitude produced,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The dangerous life in which he had grown old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The mercy he had granted oft abused,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sights he was accustom'd to behold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had cost his enemies a long repentance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But something of the spirit of old Greece<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flash'd o'er his soul a few heroic rays,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such as lit onward to the Golden Fleece<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His predecessors in the Colchian days;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; T is true he had no ardent love for peace--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! his country show'd no path to praise:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hate to the world and war with every nation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still o'er his mind the influence of the clime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shed its Ionian elegance, which show'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its power unconsciously full many a time,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A taste seen in the choice of his abode,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A love of music and of scenes sublime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pleasure in the gentle stream that flow'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bedew'd his spirit in his calmer hours.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But whatsoe'er he had of love reposed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On that beloved daughter; she had been<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The only thing which kept his heart unclosed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lonely pure affection unopposed:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There wanted but the loss of this to wean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His feelings from all milk of human kindness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The cubless tigress in her jungle raging<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ocean when its yeasty war is waging<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is awful to the vessel near the rock;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But violent things will sooner bear assuaging,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their fury being spent by its own shock,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of a strong human heart, and in a sire.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a hard although a common case<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To find our children running restive--they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In whom our brightest days we would retrace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our little selves re-form'd in finer clay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as old age is creeping on apace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And clouds come o'er the sunset of our day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in good company--the gout or stone.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet a fine family is a fine thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Provided they don't come in after dinner);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is beautiful to see a matron bring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like cherubs round an altar-piece they cling<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the fire-side (a sight to touch a sinner).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lady with her daughters or her nieces<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Old Lambro pass'd unseen a private gate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And stood within his hall at eventide;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime the lady and her lover sate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At wassail in their beauty and their pride:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An ivory inlaid table spread with state<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before them, and fair slaves on every side;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gems, gold, and silver, form'd the service mostly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mother of pearl and coral the less costly.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The dinner made about a hundred dishes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lamb and pistachio nuts--in short, all meats,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were of the finest that e'er flounced in nets,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Drest to a Sybarite's most pamper'd wishes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The beverage was various sherbets<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Mocha's berry, from Arabia pure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In small fine China cups, came in at last;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gold cups of filigree made to secure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hand from burning underneath them placed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Cloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boil'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Up with the coffee, which (I think) they spoil'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The hangings of the room were tapestry, made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of velvet panels, each of different hue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And round them ran a yellow border too;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The upper border, richly wrought, display'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Embroider'd delicately o'er with blue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soft Persian sentences, in lilac letters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From poets, or the moralists their betters.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These Oriental writings on the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quite common in those countries, are a kind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of monitors adapted to recall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And took his kingdom from him: You will find,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though sages may pour out their wisdom's treasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A beauty at the season's close grown hectic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A genius who has drunk himself to death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A rake turn'd methodistic, or Eclectic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (For that's the name they like to pray beneath)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But most, an alderman struck apoplectic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are things that really take away the breath,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And show that late hours, wine, and love are able<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To do not much less damage than the table.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Haidee and Juan carpeted their feet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On crimson satin, border'd with pale blue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their sofa occupied three parts complete<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the apartment--and appear'd quite new;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were scarlet, from whose glowing centre grew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sun emboss'd in gold, whose rays of tissue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meridian-like, were seen all light to issue.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Crystal and marble, plate and porcelain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over the floors were spread; gazelles and cats,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And dwarfs and blacks, and such like things, that gain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their bread as ministers and favourites (that's<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To say, by degradation) mingled there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As plentiful as in a court, or fair.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was no want of lofty mirrors, and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tables, most of ebony inlaid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or were of tortoise-shell or rare woods made,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fretted with gold or silver:--by command,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The greater part of these were ready spread<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With viands and sherbets in ice--and wine--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the dresses I select Haidee's:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She wore two jelicks--one was of pale yellow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of azure, pink, and white was her chemise--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With buttons form'd of pearls as large as peas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like fleecy clouds about the moon, flow'd round her.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One large gold bracelet clasp'd each lovely arm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lockless--so pliable from the pure gold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That the hand stretch'd and shut it without harm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The limb which it adorn'd its only mould;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So beautiful--its very shape would charm;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, clinging as if loath to lose its hold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That e'er by precious metal was held in.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Around, as princess of her father's land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A like gold bar above her instep roll'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Below her breast was fasten'd with a band<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furl'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; About the prettiest ankle in the world.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flow'd like an Alpine torrent which the sun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dyes with his morning light,--and would conceal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her person if allow'd at large to run,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And still they seem resentfully to feel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To offer his young pinion as her fan.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Round her she made an atmosphere of life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They were so soft and beautiful, and rife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all we can imagine of the skies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Too pure even for the purest human ties;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her overpowering presence made you feel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It would not be idolatry to kneel.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (It is the country's custom), but in vain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The glossy rebels mock'd the jetty stain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in their native beauty stood avenged:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her nails were touch'd with henna; but again<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The power of art was turn'd to nothing, for<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They could not look more rosy than before.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The henna should be deeply dyed to make<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had no need of this, day ne'er will break<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The eye might doubt if it were well awake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was so like a vision; I might err,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Shakspeare also says, 't is very silly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'To gild refined gold, or paint the lily'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan had on a shawl of black and gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But a white baracan, and so transparent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sparkling gems beneath you might behold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like small stars through the milky way apparent;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His turban, furl'd in many a graceful fold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An emerald aigrette with Haidee's hair in 't<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Surmounted as its clasp--a glowing crescent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose rays shone ever trembling, but incessant.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now they were diverted by their suite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which made their new establishment complete;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The last was of great fame, and liked to show it:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His verses rarely wanted their due feet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for his theme--he seldom sung below it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He being paid to satirize or flatter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the psalm says, 'inditing a good matter.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He praised the present, and abused the past,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reversing the good custom of old days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An Eastern anti-jacobin at last<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He turn'd, preferring pudding to no praise--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For some few years his lot had been o'ercast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By his seeming independent in his lays,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With truth like Southey, and with verse like Crashaw.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a man who had seen many changes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And always changed as true as any needle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His polar star being one which rather ranges,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not the fix'd--he knew the way to wheedle:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So vile he'scaped the doom which oft avenges;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And being fluent (save indeed when fee'd ill),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He lied with such a fervour of intention--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But he had genius,--when a turncoat has it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 'Vates irritabilis' takes care<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That without notice few full moons shall pass it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even good men like to make the public stare:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to my subject--let me see--what was it?--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh!--the third canto--and the pretty pair--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of living in their insular abode.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In company a very pleasant fellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had been the favourite of full many a mess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And though his meaning they could rarely guess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet still they deign'd to hiccup or to bellow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The glorious meed of popular applause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now being lifted into high society,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And having pick'd up several odds and ends<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of free thoughts in his travels for variety,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He deem'd, being in a lone isle, among friends,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That, without any danger of a riot, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Might for long lying make himself amends;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, singing as he sung in his warm youth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Agree to a short armistice with truth.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had travell'd 'mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And knew the self-loves of the different nations;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And having lived with people of all ranks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had something ready upon most occasions--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which got him a few presents and some thanks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He varied with some skill his adulations;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To 'do at Rome as Romans do,' a piece<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of conduct was which he observed in Greece.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, usually, when he was ask'd to sing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gave the different nations something national;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was all the same to him--'God save the king,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or 'Ca ira,' according to the fashion all:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His muse made increment of any thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From the high lyric down to the low rational:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If Pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In France, for instance, he would write a chanson;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In England a six canto quarto tale;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Spain, he'd make a ballad or romance on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The last war--much the same in Portugal;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Germany, the Pegasus he 'd prance on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would be old Goethe's (see what says De Stael);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Italy he 'd ape the 'Trecentisti;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Greece, he sing some sort of hymn like this t' ye:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;               THE ISLES OF GREECE.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     The isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Where burning Sappho loved and sung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Where grew the arts of war and peace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Eternal summer gilds them yet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     But all, except their sun, is set.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     The Scian and the Teian muse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       The hero's harp, the lover's lute,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Have found the fame your shores refuse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Their place of birth alone is mute<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     To sounds which echo further west<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Than your sires' 'Islands of the Blest.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     The mountains look on Marathon--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       And Marathon looks on the sea;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     And musing there an hour alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       I dream'd that Greece might still be free;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     For standing on the Persians' grave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     I could not deem myself a slave.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     A king sate on the rocky brow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     And ships, by thousands, lay below,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       And men in nations;--all were his!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     He counted them at break of day--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     And when the sun set where were they?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     And where are they? and where art thou,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       My country? On thy voiceless shore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     The heroic lay is tuneless now--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       The heroic bosom beats no more!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     And must thy lyre, so long divine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Degenerate into hands like mine?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     'T is something, in the dearth of fame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Though link'd among a fetter'd race,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     To feel at least a patriot's shame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Even as I sing, suffuse my face;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     For what is left the poet here?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     For Greeks a blush--for Greece a tear.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Must we but weep o'er days more blest?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Must we but blush?--Our fathers bled.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Earth! render back from out thy breast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       A remnant of our Spartan dead!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Of the three hundred grant but three,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     To make a new Thermopylae!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     What, silent still? and silent all?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Ah! no;--the voices of the dead<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Sound like a distant torrent's fall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       And answer, 'Let one living head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     But one arise,--we come, we come!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     'T is but the living who are dumb.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     In vain--in vain: strike other chords;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Fill high the cup with Samian wine!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       And shed the blood of Scio's vine!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Hark! rising to the ignoble call--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     How answers each bold Bacchanal!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Of two such lessons, why forget<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       The nobler and the manlier one?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     You have the letters Cadmus gave--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Think ye he meant them for a slave?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       We will not think of themes like these!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     It made Anacreon's song divine:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       He served--but served Polycrates--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     A tyrant; but our masters then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Were still, at least, our countrymen.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     The tyrant of the Chersonese<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Was freedom's best and bravest friend;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     That tyrant was Miltiades!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Oh! that the present hour would lend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Another despot of the kind!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Such chains as his were sure to bind.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Exists the remnant of a line<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Such as the Doric mothers bore;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     The Heracleidan blood might own.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Trust not for freedom to the Franks--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       They have a king who buys and sells;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     In native swords, and native ranks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       The only hope of courage dwells;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Would break your shield, however broad.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Our virgins dance beneath the shade--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     I see their glorious black eyes shine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       But gazing on each glowing maid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     My own the burning tear-drop laves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     To think such breasts must suckle slaves<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Place me on Sunium's marbled steep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       Where nothing, save the waves and I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;       There, swan-like, let me sing and die:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus sung, or would, or could, or should have sung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The modern Greek, in tolerable verse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If not like Orpheus quite, when Greece was young,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet in these times he might have done much worse:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His strain display'd some feeling--right or wrong;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And feeling, in a poet, is the source<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of others' feeling; but they are such liars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And take all colours--like the hands of dyers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But words are things, and a small drop of ink,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is strange, the shortest letter which man uses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of speech, may form a lasting link<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of ages; to what straits old Time reduces<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Frail man, when paper--even a rag like this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Survives himself, his tomb, and all that's his.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when his bones are dust, his grave a blank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His station, generation, even his nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Become a thing, or nothing, save to rank<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In chronological commemoration,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some dull MS. oblivion long has sank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or graven stone found in a barrack's station<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In digging the foundation of a closet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May turn his name up, as a rare deposit.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And glory long has made the sages smile;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is something, nothing, words, illusion, wind--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Depending more upon the historian's style<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than on the name a person leaves behind:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Troy owes to Homer what whist owes to Hoyle:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The present century was growing blind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the great Marlborough's skill in giving knocks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until his late life by Archdeacon Coxe.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Milton's the prince of poets--so we say;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little heavy, but no less divine:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An independent being in his day--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Learn'd, pious, temperate in love and wine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, his life falling into Johnson's way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We 're told this great high priest of all the Nine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was whipt at college--a harsh sire--odd spouse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the first Mrs. Milton left his house.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All these are, certes, entertaining facts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Shakspeare's stealing deer, Lord Bacon's bribes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Titus' youth, and Caesar's earliest acts;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Burns (whom Doctor Currie well describes);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Cromwell's pranks;--but although truth exacts<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These amiable descriptions from the scribes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As most essential to their hero's story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They do not much contribute to his glory.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All are not moralists, like Southey, when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He prated to the world of 'Pantisocracy;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or Wordsworth unexcised, unhired, who then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Season'd his pedlar poems with democracy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or Coleridge, long before his flighty pen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let to the Morning Post its aristocracy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When he and Southey, following the same path,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Espoused two partners (milliners of Bath).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such names at present cut a convict figure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The very Botany Bay in moral geography;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their loyal treason, renegado rigour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are good manure for their more bare biography.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wordsworth's last quarto, by the way, is bigger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than any since the birthday of typography;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A drowsy frowzy poem, call'd the 'Excursion.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Writ in a manner which is my aversion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He there builds up a formidable dyke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between his own and others' intellect;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Wordsworth's poem, and his followers, like<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Joanna Southcote's Shiloh, and her sect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are things which in this century don't strike<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The public mind,--so few are the elect;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the new births of both their stale virginities<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have proved but dropsies, taken for divinities.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But let me to my story: I must own,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I have any fault, it is digression--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaving my people to proceed alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While I soliloquize beyond expression;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But these are my addresses from the throne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which put off business to the ensuing session:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Forgetting each omission is a loss to<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I know that what our neighbours call 'longueurs'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (We 've not so good a word, but have the thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In that complete perfection which ensures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An epic from Bob Southey every spring),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Form not the true temptation which allures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The reader; but 't would not be hard to bring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some fine examples of the epopee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To prove its grand ingredient is ennui.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We learn from Horace, 'Homer sometimes sleeps;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We feel without him, Wordsworth sometimes wakes,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To show with what complacency he creeps,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With his dear 'Waggoners,' around his lakes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He wishes for 'a boat' to sail the deeps--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of ocean?--No, of air; and then he makes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another outcry for 'a little boat,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And drivels seas to set it well afloat.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If he must fain sweep o'er the ethereal plain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Pegasus runs restive in his 'Waggon,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could he not beg the loan of Charles's Wain?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or pray Medea for a single dragon?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or if, too classic for his vulgar brain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He fear'd his neck to venture such a nag on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And he must needs mount nearer to the moon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could not the blockhead ask for a balloon?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Pedlars,' and 'Boats,' and 'Waggons!' Oh! ye shades<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Pope and Dryden, are we come to this?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That trash of such sort not alone evades<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contempt, but from the bathos' vast abyss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Floats scumlike uppermost, and these Jack Cades<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of sense and song above your graves may hiss--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The 'little boatman' and his 'Peter Bell'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Can sneer at him who drew 'Achitophel'!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; T' our tale.--The feast was over, the slaves gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dwarfs and dancing girls had all retired;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Arab lore and poet's song were done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every sound of revelry expired;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lady and her lover, left alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The rosy flood of twilight's sky admired;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ave Maria! o'er the earth and sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That heavenliest hour of Heaven is worthiest thee!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ave Maria! blessed be the hour!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The time, the clime, the spot, where I so oft<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have felt that moment in its fullest power<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sink o'er the earth so beautiful and soft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While swung the deep bell in the distant tower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or the faint dying day-hymn stole aloft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And not a breath crept through the rosy air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet the forest leaves seem'd stirr'd with prayer.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ave Maria! 't is the hour of prayer!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ave Maria! 't is the hour of love!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ave Maria! may our spirits dare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look up to thine and to thy Son's above!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ave Maria! oh that face so fair!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those downcast eyes beneath the Almighty dove--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What though 't is but a pictured image?--strike--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That painting is no idol,--'t is too like.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some kinder casuists are pleased to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In nameless print--that I have no devotion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But set those persons down with me to pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you shall see who has the properest notion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of getting into heaven the shortest way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My altars are the mountains and the ocean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Earth, air, stars,--all that springs from the great Whole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who hath produced, and will receive the soul.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sweet hour of twilight!--in the solitude<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the pine forest, and the silent shore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which bounds Ravenna's immemorial wood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rooted where once the Adrian wave flow'd o'er,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To where the last Caesarean fortress stood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Evergreen forest! which Boccaccio's lore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Dryden's lay made haunted ground to me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How have I loved the twilight hour and thee!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The shrill cicadas, people of the pine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Making their summer lives one ceaseless song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were the sole echoes, save my steed's and mine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And vesper bell's that rose the boughs along;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The spectre huntsman of Onesti's line,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His hell-dogs, and their chase, and the fair throng<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which learn'd from this example not to fly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From a true lover,--shadow'd my mind's eye.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, Hesperus! thou bringest all good things--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the young bird the parent's brooding wings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The welcome stall to the o'erlabour'd steer;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er of peace about our hearthstone clings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er our household gods protect of dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are gather'd round us by thy look of rest;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thou bring'st the child, too, to the mother's breast.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soft hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of those who sail the seas, on the first day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When they from their sweet friends are torn apart;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or fills with love the pilgrim on his way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the far bell of vesper makes him start,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seeming to weep the dying day's decay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is this a fancy which our reason scorns?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Nero perish'd by the justest doom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which ever the destroyer yet destroy'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst the roar of liberated Rome,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of nations freed, and the world overjoy'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some hands unseen strew'd flowers upon his tomb:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of feeling for some kindness done, when power<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I 'm digressing; what on earth has Nero,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or any such like sovereign buffoons,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To do with the transactions of my hero,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More than such madmen's fellow man--the moon's?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sure my invention must be down at zero,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I grown one of many 'wooden spoons'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of verse (the name with which we Cantabs please<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To dub the last of honours in degrees).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I feel this tediousness will never do--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is being too epic, and I must cut down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (In copying) this long canto into two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They 'll never find it out, unless I own<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fact, excepting some experienced few;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then as an improvement 't will be shown:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll prove that such the opinion of the critic is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From Aristotle passim.--See poietikes.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="aiv">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;          CANTO THE FOURTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; NOTHING so difficult as a beginning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In poesy, unless perhaps the end;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For oftentimes when Pegasus seems winning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The race, he sprains a wing, and down we tend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Lucifer when hurl'd from heaven for sinning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our sin the same, and hard as his to mend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Being pride, which leads the mind to soar too far,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till our own weakness shows us what we are.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Time, which brings all beings to their level,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sharp Adversity, will teach at last<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Man,--and, as we would hope,--perhaps the devil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That neither of their intellects are vast:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While youth's hot wishes in our red veins revel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We know not this--the blood flows on too fast;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as the torrent widens towards the ocean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We ponder deeply on each past emotion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wish'd that others held the same opinion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They took it up when my days grew more mellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And other minds acknowledged my dominion:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now my sere fancy 'falls into the yellow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leaf,' and Imagination droops her pinion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Turns what was once romantic to burlesque.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if I laugh at any mortal thing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is that our nature cannot always bring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Itself to apathy, for we must steep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our hearts first in the depths of Lethe's spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A mortal mother would on Lethe fix.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some have accused me of a strange design<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against the creed and morals of the land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And trace it in this poem every line:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't pretend that I quite understand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My own meaning when I would be very fine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the fact is that I have nothing plann'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless it were to be a moment merry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A novel word in my vocabulary.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the kind reader of our sober clime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This way of writing will appear exotic;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pulci was sire of the half-serious rhyme,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who sang when chivalry was more Quixotic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And revell'd in the fancies of the time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; True knights, chaste dames, huge giants, kings despotic:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But all these, save the last, being obsolete,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I chose a modern subject as more meet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How I have treated it, I do not know;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps no better than they have treated me<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who have imputed such designs as show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not what they saw, but what they wish'd to see:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And tells me to resume my story here.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young Juan and his lady-love were left<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To their own hearts' most sweet society;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even Time the pitiless in sorrow cleft<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sigh'd to behold them of their hours bereft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though foe to love; and yet they could not be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meant to grow old, but die in happy spring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before one charm or hope had taken wing.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The blank grey was not made to blast their hair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They were all summer: lightning might assail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shiver them to ashes, but to trail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A long and snake-like life of dull decay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was not for them--they had too little day.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They were alone once more; for them to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus was another Eden; they were never<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Weary, unless when separate: the tree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cut from its forest root of years--the river<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Damm'd from its fountain--the child from the knee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And breast maternal wean'd at once for ever,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would wither less than these two torn apart;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! there is no instinct like the heart--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The heart--which may be broken: happy they!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The precious porcelain of human clay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The long year link'd with heavy day on day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all which must be borne, and never told;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While life's strange principle will often lie<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Deepest in those who long the most to die.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Whom the gods love die young,' was said of yore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And many deaths do they escape by this:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The death of friends, and that which slays even more--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The death of friendship, love, youth, all that is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Except mere breath; and since the silent shore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Awaits at last even those who longest miss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The old archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which men weep over may be meant to save.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Haidee and Juan thought not of the dead--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The heavens, and earth, and air, seem'd made for them:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each was the other's mirror, and but read<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And knew such brightness was but the reflection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of their exchanging glances of affection.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The least glance better understood than words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A language, too, but like to that of birds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Known but to them, at least appearing such<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As but to lovers a true sense affords;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard,--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All these were theirs, for they were children still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And children still they should have ever been;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They were not made in the real world to fill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A busy character in the dull scene,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But like two beings born from out a rill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A nymph and her beloved, all unseen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And never know the weight of human hours.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Moons changing had roll'd on, and changeless found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As rarely they beheld throughout their round;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the mere senses; and that which destroys<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most love, possession, unto them appear'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A thing which each endearment more endear'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh beautiful! and rare as beautiful<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But theirs was love in which the mind delights<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To lose itself when the old world grows dull,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Intrigues, adventures of the common school,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose husband only knows her not a wh--re.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hard words; harsh truth; a truth which many know.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enough.--The faithful and the fairy pair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who never found a single hour too slow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What was it made them thus exempt from care?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young innate feelings all have felt below,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which perish in the rest, but in them were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Inherent--what we mortals call romantic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And always envy, though we deem it frantic.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is in others a factitious state,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An opium dream of too much youth and reading,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But was in them their nature or their fate:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Haidee's knowledge was by no means great,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that there was no reason for their loves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More than for those of nightingales or doves.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dear unto all, but dearest to their eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For it had made them what they were: the power<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of love had first o'erwhelm'd them from such skies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When happiness had been their only dower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And twilight saw them link'd in passion's ties;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Charm'd with each other, all things charm'd that brought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The past still welcome as the present thought.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I know not why, but in that hour to-night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When one is shook in sound, and one in sight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus some boding flash'd through either frame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And call'd from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While one new tear arose in Haidee's eye.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That large black prophet eye seem'd to dilate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And follow far the disappearing sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if their last day! of a happy date<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His glance inquired of hers for some excuse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She turn'd to him, and smiled, but in that sort<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which makes not others smile; then turn'd aside:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever feeling shook her, it seem'd short,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And master'd by her wisdom or her pride;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Juan spoke, too--it might be in sport--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this their mutual feeling, she replied--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'If it should be so,--but--it cannot be--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or I at least shall not survive to see.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan would question further, but she press'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defying augury with that fond kiss;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some people prefer wine--'t is not amiss;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have tried both; so those who would a part take<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May choose between the headache and the heartache.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the two, according to your choice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Woman or wine, you 'll have to undergo;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Both maladies are taxes on our joys:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But which to choose, I really hardly know;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if I had to give a casting voice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For both sides I could many reasons show,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then decide, without great wrong to either,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It were much better to have both than neither.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan and Haidee gazed upon each other<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which mix'd all feelings, friend, child, lover, brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All that the best can mingle and express<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When two pure hearts are pour'd in one another,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And love too much, and yet can not love less;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But almost sanctify the sweet excess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By the immortal wish and power to bless.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mix'd in each other's arms, and heart in heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why did they not then die?--they had lived too long<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world was not for them, nor the world's art<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For beings passionate as Sappho's song;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love was born with them, in them, so intense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was their very spirit--not a sense.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They should have lived together deep in woods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unseen as sings the nightingale; they were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unfit to mix in these thick solitudes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Call'd social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How lonely every freeborn creature broods!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Flock o'er their carrion, just like men below.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now pillow'd cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Haidee and Juan their siesta took,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ever and anon a something shook<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Haidee's sweet lips murmur'd like a brook<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A wordless music, and her face so fair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stirr'd with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or as the stirring of a deep dear stream<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The mystical usurper of the mind--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good to the soul which we no more can bind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Senseless to feel, and with seal'd eyes to see.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She dream'd of being alone on the sea-shore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chain'd to a rock; she knew not how, but stir<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She could not from the spot, and the loud roar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And o'er her upper lip they seem'd to pour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until she sobb'd for breath, and soon they were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Anon--she was released, and then she stray'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And stumbled almost every step she made;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And something roll'd before her in a sheet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was white and indistinct, nor stopp'd to meet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And ran, but it escaped her as she clasp'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The dream changed:--in a cave she stood, its walls<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were hung with marble icicles, the work<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of ages on its water-fretted halls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her hair was dripping, and the very balls<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of her black eyes seem'd turn'd to tears, and mirk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sharp rocks look'd below each drop they caught,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which froze to marble as it fell,--she thought.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pale as the foam that froth'd on his dead brow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which she essay'd in vain to clear (how sweet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were once her cares, how idle seem'd they now!),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his quench'd heart; and the sea dirges low<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rang in her sad ears like a mermaid's song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that brief dream appear'd a life too long.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And gazing on the dead, she thought his face<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Faded, or alter'd into something new--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like to her father's features, till each trace--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And starting, she awoke, and what to view?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is--'t is her father's--fix'd upon the pair!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Him whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perchance the death of one she loved too well:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dear as her father had been to Haidee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a moment of that awful kind--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen such--but must not call to mind.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Up Juan sprung to Haidee's bitter shriek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And caught her falling, and from off the wall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Snatch'd down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Smiled scornfully, and said, 'Within my call,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A thousand scimitars await the word;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Put up, young man, put up your silly sword.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Haidee clung around him; 'Juan, 't is--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is Lambro--'t is my father! Kneel with me--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He will forgive us--yes--it must be--yes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh! dearest father, in this agony<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of pleasure and of pain--even while I kiss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy garment's hem with transport, can it be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; High and inscrutable the old man stood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not always signs with him of calmest mood:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He look'd upon her, but gave no reply;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then turn'd to Juan, in whose cheek the blood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Young man, your sword;' so Lambro once more said:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan replied, 'Not while this arm is free.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And drawing from his belt a pistol, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Replied, 'Your blood be then on your own head.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was fresh--for he had lately used the lock--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And next proceeded quietly to cock.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That cocking of a pistol, when you know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A moment more will bring the sight to bear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A gentlemanly distance, not too near,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you have got a former friend for foe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But after being fired at once or twice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lambro presented, and one instant more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had stopp'd this Canto, and Don Juan's breath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Haidee threw herself her boy before;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stern as her sire: 'On me,' she cried, 'let death<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Descend--the fault is mine; this fatal shore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He found--but sought not. I have pledged my faith;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I love him--I will die with him: I knew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your nature's firmness--know your daughter's too.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A minute past, and she had been all tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tenderness, and infancy; but now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She stood as one who champion'd human fears--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pale, statue-like, and stern, she woo'd the blow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She drew up to her height, as if to show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A fairer mark; and with a fix'd eye scann'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her father's face--but never stopp'd his hand.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How like they look'd! the expression was the same;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Serenely savage, with a little change<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the large dark eye's mutual-darted flame;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For she, too, was as one who could avenge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If cause should be--a lioness, though tame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her father's blood before her father's face<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Boil'd up, and proved her truly of his race.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I said they were alike, their features and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their stature, differing but in sex and years;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even to the delicacy of their hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now to see them, thus divided, stand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fix'd ferocity, when joyous tears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And sweet sensations should have welcomed both,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Show what the passions are in their full growth.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The father paused a moment, then withdrew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And looking on her, as to look her through,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Not I,' he said, 'have sought this stranger's ill;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not I have made this desolation: few<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I must do my duty--how thou hast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Done thine, the present vouches for the past.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Let him disarm; or, by my father's head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His own shall roll before you like a ball!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He raised his whistle, as the word he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And blew; another answer'd to the call,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And rushing in disorderly, though led,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And arm'd from boot to turban, one and all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some twenty of his train came, rank on rank;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He gave the word,--'Arrest or slay the Frank.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His daughter; while compress'd within his clasp,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In vain she struggled in her father's grasp--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The file of pirates; save the foremost, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The second had his cheek laid open; but<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The blows upon his cutlass, and then put<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His own well in; so well, ere you could look,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His man was floor'd, and helpless at his foot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the blood running like a little brook<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From two smart sabre gashes, deep and red--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One on the arm, the other on the head.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then they bound him where he fell, and bore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan from the apartment: with a sign<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until they reach'd some galliots, placed in line;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On board of one of these, and under hatches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They stow'd him, with strict orders to the watches.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world is full of strange vicissitudes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A gentleman so rich in the world's goods,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just at the very time when he least broods<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On such a thing is suddenly to sea sent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wounded and chain'd, so that he cannot move,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all because a lady fell in love.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moved by the Chinese nymph of tears, green tea!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than whom Cassandra was not more prophetic;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if my pure libations exceed three,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I feel my heart become so sympathetic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I must have recourse to black Bohea:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is pity wine should be so deleterious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For tea and coffee leave us much more serious,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless when qualified with thee, Cogniac!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sweet Naiad of the Phlegethontic rill!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ah! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I would take refuge in weak punch, but rack<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (In each sense of the word), whene'er I fill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My mild and midnight beakers to the brim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wakes me next morning with its synonym.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I leave Don Juan for the present, safe--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet could his corporal pangs amount to half<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of those with which his Haidee's bosom bounded?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then give way, subdued because surrounded;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her mother was a Moorish maid, from Fez,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where all is Eden, or a wilderness.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There the large olive rains its amber store<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gush from the earth until the land runs o'er;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And midnight listens to the lion's roar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or heaving whelm the helpless caravan;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as the soil is, so the heart of man.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Afric is all the sun's, and as her earth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her human day is kindled; full of power<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For good or evil, burning from its birth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Moorish blood partakes the planet's hour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And like the soil beneath it will bring forth:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beauty and love were Haidee's mother's dower;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But her large dark eye show'd deep Passion's force,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though sleeping like a lion near a source.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her daughter, temper'd with a milder ray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till slowly charged with thunder they display<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had held till now her soft and milky way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But overwrought with passion and despair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fire burst forth from her Numidian veins,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even as the Simoom sweeps the blasted plains.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The last sight which she saw was Juan's gore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he himself o'ermaster'd and cut down;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His blood was running on the very floor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus much she view'd an instant and no more,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On her sire's arm, which until now scarce held<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her writhing, fell she like a cedar fell'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A vein had burst, and her sweet lips' pure dyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And her head droop'd as when the lily lies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'ercharged with rain: her summon'd handmaids bore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But she defied all means they could employ,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like one life could not hold, nor death destroy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With nothing livid, still her lips were red;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had no pulse, but death seem'd absent still;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No hideous sign proclaim'd her surely dead;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Corruption came not in each mind to kill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; New thoughts of life, for it seem'd full of soul--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had so much, earth could not claim the whole.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ruling passion, such as marble shows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When exquisitely chisell'd, still lay there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But fix'd as marble's unchanged aspect throws<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'er the fair Venus, but for ever fair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'er the Laocoon's all eternal throes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ever-dying Gladiator's air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their energy like life forms all their fame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet looks not life, for they are still the same.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rather the dead, for life seem'd something new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A strange sensation which she must partake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perforce, since whatsoever met her view<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Struck not on memory, though a heavy ache<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lay at her heart, whose earliest beat still true<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For, for a while, the furies made a pause.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She look'd on many a face with vacant eye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On many a token without knowing what;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She saw them watch her without asking why,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And reck'd not who around her pillow sat;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not speechless, though she spoke not; not a sigh<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Relieved her thoughts; dull silence and quick chat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were tried in vain by those who served; she gave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No sign, save breath, of having left the grave.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her father watch'd, she turn'd her eyes away;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She recognized no being, and no spot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However dear or cherish'd in their day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They changed from room to room--but all forgot--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gentle, but without memory she lay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Back to old thoughts, wax'd full of fearful meaning.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then a slave bethought her of a harp;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The harper came, and tuned his instrument;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the first notes, irregular and sharp,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then to the wall she turn'd as if to warp<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And he begun a long low island song<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of ancient days, ere tyranny grew strong.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In time to his old tune; he changed the theme,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And sung of love; the fierce name struck through all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her recollection; on her flash'd the dream<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of what she was, and is, if ye could call<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be so being; in a gushing stream<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The tears rush'd forth from her o'erclouded brain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Short solace, vain relief!--thought came too quick,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And whirl'd her brain to madness; she arose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As one who ne'er had dwelt among the sick,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And flew at all she met, as on her foes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But no one ever heard her speak or shriek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although her paroxysm drew towards its dose;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hers was a phrensy which disdain'd to rave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even when they smote her, in the hope to save.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet she betray'd at times a gleam of sense;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing could make her meet her father's face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though on all other things with looks intense<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Food she refused, and raiment; no pretence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Avail'd for either; neither change of place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Senses to sleep--the power seem'd gone for ever.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Twelve days and nights she wither'd thus; at last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A parting pang, the spirit from her past:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And they who watch'd her nearest could not know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very instant, till the change that cast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Glazed o'er her eyes--the beautiful, the black--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh! to possess such lustre--and then lack!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She died, but not alone; she held within<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A second principle of life, which might<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have dawn'd a fair and sinless child of sin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But closed its little being without light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And went down to the grave unborn, wherein<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blossom and bough lie wither'd with one blight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In vain the dews of Heaven descend above<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus lived--thus died she; never more on her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which colder hearts endure till they are laid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By age in earth: her days and pleasures were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Brief, but delightful--such as had not staid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That isle is now all desolate and bare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its dwellings down, its tenants pass'd away;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; None but her own and father's grave is there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And nothing outward tells of human clay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No stone is there to show, no tongue to say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What was; no dirge, except the hollow sea's,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mourns o'er the beauty of the Cyclades.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But many a Greek maid in a loving song<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sighs o'er her name; and many an islander<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With her sire's story makes the night less long;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Valour was his, and beauty dwelt with her:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A heavy price must all pay who thus err,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In some shape; let none think to fly the danger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For soon or late Love is his own avenger.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But let me change this theme which grows too sad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't much like describing people mad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For fear of seeming rather touch'd myself--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, I 've no more on this head to add;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as my Muse is a capricious elf,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We 'll put about, and try another tack<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Juan, left half-kill'd some stanzas back.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wounded and fetter'd, 'cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some days and nights elapsed before that he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could altogether call the past to mind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when he did, he found himself at sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sailing six knots an hour before the wind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another time he might have liked to see 'em,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Flank'd by the Hellespont and by the sea)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Entomb'd the bravest of the brave, Achilles;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They say so (Bryant says the contrary):<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And further downward, tall and towering still, is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tumulus--of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All heroes, who if living still would slay us.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; High barrows, without marble or a name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A vast, untill'd, and mountain-skirted plain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Ida in the distance, still the same,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The situation seems still form'd for fame--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A hundred thousand men might fight again<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With case; but where I sought for Ilion's walls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Troops of untended horses; here and there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A moment at the European youth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A turk, with beads in hand and pipe in mouth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Extremely taken with his own religion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are what I found there--but the devil a Phrygian.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan, here permitted to emerge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'ershadow'd there by many a hero's grave;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Weak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A few brief questions; and the answers gave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No very satisfactory information<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; About his past or present situation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He saw some fellow captives, who appear'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be Italians, as they were in fact;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From them, at least, their destiny he heard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which was an odd one; a troop going to act<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Sicily (all singers, duly rear'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In their vocation) had not been attack'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In sailing from Livorno by the pirate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But sold by the impresario at no high rate.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By one of these, the buffo of the party,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan was told about their curious case;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For although destined to the Turkish mart, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still kept his spirits up--at least his face;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The little fellow really look'd quite hearty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bore him with some gaiety and grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Showing a much more reconciled demeanour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than did the prima donna and the tenor.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a few words he told their hapless story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saying, 'Our Machiavellian impresario,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Making a signal off some promontory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hail'd a strange brig--Corpo di Caio Mario!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We were transferr'd on board her in a hurry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without a Single scudo of salario;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But if the Sultan has a taste for song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We will revive our fortunes before long.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'The prima donna, though a little old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And haggard with a dissipated life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With no great voice, is pleasing to behold;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Last carnival she made a deal of strife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From an old Roman princess at Bologna.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'And then there are the dancers; there's the Nini,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With more than one profession, gains by all;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She, too, was fortunate last carnival,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And made at least five hundred good zecchini,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then there's the Grotesca--such a dancer!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'As for the figuranti, they are like<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The rest of all that tribe; with here and there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A pretty person, which perhaps may strike,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet has a sentimental kind of air<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which might go far, but she don't dance with vigour;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The more's the pity, with her face and figure.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'As for the men, they are a middling set;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The musico is but a crack'd old basin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But being qualified in one way yet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May the seraglio do to set his face in,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as a servant some preferment get;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His singing I no further trust can place in:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From all the Pope makes yearly 't would perplex<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To find three perfect pipes of the third sex.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'The tenor's voice is spoilt by affectation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for the bass, the beast can only bellow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, he had no singing education,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An ignorant, noteless, timeless, tuneless fellow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But being the prima donna's near relation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who swore his voice was very rich and mellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They hired him, though to hear him you 'd believe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An ass was practising recitative.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ''T would not become myself to dwell upon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My own merits, and though young--I see, Sir--you<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have got a travell'd air, which speaks you one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To whom the opera is by no means new:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 've heard of Raucocanti?--I 'm the man;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The time may come when you may hear me too;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You was not last year at the fair of Lugo,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But next, when I 'm engaged to sing there--do go.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Our baritone I almost had forgot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pretty lad, but bursting with conceit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With graceful action, science not a jot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A voice of no great compass, and not sweet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He always is complaining of his lot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forsooth, scarce fit for ballads in the street;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In lovers' parts his passion more to breathe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Having no heart to show, he shows his teeth.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here Raucocanti's eloquent recital<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was interrupted by the pirate crew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who came at stated moments to invite all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The captives back to their sad berths; each threw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A rueful glance upon the waves (which bright all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From the blue skies derived a double blue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dancing all free and happy in the sun),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then went down the hatchway one by one.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They heard next day--that in the Dardanelles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Waiting for his Sublimity's firman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The most imperative of sovereign spells,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which every body does without who can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More to secure them in their naval cells,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lady to lady, well as man to man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were to be chain'd and lotted out per couple,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the slave market of Constantinople.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seems when this allotment was made out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who (after some discussion and some doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the soprano might be deem'd to be male,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They placed him o'er the women as a scout)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were link'd together, and it happen'd the male<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was Juan,--who, an awkward thing at his age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pair'd off with a Bacchante blooming visage.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Raucocanti lucklessly was chain'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tenor; these two hated with a hate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Found only on the stage, and each more pain'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sad strife arose, for they were so cross-grain'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of bearing up without debate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That each pull'd different ways with many an oath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Arcades ambo,' id est--blackguards both.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan's companion was a Romagnole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But bred within the March of old Ancona,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With eyes that look'd into the very soul<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (And other chief points of a 'bella donna'),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bright--and as black and burning as a coal;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And through her dear brunette complexion shone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Great wish to please--a most attractive dower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Especially when added to the power.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But all that power was wasted upon him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though thus chain'd, as natural her hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Touch'd his, nor that--nor any handsome limb<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (And she had some not easy to withstand)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No matter; we should ne'er too much enquire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And firmer faith no ladye-love desire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We will omit the proofs, save one or two:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is said no one in hand 'can hold a fire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By thought of frosty Caucasus;' but few,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I really think; yet Juan's then ordeal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was more triumphant, and not much less real.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here I might enter on a chaste description,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Having withstood temptation in my youth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But hear that several people take exception<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the first two books having too much truth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore I 'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because the publisher declares, in sooth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through needles' eyes it easier for the camel is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To pass, than those two cantos into families.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is all the same to me; I 'm fond of yielding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore leave them to the purer page<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Smollett, Prior, Ariosto, Fielding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who say strange things for so correct an age;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I once had great alacrity in wielding<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My pen, and liked poetic war to wage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And recollect the time when all this cant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would have provoked remarks which now it shan't.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As boys love rows, my boyhood liked a squabble;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But at this hour I wish to part in peace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaving such to the literary rabble:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether my verse's fame be doom'd to cease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While the right hand which wrote it still is able,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or of some centuries to take a lease,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The grass upon my grave will grow as long,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of poets who come down to us through distance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of time and tongues, the foster-babes of Fame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Life seems the smallest portion of existence;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where twenty ages gather o'er a name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is as a snowball which derives assistance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From every flake, and yet rolls on the same,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even till an iceberg it may chance to grow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, after all, 't is nothing but cold snow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so great names are nothing more than nominal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And love of glory's but an airy lust,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Too often in its fury overcoming all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who would as 't were identify their dust<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From out the wide destruction, which, entombing all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leaves nothing till 'the coming of the just'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save change: I 've stood upon Achilles' tomb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very generations of the dead<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until the memory of an age is fled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where are the epitaphs our fathers read?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save a few glean'd from the sepulchral gloom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which once-named myriads nameless lie beneath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And lose their own in universal death.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I canter by the spot each afternoon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where perish'd in his fame the hero-boy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who lived too long for men, but died too soon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For human vanity, the young De Foix!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A broken pillar, not uncouthly hewn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But which neglect is hastening to destroy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Records Ravenna's carnage on its face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While weeds and ordure rankle round the base.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I pass each day where Dante's bones are laid:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little cupola, more neat than solemn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Protects his dust, but reverence here is paid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the bard's tomb, and not the warrior's column.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The time must come, when both alike decay'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The chieftain's trophy, and the poet's volume,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before Pelides' death, or Homer's birth.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With human blood that column was cemented,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With human filth that column is defiled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if the peasant's coarse contempt were vented<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To show his loathing of the spot he soil'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus is the trophy used, and thus lamented<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Instinct of gore and glory earth has known<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those sufferings Dante saw in hell alone.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet there will still be bards: though fame is smoke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its fumes are frankincense to human thought;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the unquiet feelings, which first woke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Song in the world, will seek what then they sought;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As on the beach the waves at last are broke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus to their extreme verge the passions brought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dash into poetry, which is but passion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or at least was so ere it grew a fashion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If in the course of such a life as was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At once adventurous and contemplative,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men, who partake all passions as they pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Acquire the deep and bitter power to give<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their images again as in a glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in such colours that they seem to live;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You may do right forbidding them to show 'em,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh! ye, who make the fortunes of all books!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Benign Ceruleans of the second sex!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who advertise new poems by your looks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your 'imprimatur' will ye not annex?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What! must I go to the oblivious cooks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ah! must I then the only minstrel be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Proscribed from tasting your Castalian tea!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What! can I prove 'a lion' then no more?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A ball-room bard, a foolscap, hot-press darling?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To bear the compliments of many a bore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sigh, 'I can't get out,' like Yorick's starling;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why then I 'll swear, as poet Wordy swore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Because the world won't read him, always snarling),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh! 'darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As some one somewhere sings about the sky,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I, ye learned ladies, say of you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have examined few pair of that hue);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blue as the garters which serenely lie<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Round the Patrician left-legs, which adorn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The festal midnight, and the levee morn.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet some of you are most seraphic creatures--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But times are alter'd since, a rhyming lover,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You read my stanzas, and I read your features:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And--but no matter, all those things are over;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still I have no dislike to learned natures,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For sometimes such a world of virtues cover;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I knew one woman of that purple school,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The loveliest, chastest, best, but--quite a fool.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Humboldt, 'the first of travellers,' but not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The last, if late accounts be accurate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Invented, by some name I have forgot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well as the sublime discovery's date,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An airy instrument, with which he sought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To ascertain the atmospheric state,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By measuring 'the intensity of blue:'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, Lady Daphne! let me measure you!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to the narrative:--The vessel bound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With slaves to sell off in the capital,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the usual process, might be found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At anchor under the seraglio wall;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were landed in the market, one and all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bought up for different purposes and passions.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Warranted virgin; beauty's brightest colours<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had deck'd her out in all the hues of heaven:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who bade on till the hundreds reach'd eleven;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But when the offer went beyond, they knew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Twelve negresses from Nubia brought a price<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which the West Indian market scarce would bring;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What 't was ere Abolition; and the thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Need not seem very wonderful, for vice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is always much more splendid than a king:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are saving--vice spares nothing for a rarity.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But for the destiny of this young troop,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How some were bought by pachas, some by Jews,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And others rose to the command of crews<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As renegadoes; while in hapless group,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hoping no very old vizier might choose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The females stood, as one by one they pick'd 'em,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All this must be reserved for further song;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also our hero's lot, howe'er unpleasant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Because this Canto has become too long),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Must be postponed discreetly for the present;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm sensible redundancy is wrong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But could not for the muse of me put less in 't:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now delay the progress of Don Juan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till what is call'd in Ossian the fifth Juan.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="av">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;              CANTO THE FIFTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; WHEN amatory poets sing their loves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In liquid lines mellifluously bland,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And pair their rhymes as Venus yokes her doves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They little think what mischief is in hand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The greater their success the worse it proves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Ovid's verse may give to understand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even Petrarch's self, if judged with due severity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is the Platonic pimp of all posterity.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I therefore do denounce all amorous writing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except in such a way as not to attract;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Plain--simple--short, and by no means inviting,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But with a moral to each error tack'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Form'd rather for instructing than delighting,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with all passions in their turn attack'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, if my Pegasus should not be shod ill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This poem will become a moral model.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The European with the Asian shore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sprinkled with palaces; the ocean stream<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here and there studded with a seventy-four;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sophia's cupola with golden gleam;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The cypress groves; Olympus high and hoar;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The twelve isles, and the more than I could dream,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Far less describe, present the very view<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which charm'd the charming Mary Montagu.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have a passion for the name of 'Mary,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For once it was a magic sound to me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And still it half calls up the realms of fairy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where I beheld what never was to be;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All feelings changed, but this was last to vary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A spell from which even yet I am not quite free:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I grow sad--and let a tale grow cold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which must not be pathetically told.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wind swept down the Euxine, and the wave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Broke foaming o'er the blue Symplegades;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is a grand sight from off 'the Giant's Grave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To watch the progress of those rolling seas<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Between the Bosphorus, as they lash and lave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Europe and Asia, you being quite at ease;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's not a sea the passenger e'er pukes in,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Turns up more dangerous breakers than the Euxine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was a raw day of Autumn's bleak beginning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When nights are equal, but not so the days;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Parcae then cut short the further spinning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of seamen's fates, and the loud tempests raise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The waters, and repentance for past sinning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all, who o'er the great deep take their ways:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They vow to amend their lives, and yet they don't;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because if drown'd, they can't--if spared, they won't.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A crowd of shivering slaves of every nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And age, and sex, were in the market ranged;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each bevy with the merchant in his station:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poor creatures! their good looks were sadly changed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All save the blacks seem'd jaded with vexation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From friends, and home, and freedom far estranged;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The negroes more philosophy display'd,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Used to it, no doubt, as eels are to be flay'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan was juvenile, and thus was full,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As most at his age are, of hope and health;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I must own he looked a little dull,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now and then a tear stole down by stealth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps his recent loss of blood might pull<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His spirit down; and then the loss of wealth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A mistress, and such comfortable quarters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To be put up for auction amongst Tartars,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were things to shake a stoic; ne'ertheless,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the whole his carriage was serene:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His figure, and the splendour of his dress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which some gilded remnants still were seen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Drew all eyes on him, giving them to guess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was above the vulgar by his mien;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then, though pale, he was so very handsome;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then--they calculated on his ransom.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like a backgammon board the place was dotted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With whites and blacks, in groups on show for sale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though rather more irregularly spotted:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some bought the jet, while others chose the pale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It chanced amongst the other people lotted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man of thirty rather stout and hale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With resolution in his dark grey eye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next Juan stood, till some might choose to buy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had an English look; that is, was square<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In make, of a complexion white and ruddy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Good teeth, with curling rather dark brown hair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, it might be from thought or toil or study,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An open brow a little mark'd with care:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One arm had on a bandage rather bloody;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And there he stood with such sang-froid, that greater<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could scarce be shown even by a mere spectator.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But seeing at his elbow a mere lad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of a high spirit evidently, though<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At present weigh'd down by a doom which had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'erthrown even men, he soon began to show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A kind of blunt compassion for the sad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lot of so young a partner in the woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which for himself he seem'd to deem no worse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than any other scrape, a thing of course.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'My boy!' said he, 'amidst this motley crew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Georgians, Russians, Nubians, and what not,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All ragamuffins differing but in hue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With whom it is our luck to cast our lot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The only gentlemen seem I and you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So let us be acquainted, as we ought:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If I could yield you any consolation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T would give me pleasure.--Pray, what is your nation?'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Juan answer'd--'Spanish!' he replied,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I thought, in fact, you could not be a Greek;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those servile dogs are not so proudly eyed:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fortune has play'd you here a pretty freak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But that's her way with all men, till they 're tried;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But never mind,--she 'll turn, perhaps, next week;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She has served me also much the same as you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Except that I have found it nothing new.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Pray, sir,' said Juan, 'if I may presume,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What brought you here?'--'Oh! nothing very rare--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Six Tartars and a drag-chain.'--'To this doom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what conducted, if the question's fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is that which I would learn.'--'I served for some<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Months with the Russian army here and there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And taking lately, by Suwarrow's bidding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A town, was ta'en myself instead of Widdin.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Have you no friends?'--'I had--but, by God's blessing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have not been troubled with them lately. Now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have answer'd all your questions without pressing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you an equal courtesy should show.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Alas!' said Juan, ''t were a tale distressing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And long besides.'--'Oh! if 't is really so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 're right on both accounts to hold your tongue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sad tale saddens doubly, when 't is long.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But droop not: Fortune at your time of life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although a female moderately fickle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will hardly leave you (as she's not your wife)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For any length of days in such a pickle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To strive, too, with our fate were such a strife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if the corn-sheaf should oppose the sickle:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men are the sport of circumstances, when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The circumstances seem the sport of men.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ''T is not,' said Juan, 'for my present doom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I mourn, but for the past;--I loved a maid:'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He paused, and his dark eye grew full of gloom;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A single tear upon his eyelash staid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A moment, and then dropp'd; 'but to resume,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is not my present lot, as I have said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which I deplore so much; for I have borne<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hardships which have the hardiest overworn,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'On the rough deep. But this last blow-' and here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He stopp'd again, and turn'd away his face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Ay,' quoth his friend, 'I thought it would appear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That there had been a lady in the case;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And these are things which ask a tender tear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as I, too, would shed if in your place:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I cried upon my first wife's dying day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And also when my second ran away:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'My third-'--'Your third!' quoth Juan, turning round;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'You scarcely can be thirty: have you three?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'No--only two at present above ground:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Surely 't is nothing wonderful to see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One person thrice in holy wedlock bound!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Well, then, your third,' said Juan; 'what did she?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She did not run away, too,--did she, sir?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'No, faith.'--'What then?'--'I ran away from her.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'You take things coolly, sir,' said Juan. 'Why,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Replied the other, 'what can a man do?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There still are many rainbows in your sky,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But mine have vanish'd. All, when life is new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Commence with feelings warm, and prospects high;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But time strips our illusions of their hue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And one by one in turn, some grand mistake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Casts off its bright skin yearly like the snake.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ''T is true, it gets another bright and fresh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or fresher, brighter; but the year gone through,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This skin must go the way, too, of all flesh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or sometimes only wear a week or two;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love's the first net which spreads its deadly mesh;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ambition, Avarice, Vengeance, Glory, glue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The glittering lime-twigs of our latter days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where still we flutter on for pence or praise.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'All this is very fine, and may be true,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said Juan; 'but I really don't see how<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It betters present times with me or you.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'No?' quoth the other; 'yet you will allow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By setting things in their right point of view,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Knowledge, at least, is gain'd; for instance, now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We know what slavery is, and our disasters<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May teach us better to behave when masters.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Would we were masters now, if but to try<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their present lessons on our Pagan friends here,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Said Juan,--swallowing a heart-burning sigh:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Heaven help the scholar whom his fortune sends here!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Perhaps we shall be one day, by and by,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rejoin'd the other, when our bad luck mends here;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime (yon old black eunuch seems to eye us)<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But after all, what is our present state?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is bad, and may be better--all men's lot:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most men are slaves, none more so than the great,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To their own whims and passions, and what not;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Society itself, which should create<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kindness, destroys what little we had got:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To feel for none is the true social art<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the world's stoics--men without a heart.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just now a black old neutral personage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the third sex stept up, and peering over<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The captives, seem'd to mark their looks and age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And capabilities, as to discover<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If they were fitted for the purposed cage:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No lady e'er is ogled by a lover,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Horse by a blackleg, broadcloth by a tailor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fee by a counsel, felon by a jailor,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As is a slave by his intended bidder.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is pleasant purchasing our fellow-creatures;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all are to be sold, if you consider<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their passions, and are dext'rous; some by features<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are bought up, others by a warlike leader,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some by a place--as tend their years or natures;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The most by ready cash--but all have prices,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From crowns to kicks, according to their vices.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The eunuch, having eyed them o'er with care,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turn'd to the merchant, and begun to bid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; First but for one, and after for the pair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They haggled, wrangled, swore, too--so they did!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As though they were in a mere Christian fair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cheapening an ox, an ass, a lamb, or kid;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that their bargain sounded like a battle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For this superior yoke of human cattle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At last they settled into simple grumbling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pulling out reluctant purses, and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Turning each piece of silver o'er, and tumbling<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some down, and weighing others in their hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And by mistake sequins with paras jumbling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until the sum was accurately scann'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then the merchant giving change, and signing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Receipts in full, began to think of dining.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wonder if his appetite was good?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or, if it were, if also his digestion?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Methinks at meals some odd thoughts might intrude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And conscience ask a curious sort of question,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; About the right divine how far we should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sell flesh and blood. When dinner has opprest one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which turns up out of the sad twenty-four.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Voltaire says 'No:' he tells you that Candide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Found life most tolerable after meals;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He's wrong--unless man were a pig, indeed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Repletion rather adds to what he feels,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless he's drunk, and then no doubt he's freed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From his own brain's oppression while it reels.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of food I think with Philip's son, or rather<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ammon's (ill pleased with one world and one father);<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think with Alexander, that the act<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of eating, with another act or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Makes us feel our mortality in fact<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Redoubled; when a roast and a ragout,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fish, and soup, by some side dishes back'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can give us either pain or pleasure, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would pique himself on intellects, whose use<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Depends so much upon the gastric juice?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The other evening ('t was on Friday last)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a fact and no poetic fable--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as my great coat was about me cast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My hat and gloves still lying on the table,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I heard a shot--'t was eight o'clock scarce past--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, running out as fast as I was able,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I found the military commandant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stretch'd in the street, and able scarce to pant.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Poor fellow! for some reason, surely bad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They had slain him with five slugs; and left him there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To perish on the pavement: so I had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Him borne into the house and up the stair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And stripp'd and look'd to--But why should I ad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More circumstances? vain was every care;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The man was gone: in some Italian quarrel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kill'd by five bullets from an old gun-barrel.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I gazed upon him, for I knew him well;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though I have seen many corpses, never<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Saw one, whom such an accident befell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So calm; though pierced through stomach, heart, and liver,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He seem'd to sleep,--for you could scarcely tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (As he bled inwardly, no hideous river<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of gore divulged the cause) that he was dead:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So as I gazed on him, I thought or said--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Can this be death? then what is life or death?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Speak!' but he spoke not: 'Wake!' but still he slept:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But yesterday and who had mightier breath?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thousand warriors by his word were kept<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In awe: he said, as the centurion saith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Go," and he goeth; "come," and forth he stepp'd.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The trump and bugle till he spake were dumb--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now nought left him but the muffled drum.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And they who waited once and worshipp'd--they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With their rough faces throng'd about the bed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To gaze once more on the commanding clay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which for the last, though not the first, time bled:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And such an end! that he who many a day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had faced Napoleon's foes until they fled,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The foremost in the charge or in the sally,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Should now be butcher'd in a civic alley.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The scars of his old wounds were near his new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those honourable scars which brought him fame;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And horrid was the contrast to the view--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But let me quit the theme; as such things claim<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps even more attention than is due<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From me: I gazed (as oft I have gazed the same)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To try if I could wrench aught out of death<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which should confirm, or shake, or make a faith;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But it was all a mystery. Here we are,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there we go:--but where? five bits of lead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or three, or two, or one, send very far!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And is this blood, then, form'd but to be shed?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Can every element our elements mar?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And air--earth--water--fire live--and we dead?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We whose minds comprehend all things? No more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But let us to the story as before.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The purchaser of Juan and acquaintance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bore off his bargains to a gilded boat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Embark'd himself and them, and off they went thence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As fast as oars could pull and water float;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They look'd like persons being led to sentence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wondering what next, till the caique was brought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Up in a little creek below a wall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'ertopp'd with cypresses, dark-green and tall.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here their conductor tapping at the wicket<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of a small iron door, 't was open'd, and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He led them onward, first through a low thicket<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flank'd by large groves, which tower'd on either hand:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They almost lost their way, and had to pick it--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For night was dosing ere they came to land.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The eunuch made a sign to those on board,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who row'd off, leaving them without a word.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As they were plodding on their winding way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through orange bowers, and jasmine, and so forth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Of which I might have a good deal to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There being no such profusion in the North<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of oriental plants, 'et cetera,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that of late your scribblers think it worth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their while to rear whole hotbeds in their works<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because one poet travell'd 'mongst the Turks)--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As they were threading on their way, there came<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into Don Juan's head a thought, which he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whisper'd to his companion:--'t was the same<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which might have then occurr'd to you or me.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Methinks,' said he, 'it would be no great shame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If we should strike a stroke to set us free;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let's knock that old black fellow on the head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And march away--'t were easier done than said.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yes,' said the other, 'and when done, what then?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How get out? how the devil got we in?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when we once were fairly out, and when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From Saint Bartholomew we have saved our skin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To-morrow 'd see us in some other den,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And worse off than we hitherto have been;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, I 'm hungry, and just now would take,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Esau, for my birthright a beef-steak.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'We must be near some place of man's abode;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the old negro's confidence in creeping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With his two captives, by so queer a road,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shows that he thinks his friends have not been sleeping;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A single cry would bring them all abroad:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is therefore better looking before leaping--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And there, you see, this turn has brought us through,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By Jove, a noble palace!--lighted too.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was indeed a wide extensive building<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which open'd on their view, and o'er the front<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There seem'd to be besprent a deal of gilding<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And various hues, as is the Turkish wont,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A gaudy taste; for they are little skill'd in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The arts of which these lands were once the font:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each villa on the Bosphorus looks a screen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; New painted, or a pretty opera-scene.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And nearer as they came, a genial savour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of certain stews, and roast-meats, and pilaus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Things which in hungry mortals' eyes find favour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made Juan in his harsh intentions pause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And put himself upon his good behaviour:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His friend, too, adding a new saving clause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Said, 'In Heaven's name let's get some supper now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then I 'm with you, if you 're for a row.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some talk of an appeal unto some passion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some to men's feelings, others to their reason;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The last of these was never much the fashion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For reason thinks all reasoning out of season.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some speakers whine, and others lay the lash on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But more or less continue still to tease on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With arguments according to their 'forte;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But no one dreams of ever being short.--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I digress: of all appeals,--although<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I grant the power of pathos, and of gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling,--no<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Method's more sure at moments to take hold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More tender, as we every day behold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than that all-softening, overpowering knell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The tocsin of the soul--the dinner-bell.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Turkey contains no bells, and yet men dine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan and his friend, albeit they heard<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No Christian knoll to table, saw no line<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of lackeys usher to the feast prepared,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet smelt roast-meat, beheld a huge fire shine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cooks in motion with their clean arms bared,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And gazed around them to the left and right<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the prophetic eye of appetite.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And giving up all notions of resistance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They follow'd close behind their sable guide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who little thought that his own crack'd existence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was on the point of being set aside:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He motion'd them to stop at some small distance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And knocking at the gate, 't was open'd wide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And a magnificent large hall display'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Asian pomp of Ottoman parade.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I won't describe; description is my forte,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But every fool describes in these bright days<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His wondrous journey to some foreign court,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spawns his quarto, and demands your praise--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Death to his publisher, to him 't is sport;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While Nature, tortured twenty thousand ways,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Resigns herself with exemplary patience<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To guide-books, rhymes, tours, sketches, illustrations.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Along this hall, and up and down, some, squatted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon their hams, were occupied at chess;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Others in monosyllable talk chatted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some seem'd much in love with their own dress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And divers smoked superb pipes decorated<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With amber mouths of greater price or less;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And several strutted, others slept, and some<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Prepared for supper with a glass of rum.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the black eunuch enter'd with his brace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of purchased Infidels, some raised their eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A moment without slackening from their pace;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But those who sate ne'er stirr'd in anywise:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One or two stared the captives in the face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as one views a horse to guess his price;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some nodded to the negro from their station,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But no one troubled him with conversation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He leads them through the hall, and, without stopping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On through a farther range of goodly rooms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Splendid but silent, save in one, where, dropping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A marble fountain echoes through the glooms<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of night which robe the chamber, or where popping<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some female head most curiously presumes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To thrust its black eyes through the door or lattice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As wondering what the devil a noise that is.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some faint lamps gleaming from the lofty walls<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gave light enough to hint their farther way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But not enough to show the imperial halls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the flashing of their full array;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps there's nothing--I 'll not say appals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But saddens more by night as well as day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than an enormous room without a soul<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To break the lifeless splendour of the whole.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two or three seem so little, one seems nothing:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In deserts, forests, crowds, or by the shore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There solitude, we know, has her full growth in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The spots which were her realms for evermore;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in a mighty hall or gallery, both in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More modern buildings and those built of yore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A kind of death comes o'er us all alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing what's meant for many with but one.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A neat, snug study on a winter's night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A book, friend, single lady, or a glass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of claret, sandwich, and an appetite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are things which make an English evening pass;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though certes by no means so grand a sight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As is a theatre lit up by gas.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I pass my evenings in long galleries solely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that's the reason I 'm so melancholy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! man makes that great which makes him little:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I grant you in a church 't is very well:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What speaks of Heaven should by no means be brittle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But strong and lasting, till no tongue can tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their names who rear'd it; but huge houses fit ill--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And huge tombs worse--mankind, since Adam fell:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Methinks the story of the tower of Babel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Might teach them this much better than I 'm able.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Babel was Nimrod's hunting-box, and then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A town of gardens, walls, and wealth amazing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where Nabuchadonosor, king of men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reign'd, till one summer's day he took to grazing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Daniel tamed the lions in their den,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The people's awe and admiration raising;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was famous, too, for Thisbe and for Pyramus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the calumniated queen Semiramis.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That injured Queen by chroniclers so coarse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has been accused (I doubt not by conspiracy)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of an improper friendship for her horse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Love, like religion, sometimes runs to heresy):<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This monstrous tale had probably its source<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (For such exaggerations here and there I see)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In writing 'Courser' by mistake for 'Courier:'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish the case could come before a jury here.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to resume,--should there be (what may not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be in these days?) some infidels, who don't,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because they can't find out the very spot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of that same Babel, or because they won't<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Though Claudius Rich, Esquire, some bricks has got,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And written lately two memoirs upon't),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Believe the Jews, those unbelievers, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must be believed, though they believe not you,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet let them think that Horace has exprest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shortly and sweetly the masonic folly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of those, forgetting the great place of rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who give themselves to architecture wholly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We know where things and men must end at best:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A moral (like all morals) melancholy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And 'Et sepulchri immemor struis domos'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shows that we build when we should but entomb us.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At last they reach'd a quarter most retired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where echo woke as if from a long slumber;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though full of all things which could be desired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One wonder'd what to do with such a number<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of articles which nobody required;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here wealth had done its utmost to encumber<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With furniture an exquisite apartment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which puzzled Nature much to know what Art meant.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seem'd, however, but to open on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A range or suite of further chambers, which<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Might lead to heaven knows where; but in this one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The movables were prodigally rich:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sofas 't was half a sin to sit upon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So costly were they; carpets every stitch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of workmanship so rare, they made you wish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You could glide o'er them like a golden fish.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The black, however, without hardly deigning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A glance at that which wrapt the slaves in wonder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Trampled what they scarce trod for fear of staining,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if the milky way their feet was under<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With all its stars; and with a stretch attaining<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A certain press or cupboard niched in yonder--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In that remote recess which you may see--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or if you don't the fault is not in me,--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish to be perspicuous; and the black,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say, unlocking the recess, pull'd forth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A quantity of clothes fit for the back<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of any Mussulman, whate'er his worth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And of variety there was no lack--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, though I have said there was no dearth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He chose himself to point out what he thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most proper for the Christians he had bought.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The suit he thought most suitable to each<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was, for the elder and the stouter, first<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A Candiote cloak, which to the knee might reach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And trousers not so tight that they would burst,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But such as fit an Asiatic breech;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A shawl, whose folds in Cashmire had been nurst,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Slippers of saffron, dagger rich and handy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In short, all things which form a Turkish Dandy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While he was dressing, Baba, their black friend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hinted the vast advantages which they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Might probably attain both in the end,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If they would but pursue the proper way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which fortune plainly seem'd to recommend;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then he added, that he needs must say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ''T would greatly tend to better their condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If they would condescend to circumcision.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'For his own part, he really should rejoice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To see them true believers, but no less<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would leave his proposition to their choice.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The other, thanking him for this excess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of goodness, in thus leaving them a voice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In such a trifle, scarcely could express<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'sufficiently' (he said) 'his approbation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the customs of this polish'd nation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'For his own share--he saw but small objection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To so respectable an ancient rite;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, after swallowing down a slight refection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which he own'd a present appetite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He doubted not a few hours of reflection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would reconcile him to the business quite.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Will it?' said Juan, sharply:'strike me dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But they as soon shall circumcise my head!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Cut off a thousand heads, before-'--'Now, pray,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Replied the other, 'do not interrupt:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You put me out in what I had to say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir!--as I said, as soon as I have supt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I shall perpend if your proposal may<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be such as I can properly accept;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Provided always your great goodness still<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Remits the matter to our own free-will.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Baba eyed Juan, and said, 'Be so good<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As dress yourself-' and pointed out a suit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In which a Princess with great pleasure would<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Array her limbs; but Juan standing mute,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As not being in a masquerading mood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gave it a slight kick with his Christian foot;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when the old negro told him to 'Get ready,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Replied, 'Old gentleman, I 'm not a lady.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'What you may be, I neither know nor care,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said Baba; 'but pray do as I desire:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have no more time nor many words to spare.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'At least,' said Juan,'sure I may enquire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The cause of this odd travesty?'--'Forbear,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said Baba, 'to be curious; 't will transpire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt, in proper place, and time, and season:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have no authority to tell the reason.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Then if I do,' said Juan, 'I 'll be-'--'Hold!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rejoin'd the negro, 'pray be not provoking;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This spirit's well, but it may wax too bold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you will find us not top fond of joking.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'What, sir!' said Juan,'shall it e'er be told<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That I unsex'd my dress?' But Baba, stroking<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The things down, said, 'Incense me, and I call<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those who will leave you of no sex at all.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I offer you a handsome suit of clothes:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A woman's, true; but then there is a cause<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why you should wear them.'--'What, though my soul loathes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The effeminate garb?'--thus, after a short pause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sigh'd Juan, muttering also some slight oaths,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'What the devil shall I do with all this gauze?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus he profanely term'd the finest lace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which e'er set off a marriage-morning face.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then he swore; and, sighing, on he slipp'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pair of trousers of flesh-colour'd silk;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next with a virgin zone he was equipp'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which girt a slight chemise as white as milk;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But tugging on his petticoat, he tripp'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which--as we say--or, as the Scotch say, whilk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (The rhyme obliges me to this; sometimes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Monarchs are less imperative than rhymes)--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whilk, which (or what you please), was owing to<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His garment's novelty, and his being awkward:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet at last he managed to get through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His toilet, though no doubt a little backward:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The negro Baba help'd a little too,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When some untoward part of raiment stuck hard;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, wrestling both his arms into a gown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He paused, and took a survey up and down.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One difficulty still remain'd--his hair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was hardly long enough; but Baba found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So many false long tresses all to spare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That soon his head was most completely crown'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the manner then in fashion there;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And this addition with such gems was bound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As suited the ensemble of his toilet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While Baba made him comb his head and oil it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now being femininely all array'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With some small aid from scissors, paint, and tweezers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He look'd in almost all respects a maid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Baba smilingly exclaim'd, 'You see, sirs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A perfect transformation here display'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now, then, you must come along with me, sirs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is--the Lady:' clapping his hands twice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Four blacks were at his elbow in a trice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'You, sir,' said Baba, nodding to the one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Will please to accompany those gentlemen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To supper; but you, worthy Christian nun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will follow me: no trifling, sir; for when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I say a thing, it must at once be done.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What fear you? think you this a lion's den?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why, 't is a palace; where the truly wise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Anticipate the Prophet's paradise.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'You fool! I tell you no one means you harm.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'so much the better,' Juan said, 'for them;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Else they shall feel the weight of this my arm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is not quite so light as you may deem.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I yield thus far; but soon will break the charm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If any take me for that which I seem:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that I trust for everybody's sake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That this disguise may lead to no mistake.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Blockhead! come on, and see,' quoth Baba; while<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan, turning to his comrade, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though somewhat grieved, could scarce forbear a smile<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the metamorphosis in view,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Farewell!' they mutually exclaim'd: 'this soil<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seems fertile in adventures strange and new;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One's turn'd half Mussulman, and one a maid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By this old black enchanter's unsought aid.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Farewell!' said Juan:'should we meet no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wish you a good appetite.'--'Farewell!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Replied the other; 'though it grieves me sore;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When we next meet we 'll have a tale to tell:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We needs must follow when Fate puts from shore.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Keep your good name; though Eve herself once fell.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Nay,' quoth the maid, 'the Sultan's self shan't carry me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless his highness promises to marry me.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus they parted, each by separate doors;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Baba led Juan onward room by room<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through glittering galleries and o'er marble floors,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Till a gigantic portal through the gloom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Haughty and huge, along the distance lowers;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wafted far arose a rich perfume:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seem'd as though they came upon a shrine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For all was vast, still, fragrant, and divine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The giant door was broad, and bright, and high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of gilded bronze, and carved in curious guise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Warriors thereon were battling furiously;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here stalks the victor, there the vanquish'd lies;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There captives led in triumph droop the eye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in perspective many a squadron flies:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seems the work of times before the line<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Rome transplanted fell with Constantine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This massy portal stood at the wide close<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of a huge hall, and on its either side<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two little dwarfs, the least you could suppose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were sate, like ugly imps, as if allied<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In mockery to the enormous gate which rose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'er them in almost pyramidic pride:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The gate so splendid was in all its features,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You never thought about those little creatures,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until you nearly trod on them, and then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You started back in horror to survey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wondrous hideousness of those small men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose colour was not black, nor white, nor grey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But an extraneous mixture, which no pen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can trace, although perhaps the pencil may;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They were mis-shapen pigmies, deaf and dumb--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Monsters, who cost a no less monstrous sum.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their duty was--for they were strong, and though<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They look'd so little, did strong things at times--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To ope this door, which they could really do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hinges being as smooth as Rogers' rhymes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now and then, with tough strings of the bow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As is the custom of those Eastern climes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To give some rebel Pacha a cravat;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For mutes are generally used for that.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They spoke by signs--that is, not spoke at all;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And looking like two incubi, they glared<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As Baba with his fingers made them fall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To heaving back the portal folds: it scared<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan a moment, as this pair so small<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With shrinking serpent optics on him stared;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was as if their little looks could poison<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or fascinate whome'er they fix'd their eyes on.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before they enter'd, Baba paused to hint<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Juan some slight lessons as his guide:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'If you could just contrive,' he said, 'to stint<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That somewhat manly majesty of stride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T would be as well, and (though there's not much in 't)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To swing a little less from side to side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which has at times an aspect of the oddest;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And also could you look a little modest,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ''T would be convenient; for these mutes have eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like needles, which may pierce those petticoats;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if they should discover your disguise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know how near us the deep Bosphorus floats;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And you and I may chance, ere morning rise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To find our way to Marmora without boats,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stitch'd up in sacks--a mode of navigation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A good deal practised here upon occasion.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With this encouragement, he led the way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into a room still nobler than the last;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A rich confusion form'd a disarray<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In such sort, that the eye along it cast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could hardly carry anything away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Object on object flash'd so bright and fast;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A dazzling mass of gems, and gold, and glitter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Magnificently mingled in a litter.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wealth had done wonders--taste not much; such things<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Occur in Orient palaces, and even<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the more chasten'd domes of Western kings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Of which I have also seen some six or seven),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where I can't say or gold or diamond flings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Great lustre, there is much to be forgiven;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Groups of bad statues, tables, chairs, and pictures,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On which I cannot pause to make my strictures.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this imperial hall, at distance lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under a canopy, and there reclined<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quite in a confidential queenly way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lady; Baba stopp'd, and kneeling sign'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To Juan, who though not much used to pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Knelt down by instinct, wondering in his mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What all this meant: while Baba bow'd and bended<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His head, until the ceremony ended.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lady rising up with such an air<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Venus rose with from the wave, on them<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bent like an antelope a Paphian pair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of eyes, which put out each surrounding gem;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And raising up an arm as moonlight fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She sign'd to Baba, who first kiss'd the hem<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of her deep purple robe, and speaking low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pointed to Juan who remain'd below.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her presence was as lofty as her state;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her beauty of that overpowering kind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose force description only would abate:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'd rather leave it much to your own mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than lessen it by what I could relate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of forms and features; it would strike you blind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could I do justice to the full detail;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So, luckily for both, my phrases fail.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus much however I may add,--her years<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were ripe, they might make six-and-twenty springs;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But there are forms which Time to touch forbears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And turns aside his scythe to vulgar things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such as was Mary's Queen of Scots; true--tears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And love destroy; and sapping sorrow wrings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Charms from the charmer, yet some never grow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ugly; for instance--Ninon de l'Enclos.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She spake some words to her attendants, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Composed a choir of girls, ten or a dozen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And were all clad alike; like Juan, too,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who wore their uniform, by Baba chosen;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They form'd a very nymph-like looking crew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which might have call'd Diana's chorus 'cousin,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As far as outward show may correspond;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I won't be bail for anything beyond.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They bow'd obeisance and withdrew, retiring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But not by the same door through which came in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Baba and Juan, which last stood admiring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At some small distance, all he saw within<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This strange saloon, much fitted for inspiring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Marvel and praise; for both or none things win;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I must say, I ne'er could see the very<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Great happiness of the 'Nil Admirari.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Not to admire is all the art I know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Plain truth, dear Murray, needs few flowers of speech)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To make men happy, or to keep them so'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (So take it in the very words of Creech)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus Horace wrote we all know long ago;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus Pope quotes the precept to re-teach<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From his translation; but had none admired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would Pope have sung, or Horace been inspired?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Baba, when all the damsels were withdrawn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Motion'd to Juan to approach, and then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A second time desired him to kneel down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And kiss the lady's foot; which maxim when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He heard repeated, Juan with a frown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Drew himself up to his full height again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And said, 'It grieved him, but he could not stoop<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To any shoe, unless it shod the Pope.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Baba, indignant at this ill-timed pride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made fierce remonstrances, and then a threat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He mutter'd (but the last was given aside)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About a bow-string--quite in vain; not yet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would Juan bend, though 't were to Mahomet's bride:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's nothing in the world like etiquette<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In kingly chambers or imperial halls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As also at the race and county balls.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He stood like Atlas, with a world of words<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About his ears, and nathless would not bend:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The blood of all his line's Castilian lords<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Boil'd in his veins, and rather than descend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To stain his pedigree a thousand swords<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thousand times of him had made an end;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At length perceiving the 'foot' could not stand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Baba proposed that he should kiss the hand.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here was an honourable compromise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A half-way house of diplomatic rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where they might meet in much more peaceful guise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan now his willingness exprest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To use all fit and proper courtesies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Adding, that this was commonest and best,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For through the South the custom still commands<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The gentleman to kiss the lady's hands.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And he advanced, though with but a bad grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though on more thorough-bred or fairer fingers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No lips e'er left their transitory trace;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On such as these the lip too fondly lingers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And for one kiss would fain imprint a brace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you will see, if she you love shall bring hers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In contact; and sometimes even a fair stranger's<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An almost twelvemonth's constancy endangers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lady eyed him o'er and o'er, and bade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Baba retire, which he obey'd in style,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if well used to the retreating trade;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And taking hints in good part all the while,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He whisper'd Juan not to be afraid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And looking on him with a sort of smile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Took leave, with such a face of satisfaction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As good men wear who have done a virtuous action.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When he was gone, there was a sudden change:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know not what might be the lady's thought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But o'er her bright brow flash'd a tumult strange,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And into her dear cheek the blood was brought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Blood-red as sunset summer clouds which range<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The verge of Heaven; and in her large eyes wrought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A mixture of sensations might be scann'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of half voluptuousness and half command.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her form had all the softness of her sex,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her features all the sweetness of the devil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When he put on the cherub to perplex<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eve, and paved (God knows how) the road to evil;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sun himself was scarce more free from specks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than she from aught at which the eye could cavil;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet, somehow, there was something somewhere wanting,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if she rather order'd than was granting.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Something imperial, or imperious, threw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A chain o'er all she did; that is, a chain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was thrown as 't were about the neck of you,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And rapture's self will seem almost a pain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With aught which looks like despotism in view:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our souls at least are free, and 't is in vain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We would against them make the flesh obey--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The spirit in the end will have its way.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her very smile was haughty, though so sweet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her very nod was not an inclination;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a self-will even in her small feet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As though they were quite conscious of her station--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They trod as upon necks; and to complete<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her state (it is the custom of her nation),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A poniard deck'd her girdle, as the sign<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was a sultan's bride (thank Heaven, not mine!).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'To hear and to obey' had been from birth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The law of all around her; to fulfill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All phantasies which yielded joy or mirth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had been her slaves' chief pleasure, as her will;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her blood was high, her beauty scarce of earth:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Judge, then, if her caprices e'er stood still;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had she but been a Christian, I 've a notion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We should have found out the 'perpetual motion.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er she saw and coveted was brought;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er she did not see, if she supposed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It might be seen, with diligence was sought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when 't was found straightway the bargain closed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was no end unto the things she bought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor to the trouble which her fancies caused;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet even her tyranny had such a grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The women pardon'd all except her face.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, the latest of her whims, had caught<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her eye in passing on his way to sale;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She order'd him directly to be bought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Baba, who had ne'er been known to fail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In any kind of mischief to be wrought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At all such auctions knew how to prevail:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had no prudence, but he had; and this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Explains the garb which Juan took amiss.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His youth and features favour'd the disguise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, should you ask how she, a sultan's bride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could risk or compass such strange phantasies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This I must leave sultanas to decide:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Emperors are only husbands in wives' eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And kings and consorts oft are mystified,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As we may ascertain with due precision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some by experience, others by tradition.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to the main point, where we have been tending:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She now conceived all difficulties past,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And deem'd herself extremely condescending<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When, being made her property at last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without more preface, in her blue eyes blending<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Passion and power, a glance on him she cast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And merely saying, 'Christian, canst thou love?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Conceived that phrase was quite enough to move<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so it was, in proper time and place;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan, who had still his mind o'erflowing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Haidee's isle and soft Ionian face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Felt the warm blood, which in his face was glowing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rush back upon his heart, which fill'd apace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And left his cheeks as pale as snowdrops blowing;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These words went through his soul like Arab-spears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that he spoke not, but burst into tears.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was a good deal shock'd; not shock'd at tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For women shed and use them at their liking;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But there is something when man's eye appears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wet, still more disagreeable and striking;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A woman's tear-drop melts, a man's half sears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like molten lead, as if you thrust a pike in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His heart to force it out, for (to be shorter)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To them 't is a relief, to us a torture.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And she would have consoled, but knew not how:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Having no equals, nothing which had e'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Infected her with sympathy till now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And never having dreamt what 't was to bear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aught of a serious, sorrowing kind, although<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There might arise some pouting petty care<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To cross her brow, she wonder'd how so near<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her eyes another's eye could shed a tear.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But nature teaches more than power can spoil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, when a strong although a strange sensation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Moves--female hearts are such a genial soil<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For kinder feelings, whatsoe'er their nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They naturally pour the 'wine and oil,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Samaritans in every situation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus Gulbeyaz, though she knew not why,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Felt an odd glistening moisture in her eye.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But tears must stop like all things else; and soon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, who for an instant had been moved<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To such a sorrow by the intrusive tone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of one who dared to ask if 'he had loved,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Call'd back the stoic to his eyes, which shone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bright with the very weakness he reproved;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And although sensitive to beauty, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Felt most indignant still at not being free.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gulbeyaz, for the first time in her days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was much embarrass'd, never having met<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In all her life with aught save prayers and praise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as she also risk'd her life to get<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Him whom she meant to tutor in love's ways<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into a comfortable tete-a-tete,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To lose the hour would make her quite a martyr,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And they had wasted now almost a quarter.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I also would suggest the fitting time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To gentlemen in any such like case,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is to say in a meridian clime--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With us there is more law given to the chase,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here a small delay forms a great crime:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So recollect that the extremest grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is just two minutes for your declaration--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A moment more would hurt your reputation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan's was good; and might have been still better,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he had got Haidee into his head:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However strange, he could not yet forget her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which made him seem exceedingly ill-bred.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gulbeyaz, who look'd on him as her debtor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For having had him to her palace led,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Began to blush up to the eyes, and then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Grow deadly pale, and then blush back again.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At length, in an imperial way, she laid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her hand on his, and bending on him eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which needed not an empire to persuade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look'd into his for love, where none replies:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her brow grew black, but she would not upbraid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That being the last thing a proud woman tries;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She rose, and pausing one chaste moment, threw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Herself upon his breast, and there she grew.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This was an awkward test, as Juan found,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he was steel'd by sorrow, wrath, and pride:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With gentle force her white arms he unwound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And seated her all drooping by his side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then rising haughtily he glanced around,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And looking coldly in her face, he cried,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'The prison'd eagle will not pair, nor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Serve a Sultana's sensual phantasy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Thou ask'st if I can love? be this the proof<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How much I have loved--that I love not thee!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this vile garb, the distaff, web, and woof,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were fitter for me: Love is for the free!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not dazzled by this splendid roof,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er thy power, and great it seems to be;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Heads bow, knees bend, eyes watch around a throne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hands obey--our hearts are still our own.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This was a truth to us extremely trite;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not so to her, who ne'er had heard such things:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She deem'd her least command must yield delight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Earth being only made for queens and kings.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If hearts lay on the left side or the right<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She hardly knew, to such perfection brings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Legitimacy its born votaries, when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aware of their due royal rights o'er men.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, as has been said, she was so fair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As even in a much humbler lot had made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A kingdom or confusion anywhere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also, as may be presumed, she laid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some stress on charms, which seldom are, if e'er,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By their possessors thrown into the shade:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She thought hers gave a double 'right divine;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And half of that opinion's also mine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Remember, or (if you can not) imagine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ye, who have kept your chastity when young,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While some more desperate dowager has been waging<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love with you, and been in the dog-days stung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By your refusal, recollect her raging!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or recollect all that was said or sung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On such a subject; then suppose the face<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of a young downright beauty in this case.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suppose,--but you already have supposed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The spouse of Potiphar, the Lady Booby,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Phaedra, and all which story has disclosed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of good examples; pity that so few by<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Poets and private tutors are exposed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To educate--ye youth of Europe--you by!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But when you have supposed the few we know,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You can't suppose Gulbeyaz' angry brow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A tigress robb'd of young, a lioness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or any interesting beast of prey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are similes at hand for the distress<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of ladies who can not have their own way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But though my turn will not be served with less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These don't express one half what I should say:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For what is stealing young ones, few or many,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To cutting short their hopes of having any?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The love of offspring's nature's general law,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From tigresses and cubs to ducks and ducklings;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's nothing whets the beak, or arms the claw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like an invasion of their babes and sucklings;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all who have seen a human nursery, saw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How mothers love their children's squalls and chucklings;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This strong extreme effect (to tire no longer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your patience) shows the cause must still be stronger.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If I said fire flash'd from Gulbeyaz' eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T were nothing--for her eyes flash'd always fire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or said her cheeks assumed the deepest dyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I should but bring disgrace upon the dyer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So supernatural was her passion's rise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ne'er till now she knew a check'd desire:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even ye who know what a check'd woman is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Enough, God knows!) would much fall short of this.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her rage was but a minute's, and 't was well--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A moment's more had slain her; but the while<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It lasted 't was like a short glimpse of hell:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nought's more sublime than energetic bile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though horrible to see yet grand to tell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like ocean warring 'gainst a rocky isle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the deep passions flashing through her form<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Made her a beautiful embodied storm.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A vulgar tempest 't were to a typhoon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To match a common fury with her rage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet she did not want to reach the moon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like moderate Hotspur on the immortal page;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her anger pitch'd into a lower tune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the fault of her soft sex and age--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her wish was but to 'kill, kill, kill,' like Lear's,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then her thirst of blood was quench'd in tears.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A storm it raged, and like the storm it pass'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pass'd without words--in fact she could not speak;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then her sex's shame broke in at last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sentiment till then in her but weak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now it flow'd in natural and fast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As water through an unexpected leak;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For she felt humbled--and humiliation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is sometimes good for people in her station<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It teaches them that they are flesh and blood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It also gently hints to them that others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although of clay, are yet not quite of mud;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That urns and pipkins are but fragile brothers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And works of the same pottery, bad or good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though not all born of the same sires and mothers:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It teaches--Heaven knows only what it teaches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But sometimes it may mend, and often reaches.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her first thought was to cut off Juan's head;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her second, to cut only his--acquaintance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her third, to ask him where he had been bred;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her fourth, to rally him into repentance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her fifth, to call her maids and go to bed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her sixth, to stab herself; her seventh, to sentence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lash to Baba:--but her grand resource<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was to sit down again, and cry of course.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She thought to stab herself, but then she had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dagger close at hand, which made it awkward;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Eastern stays are little made to pad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that a poniard pierces if 't is stuck hard:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She thought of killing Juan--but, poor lad!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though he deserved it well for being so backward,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The cutting off his head was not the art<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most likely to attain her aim--his heart.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan was moved; he had made up his mind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be impaled, or quarter'd as a dish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For dogs, or to be slain with pangs refined,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or thrown to lions, or made baits for fish,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus heroically stood resign'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rather than sin--except to his own wish:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But all his great preparatives for dying<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dissolved like snow before a woman crying.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As through his palms Bob Acres' valour oozed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So Juan's virtue ebb'd, I know not how;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And first he wonder'd why he had refused;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then, if matters could be made up now;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And next his savage virtue he accused,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as a friar may accuse his vow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or as a dame repents her of her oath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which mostly ends in some small breach of both.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So he began to stammer some excuses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But words are not enough in such a matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although you borrow'd all that e'er the muses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have sung, or even a Dandy's dandiest chatter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or all the figures Castlereagh abuses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as a languid smile began to flatter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His peace was making, but before he ventured<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Further, old Baba rather briskly enter'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Bride of the Sun! and Sister of the Moon!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ('T was thus he spake) 'and Empress of the Earth!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose frown would put the spheres all out of tune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose smile makes all the planets dance with mirth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your slave brings tidings--he hopes not too soon--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which your sublime attention may be worth:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Sun himself has sent me like a ray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To hint that he is coming up this way.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Is it,' exclaim'd Gulbeyaz, 'as you say?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wish to heaven he would not shine till morning!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But bid my women form the milky way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hence, my old comet! give the stars due warning--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, Christian! mingle with them as you may,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as you 'd have me pardon your past scorning-'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here they were interrupted by a humming<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sound, and then by a cry, 'The Sultan's coming!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; First came her damsels, a decorous file,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then his Highness' eunuchs, black and white;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The train might reach a quarter of a mile:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His majesty was always so polite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As to announce his visits a long while<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before he came, especially at night;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For being the last wife of the Emperour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was of course the favorite of the four.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His Highness was a man of solemn port,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shawl'd to the nose, and bearded to the eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Snatch'd from a prison to preside at court,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His lately bowstrung brother caused his rise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was as good a sovereign of the sort<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any mention'd in the histories<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Cantemir, or Knolles, where few shine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save Solyman, the glory of their line.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He went to mosque in state, and said his prayers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With more than 'Oriental scrupulosity;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He left to his vizier all state affairs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And show'd but little royal curiosity:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I know not if he had domestic cares--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No process proved connubial animosity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Four wives and twice five hundred maids, unseen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were ruled as calmly as a Christian queen.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If now and then there happen'd a slight slip,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Little was heard of criminal or crime;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The story scarcely pass'd a single lip--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sack and sea had settled all in time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From which the secret nobody could rip:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Public knew no more than does this rhyme;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No scandals made the daily press a curse--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Morals were better, and the fish no worse.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He saw with his own eyes the moon was round,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was also certain that the earth was square,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because he had journey'd fifty miles, and found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No sign that it was circular anywhere;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His empire also was without a bound:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is true, a little troubled here and there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By rebel pachas, and encroaching giaours,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then they never came to 'the Seven Towers;'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Except in shape of envoys, who were sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lodge there when a war broke out, according<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the true law of nations, which ne'er meant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those scoundrels, who have never had a sword in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their dirty diplomatic hands, to vent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their spleen in making strife, and safely wording<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their lies, yclep'd despatches, without risk or<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The singeing of a single inky whisker.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had fifty daughters and four dozen sons,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of whom all such as came of age were stow'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The former in a palace, where like nuns<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They lived till some Bashaw was sent abroad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When she, whose turn it was, was wed at once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes at six years old--though it seems odd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is true; the reason is, that the Bashaw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must make a present to his sire in law.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His sons were kept in prison, till they grew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of years to fill a bowstring or the throne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One or the other, but which of the two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could yet be known unto the fates alone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime the education they went through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was princely, as the proofs have always shown:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that the heir apparent still was found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No less deserving to be hang'd than crown'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His majesty saluted his fourth spouse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all the ceremonies of his rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who clear'd her sparkling eyes and smooth'd her brows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As suits a matron who has play'd a prank;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These must seem doubly mindful of their vows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To save the credit of their breaking bank:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To no men are such cordial greetings given<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As those whose wives have made them fit for heaven.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His Highness cast around his great black eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And looking, as he always look'd, perceived<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan amongst the damsels in disguise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At which he seem'd no whit surprised nor grieved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But just remark'd with air sedate and wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While still a fluttering sigh Gulbeyaz heaved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I see you 've bought another girl; 't is pity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That a mere Christian should be half so pretty.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This compliment, which drew all eyes upon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The new-bought virgin, made her blush and shake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her comrades, also, thought themselves undone:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh! Mahomet! that his majesty should take<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such notice of a giaour, while scarce to one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of them his lips imperial ever spake!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a general whisper, toss, and wriggle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But etiquette forbade them all to giggle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Turks do well to shut--at least, sometimes--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The women up, because, in sad reality,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their chastity in these unhappy climes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is not a thing of that astringent quality<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which in the North prevents precocious crimes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And makes our snow less pure than our morality;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sun, which yearly melts the polar ice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Has quite the contrary effect on vice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus in the East they are extremely strict,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Wedlock and a Padlock mean the same;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Excepting only when the former's pick'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It ne'er can be replaced in proper frame;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Spoilt, as a pipe of claret is when prick'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But then their own Polygamy's to blame;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why don't they knead two virtuous souls for life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into that moral centaur, man and wife?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus far our chronicle; and now we pause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though not for want of matter; but 't is time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to the ancient epic laws,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To slacken sail, and anchor with our rhyme.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let this fifth canto meet with due applause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sixth shall have a touch of the sublime;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, as Homer sometimes sleeps, perhaps<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 'll pardon to my muse a few short naps.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="avi">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;             CANTO THE SIXTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'THERE is a tide in the affairs of men<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which,--taken at the flood,'--you know the rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And most of us have found it now and then;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least we think so, though but few have guess'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The moment, till too late to come again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But no doubt every thing is for the best--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of which the surest sign is in the end:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When things are at the worst they sometimes mend.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a tide in the affairs of women<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which, taken at the flood, leads--God knows where:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those navigators must be able seamen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose charts lay down its current to a hair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not all the reveries of Jacob Behmen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With its strange whirls and eddies can compare:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men with their heads reflect on this and that--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But women with their hearts on heaven knows what!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet a headlong, headstrong, downright she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Young, beautiful, and daring--who would risk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A throne, the world, the universe, to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beloved in her own way, and rather whisk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The stars from out the sky, than not be free<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As are the billows when the breeze is brisk--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though such a she's a devil (if that there be one),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet she would make full many a Manichean.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thrones, worlds, et cetera, are so oft upset<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By commonest ambition, that when passion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'erthrows the same, we readily forget,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or at the least forgive, the loving rash one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If Antony be well remember'd yet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is not his conquests keep his name in fashion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Actium, lost for Cleopatra's eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Outbalances all Caesar's victories.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He died at fifty for a queen of forty;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wish their years had been fifteen and twenty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For then wealth, kingdoms, worlds are but a sport--I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember when, though I had no great plenty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of worlds to lose, yet still, to pay my court, I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gave what I had--a heart: as the world went, I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gave what was worth a world; for worlds could never<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Restore me those pure feelings, gone forever.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was the boy's 'mite,' and, like the 'widow's,' may<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps be weigh'd hereafter, if not now;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But whether such things do or do not weigh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All who have loved, or love, will still allow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Life has nought like it. God is love, they say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Love's a god, or was before the brow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of earth was wrinkled by the sins and tears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of--but Chronology best knows the years.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We left our hero and third heroine in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A kind of state more awkward than uncommon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For gentlemen must sometimes risk their skin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that sad tempter, a forbidden woman:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sultans too much abhor this sort of sin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And don't agree at all with the wise Roman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Heroic, stoic Cato, the sententious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who lent his lady to his friend Hortensius.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I know Gulbeyaz was extremely wrong;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I own it, I deplore it, I condemn it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I detest all fiction even in song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so must tell the truth, howe'er you blame it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her reason being weak, her passions strong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She thought that her lord's heart (even could she claim it)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was scarce enough; for he had fifty-nine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Years, and a fifteen-hundredth concubine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not, like Cassio, 'an arithmetician,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But by 'the bookish theoric' it appears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If 't is summ'd up with feminine precision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That, adding to the account his Highness' years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fair Sultana err'd from inanition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For, were the Sultan just to all his dears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She could but claim the fifteen-hundredth part<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of what should be monopoly--the heart.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is observed that ladies are litigious<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon all legal objects of possession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And not the least so when they are religious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which doubles what they think of the transgression:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With suits and prosecutions they besiege us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the tribunals show through many a session,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When they suspect that any one goes shares<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In that to which the law makes them sole heirs.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, if this holds good in a Christian land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The heathen also, though with lesser latitude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are apt to carry things with a high hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And take what kings call 'an imposing attitude,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And for their rights connubial make a stand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When their liege husbands treat them with ingratitude:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as four wives must have quadruple claims,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Tigris hath its jealousies like Thames.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gulbeyaz was the fourth, and (as I said)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The favourite; but what's favour amongst four?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Polygamy may well be held in dread,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only as a sin, but as a bore:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most wise men, with one moderate woman wed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will scarcely find philosophy for more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all (except Mahometans) forbear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To make the nuptial couch a 'Bed of Ware.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His Highness, the sublimest of mankind,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So styled according to the usual forms<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of every monarch, till they are consign'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To those sad hungry jacobins the worms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who on the very loftiest kings have dined,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His Highness gazed upon Gulbeyaz' charms,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Expecting all the welcome of a lover<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (A 'Highland welcome' all the wide world over).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now here we should distinguish; for howe'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kisses, sweet words, embraces, and all that,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May look like what is--neither here nor there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are put on as easily as a hat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or rather bonnet, which the fair sex wear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trimm'd either heads or hearts to decorate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which form an ornament, but no more part<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of heads, than their caresses of the heart.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A slight blush, a soft tremor, a calm kind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of gentle feminine delight, and shown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More in the eyelids than the eyes, resign'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rather to hide what pleases most unknown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are the best tokens (to a modest mind)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of love, when seated on his loveliest throne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sincere woman's breast,--for over-warm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or over-cold annihilates the charm.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For over-warmth, if false, is worse than truth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If true, 't is no great lease of its own fire;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For no one, save in very early youth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would like (I think) to trust all to desire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which is but a precarious bond, in sooth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And apt to be transferr'd to the first buyer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At a sad discount: while your over chilly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Women, on t' other hand, seem somewhat silly.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is, we cannot pardon their bad taste,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For so it seems to lovers swift or slow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who fain would have a mutual flame confess'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And see a sentimental passion glow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even were St. Francis' paramour their guest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In his monastic concubine of snow;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In short, the maxim for the amorous tribe is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Horatian, 'Medio tu tutissimus ibis.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The 'tu''s too much,--but let it stand,--the verse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Requires it, that's to say, the English rhyme,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And not the pink of old hexameters;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, after all, there's neither tune nor time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the last line, which cannot well be worse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And was thrust in to close the octave's chime:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I own no prosody can ever rate it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a rule, but truth may, if you translate it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If fair Gulbeyaz overdid her part,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know not--it succeeded, and success<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is much in most things, not less in the heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than other articles of female dress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Self-love in man, too, beats all female art;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They lie, we lie, all lie, but love no less;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And no one virtue yet, except starvation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could stop that worst of vices--propagation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We leave this royal couple to repose:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A bed is not a throne, and they may sleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er their dreams be, if of joys or woes:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet disappointed joys are woes as deep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As any man's day mixture undergoes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our least of sorrows are such as we weep;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is the vile daily drop on drop which wears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The soul out (like the stone) with petty cares.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A scolding wife, a sullen son, a bill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To pay, unpaid, protested, or discounted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At a per-centage; a child cross, dog ill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A favourite horse fallen lame just as he's mounted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A bad old woman making a worse will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which leaves you minus of the cash you counted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As certain;--these are paltry things, and yet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've rarely seen the man they did not fret.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm a philosopher; confound them all!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bills, beasts, and men, and--no! not womankind!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With one good hearty curse I vent my gall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then my stoicism leaves nought behind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which it can either pain or evil call,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I can give my whole soul up to mind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though what is soul or mind, their birth or growth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is more than I know--the deuce take them both!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As after reading Athanasius' curse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which doth your true believer so much please:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I doubt if any now could make it worse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'er his worst enemy when at his knees,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is so sententious, positive, and terse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And decorates the book of Common Prayer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As doth a rainbow the just clearing air.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gulbeyaz and her lord were sleeping, or<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least one of them!--Oh, the heavy night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When wicked wives, who love some bachelor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lie down in dudgeon to sigh for the light<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the gray morning, and look vainly for<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its twinkle through the lattice dusky quite--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To toss, to tumble, doze, revive, and quake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lest their too lawful bed-fellow should wake!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These are beneath the canopy of heaven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also beneath the canopy of beds<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Four-posted and silk curtain'd, which are given<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For rich men and their brides to lay their heads<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon, in sheets white as what bards call 'driven<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Snow.' Well! 't is all hap-hazard when one weds.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gulbeyaz was an empress, but had been<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps as wretched if a peasant's quean.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan in his feminine disguise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all the damsels in their long array,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had bow'd themselves before th' imperial eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And at the usual signal ta'en their way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Back to their chambers, those long galleries<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the seraglio, where the ladies lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their delicate limbs; a thousand bosoms there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beating for love, as the caged bird's for air.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I love the sex, and sometimes would reverse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tyrant's wish, 'that mankind only had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One neck, which he with one fell stroke might pierce:'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My wish is quite as wide, but not so bad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And much more tender on the whole than fierce;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It being (not now, but only while a lad)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That womankind had but one rosy mouth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To kiss them all at once from North to South.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, enviable Briareus! with thy hands<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And heads, if thou hadst all things multiplied<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In such proportion!--But my Muse withstands<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The giant thought of being a Titan's bride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or travelling in Patagonian lands;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So let us back to Lilliput, and guide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our hero through the labyrinth of love<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In which we left him several lines above.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He went forth with the lovely Odalisques,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the given signal join'd to their array;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And though he certainly ran many risks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet he could not at times keep, by the way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Although the consequences of such frisks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are worse than the worst damages men pay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In moral England, where the thing's a tax),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From ogling all their charms from breasts to backs.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still he forgot not his disguise:--along<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The galleries from room to room they walk'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A virgin-like and edifying throng,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By eunuchs flank'd; while at their head there stalk'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A dame who kept up discipline among<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The female ranks, so that none stirr'd or talk'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without her sanction on their she-parades:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her title was 'the Mother of the Maids.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether she was a 'mother,' I know not,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or whether they were 'maids' who call'd her mother;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this is her seraglio title, got<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know not how, but good as any other;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So Cantemir can tell you, or De Tott:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her office was to keep aloof or smother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All bad propensities in fifteen hundred<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young women, and correct them when they blunder'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A goodly sinecure, no doubt! but made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More easy by the absence of all men--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Except his majesty, who, with her aid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And guards, and bolts, and walls, and now and then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A slight example, just to cast a shade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Along the rest, contrived to keep this den<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of beauties cool as an Italian convent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where all the passions have, alas! but one vent.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And what is that? Devotion, doubtless--how<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could you ask such a question?--but we will<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Continue. As I said, this goodly row<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of ladies of all countries at the will<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of one good man, with stately march and slow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like water-lilies floating down a rill--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or rather lake, for rills do not run slowly--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Paced on most maiden-like and melancholy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But when they reach'd their own apartments, there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like birds, or boys, or bedlamites broke loose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Waves at spring-tide, or women anywhere<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When freed from bonds (which are of no great use<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After all), or like Irish at a fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their guards being gone, and as it were a truce<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Establish'd between them and bondage, they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Began to sing, dance, chatter, smile, and play.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their talk, of course, ran most on the new comer;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her shape, her hair, her air, her everything:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some thought her dress did not so much become her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or wonder'd at her ears without a ring;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some said her years were getting nigh their summer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Others contended they were but in spring;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some thought her rather masculine in height,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While others wish'd that she had been so quite.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But no one doubted on the whole, that she<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was what her dress bespoke, a damsel fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fresh, and 'beautiful exceedingly,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who with the brightest Georgians might compare:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They wonder'd how Gulbeyaz, too, could be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So silly as to buy slaves who might share<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (If that his Highness wearied of his bride)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her throne and power, and every thing beside.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what was strangest in this virgin crew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although her beauty was enough to vex,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the first investigating view,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They all found out as few, or fewer, specks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the fair form of their companion new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than is the custom of the gentle sex,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When they survey, with Christian eyes or Heathen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a new face 'the ugliest creature breathing.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet they had their little jealousies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like all the rest; but upon this occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether there are such things as sympathies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without our knowledge or our approbation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although they could not see through his disguise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All felt a soft kind of concatenation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like magnetism, or devilism, or what<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You please--we will not quarrel about that:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But certain 't is they all felt for their new<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Companion something newer still, as 't were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sentimental friendship through and through,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Extremely pure, which made them all concur<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In wishing her their sister, save a few<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who wish'd they had a brother just like her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whom, if they were at home in sweet Circassia,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They would prefer to Padisha or Pacha.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of those who had most genius for this sort<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of sentimental friendship, there were three,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lolah, Katinka, and Dudu; in short<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (To save description), fair as fair can be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were they, according to the best report,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though differing in stature and degree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And clime and time, and country and complexion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They all alike admired their new connection.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lolah was dusk as India and as warm;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Katinka was a Georgian, white and red,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With great blue eyes, a lovely hand and arm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And feet so small they scarce seem'd made to tread,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But rather skim the earth; while Dudu's form<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look'd more adapted to be put to bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Being somewhat large, and languishing, and lazy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet of a beauty that would drive you crazy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A kind of sleepy Venus seem'd Dudu,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet very fit to 'murder sleep' in those<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who gazed upon her cheek's transcendent hue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her Attic forehead, and her Phidian nose:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Few angles were there in her form, 't is true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thinner she might have been, and yet scarce lose;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet, after all, 't would puzzle to say where<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It would not spoil some separate charm to pare.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was not violently lively, but<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stole on your spirit like a May-day breaking;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her eyes were not too sparkling, yet, half-shut,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They put beholders in a tender taking;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She look'd (this simile's quite new) just cut<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From marble, like Pygmalion's statue waking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mortal and the marble still at strife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And timidly expanding into life.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lolah demanded the new damsel's name--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Juanna.'--Well, a pretty name enough.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Katinka ask'd her also whence she came--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'From Spain.'--'But where is Spain?'--'Don't ask such stuff,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor show your Georgian ignorance--for shame!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Said Lolah, with an accent rather rough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To poor Katinka:'spain's an island near<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Morocco, betwixt Egypt and Tangier.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dudu said nothing, but sat down beside<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juanna, playing with her veil or hair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And looking at her steadfastly, she sigh'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if she pitied her for being there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A pretty stranger without friend or guide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all abash'd, too, at the general stare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which welcomes hapless strangers in all places,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With kind remarks upon their mien and faces.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here the Mother of the Maids drew near,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With, 'Ladies, it is time to go to rest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm puzzled what to do with you, my dear,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She added to Juanna, their new guest:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Your coming has been unexpected here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every couch is occupied; you had best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Partake of mine; but by to-morrow early<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We will have all things settled for you fairly.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here Lolah interposed--'Mamma, you know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You don't sleep soundly, and I cannot bear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That anybody should disturb you so;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll take Juanna; we 're a slenderer pair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than you would make the half of;--don't say no;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I of your young charge will take due care.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here Katinka interfered, and said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'she also had compassion and a bed.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Besides, I hate to sleep alone,' quoth she.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The matron frown'd: 'Why so?'--'For fear of ghosts,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Replied Katinka; 'I am sure I see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A phantom upon each of the four posts;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then I have the worst dreams that can be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Guebres, Giaours, and Ginns, and Gouls in hosts.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The dame replied, 'Between your dreams and you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I fear Juanna's dreams would be but few.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'You, Lolah, must continue still to lie<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alone, for reasons which don't matter; you<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The same, Katinka, until by and by;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I shall place Juanna with Dudu,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who's quiet, inoffensive, silent, shy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And will not toss and chatter the night through.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What say you, child?'--Dudu said nothing, as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her talents were of the more silent class;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But she rose up, and kiss'd the matron's brow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between the eyes, and Lolah on both cheeks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Katinka, too; and with a gentle bow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Curt'sies are neither used by Turks nor Greeks)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She took Juanna by the hand to show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their place of rest, and left to both their piques,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The others pouting at the matron's preference<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Dudu, though they held their tongues from deference.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a spacious chamber (Oda is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Turkish title), and ranged round the wall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were couches, toilets--and much more than this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I might describe, as I have seen it all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But it suffices--little was amiss;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was on the whole a nobly furnish'd hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With all things ladies want, save one or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And even those were nearer than they knew.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dudu, as has been said, was a sweet creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not very dashing, but extremely winning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the most regulated charms of feature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which painters cannot catch like faces sinning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Against proportion--the wild strokes of nature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which they hit off at once in the beginning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Full of expression, right or wrong, that strike,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And pleasing or unpleasing, still are like.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But she was a soft landscape of mild earth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where all was harmony, and calm, and quiet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Luxuriant, budding; cheerful without mirth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which, if not happiness, is much more nigh it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than are your mighty passions and so forth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which some call 'the sublime:' I wish they 'd try it:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've seen your stormy seas and stormy women,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And pity lovers rather more than seamen.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But she was pensive more than melancholy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And serious more than pensive, and serene,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It may be, more than either--not unholy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her thoughts, at least till now, appear to have been.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The strangest thing was, beauteous, she was wholly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unconscious, albeit turn'd of quick seventeen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That she was fair, or dark, or short, or tall;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She never thought about herself at all.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore was she kind and gentle as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Age of Gold (when gold was yet unknown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By which its nomenclature came to pass;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus most appropriately has been shown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Lucus a non lucendo,' not what was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what was not; a sort of style that's grown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Extremely common in this age, whose metal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The devil may decompose, but never settle:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think it may be of 'Corinthian Brass,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which was a mixture of all metals, but<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The brazen uppermost). Kind reader! pass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This long parenthesis: I could not shut<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It sooner for the soul of me, and class<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My faults even with your own! which meaneth, Put<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A kind construction upon them and me:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But that you won't--then don't--I am not less free.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is time we should return to plain narration,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus my narrative proceeds:--Dudu,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With every kindness short of ostentation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Show'd Juan, or Juanna, through and through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This labyrinth of females, and each station<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Described--what's strange--in words extremely few:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have but one simile, and that's a blunder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For wordless woman, which is silent thunder.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And next she gave her (I say her, because<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gender still was epicene, at least<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In outward show, which is a saving clause)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An outline of the customs of the East,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With all their chaste integrity of laws,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By which the more a haram is increased,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The stricter doubtless grow the vestal duties<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of any supernumerary beauties.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then she gave Juanna a chaste kiss:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dudu was fond of kissing--which I 'm sure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That nobody can ever take amiss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because 't is pleasant, so that it be pure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And between females means no more than this--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That they have nothing better near, or newer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Kiss' rhymes to 'bliss' in fact as well as verse--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish it never led to something worse.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In perfect innocence she then unmade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her toilet, which cost little, for she was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A child of Nature, carelessly array'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If fond of a chance ogle at her glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was like the fawn, which, in the lake display'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beholds her own shy, shadowy image pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When first she starts, and then returns to peep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Admiring this new native of the deep.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And one by one her articles of dress<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were laid aside; but not before she offer'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her aid to fair Juanna, whose excess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of modesty declined the assistance proffer'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which pass'd well off--as she could do no less;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though by this politesse she rather suffer'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pricking her fingers with those cursed pins,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which surely were invented for our sins,--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Making a woman like a porcupine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not to be rashly touch'd. But still more dread,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh ye! whose fate it is, as once 't was mine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In early youth, to turn a lady's maid;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I did my very boyish best to shine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In tricking her out for a masquerade;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The pins were placed sufficiently, but not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stuck all exactly in the proper spot.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But these are foolish things to all the wise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I love wisdom more than she loves me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My tendency is to philosophise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On most things, from a tyrant to a tree;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still the spouseless virgin Knowledge flies.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What are we? and whence came we? what shall be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our ultimate existence? what's our present?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are questions answerless, and yet incessant.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was deep silence in the chamber: dim<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And distant from each other burn'd the lights,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And slumber hover'd o'er each lovely limb<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the fair occupants: if there be sprites,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They should have walk'd there in their sprightliest trim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By way of change from their sepulchral sites,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And shown themselves as ghosts of better taste<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than haunting some old ruin or wild waste.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Many and beautiful lay those around,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like flowers of different hue, and dime, and root,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In some exotic garden sometimes found,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With cost, and care, and warmth induced to shoot.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One with her auburn tresses lightly bound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fair brows gently drooping, as the fruit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nods from the tree, was slumbering with soft breath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And lips apart, which show'd the pearls beneath.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One with her flush'd cheek laid on her white arm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And raven ringlets gather'd in dark crowd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Above her brow, lay dreaming soft and warm;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And smiling through her dream, as through a cloud<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The moon breaks, half unveil'd each further charm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As, slightly stirring in her snowy shroud,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her beauties seized the unconscious hour of night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All bashfully to struggle into light.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is no bull, although it sounds so; for<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was night, but there were lamps, as hath been said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A third's all pallid aspect offer'd more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The traits of sleeping sorrow, and betray'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through the heaved breast the dream of some far shore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beloved and deplored; while slowly stray'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (As night-dew, on a cypress glittering, tinges<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The black bough) tear-drops through her eyes' dark fringes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A fourth as marble, statue-like and still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lay in a breathless, hush'd, and stony sleep;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; White, cold, and pure, as looks a frozen rill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or the snow minaret on an Alpine steep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or Lot's wife done in salt,--or what you will;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My similes are gather'd in a heap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So pick and choose--perhaps you 'll be content<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With a carved lady on a monument.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And lo! a fifth appears;--and what is she?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lady of a 'certain age,' which means<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Certainly aged--what her years might be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know not, never counting past their teens;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But there she slept, not quite so fair to see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As ere that awful period intervenes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which lays both men and women on the shelf,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To meditate upon their sins and self.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But all this time how slept, or dream'd, Dudu?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With strict inquiry I could ne'er discover,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And scorn to add a syllable untrue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ere the middle watch was hardly over,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just when the fading lamps waned dim and blue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And phantoms hover'd, or might seem to hover,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To those who like their company, about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The apartment, on a sudden she scream'd out:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that so loudly, that upstarted all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Oda, in a general commotion:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Matron and maids, and those whom you may call<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neither, came crowding like the waves of ocean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One on the other, throughout the whole hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All trembling, wondering, without the least notion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More than I have myself of what could make<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The calm Dudu so turbulently wake.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But wide awake she was, and round her bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With floating draperies and with flying hair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With eager eyes, and light but hurried tread,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bosoms, arms, and ankles glancing bare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And bright as any meteor ever bred<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the North Pole,--they sought her cause of care,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For she seem'd agitated, flush'd, and frighten'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her eye dilated and her colour heighten'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what was strange--and a strong proof how great<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A blessing is sound sleep--Juanna lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As fast as ever husband by his mate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In holy matrimony snores away.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not all the clamour broke her happy state<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of slumber, ere they shook her,--so they say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At least,--and then she, too, unclosed her eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yawn'd a good deal with discreet surprise.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now commenced a strict investigation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which, as all spoke at once and more than once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Conjecturing, wondering, asking a narration,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alike might puzzle either wit or dunce<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To answer in a very clear oration.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dudu had never pass'd for wanting sense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, being 'no orator as Brutus is,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could not at first expound what was amiss.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At length she said, that in a slumber sound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She dream'd a dream, of walking in a wood--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A 'wood obscure,' like that where Dante found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Himself in at the age when all grow good;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Life's half-way house, where dames with virtue crown'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Run much less risk of lovers turning rude;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that this wood was full of pleasant fruits,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And trees of goodly growth and spreading roots;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in the midst a golden apple grew,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A most prodigious pippin,--but it hung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rather too high and distant; that she threw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her glances on it, and then, longing, flung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stones and whatever she could pick up, to<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bring down the fruit, which still perversely clung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To its own bough, and dangled yet in sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But always at a most provoking height;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That on a sudden, when she least had hope,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It fell down of its own accord before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her feet; that her first movement was to stoop<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pick it up, and bite it to the core;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That just as her young lip began to ope<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the golden fruit the vision bore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A bee flew out and stung her to the heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so--she awoke with a great scream and start.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All this she told with some confusion and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dismay, the usual consequence of dreams<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the unpleasant kind, with none at hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To expound their vain and visionary gleams.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've known some odd ones which seem'd really plann'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prophetically, or that which one deems<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A'strange coincidence,' to use a phrase<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By which such things are settled now-a-days.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The damsels, who had thoughts of some great harm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Began, as is the consequence of fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To scold a little at the false alarm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That broke for nothing on their sleeping car.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The matron, too, was wroth to leave her warm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bed for the dream she had been obliged to hear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And chafed at poor Dudu, who only sigh'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And said that she was sorry she had cried.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'I 've heard of stories of a cock and bull;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But visions of an apple and a bee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To take us from our natural rest, and pull<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The whole Oda from their beds at half-past three,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would make us think the moon is at its full.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You surely are unwell, child! we must see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To-morrow, what his Highness's physician<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will say to this hysteric of a vision.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'And poor Juanna, too--the child's first night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within these walls to be broke in upon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With such a clamour! I had thought it right<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That the young stranger should not lie alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, as the quietest of all, she might<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With you, Dudu, a good night's rest have known;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now I must transfer her to the charge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Lolah--though her couch is not so large.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lolah's eyes sparkled at the proposition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But poor Dudu, with large drops in her own,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Resulting from the scolding or the vision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Implored that present pardon might be shown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For this first fault, and that on no condition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (She added in a soft and piteous tone)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juanna should be taken from her, and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her future dreams should all be kept in hand.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She promised never more to have a dream,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least to dream so loudly as just now;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She wonder'd at herself how she could scream--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was foolish, nervous, as she must allow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A fond hallucination, and a theme<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For laughter--but she felt her spirits low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And begg'd they would excuse her; she 'd get over<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This weakness in a few hours, and recover.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And here Juanna kindly interposed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And said she felt herself extremely well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where she then was, as her sound sleep disclosed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When all around rang like a tocsin bell:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She did not find herself the least disposed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To quit her gentle partner, and to dwell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Apart from one who had no sin to show,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save that of dreaming once 'mal-a-propos.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As thus Juanna spoke, Dudu turn'd round<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And hid her face within Juanna's breast:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her neck alone was seen, but that was found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The colour of a budding rose's crest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't tell why she blush'd, nor can expound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The mystery of this rupture of their rest;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All that I know is, that the facts I state<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are true as truth has ever been of late.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so good night to them,--or, if you will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good morrow--for the cock had crown, and light<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Began to clothe each Asiatic hill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the mosque crescent struggled into sight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the long caravan, which in the chill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of dewy dawn wound slowly round each height<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That stretches to the stony belt, which girds<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Asia, where Kaff looks down upon the Kurds.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the first ray, or rather grey of morn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gulbeyaz rose from restlessness; and pale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As passion rises, with its bosom worn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Array'd herself with mantle, gem, and veil.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The nightingale that sings with the deep thorn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which fable places in her breast of wail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is lighter far of heart and voice than those<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose headlong passions form their proper woes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that's the moral of this composition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If people would but see its real drift;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But that they will not do without suspicion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because all gentle readers have the gift<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of closing 'gainst the light their orbs of vision;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While gentle writers also love to lift<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their voices 'gainst each other, which is natural,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The numbers are too great for them to flatter all.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rose the sultana from a bed of splendour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Softer than the soft Sybarite's, who cried<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aloud because his feelings were too tender<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To brook a ruffled rose-leaf by his side,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So beautiful that art could little mend her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though pale with conflicts between love and pride;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So agitated was she with her error,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She did not even look into the mirror.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also arose about the self-same time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps a little later, her great lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Master of thirty kingdoms so sublime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of a wife by whom he was abhorr'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A thing of much less import in that clime--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least to those of incomes which afford<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The filling up their whole connubial cargo--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than where two wives are under an embargo.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He did not think much on the matter, nor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed on any other: as a man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He liked to have a handsome paramour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At hand, as one may like to have a fan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore of Circassians had good store,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As an amusement after the Divan;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though an unusual fit of love, or duty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had made him lately bask in his bride's beauty.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now he rose; and after due ablutions<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exacted by the customs of the East,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And prayers and other pious evolutions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He drank six cups of coffee at the least,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then withdrew to hear about the Russians,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose victories had recently increased<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Catherine's reign, whom glory still adores,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But oh, thou grand legitimate Alexander!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her son's son, let not this last phrase offend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thine ear, if it should reach--and now rhymes wander<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Almost as far as Petersburgh and lend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A dreadful impulse to each loud meander<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of murmuring Liberty's wide waves, which blend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their roar even with the Baltic's--so you be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your father's son, 't is quite enough for me.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To call men love-begotten or proclaim<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their mothers as the antipodes of Timon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That hater of mankind, would be a shame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A libel, or whate'er you please to rhyme on:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But people's ancestors are history's game;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if one lady's slip could leave a crime on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All generations, I should like to know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What pedigree the best would have to show?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had Catherine and the sultan understood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their own true interests, which kings rarely know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until 't is taught by lessons rather rude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was a way to end their strife, although<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps precarious, had they but thought good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without the aid of prince or plenipo:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She to dismiss her guards and he his haram,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And for their other matters, meet and share 'em.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as it was, his Highness had to hold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His daily council upon ways and means<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How to encounter with this martial scold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This modern Amazon and queen of queans;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the perplexity could not be told<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the pillars of the state, which leans<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes a little heavy on the backs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of those who cannot lay on a new tax.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime Gulbeyaz, when her king was gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Retired into her boudoir, a sweet place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For love or breakfast; private, pleasing, lone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And rich with all contrivances which grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those gay recesses:--many a precious stone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sparkled along its roof, and many a vase<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of porcelain held in the fetter'd flowers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those captive soothers of a captive's hours.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mother of pearl, and porphyry, and marble,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vied with each other on this costly spot;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And singing birds without were heard to warble;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the stain'd glass which lighted this fair grot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Varied each ray;--but all descriptions garble<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The true effect, and so we had better not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Be too minute; an outline is the best,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lively reader's fancy does the rest.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And here she summon'd Baba, and required<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan at his hands, and information<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of what had pass'd since all the slaves retired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And whether he had occupied their station;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If matters had been managed as desired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And his disguise with due consideration<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kept up; and above all, the where and how<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had pass'd the night, was what she wish'd to know.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Baba, with some embarrassment, replied<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To this long catechism of questions, ask'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More easily than answer'd,--that he had tried<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His best to obey in what he had been task'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But there seem'd something that he wish'd to hide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which hesitation more betray'd than mask'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He scratch'd his ear, the infallible resource<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To which embarrass'd people have recourse.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gulbeyaz was no model of true patience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor much disposed to wait in word or deed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She liked quick answers in all conversations;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when she saw him stumbling like a steed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In his replies, she puzzled him for fresh ones;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as his speech grew still more broken-kneed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her cheek began to flush, her eyes to sparkle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And her proud brow's blue veins to swell and darkle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Baba saw these symptoms, which he knew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bode him no great good, he deprecated<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her anger, and beseech'd she 'd hear him through--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He could not help the thing which he related:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then out it came at length, that to Dudu<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan was given in charge, as hath been stated;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But not by Baba's fault, he said, and swore on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The holy camel's hump, besides the Koran.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The chief dame of the Oda, upon whom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The discipline of the whole haram bore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as they re-enter'd their own room,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Baba's function stopt short at the door,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had settled all; nor could he then presume<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (The aforesaid Baba) just then to do more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without exciting such suspicion as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Might make the matter still worse than it was.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He hoped, indeed he thought, he could be sure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan had not betray'd himself; in fact<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was certain that his conduct had been pure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because a foolish or imprudent act<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would not alone have made him insecure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ended in his being found out and sack'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thrown into the sea.--Thus Baba spoke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all save Dudu's dream, which was no joke.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This he discreetly kept in the background,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And talk'd away--and might have talk'd till now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For any further answer that he found,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So deep an anguish wrung Gulbeyaz' brow:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her cheek turn'd ashes, ears rung, brain whirl'd round,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if she had received a sudden blow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the heart's dew of pain sprang fast and chilly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'er her fair front, like Morning's on a lily.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although she was not of the fainting sort,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Baba thought she would faint, but there he err'd--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was but a convulsion, which though short<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can never be described; we all have heard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And some of us have felt thus 'all amort,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When things beyond the common have occurr'd;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gulbeyaz proved in that brief agony<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What she could ne'er express--then how should I?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She stood a moment as a Pythones<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stands on her tripod, agonised, and full<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of inspiration gather'd from distress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When all the heart-strings like wild horses pull<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The heart asunder;--then, as more or lees<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their speed abated or their strength grew dull,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She sunk down on her seat by slow degrees,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And bow'd her throbbing head o'er trembling knees.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her face declined and was unseen; her hair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sweeping the marble underneath her chair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or rather sofa (for it was all pillow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A low soft ottoman), and black despair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stirr'd up and down her bosom like a billow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which rushes to some shore whose shingles check<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its farther course, but must receive its wreck.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her head hung down, and her long hair in stooping<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Conceal'd her features better than a veil;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And one hand o'er the ottoman lay drooping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; White, waxen, and as alabaster pale:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would that I were a painter! to be grouping<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All that a poet drags into detail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh that my words were colours! but their tints<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May serve perhaps as outlines or slight hints.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Baba, who knew by experience when to talk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And when to hold his tongue, now held it till<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This passion might blow o'er, nor dared to balk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gulbeyaz' taciturn or speaking will.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At length she rose up, and began to walk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Slowly along the room, but silent still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And her brow clear'd, but not her troubled eye;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wind was down, but still the sea ran high.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She stopp'd, and raised her head to speak--but paused,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then moved on again with rapid pace;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then slacken'd it, which is the march most caused<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By deep emotion:--you may sometimes trace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A feeling in each footstep, as disclosed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Sallust in his Catiline, who, chased<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By all the demons of all passions, show'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their work even by the way in which he trode.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gulbeyaz stopp'd and beckon'd Baba:--'Slave!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bring the two slaves!' she said in a low tone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But one which Baba did not like to brave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet he shudder'd, and seem'd rather prone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To prove reluctant, and begg'd leave to crave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Though he well knew the meaning) to be shown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What slaves her highness wish'd to indicate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For fear of any error, like the late.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'The Georgian and her paramour,' replied<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The imperial bride--and added, 'Let the boat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Be ready by the secret portal's side:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You know the rest.' The words stuck in her throat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Despite her injured love and fiery pride;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And of this Baba willingly took note,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And begg'd by every hair of Mahomet's beard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She would revoke the order he had heard.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'To hear is to obey,' he said; 'but still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sultana, think upon the consequence:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is not that I shall not all fulfil<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your orders, even in their severest sense;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But such precipitation may end ill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even at your own imperative expense:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I do not mean destruction and exposure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In case of any premature disclosure;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But your own feelings. Even should all the rest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be hidden by the rolling waves, which hide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Already many a once love-beaten breast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deep in the caverns of the deadly tide--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You love this boyish, new, seraglio guest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And if this violent remedy be tried--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Excuse my freedom, when I here assure you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That killing him is not the way to cure you.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'What dost thou know of love or feeling?--Wretch!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Begone!' she cried, with kindling eyes--'and do<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My bidding!' Baba vanish'd, for to stretch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His own remonstrance further he well knew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Might end in acting as his own 'Jack Ketch;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though he wish'd extremely to get through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This awkward business without harm to others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He still preferr'd his own neck to another's.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Away he went then upon his commission,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Growling and grumbling in good Turkish phrase<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Against all women of whate'er condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially sultanas and their ways;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their obstinacy, pride, and indecision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their never knowing their own mind two days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The trouble that they gave, their immorality,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which made him daily bless his own neutrality.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then he call'd his brethren to his aid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sent one on a summons to the pair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That they must instantly be well array'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And above all be comb'd even to a hair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And brought before the empress, who had made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inquiries after them with kindest care:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At which Dudu look'd strange, and Juan silly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But go they must at once, and will I--nill I.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And here I leave them at their preparation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the imperial presence, wherein whether<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gulbeyaz show'd them both commiseration,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or got rid of the parties altogether,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like other angry ladies of her nation,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are things the turning of a hair or feather<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May settle; but far be 't from me to anticipate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In what way feminine caprice may dissipate.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I leave them for the present with good wishes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though doubts of their well doing, to arrange<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another part of history; for the dishes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this our banquet we must sometimes change;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And trusting Juan may escape the fishes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although his situation now seems strange<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And scarce secure, as such digressions are fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Muse will take a little touch at warfare.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; O LOVE! O Glory! what are ye who fly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Around us ever, rarely to alight?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's not a meteor in the polar sky<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of such transcendent and more fleeting flight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Chill, and chain'd to cold earth, we lift on high<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our eyes in search of either lovely light;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A thousand and a thousand colours they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Assume, then leave us on our freezing way.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And such as they are, such my present tale is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A non-descript and ever-varying rhyme,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A versified Aurora Borealis,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which flashes o'er a waste and icy clime.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When we know what all are, we must bewail us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ne'ertheless I hope it is no crime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To laugh at all things--for I wish to know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What, after all, are all things--but a show?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They accuse me--Me--the present writer of<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The present poem--of--I know not what--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A tendency to under-rate and scoff<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At human power and virtue, and all that;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And this they say in language rather rough.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good God! I wonder what they would be at!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I say no more than hath been said in Dante's<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Verse, and by Solomon and by Cervantes;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By Swift, by Machiavel, by Rochefoucault,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Fenelon, by Luther, and by Plato;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By Tillotson, and Wesley, and Rousseau,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who knew this life was not worth a potato.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is not their fault, nor mine, if this be so--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my part, I pretend not to be Cato,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor even Diogenes.--We live and die,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But which is best, you know no more than I.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Socrates said, our only knowledge was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'To know that nothing could be known;' a pleasant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Science enough, which levels to an ass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each man of wisdom, future, past, or present.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Newton (that proverb of the mind), alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Declared, with all his grand discoveries recent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That he himself felt only 'like a youth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Picking up shells by the great ocean--Truth.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ecclesiastes said, 'that all is vanity'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most modern preachers say the same, or show it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By their examples of true Christianity:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In short, all know, or very soon may know it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in this scene of all-confess'd inanity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By saint, by sage, by preacher, and by poet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must I restrain me, through the fear of strife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From holding up the nothingness of life?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dogs, or men!--for I flatter you in saying<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That ye are dogs--your betters far--ye may<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Read, or read not, what I am now essaying<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To show ye what ye are in every way.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As little as the moon stops for the baying<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of wolves, will the bright muse withdraw one ray<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From out her skies--then howl your idle wrath!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While she still silvers o'er your gloomy path.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Fierce loves and faithless wars'--I am not sure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If this be the right reading--'t is no matter;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fact's about the same, I am secure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I sing them both, and am about to batter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A town which did a famous siege endure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And was beleaguer'd both by land and water<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By Souvaroff, or Anglice Suwarrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who loved blood as an alderman loves marrow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fortress is call'd Ismail, and is placed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the Danube's left branch and left bank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With buildings in the Oriental taste,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But still a fortress of the foremost rank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or was at least, unless 't is since defaced,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which with your conquerors is a common prank:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It stands some eighty versts from the high sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And measures round of toises thousands three.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Within the extent of this fortification<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A borough is comprised along the height<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the left, which from its loftier station<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commands the city, and upon its site<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A Greek had raised around this elevation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A quantity of palisades upright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So placed as to impede the fire of those<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who held the place, and to assist the foe's.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This circumstance may serve to give a notion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the high talents of this new Vauban:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the town ditch below was deep as ocean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The rampart higher than you 'd wish to hang:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then there was a great want of precaution<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Prithee, excuse this engineering slang),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor work advanced, nor cover'd way was there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To hint at least 'Here is no thoroughfare.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But a stone bastion, with a narrow gorge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And walls as thick as most skulls born as yet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two batteries, cap-a-pie, as our St. George,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Case-mated one, and t' other 'a barbette,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Danube's bank took formidable charge;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While two and twenty cannon duly set<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rose over the town's right side, in bristling tier,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Forty feet high, upon a cavalier.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But from the river the town's open quite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because the Turks could never be persuaded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A Russian vessel e'er would heave in sight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And such their creed was, till they were invaded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When it grew rather late to set things right.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as the Danube could not well be waded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They look'd upon the Muscovite flotilla,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And only shouted, 'Allah!' and 'Bis Millah!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Russians now were ready to attack:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But oh, ye goddesses of war and glory!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How shall I spell the name of each Cossacque<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who were immortal, could one tell their story?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! what to their memory can lack?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Achilles' self was not more grim and gory<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than thousands of this new and polish'd nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose names want nothing but--pronunciation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still I 'll record a few, if but to increase<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our euphony: there was Strongenoff, and Strokonoff,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meknop, Serge Lwow, Arsniew of modern Greece,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Tschitsshakoff, and Roguenoff, and Chokenoff,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And others of twelve consonants apiece;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And more might be found out, if I could poke enough<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into gazettes; but Fame (capricious strumpet),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seems, has got an ear as well as trumpet,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And cannot tune those discords of narration,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which may be names at Moscow, into rhyme;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet there were several worth commemoration,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As e'er was virgin of a nuptial chime;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soft words, too, fitted for the peroration<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Londonderry drawling against time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ending in 'ischskin,' 'ousckin,' 'iffskchy,' 'ouski:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of whom we can insert but Rousamouski,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Scherematoff and Chrematoff, Koklophti,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Koclobski, Kourakin, and Mouskin Pouskin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All proper men of weapons, as e'er scoff'd high<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against a foe, or ran a sabre through skin:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Little cared they for Mahomet or Mufti,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless to make their kettle-drums a new skin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Out of their hides, if parchment had grown dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And no more handy substitute been near.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there were foreigners of much renown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of various nations, and all volunteers;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not fighting for their country or its crown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But wishing to be one day brigadiers;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also to have the sacking of a town,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A pleasant thing to young men at their years.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Mongst them were several Englishmen of pith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sixteen call'd Thomson, and nineteen named Smith.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jack Thomson and Bill Thomson; all the rest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had been call'd 'Jemmy,' after the great bard;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know whether they had arms or crest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But such a godfather's as good a card.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Three of the Smiths were Peters; but the best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst them all, hard blows to inflict or ward,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was he, since so renown'd 'in country quarters<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At Halifax;' but now he served the Tartars.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rest were jacks and Gills and Wills and Bills;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But when I 've added that the elder jack Smith<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was born in Cumberland among the hills,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that his father was an honest blacksmith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've said all I know of a name that fills<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Three lines of the despatch in taking'schmacksmith,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A village of Moldavia's waste, wherein<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He fell, immortal in a bulletin.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wonder (although Mars no doubt's a god<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Praise) if a man's name in a bulletin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May make up for a bullet in his body?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hope this little question is no sin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because, though I am but a simple noddy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think one Shakspeare puts the same thought in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mouth of some one in his plays so doting,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which many people pass for wits by quoting.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there were Frenchmen, gallant, young, and gay:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I 'm too great a patriot to record<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their Gallic names upon a glorious day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'd rather tell ten lies than say a word<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of truth;--such truths are treason; they betray<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their country; and as traitors are abhorr'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who name the French in English, save to show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How Peace should make John Bull the Frenchman's foe.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Russians, having built two batteries on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An isle near Ismail, had two ends in view;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first was to bombard it, and knock down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The public buildings and the private too,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No matter what poor souls might be undone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The city's shape suggested this, 't is true;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Form'd like an amphitheatre, each dwelling<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Presented a fine mark to throw a shell in.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The second object was to profit by<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The moment of the general consternation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To attack the Turk's flotilla, which lay nigh<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Extremely tranquil, anchor'd at its station:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But a third motive was as probably<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To frighten them into capitulation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A phantasy which sometimes seizes warriors,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless they are game as bull-dogs and fox-terriers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A habit rather blamable, which is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That of despising those we combat with,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Common in many cases, was in this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cause of killing Tchitchitzkoff and Smith;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the valorous'smiths' whom we shall miss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of those nineteen who late rhymed to 'pith;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But 't is a name so spread o'er'sir' and 'Madam,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That one would think the first who bore it 'Adam.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Russian batteries were incomplete,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because they were constructed in a hurry;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the same cause which makes a verse want feet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And throws a cloud o'er Longman and John Murray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When the sale of new books is not so fleet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As they who print them think is necessary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May likewise put off for a time what story<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes calls 'murder,' and at others 'glory.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether it was their engineer's stupidity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their haste, or waste, I neither know nor care,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or some contractor's personal cupidity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saving his soul by cheating in the ware<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of homicide, but there was no solidity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the new batteries erected there;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They either miss'd, or they were never miss'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And added greatly to the missing list.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sad miscalculation about distance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made all their naval matters incorrect;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Three fireships lost their amiable existence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before they reach'd a spot to take effect:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The match was lit too soon, and no assistance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could remedy this lubberly defect;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They blew up in the middle of the river,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While, though 't was dawn, the Turks slept fast as ever.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At seven they rose, however, and survey'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Russ flotilla getting under way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was nine, when still advancing undismay'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within a cable's length their vessels lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Off Ismail, and commenced a cannonade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which was return'd with interest, I may say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And by a fire of musketry and grape,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And shells and shot of every size and shape.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For six hours bore they without intermission<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Turkish fire, and aided by their own<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Land batteries, work'd their guns with great precision:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At length they found mere cannonade alone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By no means would produce the town's submission,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made a signal to retreat at one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One bark blew up, a second near the works<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Running aground, was taken by the Turks.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Moslem, too, had lost both ships and men;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But when they saw the enemy retire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their Delhis mann'd some boats, and sail'd again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gall'd the Russians with a heavy fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And tried to make a landing on the main;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But here the effect fell short of their desire:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Count Damas drove them back into the water<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pell-mell, and with a whole gazette of slaughter.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'If' (says the historian here) 'I could report<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All that the Russians did upon this day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think that several volumes would fall short,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I should still have many things to say;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so he says no more--but pays his court<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To some distinguish'd strangers in that fray;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Prince de Ligne, and Langeron, and Damas,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Names great as any that the roll of Fame has.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This being the case, may show us what Fame is:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For out of these three 'preux Chevaliers,' how<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Many of common readers give a guess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That such existed? (and they may live now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For aught we know.) Renown's all hit or miss;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's fortune even in fame, we must allow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is true the Memoirs of the Prince de Ligne<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have half withdrawn from him oblivion's screen.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here are men who fought in gallant actions<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As gallantly as ever heroes fought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But buried in the heap of such transactions<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their names are rarely found, nor often sought.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus even good fame may suffer sad contractions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And is extinguish'd sooner than she ought:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all our modern battles, I will bet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You can't repeat nine names from each Gazette.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In short, this last attack, though rich in glory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Show'd that somewhere, somehow, there was a fault,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Admiral Ribas (known in Russian story)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most strongly recommended an assault;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In which he was opposed by young and hoary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which made a long debate; but I must halt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For if I wrote down every warrior's speech,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I doubt few readers e'er would mount the breach.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a man, if that he was a man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not that his manhood could be call'd in question,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For had he not been Hercules, his span<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had been as short in youth as indigestion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Made his last illness, when, all worn and wan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He died beneath a tree, as much unblest on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The soil of the green province he had wasted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As e'er was locust on the land it blasted.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This was Potemkin--a great thing in days<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When homicide and harlotry made great;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If stars and titles could entail long praise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His glory might half equal his estate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This fellow, being six foot high, could raise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A kind of phantasy proportionate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the then sovereign of the Russian people,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who measured men as you would do a steeple.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While things were in abeyance, Ribas sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A courier to the prince, and he succeeded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In ordering matters after his own bent;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot tell the way in which he pleaded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But shortly he had cause to be content.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the mean time, the batteries proceeded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fourscore cannon on the Danube's border<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were briskly fired and answer'd in due order.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But on the thirteenth, when already part<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the troops were embark'd, the siege to raise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A courier on the spur inspired new heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into all panters for newspaper praise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As well as dilettanti in war's art,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By his despatches couch'd in pithy phrase;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Announcing the appointment of that lover of<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Battles to the command, Field-Marshal Souvaroff.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The letter of the prince to the same marshal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was worthy of a Spartan, had the cause<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Been one to which a good heart could be partial--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Defence of freedom, country, or of laws;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as it was mere lust of power to o'er-arch all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With its proud brow, it merits slight applause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save for its style, which said, all in a trice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'You will take Ismail at whatever price.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Let there be light! said God, and there was light!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Let there be blood!' says man, and there's a seal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fiat of this spoil'd child of the Night<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (For Day ne'er saw his merits) could decree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More evil in an hour, than thirty bright<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Summers could renovate, though they should be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lovely as those which ripen'd Eden's fruit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For war cuts up not only branch, but root.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our friends the Turks, who with loud 'Allahs' now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Began to signalise the Russ retreat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were damnably mistaken; few are slow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In thinking that their enemy is beat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Or beaten, if you insist on grammar, though<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never think about it in a heat),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here I say the Turks were much mistaken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who hating hogs, yet wish'd to save their bacon.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For, on the sixteenth, at full gallop, drew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In sight two horsemen, who were deem'd Cossacques<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For some time, till they came in nearer view.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They had but little baggage at their backs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For there were but three shirts between the two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But on they rode upon two Ukraine hacks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till, in approaching, were at length descried<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this plain pair, Suwarrow and his guide.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Great joy to London now!' says some great fool,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When London had a grand illumination,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which to that bottle-conjurer, John Bull,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is of all dreams the first hallucination;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that the streets of colour'd lamps are full,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Sage (said john) surrenders at discretion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His purse, his soul, his sense, and even his nonsense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To gratify, like a huge moth, this one sense.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is strange that he should farther 'damn his eyes,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For they are damn'd; that once all-famous oath<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is to the devil now no farther prize,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since John has lately lost the use of both.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Debt he calls wealth, and taxes Paradise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Famine, with her gaunt and bony growth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which stare him in the face, he won't examine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or swears that Ceres hath begotten Famine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to the tale:--great joy unto the camp!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Russian, Tartar, English, French, Cossacque,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'er whom Suwarrow shone like a gas lamp,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Presaging a most luminous attack;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or like a wisp along the marsh so damp,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which leads beholders on a boggy walk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He flitted to and fro a dancing light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which all who saw it follow'd, wrong or right.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But certes matters took a different face;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was enthusiasm and much applause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fleet and camp saluted with great grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all presaged good fortune to their cause.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Within a cannon-shot length of the place<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They drew, constructed ladders, repair'd flaws<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In former works, made new, prepared fascines,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all kinds of benevolent machines.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is thus the spirit of a single mind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Makes that of multitudes take one direction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As roll the waters to the breathing wind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or roams the herd beneath the bull's protection;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or as a little dog will lead the blind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or a bell-wether form the flock's connection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By tinkling sounds, when they go forth to victual;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such is the sway of your great men o'er little.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The whole camp rung with joy; you would have thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That they were going to a marriage feast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (This metaphor, I think, holds good as aught,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since there is discord after both at least):<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was not now a luggage boy but sought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Danger and spoil with ardour much increased;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And why? because a little--odd--old man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stript to his shirt, was come to lead the van.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But so it was; and every preparation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was made with all alacrity: the first<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Detachment of three columns took its station,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And waited but the signal's voice to burst<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the foe: the second's ordination<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was also in three columns, with a thirst<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For glory gaping o'er a sea of slaughter:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The third, in columns two, attack'd by water.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; New batteries were erected, and was held<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A general council, in which unanimity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That stranger to most councils, here prevail'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As sometimes happens in a great extremity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And every difficulty being dispell'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Glory began to dawn with due sublimity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While Souvaroff, determined to obtain it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was teaching his recruits to use the bayonet<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is an actual fact, that he, commander<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In chief, in proper person deign'd to drill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The awkward squad, and could afford to squander<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His time, a corporal's duty to fulfil:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as you 'd break a sucking salamander<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To swallow flame, and never take it ill:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He show'd them how to mount a ladder (which<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was not like Jacob's) or to cross a ditch.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also he dress'd up, for the nonce, fascines<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like men with turbans, scimitars, and dirks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And made them charge with bayonet these machines,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By way of lesson against actual Turks:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when well practised in these mimic scenes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He judged them proper to assail the works;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At which your wise men sneer'd in phrases witty:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He made no answer; but he took the city.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most things were in this posture on the eve<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the assault, and all the camp was in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A stern repose; which you would scarce conceive;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet men resolved to dash through thick and thin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are very silent when they once believe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That all is settled:--there was little din,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For some were thinking of their home and friends,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And others of themselves and latter ends.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suwarrow chiefly was on the alert,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Surveying, drilling, ordering, jesting, pondering;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the man was, we safely may assert,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing to wonder at beyond most wondering;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hero, buffoon, half-demon, and half-dirt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Praying, instructing, desolating, plundering;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now Mars, now Momus; and when bent to storm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A fortress, Harlequin in uniform.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The day before the assault, while upon drill--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For this great conqueror play'd the corporal--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some Cossacques, hovering like hawks round a hill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had met a party towards the twilight's fall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of whom spoke their tongue--or well or ill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was much that he was understood at all;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But whether from his voice, or speech, or manner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They found that he had fought beneath their banner.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whereon immediately at his request<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They brought him and his comrades to head-quarters;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their dress was Moslem, but you might have guess'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That these were merely masquerading Tartars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that beneath each Turkish-fashion'd vest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lurk'd Christianity; which sometimes barters<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her inward grace for outward show, and makes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It difficult to shun some strange mistakes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suwarrow, who was standing in his shirt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before a company of Calmucks, drilling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exclaiming, fooling, swearing at the inert,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lecturing on the noble art of killing,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For deeming human clay but common dirt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This great philosopher was thus instilling<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His maxims, which to martial comprehension<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Proved death in battle equal to a pension;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suwarrow, when he saw this company<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Cossacques and their prey, turn'd round and cast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon them his slow brow and piercing eye:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Whence come ye?'--'From Constantinople last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Captives just now escaped,' was the reply.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'What are ye?'--'What you see us.' Briefly pass'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This dialogue; for he who answer'd knew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To whom he spoke, and made his words but few.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Your names?'--'Mine's Johnson, and my comrade's Juan;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The other two are women, and the third<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is neither man nor woman.' The chief threw on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The party a slight glance, then said, 'I have heard<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your name before, the second is a new one:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bring the other three here was absurd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But let that pass:--I think I have heard your name<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the Nikolaiew regiment?'--'The same.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'You served at Widdin?'--'Yes.'--'You led the attack?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I did.'--'What next?'--'I really hardly know.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'You were the first i' the breach?'--'I was not slack<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least to follow those who might be so.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'What follow'd?'--'A shot laid me on my back,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I became a prisoner to the foe.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'You shall have vengeance, for the town surrounded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is twice as strong as that where you were wounded.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Where will you serve?'--'Where'er you please.'--'I know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You like to be the hope of the forlorn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And doubtless would be foremost on the foe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the hardships you 've already borne.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And this young fellow--say what can he do?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He with the beardless chin and garments torn?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Why, general, if he hath no greater fault<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In war than love, he had better lead the assault.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'He shall if that he dare.' Here Juan bow'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Low as the compliment deserved. Suwarrow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Continued: 'Your old regiment's allow'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By special providence, to lead to-morrow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or it may be to-night, the assault: I have vow'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To several saints, that shortly plough or harrow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shall pass o'er what was Ismail, and its tusk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Be unimpeded by the proudest mosque.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'so now, my lads, for glory!'--Here he turn'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And drill'd away in the most classic Russian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until each high, heroic bosom burn'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For cash and conquest, as if from a cushion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A preacher had held forth (who nobly spurn'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All earthly goods save tithes) and bade them push on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To slay the Pagans who resisted, battering<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The armies of the Christian Empress Catherine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Johnson, who knew by this long colloquy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Himself a favourite, ventured to address<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suwarrow, though engaged with accents high<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In his resumed amusement. 'I confess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My debt in being thus allow'd to die<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Among the foremost; but if you 'd express<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Explicitly our several posts, my friend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And self would know what duty to attend.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Right! I was busy, and forgot. Why, you<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will join your former regiment, which should be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now under arms. Ho! Katskoff, take him to<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Here he call'd up a Polish orderly)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His post, I mean the regiment Nikolaiew:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stranger stripling may remain with me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He's a fine boy. The women may be sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the other baggage, or to the sick tent.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here a sort of scene began to ensue:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ladies,--who by no means had been bred<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To be disposed of in a way so new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although their haram education led<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Doubtless to that of doctrines the most true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Passive obedience,--now raised up the head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With flashing eyes and starting tears, and flung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their arms, as hens their wings about their young,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'er the promoted couple of brave men<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who were thus honour'd by the greatest chief<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That ever peopled hell with heroes slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or plunged a province or a realm in grief.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, foolish mortals! Always taught in vain!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, glorious laurel! since for one sole leaf<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of thine imaginary deathless tree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of blood and tears must flow the unebbing sea.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suwarrow, who had small regard for tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not much sympathy for blood, survey'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The women with their hair about their ears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And natural agonies, with a slight shade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of feeling: for however habit sears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men's hearts against whole millions, when their trade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is butchery, sometimes a single sorrow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will touch even heroes--and such was Suwarrow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He said,--and in the kindest Calmuck tone,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Why, Johnson, what the devil do you mean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By bringing women here? They shall be shown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All the attention possible, and seen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In safety to the waggons, where alone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact they can be safe. You should have been<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aware this kind of baggage never thrives:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save wed a year, I hate recruits with wives.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'May it please your excellency,' thus replied<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our British friend, 'these are the wives of others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And not our own. I am too qualified<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By service with my military brothers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To break the rules by bringing one's own bride<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into a camp: I know that nought so bothers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The hearts of the heroic on a charge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As leaving a small family at large.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But these are but two Turkish ladies, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With their attendant aided our escape,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And afterwards accompanied us through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thousand perils in this dubious shape.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To me this kind of life is not so new;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To them, poor things, it is an awkward scrape.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I therefore, if you wish me to fight freely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Request that they may both be used genteelly.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime these two poor girls, with swimming eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look'd on as if in doubt if they could trust<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their own protectors; nor was their surprise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Less than their grief (and truly not less just)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To see an old man, rather wild than wise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In aspect, plainly clad, besmear'd with dust,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stript to his waistcoat, and that not too clean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More fear'd than all the sultans ever seen.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For every thing seem'd resting on his nod,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As they could read in all eyes. Now to them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who were accustom'd, as a sort of god,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To see the sultan, rich in many a gem,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like an imperial peacock stalk abroad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (That royal bird, whose tail's a diadem),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With all the pomp of power, it was a doubt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How power could condescend to do without.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; John Johnson, seeing their extreme dismay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though little versed in feelings oriental,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suggested some slight comfort in his way:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan, who was much more sentimental,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Swore they should see him by the dawn of day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or that the Russian army should repent all:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, strange to say, they found some consolation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this--for females like exaggeration.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then with tears, and sighs, and some slight kisses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They parted for the present--these to await,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to the artillery's hits or misses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What sages call Chance, Providence, or Fate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Uncertainty is one of many blisses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A mortgage on Humanity's estate)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While their beloved friends began to arm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To burn a town which never did them harm.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suwarrow,--who but saw things in the gross,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being much too gross to see them in detail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who calculated life as so much dross,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as the wind a widow'd nation's wail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And cared as little for his army's loss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (So that their efforts should at length prevail)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As wife and friends did for the boils of job,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What was 't to him to hear two women sob?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing.--The work of glory still went on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In preparations for a cannonade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As terrible as that of Ilion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Homer had found mortars ready made;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now, instead of slaying Priam's son,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We only can but talk of escalade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bombs, drums, guns, bastions, batteries, bayonets, bullets,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hard words, which stick in the soft Muses' gullets.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, thou eternal Homer! who couldst charm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All cars, though long; all ages, though so short,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By merely wielding with poetic arm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arms to which men will never more resort,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless gunpowder should be found to harm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Much less than is the hope of every court,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which now is leagued young Freedom to annoy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But they will not find Liberty a Troy:--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, thou eternal Homer! I have now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To paint a siege, wherein more men were slain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With deadlier engines and a speedier blow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than in thy Greek gazette of that campaign;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, like all men else, I must allow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To vie with thee would be about as vain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for a brook to cope with ocean's flood;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still we moderns equal you in blood;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If not in poetry, at least in fact;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fact is truth, the grand desideratum!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of which, howe'er the Muse describes each act,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There should be ne'ertheless a slight substratum.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now the town is going to be attack'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Great deeds are doing--how shall I relate 'em?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Souls of immortal generals! Phoebus watches<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To colour up his rays from your despatches.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, ye great bulletins of Bonaparte!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, ye less grand long lists of kill'd and wounded!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shade of Leonidas, who fought so hearty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When my poor Greece was once, as now, surrounded!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, Caesar's Commentaries! now impart, ye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shadows of glory! (lest I be confounded)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A portion of your fading twilight hues,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So beautiful, so fleeting, to the Muse.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When I call 'fading' martial immortality,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I mean, that every age and every year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And almost every day, in sad reality,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some sucking hero is compell'd to rear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who, when we come to sum up the totality<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of deeds to human happiness most dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Turns out to be a butcher in great business,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Afflicting young folks with a sort of dizziness.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Medals, rank, ribands, lace, embroidery, scarlet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are things immortal to immortal man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As purple to the Babylonian harlot:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An uniform to boys is like a fan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To women; there is scarce a crimson varlet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But deems himself the first in Glory's van.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Glory's glory; and if you would find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What that is--ask the pig who sees the wind!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At least he feels it, and some say he sees,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he runs before it like a pig;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or, if that simple sentence should displease,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say, that he scuds before it like a brig,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A schooner, or--but it is time to ease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This Canto, ere my Muse perceives fatigue.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The next shall ring a peal to shake all people,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like a bob-major from a village steeple.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hark! through the silence of the cold, dull night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hum of armies gathering rank on rank!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lo! dusky masses steal in dubious sight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Along the leaguer'd wall and bristling bank<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the arm'd river, while with straggling light<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stars peep through the vapours dim and dank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which curl in curious wreaths:--how soon the smoke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Hell shall pall them in a deeper cloak!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here pause we for the present--as even then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That awful pause, dividing life from death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Struck for an instant on the hearts of men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thousands of whom were drawing their last breath!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A moment--and all will be life again!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The march! the charge! the shouts of either faith!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hurra! and Allah! and--one moment more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The death-cry drowning in the battle's roar.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="aviii">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;              CANTO THE EIGHTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; OH blood and thunder! and oh blood and wounds!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These are but vulgar oaths, as you may deem,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Too gentle reader! and most shocking sounds:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so they are; yet thus is Glory's dream<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unriddled, and as my true Muse expounds<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At present such things, since they are her theme,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So be they her inspirers! Call them Mars,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bellona, what you will--they mean but wars.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All was prepared--the fire, the sword, the men<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To wield them in their terrible array.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The army, like a lion from his den,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; March'd forth with nerve and sinews bent to slay,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A human Hydra, issuing from its fen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To breathe destruction on its winding way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose heads were heroes, which cut off in vain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Immediately in others grew again.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; History can only take things in the gross;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But could we know them in detail, perchance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In balancing the profit and the loss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; War's merit it by no means might enhance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To waste so much gold for a little dross,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As hath been done, mere conquest to advance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The drying up a single tear has more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of honest fame, than shedding seas of gore.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And why?--because it brings self-approbation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whereas the other, after all its glare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shouts, bridges, arches, pensions from a nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which (it may be) has not much left to spare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A higher title, or a loftier station,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though they may make Corruption gape or stare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet, in the end, except in Freedom's battles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are nothing but a child of Murder's rattles.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And such they are--and such they will be found:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not so Leonidas and Washington,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose every battle-field is holy ground,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which breathes of nations saved, not worlds undone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While the mere victor's may appal or stun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The servile and the vain, such names will be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A watchword till the future shall be free.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The night was dark, and the thick mist allow'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nought to be seen save the artillery's flame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which arch'd the horizon like a fiery cloud,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in the Danube's waters shone the same--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A mirror'd hell! the volleying roar, and loud<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Long booming of each peal on peal, o'ercame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ear far more than thunder; for Heaven's flashes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Spare, or smite rarely--man's make millions ashes!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The column order'd on the assault scarce pass'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond the Russian batteries a few toises,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When up the bristling Moslem rose at last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Answering the Christian thunders with like voices:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then one vast fire, air, earth, and stream embraced,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which rock'd as 't were beneath the mighty noises;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While the whole rampart blazed like Etna, when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The restless Titan hiccups in his den.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And one enormous shout of 'Allah!' rose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the same moment, loud as even the roar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of war's most mortal engines, to their foes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hurling defiance: city, stream, and shore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Resounded 'Allah!' and the clouds which close<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With thick'ning canopy the conflict o'er,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Vibrate to the Eternal name. Hark! through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All sounds it pierceth 'Allah! Allah! Hu!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The columns were in movement one and all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But of the portion which attack'd by water,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thicker than leaves the lives began to fall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though led by Arseniew, that great son of slaughter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As brave as ever faced both bomb and ball.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Carnage' (so Wordsworth tells you) 'is God's daughter:'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If he speak truth, she is Christ's sister, and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Prince de Ligne was wounded in the knee;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Count Chapeau-Bras, too, had a ball between<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His cap and head, which proves the head to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aristocratic as was ever seen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because it then received no injury<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More than the cap; in fact, the ball could mean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No harm unto a right legitimate head:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Ashes to ashes'--why not lead to lead?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also the General Markow, Brigadier,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insisting on removal of the prince<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst some groaning thousands dying near,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All common fellows, who might writhe and wince,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And shriek for water into a deaf ear,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The General Markow, who could thus evince<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His sympathy for rank, by the same token,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To teach him greater, had his own leg broken.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Three hundred cannon threw up their emetic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thirty thousand muskets flung their pills<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like hail, to make a bloody diuretic.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mortality! thou hast thy monthly bills;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thy plagues, thy famines, thy physicians, yet tick,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like the death-watch, within our ears the ills<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Past, present, and to come;--but all may yield<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the true portrait of one battle-field.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There the still varying pangs, which multiply<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until their very number makes men hard<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By the infinities of agony,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which meet the gaze whate'er it may regard--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The groan, the roll in dust, the all-white eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turn'd back within its socket,--these reward<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your rank and file by thousands, while the rest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May win perhaps a riband at the breast!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I love glory;--glory's a great thing:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Think what it is to be in your old age<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Maintain'd at the expense of your good king:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A moderate pension shakes full many a sage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And heroes are but made for bards to sing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is still better; thus in verse to wage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your wars eternally, besides enjoying<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Half-pay for life, make mankind worth destroying.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The troops, already disembark'd, push'd on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To take a battery on the right; the others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who landed lower down, their landing done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had set to work as briskly as their brothers:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Being grenadiers, they mounted one by one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cheerful as children climb the breasts of mothers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'er the entrenchment and the palisade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quite orderly, as if upon parade.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And this was admirable; for so hot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fire was, that were red Vesuvius loaded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides its lava, with all sorts of shot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shells or hells, it could not more have goaded.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of officers a third fell on the spot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing which victory by no means boded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To gentlemen engaged in the assault:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hounds, when the huntsman tumbles, are at fault.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here I leave the general concern,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To track our hero on his path of fame:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He must his laurels separately earn;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For fifty thousand heroes, name by name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though all deserving equally to turn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A couplet, or an elegy to claim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would form a lengthy lexicon of glory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And what is worse still, a much longer story:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore we must give the greater number<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the Gazette--which doubtless fairly dealt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By the deceased, who lie in famous slumber<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In ditches, fields, or wheresoe'er they felt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their clay for the last time their souls encumber;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thrice happy he whose name has been well spelt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the despatch: I knew a man whose loss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was printed Grove, although his name was Grose.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan and Johnson join'd a certain corps,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fought away with might and main, not knowing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The way which they had never trod before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And still less guessing where they might be going;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But on they march'd, dead bodies trampling o'er,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Firing, and thrusting, slashing, sweating, glowing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But fighting thoughtlessly enough to win,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To their two selves, one whole bright bulletin.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus on they wallow'd in the bloody mire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of dead and dying thousands,--sometimes gaining<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A yard or two of ground, which brought them nigher<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To some odd angle for which all were straining;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At other times, repulsed by the close fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which really pour'd as if all hell were raining<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of heaven, they stumbled backwards o'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A wounded comrade, sprawling in his gore.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though 't was Don Juan's first of fields, and though<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The nightly muster and the silent march<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the chill dark, when courage does not glow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So much as under a triumphal arch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps might make him shiver, yawn, or throw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A glance on the dull clouds (as thick as starch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which stiffen'd heaven) as if he wish'd for day;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet for all this he did not run away.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed he could not. But what if he had?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There have been and are heroes who begun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With something not much better, or as bad:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Frederic the Great from Molwitz deign'd to run,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the first and last time; for, like a pad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or hawk, or bride, most mortals after one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Warm bout are broken into their new tricks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fight like fiends for pay or politics.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was what Erin calls, in her sublime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Old Erse or Irish, or it may be Punic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (The antiquarians who can settle time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which settles all things, Roman, Greek, or Runic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Swear that Pat's language sprung from the same clime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With Hannibal, and wears the Tyrian tunic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Dido's alphabet; and this is rational<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As any other notion, and not national);--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan was quite 'a broth of a boy,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing of impulse and a child of song;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now swimming in the sentiment of joy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or the sensation (if that phrase seem wrong),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And afterward, if he must needs destroy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In such good company as always throng<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To battles, sieges, and that kind of pleasure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No less delighted to employ his leisure;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But always without malice: if he warr'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or loved, it was with what we call 'the best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Intentions,' which form all mankind's trump card,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be produced when brought up to the test.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The statesman, hero, harlot, lawyer--ward<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Off each attack, when people are in quest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of their designs, by saying they meant well;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is pity 'that such meaning should pave hell.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I almost lately have begun to doubt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether hell's pavement--if it be so paved--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must not have latterly been quite worn out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not by the numbers good intent hath saved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But by the mass who go below without<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those ancient good intentions, which once shaved<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And smooth'd the brimstone of that street of hell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which bears the greatest likeness to Pall Mall.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, by some strange chance, which oft divides<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Warrior from warrior in their grim career,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like chastest wives from constant husbands' sides<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just at the close of the first bridal year,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By one of those odd turns of Fortune's tides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was on a sudden rather puzzled here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When, after a good deal of heavy firing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He found himself alone, and friends retiring.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know how the thing occurr'd--it might<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be that the greater part were kill'd or wounded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that the rest had faced unto the right<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About; a circumstance which has confounded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Caesar himself, who, in the very sight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his whole army, which so much abounded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In courage, was obliged to snatch a shield,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And rally back his Romans to the field.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, who had no shield to snatch, and was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No Caesar, but a fine young lad, who fought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He knew not why, arriving at this pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stopp'd for a minute, as perhaps he ought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For a much longer time; then, like an as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Start not, kind reader; since great Homer thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This simile enough for Ajax, Juan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps may find it better than a new one)--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then, like an ass, he went upon his way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, what was stranger, never look'd behind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But seeing, flashing forward, like the day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over the hills, a fire enough to blind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those who dislike to look upon a fray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He stumbled on, to try if he could find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A path, to add his own slight arm and forces<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To corps, the greater part of which were corses.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perceiving then no more the commandant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his own corps, nor even the corps, which had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quite disappear'd--the gods know howl (I can't<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Account for every thing which may look bad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In history; but we at least may grant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was not marvellous that a mere lad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In search of glory, should look on before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor care a pinch of snuff about his corps):--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perceiving nor commander nor commanded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And left at large, like a young heir, to make<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His way to--where he knew not--single handed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As travellers follow over bog and brake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An 'ignis fatuus;' or as sailors stranded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the nearest hut themselves betake;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So Juan, following honour and his nose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rush'd where the thickest fire announced most foes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He knew not where he was, nor greatly cared,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he was dizzy, busy, and his veins<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fill'd as with lightning--for his spirit shared<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hour, as is the case with lively brains;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And where the hottest fire was seen and heard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the loud cannon peal'd his hoarsest strains,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He rush'd, while earth and air were sadly shaken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By thy humane discovery, Friar Bacon!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as he rush'd along, it came to pass he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fell in with what was late the second column,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the orders of the General Lascy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now reduced, as is a bulky volume<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into an elegant extract (much less massy)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of heroism, and took his place with solemn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Air 'midst the rest, who kept their valiant faces<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And levell'd weapons still against the glacis.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just at this crisis up came Johnson too,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who had 'retreated,' as the phrase is when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men run away much rather than go through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Destruction's jaws into the devil's den;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Johnson was a clever fellow, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Knew when and how 'to cut and come again,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And never ran away, except when running<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was nothing but a valorous kind of cunning.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so, when all his corps were dead or dying,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except Don Juan, a mere novice, whose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More virgin valour never dreamt of flying<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From ignorance of danger, which indues<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its votaries, like innocence relying<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On its own strength, with careless nerves and thews,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Johnson retired a little, just to rally<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those who catch cold in'shadows of Death's valley.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And there, a little shelter'd from the shot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which rain'd from bastion, battery, parapet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rampart, wall, casement, house,--for there was not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this extensive city, sore beset<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By Christian soldiery, a single spot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which did not combat like the devil, as yet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He found a number of Chasseurs, all scatter'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By the resistance of the chase they batter'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And these he call'd on; and, what's strange, they came<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto his call, unlike 'the spirits from<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The vasty deep,' to whom you may exclaim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Says Hotspur, long ere they will leave their home.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their reasons were uncertainty, or shame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At shrinking from a bullet or a bomb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that odd impulse, which in wars or creeds<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Makes men, like cattle, follow him who leads.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By Jove! he was a noble fellow, Johnson,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though his name, than Ajax or Achilles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sounds less harmonious, underneath the sun soon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We shall not see his likeness: he could kill his<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Man quite as quietly as blows the monsoon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her steady breath (which some months the same still is):<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seldom he varied feature, hue, or muscle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And could be very busy without bustle;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, when he ran away, he did so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon reflection, knowing that behind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He would find others who would fain be rid so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of idle apprehensions, which like wind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Trouble heroic stomachs. Though their lids so<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oft are soon closed, all heroes are not blind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But when they light upon immediate death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Retire a little, merely to take breath.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Johnson only ran off, to return<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With many other warriors, as we said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unto that rather somewhat misty bourn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which Hamlet tells us is a pass of dread.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To Jack howe'er this gave but slight concern:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His soul (like galvanism upon the dead)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Acted upon the living as on wire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And led them back into the heaviest fire.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Egad! they found the second time what they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first time thought quite terrible enough<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To fly from, malgre all which people say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of glory, and all that immortal stuff<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which fills a regiment (besides their pay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That daily shilling which makes warriors tough)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They found on their return the self-same welcome,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which made some think, and others know, a hell come.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They fell as thick as harvests beneath hail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grass before scythes, or corn below the sickle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Proving that trite old truth, that life's as frail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any other boon for which men stickle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Turkish batteries thrash'd them like a flail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or a good boxer, into a sad pickle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Putting the very bravest, who were knock'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the head, before their guns were cock'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Turks, behind the traverses and flanks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the next bastion, fired away like devils,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And swept, as gales sweep foam away, whole ranks:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, Heaven knows how, the Fate who levels<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Towns, nations, worlds, in her revolving pranks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So order'd it, amidst these sulphury revels,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That Johnson and some few who had not scamper'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reach'd the interior talus of the rampart.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; First one or two, then five, six, and a dozen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Came mounting quickly up, for it was now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All neck or nothing, as, like pitch or rosin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flame was shower'd forth above, as well's below,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that you scarce could say who best had chosen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gentlemen that were the first to show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their martial faces on the parapet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or those who thought it brave to wait as yet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But those who scaled, found out that their advance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was favour'd by an accident or blunder:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Greek or Turkish Cohorn's ignorance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had palisado'd in a way you 'd wonder<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To see in forts of Netherlands or France<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Though these to our Gibraltar must knock under)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Right in the middle of the parapet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just named, these palisades were primly set:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that on either side some nine or ten<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Paces were left, whereon you could contrive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To march; a great convenience to our men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least to all those who were left alive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who thus could form a line and fight again;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that which farther aided them to strive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was, that they could kick down the palisades,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which scarcely rose much higher than grass blades.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Among the first,--I will not say the first,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For such precedence upon such occasions<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will oftentimes make deadly quarrels burst<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out between friends as well as allied nations:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Briton must be bold who really durst<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Put to such trial John Bull's partial patience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As say that Wellington at Waterloo<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was beaten--though the Prussians say so too;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that if Blucher, Bulow, Gneisenau,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And God knows who besides in 'au' and 'ow,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had not come up in time to cast an awe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the hearts of those who fought till now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As tigers combat with an empty craw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Duke of Wellington had ceased to show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His orders, also to receive his pensions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which are the heaviest that our history mentions.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But never mind;--'God save the king!' and kings!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For if he don't, I doubt if men will longer--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think I hear a little bird, who sings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The people by and by will be the stronger:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The veriest jade will wince whose harness wrings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So much into the raw as quite to wrong her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond the rules of posting,--and the mob<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At last fall sick of imitating Job.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At first it grumbles, then it swears, and then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like David, flings smooth pebbles 'gainst a giant;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At last it takes to weapons such as men<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Snatch when despair makes human hearts less pliant.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then comes 'the tug of war;'--'t will come again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I rather doubt; and I would fain say 'fie on 't,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If I had not perceived that revolution<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alone can save the earth from hell's pollution.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to continue:--I say not the first,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But of the first, our little friend Don Juan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Walk'd o'er the walls of Ismail, as if nursed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst such scenes--though this was quite a new one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To him, and I should hope to most. The thirst<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of glory, which so pierces through and through one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pervaded him--although a generous creature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As warm in heart as feminine in feature.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And here he was--who upon woman's breast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even from a child, felt like a child; howe'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The man in all the rest might be confest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To him it was Elysium to be there;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And he could even withstand that awkward test<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which Rousseau points out to the dubious fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Observe your lover when he leaves your arms;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan never left them, while they had charms,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless compell'd by fate, or wave, or wind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or near relations, who are much the same.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here he was!--where each tie that can bind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Humanity must yield to steel and flame:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And he whose very body was all mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Flung here by fate or circumstance, which tame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The loftiest, hurried by the time and place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dash'd on like a spurr'd blood-horse in a race.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So was his blood stirr'd while he found resistance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As is the hunter's at the five-bar gate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or double post and rail, where the existence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Britain's youth depends upon their weight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lightest being the safest: at a distance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He hated cruelty, as all men hate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Blood, until heated--and even then his own<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At times would curdle o'er some heavy groan.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The General Lascy, who had been hard press'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing arrive an aid so opportune<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As were some hundred youngsters all abreast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who came as if just dropp'd down from the moon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To Juan, who was nearest him, address'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His thanks, and hopes to take the city soon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not reckoning him to be a 'base Bezonian'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (As Pistol calls it), but a young Livonian.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, to whom he spoke in German, knew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As much of German as of Sanscrit, and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In answer made an inclination to<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The general who held him in command;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For seeing one with ribands, black and blue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stars, medals, and a bloody sword in hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Addressing him in tones which seem'd to thank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He recognised an officer of rank.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Short speeches pass between two men who speak<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No common language; and besides, in time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of war and taking towns, when many a shriek<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rings o'er the dialogue, and many a crime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is perpetrated ere a word can break<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the ear, and sounds of horror chime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In like church-bells, with sigh, howl, groan, yell, prayer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There cannot be much conversation there.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore all we have related in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two long octaves, pass'd in a little minute;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in the same small minute, every sin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contrived to get itself comprised within it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very cannon, deafen'd by the din,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grew dumb, for you might almost hear a linnet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as thunder, 'midst the general noise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of human nature's agonising voice!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The town was enter'd. Oh eternity!--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'God made the country and man made the town,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So Cowper says--and I begin to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his opinion, when I see cast down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rome, Babylon, Tyre, Carthage, Nineveh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All walls men know, and many never known;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And pondering on the present and the past,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To deem the woods shall be our home at last<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all men, saving Sylla the man-slayer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who passes for in life and death most lucky,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the great names which in our faces stare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The General Boon, back-woodsman of Kentucky,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was happiest amongst mortals anywhere;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For killing nothing but a bear or buck, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Enjoy'd the lonely, vigorous, harmless days<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of his old age in wilds of deepest maze.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Crime came not near him--she is not the child<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of solitude; Health shrank not from him--for<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her home is in the rarely trodden wild,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where if men seek her not, and death be more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their choice than life, forgive them, as beguiled<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By habit to what their own hearts abhor--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In cities caged. The present case in point I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Cite is, that Boon lived hunting up to ninety;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And what's still stranger, left behind a name<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which men vainly decimate the throng,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not only famous, but of that good fame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without which glory's but a tavern song--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Simple, serene, the antipodes of shame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which hate nor envy e'er could tinge with wrong;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An active hermit, even in age the child<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Nature, or the man of Ross run wild.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is true he shrank from men even of his nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they built up unto his darling trees,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He moved some hundred miles off, for a station<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where there were fewer houses and more ease;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The inconvenience of civilisation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is, that you neither can be pleased nor please;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But where he met the individual man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He show'd himself as kind as mortal can.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was not all alone: around him grew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sylvan tribe of children of the chase,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose young, unwaken'd world was ever new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor sword nor sorrow yet had left a trace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On her unwrinkled brow, nor could you view<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A frown on Nature's or on human face;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The free-born forest found and kept them free,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because their thoughts had never been the prey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of care or gain: the green woods were their portions;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No sinking spirits told them they grew grey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No fashion made them apes of her distortions;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Simple they were, not savage; and their rifles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though very true, were not yet used for trifles.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Motion was in their days, rest in their slumbers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cheerfulness the handmaid of their toil;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor yet too many nor too few their numbers;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corruption could not make their hearts her soil;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lust which stings, the splendour which encumbers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the free foresters divide no spoil;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Serene, not sullen, were the solitudes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of this unsighing people of the woods.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So much for Nature:--by way of variety,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now back to thy great joys, Civilisation!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the sweet consequence of large society,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; War, pestilence, the despot's desolation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The kingly scourge, the lust of notoriety,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The millions slain by soldiers for their ration,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The scenes like Catherine's boudoir at threescore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Ismail's storm to soften it the more.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The town was enter'd: first one column made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its sanguinary way good--then another;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The reeking bayonet and the flashing blade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clash'd 'gainst the scimitar, and babe and mother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With distant shrieks were heard Heaven to upbraid:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still closer sulphury clouds began to smother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The breath of morn and man, where foot by foot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The madden'd Turks their city still dispute.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Koutousow, he who afterward beat back<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (With some assistance from the frost and snow)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Napoleon on his bold and bloody track,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It happen'd was himself beat back just now;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a jolly fellow, and could crack<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His jest alike in face of friend or foe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though life, and death, and victory were at stake;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here it seem'd his jokes had ceased to take:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For having thrown himself into a ditch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Follow'd in haste by various grenadiers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose blood the puddle greatly did enrich,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He climb'd to where the parapet appears;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But there his project reach'd its utmost pitch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ('Mongst other deaths the General Ribaupierre's<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was much regretted), for the Moslem men<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Threw them all down into the ditch again.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And had it not been for some stray troops landing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They knew not where, being carried by the stream<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To some spot, where they lost their understanding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wander'd up and down as in a dream,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until they reach'd, as daybreak was expanding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That which a portal to their eyes did seem,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The great and gay Koutousow might have lain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where three parts of his column yet remain.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And scrambling round the rampart, these same troops,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the taking of the 'Cavalier,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as Koutousow's most 'forlorn' of 'hopes'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Took like chameleons some slight tinge of fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open'd the gate call'd 'Kilia,' to the groups<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of baffled heroes, who stood shyly near,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sliding knee-deep in lately frozen mud,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now thaw'd into a marsh of human blood.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Kozacks, or, if so you please, Cossacques<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (I don't much pique myself upon orthography,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that I do not grossly err in facts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Statistics, tactics, politics, and geography)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Having been used to serve on horses' backs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And no great dilettanti in topography<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of fortresses, but fighting where it pleases<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their chiefs to order,--were all cut to pieces.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their column, though the Turkish batteries thunder'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon them, ne'ertheless had reach'd the rampart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And naturally thought they could have plunder'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The city, without being farther hamper'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as it happens to brave men, they blunder'd--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Turks at first pretended to have scamper'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Only to draw them 'twixt two bastion corners,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From whence they sallied on those Christian scorners.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then being taken by the tail--a taking<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fatal to bishops as to soldiers--these<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Cossacques were all cut off as day was breaking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And found their lives were let at a short lease--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But perish'd without shivering or shaking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leaving as ladders their heap'd carcasses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'er which Lieutenant-Colonel Yesouskoi<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; March'd with the brave battalion of Polouzki:--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This valiant man kill'd all the Turks he met,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But could not eat them, being in his turn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Slain by some Mussulmans, who would not yet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without resistance, see their city burn.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The walls were won, but 't was an even bet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which of the armies would have cause to mourn:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was blow for blow, disputing inch by inch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For one would not retreat, nor t' other flinch.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another column also suffer'd much:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here we may remark with the historian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You should but give few cartridges to such<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Troops as are meant to march with greatest glory on:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When matters must be carried by the touch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the bright bayonet, and they all should hurry on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They sometimes, with a hankering for existence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Keep merely firing at a foolish distance.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A junction of the General Meknop's men<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Without the General, who had fallen some time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before, being badly seconded just then)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was made at length with those who dared to climb<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The death-disgorging rampart once again;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though the Turk's resistance was sublime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They took the bastion, which the Seraskier<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Defended at a price extremely dear.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan and Johnson, and some volunteers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Among the foremost, offer'd him good quarter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A word which little suits with Seraskiers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or at least suited not this valiant Tartar.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He died, deserving well his country's tears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A savage sort of military martyr.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An English naval officer, who wish'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To make him prisoner, was also dish'd:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For all the answer to his proposition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was from a pistol-shot that laid him dead;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On which the rest, without more intermission,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Began to lay about with steel and lead--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The pious metals most in requisition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On such occasions: not a single head<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was spared;--three thousand Moslems perish'd here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And sixteen bayonets pierced the Seraskier.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The city's taken--only part by part--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And death is drunk with gore: there's not a street<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where fights not to the last some desperate heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For those for whom it soon shall cease to beat.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here War forgot his own destructive art<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In more destroying Nature; and the heat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of carnage, like the Nile's sun-sodden slime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Engender'd monstrous shapes of every crime.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A Russian officer, in martial tread<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over a heap of bodies, felt his heel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seized fast, as if 't were by the serpent's head<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose fangs Eve taught her human seed to feel:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In vain he kick'd, and swore, and writhed, and bled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And howl'd for help as wolves do for a meal--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The teeth still kept their gratifying hold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As do the subtle snakes described of old.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A dying Moslem, who had felt the foot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of a foe o'er him, snatch'd at it, and bit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very tendon which is most acute<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (That which some ancient Muse or modern wit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Named after thee, Achilles), and quite through 't<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He made the teeth meet, nor relinquish'd it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even with his life--for (but they lie) 't is said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the live leg still clung the sever'd head.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However this may be, 't is pretty sure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Russian officer for life was lamed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the Turk's teeth stuck faster than a skewer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And left him 'midst the invalid and maim'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The regimental surgeon could not cure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His patient, and perhaps was to be blamed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More than the head of the inveterate foe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which was cut off, and scarce even then let go.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then the fact's a fact--and 't is the part<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of a true poet to escape from fiction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whene'er he can; for there is little art<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In leaving verse more free from the restriction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of truth than prose, unless to suit the mart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For what is sometimes called poetic diction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that outrageous appetite for lies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which Satan angles with for souls, like flies.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The city's taken, but not render'd!--No!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's not a Moslem that hath yielded sword:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The blood may gush out, as the Danube's flow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rolls by the city wall; but deed nor word<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Acknowledge aught of dread of death or foe:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In vain the yell of victory is roar'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By the advancing Muscovite--the groan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the last foe is echoed by his own.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The bayonet pierces and the sabre cleaves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And human lives are lavish'd everywhere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the year closing whirls the scarlet leaves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When the stripp'd forest bows to the bleak air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And groans; and thus the peopled city grieves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shorn of its best and loveliest, and left bare;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still it falls in vast and awful splinters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As oaks blown down with all their thousand winters.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is an awful topic--but 't is not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My cue for any time to be terrific:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For checker'd as is seen our human lot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With good, and bad, and worse, alike prolific<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of melancholy merriment, to quote<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Too much of one sort would be soporific;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without, or with, offence to friends or foes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I sketch your world exactly as it goes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And one good action in the midst of crimes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is 'quite refreshing,' in the affected phrase<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of these ambrosial, Pharisaic times,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all their pretty milk-and-water ways,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And may serve therefore to bedew these rhymes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little scorch'd at present with the blaze<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of conquest and its consequences, which<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Make epic poesy so rare and rich.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon a taken bastion, where there lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thousands of slaughter'd men, a yet warm group<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of murder'd women, who had found their way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To this vain refuge, made the good heart droop<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And shudder;--while, as beautiful as May,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A female child of ten years tried to stoop<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hide her little palpitating breast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst the bodies lull'd in bloody rest.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two villainous Cossacques pursued the child<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With flashing eyes and weapons: match'd with them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rudest brute that roams Siberia's wild<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has feelings pure and polish'd as a gem,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The bear is civilised, the wolf is mild;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And whom for this at last must we condemn?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their natures? or their sovereigns, who employ<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All arts to teach their subjects to destroy?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their sabres glitter'd o'er her little head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whence her fair hair rose twining with affright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her hidden face was plunged amidst the dead:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Juan caught a glimpse of this sad sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I shall not say exactly what he said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because it might not solace 'ears polite;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what he did, was to lay on their backs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The readiest way of reasoning with Cossacques.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One's hip he slash'd, and split the other's shoulder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And drove them with their brutal yells to seek<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If there might be chirurgeons who could solder<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wounds they richly merited, and shriek<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their baffled rage and pain; while waxing colder<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he turn'd o'er each pale and gory cheek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan raised his little captive from<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The heap a moment more had made her tomb.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And she was chill as they, and on her face<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A slender streak of blood announced how near<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her fate had been to that of all her race;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the same blow which laid her mother here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had scarr'd her brow, and left its crimson trace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the last link with all she had held dear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But else unhurt, she open'd her large eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And gazed on Juan with a wild surprise.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just at this instant, while their eyes were fix'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon each other, with dilated glance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Juan's look, pain, pleasure, hope, fear, mix'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With joy to save, and dread of some mischance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unto his protege; while hers, transfix'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With infant terrors, glared as from a trance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A pure, transparent, pale, yet radiant face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like to a lighted alabaster vase;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Up came John Johnson (I will not say 'Jack,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that were vulgar, cold, and commonplace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On great occasions, such as an attack<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On cities, as hath been the present case):<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Up Johnson came, with hundreds at his back,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exclaiming;--'Juan! Juan! On, boy! brace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your arm, and I 'll bet Moscow to a dollar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That you and I will win St. George's collar.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'The Seraskier is knock'd upon the head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the stone bastion still remains, wherein<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The old Pacha sits among some hundreds dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Smoking his pipe quite calmly 'midst the din<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of our artillery and his own: 't is said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our kill'd, already piled up to the chin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lie round the battery; but still it batters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And grape in volleys, like a vineyard, scatters.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Then up with me!'--But Juan answer'd, 'Look<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon this child--I saved her--must not leave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her life to chance; but point me out some nook<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of safety, where she less may shrink and grieve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I am with you.'--Whereon Johnson took<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A glance around--and shrugg'd--and twitch'd his sleeve<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And black silk neckcloth--and replied, 'You 're right;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Poor thing! what's to be done? I 'm puzzled quite.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Said Juan: 'Whatsoever is to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Done, I 'll not quit her till she seems secure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of present life a good deal more than we.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quoth Johnson: 'Neither will I quite ensure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But at the least you may die gloriously.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan replied: 'At least I will endure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er is to be borne--but not resign<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This child, who is parentless, and therefore mine.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Johnson said: 'Juan, we 've no time to lose;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The child's a pretty child--a very pretty--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I never saw such eyes--but hark! now choose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between your fame and feelings, pride and pity;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hark! how the roar increases!--no excuse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will serve when there is plunder in a city;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I should be loth to march without you, but,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By God! we 'll be too late for the first cut.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan was immovable; until<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Johnson, who really loved him in his way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pick'd out amongst his followers with some skill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as he thought the least given up to prey;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And swearing if the infant came to ill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That they should all be shot on the next day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But if she were deliver'd safe and sound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They should at least have fifty rubles round,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all allowances besides of plunder<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fair proportion with their comrades;--then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan consented to march on through thunder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which thinn'd at every step their ranks of men:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet the rest rush'd eagerly--no wonder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For they were heated by the hope of gain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A thing which happens everywhere each day--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No hero trusteth wholly to half pay.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And such is victory, and such is man!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least nine tenths of what we call so;--God<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May have another name for half we scan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As human beings, or his ways are odd.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to our subject: a brave Tartar khan--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or'sultan,' as the author (to whose nod<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In prose I bend my humble verse) doth call<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This chieftain--somehow would not yield at all:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But flank'd by five brave sons (such is polygamy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That she spawns warriors by the score, where none<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are prosecuted for that false crime bigamy),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He never would believe the city won<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While courage clung but to a single twig.--Am I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Describing Priam's, Peleus', or Jove's son?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Neither--but a good, plain, old, temperate man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who fought with his five children in the van.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To take him was the point. The truly brave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When they behold the brave oppress'd with odds,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are touch'd with a desire to shield and save;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A mixture of wild beasts and demigods<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are they--now furious as the sweeping wave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now moved with pity: even as sometimes nods<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rugged tree unto the summer wind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Compassion breathes along the savage mind.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But he would not be taken, and replied<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To all the propositions of surrender<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By mowing Christians down on every side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As obstinate as Swedish Charles at Bender.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His five brave boys no less the foe defied;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whereon the Russian pathos grew less tender,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As being a virtue, like terrestrial patience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Apt to wear out on trifling provocations.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And spite of Johnson and of Juan, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Expended all their Eastern phraseology<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In begging him, for God's sake, just to show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So much less fight as might form an apology<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For them in saving such a desperate foe--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He hew'd away, like doctors of theology<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When they dispute with sceptics; and with curses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Struck at his friends, as babies beat their nurses.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nay, he had wounded, though but slightly, both<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan and Johnson; whereupon they fell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first with sighs, the second with an oath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon his angry sultanship, pell-mell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all around were grown exceeding wroth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At such a pertinacious infidel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And pour'd upon him and his sons like rain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which they resisted like a sandy plain<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That drinks and still is dry. At last they perish'd--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His second son was levell'd by a shot;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His third was sabred; and the fourth, most cherish'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the five, on bayonets met his lot;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fifth, who, by a Christian mother nourish'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had been neglected, ill-used, and what not,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because deform'd, yet died all game and bottom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To save a sire who blush'd that he begot him.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The eldest was a true and tameless Tartar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As great a scorner of the Nazarene<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As ever Mahomet pick'd out for a martyr,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who only saw the black-eyed girls in green,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who make the beds of those who won't take quarter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On earth, in Paradise; and when once seen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those houris, like all other pretty creatures,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Do just whate'er they please, by dint of features.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And what they pleased to do with the young khan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In heaven I know not, nor pretend to guess;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But doubtless they prefer a fine young man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tough old heroes, and can do no less;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that's the cause no doubt why, if we scan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A field of battle's ghastly wilderness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For one rough, weather-beaten, veteran body,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 'll find ten thousand handsome coxcombs bloody.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your houris also have a natural pleasure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In lopping off your lately married men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before the bridal hours have danced their measure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the sad, second moon grows dim again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or dull repentance hath had dreary leisure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To wish him back a bachelor now and then.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus your houri (it may be) disputes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of these brief blossoms the immediate fruits.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the young khan, with houris in his sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thought not upon the charms of four young brides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But bravely rush'd on his first heavenly night.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In short, howe'er our better faith derides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These black-eyed virgins make the Moslems fight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As though there were one heaven and none besides,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whereas, if all be true we hear of heaven<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hell, there must at least be six or seven.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So fully flash'd the phantom on his eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That when the very lance was in his heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He shouted 'Allah!' and saw Paradise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all its veil of mystery drawn apart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And bright eternity without disguise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On his soul, like a ceaseless sunrise, dart:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With prophets, houris, angels, saints, descried<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In one voluptuous blaze,--and then he died,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But with a heavenly rapture on his face.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The good old khan, who long had ceased to see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Houris, or aught except his florid race<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who grew like cedars round him gloriously--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When he beheld his latest hero grace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The earth, which he became like a fell'd tree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Paused for a moment, from the fight, and cast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A glance on that slain son, his first and last.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The soldiers, who beheld him drop his point,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stopp'd as if once more willing to concede<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quarter, in case he bade them not 'aroynt!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As he before had done. He did not heed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their pause nor signs: his heart was out of joint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shook (till now unshaken) like a reed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As he look'd down upon his children gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And felt--though done with life--he was alone<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But 't was a transient tremor;--with a spring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the Russian steel his breast he flung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As carelessly as hurls the moth her wing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against the light wherein she dies: he clung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Closer, that all the deadlier they might wring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the bayonets which had pierced his young;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And throwing back a dim look on his sons,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In one wide wound pour'd forth his soul at once.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is strange enough--the rough, tough soldiers, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spared neither sex nor age in their career<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of carnage, when this old man was pierced through,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lay before them with his children near,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Touch'd by the heroism of him they slew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were melted for a moment: though no tear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Flow'd from their bloodshot eyes, all red with strife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They honour'd such determined scorn of life.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the stone bastion still kept up its fire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the chief pacha calmly held his post:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some twenty times he made the Russ retire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And baffled the assaults of all their host;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At length he condescended to inquire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If yet the city's rest were won or lost;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And being told the latter, sent a bey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To answer Ribas' summons to give way.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the mean time, cross-legg'd, with great sang-froid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Among the scorching ruins he sat smoking<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tobacco on a little carpet;--Troy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saw nothing like the scene around:--yet looking<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With martial stoicism, nought seem'd to annoy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His stern philosophy; but gently stroking<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His beard, he puff'd his pipe's ambrosial gales,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if he had three lives, as well as tails.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The town was taken--whether he might yield<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Himself or bastion, little matter'd now:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His stubborn valour was no future shield.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ismail's no more! The crescent's silver bow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sunk, and the crimson cross glared o'er the field,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But red with no redeeming gore: the glow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of burning streets, like moonlight on the water,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was imaged back in blood, the sea of slaughter.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All that the mind would shrink from of excesses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All that the body perpetrates of bad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All that we read, hear, dream, of man's distresses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All that the devil would do if run stark mad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All that defies the worst which pen expresses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All by which hell is peopled, or as sad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As hell--mere mortals who their power abuse--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was here (as heretofore and since) let loose.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If here and there some transient trait of pity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was shown, and some more noble heart broke through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its bloody bond, and saved perhaps some pretty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Child, or an aged, helpless man or two--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What's this in one annihilated city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where thousand loves, and ties, and duties grew?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Cockneys of London! Muscadins of Paris!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just ponder what a pious pastime war is.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Think how the joys of reading a Gazette<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are purchased by all agonies and crimes:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or if these do not move you, don't forget<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such doom may be your own in aftertimes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime the Taxes, Castlereagh, and Debt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are hints as good as sermons, or as rhymes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Read your own hearts and Ireland's present story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then feed her famine fat with Wellesley's glory.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still there is unto a patriot nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which loves so well its country and its king,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A subject of sublimest exultation--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bear it, ye Muses, on your brightest wing!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Howe'er the mighty locust, Desolation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strip your green fields, and to your harvests cling,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gaunt famine never shall approach the throne--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though Ireland starve, great George weighs twenty stone.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But let me put an end unto my theme:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was an end of Ismail--hapless town!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Far flash'd her burning towers o'er Danube's stream,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And redly ran his blushing waters down.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The horrid war-whoop and the shriller scream<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rose still; but fainter were the thunders grown:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of forty thousand who had mann'd the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some hundreds breathed--the rest were silent all!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In one thing ne'ertheless 't is fit to praise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Russian army upon this occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A virtue much in fashion now-a-days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore worthy of commemoration:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The topic's tender, so shall be my phrase--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the season's chill, and their long station<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In winter's depth, or want of rest and victual,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had made them chaste;--they ravish'd very little.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Much did they slay, more plunder, and no less<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Might here and there occur some violation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the other line;--but not to such excess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As when the French, that dissipated nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Take towns by storm: no causes can I guess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except cold weather and commiseration;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But all the ladies, save some twenty score,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were almost as much virgins as before.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some odd mistakes, too, happen'd in the dark,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which show'd a want of lanterns, or of taste--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed the smoke was such they scarce could mark<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their friends from foes,--besides such things from haste<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Occur, though rarely, when there is a spark<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of light to save the venerably chaste:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But six old damsels, each of seventy years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were all deflower'd by different grenadiers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But on the whole their continence was great;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that some disappointment there ensued<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To those who had felt the inconvenient state<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of'single blessedness,' and thought it good<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Since it was not their fault, but only fate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bear these crosses) for each waning prude<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To make a Roman sort of Sabine wedding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without the expense and the suspense of bedding.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some voices of the buxom middle-aged<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were also heard to wonder in the din<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Widows of forty were these birds long caged)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Wherefore the ravishing did not begin!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But while the thirst for gore and plunder raged,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was small leisure for superfluous sin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But whether they escaped or no, lies hid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In darkness--I can only hope they did.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suwarrow now was conqueror--a match<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Timour or for Zinghis in his trade.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While mosques and streets, beneath his eyes, like thatch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blazed, and the cannon's roar was scarce allay'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With bloody hands he wrote his first despatch;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here exactly follows what he said:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Glory to God and to the Empress!' (Powers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Eternal! such names mingled!) 'Ismail's ours.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Methinks these are the most tremendous words,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since 'Mene, Mene, Tekel,' and 'Upharsin,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which hands or pens have ever traced of swords.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heaven help me! I 'm but little of a parson:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What Daniel read was short-hand of the Lord's,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Severe, sublime; the prophet wrote no farce on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fate of nations;--but this Russ so witty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could rhyme, like Nero, o'er a burning city.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He wrote this Polar melody, and set it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Duly accompanied by shrieks and groans,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which few will sing, I trust, but none forget it--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I will teach, if possible, the stones<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To rise against earth's tyrants. Never let it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be said that we still truckle unto thrones;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But ye--our children's children! think how we<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Show'd what things were before the world was free!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That hour is not for us, but 't is for you:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as, in the great joy of your millennium,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You hardly will believe such things were true<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As now occur, I thought that I would pen you 'em;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But may their very memory perish too!--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet if perchance remember'd, still disdain you 'em<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More than you scorn the savages of yore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who painted their bare limbs, but not with gore.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when you hear historians talk of thrones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And those that sate upon them, let it be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As we now gaze upon the mammoth's bones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'And wonder what old world such things could see,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or hieroglyphics on Egyptian stones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pleasant riddles of futurity--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Guessing at what shall happily be hid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the real purpose of a pyramid.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reader! I have kept my word,--at least so far<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the first Canto promised. You have now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had sketches of love, tempest, travel, war--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All very accurate, you must allow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And epic, if plain truth should prove no bar;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I have drawn much less with a long bow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than my forerunners. Carelessly I sing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Phoebus lends me now and then a string,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With which I still can harp, and carp, and fiddle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What farther hath befallen or may befall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The hero of this grand poetic riddle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I by and by may tell you, if at all:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now I choose to break off in the middle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Worn out with battering Ismail's stubborn wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While Juan is sent off with the despatch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For which all Petersburgh is on the watch.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This special honour was conferr'd, because<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had behaved with courage and humanity--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which last men like, when they have time to pause<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From their ferocities produced by vanity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His little captive gain'd him some applause<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For saving her amidst the wild insanity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of carnage,--and I think he was more glad in her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Safety, than his new order of St. Vladimir.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Moslem orphan went with her protector,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she was homeless, houseless, helpless; all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her friends, like the sad family of Hector,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had perish'd in the field or by the wall:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her very place of birth was but a spectre<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of what it had been; there the Muezzin's cal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To prayer was heard no more!--and Juan wept,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="aix">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;             CANTO THE NINTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; OH, Wellington! (or 'Villainton'--for Fame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sounds the heroic syllables both ways;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; France could not even conquer your great name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But punn'd it down to this facetious phrase--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beating or beaten she will laugh the same),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have obtain'd great pensions and much praise:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Glory like yours should any dare gainsay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Humanity would rise, and thunder 'Nay!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't think that you used Kinnaird quite well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Marinet's affair--in fact, 't was shabby,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And like some other things won't do to tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon your tomb in Westminster's old abbey.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the rest 't is not worth while to dwell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such tales being for the tea-hours of some tabby;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But though your years as man tend fast to zero,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact your grace is still but a young hero.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though Britain owes (and pays you too) so much,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet Europe doubtless owes you greatly more:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You have repair'd Legitimacy's crutch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A prop not quite so certain as before:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Spanish, and the French, as well as Dutch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have seen, and felt, how strongly you restore;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Waterloo has made the world your debtor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (I wish your bards would sing it rather better).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You are 'the best of cut-throats:'--do not start;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The phrase is Shakspeare's, and not misapplied:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; War's a brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless her cause by right be sanctified.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you have acted once a generous part,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The world, not the world's masters, will decide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I shall be delighted to learn who,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save you and yours, have gain'd by Waterloo?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am no flatterer--you 've supp'd full of flattery:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They say you like it too--'t is no great wonder.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He whose whole life has been assault and battery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At last may get a little tired of thunder;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And swallowing eulogy much more than satire, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May like being praised for every lucky blunder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Call'd'saviour of the Nations'--not yet saved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And 'Europe's Liberator'--still enslaved.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've done. Now go and dine from off the plate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Presented by the Prince of the Brazils,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And send the sentinel before your gate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A slice or two from your luxurious meals:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He fought, but has not fed so well of late.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some hunger, too, they say the people feels:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no doubt that you deserve your ration,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But pray give back a little to the nation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't mean to reflect--a man so great as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You, my lord duke! is far above reflection:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The high Roman fashion, too, of Cincinnatus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With modern history has but small connection:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though as an Irishman you love potatoes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You need not take them under your direction;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And half a million for your Sabine farm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is rather dear!--I 'm sure I mean no harm.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Great men have always scorn'd great recompenses:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Epaminondas saved his Thebes, and died,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not leaving even his funeral expenses:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; George Washington had thanks and nought beside,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Except the all-cloudless glory (which few men's is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To free his country: Pitt too had his pride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as a high-soul'd minister of state is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Renown'd for ruining Great Britain gratis.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Never had mortal man such opportunity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except Napoleon, or abused it more:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You might have freed fallen Europe from the unity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of tyrants, and been blest from shore to shore:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now--what is your fame? Shall the Muse tune it ye?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now--that the rabble's first vain shouts are o'er?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go! hear it in your famish'd country's cries!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Behold the world! and curse your victories!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As these new cantos touch on warlike feats,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To you the unflattering Muse deigns to inscribe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Truths, that you will not read in the Gazettes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But which 't is time to teach the hireling tribe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who fatten on their country's gore, and debts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Must be recited, and--without a bribe.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You did great things; but not being great in mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have left undone the greatest--and mankind.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Death laughs--Go ponder o'er the skeleton<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which men image out the unknown thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That hides the past world, like to a set sun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which still elsewhere may rouse a brighter spring--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Death laughs at all you weep for:--look upon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This hourly dread of all! whose threaten'd sting<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Turns life to terror, even though in its sheath:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mark how its lipless mouth grins without breath!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mark how it laughs and scorns at all you are!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet was what you are: from ear to ear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It laughs not--there is now no fleshy bar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So call'd; the Antic long hath ceased to hear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still he smiles; and whether near or far,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He strips from man that mantle (far more dear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than even the tailor's), his incarnate skin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; White, black, or copper--the dead bones will grin.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus Death laughs,--it is sad merriment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But still it is so; and with such example<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why should not Life be equally content<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With his superior, in a smile to trample<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the nothings which are daily spent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like bubbles on an ocean much less ample<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than the eternal deluge, which devours<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suns as rays--worlds like atoms--years like hours?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'To be, or not to be? that is the question,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Says Shakspeare, who just now is much in fashion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am neither Alexander nor Hephaestion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor ever had for abstract fame much passion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But would much rather have a sound digestion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than Buonaparte's cancer: could I dash on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through fifty victories to shame or fame--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without a stomach what were a good name?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'O dura ilia messorum!'--'Oh<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ye rigid guts of reapers!' I translate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the great benefit of those who know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What indigestion is--that inward fate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which makes all Styx through one small liver flow.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A peasant's sweat is worth his lord's estate:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let this one toil for bread--that rack for rent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He who sleeps best may be the most content.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'To be, or not to be?'--Ere I decide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I should be glad to know that which is being?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is true we speculate both far and wide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And deem, because we see, we are all-seeing:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For my part, I 'll enlist on neither side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until I see both sides for once agreeing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For me, I sometimes think that life is death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rather than life a mere affair of breath.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Que scais-je?' was the motto of Montaigne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As also of the first academicians:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That all is dubious which man may attain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was one of their most favourite positions.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's no such thing as certainty, that's plain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As any of Mortality's conditions;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So little do we know what we 're about in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This world, I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a pleasant voyage perhaps to float,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Pyrrho, on a sea of speculation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what if carrying sail capsize the boat?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your wise men don't know much of navigation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And swimming long in the abyss of thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is apt to tire: a calm and shallow station<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Well nigh the shore, where one stoops down and gathers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some pretty shell, is best for moderate bathers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But heaven,' as Cassio says, 'is above all--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No more of this, then,--let us pray!' We have<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Souls to save, since Eve's slip and Adam's fall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which tumbled all mankind into the grave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides fish, beasts, and birds. 'The sparrow's fall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is special providence,' though how it gave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Offence, we know not; probably it perch'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the tree which Eve so fondly search'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, ye immortal gods! what is theogony?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, thou too, mortal man! what is philanthropy?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, world! which was and is, what is cosmogony?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some people have accused me of misanthropy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet I know no more than the mahogany<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That forms this desk, of what they mean; lykanthropy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I comprehend, for without transformation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men become wolves on any slight occasion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I, the mildest, meekest of mankind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Moses, or Melancthon, who have ne'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Done anything exceedingly unkind,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And (though I could not now and then forbear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Following the bent of body or of mind)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have always had a tendency to spare,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why do they call me misanthrope? Because<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They hate me, not I them.--and here we 'll pause.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is time we should proceed with our good poem,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I maintain that it is really good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not only in the body but the proem,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However little both are understood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just now,--but by and by the Truth will show 'em<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Herself in her sublimest attitude:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And till she doth, I fain must be content<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To share her beauty and her banishment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our hero (and, I trust, kind reader, yours)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was left upon his way to the chief city<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the immortal Peter's polish'd boors<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who still have shown themselves more brave than witty.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I know its mighty empire now allures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Much flattery--even Voltaire's, and that's a pity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For me, I deem an absolute autocrat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not a barbarian, but much worse than that.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I will war, at least in words (and--should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My chance so happen--deeds), with all who war<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Thought;--and of Thought's foes by far most rude,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tyrants and sycophants have been and are.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I know not who may conquer: if I could<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have such a prescience, it should be no bar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To this my plain, sworn, downright detestation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of every depotism in every nation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is not that I adulate the people:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without me, there are demagogues enough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And infidels, to pull down every steeple,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And set up in their stead some proper stuff.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether they may sow scepticism to reap hell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As is the Christian dogma rather rough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I do not know;--I wish men to be free<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As much from mobs as kings--from you as me.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The consequence is, being of no party,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall offend all parties: never mind!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My words, at least, are more sincere and hearty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than if I sought to sail before the wind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He who has nought to gain can have small art: he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who neither wishes to be bound nor bind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May still expatiate freely, as will I,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor give my voice to slavery's jackal cry.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That's an appropriate simile, that jackal;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 've heard them in the Ephesian ruins howl<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By night, as do that mercenary pack all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Power's base purveyors, who for pickings prowl,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And scent the prey their masters would attack all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, the poor jackals are less foul<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (As being the brave lions' keen providers)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than human insects, catering for spiders.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Raise but an arm! 't will brush their web away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And without that, their poison and their claws<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are useless. Mind, good people! what I say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Or rather peoples)--go on without pause!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The web of these tarantulas each day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Increases, till you shall make common cause:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; None, save the Spanish fly and Attic bee,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As yet are strongly stinging to be free.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan, who had shone in the late slaughter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was left upon his way with the despatch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where blood was talk'd of as we would of water;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And carcasses that lay as thick as thatch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'er silenced cities, merely served to flatter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair Catherine's pastime--who look'd on the match<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Between these nations as a main of cocks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wherein she liked her own to stand like rocks.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And there in a kibitka he roll'd on<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (A cursed sort of carriage without springs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which on rough roads leaves scarcely a whole bone),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pondering on glory, chivalry, and kings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And orders, and on all that he had done--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wishing that post-horses had the wings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Pegasus, or at the least post-chaises<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had feathers, when a traveller on deep ways is.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At every jolt--and they were many--still<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He turn'd his eyes upon his little charge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if he wish'd that she should fare less ill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than he, in these sad highways left at large<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To ruts, and flints, and lovely Nature's skill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is no paviour, nor admits a barge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On her canals, where God takes sea and land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fishery and farm, both into his own hand.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At least he pays no rent, and has best right<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be the first of what we used to call<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Gentlemen farmer'--a race worn out quite,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since lately there have been no rents at all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And 'gentlemen' are in a piteous plight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And 'farmers' can't raise Ceres from her fall:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She fell with Buonaparte--What strange thoughts<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arise, when we see emperors fall with oats!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan turn'd his eyes on the sweet child<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom he had saved from slaughter--what a trophy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh! ye who build up monuments, defiled<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With gore, like Nadir Shah, that costive sophy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who, after leaving Hindostan a wild,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And scarce to the Mogul a cup of coffee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To soothe his woes withal, was slain, the sinner!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because he could no more digest his dinner;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh ye! or we! or he! or she! reflect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That one life saved, especially if young<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or pretty, is a thing to recollect<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Far sweeter than the greenest laurels sprung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From the manure of human clay, though deck'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all the praises ever said or sung:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though hymn'd by every harp, unless within<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your heart joins chorus, Fame is but a din.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh! ye great authors luminous, voluminous!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ye twice ten hundred thousand daily scribes!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose pamphlets, volumes, newspapers, illumine us!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether you 're paid by government in bribes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To prove the public debt is not consuming us--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or, roughly treading on the 'courtier's kibes'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With clownish heel, your popular circulation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Feeds you by printing half the realm's starvation;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, ye great authors!--'Apropos des bottes,'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have forgotten what I meant to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As sometimes have been greater sages' lots;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was something calculated to allay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All wrath in barracks, palaces, or cots:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certes it would have been but thrown away,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that's one comfort for my lost advice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although no doubt it was beyond all price.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But let it go:--it will one day be found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With other relics of 'a former world,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When this world shall be former, underground,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thrown topsy-turvy, twisted, crisp'd, and curl'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Baked, fried, or burnt, turn'd inside-out, or drown'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like all the worlds before, which have been hurl'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; First out of, and then back again to chaos,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The superstratum which will overlay us.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So Cuvier says;--and then shall come again<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the new creation, rising out<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From our old crash, some mystic, ancient strain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of things destroy'd and left in airy doubt:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like to the notions we now entertain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Titans, giants, fellows of about<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some hundred feet in height, not to say miles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And mammoths, and your winged crocodiles.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Think if then George the Fourth should be dug up!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How the new worldlings of the then new East<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will wonder where such animals could sup!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (For they themselves will be but of the least:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even worlds miscarry, when too oft they pup,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And every new creation hath decreased<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In size, from overworking the material--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men are but maggots of some huge Earth's burial.)<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How will--to these young people, just thrust out<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From some fresh Paradise, and set to plough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And dig, and sweat, and turn themselves about,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And plant, and reap, and spin, and grind, and sow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till all the arts at length are brought about,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially of war and taxing,--how,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I say, will these great relics, when they see 'em,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Look like the monsters of a new museum?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I am apt to grow too metaphysical:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The time is out of joint,'--and so am I;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I quite forget this poem's merely quizzical,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And deviate into matters rather dry.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I ne'er decide what I shall say, and this I cal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Much too poetical: men should know why<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They write, and for what end; but, note or text,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I never know the word which will come next.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So on I ramble, now and then narrating,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now pondering:--it is time we should narrate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I left Don Juan with his horses baiting--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now we 'll get o'er the ground at a great rate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I shall not be particular in stating<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His journey, we 've so many tours of late:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suppose him then at Petersburgh; suppose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That pleasant capital of painted snows;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suppose him in a handsome uniform,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A scarlet coat, black facings, a long plume,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Waving, like sails new shiver'd in a storm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over a cock'd hat in a crowded room,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And brilliant breeches, bright as a Cairn Gorme,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of yellow casimere we may presume,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; White stocking drawn uncurdled as new milk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'er limbs whose symmetry set off the silk;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suppose him sword by side, and hat in hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made up by youth, fame, and an army tailor--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That great enchanter, at whose rod's command<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beauty springs forth, and Nature's self turns paler,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing how Art can make her work more grand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (When she don't pin men's limbs in like a gaoler),--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Behold him placed as if upon a pillar! He<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seems Love turn'd a lieutenant of artillery:--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His bandage slipp'd down into a cravat;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His wings subdued to epaulettes; his quiver<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shrunk to a scabbard, with his arrows at<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His side as a small sword, but sharp as ever;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His bow converted into a cock'd hat;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But still so like, that Psyche were more clever<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than some wives (who make blunders no less stupid),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If she had not mistaken him for Cupid.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The courtiers stared, the ladies whisper'd, and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The empress smiled: the reigning favourite frown'd--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I quite forget which of them was in hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just then; as they are rather numerous found,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who took by turns that difficult command<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since first her majesty was singly crown'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But they were mostly nervous six-foot fellows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All fit to make a Patagonian jealous.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan was none of these, but slight and slim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blushing and beardless; and yet ne'ertheless<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a something in his turn of limb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And still more in his eye, which seem'd to express,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That though he look'd one of the seraphim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There lurk'd a man beneath the spirit's dress.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, the empress sometimes liked a boy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And had just buried the fair-faced Lanskoi.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No wonder then that Yermoloff, or Momonoff,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or Scherbatoff, or any other off<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or on, might dread her majesty had not room enough<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within her bosom (which was not too tough)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For a new flame; a thought to cast of gloom enough<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Along the aspect, whether smooth or rough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of him who, in the language of his station,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then held that 'high official situation.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O, gentle ladies! should you seek to know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The import of this diplomatic phrase,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bid Ireland's Londonderry's Marquess show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His parts of speech; and in the strange displays<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of that odd string of words, all in a row,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which none divine, and every one obeys,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps you may pick out some queer no meaning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of that weak wordy harvest the sole gleaning.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think I can explain myself without<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That sad inexplicable beast of prey--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That Sphinx, whose words would ever be a doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did not his deeds unriddle them each day--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That monstrous hieroglyphic--that long spout<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of blood and water, leaden Castlereagh!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And here I must an anecdote relate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But luckily of no great length or weight.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An English lady ask'd of an Italian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What were the actual and official duties<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the strange thing some women set a value on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which hovers oft about some married beauties,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Called 'Cavalier servente?'--a Pygmalion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose statues warm (I fear, alas! too true 't is)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beneath his art. The dame, press'd to disclose them,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Said--'Lady, I beseech you to suppose them.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus I supplicate your supposition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And mildest, matron-like interpretation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the imperial favourite's condition.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was a high place, the highest in the nation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, if not in rank; and the suspicion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of any one's attaining to his station,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt gave pain, where each new pair of shoulders,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If rather broad, made stocks rise and their holders.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, I said, was a most beauteous boy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And had retain'd his boyish look beyond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The usual hirsute seasons which destroy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With beards and whiskers, and the like, the fond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Parisian aspect which upset old Troy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And founded Doctors' Commons:--I have conn'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The history of divorces, which, though chequer'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Calls Ilion's the first damages on record.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Catherine, who loved all things (save her lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who was gone to his place), and pass'd for much<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Admiring those (by dainty dames abhorr'd)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gigantic gentlemen, yet had a touch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of sentiment; and he she most adored<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was the lamented Lanskoi, who was such<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lover as had cost her many a tear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet but made a middling grenadier.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh thou 'teterrima causa' of all 'belli'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou gate of life and death--thou nondescript!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whence is our exit and our entrance,--well I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May pause in pondering how all souls are dipt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In thy perennial fountain:--how man fell I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Know not, since knowledge saw her branches stript<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of her first fruit; but how he falls and rises<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since, thou hast settled beyond all surmises.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some call thee 'the worst cause of war,' but I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maintain thou art the best: for after all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From thee we come, to thee we go, and why<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To get at thee not batter down a wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or waste a world? since no one can deny<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou dost replenish worlds both great and small:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With, or without thee, all things at a stand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are, or would be, thou sea of life's dry land!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Catherine, who was the grand epitome<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of that great cause of war, or peace, or what<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You please (it causes all the things which be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So you may take your choice of this or that)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Catherine, I say. was very glad to see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The handsome herald, on whose plumage sat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Victory; and pausing as she saw him kneel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With his despatch, forgot to break the seal.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then recollecting the whole empress, nor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forgetting quite the woman (which composed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At least three parts of this great whole), she tore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The letter open with an air which posed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The court, that watch'd each look her visage wore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until a royal smile at length disclosed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fair weather for the day. Though rather spacious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her face was noble, her eyes fine, mouth gracious.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Great joy was hers, or rather joys: the first<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was a ta'en city, thirty thousand slain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Glory and triumph o'er her aspect burst,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As an East Indian sunrise on the main.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These quench'd a moment her ambition's thirst--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So Arab deserts drink in summer's rain:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In vain!--As fall the dews on quenchless sands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Blood only serves to wash Ambition's hands!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her next amusement was more fanciful;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She smiled at mad Suwarrow's rhymes, who threw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into a Russian couplet rather dull<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The whole gazette of thousands whom he slew.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her third was feminine enough to annul<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The shudder which runs naturally through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our veins, when things call'd sovereigns think it best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To kill, and generals turn it into jest.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The two first feelings ran their course complete,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lighted first her eye, and then her mouth:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The whole court look'd immediately most sweet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like flowers well water'd after a long drouth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But when on the lieutenant at her feet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her majesty, who liked to gaze on youth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Almost as much as on a new despatch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Glanced mildly, all the world was on the watch.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though somewhat large, exuberant, and truculent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When wroth--while pleased, she was as fine a figure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As those who like things rosy, ripe, and succulent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would wish to look on, while they are in vigour.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She could repay each amatory look you lent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With interest, and in turn was wont with rigour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To exact of Cupid's bills the full amount<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At sight, nor would permit you to discount.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With her the latter, though at times convenient,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was not so necessary; for they tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That she was handsome, and though fierce look'd lenient,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And always used her favourites too well.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If once beyond her boudoir's precincts in ye went,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your 'fortune' was in a fair way 'to swell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A man' (as Giles says); for though she would widow all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nations, she liked man as an individual.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What a strange thing is man? and what a stranger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is woman! What a whirlwind is her head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And what a whirlpool full of depth and danger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is all the rest about her! Whether wed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or widow, maid or mother, she can change her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mind like the wind: whatever she has said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or done, is light to what she 'll say or do;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The oldest thing on record, and yet new!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh Catherine! (for of all interjections,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To thee both oh! and ah! belong of right<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In love and war) how odd are the connections<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of human thoughts, which jostle in their flight!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just now yours were cut out in different sections:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First Ismail's capture caught your fancy quite;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next of new knights, the fresh and glorious batch;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thirdly he who brought you the despatch!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shakspeare talks of 'the herald Mercury<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And some such visions cross'd her majesty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While her young herald knelt before her still.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is very true the hill seem'd rather high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a lieutenant to climb up; but skill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Smooth'd even the Simplon's steep, and by God's blessing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With youth and health all kisses are 'heaven-kissing.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her majesty look'd down, the youth look'd up--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so they fell in love;--she with his face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His grace, his God-knows-what: for Cupid's cup<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the first draught intoxicates apace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A quintessential laudanum or 'black drop,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which makes one drunk at once, without the base<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Expedient of full bumpers; for the eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In love drinks all life's fountains (save tears) dry.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He, on the other hand, if not in love,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fell into that no less imperious passion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Self-love--which, when some sort of thing above<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ourselves, a singer, dancer, much in fashion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or duchess, princess, empress, 'deigns to prove'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ('T is Pope's phrase) a great longing, though a rash one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For one especial person out of many,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Makes us believe ourselves as good as any.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, he was of that delighted age<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which makes all female ages equal--when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We don't much care with whom we may engage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As bold as Daniel in the lion's den,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that we can our native sun assuage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the next ocean, which may flow just then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To make a twilight in, just as Sol's heat is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quench'd in the lap of the salt sea, or Thetis.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Catherine (we must say thus much for Catherine),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though bold and bloody, was the kind of thing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose temporary passion was quite flattering,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because each lover look'd a sort of king,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Made up upon an amatory pattern,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A royal husband in all save the ring--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which, being the damn'dest part of matrimony,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seem'd taking out the sting to leave the honey.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when you add to this, her womanhood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In its meridian, her blue eyes or gray<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (The last, if they have soul, are quite as good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or better, as the best examples say:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Napoleon's, Mary's (queen of Scotland), should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lend to that colour a transcendent ray;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Pallas also sanctions the same hue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Too wise to look through optics black or blue)--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her sweet smile, and her then majestic figure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her plumpness, her imperial condescension,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her preference of a boy to men much bigger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Fellows whom Messalina's self would pension),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her prime of life, just now in juicy vigour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With other extras, which we need not mention,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All these, or any one of these, explain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Enough to make a stripling very vain.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that's enough, for love is vanity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selfish in its beginning as its end,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Except where 't is a mere insanity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A maddening spirit which would strive to blend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Itself with beauty's frail inanity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On which the passion's self seems to depend:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hence some heathenish philosophers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Make love the main spring of the universe.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides Platonic love, besides the love<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of God, the love of sentiment, the loving<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of faithful pairs (I needs must rhyme with dove,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That good old steam-boat which keeps verses moving<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Gainst reason--Reason ne'er was hand-and-glove<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With rhyme, but always leant less to improving<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sound than sense)--beside all these pretences<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To love, there are those things which words name senses;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those movements, those improvements in our bodies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which make all bodies anxious to get out<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of their own sand-pits, to mix with a goddess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For such all women are at first no doubt.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How beautiful that moment! and how odd is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That fever which precedes the languid rout<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of our sensations! What a curious way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The whole thing is of clothing souls in clay!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The noblest kind of love is love Platonical,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To end or to begin with; the next grand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is that which may be christen'd love canonical,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because the clergy take the thing in hand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The third sort to be noted in our chronicle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As flourishing in every Christian land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is when chaste matrons to their other ties<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Add what may be call'd marriage in disguise.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, we won't analyse--our story must<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell for itself: the sovereign was smitten,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan much flatter'd by her love, or lust;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot stop to alter words once written,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the two are so mix'd with human dust,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he who names one, both perchance may hit on:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in such matters Russia's mighty empress<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Behaved no better than a common sempstress.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The whole court melted into one wide whisper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all lips were applied unto all ears!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The elder ladies' wrinkles curl'd much crisper<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As they beheld; the younger cast some leers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On one another, and each lovely lisper<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Smiled as she talk'd the matter o'er; but tears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of rivalship rose in each clouded eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the standing army who stood by.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All the ambassadors of all the powers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enquired, Who was this very new young man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who promised to be great in some few hours?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is full soon--though life is but a span.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Already they beheld the silver showers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of rubles rain, as fast as specie can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon his cabinet, besides the presents<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of several ribands, and some thousand peasants.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Catherine was generous,--all such ladies are:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love, that great opener of the heart and all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ways that lead there, be they near or far,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Above, below, by turnpikes great or small,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love (though she had a cursed taste for war,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And was not the best wife, unless we call<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such Clytemnestra, though perhaps 't is better<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That one should die, than two drag on the fetter)--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love had made Catherine make each lover's fortune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike our own half-chaste Elizabeth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose avarice all disbursements did importune,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If history, the grand liar, ever saith<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The truth; and though grief her old age might shorten,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because she put a favourite to death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her vile, ambiguous method of flirtation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And stinginess, disgrace her sex and station.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But when the levee rose, and all was bustle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the dissolving circle, all the nations'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ambassadors began as 't were to hustle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Round the young man with their congratulations.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also the softer silks were heard to rustle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of gentle dames, among whose recreations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is to speculate on handsome faces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Especially when such lead to high places.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, who found himself, he knew not how,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A general object of attention, made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His answers with a very graceful bow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if born for the ministerial trade.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though modest, on his unembarrass'd brow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nature had written 'gentleman.' He said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Little, but to the purpose; and his manner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Flung hovering graces o'er him like a banner.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An order from her majesty consign'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our young lieutenant to the genial care<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of those in office: all the world look'd kind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (As it will look sometimes with the first stare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which youth would not act ill to keep in mind),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As also did Miss Protasoff then there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Named from her mystic office 'l'Eprouveuse,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A term inexplicable to the Muse.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With her then, as in humble duty bound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan retired,--and so will I, until<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My Pegasus shall tire of touching ground.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have just lit on a 'heaven-kissing hill,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So lofty that I feel my brain turn round,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all my fancies whirling like a mill;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which is a signal to my nerves and brain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To take a quiet ride in some green Lane.<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; WHEN Newton saw an apple fall, he found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In that slight startle from his contemplation--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is said (for I 'll not answer above ground<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For any sage's creed or calculation)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A mode of proving that the earth turn'd round<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a most natural whirl, called 'gravitation;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since Adam, with a fall or with an apple.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Man fell with apples, and with apples rose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If this be true; for we must deem the mode<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In which Sir Isaac Newton could disclose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through the then unpaved stars the turnpike road,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A thing to counterbalance human woes:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For ever since immortal man hath glow'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With all kinds of mechanics, and full soon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Steam-engines will conduct him to the moon.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wherefore this exordium?--Why, just now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In taking up this paltry sheet of paper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My bosom underwent a glorious glow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And my internal spirit cut a caper:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And though so much inferior, as I know,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To those who, by the dint of glass and vapour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Discover stars and sail in the wind's eye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish to do as much by poesy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the wind's eye I have sail'd, and sail; but for<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stars, I own my telescope is dim:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But at least I have shunn'd the common shore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And leaving land far out of sight, would skim<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ocean of eternity: the roar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of breakers has not daunted my slight, trim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still sea-worthy skiff; and she may float<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where ships have founder'd, as doth many a boat.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We left our hero, Juan, in the bloom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of favouritism, but not yet in the blush;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And far be it from my Muses to presume<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (For I have more than one Muse at a push)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To follow him beyond the drawing-room:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is enough that Fortune found him flush<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of youth, and vigour, beauty, and those things<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which for an instant clip enjoyment's wings.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But soon they grow again and leave their nest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Oh!' saith the Psalmist, 'that I had a dove's<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pinions to flee away, and be at rest!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And who that recollects young years and loves,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though hoary now, and with a withering breast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And palsied fancy, which no longer roves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond its dimm'd eye's sphere,--but would much rather<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sigh like his son, than cough like his grandfather?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But sighs subside, and tears (even widows') shrink,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Arno in the summer, to a shallow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So narrow as to shame their wintry brink,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which threatens inundations deep and yellow!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such difference doth a few months make. You 'd think<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grief a rich field which never would lie fallow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No more it doth, its ploughs but change their boys,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who furrow some new soil to sow for joys.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But coughs will come when sighs depart--and now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then before sighs cease; for oft the one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will bring the other, ere the lake-like brow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is ruffled by a wrinkle, or the sun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of life reach'd ten o'clock: and while a glow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hectic and brief as summer's day nigh done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'erspreads the cheek which seems too pure for clay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thousands blaze, love, hope, die,--how happy they!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan was not meant to die so soon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We left him in the focus of such glory<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As may be won by favour of the moon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or ladies' fancies--rather transitory<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps; but who would scorn the month of June,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because December, with his breath so hoary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must come? Much rather should he court the ray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To hoard up warmth against a wintry day.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, he had some qualities which fix<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Middle-aged ladies even more than young:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The former know what's what; while new-fledged chicks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Know little more of love than what is sung<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In rhymes, or dreamt (for fancy will play tricks)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In visions of those skies from whence Love sprung.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some reckon women by their suns or years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I rather think the moon should date the dears.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And why? because she's changeable and chaste.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know no other reason, whatsoe'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suspicious people, who find fault in haste,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May choose to tax me with; which is not fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor flattering to 'their temper or their taste,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As my friend Jeffrey writes with such an air:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, I forgive him, and I trust<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He will forgive himself;--if not, I must.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Old enemies who have become new friends<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should so continue--'t is a point of honour;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I know nothing which could make amends<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a return to hatred: I would shun her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like garlic, howsoever she extends<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her hundred arms and legs, and fain outrun her.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Old flames, new wives, become our bitterest foes--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Converted foes should scorn to join with those.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This were the worst desertion:--renegadoes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even shuffling Southey, that incarnate lie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would scarcely join again the 'reformadoes,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom he forsook to fill the laureate's sty:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And honest men from Iceland to Barbadoes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether in Caledon or Italy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Should not veer round with every breath, nor seize<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To pain, the moment when you cease to please.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lawyer and the critic but behold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The baser sides of literature and life,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And nought remains unseen, but much untold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By those who scour those double vales of strife.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While common men grow ignorantly old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The lawyer's brief is like the surgeon's knife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dissecting the whole inside of a question,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And with it all the process of digestion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A legal broom's a moral chimney-sweeper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that's the reason he himself's so dirty;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The endless soot bestows a tint far deeper<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than can be hid by altering his shirt; he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Retains the sable stains of the dark creeper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least some twenty-nine do out of thirty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In all their habits;--not so you, I own;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As Caesar wore his robe you wear your gown.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all our little feuds, at least all mine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dear Jefferson, once my most redoubted foe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (As far as rhyme and criticism combine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make such puppets of us things below),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are over: Here's a health to 'Auld Lang Syne!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do not know you, and may never know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Your face--but you have acted on the whole<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most nobly, and I own it from my soul.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when I use the phrase of 'Auld Lang Syne!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is not address'd to you--the more's the pity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For me, for I would rather take my wine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With you, than aught (save Scott) in your proud city.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But somehow,--it may seem a schoolboy's whine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet I seek not to be grand nor witty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I am half a Scot by birth, and bred<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A whole one, and my heart flies to my head,--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As 'Auld Lang Syne' brings Scotland, one and all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scotch plaids, Scotch snoods, the blue hills, and clear streams,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Dee, the Don, Balgounie's brig's black wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All my boy feelings, all my gentler dreams<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of what I then dreamt, clothed in their own pall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Banquo's offspring;--floating past me seems<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My childhood in this childishness of mine:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I care not--'t is a glimpse of 'Auld Lang Syne.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And though, as you remember, in a fit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of wrath and rhyme, when juvenile and curly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I rail'd at Scots to show my wrath and wit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which must be own'd was sensitive and surly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet 't is in vain such sallies to permit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They cannot quench young feelings fresh and early:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I'scotch'd not kill'd' the Scotchman in my blood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And love the land of 'mountain and of flood.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan, who was real, or ideal,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For both are much the same, since what men think<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exists when the once thinkers are less real<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than what they thought, for mind can never sink,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And 'gainst the body makes a strong appeal;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet 't is very puzzling on the brink<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of what is call'd eternity, to stare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And know no more of what is here, than there;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan grew a very polish'd Russian--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How we won't mention, why we need not say:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Few youthful minds can stand the strong concussion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of any slight temptation in their way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But his just now were spread as is a cushion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Smooth'd for a monarch's seat of honour; gay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Damsels, and dances, revels, ready money,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Made ice seem paradise, and winter sunny.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The favour of the empress was agreeable;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though the duty wax'd a little hard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young people at his time of life should be able<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To come off handsomely in that regard.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was now growing up like a green tree, able<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For love, war, or ambition, which reward<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their luckier votaries, till old age's tedium<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Make some prefer the circulating medium.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; About this time, as might have been anticipated,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seduced by youth and dangerous examples,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan grew, I fear, a little dissipated;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is a sad thing, and not only tramples<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On our fresh feelings, but--as being participated<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all kinds of incorrigible samples<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of frail humanity--must make us selfish,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And shut our souls up in us like a shell-fish.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This we pass over. We will also pass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The usual progress of intrigues between<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unequal matches, such as are, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A young lieutenant's with a not old queen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But one who is not so youthful as she was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the royalty of sweet seventeen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sovereigns may sway materials, but not matter,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Death, the sovereign's sovereign, though the great<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gracchus of all mortality, who levels<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With his Agrarian laws the high estate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of him who feasts, and fights, and roars, and revels,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To one small grass-grown patch (which must await<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corruption for its crop) with the poor devils<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who never had a foot of land till now,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Death's a reformer, all men must allow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He lived (not Death, but Juan) in a hurry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of waste, and haste, and glare, and gloss, and glitter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this gay clime of bear-skins black and furry--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which (though I hate to say a thing that's bitter)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Peep out sometimes, when things are in a flurry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through all the 'purple and fine linen,' fitter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Babylon's than Russia's royal harlot--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And neutralize her outward show of scarlet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And this same state we won't describe: we would<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps from hearsay, or from recollection;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But getting nigh grim Dante's 'obscure wood,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That horrid equinox, that hateful section<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of human years, that half-way house, that rude<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hut, whence wise travellers drive with circumspection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Life's sad post-horses o'er the dreary frontier<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of age, and looking back to youth, give one tear;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I won't describe,--that is, if I can help<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Description; and I won't reflect,--that is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If I can stave off thought, which--as a whelp<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clings to its teat--sticks to me through the abyss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of this odd labyrinth; or as the kelp<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Holds by the rock; or as a lover's kiss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Drains its first draught of lips:--but, as I said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I won't philosophise, and will be read.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, instead of courting courts, was courted,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing which happens rarely: this he owed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Much to his youth, and much to his reported<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Valour; much also to the blood he show'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like a race-horse; much to each dress he sported,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which set the beauty off in which he glow'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As purple clouds befringe the sun; but most<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He owed to an old woman and his post.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He wrote to Spain:--and all his near relations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perceiving fie was in a handsome way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of getting on himself, and finding stations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For cousins also, answer'd the same day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Several prepared themselves for emigrations;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And eating ices, were o'erheard to say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That with the addition of a slight pelisse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madrid's and Moscow's climes were of a piece.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His mother, Donna Inez, finding, too,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in the lieu of drawing on his banker,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where his assets were waxing rather few,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had brought his spending to a handsome anchor,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Replied, 'that she was glad to see him through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those pleasures after which wild youth will hanker;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the sole sign of man's being in his senses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is, learning to reduce his past expenses.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'she also recommended him to God,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And no less to God's Son, as well as Mother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Warn'd him against Greek worship, which looks odd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Catholic eyes; but told him, too, to smother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Outward dislike, which don't look well abroad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inform'd him that he had a little brother<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Born in a second wedlock; and above<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All, praised the empress's maternal love.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'she could not too much give her approbation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto an empress, who preferr'd young men<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose age, and what was better still, whose nation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And climate, stopp'd all scandal (now and then):--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At home it might have given her some vexation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But where thermometers sunk down to ten,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or five, or one, or zero, she could never<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Believe that virtue thaw'd before the river.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh for a forty-parson power to chant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy praise, Hypocrisy! Oh for a hymn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Loud as the virtues thou dost loudly vaunt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not practise! Oh for trumps of cherubim!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or the ear-trumpet of my good old aunt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who, though her spectacles at last grew dim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Drew quiet consolation through its hint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When she no more could read the pious print.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was no hypocrite at least, poor soul,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But went to heaven in as sincere a way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As any body on the elected roll,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which portions out upon the judgment day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Heaven's freeholds, in a sort of doomsday scroll,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as the conqueror William did repay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His knights with, lotting others' properties<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into some sixty thousand new knights' fees.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't complain, whose ancestors are there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Erneis, Radulphus--eight-and-forty manors<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (If that my memory doth not greatly err)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were their reward for following Billy's banners:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And though I can't help thinking 't was scarce fair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To strip the Saxons of their hydes, like tanners;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet as they founded churches with the produce,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 'll deem, no doubt, they put it to a good use.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The gentle Juan flourish'd, though at times<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He felt like other plants called sensitive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which shrink from touch, as monarchs do from rhymes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save such as Southey can afford to give.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps he long'd in bitter frosts for climes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In which the Neva's ice would cease to live<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before May-day: perhaps, despite his duty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In royalty's vast arms he sigh d for beauty:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps--but, sans perhaps, we need not seek<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For causes young or old: the canker-worm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will feed upon the fairest, freshest cheek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As well as further drain the wither'd form:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Care, like a housekeeper, brings every week<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His bills in, and however we may storm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They must be paid: though six days smoothly run,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The seventh will bring blue devils or a dun.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know how it was, but he grew sick:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The empress was alarm'd, and her physician<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (The same who physick'd Peter) found the tick<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of his fierce pulse betoken a condition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which augur'd of the dead, however quick<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Itself, and show'd a feverish disposition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At which the whole court was extremely troubled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sovereign shock'd, and all his medicines doubled.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Low were the whispers, manifold the rumours:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some said he had been poison'd by Potemkin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Others talk'd learnedly of certain tumours,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exhaustion, or disorders of the same kin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some said 't was a concoction of the humours,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which with the blood too readily will claim kin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Others again were ready to maintain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ''T was only the fatigue of last campaign.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here is one prescription out of many:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'sodae sulphat. 3vj. 3fs. Mannae optim.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aq. fervent. f. 3ifs. 3ij. tinct. Sennae<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Haustus' (And here the surgeon came and cupp'd him)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Rx Pulv Com gr. iij. Ipecacuanhae'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (With more beside if Juan had not stopp'd 'em).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Bolus Potassae Sulphuret. sumendus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Et haustus ter in die capiendus.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the way physicians mend or end us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Secundum artem: but although we sneer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In health--when ill, we call them to attend us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without the least propensity to jeer:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While that 'hiatus maxime deflendus'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be fill'd up by spade or mattock's near,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of gliding graciously down Lethe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We tease mild Baillie, or soft Abernethy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan demurr'd at this first notice to<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quit; and though death had threaten'd an ejection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His youth and constitution bore him through,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sent the doctors in a new direction.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still his state was delicate: the hue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of health but flicker'd with a faint reflection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Along his wasted cheek, and seem'd to gravel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The faculty--who said that he must travel.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The climate was too cold, they said, for him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meridian-born, to bloom in. This opinion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Made the chaste Catherine look a little grim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who did not like at first to lose her minion:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But when she saw his dazzling eye wax dim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And drooping like an eagle's with clipt pinion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She then resolved to send him on a mission,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in a style becoming his condition.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was just then a kind of a discussion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sort of treaty or negotiation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Between the British cabinet and Russian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maintain'd with all the due prevarication<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With which great states such things are apt to push on;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Something about the Baltic's navigation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hides, train-oil, tallow, and the rights of Thetis,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which Britons deem their 'uti possidetis.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So Catherine, who had a handsome way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of fitting out her favourites, conferr'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This secret charge on Juan, to display<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At once her royal splendour, and reward<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His services. He kiss'd hands the next day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Received instructions how to play his card,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was laden with all kinds of gifts and honours,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which show'd what great discernment was the donor's.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But she was lucky, and luck's all. Your queens<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are generally prosperous in reigning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which puzzles us to know what Fortune means.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to continue: though her years were waning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her climacteric teased her like her teens;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And though her dignity brook'd no complaining,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So much did Juan's setting off distress her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She could not find at first a fit successor.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But time, the comforter, will come at last;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And four-and-twenty hours, and twice that number<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of candidates requesting to be placed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Made Catherine taste next night a quiet slumber:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not that she meant to fix again in haste,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor did she find the quantity encumber,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But always choosing with deliberation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kept the place open for their emulation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While this high post of honour's in abeyance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For one or two days, reader, we request<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 'll mount with our young hero the conveyance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which wafted him from Petersburgh: the best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Barouche, which had the glory to display once<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fair czarina's autocratic crest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When, a new lphigene, she went to Tauris,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was given to her favourite, and now bore his.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A bull-dog, and a bullfinch, and an ermine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All private favourites of Don Juan;--for<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Let deeper sages the true cause determine)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had a kind of inclination, or<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Weakness, for what most people deem mere vermin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Live animals: an old maid of threescore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For cats and birds more penchant ne'er display'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although he was not old, nor even a maid;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The animals aforesaid occupied<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their station: there were valets, secretaries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In other vehicles; but at his side<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sat little Leila, who survived the parries<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He made 'gainst Cossacque sabres, in the wide<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Slaughter of Ismail. Though my wild Muse varies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her note, she don't forget the infant girl<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whom he preserved, a pure and living pearl<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Poor little thing! She was as fair as docile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with that gentle, serious character,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As rare in living beings as a fossile<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Man, 'midst thy mouldy mammoths, 'grand Cuvier!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ill fitted was her ignorance to jostle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With this o'erwhelming world, where all must err:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But she was yet but ten years old, and therefore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was tranquil, though she knew not why or wherefore.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan loved her, and she loved him, as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor brother, father, sister, daughter love.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot tell exactly what it was;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was not yet quite old enough to prove<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Parental feelings, and the other class,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Call'd brotherly affection, could not move<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His bosom,--for he never had a sister:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ah! if he had, how much he would have miss'd her!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And still less was it sensual; for besides<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he was not an ancient debauchee<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Who like sour fruit, to stir their veins' salt tides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As acids rouse a dormant alkali),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although ('t will happen as our planet guides)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His youth was not the chastest that might be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was the purest Platonism at bottom<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all his feelings--only he forgot 'em.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just now there was no peril of temptation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He loved the infant orphan he had saved,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As patriots (now and then) may love a nation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His pride, too, felt that she was not enslaved<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Owing to him;--as also her salvation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through his means and the church's might be paved.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But one thing's odd, which here must be inserted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The little Turk refused to be converted.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was strange enough she should retain the impression<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through such a scene of change, and dread, and slaughter;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But though three bishops told her the transgression,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She show'd a great dislike to holy water:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She also had no passion for confession;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps she had nothing to confess:--no matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er the cause, the church made little of it--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She still held out that Mahomet was a prophet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, the only Christian she could bear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was Juan; whom she seem'd to have selected<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In place of what her home and friends once were.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He naturally loved what he protected:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus they form'd a rather curious pair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A guardian green in years, a ward connected<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In neither clime, time, blood, with her defender;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet this want of ties made theirs more tender.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They journey'd on through Poland and through Warsaw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Famous for mines of salt and yokes of iron:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through Courland also, which that famous farce saw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which gave her dukes the graceless name of 'Biron.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is the same landscape which the modern Mars saw,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who march'd to Moscow, led by Fame, the siren!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To lose by one month's frost some twenty years<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of conquest, and his guard of grenadiers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let this not seem an anti-climax:--'Oh!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My guard! my old guard exclaim'd!' exclaim'd that god of day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Think of the Thunderer's falling down below<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Carotid-artery-cutting Castlereagh!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, that glory should be chill'd by snow!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But should we wish to warm us on our way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through Poland, there is Kosciusko's name<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Might scatter fire through ice, like Hecla's flame.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From Poland they came on through Prussia Proper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Konigsberg the capital, whose vaunt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides some veins of iron, lead, or copper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has lately been the great Professor Kant.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, who cared not a tobacco-stopper<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About philosophy, pursued his jaunt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To Germany, whose somewhat tardy millions<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have princes who spur more than their postilions.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thence through Berlin, Dresden, and the like,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until he reach'd the castellated Rhine:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye glorious Gothic scenes! how much ye strike<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All phantasies, not even excepting mine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A grey wall, a green ruin, rusty pike,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Make my soul pass the equinoctial line<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Between the present and past worlds, and hover<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon their airy confine, half-seas-over.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan posted on through Manheim, Bonn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which Drachenfels frowns over like a spectre<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the good feudal times forever gone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On which I have not time just now to lecture.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From thence he was drawn onwards to Cologne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A city which presents to the inspector<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Eleven thousand maidenheads of bone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The greatest number flesh hath ever known.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From thence to Holland's Hague and Helvoetsluys,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That water-land of Dutchmen and of ditches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where juniper expresses its best juice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The poor man's sparkling substitute for riches.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Senates and sages have condemn'd its use--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to deny the mob a cordial, which is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Too often all the clothing, meat, or fuel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Good government has left them, seems but cruel.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here he embark'd, and with a flowing sail<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Went bounding for the island of the free,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Towards which the impatient wind blew half a gale;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; High dash'd the spray, the bows dipp'd in the sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And sea-sick passengers turn'd somewhat pale;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan, season'd, as he well might be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By former voyages, stood to watch the skiffs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which pass'd, or catch the first glimpse of the cliffs.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At length they rose, like a white wall along<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The blue sea's border; and I Don Juan felt--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What even young strangers feel a little strong<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the first sight of Albion's chalky belt--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A kind of pride that he should be among<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those haughty shopkeepers, who sternly dealt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their goods and edicts out from pole to pole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And made the very billows pay them toll.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've no great cause to love that spot of earth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which holds what might have been the noblest nation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But though I owe it little but my birth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel a mix'd regret and veneration<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For its decaying fame and former worth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seven years (the usual term of transportation)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of absence lay one's old resentments level,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When a man's country's going to the devil.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! could she but fully, truly, know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How her great name is now throughout abhorr'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How eager all the earth is for the blow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which shall lay bare her bosom to the sword;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How all the nations deem her their worst foe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That worse than worst of foes, the once adored<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; False friend, who held out freedom to mankind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now would chain them, to the very mind:--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would she be proud, or boast herself the free,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who is but first of slaves? The nations are<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In prison,--but the gaoler, what is he?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No less a victim to the bolt and bar.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is the poor privilege to turn the key<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the captive, freedom? He's as far<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From the enjoyment of the earth and air<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who watches o'er the chain, as they who wear.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan now saw Albion's earliest beauties,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy cliffs, dear Dover! harbour, and hotel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thy custom-house, with all its delicate duties;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thy waiters running mucks at every bell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thy packets, all whose passengers are booties<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To those who upon land or water dwell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And last, not least, to strangers uninstructed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thy long, long bills, whence nothing is deducted.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, though careless, young, and magnifique,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And rich in rubles, diamonds, cash, and credit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who did not limit much his bills per week,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet stared at this a little, though he paid it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (His Maggior Duomo, a smart, subtle Greek,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before him summ'd the awful scroll and read it);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But doubtless as the air, though seldom sunny,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is free, the respiration's worth the money.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On with the horses! Off to Canterbury!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tramp, tramp o'er pebble, and splash, splash through puddle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hurrah! how swiftly speeds the post so merry!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not like slow Germany, wherein they muddle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Along the road, as if they went to bury<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their fare; and also pause besides, to fuddle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With'schnapps'--sad dogs! whom 'Hundsfot,' or 'Verflucter,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Affect no more than lightning a conductor.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now there is nothing gives a man such spirits,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Leavening his blood as cayenne doth a curry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As going at full speed--no matter where its<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Direction be, so 't is but in a hurry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And merely for the sake of its own merits;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the less cause there is for all this flurry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The greater is the pleasure in arriving<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the great end of travel--which is driving.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They saw at Canterbury the cathedral;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Black Edward's helm, and Becket's bloody stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were pointed out as usual by the bedral,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the same quaint, uninterested tone:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's glory again for you, gentle reader! All<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ends in a rusty casque and dubious bone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Half-solved into these sodas or magnesias;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which form that bitter draught, the human species.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The effect on Juan was of course sublime:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He breathed a thousand Cressys, as he saw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That casque, which never stoop'd except to Time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even the bold Churchman's tomb excited awe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who died in the then great attempt to climb<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'er kings, who now at least must talk of law<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before they butcher. Little Leila gazed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And ask'd why such a structure had been raised:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And being told it was 'God's house,' she said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was well lodged, but only wonder'd how<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He suffer'd Infidels in his homestead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cruel Nazarenes, who had laid low<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His holy temples in the lands which bred<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The True Believers:--and her infant brow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was bent with grief that Mahomet should resign<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A mosque so noble, flung like pearls to swine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh! oh! through meadows managed like a garden,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A paradise of hops and high production;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For after years of travel by a bard in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Countries of greater heat, but lesser suction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A green field is a sight which makes him pardon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The absence of that more sublime construction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which mixes up vines, olives, precipices,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Glaciers, volcanos, oranges, and ices.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when I think upon a pot of beer--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I won't weep!--and so drive on, postilions!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the smart boys spurr'd fast in their career,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Juan admired these highways of free millions;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A country in all senses the most dear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To foreigner or native, save some silly ones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who 'kick against the pricks' just at this juncture,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And for their pains get only a fresh puncture.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What a delightful thing's a turnpike road!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So smooth, so level, such a mode of shaving<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The earth, as scarce the eagle in the broad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Air can accomplish, with his wide wings waving.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had such been cut in Phaeton's time, the god<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had told his son to satisfy his craving<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the York mail;--but onward as we roll,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'surgit amari aliquid'--the toll<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas, how deeply painful is all payment!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take lives, take wives, take aught except men's purses:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As Machiavel shows those in purple raiment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such is the shortest way to general curses.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They hate a murderer much less than a claimant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On that sweet ore which every body nurses;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kill a man's family, and he may brook it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But keep your hands out of his breeches' pocket.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So said the Florentine: ye monarchs, hearken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To your instructor. Juan now was borne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as the day began to wane and darken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'er the high hill, which looks with pride or scorn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Toward the great city.--Ye who have a spark in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your veins of Cockney spirit, smile or mourn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According as you take things well or ill;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bold Britons, we are now on Shooter's Hill!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sun went down, the smoke rose up, as from<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A half-unquench'd volcano, o'er a space<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which well beseem'd the 'Devil's drawing-room,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As some have qualified that wondrous place:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan felt, though not approaching home,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As one who, though he were not of the race,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Revered the soil, of those true sons the mother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who butcher'd half the earth, and bullied t' other.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A mighty mass of brick, and smoke, and shipping,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dirty and dusky, but as wide as eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could reach, with here and there a sail just skipping<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In sight, then lost amidst the forestry<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of masts; a wilderness of steeples peeping<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On tiptoe through their sea-coal canopy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A huge, dun cupola, like a foolscap crown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On a fool's head--and there is London Town!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan saw not this: each wreath of smoke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Appear'd to him but as the magic vapour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of some alchymic furnace, from whence broke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wealth of worlds (a wealth of tax and paper):<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The gloomy clouds, which o'er it as a yoke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are bow'd, and put the sun out like a taper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were nothing but the natural atmosphere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Extremely wholesome, though but rarely clear.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He paused--and so will I; as doth a crew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before they give their broadside. By and by,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My gentle countrymen, we will renew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our old acquaintance; and at least I 'll try<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To tell you truths you will not take as true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because they are so;--a male Mrs. Fry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With a soft besom will I sweep your halls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And brush a web or two from off the walls.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh Mrs. Fry! Why go to Newgate? Why<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Preach to poor rogues? And wherefore not begin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Carlton, or with other houses? Try<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your head at harden'd and imperial sin.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To mend the people's an absurdity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A jargon, a mere philanthropic din,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless you make their betters better:--Fy!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I thought you had more religion, Mrs. Fry.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teach them the decencies of good threescore;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cure them of tours, hussar and highland dresses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tell them that youth once gone returns no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That hired huzzas redeem no land's distresses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tell them Sir William Curtis is a bore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Too dull even for the dullest of excesses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The witless Falstaff of a hoary Hal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A fool whose bells have ceased to ring at all.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tell them, though it may be perhaps too late,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On life's worn confine, jaded, bloated, sated,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To set up vain pretence of being great,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is not so to be good; and be it stated,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The worthiest kings have ever loved least state;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tell them--But you won't, and I have prated<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just now enough; but by and by I 'll prattle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Roland's horn in Roncesvalles' battle.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="axi">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;             CANTO THE ELEVENTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; WHEN Bishop Berkeley said 'there was no matter,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And proved it--'t was no matter what he said:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They say his system 't is in vain to batter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Too subtle for the airiest human head;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet who can believe it? I would shatter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gladly all matters down to stone or lead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or adamant, to find the world a spirit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wear my head, denying that I wear it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What a sublime discovery 't was to make the<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Universe universal egotism,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That all's ideal--all ourselves: I 'll stake the<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; World (be it what you will) that that's no schism.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh Doubt!--if thou be'st Doubt, for which some take thee;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But which I doubt extremely--thou sole prism<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the Truth's rays, spoil not my draught of spirit!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Heaven's brandy, though our brain can hardly bear it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For ever and anon comes Indigestion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Not the most 'dainty Ariel') and perplexes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our soarings with another sort of question:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that which after all my spirit vexes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is, that I find no spot where man can rest eye on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without confusion of the sorts and sexes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of beings, stars, and this unriddled wonder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world, which at the worst's a glorious blunder--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If it be chance; or if it be according<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the old text, still better:--lest it should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Turn out so, we 'll say nothing 'gainst the wording,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As several people think such hazards rude.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They 're right; our days are too brief for affording<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Space to dispute what no one ever could<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Decide, and every body one day will<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Know very clearly--or at least lie still.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore will I leave off metaphysical<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Discussion, which is neither here nor there:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If I agree that what is, is; then this I call<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being quite perspicuous and extremely fair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The truth is, I 've grown lately rather phthisical:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know what the reason is--the air<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of illness, I grow much more orthodox.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first attack at once proved the Divinity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (But that I never doubted, nor the Devil);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The next, the Virgin's mystical virginity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The third, the usual Origin of Evil;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fourth at once establish'd the whole Trinity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On so uncontrovertible a level,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That I devoutly wish'd the three were four,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On purpose to believe so much the more.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To our Theme.--The man who has stood on the Acropolis,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And look'd down over Attica; or he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who has sail'd where picturesque Constantinople is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or seen Timbuctoo, or hath taken tea<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In small-eyed China's crockery-ware metropolis,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or sat amidst the bricks of Nineveh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May not think much of London's first appearance--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But ask him what he thinks of it a year hence?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan had got out on Shooter's Hill;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sunset the time, the place the same declivity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which looks along that vale of good and ill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where London streets ferment in full activity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While every thing around was calm and still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Except the creak of wheels, which on their pivot he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Heard,--and that bee-like, bubbling, busy hum<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of cities, that boil over with their scum:--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I say, Don Juan, wrapt in contemplation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Walk'd on behind his carriage, o'er the summit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And lost in wonder of so great a nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gave way to 't, since he could not overcome it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'And here,' he cried, 'is Freedom's chosen station;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here peals the people's voice, nor can entomb it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Racks, prisons, inquisitions; resurrection<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Awaits it, each new meeting or election.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Here are chaste wives, pure lives; here people pay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what they please; and if that things be dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is only that they love to throw away<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their cash, to show how much they have a-year.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here laws are all inviolate; none lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Traps for the traveller; every highway's clear:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here-' he was interrupted by a knife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With,--'Damn your eyes! your money or your life!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In ambush laid, who had perceived him loiter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Behind his carriage; and, like handy lads,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had seized the lucky hour to reconnoitre,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In which the heedless gentleman who gads<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the road, unless he prove a fighter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May find himself within that isle of riches<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exposed to lose his life as well as breeches.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, who did not understand a word<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of English, save their shibboleth, 'God damn!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And even that he had so rarely heard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sometimes thought 't was only their'salam,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or 'God be with you!'--and 't is not absurd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To think so: for half English as I am<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (To my misfortune), never can I say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I heard them wish 'God with you,' save that way;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan yet quickly understood their gesture,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And being somewhat choleric and sudden,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fired it into one assailant's pudding--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who fell, as rolls an ox o'er in his pasture,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And roar'd out, as he writhed his native mud in,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unto his nearest follower or henchman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Oh Jack! I 'm floor'd by that 'ere bloody Frenchman!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On which Jack and his train set off at speed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan's suite, late scatter'd at a distance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Came up, all marvelling at such a deed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And offering, as usual, late assistance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, who saw the moon's late minion bleed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if his veins would pour out his existence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stood calling out for bandages and lint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wish'd he had been less hasty with his flint.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Perhaps,' thought he, 'it is the country's wont<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To welcome foreigners in this way: now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I recollect some innkeepers who don't<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Differ, except in robbing with a bow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In lieu of a bare blade and brazen front.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what is to be done? I can't allow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fellow to lie groaning on the road:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So take him up; I 'll help you with the load.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But ere they could perform this pious duty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dying man cried, 'Hold! I 've got my gruel!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh for a glass of max! We 've miss'd our booty;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let me die where I am!' And as the fuel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of life shrunk in his heart, and thick and sooty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The drops fell from his death-wound, and he drew ill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His breath,--he from his swelling throat untied<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A kerchief, crying, 'Give Sal that!'--and died.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The cravat stain'd with bloody drops fell down<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before Don Juan's feet: he could not tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exactly why it was before him thrown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor what the meaning of the man's farewell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Poor Tom was once a kiddy upon town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thorough varmint, and a real swell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Full flash, all fancy, until fairly diddled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His pockets first and then his body riddled.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan, having done the best he could<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In all the circumstances of the case,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As soon as 'Crowner's quest' allow'd, pursued<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His travels to the capital apace;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Esteeming it a little hard he should<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In twelve hours' time, and very little space,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have been obliged to slay a freeborn native<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In self-defence: this made him meditative.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He from the world had cut off a great man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who in his time had made heroic bustle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who in a row like Tom could lead the van,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Booze in the ken, or at the spellken hustle?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who queer a flat? Who (spite of Bow Street's ban)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the high toby-spice so flash the muzzle?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who on a lark, with black-eyed Sal (his blowing),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So prime, so swell, so nutty, and so knowing?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Tom's no more--and so no more of Tom.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heroes must die; and by God's blessing 't is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not long before the most of them go home.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hail! Thamis, Hail! Upon thy verge it is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That Juan's chariot, rolling like a drum<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In thunder, holds the way it can't well miss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through Kennington and all the other 'tons,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which makes us wish ourselves in town at once;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through Groves, so call'd as being void of trees<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Like lucus from no light); through prospects named<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mount Pleasant, as containing nought to please,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor much to climb; through little boxes framed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of bricks, to let the dust in at your ease,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With 'To be let' upon their doors proclaim'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through 'Rows' most modestly call'd 'Paradise,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which Eve might quit without much sacrifice;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through coaches, drays, choked turnpikes, and a whirl<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of wheels, and roar of voices, and confusion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here taverns wooing to a pint of 'purl,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There mails fast flying off like a delusion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There barbers' blocks with periwigs in curl<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In windows; here the lamplighter's infusion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Slowly distill'd into the glimmering glass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (For in those days we had not got to gas);--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through this, and much, and more, is the approach<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of travellers to mighty Babylon:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether they come by horse, or chaise, or coach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With slight exceptions, all the ways seem one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I could say more, but do not choose to encroach<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the Guide-book's privilege. The sun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had set some time, and night was on the ridge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of twilight, as the party cross'd the bridge,--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That's rather fine. The gentle sound of Thamis--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who vindicates a moment, too, his stream,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though hardly heard through multifarious 'damme's'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The lamps of Westminster's more regular gleam,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The breadth of pavement, and yon shrine where fame is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A spectral resident--whose pallid beam<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In shape of moonshine hovers o'er the pile--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Make this a sacred part of Albion's isle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Druids' groves are gone--so much the better:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stone-Henge is not--but what the devil is it?--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Bedlam still exists with its sage fetter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That madmen may not bite you on a visit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Bench too seats or suits full many a debtor;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Mansion House too (though some people quiz it)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To me appears a stiff yet grand erection;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then the Abbey's worth the whole collection.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The line of lights, too, up to Charing Cross,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pall Mall, and so forth, have a coruscation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like gold as in comparison to dross,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Match'd with the Continent's illumination,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose cities Night by no means deigns to gloss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The French were not yet a lamp-lighting nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when they grew so--on their new-found lantern,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of wicks, they made a wicked man turn.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A row of gentlemen along the streets<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suspended may illuminate mankind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As also bonfires made of country seats;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the old way is best for the purblind:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The other looks like phosphorus on sheets,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sort of ignis fatuus to the mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which, though 't is certain to perplex and frighten,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But London's so well lit, that if Diogenes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could recommence to hunt his honest man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And found him not amidst the various progenies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of this enormous city's spreading span,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T were not for want of lamps to aid his dodging his<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet undiscover'd treasure. What I can,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've done to find the same throughout life's journey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But see the world is only one attorney.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Over the stones still rattling up Pall Mall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Through crowds and carriages, but waxing thinner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As thunder'd knockers broke the long seal'd spell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of doors 'gainst duns, and to an early dinner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Admitted a small party as night fell,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan, our young diplomatic sinner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pursued his path, and drove past some hotels,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; St. James's Palace and St. James's 'Hells.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They reach'd the hotel: forth stream'd from the front door<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A tide of well-clad waiters, and around<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mob stood, and as usual several score<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of those pedestrian Paphians who abound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In decent London when the daylight's o'er;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commodious but immoral, they are found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Useful, like Malthus, in promoting marriage.--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan now is stepping from his carriage<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into one of the sweetest of hotels,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially for foreigners--and mostly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For those whom favour or whom fortune swells,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cannot find a bill's small items costly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There many an envoy either dwelt or dwells<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (The den of many a diplomatic lost lie),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until to some conspicuous square they pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And blazon o'er the door their names in brass.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, whose was a delicate commission,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Private, though publicly important, bore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No title to point out with due precision<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The exact affair on which he was sent o'er.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was merely known, that on a secret mission<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A foreigner of rank had graced our shore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young, handsome, and accomplish'd, who was said<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (In whispers) to have turn'd his sovereign's head.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some rumour also of some strange adventures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had gone before him, and his wars and loves;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as romantic heads are pretty painters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, above all, an Englishwoman's roves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into the excursive, breaking the indentures<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of sober reason wheresoe'er it moves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He found himself extremely in the fashion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which serves our thinking people for a passion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't mean that they are passionless, but quite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The contrary; but then 't is in the head;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet as the consequences are as bright<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if they acted with the heart instead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What after all can signify the site<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of ladies' lucubrations? So they lead<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In safety to the place for which you start,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What matters if the road be head or heart?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan presented in the proper place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To proper placemen, every Russ credential;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And was received with all the due grimace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By those who govern in the mood potential,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who, seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thought (what in state affairs is most essential)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That they as easily might do the youngster,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They err'd, as aged men will do; but by<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And by we 'll talk of that; and if we don't,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T will be because our notion is not high<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of politicians and their double front,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who live by lies, yet dare not boldly lie:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now what I love in women is, they won't<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or can't do otherwise than lie, but do it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So well, the very truth seems falsehood to it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, after all, what is a lie? 'T is but<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The truth in masquerade; and I defy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Historians, heroes, lawyers. priests, to put<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A fact without some leaven of a lie.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very shadow of true Truth would shut<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Up annals, revelations, poesy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And prophecy--except it should be dated<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some years before the incidents related.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Praised be all liars and all lies! Who now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can tax my mild Muse with misanthropy?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She rings the world's 'Te Deum,' and her brow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blushes for those who will not:--but to sigh<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is idle; let us like most others bow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kiss hands, feet, any part of majesty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After the good example of 'Green Erin,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan was presented, and his dress<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And mien excited general admiration--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know which was more admired or less:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One monstrous diamond drew much observation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which Catherine in a moment of 'ivresse'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (In love or brandy's fervent fermentation)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bestow'd upon him, as the public learn'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, to say truth, it had been fairly earn'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides the ministers and underlings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who must be courteous to the accredited<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Diplomatists of rather wavering kings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until their royal riddle's fully read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very clerks,--those somewhat dirty springs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of office, or the house of office, fed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By foul corruption into streams,--even they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were hardly rude enough to earn their pay:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And insolence no doubt is what they are<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Employ'd for, since it is their daily labour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the dear offices of peace or war;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And should you doubt, pray ask of your next neighbour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When for a passport, or some other bar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To freedom, he applied (a grief and a bore),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If he found not his spawn of taxborn riches,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan was received with much 'empressement:'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These phrases of refinement I must borrow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From our next neighbours' land, where, like a chessman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a move set down for joy or sorrow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not only in mere talking, but the press. Man<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In islands is, it seems, downright and thorough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More than on continents--as if the sea<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (See Billingsgate) made even the tongue more free.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet the British 'Damme''s rather Attic:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your continental oaths are but incontinent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And turn on things which no aristocratic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spirit would name, and therefore even I won't anent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This subject quote; as it would be schismatic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In politesse, and have a sound affronting in 't:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But 'Damme''s quite ethereal, though too daring--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Platonic blasphemy, the soul of swearing.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For downright rudeness, ye may stay at home;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For true or false politeness (and scarce that<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now) you may cross the blue deep and white foam--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first the emblem (rarely though) of what<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You leave behind, the next of much you come<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To meet. However, 't is no time to chat<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On general topics: poems must confine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Themselves to unity, like this of mine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the great world,--which, being interpreted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Meaneth the west or worst end of a city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And about twice two thousand people bred<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By no means to be very wise or witty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to sit up while others lie in bed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And look down on the universe with pity,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, as an inveterate patrician,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was well received by persons of condition.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a bachelor, which is a matter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of import both to virgin and to bride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The former's hymeneal hopes to flatter;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And (should she not hold fast by love or pride)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is also of some moment to the latter:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A rib's a thorn in a wed gallant's side,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Requires decorum, and is apt to double<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The horrid sin--and what's still worse, the trouble.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan was a bachelor--of arts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And parts, and hearts: he danced and sung, and had<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An air as sentimental as Mozart's<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Softest of melodies; and could be sad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or cheerful, without any 'flaws or starts,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just at the proper time; and though a lad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had seen the world--which is a curious sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And very much unlike what people write.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fair virgins blush'd upon him; wedded dames<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bloom'd also in less transitory hues;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For both commodities dwell by the Thames,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The painting and the painted; youth, ceruse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Against his heart preferr'd their usual claims,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as no gentleman can quite refuse:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Daughters admired his dress, and pious mothers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Inquired his income, and if he had brothers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The milliners who furnish 'drapery Misses'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout the season, upon speculation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of payment ere the honey-moon's last kisses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have waned into a crescent's coruscation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thought such an opportunity as this is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of a rich foreigner's initiation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not to be overlook'd--and gave such credit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That future bridegrooms swore, and sigh'd, and paid it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Blues, that tender tribe who sigh o'er sonnets,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with the pages of the last Review<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Line the interior of their heads or bonnets,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Advanced in all their azure's highest hue:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They talk'd bad French or Spanish, and upon its<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Late authors ask'd him for a hint or two;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And which was softest, Russian or Castilian?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And whether in his travels he saw Ilion?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, who was a little superficial,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And not in literature a great Drawcansir,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Examined by this learned and especial<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jury of matrons, scarce knew what to answer:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His duties warlike, loving or official,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His steady application as a dancer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had kept him from the brink of Hippocrene,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which now he found was blue instead of green.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, he replied at hazard, with<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A modest confidence and calm assurance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which lent his learned lucubrations pith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pass'd for arguments of good endurance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That prodigy, Miss Araminta Smith<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Who at sixteen translated 'Hercules Furens'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into as furious English), with her best look,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set down his sayings in her common-place book.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan knew several languages--as well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He might--and brought them up with skill, in time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To save his fame with each accomplish'd belle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who still regretted that he did not rhyme.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There wanted but this requisite to swell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His qualities (with them) into sublime:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lady Fitz-Frisky, and Miss Maevia Mannish,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Both long'd extremely to be sung in Spanish.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, he did pretty well, and was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Admitted as an aspirant to all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The coteries, and, as in Banquo's glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At great assemblies or in parties small,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He saw ten thousand living authors pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That being about their average numeral;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also the eighty 'greatest living poets,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As every paltry magazine can show its.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In twice five years the 'greatest living poet,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like to the champion in the fisty ring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is call'd on to support his claim, or show it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although 't is an imaginary thing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even I--albeit I 'm sure I did not know it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor sought of foolscap subjects to be king--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was reckon'd a considerable time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The grand Napoleon of the realms of rhyme.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan was my Moscow, and Faliero<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My Leipsic, and my Mount Saint Jean seems Cain:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'La Belle Alliance' of dunces down at zero,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now that the Lion's fall'n, may rise again:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I will fall at least as fell my hero;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor reign at all, or as a monarch reign;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or to some lonely isle of gaolers go,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With turncoat Southey for my turnkey Lowe.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Walter reign'd before me; Moore and Campbell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before and after; but now grown more holy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Muses upon Sion's hill must ramble<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With poets almost clergymen, or wholly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Pegasus hath a psalmodic amble<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beneath the very Reverend Rowley Powley,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who shoes the glorious animal with stilts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A modern Ancient Pistol--by the hilts?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there's my gentle Euphues, who, they say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sets up for being a sort of moral me;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He 'll find it rather difficult some day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To turn out both, or either, it may be.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some persons think that Coleridge hath the sway;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Wordsworth has supporters, two or three;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that deep-mouth'd Boeotian'savage Landor'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Has taken for a swan rogue Southey's gander.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; John Keats, who was kill'd off by one critique,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as he really promised something great,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If not intelligible, without Greek<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Contrived to talk about the gods of late,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Much as they might have been supposed to speak.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poor fellow! His was an untoward fate;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is strange the mind, that very fiery particle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Should let itself be snuff'd out by an article.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The list grows long of live and dead pretenders<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To that which none will gain--or none will know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The conqueror at least; who, ere Time renders<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His last award, will have the long grass grow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Above his burnt-out brain, and sapless cinders.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I might augur, I should rate but low<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their chances; they 're too numerous, like the thirty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mock tyrants, when Rome's annals wax'd but dirty.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This is the literary lower empire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the praetorian bands take up the matter;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A 'dreadful trade,' like his who 'gathers samphire,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The insolent soldiery to soothe and flatter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the same feelings as you 'd coax a vampire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, were I once at home, and in good satire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'd try conclusions with those Janizaries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And show them what an intellectual war is.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think I know a trick or two, would turn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their flanks;--but it is hardly worth my while<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With such small gear to give myself concern:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed I 've not the necessary bile;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My natural temper's really aught but stern,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And even my Muse's worst reproof's a smile;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then she drops a brief and modern curtsy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And glides away, assured she never hurts ye.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My Juan, whom I left in deadly peril<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst live poets and blue ladies, past<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With some small profit through that field so sterile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being tired in time, and, neither least nor last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Left it before he had been treated very ill;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And henceforth found himself more gaily class'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst the higher spirits of the day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sun's true son, no vapour, but a ray.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His morns he pass'd in business--which, dissected,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was like all business a laborious nothing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That leads to lassitude, the most infected<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Centaur Nessus garb of mortal clothing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And on our sofas makes us lie dejected,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And talk in tender horrors of our loathing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All kinds of toil, save for our country's good--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which grows no better, though 't is time it should.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His afternoons he pass'd in visits, luncheons,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lounging and boxing; and the twilight hour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In riding round those vegetable puncheons<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Call'd 'Parks,' where there is neither fruit nor flower<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Enough to gratify a bee's slight munchings;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But after all it is the only 'bower'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (In Moore's phrase), where the fashionable fair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Can form a slight acquaintance with fresh air.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then dress, then dinner, then awakes the world!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then glare the lamps, then whirl the wheels, then roar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through street and square fast flashing chariots hurl'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like harness'd meteors; then along the floor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Chalk mimics painting; then festoons are twirl'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then roll the brazen thunders of the door,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which opens to the thousand happy few<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An earthly paradise of 'Or Molu.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There stands the noble hostess, nor shall sink<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the three-thousandth curtsy; there the waltz,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The only dance which teaches girls to think,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Makes one in love even with its very faults.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Saloon, room, hall, o'erflow beyond their brink,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And long the latest of arrivals halts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Midst royal dukes and dames condemn'd to climb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And gain an inch of staircase at a time.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thrice happy he who, after a survey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the good company, can win a corner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A door that's in or boudoir out of the way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where he may fix himself like small 'Jack Horner,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And let the Babel round run as it may,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And look on as a mourner, or a scorner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or an approver, or a mere spectator,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yawning a little as the night grows later.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this won't do, save by and by; and he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who, like Don Juan, takes an active share,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must steer with care through all that glittering sea<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of gems and plumes and pearls and silks, to where<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He deems it is his proper place to be;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dissolving in the waltz to some soft air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or proudlier prancing with mercurial skill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where Science marshals forth her own quadrille.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or, if he dance not, but hath higher views<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon an heiress or his neighbour's bride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let him take care that that which he pursues<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is not at once too palpably descried.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Full many an eager gentleman oft rues<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His haste: impatience is a blundering guide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst a people famous for reflection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who like to play the fool with circumspection.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, if you can contrive, get next at supper;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or, if forestalled, get opposite and ogle:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, ye ambrosial moments! always upper<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In mind, a sort of sentimental bogle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which sits for ever upon memory's crupper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ghost of vanish'd pleasures once in vogue! Ill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Can tender souls relate the rise and fall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of hopes and fears which shake a single ball.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But these precautionary hints can touch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only the common run, who must pursue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And watch, and ward; whose plans a word too much<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or little overturns; and not the few<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or many (for the number's sometimes such)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom a good mien, especially if new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or fame, or name, for wit, war, sense, or nonsense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Permits whate'er they please, or did not long since.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our hero, as a hero, young and handsome,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Noble, rich, celebrated, and a stranger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like other slaves of course must pay his ransom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before he can escape from so much danger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As will environ a conspicuous man. Some<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Talk about poetry, and 'rack and manger,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And ugliness, disease, as toil and trouble;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish they knew the life of a young noble.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They are young, but know not youth--it is anticipated;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Handsome but wasted, rich without a sou;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their vigour in a thousand arms is dissipated;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their cash comes from, their wealth goes to a Jew;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Both senates see their nightly votes participated<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between the tyrant's and the tribunes' crew;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And having voted, dined, drunk, gamed, and whored,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The family vault receives another lord.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Where is the world?' cries Young, at eighty--'Where<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The world in which a man was born? 'Alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where is the world of eight years past? 'T was there--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I look for it--'t is gone, a globe of glass!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Crack'd, shiver'd, vanish'd, scarcely gazed on, ere<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A silent change dissolves the glittering mass.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Statesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriots, kings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And dandies, all are gone on the wind's wings.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where is Napoleon the Grand? God knows.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where little Castlereagh? The devil can tell:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where Grattan, Curran, Sheridan, all those<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who bound the bar or senate in their spell?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where is the unhappy Queen, with all her woes?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And where the Daughter, whom the Isles loved well?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where are those martyr'd saints the Five per Cents?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And where--oh, where the devil are the rents?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where's Brummel? Dish'd. Where's Long Pole Wellesley? Diddled.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where's Whitbread? Romilly? Where's George the Third?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where is his will? (That's not so soon unriddled.)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And where is 'Fum' the Fourth, our 'royal bird?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gone down, it seems, to Scotland to be fiddled<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto by Sawney's violin, we have heard:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Caw me, caw thee'--for six months hath been hatching<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This scene of royal itch and loyal scratching.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where is Lord This? And where my Lady That?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Honourable Mistresses and Misses?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some laid aside like an old Opera hat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Married, unmarried, and remarried (this is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An evolution oft performed of late).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where are the Dublin shouts--and London hisses?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where are the Grenvilles? Turn'd as usual. Where<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My friends the Whigs? Exactly where they were.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where are the Lady Carolines and Franceses?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Divorced or doing thereanent. Ye annals<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So brilliant, where the list of routs and dances is,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou Morning Post, sole record of the panels<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Broken in carriages, and all the phantasies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of fashion,--say what streams now fill those channels?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some die, some fly, some languish on the Continent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because the times have hardly left them one tenant.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some who once set their caps at cautious dukes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have taken up at length with younger brothers:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some heiresses have bit at sharpers' hooks:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some maids have been made wives, some merely mothers;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Others have lost their fresh and fairy looks:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In short, the list of alterations bothers.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's little strange in this, but something strange is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The unusual quickness of these common changes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Talk not of seventy years as age; in seven<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen more changes, down from monarchs to<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The humblest individual under heaven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than might suffice a moderate century through.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I knew that nought was lasting, but now even<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Change grows too changeable, without being new:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nought's permanent among the human race,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Except the Whigs not getting into place.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen Napoleon, who seem'd quite a Jupiter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shrink to a Saturn. I have seen a Duke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (No matter which) turn politician stupider,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If that can well be, than his wooden look.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But it is time that I should hoist my 'blue Peter,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sail for a new theme:--I have seen--and shook<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To see it--the king hiss'd, and then caress'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But don't pretend to settle which was best.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen the Landholders without a rap--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen Joanna Southcote--I have seen--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The House of Commons turn'd to a tax-trap--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen that sad affair of the late Queen--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen crowns worn instead of a fool's cap--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen a Congress doing all that's mean--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen some nations like o'erloaded asses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kick off their burthens, meaning the high classes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen small poets, and great prosers, and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interminable--not eternal--speakers--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen the funds at war with house and land--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen the country gentlemen turn squeakers--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen the people ridden o'er like sand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By slaves on horseback--I have seen malt liquors<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exchanged for 'thin potations' by John Bull--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen john half detect himself a fool.--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But 'carpe diem,' Juan, 'carpe, carpe!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To-morrow sees another race as gay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And transient, and devour'd by the same harpy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Life's a poor player,'--then 'play out the play,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye villains!' above all keep a sharp eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Much less on what you do than what you say:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Be hypocritical, be cautious, be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not what you seem, but always what you see.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But how shall I relate in other cantos<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of what befell our hero in the land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which 't is the common cry and lie to vaunt as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A moral country? But I hold my hand--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For I disdain to write an Atalantis;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But 't is as well at once to understand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You are not a moral people, and you know it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without the aid of too sincere a poet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What Juan saw and underwent shall be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My topic, with of course the due restriction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which is required by proper courtesy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And recollect the work is only fiction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that I sing of neither mine nor me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though every scribe, in some slight turn of diction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will hint allusions never meant. Ne'er doubt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This--when I speak, I don't hint, but speak out.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether he married with the third or fourth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Offspring of some sage husband-hunting countess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or whether with some virgin of more worth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (I mean in Fortune's matrimonial bounties)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He took to regularly peopling Earth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which your lawful awful wedlock fount is,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or whether he was taken in for damages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For being too excursive in his homages,--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is yet within the unread events of time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus far, go forth, thou lay, which I will back<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Against the same given quantity of rhyme,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For being as much the subject of attack<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As ever yet was any work sublime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By those who love to say that white is black.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So much the better!--I may stand alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But would not change my free thoughts for a throne.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="axii">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;               CANTO THE TWELFTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; OF all the barbarous middle ages, that<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is most barbarous is the middle age<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of man; it is--I really scarce know what;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But when we hover between fool and sage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And don't know justly what we would be at--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A period something like a printed page,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Black letter upon foolscap, while our hair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Grows grizzled, and we are not what we were;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Too old for youth,--too young, at thirty-five,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To herd with boys, or hoard with good threescore,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wonder people should be left alive;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But since they are, that epoch is a bore:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love lingers still, although 't were late to wive;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And as for other love, the illusion's o'er;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And money, that most pure imagination,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gleams only through the dawn of its creation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O Gold! Why call we misers miserable?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Theirs is the pleasure that can never pall;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Theirs is the best bower anchor, the chain cable<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which holds fast other pleasures great and small.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye who but see the saving man at table,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And scorn his temperate board, as none at all,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wonder how the wealthy can be sparing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Know not what visions spring from each cheese-paring.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love or lust makes man sick, and wine much sicker;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ambition rends, and gaming gains a loss;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But making money, slowly first, then quicker,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And adding still a little through each cross<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Which will come over things), beats love or liquor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gamester's counter, or the statesman's dross.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O Gold! I still prefer thee unto paper,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which makes bank credit like a bank of vapour.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who hold the balance of the world? Who reign<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'er congress, whether royalist or liberal?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who rouse the shirtless patriots of Spain?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (That make old Europe's journals squeak and gibber all.)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who keep the world, both old and new, in pain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or pleasure? Who make politics run glibber all?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The shade of Buonaparte's noble daring?--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jew Rothschild, and his fellow-Christian, Baring.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those, and the truly liberal Lafitte,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are the true lords of Europe. Every loan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is not a merely speculative hit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But seats a nation or upsets a throne.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Republics also get involved a bit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Columbia's stock hath holders not unknown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On 'Change; and even thy silver soil, Peru,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must get itself discounted by a Jew.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why call the miser miserable? as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I said before: the frugal life is his,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which in a saint or cynic ever was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The theme of praise: a hermit would not miss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Canonization for the self-same cause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wherefore blame gaunt wealth's austerities?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because, you 'll say, nought calls for such a trial;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there's more merit in his self-denial.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He is your only poet;--passion, pure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sparkling on from heap to heap, displays,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Possess'd, the ore, of which mere hopes allure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nations athwart the deep: the golden rays<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Flash up in ingots from the mine obscure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On him the diamond pours its brilliant blaze,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While the mild emerald's beam shades down the dies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of other stones, to soothe the miser's eyes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lands on either side are his; the ship<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From Ceylon, Inde, or far Cathay, unloads<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For him the fragrant produce of each trip;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beneath his cars of Ceres groan the roads,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the vine blushes like Aurora's lip;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His very cellars might be kings' abodes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While he, despising every sensual call,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Commands--the intellectual lord of all.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps he hath great projects in his mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To build a college, or to found a race,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A hospital, a church,--and leave behind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some dome surmounted by his meagre face:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps he fain would liberate mankind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even with the very ore which makes them base;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps he would be wealthiest of his nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or revel in the joys of calculation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But whether all, or each, or none of these<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May be the hoarder's principle of action,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fool will call such mania a disease:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is his own? Go--look at each transaction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wars, revels, loves--do these bring men more ease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than the mere plodding through each 'vulgar fraction'?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or do they benefit mankind? Lean miser!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let spendthrifts' heirs enquire of yours--who's wiser?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How beauteous are rouleaus! how charming chests<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Containing ingots, bags of dollars, coins<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Not of old victors, all whose heads and crests<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weigh not the thin ore where their visage shines,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But) of fine unclipt gold, where dully rests<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some likeness, which the glittering cirque confines,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of modern, reigning, sterling, stupid stamp:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes! ready money is Aladdin's lamp.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Love rules the camp, the court, the grove,'--'for love<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is heaven, and heaven is love:'--so sings the bard;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which it were rather difficult to prove<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (A thing with poetry in general hard).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps there may be something in 'the grove,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least it rhymes to 'love;' but I 'm prepared<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To doubt (no less than landlords of their rental)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If 'courts' and 'camps' be quite so sentimental.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But if Love don't, Cash does, and Cash alone:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cash rules the grove, and fells it too besides;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without cash, camps were thin, and courts were none;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without cash, Malthus tells you--'take no brides.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So Cash rules Love the ruler, on his own<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; High ground, as virgin Cynthia sways the tides:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as for Heaven 'Heaven being Love,' why not say honey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is wax? Heaven is not Love, 't is Matrimony.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is not all love prohibited whatever,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Excepting marriage? which is love, no doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a sort; but somehow people never<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the same thought the two words have help'd out:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love may exist with marriage, and should ever,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And marriage also may exist without;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But love sans bans is both a sin and shame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And ought to go by quite another name.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now if the 'court,' and 'camp,' and 'grove,' be not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recruited all with constant married men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who never coveted their neighbour's lot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say that line's a lapsus of the pen;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Strange too in my 'buon camerado' Scott,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So celebrated for his morals, when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My Jeffrey held him up as an example<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To me;--of whom these morals are a sample.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, if I don't succeed, I have succeeded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that's enough; succeeded in my youth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The only time when much success is needed:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And my success produced what I, in sooth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Cared most about; it need not now be pleaded--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er it was, 't was mine; I 've paid, in truth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of late the penalty of such success,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But have not learn'd to wish it any less.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That suit in Chancery,--which some persons plead<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In an appeal to the unborn, whom they,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the faith of their procreative creed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Baptize posterity, or future clay,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To me seems but a dubious kind of reed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lean on for support in any way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since odds are that posterity will know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No more of them, than they of her, I trow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why, I 'm posterity--and so are you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And whom do we remember? Not a hundred.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were every memory written down all true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tenth or twentieth name would be but blunder'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even Plutarch's Lives have but pick'd out a few,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And 'gainst those few your annalists have thunder'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Mitford in the nineteenth century<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gives, with Greek truth, the good old Greek the lie.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Good people all, of every degree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ye gentle readers and ungentle writers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this twelfth Canto 't is my wish to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As serious as if I had for inditers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Malthus and Wilberforce:--the last set free<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Negroes and is worth a million fighters;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While Wellington has but enslaved the Whites,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Malthus does the thing 'gainst which he writes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm serious--so are all men upon paper;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And why should I not form my speculation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hold up to the sun my little taper?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mankind just now seem wrapt in mediation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On constitutions and steam-boats of vapour;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While sages write against all procreation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless a man can calculate his means<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of feeding brats the moment his wife weans.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That's noble! That's romantic! For my part,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think that 'Philo-genitiveness' is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Now here's a word quite after my own heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though there's a shorter a good deal than this,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If that politeness set it not apart;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I 'm resolved to say nought that's amiss)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I say, methinks that 'Philo-genitiveness'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Might meet from men a little more forgiveness.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now to business.--O my gentle Juan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art in London--in that pleasant place,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where every kind of mischief's daily brewing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which can await warm youth in its wild race.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is true, that thy career is not a new one;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art no novice in the headlong chase<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of early life; but this is a new land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which foreigners can never understand.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What with a small diversity of climate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of hot or cold, mercurial or sedate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I could send forth my mandate like a primate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the rest of Europe's social state;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But thou art the most difficult to rhyme at,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Great Britain, which the Muse may penetrate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All countries have their 'Lions,' but in the<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is but one superb menagerie.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I am sick of politics. Begin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Paulo Majora.' Juan, undecided<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst the paths of being 'taken in,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Above the ice had like a skater glided:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When tired of play, he flirted without sin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With some of those fair creatures who have prided<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Themselves on innocent tantalisation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hate all vice except its reputation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But these are few, and in the end they make<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some devilish escapade or stir, which shows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That even the purest people may mistake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their way through virtue's primrose paths of snows;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then men stare, as if a new ass spake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Balaam, and from tongue to ear o'erflows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quicksilver small talk, ending (if you note it)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the kind world's amen--'Who would have thought it?'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The little Leila, with her orient eyes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And taciturn Asiatic disposition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Which saw all western things with small surprise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the surprise of people of condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who think that novelties are butterflies<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be pursued as food for inanition),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her charming figure and romantic history<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Became a kind of fashionable mystery.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The women much divided--as is usual<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst the sex in little things or great.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Think not, fair creatures, that I mean to abuse you all--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have always liked you better than I state:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since I 've grown moral, still I must accuse you all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of being apt to talk at a great rate;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now there was a general sensation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst you, about Leila's education.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In one point only were you settled--and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You had reason; 't was that a young child of grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As beautiful as her own native land,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And far away, the last bud of her race,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Howe'er our friend Don Juan might command<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Himself for five, four, three, or two years' space,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would be much better taught beneath the eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of peeresses whose follies had run dry.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So first there was a generous emulation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then there was a general competition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To undertake the orphan's education.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Juan was a person of condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It had been an affront on this occasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To talk of a subscription or petition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But sixteen dowagers, ten unwed she sages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose tale belongs to 'Hallam's Middle Ages,'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And one or two sad, separate wives, without<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A fruit to bloom upon their withering bough--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Begg'd to bring up the little girl and 'out,'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For that's the phrase that settles all things now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meaning a virgin's first blush at a rout,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all her points as thorough-bred to show:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I assure you, that like virgin honey<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tastes their first season (mostly if they have money).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How all the needy honourable misters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each out-at-elbow peer, or desperate dandy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The watchful mothers, and the careful sisters<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Who, by the by, when clever, are more handy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At making matches, where ''t is gold that glisters,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than their he relatives), like flies o'er candy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Buzz round 'the Fortune' with their busy battery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To turn her head with waltzing and with flattery!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each aunt, each cousin, hath her speculation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nay, married dames will now and then discover<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such pure disinterestedness of passion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 've known them court an heiress for their lover.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Tantaene!' Such the virtues of high station,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even in the hopeful Isle, whose outlet's 'Dover!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While the poor rich wretch, object of these cares,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Has cause to wish her sire had had male heirs.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some are soon bagg'd, and some reject three dozen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is fine to see them scattering refusals<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wild dismay o'er every angry cousin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Friends of the party), who begin accusals,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such as--'Unless Miss (Blank) meant to have chosen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poor Frederick, why did she accord perusals<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To his billets? Why waltz with him? Why, I pray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Look yes last night, and yet say no to-day?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Why?--Why?--Besides, Fred really was attach'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was not her fortune--he has enough without:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The time will come she 'll wish that she had snatch'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So good an opportunity, no doubt:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the old marchioness some plan had hatch'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I 'll tell Aurea at to-morrow's rout:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And after all poor Frederick may do better--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pray did you see her answer to his letter?'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Smart uniforms and sparkling coronets<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are spurn'd in turn, until her turn arrives,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After male loss of time, and hearts, and bets<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the sweepstakes for substantial wives;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when at last the pretty creature gets<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some gentleman, who fights, or writes, or drives,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It soothes the awkward squad of the rejected<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To find how very badly she selected.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For sometimes they accept some long pursuer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Worn out with importunity; or fall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (But here perhaps the instances are fewer)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the lot of him who scarce pursued at all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A hazy widower turn'd of forty's sure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (If 't is not vain examples to recall)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To draw a high prize: now, howe'er he got her, I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; See nought more strange in this than t' other lottery.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I, for my part (one 'modern instance' more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'True, 't is a pity--pity 't is, 't is true'),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was chosen from out an amatory score,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Albeit my years were less discreet than few;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But though I also had reform'd before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those became one who soon were to be two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll not gainsay the generous public's voice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That the young lady made a monstrous choice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, pardon my digression--or at least<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peruse! 'T is always with a moral end<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That I dissert, like grace before a feast:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For like an aged aunt, or tiresome friend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A rigid guardian, or a zealous priest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My Muse by exhortation means to mend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All people, at all times, and in most places,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which puts my Pegasus to these grave paces.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now I 'm going to be immoral; now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I mean to show things really as they are,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not as they ought to be: for I avow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That till we see what's what in fact, we 're far<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From much improvement with that virtuous plough<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which skims the surface, leaving scarce a scar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the black loam long manured by Vice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Only to keep its corn at the old price.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But first of little Leila we 'll dispose;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For like a day-dawn she was young and pure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or like the old comparison of snows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which are more pure than pleasant to be sure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like many people everybody knows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan was delighted to secure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A goodly guardian for his infant charge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who might not profit much by being at large.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, he had found out he was no tutor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (I wish that others would find out the same);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And rather wish'd in such things to stand neuter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For silly wards will bring their guardians blame:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So when he saw each ancient dame a suitor<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make his little wild Asiatic tame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Consulting 'the Society for Vice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suppression,' Lady Pinchbeck was his choice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Olden she was--but had been very young;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Virtuous she was--and had been, I believe;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although the world has such an evil tongue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That--but my chaster ear will not receive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An echo of a syllable that's wrong:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, there's nothing makes me so much grieve,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As that abominable tittle-tattle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which is the cud eschew'd by human cattle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover I 've remark'd (and I was once<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A slight observer in a modest way),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so may every one except a dunce,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That ladies in their youth a little gay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides their knowledge of the world, and sense<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the sad consequence of going astray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are wiser in their warnings 'gainst the woe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which the mere passionless can never know.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While the harsh prude indemnifies her virtue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By railing at the unknown and envied passion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeking far less to save you than to hurt you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or, what's still worse, to put you out of fashion,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The kinder veteran with calm words will court you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Entreating you to pause before you dash on;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Expounding and illustrating the riddle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of epic Love's beginning, end, and middle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now whether it be thus, or that they are stricter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As better knowing why they should be so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think you 'll find from many a family picture,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That daughters of such mothers as may know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world by experience rather than by lecture,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turn out much better for the Smithfield Show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of vestals brought into the marriage mart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than those bred up by prudes without a heart.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I said that Lady Pinchbeck had been talk'd about--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As who has not, if female, young, and pretty?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now no more the ghost of Scandal stalk'd about;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She merely was deem'd amiable and witty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And several of her best bon-mots were hawk'd about:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then she was given to charity and pity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And pass'd (at least the latter years of life)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For being a most exemplary wife.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; High in high circles, gentle in her own,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was the mild reprover of the young,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whenever--which means every day--they 'd shown<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An awkward inclination to go wrong.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The quantity of good she did's unknown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or at the least would lengthen out my song:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In brief, the little orphan of the East<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had raised an interest in her, which increased.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, too, was a sort of favourite with her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because she thought him a good heart at bottom,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A little spoil'd, but not so altogether;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which was a wonder, if you think who got him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how he had been toss'd, he scarce knew whither:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though this might ruin others, it did not him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At least entirely--for he had seen too many<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Changes in youth, to be surprised at any.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And these vicissitudes tell best in youth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For when they happen at a riper age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; People are apt to blame the Fates, forsooth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wonder Providence is not more sage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Adversity is the first path to truth:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He who hath proved war, storm, or woman's rage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether his winters be eighteen or eighty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hath won the experience which is deem'd so weighty.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How far it profits is another matter.--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our hero gladly saw his little charge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Safe with a lady, whose last grown-up daughter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being long married, and thus set at large,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had left all the accomplishments she taught her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be transmitted, like the Lord Mayor's barge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the next comer; or--as it will tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More Muse-like--like to Cytherea's shell.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I call such things transmission; for there is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A floating balance of accomplishment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which forms a pedigree from Miss to Miss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; According as their minds or backs are bent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some waltz; some draw; some fathom the abyss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of metaphysics; others are content<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With music; the most moderate shine as wits;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While others have a genius turn'd for fits.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But whether fits, or wits, or harpsichords,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Theology, fine arts, or finer stays,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May be the baits for gentlemen or lords<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With regular descent, in these our days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The last year to the new transfers its hoards;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New vestals claim men's eyes with the same praise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of 'elegant' et caetera, in fresh batches--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All matchless creatures, and yet bent on matches.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now I will begin my poem. 'T is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps a little strange, if not quite new,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That from the first of Cantos up to this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 've not begun what we have to go through.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These first twelve books are merely flourishes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Preludios, trying just a string or two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon my lyre, or making the pegs sure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when so, you shall have the overture.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My Muses do not care a pinch of rosin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About what's call'd success, or not succeeding:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such thoughts are quite below the strain they have chosen;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is a 'great moral lesson' they are reading.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I thought, at setting off, about two dozen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cantos would do; but at Apollo's pleading,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If that my Pegasus should not be founder'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think to canter gently through a hundred.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan saw that microcosm on stilts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yclept the Great World; for it is the least,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although the highest: but as swords have hilts<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By which their power of mischief is increased,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When man in battle or in quarrel tilts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus the low world, north, south, or west, or east,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must still obey the high--which is their handle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their moon, their sun, their gas, their farthing candle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had many friends who had many wives, and was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well look'd upon by both, to that extent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of friendship which you may accept or pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It does nor good nor harm being merely meant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To keep the wheels going of the higher class,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And draw them nightly when a ticket's sent:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And what with masquerades, and fetes, and balls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the first season such a life scarce palls.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A young unmarried man, with a good name<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And fortune, has an awkward part to play;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For good society is but a game,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The royal game of Goose,' as I may say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where every body has some separate aim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An end to answer, or a plan to lay--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The single ladies wishing to be double,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The married ones to save the virgins trouble.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't mean this as general, but particular<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Examples may be found of such pursuits:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though several also keep their perpendicular<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like poplars, with good principles for roots;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet many have a method more reticular--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Fishers for men,' like sirens with soft lutes:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For talk six times with the same single lady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And you may get the wedding dresses ready.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps you 'll have a letter from the mother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To say her daughter's feelings are trepann'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps you 'll have a visit from the brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All strut, and stays, and whiskers, to demand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What 'your intentions are?'--One way or other<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It seems the virgin's heart expects your hand:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And between pity for her case and yours,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 'll add to Matrimony's list of cures.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've known a dozen weddings made even thus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some of them high names: I have also known<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Young men who--though they hated to discuss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pretensions which they never dream'd to have shown--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet neither frighten'd by a female fuss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor by mustachios moved, were let alone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And lived, as did the broken-hearted fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In happier plight than if they form'd a pair.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's also nightly, to the uninitiated,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A peril--not indeed like love or marriage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But not the less for this to be depreciated:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is--I meant and mean not to disparage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The show of virtue even in the vitiated--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It adds an outward grace unto their carriage--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to denounce the amphibious sort of harlot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Couleur de rose,' who's neither white nor scarlet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such is your cold coquette, who can't say 'No,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And won't say 'Yes,' and keeps you on and off-ing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On a lee-shore, till it begins to blow--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then sees your heart wreck'd, with an inward scoffing.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This works a world of sentimental woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sends new Werters yearly to their coffin;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But yet is merely innocent flirtation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not quite adultery, but adulteration.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Ye gods, I grow a talker!' Let us prate.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next of perils, though I place it sternest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is when, without regard to 'church or state,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A wife makes or takes love in upright earnest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Abroad, such things decide few women's fate--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Such, early traveller! is the truth thou learnest)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in old England, when a young bride errs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Poor thing! Eve's was a trifling case to hers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For 't is a low, newspaper, humdrum, lawsuit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Country, where a young couple of the same ages<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Can't form a friendship, but the world o'erawes it.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A verdict--grievous foe to those who cause it!--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forms a sad climax to romantic homages;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides those soothing speeches of the pleaders,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And evidences which regale all readers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But they who blunder thus are raw beginners;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little genial sprinkling of hypocrisy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Has saved the fame of thousand splendid sinners,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The loveliest oligarchs of our gynocracy;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You may see such at all the balls and dinners,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Among the proudest of our aristocracy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So gentle, charming, charitable, chaste--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all by having tact as well as taste.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan, who did not stand in the predicament<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of a mere novice, had one safeguard more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For he was sick--no, 't was not the word sick I meant--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But he had seen so much love before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That he was not in heart so very weak;--I meant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But thus much, and no sneer against the shore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of white cliffs, white necks, blue eyes, bluer stockings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tithes, taxes, duns, and doors with double knockings.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But coming young from lands and scenes romantic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where lives, not lawsuits, must be risk'd for Passion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Passion's self must have a spice of frantic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into a country where 't is half a fashion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seem'd to him half commercial, half pedantic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Howe'er he might esteem this moral nation:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides (alas! his taste--forgive and pity!)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At first he did not think the women pretty.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I say at first--for he found out at last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But by degrees, that they were fairer far<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than the more glowing dames whose lot is cast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beneath the influence of the eastern star.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A further proof we should not judge in haste;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet inexperience could not be his bar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To taste:--the truth is, if men would confess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That novelties please less than they impress.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though travell'd, I have never had the luck to<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trace up those shuffling negroes, Nile or Niger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To that impracticable place, Timbuctoo,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where Geography finds no one to oblige her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With such a chart as may be safely stuck to--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Europe ploughs in Afric like 'bos piger:'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But if I had been at Timbuctoo, there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt I should be told that black is fair.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is. I will not swear that black is white;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I suspect in fact that white is black,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the whole matter rests upon eyesight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ask a blind man, the best judge. You 'll attack<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps this new position--but I 'm right;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or if I 'm wrong, I 'll not be ta'en aback:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He hath no morn nor night, but all is dark<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Within; and what seest thou? A dubious spark.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I 'm relapsing into metaphysics,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That labyrinth, whose clue is of the same<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Construction as your cures for hectic phthisics,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those bright moths fluttering round a dying flame;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And this reflection brings me to plain physics,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And to the beauties of a foreign dame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Compared with those of our pure pearls of price,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those polar summers, all sun, and some ice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or say they are like virtuous mermaids, whose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beginnings are fair faces, ends mere fishes;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not that there's not a quantity of those<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who have a due respect for their own wishes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Russians rushing from hot baths to snows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are they, at bottom virtuous even when vicious:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They warm into a scrape, but keep of course,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a reserve, a plunge into remorse.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this has nought to do with their outsides.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I said that Juan did not think them pretty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the first blush; for a fair Briton hides<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Half her attractions--probably from pity--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And rather calmly into the heart glides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than storms it as a foe would take a city;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But once there (if you doubt this, prithee try)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She keeps it for you like a true ally.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She cannot step as does an Arab barb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or Andalusian girl from mass returning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor wear as gracefully as Gauls her garb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor in her eye Ausonia's glance is burning;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her voice, though sweet, is not so fit to warb--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; le those bravuras (which I still am learning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To like, though I have been seven years in Italy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And have, or had, an ear that served me prettily);--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She cannot do these things, nor one or two<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Others, in that off-hand and dashing style<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which takes so much--to give the devil his due;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor is she quite so ready with her smile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor settles all things in one interview<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (A thing approved as saving time and toil);--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But though the soil may give you time and trouble,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Well cultivated, it will render double.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if in fact she takes to a 'grande passion,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is a very serious thing indeed:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nine times in ten 't is but caprice or fashion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Coquetry, or a wish to take the lead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The pride of a mere child with a new sash on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or wish to make a rival's bosom bleed:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the tenth instance will be a tornado,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For there's no saying what they will or may do.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The reason's obvious; if there's an eclat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They lose their caste at once, as do the Parias;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when the delicacies of the law<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have fill'd their papers with their comments various,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Society, that china without flaw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (The hypocrite!), will banish them like Marius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To sit amidst the ruins of their guilt:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Fame's a Carthage not so soon rebuilt.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps this is as it should be;--it is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A comment on the Gospel's'sin no more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And be thy sins forgiven:'--but upon this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I leave the saints to settle their own score.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Abroad, though doubtless they do much amiss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An erring woman finds an opener door<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For her return to Virtue--as they cal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That lady, who should be at home to all.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For me, I leave the matter where I find it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Knowing that such uneasy virtue leads<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; People some ten times less in fact to mind it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And care but for discoveries and not deeds.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as for chastity, you 'll never bind it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By all the laws the strictest lawyer pleads,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But aggravate the crime you have not prevented,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By rendering desperate those who had else repented.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan was no casuist, nor had ponder'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the moral lessons of mankind:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, he had not seen of several hundred<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lady altogether to his mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A little 'blase'--'t is not to be wonder'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At, that his heart had got a tougher rind:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And though not vainer from his past success,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt his sensibilities were less.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He also had been busy seeing sights--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Parliament and all the other houses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had sat beneath the gallery at nights,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hear debates whose thunder roused (not rouses)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world to gaze upon those northern lights<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which flash'd as far as where the musk-bull browses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had also stood at times behind the throne--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Grey was not arrived, and Chatham gone.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He saw, however, at the closing session,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That noble sight, when really free the nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A king in constitutional possession<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of such a throne as is the proudest station,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though despots know it not--till the progression<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of freedom shall complete their education.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is not mere splendour makes the show august<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To eye or heart--it is the people's trust.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There, too, he saw (whate'er he may be now)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A Prince, the prince of princes at the time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With fascination in his very bow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And full of promise, as the spring of prime.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though royalty was written on his brow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had then the grace, too, rare in every clime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of being, without alloy of fop or beau,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A finish'd gentleman from top to toe.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan was received, as hath been said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into the best society: and there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Occurr'd what often happens, I 'm afraid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However disciplined and debonnaire:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The talent and good humour he display'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides the mark'd distinction of his air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exposed him, as was natural, to temptation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even though himself avoided the occasion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what, and where, with whom, and when, and why,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is not to be put hastily together;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as my object is morality<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Whatever people say), I don't know whether<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll leave a single reader's eyelid dry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But harrow up his feelings till they wither,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hew out a huge monument of pathos,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As Philip's son proposed to do with Athos.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here the twelfth Canto of our introduction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ends. When the body of the book's begun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 'll find it of a different construction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From what some people say 't will be when done:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The plan at present's simply in concoction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I can't oblige you, reader, to read on;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That's your affair, not mine: a real spirit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Should neither court neglect, nor dread to bear it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if my thunderbolt not always rattles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember, reader! you have had before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The worst of tempests and the best of battles<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That e'er were brew'd from elements or gore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides the most sublime of--Heaven knows what else:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An usurer could scarce expect much more--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But my best canto, save one on astronomy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will turn upon 'political economy.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is your present theme for popularity:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now that the public hedge hath scarce a stake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It grows an act of patriotic charity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To show the people the best way to break.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My plan (but I, if but for singularity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reserve it) will be very sure to take.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meantime, read all the national debt-sinkers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And tell me what you think of your great thinkers.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="axiii">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;            CANTO THE THIRTEENTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I NOW mean to be serious;--it is time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since laughter now-a-days is deem'd too serious.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A jest at Vice by Virtue's call'd a crime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And critically held as deleterious:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, the sad's a source of the sublime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although when long a little apt to weary us;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore shall my lay soar high and solemn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As an old temple dwindled to a column.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Lady Adeline Amundeville<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ('T is an old Norman name, and to be found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In pedigrees, by those who wander still<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Along the last fields of that Gothic ground)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was high-born, wealthy by her father's will,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And beauteous, even where beauties most abound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Britain--which of course true patriots find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The goodliest soil of body and of mind.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll not gainsay them; it is not my cue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll leave them to their taste, no doubt the best:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An eye's an eye, and whether black or blue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is no great matter, so 't is in request,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is nonsense to dispute about a hue--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The kindest may be taken as a test.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fair sex should be always fair; and no man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till thirty, should perceive there's a plain woman.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And after that serene and somewhat dull<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Epoch, that awkward corner turn'd for days<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More quiet, when our moon's no more at full,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We may presume to criticise or praise;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because indifference begins to lull<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our passions, and we walk in wisdom's ways;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also because the figure and the face<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hint, that 't is time to give the younger place.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I know that some would fain postpone this era,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reluctant as all placemen to resign<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their post; but theirs is merely a chimera,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For they have pass'd life's equinoctial line:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then they have their claret and Madeira<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To irrigate the dryness of decline;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And county meetings, and the parliament,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And debt, and what not, for their solace sent.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And is there not religion, and reform,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peace, war, the taxes, and what's call'd the 'Nation'?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The struggle to be pilots in a storm?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The landed and the monied speculation?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The joys of mutual hate to keep them warm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of love, that mere hallucination?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rough Johnson, the great moralist, profess'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right honestly, 'he liked an honest hater!'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The only truth that yet has been confest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within these latest thousand years or later.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the fine old fellow spoke in jest:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my part, I am but a mere spectator,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And gaze where'er the palace or the hovel is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Much in the mode of Goethe's Mephistopheles;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But neither love nor hate in much excess;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though 't was not once so. If I sneer sometimes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is because I cannot well do less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now and then it also suits my rhymes.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I should be very willing to redress<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men's wrongs, and rather check than punish crimes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had not Cervantes, in that too true tale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Quixote, shown how all such efforts fail.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all tales 't is the saddest--and more sad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because it makes us smile: his hero's right,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And still pursues the right;--to curb the bad<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His only object, and 'gainst odds to fight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His guerdon: 't is his virtue makes him mad!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But his adventures form a sorry sight;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sorrier still is the great moral taught<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By that real epic unto all who have thought.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Redressing injury, revenging wrong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To aid the damsel and destroy the caitiff;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Opposing singly the united strong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From foreign yoke to free the helpless native:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! must noblest views, like an old song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be for mere fancy's sport a theme creative,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A jest, a riddle, Fame through thin and thick sought!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Socrates himself but Wisdom's Quixote?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Cervantes smiled Spain's chivalry away;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A single laugh demolish'd the right arm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of his own country;--seldom since that day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has Spain had heroes. While Romance could charm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world gave ground before her bright array;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore have his volumes done such harm,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That all their glory, as a composition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was dearly purchased by his land's perdition.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm 'at my old lunes'--digression, and forget<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Lady Adeline Amundeville;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fair most fatal Juan ever met,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although she was not evil nor meant ill;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Destiny and Passion spread the net<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Fate is a good excuse for our own will),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And caught them;--what do they not catch, methinks?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I 'm not OEdipus, and life's a Sphinx.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I tell the tale as it is told, nor dare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To venture a solution: 'Davus sum!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now I will proceed upon the pair.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sweet Adeline, amidst the gay world's hum,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was the Queen-Bee, the glass of all that's fair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose charms made all men speak, and women dumb.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The last's a miracle, and such was reckon'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And since that time there has not been a second.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Chaste was she, to detraction's desperation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wedded unto one she had loved well--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A man known in the councils of the nation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cool, and quite English, imperturbable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though apt to act with fire upon occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Proud of himself and her: the world could tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nought against either, and both seem'd secure--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She in her virtue, he in his hauteur.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It chanced some diplomatical relations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arising out of business, often brought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Himself and Juan in their mutual stations<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into close contact. Though reserved, nor caught<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By specious seeming, Juan's youth, and patience,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And talent, on his haughty spirit wrought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And form'd a basis of esteem, which ends<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In making men what courtesy calls friends.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus Lord Henry, who was cautious as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reserve and pride could make him, and full slow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In judging men--when once his judgment was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Determined, right or wrong, on friend or foe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had all the pertinacity pride has,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which knows no ebb to its imperious flow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And loves or hates, disdaining to be guided,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because its own good pleasure hath decided.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His friendships, therefore, and no less aversions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though oft well founded, which confirm'd but more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His prepossessions, like the laws of Persians<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Medes, would ne'er revoke what went before.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His feelings had not those strange fits, like tertians,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of common likings, which make some deplore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What they should laugh at--the mere ague still<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of men's regard, the fever or the chill.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ''T is not in mortals to command success:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But do you more, Sempronius--don't deserve it,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And take my word, you won't have any less.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be wary, watch the time, and always serve it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Give gently way, when there's too great a press;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for your conscience, only learn to nerve it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For, like a racer, or a boxer training,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T will make, if proved, vast efforts without paining.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry also liked to be superior,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As most men do, the little or the great;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very lowest find out an inferior,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least they think so, to exert their state<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon: for there are very few things wearier<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than solitary Pride's oppressive weight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which mortals generously would divide,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By bidding others carry while they ride.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In birth, in rank, in fortune likewise equal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'er Juan he could no distinction claim;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In years he had the advantage of time's sequel;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, as he thought, in country much the same--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because bold Britons have a tongue and free quill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At which all modern nations vainly aim;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the Lord Henry was a great debater,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that few members kept the house up later.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These were advantages: and then he thought--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was his foible, but by no means sinister--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That few or none more than himself had caught<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Court mysteries, having been himself a minister:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He liked to teach that which he had been taught,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And greatly shone whenever there had been a stir;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And reconciled all qualities which grace man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Always a patriot, and sometimes a placeman.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He liked the gentle Spaniard for his gravity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He almost honour'd him for his docility;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because, though young, he acquiesced with suavity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or contradicted but with proud humility.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He knew the world, and would not see depravity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In faults which sometimes show the soil's fertility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If that the weeds o'erlive not the first crop--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For then they are very difficult to stop.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then he talk'd with him about Madrid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Constantinople, and such distant places;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where people always did as they were bid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or did what they should not with foreign graces.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of coursers also spake they: Henry rid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, like most Englishmen, and loved the races;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan, like a true-born Andalusian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could back a horse, as despots ride a Russian.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus acquaintance grew, at noble routs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And diplomatic dinners, or at other--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Juan stood well both with Ins and Outs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As in freemasonry a higher brother.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon his talent Henry had no doubts;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His manner show'd him sprung from a high mother;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And all men like to show their hospitality<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To him whose breeding matches with his quality.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At Blank-Blank Square;--for we will break no squares<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By naming streets: since men are so censorious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And apt to sow an author's wheat with tares,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reaping allusions private and inglorious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where none were dreamt of, unto love's affairs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which were, or are, or are to be notorious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That therefore do I previously declare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry's mansion was in Blank-Blank Square.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also there bin another pious reason<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For making squares and streets anonymous;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which is, that there is scarce a single season<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which doth not shake some very splendid house<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With some slight heart-quake of domestic treason--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A topic scandal doth delight to rouse:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such I might stumble over unawares,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless I knew the very chastest squares.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is true, I might have chosen Piccadilly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A place where peccadillos are unknown;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I have motives, whether wise or silly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For letting that pure sanctuary alone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore I name not square, street, place, until I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Find one where nothing naughty can be shown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A vestal shrine of innocence of heart:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At Henry's mansion then, in Blank-Blank Square,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was Juan a recherche, welcome guest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As many other noble scions were;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And some who had but talent for their crest;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or wealth, which is a passport every where;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or even mere fashion, which indeed's the best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Recommendation; and to be well drest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will very often supersede the rest.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And since 'there's safety in a multitude<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of counsellors,' as Solomon has said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or some one for him, in some sage, grave mood;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed we see the daily proof display'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In senates, at the bar, in wordy feud,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where'er collective wisdom can parade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which is the only cause that we can guess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Britain's present wealth and happiness;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as 'there's safety' grafted in the number<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Of counsellors' for men, thus for the sex<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A large acquaintance lets not Virtue slumber;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or should it shake, the choice will more perplex--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Variety itself will more encumber.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Midst many rocks we guard more against wrecks;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus with women: howsoe'er it shocks some's<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Self-love, there's safety in a crowd of coxcombs.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Adeline had not the least occasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For such a shield, which leaves but little merit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To virtue proper, or good education.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her chief resource was in her own high spirit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which judged mankind at their due estimation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for coquetry, she disdain'd to wear it:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Secure of admiration, its impression<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was faint, as of an every-day possession.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To all she was polite without parade;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To some she show'd attention of that kind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which flatters, but is flattery convey'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In such a sort as cannot leave behind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A trace unworthy either wife or maid;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A gentle, genial courtesy of mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To those who were, or pass'd for meritorious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just to console sad glory for being glorious;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which is in all respects, save now and then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A dull and desolate appendage. Gaze<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the shades of those distinguish'd men<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who were or are the puppet-shows of praise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The praise of persecution; gaze again<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the most favour'd; and amidst the blaze<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of sunset halos o'er the laurel-brow'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What can ye recognise?--a gilded cloud.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There also was of course in Adeline<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That calm patrician polish in the address,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of any thing which nature would express;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least his manner suffers not to guess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That any thing he views can greatly please.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps we have borrow'd this from the Chinese--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps from Horace: his 'Nil admirari'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was what he call'd the 'Art of Happiness;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An art on which the artists greatly vary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And have not yet attain'd to much success.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, 't is expedient to be wary:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indifference certes don't produce distress;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And rash enthusiasm in good society<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were nothing but a moral inebriety.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Adeline was not indifferent: for<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Now for a common-place!) beneath the snow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a volcano holds the lava more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within--et caetera. Shall I go on?--No!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I hate to hunt down a tired metaphor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So let the often-used volcano go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Poor thing! How frequently, by me and others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It hath been stirr'd up till its smoke quite smothers!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 'll have another figure in a trice:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What say you to a bottle of champagne?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Frozen into a very vinous ice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet in the very centre, past all price,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About a liquid glassful will remain;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And this is stronger than the strongest grape<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could e'er express in its expanded shape:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A hidden nectar under a cold presence.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And such are many--though I only meant her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From whom I now deduce these moral lessons,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On which the Muse has always sought to enter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And your cold people are beyond all price,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When once you have broken their confounded ice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But after all they are a North-West Passage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unto the glowing India of the soul;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as the good ships sent upon that message<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have not exactly ascertain'd the Pole<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Though Parry's efforts look a lucky presage),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus gentlemen may run upon a shoal;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For if the Pole's not open, but all frost<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (A chance still), 't is a voyage or vessel lost.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And young beginners may as well commence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With quiet cruising o'er the ocean woman;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While those who are not beginners should have sense<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enough to make for port, ere time shall summon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With his grey signal-flag; and the past tense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dreary 'Fuimus' of all things human,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must be declined, while life's thin thread's spun out<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Between the gaping heir and gnawing gout.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But heaven must be diverted; its diversion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is sometimes truculent--but never mind:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world upon the whole is worth the assertion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (If but for comfort) that all things are kind:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that same devilish doctrine of the Persian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the two principles, but leaves behind<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As many doubts as any other doctrine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Has ever puzzled Faith withal, or yoked her in.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The English winter--ending in July,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To recommence in August--now was done.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is the postilion's paradise: wheels fly;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On roads, east, south, north, west, there is a run.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But for post-horses who finds sympathy?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Man's pity's for himself, or for his son,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Always premising that said son at college<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Has not contracted much more debt than knowledge.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The London winter's ended in July--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes a little later. I don't err<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this: whatever other blunders lie<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon my shoulders, here I must aver<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My Muse a glass of weatherology;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For parliament is our barometer:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let radicals its other acts attack,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its sessions form our only almanack.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When its quicksilver's down at zero,--lo<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Coach, chariot, luggage, baggage, equipage!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wheels whirl from Carlton palace to Soho,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And happiest they who horses can engage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The turnpikes glow with dust; and Rotten Row<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sleeps from the chivalry of this bright age;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And tradesmen, with long bills and longer faces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sigh--as the postboys fasten on the traces.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They and their bills, 'Arcadians both,' are left<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the Greek kalends of another session.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! to them of ready cash bereft,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What hope remains? Of hope the full possession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or generous draft, conceded as a gift,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At a long date--till they can get a fresh one--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hawk'd about at a discount, small or large;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also the solace of an overcharge.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But these are trifles. Downward flies my lord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nodding beside my lady in his carriage.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Away! away! 'Fresh horses!' are the word,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And changed as quickly as hearts after marriage;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The obsequious landlord hath the change restored;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The postboys have no reason to disparage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their fee; but ere the water'd wheels may hiss hence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ostler pleads too for a reminiscence.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is granted; and the valet mounts the dickey--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That gentleman of lords and gentlemen;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also my lady's gentlewoman, tricky,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Trick'd out, but modest more than poet's pen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Can paint,--'Cosi viaggino i Ricchi!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Excuse a foreign slipslop now and then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If but to show I 've travell'd; and what's travel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless it teaches one to quote and cavil?)<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The London winter and the country summer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were well nigh over. 'T is perhaps a pity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When nature wears the gown that doth become her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To lose those best months in a sweaty city,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wait until the nightingale grows dumber,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Listening debates not very wise or witty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ere patriots their true country can remember;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But there's no shooting (save grouse) till September.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've done with my tirade. The world was gone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The twice two thousand, for whom earth was made,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were vanish'd to be what they call alone--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is, with thirty servants for parade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As many guests, or more; before whom groan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As many covers, duly, daily, laid.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let none accuse Old England's hospitality--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its quantity is but condensed to quality.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry and the Lady Adeline<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Departed like the rest of their compeers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The peerage, to a mansion very fine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Gothic Babel of a thousand years.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; None than themselves could boast a longer line,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where time through heroes and through beauties steers;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And oaks as olden as their pedigree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Told of their sires, a tomb in every tree.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A paragraph in every paper told<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of their departure: such is modern fame:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is pity that it takes no farther hold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than an advertisement, or much the same;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When, ere the ink be dry, the sound grows cold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Morning Post was foremost to proclaim--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Departure, for his country seat, to-day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lord H. Amundeville and Lady A.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'We understand the splendid host intends<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To entertain, this autumn, a select<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And numerous party of his noble friends;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Midst whom we have heard, from sources quite correct,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With many more by rank and fashion deck'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also a foreigner of high condition,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The envoy of the secret Russian mission.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And thus we see--who doubts the Morning Post?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Whose articles are like the 'Thirty-nine,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which those most swear to who believe them most)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our gay Russ Spaniard was ordain'd to shine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Deck'd by the rays reflected from his host,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With those who, Pope says, 'greatly daring dine.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is odd, but true,--last war the News abounded<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More with these dinners than the kill'd or wounded;--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As thus: 'On Thursday there was a grand dinner;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Present, Lords A. B. C.'--Earls, dukes, by name<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Announced with no less pomp than victory's winner:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then underneath, and in the very same<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Column; date, 'Falmouth. There has lately been here<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Slap-dash regiment, so well known to fame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose loss in the late action we regret:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The vacancies are fill'd up--see Gazette.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To Norman Abbey whirl'd the noble pair,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An old, old monastery once, and now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still older mansion; of a rich and rare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mix'd Gothic, such as artists all allow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Few specimens yet left us can compare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Withal: it lies perhaps a little low,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because the monks preferr'd a hill behind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To shelter their devotion from the wind.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It stood embosom'd in a happy valley,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Crown'd by high woodlands, where the Druid oak<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stood like Caractacus in act to rally<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His host, with broad arms 'gainst the thunderstroke;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And from beneath his boughs were seen to sally<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dappled foresters--as day awoke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The branching stag swept down with all his herd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To quaff a brook which murmur'd like a bird.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before the mansion lay a lucid lake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Broad as transparent, deep, and freshly fed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By a river, which its soften'd way did take<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In currents through the calmer water spread<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Around: the wildfowl nestled in the brake<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sedges, brooding in their liquid bed:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The woods sloped downwards to its brink, and stood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With their green faces fix'd upon the flood.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its outlet dash'd into a deep cascade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sparkling with foam, until again subsiding,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its shriller echoes--like an infant made<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quiet--sank into softer ripples, gliding<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into a rivulet; and thus allay'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pursued its course, now gleaming, and now hiding<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its windings through the woods; now clear, now blue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According as the skies their shadows threw.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A glorious remnant of the Gothic pile<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (While yet the church was Rome's) stood half apart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a grand arch, which once screen'd many an aisle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These last had disappear'd--a loss to art:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first yet frown'd superbly o'er the soil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And kindled feelings in the roughest heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which mourn'd the power of time's or tempest's march,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In gazing on that venerable arch.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Within a niche, nigh to its pinnacle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Twelve saints had once stood sanctified in stone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But these had fallen, not when the friars fell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But in the war which struck Charles from his throne,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When each house was a fortalice, as tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The annals of full many a line undone,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The gallant cavaliers, who fought in vain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For those who knew not to resign or reign.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in a higher niche, alone, but crowned,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Virgin Mother of the God-born Child,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With her Son in her blessed arms, look'd round,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spared by some chance when all beside was spoil'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She made the earth below seem holy ground.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This may be superstition, weak or wild,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But even the faintest relics of a shrine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of any worship wake some thoughts divine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A mighty window, hollow in the centre,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shorn of its glass of thousand colourings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through which the deepen'd glories once could enter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Streaming from off the sun like seraph's wings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now yawns all desolate: now loud, now fainter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The gale sweeps through its fretwork, and oft sings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The owl his anthem, where the silenced quire<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lie with their hallelujahs quench'd like fire.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in the noontide of the moon, and when<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wind is winged from one point of heaven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There moans a strange unearthly sound, which then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is musical--a dying accent driven<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through the huge arch, which soars and sinks again.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some deem it but the distant echo given<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Back to the night wind by the waterfall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And harmonised by the old choral wall:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Others, that some original shape, or form<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shaped by decay perchance, hath given the power<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Though less than that of Memnon's statue, warm<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Egypt's rays, to harp at a fix'd hour)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To this grey ruin, with a voice to charm.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sad, but serene, it sweeps o'er tree or tower;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The cause I know not, nor can solve; but such<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fact:--I 've heard it--once perhaps too much.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst the court a Gothic fountain play'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Symmetrical, but deck'd with carvings quaint--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Strange faces, like to men in masquerade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And here perhaps a monster, there a saint:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The spring gush'd through grim mouths of granite made,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sparkled into basins, where it spent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its little torrent in a thousand bubbles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like man's vain glory, and his vainer troubles.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mansion's self was vast and venerable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With more of the monastic than has been<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Elsewhere preserved: the cloisters still were stable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cells, too, and refectory, I ween:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An exquisite small chapel had been able,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still unimpair'd, to decorate the scene;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The rest had been reform'd, replaced, or sunk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And spoke more of the baron than the monk.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Huge halls, long galleries, spacious chambers, join'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By no quite lawful marriage of the arts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Might shock a connoisseur; but when combined,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Form'd a whole which, irregular in parts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet left a grand impression on the mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least of those whose eyes are in their hearts:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We gaze upon a giant for his stature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor judge at first if all be true to nature.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Steel barons, molten the next generation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To silken rows of gay and garter'd earls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Glanced from the walls in goodly preservation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Lady Marys blooming into girls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With fair long locks, had also kept their station;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And countesses mature in robes and pearls:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also some beauties of Sir Peter Lely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose drapery hints we may admire them freely.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Judges in very formidable ermine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were there, with brows that did not much invite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The accused to think their lordships would determine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His cause by leaning much from might to right:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bishops, who had not left a single sermon:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Attorneys-general, awful to the sight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As hinting more (unless our judgments warp us)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the'star Chamber' than of 'Habeas Corpus.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Generals, some all in armour, of the old<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And iron time, ere lead had ta'en the lead;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Others in wigs of Marlborough's martial fold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Huger than twelve of our degenerate breed:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lordlings, with staves of white or keys of gold:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nimrods, whose canvass scarce contain'd the steed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And here and there some stern high patriot stood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who could not get the place for which he sued.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But ever and anon, to soothe your vision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fatigued with these hereditary glories,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There rose a Carlo Dolce or a Titian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or wilder group of savage Salvatore's;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here danced Albano's boys, and here the sea shone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Vernet's ocean lights; and there the stories<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of martyrs awed, as Spagnoletto tainted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His brush with all the blood of all the sainted.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Here sweetly spread a landscape of Lorraine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There Rembrandt made his darkness equal light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or gloomy Caravaggio's gloomier stain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bronzed o'er some lean and stoic anchorite:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, lo! a Teniers woos, and not in vain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your eyes to revel in a livelier sight:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His bell-mouth'd goblet makes me feel quite Danish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or Dutch with thirst--What, ho! a flask of Rhenish.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O reader! if that thou canst read,--and know,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is not enough to spell, or even to read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To constitute a reader; there must go<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Virtues of which both you and I have need;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Firstly, begin with the beginning (though<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That clause is hard); and secondly, proceed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thirdly, commence not with the end--or, sinning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this sort, end at least with the beginning.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, reader, thou hast patient been of late,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While I, without remorse of rhyme, or fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have built and laid out ground at such a rate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dan Phoebus takes me for an auctioneer.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That poets were so from their earliest date,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By Homer's 'Catalogue of ships' is clear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But a mere modern must be moderate--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I spare you then the furniture and plate.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mellow autumn came, and with it came<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The promised party, to enjoy its sweets.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The corn is cut, the manor full of game;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pointer ranges, and the sportsman beats<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In russet jacket:--lynx-like is his aim;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Full grows his bag, and wonderful his feats.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, nut-brown partridges! Ah, brilliant pheasants!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And ah, ye poachers!--'T is no sport for peasants.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An English autumn, though it hath no vines,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blushing with Bacchant coronals along<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The paths, o'er which the far festoon entwines<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The red grape in the sunny lands of song,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hath yet a purchased choice of choicest wines;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The claret light, and the Madeira strong.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If Britain mourn her bleakness, we can tell her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very best of vineyards is the cellar.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then, if she hath not that serene decline<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which makes the southern autumn's day appear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if 't would to a second spring resign<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The season, rather than to winter drear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of in-door comforts still she hath a mine,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sea-coal fires the 'earliest of the year;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without doors, too, she may compete in mellow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As what is lost in green is gain'd in yellow.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And for the effeminate villeggiatura--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rife with more horns than hounds--she hath the chase,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So animated that it might allure<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saint from his beads to join the jocund race;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even Nimrod's self might leave the plains of Dura,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And wear the Melton jacket for a space:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If she hath no wild boars, she hath a tame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Preserve of bores, who ought to be made game.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The noble guests, assembled at the Abbey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consisted of--we give the sex the pas--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke; the Countess Crabby;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ladies Scilly, Busey;--Miss Eclat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Miss Bombazeen, Miss Mackstay, Miss O'Tabby,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Mrs. Rabbi, the rich banker's squaw;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also the honourable Mrs. Sleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who look'd a white lamb, yet was a black sheep:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With other Countesses of Blank--but rank;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At once the 'lie' and the 'elite' of crowds;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who pass like water filter'd in a tank,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All purged and pious from their native clouds;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or paper turn'd to money by the Bank:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No matter how or why, the passport shrouds<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The 'passee' and the past; for good society<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is no less famed for tolerance than piety,--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is, up to a certain point; which point<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forms the most difficult in punctuation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Appearances appear to form the joint<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On which it hinges in a higher station;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And so that no explosion cry 'Aroint<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thee, witch!' or each Medea has her Jason;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or (to the point with Horace and with Pulci)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Omne tulit punctum, quae miscuit utile dulci.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't exactly trace their rule of right,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which hath a little leaning to a lottery.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've seen a virtuous woman put down quite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the mere combination of a coterie;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also a so-so matron boldly fight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her way back to the world by dint of plottery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And shine the very Siria of the spheres,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Escaping with a few slight, scarless sneers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen more than I 'll say:--but we will see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How our villeggiatura will get on.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The party might consist of thirty-three<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of highest caste--the Brahmins of the ton.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have named a few, not foremost in degree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But ta'en at hazard as the rhyme may run.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By way of sprinkling, scatter'd amongst these,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There also were some Irish absentees.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was Parolles, too, the legal bully,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who limits all his battles to the bar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And senate: when invited elsewhere, truly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shows more appetite for words than war.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was the young bard Rackrhyme, who had newly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Come out and glimmer'd as a six weeks' star.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was Lord Pyrrho, too, the great freethinker;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Sir John Pottledeep, the mighty drinker.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was the Duke of Dash, who was a--duke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Ay, every inch a' duke; there were twelve peers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Charlemagne's--and all such peers in look<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And intellect, that neither eyes nor ears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For commoners had ever them mistook.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There were the six Miss Rawbolds--pretty dears!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All song and sentiment; whose hearts were set<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Less on a convent than a coronet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were four Honourable Misters, whose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Honour was more before their names than after;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was the preux Chevalier de la Ruse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whom France and Fortune lately deign'd to waft here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose chiefly harmless talent was to amuse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the clubs found it rather serious laughter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because--such was his magic power to please--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The dice seem'd charm'd, too, with his repartees.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was Dick Dubious, the metaphysician,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who loved philosophy and a good dinner;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Angle, the soi-disant mathematician;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sir Henry Silvercup, the great race-winner.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was the Reverend Rodomont Precisian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who did not hate so much the sin as sinner;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Good at all things, but better at a bet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was jack jargon, the gigantic guardsman;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And General Fireface, famous in the field,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A great tactician, and no less a swordsman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who ate, last war, more Yankees than he kill'd.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was the waggish Welsh Judge, Jefferies Hardsman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In his grave office so completely skill'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That when a culprit came far condemnation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had his judge's joke for consolation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Good company's a chess-board--there are kings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Queens, bishops, knights, rooks, pawns; the world's a game;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Save that the puppets pull at their own strings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Methinks gay Punch hath something of the same.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My Muse, the butterfly hath but her wings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not stings, and flits through ether without aim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alighting rarely:--were she but a hornet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps there might be vices which would mourn it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had forgotten--but must not forget--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An orator, the latest of the session,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who had deliver'd well a very set<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Smooth speech, his first and maidenly transgression<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon debate: the papers echoed yet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With his debut, which made a strong impression,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And rank'd with what is every day display'd--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'The best first speech that ever yet was made.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Proud of his 'Hear hims!' proud, too, of his vote<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And lost virginity of oratory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Proud of his learning (just enough to quote),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He revell'd in his Ciceronian glory:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With memory excellent to get by rote,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With wit to hatch a pun or tell a story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Graced with some merit, and with more effrontery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'His country's pride,' he came down to the country.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There also were two wits by acclamation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Longbow from Ireland, Strongbow from the Tweed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Both lawyers and both men of education;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Strongbow's wit was of more polish'd breed:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Longbow was rich in an imagination<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As beautiful and bounding as a steed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But sometimes stumbling over a potato,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While Strongbow's best things might have come from Cato.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Strongbow was like a new-tuned harpsichord;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Longbow wild as an AEolian harp,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With which the winds of heaven can claim accord,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And make a music, whether flat or sharp.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Strongbow's talk you would not change a word:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At Longbow's phrases you might sometimes carp:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Both wits--one born so, and the other bred--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This by his heart, his rival by his head.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If all these seem a heterogeneous mas<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be assembled at a country seat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet think, a specimen of every class<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is better than a humdrum tete-a-tete.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The days of Comedy are gone, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When Congreve's fool could vie with Moliere's bete:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Society is smooth'd to that excess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That manners hardly differ more than dress.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our ridicules are kept in the back-ground--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ridiculous enough, but also dull;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Professions, too, are no more to be found<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Professional; and there is nought to cull<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of folly's fruit; for though your fools abound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They're barren, and not worth the pains to pull.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Society is now one polish'd horde,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Form'd of two mighty tribes, the Bores and Bored.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But from being farmers, we turn gleaners, gleaning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The scanty but right-well thresh'd ears of truth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, gentle reader! when you gather meaning,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You may be Boaz, and I--modest Ruth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Farther I 'd quote, but Scripture intervening<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forbids. it great impression in my youth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was made by Mrs. Adams, where she cries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'That Scriptures out of church are blasphemies.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what we can we glean in this vile age<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of chaff, although our gleanings be not grist.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I must not quite omit the talking sage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kit-Cat, the famous Conversationist,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who, in his common-place book, had a page<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Prepared each morn for evenings. 'List, oh, list!'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Alas, poor ghost!'--What unexpected woes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Await those who have studied their bon-mots!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Firstly, they must allure the conversation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By many windings to their clever clinch;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And secondly, must let slip no occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor bate (abate) their hearers of an inch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But take an ell--and make a great sensation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If possible; and thirdly, never flinch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When some smart talker puts them to the test,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But seize the last word, which no doubt's the best.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry and his lady were the hosts;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The party we have touch'd on were the guests:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Albeit all human history attests<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That happiness for man--the hungry sinner!--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Witness the lands which 'flow'd with milk and honey,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Held out unto the hungry Israelites;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To this we have added since, the love of money,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The only sort of pleasure which requites.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Youth fades, and leaves our days no longer sunny;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We tire of mistresses and parasites;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But oh, ambrosial cash! Ah! who would lose thee?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When we no more can use, or even abuse thee!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The gentlemen got up betimes to shoot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or hunt: the young, because they liked the sport--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first thing boys like after play and fruit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The middle-aged to make the day more short;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For ennui is a growth of English root,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though nameless in our language:--we retort<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The fact for words, and let the French translate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That awful yawn which sleep can not abate.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The elderly walk'd through the library,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tumbled books, or criticised the pictures,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or saunter'd through the gardens piteously,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And made upon the hot-house several strictures,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or rode a nag which trotted not too high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or on the morning papers read their lectures,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or on the watch their longing eyes would fix,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Longing at sixty for the hour of six.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But none were 'gene:' the great hour of union<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was rung by dinner's knell; till then all were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Masters of their own time--or in communion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or solitary, as they chose to bear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The hours, which how to pass is but to few known.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Each rose up at his own, and had to spare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What time he chose for dress, and broke his fast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When, where, and how he chose for that repast.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ladies--some rouged, some a little pale--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Met the morn as they might. If fine, they rode,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or walk'd; if foul, they read, or told a tale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sung, or rehearsed the last dance from abroad;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Discuss'd the fashion which might next prevail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And settled bonnets by the newest code,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or cramm'd twelve sheets into one little letter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To make each correspondent a new debtor.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For some had absent lovers, all had friends.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The earth has nothing like a she epistle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hardly heaven--because it never ends.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I love the mystery of a female missal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which, like a creed, ne'er says all it intends,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But full of cunning as Ulysses' whistle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When he allured poor Dolon:--you had better<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Take care what you reply to such a letter.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there were billiards; cards, too, but no dice;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Save in the clubs no man of honour plays;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Boats when 't was water, skating when 't was ice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the hard frost destroy'd the scenting days:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And angling, too, that solitary vice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever Izaak Walton sings or says;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, in his gullet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With evening came the banquet and the wine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The conversazione; the duet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Attuned by voices more or less divine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (My heart or head aches with the memory yet).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The four Miss Rawbolds in a glee would shine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the two youngest loved more to be set<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Down to the harp--because to music's charms<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They added graceful necks, white hands and arms.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes a dance (though rarely on field days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For then the gentlemen were rather tired)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Display'd some sylph-like figures in its maze;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then there was small-talk ready when required;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Flirtation--but decorous; the mere praise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of charms that should or should not be admired.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The hunters fought their fox-hunt o'er again,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then retreated soberly--at ten.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The politicians, in a nook apart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Discuss'd the world, and settled all the spheres;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wits watch'd every loophole for their art,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To introduce a bon-mot head and ears;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Small is the rest of those who would be smart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A moment's good thing may have cost them years<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before they find an hour to introduce it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then, even then, some bore may make them lose it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But all was gentle and aristocratic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this our party; polish'd, smooth, and cold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As Phidian forms cut out of marble Attic.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There now are no Squire Westerns as of old;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And our Sophias are not so emphatic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But fair as then, or fairer to behold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We have no accomplish'd blackguards, like Tom Jones,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But gentlemen in stays, as stiff as stones.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They separated at an early hour;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is, ere midnight--which is London's noon:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But in the country ladies seek their bower<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little earlier than the waning moon.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Peace to the slumbers of each folded flower--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May the rose call back its true colour soon!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Good hours of fair cheeks are the fairest tinters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And lower the price of rouge--at least some winters.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="axiv">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;            CANTO THE FOURTEENTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; IF from great nature's or our own abyss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of thought we could but snatch a certainty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps mankind might find the path they miss--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But then 't would spoil much good philosophy.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One system eats another up, and this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Much as old Saturn ate his progeny;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For when his pious consort gave him stones<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In lieu of sons, of these he made no bones.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But System doth reverse the Titan's breakfast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And eats her parents, albeit the digestion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is difficult. Pray tell me, can you make fast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After due search, your faith to any question?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Look back o'er ages, ere unto the stake fast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You bind yourself, and call some mode the best one.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing more true than not to trust your senses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet what are your other evidences?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For me, I know nought; nothing I deny,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Admit, reject, contemn; and what know you,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Except perhaps that you were born to die?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And both may after all turn out untrue.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An age may come, Font of Eternity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When nothing shall be either old or new.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Death, so call'd, is a thing which makes men weep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet a third of life is pass'd in sleep.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sleep without dreams, after a rough day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of toil, is what we covet most; and yet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How clay shrinks back from more quiescent clay!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The very Suicide that pays his debt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At once without instalments (an old way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of paying debts, which creditors regret)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lets out impatiently his rushing breath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Less from disgust of life than dread of death.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is round him, near him, here, there, every where;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And there's a courage which grows out of fear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps of all most desperate, which will dare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The worst to know it:--when the mountains rear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their peaks beneath your human foot, and there<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You look down o'er the precipice, and drear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The gulf of rock yawns,--you can't gaze a minute<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without an awful wish to plunge within it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is true, you don't--but, pale and struck with terror,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Retire: but look into your past impression!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And you will find, though shuddering at the mirror<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of your own thoughts, in all their self-confession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lurking bias, be it truth or error,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the unknown; a secret prepossession,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To plunge with all your fears--but where? You know not,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that's the reason why you do--or do not.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what's this to the purpose? you will say.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For which my sole excuse is--'t is my way;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes with and sometimes without occasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I write what's uppermost, without delay:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This narrative is not meant for narration,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But a mere airy and fantastic basis,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To build up common things with common places.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You know, or don't know, that great Bacon saith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Fling up a straw, 't will show the way the wind blows;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And such a straw, borne on by human breath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is poesy, according as the mind glows;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A paper kite which flies 'twixt life and death,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A shadow which the onward soul behind throws:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And mine's a bubble, not blown up for praise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But just to play with, as an infant plays.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The world is all before me--or behind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For I have seen a portion of that same,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And quite enough for me to keep in mind;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the great pleasure of our friends, mankind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For I was rather famous in my time,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Until I fairly knock'd it up with rhyme.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have brought this world about my ears, and eke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The other; that's to say, the clergy, who<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon my head have bid their thunders break<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In pious libels by no means a few.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet I can't help scribbling once a week,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In youth I wrote because my mind was full,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now because I feel it growing dull.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But 'why then publish?'--There are no rewards<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of fame or profit when the world grows weary.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I ask in turn,--Why do you play at cards?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why drink? Why read?--To make some hour less dreary.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It occupies me to turn back regards<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On what I 've seen or ponder'd, sad or cheery;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And what I write I cast upon the stream,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To swim or sink--I have had at least my dream.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think that were I certain of success,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I hardly could compose another line:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So long I 've battled either more or less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This feeling 't is not easy to express,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet 't is not affected, I opine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In play, there are two pleasures for your choosing--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The one is winning, and the other losing.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She gathers a repertory of facts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course with some reserve and slight restriction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But mostly sings of human things and acts--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that's one cause she meets with contradiction;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For too much truth, at first sight, ne'er attracts;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And were her object only what's call'd glory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With more ease too she 'd tell a different story.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love, war, a tempest--surely there's variety;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A slight glance thrown on men of every station.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you have nought else, here's at least satiety<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both in performance and in preparation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And though these lines should only line portmanteaus,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Trade will be all the better for these Cantos.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The portion of this world which I at present<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have taken up to fill the following sermon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is one of which there's no description recent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The reason why is easy to determine:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although it seems both prominent and pleasant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A dull and family likeness through all ages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of no great promise for poetic pages.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With much to excite, there's little to exalt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A sort of varnish over every fault;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Factitious passions, wit without much salt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A want of that true nature which sublimes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er it shows with truth; a smooth monotony<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of character, in those at least who have got any.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then the roll-call draws them back afraid,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And they must be or seem what they were: still<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But when of the first sight you have had your fill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It palls--at least it did so upon me,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This paradise of pleasure and ennui.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Drest, voted, shone, and, may be, something more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With dandies dined; heard senators declaiming;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seen beauties brought to market by the score,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sad rakes to sadder husbands chastely taming;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's little left but to be bored or bore.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Witness those 'ci-devant jeunes hommes' who stem<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is said--indeed a general complaint--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That no one has succeeded in describing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The monde, exactly as they ought to paint:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To furnish matter for their moral gibing;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that their books have but one style in common--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My lady's prattle, filter'd through her woman.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this can't well be true, just now; for writers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are grown of the beau monde a part potential:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially when young, for that's essential.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why do their sketches fail them as inditers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of what they deem themselves most consequential,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The real portrait of the highest tribe?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is that, in fact, there's little to describe.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Haud ignara loquor;' these are Nugae, 'quarum<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pars parva fui,' but still art and part.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now I could much more easily sketch a harem,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For reasons which I choose to keep apart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit-'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which means that vulgar people must not share it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore what I throw off is ideal--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lower'd, leaven'd, like a history of freemasons;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which bears the same relation to the real,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Captain Parry's voyage may do to Jason's.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The grand arcanum's not for men to see all;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My music has some mystic diapasons;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And there is much which could not be appreciated<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In any manner by the uninitiated.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! worlds fall--and woman, since she fell'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The world (as, since that history less polite<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than true, hath been a creed so strictly held)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has not yet given up the practice quite.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Poor thing of usages! coerced, compell'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Condemn'd to child-bed, as men for their sins<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have shaving too entail'd upon their chins,--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A daily plague, which in the aggregate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May average on the whole with parturition.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as to women, who can penetrate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The real sufferings of their she condition?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Man's very sympathy with their estate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their love, their virtue, beauty, education,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But form good housekeepers, to breed a nation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All this were very well, and can't be better;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So many troubles from her birth beset her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such small distinction between friends and foes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That--but ask any woman if she'd choose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Take her at thirty, that is) to have been<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Female or male? a schoolboy or a queen?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Petticoat influence' is a great reproach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which even those who obey would fain be thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By various joltings of life's hackney coach,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I for one venerate a petticoat--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A garment of a mystical sublimity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Much I respect, and much I have adored,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And more attracts by all it doth conceal--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A loving letter with a mystic seal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A cure for grief--for what can ever rankle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before a petticoat and peeping ankle?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when upon a silent, sullen day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a sirocco, for example, blowing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When even the sea looks dim with all its spray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sulkily the river's ripple's flowing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the sky shows that very ancient gray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is pleasant, if then any thing is pleasant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We left our heroes and our heroines<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In that fair clime which don't depend on climate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quite independent of the Zodiac's signs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because the sun, and stars, and aught that shines,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mountains, and all we can be most sublime at,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are there oft dull and dreary as a dun--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether a sky's or tradesman's is all one.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An in-door life is less poetical;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And out of door hath showers, and mists, and sleet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With which I could not brew a pastoral.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But be it as it may, a bard must meet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All difficulties, whether great or small,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To spoil his undertaking or complete,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And work away like spirit upon matter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Embarrass'd somewhat both with fire and water.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan--in this respect, at least, like saints--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was all things unto people of all sorts,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And lived contentedly, without complaints,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In camps, in ships, in cottages, or courts--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Born with that happy soul which seldom faints,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And mingling modestly in toils or sports.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He likewise could be most things to all women,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without the coxcombry of certain she men.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A fox-hunt to a foreigner is strange;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is also subject to the double danger<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of tumbling first, and having in exchange<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some pleasant jesting at the awkward stranger:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan had been early taught to range<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wilds, as doth an Arab turn'd avenger,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that his horse, or charger, hunter, hack,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Knew that he had a rider on his back.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now in this new field, with some applause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He clear'd hedge, ditch, and double post, and rail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And never craned, and made but few 'faux pas,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And only fretted when the scent 'gan fail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He broke, 't is true, some statutes of the laws<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of hunting--for the sagest youth is frail;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rode o'er the hounds, it may be, now and then,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And once o'er several country gentlemen.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But on the whole, to general admiration<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He acquitted both himself and horse: the squires<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Marvell'd at merit of another nation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The boors cried 'Dang it? who 'd have thought it?'--Sires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Nestors of the sporting generation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Swore praises, and recall'd their former fires;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The huntsman's self relented to a grin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And rated him almost a whipper-in.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such were his trophies--not of spear and shield,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But leaps, and bursts, and sometimes foxes' brushes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I must own,--although in this I yield<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To patriot sympathy a Briton's blushes,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He thought at heart like courtly Chesterfield,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who, after a long chase o'er hills, dales, bushes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And what not, though he rode beyond all price,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ask'd next day, 'If men ever hunted twice?'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He also had a quality uncommon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To early risers after a long chase,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who wake in winter ere the cock can summon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; December's drowsy day to his dull race,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A quality agreeable to woman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When her soft, liquid words run on apace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who likes a listener, whether saint or sinner,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He did not fall asleep just after dinner;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, light and airy, stood on the alert,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And shone in the best part of dialogue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By humouring always what they might assert,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And listening to the topics most in vogue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now grave, now gay, but never dull or pert;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And smiling but in secret--cunning rogue!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He ne'er presumed to make an error clearer;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In short, there never was a better hearer.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then he danced;--all foreigners excel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The serious Angles in the eloquence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of pantomime;--he danced, I say, right well,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With emphasis, and also with good sense--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A thing in footing indispensable;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He danced without theatrical pretence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not like a ballet-master in the van<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of his drill'd nymphs, but like a gentleman.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Chaste were his steps, each kept within due bound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And elegance was sprinkled o'er his figure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like swift Camilla, he scarce skimm'd the ground,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And rather held in than put forth his vigour;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then he had an ear for music's sound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which might defy a crotchet critic's rigour.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such classic pas--sans flaws--set off our hero,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He glanced like a personified Bolero;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or, like a flying Hour before Aurora,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Guido's famous fresco which alone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is worth a tour to Rome, although no more a<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remnant were there of the old world's sole throne.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The 'tout ensemble' of his movements wore a<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grace of the soft ideal, seldom shown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And ne'er to be described; for to the dolour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of bards and prosers, words are void of colour.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No marvel then he was a favourite;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A full-grown Cupid, very much admired;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A little spoilt, but by no means so quite;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least he kept his vanity retired.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such was his tact, he could alike delight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The chaste, and those who are not so much inspired.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke, who loved 'tracasserie,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Began to treat him with some small 'agacerie.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was a fine and somewhat full-blown blonde,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Desirable, distinguish'd, celebrated<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For several winters in the grand, grand monde.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'd rather not say what might be related<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of her exploits, for this were ticklish ground;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Besides there might be falsehood in what's stated:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her late performance had been a dead set<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This noble personage began to look<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A little black upon this new flirtation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But such small licences must lovers brook,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mere freedoms of the female corporation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Woe to the man who ventures a rebuke!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T will but precipitate a situation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Extremely disagreeable, but common<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To calculators when they count on woman.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The circle smiled, then whisper'd, and then sneer'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Misses bridled, and the matrons frown'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some hoped things might not turn out as they fear'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some would not deem such women could be found;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some ne'er believed one half of what they heard;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some look'd perplex'd, and others look'd profound;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And several pitied with sincere regret<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Poor Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what is odd, none ever named the duke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who, one might think, was something in the affair;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; True, he was absent, and, 't was rumour'd, took<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But small concern about the when, or where,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or what his consort did: if he could brook<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her gaieties, none had a right to stare:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Theirs was that best of unions, past all doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which never meets, and therefore can't fall out.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, oh! that I should ever pen so sad a line!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fired with an abstract love of virtue, she,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My Dian of the Ephesians, Lady Adeline,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Began to think the duchess' conduct free;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Regretting much that she had chosen so bad a line,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And waxing chiller in her courtesy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Look'd grave and pale to see her friend's fragility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For which most friends reserve their sensibility.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's nought in this bad world like sympathy:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is so becoming to the soul and face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sets to soft music the harmonious sigh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And robes sweet friendship in a Brussels lace.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without a friend, what were humanity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hunt our errors up with a good grace?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Consoling us with--'Would you had thought twice!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ah, if you had but follow'd my advice!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O job! you had two friends: one's quite enough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially when we are ill at ease;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They are but bad pilots when the weather's rough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Doctors less famous for their cures than fees.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let no man grumble when his friends fall off,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As they will do like leaves at the first breeze:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When your affairs come round, one way or t' other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the coffee-house, and take another.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this is not my maxim: had it been,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some heart-aches had been spared me: yet I care not--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I would not be a tortoise in his screen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of stubborn shell, which waves and weather wear not.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is better on the whole to have felt and seen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That which humanity may bear, or bear not:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T will teach discernment to the sensitive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And not to pour their ocean in a sieve.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the horrid, hideous notes of woe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sadder than owl-songs or the midnight blast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is that portentous phrase, 'I told you so,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Utter'd by friends, those prophets of the past,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who,'stead of saying what you now should do,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Own they foresaw that you would fall at last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And solace your slight lapse 'gainst 'bonos mores,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With a long memorandum of old stories.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Lady Adeline's serene severity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was not confined to feeling for her friend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose fame she rather doubted with posterity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless her habits should begin to mend:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan also shared in her austerity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But mix'd with pity, pure as e'er was penn'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His inexperience moved her gentle ruth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And (as her junior by six weeks) his youth.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These forty days' advantage of her years--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And hers were those which can face calculation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Boldly referring to the list of peers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And noble births, nor dread the enumeration--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gave her a right to have maternal fears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a young gentleman's fit education,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though she was far from that leap year, whose leap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In female dates, strikes Time all of a heap.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This may be fix'd at somewhere before thirty--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Say seven-and-twenty; for I never knew<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The strictest in chronology and virtue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Advance beyond, while they could pass for new.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O Time! why dost not pause? Thy scythe, so dirty<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With rust, should surely cease to hack and hew.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reset it; shave more smoothly, also slower,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If but to keep thy credit as a mower.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Adeline was far from that ripe age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose ripeness is but bitter at the best:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was rather her experience made her sage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she had seen the world and stood its test,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As I have said in--I forget what page;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My Muse despises reference, as you have guess'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By this time;--but strike six from seven-and-twenty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And you will find her sum of years in plenty.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At sixteen she came out; presented, vaunted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She put all coronets into commotion:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At seventeen, too, the world was still enchanted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the new Venus of their brilliant ocean:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At eighteen, though below her feet still panted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A hecatomb of suitors with devotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had consented to create again<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That Adam, call'd 'The happiest of men.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since then she had sparkled through three glowing winters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Admired, adored; but also so correct,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That she had puzzled all the acutest hinters,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without the apparel of being circumspect:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They could not even glean the slightest splinters<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From off the marble, which had no defect.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had also snatch'd a moment since her marriage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To bear a son and heir--and one miscarriage.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fondly the wheeling fire-flies flew around her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those little glitterers of the London night;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But none of these possess'd a sting to wound her--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She was a pitch beyond a coxcomb's flight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps she wish'd an aspirant profounder;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But whatsoe'er she wish'd, she acted right;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And whether coldness, pride, or virtue dignify<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A woman, so she's good, what does it signify?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I hate a motive, like a lingering bottle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which with the landlord makes too long a stand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaving all-claretless the unmoisten'd throttle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially with politics on hand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I hate it, as I hate a drove of cattle,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who whirl the dust as simooms whirl the sand;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I hate it, as I hate an argument,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A laureate's ode, or servile peer's 'content.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is sad to hack into the roots of things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are so much intertwisted with the earth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that the branch a goodly verdure flings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I reck not if an acorn gave it birth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To trace all actions to their secret springs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would make indeed some melancholy mirth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this is not at present my concern,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I refer you to wise Oxenstiern.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the kind view of saving an eclat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both to the duchess and diplomatist,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Lady Adeline, as soon's she saw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Juan was unlikely to resist<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (For foreigners don't know that a faux pas<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In England ranks quite on a different list<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From those of other lands unblest with juries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose verdict for such sin a certain cure is);--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Lady Adeline resolved to take<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such measures as she thought might best impede<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The farther progress of this sad mistake.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She thought with some simplicity indeed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But innocence is bold even at the stake,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And simple in the world, and doth not need<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor use those palisades by dames erected,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose virtue lies in never being detected.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not that she fear'd the very worst:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His Grace was an enduring, married man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And was not likely all at once to burst<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Into a scene, and swell the clients' clan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Doctors' Commons: but she dreaded first<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The magic of her Grace's talisman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And next a quarrel (as he seem'd to fret)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Lord Augustus Fitz-Plantagenet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her Grace, too, pass'd for being an intrigante,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And somewhat mechante in her amorous sphere;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of those pretty, precious plagues, which haunt<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A lover with caprices soft and dear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That like to make a quarrel, when they can't<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Find one, each day of the delightful year;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bewitching, torturing, as they freeze or glow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And--what is worst of all--won't let you go:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sort of thing to turn a young man's head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or make a Werter of him in the end.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No wonder then a purer soul should dread<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This sort of chaste liaison for a friend;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It were much better to be wed or dead,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than wear a heart a woman loves to rend.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is best to pause, and think, ere you rush on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If that a 'bonne fortune' be really 'bonne.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And first, in the o'erflowing of her heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which really knew or thought it knew no guile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She call'd her husband now and then apart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And bade him counsel Juan. With a smile<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry heard her plans of artless art<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To wean Don Juan from the siren's wile;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And answer'd, like a statesman or a prophet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In such guise that she could make nothing of it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Firstly, he said, 'he never interfered<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In any body's business but the king's:'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next, that 'he never judged from what appear'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without strong reason, of those sort of things:'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thirdly, that 'Juan had more brain than beard,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And was not to be held in leading strings;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fourthly, what need hardly be said twice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'That good but rarely came from good advice.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, therefore, doubtless to approve the truth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the last axiom, he advised his spouse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To leave the parties to themselves, forsooth--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least as far as bienseance allows:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That time would temper Juan's faults of youth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That young men rarely made monastic vows;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That opposition only more attaches--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here a messenger brought in despatches:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And being of the council call'd 'the Privy,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry walk'd into his cabinet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To furnish matter for some future Livy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tell how he reduced the nation's debt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if their full contents I do not give ye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is because I do not know them yet;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I shall add them in a brief appendix,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To come between mine epic and its index.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But ere he went, he added a slight hint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another gentle common-place or two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such as are coin'd in conversation's mint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pass, for want of better, though not new:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then broke his packet, to see what was in 't,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And having casually glanced it through,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Retired; and, as went out, calmly kiss'd her,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Less like a young wife than an aged sister.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was a cold, good, honourable man,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Proud of his birth, and proud of every thing;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A goodly spirit for a state divan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A figure fit to walk before a king;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tall, stately, form'd to lead the courtly van<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On birthdays, glorious with a star and string;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very model of a chamberlain--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And such I mean to make him when I reign.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But there was something wanting on the whole--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know what, and therefore cannot tell--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which pretty women--the sweet souls!--call soul.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Certes it was not body; he was well<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Proportion'd, as a poplar or a pole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A handsome man, that human miracle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in each circumstance of love or war<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had still preserved his perpendicular.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still there was something wanting, as I 've said--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That undefinable 'Je ne scais quoi,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which, for what I know, may of yore have led<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To Homer's Iliad, since it drew to Troy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Greek Eve, Helen, from the Spartan's bed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though on the whole, no doubt, the Dardan boy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was much inferior to King Menelaus:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But thus it is some women will betray us.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is an awkward thing which much perplexes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless like wise Tiresias we had proved<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By turns the difference of the several sexes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neither can show quite how they would be loved.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sensual for a short time but connects us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sentimental boasts to be unmoved;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But both together form a kind of centaur,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon whose back 't is better not to venture.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A something all-sufficient for the heart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is that for which the sex are always seeking:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But how to fill up that same vacant part?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There lies the rub--and this they are but weak in.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Frail mariners afloat without a chart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They run before the wind through high seas breaking;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when they have made the shore through every shock,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is odd, or odds, it may turn out a rock.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a flower call'd 'Love in Idleness,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For which see Shakspeare's everblooming garden;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I will not make his great description less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And beg his British godship's humble pardon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If in my extremity of rhyme's distress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I touch a single leaf where he is warden;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But though the flower is different, with the French<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or Swiss Rousseau, cry 'Voila la Pervenche!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Eureka! I have found it! What I mean<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To say is, not that love is idleness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But that in love such idleness has been<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An accessory, as I have cause to guess.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hard labour's an indifferent go-between;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your men of business are not apt to express<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Much passion, since the merchant-ship, the Argo,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Convey'd Medea as her supercargo.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Beatus ille procul!' from 'negotiis,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saith Horace; the great little poet's wrong;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His other maxim, 'Noscitur a sociis,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is much more to the purpose of his song;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though even that were sometimes too ferocious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless good company be kept too long;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, in his teeth, whate'er their state or station,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thrice happy they who have an occupation!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Adam exchanged his Paradise for ploughing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eve made up millinery with fig leaves--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The earliest knowledge from the tree so knowing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As far as I know, that the church receives:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And since that time it need not cost much showing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That many of the ills o'er which man grieves,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And still more women, spring from not employing<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some hours to make the remnant worth enjoying.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hence high life is oft a dreary void,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A rack of pleasures, where we must invent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A something wherewithal to be annoy'd.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bards may sing what they please about Content;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Contented, when translated, means but cloy'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And hence arise the woes of sentiment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Blue devils, and blue-stockings, and romances<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Reduced to practice, and perform'd like dances.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I do declare, upon an affidavit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Romances I ne'er read like those I have seen;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor, if unto the world I ever gave it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would some believe that such a tale had been:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But such intent I never had, nor have it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some truths are better kept behind a screen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Especially when they would look like lies;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I therefore deal in generalities.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'An oyster may be cross'd in love,'--and why?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he mopeth idly in his shell,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And heaves a lonely subterraqueous sigh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Much as a monk may do within his cell:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And a-propos of monks, their piety<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With sloth hath found it difficult to dwell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those vegetables of the Catholic creed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are apt exceedingly to run to seed.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O Wilberforce! thou man of black renown,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose merit none enough can sing or say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thou hast struck one immense Colossus down,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou moral Washington of Africa!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But there's another little thing, I own,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which you should perpetrate some summer's day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And set the other halt of earth to rights;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You have freed the blacks--now pray shut up the whites.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shut up the bald-coot bully Alexander!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ship off the Holy Three to Senegal;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teach them that'sauce for goose is sauce for gander,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And ask them how they like to be in thrall?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shut up each high heroic salamander,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who eats fire gratis (since the pay's but small);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shut up--no, not the King, but the Pavilion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or else 't will cost us all another million.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shut up the world at large, let Bedlam out;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And you will be perhaps surprised to find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All things pursue exactly the same route,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As now with those of soi-disant sound mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This I could prove beyond a single doubt,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were there a jot of sense among mankind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But till that point d'appui is found, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Archimedes, I leave earth as 't was.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our gentle Adeline had one defect--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her heart was vacant, though a splendid mansion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her conduct had been perfectly correct,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As she had seen nought claiming its expansion.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A wavering spirit may be easier wreck'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because 't is frailer, doubtless, than a stanch one;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But when the latter works its own undoing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its inner crash is like an earthquake's ruin.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She loved her lord, or thought so; but that love<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cost her an effort, which is a sad toil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The stone of Sisyphus, if once we move<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our feelings 'gainst the nature of the soil.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had nothing to complain of, or reprove,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No bickerings, no connubial turmoil:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their union was a model to behold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Serene and noble,--conjugal, but cold.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was no great disparity of years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though much in temper; but they never clash'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They moved like stars united in their spheres,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or like the Rhone by Leman's waters wash'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where mingled and yet separate appears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The river from the lake, all bluely dash'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through the serene and placid glassy deep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which fain would lull its river-child to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now when she once had ta'en an interest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In any thing, however she might flatter<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Herself that her intentions were the best,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Intense intentions are a dangerous matter:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Impressions were much stronger than she guess'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And gather'd as they run like growing water<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon her mind; the more so, as her breast<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was not at first too readily impress'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But when it was, she had that lurking demon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of double nature, and thus doubly named--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Firmness yclept in heroes, kings, and seamen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That is, when they succeed; but greatly blamed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As obstinacy, both in men and women,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whene'er their triumph pales, or star is tamed:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And 't will perplex the casuist in morality<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To fix the due bounds of this dangerous quality.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had Buonaparte won at Waterloo,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It had been firmness; now 't is pertinacity:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Must the event decide between the two?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I leave it to your people of sagacity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To draw the line between the false and true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If such can e'er be drawn by man's capacity:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My business is with Lady Adeline,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who in her way too was a heroine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She knew not her own heart; then how should I?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think not she was then in love with Juan:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If so, she would have had the strength to fly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wild sensation, unto her a new one:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She merely felt a common sympathy<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (I will not say it was a false or true one)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In him, because she thought he was in danger,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her husband's friend, her own, young, and a stranger,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was, or thought she was, his friend--and this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Without the farce of friendship, or romance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Platonism, which leads so oft amiss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ladies who have studied friendship but in France,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or Germany, where people purely kiss.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To thus much Adeline would not advance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But of such friendship as man's may to man be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was as capable as woman can be.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt the secret influence of the sex<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will there, as also in the ties of blood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An innocent predominance annex,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And tune the concord to a finer mood.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If free from passion, which all friendship checks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And your true feelings fully understood,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No friend like to a woman earth discovers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that you have not been nor will be lovers.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love bears within its breast the very germ<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of change; and how should this be otherwise?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That violent things more quickly find a term<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is shown through nature's whole analogies;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how should the most fierce of all be firm?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would you have endless lightning in the skies?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Methinks Love's very title says enough:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How should 'the tender passion' e'er be tough?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! by all experience, seldom yet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (I merely quote what I have heard from many)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had lovers not some reason to regret<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The passion which made Solomon a zany.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've also seen some wives (not to forget<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The marriage state, the best or worst of any)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who were the very paragons of wives,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet made the misery of at least two lives.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I 've also seen some female friends ( 't is odd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But true--as, if expedient, I could prove)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That faithful were through thick and thin, abroad,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At home, far more than ever yet was Love--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who did not quit me when Oppression trod<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon me; whom no scandal could remove;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who fought, and fight, in absence, too, my battles,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Despite the snake Society's loud rattles.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether Don Juan and chaste Adeline<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Grew friends in this or any other sense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will be discuss'd hereafter, I opine:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At present I am glad of a pretence<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To leave them hovering, as the effect is fine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And keeps the atrocious reader in suspense;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The surest way for ladies and for books<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To bait their tender, or their tenter, hooks.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether they rode, or walk'd, or studied Spanish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To read Don Quixote in the original,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A pleasure before which all others vanish;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether their talk was of the kind call'd'small,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or serious, are the topics I must banish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the next Canto; where perhaps I shall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Say something to the purpose, and display<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Considerable talent in my way.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Above all, I beg all men to forbear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anticipating aught about the matter:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They 'll only make mistakes about the fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan too, especially the latter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I shall take a much more serious air<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than I have yet done, in this epic satire.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is not clear that Adeline and Juan<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will fall; but if they do, 't will be their ruin.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But great things spring from little:--Would you think,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in our youth, as dangerous a passion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As e'er brought man and woman to the brink<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of ruin, rose from such a slight occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As few would ever dream could form the link<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of such a sentimental situation?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You 'll never guess, I 'll bet you millions, milliards--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It all sprung from a harmless game at billiards.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is strange,--but true; for truth is always strange;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Stranger than fiction; if it could be told,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How much would novels gain by the exchange!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How differently the world would men behold!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How oft would vice and virtue places change!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The new world would be nothing to the old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If some Columbus of the moral seas<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would show mankind their souls' antipodes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What 'antres vast and deserts idle' then<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would be discover'd in the human soul!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What icebergs in the hearts of mighty men,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With self-love in the centre as their pole!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What Anthropophagi are nine of ten<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of those who hold the kingdoms in control<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were things but only call'd by their right name,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Caesar himself would be ashamed of fame.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="axv">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;            CANTO THE FIFTEENTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; AH!--What should follow slips from my reflection;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever follows ne'ertheless may be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a-propos of hope or retrospection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As though the lurking thought had follow'd free.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All present life is but an interjection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An 'Oh!' or 'Ah!' of joy or misery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or a 'Ha! ha!' or 'Bah!'--a yawn, or 'Pooh!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of which perhaps the latter is most true.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, more or less, the whole's a syncope<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or a singultus--emblems of emotion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The grand antithesis to great ennui,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wherewith we break our bubbles on the ocean,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That watery outline of eternity,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or miniature at least, as is my notion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which ministers unto the soul's delight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In seeing matters which are out of sight.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But all are better than the sigh supprest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corroding in the cavern of the heart,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Making the countenance a masque of rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And turning human nature to an art.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Few men dare show their thoughts of worst or best;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dissimulation always sets apart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A corner for herself; and therefore fiction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is that which passes with least contradiction.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ah! who can tell? Or rather, who can not<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remember, without telling, passion's errors?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The drainer of oblivion, even the sot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hath got blue devils for his morning mirrors:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What though on Lethe's stream he seem to float,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He cannot sink his tremors or his terrors;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ruby glass that shakes within his hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leaves a sad sediment of Time's worst sand.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as for love--O love!--We will proceed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Lady Adeline Amundeville,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A pretty name as one would wish to read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Must perch harmonious on my tuneful quill.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's music in the sighing of a reed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's music in the gushing of a rill;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's music in all things, if men had ears:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their earth is but an echo of the spheres.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Lady Adeline, right honourable;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And honour'd, ran a risk of growing less so;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For few of the soft sex are very stable<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In their resolves--alas! that I should say so!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They differ as wine differs from its label,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When once decanted;--I presume to guess so,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But will not swear: yet both upon occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till old, may undergo adulteration.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Adeline was of the purest vintage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The unmingled essence of the grape; and yet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bright as a new Napoleon from its mintage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or glorious as a diamond richly set;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A page where Time should hesitate to print age,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And for which Nature might forego her debt--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sole creditor whose process doth involve in 't<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The luck of finding every body solvent.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O Death! thou dunnest of all duns! thou daily<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Knockest at doors, at first with modest tap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like a meek tradesman when, approaching palely,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some splendid debtor he would take by sap:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But oft denied, as patience 'gins to fail, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Advances with exasperated rap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And (if let in) insists, in terms unhandsome,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On ready money, or 'a draft on Ransom.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er thou takest, spare a while poor Beauty!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She is so rare, and thou hast so much prey.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What though she now and then may slip from duty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The more's the reason why you ought to stay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gaunt Gourmand! with whole nations for your booty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You should be civil in a modest way:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suppress, then, some slight feminine diseases,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And take as many heroes as Heaven pleases.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fair Adeline, the more ingenuous<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where she was interested (as was said),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because she was not apt, like some of us,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To like too readily, or too high bred<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To show it (points we need not now discuss)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Would give up artlessly both heart and head<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unto such feelings as seem'd innocent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For objects worthy of the sentiment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some parts of Juan's history, which Rumour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That live gazette, had scatter'd to disfigure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had heard; but women hear with more good humour<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such aberrations than we men of rigour:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides, his conduct, since in England, grew more<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Strict, and his mind assumed a manlier vigour;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because he had, like Alcibiades,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The art of living in all climes with ease.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His manner was perhaps the more seductive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he ne'er seem'd anxious to seduce;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing affected, studied, or constructive<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of coxcombry or conquest: no abuse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of his attractions marr'd the fair perspective,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To indicate a Cupidon broke loose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And seem to say, 'Resist us if you can'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which makes a dandy while it spoils a man.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They are wrong--that's not the way to set about it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As, if they told the truth, could well be shown.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, right or wrong, Don Juan was without it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, his manner was his own alone;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sincere he was--at least you could not doubt it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In listening merely to his voice's tone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The devil hath not in all his quiver's choice<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An arrow for the heart like a sweet voice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By nature soft, his whole address held off<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suspicion: though not timid, his regard<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was such as rather seem'd to keep aloof,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To shield himself than put you on your guard:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps 't was hardly quite assured enough,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But modesty's at times its own reward,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like virtue; and the absence of pretension<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will go much farther than there's need to mention.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Serene, accomplish'd, cheerful but not loud;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Insinuating without insinuation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Observant of the foibles of the crowd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet ne'er betraying this in conversation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Proud with the proud, yet courteously proud,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So as to make them feel he knew his station<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And theirs:--without a struggle for priority,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He neither brook'd nor claim'd superiority.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is, with men: with women he was what<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They pleased to make or take him for; and their<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Imagination's quite enough for that:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that the outline's tolerably fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They fill the canvas up--and 'verbum sat.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If once their phantasies be brought to bear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon an object, whether sad or playful,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They can transfigure brighter than a Raphael.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Adeline, no deep judge of character,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was apt to add a colouring from her own:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is thus the good will amiably err,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And eke the wise, as has been often shown.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Experience is the chief philosopher,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But saddest when his science is well known:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And persecuted sages teach the schools<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their folly in forgetting there are fools.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was it not so, great Locke? and greater Bacon?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Great Socrates? And thou, Diviner still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose lot it is by man to be mistaken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Redeeming worlds to be by bigots shaken,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How was thy toil rewarded? We might fill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Volumes with similar sad illustrations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But leave them to the conscience of the nations.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I perch upon an humbler promontory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst life's infinite variety:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With no great care for what is nicknamed glory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But speculating as I cast mine eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On what may suit or may not suit my story,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And never straining hard to versify,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I rattle on exactly as I 'd talk<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With any body in a ride or walk.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know that there may be much ability<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shown in this sort of desultory rhyme;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But there's a conversational facility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which may round off an hour upon a time.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of this I 'm sure at least, there's no servility<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In mine irregularity of chime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which rings what's uppermost of new or hoary,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just as I feel the 'Improvvisatore.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Omnia vult belle Matho dicere--dic aliquando<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Et bene, dic neutrum, dic aliquando male.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first is rather more than mortal can do;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second may be sadly done or gaily;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The third is still more difficult to stand to;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fourth we hear, and see, and say too, daily.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The whole together is what I could wish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To serve in this conundrum of a dish.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A modest hope--but modesty's my forte,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pride my feeble:--let us ramble on.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I meant to make this poem very short,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But now I can't tell where it may not run.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt, if I had wish' to pay my court<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To critics, or to hail the setting sun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of tyranny of all kinds, my concision<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were more;--but I was born for opposition.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then 't is mostly on the weaker side;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that I verily believe if they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who now are basking in their full-blown pride<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were shaken down, and 'dogs had had their day,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though at the first I might perchance deride<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their tumble, I should turn the other way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wax an ultra-royalist in loyalty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because I hate even democratic royalty.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think I should have made a decent spouse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If I had never proved the soft condition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think I should have made monastic vows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for my own peculiar superstition:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Gainst rhyme I never should have knock'd my brows,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor broken my own head, nor that of Priscian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor worn the motley mantle of a poet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If some one had not told me to forego it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But 'laissez aller'--knights and dames I sing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such as the times may furnish. 'T is a flight<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which seems at first to need no lofty wing,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Plumed by Longinus or the Stagyrite:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The difficultly lies in colouring<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Keeping the due proportions still in sight)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With nature manners which are artificial,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And rend'ring general that which is especial.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The difference is, that in the days of old<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Men made the manners; manners now make men--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pinn'd like a flock, and fleeced too in their fold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least nine, and a ninth beside of ten.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now this at all events must render cold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your writers, who must either draw again<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Days better drawn before, or else assume<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The present, with their common-place costume.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We 'll do our best to make the best on 't:--March!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; March, my Muse! If you cannot fly, yet flutter;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when you may not be sublime, be arch,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or starch, as are the edicts statesmen utter.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We surely may find something worth research:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Columbus found a new world in a cutter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or brigantine, or pink, of no great tonnage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While yet America was in her non-age.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Adeline, in all her growing sense<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Juan's merits and his situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Felt on the whole an interest intense,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Partly perhaps because a fresh sensation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or that he had an air of innocence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is for innocence a sad temptation,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As women hate half measures, on the whole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She 'gan to ponder how to save his soul.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had a good opinion of advice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like all who give and eke receive it gratis,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For which small thanks are still the market price,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even where the article at highest rate is:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She thought upon the subject twice or thrice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And morally decided, the best state is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For morals, marriage; and this question carried,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She seriously advised him to get married.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan replied, with all becoming deference,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He had a predilection for that tie;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But that, at present, with immediate reference<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To his own circumstances, there might lie<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some difficulties, as in his own preference,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or that of her to whom he might apply:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That still he 'd wed with such or such a lady,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If that they were not married all already.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next to the making matches for herself,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And daughters, brothers, sisters, kith or kin,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arranging them like books on the same shelf,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There's nothing women love to dabble in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More (like a stock-holder in growing pelf)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than match-making in general: 't is no sin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Certes, but a preventative, and therefore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That is, no doubt, the only reason wherefore.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But never yet (except of course a miss<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unwed, or mistress never to be wed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or wed already, who object to this)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was there chaste dame who had not in her head<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some drama of the marriage unities,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Observed as strictly both at board and bed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As those of Aristotle, though sometimes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They turn out melodrames or pantomimes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They generally have some only son,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some heir to a large property, some friend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of an old family, some gay Sir john,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or grave Lord George, with whom perhaps might end<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A line, and leave posterity undone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless a marriage was applied to mend<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The prospect and their morals: and besides,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They have at hand a blooming glut of brides.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From these they will be careful to select,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For this an heiress, and for that a beauty;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For one a songstress who hath no defect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For t' other one who promises much duty;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For this a lady no one can reject,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose sole accomplishments were quite a booty;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A second for her excellent connections;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A third, because there can be no objections.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Rapp the Harmonist embargo'd marriage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In his harmonious settlement (which flourishes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Strangely enough as yet without miscarriage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because it breeds no more mouths than it nourishes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without those sad expenses which disparage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What Nature naturally most encourages)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why call'd he 'Harmony' a state sans wedlock?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now here I 've got the preacher at a dead lock.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because he either meant to sneer at harmony<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or marriage, by divorcing them thus oddly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But whether reverend Rapp learn'd this in Germany<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or no, 't is said his sect is rich and godly,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pious and pure, beyond what I can term any<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of ours, although they propagate more broadly.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My objection's to his title, not his ritual,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although I wonder how it grew habitual.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Rapp is the reverse of zealous matrons,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who favour, malgre Malthus, generation--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Professors of that genial art, and patrons<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the modest part of propagation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which after all at such a desperate rate runs,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That half its produce tends to emigration,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That sad result of passions and potatoes--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two weeds which pose our economic Catos.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had Adeline read Malthus? I can't tell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wish she had: his book's the eleventh commandment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which says, 'Thou shalt not marry,' unless well:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This he (as far as I can understand) meant.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is not my purpose on his views to dwell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor canvass what so 'eminent a hand' meant;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But certes it conducts to lives ascetic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or turning marriage into arithmetic.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Adeline, who probably presumed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That Juan had enough of maintenance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or separate maintenance, in case 't was doom'd--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As on the whole it is an even chance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That bridegrooms, after they are fairly groom'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May retrograde a little in the dance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of marriage (which might form a painter's fame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like Holbein's 'Dance of Death'--but 't is the same);--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Adeline determined Juan's wedding<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In her own mind, and that's enough for woman:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then, with whom? There was the sage Miss Reading,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Miss Raw, Miss Flaw, Miss Showman, and Miss Knowman.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the two fair co-heiresses Giltbedding.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She deem'd his merits something more than common:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All these were unobjectionable matches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And might go on, if well wound up, like watches.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer's sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That usual paragon, an only daughter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who seem'd the cream of equanimity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Till skimm'd--and then there was some milk and water,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With a slight shade of blue too, it might be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beneath the surface; but what did it matter?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Love's riotous, but marriage should have quiet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And being consumptive, live on a milk diet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then there was the Miss Audacia Shoestring,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A dashing demoiselle of good estate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose heart was fix'd upon a star or blue string;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But whether English dukes grew rare of late,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or that she had not harp'd upon the true string,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By which such sirens can attract our great,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She took up with some foreign younger brother,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A Russ or Turk--the one's as good as t' other.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then there was--but why should I go on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unless the ladies should go off?--there was<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed a certain fair and fairy one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the best class, and better than her class,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aurora Raby, a young star who shone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'er life, too sweet an image for such glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lovely being, scarcely form'd or moulded,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rich, noble, but an orphan; left an only<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Child to the care of guardians good and kind;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still her aspect had an air so lonely!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blood is not water; and where shall we find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Feelings of youth like those which overthrown lie<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By death, when we are left, alas! behind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To feel, in friendless palaces, a home<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is wanting, and our best ties in the tomb?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Early in years, and yet more infantine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In figure, she had something of sublime<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In eyes which sadly shone, as seraphs' shine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All youth--but with an aspect beyond time;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Radiant and grave--as pitying man's decline;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mournful--but mournful of another's crime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She look'd as if she sat by Eden's door.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And grieved for those who could return no more.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She was a Catholic, too, sincere, austere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As far as her own gentle heart allow'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And deem'd that fallen worship far more dear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps because 't was fallen: her sires were proud<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of deeds and days when they had fill'd the ear<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of nations, and had never bent or bow'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To novel power; and as she was the last,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She held their old faith and old feelings fast.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She gazed upon a world she scarcely knew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And kept her heart serene within its zone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was awe in the homage which she drew;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her spirit seem'd as seated on a throne<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Apart from the surrounding world, and strong<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In its own strength--most strange in one so young!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now it so happen'd, in the catalogue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Adeline, Aurora was omitted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although her birth and wealth had given her vogue<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond the charmers we have already cited;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her beauty also seem'd to form no clog<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Against her being mention'd as well fitted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By many virtues, to be worth the trouble<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of single gentlemen who would be double.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And this omission, like that of the bust<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Brutus at the pageant of Tiberius,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Made Juan wonder, as no doubt he must.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This he express'd half smiling and half serious;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When Adeline replied with some disgust,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And with an air, to say the least, imperious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She marvell'd 'what he saw in such a baby<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As that prim, silent, cold Aurora Raby?'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan rejoin'd--'She was a Catholic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore fittest, as of his persuasion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since he was sure his mother would fall sick,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the Pope thunder excommunication,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If-' But here Adeline, who seem'd to pique<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Herself extremely on the inoculation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of others with her own opinions, stated--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As usual--the same reason which she late did.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wherefore not? A reasonable reason,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If good, is none the worse for repetition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If bad, the best way's certainly to tease on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And amplify: you lose much by concision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whereas insisting in or out of season<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Convinces all men, even a politician;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or--what is just the same--it wearies out.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So the end's gain'd, what signifies the route?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Why Adeline had this slight prejudice--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For prejudice it was--against a creature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As pure as sanctity itself from vice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all the added charm of form and feature,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For me appears a question far too nice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since Adeline was liberal by nature;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But nature's nature, and has more caprices<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than I have time, or will, to take to pieces.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps she did not like the quiet way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With which Aurora on those baubles look'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which charm most people in their earlier day:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For there are few things by mankind less brook'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And womankind too, if we so may say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than finding thus their genius stand rebuked,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like 'Anthony's by Caesar,' by the few<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who look upon them as they ought to do.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not envy--Adeline had none;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her place was far beyond it, and her mind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not scorn--which could not light on one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose greatest fault was leaving few to find.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not jealousy, I think: but shun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Following the 'ignes fatui' of mankind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not--but 't is easier far, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To say what it was not than what it was.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Little Aurora deem'd she was the theme<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of such discussion. She was there a guest;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A beauteous ripple of the brilliant stream<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of rank and youth, though purer than the rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which flow'd on for a moment in the beam<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time sheds a moment o'er each sparkling crest.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had she known this, she would have calmly smiled--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She had so much, or little, of the child.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The dashing and proud air of Adeline<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Much as she would have seen a glow-worm shine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then turn'd unto the stars for loftier rays.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan was something she could not divine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being no sibyl in the new world's ways;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because she did not pin her faith on feature.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His fame too,--for he had that kind of fame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Half virtues and whole vices being combined;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Faults which attract because they are not tame;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Follies trick'd out so brightly that they blind:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These seals upon her wax made no impression,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such was her coldness or her self-possession.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan knew nought of such a character--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; High, yet resembling not his lost Haidee;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet each was radiant in her proper sphere:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The island girl, bred up by the lone sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More warm, as lovely, and not less sincere,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was Nature's all: Aurora could not be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nor would be thus:--the difference in them<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was such as lies between a flower and gem.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Having wound up with this sublime comparison,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Methinks we may proceed upon our narrative,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, as my friend Scott says, 'I sound my warison;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scott, the superlative of my comparative--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Scott, who can paint your Christian knight or Saracen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Serf, lord, man, with such skill as none would share it, if<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There had not been one Shakspeare and Voltaire,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of one or both of whom he seems the heir.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I say, in my slight way I may proceed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To play upon the surface of humanity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I write the world, nor care if the world read,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least for this I cannot spare its vanity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My Muse hath bred, and still perhaps may breed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More foes by this same scroll: when I began it, I<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thought that it might turn out so--now I know it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still I am, or was, a pretty poet.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The conference or congress (for it ended<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As congresses of late do) of the Lady<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Adeline and Don Juan rather blended<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some acids with the sweets--for she was heady;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, ere the matter could be marr'd or mended,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The silvery bell rang, not for 'dinner ready,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But for that hour, call'd half-hour, given to dress,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though ladies' robes seem scant enough for less.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Great things were now to be achieved at table,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With massy plate for armour, knives and forks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For weapons; but what Muse since Homer's able<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (His feasts are not the worst part of his works)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To draw up in array a single day-bill<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of modern dinners? where more mystery lurks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In soups or sauces, or a sole ragout,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a goodly'soupe a la bonne femme,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though God knows whence it came from; there was, too,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A turbot for relief of those who cram,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Relieved with 'dindon a la Parigeux;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How shall I get this gourmand stanza through?--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'soupe a la Beauveau,' whose relief was dory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Relieved itself by pork, for greater glory.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I must crowd all into one grand mess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or mass; for should I stretch into detail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My Muse would run much more into excess,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than when some squeamish people deem her frail.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But though a 'bonne vivante,' I must confess<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her stomach's not her peccant part; this tale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However doth require some slight refection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Just to relieve her spirits from dejection.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fowls 'a la Conde,' slices eke of salmon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With'sauces Genevoises,' and haunch of venison;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Wines too, which might again have slain young Ammon--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A man like whom I hope we shan't see many soon;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They also set a glazed Westphalian ham on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whereon Apicius would bestow his benison;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then there was champagne with foaming whirls,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then there was God knows what 'a l'Allemande,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'A l'Espagnole,' 'timballe,' and'salpicon'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With things I can't withstand or understand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though swallow'd with much zest upon the whole;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And 'entremets' to piddle with at hand,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gently to lull down the subsiding soul;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While great Lucullus' Robe triumphal muffles<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (There's fame) young partridge fillets, deck'd with truffles.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What are the fillets on the victor's brow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To these? They are rags or dust. Where is the arch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which nodded to the nation's spoils below?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the triumphal chariots' haughty march?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gone to where victories must like dinners go.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Farther I shall not follow the research:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But oh! ye modern heroes with your cartridges,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When will your names lend lustre e'en to partridges?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Those truffles too are no bad accessaries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Follow'd by 'petits puits d'amour'--a dish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of which perhaps the cookery rather varies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So every one may dress it to his wish,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; According to the best of dictionaries,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which encyclopedize both flesh and fish;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But even sans 'confitures,' it no less true is,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There's pretty picking in those 'petits puits.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The mind is lost in mighty contemplation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of intellect expanded on two courses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And indigestion's grand multiplication<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Requires arithmetic beyond my forces.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who would suppose, from Adam's simple ration,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That cookery could have call'd forth such resources,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As form a science and a nomenclature<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From out the commonest demands of nature?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The glasses jingled, and the palates tingled;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The diners of celebrity dined well;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ladies with more moderation mingled<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the feast, pecking less than I can tell;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also the younger men too: for a springald<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can't, like ripe age, in gormandize excel,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But thinks less of good eating than the whisper<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (When seated next him) of some pretty lisper.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! I must leave undescribed the gibier,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The salmi, the consomme, the puree,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All which I use to make my rhymes run glibber<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than could roast beef in our rough John Bull way:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I must not introduce even a spare rib here,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Bubble and squeak' would spoil my liquid lay:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I have dined, and must forego, Alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The chaste description even of a 'becasse;'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And fruits, and ice, and all that art refines<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From nature for the service of the gout--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Taste or the gout,--pronounce it as inclines<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your stomach! Ere you dine, the French will do;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But after, there are sometimes certain signs<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which prove plain English truer of the two.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hast ever had the gout? I have not had it--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I may have, and you too, reader, dread it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The simple olives, best allies of wine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Must I pass over in my bill of fare?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I must, although a favourite 'plat' of mine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Spain, and Lucca, Athens, every where:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On them and bread 't was oft my luck to dine,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The grass my table-cloth, in open-air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On Sunium or Hymettus, like Diogenes,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of whom half my philosophy the progeny is.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amidst this tumult of fish, flesh, and 'fowl,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And vegetables, all in masquerade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The guests were placed according to their roll,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But various as the various meats display'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan sat next 'an l'Espagnole'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No damsel, but a dish, as hath been said;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But so far like a lady, that 't was drest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Superbly, and contain'd a world of zest.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By some odd chance too, he was placed between<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aurora and the Lady Adeline--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A situation difficult, I ween,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For man therein, with eyes and heart, to dine.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also the conference which we have seen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was not such as to encourage him to shine;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Adeline, addressing few words to him,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With two transcendent eyes seem'd to look through him.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I sometimes almost think that eyes have ears:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This much is sure, that, out of earshot, things<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are somehow echoed to the pretty dears,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which I can't tell whence their knowledge springs.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like that same mystic music of the spheres,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which no one bears, so loudly though it rings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is wonderful how oft the sex have heard<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Long dialogues--which pass'd without a word!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aurora sat with that indifference<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which piques a preux chevalier--as it ought:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all offences that's the worst offence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now Juan, though no coxcomb in pretence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was not exactly pleased to be so caught;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like a good ship entangled among ice,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And after so much excellent advice.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To his gay nothings, nothing was replied,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or something which was nothing, as urbanity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Required. Aurora scarcely look'd aside,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The devil was in the girl! Could it be pride?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Heaven knows? But Adeline's malicious eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sparkled with her successful prophecies,<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And look'd as much as if to say, 'I said it;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A kind of triumph I 'll not recommend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because it sometimes, as I have seen or read it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both in the case of lover and of friend,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will pique a gentleman, for his own credit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To bring what was a jest to a serious end:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For all men prophesy what is or was,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And hate those who won't let them come to pass.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan was drawn thus into some attentions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Slight but select, and just enough to express,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To females of perspicuous comprehensions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he would rather make them more than less.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aurora at the last (so history mentions,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though probably much less a fact than guess)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So far relax'd her thoughts from their sweet prison,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As once or twice to smile, if not to listen.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From answering she began to question; this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With her was rare: and Adeline, who as yet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thought her predictions went not much amiss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Began to dread she'd thaw to a coquette--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So very difficult, they say, it is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To keep extremes from meeting, when once set<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In motion; but she here too much refined--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aurora's spirit was not of that kind.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan had a sort of winning way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A proud humility, if such there be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which show'd such deference to what females say,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if each charming word were a decree.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His tact, too, temper'd him from grave to gay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And taught him when to be reserved or free:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had the art of drawing people out,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without their seeing what he was about.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aurora, who in her indifference<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Confounded him in common with the crowd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of flatterers, though she deem'd he had more sense<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than whispering foplings, or than witlings loud--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Commenced (from such slight things will great commence)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To feel that flattery which attracts the proud<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rather by deference than compliment,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And wins even by a delicate dissent.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then he had good looks;--that point was carried<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nem. con. amongst the women, which I grieve<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To say leads oft to crim. con. with the married--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A case which to the juries we may leave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since with digressions we too long have tarried.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now though we know of old that looks deceive,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And always have done, somehow these good looks<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Make more impression than the best of books.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aurora, who look'd more on books than faces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was very young, although so very sage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Admiring more Minerva than the Graces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially upon a printed page.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Virtue's self, with all her tightest laces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has not the natural stays of strict old age;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Socrates, that model of all duty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Own'd to a penchant, though discreet, for beauty.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And girls of sixteen are thus far Socratic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But innocently so, as Socrates;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And really, if the sage sublime and Attic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At seventy years had phantasies like these,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which Plato in his dialogues dramatic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has shown, I know not why they should displease<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In virgins--always in a modest way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Observe; for that with me's a'sine qua.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also observe, that, like the great Lord Coke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (See Littleton), whene'er I have express'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Opinions two, which at first sight may look<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Twin opposites, the second is the best.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps I have a third, too, in a nook,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or none at all--which seems a sorry jest:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But if a writer should be quite consistent,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How could he possibly show things existent?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If people contradict themselves, can<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Help contradicting them, and every body,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even my veracious self?--But that's a lie:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never did so, never will--how should I?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He who doubts all things nothing can deny:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Truth's fountains may be clear--her streams are muddy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And cut through such canals of contradiction,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That she must often navigate o'er fiction.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Apologue, fable, poesy, and parable,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are false, but may he render'd also true,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By those who sow them in a land that's arable.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is wonderful what fable will not do!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is said it makes reality more bearable:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But what's reality? Who has its clue?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Philosophy? No: she too much rejects.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Religion? Yes; but which of all her sects?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some millions must be wrong, that's pretty dear;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps it may turn out that all were right.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; God help us! Since we have need on our career<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To keep our holy beacons always bright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is time that some new prophet should appear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or old indulge man with a second sight.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Opinions wear out in some thousand years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without a small refreshment from the spheres.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here again, why will I thus entangle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Myself with metaphysics? None can hate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So much as I do any kind of wrangle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet, such is my folly, or my fate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I always knock my head against some angle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About the present, past, or future state.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet I wish well to Trojan and to Tyrian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For I was bred a moderate Presbyterian.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But though I am a temperate theologian,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And also meek as a metaphysician,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Impartial between Tyrian and Trojan,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Eldon on a lunatic commission--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In politics my duty is to show John<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bull something of the lower world's condition.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It makes my blood boil like the springs of Hecla,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To see men let these scoundrel sovereigns break law.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But politics, and policy, and piety,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are topics which I sometimes introduce,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not only for the sake of their variety,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as subservient to a moral use;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because my business is to dress society,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And stuff with sage that very verdant goose.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now, that we may furnish with some matter all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tastes, we are going to try the supernatural.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And now I will give up all argument;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And positively henceforth no temptation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shall 'fool me to the top up of my bent:'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, I' ll begin a thorough reformation.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed, I never knew what people meant<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By deeming that my Muse's conversation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was dangerous;--I think she is as harmless<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As some who labour more and yet may charm less.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Grim reader! did you ever see a ghost?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No; but you have heard--I understand--be dumb!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And don't regret the time you may have lost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For you have got that pleasure still to come:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And do not think I mean to sneer at most<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of these things, or by ridicule benumb<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That source of the sublime and the mysterious:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For certain reasons my belief is serious.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Serious? You laugh;--you may: that will I not;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My smiles must be sincere or not at all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I say I do believe a haunted spot<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exists--and where? That shall I not recall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because I 'd rather it should be forgot,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'shadows the soul of Richard' may appal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In short, upon that subject I 've some qualms very<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like those of the philosopher of Malmsbury.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The night (I sing by night--sometimes an owl,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And now and then a nightingale) is dim,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the loud shriek of sage Minerva's fowl<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rattles around me her discordant hymn:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Old portraits from old walls upon me scowl--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wish to heaven they would not look so grim;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The dying embers dwindle in the grate--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I think too that I have sate up too late:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, though 't is by no means my way<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To rhyme at noon--when I have other things<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To think of, if I ever think--I say<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel some chilly midnight shudderings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And prudently postpone, until mid-day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Treating a topic which, alas! but brings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shadows;--but you must be in my condition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before you learn to call this superstition.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Between two worlds life hovers like a star,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon's verge.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How little do we know that which we are!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How less what we may be! The eternal surge<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of time and tide rolls on, and bears afar<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lash'd from the foam of ages; while the graves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of empires heave but like some passing waves.<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="axvi">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;            CANTO THE SIXTEENTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; THE antique Persians taught three useful things,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To draw the bow, to ride, and speak the truth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This was the mode of Cyrus, best of kings--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A mode adopted since by modern youth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bows have they, generally with two strings;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Horses they ride without remorse or ruth;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At speaking truth perhaps they are less clever,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But draw the long bow better now than ever.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The cause of this effect, or this defect,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'For this effect defective comes by cause,'--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is what I have not leisure to inspect;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But this I must say in my own applause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the Muses that I recollect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er may be her follies or her flaws<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In some things, mine's beyond all contradiction<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The most sincere that ever dealt in fiction.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And as she treats all things, and ne'er retreats<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From any thing, this epic will contain<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A wilderness of the most rare conceits,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which you might elsewhere hope to find in vain.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is true there be some bitters with the sweets,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet mix'd so slightly, that you can't complain,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But wonder they so few are, since my tale is<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'De rebus cunctis et quibusdam aliis.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But of all truths which she has told, the most<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; True is that which she is about to tell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I said it was a story of a ghost--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What then? I only know it so befell.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have you explored the limits of the coast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where all the dwellers of the earth must dwell?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is time to strike such puny doubters dumb as<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sceptics who would not believe Columbus.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some people would impose now with authority,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Turpin's or Monmouth Geoffry's Chronicle;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Men whose historical superiority<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is always greatest at a miracle.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Saint Augustine has the great priority,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who bids all men believe the impossible,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because 't is so. Who nibble, scribble, quibble, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Quiets at once with 'quia impossibile.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore, mortals, cavil not at all;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Believe:--if 't is improbable you must,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And if it is impossible, you shall:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is always best to take things upon trust.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I do not speak profanely, to recall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those holier mysteries which the wise and just<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Receive as gospel, and which grow more rooted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As all truths must, the more they are disputed:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I merely mean to say what Johnson said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That in the course of some six thousand years,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All nations have believed that from the dead<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A visitant at intervals appears;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And what is strangest upon this strange head,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is, that whatever bar the reason rears<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Gainst such belief, there's something stronger still<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In its behalf, let those deny who will.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The dinner and the soiree too were done,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The supper too discuss'd, the dames admired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The banqueteers had dropp'd off one by one--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The song was silent, and the dance expired:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The last thin petticoats were vanish'd, gone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like fleecy Clouds into the sky retired,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And nothing brighter gleam'd through the saloon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than dying tapers--and the peeping moon.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The evaporation of a joyous day<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is like the last glass of champagne, without<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or like a system coupled with a doubt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or like a soda bottle when its spray<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Has sparkled and let half its spirit out;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or like a billow left by storms behind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Without the animation of the wind;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or like an opiate, which brings troubled rest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or none; or like--like nothing that I know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Except itself;--such is the human breast;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A thing, of which similitudes can show<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No real likeness,--like the old Tyrian vest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dyed purple, none at present can tell how,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If from a shell-fish or from cochineal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So perish every tyrant's robe piece-meal!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But next to dressing for a rout or ball,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Undressing is a woe; our robe de chambre<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; May sit like that of Nessus, and recall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thoughts quite as yellow, but less clear than amber.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Titus exclaim'd, 'I 've lost a day!' Of all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The nights and days most people can remember<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (I have had of both, some not to be disdain'd),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish they 'd state how many they have gain'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan, on retiring for the night,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Felt restless, and perplex'd, and compromised:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He thought Aurora Raby's eyes more bright<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than Adeline (such is advice) advised;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If he had known exactly his own plight,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He probably would have philosophised:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A great resource to all, and ne'er denied<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till wanted; therefore Juan only sigh'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He sigh'd;--the next resource is the full moon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where all sighs are deposited; and now<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It happen'd luckily, the chaste orb shone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As clear as such a climate will allow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan's mind was in the proper tone<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hail her with the apostrophe--'O thou!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of amatory egotism the Tuism,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which further to explain would be a truism.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But lover, poet, or astronomer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shepherd, or swain, whoever may behold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Feel some abstraction when they gaze on her:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Great thoughts we catch from thence (besides a cold<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes, unless my feelings rather err);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Deep secrets to her rolling light are told;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ocean's tides and mortals' brains she sways,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And also hearts, if there be truth in lays.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan felt somewhat pensive, and disposed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For contemplation rather than his pillow:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Gothic chamber, where he was enclosed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Let in the rippling sound of the lake's billow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With all the mystery by midnight caused;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Below his window waved (of course) a willow;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And he stood gazing out on the cascade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That flash'd and after darken'd in the shade.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon his table or his toilet,--which<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of these is not exactly ascertain'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (I state this, for I am cautious to a pitch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of nicety, where a fact is to be gain'd),--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A lamp burn'd high, while he leant from a niche,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where many a Gothic ornament remain'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In chisell'd stone and painted glass, and all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That time has left our fathers of their hall.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then, as the night was clear though cold, he threw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His chamber door wide open--and went forth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Into a gallery, of a sombre hue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Long, furnish'd with old pictures of great worth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of knights and dames heroic and chaste too,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As doubtless should be people of high birth.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But by dim lights the portraits of the dead<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have something ghastly, desolate, and dread.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The forms of the grim knight and pictured saint<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look living in the moon; and as you turn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Backward and forward to the echoes faint<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of your own footsteps--voices from the urn<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Appear to wake, and shadows wild and quaint<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Start from the frames which fence their aspects stern,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if to ask how you can dare to keep<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A vigil there, where all but death should sleep.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the pale smile of beauties in the grave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The charms of other days, in starlight gleams,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Glimmer on high; their buried locks still wave<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Along the canvas; their eyes glance like dreams<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On ours, or spars within some dusky cave,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But death is imaged in their shadowy beams.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A picture is the past; even ere its frame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Be gilt, who sate hath ceased to be the same.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As Juan mused on mutability,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or on his mistress--terms synonymous--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No sound except the echo of his sigh<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or step ran sadly through that antique house;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When suddenly he heard, or thought so, nigh,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A supernatural agent--or a mouse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whose little nibbling rustle will embarrass<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most people as it plays along the arras.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was no mouse, but lo! a monk, array'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In cowl and beads and dusky garb, appear'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now in the moonlight, and now lapsed in shade,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With steps that trod as heavy, yet unheard;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His garments only a slight murmur made;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He moved as shadowy as the sisters weird,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But slowly; and as he pass'd Juan by,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Glanced, without pausing, on him a bright eye.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan was petrified; he had heard a hint<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of such a spirit in these halls of old,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But thought, like most men, there was nothing in 't<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beyond the rumour which such spots unfold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Coin'd from surviving superstition's mint,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which passes ghosts in currency like gold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But rarely seen, like gold compared with paper.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And did he see this? or was it a vapour?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Once, twice, thrice pass'd, repass'd--the thing of air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or earth beneath, or heaven, or t' other place;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan gazed upon it with a stare,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet could not speak or move; but, on its base<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As stands a statue, stood: he felt his hair<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Twine like a knot of snakes around his face;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He tax'd his tongue for words, which were not granted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To ask the reverend person what he wanted.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The third time, after a still longer pause,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The shadow pass'd away--but where? the hall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was long, and thus far there was no great cause<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To think his vanishing unnatural:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Doors there were many, through which, by the laws<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of physics, bodies whether short or tall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Might come or go; but Juan could not state<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Through which the spectre seem'd to evaporate.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He stood--how long he knew not, but it seem'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An age--expectant, powerless, with his eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Strain'd on the spot where first the figure gleam'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then by degrees recall'd his energies,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And would have pass'd the whole off as a dream,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But could not wake; he was, he did surmise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Waking already, and return'd at length<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Back to his chamber, shorn of half his strength.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All there was as he left it: still his taper<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Burnt, and not blue, as modest tapers use,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Receiving sprites with sympathetic vapour;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He rubb'd his eyes, and they did not refuse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their office; he took up an old newspaper;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The paper was right easy to peruse;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He read an article the king attacking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And a long eulogy of 'patent blacking.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This savour'd of this world; but his hand shook--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He shut his door, and after having read<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A paragraph, I think about Horne Tooke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Undrest, and rather slowly went to bed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There, couch'd all snugly on his pillow's nook,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With what he had seen his phantasy he fed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And though it was no opiate, slumber crept<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Upon him by degrees, and so he slept.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He woke betimes; and, as may be supposed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ponder'd upon his visitant or vision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And whether it ought not to be disclosed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At risk of being quizz'd for superstition.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The more he thought, the more his mind was posed:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the mean time, his valet, whose precision<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was great, because his master brook'd no less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Knock'd to inform him it was time to dress.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He dress'd; and like young people he was wont<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To take some trouble with his toilet, but<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This morning rather spent less time upon 't;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aside his very mirror soon was put;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His curls fell negligently o'er his front,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His clothes were not curb'd to their usual cut,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His very neckcloth's Gordian knot was tied<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Almost an hair's breadth too much on one side.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And when he walk'd down into the saloon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sate him pensive o'er a dish of tea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which he perhaps had not discover'd soon,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had it not happen'd scalding hot to be,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which made him have recourse unto his spoon;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So much distrait he was, that all could see<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That something was the matter--Adeline<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first--but what she could not well divine.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She look'd, and saw him pale, and turn'd as pale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Herself; then hastily look'd down, and mutter'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Something, but what's not stated in my tale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry said his muffin was ill butter'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Duchess of Fitz-Fulke play'd with her veil,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And look'd at Juan hard, but nothing utter'd.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aurora Raby with her large dark eyes<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Survey'd him with a kind of calm surprise.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But seeing him all cold and silent still,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And everybody wondering more or less,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fair Adeline enquired, 'If he were ill?'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He started, and said, 'Yes--no--rather--yes.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The family physician had great skill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And being present, now began to express<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His readiness to feel his pulse and tell<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The cause, but Juan said, 'He was quite well.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Quite well; yes,--no.'--These answers were mysterious,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And yet his looks appear'd to sanction both,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However they might savour of delirious;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Something like illness of a sudden growth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Weigh'd on his spirit, though by no means serious:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But for the rest, as he himself seem'd loth<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To state the case, it might be ta'en for granted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not the physician that he wanted.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry, who had now discuss'd his chocolate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also the muffin whereof he complain'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Said, Juan had not got his usual look elate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At which he marvell'd, since it had not rain'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then ask'd her Grace what news were of the duke of late?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her Grace replied, his Grace was rather pain'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With some slight, light, hereditary twinges<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of gout, which rusts aristocratic hinges.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then Henry turn'd to Juan, and address'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A few words of condolence on his state:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'You look,' quoth he, 'as if you had had your rest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Broke in upon by the Black Friar of late.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'What friar?' said Juan; and he did his best<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To put the question with an air sedate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or careless; but the effort was not valid<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To hinder him from growing still more pallid.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Oh! have you never heard of the Black Friar?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The spirit of these walls?'--'In truth not I.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Why Fame--but Fame you know's sometimes a liar--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tells an odd story, of which by and by:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether with time the spectre has grown shyer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or that our sires had a more gifted eye<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For such sights, though the tale is half believed,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The friar of late has not been oft perceived.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Who watch'd the changes of Don Juan's brow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And from its context thought she could divine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Connexions stronger then he chose to avow<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With this same legend)--'if you but design<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To jest, you 'll choose some other theme just now,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because the present tale has oft been told,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And is not much improved by growing old.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Jest!' quoth Milor; 'why, Adeline, you know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That we ourselves--'t was in the honey-moon--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, come, I 'll set your story to a tune.'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Graceful as Dian, when she draws her bow,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She seized her harp, whose strings were kindled soon<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As touch'd, and plaintively began to play<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The air of ''T was a Friar of Orders Gray.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'But add the words,' cried Henry, 'which you made;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Adeline is half a poetess,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Turning round to the rest, he smiling said.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of course the others could not but express<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In courtesy their wish to see display'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By one three talents, for there were no less--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The voice, the words, the harper's skill, at once<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Could hardly be united by a dunce.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After some fascinating hesitation,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The charming of these charmers, who seem bound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I can't tell why, to this dissimulation,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fair Adeline, with eyes fix'd on the ground<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At first, then kindling into animation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Added her sweet voice to the lyric sound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And sang with much simplicity,--a merit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not the less precious, that we seldom hear it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Beware! beware! of the Black Friar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Who sitteth by Norman stone,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    For he mutters his prayer in the midnight air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      And his mass of the days that are gone.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    When the Lord of the Hill, Amundeville,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Made Norman Church his prey,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    And expell'd the friars, one friar still<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Would not be driven away.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Though he came in his might, with King Henry's right,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      To turn church lands to lay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    With sword in hand, and torch to light<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Their walls, if they said nay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    A monk remain'd, unchased, unchain'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      And he did not seem form'd of clay,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    For he's seen in the porch, and he's seen in the church,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Though he is not seen by day.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    And whether for good, or whether for ill,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      It is not mine to say;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    But still with the house of Amundeville<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      He abideth night and day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    By the marriage-bed of their lords, 't is said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      He flits on the bridal eve;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    And 't is held as faith, to their bed of death<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      He comes--but not to grieve.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    When an heir is born, he's heard to mourn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      And when aught is to befall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    That ancient line, in the "we moonshine<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      He walks from hall to hall.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    His form you may trace, but not his face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      'T is shadow'd by his cowl;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    But his eyes may be seen from the folds between,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      And they seem of a parted soul.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    But beware! beware! of the Black Friar,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      He still retains his sway,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    For he is yet the church's heir<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Whoever may be the lay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Amundeville is lord by day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      But the monk is lord by night;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Nor wine nor wassail could raise a vassal<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      To question that friar's right.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Say nought to him as he walks the hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      And he 'll say nought to you;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    He sweeps along in his dusky pall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      As o'er the grass the dew.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Then grammercy! for the Black Friar;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Heaven sain him, fair or foul!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    And whatsoe'er may be his prayer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      Let ours be for his soul.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lady's voice ceased, and the thrilling wires<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Died from the touch that kindled them to sound;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the pause follow'd, which when song expires<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pervades a moment those who listen round;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then of course the circle much admires,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor less applauds, as in politeness bound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The tones, the feeling, and the execution,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the performer's diffident confusion.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Fair Adeline, though in a careless way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As if she rated such accomplishment<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the mere pastime of an idle day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pursued an instant for her own content,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would now and then as 't were without display,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet with display in fact, at times relent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To such performances with haughty smile,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To show she could, if it were worth her while.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now this (but we will whisper it aside)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was--pardon the pedantic illustration--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Trampling on Plato's pride with greater pride,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As did the Cynic on some like occasion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Deeming the sage would be much mortified,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or thrown into a philosophic passion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For a spoil'd carpet--but the 'Attic Bee'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was much consoled by his own repartee.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus Adeline would throw into the shade<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (By doing easily, whene'er she chose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What dilettanti do with vast parade)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their sort of half profession; for it grows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To something like this when too oft display'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that it is so everybody knows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who have heard Miss That or This, or Lady T'other,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Show off--to please their company or mother.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Oh! the long evenings of duets and trios!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The admirations and the speculations;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The 'Mamma Mia's!' and the 'Amor Mio's!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 'Tanti palpiti's' on such occasions:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The 'Lasciami's,' and quavering 'Addio's!'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst our own most musical of nations;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With 'Tu mi chamas's' from Portingale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To soothe our ears, lest Italy should fail.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Babylon's bravuras--as the home<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heart-ballads of Green Erin or Gray Highlands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That bring Lochaber back to eyes that roam<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; O'er far Atlantic continents or islands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The calentures of music which o'ercome<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All mountaineers with dreams that they are nigh lands,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No more to be beheld but in such visions--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was Adeline well versed, as compositions.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She also had a twilight tinge of 'Blue,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could write rhymes, and compose more than she wrote,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Made epigrams occasionally too<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon her friends, as everybody ought.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still from that sublimer azure hue,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So much the present dye, she was remote;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was weak enough to deem Pope a great poet,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And what was worse, was not ashamed to show it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aurora--since we are touching upon taste,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which now-a-days is the thermometer<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By whose degrees all characters are class'd--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was more Shakspearian, if I do not err.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The worlds beyond this world's perplexing waste<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had more of her existence, for in her<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a depth of feeling to embrace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thoughts, boundless, deep, but silent too as Space.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not so her gracious, graceful, graceless Grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The full-grown Hebe of Fitz-Fulke, whose mind,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If she had any, was upon her face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And that was of a fascinating kind.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A little turn for mischief you might trace<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also thereon,--but that's not much; we find<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Few females without some such gentle leaven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For fear we should suppose us quite in heaven.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have not heard she was at all poetic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though once she was seen reading the 'Bath Guide,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And 'Hayley's Triumphs,' which she deem'd pathetic,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because she said her temper had been tried<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So much, the bard had really been prophetic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of what she had gone through with--since a bride.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But of all verse, what most ensured her praise<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were sonnets to herself, or 'bouts rimes.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T were difficult to say what was the object<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Adeline, in bringing this same lay<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To bear on what appear'd to her the subject<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of Juan's nervous feelings on that day.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps she merely had the simple project<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To laugh him out of his supposed dismay;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps she might wish to confirm him in it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though why I cannot say--at least this minute.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But so far the immediate effect<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was to restore him to his self-propriety,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A thing quite necessary to the elect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who wish to take the tone of their society:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In which you cannot be too circumspect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whether the mode be persiflage or piety,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But wear the newest mantle of hypocrisy,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On pain of much displeasing the gynocracy.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And therefore Juan now began to rally<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His spirits, and without more explanation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To jest upon such themes in many a sally.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her Grace, too, also seized the same occasion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With various similar remarks to tally,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But wish'd for a still more detail'd narration<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of this same mystic friar's curious doings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; About the present family's deaths and wooings.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of these few could say more than has been said;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They pass'd as such things do, for superstition<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With some, while others, who had more in dread<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The theme, half credited the strange tradition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And much was talk'd on all sides on that head:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan, when cross-question'd on the vision,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which some supposed (though he had not avow'd it)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had stirr'd him, answer'd in a way to cloud it.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then, the mid-day having worn to one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The company prepared to separate;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some to their several pastimes, or to none,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some wondering 't was so early, some so late.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a goodly match too, to be run<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Between some greyhounds on my lord's estate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And a young race-horse of old pedigree<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Match'd for the spring, whom several went to see.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a picture-dealer who had brought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A special Titian, warranted original,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So precious that it was not to be bought,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though princes the possessor were besieging all.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The king himself had cheapen'd it, but thought<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The civil list he deigns to accept (obliging all<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His subjects by his gracious acceptation)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Too scanty, in these times of low taxation.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But as Lord Henry was a connoisseur,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The friend of artists, if not arts,--the owner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With motives the most classical and pure,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So that he would have been the very donor,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rather than seller, had his wants been fewer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So much he deem'd his patronage an honour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had brought the capo d'opera, not for sale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But for his judgment--never known to fail.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a modern Goth, I mean a Gothic<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bricklayer of Babel, call'd an architect,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Brought to survey these grey walls, which though so thick,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Might have from time acquired some slight defect;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who after rummaging the Abbey through thick<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thin, produced a plan whereby to erect<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; New buildings of correctest conformation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And throw down old--which he call'd restoration.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The cost would be a trifle--an 'old song,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set to some thousands ('t is the usual burden<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of that same tune, when people hum it long)--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The price would speedily repay its worth in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An edifice no less sublime than strong,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By which Lord Henry's good taste would go forth in<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its glory, through all ages shining sunny,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Gothic daring shown in English money.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were two lawyers busy on a mortgage<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry wish'd to raise for a new purchase;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also a lawsuit upon tenures burgage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And one on tithes, which sure are Discord's torches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Kindling Religion till she throws down her gage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Untying' squires 'to fight against the churches;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a prize ox, a prize pig, and ploughman,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Henry was a sort of Sabine showman.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were two poachers caught in a steel trap,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ready for gaol, their place of convalescence;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a country girl in a close cap<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And scarlet cloak (I hate the sight to see, since--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since--since--in youth, I had the sad mishap--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But luckily I have paid few parish fees since):<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That scarlet cloak, alas! unclosed with rigour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Presents the problem of a double figure.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A reel within a bottle is a mystery,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One can't tell how it e'er got in or out;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore the present piece of natural history<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I leave to those who are fond of solving doubt;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And merely state, though not for the consistory,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry was a justice, and that Scout<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The constable, beneath a warrant's banner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had bagg'd this poacher upon Nature's manor.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now justices of peace must judge all pieces<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of mischief of all kinds, and keep the game<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And morals of the country from caprices<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of those who have not a license for the same;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And of all things, excepting tithes and leases,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps these are most difficult to tame:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Preserving partridges and pretty wenches<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are puzzles to the most precautious benches.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The present culprit was extremely pale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pale as if painted so; her cheek being red<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By nature, as in higher dames less hale<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is white, at least when they just rise from bed.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps she was ashamed of seeming frail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Poor soul! for she was country born and bred,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And knew no better in her immorality<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Than to wax white--for blushes are for quality.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her black, bright, downcast, yet espiegle eye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had gather'd a large tear into its corner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which the poor thing at times essay'd to dry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For she was not a sentimental mourner<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Parading all her sensibility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor insolent enough to scorn the scorner,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But stood in trembling, patient tribulation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To be call'd up for her examination.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course these groups were scatter'd here and there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not nigh the gay saloon of ladies gent.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The lawyers in the study; and in air<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The prize pig, ploughman, poachers; the men sent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From town, viz., architect and dealer, were<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both busy (as a general in his tent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Writing despatches) in their several stations,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exulting in their brilliant lucubrations.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But this poor girl was left in the great hall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While Scout, the parish guardian of the frail,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Discuss'd (he hated beer yclept the'small')<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A mighty mug of moral double ale.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; She waited until justice could recall<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its kind attentions to their proper pale,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To name a thing in nomenclature rather<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perplexing for most virgins--a child's father.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You see here was enough of occupation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the Lord Henry, link'd with dogs and horses.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was much bustle too, and preparation<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Below stairs on the score of second courses;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because, as suits their rank and situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those who in counties have great land resources<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have 'Public days,' when all men may carouse,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though not exactly what's call'd 'open house.'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But once a week or fortnight, uninvited<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Thus we translate a general invitation),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All country gentlemen, esquired or knighted,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; May drop in without cards, and take their station<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the full board, and sit alike delighted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With fashionable wines and conversation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And, as the isthmus of the grand connection,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Talk o'er themselves the past and next election.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry was a great electioneerer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Burrowing for boroughs like a rat or rabbit;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But county contests cost him rather dearer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because the neighbouring Scotch Earl of Giftgabbit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had English influence in the self-same sphere here;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His son, the Honourable Dick Dicedrabbit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was member for the 'other interest' (meaning<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The same self-interest, with a different leaning).<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Courteous and cautious therefore in his county,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was all things to all men, and dispensed<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To some civility, to others bounty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And promises to all--which last commenced<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To gather to a somewhat large amount, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not calculating how much they condensed;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what with keeping some, and breaking others,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His word had the same value as another's.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A friend to freedom and freeholders--yet<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No less a friend to government--he held,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That he exactly the just medium hit<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Twixt place and patriotism--albeit compell'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such was his sovereign's pleasure (though unfit,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He added modestly, when rebels rail'd),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To hold some sinecures he wish'd abolish'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But that with them all law would be demolish'd.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was 'free to confess' (whence comes this phrase?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is 't English? No--'t is only parliamentary)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That innovation's spirit now-a-days<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had made more progress than for the last century.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He would not tread a factious path to praise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though for the public weal disposed to venture high;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As for his place, he could but say this of it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That the fatigue was greater than the profit.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Heaven, and his friends, knew that a private life<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had ever been his sole and whole ambition;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But could he quit his king in times of strife,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which threaten'd the whole country with perdition?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When demagogues would with a butcher's knife<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cut through and through (oh! damnable incision!)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Gordian or the Geordi-an knot, whose strings<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Have tied together commons, lords, and kings.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sooner 'come lace into the civil list<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And champion him to the utmost'--he would keep it,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till duly disappointed or dismiss'd:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Profit he care not for, let others reap it;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But should the day come when place ceased to exist,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The country would have far more cause to weep it:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For how could it go on? Explain who can!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He gloried in the name of Englishman.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He was as independent--ay, much more--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than those who were not paid for independence,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As common soldiers, or a common--shore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have in their several arts or parts ascendance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; O'er the irregulars in lust or gore,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who do not give professional attendance.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus on the mob all statesmen are as eager<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To prove their pride, as footmen to a beggar.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All this (save the last stanza) Henry said,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And thought. I say no more--I 've said too much;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For all of us have either heard or read--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Off--or upon the hustings--some slight such<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hints from the independent heart or head<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the official candidate. I 'll touch<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No more on this--the dinner-bell hath rung,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And grace is said; the grace I should have sung--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I 'm too late, and therefore must make play.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was a great banquet, such as Albion old<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was wont to boast--as if a glutton's tray<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were something very glorious to behold.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But 't was a public feast and public day,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quite full, right dull, guests hot, and dishes cold,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Great plenty, much formality, small cheer,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And every body out of their own sphere.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The squires familiarly formal, and<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My lords and ladies proudly condescending;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very servants puzzling how to hand<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their plates--without it might be too much bending<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From their high places by the sideboard's stand--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet, like their masters, fearful of offending.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For any deviation from the graces<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Might cost both man and master too--their places.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were some hunters bold, and coursers keen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose hounds ne'er err'd, nor greyhounds deign'd to lurch;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some deadly shots too, Septembrizers, seen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Earliest to rise, and last to quit the search<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of the poor partridge through his stubble screen.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There were some massy members of the church,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Takers of tithes, and makers of good matches,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And several who sung fewer psalms than catches.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were some country wags too--and, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some exiles from the town, who had been driven<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To gaze, instead of pavement, upon grass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And rise at nine in lieu of long eleven.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And lo! upon that day it came to pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I sate next that o'erwhelming son of heaven,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The very powerful parson, Peter Pith,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The loudest wit I e'er was deafen'd with.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I knew him in his livelier London days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A brilliant diner out, though but a curate;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And not a joke he cut but earn'd its praise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Until preferment, coming at a sure rate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (O Providence! how wondrous are thy ways!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who would suppose thy gifts sometimes obdurate?),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gave him, to lay the devil who looks o'er Lincoln,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A fat fen vicarage, and nought to think on.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His jokes were sermons, and his sermons jokes;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But both were thrown away amongst the fens;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For wit hath no great friend in aguish folks.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No longer ready ears and short-hand pens<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Imbibed the gay bon-mot, or happy hoax:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The poor priest was reduced to common sense,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or to coarse efforts very loud and long,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To hammer a horse laugh from the thick throng.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a difference, says the song, 'between<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A beggar and a queen,' or was (of late<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The latter worse used of the two we 've seen--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But we 'll say nothing of affairs of state);<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A difference ''twixt a bishop and a dean,'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A difference between crockery ware and plate,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As between English beef and Spartan broth--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet great heroes have been bred by both.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But of all nature's discrepancies, none<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon the whole is greater than the difference<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Beheld between the country and the town,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of which the latter merits every preference<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; From those who have few resources of their own,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And only think, or act, or feel, with reference<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To some small plan of interest or ambition--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Both which are limited to no condition.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But 'en avant!' The light loves languish o'er<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Long banquets and too many guests, although<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A slight repast makes people love much more,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bacchus and Ceres being, as we know<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Even from our grammar upwards, friends of yore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With vivifying Venus, who doth owe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To these the invention of champagne and truffles:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Temperance delights her, but long fasting ruffles.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dully past o'er the dinner of the day;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan took his place, he knew not where,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Confused, in the confusion, and distrait,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And sitting as if nail'd upon his chair:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though knives and forks clank'd round as in a fray,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He seem'd unconscious of all passing there,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Till some one, with a groan, exprest a wish<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Unheeded twice) to have a fin of fish.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On which, at the third asking of the bans,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He started; and perceiving smiles around<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Broadening to grins, he colour'd more than once,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And hastily--as nothing can confound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A wise man more than laughter from a dunce--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inflicted on the dish a deadly wound,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And with such hurry, that ere he could curb it<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He had paid his neighbour's prayer with half a turbot.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This was no bad mistake, as it occurr'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The supplicator being an amateur;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But others, who were left with scarce a third,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Were angry--as they well might, to be sure.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They wonder'd how a young man so absurd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord Henry at his table should endure;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And this, and his not knowing how much oats<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Had fallen last market, cost his host three votes.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They little knew, or might have sympathised,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he the night before had seen a ghost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A prologue which but slightly harmonised<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With the substantial company engross'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By matter, and so much materialised,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That one scarce knew at what to marvel most<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of two things--how (the question rather odd is)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such bodies could have souls, or souls such bodies.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what confused him more than smile or stare<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From all the'squires and'squiresses around,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who wonder'd at the abstraction of his air,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially as he had been renown'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For some vivacity among the fair,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even in the country circle's narrow bound<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (For little things upon my lord's estate<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were good small talk for others still less great)--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was, that he caught Aurora's eye on his,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And something like a smile upon her cheek.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now this he really rather took amiss:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In those who rarely smile, their smiles bespeak<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A strong external motive; and in this<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Smile of Aurora's there was nought to pique<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or hope, or love, with any of the wiles<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which some pretend to trace in ladies' smiles.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T was a mere quiet smile of contemplation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indicative of some surprise and pity;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan grew carnation with vexation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which was not very wise, and still less witty,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since he had gain'd at least her observation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A most important outwork of the city--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As Juan should have known, had not his senses<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; By last night's ghost been driven from their defences.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But what was bad, she did not blush in turn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor seem embarrass'd--quite the contrary;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her aspect was as usual, still--not stern--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And she withdrew, but cast not down, her eye,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet grew a little pale--with what? concern?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know not; but her colour ne'er was high--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though sometimes faintly flush'd--and always clear,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As deep seas in a sunny atmosphere.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Adeline was occupied by fame<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This day; and watching, witching, condescending<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To the consumers of fish, fowl, and game,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And dignity with courtesy so blending,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As all must blend whose part it is to aim<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Especially as the sixth year is ending)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At their lord's, son's, or similar connection's<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Safe conduct through the rocks of re-elections.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though this was most expedient on the whole,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And usual--Juan, when he cast a glance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On Adeline while playing her grand role,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which she went through as though it were a dance,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Betraying only now and then her soul<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By a look scarce perceptibly askance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Of weariness or scorn), began to feel<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some doubt how much of Adeline was real;<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So well she acted all and every part<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By turns--with that vivacious versatility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which many people take for want of heart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They err--'t is merely what is call'd mobility,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A thing of temperament and not of art,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though seeming so, from its supposed facility;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And false--though true; for surely they 're sincerest<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who are strongly acted on by what is nearest.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This makes your actors, artists, and romancers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heroes sometimes, though seldom--sages never;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But speakers, bards, diplomatists, and dancers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Little that's great, but much of what is clever;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Most orators, but very few financiers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though all Exchequer chancellors endeavour,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of late years, to dispense with Cocker's rigours,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And grow quite figurative with their figures.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The poets of arithmetic are they<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who, though they prove not two and two to be<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Five, as they might do in a modest way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Have plainly made it out that four are three,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Judging by what they take, and what they pay.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Sinking Fund's unfathomable sea,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That most unliquidating liquid, leaves<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The debt unsunk, yet sinks all it receives.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; While Adeline dispensed her airs and graces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fair Fitz-Fulke seem'd very much at ease;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Though too well bred to quiz men to their faces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her laughing blue eyes with a glance could seize<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ridicules of people in all places--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That honey of your fashionable bees--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And store it up for mischievous enjoyment;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And this at present was her kind employment.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; However, the day closed, as days must close;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The evening also waned--and coffee came.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each carriage was announced, and ladies rose,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And curtsying off, as curtsies country dame,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Retired: with most unfashionable bows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their docile esquires also did the same,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Delighted with their dinner and their host,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But with the Lady Adeline the most.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some praised her beauty; others her great grace;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The warmth of her politeness, whose sincerity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was obvious in each feature of her face,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whose traits were radiant with the rays of verity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes; she was truly worthy her high place!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No one could envy her deserved prosperity.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then her dress--what beautiful simplicity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Draperied her form with curious felicity!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile Sweet Adeline deserved their praises,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By an impartial indemnification<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For all her past exertion and soft phrases,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In a most edifying conversation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which turn'd upon their late guests' miens and faces,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And families, even to the last relation;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Their hideous wives, their horrid selves and dresses,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And truculent distortion of their tresses.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; True, she said little--'t was the rest that broke<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forth into universal epigram;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But then 't was to the purpose what she spoke:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Addison's 'faint praise,' so wont to damn,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Her own but served to set off every joke,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As music chimes in with a melodrame.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How sweet the task to shield an absent friend!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I ask but this of mine, to--not defend.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were but two exceptions to this keen<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Skirmish of wits o'er the departed; one<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Aurora, with her pure and placid mien;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan, too, in general behind none<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In gay remark on what he had heard or seen,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sate silent now, his usual spirits gone:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In vain he heard the others rail or rally,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He would not join them in a single sally.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'T is true he saw Aurora look as though<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She approved his silence; she perhaps mistook<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Its motive for that charity we owe<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But seldom pay the absent, nor would look<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Farther--it might or might not be so.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan, sitting silent in his nook,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Observing little in his reverie,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet saw this much, which he was glad to see.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ghost at least had done him this much good,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In making him as silent as a ghost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If in the circumstances which ensued<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He gain'd esteem where it was worth the most.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And certainly Aurora had renew'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In him some feelings he had lately lost,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or harden'd; feelings which, perhaps ideal,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are so divine, that I must deem them real:--<br>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The love of higher things and better days;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The unbounded hope, and heavenly ignorance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of what is call'd the world, and the world's ways;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The moments when we gather from a glance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More joy than from all future pride or praise,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which kindle manhood, but can ne'er entrance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The heart in an existence of its own,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of which another's bosom is the zone.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Who would not sigh Ai ai Tan Kuuerheian<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That hath a memory, or that had a heart?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Alas! her star must fade like that of Dian:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ray fades on ray, as years on years depart.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Anacreon only had the soul to tie an<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unwithering myrtle round the unblunted dart<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of Eros: but though thou hast play'd us many tricks,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still we respect thee, 'Alma Venus Genetrix!'<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And full of sentiments, sublime as billows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heaving between this world and worlds beyond,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arrived, retired to his; but to despond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rather than rest. Instead of poppies, willows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Waved o'er his couch; he meditated, fond<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of those sweet bitter thoughts which banish sleep,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And make the worldling sneer, the youngling weep.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The night was as before: he was undrest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Saving his night-gown, which is an undress;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Completely'sans culotte,' and without vest;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In short, he hardly could be clothed with less:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But apprehensive of his spectral guest,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He sate with feelings awkward to express<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (By those who have not had such visitations),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Expectant of the ghost's fresh operations.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And not in vain he listen'd;--Hush! what's that?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I see--I see--Ah, no!--'t is not--yet 't is--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ye powers! it is the--the--the--Pooh! the cat!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The devil may take that stealthy pace of his!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So like a spiritual pit-a-pat,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or tiptoe of an amatory Miss,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gliding the first time to a rendezvous,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And dreading the chaste echoes of her shoe.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Again--what is 't? The wind? No, no--this time<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is the sable friar as before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With awful footsteps regular as rhyme,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or (as rhymes may be in these days) much more.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Again through shadows of the night sublime,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When deep sleep fell on men, and the world wore<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The starry darkness round her like a girdle<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Spangled with gems--the monk made his blood curdle.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A noise like to wet fingers drawn on glass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which sets the teeth on edge; and a slight clatter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like showers which on the midnight gusts will pass,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sounding like very supernatural water,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Came over Juan's ear, which throbb'd, alas!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For immaterialism's a serious matter;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that even those whose faith is the most great<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In souls immortal, shun them tete-a-tete.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were his eyes open?--Yes! and his mouth too.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Surprise has this effect--to make one dumb,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet leave the gate which eloquence slips through<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As wide as if a long speech were to come.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nigh and more nigh the awful echoes drew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tremendous to a mortal tympanum:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His eyes were open, and (as was before<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Stated) his mouth. What open'd next?--the door.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It open'd with a most infernal creak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like that of hell. 'Lasciate ogni speranza<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Voi che entrate!' The hinge seem'd to speak,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dreadful as Dante's rhima, or this stanza;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or--but all words upon such themes are weak:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A single shade's sufficient to entrance<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hero--for what is substance to a spirit?<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Or how is 't matter trembles to come near it?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The door flew wide,--not swiftly, but, as fly<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sea-gulls, with a steady, sober flight,--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then swung back; nor close--but stood awry,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Half letting in long shadows on the light,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which still in Juan's candlesticks burn'd high,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For he had two, both tolerably bright,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And in the door-way, darkening darkness, stood<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sable friar in his solemn hood.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Don Juan shook, as erst he had been shaken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The night before; but being sick of shaking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He first inclined to think he had been mistaken;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then to be ashamed of such mistaking;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; His own internal ghost began to awaken<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Within him, and to quell his corporal quaking--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hinting that soul and body on the whole<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Were odds against a disembodied soul.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then his dread grew wrath, and his wrath fierce,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he arose, advanced--the shade retreated;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Juan, eager now the truth to pierce,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Follow'd, his veins no longer cold, but heated,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Resolved to thrust the mystery carte and tierce,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At whatsoever risk of being defeated:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ghost stopp'd, menaced, then retired, until<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He reach'd the ancient wall, then stood stone still.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Juan put forth one arm--Eternal powers!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It touched no soul, nor body, but the wall,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On which the moonbeams fell in silvery showers,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chequer'd with all the tracery of the hall;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He shudder'd, as no doubt the bravest cowers<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When he can't tell what 't is that doth appal.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How odd, a single hobgoblin's non-entity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Should cause more fear than a whole host's identity.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But still the shade remain'd: the blue eyes glared,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And rather variably for stony death:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet one thing rather good the grave had spared,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ghost had a remarkably sweet breath.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A straggling curl show'd he had been fair-hair'd;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A red lip, with two rows of pearls beneath,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Gleam'd forth, as through the casement's ivy shroud<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The moon peep'd, just escaped from a grey cloud.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And Juan, puzzled, but still curious, thrust<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His other arm forth--Wonder upon wonder!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It press'd upon a hard but glowing bust,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which beat as if there was a warm heart under.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He found, as people on most trials must,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That he had made at first a silly blunder,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And that in his confusion he had caught<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Only the wall, instead of what he sought.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ghost, if ghost it were, seem'd a sweet soul<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As ever lurk'd beneath a holy hood:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A dimpled chin, a neck of ivory, stole<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forth into something much like flesh and blood;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Back fell the sable frock and dreary cowl,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And they reveal'd--alas! that e'er they should!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In full, voluptuous, but not o'ergrown bulk,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The phantom of her frolic Grace--Fitz-Fulke!<BR>
<hr align="left" width="40%"><p><b><A NAME="axvii">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;            CANTO THE SEVENTEENTH.</a></b><P>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; THE world is full of orphans: firstly, those<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who are so in the strict sense of the phrase;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But many a lonely tree the loftier grows<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Than others crowded in the Forest's maze.--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The next are such as are not doomed to lose<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Their tender parents in their budding days,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But, merely, their parental tenderness,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which leaves them orphans of the heart no less.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The next are 'only Children,' as they are styled,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who grow up Children only, since th' old saw<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pronounces that an 'only's' a spoilt child--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But not to go too far, I hold it law,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That where their education, harsh or mild,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Transgresses the great bounds of love or awe,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The sufferers--be 't in heart or intellect--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whate'er the cause, are orphans in effect.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But to return unto the stricter rule--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As far as words make rules--our common notion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of orphan paints at once a parish school,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A half-starved babe, a wreck upon Life's ocean,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A human (what the Italians nickname) 'Mule'!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A theme for Pity or some worse emotion;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet, if examined, it might be admitted<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wealthiest orphans are to be more pitied.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Too soon they are Parents to themselves: for what<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are Tutors, Guardians, and so forth, compared<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With Nature's genial Genitors? so that<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A child of Chancery, that Star-Chamber ward<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (I 'll take the likeness I can first come at),<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is like--a duckling by Dame Partlett rear'd,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And frights--especially if 't is a daughter,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Th' old Hen--by running headlong to the water.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a common-place book argument,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which glibly glides from every tongue;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When any dare a new light to present,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'If you are right, then everybody's wrong'!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Suppose the converse of this precedent<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So often urged, so loudly and so long;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'If you are wrong, then everybody's right'!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Was ever everybody yet so quite?<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore I would solicit free discussion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Upon all points--no matter what, or whose--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Because as Ages upon Ages push on,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The last is apt the former to accuse<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of pillowing its head on a pin-cushion,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Heedless of pricks because it was obtuse:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What was a paradox becomes a truth or<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A something like it--witness Luther!<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Sacraments have been reduced to two,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And Witches unto none, though somewhat late<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since burning aged women (save a few--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mischief in families, as some know or knew,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Should still be singed, but lightly, let me state)<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Has been declared an act of inurbanity<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Malgre Sir Matthew Hales's great humanity.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Great Galileo was debarr'd the Sun,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because he fix'd it; and, to stop his talking,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How Earth could round the solar orbit run,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Found his own legs embargo'd from mere walking:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The man was well-nigh dead, ere men begun<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To think his skull had not some need of caulking;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But now, it seems, he's right--his notion just:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; No doubt a consolation to his dust<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Pythagoras, Locke, Socrates--but pages<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Might be fill'd up, as vainly as before,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; With the sad usage of all sorts of sages,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Who, in his life-time, each, was deem'd a Bore!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The loftiest minds outrun their tardy ages:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This they must bear with and, perhaps, much more;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wise man's sure when he no more can share it, he<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Will have a firm Post Obit on posterity.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If such doom waits each Intellectual Giant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We little people in our lesser way,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Life's small rubs should surely be more pliant,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And so for one will I--as well I may--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Would that I were less bilious--but, oh, fie on 't!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as I make my mind up every day,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; To be a 'totus, teres,' Stoic, Sage,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The wind shifts and I fly into a rage.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Temperate I am--yet never had a temper;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Modest I am--yet with some slight assurance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Changeable too--yet somehow 'Idem semper;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Patient--but not enamour'd of endurance;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Cheerful--but, sometimes, rather apt to whimper;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mild--but at times a sort of 'Hercules furens;'<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So that I almost think that the same skin<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For one without--has two or three within.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our Hero was, in Canto the Sixteenth,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Left in a tender moonlight situation,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Such as enables Man to show his strength<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moral or physical: on this occasion<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether his virtue triumph'd--or, at length,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His vice--for he was of a kindling nation--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Is more than I shall venture to describe;--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Unless some Beauty with a kiss should bribe.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I leave the thing a problem, like all things:--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The morning came--and breakfast, tea and toast,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of which most men partake, but no one sings.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The company whose birth, wealth, worth, has cost<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My trembling Lyre already several strings,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Assembled with our hostess, and mine host;<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The guests dropp'd in--the last but one, Her Grace,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The latest, Juan, with his virgin face.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Which best it is to encounter--Ghost, or none,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'T were difficult to say; but Juan look'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As if he had combated with more than one,<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being wan and worn, with eyes that hardly brook'd<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The light that through the Gothic window shone:<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Her Grace, too, had a sort of air rebuked--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Seem'd pale and shiver'd, as if she had kept<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A vigil, or dreamt rather more than slept.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                    THE END<BR>
<BR>
