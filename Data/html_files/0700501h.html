<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01">I.&mdash;THE RED HUNDRED</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT is not for you or me to judge Manfred and his
works. I say 'Manfred', though I might as well have said
'Gonsalez', or for the matter of that 'Poiccart', since they are
equally guilty or great according to the light in which you view
their acts. The most lawless of us would hesitate to defend them,
but the greater humanitarian could scarcely condemn them.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of us, who live within the law, going
about our business in conformity with the code, and
unquestioningly keeping to the left or to the right as the police
direct, their methods were terrible, indefensible, revolting.</p>

<p>It does not greatly affect the issue that, for want of a
better word, we call them criminals. Such would be mankind's
unanimous designation, but I think&mdash;indeed, I
know&mdash;that they were indifferent to the opinions of the
human race. I doubt very much whether they expected posterity to
honour them.</p>

<p>Their action towards the cabinet minister was murder, pure and
simple. Yet, in view of the large humanitarian problems involved,
who would describe it as pernicious?</p>

<p>Frankly I say of the three men who killed Sir Philip Ramon,
and who slew ruthlessly in the name of Justice, that my
sympathies are with them. There are crimes for which there is no
adequate punishment, and offences that the machinery of the
written law cannot efface. Therein lies the justification for the
Four Just Men,&mdash;the Council of Justice as they presently
came to call themselves a council of great intellects,
passionless.</p>

<p>And not long after the death of Sir Philip and while England
still rang with that exploit, they performed an act or a series
of acts that won not alone from the Government of Great Britain,
but from the Governments of Europe, a sort of unofficial approval
and Falmouth had his wish. For here they waged war against great
world-criminals&mdash;they pitted their strength, their cunning,
and their wonderful intellects against the most powerful
organization of the underworld&mdash;against past masters of
villainous arts, and brains equally agile.</p>

<p>It was the day of days for the Red Hundred. The wonderful
international congress was meeting in London, the first great
congress of recognized Anarchism. This was no hole-and-corner
gathering of hurried men speaking furtively, but one open and
unafraid with three policemen specially retained for duty outside
the hall, a commissionaire to take tickets at the outer lobby,
and a shorthand writer with a knowledge of French and Yiddish to
make notes of remarkable utterances.</p>

<p>The wonderful congress was a fact. When it had been broached
there were people who laughed at the idea; Nilov of Vitebsk was
one because he did not think such openness possible. But little
Peter (his preposterous name was Konoplanikov, and he was a
reporter on the staff of the foolish Russkoye Znamya, this
little Peter who had thought out the whole thing, whose idea it
was to gather a conference of the Red Hundred in London, who
hired the hall and issued the bills (bearing in the top left-hand
corner the inverted triangle of the Hundred) asking those
Russians in London interested in the building of a Russian
Sailors' Home to apply for tickets, who, too, secured a hall
where interruption was impossible, was happy&mdash;yea, little
brothers, it was a great day for Peter.</p>

<p>'You can always deceive the police,' said little Peter
enthusiastically; 'call a meeting with a philanthropic object
and&mdash;voila!'</p>

<p>Wrote Inspector Falmouth to the assistant commissioner of
police:&mdash;</p>

<p>Your respected communication to hand. The meeting to be held
tonight at the Phoenix Hall, Middlesex Street, E., with the
object of raising funds for a Russian Sailors' Home is, of
course, the first international congress of the Red Hundred.
Shall not be able to get a man inside, but do not think that
matters much, as meeting will be engaged throwing flowers at one
another and serious business will not commence till the meeting
of the inner committee. I inclose a list of men already arrived
in London, and have the honour to request that you will send me
portraits of under-mentioned men.</p>

<p>There were three delegates from Baden-Baden, Herr Schmidt from
Freiburg, Herr Bleaumeau from Karlsruhe, and Herr Von Dunop from
Mannheim. They were not considerable persons, even in the eyes of
the world of Anarchism; they called for no particular notice, and
therefore the strange thing that happened to them on the night of
the congress is all the more remarkable.</p>

<p>Herr Schmidt had left his pension in Bloomsbury and was
hurrying eastward. It was a late autumn evening and a chilly rain
fell, and Herr Schmidt was debating in his mind whether he should
go direct to the rendezvous where he had promised to meet his two
compatriots, or whether he should call a taxi and drive direct to
the hall, when a hand grasped his arm.</p>

<p>He turned quickly and reached for his hip pocket. Two men
stood behind him and but for themselves the square through which
he was passing was deserted.</p>

<p>Before he could grasp the Browning pistol, his other arm was
seized and the taller of the two men spoke.</p>

<p>'You are Augustus Schmidt?' he asked.</p>

<p>'That is my name.'</p>

<p>'You are an anarchist?'</p>

<p>'That is my affair.'</p>

<p>'You are at present on your way to a meeting of the Red
Hundred?'</p>

<p>Herr Schmidt opened his eyes in genuine astonishment.</p>

<p>'How did you know that?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I am Detective Simpson from Scotland Yard, and I shall take
you into custody,' was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>'On what charge?' demanded the German.</p>

<p>'As to that I shall tell you later.'</p>

<p>The man from Baden-Baden shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'I have yet to learn that it is an offence in England to hold
opinions.'</p>

<p>A closed motor-car entered the square, and the shorter of the
two whistled and the chauffeur drew up near the group.</p>

<p>The anarchist turned to the man who had arrested him.</p>

<p>'I warn you that you shall answer for this,' he said
wrathfully. 'I have an important engagement that you have made me
miss through your foolery and &mdash;'</p>

<p>'Get in!' interrupted the tall man tersely.</p>

<p>Schmidt stepped into the car and the door snapped behind
him.</p>

<p>He was alone and in darkness. The car moved on and then
Schmidt discovered that there were no windows to the vehicle. A
wild idea came to him that he might escape. He tried the door of
the car; it was immovable. He cautiously tapped it. It was lined
with thin sheets of steel.</p>

<p>'A prison on wheels,' he muttered with a curse, and sank back
into the corner of the car.</p>

<p>He did not know London; he had not the slightest idea where he
was going. For ten minutes the car moved along. He was puzzled.
These policemen had taken nothing from him, he still retained his
pistol. They had not even attempted to search him for
compromising documents. Not that he had any except the pass for
the conference and&mdash;the Inner Code!</p>

<p>Heavens! He must destroy that. He thrust his hand into the
inner pocket of his coat. It was empty. The thin leather case was
gone! His face went grey, for the Red Hundred is no fanciful
secret society but a bloody-minded organization with less mercy
for bungling brethren than for its sworn enemies. In the thick
darkness of the car his nervous fingers groped through all his
pockets. There was no doubt at all&mdash;the papers had gone.</p>

<p>In the midst of his search the car stopped. He slipped the
flat pistol from his pocket. His position was desperate and he
was not the kind of man to shirk a risk.</p>

<p>Once there was a brother of the Red Hundred who sold a
password to the Secret Police. And the brother escaped from
Russia. There was a woman in it, and the story is a mean little
story that is hardly worth the telling. Only, the man and the
woman escaped, and went to Baden-Baden, and Schmidt recognized them
from the portraits he had received from headquarters, and one
night... You understand that there was nothing clever or neat
about it. English newspapers would have described it as a
'revolting murder', because the details of the crime were rather
shocking. The thing that stood to Schmidt's credit in the books
of the Society was that the murderer was undiscovered.</p>

<p>The memory of this episode came back to the anarchist as the
car stopped &mdash;perhaps this was the thing the police had
discovered? Out of the dark corners of his mind came the scene
again, and the voice of the man... 'Don't! Don't! O Christ!
Don't!' and Schmidt sweated...</p>

<p>The door of the car opened and he slipped back the cover of
his pistol.</p>

<p>'Don't shoot,' said a quiet voice in the gloom outside, 'here
are some friends of yours.'</p>

<p>He lowered his pistol, for his quick ears detected a wheezing
cough.</p>

<p>'Von Dunop!' he cried in astonishment.</p>

<p>'And Herr Bleaumeau,' said the same voice. 'Get in, you
two.'</p>

<p>Two men stumbled into the car, one dumbfounded and
silent&mdash;save for the wheezing cough&mdash;the other
blasphemous and voluble.</p>

<p>'Wait, my friend!' raved the bulk of Bleaumeau. 'Wait! I will
make you sorry</p>

<p>The door shut and the car moved on.</p>

<p>The two men outside watched the vehicle with its unhappy
passengers disappear round a corner and then walked slowly
away.</p>

<p>'Extraordinary men,' said the taller.</p>

<p>'Most,' replied the other, and then, 'Von Dunop&mdash;isn't
he&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'The man who threw the bomb at the Swiss
President&mdash;yes.'</p>

<p>The shorter man smiled in the darkness.</p>

<p>'Given a conscience, he is enduring his hour,' he said.</p>

<p>The pair walked on in silence and turned into Oxford Street as
the clock of a church struck eight.</p>

<p>The tall man lifted his walking-stick and a sauntering taxi
pulled up at the curb.</p>

<p>'Aldgate,' he said, and the two men took their seats.</p>

<p>Not until the taxi was spinning along Newgate Street did
either of the men speak, and then the shorter asked:</p>

<p>'You are thinking about the woman?'</p>

<p>The other nodded and his companion relapsed into silence; then
he spoke again:</p>

<p>'She is a problem and a difficulty, in a way&mdash;yet she is
the most dangerous of the lot. And the curious thing about it is
that if she were not beautiful and young she would not be a
problem at all. We're very human, George. God made us illogical
that the minor businesses of life should not interfere with the
great scheme. And the great scheme is that animal men should
select animal women for the mothers of their children.'</p>

<p>'Venenum in auro bibitur,' the other quoted, which shows that
he was an extraordinary detective, 'and so far as I am concerned
it matters little to me whether an irresponsible homicide is a
beautiful woman or a misshapen negro.'</p>

<p>They dismissed the taxi at Aldgate Station and turned into
Middlesex Street.</p>

<p>The meeting-place of the great congress was a hall which was
originally erected by an enthusiastic Christian gentleman with a
weakness for the conversion of Jews to the New Presbyterian
Church. With this laudable object it had been opened with great
pomp and the singing of anthems and the enthusiastic proselytizer
had spoken on that occasion two hours and forty minutes by the
clock.</p>

<p>After twelve months' labour the Christian gentleman discovered
that the advantages of Christianity only appeal to very rich Jews
indeed, to the Cohens who become Cowans, to the Isaacs who become
Grahames, and to the curious low-down Jews who stand in the same
relation to their brethren as White Kaffirs to a European
community.</p>

<p>So the hall passed from hand to hand, and, failing to obtain a
music and dancing licence, went back to the mission-hall
stage.</p>

<p>Successive generations of small boys had destroyed its windows
and beplastered its walls. Successive fly-posters had touched its
blank face with colour. Tonight there was nothing to suggest that
there was any business of extraordinary importance being
transacted within its walls. A Russian or a Yiddish or any kind
of reunion does not greatly excite Middlesex Street, and had
little Peter boldly announced that the congress of the Red
Hundred were to meet in full session there would have been no
local excitement and&mdash;if the truth be told&mdash;he might
still have secured the services of his three policemen and
commissionaire.</p>

<p>To this worthy, a neat, cleanly gentleman in uniform, wearing
on his breast the medals for the relief of Chitral and the Soudan
Campaigns, the two men delivered the perforated halves of their
tickets and passed through the outer lobby into a small room. By
a door at the other end stood a thin man with a straggling beard.
His eyes were red-rimmed and weak, he wore long narrow buttoned
boots, and he had a trick of pecking his head forwards and
sideways like an inquisitive hen.</p>

<p>'You have the word, brothers?' he asked, speaking German like
one unaccustomed to the language.</p>

<p>The taller of the two strangers shot a swift glance at the
sentinel that absorbed the questioner from his cracked patent
leather boots to his flamboyant watch-chain. Then he answered in
Italian:</p>

<p>'Nothing!'</p>

<p>The face of the guardian flushed with pleasure at the familiar
tongue.</p>

<p>'Pass, brother; it is very good to hear that language.'</p>

<p>The air of the crowded hall struck the two men in the face
like the blast from a destructor. It was unclean;
unhealthy&mdash;the scent of an early-morning doss-house.</p>

<p>The hall was packed, the windows were closed and curtained,
and as a precautionary measure, little Peter had placed thick
blankets before the ventilators.</p>

<p>At one end of the hall was a platform on which stood a
semicircle of chairs and in the centre was a table draped with
red. On the wall behind the chairs&mdash;every one of which was
occupied&mdash;was a huge red flag bearing in the centre a great
white 'C'. It had been tacked to the wall, but one corner had
broken away revealing a part of the painted scroll of the mission
workers:</p>

<p>'... are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.'</p>

<p>The two intruders pushed their way through a group that were
gathered at the door. Three aisles ran the length of the
building, and they made their way along the central gangway and
found seats near the platform.</p>

<p>A brother was speaking. He was a good and zealous worker but a
bad orator. He spoke in German and enunciated commonplaces with
hoarse emphasis. He said all the things that other men had said
and forgotten. 'This is the time to strike' was his most notable
sentence, and notable only because it evoked a faint buzz of
applause.</p>

<p>The audience stirred impatiently. The good Bentvitch had
spoken beyond his allotted time; and there were other people to
speak&mdash;and prosy at that. And it would be ten o'clock before
the Woman of Gratz would rise.</p>

<p>The babble was greatest in the corner of the hall, where
little Peter, all eyes and startled eyebrows, was talking to an
audience of his own.</p>

<p>'It is impossible, it is absurd, it is most foolish!' his thin
voice rose almost to a scream. 'I should laugh at it&mdash;we
should all laugh, but the Woman of Gratz has taken the matter
seriously, and she is afraid!'</p>

<p>'Afraid!'</p>

<p>'Nonsense!'</p>

<p>'Oh, Peter, the fool!'</p>

<p>There were other things said because everybody in the vicinity
expressed an opinion. Peter was distressed, but not by the
epithets. He was crushed, humiliated, beaten by his tremendous
tidings. He was nearly crying at the horrible thought. The Woman
of Gratz was afraid! The Woman of Gratz who... It was
unthinkable.</p>

<p>He turned his eyes toward the platform, but she was not
there.</p>

<p>'Tell us about it, Peter,' pleaded a dozen voices; but the
little man with the tears twinkling on his fair eyelashes waved
them off.</p>

<p>So far from his incoherent outburst they had learnt only
this&mdash;that the Woman of Gratz was afraid.</p>

<p>And that was bad enough.</p>

<p>For this woman&mdash;she was a girl really, a slip of a child
who should have been finishing her education somewhere in
Germany&mdash;this same woman had once risen and electrified the
world.</p>

<p>There had been a meeting in a small Hungarian town to discuss
ways and means. And when the men had finished their denunciation
of Austria, she rose and talked. A short-skirted little girl with
two long flaxen braids of hair, thin-legged, flat-chested,
angular, hipless&mdash;that is what the men of Gratz noticed as
they smiled behind their hands and wondered why her father had
brought her to the meeting.</p>

<p>But her speech... two hours she spoke and no man stirred. A
little flat-chested girl full of sonorous phrases&mdash;mostly
she had collected them from the talk in Old Joseph's kitchen. But
with some power of her own, she had spun them together, these
inconsiderable truisms, and had endowed them with a wondrous
vitality.</p>

<p>They were old, old platitudes, if the truth be told, but at
some time in the history of revolution, some long dead genius had
coined them, and newly fashioned in the furnace of his soul they
had shaped men's minds and directed their great and dreadful
deeds.</p>

<p>So the Woman of Gratz arrived, and they talked about her and
circulated her speeches in every language. And she grew. The
hollow face of this lank girl filled, and the flat bosom rounded
and there came softer lines and curves to her angular figure,
and, almost before they realized the fact, she was beautiful.</p>

<p>So her fame had grown until her father died and she went to
Russia. Then came a series of outrages which may be categorically
and briefly set forth:&mdash;</p>

<p>1: General Malov shot dead by an unknown woman in his private
room at the Police Bureau, Moscow.</p>

<p>2: Prince Hazallarkov shot dead by an unknown woman in the
streets of Petrograd.</p>

<p>3: Colonel Kaverdavskov killed by a bomb thrown by a woman who
made her escape.</p>

<p>And the Woman of Gratz leapt to a greater fame. She had been
arrested half a dozen times, and whipped twice, but they could
prove nothing against her and elicit nothing from her&mdash;and
she was very beautiful.</p>

<p>Now to the thundering applause of the waiting delegates, she
stepped upon the platform and took the last speaker's place by
the side of the red-covered table.</p>

<p>She raised her hand and absolute and complete silence fell on
the hall, so much so that her first words sounded strident and
shrill, for she had attuned her voice to the din. She recovered
her pitch and dropped her voice to a conversational tone.</p>

<p>She stood easily with her hands clasped behind her and made no
gesture. The emotion that was within her she conveyed through her
wonderful voice. Indeed, the power of the speech lay rather in
its delivery than in its substance, for only now and then did she
depart from the unwritten text of Anarchism: the right of the
oppressed to overthrow the oppressor; the divinity of violence;
the sacredness of sacrifice and martyrdom in the cause of
enlightenment. One phrase alone stood apart from the commonplace
of her oratory. She was speaking of the Theorists who counsel
reform and condemn violence, 'These Christs who deputize their
Calvaries,' she called them with fine scorn, and the hall roared
its approval of the imagery.</p>

<p>It was the fury of the applause that disconcerted her; the
taller of the two men who sat watching her realized that much.
For when the shouting had died down and she strove to resume, she
faltered and stammered and then was silent. Then abruptly and
with surprising vehemence she began again. But she had changed
the direction of her oratory, and it was upon another subject
that she now spoke. A subject nearer to her at that moment than
any other, for her pale cheeks flushed and a feverish light came
to her eyes as she spoke.</p>

<p>'... and now, with all our perfect organization, with the
world almost within our grasp&mdash;there comes somebody who says
"Stop!"&mdash;and we who by our acts have terrorized kings and
dominated the councils of empires, are ourselves threatened!'</p>

<p>The audience grew deadly silent. They were silent before, but
now the silence was painful.</p>

<p>The two men who watched her stirred a little uneasily, as
though something in her speech had jarred. Indeed, the suggestion
of braggadocio in her assertion of the Red Hundred's power had
struck a discordant note.</p>

<p>The girl continued speaking rapidly.</p>

<p>'We have heard&mdash;you have heard&mdash;we know of these men
who have written to us. They say'&mdash;her voice
rose&mdash;'that we shall not do what we do. They threaten
us&mdash;they threaten me&mdash;that we must change our methods,
or they will punish as&mdash;as we&mdash;punish; kill as we
kill&mdash;'</p>

<p>There was a murmuring in the audience and men looked at one
another in amazement. For terror unmistakable and undisguised was
written on her pale face and shone from those wondrous eyes of
hers.</p>

<p>'But we will defy&mdash;'</p>

<p>Loud voices and the sound of scuffling in the little anteroom
interrupted her, and a warning word shouted brought the audience
to its feet.</p>

<p>'The police!'</p>

<p>A hundred stealthy hands reached for cunning pockets, but
somebody leapt upon a bench, near the entrance, and held up an
authoritative hand.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen, there is no occasion for alarm&mdash;I am
Detective-Superintendent Falmouth from Scotland Yard, and I have
no quarrel with the Red Hundred.'</p>

<p>Little Peter, transfixed for the moment, pushed his way
towards the detective.</p>

<p>'Who do you want&mdash;what do you want?' he asked.</p>

<p>The detective stood with his back to the door and
answered.</p>

<p>'I want two men who were seen to enter this hall: two members
of an organization that is outside the Red Hundred.
They&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ha!' The woman who still stood upon the platform leant
forward with blazing eyes.</p>

<p>'I know&mdash;I know!' she cried breathlessly; 'the men who
threatened us&mdash;who threatened me&mdash;The Four Just
Men!'</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02">II.&mdash;THE FOURTH MAN</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE tall man's hand was in his pocket when the
detective spoke.</p>

<p>When he had entered the hall he had thrown a swift glance
round the place and taken in every detail. He had seen the beaded
strip of unpainted wood which guarded the electric light cables,
and had improved the opportunity whilst the prosy brother was
speaking to make a further reconnaissance. There was a white
porcelain switchboard with half a dozen switches at the left-hand
side of the platform. He judged the distance and threw up the
hand that held the pistol.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang!</p>

<p>A crash of broken glass, a quick flash of blue flame from the
shattered fuses&mdash;and the hall was in darkness. It happened
before the detective could spring from his form into the yelling,
screaming crowd&mdash;before the police officer could get a
glance at the man who fired the shots.</p>

<p>In an instant the place was a pandemonium.</p>

<p>'Silence!' Falmouth roared above the din; 'silence! Keep
quiet, you miserable cowards&mdash;show a light here, Brown,
Curtis&mdash;Inspector, where are your men's lanterns!'</p>

<p>The rays of a dozen bull's-eye lamps waved over the struggling
throng.</p>

<p>'Open your lanterns'&mdash;and to the seething mob, 'Silence!'
Then a bright young officer remembered that he had seen
gas-brackets in the room, and struggled through the howling mob
till he came to the wall and found the gas-fitting with his
lantern. He struck a match and lit the gas, and the panic
subsided as suddenly as it had begun.</p>

<p>Falmouth, choked with rage, threw his eye round the hall.
'Guard the door,' he said briefly; 'the hall is surrounded and
they cannot possibly escape.' He strode swiftly along the central
aisle, followed by two of his men, and with an agile leap, sprang
on to the platform and faced the audience. The Woman of Gratz,
with a white set face, stood motionless, one hand resting on the
little table, the other at her throat. Falmouth raised his hand
to enjoin silence and the law-breakers obeyed.</p>

<p>'I have no quarrel with the Red Hundred,' he said. 'By the law
of this country it is permissible to hold opinions and propagate
doctrines, however objectionable they be&mdash;I am here to
arrest two men who have broken the laws of this country. Two
persons who are part of the organization known as the Four Just
Men.'</p>

<p>All the time he was speaking his eyes searched the faces
before him. He knew that one-half of the audience could not
understand him and that the hum of talk that arose as he finished
was his speech in course of translation.</p>

<p>The faces he sought he could not discern. To be exact, he
hoped that his scrutiny would induce two men, of whose identity
he was ignorant, to betray themselves.</p>

<p>There are little events, unimportant in themselves, which
occasionally lead to tremendous issues. A skidding motor-bus that
crashed into a private car in Piccadilly had led to the discovery
that there were three vociferous foreign gentlemen imprisoned in
the overturned vehicle. It led to the further discovery that the
chauffeur had disappeared in the confusion of the collision. In
the darkness, comparing notes, the three prisoners had arrived at
a conclusion&mdash;to wit, that their abduction was a sequel to a
mysterious letter each had received, which bore the signature
'The Four Just Men'.</p>

<p>So in the panic occasioned by the accident, they were
sufficiently indiscreet to curse the Four Just Men by name, and,
the Four Just Men being a sore topic with the police, they were
questioned further, and the end of it was that Superintendent
Falmouth motored eastward in great haste and was met in Middlesex
Street by a reserve of police specially summoned.</p>

<p>He was at the same disadvantage he had always been&mdash;the
Four Just Men were to him names only, symbols of a swift
remorseless force that struck surely and to the minute&mdash;and
nothing more.</p>

<p>Two or three of the leaders of the Red Hundred had singled
themselves out and drew closer to the platform.</p>

<p>'We are not aware,' said Francois, the Frenchman, speaking for
his companions in faultless English, 'we are not aware of the
identity of the men you seek, but on the understanding that they
are not brethren of our Society, and moreover'&mdash;he was at a
loss for words to put the fantastic situation&mdash;'and moreover
since they have threatened us&mdash;threatened us,' he repeated
in bewilderment, 'we will afford you every assistance.'</p>

<p>The detective jumped at the opportunity.</p>

<p>'Good!' he said and formed a rapid plan.</p>

<p>The two men could not have escaped from the hall. There was a
little door near the platform, he had seen that&mdash;as the two
men he sought had seen it. Escape seemed possible through there;
they had thought so, too. But Falmouth knew that the outer door
leading from the little vestibule was guarded by two policemen.
This was the sum of the discovery made also by the two men he
sought. He spoke rapidly to Francois.</p>

<p>'I want every person in the hall to be vouched for,' he said
quickly. 'Somebody must identify every man, and the identifier
must himself be identified.'</p>

<p>The arrangements were made with lightning-like rapidity. From
the platform in French, German and Yiddish, the leaders of the
Red Hundred explained the plan. Then the police formed a line,
and one by one the people came forward, and shyly, suspiciously
or self-consciously, according to their several natures, they
passed the police line.</p>

<p>'That is Simon Czech of Buda-Pest.'</p>

<p>'Who identifies him?'</p>

<p>'I,'&mdash;a dozen voices.</p>

<p>'Pass.'</p>

<p>'This is Michael Ranekov of Odessa.'</p>

<p>'Who identifies him?'</p>

<p>'I,' said a burly man, speaking in German.</p>

<p>'And you?'</p>

<p>There was a little titter, for Michael is the best-known man
in the Order. Some there were who, having passed the line, waited
to identify their kinsfolk and fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>'It seems much simpler than I could have imagined.'</p>

<p>It was the tall man with the trim beard, who spoke in a
guttural tone which was neither German nor Yiddish. He was
watching with amused interest the examination.</p>

<p>'Separating the lambs from the goats with a vengeance,' he
said with a faint smile, and his taciturn companion nodded. Then
he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>'Do you think any of these people will recognize you as the
man who fired?'</p>

<p>The tall man shook his head decisively.</p>

<p>'Their eyes were on the police&mdash;and besides I am too
quick a shot. Nobody saw me unless&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The Woman of Gratz?' asked the other, without showing the
slightest concern.</p>

<p>'The Woman of Gratz,' said George Manfred.</p>

<p>They formed part of a struggling line that moved slowly toward
the police barrier.</p>

<p>'I fear,' said Manfred, 'that we shall be forced to make our
escape in a perfectly obvious way&mdash;the bull-at-the-gate
method is one that I object to on principle, and it is one that I
have never been obliged to employ.'</p>

<p>They were speaking all the time in the language of the harsh
gutturals, and those who were in their vicinity looked at them in
some perplexity, for it is a tongue unlike any that is heard in
the Revolutionary Belt.</p>

<p>Closer and closer they grew to the inflexible inquisitor at
the end of the police line. Ahead of them was a young man who
turned from time to time as if seeking a friend behind. His was a
face that fascinated the shorter of the two men, ever a student
of faces. It was a face of deadly pallor, that the dark
close-cropped hair and the thick black eyebrows accentuated.
Aesthetic in outline, refined in contour, it was the face of a
visionary, and in the restless, troubled eyes there lay a hint of
the fanatic. He reached the barrier and a dozen eager men stepped
forward for the honour of sponsorship. Then he passed and Manfred
stepped calmly forward.</p>

<p>'Heinrich Rossenburg of Raz,' he mentioned the name of an
obscure Transylvanian village.</p>

<p>'Who identifies this man?' asked Falmouth monotonously.
Manfred held his breath and stood ready to spring.</p>

<p>'I do.'</p>

<p>It was the spiritue who had gone before him; the dreamer with
the face of a priest.</p>

<p>'Pass.'</p>

<p>Manfred, calm and smiling, sauntered through the police with a
familiar nod to his saviour. Then he heard the challenge that met
his companion.</p>

<p>'Rolf Woolfund,' he heard Poiccart's clear, untroubled
voice.</p>

<p>'Who identifies this man?'</p>

<p>Again he waited tensely.</p>

<p>'I do,' said the young man's voice again.</p>

<p>Then Poiccart joined him, and they waited a little.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye Manfred saw the man who had
vouched for him saunter toward them. He came abreast, then:</p>

<p>'If you would care to meet me at Reggiori's at King's Cross I
shall be there in an hour,' he said, and Manfred noticed without
emotion that this young man also spoke in Arabic.</p>

<p>They passed through the crowd that had gathered about the
hall&mdash;for the news of the police raid had spread like
wildfire through the East End &mdash;and gained Aldgate Station
before they spoke.</p>

<p>'This is a curious beginning to our enterprise,' said Manfred.
He seemed neither pleased nor sorry. 'I have always thought that
Arabic was the safest language in the world in which to talk
secrets&mdash;one learns wisdom with the years,' he added
philosophically.</p>

<p>Poiccart examined his well-manicured finger-nails as though
the problem centred there. 'There is no precedent,' he said,
speaking to himself.</p>

<p>'And he may be an embarrassment,' added George; then, 'let us
wait and see what the hour brings.'</p>

<p>The hour brought the man who had befriended them so strangely.
It brought also a little in advance of him a fourth man who
limped slightly but greeted the two with a rueful smile. 'Hurt?'
asked Manfred.</p>

<p>'Nothing worth speaking about,' said the other carelessly,
'and now what is the meaning of your mysterious telephone
message?'</p>

<p>Briefly Manfred sketched the events of the night, and the
other listened gravely.</p>

<p>'It's a curious situation,' he began, when a warning glance
from Poiccart arrested him. The subject of their conversation had
arrived.</p>

<p>He sat down at the table, and dismissed the fluttering waiter
that hung about him.</p>

<p>The four sat in silence for a while and the newcomer was the
first to speak.</p>

<p>'I call myself Bernard Courtlander,' he said simply, 'and you
are the organization known as the Four Just Men.'</p>

<p>They did not reply.</p>

<p>'I saw you shoot,' he went on evenly, 'because I had been
watching you from the moment when you entered the hall, and when
the police adopted the method of identification, I resolved to
risk my life and speak for you.'</p>

<p>'Meaning,' interposed Poiccart calmly, 'you resolved to
risk&mdash;our killing you?'</p>

<p>'Exactly,' said the young man, nodding, 'a purely outside view
would be that such a course would be a fiendish act of
ingratitude, but I have a closer perception of principles, and I
recognize that such a sequel to my interference is perfectly
logical.' He singled out Manfred leaning back on the red plush
cushions. 'You have so often shown that human life is the least
considerable factor in your plan, and have given such evidence of
your singleness of purpose, that I am fully satisfied that if my
life&mdash;or the life of any one of you&mdash;stood before the
fulfilment of your objects, that life would go&mdash;so!' He
snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>'Well?' said Manfred.</p>

<p>'I know of your exploits,' the strange young man went on, 'as
who does not?'</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a leather case, and from that he
extracted a newspaper cutting. Neither of the three men evinced
the slightest interest in the paper he unfolded on the white
cloth. Their eyes were on his face.</p>

<p>'Here is a list of people slain&mdash;for justice' sake,'
Courtlander said, smoothing the creases from a cutting from the
<i>Megaphone</i>, 'men whom the law of the land passed by,
sweaters and debauchers, robbers of public funds, corrupters of
youth&mdash;men who bought 'justice' as you and I buy bread.' He
folded the paper again. 'I have prayed God that I might one day
meet you.'</p>

<p>'Well?' It was Manfred's voice again.</p>

<p>'I want to be with you, to be one of you, to share your
campaign and and &mdash;' he hesitated, then added soberly, 'if
need be, the death that awaits you.'</p>

<p>Manfred nodded slowly, then looked toward the man with the
limp.</p>

<p>'What do you say, Gonsalez?' he asked.</p>

<p>This Leon Gonsalez was a famous reader of faces,&mdash;that
much the young man knew,&mdash;and he turned for the test and met
the other's appraising eyes.</p>

<p>'Enthusiast, dreamer, and intellectual, of course,' said
Gonsalez slowly; 'there is reliability which is good, and balance
which is better&mdash;but &mdash;'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;?' asked Courtlander steadily.</p>

<p>'There is passion, which is bad,' was the verdict.</p>

<p>'It is a matter of training,' answered the other quietly. 'My
lot has been thrown with people who think in a frenzy and act in
madness; it is the fault of all the organizations that seek to
right wrong by indiscriminate crime, whose sense are senses, who
have debased sentiment to sentimentality, and who muddle kings
with kingship.'</p>

<p>'You are of the Red Hundred?' asked Manfred.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the other, 'because the Red Hundred carries me a
little way along the road I wish to travel.'</p>

<p>'In the direction?'</p>

<p>'Who knows?' replied the other. 'There are no straight roads,
and you cannot judge where lies your destination by the direction
the first line of path takes.'</p>

<p>'I do not tell you how great a risk you take upon yourself,'
said Manfred, 'nor do I labour the extent of the responsibility
you ask to undertake. You are a wealthy man?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Courtlander, 'as wealth goes; I have large estates
in Hungary.'</p>

<p>'I do not ask that question aimlessly, yet it would make no
difference if you were poor,' said Manfred. 'Are you prepared to
sell your estates&mdash;Buda-Gratz I believe they are
called&mdash;Highness?'</p>

<p>For the first time the young man smiled.</p>

<p>'I did not doubt but that you knew me,' he said; 'as to my
estates I will sell them without hesitation.'</p>

<p>'And place the money at my disposal?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he replied, instantly.</p>

<p>'Without reservation?'</p>

<p>'Without reservation.'</p>

<p>'And,' said Manfred, slowly, 'if we felt disposed to employ
this money for what might seem our own personal benefit, would
you take exception?'</p>

<p>'None,' said the young man, calmly.</p>

<p>'And as a proof?' demanded Poiccart, leaning a little
forward.</p>

<p>'The word of a Hap&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Enough,' said Manfred; 'we do not want your money&mdash;yet
money is the supreme test.' He pondered awhile before he spoke
again.</p>

<p>'There is the Woman of Gratz,' he said abruptly; 'at the worst
she must be killed.'</p>

<p>'It is a pity,' said Courtlander, a little sadly. He had
answered the final test did he but know it. A too willing
compliance, an over-eagerness to agree with the supreme sentence
of the 'Four', any one thing that might have betrayed the lack of
that exact balance of mind, which their word demanded, would have
irretrievably condemned him.</p>

<p>'Let us drink an arrogant toast,' said Manfred, beckoning a
waiter. The wine was opened and the glasses filled, and Manfred
muttered the toast.</p>

<p>'The Four who were three, to the Fourth who died and the
Fourth who is born.'</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a fourth who fell riddled with
bullets in a Bordeaux café, and him they pledged.</p>

<p>In Middlesex Street, in the almost emptied hall, Falmouth
stood at bay before an army of reporters.</p>

<p>'Were they the Four Just Men, Mr. Falmouth?'</p>

<p>'Did you see them?'</p>

<p>'Have you any clue?'</p>

<p>Every second brought a fresh batch of newspaper men, taxi
after taxi came into the dingy street, and the string of vehicles
lined up outside the hall was suggestive of a fashionable
gathering. The Telephone Tragedy was still fresh in the public
mind, and it needed no more than the utterance of the magical
words 'Four Just Men' to fan the spark of interest to flame
again. The delegates of the Red Hundred formed a privileged
throng in the little wilderness of a forecourt, and through these
the journalists circulated industriously.</p>

<p>Smith of the <i>Megaphone</i> and his youthful assistant,
Maynard, slipped through the crowd and found their taxi.</p>

<p>Smith shouted a direction to the driver and sank back in the
seat with a whistle of weariness.</p>

<p>'Did you hear those chaps talking about police protection?' he
asked; 'all the blessed anarchists from all over the
world&mdash;and talking like a mothers' meeting! To hear 'em you
would think they were the most respectable members of society
that the world had ever seen. Our civilization is a wonderful
thing,' he added, cryptically.</p>

<p>'One man,' said Maynard, 'asked me in very bad French if the
conduct of the Four Just Men was actionable!'</p>

<p>At that moment, another question was being put to Falmouth by
a leader of the Red Hundred, and Falmouth, a little ruffled in
his temper, replied with all the urbanity that he could
summon.</p>

<p>'You may have your meetings,' he said with some asperity, 'so
long as you do not utter anything calculated to bring about a
breach of the peace, you may talk sedition and anarchy till
you're blue in the face. Your English friends will tell you how
far you can go&mdash;and I might say you can go pretty
far&mdash;you can advocate the assassination of kings, so long as
you don't specify which king; you can plot against governments
and denounce armies and grand dukes; in fact, you can do as you
please&mdash;because that's the law.'</p>

<p>'What is&mdash;a breach of the peace?' asked his interrogator,
repeating the words with difficulty.</p>

<p>Another detective explained.</p>

<p>Francois and one Rudolph Starque escorted the Woman of Gratz
to her Bloomsbury lodgings that night, and they discussed the
detective's answer.</p>

<p>This Starque was a big man, strongly built, with a fleshy face
and little pouches under his eyes. He was reputed to be well off,
and to have a way with women.</p>

<p>'So it would appear,' he said, 'that we may say "Let the kings
be slain", but not "Let the king be slain"; also that we may
preach the downfall of governments, but if we say "Let us go into
this café"&mdash;how do you call it?&mdash;"public-house, and be
rude to the propriétaire" we commit a&mdash;er&mdash;breach of
the peace&mdash;ne c'est pas?</p>

<p>'It is so,' said Francois, 'that is the English way.'</p>

<p>'It is a mad way,' said the other.</p>

<p>They reached the door of the girl's pension. She had been very
quiet during the walk, answering questions that were put to her
in monosyllables. She had ample food for thought in the events of
the night.</p>

<p>Francois bade her a curt good night and walked a little
distance. It had come to be regarded as Starque's privilege to
stand nearest the girl. Now he took her slim hands in his and
looked down at her. Some one has said the East begins at
Bukarest, but there is a touch of the Eastern in every Hungarian,
and there is a crudeness in their whole attitude to womankind
that shocks the more tender susceptibilities of the Western.</p>

<p>'Good night, little Maria,' he said in a low voice. 'Some day
you will be kinder, and you will not leave me at the door.'</p>

<p>She looked at him steadfastly.</p>

<p>'That will never be,' she replied, without a tremor.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03">III.&mdash;JESSEN, ALIAS LONG</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE front page of every big London daily was
again black with the story of the Four Just Men.</p>

<p>'What I should like,' said the editor of the <i>Megaphone</i>,
wistfully, 'is a sort of official propaganda from the
Four&mdash;a sort of inspired manifesto that we could spread into
six columns.'</p>

<p>Charles Garret, the <i>Megaphone</i>'s 'star' reporter, with
his hat on the back of his head, and an apparently inattentive
eye fixed on the electrolier, sniffed.</p>

<p>The editor looked at him reflectively.</p>

<p>'A smart man might get into touch with them.'</p>

<p>Charles said, 'Yes,' but without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>'If it wasn't that I knew you,' mused the editor, 'I should
say you were afraid.'</p>

<p>'I am,' said Charles shamelessly.</p>

<p>'I don't want to put a younger reporter on this job,' said the
editor sadly, 'it would look bad for you; but I'm afraid I
must.'</p>

<p>'Do,' said Charles with animation, 'do, and put me down ten
shillings toward the wreath.'</p>

<p>He left the office a few minutes later with the ghost of a
smile at the corners of his mouth, and one fixed determination in
the deepest and most secret recesses of his heart. It was rather
like Charles that, having by an uncompromising firmness
established his right to refuse work of a dangerous character, he
should of his own will undertake the task against which he had
officially set his face. Perhaps his chief knew him as well as he
knew himself, for as Charles, with a last defiant snort, stalked
from the office, the smile that came to his lips was reflected on
the editor's face.</p>

<p>Walking through the echoing corridors of Megaphone House,
Charles whistled that popular and satirical song, the chorus of
which runs&mdash;</p>

<p>By kind permission of the <i>Megaphone</i>,</p>

<p>By kind permission of the <i>Megaphone</i>.</p>

<p>Summer comes when Spring has gone,</p>

<p>And the world goes spinning on,</p>

<p>By permission of the <i>Daily Megaphone</i>.</p>

<p>Presently, he found himself in Fleet Street, and, standing at
the edge of the curb, he answered a taxi-driver's expectant look
with a nod.</p>

<p>'Where to, sir?' asked the driver.</p>

<p>'37 Presley Street, Walworth&mdash;round by the "Blue Bob" and
the second turning to the left.'</p>

<p>Crossing Waterloo Bridge it occurred to him that the taxi
might attract attention, so half-way down the Waterloo Road he
gave another order, and, dismissing the vehicle, he walked the
remainder of the way.</p>

<p>Charles knocked at 37 Presley Street, and after a little wait
a firm step echoed in the passage, and the door was half opened.
The passage was dark, but he could see dimly the thick-set figure
of the man who stood waiting silently.</p>

<p>'Is that Mr. Long?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the man curtly.</p>

<p>Charles laughed, and the man seemed to recognize the voice and
opened the door a little wider.</p>

<p>'Not Mr. Garrett?' he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>'That's me,' said Charles, and walked into the house.</p>

<p>His host stopped to fasten the door, and Charles heard the
snap of the well-oiled lock and the scraping of a chain. Then
with an apology the man pushed past him and, opening the door,
ushered him into a well-lighted room, motioned Charles to a
deep-seated chair, seated himself near a small table, turned down
the page of the book from which he had evidently been reading,
and looked inquiringly at his visitor.</p>

<p>'I've come to consult you,' said Charles.</p>

<p>A lesser man than Mr. Long might have been grossly flippant,
but this young man&mdash;he was thirty-five, but looked
older&mdash;did not descend to such a level.</p>

<p>'I wanted to consult you,' he said in reply.</p>

<p>His language was the language of a man who addresses an equal,
but there was something in his manner which suggested
deference.</p>

<p>'You spoke to me about Milton,' he went on, 'but I find I
can't read him. I think it is because he is not sufficiently
material.' He paused a little. 'The only poetry I can read is the
poetry of the Bible, and that is because materialism and
mysticism are so ingeniously blended&mdash;'</p>

<p>He may have seen the shadow on the journalist's face, but he
stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>'I can talk about books another time,' he said. Charles did
not make the conventional disclaimer, but accepted the other's
interpretation of the urgency of his business.</p>

<p>'You know everybody,' said Charles, 'all the queer fish in the
basket, and a proportion of them get to know you&mdash;in time.'
The other nodded gravely.</p>

<p>'When other sources of information fail,' continued the
journalist, 'I have never hesitated to come to
you&mdash;Jessen.'</p>

<p>It may be observed that 'Mr. Long' at the threshold of the
house became 'Mr. Jessen' in the intimacy of the inner room.</p>

<p>'I owe more to you than ever you can owe to me,' he said
earnestly; 'you put me on the track,' he waved his hand round the
room as though the refinement of the room was the symbol of that
track of which he spoke. 'You remember that morning?&mdash;if you
have forgotten, I haven't&mdash;when I told you that to
forget&mdash;I must drink? And you said&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I haven't forgotten, Jessen,' said the correspondent quietly;
'and the fact that you have accomplished all that you have is a
proof that there's good stuff in you.'</p>

<p>The other accepted the praise without comment.</p>

<p>'Now,' Charles went on, 'I want to tell you what I started out
to tell: I'm following a big story. It's the Four Just Men story;
you know all about it? I see that you do; well, I've got to get
into touch with them somehow. I do not for one moment imagine
that you can help me, nor do I expect that these chaps have any
accomplices amongst the people you know.'</p>

<p>'They have not,' said Jessen; 'I haven't thought it worth
while inquiring. Would you like to go to the Guild?'</p>

<p>Charles pursed his lips in thought.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said slowly, 'that's an idea; yes, when?'</p>

<p>'Tonight&mdash;if you wish.'</p>

<p>'Tonight let it be,' said Charles.</p>

<p>His host rose and left the room.</p>

<p>He reappeared presently, wearing a dark overcoat and about his
throat a black silk muffler that emphasized the pallor of his
strong square face.</p>

<p>'Wait a moment,' he said, and unlocked a drawer, from which he
took a revolver.</p>

<p>He turned the magazine carefully, and Charles smiled.</p>

<p>'Will that be necessary?' he asked.</p>

<p>Jessen shook his head.</p>

<p>'No,' he said with a little embarrassment, 'but&mdash;I have
given up all my follies and fancies, but this one sticks.'</p>

<p>'The fear of discovery?'</p>

<p>Jessen nodded.</p>

<p>'It's the only folly left&mdash;this fear. It's the fly in the
ointment.'</p>

<p>He led the way through the narrow passage, first having
extinguished the lamp.</p>

<p>They stood together in the dark street, whilst Jessen made
sure the fastening of the house.</p>

<p>'Now,' he said, and in a few minutes they found themselves
amidst the raucous confusion of a Walworth Road market-night.</p>

<p>They walked on in silence, then turning into East Street, they
threaded a way between loitering shoppers, dodged between stalls
overhung by flaring naphtha lamps, and turned sharply into a
narrow street.</p>

<p>Both men seemed sure of their ground, for they walked quickly
and unhesitatingly, and striking off through a tiny court that
connected one malodorous thoroughfare with the other, they
stopped simultaneously before the door of what appeared to be a
disused factory.</p>

<p>A peaky-faced youth who sat by the door and acted as
doorkeeper thrust his hand forward as they entered, but
recognizing them drew back without a word.</p>

<p>They ascended the flight of ill-lighted stairs that confronted
them, and pushing open a door at the head of the stairs, Jessen
ushered his friend into a large hall.</p>

<p>It was a curious scene that met the journalist's eye. Well
acquainted with 'The Guild' as he was, and with its extraordinary
composition, he had never yet put his foot inside its portals.
Basing his conception upon his knowledge of working-men's clubs
and philanthropic institutions for the regeneration of degraded
youth, he missed the inevitable billiard-table; he missed, too,
the table strewn with month-old literature, but most of all he
missed the smell of free coffee.</p>

<p>The floor was covered with sawdust, and about the fire that
crackled and blazed at one end of the room there was a semicircle
of chairs occupied by men of varying ages. Old-looking young men
and young-looking old men, men in rags, men well dressed, men
flashily attired in loud clothing and resplendent with shoddy
jewellery. And they were drinking.</p>

<p>Two youths at one end of the crescent shared a quart pewter
pot; the flashy man whose voice dominated the conversation held a
glass of whisky in one beringed hand, and the white-haired man
with the scarred face who sat with bowed head listening had a
spirit glass half filled with some colourless fluid.</p>

<p>Nobody rose to greet the newcomers.</p>

<p>The flashy man nodded genially, and one of the circle pushed
his chair back to give place to Jessen.</p>

<p>'I was just a-saying&mdash;' said the flashy man, then looked
at Charles.</p>

<p>'All right,' signalled Jessen.</p>

<p>'I was just a-sayin' to these lads,' continued the flashy one,
'that takin' one thing with the other, there's worse places than
"stir".'</p>

<p>Jessen made no reply to this piece of dogmatism, and he of the
rings went on.</p>

<p>'An' what's the good of a man tryin' to go straight. The
police will pull you all the same: not reportin' change of
address, loitering with intent; it don't matter what you do if
you've been in trouble once, you're sure to get in again.'</p>

<p>There was a murmur of assent.</p>

<p>'Look at me,' said the speaker with pride. 'I've never tried
to go straight&mdash;been in twice an' it took six policemen to
take me last time, and they had to use the "stick".'</p>

<p>Jessen looked at him with mild curiosity.</p>

<p>'What does that prove, except that the policemen were pretty
soft?'</p>

<p>'Not a bit!' The man stood up.</p>

<p>Under the veneer of tawdry foppery, Charles detected the
animal strength of the criminal.</p>

<p>'Why, when I'm fit, as I am now,' the man went on, 'there
ain't two policemen, nor four neither, that could handle me.'</p>

<p>Jessen's hand shot out and caught him by the forearm.</p>

<p>'Get away,' he suggested, and the man swung round like
lightning, but Jessen had his other arm in a grip of iron.</p>

<p>'Get away,' he said again; but the man was helpless, and knew
it, and after a pause Jessen released his hold.</p>

<p>'How was that?' he asked.</p>

<p>The amused smiles of the men did not embarrass the
prisoner.</p>

<p>'The guv'nor's different,' he explained easily; 'he's got a
knack of his own that the police haven't got.'</p>

<p>Jessen drew up a chair, and whatever there was in the action
that had significance, it was sufficient to procure an immediate
silence.</p>

<p>He looked round the attentive faces that were turned toward
him. Charles, an interested spectator, saw the eager faces that
bent in his friend's direction, and marvelled not a little at the
reproductive qualities of the seed he had sown.</p>

<p>Jessen began to speak slowly, and Charles saw that what he
said was in the nature of an address. That these addresses of
Jessen were nothing unusual, and that they were welcome, was
evident from the attention with which they were received.</p>

<p>'What Falk has been telling you,' said Jessen, indicating the
man with the rings, 'is true&mdash;so far as it goes. There are
worse places than "stir", and it's true that the police don't
give an old lag a chance, but that's because a lag won't change
his job. And a lag won't change his job, because he doesn't know
any other trade where he gets money so quickly. Wally'&mdash;he
jerked his head toward a weedy-looking youth&mdash;'Wally there
got a stretch for what? For stuff that fetched thirty pounds from
a fence. Twelve months' hard work for thirty pounds! It works out
at about 10s, 6d. a week. And his lawyer and the mouthpiece cost
him a fiver out of that. Old man Garth'&mdash;he pointed to the
white-headed man with the gin &mdash;'did a five stretch for less
than that, and he's out on brief. His wage works out at about a
shilling a week.'</p>

<p>He checked the impatient motion that Falk made.</p>

<p>'I know that Falk would say,' he went on smoothly, 'that what
I'm saying is outside the bargain; when I fixed up the Guild, I
gave my 'davy that there wouldn't be any parson talk or
Come-All-Ye-Faithful singing. Everybody knows that being on the
crook's a mug's game, and I don't want to rub it in. What I've
always said and done is in the direction of making you fellows
earn bigger money at your own trade.</p>

<p>'There's a man who writes about the army who's been trying to
induce soldiers to learn trades, and he started right by making
the Tommies dissatisfied with their own trade; and that is what I
am trying to do. What did I do with young Isaacs? I didn't preach
at him, and I didn't pray over him. Ike was one of the finest
snide merchants in London. He used to turn out half-crowns made
from pewter pots that defied detection. They rang true and they
didn't bend. Ike got three years, and when he came out I found
him a job. Did I try to make him a wood-chopper, or a Salvation
Army plough-boy? No. He'd have been back on the crook in a week
if I had. I got a firm of medal makers in Birmingham to take him,
and when Ike found himself amongst plaster moulds and electric
baths, and discovered he could work at his own trade honestly, he
stuck to it.'</p>

<p>'We ain't snide merchants,' growled Falk discontentedly.</p>

<p>'It's the same with all branches,' Jessen went on, 'only you
chaps don't know it. Take tale-pitching&mdash;'</p>

<p>It would not be fair to follow Jessen through the elaborate
disquisition by which he proved to the satisfaction of his
audience that the 'confidence' man was a born commercial
traveller. Many of his arguments were as unsound as they could
well be; he ignored first principles, and glossed over what
seemed to such a clear-headed hearer as Charles to be insuperable
obstacles in the scheme of regeneration. But his audience was
convinced. The fringe of men round the fire was reinforced as he
continued. Men came into the room singly, and in twos and threes,
and added themselves to the group at the fire. The news had
spread that Jessen was talking&mdash;they called him 'Mr. Long,'
by the way&mdash;and some of the newcomers arrived breathlessly,
as though they had run in order that no part of the address
should be missed.</p>

<p>That the advocate of discontent had succeeded in installing
into the minds of his hearers that unrest and dissatisfaction
which he held to be the basis of a new moral code, was certain.
For every face bore the stamp of introspective doubt.</p>

<p>Interesting as it all was, Charles Garrett had not lost sight
of the object of his visit, and he fidgeted a little as the
speaker proceeded.</p>

<p>Immediately on entering the room he had grasped the exact
relationship in which Jessen stood to his pupils. Jessen he knew
could put no direct question as to their knowledge of the Four
Just Men without raising a feeling of suspicion which would have
been fatal to the success of the mission, and indeed would have
imperilled the very existence of the 'Guild'.</p>

<p>It was when Jessen had finished speaking, and had answered a
dozen questions fired simultaneously from a dozen quarters, and
had answered the questions that had arisen out of these queries,
that an opening came from an unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>For, with the serious business of the meeting disposed of, the
questions took the inevitable facetious turn.</p>

<p>'What trade would you give the Four Just Men?' asked Falk
flippantly, and there was a little rumble of laughter.</p>

<p>The journalist's eyes met the reformer's for one second, and
through the minds of both men flashed the answer. Jessen's mouth
twitched a little, and his restless hands were even more agitated
as he replied slowly:</p>

<p>'If anybody can tell me exactly what the Four Just
Men&mdash;what their particular line of business is, I could
reply to that.'</p>

<p>It was the old man sipping his gin in silence who spoke for
the first time.</p>

<p>'D'ye remember Billy Marks?' he asked.</p>

<p>His voice was harsh, as is that of a man who uses his voice at
rare intervals.</p>

<p>'Billy Marks is dead,' he continued, 'deader than a door-nail.
He knew the Four Just Men; pinched the watch an' the notebook of
one an' nearly pinched them.'</p>

<p>There was a man who sat next to Falk who had been regarding
Charles with furtive attention.</p>

<p>Now he turned to Jessen and spoke to the point. 'Don't get any
idea in your head that the likes of us will ever have anything to
do with the Four,' he said. 'Why, Mr. Long,' he went on, 'the
Four Just Men are as likely to come to you as to us; bein' as you
are a government official, it's very likely indeed.'</p>

<p>Again Jessen and Charles exchanged a swift glance, and in the
eyes of the journalist was a strange light.</p>

<p>Suppose they came to Jessen! It was not unlikely. Once before,
in pursuing their vengeance in a South American State, they had
come to such a man as Jessen. It was a thought, and one worth
following.</p>

<p>Turning the possibilities over in his mind Charles stood deep
in thought as Jessen, still speaking, was helped into his
overcoat by one of the men.</p>

<p>Then as they left the hall together, passing the custodian of
the place at the foot of the stairs, the journalist turned to his
companion.</p>

<p>'Should they come to you&mdash;?'</p>

<p>Jessen shook his head.</p>

<p>'That is unlikely,' he said; 'they hardly require outside
help.'</p>

<p>They walked the rest of the way in silence.</p>

<p>Charles shook hands at the door of Jessen's house.</p>

<p>'If by any chance they should come&mdash;' he said.</p>

<p>Jessen laughed.</p>

<p>'I will let you know,' he said a little ironically.</p>

<p>Then he entered his house, and Charles heard again the snap of
the lock as the strange man closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours the newspapers recorded the
mysterious disappearance of a Mr. J. Long, of Presley Street.
Such a disappearance would have been without interest, but for a
note that was found on his table. It ran:</p>

<p>Mr. Long being necessary for our purpose, we have taken
him.</p>

<p>THE FOUR JUST MEN</p>

<p>That the affair had connection with the Four was sufficient to
give it an extraordinary news value. That the press was
confounded goes without saying. For Mr. Long was a fairly
unimportant man with some self-education and a craze for
reforming the criminal classes. But the Home Office, which knew
Mr. Long as 'Mr. Jessen', was greatly perturbed, and the genius
of Scotland Yard was employed to discover his whereabouts.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04">IV.&mdash;THE RED BEAN</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE Inner Council sent out an urgent call to the
men who administer the affairs of the Red Hundred.</p>

<p>Starque came, Francois, the Frenchman, came, Hollom, the
Italian, Paul Mirtisky, George Grabe, the American, and Lauder
Bartholomew, the ex-captain of Irregular Cavalry, came also.
Bartholomew was the best dressed of the men who gathered about
the green table in Greek Street, for he had held the King's
commission, which is of itself a sartorial education. People who
met him vaguely remembered his name and frowned. They had a dim
idea that there was 'something against him', but were not quite
sure what it was. It had to do with the South African War and a
surrender&mdash;not an ordinary surrender, but an arrangement
with the enemy on a cash basis, and the transference of stores.
There was a court martial, and a cashiering, and afterwards
Bartholomew came to England and bombarded first the War Office
and then the press with a sheaf of type-written grievances.
Afterwards he went into the theatrical line of business and
appeared in music-hall sketches as 'Captain Lauder
Bartholomew&mdash;the Hero of Dopfontein'.</p>

<p>There were other chapters which made good reading, for he
figured in a divorce case, ran a society newspaper, owned a few
selling platers, and achieved the distinction of appearing in the
Racing Calendar in a paragraph which solemnly and officially
forbade his presence on Newmarket Heath.</p>

<p>That he should figure on the Inner Council of the Red Hundred
is remarkable only in so far as it demonstrates how much out of
touch with British sentiments and conditions is the average
continental politician. For Bartholomew's secret application to
be enrolled a member of the Red Hundred had been received with
acclamation and his promotion to the Inner Council had been
rapid. Was he not an English officer&mdash;an aristocrat? A
member of the most exclusive circle of English society? Thus
argued the Red Hundred, to whom a subaltern in a scallywag corps
did not differ perceptibly from a Commander of the Household
Cavalry.</p>

<p>Bartholomew lied his way to the circle, because he found, as
he had all along suspected, that there was a strong business end
to terrorism. There were grants for secret service work, and with
his fertile imagination it was not difficult to find excuses and
reasons for approaching the financial executive of the Red
Hundred at frequent intervals. He claimed intimacy with royal
personages. He not only stated as a fact that he was in their
confidence, but he suggested family ties which reflected little
credit upon his progenitors.</p>

<p>The Red Hundred was a paying speculation; membership of the
Inner Council was handsomely profitable. He had drawn a bow at a
venture when under distress&mdash;literally it was a distress
warrant issued at the instance of an importunate
landlord&mdash;he had indited a letter to a revolutionary
offering to act as London agent for an organization which was
then known as The Friends of the People, but which has since been
absorbed into the body corporate of the Red Hundred. It is
necessary to deal fully with the antecedents of this man because
he played a part in the events that are chronicled in the Council
of Justice that had effects further reaching than Bartholomew,
the mercenary of anarchism, could in his wildest moments have
imagined.</p>

<p>He was one of the seven that gathered in the dingy drawing-room
of a Greek Street boarding-house, and it was worthy of note
that five of his fellows greeted him with a deference amounting
to humility. The exception was Starque, who, arriving late, found
an admiring circle hanging upon the words of this young man with
the shifty eyes, and he frowned his displeasure.</p>

<p>Bartholomew looked up as Starque entered and nodded
carelessly.</p>

<p>Starque took his place at the head of the table, and motioned
impatiently to the others to be seated. One, whose duty it was,
rose from his chair and locked the door. The windows were
shuttered, but he inspected the fastenings; then, taking from his
pocket two packs of cards, he scattered them in a confused heap
upon the table. Every man produced a handful of money and placed
it before him.</p>

<p>Starque was an ingenious man and had learnt many things in
Russia. Men who gather round a green baize-covered table with
locked doors are apt to be dealt with summarily if no adequate
excuse for their presence is evident, and it is more satisfactory
to be fined a hundred roubles for gambling than to be dragged off
at a moment's notice to an indefinite period of labour in the
mines on suspicion of being concerned in a revolutionary
plot.</p>

<p>Starque now initiated the business of the evening. If the
truth be told, there was little in the earlier proceedings that
differed from the procedure of the typical committee.</p>

<p>There were monies to be voted. Bartholomew needed supplies for
a trip to Paris, where, as the guest of an Illustrious Personage,
he hoped to secure information of vital importance to the
Hundred.</p>

<p>'This is the fourth vote in two months, comrade,' said Starque
testily, 'last time it was for information from your Foreign
Office, which proved to be inaccurate.'</p>

<p>Bartholomew shrugged his shoulders with an assumption of
carelessness.</p>

<p>'If you doubt the wisdom of voting the money, let it pass,' he
said; 'my men fly high&mdash;I am not bribing policemen or
sous-officiers of diplomacy.'</p>

<p>'It is not a question of money,' said Starque sullenly, 'it is
a question of results. Money we have in plenty, but the success
of our glorious demonstration depends upon the reliability of our
information.'</p>

<p>The vote was passed, and with its passing came a grim element
into the council.</p>

<p>Starque leant forward and lowered his voice.</p>

<p>'There are matters that need your immediate attention,' he
said. He took a paper from his pocket, and smoothed it open in
front of him. 'We have been so long inactive that the tyrants to
whom the name of Red Hundred is full of terror, have come to
regard themselves as immune from danger. Yet,' his voice sank
lower, 'yet we are on the eve of the greatest of our
achievements, when the oppressors of the people shall be moved at
one blow! And we will strike a blow at kingship as shall be
remembered in the history of the world aye, when the victories of
Caesar and Alexander are forgotten and when the scenes of our
acts are overlaid with the dust and debris of a thousand years.
But that great day is not yet&mdash;first we must remove the
lesser men that the blow may fall surer; first the servant, then
the master.' He stabbed the list before him with a thick
forefinger.</p>

<p>'Fritz von Hedlitz,' he read, 'Chancellor to the Duchy of
Hamburg-Altoona.'</p>

<p>He looked round the board and smiled.</p>

<p>'A man of some initiative, comrades&mdash;he foiled our
attempt on his master with some cunning&mdash;do I interpret your
desire when I say &mdash;death?'</p>

<p>'Death!'</p>

<p>It was a low murmured chorus.</p>

<p>Bartholomew, renegade and adventurer, said it mechanically. It
was nothing to him a brave gentleman should die for no other
reason than that he had served his master faithfully.</p>

<p>'Marquis de Santo-Strato, private secretary to the Prince of
the Escorial,' read Starque.</p>

<p>'Death!' Again the murmured sentence.</p>

<p>One by one, Starque read the names, stopping now and again to
emphasize some enormity of the man under review.</p>

<p>'Here is Hendrik Houssmann,' he said, tapping the paper, 'of
the Berlin Secret Police: an interfering man and a dangerous one.
He has already secured the arrest and punishment of one of our
comrades.'</p>

<p>'Death,' murmured the council mechanically.</p>

<p>The list took half an hour to dispose of.</p>

<p>'There is another matter,' said Starque.</p>

<p>The council moved uneasily, for that other matter was
uppermost in every mind.</p>

<p>'By some means we have been betrayed,' the chairman went on,
and his voice lacked that confidence which characterized his
earlier speech; 'there is an organization&mdash;an organization
of reaction&mdash;which has set itself to thwart us. That
organization has discovered our identity.' He paused a
little.</p>

<p>'This morning I received a letter which named me president of
the Inner Council and threatened me.' Again he hesitated.</p>

<p>'It was signed "The Four Just Men".'</p>

<p>His statement was received in dead silence&mdash;a silence
that perplexed him, for his compensation for the shock he had
received had been the anticipation of the sensation his
announcement would make.</p>

<p>He was soon enlightened as to the cause of the silence.</p>

<p>'I also have received a letter,' said Francois quietly.</p>

<p>'And I.'</p>

<p>'And I.'</p>

<p>'And I.'</p>

<p>Only Bartholomew did not speak, and he felt the unspoken
accusation of the others.</p>

<p>'I have received no letter,' he said with an easy
laugh&mdash;'only these.' He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and
produced two beans. There was nothing peculiar in these save one
was a natural black and the other had been dyed red.</p>

<p>'What do they mean?' demanded Starque suspiciously.</p>

<p>'I have not the slightest idea,' said Bartholomew with a
contemptuous smile; 'they came in a little box, such as jewellery
is sent in, and were unaccompanied either by letter or anything
of the kind. These mysterious messages do not greatly alarm
me.'</p>

<p>'But what does it mean?' persisted Starque, and every neck was
craned toward the seeds; 'they must have some
significance&mdash;think.'</p>

<p>Bartholomew yawned.</p>

<p>'So far as I know, they are beyond explanation,' he said
carelessly; 'neither red nor black beans have played any
conspicuous part in my life, so far as I&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stopped short and they saw a wave of colour rush to his
face, then die away, leaving it deadly pale.</p>

<p>'Well?' demanded Starque; there was a menace in the
question.</p>

<p>'Let me see,' faltered Bartholomew, and he took up the red
bean with a hand that shook.</p>

<p>He turned it over and over in his hand, calling up his reserve
of strength.</p>

<p>He could not explain, that much he realized.</p>

<p>The explanation might have been possible had he realized
earlier the purport of the message he had received, but now with
six pairs of suspicious eyes turned upon him, and with his
confusion duly noted his hesitation would tell against him.</p>

<p>He had to invent a story that would pass muster.</p>

<p>'Years ago,' he began, holding his voice steady, 'I was a
member of such an organization as this: and&mdash;and there was a
traitor.' The story was plain to him now, and he recovered his
balance. 'The traitor was discovered and we balloted for his
life. There was an equal number for death and immunity, and I as
president had to give the casting vote. A red bean was for life
and a black for death&mdash;and I cast my vote for the man's
death.'</p>

<p>He saw the impression his invention had created and elaborated
the story. Starque, holding the red bean in his hand, examined it
carefully.</p>

<p>'I have reason to think that by my action I made many enemies,
one of whom probably sent this reminder.' He breathed an inward
sigh of relief as he saw the clouds of doubt lifting from the
faces about him. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>'And the £1,000?' asked Starque quietly.</p>

<p>Nobody saw Bartholomew bite his lip, because his hand was
caressing his soft black moustache. What they all observed was
the well simulated surprise expressed in the lift of his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>'The thousand pounds?' he said puzzled, then he laughed. 'Oh,
I see you, too, have heard the story&mdash;we found the traitor
had accepted that sum to betray us&mdash;and this we confiscated
for the benefit of the Society &mdash;and rightly so,' he added,
indignantly.</p>

<p>The murmur of approbation relieved him of any fear as to the
result of his explanation. Even Starque smiled.</p>

<p>'I did not know the story,' he said, 'but I did see the
"£1,000" which had been scratched on the side of the red bean;
but this brings us no nearer to the solution of the mystery. Who
has betrayed us to the Four Just Men?'</p>

<p>There came, as he spoke, a gentle tapping on the door of the
room. Francois, who sat at the president's right hand, rose
stealthily and tiptoed to the door.</p>

<p>'Who is there?' he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>Somebody spoke in German, and the voice carried so that every
man knew the speaker.</p>

<p>'The Woman of Gratz,' said Bartholomew, and in his eagerness
he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>If one sought for the cause of friction between Starque and
the ex-captain of Irregular Cavalry, here was the end of the
search. The flame that came to the eyes of these two men as she
entered the room told the story.</p>

<p>Starque, heavily made, animal man to his fingertips, rose to
greet her, his face aglow.</p>

<p>'Madonna,' he murmured, and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>She was dressed well enough, with a rich sable coat that
fitted tightly to her sinuous figure, and a fur toque upon her
beautiful head.</p>

<p>She held a gloved hand toward Bartholomew and smiled.</p>

<p>Bartholomew, like his rival, had a way with women; but it was
a gentle way, overladen with Western conventions and hedged about
with set proprieties. That he was a contemptible villain
according to our conceptions is true, but he had received a
rudimentary training in the world of gentlemen. He had moved
amongst men who took their hats off to their womenkind, and who
controlled their actions by a nebulous code. Yet he behaved with
greater extravagance than did Starque, for he held her hand in
his, looking into her eyes, whilst Starque fidgeted
impatiently.</p>

<p>'Comrade,' at last he said testily, 'we will postpone our talk
with our little Maria. It would be bad for her to think that she
is holding us from our work&mdash;and there are the
Four&mdash;'</p>

<p>He saw her shiver.</p>

<p>'The Four?' she repeated. 'Then they have written to you,
also?'</p>

<p>Starque brought his fist with a crash down on the table.</p>

<p>'You&mdash;you! They have dared threaten you? By
Heaven&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she went on, and it seemed that her rich sweet voice
grew a little husky; 'they have threatened&mdash;me.'</p>

<p>She loosened the furs at her throat as though the room had
suddenly become hot and the atmosphere unbreathable.</p>

<p>The torrent of words that came tumbling to the lips of Starque
was arrested by the look in her face.</p>

<p>'It isn't death that I fear,' she went on slowly; 'indeed, I
scarcely know what I fear.'</p>

<p>Bartholomew, superficial and untouched by the tragic mystery
of her voice, broke in upon their silence. For silenced they were
by the girl's distress.</p>

<p>'With such men as we about, why need you notice the theatrical
play of these Four Just Men?' he asked, with a laugh; then he
remembered the two little beans and became suddenly silent with
the rest.</p>

<p>So complete and inexplicable was the chill that had come to
them with the pronouncement of the name of their enemy, and so
absolutely did the spectacle of the Woman of Gratz on the verge
of tears move them, that they heard then what none had heard
before&mdash;the ticking of the clock.</p>

<p>It was the habit of many years that carried Bartholomew's hand
to his pocket, mechanically he drew out his watch, and
automatically he cast his eyes about the room for the clock
wherewith to check the time.</p>

<p>It was one of those incongruous pieces of commonplace that
intrude upon tragedy, but it loosened the tongues of the council,
and they all spoke together.</p>

<p>It was Starque who gathered the girl's trembling hands between
his plump palms.</p>

<p>'Maria, Maria,' he chided softly, 'this is folly. What! the
Woman of Gratz who defied all Russia&mdash;who stood before
Mirtowsky and bade him defiance&mdash;what is it?'</p>

<p>The last words were sharp and angry and were directed to
Bartholomew.</p>

<p>For the second time that night the Englishman's face was
white, and he stood clutching the edge of the table with staring
eyes and with his lower jaw drooping.</p>

<p>'God, man!' cried Starque, seizing him by the arm, 'what is
it&mdash;speak&mdash;you are frightening her!'</p>

<p>'The clock!' gasped Bartholomew in a hollow voice,
'where&mdash;where is the clock?'</p>

<p>His staring eyes wandered helplessly from side to side.
'Listen,' he whispered, and they held their breath. Very plainly
indeed did they hear the 'tick&mdash;tick&mdash;tick.'</p>

<p>'It is under the table,' muttered Francois.</p>

<p>Starque seized the cloth and lifted it. Underneath, in the
shadow, he saw the black box and heard the ominous whir of
clockwork. 'Out!' he roared and sprang to the door. It was locked
and from the outside.</p>

<p>Again and again he flung his huge bulk against the door, but
the men who pressed round him, whimpering and slobbering in their
pitiable fright, crowded about him and gave him no room.</p>

<p>With his strong arms he threw them aside left and right; then
leapt at the door, bringing all his weight and strength to bear,
and the door crashed open.</p>

<p>Alone of the party the Woman of Gratz preserved her calm. She
stood by the table, her foot almost touching the accursed
machine, and she felt the faint vibrations of its working. Then
Starque caught her up in his arms and through the narrow passage
he half led, half carried her, till they reached the street in
safety.</p>

<p>The passing pedestrians saw the dishevelled group, and,
scenting trouble, gathered about them.</p>

<p>'What was it? What was it?' whispered Francois, but Starque
pushed him aside with a snarl.</p>

<p>A taxi was passing and he called it, and lifting the girl
inside, he shouted directions and sprang in after her.</p>

<p>As the taxi whirled away, the bewildered Council looked from
one to the other.</p>

<p>They had left the door of the house wide open and in the hall
a flickering gas-jet gyrated wildly.</p>

<p>'Get away from here,' said Bartholomew beneath his breath.</p>

<p>'But the papers&mdash;the records,' said the other wringing
his hands.</p>

<p>Bartholomew thought quickly.</p>

<p>The records were such as could not be left lying about with
impunity. For all he knew these madmen had implicated him in
their infernal writings. He was not without courage, but it
needed all he possessed to re-enter the room where a little
machine in a black box ticked mysteriously.</p>

<p>'Where are they?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'On the table,' almost whispered the other. 'Mon Dieu! what
disaster!' The Englishman made up his mind.</p>

<p>He sprang up the three steps into the hall. Two paces brought
him to the door, another stride to the table. He heard the 'tick'
of the machine, he gave one glance to the table and another to
the floor, and was out again in the street before he had taken
two long breaths.</p>

<p>Francois stood waiting, the rest of the men had
disappeared.</p>

<p>'The papers! the papers!' cried the Frenchman.</p>

<p>'Gone!' replied Bartholomew between his teeth.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred yards away another conference was being
held.</p>

<p>'Manfred,' said Poiccart suddenly&mdash;there had been a lull
in the talk&mdash;'shall we need our friend?'</p>

<p>Manfred smiled.</p>

<p>'Meaning the admirable Mr. Jessen?'</p>

<p>Poiccart nodded.</p>

<p>'I think so,' said Manfred quietly; 'I am not so sure that the
cheap alarm-clock we put in the biscuit box will be a sufficient
warning to the Inner Council&mdash;here is Leon.'</p>

<p>Gonsalez walked into the room and removed his overcoat
deliberately.</p>

<p>Then they saw that the sleeve of his dress coat was torn, and
Manfred remarked the stained handkerchief that was lightly bound
round one hand.</p>

<p>'Glass,' explained Gonsalez laconically. 'I had to scale a
wall.'</p>

<p>'Well?' asked Manfred.</p>

<p>'Very well,' replied the other; 'they bolted like sheep, and I
had nothing to do but to walk in and carry away the extremely
interesting record of sentences they have passed.'</p>

<p>'What of Bartholomew?' Gonsalez was mildly amused. 'He was
less panicky than the rest&mdash;he came back to look for the
papers.'</p>

<p>'Will he&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'I think so,' said Leon. 'I noticed he left the black bean
behind him in his flight&mdash;so I presume we shall see the
red.'</p>

<p>'It will simplify matters,' said Manfred gravely.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05">V.&mdash;THE COUNCIL OF
JUSTICE</a></h2>

<p class="first">LAUDER BARTHOLOMEW knew a man who was farming in
Uganda. It was not remarkable that he should suddenly remember
his friend's existence and call to mind a three years' old
invitation to spend a winter in that part of Africa. Bartholomew
had a club. It was euphemistically styled in all the best
directories as 'Social, Literary and Dramatic', but knowing men
about town called it by a shorter title. To them it was a 'night
club'. Poorly as were the literary members catered for, there
were certain weeklies, The Times, and a collection of
complimentary timetables to be obtained for the asking, and
Bartholomew sought and found particulars of sailings. He might
leave London on the next morning and overtake (via Brindisi and
Suez) the German boat that would land him in Uganda in a couple
of weeks.</p>

<p>On the whole he thought this course would be wise.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, the Red Hundred was becoming too much of a
serious business; he had a feeling that he was suspect, and was
more certain that the end of his unlimited financing was in
sight. That much he had long since recognized, and had made his
plans accordingly. As to the Four Just Men, they would come in
with Menshikov; it would mean only a duplication of treachery.
Turning the pages of a Bradshaw, he mentally reviewed his
position. He had in hand some seven hundred pounds, and his
liabilities were of no account because the necessity for
discharging them never occurred to him. Seven hundred
pounds&mdash;and the red bean, and Menshikov.</p>

<p>'If they mean business,' he said to himself, 'I can count on
three thousand.'</p>

<p>The obvious difficulty was to get into touch with the Four.
Time was everything and one could not put an advertisement in the
paper:</p>

<p>'If the Four Just Men will communicate with L&mdash; B&mdash;
they will hear of something to their advantage.'</p>

<p>Nor was it expedient to make in the agony columns of the
London press even the most guarded reference to Red Beans after
what had occurred at the Council Meeting. The matter of the
Embassy was simple. Under his breath he cursed the Four Just Men
for their unbusinesslike communication. If only they had
mentioned or hinted at some rendezvous the thing might have been
arranged.</p>

<p>A man in evening dress asked him if he had finished with the
Bradshaw. He resigned it ungraciously, and calling a club waiter,
ordered a whisky and soda and flung himself into a chair to think
out a solution.</p>

<p>The man returned the Bradshaw with a polite apology.</p>

<p>'So sorry to have interrupted, but I've been called abroad at
a moment's notice,' he said.</p>

<p>Bartholomew looked up resentfully. This young man's face
seemed familiar.</p>

<p>'Haven't I met you somewhere?' he asked.</p>

<p>The stranger shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'One is always meeting and forgetting,' he smiled. 'I thought
I knew you, but I cannot quite place you.'</p>

<p>Not only the face but the voice was strangely familiar.</p>

<p>'Not English,' was Bartholomew's mental analysis, 'possibly
French, more likely Slav&mdash;who the dickens can it be?'</p>

<p>In a way he was glad of the diversion, and found himself
engaged in a pleasant discussion on fly fishing.</p>

<p>As the hands of the clock pointed to midnight, the stranger
yawned and got up from his chair.</p>

<p>'Going west?' he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>Bartholomew had no definite plans for spending the next hour,
so he assented and the two men left the club together. They
strolled across Piccadilly Circus and into Piccadilly, chatting
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Through Half Moon Street into Berkeley Square, deserted and
silent, the two men sauntered, then the stranger stopped. 'I'm
afraid I've taken you out of your way,' he said.</p>

<p>'Not a bit,' replied Bartholomew, and was conventionally
amiable. Then they parted, and the ex-captain walked back by the
way he had come, picking up again the threads of the problem that
had filled his mind in the earlier part of the evening.</p>

<p>Halfway down Half Moon Street was a motor-car, and as he came
abreast, a man who stood by the curb&mdash;and whom he had
mistaken for a waiting chauffeur&mdash;barred his further
progress.</p>

<p>'Captain Bartholomew?' he asked respectfully.</p>

<p>'That is my name,' said the other in surprise.</p>

<p>'My master wishes to know whether you have decided.'</p>

<p>'What&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'If,' went on his imperturbable examiner, 'if you have decided
on the red &mdash;here is the car, if you will be pleased to
enter.'</p>

<p>'And if I have decided on the black?' he asked with a little
hesitation.</p>

<p>'Under the circumstances,' said the man without emotion, 'my
master is of opinion that for his greater safety, he must take
steps to ensure your neutrality.'</p>

<p>There was no menace in the tone, but an icy matter-of-fact
confidence that shocked this hardened adventurer.</p>

<p>In the dim light he saw something in the man's hand&mdash;a
thin bright something that glittered.</p>

<p>'It shall be red!' he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>The man bowed and opened the door of the car.</p>

<p>Bartholomew had regained a little of his self-assurance by the
time he stood before the men.</p>

<p>He was not unused to masked tribunals. There had been one such
since his elevation to the Inner Council.</p>

<p>But these four men were in evening dress, and the stagey
setting that had characterized the Red Hundred's Court of Justice
was absent. There was no weird adjustment of lights, or rollings
of bells, or partings of sombre draperies. None of the cheap
trickery of the Inner Council.</p>

<p>The room was evidently a drawing-room, very much like a
hundred other drawing-rooms he had seen.</p>

<p>The four men who sat at equal distance before him were
sufficiently ordinary in appearance save for their masks. He
thought one of them wore a beard, but he was not sure. This man
did most of the speaking.</p>

<p>'I understand,' he said smoothly, 'you have chosen the
red.'</p>

<p>'You seem to know a great deal about my private affairs,'
replied Bartholomew.</p>

<p>'You have chosen the red&mdash;again?' said the man.</p>

<p>'Why&mdash;again?' demanded the prisoner.</p>

<p>The masked man's eyes shone steadily through the holes in the
mask.</p>

<p>'Years ago,' he said quietly, 'there was an officer who
betrayed his country and his comrades.'</p>

<p>'That is an old lie.'</p>

<p>'He was in charge of a post at which was stored a great supply
of foodstuffs and ammunition,' the mask went on. 'There was a
commandant of the enemy who wanted those stores, but had not
sufficient men to rush the garrison.'</p>

<p>'An old lie,' repeated Bartholomew sullenly.</p>

<p>'So the commandant hit upon the ingenious plan of offering a
bribe. It was a risky thing, and in nine hundred and ninety-nine
cases out of a thousand, it would have been a futile business.
Indeed, I am sure that I am understating the proportion&mdash;but
the wily old commandant knew his man.'</p>

<p>'There is no necessity to continue,' said Bartholomew.</p>

<p>'No correspondence passed,' Manfred went on; 'our officer was
too cunning for that, but it was arranged that the officer's
answer should be conveyed thus.'</p>

<p>He opened his hand and Bartholomew saw two beans, one red and
the other black, reposing in the palm.</p>

<p>'The black was to be a refusal, the red an acceptance, the
terms were to be scratched on the side of the red bean with a
needle&mdash;and the sum agreed was £1,000.' Bartholomew made no
answer.</p>

<p>'Exactly that sum we offer you to place us from time to time
in possession of such information as we require concerning the
movements of the Red Hundred.'</p>

<p>'If I refuse?'</p>

<p>'You will not refuse,' replied the mask calmly; 'you need the
money, and you have even now under consideration a plan for
cutting yourself adrift from your friends.'</p>

<p>'You know so much&mdash;' began the other with a shrug.</p>

<p>'I know a great deal. For instance, I know that you
contemplate immediate flight&mdash;by the way, are you aware that
the Lucus Woerhmann is in dock at Naples with a leaking
boiler?'</p>

<p>Bartholomew started, as well he might, for nobody but himself
knew that the Lucus Woerhmann was the ship he had hoped to
overtake at Suez.</p>

<p>Manfred saw his bewilderment and smiled. 'I do not ask credit
for supernatural powers,' he said; 'frankly, it was the merest
guesswork, but you must abandon your trip. It is necessary for
our greater success that you should remain.'</p>

<p>Bartholomew bit his lips. This scheme did not completely fall
in with his plans. He affected a sudden geniality.</p>

<p>'Well, if I must, I must,' he said heartily, 'and since I
agree, may I ask whom I have the honour of addressing, and
further, since I am now your confidential agent, that I may see
the faces of my employers?'</p>

<p>He recognized the contempt in Manfred's laugh.</p>

<p>'You need no introduction to us,' said Manfred coldly, 'and
you will understand we do not intend taking you into our
confidence. Our agreement is that we share your confidence, not
that you shall share ours.'</p>

<p>'I must know something,' said Bartholomew doggedly. 'What am I
to do? Where am I to report! How shall I be paid?'</p>

<p>'You will be paid when your work is completed.' Manfred
reached out his hand toward a little table that stood within his
reach.</p>

<p>Instantly the room was plunged into darkness.</p>

<p>The traitor sprang back, fearing he knew not what.</p>

<p>'Come&mdash;do not be afraid,' said a voice.</p>

<p>'What does this mean?' cried Bartholomew, and stepped
forward.</p>

<p>He felt the floor beneath him yield and tried to spring
backwards, but already he had lost his balance, and with a scream
of terror he felt himself falling, falling...</p>

<p>'Here, wake up!'</p>

<p>Somebody was shaking his arm and he was conscious of an icy
coldness and a gusty raw wind that buffeted his face.</p>

<p>He shivered and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>First of all he saw an iron camel with a load on its back;
then he realized dimly that it was the ornamental support of a
garden seat; then he saw a dull grey parapet of grimy stone. He
was sitting on a seat on the Thames Embankment, and a policeman
was shaking him, not ungently, to wakefulness.</p>

<p>'Come along, sir&mdash;this won't do, ye know.'</p>

<p>He staggered to his feet unsteadily. He was wearing a fur coat
that was not his.</p>

<p>'How did I come here?' he asked in a dull voice.</p>

<p>The policeman laughed good humouredly.</p>

<p>'Ah, that's more than I can tell you&mdash;you weren't here
ten minutes ago, that I'll swear.'</p>

<p>Bartholomew put his hand in his pocket and found some
money.</p>

<p>'Call me a taxi,' he said shakily and one was found.</p>

<p>He left the policeman perfectly satisfied with the result of
his morning's work and drove home to his lodgings. By what
extraordinary means had he reached the Embankment? He remembered
the Four, he remembered the suddenly darkened room, he remembered
falling&mdash;Perhaps he lost consciousness, yet he could not
have been injured by his fall. He had a faint recollection of
somebody telling him to breathe and of inhaling a sweet sickly
vapour &mdash;and that was all.</p>

<p>The coat was not his. He thrust his hands into both pockets
and found a letter. Did he but know it was of the peculiar
texture that had made the greenish-grey paper of the Four Just
Men famous throughout Europe.</p>

<p>The letter was brief and to the point:</p>

<p>For faithful service, you will be rewarded; for treachery,
there will be no net to break your fall.</p>

<p>He shivered again. Then his impotence, his helplessness,
enraged him, and he swore softly and weakly.</p>

<p>He was ignorant of the locality in which the interview had
taken place. On his way thither he had tried in vain to follow
the direction the shuttered motor-car had taken.</p>

<p>By what method the Four would convey their instructions he had
no idea. He was quite satisfied that they would find a way.</p>

<p>He reached his flat with his head swimming from the effects of
the drug they had given him, and flung himself, dressed as he
was, upon his bed and slept. He slept well into the afternoon,
then rose stiff and irritable. A bath and a change refreshed him,
and he walked out to keep an appointment he had made.</p>

<p>On his way he remembered impatiently that there was a call to
the Council at five o'clock. It reminded him of his old rehearsal
days. Then he recollected that no place had been fixed for the
council meeting. He would find the quiet Francois in Leicester
Square, so he turned his steps in that direction.</p>

<p>Francois, patient, smiling, and as deferential as ever,
awaited him. 'The council was held at two o'clock,' he said, 'and
I am to tell you that we have decided on two projects.' He looked
left and right, with elaborated caution.</p>

<p>'There is at Gravesend'&mdash;he pronounced it 'Gwayvse-end'
&mdash;'a battleship that has put in for stores. It is the
Grondovitch. It will be fresh in your mind that the captain is
the nobleman Svardo&mdash;we have no reason to love him.'</p>

<p>'And the second?' asked Bartholomew.</p>

<p>Again Francois went through the pantomime that had so annoyed
his companion before.</p>

<p>'It is no less than the Bank,' he said triumphantly.</p>

<p>Bartholomew was aghast.</p>

<p>'The Bank&mdash;the Bank of England! Why, you're mad&mdash;you
have taken leave of your senses!'</p>

<p>Francois shrugged his shoulders tolerantly.</p>

<p>'It is the order,' he said; then, abruptly, 'Au revoir,' he
said, and, with his extravagant little bow, was gone.</p>

<p>If Bartholomew's need for cutting himself adrift from the Red
Hundred existed before, the necessity was multiplied now a
thousand times. Any lingering doubt he might have had, any remote
twinge of conscience at the part he was playing, these
vanished.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch, and hurried to his destination.</p>

<p>It was the Red Room of the Hotel Larboune that he sought.</p>

<p>He found a table and ordered a drink.</p>

<p>The waiter was unusually talkative.</p>

<p>He stood by the solitary table at which Bartholomew sat, and
chatted pleasantly and respectfully. This much the other patrons
of the establishment noticed idly, and wondered whether it was
racing or house property that the two had in common.</p>

<p>The waiter was talking.</p>

<p>'... I am inclined to disbelieve the story of the Grondovitch,
but the Embassy and the commander shall know&mdash;when do you
leave?'</p>

<p>'Just as soon as I can,' said Bartholomew.</p>

<p>The waiter nodded and flicked some cigarette ash from the
table with his napkin.</p>

<p>'And the Woman of Gratz?' he asked.</p>

<p>Bartholomew made a gesture of doubt.</p>

<p>'Why not,' said the waiter, looking thoughtfully out of the
window, 'why not take her with you?'</p>

<p>There had been the germ of such a thought in Bartholomew's
mind, but he had never given form to it&mdash;even to
himself.</p>

<p>'She is very beautiful, and, it occurred to me, not altogether
indifferent to your attractions&mdash;that kind of woman has a
penchant for your type, and frankly we would gladly see her out
of the way&mdash;or dead.'</p>

<p>M. Menshikov was by no means vindictive, but there was
obvious sincerity in his voice when he pronounced the last two
words. M. Menshikov had been right-hand man of the Grand Master
of the Secret Police for too many years to feel any qualms at the
project of removing an enemy to the system.</p>

<p>'I thought we had her once,' he said meditatively; 'they would
have flogged her in the fortress of St Peter and Paul, but I
stopped them. She was grateful I think, and almost human... but
it passed off.'</p>

<p>Bartholomew paid for his drink, and ostentatiously tipped the
obsequious man before him. He remembered as he did so that
Menshikov was reputedly a millionaire.</p>

<p>'Your change, m'sieur,' said Menshikov gravely, and he handed
back a few jingling coppers and two tightly folded banknotes for
a hundred pounds. He was a believer in the principle of 'pay as
you go' Bartholomew pocketed the money carelessly.</p>

<p>'Good day,' he said loudly.</p>

<p>'Au revoir, m'sieur, et bon voyage', said the waiter.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06">VI.&mdash;PRINCESS
REVOLUTIONARY</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE Woman of Gratz was very human. But to
Bartholomew she seemed a thing of ice, passionless, just a
beautiful woman who sat stiffly in a straight-backed chair,
regarding him with calm, questioning eyes. They were in her flat
in Bloomsbury on the evening of the day following his interview
with Menshikov. Her coolness chilled him, and strangled the very
passion of his speech, and what he said came haltingly, and
sounded lame and unconvincing.</p>

<p>'But why?' that was all she asked. Thrice he had paused
appealingly, hoping for encouragement, but her answer had been
the same.</p>

<p>He spoke incoherently, wildly. The fear of the Four on the one
hand and the dread of the Reds on the other, were getting on his
nerves.</p>

<p>He saw a chance of escape from both, freedom from the
four-walled control of these organizations, and before him the
wide expanse of a trackless wilderness, where the vengeance of
neither could follow.</p>

<p>Eden in sight&mdash;he pleaded for an Eve.</p>

<p>The very thought of the freedom ahead overcame the depression
her coldness laid upon him.</p>

<p>'Maria&mdash;don't you see? You are wasting your life doing
this man's work&mdash;this assassin's work. You were made for
love and for me!' He caught her hand and she did not withdraw it,
but the palm he pressed was unresponsive and the curious
searching eyes did not leave his face.</p>

<p>'But why?' she asked again. 'And how? I do not love you, I
shall never love any man&mdash;and there is the work for you and
the work for me. There is the cause and your oath. Your
comrades&mdash;'</p>

<p>He started up and flung away her hand. For a moment he stood
over her, glowering down at her upturned face.</p>

<p>'Work!&mdash;Comrades!' he grated with a laugh. 'D'ye think
I'm going to risk my precious neck any further?'</p>

<p>He did not hear the door open softly, nor the footfall of the
two men who entered.</p>

<p>'Are you blind as well as mad?' he went on brutally. 'Don't
you see that the thing is finished? The Four Just Men have us all
in the hollow of their hands! They've got us like that!' He
snapped his fingers contemptuously. 'They know
everything&mdash;even to the attempt that is to be made on the
Prince of the Escorials! Ha! that startles you&mdash;yet it is
true, every word I say&mdash;they know.'</p>

<p>'If it is true,' she said slowly, 'there has been a
traitor.'</p>

<p>He waved his hand carelessly, admitting and dismissing the
possibility.</p>

<p>'There are traitors always&mdash;when the pay for treachery is
good,' he said easily; 'but traitor or no traitor, London is too
hot for you and me.'</p>

<p>'For you,' corrected the girl.</p>

<p>'And for you,' he said savagely; he snatched up her hand
again. 'You've got to come&mdash;do you hear&mdash;you beautiful
snow woman&mdash;you've got to come with me!'</p>

<p>He drew her to him, but a hand grasped his arm, and he turned
to meet the face of Starque, livid and puckered, and creased with
silent anger.</p>

<p>Starque was prepared for the knife or for the pistol, but not
for the blow that caught him full in the face and sent him
staggering back to the wall.</p>

<p>He recovered himself quickly, and motioned to Francois, who
turned and locked the door.</p>

<p>'Stand away from that door!'</p>

<p>'Wait!'</p>

<p>Starque, breathing quickly, wiped the blood from his face with
the back of his hand.</p>

<p>'Wait,' he said in his guttural tone; 'before you go there is
a matter to be settled.'</p>

<p>'At any time, in any place,' said the Englishman.</p>

<p>'It is not the blow,' breathed Starque, 'that is nothing; it
is the matter of the Inner Council&mdash;traitor!'</p>

<p>He thrust out his chin as he hissed the last word.</p>

<p>Bartholomew had very little time to decide upon his course of
action. He was unarmed; but he knew instinctively that there
would be no shooting. It was the knife he had to fear and he
grasped the back of a chair. If he could keep them at a distance
he might reach the door and get safely away. He cursed his folly
that he had delayed making the coup that would have so
effectively laid Starque by the heels.</p>

<p>'You have betrayed us to the Four Just Men&mdash;but that we
might never have known, for the Four have no servants to talk.
But you sold us to the Embassy&mdash;and that was your undoing.'
He had recovered his calm.</p>

<p>'We sent you a message telling you of our intention to destroy
the Bank of England. The Bank was warned&mdash;by the Four. We
told you of the attempt to be made on the Grondovitch&mdash;the
captain was warned by the Embassy &mdash;you are doubly
convicted. No such attempts were ever contemplated. They were
invented for your particular benefit, and you fell into the
trap.'</p>

<p>Bartholomew took a fresh grip of the chair. He realized
vaguely that he was face to face with death, and for one second
he was seized with a wild panic.</p>

<p>'Last night,' Starque went on deliberately, 'the Council met
secretly, and your name was read from the list.' The Englishman's
mouth went dry.</p>

<p>'And the Council said with one voice... ' Starque paused to
look at the Woman of Gratz. Imperturbable she stood with folded
hands, neither approving nor dissenting. Momentarily
Bartholomew's eyes too sought her face&mdash;but he saw neither
pity nor condemnation. It was the face of Fate, inexorable,
unreasoning, inevitable.</p>

<p>'Death was the sentence,' said Starque in so soft a voice that
the man facing him could scarcely hear him. 'Death... '</p>

<p>With a lightning motion he raised his hand and threw the
knife...</p>

<p>'Damn you... ' whimpered the stricken man, and his helpless
hands groped at his chest... then he slid to his knees and
Francois struck precisely...</p>

<p>Again Starque looked at the woman.</p>

<p>'It is the law,' he stammered, but she made no reply.</p>

<p>Only her eyes sought the huddled figure on the floor and her
lips twitched.</p>

<p>'We must get away from here,' whispered Starque.</p>

<p>He was shaking a little, for this was new work for him. The
forces of jealousy and fear for his personal safety had caused
him to take upon himself the office that on other occasions he
left to lesser men.</p>

<p>'Who lives in the opposite flat?'</p>

<p>He had peeped through the door.</p>

<p>'A student&mdash;a chemist,' she replied in her calm, level
tone.</p>

<p>Starque flushed, for her voice sounded almost strident coming
after the whispered conference between his companion and
himself.</p>

<p>'Softly, softly,' he urged.</p>

<p>He stepped gingerly back to where the body was lying, made a
circuit about it, and pulled down the blind. He could not have
explained the instinct that made him do this. Then he came back
to the door and gently turned the handle, beckoning the others.
It seemed to him that the handle turned itself, or that somebody
on the other side was turning at the same time.</p>

<p>That this was so he discovered, for the door suddenly jerked
open, sending him staggering backward, and a man stood on the
threshold.</p>

<p>With the drawn blind, the room was in semi-darkness, and the
intruder, standing motionless in the doorway, could see nothing
but the shadowy figures of the inmates.</p>

<p>As he waited he was joined by three others, and he spoke
rapidly in a language that Starque, himself no mean linguist,
could not understand. One of his companions opened the door of
the student's room and brought out something that he handed to
the watcher on the threshold.</p>

<p>Then the man entered the room alone and closed the door behind
him, not quite close, for he had trailed what looked like a thick
cord behind him and this prevented the shutting of the door.</p>

<p>Starque found his voice.</p>

<p>'What do you want?' he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>'I want Bartholomew, who came into this room half an hour
ago,' replied the intruder.</p>

<p>'He has left,' said Starque, and in the darkness he felt at
his feet for the dead man&mdash;he needed the knife.</p>

<p>'That is a lie,' said the stranger coolly; 'neither he nor
you, Rudolph Starque, nor the Woman of Gratz, nor the murderer
Francois has left.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur knows too much,' said Starque evenly, and lurched
forward, swinging his knife.</p>

<p>'Keep your distance,' warned the stranger, and at that moment
Starque and the silent Francois sprang forward and struck...</p>

<p>The exquisite agony of the shock that met them paralysed them
for the moment. The sprayed threads of the 'live' wire the man
held before him like a shield jerked the knife from Starque's
hands, and he heard Francois groan as he fell.</p>

<p>'You are foolish,' said the voice again, 'and you, madame, do
not move, I beg&mdash;tell me what has become of
Bartholomew.'</p>

<p>A silence, then:</p>

<p>'He is dead,' said the Woman of Gratz.</p>

<p>She heard the man move.</p>

<p>'He was a traitor&mdash;so we killed him,' she continued
calmly enough. 'What will you do&mdash;you, who stand as a
self-constituted judge?'</p>

<p>He made no reply, and she heard the soft rustle of his fingers
on the wall.</p>

<p>'You are seeking the light&mdash;as we all seek it,' she said,
unmoved, and she switched on the light.</p>

<p>He saw her standing near the body of the man she had lured to
his death, scornful, defiant, and strangely aloof from the
sordidness of the tragedy she had all but instigated.</p>

<p>She saw a tanned man of thirty-five, with deep, grave eyes, a
broad forehead, and a trim, pointed beard. A man of inches, with
strength in every line of his fine figure, and strength in every
feature of his face.</p>

<p>She stared at him insolently, uncaring, but before the mastery
of his eyes, she lowered her lids.</p>

<p>It seemed the other actors in the drama were so inconsiderate
as to be unworthy of notice. The dead man in his grotesque
posture, the unconscious murderer at his feet, and Starque, dazed
and stunned, crouching by the wall.</p>

<p>'Here is the light you want,' she went on, 'not so easily do
we of the Red Hundred illuminate the gloom of despair and
oppression&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Spare me your speech-making,' said Manfred coldly, and the
scorn in his voice struck her like the lash of a whip. For the
first time the colour came to her face and her eyes lit with
anger.</p>

<p>'You have bad counsellors,' Manfred went on, 'you, who talk of
autocrats and corrupt kingship&mdash;what are you but a puppet
living on flattery? It is your whim that you should be regarded
as a conspirator&mdash;a Corday. And when you are acclaimed
Princess Revolutionary, it is satisfactory to your
vanity&mdash;more satisfactory than your title to be hailed
Princess Beautiful.'</p>

<p>He chose his words nicely.</p>

<p>'Yet men&mdash;such men as these,' he indicated Starque,
'think only of the Princess Beautiful&mdash;not the lady of the
Inspiring Platitudes; not the frail, heroic Patriot of the
Flaming Words, but the warm flesh and blood woman, lovable and
adorable.'</p>

<p>He spoke in German, and there were finer shades of meaning in
his speech than can be exactly or literally translated. He spoke
of a purpose, evenly and without emotion. He intended to wound,
and wound deeply, and he knew he had succeeded.</p>

<p>He saw the rapid rise and fall of her bosom as she strove to
regain control of herself, and he saw, too, the blood on her lips
where her sharp white teeth bit.</p>

<p>'I shall know you again,' she said with an intensity of
passion that made her voice tremble. 'I shall look for you and
find you, and be it the Princess Revolutionary or the Princess
Beautiful who brings about your punishment, be sure I shall
strike hard.'</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>'That is as it may be,' he said calmly; 'for the moment you
are powerless, if I willed it you would be powerless
forever&mdash;for the moment it is my wish that you should
go.'</p>

<p>He stepped aside and opened the door.</p>

<p>The magnetism in his eyes drew her forward.</p>

<p>'There is your road,' he said when she hesitated. She was
helpless; the humiliation was maddening.</p>

<p>'My friends&mdash;' she began, as she hesitated on the
threshold.</p>

<p>'Your friends will meet the fate that one day awaits you,' he
said calmly.</p>

<p>White with passion, she turned on him.</p>

<p>'You!&mdash;threaten me! a brave man indeed to threaten a
woman!'</p>

<p>She could have bitten her tongue at the slip she made. She as
a woman had appealed to him as a man! This was the greatest
humiliation of all.</p>

<p>'There is your road,' he said again, courteously but
uncompromisingly.</p>

<p>She was scarcely a foot from him, and she turned and faced
him, her lips parted and the black devil of hate in her eyes.</p>

<p>'One day&mdash;one day,' she gasped, 'I will repay you!' Then
she turned quickly and disappeared through the door, and Manfred
waited until her footsteps had died away before he stooped to the
half-conscious Starque and jerked him to his feet.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07">VII.&mdash;THE GOVERNMENT AND
MR. JESSEN</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN recording the events that followed the
reappearance of the Four Just Men, I have confined myself to
those which I know to have been the direct outcome of the Red
Hundred propaganda and the counter-activity of the Four Just
Men.</p>

<p>Thus I make no reference to the explosion at Woolwich Arsenal,
which was credited to the Red Hundred, knowing, as I do, that the
calamity was due to the carelessness of a workman. Nor to the
blowing up of the main in Oxford Street, which was a much more
simple explanation than the fantastic theories of the
<i>Megaphone</i> would have you imagine. This was not the first
time that a fused wire and a leaking gas main brought about the
upheaval of a public thoroughfare, and the elaborate plot with
which organized anarchy was credited was without existence.</p>

<p>I think the most conscientiously accurate history of the Red
Hundred movement is that set forth in the series of ten articles
contributed to the Morning Leader by Harold Ashton under the
title of 'Forty Days of Terrorism', and, whilst I think the
author frequently fails from lack of sympathy for the Four Just
Men to thoroughly appreciate the single-mindedness of this
extraordinary band of men, yet I shall always regard 'Forty Days
of Terrorism' as being the standard history of the movement, and
its failure.</p>

<p>On one point in the history alone I find myself in opposition
to Mr. Ashton, and that is the exact connection between the
discovery of the Carlby Mansion Tragedy, and the extraordinary
return of Mr. Jessen of 37 Presley Street.</p>

<p>It is perhaps indiscreet of me to refer at so early a stage to
this return of Jessen's, because whilst taking exception to the
theories put forward in 'Forty Days of Terrorism', I am not
prepared to go into the evidence on which I base my theories.</p>

<p>The popular story is that one morning Mr. Jessen walked out of
his house and demanded from the astonished milkman why he had
omitted to leave his morning supply. Remembering that the
disappearance of 'Long'&mdash;perhaps it would be less confusing
to call him the name by which he was known in Presley
Street&mdash;had created an extraordinary sensation; that
pictures of his house and the interior of his house had appeared
in all the newspapers; that the newspaper crime experts had
published columns upon columns of speculative theories, and that
37 Presley Street, had for some weeks been the Mecca of the
morbid minded, who, standing outside, stared the unpretentious
facade out of countenance for hours on end; you may imagine that
the milkman legend had the exact journalistic touch that would
appeal to a public whose minds had been trained by generations of
magazine-story writers to just such denouement as this.</p>

<p>The truth is that Mr. Long, upon coming to life, went
immediately to the Home Office and told his story to the Under
Secretary. He did not drive up in a taxi, nor was he lifted out
in a state of exhaustion as one newspaper had erroneously had it,
but he arrived on the top of a motor omnibus which passed the
door, and was ushered into the Presence almost at once. When Mr.
Long had told his story he was taken to the Home Secretary
himself, and the chief commissioner was sent for, and came
hurriedly from Scotland Yard, accompanied by Superintendent
Falmouth. All this is made clear in Mr. Ashton's book.</p>

<p>'For some extraordinary reason,' I quote the same authority,
'Long, or Jessen, seems by means of documents in his possession
to have explained to the satisfaction of the Home Secretary and
the Police Authorities his own position in the matter, and
moreover to have inspired the right hon. gentleman with these
mysterious documents, that Mr. Ridgeway, so far from accepting
the resignation that Jessen placed in his hands, reinstated him
in his position.'</p>

<p>As to how two of these documents came to Jessen or to the Four
Just Men, Mr. Ashton is very wisely silent, not attempting to
solve a mystery which puzzled both the Quai d'Orsay and
Petrograd.</p>

<p>For these two official forms, signed in the one case by the
French President and in the other with the sprawling signature of
Czar Nicholas, were supposed to be incorporated with other
official memoranda in well-guarded national archives.</p>

<p>It was subsequent to Mr. Jessen's visit to the Home Office
that the discovery of the Carlby Mansions Tragedy was made, and I
cannot do better than quote The Times, since that journal,
jealous of the appearance in its columns of any news of a
sensational character, reduced the intelligence to its most
constricted limits. Perhaps the <i>Megaphone</i> account might
make better reading, but the space at my disposal will not allow
of the inclusion in this book of the thirty-three columns of
reading matter, headlines, portraits, and diagrammatic
illustrations with which that enterprising journal served up
particulars of the grisly horror to its readers. Thus, The
Times:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">Shortly after one o'clock yesterday afternoon
and in consequence of information received, Superintendent
Falmouth, of the Criminal Investigation Department, accompanied
by Detective-Sergeants Boyle and Lawley, effected an entrance
into No. 69, Carlby Mansions, occupied by the Countess
Slienvitch, a young Russian lady of independent means. Lying on
the floor were the bodies of three men who have since been
identified as&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">Lauder Bartholomew, aged 33, late of the
Koondorp Mounted Rifles;</p>

<p class="quote">Rudolph Starque, aged 40, believed to be an
Austrian and a prominent revolutionary propagandist;</p>

<p class="quote">Henri Delaye Francois, aged 36, a Frenchman,
also believed to have been engaged in propaganda work.</p>

<p class="quote">The cause of death in the case of Bartholomew
seems to be evident, but with the other two men some doubt
exists, and the police, who preserve an attitude of rigid
reticence, will await the medical examination before making any
statement.</p>

<p class="quote">One unusual feature of the case is understood to
be contained in a letter found in the room accepting, on behalf
of an organization known as the Four Just Men, full
responsibility for the killing of the two foreigners, and
another, writes a correspondent, is the extraordinary structural
damage to the room itself. The tenant, the Countess Slienvitch,
had not, up to a late hour last night, been traced.</p>

<br>

<p>Superintendent Falmouth, standing in the centre of the room,
from which most traces of the tragedy had been removed, was
mainly concerned with the 'structural damage' that The Times so
lightly passed over.</p>

<p>At his feet yawned a great square hole, and beneath, in the
empty flat below, was a heap of plaster and laths, and the debris
of destruction.</p>

<p>'The curious thing is, and it shows how thorough these men
are,' explained the superintendent to his companion, 'that the
first thing we found when we got there was a twenty-pound note
pinned to the wall with a brief note in pencil saying that this
was to pay the owner of the property for the damage.'</p>

<p>It may be added that by the express desire of the young man at
his side he dispensed with all ceremony of speech.</p>

<p>Once or twice in speaking, he found himself on the verge of
saying, 'Your Highness', but the young man was so kindly, and so
quickly put the detective at his ease, that he overcame the
feeling of annoyance that the arrival of the distinguished
visitor with the letter from the commissioner had caused him, and
became amiable.</p>

<p>'Of course, I have an interest in all this,' said the young
man quietly; 'these people, for some reason, have decided I am
not fit to encumber the earth&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What have you done to the Red Hundred, sir?'</p>

<p>The young man laughed.</p>

<p>'Nothing. On the contrary,' he added with a whimsical smile,
'I have helped them.'</p>

<p>The detective remembered that this hereditary Prince of the
Escorial bore a reputation for eccentricity.</p>

<p>With a suddenness which was confusing, the Prince turned with
a smile on his lips.</p>

<p>'You are thinking of my dreadful reputation?'</p>

<p>'No, no!' disclaimed the embarrassed Mr. Falmouth.
'I&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes&mdash;I've done lots of things,' said the other with
a little laugh; 'it's in the blood&mdash;my illustrious
cousin&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I assure your Highness,' said Falmouth impressively, 'my
reflections were not&mdash;er&mdash;reflections on
yourself&mdash;there is a story that you have dabbled in
socialism&mdash;but that, of course&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Is perfectly true,' concluded the Prince calmly. He turned
his attention to the hole in the floor.</p>

<p>'Have you any theory?' he asked.</p>

<p>The detective nodded.</p>

<p>'It's more than a theory&mdash;it's knowledge&mdash;you see
we've seen Jessen, and the threads of the story are all in
hand.'</p>

<p>'What will you do?'</p>

<p>'Nothing,' said the detective stolidly; 'hush up the inquest
until we can lay the Four Just Men by the heels.'</p>

<p>'And the manner of killing?'</p>

<p>'That must be kept quiet,' replied Falmouth emphatically. This
conversation may furnish a clue as to the unprecedented conduct
of the police at the subsequent inquest.</p>

<p>In the little coroner's court there was accommodation for
three pressmen and some fifty of the general public. Without
desiring in any way to cast suspicion upon the cleanest police
force in the world, I can only state that the jury were
remarkably well disciplined, that the general public found the
body of the court so densely packed with broad-shouldered men
that they were unable to obtain admission. As to the press, the
confidential circular had done its work, and the three shining
lights of journalism that occupied the reporters' desk were
careful to carry out instructions.</p>

<p>The proceedings lasted a very short time, a verdict, '... some
person or persons unknown,' was recorded, and another London
mystery was added (I quote from the <i>Evening News</i>) to the
already alarming and formidable list of unpunished crimes.</p>

<p>Charles Garrett was one of the three journalists admitted to
the inquest, and after it was all over he confronted
Falmouth.</p>

<p>'Look here, Falmouth,' he said pugnaciously, 'what's the
racket?' Falmouth, having reason to know, and to an extent stand
in awe of, the little man, waggled his head darkly.</p>

<p>'Oh, rot!' said Charles rudely, 'don't be so disgustingly
mysterious &mdash;why aren't we allowed to say these chaps
died&mdash;?'</p>

<p>'Have you seen Jessen?' asked the detective.</p>

<p>'I have,' said Charles bitterly, 'and after what I've done for
that man; after I've put his big feet on the rungs of
culture&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Wouldn't he speak?' asked Falmouth innocently.</p>

<p>'He was as close,' said Charles sadly, 'as the inside washer
of a vacuum pump.'</p>

<p>'H'm!' the detective was considering. Sooner or later the
connection must occur to Charles, and he was the only man who
would be likely to surprise Jessen's secret. Better that the
journalist should know now.</p>

<p>'If I were you,' said Falmouth quietly, 'I shouldn't worry
Jessen; you know what he is, and in what capacity he serves the
Government. Come along with me.'</p>

<p>He did not speak a word in reply to the questions Charles put
until they passed through the showy portals of Carlby Mansions
and a lift had deposited them at the door of the flat.</p>

<p>Falmouth opened the door with a key, and Charles went into the
flat at his heels.</p>

<p>He saw the hole in the floor.</p>

<p>'This wasn't mentioned at the inquest,' he said; 'but what's
this to do with Jessen?'</p>

<p>He looked up at the detective in perplexity, then a light
broke upon him and he whistled.</p>

<p>'Well, I'm&mdash;' he said, then he added softly&mdash;'But
what does the Government say to this?'</p>

<p>'The Government,' said Falmouth in his best official manner,
smoothing the nap of his hat the while&mdash;'the Government
regard the circumstances as unusual, but they have accepted the
situation with great philosophy.'</p>

<p>That night Mr. Long (or Jessen) reappeared at the Guild as
though nothing whatever had happened, and addressed his audience
for half an hour on the subject of 'Do burglars make good
caretakers?'</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08">VIII.&mdash;AN INCIDENT IN THE
FIGHT</a></h2>

<p class="first">FROM what secret place in the metropolis the
Woman of Gratz reorganized her forces we shall never know; whence
came her strength of purpose and her unbounded energy we can
guess. With Starque's death she became virtually and actually the
leader of the Red Hundred, and from every corner of Europe came
reinforcements of men and money to strengthen her hand and to
re-establish the shaking prestige of the most powerful association
that Anarchism had ever known.</p>

<p>Great Britain had ever been immune from the active operations
of the anarchist. It had been the sanctuary of the revolutionary
for centuries, and Anarchism had hesitated to jeopardize the
security of refugees by carrying on its propaganda on British
soil. That the extremists of the movement had chafed under the
restriction is well known, and when the Woman of Gratz openly
declared war on England, she was acclaimed enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Then followed perhaps the most extraordinary duels that the
world had ever seen. Two powerful bodies, both outside the pale
of the law, fought rapidly, mercilessly, asking no quarter and
giving none. And the eerie thing about it all was, that no man
saw the agents of either of the combatants. It was as though two
spirit forces were engaged in some titanic combat. The police
were almost helpless. The fight against the Red Hundred was
carried on, almost single-handedly, by the Four Just Men, or, to
give them the title with which they signed their famous
proclamation, 'The Council of Justice'. .</p>

<p>Since the days of the Fenian scare, London had never lived
under the terror that the Red Hundred inspired. Never a day
passed but preparations for some outrage were discovered, the
most appalling of which was the attempt on the Tube Railway. If I
refer to them as 'attempts', and if the repetition of that word
wearies the reader, it is because, thanks to the extraordinary
vigilance of the Council of Justice, they were no more.</p>

<p>'This sort of thing cannot go on,' said the Home Secretary
petulantly at a meeting of the heads of the police. 'Here we have
admittedly the finest police force in the world, and we must
needs be under obligation to men for whom warrants exist on a
charge of murder!'</p>

<p>The chief commissioner was sufficiently harassed, and was
inclined to resent the criticism in the minister's voice.</p>

<p>'We've done everything that can be done, sir,' he said
shortly; 'if you think my resignation would help you out of the
difficulty&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Now for heaven's sake, don't be a fool,' pleaded the Home
Secretary, in his best unparliamentary manner. 'Cannot you
see&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I can see that no harm has been done so far,' said the
commissioner doggedly; then he burst forth:</p>

<p>'Look here, sir! our people have very often to employ
characters a jolly sight worse than the Four Just Men&mdash;"if
we don't employ them we exploit them. Mean little sneak-thieves,
"narks" they call 'em, old lags, burglars&mdash;"and once or
twice something worse. We are here to protect the public; so long
as the public is being protected, nobody can kick&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But it is not you who are protecting the public&mdash;you get
your information&mdash;'</p>

<p>'From the Council of Justice, that is so; but where it comes
from doesn't matter. Now, listen to me, sir.'</p>

<p>He was very earnest and emphasized his remarks with little
raps on the desk.</p>

<p>'Get the Prince of the Escorial out of the country,' he said
seriously. 'I've got information that the Reds are after his
blood. No, I haven't been warned by the Just Men, that's the
queer part about it. I've got it straight from a man who's
selling me information. I shall see him tonight if they haven't
butchered him.'</p>

<p>'But the Prince is our guest.'</p>

<p>'He's been here too long,' said the practical and
unsentimental commissioner; 'let him go back to Spain&mdash;he's
to be married in a month; let him go home and buy his trousseau
or whatever he buys.'</p>

<p>'Is that a confession that you cannot safeguard him?'</p>

<p>The commissioner looked vexed.</p>

<p>'I could safeguard a child of six or a staid gentleman of
sixty, but I cannot be responsible for a young man who insists on
seeing London without a guide, who takes solitary motor-car
drives, and refuses to give us any information beforehand as to
his plans for the day&mdash;or if he does, breaks them!'</p>

<p>The minister was pacing the apartment with his head bent in
thought.</p>

<p>'As to the Prince of the Escorial,' he said presently, 'advice
has already been conveyed to his Highness&mdash;from the highest
quarter&mdash;to make his departure at an early date. Tonight,
indeed, is his last night in London.'</p>

<p>The Commissioner of Police made an extravagant demonstration
of relief.</p>

<p>'He's going to the Auditorium tonight,' he said, rising. He
spoke a little pityingly, and, indeed, the Auditorium, although a
very first-class music hall, had a slight reputation. 'I shall
have a dozen men in the house and we'll have his motor-car at the
stage door at the end of the show.'</p>

<p>That night his Highness arrived promptly at eight o'clock and
stood chatting pleasantly with the bare-headed manager in the
vestibule. Then he went alone to his box and sat down in the
shadow of the red velvet curtain.</p>

<p>Punctually at eight there arrived two other gentlemen, also in
evening dress. Antonio Selleni was one and Karl Ollmanns was the
other. They were both young men, and before they left the
motor-car they completed their arrangement.</p>

<p>'You will occupy the box on the opposite side, but I will
endeavour to enter the box. If I succeed&mdash;it will be
finished. The knife is best,' there was pride in the Italian's
tone.</p>

<p>'If I cannot reach him the honour will be yours.' He had the
stilted manner of the young Latin. The other man grunted. He
replied in halting French.</p>

<p>'Once I shot an egg from between fingers&mdash;so,' he
said.</p>

<p>They made their entry separately.</p>

<p>In the manager's office, Superintendent Falmouth relieved the
tedium of waiting by reading the advertisements in an evening
newspaper.</p>

<p>To him came the manager with a message that under no
circumstances was his Highness in Box A to be disturbed until the
conclusion of the performance.</p>

<p>In the meantime Signor Selleni made a cautious way to Box A.
He found the road clear, turned the handle softly, and stepped
quickly into the dark interior of the box.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Falmouth stood at the back of the dress
circle issuing instructions to a subordinate.</p>

<p>'Have a couple of men at the stage door&mdash;my God!'</p>

<p>Over the soft music, above the hum of voices, a shot rang out
and a woman screamed. From the box opposite the Prince's a thin
swirl of smoke floated.</p>

<p>Karl Ollmanns, tired of waiting, had fired at the motionless
figure sitting in the shadow of the curtain. Then he walked
calmly out of the box into the arms of two breathless
detectives.</p>

<p>'A doctor!' shouted Falmouth as he ran. The door of the Box A
was locked, but he broke it open.</p>

<p>A man lay on the floor of the box very still and strangely
stiff.</p>

<p>'Why, what&mdash;!' began the detective, for the dead man was
bound hand and foot.</p>

<p>There was already a crowd at the door of the box, and he heard
an authoritative voice demand admittance.</p>

<p>He looked over his shoulder to meet the eye of the
commissioner.</p>

<p>'They've killed him, sir,' he said bitterly.</p>

<p>'Whom?' asked the commissioner in perplexity.</p>

<p>'His Highness.'</p>

<p>'His Highness!' the commissioner's eyebrows rose in genuine
astonishment. 'Why, the Prince left Charing Cross for the
Continent half an hour ago!'</p>

<p>The detective gasped.</p>

<p>'Then who in the name of Fate is this?'</p>

<p>It was M. Menshikov, who had come in with the commissioner,
who answered.</p>

<p>'Antonio Selleni, an anarchist of Milan,' he reported.</p>

<p>Carlos Ferdinand Bourbon, Prince of the Escorial, Duke of
Buda-Gratz, and heir to three thrones, was married, and his many
august cousins scattered throughout Europe had a sense of
heartfelt relief.</p>

<p>A prince with admittedly advanced views, an idealist, with
Utopian schemes for the regeneration of mankind, and, coming down
to the mundane practical side of life, a reckless motor-car
driver, an outrageously daring horseman, and possessed of the
indifference to public opinion which is equally the equipment of
your fool and your truly great man, his marriage had been looked
forward to throughout the courts of Europe in the light of an
international achievement.</p>

<p>Said his Imperial Majesty of Central Europe to the grizzled
chancellor:</p>

<p>'Te Deums&mdash;you understand, von Hedlitz? In every
church.'</p>

<p>'It is a great relief,' said the chancellor, wagging his head
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'Relief!' the Emperor stretched himself as though the relief
were physical, 'that young man owes me two years of life. You
heard of the London essay?'</p>

<p>The chancellor had heard&mdash;indeed, he had heard three or
four times &mdash;but he was a polite chancellor and listened
attentively. His Majesty had the true story-telling faculty, and
elaborated the introduction.</p>

<p>'... if I am to believe his Highness, he was sitting quietly
in his box when the Italian entered. He saw the knife in his hand
and half rose to grapple with the intruder. Suddenly, from
nowhere in particular, sprang three men, who had the assassin on
the floor bound and gagged. You would have thought our Carlos
Ferdinand would have made an outcry! But not he! He sat stock
still, dividing his attention between the stage and the prostrate
man and the leader of this mysterious band of rescuers.'</p>

<p>'The Four Just Men!' put in the chancellor.</p>

<p>'Three, so far as I can gather,' corrected the imperial
story-teller. 'Well, it would appear that this leader, in quite a
logical calm, matter-of-fact way, suggested that the prince
should leave quietly; that his motor-car was at the stage door,
that a saloon had been reserved at Charing Cross, a cabin at
Dover, and a special train at Calais.'</p>

<p>His Majesty had a trick of rubbing his knee when anything
amused him, and this he did now.</p>

<p>'Carl obeyed like a child&mdash;which seems the remarkably
strange point about the whole proceedings&mdash;the captured
anarchist was trussed and bound and sat on the chair, and left to
his own unpleasant thoughts.'</p>

<p>'And killed,' said the chancellor.</p>

<p>'No, not killed,' corrected the Emperor. 'Part of the story I
tell you is his&mdash;he told it to the police at the
hospital&mdash;no, no, not killed&mdash;his friend was not the
marksman he thought.'</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09">IX.&mdash;THE FOUR VERSUS THE
HUNDRED</a></h2>

<p class="first">SOME workmen, returning home of an evening and
taking a short cut through a field two miles from Catford, saw a
man hanging from a tree.</p>

<p>They ran across and found a fashionably dressed gentleman of
foreign appearance. One of the labourers cut the rope with his
knife, but the man was dead when they cut him down. Beneath the
tree was a black bag, to which somebody had affixed a label
bearing the warning, 'Do not touch&mdash;this bag contains
explosives: inform the police.' More remarkable still was the
luggage label tied to the lapel of the dead man's coat. It ran:
'This is Franz Kitsinger, convicted at Prague in 1904, for
throwing a bomb: escaped from prison March 17, 1905, was one of
the three men responsible for the attempt on the Tower Bridge
today. Executed by order of The Council of Justice.'</p>

<p>'It's a humiliating confession,' said the chief commissioner
when they brought the news to him, 'but the presence of these men
takes a load off my mind.'</p>

<p>But the Red Hundred were grimly persistent.</p>

<p>That night a man, smoking a cigar, strolled aimlessly past the
policeman on point duty at the corner of Kensington Park Gardens,
and walked casually into Ladbroke Square. He strolled on, turned
a corner and, crossing a road, he came to where one great garden
served for a double row of middle-class houses. The backs of
these houses opened on to the square. He looked round and, seeing
the coast clear, he clambered over the iron railings and dropped
into the big pleasure ground, holding very carefully an object
that bulged in his pocket.</p>

<p>He took a leisurely view of the houses before he decided on
the victim. The blinds of this particular house were up and the
French windows of the dining-room were open, and he could see the
laughing group of young people about the table. There was a
birthday party or something of the sort in progress, for there
was a great parade of Parthian caps and paper sunbonnets.</p>

<p>The man was evidently satisfied with the possibilities for
tragedy, and he took a pace nearer...</p>

<p>Two strong arms were about him, arms with muscles like cords
of steel.</p>

<p>'Not that way, my friend,' whispered a voice in his ear...</p>

<p>The man showed his teeth in a dreadful grin.</p>

<p>The sergeant on duty at Notting Hill Gate Station received a
note at the hands of a grimy urchin, who for days afterwards
maintained a position of enviable notoriety.</p>

<p>'A gentleman told me to bring this,' he said.</p>

<p>The sergeant looked at the small boy sternly and asked him if
he ever washed his face. Then he read the letter:</p>

<p>'The second man of the three concerned in the attempt to blow
up the Tower Bridge will be found in the garden of Maidham
Crescent, under the laurel bushes, opposite No. 72.'</p>

<p>It was signed 'The Council of Justice'.</p>

<p>The commissioner was sitting over his coffee at the Ritz, when
they brought him the news. Falmouth was a deferential guest, and
the chief passed him the note without comment.</p>

<p>'This is going to settle the Red Hundred,' said Falmouth.
'These people are fighting them with their own
weapons&mdash;assassination with assassination, terror with
terror. Where do we come in?'</p>

<p>'We come in at the end,' said the commissioner, choosing his
words with great niceness, 'to clean up the mess, and take any
scraps of credit that are going'&mdash;he paused and shook his
head. 'I hope&mdash;I should be sorry&mdash;' he began.</p>

<p>'So should I,' said the detective sincerely, for he knew that
his chief was concerned for the ultimate safety of the men whose
arrest it was his duty to effect. The commissioner's brows were
wrinkled thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'Two,' he said musingly; 'now, how on earth do the Four Just
Men know the number in this&mdash;and how did they track them
down&mdash;and who is the third?&mdash;heavens! one could go on
asking questions the whole of the night!'</p>

<p>On one point the Commissioner might have been informed earlier
in the evening&mdash;he was not told until three o'clock the next
morning. The third man was Von Dunop. Ignorant of the fate of his
fellow-Terrorists, he sallied forth to complete the day
notably.</p>

<p>The crowd at a theatre door started a train of thought, but he
rejected that outlet to ambition. It was too public, and the
chance of escape was nil. These British audiences did not lose
their heads so quickly; they refused to be confounded by noise
and smoke, and a writhing figure here and there. Von Dunop was no
exponent of the Glory of Death school. He greatly desired glory,
but the smaller the risk, the greater the glory. This was his
code.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment outside the Hotel Ritz. A party of
diners were leaving, and motor-cars were being steered up to
carry these accursed plutocrats to the theatre. One
soldierly-looking gentleman, with a grey moustache, and attended
by a quiet, observant, clean-shaven man, interested the
anarchist. He and the soldier exchanged glances.</p>

<p>'Who the dickens was that?' asked the commissioner as he
stepped into the taxi. 'I seem to know his face.'</p>

<p>'I have seen him before,' said Falmouth. 'I won't go with you,
sir&mdash;I've a little business to do in this part of the
world.'</p>

<p>Thereafter Von Dunop was not permitted to enjoy his walk in
solitude, for, unknown to him, a man 'picked him up' and followed
him throughout the evening. And as the hour grew later, that one
man became two, at eleven o'clock he became three, and at quarter
to twelve, when Von Dunop had finally fixed upon the scene and
scope of his exploit, he turned from Park Lane into Brook Street
to discover, to his annoyance, quite a number of people within
call. Yet he suspected nothing. He did not suspect the night
wanderer mouching along the curb with downcast eyes, seeking the
gutter for the stray cigar end; nor the two loudly talking men in
suits of violet check who wrangled as they walked concerning the
relative merits of the favourites for the Derby; nor the
commissionaire trudging home with his bag in his hand and a pipe
in his mouth, nor the clean-shaven man in evening dress.</p>

<p>The Home Secretary had a house in Berkeley Square. Von Dunop
knew the number very well. He slackened pace to allow the man in
evening dress to pass. The slow-moving taxi that was fifty yards
away he must risk. This taxi had been his constant attendant
during the last hour, but he did not know it.</p>

<p>He dipped his hand into his overcoat pocket and drew forth the
machine. It was one of Culveri's masterpieces and, to an extent,
experimental&mdash;that much the master had warned him in a
letter that bore the date-mark 'Riga'. He felt with his thumb for
the tiny key that 'set' the machine and pushed it.</p>

<p>Then he slipped into the doorway of No. 196 and placed the
bomb. It was done in a second, and so far as he could tell no man
had seen him leave the pathway and he was back again on the
sidewalk very quickly. But as he stepped back, he heard a shout
and a man darted across the road, calling on him to surrender.
From the left two men were running, and he saw the man in evening
dress blowing a whistle.</p>

<p>He was caught; he knew it. There was a chance of
escape&mdash;the other end of the street was clear&mdash;he
turned and ran like the wind. He could hear his pursuers
pattering along behind him. His ear, alert to every phase of the
chase, heard one pair of feet check and spring up the steps of
196. He glanced round. They were gaining on him, and he turned
suddenly and fired three times. Somebody fell; he saw that much.
Then right ahead of him a tall policeman sprang from the shadows
and clasped him round the waist.</p>

<p>'Hold that man!' shouted Falmouth, running up. Blowing hard
came the night wanderer, a ragged object but skilful, and he had
Von Dunop handcuffed in a trice.</p>

<p>It was he who noticed the limpness of the prisoner.</p>

<p>'Hullo!' he said, then held out his hand. 'Show a light
here.'</p>

<p>There were half a dozen policemen and the inevitable crowd on
the spot by now, and the rays of the bull's-eye focused on the
detective's hand. It was red with blood. Falmouth seized a
lantern and flashed it on the man's face.</p>

<p>There was no need to look farther. He was dead,&mdash;dead
with the inevitable label affixed to the handle of the knife that
killed him.</p>

<p>Falmouth rapped out an oath.</p>

<p>'It is incredible; it is impossible! he was running till the
constable caught him, and he has not been out of our hands! Where
is the officer who held him?'</p>

<p>Nobody answered, certainly not the tall policeman, who was at
that moment being driven eastward, making a rapid change into the
conventional evening costume of an English gentleman.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10">X.&mdash;THE TRIAL</a></h2>

<p class="first">TO fathom the mind of the Woman of Gratz is no
easy task, and one not to be lightly undertaken. Remembering her
obscure beginning, the bare-legged child drinking in
revolutionary talk in the Transylvanian kitchen, and the
development of her intellect along unconventional
lines&mdash;remembering, also, that early in life she made
acquaintance with the extreme problems of life and death in their
least attractive forms, and that the proportion of things had
been grossly distorted by her teachers, you may arrive at a point
where your vacillating judgement hesitates between blame and
pity.</p>

<p>I would believe that the power of introspection had no real
place in her mental equipment, else how can we explain her
attitude towards the man whom she had once defied and reconcile
those outbursts of hers wherein she called for his death, for his
terrible punishment, wherein, too, she allowed herself the rare
luxury of unrestrained speech, how can we reconcile these
tantrums with the fact that this man's voice filled her thoughts
day and night, the recollection of this man's eyes through his
mask followed her every movement, till the image of him became an
obsession?</p>

<p>It may be that I have no knowledge of women and their ways
(there is no subtle smugness in the doubt I express) and that her
inconsistency was general to her sex. It must not be imagined
that she had spared either trouble or money to secure the
extermination of her enemies, and the enemies of the Red Hundred.
She had described them, as well as she could, after her first
meeting, and the sketches made under her instruction had been
circulated by the officers of the Reds.</p>

<p>Sitting near the window of her house, she mused, lulled by the
ceaseless hum of traffic in the street below, and half
dozing.</p>

<p>The turning of the door-handle woke her from her dreams.</p>

<p>It was Schmidt, the unspeakable Schmidt, all perspiration and
excitement. His round coarse face glowed with it, and he could
scarcely bring his voice to tell the news.</p>

<p>'We have him! we have him!' he cried in glee, and snapped his
fingers. 'Oh, the good news!&mdash;I am the first! Nobody has
been, Little Friend? I have run and have taken taxis&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You have&mdash;whom?' she asked.</p>

<p>'The man&mdash;one of the men' he said, 'who killed Starque
and Francois, and&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Which&mdash;which man?' she said harshly.</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a discoloured
sketch.</p>

<p>'Oh!' she said, it could not be the man whom she had defied,
'Why, why?' she asked stormily, 'Why only this man? Why not the
others&mdash;why not the leader?&mdash;have they caught him and
lost him?'</p>

<p>Chagrin and astonishment sat on Schmidt's round face. His
disappointment was almost comic.</p>

<p>'But, Little Mother!' he said, crestfallen and bewildered,
'this is one &mdash;we did not hope even for one and&mdash;'</p>

<p>The storm passed over.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' she said wearily, 'one&mdash;even one is good.
They shall learn that the Red Hundred can still strike&mdash;this
leader shall know &mdash;This man shall have a death,' she said,
looking at Schmidt 'worthy of his importance. Tell me how he was
captured.'</p>

<p>'It was the picture,' said the eager Schmidt, 'the picture you
had drawn. One of our comrades thought he recognized him and
followed him to his house.'</p>

<p>'He shall be tried&mdash;tonight,' and she spent the day
anticipating her triumph.</p>

<p>Conspirators do not always choose dark arches for their
plottings. The Red Hundred especially were notorious for the
likeliness of their rendezvous. They went to nature for a
precedent, and as she endows the tiger with stripes that are
undistinguishable from the jungle grass, so the Red Hundred would
choose for their meetings such a place where meetings were
usually held.</p>

<p>It was in the Lodge Room of the Pride of Millwall,
AOSA&mdash;which may be amplified as the Associated Order of the
Sons of Abstinence&mdash;that the trial took place. The financial
position of the Pride of Millwall was not strong. An unusual
epidemic of temperate seafaring men had called the Lodge into
being, the influx of capital from eccentric bequests had built
the tiny hall, and since the fiasco attending the first meeting
of the League of London, much of its public business had been
skilfully conducted in these riverside premises. It had been
raided by the police during the days of terror, but nothing of an
incriminating character had been discovered. Because of the
success with which the open policy had been pursued the Woman of
Gratz preferred to take the risk of an open trial in a hall
liable to police raid.</p>

<p>The man must be so guarded that escape was impossible.
Messengers sped in every direction to carry out her instruction.
There was a rapid summoning of leaders of the movement, the
choice of the place of trial, the preparation for a ceremony
which was governed by well-established precedent, and the
arrangement of the properties which played so effective a part in
the trials of the Hundred.</p>

<p>In the black-draped chamber of trial the Woman of Gratz found
a full company. Maliscrivona, Tchezki, Vellantini, De Romans, to
name a few who were there sitting altogether side by side on the
low forms, and they buzzed a welcome as she walked into the room
and took her seat at the higher place. She glanced round the
faces, bestowing a nod here and a glance of recognition there.
She remembered the last time she had made an appearance before
the rank and file of the movement. She missed many faces that had
turned to her in those days: Starque, Francois,
Kitsinger&mdash;dead at the hands of the Four Just Men. It fitted
her mood to remember that tonight she would judge one who had at
least helped in the slaying of Starque.</p>

<p>Abruptly she rose. Lately she had had few opportunities for
the display of that oratory which was once her sole title to
consideration in the councils of the Red Hundred. Her powers of
organization had come to be respected later. She felt the want of
practice as she began speaking. She found herself hesitating for
words, and once she felt her illustrations were crude. But she
gathered confidence as she proceeded and she felt the responsive
thrill of a fascinated audience.</p>

<p>It was the story of the campaign that she told. Much of it we
know; the story from the point of view of the Reds may be
guessed. She finished her speech by recounting the capture of the
enemy.</p>

<p>'Tonight we aim a blow at these enemies of progress; if they
have been merciless, let us show them that the Red Hundred is not
to be outdone in ferocity. As they struck, so let us
strike&mdash;and, in striking, read a lesson to the men who
killed our comrades, that they, nor the world, will ever
forget.'</p>

<p>There was no cheering as she finished&mdash;that had been the
order &mdash;but a hum of words as they flung their tributes of
words at her feet &mdash;a ruck of incoherent phrases of praise
and adoration.</p>

<p>Then two men led in the prisoner.</p>

<p>He was calm and interested, throwing out his square chin
resolutely when the first words of the charge were called and
twiddling the fingers of his bound hands absently.</p>

<p>He met the scowling faces turned to him serenely, but as they
proceeded with the indictment, he grew attentive, bending his
head to catch the words.</p>

<p>Once he interrupted.</p>

<p>'I cannot quite understand that,' he said in fluent Russian,
'my knowledge of German is limited.'</p>

<p>'What is your nationality?' demanded the woman.</p>

<p>'English,' he replied.</p>

<p>'Do you speak French?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I am learning,' he said naively, and smiled.</p>

<p>'You speak Russian,' she said. Her conversation was carried on
in that tongue.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said simply; 'I was there for many years.'</p>

<p>After this, the sum of his transgressions were pronounced in a
language he understood. Once or twice as the reader
proceeded&mdash;it was Ivan Oranvitch who read&mdash;the man
smiled.</p>

<p>The Woman of Gratz recognized him instantly as the fourth of
the party that gathered about her door the day Bartholomew was
murdered. Formally she asked him what he had to say before he was
condemned.</p>

<p>He smiled again.</p>

<p>'I am not one of the Four Just Men,' he said; 'whoever says I
am&mdash;lies.'</p>

<p>'And is that all you have to say?' she asked scornfully.</p>

<p>'That is all,' was his calm reply.</p>

<p>'Do you deny that you helped slay our comrade Starque?'</p>

<p>'I do not deny it,' he said easily, 'I did not help&mdash;I
killed him.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' the exclamation came simultaneously from every
throat.</p>

<p>'Do you deny that you have killed many of the Red
Hundred?'</p>

<p>He paused before he answered.</p>

<p>'As to the Red Hundred&mdash;I do not know; but I have killed
many people.' He spoke with the grave air of a man filled with a
sense of responsibility, and again the exclamatory hum ran
through the hall. Yet, the Woman of Gratz had a growing sense of
unrest in spite of the success of the examination.</p>

<p>'You have said you were in Russia&mdash;did men fall to your
hand there?'</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>'And in England?'</p>

<p>'Also in England,' he said.</p>

<p>'What is your name?' she asked. By an oversight it was a
question she had not put before.</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>'Does it matter?' he asked. A thought struck her. In the hall
she had seen Magnus the Jew. He had lived for many years in
England, and she beckoned him.</p>

<p>'Of what class is this man?' she asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>'Of the lower orders,' he replied; 'it is astounding&mdash;did
you not notice when&mdash;no, you did not see his capture. But he
spoke like a man of the streets, dropping his aspirates.'</p>

<p>He saw she looked puzzled and explained.</p>

<p>'It is a trick of the order&mdash;just as the Moujik says... '
he treated her to a specimen of colloquial Russian.</p>

<p>'What is your name?' she asked again.</p>

<p>He looked at her slyly.</p>

<p>'In Russia they called me Father Kopab... '</p>

<p>The majority of those who were present were Russian, and at
the word they sprang to their feet, shrinking back with ashen
faces, as though they feared contact with the man who stood bound
and helpless in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>The Woman of Gratz had risen with the rest. Her lips quivered
and her wide open eyes spoke her momentary terror.</p>

<p>'I killed Starque,' he went on, 'by authority. Francois also.
Some day' &mdash;he looked leisurely about the room&mdash;'I
shall also&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Stop!' she cried, and then:</p>

<p>'Release him,' she said, and, wonderingly, Schmidt cut the
bonds that bound him. He stretched himself.</p>

<p>'When you took me,' he said, 'I had a book; you will
understand that here in England I find&mdash;forgetfulness in
books&mdash;and I, who have seen so much suffering and want
caused through departure from the law, am striving as hard for
the regeneration of mankind as you&mdash;but differently.'</p>

<p>Somebody handed him a book.</p>

<p>He looked at it, nodded, and slipped it into his pocket.</p>

<p>'Farewell,' he said as he turned to the open door.</p>

<p>'In God's name!' said the Woman of Gratz, trembling, 'go in
peace, Little Father.'</p>

<p>And the man Jessen, sometime headsman to the Supreme Council,
and latterly public executioner of England, walked out, no man
barring his exit.</p>

<p>The power of the Red Hundred was broken. This much Falmouth
knew. He kept an ever-vigilant band of men on duty at the great
termini of London, and to these were attached the members of a
dozen secret police forces of Europe. Day by day, there was the
same report to make. Such and such a man, whose very presence in
London had been unsuspected, had left via Harwich. So-and-so,
surprisingly sprung from nowhere, had gone by the eleven o'clock
train from Victoria; by the Hull and Stockholm route twenty had
gone in one day, and there were others who made Liverpool,
Glasgow, and Newcastle their port of embarkation.</p>

<p>I think that it was only then that Scotland Yard realized the
strength of the force that had lain inert in the metropolis, or
appreciated the possibilities for destruction that had been to
hand in the days of the Terror.</p>

<p>Certainly every batch of names that appeared on the
commissioner's desk made him more thoughtful than ever.</p>

<p>'Arrest them!' he said in horror when the suggestion was made.
'Arrest them! Look here, have you ever seen driver ants attack a
house in Africa? Marching in, in endless battalions at midnight
and clearing out everything living from chickens to beetles? Have
you ever seen them re-form in the morning and go marching home
again? You wouldn't think of arresting 'em, would you? No, you'd
just sit down quietly out of their reach and be happy when the
last little red leg has disappeared round the corner!'</p>

<p>Those who knew the Red Hundred best were heartily in accord
with his philosophy.</p>

<p>'They caught Jessen,' reported Falmouth.</p>

<p>'Oh!' said the commissioner.</p>

<p>'When he disclosed his identity, they got rid of him
quick.'</p>

<p>'I've often wondered why the Four Just Men didn't do the
business of Starque themselves,' mused the Commissioner.</p>

<p>'It was rather rum,' admitted Falmouth, 'but Starque was a man
under sentence, as also was Francois. By some means they got hold
of the original warrants, and it was on these that
Jessen&mdash;did what he did.'</p>

<p>The commissioner nodded. 'And now,' he asked, 'what about
them?'</p>

<p>Falmouth had expected this question sooner or later.</p>

<p>'Do you suggest that we should catch them, sir?' he asked with
thinly veiled sarcasm; 'because if you do, sir, I have only to
remind you that we've been trying to do that for some years.'</p>

<p>The chief commissioner frowned.</p>

<p>'It's a remarkable thing,' he said, 'that as soon as we get a
situation such as&mdash;the Red Hundred scare and the Four Just
Men scare, for instance, we're completely at sea, and that's what
the papers will say. It doesn't sound creditable, but it's
so."</p>

<p>I place the superintendent's defence of Scotland Yard on
record in extenso.</p>

<p>'What the papers say,' said Falmouth, 'never keeps me awake at
night. Nobody's quite got the hang of the police force in this
country&mdash;certainly the writing people haven't.</p>

<p>'There are two ways of writing about the police, sir. One way
is to deal with them in the newspaper fashion with the headline
"Another Police Blunder" or "The Police and The Public", and the
other way is to deal with them in the magazine style, which is to
show them as softies on the wrong scent, whilst an ornamental
civilian is showing them their business, or as mysterious people
with false beards who pop up at the psychological moment, and say
in a loud voice, "In the name of the Law, I arrest you!"</p>

<p>'Well, I don't mind admitting that I know neither kind. I've
been a police officer for twenty-three years, and the only
assistance I've had from a civilian was from a man named Blackie,
who helped me to find the body of a woman that had disappeared. I
was rather prejudiced against him, but I don't mind admitting
that he was pretty smart and followed his clues with remarkable
ingenuity.</p>

<p>'The day we found the body I said to him:</p>

<p>'"Mr. Blackie, you have given me a great deal of information
about this woman's movements&mdash;in fact, you know a great deal
more than you ought to know&mdash;so I shall take you into
custody on the suspicion of having caused her death."</p>

<p>'Before he died he made a full confession, and ever since then
I have always been pleased to take as much advice and help from
outside as I could get.</p>

<p>'When people sometimes ask me about the cleverness of Scotland
Yard, I can't tell 'em tales such as you read about. I've had
murderers, anarchists, burglars, and average low-down people to
deal with, but they have mostly done their work in a commonplace
way and bolted. And as soon as they have bolted, we've employed
fairly commonplace methods and brought 'em back.</p>

<p>'If you ask me whether I've been in dreadful danger, when
arresting desperate murderers and criminals, I say "No".</p>

<p>'When your average criminal finds himself cornered, he says,
"All right, Mr. Falmouth; it's a cop", and goes quietly.</p>

<p>'Crime and criminals run in grooves. They're hardy annuals
with perennial methods. Extraordinary circumstances baffle the
police as they baffle other folks. You can't run a business on
business lines and be absolutely prepared for anything that turns
up. Whiteley's will supply you with a flea or an elephant, but if
a woman asked a shopgirl to hold her baby whilst she went into
the tinned meat department, the girl and the manager and the
whole system would be floored, because there is no provision for
holding babies. And if a Manchester goods merchant, unrolling his
stuff, came upon a snake lying all snug in the bale, he'd be
floored too, because natural history isn't part of their business
training, and they wouldn't be quite sure whether it was a big
worm or a boa constrictor.'</p>

<p>The Commissioner was amused.</p>

<p>'You've an altogether unexpected sense of humour,' he said,
'and the moral is&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That the unexpected always floors you, whether it's humour or
crime,' said Falmouth, and went away fairly pleased with
himself.</p>

<p>In his room he found a waiting messenger.</p>

<p>'A lady to see you, sir.'</p>

<p>'Who is it?' he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>The messenger handed him a slip of paper and when he read it
he whistled.</p>

<p>'The unexpected, by&mdash;! Show her up.'</p>

<p>On the paper was written&mdash;'The Woman of Gratz... '</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11">XI.&mdash;MANFRED</a></h2>

<p class="first">MANFRED sat alone in his Lewisham
house,&mdash;he was known to the old lady who was his caretaker
as 'a foreign gentleman in the music line'&mdash;and in the
subdued light of the shaded lamp, he looked tired. A book lay on
the table near at hand, and a silver coffee-service and an empty
coffee-cup stood on the stool by his side. Reaction he felt. This
strange man had set himself to a task that was never ending. The
destruction of the forces of the Red Hundred was the end of a
fight that cleared the ground for the commencement of
another&mdash;but physically he was weary.</p>

<p>Gonsalez had left that morning for Paris, Poiccart went by the
afternoon train, and he was to join them tomorrow.</p>

<p>The strain of the fight had told on them, all three.
Financially, the cost of the war had been heavy, but that strain
they could stand better than any other, for had they not the
fortune of&mdash;Courtlander; in case of need they knew their
man.</p>

<p>All the world had been searched before they&mdash;the first
Four&mdash;had come together&mdash;Manfred, Gonsalez, Poiccart,
and the man who slept eternally in the flower-grown grave at
Bordeaux. As men taking the oaths of priesthood they lived down
the passions and frets of life. Each man was an open book to the
other, speaking his most secret thought in the faith of sympathy,
one dominating thought controlling them all.</p>

<p>They had made the name of the Four Just Men famous or infamous
(according to your point of reckoning) throughout the civilized
world. They came as a new force into public and private life.
There were men, free of the law, who worked misery on their
fellows; dreadful human ghouls fattening on the bodies and souls
of the innocent and helpless; great magnates calling the law to
their aid, or pushing it aside as circumstances demanded. All
these became amenable to a new law, a new tribunal. There had
grown into being systems which defied correction; corporations
beyond chastisement; individuals protected by cunningly drawn
legislation, and others who knew to an inch the scope of
toleration. In the name of justice, these men struck swiftly,
dispassionately, mercilessly. The great swindler, the procureur,
the suborner of witnesses, the briber of juries&mdash;they
died.</p>

<p>There was no gradation of punishment: a warning, a second
warning&mdash;then death.</p>

<p>Thus their name became a symbol, at which the evildoer went
tremblingly about his work, dreading the warning and ready in
most cases to heed it. Life became a sweeter, a more wholesome
thing for many men who found the thin greenish-grey envelope on
their breakfast-table in the morning; but others persisted on
their way, loudly invoking the law, which in spirit, if not in
letter, they had outraged. The end was very sure, and I do not
know of one man who escaped the consequence.</p>

<p>Speculating on their identity, the police of the world decided
unanimously upon two points. The first was that these men were
enormously rich&mdash;as indeed they were, and the second that
one or two of them were no mean scientists&mdash;that also was
true. Of the fourth man who had joined them recently, speculation
took a wider turn. Manfred smiled as he thought of this fourth
member, of his honesty, his splendid qualities of heart and
brain, his enthusiasm, and his proneness to 'lapse from the
balance'&mdash;Gonsalez coined the phrase. It was an affectionate
smile. The fourth man was no longer of the brotherhood; he had
gone, the work being completed, and there were other reasons.</p>

<p>So Manfred was musing, till the little clock on the
mantelpiece chimed ten, then he lit the spirit-kettle and brewed
another cup of coffee. Thus engaged, he heard the far-away tinkle
of a bell and the opening of a door. Then a murmur of voices and
two steps on the stairs. He did not expect visitors, but he was
always prepared for them at any hour.</p>

<p>'Come in,' he said, in answer to the knock; he recognized the
apologetic rap of his housekeeper.</p>

<p>'A lady&mdash;a foreign lady to see you.'&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Show her in, please,' he said courteously.</p>

<p>He was busy with the kettle when she came in. He did not look
up, nor did he ask who it was. His housekeeper stood a moment
uncertain on the threshold, then went out, leaving them
together.</p>

<p>'You will excuse me a moment,' he said. 'Please sit down.'</p>

<p>He poured out the coffee with a steady hand, walked to his
desk, sorted a number of letters, tossed them into the grate, and
stood for a moment watching them burn, then looked at her.</p>

<p>Taking no notice of his invitation, the girl stood waiting at
ease, one hand on her hip, the other hanging loosely.</p>

<p>'Won't you sit down?' he asked again.</p>

<p>'I prefer to stand,' she said shortly.</p>

<p>'Then you are not so tired as I am,' he said, and sank back
into the depths of his chair.</p>

<p>She did not reply, and for a few seconds neither spoke.</p>

<p>'Has the Woman of Gratz forgotten that she is an orator?' he
said banteringly. It seemed to him that there was in those eyes
of hers a great yearning, and he changed his tone.</p>

<p>'Sit down, Maria,' he said gently. He saw the flush that rose
to her cheek, and mistook its significance.</p>

<p>'No, no!' he hastened to rectify an impression. 'I am serious
now, I am not gibing&mdash;why have you not gone with the
others?'</p>

<p>'I have work to do,' she said.</p>

<p>He stretched out his hands in a gesture of weariness.</p>

<p>'Work, work, work!' he said with a bitter smile, 'isn't the
work finished? Isn't there an end to this work of yours?'</p>

<p>'The end is at hand,' she said, and looked at him
strangely.</p>

<p>'Sit down,' he commanded, and she took the nearest chair and
watched him.</p>

<p>Then she broke the silence.</p>

<p>'What are you?' she asked, with a note of irritation. 'Who
gave you authority?'</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>'What am I&mdash;just a man, Maria. Authority? As you
understand it&mdash;none.'</p>

<p>She was thoughtful for a moment.</p>

<p>'You have not asked me why I have come,' she said.</p>

<p>'I have not asked myself&mdash;yet it seems natural that you
and I should meet again&mdash;to part.'</p>

<p>'What do they call you&mdash;your friends?' she asked
suddenly. 'Do they say "the man with the beard", or "the tall
man"&mdash;did any woman ever nurse you and call you by
name?'</p>

<p>A shadow passed over his face for a second.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said quietly; 'I have told you I am human; neither
devil nor demi-god, no product of sea-foam or witches' cauldron,'
he smiled, 'but a son of earthly parents&mdash;and men call me
George Manfred.'</p>

<p>'George,' she repeated as though learning a lesson. 'George
Manfred.' She looked at him long and earnestly, and frowned.</p>

<p>'What is it you see that displeases you?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Nothing,' she said quickly, 'only I am&mdash;I cannot
understand &mdash;you are different&mdash;'</p>

<p>'From what you expected.' She bent her head. 'You expected me
to air a triumph. To place myself in defence?' She nodded
again.</p>

<p>'No, no,' he went on, 'that is finished. I do not pursue a
victory&mdash;I am satisfied that the power of your friends is
shattered. I dissociate you from the humiliation of their
defeat.'</p>

<p>'I am no better nor worse than they,' she said defiantly.</p>

<p>'You will be better when the madness passes,' he said gravely,
'when you realize that your young life was not meant for the
dreadful sacrifice of anarchy.'</p>

<p>He leant over and took her listless hand and held it between
his palms.</p>

<p>'Child, you must leave this work,' he said softly, 'forget the
nightmare of your past&mdash;put it out of your mind, so that you
will come to believe that the Red Hundred never existed.'</p>

<p>She did not draw away her hand, nor did she attempt to check
the tears that came to her eyes. Something had entered her
soul&mdash;an influence that was beyond all description or
definition. A wonderful element that had dissolved the thing of
granite and steel, that she had fondly thought was her heart, and
left her weak and shaking in the process.</p>

<p>'Maria, if you ever knew a mother's love'&mdash;how soft his
voice was &mdash;'think of that: have you ever realized what your
tiny life was to her &mdash;how she planned and thought and
suffered for you&mdash;and to what end? That the hands she kissed
should be set against men's lives! Did she pray to God that He
might keep you strong in health and pure in soul&mdash;only that
His gifts should prove a curse to His beautiful world?'</p>

<p>With the tenderness of a father he drew her to him, till she
was on her knees before him and her weeping face was pressed
closely against him.</p>

<p>His strong arms were about her, and his hand smoothed her
hair.</p>

<p>'I am a wicked woman,' she sobbed, 'a wicked, wicked
woman.'</p>

<p>'Hush,' he said sadly; 'do not let us take our conception of
wickedness from our deeds, but from our intentions, however
mistaken, however much they traverse the written law.'</p>

<p>But her sobbing grew wilder, and she clutched him as though in
fear that he would leave her.</p>

<p>He talked to her as though she were a frightened child,
chiding her, laughing at her in gentle raillery, and she grew
calmer and presently lifted her stained face to his.</p>

<p>'Listen,' she said; 'I&mdash;I&mdash;oh, I cannot, I cannot
say it.' And she buried her face on her breast.</p>

<p>Then with an effort she raised her head again.</p>

<p>'If I asked you&mdash;if I begged you to do something for
me&mdash;would you?'</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes, smiling.</p>

<p>'You have done many things&mdash;you have
killed&mdash;yes&mdash;yes, let me say it&mdash;I know I am
hurting you, but let me finish.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said simply; 'I have killed.'</p>

<p>'Have you&mdash;pitied as you killed?'</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>'Yet you would,' she went on, and her distress moved him, 'you
would if you thought that you could kill a body and save a
soul.'</p>

<p>He shook his head again.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' she whispered, and tried to speak. Twice she
attempted to frame the words, and twice she failed. Then she
pushed herself slowly backwards with her hands at his chest, and
crouched before him with parted lips and heaving bosom.</p>

<p>'Kill me,' she breathed, 'for I have betrayed you to the
police.'</p>

<p>Still he made no sign, sitting there all huddled in the big
chair, as though every muscle of his body had relaxed.</p>

<p>'Do you hear?' she cried fiercely. 'I have betrayed you
because&mdash;I think&mdash;I love you&mdash;but I&mdash;I did
not know it&mdash;I did not know it! I hated you so that I pitied
you&mdash;and always I thought of you!'</p>

<p>She knew by the look of pain in his eyes what her words had
cost him.</p>

<p>Somehow she divined that the betrayal hurt least.</p>

<p>'I have never said it to myself,' she whispered; 'I have never
thought it in my most secret thoughts&mdash;yet it was there,
there all the time, waiting for expression&mdash;and I am
happier, though you die, and though every hour of my life be a
lifetime of pain, I am happier that I have said it, happier than
I thought I could ever be.</p>

<p>'I have wondered why I remembered you, and why I thought of
you, and why you came into my every dream. I thought it was
because I hated you, because I wanted to kill you, and to hold
you at my mercy&mdash;but I know now, I know now.'</p>

<p>She rocked from side to side, clasping her hands in the
intensity of her passion.</p>

<p>'You do not speak?' she cried. 'Do you not understand,
beloved? I have handed you over to the police, because&mdash;O
God! because I love you! It must be that I do!'</p>

<p>He leant forward and held out his hands and she came to him
half swooning.</p>

<p>'Marie, child,' he murmured, and she saw how pale he was, 'we
are strangely placed, you and I to talk of love. You must forget
this, little girl; let this be the waking point of your bad
dream; go forth into the new life&mdash;into a life where flowers
are, and birds sing, and where rest and peace is.'</p>

<p>She had no thought now save for his danger.</p>

<p>'They are below,' she moaned. 'I brought them here&mdash;I
guided them.'</p>

<p>He smiled into her face.</p>

<p>'I knew,' he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him incredulously.</p>

<p>'You knew,' she said, slowly.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;when you came'&mdash;he pointed to the heap of
burnt papers in the grate&mdash;'I knew.'</p>

<p>He walked to the window and looked out. What he saw satisfied
him.</p>

<p>He came back to where she still crouched on the floor and
lifted her to her feet.</p>

<p>She stood unsteadily, but his arm supported her. He was
listening, he heard the door open below.</p>

<p>'You must not think of me,' he said again.</p>

<p>She shook her head helplessly, and her lips quivered.</p>

<p>'God bless you and help you,' he said reverently, and kissed
her.</p>

<p>Then he turned to meet Falmouth.</p>

<p>'George Manfred,' said the officer, and looked at the girl in
perplexity.</p>

<p>'That is my name,' said Manfred quietly. 'You are Inspector
Falmouth.'</p>

<p>'Superintendent,' corrected the other.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry,' said Manfred.</p>

<p>'I shall take you into custody,' said Falmouth, 'on suspicion
of being a member of an organization known as the Four Just Men,
and accordingly concerned in the following crimes&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I will excuse you the recital,' said Manfred pleasantly, and
held out his hands. For the first time in his life he felt the
cold contact of steel at his wrists.</p>

<p>The man who snapped the handcuffs on was nervous and bungled,
and Manfred, after an interested glance at the gyves, lifted his
hands.</p>

<p>'This is not quite fastened,' he said.</p>

<p>Then as they closed round him, he half turned toward the girl
and smiled.</p>

<p>'Who knows how bright are the days in store for us both?' he
said softly.</p>

<p>Then they took him away.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">XII.&mdash;IN WANDSWORTH
GAOL</a></h2>

<p class="first">CHARLES GARRETT, admirable journalist, had
written the last line of a humorous description of a local
concert at which a cabinet minister had sung pathetic ballads.
Charles wrote with difficulty, for the situation had been of
itself so funny, that extracting its hidden humours was a more
than ordinarily heartbreaking thing. But he had finished and the
thick batch of copy lay on the chief sub-editor's
desk&mdash;Charles wrote on an average six words to a folio, and
a half a column story from his pen bulked like a three-volume
novel.</p>

<p>Charles stopped to threaten an office-boy who had misdirected
a letter, strolled into various quiet offices to 'see who was
there' and with his raincoat on his arm, and his stick in his
hand, stopped at the end of his wanderings before the chattering
tape machine. He looked through the glass box that shielded the
mechanism, and was interested in a message from Teheran in the
course of transmission.</p>

<p>'... at early date. Grand Vizier has informed Exchange
Correspondent that the construction of line will be pushed
forward... '</p>

<p>The tape stopped its stuttering and buzzed excitedly, then
came a succession of quick jerks that cleared away the
uncompleted message.</p>

<p>Then '... the leader of the Four Just Men was arrested in
London tonight,' said the tape, and Charles broke for the
editor's room.</p>

<p>He flung open the door without ceremony, and repeated the
story the little machine had told.</p>

<p>The grey chief received the news quietly, and the orders he
gave in the next five minutes inconvenienced some twenty or
thirty unoffending people.</p>

<p>The construction of the 'story' of the Four Just Men, began at
the lower rung of the intellectual ladder.</p>

<p>'You boy! get half a dozen taxicabs here quick... Poynter,
'phone the reporters in... get the Lambs Club on the 'phone and
see if O'Mahony or any other of our bright youths are there...
There are five columns about the Four Just Men standing in the
gallery, get it pulled up, Mr. Short... pictures &mdash;h'm...
yet wire Massonni to get down to the police station and see if he
can find a policeman who'll give him material for a sketch... Off
you go, Charles, and get the story.'</p>

<p>There was no flurry, no rush; it was for all the world like
the scene on a modern battleship when 'clear lower deck for
action' had sounded. Two hours to get the story into the paper
was ample, and there was no need for the whip.</p>

<p>Later, with the remorseless hands of the clock moving on, taxi
after taxi flew up to the great newspaper office, discharging
alert young men who literally leapt into the building. Later,
with waiting operators sitting tensely before the keyboards of
the linotypes, came Charles Garrett doing notable things with a
stump of pencil and a ream of thin copy paper.</p>

<p>It was the <i>Megaphone</i> that shone splendidly amidst its
journalistic fellows, with pages&mdash;I quote the envenomed
opinion of the news editor of the Mercury&mdash;that 'shouted
like the checks on a bookmaker's waistcoat'.</p>

<p>It was the <i>Megaphone</i> that fed the fires of public
interest, and was mainly responsible for the huge crowds that
gathered outside Greenwich Police Court, and overflowed in dense
masses to the foot of Blackheath Hill, whilst Manfred underwent
his preliminary inquiries.</p>

<p>'George Manfred, aged 39, of no occupation, residing at Hill
Crest Lodge, St John's.' In this prosaic manner he was introduced
to the world.</p>

<p>He made a striking figure in the steel-railed dock. A chair
was placed for him, and he was guarded as few prisoners had been
guarded. A special cell had been prepared for his reception, and
departing from established custom, extra warders were detailed to
watch him. Falmouth took no risks.</p>

<p>The charge that had been framed had to do with no well-known
case. Many years before, one Samuel Lipski, a notorious East End
sweater, had been found dead with the stereotyped announcement
that he had fallen to the justice of the Four. Upon this the
Treasury founded its case for the prosecution&mdash;a case which
had been very thoroughly and convincingly prepared, and
pigeon-holed against such time as arrest should overtake one or
the other of the Four Just Men.</p>

<p>Reading over the thousands of newspaper cuttings dealing with
the preliminary examination and trial of Manfred, I am struck
with the absence of any startling feature, such as one might
expect to find in a great state trial of this description.
Summarizing the evidence that was given at the police court, one
might arrange the 'parts' of the dozen or so commonplace
witnesses so that they read:</p>

<p>A policeman: 'I found the body.'</p>

<p>An inspector: 'I read the label.'</p>

<p>A doctor: 'I pronounced him dead.'</p>

<p>An only man with a slight squint and broken English: 'This man
Lipski, I known him, he were a goot man and make the business wit
the head, ker-vick.'</p>

<p>And the like.</p>

<p>Manfred refused to plead 'guilty' or 'not guilty'. He spoke
only once during the police court proceedings, and then only when
the formal question had been put to him.</p>

<p>'I am prepared to abide by the result of my trial,' he said
clearly, 'and it cannot matter much one way or the other whether
I plead "guilty" or "not guilty".'</p>

<p>'I will enter your plea as "not guilty",' said the
magistrate.</p>

<p>Manfred bowed.</p>

<p>'That is at your worship's discretion,' he said.</p>

<p>On the seventh of June he was formally committed for trial. He
had a short interview with Falmouth before he was removed from
the police-court cells.</p>

<p>Falmouth would have found it difficult to analyse his feelings
towards this man. He scarcely knew himself whether he was glad or
sorry that fate had thrown the redoubtable leader into his
hands.</p>

<p>His attitude to Manfred was that of a subordinate to a
superior, and that attitude he would have found hardest to
explain.</p>

<p>When the cell door was opened to admit the detective, Manfred
was reading. He rose with a cheery smile to greet his
visitor.</p>

<p>'Well, Mr. Falmouth,' he said lightly, 'we enter upon the
second and more serious act of the drama.'</p>

<p>'I don't know whether I'm glad or sorry,' said Falmouth
bluntly.</p>

<p>'You ought to be glad,' said Manfred with his quizzical smile.
'For you've vindicated&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, I know all about that,' said Falmouth dryly, 'but it's
the other part I hate.'</p>

<p>'You mean&mdash;?'</p>

<p>Manfred did not complete the question.</p>

<p>'I do&mdash;it's a hanging job, Mr. Manfred, and that is the
hateful business after the wonderful work you've done for the
country.'</p>

<p>Manfred threw back his head, and laughed in unrestrained
amusement.</p>

<p>'Oh, it's nothing to laugh about,' said the plain-spoken
detective, 'you are against a bad proposition&mdash;the Home
Secretary is a cousin of Ramon's, and he hates the very name of
the Four Just Men.'</p>

<p>'Yet I may laugh,' said Manfred calmly, 'for I shall
escape.'</p>

<p>There was no boastfulness in the speech, but a quiet assurance
that had the effect of nettling the other.</p>

<p>'Oh, you will, will you?' he said grimly. 'Well, we shall
see.'</p>

<p>There was no escape for Manfred in the dozen yards or so
between his cell door and the prison van. He was manacled to two
warders, and a double line of policemen formed an avenue through
which he was marched. Not from the van itself that moved in a
solid phalanx of mounted men with drawn swords. Nor from the
gloomy portals of Wandsworth Gaol where silent, uniformed men
closed round him and took him to the triple-locked cell.</p>

<p>Once in the night, as he slept, he was awakened by the sound
of the changing guard, and this amused him.</p>

<p>If one had the space to write, one could compile a whole book
concerning Manfred's life during the weeks he lay in gaol
awaiting trial. He had his visitors. Unusual laxity was allowed
in this respect. Falmouth hoped to find the other two men. He
generously confessed his hope to Manfred.</p>

<p>'You may make your mind easy on that point,' said Manfred;
'they will not come.'</p>

<p>Falmouth believed him.</p>

<p>'If you were an ordinary criminal, Mr. Manfred,' he said
smilingly, 'I should hint the possibilities of King's evidence,
but I won't insult you.'</p>

<p>Manfred's reply staggered him.</p>

<p>'Of course not,' he said with an air of innocence; 'if they
were arrested, who on earth would arrange my escape?'</p>

<p>The Woman of Gratz did not come to see him, and he was
glad.</p>

<p>He had his daily visits from the governor, and found him
charmingly agreeable. They talked of countries known to both, of
people whom each knew equally well, and tacitly avoided forbidden
subjects. Only&mdash;</p>

<p>'I hear you are going to escape?' said the governor, as he
concluded one of these visits. He was a largely built man,
sometime Major of Marine Artillery, and he took life seriously.
Therefore he did not share Falmouth's view of the projected
escape as being an ill-timed jest.</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied Manfred.</p>

<p>'From here?'</p>

<p>Manfred shook his head solemnly.</p>

<p>'The details have not yet been arranged,' he said with
admirable gravity. The governor frowned.</p>

<p>'I don't believe you're trying to pull my leg&mdash;it's too
devilishly serious a matter to joke about&mdash;but it would be
an awkward thing for me if you got away.' He was of the
prisoner's own caste and he had supreme faith in the word of the
man who discussed prison-breaking so lightheartedly.</p>

<p>'That I realize,' said Manfred with a little show of
deference, 'and I shall accordingly arrange my plans, so that the
blame shall be equally distributed.'</p>

<p>The governor, still frowning thoughtfully, left the cell. He
came back in a few minutes.</p>

<p>'By the way, Manfred,' he said, 'I forgot to tell you that
you'll get a visit from the chaplain. He's a very decent young
fellow, and I know I needn't ask you to let him down
lightly.'</p>

<p>With this subtle assumption of mutual paganism, he left
finally.</p>

<p>'That is a worthy gentleman,' thought Manfred.</p>

<p>The chaplain was nervously anxious to secure an opening, and
sought amidst the trivialities that led out of the conventional
exchange of greetings a fissure for the insertion of a tactful
inquiry.</p>

<p>Manfred, seeing his embarrassment, gave him the chance, and
listened respectfully while the young man talked, earnestly,
sincerely, manfully.</p>

<p>'N-no,' said the prisoner after a while, 'I don't think, Mr.
Summers, that you and I hold very different opinions, if they
were all reduced to questions of faith and appreciation of God's
goodness&mdash;but I have got to a stage where I shrink from
labelling my inmost beliefs with this or that creed, or
circumscribing the boundless limits of my faith with words. I
know you will forgive me and believe that I do not say this from
any desire to hurt you, but I have reached, too, a phase of
conviction where I am adamant to outside influence. For good or
ill, I must stand by the conceptions that I have built out of my
own life and its teachings.</p>

<p>'There is another, and a more practical reason,' he added,
'why I should not do you or any other chaplain the disservice of
taking up your time &mdash;I have no intention of dying.'</p>

<p>With this, the young minister was forced to be content. He met
Manfred frequently, talking of books and people and of strange
religions.</p>

<p>To the warders and those about him, Manfred was a source of
constant wonder. He never wearied them with the recital of his
coming attempt. Yet all that he said and did seemed founded on
that one basic article of faith: I shall escape.</p>

<p>The governor took every precaution to guard against rescue. He
applied for and secured reinforcements of warders, and Manfred,
one morning at exercise seeing strange faces amongst his guards,
bantered him with over-nervousness.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the Major, 'I've doubled the staff. I'm taking you
at your word, that is all&mdash;one must cling tight to the last
lingering shreds of faith one has in mankind. You say that you're
going to escape, and I believe you.' He thought a moment, 'I've
studied you,' he added.</p>

<p>'Indeed?'</p>

<p>'Not here,' said the governor, comprehending the prison in a
sweep of his hand, 'but outside&mdash;read about you and thought
about you and a little dimly understood you&mdash;that makes me
certain that you've got something at the back of your mind when
you talk so easily of escape.'</p>

<p>Manfred nodded. He nodded many times thoughtfully, and felt a
new interest in the bluff, brusque man.</p>

<p>'And whilst I'm doubling the guard and that sort of thing, I
know in my heart that that "something" of yours isn't "something"
with dynamite in it, or "something" with brute force behind it,
but it's "something" that's devilishly deep&mdash;that's how I
read it.'</p>

<p>He jerked his head in farewell, and the cell door closed
behind him with a great jangling and snapping of keys.</p>

<p>He might have been tried at the sessions following his
committal, but the Crown applied for a postponement, and being
informed and asked whether he would care to raise any objection
to that course, he replied that so far from objecting, he was
grateful, because his arrangements were not yet completed, and
when they asked him, knowing that he had refused solicitor and
counsel, what arrangements he referred to, he smiled
enigmatically and they knew he was thinking of this wonderful
plan of escape. That such persistent assurances of delivery
should eventually reach the public through the public press was
only to be expected, and although 'Manfred says he will escape
from Wandsworth' in the <i>Megaphone</i> headline, became 'A
prisoner's strange statement' in The Times, the substance of the
story was the same, and you may be sure that it lost nothing in
the telling. A Sunday journal, with a waning circulation, rallied
on the discovery that Manfred was mad, and published a column-long
account of this 'poor lunatic gibbering of freedom.'</p>

<p>Being allowed to read the newspapers, Manfred saw this, and it
kept him amused for a whole day.</p>

<p>The warders in personal attendance on him were changed daily,
he never had the same custodian twice till the governor saw a
flaw in the method that allowed a warder with whom he was only
slightly acquainted, and of whose integrity he was ignorant, to
come into close contact with his prisoner. Particularly did this
danger threaten from the new officers who had been drafted to
Wandsworth to reinforce the staff, and the governor went to the
other extreme, and two trusted men, who had grown old in the
service, were chosen for permanent watch-dogs.</p>

<p>'You won't be able to have any more newspapers,' said the
governor one morning. 'I've had orders from
headquarters&mdash;there have been some suspicious-looking
"agonies" in the <i>Megaphone</i> this last day or so.'</p>

<p>'I did not insert them,' said Manfred, smiling.</p>

<p>'No&mdash;but you may have read them,' said the governor
drily.</p>

<p>'So I might have,' said the thoughtful Manfred.</p>

<p>'Did you?'</p>

<p>Manfred made no reply.</p>

<p>'I suppose that isn't a fair question,' said the governor
cheerfully; 'anyhow, no more papers. You can have books&mdash;any
books you wish within limits.'</p>

<p>So Manfred was denied the pleasure of reading the little
paragraphs that described the movements and doings of the
fashionable world. Just then these interested him more than the
rest of the newspaper put together. Such news as he secured was
of a negative kind and through the governor. 'Am I still mad?' he
asked. 'No.'</p>

<p>'Was I born in Brittany&mdash;the son of humble parents?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;there's another theory now.'</p>

<p>'Is my real name still supposed to be Isadore
something-or-other?'</p>

<p>'You are now a member of a noble family, disappointed at an
early age by a reigning princess,' said the governor
impressively.</p>

<p>'How romantic!' said Manfred in hushed tones. The gravity of
his years, that was beyond his years, fell away from him in that
time of waiting. He became almost boyish again. He had a
never-ending fund of humour that turned even the tremendous
issues of his trial into subject-matter of amusement.</p>

<p>Armed with the authority of the Home Secretary came Luigi
Fressini, the youthful director of the Anthropological Institute
of Rome.</p>

<p>Manfred agreed to see him and made him as welcome as the
circumstances permitted. Fressini was a little impressed with his
own importance, and had the professional manner strongly
developed. He had a perky way of dropping his head on one side
when he made observations, and reminded Manfred of a horse-dealer
blessed with a little knowledge, but anxious to discover at all
hazards the 'points' that fitted in with his preconceived
theories. 'I would like to measure your head,' he said.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I cannot oblige you,' said Manfred coolly; 'partly
because I object to the annoyance of it, and partly because
head-measuring in anthropology is as much out of date as
bloodletting in surgery.'</p>

<p>The director was on his dignity.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I cannot take lessons in the science&mdash;' he
began.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, you can,' said Manfred, 'and you'd be a greater man
if you did. As it is Antonio de Costa and Felix Hedeman are both
beating you on your own ground&mdash;that monograph of yours on
'Cerebral Dynamics' was awful nonsense.'</p>

<p>Whereupon Fressini went very red and spluttered and left the
cell, afterwards in his indiscretion granting an interview to an
evening newspaper, in the course of which he described Manfred as
a typical homicide with those peculiarities of parietal
development, that are invariably associated with cold-blooded
murderers. For publishing what constituted a gross contempt of
court, the newspaper was heavily fined, and at the instance of
the British Government, Fressini was reprimanded, and eventually
superseded by that very De Costa of whom Manfred spoke.</p>

<p>All these happenings formed the comedy of the long wait, and
as to the tragedy, there was none.</p>

<p>A week before the trial Manfred, in the course of
conversation, expressed a desire for a further supply of
books.</p>

<p>'What do you want?' asked the governor, and prepared to take a
note.</p>

<p>'Oh, anything,' said Manfred lazily&mdash;'travel, biography,
science, sport&mdash;anything new that's going.'</p>

<p>'I'll get you a list,' said the governor, who was not a booky
man. 'The only travel books I know are those two new things,
Three Months in Morocco and Through the Ituri Forest. One of
them's by a new man, Theodore Max &mdash;do you know him?'</p>

<p>Manfred shook his head.</p>

<p>'But I'll try them,' he said.</p>

<p>'Isn't it about time you started to prepare your defence?' the
governor asked gruffly.</p>

<p>'I have no defence to offer,' said Manfred, 'therefore no
defence to prepare.'</p>

<p>The governor seemed vexed.</p>

<p>'Isn't life sufficiently sweet to you&mdash;to urge you to
make an effort to save it?' he asked roughly, 'or are you going
to give it up without a struggle?'</p>

<p>'I shall escape,' said Manfred again; 'aren't you tired of
hearing me tell you why I make no effort to save myself?'</p>

<p>'When the newspapers start the "mad" theory again,' said the
exasperated prison official, 'I shall feel most inclined to break
the regulations and write a letter in support of the
speculation.'</p>

<p>'Do,' said Manfred cheerfully, 'and tell them that I run round
my cell on all fours biting visitors' legs.'</p>

<p>The next day the books arrived. The mysteries of the Ituri
Forest remained mysteries, but Three Months in Morocco (big
print, wide margins, 12s. 6d.) he read with avidity from cover to
cover, notwithstanding the fact that the reviewers to a man
condemned it as being the dullest book of the season. Which was
an unkindly reflection upon the literary merits of its author,
Leon Gonsalez, who had worked early and late to prepare the book
for the press, writing far into the night, whilst Poiccart,
sitting at the other side of the table, corrected the damp proofs
as they came from the printer.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13">XIII.&mdash;THE 'RATIONAL
FAITHERS'</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN the handsomely furnished sitting-room of a
West Kensington flat, Gonsalez and Poiccart sat over their
post-prandial cigars, each busy with his own thoughts. Poiccart
tossed his cigar into the fireplace and pulled out his polished
briar and slowly charged it from a gigantic pouch. Leon watched
him under half-closed lids, piecing together the scraps of
information he had collected from his persistent observation.</p>

<p>'You are getting sentimental, my friend,' he said.</p>

<p>Poiccart looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>'You were smoking one of George's cigars without realizing it.
Halfway through the smoke you noticed the band had not been
removed, so you go to tear it off. By the band you are informed
that it is one of George's favourite cigars, and that starts a
train of thought that makes the cigar distasteful to you, and you
toss it away.'</p>

<p>Poiccart lit his pipe before replying.</p>

<p>'Spoken like a cheap little magazine detective,' he said
frankly. 'If you would know I was aware that it was George's, and
from excess of loyalty I was trying to smoke it; halfway through
I reluctantly concluded that friendship had its limits; it is you
who are sentimental.'</p>

<p>Gonsalez closed his eyes and smiled. 'There's another review
of your book in the <i>Evening Mirror</i> tonight,' Poiccart went
on maliciously; 'have you seen it?'</p>

<p>The recumbent figure shook its head.</p>

<p>'It says,' the merciless Poiccart continued, 'that an author
who can make Morocco as dull as you have done, would
make&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Spare me,' murmured Gonsalez half asleep.</p>

<p>They sat for ten minutes, the tick-tick of the little clock on
the mantelpiece and the regular puffs from Poiccart's pipe
breaking the silence.</p>

<p>'It would seem to me,' said Gonsalez, speaking with closed
eyes, 'that George is in the position of a master who has set his
two pupils a difficult problem to solve, quite confident that,
difficult as it is, they will surmount all obstacles and supply
the solution.'</p>

<p>'I thought you were asleep,' said Poiccart.</p>

<p>'I was never more awake,' said Gonsalez calmly. 'I am only
marshalling details. Do you know Mr. Peter Sweeney?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Poiccart.</p>

<p>'He's a member of the Borough Council of Chelmsford. A great
and a good man.'</p>

<p>Poiccart made no response.</p>

<p>'He is also the head and front of the 'Rational Faith'
movement, of which you may have heard.'</p>

<p>'I haven't,' admitted Poiccart, stolid but interested.</p>

<p>'The "Rational Faithers",' Gonsalez explained sleepily, 'are
an off shoot of the New Unitarians, and the New Unitarians are a
hotch-potch people with grievances.'</p>

<p>Poiccart yawned.</p>

<p>'The "Rational Faithers",' Gonsalez went on, 'have a mission
in life, they have also a brass band, and a collection of
drivelling songs, composed, printed and gratuitously distributed
by Mr. Peter Sweeney, who is a man of substance.'</p>

<p>He was silent after this for quite a minute.</p>

<p>'A mission in life, and a nice loud brassy band&mdash;the
members of which are paid monthly salaries&mdash;by Peter.'</p>

<p>Poiccart turned his head and regarded his friend
curiously.</p>

<p>'What is all this about?' he asked.</p>

<p>'The "Rational Faithers",' the monotonous Gonsalez continued,
'are the sort of people who for all time have been in the eternal
minority. They are against things, against public-houses, against
music-halls, against meat eating, and vaccination&mdash;and
capital punishment,' he repeated softly.</p>

<p>Poiccart waited.</p>

<p>'Years ago they were regarded as a nuisance&mdash;rowdies
broke up their meetings; the police prosecuted them for
obstruction, and some of them were sent to prison and came out
again, being presented with newly furbished haloes at meat
breakfasts&mdash;Peter presiding.</p>

<p>'Now they have lived down their persecutions&mdash;martyrdom
is not to be so cheaply bought&mdash;they are an institution like
the mechanical spinning jenny and fashionable
socialism&mdash;which proves that if you go on doing things often
enough and persistently, saying with a loud voice, '<i>pro bono
publico</i>', people will take you at your own valuation, and
will tolerate you.'</p>

<p>Poiccart was listening intently now.</p>

<p>'These people demonstrate&mdash;Peter is really well off, with
heaps of slum property, and he has lured other wealthy ladies and
gentlemen into the movement. They demonstrate on all occasions.
They have chants&mdash;Peter calls them "chants", and it is a
nice distinction, stamping them as it does with the stamp of
semi-secularity&mdash;for these festive moments, chants for the
confusion of vaccinators, and eaters of beasts, and such. But of
all their "Services of Protest" none is more thorough, more
beautifully complete, than that which is specially arranged to
express their horror and abhorrence of capital punishment.'</p>

<p>His pause was so long that Poiccart interjected an
impatient&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'I was trying to think of the chant,' said Leon thoughtfully.
'If I remember right one verse goes&mdash;</p>

<p>Come fight the gallant fight,</p>

<p>This horror to undo;</p>

<p>Two blacks will never make a white,</p>

<p>Nor legal murder too.'</p>

<p>'The last line,' said Gonsalez tolerantly, 'is a trifle vague,
but it conveys with delicate suggestion the underlying moral of
the poem. There is another verse which has for the moment eluded
me, but perhaps I shall think of it later.'</p>

<p>He sat up suddenly and leant over, dropping his hand on
Poiccart's arm.</p>

<p>'When we were talking of&mdash;our plan the other day you
spoke of our greatest danger, the one thing we could not avoid.
Does it not seem to you that the "Rational Faithers" offer a
solution with their querulous campaigns, their demonstrations,
their brassy brass band, and their preposterous chants?'</p>

<p>Poiccart pulled steadily at his pipe.</p>

<p>'You're a wonderful man, Leon,' he said.</p>

<p>Leon walked over to the cupboard, unlocked it, and drew out a
big portfolio such as artists use to carry their drawings in. He
untied the strings and turned over the loose pages. It was a
collection that had cost the Four Just Men much time and a great
deal of money.</p>

<p>'What are you going to do?' asked Poiccart, as the other,
slipping off his coat and fixing his pince-nez, sat down before a
big plan he had extracted from the portfolio. Leon took up a fine
drawing-pen from the table, examined the nib with the eye of a
skilled craftsman, and carefully uncorked a bottle of architect's
ink.</p>

<p>'Have you ever felt a desire to draw imaginary islands?' he
asked, 'naming your own bays, christening your capes, creating
towns with a scratch of your pen, and raising up great mountains
with herringbone "strokes? Because I'm going to do something like
that&mdash;I feel in that mood which in little boys is eloquently
described as "trying", and I have the inclination to annoy
Scotland Yard.'</p>

<p>It was the day before the trial that Falmouth made the
discovery. To be exact it was made for him. The keeper of a Gower
Street boarding house reported that two mysterious men had
engaged rooms. They came late at night with one portmanteau
bearing divers foreign labels; they studiously kept their faces
in the shadow, and the beard of one was obviously false. In
addition to which they paid for their lodgings in advance, and
that was the most damning circumstance of all. Imagine mine host,
showing them to their rooms, palpitating with his tremendous
suspicion, calling to the full upon his powers of simulation,
ostentatiously nonchalant, and impatient to convey the news to
the police-station round the corner. For one called the other
Leon, and they spoke despairingly in stage whispers of 'poor
Manfred'.</p>

<p>They went out together, saying they would return soon after
midnight, ordering a fire for their bedroom, for the night was
wet and chilly.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the full story was being told to Falmouth
over the telephone.</p>

<p>'It's too good to be true,' was his comment, but gave orders.
The hotel was well surrounded by midnight, but so skilfully that
the casual passer-by would never have suspected it. At three in
the morning, Falmouth decided that the men had been warned, and
broke open their doors to search the rooms. The portmanteau was
their sole find. A few articles of clothing, bearing the 'tab' of
a Parisian tailor, was all they found till Falmouth, examining
the bottom of the portmanteau, found that it was false.</p>

<p>'Hullo!' he said, and in the light of his discovery the
exclamation was modest in its strength, for, neatly folded, and
cunningly hidden, he came upon the plans. He gave them a rapid
survey and whistled. Then he folded them up and put them
carefully in his pocket.</p>

<p>'Keep the house under observation,' he ordered. 'I don't
expect they'll return, but if they do, take 'em.'</p>

<p>Then he flew through the deserted streets as fast as a
motor-car could carry him, and woke the chief commissioner from
a sound sleep.</p>

<p>'What is it?' he asked as he led the detective to his
study.</p>

<p>Falmouth showed him the plans.</p>

<p>The commissioner raised his eyebrows, and whistled.</p>

<p>'That's what I said,' confessed Falmouth.</p>

<p>The chief spread the plans upon the big table.</p>

<p>'Wandsworth, Pentonville and Reading,' said the commissioner,
'Plans, and remarkably good plans, of all three prisons.'</p>

<p>Falmouth indicated the writing in the cramped hand and the
carefully ruled lines that had been drawn in red ink.</p>

<p>'Yes, I see them,' said the commissioner, and read '"Wall 3
feet thick &mdash;dynamite here, warder on duty here&mdash;can be
shot from wall, distance to entrance to prison hall 25 feet;
condemned cell here, walls 3 feet, one window, barred 10 feet 3
inches from ground".'</p>

<p>'They've got the thing down very fine&mdash;what is
this&mdash;Wandsworth?'</p>

<p>'It's the same with the others, sir,' said Falmouth. 'They've
got distances, heights and posts worked out; they must have taken
years to get this information.'</p>

<p>'One thing is evident,' said the commissioner; 'they'll do
nothing until after the trial&mdash;all these plans have been
drawn with the condemned cell as the point of objective.'</p>

<p>Next morning Manfred received a visit from Falmouth.</p>

<p>'I have to tell you, Mr. Manfred,' he said, 'that we have in
our possession full details of your contemplated rescue.'</p>

<p>Manfred looked puzzled.</p>

<p>'Last night your two friends escaped by the skin of their
teeth, leaving behind them elaborate plans&mdash;'</p>

<p>'In writing?' asked Manfred, with his quick smile.</p>

<p>'In writing,' said Falmouth solemnly. 'I think it is my duty
to tell you this, because it seems that you are building too much
upon what is practically an impossibility, an escape from
gaol.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered Manfred absently, 'perhaps so&mdash;in writing
I think you said.'</p>

<p>'Yes, the whole thing was worked out'&mdash;he thought he had
said quite enough, and turned the subject. 'Don't you think you
ought to change your mind and retain a lawyer?'</p>

<p>'I think you're right,' said Manfred slowly. 'Will you arrange
for a member of some respectable firm of solicitors to see
me?'</p>

<p>'Certainly,' said Falmouth, 'though you've left your
defence&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, it isn't my defence,' said Manfred cheerfully; 'only I
think I ought to make a will.'</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14">XIV.&mdash;AT THE OLD
BAILEY</a></h2>

<p class="first">THEY were privileged people who gained admission
to the Old Bailey, people with tickets from sheriffs, reporters,
great actors, and very successful authors. The early editions of
the evening newspapers announced the arrival of these latter
spectators. The crowd outside the court contented themselves with
discussing the past and the probable future of the prisoner.</p>

<p>The <i>Megaphone</i> had scored heavily again, for it
published in extenso the particulars of the prisoner's will. It
referred to this in its editorial columns variously as 'An
Astounding Document' and 'An Extraordinary Fragment'. It was
remarkable alike for the amount bequeathed, and for the
generosity of its legacies.</p>

<p>Nearly half a million was the sum disposed of, and of this the
astonishing sum of £60,000 was bequeathed to 'the sect known as
the "Rational Faithers" for the furtherance of their campaign
against capital punishment', a staggering legacy remembering that
the Four Just Men knew only one punishment for the people who
came under its ban.</p>

<p>'You want this kept quiet, of course,' said the lawyer when
the will had been attested.</p>

<p>'Not a bit,' said Manfred; 'in fact I think you had better
hand a copy to the <i>Megaphone</i>.'</p>

<p>'Are you serious?' asked the dumbfounded lawyer.</p>

<p>'Perfectly so,' said the other. 'Who knows,' he smiled, 'it
might influence public opinion in&mdash;er&mdash;my favour.'</p>

<p>So the famous will became public property, and when Manfred,
climbing the narrow wooden stairs that led to the dock of the Old
Bailey, came before the crowded court, it was this latest freak
of his that the humming court discussed.</p>

<p>'Silence!'</p>

<p>He looked round the big dock curiously, and when a warder
pointed out the seat, he nodded, and sat down. He got up when the
indictment was read.</p>

<p>'Are you guilty or not guilty?' he was asked, and replied
briefly:</p>

<p>'I enter no plea.'</p>

<p>He was interested in the procedure. The scarlet-robed judge
with his old, wise face and his quaint, detached air interested
him mostly. The businesslike sheriffs in furs, the clergyman who
sat with crossed legs, the triple row of wigged barristers, the
slaving bench of reporters with their fierce whispers of
instructions as they passed their copy to the waiting boys, and
the strong force of police that held the court: they had all a
special interest for him.</p>

<p>The leader for the Crown was a little man with a keen, strong
face and a convincing dramatic delivery. He seemed to be
possessed all the time with a desire to deal fairly with the
issues, fairly to the Crown and fairly to the prisoner. He was
not prepared, he said, to labour certain points which had been
brought forward at the police-court inquiry, or to urge the jury
that the accused man was wholly without redeeming qualities.</p>

<p>He would not even say that the man who had been killed, and
with whose killing Manfred was charged, was a worthy or a
desirable citizen of the country. Witnesses who had come forward
to attest their knowledge of the deceased, were ominously silent
on the point of his moral character. He was quite prepared to
accept the statement he was a bad man, an evil influence on his
associates, a corrupting influence on the young women whom he
employed, a breaker of laws, a blackguard, a debauchee.</p>

<p>'But, gentlemen of the jury,' said the counsel impressively,
'a civilized community such as ours has accepted a
system&mdash;intricate and imperfect though it may be&mdash;by
which the wicked and the evil-minded are punished. Generation
upon generation of wise law-givers have moulded and amended a
scale of punishment to meet every known delinquency. It has
established its system laboriously, making great national
sacrifices for the principles that system involved. It has
wrested with its life-blood the charters of a great
liberty&mdash;the liberty of a law administered by its chosen
officers and applied in the spirit of untainted equity.'</p>

<p>So he went on to speak of the Four Just Men who had founded a
machinery for punishment, who had gone outside and had overridden
the law; who had condemned and executed their judgment
independent and in defiance of the established code.</p>

<p>'Again I say, that I will not commit myself to the statement
that they punished unreasonably: that with the evidence against
their victims, such as they possessed, the law officers of the
Crown would have hesitated at initiating a prosecution. If it had
pleased them to have taken an abstract view of this or that
offence, and they had said this or that man is deserving of
punishment, we, the representatives of the established law, could
not have questioned for one moment the justice of their
reasoning. But we have come into conflict on the question of the
adequacy of punishment, and upon the more serious question of the
right of the individual to inflict that punishment, which results
in the appearance of this man in the dock on a charge of
murder.'</p>

<p>Throughout the opening speech, Manfred leant forward,
following the counsel's words.</p>

<p>Once or twice he nodded, as though he were in agreement with
the speaker, and never once did he show sign of dissent.</p>

<p>The witnesses came in procession. The constable again, and the
doctor, and the voluble man with the squint. As he finished with
each, the counsel asked whether he had any question to put, but
Manfred shook his head.</p>

<p>'Have you ever seen the accused before?' the judge asked the
last witness.</p>

<p>'No, sar, I haf not,' said the witness emphatically, 'I haf
not'ing to say against him.'</p>

<p>As he left the witness-box, he said audibly:</p>

<p>'There are anoder three yet&mdash;I haf no desire to die,' and
amidst the laughter that followed this exhibition of caution,
Manfred recalled him sharply.</p>

<p>'If you have no objection, my lord?' he said.</p>

<p>'None whatever,' replied the judge courteously.</p>

<p>'You have mentioned something about another three,' he said.
'Do you suggest that they have threatened you?'</p>

<p>'No, sar&mdash;no!' said the eager little man.</p>

<p>'I cannot examine counsel,' said Manfred, smiling; 'but I put
it to him, that there has been no suggestion of intimidation of
witnesses in this case.'</p>

<p>'None whatever,' counsel hastened to say; 'it is due to you to
make that statement.'</p>

<p>'Against this man'&mdash;the prisoner pointed to the
witness-box&mdash;'we have nothing that would justify our action.
He is a saccharine smuggler, and a dealer in stolen
property&mdash;but the law will take care of him.'</p>

<p>'It's a lie,' said the little man in the box, white and
shaking; 'it is libellous!'</p>

<p>Manfred smiled again and dismissed him with a wave of his
hand.</p>

<p>The judge might have reproved the prisoner for his irrelevant
accusation, but allowed the incident to pass.</p>

<p>The case for the prosecution was drawing to a close when an
official of the court came to the judge's side and, bending down,
began a whispered conversation with him.</p>

<p>As the final witness withdrew, the judge announced an
adjournment and the prosecuting counsel was summoned to his
lordship's private room.</p>

<p>In the cells beneath the court, Manfred received a hint at
what was coming and looked grave.</p>

<p>After the interval, the judge, on taking his seat, addressed
the jury:</p>

<p>'In a case presenting the unusual features that characterize
this,' he said, 'it is to be expected that there will occur
incidents of an almost unprecedented nature. The circumstances
under which evidence will be given now, are, however, not
entirely without precedent.' He opened a thick law book before
him at a place marked by a slip of paper. 'Here in the Queen
against Forsythe, and earlier, the Queen against Berander, and
earlier still and quoted in all these rulings, the King against
Sir Thomas Mandory, we have parallel cases.' He closed the
book.</p>

<p>'Although the accused has given no intimation of his desire to
call witnesses on his behalf, a gentleman has volunteered his
evidence. He desires that his name shall be withheld, and there
are peculiar circumstances that compel me to grant his request.
You may be assured, gentlemen of the jury, that I am satisfied
both as to the identity of the witness, and that he is in every
way worthy of credence.'</p>

<p>He nodded a signal to an officer, and through the judge's door
to the witness box there walked a young man. He was dressed in a
tightly fitting frock coat, and across the upper part of his face
was a half mask.</p>

<p>He leant lightly over the rail, looking at Manfred with a
little smile on his clean-cut mouth, and Manfred's eyes
challenged him.</p>

<p>'You come to speak on behalf of the accused?' asked the
judge.</p>

<p>'Yes, my lord.'</p>

<p>It was the next question that sent a gasp of surprise through
the crowded court.</p>

<p>'You claim equal responsibility for his actions?'</p>

<p>'Yes, my lord!'</p>

<p>'You are, in fact, a member of the organization known as the
Four Just Men?'</p>

<p>'I am.'</p>

<p>He spoke calmly, and the thrill that the confession produced,
left him unmoved.</p>

<p>'You claim, too,' said the judge, consulting a paper before
him, 'to have participated in their councils?'</p>

<p>'I claim that.'</p>

<p>There were long pauses between the questions, for the judge
was checking the replies and counsel was writing busily.</p>

<p>'And you say you are in accord both with their objects and
their methods?'</p>

<p>'Absolutely.'</p>

<p>'You have helped carry out their judgment?'</p>

<p>'I have.'</p>

<p>'And have given it the seal of your approval?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'And you state that their judgments were animated with a high
sense of their duty and responsibility to mankind?'</p>

<p>'Those were my words.'</p>

<p>'And that the men they killed were worthy of death?'</p>

<p>'Of that I am satisfied.'</p>

<p>'You state this as a result of your personal knowledge and
investigation?'</p>

<p>'I state this from personal knowledge in two instances, and
from the investigations of myself and the independent testimony
of high legal authority.'</p>

<p>'Which brings me to my next question,' said the judge. 'Did
you ever appoint a commission to investigate all the
circumstances of the known cases in which the Four Just Men have
been implicated?'</p>

<p>'I did.'</p>

<p>'Was it composed of a Chief Justice of a certain European
State, and four eminent criminal lawyers?'</p>

<p>'It was.'</p>

<p>'And what you have said is the substance of the finding of
that Commission?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>The Judge nodded gravely and the public prosecutor rose to
cross-examination.</p>

<p>'Before I ask you any question,' he said, 'I can only express
myself as being in complete agreement with his lordship on the
policy of allowing your identity to remain hidden.' The young man
bowed.</p>

<p>'Now,' said the counsel, 'let me ask you this. How long have
you been in association with the Four Just Men?'</p>

<p>'Six months,' said the other.</p>

<p>'So that really you are not in a position to give evidence
regarding the merits of this case&mdash;which is five years old,
remember.'</p>

<p>'Save from the evidence of the Commission.'</p>

<p>'Let me ask you this&mdash;but I must tell you that you need
not answer unless you wish&mdash;are you satisfied that the Four
Just Men were responsible for that tragedy?'</p>

<p>'I do not doubt it,' said the young man instantly. 'Would
anything make you doubt it?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the witness smiling, 'if Manfred denied it, I
should not only doubt it, but be firmly assured of his
innocence.'</p>

<p>'You say you approve both of their methods and their
objects?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Let us suppose you were the head of a great business firm
controlling a thousand workmen, with rules and regulations for
their guidance and a scale of fines and punishments for the
preservation of discipline. And suppose you found one of those
workmen had set himself up as an arbiter of conduct, and had
superimposed upon your rules a code of his own.'</p>

<p>'Well?'</p>

<p>'Well, what would be your attitude toward that man?'</p>

<p>'If the rules he initiated were wise and needful I would
incorporate them in my code.'</p>

<p>'Let me put another case. Suppose you governed a territory,
administering the laws&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I know what you are going to say,' interrupted the witness,
'and my answer is that the laws of a country are as so many
closely-set palings erected for the benefit of the community. Yet
try as you will, the interstices exist, and some men will go and
come at their pleasure, squeezing through this fissure, or
walking boldly through that gap.'</p>

<p>'And you would welcome an unofficial form of justice that
acted as a kind of moral stop-gap?'</p>

<p>'I would welcome clean justice.'</p>

<p>'If it were put to you as an abstract proposition, would you
accept it?'</p>

<p>The young man paused before he replied.</p>

<p>'It is difficult to accommodate one's mind to the abstract,
with such tangible evidence of the efficacy of the Four Just
Men's system before one's eyes,' he said.</p>

<p>'Perhaps it is,' said the counsel, and signified that he had
finished.</p>

<p>The witness hesitated before leaving the box, looking at the
prisoner, but Manfred shook his head smilingly, and the straight
slim figure of the young man passed out of court by the way he
had come.</p>

<p>The unrestrained buzz of conversation that followed his
departure was allowed to go unchecked as judge and counsel
consulted earnestly across the bench.</p>

<p>Garrett, down amongst the journalists, put into words the
vague thought that had been present in every mind in court.</p>

<p>'Do you notice, Jimmy,' he said to James Sinclair of the
Review, 'how blessed unreal this trial is? Don't you miss the
very essence of a murder trial, the mournfulness of it and the
horror of it? Here's a feller been killed and not once has the
prosecution talked about "this poor man struck down in the prime
of life" or said anything that made you look at the prisoner to
see how he takes it. It's a philosophical discussion with a
hanging at the end of it.'</p>

<p>'Sure,' said Jimmy.</p>

<p>'Because,' said Garrett, 'if they find him guilty, he's got to
die. There's no doubt about that; if they don't hang him, crack!
goes the British Constitution, the Magna Charta, the Diet of
Worms, and a few other things that Bill Seddon was gassing
about.'</p>

<p>His irreverent reference was to the prosecutor's opening
speech. Now Sir William Seddon was on his feet again, beginning
his closing address to the jury. He applied himself to the
evidence that had been given, to the prisoner's refusal to call
that evidence into question, and conventionally traced step by
step the points that told against the man in the dock. He touched
on the appearance of the masked figure in the witness-box. For
what it was worth it deserved their consideration, but it did not
affect the issue before the court. The jury were there to
formulate a verdict in accordance with the law as it existed, not
as if it did not exist at all, to apply the law, not to create
it&mdash;that was their duty. The prisoner would be offered an
opportunity to speak in his own defence. Counsel for the Crown
had waived his right to make the final address. They would, if he
spoke, listen attentively to the prisoner, giving him the benefit
of any doubt that might be present in their minds. But he could
not see, he could not conceivably imagine, how the jury could
return any but one verdict.</p>

<p>It seemed for a while that Manfred did not intend availing
himself of the opportunity, for he made no sign, then he rose to
his feet, and, resting his hands on the inkstand ledge before
him:</p>

<p>'My lord,' he said, and turned apologetically to the jury,
'and gentlemen.'</p>

<p>The court was so still that he could hear the scratchings of
the reporters' pens, and unexpected noises came from the street
outside.</p>

<p>'I doubt either the wisdom or the value of speaking,' he said,
'not that I suggest that you have settled in your minds the
question of my guilt without very excellent and convincing
reasons.</p>

<p>'I am under an obligation to Counsel for the Treasury,' he
bowed to the watchful prosecutor, 'because he spared me those
banalities of speech which I feared would mar this trial. He did
not attempt to whitewash the man we killed, or to exonerate him
from his gross and sordid crimes. Rather, he made plain the exact
position of the law in relation to myself, and with all he said I
am in complete agreement. The inequalities of the law are
notorious, and I recognize the impossibility, as society is
constituted, of amending the law so that crimes such as we have
dealt with shall be punished as they deserve. I do not rail
against the fate that sent me here. When I undertook my mission,
I undertook it with my eyes open, for I, too,' he smiled at the
upturned faces at the counsels' bench, 'I too am learned in the
law&mdash;and other things.'</p>

<p>'There are those who imagine that I am consumed with a burning
desire to alter the laws of this country; that is not so. Set
canons, inflexible in their construction, cannot be adapted
according to the merits of a case, and particularly is this so
when the very question of "merit" is a contentious point. The
laws of England are good laws, wise and just and equitable. What
other commendation is necessary than this one fact, that I
recognize that my life is forfeit by those laws, and assent to
the justice which condemns me'?</p>

<p>'None the less, when I am free again,' he went on easily, 'I
shall continue to merit your judgment because there is that
within me, which shows clearly which way my path lies, and how
best I may serve humanity. If you say that to choose a victim
here and a victim there for condemnation, touching only the
veriest fringe of the world of rascaldom, I am myself
unjust&mdash;since I leave the many and punish the few&mdash;I
answer that for every man we slew, a hundred turned at the terror
of our name and walked straightly; that the example of one death
saved thousands. And if you should seriously ask: Have you helped
reform mankind, I answer as seriously&mdash;Yes.'</p>

<p>He talked all this time to the judge.</p>

<p>'It would be madness to expect a civilized country to revert
to the barbarism of an age in which death was the penalty for
every other crime, and I will not insult your intelligence by
denying that such a return to the bad days was ever suggested by
me. But there has come into existence a spurious form of
humanitarianism, the exponents of which have, it would appear,
lost their sense of proportion, and have promoted the Fear of
Pain to a religion; who have forgotten that the Age of Reason is
not yet, and that men who are animal in all but human semblance
share the animal's obedience to corrective discipline, share too
his blind fear of death&mdash;and are amenable to methods that
threaten his comfort or his life.'</p>

<p>He flung out his hand toward the judge.</p>

<p>'You, my lord,' he cried, 'can you order the flogging of a
brute who has half killed one of his fellows, without incurring
the bleating wrath of men and women, who put everything before
physical pain&mdash;honour, patriotism, justice? Can you sentence
a man to death for a cruel murder without a thousand shrieking
products of our time rushing hither and thither like ants,
striving to secure his release? Without a chorus of
pity&mdash;that was unexcited by the mangled victim of his
ferocity? "Killing, deliberate, wolfish killing by man", say they
in effect, "is the act of God; but the legal punishment of death,
is murder." That is why I expect no sympathy for the methods the
Four Just Men adopted. We represented a law&mdash;we executed
expeditiously. We murdered if you like. In the spirit and the
letter of the laws of England, we did murder. I acknowledge the
justice of my condemnation. I do not desire to extenuate the
circumstances of my crime. Yet none the less the act I cannot
justify to your satisfaction I justify to my own.'</p>

<p>He sat down.</p>

<p>A barrister, leaning over the public prosecutor's back,
asked:</p>

<p>'What do you think of that?'</p>

<p>Sir William shook his head.</p>

<p>'Bewildering,' he said in despair.</p>

<p>The judge's summing up was one of the briefest on record.</p>

<p>The jury had to satisfy their minds that the prisoner
committed the crime with which he was charged, and must not
trouble themselves with any other aspect of the case but that
part plainly before them. Was the man in the dock responsible for
the killing of Lipski?</p>

<p>Without leaving the box, the jury returned its verdict.</p>

<p>'Guilty!'</p>

<p>Those used to such scenes noticed that the judge in passing
sentence of death omitted the striking and sombre words that
usually accompany the last sentence of the law, and that he
spoke, too, without emotion.</p>

<p>'Either he's going to get a reprieve or else the judge is
certain he'll escape,' said Garrett, 'and the last explanation
seems ridiculous.'</p>

<p>'By the way,' said his companion as they passed slowly with
the crowd into the roadway, 'who was that swell that came late
and sat on the bench?'</p>

<p>'That was his Highness the Prince of the Escorial,' said
Charles, 'he's in London just now on his honeymoon.'</p>

<p>'I know all about that," said Jimmy, 'but I heard him speaking
to the sheriff just before we came out, and it struck me that I'd
heard his voice before.'</p>

<p>'It seemed so to me,' said the discreet Charles&mdash;so
discreet indeed that he never even suggested to his editor that
the mysterious mask who gave evidence on behalf of George Manfred
was none other than his Royal Highness.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15">XV.&mdash;CHELMSFORD</a></h2>

<p class="first">THEY took Manfred back to Wandsworth Gaol on the
night of the trial. The governor, standing in the gloomy
courtyard as the van drove in with its clanking escort, received
him gravely.</p>

<p>'Is there anything you want?' he asked when he visited the
cell that night.</p>

<p>'A cigar,' said Manfred, and the governor handed him the case.
Manfred selected with care, the prison-master watching him
wonderingly.</p>

<p>'You're an extraordinary man,' he said.</p>

<p>'And I need to be,' was the reply, 'for I have before me an
ordeal which is only relieved of its gruesomeness by its
uniqueness.'</p>

<p>'There will be a petition for reprieve, of course,' said the
governor.</p>

<p>'Oh, I've killed that,' laughed Manfred, 'killed it with icy
blast of satire&mdash;although I trust I haven't discouraged the
"Rational Faithers" for whom I have made such handsome posthumous
provision.'</p>

<p>'You are an extraordinary man,' mused the governor again. 'By
the way, Manfred, what part does the lady play in your
escape?'</p>

<p>'The lady?' Manfred was genuinely astonished.</p>

<p>'Yes, the woman who haunts the outside of this prison; a lady
in black, and my chief warder tells me singularly beautiful.'</p>

<p>'Ah, the woman,' said Manfred, and his face clouded. 'I had
hoped she had gone.'</p>

<p>He sat thinking.</p>

<p>'If she is a friend of yours, an interview would not be
difficult to obtain,' said the governor.</p>

<p>'No, no, no,' said Manfred hastily, 'there must be no
interview&mdash;at any rate here.'</p>

<p>The governor thought that the interview 'here' was very
unlikely, for the Government had plans for the disposal of their
prisoner, which he did not feel his duty to the State allowed him
to communicate. He need not, had he known, have made a mystery of
the scheme.</p>

<p>Manfred kicked off the clumsy shoes the prison authorities had
provided him with&mdash;he had changed into convict dress on his
return to the gaol &mdash;and laid himself down dressed as he
was, pulling a blanket over him.</p>

<p>One of the watching warders suggested curtly that he should
undress.</p>

<p>'It is hardly worth while,' he said, 'for so brief a
time.'</p>

<p>They thought he was referring again to the escape, and
marvelled a little at his madness. Three hours later when the
governor came to the cell, they were dumbfounded at his
knowledge.</p>

<p>'Sorry to disturb you,' said the Major, 'but you're to be
transferred to another prison&mdash;why, you aren't
undressed!'</p>

<p>'No,' said Manfred, lazily kicking off the cover, 'but I
thought the transfer would be earlier.'</p>

<p>'How did you know?'</p>

<p>'About the transfer&mdash;oh, a little bird told me,' said the
prisoner, stretching himself. 'Where is it to
be&mdash;Pentonville?'</p>

<p>The governor looked at him a little strangely.</p>

<p>'No,' he said.</p>

<p>'Reading?'</p>

<p>'No,' said the governor shortly.</p>

<p>Manfred frowned.</p>

<p>'Wherever it is, I'm ready,' he said.</p>

<p>He nodded to the attendant warder as he left and took an
informal but cheery farewell of the governor on the deserted
railway station where a solitary engine with brake van attached
stood waiting.</p>

<p>'A special, I perceive,' he said.</p>

<p>'Goodbye, Manfred,' said the governor and offered his
hand.</p>

<p>Manfred did not take it&mdash;and the Major flushed in the
dark.</p>

<p>'I cannot take your hand,' said Manfred, 'for two reasons. The
first is that your excellent chief warder has handcuffed me,
behind&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Never mind about the other reason,' said the governor with a
little laugh, and then as he squeezed the prisoner's arm he
added, 'I don't wish the other man any harm, but if by chance
that wonderful escape of yours materializes, I know a respected
officer in the Prison Service who will not be heartbroken.'</p>

<p>Manfred nodded, and as he stepped into the train he said:</p>

<p>'That lady&mdash;if you see her, tell her I am gone.'</p>

<p>'I will&mdash;but I'm afraid I may not tell her where.'</p>

<p>'That is at your discretion,' said Manfred as the train moved
off. The warders drew down the blinds, and Manfred composed
himself to sleep.</p>

<p>He woke with the chief warder's hand on his arm and stepped
out on to the platform as the day was breaking. His quick eye
searched the advertisement boards on the station. He would have
done this ordinarily, because they would tell him where he was,
supposing for some reason the authorities had wished to keep his
destination a secret from him. But he had a particular interest
in advertising just then. The station was smothered with the
bills of a travelling cheap jack&mdash;an unusual class of
advertisement for the austere notice boards of a railway station.
Huge flaming posters that said 'Everything is Right', and in
smaller type underneath 'Up to-date'. Little bills that said,
'Write to your cousin in London... and tell her that Gipsy Jack's
bargain,' etc. 'Go by the book!' said another. Marching down the
stairs he observed opposite the station yet further evidence of
this extravagant cheap jack's caprice, for there were big
illuminated signs in evidence, all to the same effect. In the
shuttered darkness of the cab, Manfred smiled broadly. There was
really no limit to the ingenuity of Leon Gonsalez. Next morning
when the governor of Chelmsford Gaol visited him, Manfred
expressed his intention of writing a letter to his
cousin&mdash;in London.</p>

<p>'Did you see him?' asked Poiccart.</p>

<p>'Just a glimpse,' said Leon. He walked over to the window of
the room and looked out. Right in front of him rose the grim
facade of the gaol. He walked back to the table and poured
himself out a cup of tea. It was not yet six o'clock, but he had
been up the greater part of the night.</p>

<p>'The Home Secretary,' he said between gasps as he drank the
scalding hot liquid, 'is indiscreet in his correspondence and is
generally a most careless man.' It was apropos of Manfred's
coming.</p>

<p>'I have made two visits to the right honourable gentleman's
house in this past fortnight, and I am bursting with startling
intelligence. Do you know that Willington, the President of the
Board of Trade, has had an "affair", and that a junior Lord of
the Admiralty drinks like a sponge, and the Chancellor hates the
War Secretary, who will talk all the time, and&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Keeps a diary?' asked Poiccart, and the other nodded.</p>

<p>'A diary full of thousands of pounds' worth of gossip, locked
with a sixpenny-ha'penny lock. His house is fitted with the
Magno-Sellie system of burglar alarms, and he keeps three
servants.'</p>

<p>'You are almost encyclopedic,' said Poiccart.</p>

<p>'My dear Poiccart,' said Leon resentfully, 'you have got a
trick of accepting the most wonderful information from me without
paying me the due of adopting the following flattering attitudes:
primary, incredulous surprise; secondary, ecstatic wonder;
tertiary, admiration blended with awe.'</p>

<p>Poiccart laughed outright: an unusual circumstance.</p>

<p>'I have ceased to wonder at your cleverness, illustrious,' he
said, speaking in Spanish, the language these two men invariably
used when alone.</p>

<p>'All these things are beyond me,' Poiccart went on, 'yet no
man can say for all my slow brain that I am a sluggard in
action.'</p>

<p>Leon smiled.</p>

<p>The work of the last few weeks had fallen heavily on them
both. It was no light task, the preparation of Three Months in
Morocco. The first word of every seventh paragraph formed the
message that he had to convey to Manfred &mdash;and it was a long
message. There was the task of printing it, arranging the
immediate publication, the placing of the book in the list, and
generally thrusting it under the noses of an unappreciative
public. As sailors store life-belts for possible contingencies,
so, in every country had the Four Just Men stored the equipment
of rescue against their need. Poiccart, paying many flying visits
to the Midlands, brought back with him from time to time strange
parts of machinery. The lighter he carried with his luggage, the
heavier parts he smuggled into Chelmsford in a strongly-built
motor-car.</p>

<p>The detached house facing the prison was fortunately for sale,
and the agent who conducted the rapid negotiations that resulted
in its transfer had let fall the information that the clients
hoped to establish a garage on the Colchester Road that would
secure a sensible proportion of the Essex motor traffic. The
arrival of two rough-painted chassis supported this view of the
new owners' business. They were enterprising people, these new
arrivals, and it was an open secret 'on the road', that Gipsy
Jack, whose caravan was under distress, and in the hands of the
bailiff, had found financial support at their hands. Albeit Jack
protested vigorously at the ridiculous suggestion that he should
open in Chelmsford at an unpropitious season, and sniffed
contemptuously at the extravagant billing of the town. Nor did he
approve of the wording of the posters, which struck him as being
milder than the hilarious character of his business-entertainment
called for.</p>

<p>'Them Heckfords are going to make a failure,' said Mr. Peter
Sweeney in the bosom of his family. He occupied 'Faith Home', an
ornate villa on the Colchester Road. Before his momentous
conception of the 'Rational Faithers', it had borne the more
imposing title of 'Palace Lodge', this by the way.</p>

<p>'They've got no business ability, and they're a bit gone on
the sherbet.' For a high-priest of a new cult, Peter's language
was neither pure nor refined. 'And they haven't got the common
politeness of pigs,' he added ambiguously. 'I took the petition
there today,' Peter went on indignantly, 'and the chap that come
to the door! Oh, what a sight! Looked as if he'd been up all
night, eyes red, face white, and all of a shake.'</p>

<p>'"Good mornin', Mr. Heckford," says I, "I've come about the
petition."</p>

<p>'"What petition?" says he.</p>

<p>'"The petition for the poor creature now lyin' in Chelmsford,"
says I, "under sentence of death&mdash;which is legal murder," I
says.</p>

<p>'"Go to the devil" he says; they were his exact words, "Go to
the devil." I was that upset that I walked straight away from the
door&mdash;he didn't even ask me in&mdash;an' just as I got to
the bottom of the front garden, he shouts, "What do you want him
reprieved for&mdash;hasn't he left you a pot of money?"'</p>

<p>Mr. Peter Sweeney was very much agitated as he repeated this
callous piece of cynicism.</p>

<p>'That idea,' said Peter solemnly and impressively, 'Must Not
be Allowed to Grow.'</p>

<p>It was to give the lie to the wicked suggestion that Peter
arranged his daily demonstration, from twelve to two. There had
been such functions before, 'Mass' meetings with brass bands at
the very prison gates, but they were feeble mothers' meetings
compared to these demonstrations on behalf of Manfred.</p>

<p>The memory of the daily 'service' is too fresh in the minds of
the public, and particularly the Chelmsford public, to need any
description here. Crowds of three thousand people were the rule,
and Peter's band blared incessantly, whilst Peter himself grew
hoarse from the effect of railing his denunciation of the
barbarous methods of a medieval system.</p>

<p>Heckford Brothers, the new motor-car firm, protested against
the injury these daily paraders were inflicting on their
business. That same dissipated man, looking more dissipated than
ever, who had been so rude to him, called upon Peter and
threatened him with injunctions. This merely had the effect of
stiffening Peter Sweeney's back, and next day the meeting lasted
three hours.</p>

<p>In the prison, the pandemonium that went on outside penetrated
even to the seclusion of Manfred's cell, and he was
satisfied.</p>

<p>The local police were loath to interfere and reopen the
desperate quarrel that had centred around such demonstrations
before.</p>

<p>So Peter triumphed, and the crowd of idlers that flocked to
the midday gathering grew in proportion as the interest in the
condemned man's fate arose.</p>

<p>And the augmented band blared and the big drum boomed the
louder and Rational Faith gained many new converts.</p>

<p>A sightseer, attracted by curiosity, was standing on the
fringe of the crowd one day. He could not see the band from where
he stood but he made a remarkable observation; it was nothing
less than a gross reflection upon a valued member of the
orchestra.</p>

<p>'That chap,' said this unknown critic, 'is beating out of
time&mdash;or else there's two drums going.'</p>

<p>The man to whom he addressed his remarks listened attentively,
and agreed.</p>

<p>The crowd had swayed back to the railings before the premises
of the motor manufacturers, and as it dispersed&mdash;Peter's
party 'processed' magnificently to the town before breaking
up&mdash;one of the new tenants came to the door and stood,
watching the melting crowd. He overheard this remark concerning
the big drummer's time, and it vexed him. When he came back to
the sitting-room, where a pallid Poiccart lay supinely on a
couch, he said:</p>

<p>'We must be careful,' and repeated the conversation.</p>

<p>Until six o'clock these men rested&mdash;as men must rest who
have been working under a monstrous pressure of air&mdash;then
they went to clear away the results of their working.</p>

<p>At midnight they ceased, and washed away the stains of their
labours.</p>

<p>'Luckily,' said Poiccart, 'we have many rooms to fill yet; the
drawing-room can hold little more, the dining-room we need, the
morning-room is packed. We must start upstairs tomorrow.'</p>

<p>As the work proceeded, the need for caution became more and
more apparent; but no accident marred their progress, and three
days before the date fixed for the execution, the two men, coming
to their barely furnished living-room, looked at each other
across the uncovered table that separated them, and sighed
thankfully, for the work was almost finished.</p>

<p>'Those fellows,' said Mr. Peter Sweeney, 'are not so Bad as I
thought they was. One of 'em come to me today and Apologized. He
was lookin' better too, and offered to sign the petition.' Peter
always gave you the impression in speaking that he was using
words that began with capital letters.</p>

<p>'Pa,' said his son, who had a mind that dealt in material
issues, 'what are you going to do with Manfred's money?'</p>

<p>His parent looked at him sternly.</p>

<p>'I shall Devote it to the Cause,' he said shortly.</p>

<p>'That's you, ain't it?' asserted the innocent child.</p>

<p>Peter disdained to answer.</p>

<p>'These young men,' he went on, 'might do worse than they have
done. They are more business-like than I thought, darker, the
town electrician, tells me that they had got a power current in
their works, they have got a little gas-engine too, and from the
way one of them was handling a big car today on the London road,
it strikes me they know something about the business of motor-car
running.'</p>

<p>Gonsalez, coming back from a trial trip on his noisy car, had
to report a disquieting circumstance.</p>

<p>'She's here,' he said, as he was washing the grime from his
hands.</p>

<p>Poiccart looked up from his work&mdash;he was heating
something in a crucible over an electric stove.</p>

<p>'The Woman of Gratz?' he asked.</p>

<p>Leon nodded.</p>

<p>'That is natural,' Poiccart said, and went on with his
experiment.</p>

<p>'She saw me,' said Leon calmly.</p>

<p>'Oh!' said the other, unconcerned. 'Manfred said&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That she would betray no more&mdash;I believe that, and
George asked us to be good to her, that is a command.'</p>

<p>(There was a great deal more in Manfred's letter to 'his
cousin in London' than met the governor's eye.)</p>

<p>'She is an unhappy woman,' said Gonsalez gravely; 'it was
pitiable to see her at Wandsworth, where she stood day after day
with those tragic eyes of hers on the ugly gate of the prison;
here, with the result of her work in sight, she must be suffering
the tortures of the damned.'</p>

<p>'Then tell her,' said Poiccart.</p>

<p>'That&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That George will escape.'</p>

<p>'I thought of that. I think George would wish it.'</p>

<p>'The Red Hundred has repudiated her,' Leon went on. 'We were
advised of that yesterday; I am not sure that she is not under
sentence. You remember Herr Schmidt, he of the round face? It was
he who denounced her.'</p>

<p>Poiccart nodded and looked up thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'Schmidt&mdash;Schmidt,' he puzzled. 'Oh yes&mdash;there is
something against him, a cold-blooded murder, was it not?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Leon very quietly, and they did not speak again of
Herr Schmidt of Prague. Poiccart was dipping thin glass rods into
the seething, bubbling contents of the crucible, and Leon watched
idly.</p>

<p>'Did she speak?' Poiccart asked after a long interval of
silence.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>Another silence, and then Leon resumed:</p>

<p>'She was not sure of me&mdash;but I made her the sign of the
Red Hundred. I could not speak to her in the open street.
Falmouth's people were in all probability watching her day and
night. You know the old glove trick for giving the hour of
assignation. Drawing on the glove slowly and stopping to admire
the fit of one, two, or three fingers... so I signalled to her to
meet me in three hours' time.'</p>

<p>'Where?'</p>

<p>'At Wivenhoe&mdash;that was fairly simple too... imagine me
leaning over the side of the car to demand of the willing
bystanders how long it would take me to reach Wivenhoe&mdash;the
last word loudly&mdash;would it take me three hours? Whilst they
volunteered their counsel, I saw her signal of assent.'</p>

<p>Poiccart hummed as he worked.</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;are you going?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I am,' said the other, and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>After midnight, Poiccart, dozing in his chair, heard the
splutter and the Gatling-gun explosions of the car as it turned
into the extemporized garage.</p>

<p>'Well?' he asked as Leon entered.</p>

<p>'She's gone,' said Gonsalez with a sigh of relief. 'It was a
difficult business, and I had to lie to her&mdash;we cannot
afford the risk of betrayal. Like the remainder of the Red
Hundred, she clings to the idea that we have thousands of people
in our organization; she accepted my story of storming the prison
with sheer brute force. She wanted to stay, but I told her that
she would spoil everything&mdash;she leaves for the continent
tomorrow.'</p>

<p>'She has no money, of course,' said Poiccart with a yawn.</p>

<p>'None&mdash;the Red Hundred has stopped supplies&mdash;but I
gave her &mdash;'</p>

<p>'Naturally,' said Poiccart.</p>

<p>'It was difficult to persuade her to take it; she was like a
mad thing between her fear of George, her joy at the news I gave
her&mdash;and remorse.</p>

<p>'I think,' he went on seriously, 'that she had an affection
for George.'</p>

<p>Poiccart looked at him.</p>

<p>'You surprise me,' he said ironically, and went to bed.</p>

<p>Day found them working. There was machinery to be dismantled,
a heavy open door to be fixed, new tires to be fitted to the big
car. An hour before the midday demonstration came a knock at the
outer door. Leon answered it and found a polite chauffeur. In the
roadway stood a car with a solitary occupant.</p>

<p>The chauffeur wanted petrol; he had run himself dry. His
master descended from the car and came forward to conduct the
simple negotiation. He dismissed the mechanic with a word.</p>

<p>'There are one or two questions I would like to ask about my
car,' he said distinctly.</p>

<p>'Come inside, sir,' said Leon, and ushered the man into the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>He closed the door and turned on the fur-clad visitor.</p>

<p>'Why did you come?' he asked quickly; 'it is terribly
dangerous&mdash;for you.'</p>

<p>'I know,' said the other easily, 'but I thought there might be
something I could do&mdash;what is the plan?'</p>

<p>In a few words Leon told him, and the young man shivered.</p>

<p>'A gruesome experience for George,' he said.</p>

<p>'It's the only way,' replied Leon, 'and George has nerves like
ice.'</p>

<p>'And after&mdash;you're leaving that to chance?'</p>

<p>'You mean where shall we make for&mdash;the sea, of course.
There is a good road between here and Clacton, and the boat lies
snug between there and Walton.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said the young man, and he made a suggestion.</p>

<p>'Excellent&mdash;but you?' said Leon.</p>

<p>'I shall be all right?' said the cheerful visitor.</p>

<p>'By the way, have you a telegraph map of this part of the
world?'</p>

<p>Leon unlocked a drawer and took out a folded paper.</p>

<p>'If you would arrange that,' he said, 'I should be
grateful.'</p>

<p>The man who called himself Courtlander marked the plan with a
pencil.</p>

<p>'I have men who may be trusted to the very end,' he said. 'The
wires shall be cut at eight o'clock, and Chelmsford shall be
isolated from the world.'</p>

<p>Then, with a tin of petrol in his hand, he walked back to his
car.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16">XVI.&mdash;THE EXECUTION</a></h2>

<p class="first">IF you pass through the little door that leads
to the porter's lodge (the door will be locked and bolted behind
you) your conductor will pass you through yet another door into a
yard that is guarded by the ponderous doors of the prison at the
one end and by a big steel gate at the other. Through this gate
you reach another courtyard, and bearing to the right, you come
to a flight of stone steps that bring you to the governor's tiny
office. If you go straight along the narrow passage from which
the office opens, descend a flight of stairs at the other end,
through a well-guarded doorway, you come suddenly into the great
hall of the prison. Here galleries run along both sides of the
hall, and steel gangways and bridges span the width at intervals.
Here, too, polished stairways criss-cross, and the white face of
the two long walls of the hall are pitted with little black
doors.</p>

<p>On the ground floor, the first cell on the right as you enter
the hall from the governor's office is larger and more commodious
than its fellows. There is, too, a suspicion of comfort in the
strip of matting that covers the floor, in the naked gaslight
which flares in its wire cage by day and night, in the table and
chair, and the plain comfortable bed. This is the condemned cell.
A dozen paces from its threshold is a door that leads to another
part of the yard, and a dozen more paces along the flagged
pathway brings you to a little unpretentious one-storeyed house
without windows, and a doorway sufficiently wide to allow two men
to pass abreast. There is a beam where a rope may be made fast,
and a trapdoor, and a brick-lined pit, coloured with a
salmon-pink distemper.</p>

<p>From his cell, Manfred was an interested listener, as day by
day the uproar of the demonstration before the gates
increased.</p>

<p>He found in the doctor who visited him daily a gentleman of
some wit. In a sense, he replaced the governor of Wandsworth as
an intellectual companion, for the master of Chelmsford was a
reserved man, impregnated with the traditions of the system. To
the doctor, Manfred confided his private opinion of the 'Rational
Faithers'.</p>

<p>'But why on earth have you left them so much money?' asked the
surprised medico.</p>

<p>'Because I dislike cranks and narrow, foolish people most
intensely,' was the cryptic reply.</p>

<p>'This Sweeney&mdash;' he went on.</p>

<p>'How did you hear of Sweeney?' asked the doctor.</p>

<p>'Oh, one hears,' said Manfred carelessly. 'Sweeney had an
international reputation; besides,' he added, not moving a muscle
of his face, 'I know about everybody.'</p>

<p>'Me, for instance?' challenged the man of medicine.</p>

<p>'You,' repeated Manfred wisely. 'From the day you left Clifton
to the day you married the youngest Miss Arbuckle of
Chertsey.'</p>

<p>'Good Lord!' gasped the doctor.</p>

<p>'It isn't surprising, is it,' explained Manfred, 'that for
quite a long time I have taken an interest in the various staffs
of the prisons within reach of London?'</p>

<p>'I suppose it isn't,' said the other. None the less he was
impressed.</p>

<p>Manfred's life in Chelmsford differed in a very little degree
from his life in Wandsworth.</p>

<p>The routine of prison life remained the same: the daily
exercises, the punctilious visits of governor, doctor and
chaplain.</p>

<p>On one point Manfred was firm. He would receive no spiritual
ministrations, he would attend no service. He made his position
clear to the scandalized chaplain.</p>

<p>'You do not know to what sect I am attached,' he said,
'because I have refused to give any information upon that point.
I feel sure you have no desire to proselytize or convert me from
my established beliefs.'</p>

<p>'What are your beliefs?' asked the chaplain.</p>

<p>'That,' said Manfred, 'is my own most secret knowledge, and
which I do not intend sharing with any man.'</p>

<p>'But you cannot die like a heathen,' said the clergyman in
horror.</p>

<p>'Point of view is everything,' was the calm rejoinder, 'and I
am perfectly satisfied with the wholesomeness of my own; in
addition to which,' he added, 'I am not going to die just yet,
and being aware of this, I shrink from accepting from good men
the sympathy and thought which I do not deserve.'</p>

<p>To the doctor he was a constant source of wonder, letting fall
surprising items of news mysteriously acquired.</p>

<p>'Where he gets his information from, puzzles me, sir,' he
confessed to the governor. 'The men who are guarding
him&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Are above suspicion,' said the governor promptly.</p>

<p>'He gets no newspapers?'</p>

<p>'No, only the books he requires. He expressed a desire the
other day for Three Months in Morocco, said he had half finished
it when he was at Wandsworth, and wanted to read it again to
"make sure"&mdash;so I got it.'</p>

<p>Three days before the date fixed for the execution, the
governor had informed Manfred that, despite the presentation of a
petition, the Home Secretary saw no reason for advising the
remission of the sentence.</p>

<p>'I never expected a reprieve,' he replied without emotion.</p>

<p>He spent much of his time chatting with the two warders.
Strict sense of duty forced them to reply in monosyllables, but
he interested them keenly with his talk of the strange places of
the world. As far as they could, they helped him pass the time,
and he appreciated their restricted tightness.</p>

<p>'You are named Perkins,' he said one day.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the warder.</p>

<p>'And you're Franklin,' he said to the other, and the man
replied in the affirmative. Manfred nodded.</p>

<p>'When I am at liberty,' he said, 'I will make you some
recompense for your exemplary patience.'</p>

<p>At exercise on the Monday&mdash;Tuesday was the fatal day
fixed by the High Sheriff&mdash;he saw a civilian walking in the
yard and recognized him, and on his return to his cell he
requested to see the governor.</p>

<p>'I would like to meet Mr. Jessen,' he said when the officer
came, and the governor demurred.</p>

<p>'Will you be good enough to refer my request to the Home
Secretary by telegraph?' asked Manfred, and the governor promised
that he would.</p>

<p>To his surprise, an immediate reply gave the necessary
permission.</p>

<p>Jessen stepped into the cell and nodded pleasantly to the man
who sat on the edge of the couch.</p>

<p>'I wanted to speak to you, Jessen,' Manfred said, and motioned
him to a seat. 'I wanted to put the business of Starque right,
once and for all.' Jessen smiled.</p>

<p>'That was all right&mdash;it was an order signed by the Czar
and addressed personally to me&mdash;I could do no less than hang
him,' he said.</p>

<p>'Yet you may think,' Manfred went on, 'that we took you for
this work because&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I know why I was taken,' said the quiet Jessen. 'Starque and
Francois were within the law, condemned by the law, and you
strike only at those the law has missed.'</p>

<p>Then Manfred inquired after the Guild, and Jessen
brightened.</p>

<p>'The Guild is flourishing,' he said cheerfully. 'I am now
converting the luggage thieves&mdash;you know, the men who haunt
railway stations.'</p>

<p>'Into&mdash;?' asked the other.</p>

<p>'The real thing&mdash;the porters they sometimes impersonate,'
said the enthusiast, and added dolefully, 'It's terribly uphill
business though, getting characters for the men who want to go
straight and have only a ticket of leave to identify them.' As he
rose to go, Manfred shook hands.</p>

<p>'Don't lose heart,' he said.</p>

<p>'I shall see you again,' said Jessen, and Manfred smiled.</p>

<p>Again, if you grow weary of that repetition 'Manfred smiled',
remember that the two words best describe his attitude in those
dreadful days in Chelmsford.</p>

<p>There was no trace of flippancy in his treatment of the
oppressing situation. His demeanour on the occasions when he met
the chaplain was one to which the most sensitive could take no
exception, but the firmness was insuperable.</p>

<p>'It is impossible to do anything with him,' said the
despairing minister. 'I am the veriest child in his hands. He
makes me feel like a lay preacher interviewing Socrates.'</p>

<p>There was no precedent for the remarkable condition of
affairs, and finally, at Manfred's request, it was decided to
omit the ceremony of the religious service altogether.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, taking his exercise, he lifted his eyes
skyward, and the warders, following his gaze, saw in the air a
great yellow kite, bearing a banner that advertised some brand or
other of motor tires.</p>

<p>'Yellow kite, all right,' he improvised, and hummed a tune as
he marched round the stone circle.</p>

<p>That night, after he had retired to rest, they took away his
prison clothes and returned the suit in which he had been
arrested. He thought he heard the measured tramping of feet as he
dozed, and wondered if the Government had increased the guard of
the prison. Under his window the step of the sentry sounded
brisker and heavier.</p>

<p>'Soldiers,' he guessed, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>He was accurate in his surmise. At the eleventh hour had
arisen a fear of rescue, and half a battalion of guards had
arrived by train in the night and held the prison.</p>

<p>The chaplain made his last effort, and received an unexpected
rebuff, unexpected because of the startling warmth with which it
was delivered.</p>

<p>'I refuse to see you,' stormed Manfred. It was the first
exhibition of impatience he had shown.</p>

<p>'Have I not told you that I will not lend myself to the
reduction of a sacred service to a farce? Can you not understand
that I must have a very special reason for behaving as I do, or
do you think I am a sullen boor rejecting your kindness out of
pure perversity?'</p>

<p>'I did not know what to think,' said the chaplain sadly, and
Manfred's voice softened as he replied:</p>

<p>'Reserve your judgement for a few hours&mdash;then you will
know.'</p>

<p>The published accounts of that memorable morning are to the
effect that Manfred ate very little, but the truth is that he
partook of a hearty breakfast, saying, 'I have a long journey
before me, and need my strength.'</p>

<p>At five minutes to eight a knot of journalists and warders
assembled outside the cell door, a double line of warders formed
across the yard, and the extended line of soldiers that circled
the prison building stood to attention. At a minute to eight came
Jessen with the straps of office in his hand. Then with the clock
striking the hour, the governor beckoning Jessen, entered the
cell.</p>

<p>Simultaneously and in a dozen different parts of the country,
the telegraph wires which connect Chelmsford with the rest of the
world were cut.</p>

<p>It was a tragic procession, robbed a little of its horror by
the absence of the priest, but sufficiently dreadful. Manfred,
with strapped hands, followed the governor, a warder at each arm,
and Jessen walking behind. They guided him to the little house
without windows and stood him on a trap and drew back, leaving
the rest to Jessen. Then, as Jessen put his hand to his pocket,
Manfred spoke.</p>

<p>'Stand away for a moment,' he said; 'before the rope is on my
neck I have something to say,' and Jessen stood back. 'It is,'
said Manfred slowly, 'farewell!'</p>

<p>As he spoke he raised his voice, and Jessen stooped to pick up
the coil of rope that dragged on the floor. Then without warning,
before the rope was raised, or any man could touch him, the trap
fell with a crash and Manfred shot out of sight.</p>

<p>Out of sight indeed, for from the pit poured up a dense volume
of black smoke, that sent the men at the edge reeling and
coughing backwards to the open air.</p>

<p>'What is it? What is it?' a frantic official struggled through
the press at the door and shouted an order.</p>

<p>'Quick! the fire hose!'</p>

<p>The clanging of a bell sent the men to their stations. 'He is
in the pit,' somebody cried, but a man came with a smoke helmet
and went down the side. He was a long time gone, and when he
returned he told his story incoherently.</p>

<p>'The bottom of the pit's been dug out&mdash;there's a passage
below and a door&mdash;the smoke&mdash;I stopped that, it's a
smoke cartridge!'</p>

<p>The chief warder whipped a revolver from his holster.</p>

<p>'This way,' he shouted, and went down the dangling rope hand
over hand.</p>

<p>It was dark, but he felt his way; he slipped down the sharp
declivity where the tunnel dipped beneath the prison wall and the
men behind him sprawled after him. Then without warning he ran
into an obstacle and went down bruised and shaken.</p>

<p>One of the last men down had brought a lamp, and the light of
it came flickering along the uneven passage. The chief warder
shouted for the man to hurry.</p>

<p>By the light he saw that what confronted him was a massive
door made of unpainted deal and clamped with iron. A paper
attracted his attention. It was fastened to the door, and he
lifted the lantern to read it:</p>

<p>'The tunnel beyond this point is mined.'</p>

<p>That was all it said.</p>

<p>'Get back to the prison,' ordered the warder sharply. Mine or
no mine, he would have gone on, but he saw that the door was well
nigh impregnable.</p>

<p>He came back to the light stained with clay and sweating with
his exertions.</p>

<p>'Gone!' he reported curtly; 'if we can get the men out on the
roads and surround the town&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That has been done,' said the governor, 'but there's a crowd
in front of the prison, and we've lost three minutes getting
through.'</p>

<p>He had a grim sense of humour, this fierce silent old man, and
he turned on the troubled chaplain.</p>

<p>'I should imagine that you know why he didn't want the service
now?'</p>

<p>'I know,' said the minister simply, 'and knowing, I am
grateful.'</p>

<p>Manfred felt himself caught in a net, deft hands loosened the
straps at his wrists and lifted him to his feet. The place was
filled with the pungent fumes of smoke.</p>

<p>'This way.'</p>

<p>Poiccart, going ahead, flashed the rays of his electric lamp
over the floor. They took the slope with one flying leap, and
stumbled forward as they landed; reaching the open door, they
paused whilst Leon crashed it closed and slipped the steel bolts
into their places.</p>

<p>Poiccart's lamp showed the smoothly cut sides of the tunnel,
and at the other end they had to climb the debris of dismantled
machinery.</p>

<p>'Not bad,' said Manfred, viewing the work critically. 'The
"Rational Faithers" were useful,' he added. Leon nodded.</p>

<p>'But for their band you could have heard the drills working in
the prison,' he said breathlessly.</p>

<p>Up a ladder at the end they raced, into the earth strewn
'dining-room' through the passage, inches thick with trodden
clay.</p>

<p>Leon held the thick coat for him and he slipped into it.
Poiccart started the motor.</p>

<p>'Right!' They were on the move thumping and jolting through a
back lane that joined the main road five hundred yards below the
prison.</p>

<p>Leon, looking back, saw the specks of scarlet struggling
through the black crowds at the gates. 'Soldiers to hold the
roads,' he said; 'we're just in time&mdash;let her rip,
Poiccart.'</p>

<p>It was not until they struck the open country that Poiccart
obeyed, and then the great racer leapt forward, and the rush of
wind buffeted the men's faces with great soft blows.</p>

<p>Once in the loneliest part of the road they came upon
telegraph wires that trailed in the hedge.</p>

<p>Leon's eyes danced at the sight of it.</p>

<p>'If they've cut the others, the chase is over,' he said;
'they'll have cars out in half an hour and be following us; we
are pretty sure to attract attention, and they'll be able to
trace us.'</p>

<p>Attract attention they certainly did, for leaving Colchester
behind, they ran into a police trap, and a gesticulating
constable signalled them to stop.</p>

<p>They left him behind in a thick cloud of dust. Keeping to the
Clacton road, they had a clear run till they reached a deserted
strip where a farm wagon had broken down and blocked all
progress.</p>

<p>A grinning wagoner saw their embarrassment.</p>

<p>'You cairn't pass here, mister,' he said gleefully, 'and there
ain't another road for two miles back.'</p>

<p>'Where are your horses?' asked Leon quickly.</p>

<p>'Back to farm,' grinned the man.</p>

<p>'Good,' said Leon. He looked round, there was nobody in
sight.</p>

<p>'Go back there with the car,' he said, and signalled Poiccart
to reverse the engine.</p>

<p>'What for?'</p>

<p>Leon was out of the car, walking with quick steps to the
lumbering wreck in the road.</p>

<p>He stooped down, made a swift examination, and thrust
something beneath the huge bulk. He lit a match, steadied the
flame, and ran backward, clutching the slow-moving yokel and
dragging him with him.</p>

<p>"Ere, wot's this?' demanded the man, but before he could reply
there was a deafening crash, like a clap of thunder, and the air
was filled with wreckage.</p>

<p>Leon made a second examination and called the car forward.</p>

<p>As he sprang into his seat he turned to the dazed rustic.</p>

<p>'Tell your master that I have taken the liberty of dynamiting
his cart,' he said; and then, as the man made a movement as if to
clutch his arm, Leon gave him a push which sent him flying, and
the car jolted over the remainder of the wagon.</p>

<p>The car turned now in the direction of Walton, and after a
short run, turned sharply toward the sea.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later two cars thundered along the same road,
stopping here and there for the chief warder to ask the question
of the chance-met pedestrian.</p>

<p>They too swung round to the sea and followed the cliff
road.</p>

<p>'Look!' said a man.</p>

<p>Right ahead, drawn up by the side of the road, was a car. It
was empty.</p>

<p>They sprang out as they reached it&mdash;half a dozen warders
from each car. They raced across the green turf till they came to
the sheer edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>There was no sign of the fugitive.</p>

<p>The serene blue of sea was unbroken, save where, three miles
away, a beautiful white steam yacht was putting out to sea.</p>

<p>Attracted by the appearance of the warders, a little crowd
came round them.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said a wondering fisherman, 'I seed 'em, three of 'em
went out in one of they motor boats that go like
lightenin'&mdash;they're out o' sight by now.'</p>

<p>'What ship is that?' asked the chief warder quickly and
pointed to the departing yacht.</p>

<p>The fisherman removed his pipe and answered: 'That's the Royal
Yacht.'</p>

<p>'What Royal Yacht?'</p>

<p>'The Prince of the Escorials,' said the fisherman
impressively.</p>

<p>The chief warder groaned.</p>

<p>'Well, they can't be on her!' he said.</p>
