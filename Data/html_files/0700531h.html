<h2><a name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I - Prologue</h2>

<p>Thomas Livingstone* Mitchell was born at Craigend, Stirlingshire,
Scotland, on 15 June 1792, and was baptized three days later.[1] There
is some evidence that his parents were neither prosperous nor socially
influential; but he was able to obtain, from some source, money for the
purchase of a commission and later for his marriage.[2]</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* This name has been variously spelt, but on the
certificate of baptism it is shown as above, as it was in his own
signature sixty-two years later.]</blockquote>

<p>There is clear evidence in later life that he had received a good
education, also some evidence that he had, while quite young, some skill
as an artist. On the other hand, there is no evidence that he had, in his
early life, experience in surveying which was to be his occupation in the
army and his profession in civil life.</p>

<p>His father died when he was still young; just when is not known, but
it was before he was nineteen years old. At the age of seventeen he
"managed" Rumford Colliery for his uncle Alexander Livingston of Parkhall
and rendered a claim for payment for this service.[3] As an early
indication of his meticulous care in appraising the value of his
services, the claim was for three months and nineteen days at &pound;120
per annum--the amount being &pound;36 9s. 10d.: in making this claim he
indicated in plain terms that he had no hope of help or consideration
from the person concerned. His father's name was John Mitchell and his
mother had been Janet Wilson; he had at least two brothers, Houston and
John. Houston will appear later in this story. John became a merchant in
Leith and published various works, including <i>Illustrations of the
Runic Literature of Scandinavia</i> (1863).[4]</p>

<p>Mitchell's military career will be described in the next chapter.
While still a lieutenant, and while engaged in the survey of battle sites
in Portugal and Spain, he married, on 10 June 1818, Mary Blunt, the
daughter of General Blunt, an English general serving with the Portuguese
army.</p>

<p>In connexion with this marriage some items of intrinsic interest
deserve to be recorded. Just before the marriage Mitchell serenaded his
lady under her window at Lisbon. As an example of the romantic standards
of the time, the text was as follows:</p>

<pre>
A SERENADE[5]

Sung to the tune "Tweedside" and accompanied on the guitar by
Senor Vigo Rabaglio under Miss Blunt's window
at Lisbon, at 2 a.m., May 1818.

1

Can music awake you fair maid
Oh! are those bright eyes hid in sleep
Ah! hear how in night's sable shade
I come to your windows to weep
Not the stars now above me displayed
Nor Cynthia shining so fair
Nor the dew on the orange-flow'r blade
Can with thee in brightness compare.

2

Ah! could I but tell you my pain
'Twould ease the sore wound in my breast
But to Mary the tale would be vain
She sleeps for her heart is at rest
Cupid! bear to her pillow my strain
A balm to the wound you impart
Say a captive is galled with his chain
And your arrow strike deep in her heart.
</pre>

<p>A marriage settlement was drawn up in June 1818.[6] General Blunt was
to find &pound;3,000, and Lieutenant Thomas Mitchell &pound;2,000, both
amounts to be paid into a trust fund, the interest--but not the
capital--o be paid regularly by the trustees to Mitchell and his wife.
The deed of settlement contains this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>In witness thereof the undersigned have drawn up the present
writing in good faith, no lawyers being resident to execute the same--the
undersigned solemnly pledging themselves to sign any other paper to this
effect (the same being necessary) drawn up in regular form, and hereby
declaring that they wish this to be read and acted upon as understood by
common comprehension and not subject to the equivocations which those
versed in law may detect.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell wrote to tell his mother of this marriage, telling her that
Mary Blunt had been born in the West Indies, had gone to England when
three years old, was not quite eighteen when she married</p>

<blockquote>and is not much acquainted with the care of a house, but
considering her age she does very well. She left boarding school in
London about a year ago. The rank of her father and a small settlement,
which will however prove sufficient with economy, and my pay, will enable
us to live in these trying times.[7]</blockquote>

<p>From time to time in this story there will be glimpses of their
private life; but, having regard to the main purpose of this narrative,
it will be sufficient to record evidence of the success of this marriage.
They had twelve children--six sons, Livingstone, Roderick, Murray,
Campbell, Thomas, Richard; and six daughters, Georgina, Maria, Emily,
Camilla, Alicia, Blanche.</p>

<p>Mitchell, writing from London during his second visit to England in
1847 to his son Livingstone, said:</p>

<blockquote>Give my affectionate love to Mamma and say I am most
anxiously awaiting the "arrivals at Deal" in the papers in hopes of
hearing how she is and how all are--I am very lonely here without one of
the family with me. God bless you all Livy, Roddy, Emily, Cammy, Milly,
Tommy, Alice, Dicky, and Blanche.[8]</blockquote>

<p>Georgina and Maria had died young, Murray was dead at the time this
letter was written.</p>

<p>Mitchell's wife, by this time Lady Mitchell, wrote to her husband a
letter without address or date, but probably written some time during the
'forties. She began:</p>

<blockquote>My dearest Mitchell: I was made very happy by your
affectionate letter, and shall endeavour by every means I can to mitigate
the annoyances you meet with in the world.[9]</blockquote>

<p>At one time Lady Mitchell must have suffered a serious illness for Dr
(later Sir) Charles Nicholson wrote to her congratulations on her
recovery and advised her</p>

<blockquote>to take more care than you are usually wont to do of your
health, not to sacrifice your health and strength unnecessarily in
domestic concerns.[10]</blockquote>

<p>During the last years of Mitchell's life he lost two of his elder
sons, Roderick and Campbell, by tragic deaths. At the end, writing within
one year after Mr. Mitchell's death, James Bonwick said of him:</p>

<blockquote>As a parent, a citizen, a gentleman, a scholar, he has
embalmed his memory alike in the archives of philosophy, the annals of
colonial history, the hearts of his friends, and the sanctity of
home.[11]</blockquote>

<p>Nicholson was a medical practitioner in Sydney who was greatly
respected: he was a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales,
and Speaker of that Council intermittently between 1846 and 1856; later
he became the first President of the Legislative Council of Queensland.
He was closely associated with the cause of higher education in New South
Wales and took a prominent part in the founding of the University of
Sydney. He was knighted in 1852 and made a baronet in 1859.</p>

<p>Bonwick was an educationist who came to Australia in 1841, and was
Inspector of Denominational Schools in Victoria from 1856: his hobby was
early Australian history. He wrote, and published in 1856, <i>The
Discovery and Settlement of Port Phillip</i>. He retired and returned to
England, where he spent much time in searching the records in London for
despatches and documents relating to the early history of New South
Wales. This was the material from which came the <i>Historical Records of
New South Wales</i>.</p>

<p>That is enough to give the picture of his private life: there is no
hint of scandal, no lapses such as have marked the careers of other men:
there was, from all the evidence, a normal home life of affectionate
relationships. There were adversities, the death of his sons, the illness
of his wife, financial worries--these things come to all men. Through all
the shifts and changes of public life, all the irritations and
adversities, he kept the friendship of men like Nicholson, Bonwick, and
many others--men highly respected in the community; and he had a wife who
was a faithful comrade all through his troubled career, and who survived
him.</p>

<p>His private life was not unusual, it is his official life which
commands attention as part of our national story.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II - Military Career</h2>

<p>In the preceding chapter it was stated that Mitchell was managing his
uncle's colliery at the age of seventeen years. It will presently be
stated that he was gazetted lieutenant in the in July 1811, when he had
just passed his nineteenth, birthday There is complete uncertainty as to
his activities during the intervening period: the one fact which emerges
as his story proceeds is that he had great natural skill as a
draughtsman, but whether he used this skill for any practical purpose at
this time is not known.</p>

<p>The statement has been repeatedly made in recognized works of
reference that he entered the army as a volunteer when sixteen years old:
the most definite of these is that by Johns in the <i>Australian
Biographical Dictionary</i>:</p>

<blockquote>He entered the Army in 1808 and was A.D.C. to the Duke of
Wellington: was known as "the Duke's famous draughtsman".</blockquote>

<p><i>The Dictionary of National Biography</i> states that he entered the
army as a volunteer.[1]</p>

<p>It is necessary to examine these statements with some care. If, as
Johns states, he entered the army in 1808 he would be only sixteen years
old, but he was managing his uncle's colliery when he was seventeen, so
that statement is probably incorrect: the other two may be regarded with
equal reserve. As to the statement that he entered the army at some stage
during this period of uncertainty, the evidence is inconclusive.</p>

<p>The term "volunteer" had, at that time, a more restricted and specific
meaning than it has now. A volunteer was one who served as a junior
officer, without pay, so that he might establish some claim to a
commission without having to provide the large amount of money which was
necessary to purchase even the lowest order of commission. Sir Charles
Oman, the standard authority on the British army of this period has
described the position:</p>

<blockquote>In addition to the officers regularly commissioned, a
battalion had often with it one or two "volunteers"...young men who were
practically probationers; they were allowed to come out to an active
service battalion on the chance of being gazetted to it without purchase
on their own responsibility. They carried muskets and served in the
ranks, but were allowed to wear uniforms of a better cloth than that
given to the rank and file, and messed with the officers.[2]</blockquote>

<p>The first clear evidence is in a draft, or copy, of an application by
Mitchell to the Commander-in-Chief, Sir David Dundas:</p>

<blockquote>Your memorialist, a native of Scotland, aged nineteen, is the
son of respectable parentage now dead:* and has received a liberal and
classical education qualifying him to fulfil the duties of a gentleman
and a soldier.<br>
<br>
Your memorialist ardently desires to enter into the services of his
country in the Army, but has not the immediate means of purchasing a
commission, nor other expectation of success than through the well-known
liberality of Your Excellency.[3]</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* This refers to his father only: his mother was
still alive.]</blockquote>

<p>He stated that he was prepared to serve in any of His Majesty's
regiments, and was anxious for active service where he might "have an
opportunity of evincing his zeal for his country".</p>

<p>This memorial, in the copy which is available, carries neither date
nor address; but it contains some internal evidence. He desired to enter
the army, was anxious for active service, but had neither means to
purchase a commission, nor the influence to secure him one. These
statements are inconsistent with two, or more, years of active service as
a volunteer. There is, moreover, some indirect evidence; from his many
references to events in the Peninsular War the battles before 1811 are
noticeably absent. His young mind could not have remained unimpressed by
Rolica, Vimiero, Talavera, Bussaco, Torres Vedras, Fuentes d'Onoro, and
Albuera--yet his later recorded reminiscences do not extend into this
period. His service later was with the famous Light Brigade and he must
have been stirred, if he had been present then, by memory of the cheers
which greeted the arrival of that brigade after a forced march of
forty-three miles in twenty-two hours at Talavera, nor would he forget
that day at Bussaco when the Light Division under Craufurd was
inflicting, heavy defeat upon Ney against superior numbers.</p>

<p>Mitchell never forgot his experiences in the Peninsula and the absence
of any reference to this period before 1811 is significant: it seems,
therefore, that the statement that he served as a volunteer before
receiving a commission must be regarded as very doubtful. It could, on
present evidence, be established only after patient research amongst the
contemporary muster rolls, a task difficult enough under any
circumstances, but especially difficult because it is not known in which
battalion he is presumed to have served.</p>

<p>The matter is, however, placed beyond reasonable doubt by a document
in the Mitchell Library,[4] bearing Mitchell's own signature, in which he
states that his age on first appointment to the army was nineteen years,
and the date of that appointment was 21 July 1811: this date does not
agree with the official record which dates that appointment as 24 July.
As the document was written when he was sixty-two years old, the
difference of three days is not material. The general evidence here
submitted also negatives the statement in the <i>Australian
Encyclopaedia</i> that he entered the army under the patronage of the
Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>Before leaving this debatable ground it is necessary to dispose of one
statement. One writer has stated that Wellington had entrusted to
Mitchell the task of laying out the lines of the famous fortifications at
Torres Vedras.[5] The statement is absurd. Mitchell was then only
seventeen years old and, as has been suggested above, was not even in the
army. The lines were constructed by Colonel Fletcher, the Chief Engineer,
under Wellington's personal supervision.</p>

<p>Passing now from this uncertain period of two years about which so
little is known, the first definitely fixed point in the story is
Mitchell's gazettal, on 24 July 1811, as a second lieutenant in the First
Battalion of the 95th Regiment of Foot.[6]</p>

<p>As already stated, Mitchell's application for a commission had been
made to Dundas as Commander-in-Chief, the application stating that
Mitchell was then "aged nineteen": as he was not nineteen until 15 June
1811, and Dundas had ceased to be Commander-in-Chief in May of that year,
Mitchell was probably anticipating a little in stating his age as
nineteen. He was, however, commissioned one month after his nineteenth
birthday.</p>

<p>He was extremely fortunate in being posted to the 95th Regiment, one
of the most deservedly famous in the Peninsular army. Captain J. Kincaid,
Mitchell's "old and esteemed friend", wrote of the 95th Regiment:</p>

<blockquote>We were the light regiment of the Light Division and fired
the first and the last shot in almost every battle, siege and skirmish in
which the army was engaged during the war.</blockquote>

<p>This was the first regiment to be armed with the new rifled-bore
weapon in place of the old smooth-bore musket which was still the main
weapon used by the infantry.[7] The 95th, with the 43rd and the 52nd
Regiments, formed the light troops which were the British answer to the
French <i>tirailleurs</i>. These <i>tirailleurs</i> in battle acted as
skirmishers ahead of the main attacking French column, and it was their
function, acting as snipers behind any available cover, to cause disorder
in the waiting British ranks by shooting as many men or officers as they
could. But the activities of the British Light Division were not limited
to such skirmishing functions: they were prominent in many frontal
attacks and fierce close fighting. Their dark green uniform made them a
distinctive group amongst the red jackets of the rest of the army. Their
commander, General Robert Craufurd, unfortunately killed at Ciudad
Rodrigo, was himself a distinctive personality, worthy of this famous
division.</p>

<p>Mitchell, or indeed any other officer or private of that magnificent
Light Division, could well feel, all through his life, pride in his
service with it. But while their courage in battle and their military
efficiency were beyond question, the personal character and behaviour of
the individuals was not always on this high plane. The army, owing to the
conditions of recruitment and service in those days, contained too high a
proportion of loose characters and some criminals.[8] Even their courage
was not always controlled, especially in the earlier stages of the war in
the Peninsula: at Rolica, for example, which was one of Wellington's
earliest battles in Portugal, the riflemen outposts pressed on too far
and were for a while in danger.[9] The loose characters caused Wellington
much worry by stealing from the local residents, and they were
responsible for the disgraceful behaviour of the army after the fall of
Badajoz, Ciudad Rodrigo, and San Sebastian, when drunkenness, murder,
rape, and looting were practically unrestrained. It will presently be
seen that even the 95th were involved in these excesses.</p>

<p>Wellington had arrived in Portugal in April 1809, to take command of
the British army with Lisbon as his headquarters. So complete had been
the Napoleonic domination of Europe that a small strip of the western
coast of Portugal from Corunna to Lisbon was the only ground in all
Europe left for the British army as a base for military operations (<a
href="#m1">Map I</a>). Napoleon had boastfully declared his determination
to drive the British into the sea from even this tenuous hold on the
Continent. The activities under Sir John Moore during 1808 had not
affected the situation as just described.</p>

<p>An initial series of small successes by Wellington added to the
difficulties experienced by the French through long-haul transport. A
hostile population caused the French to retreat, and within four weeks
after Wellington had landed in Lisbon no Frenchmen other than prisoners
and deserters remained in Portugal. But these favourable conditions did
not continue: the French returned in force and Wellington, hampered by
lack of reinforcements and supplies from England as well as by an
unfriendly Parliament at home, was obliged to assume a defensive
strategy, holding the narrow Lisbon peninsula between the Tagus River and
the sea.</p>

<p>This prolonged period of defence culminated in the French attack on
the historic lines of Torres Vedras. When this failed the French decided
to withdraw from Portugal, and by the first week in April 1811, again no
French troops were left in Portugal. So clear and decisive had been the
results of Wellington's clashes with the Napoleonic armies that, for the
first time since Napoleon had begun his triumphal conquest of Europe,
there dawned a hope that the invincible French army was not, after all,
undefeatable. While this hope was slowly rising in Europe Wellington's
own army had no doubts: well equipped, exuberant in victory, they had a
supreme confidence in their great leader which nothing could, or did,
destroy.</p>

<p>But, Portugal now being freed, Wellington was not content to rest
there. The great frontier fortresses of Badajoz and Ciudad Rodrigo on the
western Spanish border remained, and Massena was still loose in Spain
with a large force. Wellington decided to move into Spain. He met and
defeated Massena at Fuentes d'Onoro on 3 May 1811, while Beresford had,
at the same time, met Soult at Albuera and gained a doubtful victory. The
effect of these two field engagements concentrated attention on Ciudad
Rodrigo and Badajoz, to which Wellington now moved.</p>

<p>At this point the known military career of Mitchell begins. The
possibility of service as a volunteer during all this period has already
been discussed and discounted. But his commission in the 95th Regiment
dated from 24 July 1811, and his service began from that date.</p>

<p>The date on which he arrived in Portugal to begin active war service
is not known: the current circumstances important to his personal career
can now, at this stage, be stated. He joined, as a most junior officer, a
regiment of seasoned campaigners proudly conscious of great battle
honours, confident in their superiority under their trusted commander
Craufurd: he became a member of an army which had been hammered into a
condition of high morale and great efficiency by a military genius. As a
young man at the most impressionable age he could not have escaped the
influences of such an environment; the Peninsular veteran was very apt to
have a firm conviction that he was one of a special order of mankind.</p>

<p>Mitchell's commission was almost coincident with the retirement of Sir
David Dundas from the post of Commander-in-Chief and the assumption of
that post by the Duke of York, whose administration became notorious for
patronage, nepotism, and inefficient, if not corrupt, administration. No
officer could remain unaware of, or unaffected by, these conditions.</p>

<p>Wellington was fortunate in having General Sir George Murray (<a href=
"#p1">Plate I</a>) as his Quartermaster General. In the discharge of the
responsible and varied duties of that position Murray proved himself to
be extremely competent. Not only was he responsible for all supplies for
the army, a service which became complicated by Wellington's rapid
movements, but he was responsible for all intelligence work and
especially that of the collection of information about the country over
which the army was expected to move. Officers on headquarters staff, or
those temporarily doing staff duties, were required to travel widely,
often at a distance from the area of active military operations, mapping,
sketching, reporting on roads, bridges, resources, and billeting
facilities in villages and towns. This work became so extensive that it
was found necessary to call on officers, not officially on the staff, to
assist in this work. As it will appear later Mitchell found himself
associated with, and distinguished himself in, these activities.[10]</p>

<p><b>Plate I. Sir George Murray From a painting by Pieter Christoph

</center>

<p>Murray was relieved of his post as Quartermaster General soon after
Mitchell's arrival in the Peninsula: he was "promoted" in 1811 to an
unnecessary post in Ireland to make way for a favourite of the Duke of
York, Colonel James Willoughby Gordon, who, however, proved to be
incompetent and disloyal and was later removed. Murray was reappointed to
his former post in September 1813.</p>

<p>From the time of joining his regiment in Portugal, Mitchell spent his
time partly on service with his regiment and partly on staff duty engaged
in topographical and survey intelligence work: it was during this work
that his skill as a draughtsman and indeed as an artist began to be
recognized. Wyld's <i>Atlas of the Peninsula War</i> contains a sketch
labelled "Affair near El Bodon, 25 September 1811, from the original by
Major Sir T. Mitchell".</p>

<p>Although this affair at El Bodon was a minor conflict it was notable
in that Wellington himself, with his staff, was surrounded by the French
and had literally to fight his way out of real danger.</p>

<p>It is known that Murray before his supersession had intermittently
employed Mitchell on intelligence work so that if this sketch was made at
the time this is the first record of Mitchell at work as an officer in
the army.</p>

<p>The year 1811 closed with a suspension of hostilities for the winter,
but in 1812 Wellington began that series of movements which was to take
him across Spain into France and to the final triumph. He began with an
attack on the fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo without waiting for the end of
the winter. He invested this strong fortress on 8 January 1812, and took
it by assault on 19 January--a success very important to Wellington's
plans, as this stronghold was blocking his proposed north-easterly route
through Spain. Here the Light Division was well in the front line of the
attack and greatly distinguished itself, their commander, Craufurd, being
killed. A party of one hundred volunteers from the 95th Regiment took
part in the actual storming of the breach through which the fortress was
finally taken.</p>

<p>In connexion with this siege Mitchell's father-in-law, General Blunt,
writing to him from Cork (5 August 1834) and referring to William
Napier's book <i>History of the War in the Peninsula</i>, said: "I
perceive in the notes or appendix you are honourably mentioned as one of
four only remaining in the breach at Rodrigo."[11] The reference is to a
statement by an eye-witness contained in an appendix to vol. iv of
Napier's work. But General Blunt was mistaken; the Mitchell who led this
storming party was Captain (later Colonel) Mitchell of the 2nd Battalion
of the 95th Regiment.[12]</p>

<p>What part Thomas Mitchell played during this siege is unknown, but
that he was present is shown by the fact that he received the appropriate
bar to his general service medal.</p>

<p>After the town had been taken there were scenes of disorder, violence,
and brutality. On the morning following the capture, Wellington, riding
into the town, saw a disorderly group of soldiers, and enquired who they
were. He was disturbed to find that they were from his trusted 95th, who
had fought gloriously the night before.[13]</p>

<p>Now Wellington turned his attention to the fortress of Badajoz, which
threatened the rear of his projected northward march. On 16 March 1812,
he invested this place. Here we have definite record of Mitchell; he
wrote of his feelings when, on 17 March 1836, he began his third journey
of exploration:</p>

<blockquote>I remembered that exactly on that morning twenty-four years
before, I marched down the glaciers of Elvas, to the tune of "St. Patrick's
day in the morning" as the sun rose over the beleaguered towers of
Badajoz.[14]</blockquote>

<p>Badajoz was captured on 6 April 1812. Here again the Light Division
was prominent and distinguished itself by cool bravery and fierce
courage. Its losses were heavy, there were twenty-five casualties amongst
the officers alone.</p>

<p>Napier in the work already quoted wrote:</p>

<blockquote>Who shall measure out the glory of Ridge, of Macleod, of
Nicholas, or of O'Hare of the 95th who perished on the breach at the head
of the stormers, and with him nearly all the volunteers for that
desperate service.[15]</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell's personal share on this occasion is not known but he was not
likely to forget the occasion and in 1836 on the Glenelg River in
Victoria he named his base depot Fort O'Hare</p>

<blockquote>in memory of a truly brave soldier, my commanding officer,
who fell at Badajoz in leading the forlorn hope of the Light Division to
the storm."[16]</blockquote>

<p>He also gave the name of O'Hare Creek to a tributary of George's River
near his property at Wilton. Major Peter O'Hare had achieved the
distinction, very uncommon in those times, of having risen from the ranks
by sheer merit.</p>

<p>At Badajoz, as at Rodrigo, the capture of the town was followed by
three days of riotous disorder, with murder, rape, looting, and
unrestrained drunkenness. The brave, disciplined, British army became an
uncontrolled, savage mob. Mitchell's reactions to these two scenes of
violence are not indicated by anything definite during his later life:
deductions might be made, but they would be unsafe and unjustified.</p>

<p>Now a new phase began: Wellington was free to move northwards, Spain
being unguarded by western strongposts. It is necessary here to
anticipate a little and consider the direction of Wellington's future
movements. His route was to be along a direct line, in a north-easterly
direction from Lisbon to that angle where the eastern coast of France
joins the northern coast of Spain. From Lisbon to Salamanca the route,
after following the valley lands of the Tagus for about one hundred miles
turns northwards for about another hundred and thirty miles along the
highland broken country between two great ranges of mountains up to six
thousand feet high. The first section of this route was already well
known to Wellington and his staff, but the second section was more
difficult, with continual crossing of rapid streams (tributaries forming
the head waters of the Douro River), on one of which lies the town of
Salamanca.</p>

<p>In this region the country presented special difficulties requiring
accurate and detailed intelligence work: and it was here that Mitchell
laid the foundations of his reputation, for he was seconded from May 1812
to the Quartermaster General's staff under Gordon. He was, for the next
five months, busy on field work, surveying, mapping, and general
topographical intelligence.</p>

<p>After necessary reconnaissances and assembling of supplies, Wellington
moved north to Salamanca (<a href="#p2">Plate II</a>) where, after
capturing the forts on 27 June 1812, he met the main .French army on 15
July. During the next seven days both armies were manoeuvring for
position. On the night of 21 July there was a heavy thunderstorm, and
suddenly, at midday on 22 July, Wellington decided to attack. The French
were overwhelmingly defeated. Lord Liverpool, now Prime Minister in
England, stated that it was the most decisive as well as the most
brilliant victory which had crowned the British army for centuries.[17]
The French General Foy who commanded one of the French divisions recorded
in his diary that the battle had raised Wellington almost to the level of
Marlborough and that Wellington had shown himself a great and able master
of manoeuvres. Although the campaign was far from over, the Salamanca
battle ended the French domination in Spain.</p>

Museum</b></p>
</center>

<p>As Mitchell was still engaged on staff work it is probable that he
took no part in the actual fighting but he was almost certainly there at
the time, as he received the bar for this battle, and his memories of
this time remained, for on 22 July 1846--the thirty-fourth anniversary of
the battle--he, being then in Queensland on his fourth expedition,
entered in his journal:</p>

<blockquote>The bright prospects of this morning were a pleasant contrast
to the temporary difficulties of yesterday. Such is human life in
travelling, and so it was in war at Salamanca this day thirty-four years
back.[18]</blockquote>

<p>Actually it was not as it had been at Salamanca, for whereas then a
fine day had followed a thunderstorm, in 1846 when Mitchell made this
entry in his diary he had just found a welcome river and open country
after passing through a parched drought-stricken area. He was moved by
the anniversary rather than by the contrast.</p>

<p>It should be noted too that, on 22 July 1836, he had named Mt.
Arapiles in Victoria and recorded: "I ascended this hill on the
anniversary of the battle of Salamanca, and hence the name."[19] Arapiles
was the name of the mountain in Spain which overlooked the battlefield.
This battle had obviously made a deep impression on his memory.</p>

<p>After Salamanca the French armies were reformed, and Wellington was
forced to pause in his forward thrust: he was, indeed, compelled to
retreat to the Portuguese frontier after failing to capture Burgos. This
retreat was made under very adverse circumstances: bad weather, shocking
roads, worn-out clothing; and the discomfort of the troops was
intensified because, by bad staff work, the provisions were sent by the
wrong route, and the army had to subsist on what could be gathered
locally. The winter of 1812-13 was spent in Portugal reorganizing the
army for the campaign of 1813; Mitchell had rejoined his regiment in
October 1812, and nothing is known of his activities during the next few
months.</p>

<p>Wellington was, however, far from idle and was planning his next
moves: it is significant that Mitchell was back on the Quartermaster
General's staff in April 1813, and there can be little doubt that he,
with many others, was out surveying, mapping, and gathering all
information essential before Wellington's advance which began in the
following month, on 22 May 1813. There can be no doubt that Mitchell's
services were valuable and appreciated for he remained on staff duties
until the end of the war, and did not rejoin his regiment during that
period.</p>

<p>Wellington's first move was back to Salamanca, then on through the
very difficult mountain country north of the Douro River. Burgos was
taken and the British army reached the Ebro River, the French retreating
before them. At the Ebro the French had lost touch with the British army,
and with Wellington's movements. He had taken the bold decision to cross
the high ranges of the Sierra de Cantabria through which there were only
a few, and difficult, passes.</p>

<p>In five days Wellington had brought his army over these mountains and
came down on Vittoria: here they met and completely routed the French
army. This was on 21 June 1813; in exactly thirty days Wellington had
brought his army nearly two hundred miles, had passed that army through
difficult mountain passes, and had defeated the French army within fifty
miles of the border of France.</p>

<p>Wellington was not the man to undertake so difficult a feat of army
movement and supply without the fullest information about the country to
be crossed, so Mitchell must have been continuously busy on field survey
work; he was not present at the battle at Vittoria as he did not receive
the appropriate bar to his general service medal.</p>

<p>Now Spain had been almost cleared of the French armies, which were
retreating over the border into France at the extreme southwest corner of
that country. But there remained still two strong French fortresses in
Spain close to the border--Pampeluna and San Sebastian. As well as these
two strongposts Wellington had to face the great barrier of the Pyrenees,
fifty miles of high rugged mountain ranges, up to six thousand feet high,
through which there were eight practicable passes by any one of which the
reorganized French army might return to attack Wellington. They did, in
fact, return through the passes of Maya and Roncesvalles, the latter
evoking memories of Charlemagne. It was at Roncesvalles when the armies
were facing each other that Wellington's personal appearance at a most
critical moment ensured victory for the British. The fighting against the
French armies coming down through the Pyrenees to relieve Pampeluna and
San Sebastian lasted for nine days, ending in the repulse of the French.
San Sebastian fell on 8 September and Pampeluna on 31 October 1813, and
on 7 October Wellington had crossed into France. Mitchell received the
bars to his medal for both the Pyrenees and San Sebastian battles.</p>

<p>At this stage (September 1813) Murray had returned to Spain to replace
Gordon in his old position as Quartermaster General.[20] It is now
possible to visualize Mitchell's activities. From April 1813, until the
end of the war in April 1814, he had been continuously engaged in his
field survey work through some of the most difficult country in Europe,
country through which even today there are few practicable routes: first
in northern Spain, then in southern France as far as Toulouse. For the
last seven months he had been under the direct supervision of Murray,
whose complete approval, and actual friendship, he had secured. As a
surveyor and draughtsman he had gained an established reputation.</p>

<p>He had become a full lieutenant on 16 September 1813, and in the week
before Vittoria, the climax of Wellington's campaign, he had celebrated
his twenty-first birthday: that he had reached maturity in more than time
cannot be doubted.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of his personal life during these three years of
active service, but there are occasional glimpses of external reactions.
A brother officer in the 95th Regiment, Captain John Molloy (later to be
a settler at the Swan River settlement) knew Mitchell as "a most zealous
and indefatigable person and an excellent draftsman" and remembered that
on the Peninsula Mitchell used often to be absent for weeks at a time
with his sketch book working among the hills.[21] On the other side is
Mitchell's statement in a letter to Sir Benjamin D'Urban (18 June 1815):
"A junior officer on the staff, I was persecuted by the jealousy of the
officers of my regiment."[22] There is no clue to this, but regimental
jealousy of a junior officer selected for special staff duty would be
natural enough. There is also a curious note in a letter Mitchell wrote
to his mother (14 October 1820): he complained that his brother John had
"touched upon that delicate point, my services abroad, in a style not
reconcileable to the feelings of any officer".[23] The significance of
this is obscure.</p>

<p>The war having ended, Murray obtained approval from the Treasury to
have full plans made of all the Peninsular battlefields and selected
Mitchell from amongst all who must have been available for this work:[24]
this was a notable tribute to Mitchell's skill and reliability. This
arrangement was made at Bordeaux in June 1814, and Mitchell at once
proceeded to Portugal and Spain to begin this task. According to Napier
he remained in the Peninsula for more than two years with pay as a staff
officer (he still retained his commission in the 95th Regiment);[25] his
extra expenses--about five thousand pounds--were also paid; and in Spain
he was attended constantly by two Spanish dragoons as a protection.</p>

<p>This work meant that he was not with his regiment at Waterloo: writing
to Sir Benjamin D'Urban (18 June 1815)* he said:</p>

<blockquote>My absence from the glorious battle of Waterloo (in which my
brother and others suffered so much) is a sacrifice I shall ever regret
as a soldier.[26]</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* This is the date on the letter but Mitchell must
have written the wrong date thoughtlessly as this was the day on which
Waterloo was fought, and he was then in Spain and could not have known of
the battle.]</blockquote>

<p>Napier's statement that he remained in the Peninsula for "more than
two years" understates the position: he was there until July 1819, when,
the Treasury having refused to approve any further expenditure, he
returned to England, having, as stated in the preceding chapter married
Mary Blunt in June 1818.[27]</p>

<p>He had been placed on half-pay in December 1818, and the 'withdrawal
of all approval for his special work in the Peninsula so soon after his
marriage must have embarrassed him: but this difficulty may not have
lasted for long, for Murray, who had been appointed in 1819 to command
the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, arranged for him to be stationed
at the College so that he might complete his plans, probably with special
pay. Such an arrangement was a recognized practice in those times, the
officer remaining on the army records as being on half-pay.[28] It is
possible that he had begun duty at the College in 1819, but it is clear
that he was there in 1820, for the letter to his mother dated 14 October
1820 was addressed from there.</p>

<p>In November 1821, he was transferred to the 54th Foot and was again on
full pay.[29] This may have been the step that Murray arranged as it was
only a nominal appointment, that regiment being then in South Africa, and
later in India. In October 1822 he was given a brevet captaincy, and in
March 1824 he transferred to the 97th Foot. All this time he remained a
first lieutenant, but in January 1825 he was transferred to the 2nd Foot
as a full captain.</p>

<p>Murray left Sandhurst in 1824, but Mitchell remained there until
September 1826, and on the 29th of that month he became a major
(unattached) and placed on half-pay.[30] Writing to his mother (14
September 1826) he informed her that he had been made a major on
half-pay:</p>

<blockquote>The Duke of York has been particularly favourable to me--this
promotion has cost me &pound;1,400, &pound;200 of it I have borrowed. All
my friend</blockquote>

s approve highly of the measure as it will lead to higher rank and
command. But I am sadly pushed for money to live.[31]

<p>He was now living at Thistle Grove, Chelsea. He applied to be
reinstated: "I applied by letter dated 4th October 1826 to be placed on
full pay, and never wished to be on half-pay."[32]</p>

<p>He must have had some financial resources for he had been able to
produce &pound;2,000 on his marriage, and now, eight years later, another
&pound;1,200. But his fortunes had definitely changed: he was now without
prospects in the army, and the unbroken peace in Europe held no promise
for junior army officers. He was receiving half-pay only, which may have
varied from time to time but probably was never more than &pound;175 per
annum.</p>

<p>To complete here the outline of his military career, he received a
brevet lieutenant-colonelcy in November 1841, and in June 1854 became a
brevet colonel.[33] In Australia he was always familiarly known as "the
Major". One of his last activities as a military officer on active duty
was the publication of a book <i>Outlines of a system of surveying for
Geographical and Military purposes</i> which was commended in a review in
the <i>Naval and Military Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>The maps and plans he had prepared at Sandhurst, which can still be
seen, are sufficient evidence that his selection for this task was fully
justified. Many of them were reproduced in Wyld's <i>Atlas of the
Peninsula War</i>. There is also contemporary testimony. Sir William
Napier, in his <i>History of the Peninsula War</i>, wrote:</p>

<blockquote>Captain Mitchell's drawings were made by him after the war,
by order of the government and at the public expense...Never was money
better laid out, for I believe no topographical drawings, whether they be
considered for accuracy of detail, perfection of manner, or beauty of
execution, ever exceeded Mitchell's.[34]</blockquote>

<p>Murray's own verdict, written on 23 October 1825 from Dublin, where
Murray was then Commander-in-Chief of the forces in Ireland, is given in
a letter to Hay, Permanent Under-Secretary at the Colonial Office:</p>

<blockquote>There is a Captain Mitchell who has been employed by me first
in making surveys in the Peninsula of the several fields of Battle, and
subsequently in drawing military plans from their actual surveys. He is a
very intelligent and industrious man and possesses a considerable share
of enterprise and adventure. He is a skilful, accurate, and practised
surveyor, and a very good draftsman. His plans are indeed beautifully
executed.[35]</blockquote>

<p>With the end of Mitchell's work on these plans he faced a real crisis:
his active temperament would not allow him to remain idle, and his young,
and increasing, family involved expenses for which his half-pay was quite
inadequate. His friend, Murray, remained as Commander-in-Chief in
Ireland, and was always friendly (Mitchell could write, in 1834, that he
had enjoyed Murray's "kind patronage for upwards of twenty years") but he
could help only with letters.[36]</p>

<p>So Mitchell sought other opportunities for the use of his skill and
experience. Learning that a vessel had been commissioned for the purpose
of making a survey of the Grecian Archipelago he offered his services
with the object of connecting (where it might be practicable to do so) a
land survey with the marine survey.[37] He sought the support of Murray
who wrote (23 October 1825) to Hay, strongly recommending Mitchell.[38]
Portion of this letter has already been quoted, but he added: "I ought
perhaps to mention that you must not expect to find Captain Mitchell a
Greek scholar." It is clear from the relative dates that Mitchell made
this application nearly a year before he was placed on half-pay: he may
have realized that his future in the army was uncertain, or perhaps he
hoped to be seconded for this service.</p>

<p>Although nothing came of this proposal, Hay did not forget Mitchell;
when Governor Darling renewed his pressing requests for more skilled
surveyors for New South Wales, Hay sent for Mitchell (13 January 1827)
and offered him the choice of three positions in that colony:[39]</p>

<p>1. A principal assistant or secondary in the general survey.</p>

<p>2. A collector having some knowledge of surveying for allotting lands,
etc.</p>

<p>3. A civil engineer.</p>

<p>As to the first, there was a reservation that Lord Bathurst, the
Secretary of State, might have already offered the position to another.
Mitchell therefore wrote at once (14 January 1827) to Murray telling him
of the interview and asking for his support.[40] Murray wrote (17
January) to Hay, thanking him for remembering Mitchell and adding:</p>

<blockquote>You are already aware of my sentiments in regard to his
talents and requirements, and his active and industrious habits. I will
add further that I believe him to be a strictly honest and
well-principled man, and from my own experience I am inclined to think
that it is very desirable to let no opportunity pass of sending out men
of this latter description.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell was appointed to the first of the three positions; and Hay in
a private letter to Darling (2 February 1827) said that, in consequence
of Darling's very pressing demands for additional surveyors and the
difficulty of finding properly qualified persons, Mitchell's offer of
services had been accepted:</p>

<blockquote>It was impossible to induce an officer of this superior order
in his profession to accept one of the subordinate appointments in the
Surveyor General's Department, and, moreover, conceiving that it would be
of importance, not only to have the benefit of this officer's exertions
as second to Mr Oxley, but to have a person in the colony who was
competent to succeed him whenever circumstances required such an
appointment, Lord Bathurst has not hesitated to allow that consideration
to outweigh every other; and you will therefore have the goodness to
understand that Major Mitchell is to be considered as standing next in
rank to Mr Oxley, whom he will ultimately succeed.<br>
<br>
 Major Mitchell's salary has been fixed by Lord Bathurst at &pound;500
per annum commencing from the date of his embarkation, in addition to
which he will of course receive the usual allowance for a horse and for
lodgings.[41]</blockquote>

<p>In addition to this salary he was also receiving the half-pay from the
army: this he received during the rest of his life. Before leaving
England for Australia Mitchell insured his life for &pound;1,000 to cover
debts incurred in connexion with the purchase of his equipment.[42]</p>

<p>Immediately upon receiving notice of his appointment, and while still
in London, Mitchell wrote to Hay (9 February 1827) requesting that land,
in the proportion usually allotted to officers of his rank and standing,
be granted to him in New South Wales.[43] This letter, however, carries
an office minute that it would be much better for Mitchell to obtain land
by application to the Governor after he had discharged the duties of his
office for a short time.</p>

<p>So Mitchell came to New South Wales with the reversion of the position
of Surveyor General in succession to Oxley, who was already an invalid.
It is important to note, however, that in his letter to Murray of 14
January telling of the interview with Hay, Mitchell had said of the third
position--that of civil engineer: "I do not feel qualified to undertake
the comprehensive duties of the third." This point will be the subject of
reference later in this story.</p>

<p>After having spent all the formative years of his life--he was now
thirty-five years old--in the army under the fluctuating fortunes of the
Peninsular War, at a time when influential patronage was more important
than efficiency, he had now to adapt himself to the very difficult
conditions of the civil service in the colonies. His career in New South
Wales cannot be judged rightly unless the factors in his social and
administrative environment are, at least superficially, appreciated.</p>

<p>As to his professional skill, he had been engaged on intelligence work
requiring acute and exact observation under active, service conditions;
and had then been employed on survey work and preparation of plans
requiring accurate technique in the field, and skilled draughtsmanship in
preparing the resultant plans, for a total period of fourteen years, at
the end of which he had earned great praise. He was then, as he was
always to be in Australia, tireless and unremitting in his personal
traverses of country to be covered. He had become country-wise,
experienced in estimating, as was essential in army intelligence work,
the salient features in the topography of any region. This may have
affected his later disposition towards "feature surveys" although these
were forced on him by the prevailing conditions: that aspect will appear
prominently later in this story.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III - Colonial Policy and
Personalities</h2>

<p>Mitchell was appointed to his new position in the year 1827: this was
a critical period in the history of British government and of British
colonial policy.* For an appreciation of the conditions and fluctuations
through which the evolving political system in Australia emerged
ultimately into full self-government, some description must be given of
the conditions under which the government of the colonies was carried on
in London, of the administrative atmosphere in New South Wales, and of.
the general administrative, social, and geographical environment in which
this evolution occurred.</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* In respect of the material in this chapter
grateful acknowledgment is made to two articles in the journal
<i>Historical Studies--Australia and New Zealand</i>: J. C. Beaglehole,
"The Colonial Office 1782-1854", April 1941; E. T. Williams, "The
Colonial Office in the Thirties", May 1943.]</blockquote>

<p>Throughout this chapter it must be remembered that the Civil Service
in England was not, at that period, the carefully selected, highly
trained, and efficient service which it now is: it was, in fact, only in
the very earliest stages of growth, and the allocation of specific
departmental responsibilities to ministers of cabinet rank was indefinite
and incomplete. Throughout the whole of the period now under review the
administration of the colonies, although for all practical purposes a
separate entity, was under the control of the Secretary of State for War.
This aspect is irrelevant in the present story, except that appointments
in the colonies were largely given to officers of the navy and army; to
avoid confusion, the terms "Secretary of State for the Colonies", and
"Colonial Office", will be used throughout.</p>

<p>After the Napoleonic wars had been ended at Waterloo urgent aspects of
domestic policy had occupied the attention of the British Government, and
the colonies were given less attention than they might otherwise have
received. But they were not altogether neglected. The Colonial Office had
been established as an independent administrative unit at 14 Downing
Street in 1815. In 1822 a beginning was made in an attempt to place the
supervision of colonial administration on a more systematic basis. By
1833 the Colonial Office staff numbered only twenty-five clerks: these
had all been appointed at an early age (16-18) on nomination by
influential patrons.</p>

<p>R. W. Hay was appointed in 1825 as the first Permanent
Under-Secretary. He controlled the Colonial Office from 1825 until 1836:
of him it is recorded that his letters give the impression of a kindly
and sensible man with many (perhaps too many) social and extra-official
interests.[1] Of the staff generally R. M. Martin, writing in 1835, said:
<i>Mr Hay, the intelligent, patriotic, and urbane Under-Secretary, has
not I believe ever been in the colonies, nor am I aware of any clerk in
the Colonial Office who has ever been out of Europe: nay more, the very
agents appointed by the Secretary of State to represent the colonies in
England have never so far as I can ascertain with very few exceptions
crossed the Channel. Let any unprejudiced man ask himself how can our
colonies be well managed under such a system.[2]</i></p>

<p>Hay was the official to whom, as will appear later, Mitchell wrote
private letters during his disputes with Governor Darling. In a private
letter to Hay (28 March 1832) acknowledging two letters from him Mitchell
said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to return you my most sincere thanks for the attention you have
given my numerous complaints respecting the late Governor.[3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hay was succeeded by James Stephen whose name is indelibly associated
with a very critical period of colonial administration. He had been Legal
Counsellor to the Colonial Office since 1813, and had assumed the
position of Permanent Under-Secretary of the Colonial Office in 1836; he
remained in this position until 1847, and during those eleven years he
exercised a profound influence on the attitude of the British Government
towards the colonies. Verdicts on Stephen are varied. One writer who has
made a critical study of this period describes him as</p>

<blockquote>that aloof, austere intellectual, member by heredity and
spiritual inclination of the Clapham Sect...a legal training and many
years of experience as Counsel to the Colonial Department had confirmed
Stephen in habits of thought and criticism precise to the point of
pedantry, and confirmed also a respectful awareness of constitutional and
legal precedent. His ruthless dissection of colonial acts and ordinances
led to an examination of motive which, expounded in his official minutes,
occasionally verges on the unduly suspicious.[4]</blockquote>

<p>Another writer who has also closely studied this period has given this
verdict:</p>

<blockquote>With an inadequate staff, ineffective leadership combined
with unconvincing representation in a bored House, and the overlapping
responsibilities of the various branches of the Civil Service it was
remarkable that Stephen achieved as much as he did, and that he found
time to take thought for the morrow. He was too busy, too shy, and too
proud to ingratiate his opponents, and he gave too little time to outside
opinion. His opponents and his subordinates exaggerated his power though
he had perhaps the tendency of every public man unconsciously to live up
to his cartooned self...His subtlety, in so far as he led the Colonial
Office, has sometimes made it difficult for the historian, without
diligent application, to understand certain areas of colonial
policy.[5]</blockquote>

<p>The contemporary opinion of Thomas Carlyle was:</p>

<blockquote>I have seen Sir James Stephen there,* but did not understand
him then, or think he could be a "clever man" as reported by Henry Taylor
and other good judges. "He shuts his eyes on you," said the elder
Spring-Rice (Lord Monteagle), "and talks as if he were dictating a
Colonial Despatch" (most true "teaching you How Not to do it" as Dickens
defined afterwards): one of the pattest things I ever heard from
Spring-Rice; who had rather a turn for such. Stephen, ultimately, when on
half-pay and a Cambridge Professor, used to come down hither** pretty
often on an evening; and we heard a great deal of talk from him,
recognizably serious and able, though always in that Colonial-Office
style, more or less. Colonial-Office being an Impotency (as Stephen
inarticulately, though he never said or whispered it, well knew), what
could an earnest and honest kind of man do, but try and teach you How Not
to do it? Stephen seemed to me a master in that art.[6]</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* At Carlyle's public lectures between 1837 and
1840.]</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[** To Carlyle's home.]</blockquote>

<p>Stephen's own judgment of himself is on record. He wrote in 1846:</p>

<blockquote>My mind is as sensitive as my eyes and as soon pained,
irritated and darkened by any kind of glare. In all truth and honesty I,
have but a 50-50 opinion of myself in my relations to my fellow men, and,
so far as I can divine, I am unpopular, unsuccessful in the attempt to
please--passing indeed for a man of more talents than I really possess,
though of less amenity, cordiality, honour, and other social qualities
than I should ascribe to myself.[7]</blockquote>

<p>Finally, S. S. Bell and W. P. Morell in the introduction to their book
<i>Select Documents on British Colonial Policy</i>, 1830-1860 say:</p>

<blockquote>This book will fail in one of its main purposes if it does
not make clear the wisdom, the knowledge, the essential righteousness of
Stephen.[8]</blockquote>

<p>That is the almost universal testimony of all who have dispassionately
examined the work of the Colonial Office during the years in which he
controlled it. This was the man who was in charge of the Colonial Office
during and after Mitchell's first prolonged visit to England (see chapter
X). As to the staff at the Colonial Office, Stephen himself wrote:</p>

<blockquote>The majority of the members of the Colonial Department in my
time possessed only in a low degree, and some of them in a degree almost
incredibly low, either the talents or the habits of men of business, or
the industry, the zeal, or the knowledge, required for the effective
performance of their functions: they were, without exception, men who had
been appointed to gratify the political, the domestic, or the personal
feelings of their patrons, that is of successive Secretaries of
State.[9]</blockquote>

<p>And on another occasion he said that he had never yet served under any
Secretary of State who did not at least appear to attach a very high
interest to the power of giving such places to his dependents and
friends.</p>

<p>As to the attitude of ministers, and his general attitude towards
colonial policy, Stephen is on record as feeling that there should be
studious and speculative men standing aloof from mere despatch writing,
and projecting schemes of comprehensive and remote good:</p>

<blockquote>I do not know my alphabet better than I know that this is not
the spirit of the English Government, and that the ambition of every
Secretary of State, and his operations, will be bounded by the great
ultimate object of getting off the mails.[10]</blockquote>

<p>He believed that England ought never to give up a colony; that the
course to be pursued should be that of cheerfully relaxing, one after
another, the bonds of authority as soon as the colony itself desired that
relaxation, so substituting a federal for a colonial relation--no
national pride wounded, no national greatness diminished, no national
duty abandoned.</p>

<p>Herman Merivale succeeded Stephen as Permanent Under-Secretary in 1847
and was still in that position when Mitchell's career closed. He had
been, before this appointment, Professor of Political Economy at Oxford,
and the text of his printed lectures in that capacity indicate an
academic approach to the problems of colonial government. In his public
functions at the head of the Colonial Office, however, he appears to have
shown appreciation of the practical aspects of problems with which he had
to deal. He was the head of the Colonial Office during Mitchell's second
(1847) and third (1852) visits to England (see chapters XIII and XIV).
After his retirement he published a book, <i>Lectures on Colonization and
the Colonies</i>, to which reference will presently be made.</p>

<p>C. Gairdner, who had been a senior officer on the Colonial Office
staff since 1824, is described as a valuable civil servant, more than a
mere scribe, and far from being the traditional privileged
pharisee.[11]</p>

<p>Estimates of the characters of the ministers* who, as Secretaries of
State for the Colonies, were responsible for all matters concerning
Australia, are available from both contemporary observers and from modern
students who have studied the period.</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* A list of ministers is given in <a href=
"#appa">Appendix A</a>.]</blockquote>

<p>Stephen admired Huskisson and Lord John Russell, the one for his
"dominant understanding", the other for his "dominant soul", and both as
being naturally fitted for statesmanship: the rest were "mere throwings
up of the Tide of Life".[12]</p>

<p>Stephen is reported to have said of Murray that up to the end of 1828
he had done nothing, had never written a despatch: and Hay said, in 1830,
that for the many years he had been in office he had never met with any
public officer so totally inefficient.[13]</p>

<p>McCarthy says of Goderich ("Prosperity Robinson") that he was one of a
class of men who are to be found at all times of parliamentary history,
and who manage somehow, nobody quite knows how, to make themselves appear
indispensable to their political party.[14]</p>

<p>It is said of Stanley that he scarcely bothered to disguise his
contempt for colonial manners: but of Russell, in contrast to Stephen's
opinion (quoted above) the same authority says that he never really got
inside the minds of his countrymen overseas and was often more pointed
than wise.[15]</p>

<p>Of Glenelg it was said that he had the weak man's belief that
procrastination is a substitute for incorruptibility: his sluggishness
was a by-word in political circles.[16]</p>

<p>There are available two opinions of Lord Grey. A contemporary writer
said of him that the House of Commons swarmed with his bitter enemies and
he had very few friends.</p>

<blockquote>Notwithstanding his great and undeniable abilities he has
committed blunders which proceed from his contempt for the opinions of
others, and the tenacity with which he clings to his own: while those who
know him are aware that a man more high-minded, more honourable and
conscientious does not exist.[17]</blockquote>

<p>McCarthy, writing much later, said:</p>

<blockquote>Lord Grey then and since only succeeded somehow in missing
the career of a leading statesman. He had great talents and some
originality; he was independent and bold. But his independence
degenerated too often into impracticability and even eccentricity; and he
was, in fact, a politician with whom ordinary men could not
work.[18]</blockquote>

<p>That is a rapid review of the ministers of state who for the most part
remotely, but on some occasions directly, influenced Mitchell's career.
It is, perhaps, not without significance that every Secretary of State
for the Colonies during Mitchell's Australian career--with the exception
of Murray--were members of the titled aristocracy. Of their attitude to
their responsibilities Froude could, so late as 1885, write:</p>

<blockquote>Our differences with the Colonists have been aggravated by
the class of persons with whom they have been brought officially into
contact. The administration of the Colonial Office has been generally in
the hands of men of rank, or of men who aspire to rank; and, although
these high persons are fair representatives of the interests which they
have been educated to understand, they are not the fittest to conduct our
relations with communities of Englishmen with whom they have imperfect
sympathy, in the absence of a well-informed public opinion to guide them.
The colonists are socially their inferiors, out of their sphere, and
without personal point of contact. Secretaries of State lie yet under the
shadow of the old impression that the Colonies exist only for the benefit
of the Mother-country. They distributed the colonial patronage, the
lucrative places of employment, to provide for friends or political
supporters. When this, too, ceased to be possible, they acquiesced easily
in the theory that the Colonies were no longer of any use at
all.[19]</blockquote>

<p>Two contemporary expressions of opinion might be recorded of the
status of the Colonial Office at the end of the period now under review,
recalling at the same time Carlyle's opinion, already quoted, of his
impression of Stephen's own attitude.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Salisbury is reported as saying, in 1852:</p>

<blockquote>I am not much disposed to yield to popular clamour, but the
din of indignation against Downing Street is so bad and so incessant that
I cannot help thinking there must be something in it...we alienate the
Colonies and harass every Ministry with the solution of a set of problems
in order that we may have the exquisite privilege of supporting some
thirty useless clerks.[20]</blockquote>

<p>Carlyle was even more vehement:</p>

<blockquote>What these strange Entities in Downing Street intrinsically
are; who made them, why they were made; how they do their function--is
probably known to no mortal...Every Colony, every agent for a matter
Colonial, has his tragic tale to tell you of his sad experiences in the
Colonial Office; what blind obstructions, fatal indolences, pedantries,
stupidities, on the right and on the left, he had to do battle with...I
perceive that besides choosing Parliaments never so well, the new
Colonial Office will have another thing to do: contrive to send out a new
kind of Governors to the Colonies.[21]</blockquote>

<p>These abrupt verdicts on ministers and secretaries do not, of course,
provide an accurate or adequate portrait of any of the persons concerned:
other verdicts, in an infinite variety, are probably available. They
have, however, been quoted as indication that there was contemporary
discontent with, and some lack of harmony within, the Colonial Office. At
a time when the parliament and the people of Great Britain were
preoccupied with "reform", and the major anxiety of the Colonial Office
was slavery and emancipation, it is not difficult to understand that the
problems of the Australian colonies were not always wisely solved. It is,
indeed, probable that these expressions of opinion were prompted largely
by experiences connected with the West Indies, Canada, and perhaps India,
and that they had little reference to the Australian colonies.</p>

<p>No one with experience of public administration, who has studied the
despatches of the period, can accept this picture of the Colonial Office
in its relations with Australia as real: these despatches provide clear
evidence of honest and intelligent efforts to find the best answer to
every question that was presented: but that Mitchell was unaware of the
general dissatisfaction is unlikely, and that it affected his actions is
probable.</p>

<p>Apart from these focal aspects of administration there were rapid,
almost revolutionary changes in the social and political structure of
society in England. The success of the revolt of 'the American colonies,
the French Revolution, the writings of Paine and others, had all stirred
in the minds of the English people deep questionings as to the rights of
the individual man and the form of government. Discontent simmered slowly
until the little revolution in France in 1829, resulting in the flight
and deposition of King Charles X, crystallized definite reaction in
England. The news of the events in France "provoked in England a
bewildering storm of popular feeling which swept the country and was most
unfavourable to the Government" at the elections in England of August in
that year.[22]</p>

<p>Wellington, who had, since Waterloo, held in the minds of the English
people a position of extraordinary prestige and authority, was definitely
reactionary and unresponsive to the popular clamour for reform. He said,
in 1830, that it would be utterly beyond the power of the wisest
political philosopher to devise a constitution so near to absolute
perfection as that under which Englishmen had been endowed by the wisdom
of their ancestors, and that Englishmen already possessed all the freedom
that it was good for men to have.[23]</p>

<p>He was, however, powerless to delay reform, and the reform of
parliament, of the social structure generally, proceeded steadily during
the following decades until many radical reforms, including the
fundamental redistribution of electorates, liberalized qualification for
voting, voting by ballot, and abolition of the system of purchase of army
commissions, had become established features of the social system. These
reforms had resulted, during the period now under review, in a large
measure of transfer of power from the titled aristocracy to the great
middle class. From this new body came a move to cut off the colonies, to
give them independence and to let them survive or perish as they could.
Froude has reviewed the position:</p>

<blockquote>The Colonies had no longer any special value as a market for
our industries; the whole world was now open to us, and so long as their
inhabitants were well off and could buy our hardware and calicoes, it
mattered nothing whether they were independent, or were British subjects,
or what they were. The representatives of the middle classes would have
shaken oft, if they had been allowed, Australia and New Zealand, and the
Canadas. The politicians who succeeded to power when the aristocracy was
dethroned by the Reform Bill discovered that the Colonies were of no use
to us, and that we would be better off and stronger without
them.[24]</blockquote>

<p>Beside these specific movements, this transfer of power had involved
also great reductions in the system of patronage, and of filling
important positions through personal favour or family affiliations. All
this social reform, until 1855, was contemporary with Mitchell's period
of service in Australia. How this flooding revolution affected Mitchell's
mind during his three visits to England within this period can only be a
matter for speculation, but that he was uninfluenced by these changes is
unlikely.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Some indication of the quality of the Governors under whom Mitchell
served is necessary and verdicts upon them are available from two
sources. Dr J. D. Lang, a public figure in New South Wales throughout the
whole period, had many personal dealings with each of them; Dr Frederick
Watson as editor of the <i>Historical Records of Australia</i> formed his
opinions from an exhaustive study of contemporary official documents and
other records. Each of these Governors was an army officer, Darling,
Bourke and Gipps being veterans of the Peninsular War.</p>

<p>Lang[25] and Watson[26] both agree that Darling, while possessing good
qualities, was not a suitable governor for a colony whose inhabitants
were emerging from a period of subservience and were agitating for an
extension of civil rights. Lang's opinion was that "the military man is
peculiarly unfitted for dealing with opposition when he happens to be
invested with civil authority".</p>

<p>Bourke is described by Lang as strictly just and constitutionally
humane, but obstinately fixed in his own opinions and impatient of
opposition.[27] Watson considers that he was a broad-minded and
far-sighted statesman and recognized the advantage of granting to the
people a share in their own government.[28]</p>

<p>Gipps is condemned by Lang in severe terms: he says that Gipps was
superior both in intellect and acquirements to the generality of mankind:
but with these acknowledged mental qualities he was of an essentially
narrow and diminutive mind--incapable of enlarged and comprehensive views
either of the nature and requirements of his own position, or of the
interests of those he governed.[29] Watson does not agree with this
estimate; he acknowledges that Gipps had been much criticized, but from a
careful study of his despatches he concludes that Gipps was a capable
administrator and brilliant statesman with great breadth of vision and
almost uncanny foresight.[30]</p>

<p>Fitzroy is condemned by both authorities for his lax moral
character.[31] Lang's condemnation is unqualified, but Watson credits him
with being an industrious and impartial administrator.[32]</p>

<p>Lang's opinion of Denison is expressed in very unfavourable terms as
an arbitrary and unreasonable governor. Watson's verdict is not available
as the <i>Historical Records</i> ceased before this period was
reached.</p>

<p>Although it is true that the Colonial Office, especially when
controlled by Stephen and Merivale, honestly sought the right answer to
each phase of a complicated problem, there was, continually, a swaying
balance between the recommendations of the Governor, and the contrary
representations and pressure from people in the colony to and upon their
patrons and influential friends in England. Pathetic testimony is
provided by the Governors themselves.</p>

<p>Macquarie had, in connexion with a particular complaint, protested to
Bathurst against a rebuke administered by that minister, and had said
that he felt assured that his Lordship would not wish him to submit
tamely to the subversion of his authority as Governor. The end of it all
was that Macquarie resigned:</p>

<blockquote>I must confess, my Lord, I am now heartily tired of my
situation here, and anxiously wish to retire from Public Life as soon as
possible.[33]</blockquote>

<p>Lang records that, in 1824, he heard John Macarthur say with evident
self-satisfaction that he had been the means of sending home every
Governor of the colony except Macquarie.[34] Darling was dismissed, as
will appear later, because of continued pressure from the discontented
factions and the dissatisfaction of the Colonial Office with his
administration: "Your Lordship has disgraced me in the very face of
people whom I have now governed for nearly six years."[35]</p>

<p>Bourke resigned because the Colonial Office refused to support him in
an administrative action which he believed to be necessary: "I lament
that Your Lordship has not appreciated my motives in offering my
resignation."[36]</p>

<p>Gipps, after more than eight years of valuable service during which he
incurred much local hostility in trying faithfully to carry out the
instructions of the Colonial Office, resigned. Watson records his opinion
that it is certain that his strenuous labour as Governor was the
principal cause of his early death.[37]</p>

<blockquote>I beg to assure Your Lordship that to be relieved from the
cares and anxieties attendant on the administration of the affairs of
this remote Colony will on many accounts be very gratifying to
me.[38]</blockquote>

<p>Fitzroy left the colony in disrepute because of disorderly
conduct.</p>

<p>It is impossible in this review to trace the steps towards
self-government in the colony from the days when Macquarie governed as
absolute ruler without any Council, and hoped there never would be one,
through the creation in 1824 of a Legislative Council, containing a
majority of officials, to advise the Governor upon (but not to initiate)
proposed legislation, then in the following year of an Executive Council
to advise on administrative actions, through the gradually increasing
degrees of local autonomy and elective, as opposed to nominee,
representation, to full self-government in 1855-6 with a bi-cameral
parliament.</p>

<p>The gradual progress during these thirty years was not attained
without considerable and continuous agitation, nor without frequent and
sustained clashing of private interests. Merivale was Permanent
Under-Secretary at the Colonial Office through all the final stages in
the establishment of the autonomous constitutions of New South Wales and
Victoria. His verdict on this transition period was:</p>

<blockquote>There was antagonism between the wealthier and the poorer
classes, greatly as that antagonism was exaggerated by those who sought
their own profit in maintaining hostility between them. There was probably
some truth in the assertion that the large proprietors or lessees in
Australia conceived themselves to have an interest in impeding the
general acquisition of land and in keeping down the wages of labour.<br>
<br>
Under these circumstances the revolution which snapped the slight tie of
dependence on the mother country left the colonial aristocracy desirous
but unable to make head against a numerical majority. And yet this
revolution was mainly brought about by that aristocracy itself. Such is
the usual course of events. The able and wealthy leaders of the old
Australian legislatures wanted to transfer power from Downing Street to
themselves: they succeeded in transferring it to their inferiors.<br>
<br>
The Home Government gained a release from the unpopular and useless
office of interference: relief from wearisome struggles, and kindliness
instead of hatred.<br>
<br>
Australia gained what all communities appear to gain by emancipation
however unfavourable some of the features of the emancipation may have
been.[39]</blockquote>

<p>The period of thirty years, which has been covered in this chapter,
was exactly the period of Mitchell's association with Australian affairs.
This brief, and inevitably incomplete, review is, presented with the
object of giving some impression of the conditions under which Mitchell
had to carry out his duties and adjust himself to conditions which were
rapidly changing in both England and Australia.</p>

<p>He began his career as a Peninsular veteran with a meritorious record
and with the prestige then accorded to all such soldiers: but, as Napier
said of the Napoleonic wars, the British soldier "fought beneath the cold
shade of aristocracy". It was the day of the aristocrat, the day of
patronage, when nepotism was the conventionally accepted practice, when a
position in the civil service of England or of Australia could not be
secured except through the influence of some aristocrat, and when all
departmental decisions were susceptible to pressure from some influential
source.</p>

<p>At the very commencement of his Australian career all this abruptly
changed. With Wellington's fall from power and the inception of "reform":
with the rise of democracy, and, especially with the firm hand of Stephen
at the Colonial Office, Mitchell found that the anchors in England upon
which he had relied were losing strength, and during his later visits to
England he was thrown completely upon his own resources.</p>

<p>In Australia he came to a colony which included all the mainland of
Australia as far as 129&deg; E. longitude--i.e. the borders of Western
Australia--and in which organized settlement was almost completely
limited to the strip east of the Dividing Range. Towards the end of his
career Victoria and South Australia were no longer under his jurisdiction
and the agitation for the separation of Queensland had begun.</p>

</center>

<p>When Mitchell arrived in Australia in 1827 the estimated population
was 56,000: when he died in 1855 it was 793,000: and the type of
population had completely changed. When he arrived in 1827 the people of
the colony were the official autocracy, the squatter autocracy
(exclusives), convicts, emancipists, and a limited number of free
immigrants. During his first years came an increasing flow of free
immigrants from Great Britain, mostly young people inspired with the
spirit of reform and newly-found freedom; and, in his last years, the
great influx following the discovery of gold, these with still further
advanced ideas of reform. From a stage at which the landed aristocracy
and the governing group firmly maintained their control of wealth and
power there was a steady transition to the stage at which these refused
to surrender, and the newcomers sought to secure, a dominant place in
this new land. And through all these changes, from beginning to end, were
the steadily increasing numbers of Australian-born of whom Commissioner
Bigge had written so early as 1822:</p>

<blockquote>The class of inhabitants that have been born in the Colony
affords a remarkable exception to the moral and physical character of
their parents: they are generally tall in person and slender in their
limbs, of fair complexion and small features. They are capable of
undergoing more fatigue and are less exhausted by labour than native
Europeans; they are active in their habits, but remarkably awkward in
their movements. In their tempers they are quick and irascible but not
vindictive; and I only repeat the testimony of persons who have had many
opportunities of observing them, that they inherit neither the vices nor
the feelings of their parents.[40]</blockquote>

<p>During Mitchell's term of office the land problem was unceasingly
acute. As Surveyor General he was responsible for all matters such as
disposal of Crown lands, of survey of boundaries of alienated land, of
titles, supervision of lease-hold tenures, and all related matters, over
a territory from Bass Strait to the middle of Queensland. The old system
of free grants of land had been abolished by the Home Government in 1831
and from that time followed continual changes in land policy. In these
changes the influence of Wakefield's "proposal for colonizing Australia"
can be recognized, although his system was not adopted as fully in New
South Wales as it was in other colonies.</p>

<p>Mitchell would, without doubt, have known that it was Wakefield's
influence which moved the Colonial Office to introduce the basic change
in policy in 1831 under which sale by auction replaced the system of free
land grants, and even later changes, at a time when Stephen was legal
counsellor to the Colonial Office; and it is probable that he knew of
Stephen's estimate of Wakefield's character:</p>

<blockquote>I saw plainly that the choice before me was that of having Mr
Wakefield for an official acquaintance whose want of truth and honour
would render him most formidable in that capacity, or for an enemy whose
hostility was to be unabated. I deliberately preferred his enmity to his
acquaintanceship and I rejoice that I did so.[41]</blockquote>

<p>The story which follows in this volume is an attempt to describe the
course steered by Mitchell through these very troubled waters; to
indicate how far he was able to adapt himself to a social environment
which changed so fundamentally that the world of 1855 would look back
with puzzled wonder on the world of 1827; and to record the great
services he rendered to his adopted country under conditions which were
always difficult.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV - Conditions in the earlier Years</h2>

<p>The first sixty-seven years of government in New South Wales provide a
dramatic story of evolution in relations between the Home Government and
the new colony of New South Wales.</p>

<p>For twenty-seven years the Home Government was preoccupied and
distracted by the turmoil of the Napoleonic wars. In this period it was
content to leave the control of the purely penal establishment (its
status as a colony developed slowly) to a Governor vested with autocratic
powers--powers which were vague, but absolute. Yet, though this was the
nominal position, the Home Government encouraged patronage, and personal
influence resulted often in arbitrary interference by the Colonial Office
in London with the actions of the Governor in Sydney. Long delays in
communications between Sydney and London, ignorance of conditions in New
South Wales, and frequent inertia on the part of the Colonial Office were
factors tending to increase confusion in administration.</p>

<p>The first Governor, Phillip, had only a guard of marines; but in the
years 1790 and 1791 a military corps named the New South Wales Corps
(afterwards the 102nd Regiment of the Line) was specially raised for
military duties and guard service in the new colony. After the departure
of Phillip an interval of almost three years elapsed before a new
Governor, Hunter, was appointed and assumed office. During those three
years the commanding officers of the New South Wales Corps administered
government as Lieutenant Governors, first Grose and then Paterson. One of
the lieutenants in the Corps was John Macarthur, whose influence in the
colony became great.</p>

<p>The officers of the New South Wales Corps soon became interested in
commercial ventures beyond the limits conventionally observed by army
officers on duty. In this they were not discouraged by the Lieutenant
Governors--their own commanding officers. Under the system of free grants
of land with the assignment of convict servants, some of the officers
acquired valuable properties; and, by the traffic in rum, they became so
influential as to dominate the economic life of the colony. Their
activities extended until they became a serious threat to the healthy
growth of this young community, and under their influence a spirit of
insurrection against constituted authority developed.</p>

<p>While this revolt against local authority was actively directed
against the local Governor, those concerned were very careful to maintain
friendly relations with influential members of the Home Government, even
to the extent of securing the recall of some Governors. Bligh had arrived
in Sydney, as Governor, in 1806 with explicit instructions to end the
traffic in rum and to curtail the entrenched privileges of the officers
of the New South Wales Corps. The result of his efforts in this field are
familiar matters of history. After his illegal deposition following on
the "rebellion", the Colonial Office realized that a new policy was
necessary. The succession of naval officers as Governors was broken, and
Macquarie, a soldier with considerable experience of active service in
India, was appointed; he assumed duty in Sydney on New Year's Day,
1810.</p>

<p>Human communities do not stand still. Many of the transported convicts
had died during those first twenty-two years: others had completed their
term of transportation and chosen to remain as "emancipists" in the
colony. These were free men: Macquarie took the stand that, sentence
completed, they should be treated in all material respects as ordinary
civilians.</p>

<p>Three months after Macquarie's arrival in Sydney the New South Wales
Corps embarked for England; but some of the military and official
autocracy had, by this time, acquired important vested interests in the
colony. So early as 1802, thirty-four individuals in this group held
estates to a total of eighteen thousand acres, all acquired under the
system of free grants made by the Governors and Lieutenant Governors. In
addition they had complete control of all official positions, and
violently opposed all suggestions that the emancipists should receive any
consideration. This group has become known as the "exclusives".</p>

<p>Macquarie, on the day of his arrival, declared his intention of
treating all classes equally and appealed for harmony; although opposed
by the unrelenting hostility of the exclusives he steadily advanced the
interests of the emancipists and their children, receiving, for some
years at least, the support of the Colonial Office in this policy. But at
last, owing to prolonged intrigues against Macquarie by the exclusives,
Commissioner Bigge was appointed to enquire into the actual circumstances
of the colony under Macquarie's administration, and particularly to
ascertain</p>

<blockquote>how far in its present improved and increasing state it was
susceptible of being made adequate to the object of its original
institution.</blockquote>

<p>The exclusives had, for the moment, been able to cast a shadow over
Macquarie's humane policy.</p>

<p>Bigge arrived in Sydney in 1819 and his report, in some aspects
critical of Macquarie's administration, was published in London in 1821:
in that year Macquarie resigned as Governor, and in the following
February he returned to England. Although Macquarie had made many land
grants to emancipists, he had not encouraged the immigration of free
settlers; nor had he favoured any move towards local self-government,
even so elementary a step as the appointment of a Governor's Council.
Indeed he "hoped that such a measure would never be resorted to in the
colony".[1] At the end, after eleven years of successful administration,
during which the population of the colony had increased from 10,096 to
29,665, wearied by the constant intrigues of his local enemies and their
favourable reception by the ministers in England, he was glad to
resign.</p>

<p>The next Governor was Sir Thomas Brisbane, whose period of
administration was four years, from December 1821 to December 1825:
during that period the only developments important for this present
review were the first steps towards local autonomy--the decision to
appoint a Legislative Council; and the beginning of immigration of free
settlers with capital. These settlers arrived in considerable numbers
during Brisbane's period, so that, with the continual arrival also of
convicts, the population had, by 1825, increased to 38,313 persons. The
immigrant settlers were given free grants of land, and convicts were
assigned to them as servants. Brisbane did not continue Macquarie's
policy of humane treatment of emancipists: nevertheless, as a result of
the intrigues of the exclusives he was recalled.</p>

<p>The following extract from a farewell address presented to Brisbane
illustrated the slowly changing position of the exclusives in the social
balance:</p>

<blockquote>Your Excellency has never, in the distribution of the
patronage of the Crown, or in framing new Laws or Ordinances, allowed
yourself to know the high from the low, the Emigrant from the
Emancipist.[2]</blockquote>

<p>Next came General Darling (<a href="#p3">Plate III</a>) who was to
serve as Governor from 1825 to 1831. He had the task of introducing
reforms intended to increase the degree of local self-government.[3] The
reforms had been prescribed by the Home Government, not by Darling
himself. In giving effect to this policy he satisfied neither the
obstinate conservative group who wished to retain their privileges, nor
the aggressive radicals who desired more extensive reforms. The
dissatisfaction developed into actual hostility. In the end, the
intrigues of the exclusives against him were successful, and he was
recalled. Later he had to face a committee of enquiry into his
administration. Darling's bitter protest on the occasion of his recall is
included in <a href="#appb">Appendix B</a>.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of his successor, Bourke, some citizens presented an
address to the new Governor which contained this passage:</p>

<blockquote>After nearly six years of public endurance arising partly
from the visitations of Providence, but more from an inveterate system of
misgovernment we hail Your Excellency's arrival among us as the dawn of a
happier era.[4]</blockquote>

<p>Darling had not deserved this. It was in Darling's period that the
Legislative Council first became fully effective. At the beginning it was
composed of official members, with one non-official nominee member.</p>

<p>Darling, like his immediate predecessors, gave many free grants of
land; and, although he was severely criticized at that time, it may
reasonably be said that, during his period, there was slow but steady
progress towards a more stable social order. The population had increased
from 38,313 to more than 48,000. This phase in our national evolution is
notable for the appearance on the administrative stage of a new and
vigorous group, the Australian-born. These, the children of all the
different conflicting groups, were, although infected with the prejudices
of their respective families, more concerned with finding a place for
themselves in this new world.</p>

<p>It is appropriate to quote here the text of an address presented to
Darling on his arrival (19 December 1825):</p>

<blockquote>The growth of the Colony continues to outstrip the most
sanguine expectations of the oldest inhabitants and we doubt not that
Your Excellency will soon discover that the present code of Local laws is
far behind the claims of a free wealthy and active community...<br>
<br>
While we can justly boast of the loyalty and attachment to the Crown of
England of all the inhabitants of the Colony who were born and educated
in the United Kingdom, there exists nevertheless in the Territory a race
of Men already arrived at an adult state who, scattered in the distant
and silent woods of their country, unknown, unfelt, and unheard of as a
political body, are yet destined to be the Fathers of the succeeding
generation and the inheritors of our lands.<br>
<br>
This class of colonists has been too much neglected, as well by His
Majesty's Government as by the local administrators of the Colony, and
unfortunately they deeply feel this neglect. The patronage of office they
have always disregarded; but grants of land which they consider their own
as it were by natural inheritance, and which they have seen of late
years, through the recommendation of the late Commissioner of Enquiry
lavishly bestowed upon strangers without capability of improving it...has
had a baneful influence on their minds.[5]</blockquote>

<p>Also to be noted are the terms in which Hamilton Hume had earlier
addressed Earl Bathurst (20 April 1826) when seeking special recognition
for his services in exploration:</p>

<blockquote>Presuming myself (although an Australian) capable from
experience of undertaking such an expedition I represented to His
Excellency my willingness to explore those hitherto unexplored
regions...[6]</blockquote>

<p>and to note the phrasing of Brisbane's report to the Colonial Office
(24 March 1825):</p>

<blockquote>I have also to announce to you the discovery of a new and
valuable country of great extent from Lake George to Western Port by two
young men, Messrs Hovell and Hume, the latter Colonial.[7]</blockquote>

<p>This cold announcement, without commendation, is in contrast with the
"zeal and intelligence" displayed by Oxley on a far less arduous
enterprise by sea. There is evidence that too much praise for discoveries
of this value by explorers who were not on the survey staff should not be
permitted as it would adversely influence Oxley's prestige.[8] Mitchell,
at a later date, gave evidence of a similar attitude.</p>

<p>Darling was succeeded by Sir Richard Bourke, who was Governor from
1831 to 1837. Perhaps the best indication of the prosperity which marked
his period is that during those six years the population increased from
48,000 to 86,842.</p>

<p>The system of free land grants had been discontinued about the time of
Darling's recall and a new system of purchase instituted. Bourke's
administration may have been wisely planned, or based on diplomatic
expediency, opinions vary; but during this time progress towards social
and economic stability was real and of permanent quality.</p>

<p>The citizens were moved to erect a statue to him. This statue now
stands in front of the Mitchell Library in Sydney and carries the
following inscription as a catalogue of his achievements:</p>

<pre>
This statue of Lieutenant General Sir Richard Bourke K.C.B.
is erected by the people of New South Wales to record his
able honest and benevolent administration from 1831 to 1837
Selected for the Government at a period of singular difficulty
His judgment urbanity and firmness justified the choice
Comprehending at once the vast resources
Peculiar to this Colony
He applied them for the first time
Systematically to its benefit
He voluntarily divested himself of the prodigious influence
Arising from the assignment of penal labour and enacted
Just and salutary laws, for the administration of penal discipline
He was the first Governor who published satisfactory accounts
Of public receipts and expenditure
Without oppression or detriment to any interest
He raised the revenue to a vast amount and from its surplus
Realized extensive plans of immigration
He established religious equality on a just and firm basis
And sought to provide for all without distinction of sect
A sound and adequate system of national education
He constructed various public works of permanent utility
He founded the flourishing settlement of Port Phillip
And threw open the unlimited wilds of Australia
To pastoral enterprise
He established Savings Banks and was the patron of the first Mechanics' Institute
He created an equitable tribunal for determining upon claims to grants of land
He was the warm friend of the liberty of the press
He extended trial by jury after its almost total suspension for many years
By these and numerous other measures
For the moral religious and general improvement of all classes
He raised the Colony to unexampled prosperity
And retired amid the reverent and affectionate regret of the people
   having won their confidence by his integrity
Their gratitude by his services
Their admiration by his public talents and
Their esteem by his private worth.
</pre>

<p>Bourke was followed by Gipps (1838-46), Fitzroy (1846-55), and Denison
(1855-61). During the period of office of these four Governors the old
exclusives-emancipists-emigrants rivalries had been largely forgotten.
The population at the end of Gipps' period had grown to 196,704: and,
following the discovery of gold, the population had swollen, in New South
Wales and Victoria together (Victoria had become a separate colony in
1851) to 897,126 at the end of Denison's period as Governor. This
dramatic increase in population involved serious problems in
administration.</p>

<p>It has finally to be recorded that local self-government was granted
slowly. A Legislative Council, as stated above, had been formed in 1824:
a representative (partly elected) legislature was established in 1842:
and, in 1856, full self-government under a bi-cameral legislature was
instituted.</p>

<p>EXPANSION OF THE COLONY</p>

<p>The formidable wall of sandstone ranges around Sydney was, at first, a
feature favourable to administration: the majority of the population were
convicts whose control was greatly facilitated by this natural barrier
against escape. All settlement and development were limited to the narrow
coastal strip: and, although there had been some extension to the Hunter
and Shoal-haven districts, traffic thereto could only be by sea. To the
west there could be no traffic.</p>

<p>It had been somewhat vaguely assumed in the Colonial Office that this
new convict settlement would become self-supporting at least in respect
of food: but the country around Sydney was found to be so unsuited to
agriculture that this hope was soon, perhaps too soon, abandoned. Such
food as was grown was, for the most part, grown on the farms of the
exclusives who kept the price unduly high. There could be no competition
as all the good land in this coastal strip had already passed into
private possession under the system of free grants.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival Macquarie had complained to Castlereagh that
persons were coming out as settlers bringing orders from cabinet
ministers in England for large grants of land in specified localities:
these people were naturally disappointed when they found that no land was
available in the districts they had selected.[9]</p>

<p>Sheep provided the determinant factor. From the initial twenty-nine
sheep, all that were left, on 1 May 1788, of the original importation,
and from small consignments imported later, the numbers steadily grew. In
1796 there were 2,457: in 1805, 16,501: in 1813, 50,000: and by 1821 they
had multiplied until it was estimated that the flocks totalled
290,000.[10] Sheep, which are never still, walking as they eat, require
room. Land in ever increasing quantities became urgently necessary. But
all attempts to cross the confused sandstone ranges to the west failed
until 1813: in that year Lawson and his companions found a practicable
route over the Blue Mountains. In the same year Evans, sent by Macquarie,
followed their route and extended their discoveries to the plains around
Bathurst and the Macquarie River.</p>

<p>Macquarie had then instructed Cox to build a road over the mountains;
and when this was completed, he himself with a suitable retinue,
including Surveyor General Oxley, visited the Bathurst plains, fixing the
site for the future town. From here he sent Evans on westward another 115
miles; Evans returned having discovered the upper reaches of the Lachlan
not far from Cowra. From these excursions it was revealed that two great
rivers, the Lachlan and the Macquarie, had their source quite close to
each other in the Bathurst district.</p>

<p>In 1814, Hamilton Hume and his brother made a journey as far as Bong
Bong and Berrima, and in 1818 Hume and Meehan discovered Lake Bathurst
and the country round Goulburn. Earl Bathurst in England, stimulated by
these discoveries, ordered further exploration of the western rivers.[11]
The revelation of these great plains, with the possibility that growing
pastoral and agricultural industries might contribute towards the
economic independence of the colony, excited even the Colonial Office to
faint enthusiasm.[12]</p>

<p>Oxley offered his services for further exploration. In 1817 he
followed the Lachlan down as far as Booligal, and in 1818 he traced the
Macquarie as far as the marshes north of Warren. On each river his
further progress--he took boats--was stopped by apparently impenetrable
marshes. He retired from each journey convinced that both rivers ended in
one vast inland sea, and reported adversely upon the country
traversed.</p>

<p>Locally, the reaction to these discoveries was immediate. Macquarie
gave liberal grants of free land on these great western plains: and other
sheep-owners, without right or title, moved their flocks south-westward
to the Goulburn plains, and westward in the Bathurst-Wellington
region.</p>

<p>After Oxley's journey down the Macquarie in 1818 there was a period of
six years without any further exploration. In 1824 Hume and Hovell
reached Port Phillip.</p>

<p>INADEQUACY OF SURVEYS</p>

<p>Even from the very early stages of settlement the definition by survey
of the boundaries of individual properties was an administrative problem.
At the very beginning a small, very small, number of persons in a
continent of almost inconceivable vastness had at their disposal land
which had no owner. It is true that it was the property of the Crown; but
the Crown had already approved of the principle of free grants.
Successive Governors had been generous in the use of this authority.
Oxley reported (26 January 1826) that, up to the year 1810, the total of
alienated land was more than 1,800,000 acres spread over an area of
35,000 square miles, comprising eight counties, the boundaries of which
were undefined.[13] By 1831 the total area of land alienated under the
system of free grants was 3,344,030 acres.[14]</p>

<p>While the exclusives were in actual or virtual control of all
governmental functions any difficulties about boundaries could be settled
by mutual agreement; but this could not possibly continue as settlement
expanded. The alienation of Crown land was ill-controlled, surveys of the
location and boundaries of the several grants were rarely made; and when
made were inadequate in both quality and volume. Most of the land was
actually occupied. Macquarie reported that surveyors had no incentive to
keep pace with occupation since their profit was hardly two shillings and
sixpence for each farm. There was no enthusiasm for routine and efficient
surveying.</p>

<p>These problems were brought into practical focus by the appointment in
July 1811 of Lieutenant John Oxley as Surveyor General. Oxley reached
Sydney on 1 January 1812.[15] This was not his first association with New
South Wales. He had been there on naval duties from 1802 to 1807, and
again from 1808 till 1810. Two years after his arrival he reported to
Macquarie (1814) upon the wide dispersion of grants and farms and the
inadequacy, for the task of survey, of his resources.[16] Macquarie,
transmitting this report to Bathurst in the same year, recorded his
conviction that the duties of a land surveyor in the extended state of
the settlement was much more than Oxley, unaided, was equal to; and
Macquarie asked for the appointment of a deputy surveyor.[17] This
appointment was refused by the Colonial Office, and Oxley was faced with
a task officially recognized as beyond his power.</p>

<p>The growing friction between the free settlers, the emancipists, the
insurgent Macarthur coterie, and the representatives of lawful civil
government has already been mentioned and is repeated here only in
relation to the Surveyor General and his work. The exclusives required
more and more convict labour for their ever-expanding acres, they
resented the granting of civil liberties to time-expired convicts, and
generally opposed most vigorously any liberal policy intended for the
benefit of any section of the community other than their own privileged
group.</p>

<p>Oxley was of this group. Bligh, Macquarie, and Darling had, each in
succession, reported to the Colonial Office that Oxley's association with
the Macarthur coterie was a source of official embarrassment.[18]
Although Macquarie had described Oxley as "intriguing and discontented",
Darling had given him credit for being a "clever man and a useful
officer".[19] In addition to his official responsibilities Oxley was also
the owner of an estate of a thousand acres between Camden and Narellan:
an estate which he had received, while still a naval officer (1808), as a
free grant by direction of Lord Castlereagh: this estate was commended by
Commissioner Bigge as being especially well managed .[20]</p>

<p>Bigge had reported that the business of the Survey Department had
fallen seriously into arrears, either on account of the disproportion of
the establishment to the increase of business in it, or the frequent
interruptions occasioned by the long absences of Oxley, Meehan, and Evans
on tours of discovery; and by the distances at which the operations of
admeasurement were to be executed.[21] He had recommended that the
Surveyor General should have three assistant surveyors: and that a
general division of the whole territory of New South Wales into counties,
hundreds, and parishes was a measure of the highest importance and must
accompany or precede every other plan of general improvements.[22] His
report was not presented to the House of Commons until July 1823, and
Bathurst at once transmitted to the Governor at Sydney that portion of
the report which dealt with the Survey Department.[23] In doing so he
covered the recommendations with official instructions:</p>

<blockquote>You will understand that the recommendations in the
Commissioner's Report have my approbation and sanction; and that I draw
your attention to them for the purpose of their being carried into
effect.[24]</blockquote>

<p>Oxley had, in the meantime, been moved to action. He wrote a minute to
Macquarie (27 July 1821) stating that the great and increasing pressure
of public business in the Survey Department induced him to request such
assistance as would enable him to bring up the great arrears and prevent
in future those serious inconveniences and delays which had unavoidably
been experienced in the execution of this branch of the public service
[25] How far this sudden activity may have resulted from Bigge's
enquiries is speculative. Bigge had left Sydney on 14 February 1821: and
although the contents of Bigge's report could not have been known by
Oxley when he wrote the official minute just quoted, he might well have
known Bigge's views: he was of that group which throughout was intimate
with Bigge.[26] He could not, in any case, have failed to realize during
the course of a searching enquiry, the lack of efficiency in the field of
administration for which he was responsible.</p>

<p>Oxley had, as stated above, asked Macquarie in July 1821 for
assistance to bring up the arrears in the survey. Then, after a long
delay, he submitted to Brisbane a requisition for a complete set of
surveying instruments. This requisition was dated 29 January 1822 and was
forwarded to London by Brisbane on 1 February 1822 asking for early
supply. Two years and seven months later, on 13 August 1824, Brisbane
again forwarded this requisition to London with the comment that as they
were much wanted he requested that they might be forwarded by the
earliest opportunity.[27] But, still another six months later (1 February
1825), Brisbane again forwarded Oxley's requisition.[28] Oxley in writing
to Brisbane referred to his previous letters of 29 January 1822 and 4
August 1824, and said:</p>

<blockquote>I respectfully beg to enclose a quadruple of the requisition
I then made and I am sorry to be obliged to represent to Your Excellency
that the great delay which has attended the supply of instruments has
been attended with very serious inconvenience to the public
service.</blockquote>

<p>Bathurst advised Brisbane, on 21 August 1824, that he had appointed
two assistants to the Surveyor General: that these were men</p>

<blockquote>whose education and rank in life will not only add to the
respectability of the Department but tend to place it on that footing,
with respect to its efficiency which Mr Commissioner Bigge in his Report
so strongly recommended to be done as well as afford at the same time
those additional facilities in the location of the settlers in the which
so many inconvenient delays have...taken place.[29]</blockquote>

<p>The two men were Mr Heneage Finch, who had taken a high degree in
mathematics at Oxford, and Mr Rodd, who had been "highly recommended by
Lord Harrowby".</p>

<p>In October 1823, Oxley had been again sent away from Sydney on
exploration: this time by sea to examine Port Bowen, Port Curtis, and
Moreton Bay.[30] He returned after an absence of three months, having
discovered the Brisbane River. Brisbane, transmitting the report of this
journey, commended Oxley's zeal and intelligence.</p>

<p>Events were moving slowly, but with an irresistible momentum. Brisbane
reported (24 July 1824) that stock in the colony were increasing at a
rate which rendered it quite impossible to suppose that the liberality of
the Crown could keep pace in extending grants with the increase of
stock.[31] This is surprising in view of the liberality of Brisbane who,
during his term, granted more than one million acres according to Oxley's
report already mentioned. Such generous disposition of free land
inevitably brought multiplying difficulties of boundary surveys.</p>

<p><a name="bb"></a>Ultimately the Home Government decided on more
definite action. Bathurst wrote to Brisbane (1 January 1825) a long
despatch "respecting the granting and settlement of the waste lands of
the Crown" and communicated "the decisions which His Majesty's Government
have formed on the questions thus brought under their notice"[32] These
decisions proceeded to repeat, as an official order, Bigge's
recommendation that the whole territory of New South Wales was to be
divided into counties, hundreds, and parishes: declaring that this was a
measure of the highest importance which must accompany or precede every
other plan of general improvements; and "to give the greater solemnity to
this measure, and to carry it into effect with the utmost possible
accuracy" Brisbane was instructed to issue a commission under the great
seal of New South Wales empowering three competent persons, of whom the
Surveyor General was to be the First or Chief Commissioner, to make a
survey of the whole colony.</p>

<p>The instructions then proceeded, without full realization of the
difficulties or of the magnitude of this task, to order that</p>

<blockquote>having thus distributed the Territory of New South Wales into
the necessary political divisions the next object of attention is that of
making a general valuation of the land throughout the
Colony.</blockquote>

<p>The first Commissioners were J. Oxley, W. Cordeaux, and J.
Campbell.[33] Oxley received no special remuneration other than his
salary, but the others received &pound;1 <i>per diem</i> each.</p>

<p>Brisbane left, and Darling arrived, in December 1825: Darling's
Commission contained similar instructions to the effect that a survey and
valuation should be made of "our said Territory of New South Wales".
These instructions were in the conventional form of such documents, and
began with the usual "George R.", although they were in all respects
instructions by the Government and not Royal commands. Although the Royal
prerogative of independent decision had not, at this period, been
entirely surrendered, it is hardly likely that George IV, being what he
was, would have been personally greatly concerned about the survey of
"Botany Bay".</p>

<p>The elements in this official episode have to be given their true
value, because, as will be seen, Mitchell repeatedly invoked "the King's
instructions" throughout his official career, although at the time these
instructions were issued he was not in Australia.</p>

<p>Darling soon gave attention to this troublesome matter of surveys. The
Survey Commissioners made their first report to him on 11 March 1826.[34]
But before this Oxley had been moved to write a report to Darling (26
January 1826). In this report he referred to the Home Government's
instructions as to the disposal of Crown lands and the division of the
whole colony into counties, parishes, etc.; he said that every effort had
been made to bring the surveys up-to-date, to prevent the disappointment
of free settlers arriving from England. But, he pointed out, the area to
be covered was 250 miles long, and 140 miles wide.* While there was no
real difficulty in the proposed division into counties, etc., an
extensive and detailed survey was necessary: and he added:</p>

<blockquote>As soon as the necessary local arrangements can be made I
shall submit the extent of practical assistance which may be required in
field surveyors, draftsmen, etc.[35]</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* He was then referring only to the districts in
which "settlement" and grants of land had been distributed.]</blockquote>

<p>The Survey Commissioners considered this very comprehensive report,
but pointed out that the great obstacle to any progress in the policy for
disposal of Crown lands was the great lag in the work of the Survey
Department, "owing to which a very considerable extent of the lands,
already located and granted, remain to this day unsurveyed (11 March
1826)".[36] Then they recommended that every practicable means should be
used to ensure that the survey should overtake, keep pace with, and
precede, the demands for land by sale and by grant. They also endorsed
Oxley's requests for more staff.</p>

<p>This period was one of rather leisurely action. Oxley had asked for
more staff in January 1826; the Commissioners had supported his request
in March:[37] Darling reported all this to Bathurst in July, stating that
he had given instructions that the general survey must be commenced at
once, but that Oxley was totally unprepared to commence the general
survey or even to deal with arrears with his existing staff, and asked
that half a dozen "respectable men, good practical surveyors", be sent
out immediately; he added:</p>

<blockquote>the remissness in this branch of the service appears highly
culpable, it being about fourteen months since the Commissioners were
appointed, and nothing has, in fact, been done. This, however, is only
one proof of the relaxation which has prevailed
generally.[38]</blockquote>

<p>Darling followed this with another despatch in September 1826 in which
he said:</p>

<blockquote>Mr Oxley is a very clever man; but he has been too little
controlled, and I am satisfied will never submit to the drudgery of
carrying on the details of the Department. Besides there are many who
doubt his impartiality.[39]</blockquote>

<p>Darling had also in his despatch of July dealt with the staff of the
department. There were then eight surveyors, and some clerks, but Darling
pointed out that many of them had acquired free grants of land, The
salary which they received, he added, was small and consequently they did
not confine their attention to the service of the Government, but were
concerned more with the obvious advantages of developing their own
land.</p>

<p>Then Bathurst wrote (4 December 1826), in reply, that he would appoint
four surveyors and two draftsmen, but that it would take some little time
to find competent persons; he added:</p>

<blockquote>Nothing perhaps will tend more to placing the Surveyor
General's Department on a more efficient footing than it hitherto has
been than assigning to the officers such remuneration for their services
as to place them above temptation and thus to hold out sufficient
encouragement for the zealous performance of their
duties.[40]</blockquote>

<p>To provide this "encouragement" two of the eight officers were to be
retired, two were to remain on their present salary, one was to receive
an additional &pound;50 per annum, and two an additional &pound;100 per
annum each.</p>

<p>Comment is hardly necessary: but the incident does emphasize the
conditions of Colonial Office administration under which it seemed
desirable to senior officers in the colony to secure patronage and
influence "at home" wherever possible.</p>

<p>In this chapter a very brief review has been made of the conditions
preceding Mitchell's arrival in New South Wales. Against a background of
patronage and influence, in an atmosphere of intrigue and disloyalty to
the Governor, a spirit of self-reliance and Australianism was slowly
developing; the geographical discoveries resulting from successive
explorations had intensified administrative difficulties, and the chaotic
state of detailed boundary surveys demanded urgently an orderly and
progressive systematic survey according to established technical
methods.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V - Governor Darling</h2>

<p>Governor Darling, on receiving advice of Mitchell's appointment,
replied (28 July 1826) that he had derived much satisfaction from the
appointment of so competent an officer:[1] and, two months later, on 23
September 1827, Mitchell, with his family, arrived in Sydney in the
<i>Prince Regent</i>.[2]</p>

<p>As Mitchell was to have personal contact throughout the rest of his
life with all the notable Australian explorers of this period, it is of
some interest to note that Charles Sturt had then been exactly four
months in Sydney, while Allan Cunningham had only been back in Sydney for
two months after that northern journey on which he had discovered the
Darling Downs.</p>

<p>Mitchell took up his duties at once as Deputy Surveyor General, but,
after only six months, Darling reported (27 March 1828) that the long and
severe illness of Oxley had obliged him to put Mitchell in charge of the
department. He expressed his regret that Mitchell had not more local
experience,</p>

<blockquote>but his zeal, assiduity, and professional knowledge afford me
every reason to expect that the duties entrusted to him will be conducted
in a satisfactory manner.[3]</blockquote>

<p>Two months later (28 May), Darling reported that Oxley had died, and
he had appointed Mitchell to succeed him as Surveyor General, in
accordance with his previous instructions.[4] In December of the same
year Captain S. A. Perry was appointed Deputy Surveyor General.[5] Perry
remained in this position during the whole of Mitchell's period as
Surveyor General.</p>

<p>From being a surveyor and draftsman of established ability, Mitchell
now, only eight months after his arrival, assumed very great
administrative responsibilities in a territory of continental size and of
unknown nature, under rapidly evolving social conditions of quite unusual
complexity. He was then thirty-six years old--and was to hold this
responsible position for twenty-seven years.</p>

<p>Macquarie had done much to end the "convict" period, with its misery
and rapacity: a period when savage floggings were accepted as normal,
when an unscrupulous coterie in their lust for power and wealth defied,
and even momentarily destroyed, the authority of the Crown. He had done
much to establish the social position of the time-expired and emancipated
convict. Brisbane had faced the problem of conflict between the
emancipist and the growing flood of free emigrant settlers. Neither of
these Governors had adequately dealt with the land problem, while the
survey of the territory, and the definition of the boundaries of the
rapidly multiplying land "grants" and "purchases" were still hopelessly
in arrears.[6] Oxley, notwithstanding Darling's censure that he would
never submit to the drudgery of carrying on the details of the
department, had actually accomplished much. His long memoranda on the
subject of land tenure from 1824 to 1828 indicate that he was being
called upon to achieve results which were beyond all the resources of his
limited staff.[7]</p>

<p>It may be supposed that as a director of the Bank of Australia, as a
private owner of a country estate, and as the recipient of "fees", there
were distractions from normal official enthusiasm; indeed Darling hints
at this in his despatches of 22 July and 4 September 1826.[8] But the
Colonial Office, even six years after Bigge's report, had not responded
to his demands for increased staff, and their response to the request for
increased pay was discouraging. For a long period also he was without
surveying instruments. Having regard to all the conditions of the time,
in retrospect after 125 years, his achievements should be applauded and
judgment reserved in respect of all else. Mitchell was, however, faced
with the task of overtaking all the arrears of neglected work while at
the same time keeping pace with the demands of rapidly expanding
settlement. In a private letter to Hay (17 March 1829) he stated that
Oxley had left the office in great confusion.[9]</p>

<p>On his arrival in Sydney Mitchell lived first in Sussex Street: an
advertisement appears in the <i>Australian</i> of 27 November 1829
notifying the sale by auction of five allotments "in the most genteel
part of Sussex Street near the residences of Major Mitchell..."</p>

<p>In October 1831 he was given a grant of 9 acres, 3 roods, and 27
perches: he must have been given permission to occupy this land at an
earlier date for on 4 June 1829 he wrote to his mother that he was
building a house on this land.[10] This house he named "Craigend" after
his birthplace: it was in Darlinghurst, close to the present King's
Cross; Craigend Street and Craigend Place have preserved the name, they
are between Surrey Street and Bayswater Road. The grant was gazetted as
being in Alexandria, that being, at that time, the name of the parish in
which the grant was located. Of this house Mrs Felton Mathews records in
her journal that, on 22 April 1933, she called on Mrs Mitchell and Mrs
Perry at Darlinghurst where there were several very handsome stone houses
of which "Major Mitchell's is by far the most distinguished for
architectural design"[11] (<a href="#p4">Plate IV</a>). In this home
assigned female convicts were employed and Mitchell's verdict was that
they were very bad.[12]</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival, Mitchell, following up the deferred
application in London, applied for a grant of land, and Darling in 1828
made him a grant of 2,560 acres in the county of St. Vincent on the south
coast of New South Wales.[13] In December 1829 Mitchell requested
permission to relinquish this land and to be allowed to select in a
different situation. This application was approved and he selected an
equal area in the county of Camden (<a href="#m2">Map II</a>). This was
in the region then known as East Bargo, between Appin and Bargo: it is
now Portion 2 in the parish of Wilton, county of Camden. The grant was
made to Mitchell under regulations published on 4 June 1830 in
consideration of his fifteen years of service in the army. An order for
Mitchell to take possession of the land was issued on 7 May 1831,
although the grant was not formally issued until 1835. Later (13 December
1834) he purchased for &pound;312 10s. an adjoining block of 1,250 acres
(Portion 3, parish of Wilton). The combined portions formed a long
triangular area between the town of Wilton and Moolgun Creek (Allan's
Creek) on the west, and Cascade Creek and Cataract River on the east,
with the Nepean River near Douglas Park as the base of the triangle on
the north. He named this property "Parkhall", maintaining family
associations in Scotland.[14]</p>

<p>There is a curious note in a letter written by Mitchell from London in
1847 to his son Livingstone. He said:</p>

<blockquote>Mr Cooper has handsomely presented me with land on the
Woronora, which, added to what I already hold there, makes the property
complete...on the way to Parkhall by the range.[15]</blockquote>

<p>The Woronora River is a considerable distance from Mitchell's Parkhall
property.</p>

<p><b>MAP II. Plan of Mitchell's country property "Parkhall" in the
County of Camden</b></p>
</center>

<p>Mitchell set men to the work of clearing such parts of this land as
were suitable for the use of agriculture and farming purposes, but it was
not until 1841, on his return from England, that he took any action
towards making a residence there.[16] When giving evidence before the
House of Commons Select Committee on Transportation in 1838, he was asked
whether he had ever possessed land in Australia. He replied, "Yes! I
purchased land." This was only partly true.</p>

<p>There are indications that at this stage he was not free from private
troubles. Writing to his mother from Sydney (1 February 1828), he said
that "Mrs Mitchell is not very fond of this country", and in November
1829 his father-in-law was reminding him of a loan of &pound;800.[17]</p>

<p>In 1829 his brother Houston, who had previously tried his fortunes in
Jamaica, arrived in Sydney, and soon secured a grant of 1,280
acres.[18]</p>

<p>Mitchell's sons were educated at Sydney College: he expressed the
opinion that the education for boys in Sydney was very good, but was not
of a high standard for girls.[19]</p>

<p>Turning now to the official side of Mitchell's life, Darling was at
first very favourably impressed and advised Secretary of State Murray (1
February 1829) that he could not say too much in favour of Mitchell's
zeal and qualifications; he recommended that after five years' service
the salary should be increased by &pound;200 per annum.[20] Mitchell's
salary had already risen, on his promotion to Surveyor General, from
&pound;600 to &pound;1,000.[21]</p>

<p>The state of the survey was still unsatisfactory. The <i>Monitor</i>
newspaper had commented on "the dreadful situation of grants of land
owing to the state of the Surveyor's Office".[22]</p>

<p>Darling reported to Secretary of State Huskisson that in many cases
the settlers were not assured of the extent or limits of their property:
their boundaries when they came to be measured would be found to overlap
owing to the vague descriptions given by the settlers when reporting the
selections they had made. Others had settled upon land to which they had
no claim; and, having established themselves, were not disposed to yield
to those who had obtained a grant of the same selection.</p>

<p>Even before he had actually become Surveyor General, Mitchell was
invited by Darling to submit his views upon the most satisfactory method
of dealing with the unsatisfactory state of the survey of the colony.
Darling had said (13 May 1828):</p>

<blockquote>If means are not used speedily to advance the survey of the
Colony and facilitate the more regular location of settlers, the
embarrassments, which already exist, must become irremediable and the
foundation of others will be laid, as injurious to the public as to the
interests of private individuals;</blockquote>

<p>he then added that Mitchell was definitely of opinion that a proper
trigonometrical survey was an essential preliminary to more detailed
surveys; and that he, Darling, had authorized the commencement of this
work in the county of Argyle.</p>

<p>He pointed out, however, that the delay in detailed surveys of
settlers' properties would produce discontent, as title-deeds could not
be issued until the properties were measured, adding the plaintive plea,
already very familiar, that the general survey without considerable
additional staff was "totally impracticable".[23]</p>

<p>He sent a statement showing that the staff of surveyors in 1828 was
only one more than that of 1826, and, of the latter, four were no longer
in the department; that unfortunately these four were personally
acquainted with every occurrence connected with the department and were
perfectly at home in any question which required reference.[24] The names
of the surveyors at this stage were R. Hoddle, J. B. Richards, H. H.
Finch, J. Ralfe, T. Florance, R. Dixon, G. B. White, P. Elliott, J.
Abbott, W. A. Govett.</p>

<p>It is important for the purpose of this story to remember this
recommendation by Mitchell, as this question of a "proper trigonometrical
survey" by a professional surveyor was to recur officially again and
again to the very end of his career.</p>

<p>It should also be noted at this stage that there were, at this period,
only three main roads: the western road over the Blue Mountains to
Bathurst; the southern road via Camden, Men-angle, Picton, to Moss Vale
and Sutton Forest; and the northern road to West Maitland via Wiseman's
Ferry and Wollombi.</p>

<p>Although the instructions from the Home Government had directed a
survey and valuation of the whole territory of New South Wales, which
included all of Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and the Northern
Territory, actually all that was then contemplated was survey and
valuation of the settled districts, which included the coastal strip and
scattered areas in the Hunter valley and around Bathurst and Goulburn.
Coincident with Mitchell's arrival, however, the horizon, and the
involved problems, had been rapidly extending. Hume and Hovell had, in
1824, made their important journey overland to Port Phillip, and Oxley
had returned from his journeys down the Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers
convinced that the marshes which had stopped his progress on each river
indicated the existence of a great inland sea in which each of those
rivers ended. On the second journey (1818) he had gone eastward from Mt.
Harris to the coast, crossing the Castlereagh, the Peel, and other rivers
having their source in the Liverpool Ranges, finally following the
Hastings River down to Port Macquarie. On this journey he crossed, and
reported on, the great Liverpool Plains.</p>

<p>After this second journey of Oxley's there had been no northward
exploration until, in 1827, Allan Cunningham went overland to the Darling
Downs. On this journey Cunningham crossed the Gwydir and the Dumaresq.
Darling reported the result of this expedition to Secretary of State
Goderich (12 November 1827) with warm commendation and noted that</p>

<blockquote>it is due to this gentleman to observe that this expedition
had been performed without any expectation having been held out to him of
remuneration, for the services he had rendered.[25]</blockquote>

<p>Darling's report contained one very significant passage:</p>

<blockquote>I would observe that Mr Cunningham appears desirous to render
the result of his expedition confirmatory of a favorite hypothesis, the
existence of an inland sea.</blockquote>

<p>The following year, 1828, Cunningham went by sea to Brisbane and from
there, moving inland, connected up with his previous journey, thus
completely defining an overland route from Sydney to Brisbane.[26]</p>

<p>Three months after Cunningham's return from this journey Darling sent
Captain Charles Sturt northwards to ascertain the course and fate of the
River Macquarie, and the extent and description of the surrounding
country. Darling stated that, while Sturt was well qualified by
scientific knowledge and enthusiasm, he had little knowledge of the
country, and therefore Hamilton Hume was being attached to the
expedition. Sturt was away from November 1828 to April 1829. On this
journey he moved westward from the Macquarie marshes and discovered the
Darling River near Bourke; he also showed that the Bogan, Macquarie, and
Castlereagh Rivers all joined in with the Darling, and proved that, at
least in the country he crossed, there was no inland sea.</p>

<p>At this stage, very soon after his arrival, records of Mitchell's
personal reactions begin to appear. Before setting out on this expedition
Sturt had written to Mitchell (30 September 1828) asking his advice as to
the best route to follow. Mitchell replied:</p>

<blockquote>Having clearly understood from His Majesty's Government that
I was likely to be employed on a journey into the interior, it is not
very natural that I should be glad that the Governor here is determined
to send another person on a service which has been considered to belong
to the office of my predecessor.<br>
<br>
To you individually, however, I shall be glad to contribute any
assistance or advice in my power.[27]</blockquote>

<p>This attitude was apparent, even more strongly, in his direct official
relationships. Darling had recommended his brother-in-law, William
Dumaresq, for appointment to the Surveyor General's Department, but this
was not approved by the Colonial Office. Writing to his brother John
(October 1828) Mitchell referred to this and said: "You may easily
imagine how pleasant this must make it for me here."[28]</p>

<p>He had already written to Hay, Permanent Under-Secretary at the
Colonial Office, in pursuance of an understanding between them in London
that privileged personal letters would be acceptable.</p>

<p>The letters now to be quoted were the first of a series of personal
letters from Mitchell to the Colonial Office which continued persistently
for the next twenty years.</p>

<p>He wrote to Hay on 80 September 1828:</p>

<blockquote>I now avail myself of the permission you gave me to write,
for I now feel the necessity for your support that I may maintain my
ground in the office to which His Majesty's Government appointed me. I
have now sufficient experience (and have travelled enough) to enable me
to supply you with some information concerning the state of this Colony
generally...I am persuaded that you can never hear of anything creditable
done by me under Governor Darling, whose jealous relatives I may almost
charge with a conspiracy against the little fame and credit I have earned
by a life of persevering industry...I embarked for this country with the
prospect of succeeding Mr Oxley in exploring the interior and surveying
the physical geography of this Colony, but have hitherto been
disappointed in all those prospects which induced me to accept an
appointment here. An officer on full pay of a regiment here (who never
travelled anywhere) is to be sent to explore the interior, while the
Governor wishes the joint Commissioners of Survey and Valuation (who are
not surveyors) to conduct a survey of the Colony! It being arranged I
should not leave Sydney. Many people believe that all this is intended to
make me resign in favour of Captain Dumaresq...I enclose copies of
correspondence with the Governor...by these letters you will perceive
that while I am prevented from exploring the country beyond the Colony, I
am not to be allowed the control of the Survey to be made within
it.[29]</blockquote>

<p>Again he wrote to Hay (15 December 1828), a "private" letter from
which are taken the following extracts:</p>

<blockquote>I am now aware of changes (to my great joy) in the
Government...it must appear surprising to Sir George Murray that the
Governor should not leave those duties to me which belong to my
office...The Commissioners are merely a clog on the progress of business.
If Sir George Murray will only allow me a year or two of unshackled
control of the affairs of the Department as my predecessor had, and rid
me of the Commissioners, I promise to accomplish in a short time all that
is required of them and complete a survey of the Colony. At present I am
confined to Sydney...a Captain Sturt has been sent well equipped on an
excursion to the interior, a duty my predecessor considered as belonging
to his Department.[30]</blockquote>

<p>In these letters the reference to "an officer on full pay who has
never travelled anywhere" is to Sturt; and the change of government which
gave him "great joy" was the appointment of his patron and friend,
Murray, as Minister of State for the Colonies. The reference to the
Commissioners is to that body which had been established (see <a href=
"#bb">earlier</a>) by Bathurst "to give greater solemnity" to the survey
of the country and the valuation of land.</p>

<p>In yet another "private" letter to Hay, dated 18 October 1829,
Mitchell said:</p>

<blockquote>I shall not trouble you with any observation on the equipment
now in progress for Captain Sturt, the Governor's relative, for a second
exploring expedition to the interior; the Director of Public Works being
fully occupied in preparing for him boats, carts, etc., while officers of
my Department meet with great difficulty in obtaining the smallest
requisite: neither shall I offer any comment on the introduction into my
office of another relative of General Darling as a candidate to be
Assistant Surveyor, for 1 am of opinion that these matters will be
speedily rectified.[31]</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell must have known that Sturt was not, in any degree of
relationship, a relative of Darling.</p>

<p>It is curious to note at this stage that Murray wrote to Darling (10
October 1829):</p>

<blockquote>Allusions made so often in your despatches to some secret
enemy whom you suppose to have prejudiced you in the opinion of H.M.
Govt...there is not the slightest ground for any such apprehension. No
private representation against you has ever been made.[32]</blockquote>

<p>On 21 November 1829 Darling announced to Murray that Sturt had left on
another journey, this time to discover the fate of the Murrumbidgee,
following it, if possible, to the sea. In the event of its termination in
the marshes, he was to cross the Darling to discover the fate of that
river. Sturt travelled down the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers,
discovered and identified the Darling junction, and continued on till he
proved that the Murray flowed into the sea at Lake Alexandrina. By his
two journeys to the Darling, Murrumbidgee, and Murray Rivers, he had
revealed the nature and quality of the wide plains of the interior, and
the direction and value of the great waterways of the Murray basin.
Sturt, more than any other, extended the limits of geographical
knowledge; and, in doing so, had greatly increased the problems of
governmental control over a population rapidly spreading over a limitless
region, without rights, without defined boundaries, and almost without
civil obligations.</p>

<p>The years 1829 and 1830 were marked by transition from Darling's
original satisfaction with Mitchell through mounting antagonism, to an
ultimate climax. For Mitchell it was a period of expansion and
development.</p>

<p>Murray showed every desire to provide adequate staff for the Surveyor
General's Department. He provided a steady flow of trained men, until by
8 May 1830 the staff consisted of four surveyors (R. Hoddle, H. H. Finch,
J. B. Richards, J. Ralfe), eighteen assistant surveyors, and seven
draftsmen:[33] as an example of the importance of patronage and influence
in London an extract from Under-Secretary Hay to Darling (21 October
1826) may be quoted:</p>

<blockquote>If you should have any opportunity of advancing Mr Hoddle in
his department, without injustice to those surveyors who have been
confirmed by Lord Bathurst, it will afford me much pleasure to be enabled
to communicate the same to Lord George Cavendish, who is interested in
his welfare.[34]</blockquote>

<p>Murray spoke of placing the department on that efficient footing so
much desired by the Home Government.[35] Mitchell had discharged two
incompetent officers, and, generally, there was every indication of
activity.</p>

<p><a name="ff"></a>On 1 February 1828, Mitchell wrote to his mother in
Scotland:</p>

<blockquote>I measured a base of a mile on the smooth sandy beach at
Botany Bay yesterday for the purpose of making a grand survey of the
whole country...I came, as it were, accidentally on a brass plate fixed
in the rock marking the first spot where Captain Cook had landed on these
shores.[36]</blockquote>

<p>This measured base-line was the subject of adverse comment many years
later, as will be seen at the end of this volume.*</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* The brass plate was placed in position on the
face of a cliff facing the entrance to Botany Bay by the Philosophical
Society of Australasia in 1821: it is still in the same position as it
was when Mitchell saw it.]</blockquote>

<p>From this time Mitchell and his staff were actively at work on the
"trigonometrical survey" and were making definite progress. In April
1827, Darling had appointed an army officer (Lockyer) as surveyor of
roads and bridges with three subaltern officers as assistant surveyors;
Murray (26 May 1829) had altered this arrangement, transferring these
duties to the Surveyor General.</p>

<p>So, from the time of receipt of Murray's despatch, which would be
towards the end of 1829, Mitchell was responsible not only for the survey
and valuation of lands but also for the construction of roads and
bridges. The Board of Commissioners of Survey still existed; but
Mitchell's private letter to Hay of 15 December 1828 (already quoted) had
been effective, and Murray instructed Darling (6 May 1830) that the
Commissioners were to be discontinued, their functions becoming the
responsibility of the Surveyor General.</p>

<p>In view of Mitchell's later claims and assertions, the full text of
Murray's despatch to Darling (6 May 1830) is quoted here: <a name=
"hh"></a></p>

<blockquote>As it is deemed advisable to dispense with the further
services of the Commissioners who, in pursuance of the Royal instructions
addressed to you on 17 July 1825, have been appointed to survey and value
all the waste and ungranted lands in the Colony under your Government, I
am to signify to you the King's Commands that you do forthwith revoke the
Commissions which you may have issued in favour of the persons at present
discharging those duties, and that the performance of them may be
entrusted to the Surveyor General who, with the aid of the Assistant
Surveyors will, in future, be held responsible for all arrangements
connected with the survey and division of the Territory.[37]</blockquote>

<p>This despatch should be noted because of the great importance given to
it by Mitchell, who invoked it frequently in later years, citing it as a
command direct from the King in person. Actually at this very time George
IV was so ill on his last fatal illness that he would not be giving any
attention to the administration of the Surveyor General's Department in
Sydney, even if such detailed administrative interest on the part of the
King in person would at any time have been conceivable.</p>

<p>As Murray's despatch would not reach Darling until towards the end of
1830 Mitchell, as Chief Commissioner, still had the Board of
Commissioners whose relationship, if any, to Mitchell's new function of
control of roads and bridges was undefined.</p>

<p>In May 1830, this Board of Commissioners had recommended that as the
roads from Sydney to Parramatta and Liverpool had fallen into a condition
of serious disrepair they should be realigned to shorten the distance (by
a mile and a half to Parramatta and by three miles to Liverpool),
following the contours, eliminating seven bridges and every hill.</p>

<p>This reasonable and proper recommendation by the responsible body was
rejected by Darling. The Colonial Secretary advised Mitchell that the
Governor was not aware of any intention on the part of the Government to
alter the existing line of roads; he was satisfied that this was not
expedient, and added:</p>

<blockquote>I am also recommended to take this opportunity of stating
that His Excellency, having received other plans at various times from
the Surveyor General of alterations and changes which he proposes should
be made, feels it his duty to point out to that officer that it will be
desirable in future, before he occupies himself in matters of which the
Government is not cognizant, to ascertain whether the undertaking is
considered expedient, otherwise he must see that much valuable time may
be wasted...Whenever those arrangements which are indispensable to the
accommodation of the public, and to which the Surveyor General's
attention has been directed by the Government, shall have been completed,
and the time and means of the latter will permit of improvement being
effected, it will then be a fit opportunity to entertain propositions of
this nature. But that in cases where the public already possess good
roads it would hardly be advisable to incur the trouble and expense of
making new lines, merely because they would be more convenient or a
little shorter.</blockquote>

<p>This, too, was an administratively justifiable attitude: with
inadequate resources of both money and labour Darling was bound to
consider priority of urgency. Both Mitchell and Darling were right,
although Darling's decision could have been conveyed more wisely. This
was only part of a conflict which was to become acute.</p>

<p>Then occurred another dispute with Darling about the road over the
Blue Mountains to Bathurst. The road which had been constructed by Cox in
1815 followed a very steep gradient down the side of Mt. York: a little
later Collitt had found a new route to the north-east of this old track
with a better gradient, although even this was a gradient of one in four;
this new track joined. the old one at the foot of Mt. York. At this point
of junction Collitt established an inn which became an historic
landmark.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1829 Darling had instructed Mitchell to make a
re-survey of the road between Mt. York and Bathurst.[38] Although Darling
had not intended that a new route down the mountains should be marked out
Mitchell, with a generous interpretation of his instructions, sought a
better route than that down Mt. York. He found</p>

<blockquote>a ridge nearly parallel to Mt. York but more in the direct
line cutting off the angle from Mt. York to Collitt's. I have named this
point of hill Mt. Victoria.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell being responsible for the construction of roads had actually
started work on this new line. Darling, learning of this, sent
instructions to Mitchell that he could not sanction any alteration from
the previous route, and declared (21 July 1830) through the Colonial
Secretary:</p>

<blockquote>without meaning to doubt the superiority of this projected
line over the others His Excellency cannot but think that in the course
of time some other line will be found, as superior to that now proposed
as that is to the one now forming. And it is, therefore, impossible to
sanction such repeated changes...His Excellency again desires that it may
be laid down as a general principle that unless the disadvantages of any
existing line of road are of a very serious nature, it is better, under
present circumstances, to put up with them than commence a new line which
cannot be completed but at a considerable expense and the abandonment of
that which has been accomplished at the cost of years of labour.<br>
<br>
His Excellency supposed that you had understood his views in this respect
from the observations he made to you when you presented the plan of the
new road to the southward. What is now said will, he trusts, remove any
doubt from your mind, and that you will be aware how important it is that
there should be no misapprehension in matters of this
nature.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell lost no time in replying: writing to Colonial Secretary
Macleay (27 July 1830) he first repeated verbatim the text of the
Governor's comments, which has just been quoted, and proceeded:</p>

<blockquote>after such observations and the censure with which your
letter concludes, few (I take leave to remark) would suppose that I was
actually sent here by the Governor to lay down a road...I defy any man
ever to point out any material improvement in the lines laid down by me,
for they have been marked only after a more careful survey of the ground
than is made for such a purpose even in Europe, and I feel confident that
were the exertions of road discoverers stimulated with the promise of
even a million of acres they could not improve what now rests on my own
responsibility.</blockquote>

<p>The controversy continued, Darling insisted that his instructions to
Mitchell applied only to the road beyond the mountains and insisted that
the old road (Collitt's) should be repaired and Mitchell's new road
abandoned. Mitchell, however, persisted and would not give way, meanwhile
keeping the gangs at work on his new road, stating (30 August 1830) that
it would be ready in six weeks. Darling, on 2 September, surrendered and
cancelled his instructions to discontinue the new road. The road was
formally opened by Darling's successor, Bourke, in October 1832 (<a href=
"#p5">Plate V</a>). In the letter of 31 July from Darling reference had
been made to the "new road to the southward": during the expansion of
settlement a track had been formed from Bong Bong through (in modern
terms) Moss Vale to Canyonleigh; and thence, following the Wollondilly,
to Goulburn. This route was through rough country and involved two
crossings of the Wollondilly River. Mitchell plotted a new route through
Berrima, then along the ridge of highlands between the Shoalhaven and
Wollondilly valleys.</p>

<p>Thus Mitchell had, by the end of 1830, plotted new roads to Parramatta
and Liverpool; had marked out the line of the great south road; and had
found a new route for, and had constructed, the road down the Blue
Mountains. The south and west lines of road laid down by him have
remained without material alteration, and are the present main roads. The
north road to the Hunter River had previously been surveyed by Finch
under instructions from Governor Brisbane.[39]</p>

<p>But this was a period of increasing tension between Darling and
Mitchell. On 12 January 1830 (Murray's instructions having been received)
it was notified in the <i>Gazette</i> that the Department of Roads and
Bridges had been abolished and that the duties were to be transferred to
the office of the Surveyor General, to whom communications should be
addressed. Darling would have received Murray's despatch placing the
control of roads and bridges under Mitchell about October 1829: and he
wrote to Murray in January 1830, stating that he could not conceal his
apprehension that this arrangement would materially interfere with the
general survey of the colony: that Mitchell already had more duties than
he could. conveniently perform.[40] On 7 July 1830, when the dispute
about the Mt. Victoria road was at its height, a further notice was
inserted in the <i>Gazette</i> informing the public that the Department
of Roads and Bridges was to be superintended by Assistant Surveyor
Nicholson, whose orders all the other assistants were directed to
obey.[41] This was an unusual course as it made Mitchell's own
subordinate officers independent of his control.</p>

<p>In September 1830, Darling reported to Murray that the experience of
nine months had convinced him that the change had produced conditions
infinitely less efficient and more expensive. He was satisfied that
neither department would be properly carried out until the two were again
separated. Mitchell, he said, should merely survey and lay down the line
of any road without being responsible for the engineering work of
construction.[42]</p>

<p>Murray had sent out two assistant surveyors to replace two of
Mitchell's survey men assigned to roads and bridges duty. This action
must have been taken by Murray on Mitchell's direct recommendation as
Darling expressed to Murray (21 January 1831) his regret that such action
should have been taken without any reference to him as the local
Governor; and he continued:</p>

<blockquote>I perceive from the tone Major Mitchell has lately
assumed...that he is disposed to dispute the authority of Government and
its power to interfere with his arrangements.[43]</blockquote>

<p>Finally, Mitchell was advised by letter from Colonial Secretary
Macleay on 4 December 1830, that the Roads Department was to be
re-established and composed of assistant surveyors who were to be
altogether independent of Mitchell's orders. Darling had found this
arrangement of two active departments being under Mitchell's control so
unsatisfactory that he had ended it, and ordered that the attention of
the Surveyor General should not be diverted from the duties of his office
by directing the details of the Roads Department. The control of roads
and bridges was placed under the Colonial Secretary. This change was made
without the prior approval of the Home Government; but, on receiving
official advice of this change from Darling, Goderich, who had succeeded
Murray as Secretary of State, replied (23 April 1831) that,
notwithstanding Darling's objection to the arrangement made by Murray, he
would not consent to Darling's alterations.</p>

<p>Before this decision could reach Sydney the whole issue had become
critical, the crisis being forced by Mitchell. The precipitating issue
was the decision by Darling to remove the roads and bridges from
Mitchell's control. Mitchell had taken the unusual course of forwarding
to Murray, through Darling, letters of official protest. These letters
were dated 15 and 22 December 1830, 28 January and 7 February 1831.[44]
As these letters were officially transmitted through Darling, he was
obliged to take official notice of them, and he referred them to the
Executive Council. Mitchell also took the unusual course of appealing,
and forwarding duplicates of the correspondence direct, to the Secretary
of State: sending also copies of all the correspondence privately to Hay.
In these letters to Murray, Mitchell had severely criticized certain
actions of the Governor relating to events which had occurred at various
times throughout the three years since he had been appointed Surveyor
General.</p>

<p>The principal issue which emerged from the very voluminous minutes and
correspondence was that Mitchell had objected to certain of his actions
having been overridden by Darling. In effect, he claimed that the King's
instructions, to which reference has already been made, prevented the
Governor from overriding any decision made by him as Survey Commissioner,
and, in fact, vested in him an authority independent of the Governor. An
extract from one of his letters will illustrate this attitude; to Murray
he said:</p>

<blockquote>I can readily anticipate that the appointment of overseers,
trifling and nominal as the patronage is, will be transferred from a high
and independent office like this, to which you have been pleased to
appoint me, to one constituted by local authority in the face of it.<br>
<br>
<p>The effects of the interference on the part of the local Government in
such matters are not more painful and discouraging to me than they are
prejudicial to the public service.[45]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, to be sent through the Governor to whom he was in all respects
subordinate, was bad enough: but his language and phrasing in other of
his communications was not of that dignified quality which is proper in
official correspondence.</p>

<p>Mitchell wrote also direct to Hay a private letter (20 March 1831)
from which the following extracts are significant:</p>

<blockquote>Through your kindness many early grievances were redressed.
Things have come to such a crisis at length as to induce me to address
these letters to the Secretary of State. It is impossible to respect a
Governor who, conscious of an officer's services and his perseverance in
the performance of his duties still would persecute him even to the
prejudice of the public service...There is no species of injustice worse
than that of robbing him, whose chief object is fame, of that reward he
seeks by years of unusual exertion in the performance of his duty...The
Governor at first ill-advised (as I suppose) has at length become my
personal enemy...if I have been guilty of neglect of duty it has been my
private duty, my duty to my family, or duties of religion, all of which I
have neglected by giving up my whole time to the performance of pressing
public duties here.[46]</blockquote>

<p>He added that as he had been refused leave of absence he must either
submit to the same treatment for a considerable time or sacrifice his
appointment.</p>

<p>Darling placed the whole of the correspondence, and the related
official papers, before the Executive Council which deliberately
considered the position in sessions extending from 28 February to 15
March 1831. They considered the question of the "King's instructions"
which Mitchell had invoked as his authority, and which he claimed had
been referred to him officially. On this issue they found that these
documents had never been transmitted to the Commissioners, and that
neither to the Commissioners nor to Mitchell</p>

<blockquote>was it at any time competent to make any assumption of power
or discretion whatever grounded upon a document to the very existence of
which they had never been authorized to refer.[47]</blockquote>

<p>Darling stated independently that these "King's instructions" never
had been and never could have been communicated to Mitchell
officially.</p>

<p>The Executive Council, after exhaustive consideration, brought the
whole painful business to a close by supporting Darling's authority, and
rebuking Mitchell: saying that the language he employed had been
inconsistent with the deference and respect which should be manifested by
every subordinate officer to the head of the Government under which he
serves.</p>

<p>Darling, on 28 March 1831, forwarded the whole of the papers to the
Secretary of State, and also a personal letter to Hay. In these letters
he pointed out that, so early as 7 May 1828 (while Mitchell was still
"acting" during Oxley's illness), he had pointed out personally to
Mitchell the impropriety of indulging in any intemperate or angry
feelings in his official correspondence. Darling continued:</p>

<blockquote>I speak from the experience of three years, during which
period I have discovered nothing in him to induce me to think him a man
of arrangement; but on the contrary since the Department has been
extended, it has appeared to me that he was unable to conduct it with any
degree of advantage, while a great part of his time is taken up in
squabbling with the departments and individuals with whom he has to act
or communicate,[48]</blockquote>

<p>and he also said that Mitchell had been guilty of repeated acts of
disobedience of orders; and of disrespectful conduct both to the Governor
and to the Council. He spoke also of Mitchell's ill and ungovernable
temper, and concluded:</p>

<blockquote>The Minutes of the Executive Council prove, without entering
into the various subjects of his representations, that Major Mitchell
cannot, with any prospect of advantage to the public service, or respect
for the character of the local Government be continued in the office of
Surveyor General.[49]</blockquote>

<p>Just before the conclusion of the enquiry by the Executive Council,
Mitchell had (18 March) applied for leave of absence to proceed to
England. Concerning this, Darling wrote:</p>

<blockquote>I have declined permitting Major Mitchell to return Home on
leave. I did not suspend him from office only from an apprehension that
some inconvenience might possibly be occasioned by his discontinuing to
act: the same reason would prevent me granting him leave of absence: but
there is still a stronger, and I trust he will not be permitted to return
Home, retaining his office, until the matter now at issue is
determined.</blockquote>

<p>Covering all this correspondence Darling wrote another letter, which,
having a special interest as indicating the relations existing between
the Governor and the Colonial Office, has been included in <a href=
"#appb">Appendix B</a>. In this he said that he had been deterred from
reporting Mitchell earlier by the knowledge that he had not, in other
cases, received from the Secretary of State the support to which, as
Governor, he was properly entitled. He had no doubt that Mitchell was
well aware that he incurred little risk by his insubordination, and he
added:</p>

<blockquote>If the local Government is not supported, but should be left
exposed to the cavillings of every malcontent, or be subject without
redress to the insolence and opposition of its immediate servants, a
state of things will arise ere long, which may be regretted when too
late. I have no doubt, Sir, that Major Mitchell, however unwarranted, has
presumed on his being known to you, to assume a tone of independence and
adopt a course of proceeding, which he would not have attempted under
other circumstances.</blockquote>

<p>There is a tragic irony about these events.</p>

<p>Mitchell had thrown out a definite challenge to the local executive
government and to the Governor in those letters of December, January, and
February addressed to Murray, hoping no doubt to have from his friend and
patron the same support for his independence as he had had in the past.
He could not know that Murray had ceased to be Secretary of State, having
retired from that office on 22 November. This fact, however, was not
known in Sydney until 5 April 1831.</p>

<p>As for Darling, the Executive Council had finally completely supported
Darling's authority on 15 March 1831: but on that very day Goderich
signed the letter to Darling dismissing him from the post of Governor,
and recalling him to London. Goderich expressed His Majesty's approbation
of and satisfaction with Darling's administration: but there must have
been another letter which is not now available, for Darling wrote a
remonstrance: "Your Lordship has disgraced me in the very face of the
people whom I have now governed for nearly six years."</p>

<p>Darling had written to Hay a personal letter (28 March 1831) regarding
Mitchell:</p>

<blockquote>You will judge of my disposition towards him by my private
letter to you of 6 June 1829. At that time I looked upon him as a
hard-working, rude, ill-tempered fellow who quarrelled with everyone, and
who, I may add, is still as much detested as ever by those who have any
business to transact with him.<br>
<br>
Anxious to get the business of the Government done, I was willing to make
every sacrifice, and he was allowed to snarl and growl unheeded, until at
last his insolence became intolerable.[50]</blockquote>

<p>Writing to Goderich, who had become Secretary of State, (27 April
1831) Darling said:</p>

<blockquote>I earnestly submit to Your Lordship that Major Mitchell's
removal from the Civil Service is indispensable to the proper conduct of
this Government as the means of preventing others who, like him, might be
disposed to follow an ill example when they could hope to do so with
impunity.[51]</blockquote>

<p>The matter of Mitchell's insubordination, owing to the long delays in
transmission of mails in those days, was only concluded after Darling had
left. Goderich wrote to Bourke (10 October 1832), stating that he had
received Darling's despatches with the full story of Mitchell's
behaviour, and said:</p>

<blockquote>I cannot but regret the tone which Major Mitchell adopted in
his correspondence with the local authorities, which forms a considerable
part of the voluminous/ papers sent home by General Darling in his
despatch of 28 March 1831.<br>
<br>
But in the hope that I may not have again to advert to the transactions
out of which this correspondence arose, I shall abstain from any
further notice of the subject than to desire that you will inform Major
Mitchell that, whilst I am disposed to acknowledge the zeal with which he
has discharged the duties of his department, I cannot approve of the line
of conduct which he has pursued towards the local Government under the
administration of your Predecessor, whose views, however different from
those entertained by Major Mitchell himself, or contrary to what he
conceived to be the spirit of the King's instructions, it was,
nevertheless, his duty to carry into effect.[52]</blockquote>

<p>Darling's general estimate of Mitchell may be quoted:</p>

<blockquote>Major Mitchell's plans are as extravagant as they are
numerous.<br>
<br>
His object appears to be his own fame, that everything should originate
with him or be improved by him. Major Mitchell's representations
generally are the result of disappointed vanity, and of a captious
jealous disposition.<br>
<br>
He is a good practical surveyor and an excellent draughtsman: beyond this
he possesses no merit. He is a man of no arrangement and is totally
unequal to the management and proper conduct of an extensive
department.[53]</blockquote>

<p>One other aspect of this period has to be noted. Darling, when
reviewing Mitchell's conduct in his letter of 28 March 1831, stated that
he was aware that Mitchell had been very much displeased at not being
employed in exploring the interior instead of Sturt, and he had reason to
believe that Major Mitchell's complaints in this respect had not been
confined to the local Government. But, Darling asked,</p>

<blockquote>how could Major Mitchell, after his reiterated
representations of the backwardness of the survey, and his urgent
applications for additional means to bring up the arrear, with any degree
of consistency or even of common regard to the interests of the Colony,
have been employed as Captain Sturt was, on one occasion for five months,
and another for six.[54]</blockquote>

<p>Goderich had, however, written to Bourke (29 September 1831)
instructing him that in future exploring expeditions should be carried
out by the Surveyor General himself, or by his officers under his
direction: as, in this way, considerable expense would be saved.[55]</p>

<p>Although this decision had resulted from an enquiry by the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury into the revenue and expenditure of the
colonies, and was, therefore, mainly economical in purpose, the letters
already quoted show that Darling was justified in his belief that
Mitchell had been making representations direct to Murray.</p>

<p>Mitchell's final word was contained in another private letter to Hay
(16 November 1831):</p>

<blockquote>Some weeks have now elapsed since Governor Darling left this
Colony...the change is to me a most refreshing relief from oppression:
for down to the last hour of his Government he cared not to blend
personal malignity with the exercise of his authority, at least as far as
concerned me. Acting Governor Lindesay has indulged me with permission to
explore our northern interior...If you hear from me again it must be
after I have solved with God's assistance the great problem of the
interior.[56]</blockquote>

<p>In the course of the correspondence which had been reviewed in this
chapter Mitchell on several occasions expressed an unfavourable opinion
of the abilities of his deputy, Perry.</p>

<p>Mitchell, therefore, was at this stage triumphant. He had gathered
into his own hands the sole responsibility for the survey of the whole
territory, the valuation and disposal of Crown lands, the construction
and maintenance of roads and bridges, and the exploration of the
interior. The remainder of this volume is the story of the extent to
which he discharged, and reconciled, those great responsibilities. Here
is Mitchell's own review of his attitude during this period. It is an
extract from a private letter to</p>

<p>Hay dated 28 March 1832.</p>

<blockquote>I have had the pleasure to receive two letters from you dated
26 August and 28 September last, and I have to return you my most sincere
thanks for the attention you have given to my numerous complaints
respecting the late Governor. I trust that matters will go on so
differently under General Bourke as to show in the sequel whether I had
reason to complain, however much I did regret the necessity for
complaining at all. I have already seen enough of General Bourke to be
satisfied that no such grievances will again require a similar reference
home, and I am determined, happen what may, not to trouble His Majesty's
Government respecting a second Governor, for Sir George Murray, whose
kind patronage I have enjoyed for upwards of twenty years, knows that I
am not prone to disobedience or disrespect towards my
superiors.[57]</blockquote>

<p>There was, apparently, a still further advance in his status in 1833,
for he wrote to Hay (24 March 1833):</p>

<blockquote>At length the last of the subordinate departments of Governor
Darling has been added to mine--that of the Colonial Architect. I feel no
inconvenience from these additions of duty except that of reducing the
officers to habits of obedience after having been heads of
departments.<br>
<br>
The new Governor has given me no grounds for complaint, but I should not
consider myself secure from General Darling's malignity even now did I
not rely on your friendship and protection. I might have been at issue
with General Bourke about the roads but my zeal is not likely now to
carry me so far as it did once.[58]</blockquote>

<p>During the interregnum between Darling's departure (22 October 1831)
and Bourke's arrival (31 December 1831), Colonel Patrick Lindesay acted
as Governor. Mitchell, apparently without much trouble, persuaded
Lindesay to sanction a journey of exploration to the north--the first of
Mitchell's four journeys of exploration.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>This period of four years between Mitchell's arrival in New South
Wales and Darling's recall was a critical period for him, and the
conditions then existing may have influenced his later attitudes. He
transferred abruptly from a military career, in which he had had a
creditable record, and from the support of influential patrons, to a
civil career in which he had, from his official superiors, no such
support. He came to a colony in which he could see all round him
evidences of the great material success of individuals who had defied
authority: and to a colony in which he would meet exclusives,
emancipists, and immigrants who, each for his own purpose, was actively
engaged in undermining the constituted authority of the Governor.</p>

<p>He had left England with a clear understanding and agreement that a
direct and confidential line of communication with Under-Secretary Hay
was open to him: and it would be rather too much to believe that he was
not aware, through either Murray or Hay, of the growing dissatisfaction
in the Colonial Office with Darling's administration.</p>

<p>He recognized the irregularity of his conduct: writing to Hay (14
February 1831) on the subject of the dispute between himself and the
Governor concerning the control of roads and bridges (which has been
already recorded in this chapter) he said:</p>

<blockquote>I begin to be apprehensive that my letters have been too
frequent: I have lately had occasion to address several to you: but you
will perceive by the documents enclosed in these, and more especially in
this, that I have thought it necessary to address Sir George Murray
officially, and, as the Governor seems in no hurry to send home the
originals, I consider that having so far conformed to the rules by
sending my original letters through his hands, I am entitled to forward
copies direct to the Secretary of State, being informed by the Colonial
Secretary that His Excellency has not yet forwarded my letter of 15
December last. The urgency of the subject is my excuse for being so
frequent in my communications to you. The present letter and
documents...(throw)...some light on the affairs of land generally in this
colony--and also shew pretty clearly what General Darling's conduct to me
has been.[59]</blockquote>

<p>That such a proceeding was not, at that time, considered improper, as
it would be today, is illustrated by certain extracts from contemporary
correspondence. Mitchell in a private letter to Hay (7 September 1829)
said:</p>

<blockquote>I received on 17 July your letter of 7 December when on
survey in the northern part of the colony. I am anxious to comply with
your request by tendering a circumstantial account of my progress and the
present condition of my department.[60]</blockquote>

<p>As also this in a letter from Hay to Mitchell (9 January 1832):</p>

<blockquote>I quite agree with you as to the necessity of concentrating
as much as possible the settlers who may arrive, which can only be done
by confining the new colonists to certain tracts of
country.[61]</blockquote>

<p>Evidently there had been, over several years, direct and unofficial
correspondence--in which the official head of the Colonial Office was a
partner. On the professional side of his administration Mitchell had
found the Survey Department in a state of disorder and had proceeded with
great vigour, after Oxley's death, to establish system and to proceed
with the urgent task of making accurate surveys. It is necessary in view
of the condemnation which will be recorded at the end of this story to
quote Mitchell's own concept of the proper method under the existing
circumstances. Writing to Hay (17 March 1829) he said:</p>

<blockquote>The object of settlers is to find, on some river or chain of
ponds, land of which the back boundary from abutting on rocky ravines
will never be selected by others, and which will thus afford a back-run
of some sort for their cattle, which in winter affect such places. Under
these circumstances the survey of streams and watercourses becomes the
object most immediately important, since none select land where there is
no water, and because, without a survey of the watercourse, the situation
of the land selected on its bank cannot be ascertained. The dividing
ridge analogous in all its windings to streams on each side is next in
importance and I consider that a survey comprising these features
together would include nearly all that can be required for practical
purposes, that is for location of settlers, division according to natural
boundaries into counties, hundreds, and parishes, and construction of
roads, canals, etc.,...the surveyors are chiefly employed now on such
natural lines of this kind as the country affords.[62]</blockquote>

<p>That was the system which came to be known as "feature surveys": it
was to be long continued. The boundaries of the grants made to both
Mitchell and Sturt are excellent examples of this</p>

<p>system of using watercourses as boundaries.</p>

<p>At this period then Mitchell had begun his professional career</p>

<p>in New South Wales with vigorous intention to secure efficiency in its
major aspect--surveying; in this work he did not spare himself; but,
despite his own denial to Murray of competence in that field, he had
grasped responsibility for civil engineering, which, later, he was to
confess to Bourke had not been a satisfactory arrangement.[63]</p>

<p>He had committed himself to disloyal intrigue against Governor
Darling--if, indeed, it can be called intrigue when Hay was accomplice,
and when Murray was evidently complaisant.</p>

<p>That Murray, Mitchell's patron and protector, should, within one year
after Mitchell's appointment as Surveyor General, have dismissed two of
the Survey Commissioners without consulting Darling, placing absolute
authority over survey and valuation of lands in Mitchell's hands as sole
Commissioner; and should also have cancelled Darling's appointments in
respect of roads and bridges, placing this important function under
Mitchell's control, must be condemned as improper use of ministerial
authority. Mitchell, however, had taken conditions as he found them: he
had followed the example of many of the old colonists, and had seized
opportunities--opportunities which had stimulated ambition.</p>

<p>Two men of strong character and incompatible temperament were in
continual conflict. Watson's verdict that Darling was little suited for
the government of the colony will be recalled: but while reading through
all the documents of this period some feeling of sympathy for Darling is
an instinctive reaction.</p>

<p>Mitchell's relations with succeeding Governors will give some evidence
as to whether he was to any important degree open to censure for his part
in the conflict.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI - The First expedition</h2>

<p>Although the instructions that exploring expeditions were to be
carried out by Mitchell could not have reached Sydney before about
February 1832, other developments had given Mitchell an opportunity of
which he quickly took advantage: writing to a friend, Mr G. Rankin, in
Bathurst, seven days after Darling's departure, he said: "It is indeed
true, thank God, that Darling is off, and Colonel Lindesay is all I could
wish."[1]</p>

<p>Darling had left Sydney on 22 October 1831, and within _one month
Mitchell had influenced Acting Governor Lindesay to send him out on an
exploring expedition.</p>

<p>Lindesay wrote to Secretary of State Goderich (23 November 1831) that
he had authorized Mitchell to proceed to that part of New South Wales
"hitherto unexplored" between the Castlereagh and the Gwydir, to
ascertain the truth of certain reports, which had gained considerable
credit, of the existence of a large interior river flowing towards the
north-west.</p>

<p>Lindesay referred to the discoveries of Oxley and Cunningham and said
that these indicated a vast area of depressed interior subject at certain
seasons to total inundation, with the</p>

<blockquote>additional opinion of the existence of a noble interior river
conveying the accumulation of inland waters across the continent to
discharge on the north-west coast of Australia about 20&deg; or 21&deg;
South latitude.[2]</blockquote>

<p>This was a direct echo of speculations by Captain P. P. King during
his survey of the north-west coast of Australia.[3] Lindesay agreed that
Sturt's discovery of the Darling and the Murray threw grave doubt on
these theories, but they had been recently revived by the story of a
recaptured runaway convict, Clarke,* who had declared that there was a
noble river (Kindur)</p>

<p>rising in the Liverpool ranges of New South Wales which, after an
unbroken course to the north-west, emptied into the sea. Lindesay
informed Goderich that Clarke's story supported Oxley and Cunningham, and
was so confidently told by him that it should be examined; and he
forwarded to Goderich a report by Mitchell on this matter. In this report
Mitchell, citing the examples of the Amazon and the Ganges, argued that,
from the long semi-lunar arc of the main eastern ranges, waters must flow
concentrically</p>

<blockquote>towards the interior where a concentration of the waters
might be looked for about the latitude of 28&deg; S., where, at an
average distance of, say, three hundred miles from the coast the head of
a large river may be found,</blockquote>

<p>and he added,</p>

<blockquote>supposing the course of the desired river to be analogous to
that of the Amazon we must believe its estuary to be amongst those
unexplored inlets of the sea which Captain King saw on the north-western
coast of Australia.[5]</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* Clarke had for a. long time escaped the
vigilance of the police by disguising himself as an aborigine: "he had
accustomed himself to the wretched life of that unfortunate race of men:
he was deeply scarified like them, and naked and painted black he went
about with a tribe, being usually attended by two aboriginal females, and
had acquired some knowledge of their language and
customs."[4]</blockquote>

<p>This is very specious: three hundred miles from the coast on 28&deg;
S. is at St. George in Queensland. Mitchell argued in that memorandum
that the streams from the range must flow southwest, and with Sturt's
evidence that the streams forming the Darling came from the north-east,
Mitchell, with a fairly accurate knowledge of the height above sea level
of the plains in this region, was straining against the evidence in
discarding the probability of the Darling being the main channel, in
favour of the noble stream with a low-level starting point flowing to the
northwest and finding its way across the whole breadth of the continent,
considerably more than two thousand miles in an air-line. But Mitchell
was eager to get away on an exploring expedition. It is noteworthy that,
although Sturt was in Sydney at the time, there is no evidence that he
was consulted. Mitchell was perhaps too eager; in his own words:</p>

<blockquote>There are few undertakings more attractive to the votaries of
fame or lovers of adventure, than the exploration of unknown regions; but
Sir Patrick Lindesay, with due regard to the responsibility which my
office seemed to impose upon me, as successor to Mr Oxley, at once
accepted my proffered services to conduct a party into the
interior.[6]</blockquote>

<p>THE OUTWARD JOURNEY TO THE BARWON - (24 November 1831 to 24 January
1832)</p>

<p>Mitchell speedily put in hand the preparations for the journey, the
duties of his office preventing him from giving much personal attention
to these preparations. He collected "in haste" a few articles of personal
equipment and left Sydney on 24 November 1831, having satisfied himself
that his officers had provided for every contingency. The party
consisted, beside Mitchell himself, of Surveyor H. Finch, Assistant
Surveyor G. B. White, and fifteen men selected for both reliability and
diversity of skill. Of these men nine went with him on the second
expedition, six on both the second and third expeditions, but only one,
his faithful personal servant--Anthony Brown--was with him on all four
expeditions. They carried eight muskets and two pistols: there were two
light carts and three drays, also several pack-horses. They had canvas
for making canvas boats if they should need to cross any rivers.</p>

<p>Mitchell has recorded his emotions when starting on this
expedition:</p>

<blockquote>I felt the ardour of my early youth, when I first sought
distinction in the crowded camp and battle-field, revive as I gave loose
to my reflections and considered the nature of the enterprise. But, in
comparing the feelings I then experienced with those which excited my
youthful ambition, it seemed that even war and victory, with all their
glory, were far less alluring than the pursuit of researches such as
these: the objects of which were to spread the light of civilization over
a portion of the globe yet unknown, though rich, perhaps, in the
luxuriance of uncultivated nature, and where science might accomplish new
and unthought-of discoveries; while intelligent man would find a region
teeming with useful vegetation, abounding with rivers, hills, and
vallies, and waiting only for his enterprising spirit, and improving hand
to turn to account the native bounty of the soil.*</blockquote>

<p>For the first three hundred miles he passed through country already
taken up by settlers or squatters. His route from Sydney was by the old
road through Glenorie to Wiseman's Ferry, then north through St. Alban's
to Wollombi. This road had been first discovered and surveyed by Surveyor
Finch. At Wollombi Surveyor Finch joined the party: and here Mitchell
spent the night on Blaxland's station at Broke, "named by me in honour of
that meritorious officer, Sir Charles Broke Vere, Bart". Vere had been
associated with Mitchell in the Peninsular War. Finch was left at
Wollombi to arrange for supplementary supplies and to follow in the
tracks of the party. (Their route is shown on Map III, below.)</p>

part of his expedition to the Barwon River</b></p>

<p>They crossed the Hunter River at about Singleton and followed
generally the course of the present road to Muswellbrook, where they
again met the Hunter River. Here Mitchell received from Surveyor Dixon an
account of the Liverpool Plains which the party was about to cross. Then
from Muswellbrook, again following the course of the present road through
Scone and Wingen (visiting Mt. Wingen), they came to Page's River
approximately at Blandford. From here the course is doubtful: it appears
from Mitchell's map as though they crossed the Quirindi and Currabubula
Creeks and, bending slightly to the east at the latter point, turned
north again (possibly along Goonoo Goonoo Creek), reaching the Peel at
Tamworth on 11 December, about two miles east of the point at which Oxley
had crossed it.</p>

<p>From Tamworth they were now about to proceed into completely unknown
country: they secured here a native guide, who left them at Maule's
Creek. Finch joined them at this point without the expected supply of
flour, and was sent back to the Hunter River to obtain it: he was to
follow their tracks northward. So far they were within known districts,
where rough surveys had already been made by Assistant Surveyor R. Dixon,
and in which they had passed from one squatter's "station" to
anotherBlaxland's, Macqueen's, Palmer's, Loder's, and Brown's.[7] On this
section nothing of importance happened, although they did meet bush-fires
between Murrurundi and Tamworth.</p>

<p>From Tamworth they followed generally the present road to Gunnedah,
but crossed the Namoi below its junction with the Peel River at a point
about due north of Carroll. They had camped (14 December) at the foot of
Mt. Pyrambung (Perimbungay), noting here the junction of the Peel with
the Namoi (Muluerindie). (This part of the journey is shown on <a href=
"#m4">Map IV</a>.)</p>

<p>Reaching Gunnedah on 15 December, Mitchell learned that the river he
was on was the Namoi. From here he -sighted the peak above Boggabri
(Tangulda) and proceeded to move to that point, reaching the vicinity of
Boggabri on 17 December. On the way they passed the stockyard which had
been built and used by the bushranger Clarke: this stockyard was situated
beside a large and deep lagoon. Clarke had told Mitchell that his "big
river" lay north-east of Boggabri, so he diverged at this point to the
headwaters of Maule's Creek. Having found, after pushing twenty-one miles
into the ranges, that further progress was impossible, he returned to the
base camp which he had made eighteen miles north-east of Boggabri, and
then moved the whole party back to the Namoi, about six miles north of
Boggabri. Here he decided to build his canvas boats and attempt a
downstream passage by water; and from this camp he sent off one of the
convicts--Bombelli--with despatches for Sydney. Bombelli Was armed with a
pistol and had instructions to return to this base camp.</p>

<p>Two boats were built:</p>

<blockquote>We launched the second boat, and having loaded both, I left
two men' in charge of the carts, bullocks and horses, and embarked, at
last, on the waters of the Nammoy, on a voyage of discovery.</blockquote>

<p>This voyage of discovery did not last long, one of the canvas boats
was seriously holed by snags, hauled ashore and mended, holed again
shortly afterwards, and, having travelled only two land miles from the
base camp,</p>

<blockquote>the labours of the day had been sufficient to convince me
that the course of the Nammoy could be much more, conveniently traced at
that time by a journey on land than with canvas boats on the
water.</blockquote>

<p><b>MAP IV. Map showing the second part of Mitchell's journey to the
Barwon and his return to Tamworth</b></p>
</center>

<p>Mitchell decided to proceed by land, although he had instructed
Bombelli to return to this camp. Following the Namoi to near Narrabri,
Mitchell, noting that river bearing away to the westward, decided to
continue in a northerly direction in an attempt to locate a river which
might reasonably be accepted as Clarke's "big river". From 2 to 9 January
the party had a troublesome journey over the plains between the Namoi and
the Gwydir following closely, but perhaps somewhat east of, the present
railway between Narrabri and Moree. On reaching the Gwydir Mitchell
recognized it as Cunningham's Gwydir, and not Clarke's Kindur: he had
reached it in the vicinity of Moree or Mungie Bundie. Mitchell decided
that his proper course was to trace this river to its junction with some
other river in order to establish its geographical identity. During this
section of the northward journey, owing to the prolonged dry weather, the
timber in the carts and drays had shrunk, and it was necessary to stop on
7 January to repair them. The water-hole at which this was done was named
"Wheel Ponds" by Mitchell: it was about fifteen to seventeen miles south
of the Gwydir--probably on the Courallie Creek, east of Gurley.</p>

<p>At this stage of the journey Mitchell had difficulty in finding water
each day and began to be anxious how Finch would fare in this respect.
From the Gwydir camp, having decided to trace_ the Gwydir, he turned
westward, and buried a letter for Finch at the foot of a marked tree
explaining this change of direction. He followed the Gwydir westward past
Moree, and then southward, following the bend of the river. His
description of this part of the journey is difficult to follow, but it
would seem--comparing his map with the text--that he followed the Moomin
Creek to a point approximately north-east of Bunna Bunna, then turned on
a course a little west of north, crossing the Wolongimba and Mallowa
Creeks, and reaching the Gwydir proper--perhaps between Burrendoon and
Ballarah. Here, on the Gwydir, he left a Base camp under White's care,
and himself, with a small party, pushed on, following a course a little
west of north, and reached the Barwon at a point probably a little south
of Mungindi, having crossed the Big Leather watercourse and the Boomi
River.</p>

<p>This section of the journey, Tamworth to Mungindi, was not without
incident. When Mitchell had left White on the Gwydir, he had in his own
small scouting party Souter, known to his comrades as "the doctor". Of
him Mitchell records: "I never saw Souter's diploma, but his experience
and skill in surgery were sufficient to satisfy us." At this first
night's camp Souter, as soon as they halted, set out in search of water,
with the tea-kettle in his hand, but did not return.</p>

<blockquote>The non-appearance of Souter occasioned me much uneasiness;
fortunately the trees were marked along our route: and it was probable
that he would either follow us or return to the camp on the river. The
latter alternative, however, was likely to occasion some inconvenience to
us, as he was a useful hand, and I did not despair, even then, of finding
some use for the tea-kettle.</blockquote>

<p>The last cryptic remark is not explained by any previous comment on
the tea-kettle.</p>

<p>Mitchell did not wait to search for him, but went on, entering in his
diary next day that Souter's non-appearance occasioned him much
uneasiness. However, Souter had returned to the depot camp on. the Gwydir
with the interesting story that he had lost his way and met with some
natives who detained him one day, but he had escaped on the second
night.</p>

<p>THE RETURN JOURNEY - (24 January to March 1832)</p>

<p>From the camp near Mungindi Mitchell sent some men back to White on
the Gwydir with instructions to him to join the party on the Barwon. It
will be remembered that Finch had been sent back from Tamworth to bring
up supplementary stores, and Mitchell included in his instructions to
White a letter for Finch to be "concealed in a tree with certain marks. I
hoped however that by that time Mr Finch might have overtaken Mr White's
party". White and his party arrived on the Barwon on 28 January with
Souter, but without Finch, and Mitchell became anxious, as Finch was
bringing supplies of flour, and provisions were running low; they caught
fish, but flour was the article of which they were most in need.</p>

<p>Mitchell, rejecting his canvas boats, felled trees, made a saw-pit,
and began to build a flat-bottomed boat strong enough to resist the
snags. This boat was built in three pieces so that it could be dismantled
and carried on the carts.</p>

<blockquote>Thus we were to proceed with a portable punt, ready for the
passage of any river or water, which might be in our way.</blockquote>

<p>When the boat was finished, White was sent downstream to examine the
river: he returned reporting it filled with fallen timber, and obstructed
by rocks over which the heavy boat could not be carried without
considerable delay. This fact might well have been discovered before the
boat was built.</p>

<p>Mitchell, being disappointed with this news, made a land journey down
the Barwon to the junction of the Gwydir, and thus connected up his
points; and, from the general trend of the Barwon, the known position of
the Castlereagh-Darling junction as established by Sturt, and the
presumed ending of the Namoi, he decided that the stream they were on
(known to the natives as "Karaula") was the Darling.</p>

<blockquote>Thus terminated our excursion, to explore this last
discovered stream; for there was no necessity for extending it further,
as I could not suppose that it was any other than the
Darling.</blockquote>

<p>He returned to the camp--the boat was already in the water and
everything was packed up to cross the river for the purpose of exploring
the country north of the Barwon.</p>

<p>Then, on 6 February, to the camp on the Barwon near Mungindi, came
Finch, with only one man, without any supplies or equipment, and with a
tale of tragedy. He, with three men, had been following with
supplementary supplies, as instructed. He had had, as Mitchell had
anticipated, great trouble in crossing the dry stretch between the Namoi
and the Gwydir north of Narrabri and had lost his own horse and several
other animals. He had had to relay the stores by pack animals as far as
Wheel Ponds on the Courallie Creek (Gorolei) but could get them no
further, Then, with one man, leaving two men to care for the stores, he
had scouted along Mitchell's track to the Gwydir and westward to about
Moree: failing to overtake Mitchell he had returned to the camp at Wheel
Ponds.</p>

<blockquote>He found neither his tents nor his men to, receive him, but a
heap of various articles such as bags, trunks, harness, tea and sugar
canisters, etc., piled over the dead bodies of his men, whose legs he, at
length, perceived projecting;, most of the flour had been carried off.
The two bullocks continued feeding near. This spectacle must have
appeared most appalling to Mr Finch, uncertain, as he must have been,
whether the eyes of the natives were not then upon him, while neither he
nor his man possessed any means of defence! Taking a piece of pork and
some flour in a haversack, he hastened from the dismal scene; and by
travelling all day, and passing the nights without fire, he most
providentially escaped the natives, and had at length reached our
camp.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell subsequently stated that this massacre was the result of
intercourse or interference with native women, but this must have been
mere speculation as no witness of the tragedy survived.</p>

<p>Faced now with the absence of the expected supplies, and with the
evidence, provided by this tragedy, of the hostility of the natives he
decided that he must at once return.</p>

<blockquote>We had at least accomplished the main object of the
Expedition, by ascertaining that there was no truth in the bushranger's
report respecting the great river.</blockquote>

<p>The carts were put in order; "our boat (emblem of our hopes!) was sunk
in the deepest part of the Karaula".</p>

<p>They made, in one day, a forced march back to their old camp on the
Gwydir. Here they had a little difficulty in crossing the river, and the
near possibility--unrealized--of trouble with the natives, who visited
the camp in large numbers. Continuing along the line of their outward
route to about the Moomin Creek they turned south-eastwards across the
base of the northward curve of their route to the Gwydir at Moree. At a
point about seventeen miles west of Gurley Mitchell with an armed party
visited the scene of the massacre at Wheel Ponds on Courallie Creek,
where they buried the bodies of Bombelli, who had been sent south from
Boggabri with despatches, and an unnamed bullock-driver. The party
rejoined their former northerly track about the vicinity of Edgeroi, and
continuing southwards reached the Namoi at Narrabri on 23 February,
Clarke's stockyard near Boggabri on 26 February, and Gunnedah next day.
At this point the men now began to suffer from scurvy, which was treated
with lime juice. Thereafter they followed the established route to Sydney
and from near Tamworth, Mitchell, accompanied only by his personal
servant, Anthony Brown, left the main party in charge of Mr White and
rode on to Sydney to report the results of his expedition.. When Mitchell
returned to Sydney he interviewed the bushranger Clarke and was able to
satisfy himself that Clarke had never been beyond the ranges north of
Boggabri.</p>

<p>So ended this rather futile but definitely tragic expedition: in
results it was unprofitable, as Mitchell himself recorded in his book
published in 1838:</p>

<blockquote>The journey of discovery proved that any large river flowing
to the north-west must be far to the northward of latitude
29&deg;.</blockquote>

<p>He had not really tested his own hypothesis of a "concentration of
waters about the latitude of 28&deg; S.", although he had been on
latitude 29&deg;, at his turning point on the Barwon. If he had taken
sufficient supplies from the start he would not have been obliged to send
Finch back, the tragedy would not have occurred, and he could have gone
further north. It was unfortunate that "the other duties of my office,
prevented me from devoting much attention personally, to the preparations
for such a journey".</p>

<p><a name="ee"></a>There is an interesting and significant sidelight on
Mitchell's attitude after this expedition. He wrote a private letter to
Hay of the Colonial Office (28 March 1832), giving an account of his
journey. In this letter he stated that he was convinced that there was
little probability that the waters from the basin north of his furthest
point on the Darling would flow "to any estuary further westward than the
Gulf of Carpentaria". That he could, in his published book six years
later, speak of a large river flowing to the north-west is difficult to
understand. In his letter he added:</p>

<blockquote>Still, a river flowing into the Gulf of Carpentaria would be,
if of any magnitude, a valuable feature in the geography of New Holland,
and would much improve the mercantile prospects of New South Wales as
explained in my former letter.</blockquote>

<p>It will appear as this story proceeds that this vision was to persist
and inspire his fourth expedition.</p>

<p>In the letter to Hay he severely criticized Oxley's observations of
1818, but continued:</p>

<blockquote>I went, under many disadvantages, eager to seize the first
opportunity after long restraint from this sort of duty. I made various
sacrifices which I need not detail here, was at some expense, and it was
finally my lot to return to a new Governor, and not to one who had sent
me, and who might then, as in the case of Oxley and all others who have
ventured into the interior, have given me some land or other compensation
or reward. I make no demand or claim but I shall not be without some hope
that when my report and map reach Downing Street the Government may order
me some land as in the case of Oxley.[8]</blockquote>

<p>This plea for some reward was not successful. On the contrary as will
appear in the next chapter, very soon after Hay had acknowledged this
letter, the Colonial Office adversely reviewed Mitchell's administration
as Surveyor General.</p>

<p>One year later, writing again to Hay (24 March 1833), he said:</p>

<blockquote>I still think something very important to be discovered lurks
in the north-west and that at a few hundred miles beyond the point to
which I penetrated, either a large river or a Mediterranean sea might be
fallen in with.[9]</blockquote>

<p>And he added a caustic reflection on previous explorers, saying the
observations of both Oxley and Cunningham were inaccurate: "I have
materials enough to show that geographical research cannot be entrusted
to Amateur Travellers".</p>

<p>As was invariably the experience after each expedition of discovery
the country traversed was soon occupied by squatters; and, as usual,
members of the exclusive party were quick to occupy good land.
Immediately after the return of the expedition cattle belonging to Sir
John Jamison were in the country round Boggabri.</p>

<p>Early in 1830 Mitchell had been very precise in his instructions to
the surveyors that they were always to give the native names to all land
features. He rebuked Surveyor Ogilvie:</p>

<blockquote>I beg you to understand that I will not suffer any surveyor
to give any river or place any other than proper native
name.[10]</blockquote>

<p>On this expedition he must have realized that this rule could not be
obeyed in the districts where aborigines were met infrequently, or were
hostile, for on his later journeys he used many European names, often
reminiscent of his experiences in the Peninsular War. Examples will be
quoted from time to time later.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII - The Colonial Office is Critical</h2>

<p>Mitchell, having returned from the first expedition, resumed his
duties as Surveyor General; but his absence for four months had not ended
his official troubles. Bourke, who succeeded Darling as Governor, arrived
in Sydney in December 1831, while Mitchell was away. Bourke, although a
general in the army, had been educated in law; he was a man of strong
character and equable temperament.[1] He was not under the handicap, as
Darling was, of having to govern in a time of drought and financial
crisis: and he was very fortunate in that he inherited, and profited
from, the results of the struggles of his predecessors with the difficult
problem of disposal of Crown lands.</p>

<p>The Wakefield proposals, with the famous <i>Letter from Sydney</i>,
had first appeared in 1829: these had attracted considerable attention,
and, coming at a critical period in the long discussions and extensive
correspondence during which all aspects of land policy had been
exhaustively considered, it is, perhaps, correct to say that they
crystallized a decision. In 1831 Darling had received from Secretary of
State Goderich (later Earl of Ripon) new regulations prescribing that for
the future no Crown land was to be given away as grants, or to be
disposed of otherwise than by auction: the minimum price in towns was to
be fixed by the Surveyor General, and in all other parts of the colony
was to be five shillings per acre.[2] These regulations were proclaimed
in Sydney on 1 August 1831.[3] Thus the system under which Crown lands
could be given away at the personal discretion of the Governor ceased
after forty-three years: and, with its cessation, one source of great
jealousy and discontent disappeared. Bourke's administration therefore
opened under very favourable conditions. The people hailed his arrival as
the dawn of a happier era. But, so far as Mitchell was concerned,
problems were increasing rapidly. The Australian Agricultural Company
which, since its establishment in 1824, had attempted an unprofitable
settlement in the Port Stephens region, was then under the forceful
administration of Sir Edward Parry whose scouts had rediscovered the
Liverpool Plains in November 1831.[4] This company claimed under its
charter very large areas of land on the Namoi and Peel Rivers in the
Quirindi, Tamworth, Gunnedah region.[5] There were already in this region
eleven squatters with large herds of cattle, and the question of the
"rights" of these squatters had to be faced: ultimately after much
discussion and reference to the Colonial Office the matter was, in 1833,
settled in favour of the company.[6]</p>

<p>In this discussion Mitchell played a leading part. He emphasized the
dangers of allowing settlement to proceed beyond the limits of possible
official control, the necessity for controlling settlement so that the
heads of the fertile valleys should not be alienated by even doubtful
"pre-occupational rights", and the importance of regulating settlement in
accord with natural contours. At times the discussion became vigorous.
Parry wrote to Colonial Secretary Macleay (11 March 1833):</p>

<blockquote>All this opposition arose from a predetermination on the part
of the Surveyor General to oppose any selection I might make, that
predetermination having been expressed in the strongest and most
unwarrantable terms long before I had even seen the land which I have
since selected...to the Surveyor General I am not aware that I owe any
respect much less any apology.[7]</blockquote>

<p>But events were proving too strong for Mitchell and for the
Government. Following on Hume's journey southward to Port Phillip (1824),
Oxley's and Cunningham's journeys to the north (1818-28), and Sturt's
journeys to the north-west and south-west (1828-30), many owners of
cattle and sheep had sent their flocks and herds into these new and
alluring regions far beyond the limits of settlement: so that by 1831 the
problem of the control of these "squatters", and also of their protection
against aborigines, sometimes indeed against each other, had called for
official attention--a problem not lessened at all by the fact that the
original exclusive group were well to the front in these excursions.</p>

<p>In October 1829, Darling had gazetted the boundaries of nineteen
counties, and had forbidden, under penalty of prosecution, any settlement
beyond these boundaries.[8] Sturt's discoveries had put the final seal on
the futility of this prohibition; and, although it was renewed in 1835,
it was never effective. The settlement of the Hentys at Portland, of
Batman at Port Phillip, and of Leslie on the Darling Downs had projected
the problem to the extreme outposts--over, in fact, ten degrees of
longitude and ten degrees of latitude.[9] Lang records that numerous
adventurers from Tasmania had crossed over to Port Phillip with their
flocks and herds in the year 1835, and two hundred persons, with thirty
thousand sheep and numerous cattle and horses had settled to the westward
of Melbourne and Geelong. Although this migration into Victoria had taken
place before Mitchell's third expedition (to "Australia Felix") in 1836,
that expedition produced a rapid acceleration of the process.</p>

<p>This sketch has anticipated a little the actual period at which the
sequence of events recorded in this story had reached, but, although this
rapid expansion had been most active within Bourke's period of
administration, it had begun even before Mitchell had arrived in the
colony.</p>

<p>The situation had moved Bourke to write to Glenelg (10 October
1835):</p>

<blockquote>I cannot avoid perceiving the peculiarities which, in this
Colony, render it impolitic and even impossible to restrain dispersion
within limits that would be expedient elsewhere,[10]</blockquote>

<p>and, much later, Gipps wrote to Russell (19 December 1840):</p>

<blockquote>as well might it be attempted to confine the Arabs of the
desert within a circle drawn on the sands as to confine the graziers or
wool growers of New South Wales within any bounds that can possibly be
assigned to them; and as certainly as the Arabs would be starved so also
would the flocks and herds of New South Wales, if they were so confined;
and the prosperity of the Colony would be at an end.[11]</blockquote>

<p>At one stage the Colonial Office had said that, under a good and
responsibly administered law of colonization, colonial squatting would be
as rare as the invasion of private estates in England. Bourke had
retorted that these squatters were not gypsies, but the very leaders of
colonial prosperity.</p>

<p>So that, while the ultimate disposal of Crown lands was assumed to
have been settled by the regulations of 1831, this expansion of grazing
under a "squatting" system presented new and trouble. some problems. A
form of control by the issue of licences had been introduced; this was,
in effect, little more than a form of revenue collection. Quite
obviously, close survey could not keep pace with this limitless
migration. As Surveyor General, Mitchell had a great responsibility and a
very difficult problem. He had recorded his conviction that a proper
trigonometrical survey was essential, and there is no evidence that he
had modified that attitude.</p>

<p>In complete ignorance of the conditions in the colony, Goderich had.
instructed Bourke (29 September 1831) that the strength of the Surveyor
General's Department had been augmented for a special purpose, and its
reduction would of course take place as soon as that purpose was
accomplished; he instructed Bourke to forward maps and geographical
details so that "a general map of the Colony, the want of which has
hitherto been seriously felt" could be prepared in London.[12] This map
was not forthcoming till three years later, and, as will be seen, was not
prepared in London.</p>

<p>In 1833 Goderich resigned his office as Secretary of State for the
Colonies, being succeeded by Stanley. In that year Finch, who had had so
unfortunate an experience on Mitchell's first expedition, resigned from
the Survey Department.[13] In 1832 Mr David Lennox had been appointed to
be Superintendent of Bridges: the bridges built by him (one of which is
reproduced in <a href="#p4">Plate IV</a>) stand today as a lasting
memorial to his name. Mitchell deserves credit for having enlisted the
services of this capable man.</p>

<p>The years 1833 and 1834 are principally notable, so far as the written
records go, for an official discussion of the efficiency of the Surveyor
General's Department. Stanley, upon assuming office as Secretary of State
for the Colonies (3 April 1833) directed his attention to "many important
subjects in which the interest of the Colonies are involved" and none
appeared to him of greater consequence than the survey and valuation of
the lands in the colony.</p>

<p>Accordingly he wrote to Bourke (15 June 1833), calling attention to
the instructions of 1825 (Mitchell's "Royal instructions") and said that
he regretted that he should have the disagreeable task of conveying to
the Surveyor General through Bourke "the King's surprise and
disappointment" that the progress which had been made in the survey of
the colony, at least so far as could be known from any reports received
in London, had been so disproportionate to the facilities which had been
placed at his disposal. Stanley drew attention to the increased staff of
surveyors and draftsmen; and then rather tersely pointed out that,
although the King's instructions of 1825 required that regular reports,
in specified terms, should be furnished,</p>

<blockquote>there appears to be nothing in the possession of this
department by which the labours of the Surveyor General can be estimated
beyond a skeleton map of the chief points of a trigonometrical measure,
and this without latitudes or longitudes.</blockquote>

<p>Stanley complained that this lack of information was the more
unaccountable as the Surveyor General had represented in several
communications that he had made considerable progress. The position, as
it appeared to Stanley, was that whereas the instructions of 1825
required a general survey and valuation directed particularly to the
settled areas, and a political subdivision into counties, hundreds, and
parishes, Mitchell had considered himself authorized to proceed rather to
a trigonometrical survey "of at least the whole colony". Stanley
commented that this was</p>

<blockquote>a scientific operation of great difficulty and requiring much
more time and labour than would be necessary for the execution of a
survey of the nature of that which it was the wish of His Majesty's
Government should in the first instance be undertaken, and which ought to
have been limited to purposes connected with the location of settlers
with the projecting of the requisite roads and proper lines of
communication between the different parts of the inhabited districts and
with the fixing of the boundaries of the respective grants.</blockquote>

<p>Stanley then referred to Darling's approval (13 May 1828) of the
trigonometrical survey and said that whatever might be the ultimate
advantages of the trigonometrical survey, it was evident that they were
inferior in point of urgency at least to the duties already quoted, and
that the increase in staff had been approved for those express purposes.
He concluded:</p>

<blockquote>I have to convey to you His Majesty's commands that you lose
no time in calling upon Major Mitchell to explain the causes of the
delays which have taken place in sending home the results which might be
expected from his known scientific acquirements and from the extent of
the force employed under his directions.</blockquote>

<p>He also required that Mitchell should submit a full report upon the
reorganization of his department to give effect to those urgently needed
activities.[14]</p>

<p>This critical letter was referred to Mitchell as soon as it reached
the Governor, but Bourke did not send a reply until 5 May 1834; two days
earlier he had written to Stanley that he had not received the required
report from Mitchell in reply to the despatch of 15 June 1833.[15]</p>

<p>With his letter of 5 May 1834 Bourke transmitted a map showing the
subdivision of the eastern part of the state into nineteen counties, with
a detailed description of their boundaries: and, also, he transmitted a
memorandum in which Mitchell said that it had always been his most
anxious wish to accomplish the objects of His Majesty's instructions but
he had never been able, any more than his predecessor, or any of the
Commissioners, to devise any other mode than a survey of the whole
territory by which the whole could be divided by natural limits into
parts containing given quantities.</p>

<p>He insisted that in every branch of his duty whether as Surveyor
General, or Commissioner under His Majesty's instructions for the
division and valuation of the territory, a general survey of the country
seemed equally essential. As evidence that he was fully impressed with
the importance of his duties, and animated with sufficient zeal for their
performance, he submitted a map, the result of a trigonometrical survey
made by him in the performance of which he had obtained a sufficient
knowledge of the country to enable him to carry into effect the objects
of His Majesty's instructions.</p>

<p>This was a preliminary reply by Mitchell. He deferred his full reply
until October 1834, eleven months after Stanley's despatch of 15 June
1833 had been received. Bourke transmitted to Stanley (10 October 1834)
Mitchell's "very elaborate defence", explaining that the delay was
probably due to the preparation of the map. It is not necessary for the
purposes of this story to traverse the whole of the details discussed,
but some extracts are essential.</p>

<p>Bourke agreed that Mitchell had constructed a map sufficiently correct
for ordinary purposes but on too small a scale. Under the head of roads
and bridges the Surveyor General has presented a distorted and rather
unintelligible account of this branch of his department owing, as I
imagine, to his anxiety to remove from himself and his assistants the
blame which is generally, but in many respects unjustly, imputed to them
on account of the slow progress made in the works under their charge.<br>
<br>
Having gone through the various arrangements proposed by the Surveyor
General, I think it right to offer a few remarks upon the dissatisfaction
he expresses at the control exercised by the Colonial Government over his
operations. From the tone of his letter, he seems to claim an entire
liberty of action, and to rely upon his designation of Commissioner as a
ground for the assumption.<br>
<br>
I have taken an opportunity of letting the Surveyor General understand
that, as well with respect to the King's commands contained in my
instructions, as in everything relating to his Department I consider
him amenable to my orders.<br>
<br>
With respect to his complaint of want of support from the late Governor I
regret that the Surveyor General did not see the propriety of abstaining
from any observation of the kind, and from any reference to the
correspondence transmitted by my predecessor's despatch of 29 March 1831.
In that despatch are set forth many glaring instances of misconduct
arising chiefly out of the assumed independence of action to which I have
alluded; and those have been visited by so mild a reproof from the
Secretary of State that he ought either to have omitted all mention of
those transactions, or if he had been obliged to refer to them should
have expressed him self with humility and gratitude in consideration of
the treatment he experienced.[16]</p>

<p>This matter was brought to a close by a despatch from Glenelg, who had
succeeded Stanley as Secretary of State. Glenelg accepted as satisfactory
Mitchell's explanations as to the apparent disproportion between the work
performed by his department and</p>

<p>the means supplied for its execution; but,</p>

<blockquote>while I acknowledge the zeal and ability which Major Mitchell
has displayed in the discharge of his duties, I cannot but regret that he
should still show that he entertains so erroneous an idea of the true
position in which he stands with regard to the Governor, a circumstance
which cannot but have the effect of injuring his utility as a public
officer.<br>
<br>
You will communicate this opinion to Major Mitchell and convey to him, at
the same time, the expression of my hope that I shall not again have
occasion to refer to this subject.[17]</blockquote>

<p><a name="aa"></a>As Bourke stated, Mitchell had delayed forwarding the
defence of the work of his department while he pressed on with the
preparation of the map of the colony. Mitchell had had it engraved in
Sydney, and Bourke now advised Stanley (5 May 1834) that Mitchell had
spent some of his own money, and was desirous of publishing it privately
to reimburse himself for this expense, and also he wished to</p>

<blockquote>obtain whatever reputation as a geographer and an artist that
the production of such a work, certainly of no ordinary merit, may obtain
for him.[18]</blockquote>

<p>He added that Mitchell proposed to strike off two hundred copies and
forward them to London for sale. Bourke stated that Mitchell claimed he
had been led by Under-Secretary Hay to expect from the Government the
privilege of publishing this map for his private profit. There are some
interesting references to this map in his voluminous "private" letters to
Hay. Writing on 4 October 1833, he said:</p>

<blockquote>My map is nearly all on copper having been myself obliged to
etch the hills and ranges as few engravers, even in London, can do this
satisfactorily.[19]</blockquote>

<p>And again on 17 May 1834:</p>

<blockquote>My map has now gone forward...by my hand alone has the
original map been drawn and finally etched on copper.[20]</blockquote>

<p>But, two months later (20 July 1834), there is a contradictory
note:</p>

<blockquote>I have employed an engraver for several years until I have
taught him, tho' deaf and dumb, to engrave hills...the trouble I have had
with this engraver to produce a map which I could own.[21]</blockquote>

<p>Wellington (who was acting temporarily as Secretary of State) replied
(5 December 1834) that it would have been more regular if Mitchell had
waited until he had received an answer to his application for approval to
publish before he took any steps for engraving it: but under all the
circumstances patronage would not be refused.[22] Hay, however, wrote
later to Bourke that he had no recollection of ever having made any such
promise as Mitchell claimed. Mitchell's action in having this work on the
map done by himself and in Sydney, was definitely contrary to Goderich's
instructions of 1831 to have geographical details forwarded so that the
map could be prepared in London. He hoped that he would make some
personal profit.</p>

<p>During this period Mitchell had been steadily establishing himself in
the social life of Sydney. He was President of the School of Arts
Council, Chairman at St. Andrew's Day dinner, and, as a contrast, was
fined for non-attendance as a juror at the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>His brother Houston had, with Mitchell's help, overcome initial
difficulties and "is already independent as a farmer" at Boyne Farm,
Maitland.[23] Mitchell wrote to his mother and his brother John asking
that letters of introduction to him should not be given so freely: "none
of you are aware what inconvenient ties you are imposing on one in my
situation."[24]</p>

<p>His family had grown, and by 1834 there were eight children--five boys
and three girls. It is also reported that about this period he was
waylaid one night by footpads on his way home from a dinner at the
Barracks: he was relieved of his boots, cash, and watch.[25]</p>

<h2><a name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII - The Second expedition</h2>

<p>Darling had written to Goderich on 4 June 1831, proposing to appoint
Sturt as Resident at New Zealand;[1]. but this was not approved. Goderich
suggested instead that Sturt should be employed in exploring the course
of the Darling, as, although Sturt believed it entered the Murray, this
had not been absolutely decided.[2] He said that the settlement of this
important point appeared to be worthy of the enterprise and zeal which
had been manifested by Captain Sturt, and would also throw much light on
the interior geography of a large portion of the country as yet
unexplored. He stated that it had always been his fixed opinion that, not
only on account of the temperature of the climate being more congenial to
the European constitution, but also to preserve as far as possible the
compactness of the settled country, the first efforts of the local
Government ought to be directed to the extension of the settlements to
the southward; but, at the same time, it could not be unimportant that
the nature of the country in the immediate neighbourhood of all the
settled districts should as far as possible be ascertained. Goderich then
offered two alternative courses--either to start from the point where
Sturt had left the Darling and follow that river down, or to proceed
upstream from the junction with the Murray of that stream, which Sturt
had presumed to be the Darling. He preferred the latter course, in which
case, if the stream proved to be the Darling, he was to follow it up to
Sturt's last point: but if it should prove to be a different stream he
was to follow that stream up to the same degree of latitude; and, in
either case, proceed thence north-westerly for three or four degrees of
latitude. These directions, if followed, would have placed the explorer
right up in the Cooper's Creek region on the South Australian border of
Queensland. As will be seen they were not observed. But, by the time this
despatch reached Sydney, Sturt had left for England. In fact this task of
exploring the country to the north-west of the Darling was not attempted
until it was carried out by Sturt himself thirteen years later.</p>

<p>Bourke, having received Goderich's instructions just quoted, and
having also his despatch of 29 September 1831 in which he laid it down
that expeditions of exploration should be conducted by the Surveyor
General's Department, instructed Mitchell to proceed on the proposed
expedition.[3]</p>

<p>Mitchell commented on this arrangement in a private letter to Hay (4
October 1833); he said that although the official instructions from
London had left the direction of the route to Bourke's discretion and
could have allowed Mitchell to "complete what I commenced" he had little
hope of being allowed to extend his line to the north-west except at his
own expense; even so he was willing to do this and risk more sacrifices
besides, relying on the liberality of His Majesty's Government. But
Bourke was</p>

<blockquote>by no means curious about the interior of New Holland and was
unwilling to do more than explore the course of the Darling according to
the instructions he has received.[4]</blockquote>

<p>Although Goderich's instructions had been received in Sydney towards
the end of 1832, the expedition did not take place until 1835. It was
during the years 1833 and 1834 that criticism was made by Stanley about
the progress of the survey: this was discussed in the last chapter. Here
is Mitchell's account, for the general public, in his published story of
these expeditions, written in 1838:</p>

<blockquote>In May 1833 the local authorities were informed, that His
Majesty's Government judged it expedient that an expedition should be
undertaken to explore the course of the River Darling, and that this
service should be performed by the Survey Department. Until that time, I
had understood the supposed course of the Darling to have been
sufficiently evident, but from the necessity of this survey, and
circumstances which I had not, until then, fully considered, I began to
entertain doubts on that subject. It seemed probable, from the divergent
courses of the Macquarie and Lachlan, that these rivers might belong to
separate basins, and that the dividing ridge might be the "very elevated
range", which Mr Oxley had seen, extending westward between them.<br>
<br>
It was obvious that this range, if continuous, must separate the basin of
the Darling from that of the River Murray. Preparations had been made for
the departure of the expedition in March 1834, but my duties as a
commissioner to investigate claims to grants of land, having then been
urgent, the undertaking was deferred until the next season. A report had
also been required of me by His Majesty's Government on the business of
my department generally.</blockquote>

<p>This was disingenuous enough for English readers, but must have caused
some smiles in Sydney. It is, however, interesting as indicating a
recurrence of Mitchell's original idea, expressed in 1831, of a large
river arising in the eastern ranges and discharging either on the
north-west coast of Australia or into the Gulf of Carpentaria. His views
on this question varied during the years according to occasion and
expediency.</p>

<p>The first proposal was to send the expedition by sea to Encounter Bay,
from which point they were to proceed up the rivers to Sturt's last
point:[5] this plan was, however, quickly abandoned. The party consisted,
besides Mitchell himself, of Richard Cunningham who was a botanist, a
young Assistant Surveyor, J. Larmer, and twenty-one others--nine of whom,
including his servant Anthony Brown, had been with him on the first
expedition. Two light whale-boats had been constructed, of sizes such
that one could fit inside the other, and, thus arranged, were together
slung in belts of canvas on a specially designed waggon.</p>

<p>FROM SYDNEY TO BOURKE (9 March to 26 May 1835)</p>

<p>The party left Parramatta on 9 March, proceeding slowly to Boree,*
just west of Orange, and on 31 March Mitchell left Sydney to follow them.
(The monument marking the point of departure of the second, third and
fourth expeditions is shown in <a href="#p6">Plate VI</a>.)</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* Mitchell always called it "Buree".]</blockquote>

<blockquote>My horse seemed impatient of roads and full of spirit, a
pleasant sensation at all times to the rider, and very congenial to the
high excitement of such an enterprise.*</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* This quotation, with others in this chapter
relating to incidents occurring during this expedition are, when not
otherwise indicated, from the text of Mitchell's published work <i>Three
Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia</i>.]</blockquote>

<p>In his account of the ride across the Blue Mountains Mitchell took the
opportunity of reviewing a little of the story of this region. He spoke
of a plan he had formed of cutting a tunnel through the mountains from
the Grose Valley to the Vale of Clywd--thus avoiding the mountain road:
he emphasized the importance of reserving sites for villages and of
laying down from the outset a properly surveyed village plan.</p>

<blockquote>It has been my duty to keep these objects in view, as sole
Commissioner for the division and appropriation of the territory of New
South Wales; and as head also of the department of roads and
bridges.</blockquote>

<p>This emphasis upon his responsibilities as sole Commissioner was to be
a recurrent theme. It was in 1843 made the basis of a claim for
compensation (see <a href="#cc">later</a>), and he was to refer to it
again in his book on the fourth expedition in 1848.[6]</p>

<p>He arrived at Boree, joining the main party, on 5 April. Following
down the upper reaches of Boree Creek to a point approximately where the
present roads to Parkes and Forbes diverge, north-east of Cudal, they
crossed over to Mandadgery Creek just south of Manildra. "We took with us
fifteen sheep, to try whether this kind of live stock was available on
such expeditions." He must have known that Sturt had recorded their value
on his journey down the Murrumbidgee six years previously. From the
Mandadgery Valley they crossed the ranges in the neighbourhood of
Bumberry coming down to the Goobang Creek perhaps a little north of
Goobang. On this section of the journey (which is shown on <a href=
"#m5">Map V</a>) they had some difficulty in finding water.</p>

<p>At this point Mitchell noted in his diary his reactions to camp
life:</p>

<blockquote>It is on occasions such as these that the adventurer has
intervals of enjoyment which amply reward him for the laborious days of
hardship and privation. The sense of gratification and repose is intense
and cannot. be known to him whose life is counted out in a monotonous
succession of hours of eating and sleeping within a house; whose food is
adulterated by spices and sauces intolerable to real hunger--and whose
drink, instead of the sweet refreshing distillation from the heavens,
consists of vile artificial extracts, loathed by the really thirsty man,
with whom the pure element resumes its true value, and establishes its
real superiority over every artificial beverage.<br>
<br>
The natives whom we met here were fine looking men enjoying contentment
and happiness within the precincts of their native woods. Their enjoyment
seemed derived so directly from nature that it almost excited a feeling
of regret that civilized men, enervated by luxury and all its concomitant
diseases, should ever disturb the haunts of these rude but happy
beings.</blockquote>

<p>He was to hold different views a little later in the expedition.</p>

<p>The party now moved in a north-west direction and they proceeded past
Goonumbla to Cookapie. Here the aborigines showed them how to find wild
honey, which was very plentiful.</p>

<blockquote>Their plan was to catch a bee, and attach to it, with some
resin or gum, the light down of a swan or owl; thus laden the bee would
make for its nest and betray its store of sweets.</blockquote>

<p>From Cookapie they moved across the plain to Bullock Creek, reaching
it approximately nine miles downstream from Tullamore. From this point
the main party crossed easterly to the Bogan, reaching it approximately
six miles south of Dandaloo, and here they remained in camp from 18 to 30
April.</p>

</center>

<p><i>Cunningham's Death</i></p>

<p>On 17 April Mitchell had been scouting forward in search of water: on
that day Cunningham had allowed his enthusiasm as a botanist to carry him
forward without proper care as to direction and location; and he became
lost in the bush.</p>

<blockquote>I had the pain to learn on reaching the camp that Mr
Cunningham was still absent and in all probability suffering from want of
water. I had repeatedly cautioned this gentleman, about the danger of
losing sight of the party in such a country; yet his carelessness in this
respect was quite surprising. It was most mysterious that he had not
fallen in with our line of route, which was a plain broad road since the
passage of the carts.</blockquote>

<p>The search for Cunningham continued for twelve days. His tracks were
found: it appeared that he had crossed Bullock Creek and turned
westwards, but afterwards his tracks were lost. After ten days some of
the searchers found his saddle and bridle and some other of his effects,
with a piece of paper in which the letters N.E. had been cut. He had at
one stage in his wanderings returned to Bullock Creek; had he followed it
downwards he would have found the main camp. It was later discovered that
he had reached the Bogan at a point north of the main camp, and Mitchell
comments here: "It was most unfortunate that had we pursued our journey
down the Bogan, Mr Cunningham would have fallen in with our track and
rejoined us."</p>

<p>Mitchell moved the party down the Bogan hoping that they would find
and follow Cunningham's tracks. "We passed a small pond, the name of
which was Burdenda, and afterwards came to Cudduldury" (now Cajildrie).
They searched again in this neighbourhood but without success. Actually
they were very close to the scene of Cunningham's death, which took place
on what is now Burdenda station. Mitchell himself spent 3, 4 and 5 May in
a long search.</p>

<blockquote>My anxiety about him was embittered with regret at the
inauspicious delay of our journey, which his disappearance had
occasioned; and I was too impatient on both subjects to be able to remain
inactive at the camp.</blockquote>

<p>On returning to the camp Mitchell learned that some of the men had
found Cunningham's tracks and had followed them to a camp-fire, where
many natives had camped; there they found part of his coat and pieces of
the map he was carrying. When some natives who were at the base camp saw
these relics they left hurriedly; there was no common language in which
they could have been questioned: if there had been the full story might
have been known. Mitchell then feared that Cunningham was dead, with the
possible reservation that he may have gone east in an attempt to reach
the settlements on the Macquarie.</p>

<blockquote>To delay the party longer was obviously unnecessary; and
indeed the loss of more time must have defeated the object of the
expedition, considering our limited stock of provisions.</blockquote>

<p>On the return journey up the Bogan in September Mitchell made further
search, but again without success.</p>

<p>Cunningham's movements can be traced in terms of modern place-names.
Taking Alagala as at the junction of Bullock Creek and the Bogan, the
whole party crossed Bullock Creek about halfway between Alagala and
Tullamore. At about two miles north of this crossing place Cunningham
left the party and proceeded south-west, keeping close to Bullock Creek,
to a point just a little (perhaps a mile) west of Tullamore. Then he
moved northeasterly, and after confused wanderings in the region of
Albert and Middlefield station, he must have met the aborigines either
here or further north on the banks of the Bogan on Burdenda station,
about thirteen miles north-east of Tottenham. Some of Cunningham's
personal possessions were found close to the present position of
Middlefield station, so that, according to the plan Mitchell gives of
Cunningham's tracks, he must have reached the Bogan, walking without his
horse, approximately one mile upstream from Dandaloo. As Mitchell gives
the name Burdenda to this place, this must have been the aboriginal
name.</p>

<p>A visit to this part of the Bogan in the summer *will explain
Mitchell's anxious search for water: the river is an undependable stream.
But the country then presented an appearance quite different from its
present condition. As Mitchell describes it:</p>

<blockquote>the country I traversed consisted of small plains, and
alternate patches of dense casuarina scrubs and open forest
land.</blockquote>

<p>He speaks of the gravel ridges, "undulating ground or low hills of
quartzose gravel", and "I observed a few trees of the iron-bark
eucalyptus and pines or callitris, on the highest ground". Today this
country presents a rather dense growth of box and callitris: old
residents say that this rapid growth occurred rather suddenly about
twenty years after Mitchell's visit.</p>

<p>To complete this story, Bourke advised Secretary of State Glenelg (30
November 1835) that he had learned that Cunningham had been murdered by
the blacks soon after he had separated from his companions, and that a
small party had been sent to the Bogan under Lieutenant Zouch.[7]</p>

<p>Later he reported (7 December 1835) that Zouch had located the scene
of the murder, had buried the remains of Cunningham at a place "called
Carrindine" and had built a mound over the grave, marking the spot by
blazing the trees.[8]</p>

<p>Zouch had arrested a native (Burreemall) who had been concerned in the
murder. The natives stated that, six months previously, they had found
Cunningham lost and hungry. They had fed him, but at their camp he became
restless during the night, arousing the suspicion of the natives. One of
them had killed him by hitting him on the head with a club.[9]</p>

<p>The grave (<a href="#p6">Plate VI</a>) and the land around it has been
declared a reserve, and the grave is now appropriately covered with
masonry and marked by an iron railing erected by the Government about
thirty years ago on the representations of Mr G. Hunt, then the owner of
Burdenda station. The location is within Burdenda station, thirteen miles
north-east of Tottenham and about a mile west of the Bogan. The blaze
marks made by Zouch on four trees around the grave can be clearly seen
today (<a href="#p7">Plate VII</a>).</p>

<p>The slab on Cunningham's grave carries this inscription:</p>

<blockquote>Richard Cunningham, Government Botanist of this Colony
attached to the exploring expedition under the command of Major Mitchell,
Surveyor-General, wandered in his enthusiasm for botanical investigation
from his companions, and losing himself in this locality of the Bogan
River fell into the hands of the aboriginals by whom unfortunately he was
killed about 25 April 1835, in the 42nd year of his age.<br>
<br>
This tablet is erected to his memory by a vote of Parliament through the
C.C.C. of Lands, by Mr R. Daniel, C.C.L. Wellington
District.[10]</blockquote>

<p>The slab has been broken by a falling tree, and defaced by irreverent
people scratching their names over part of the inscription.</p>

<p>A mural tablet, carrying a similar inscription, was placed in St.
Andrew's Church, with the following addition: "This tablet is erected as
a lasting and affectionate tribute by Allan, his only brother." The
tablet is now in the Presbyterian Church, Rose Bay.</p>

<p>One cannot stand by Cunningham's grave unmoved, or without thinking of
him wandering for seven or more days in that pitiless country, possible
then only to wandering natives with their inherited skill in highly
specialized bushcraft, without almost following him day by day in his
progress from apprehension through real fear to the agony and insanity of
thirst; and so to his tragic end when, mentally abnormal, he in turn
infected the natives with fears deep enough to drive them to remove the
cause in the only way known to them. He, the first of such faithful men,
was followed on later expeditions in other parts of Australia by Baxter,
Gilbert, and Poole. These four lonely graves far out on, or beyond, the
fringes of civilization must move the heart of any Australian with human
feelings to a realization that we owe to these men a salute and a debt
that we can never pay. We can at least see that their last resting places
are tended and cherished for all time.</p>

<p><i>Main Journey Resumed</i></p>

<p>Mitchell, having resumed the main journey (<a href="#m6">Map
VI</a>),</p>

<blockquote>determined on proceeding by short journeys along the Bogan
not altogether without the hope that Mr Cunningham might still be brought
to us by some of the natives.</blockquote>

<p><b>MAP VI. Map showing the whole of Mitchell's second expedition. Part

his third expedition in the following year is shown also</b></p>
</center>

<p>Following the Bogan they passed Buddabadah* (Bugubada), being guided
by a friendly native, thus avoiding bends in the river. Then past Mudal
(Muda), Woorabudda (Murrebouga) until they reached Nyngan (Nyingan) on 10
May. Here Mitchell was about to fire at some kangaroos when a friendly
native stopped him, pointing out that they were men; and here too the
friendly native, who had been with them all the way from Cajildrie, left
them. Moving down the Bogan the party came to New Year's Range on 16 May,
having passed the present sites of Willeroon and Mulgawarrina; and then
to the Stoney Hills, which they ascended. Moving still along the Bogan
they camped about one mile from that river almost in a direct line
between Oxley's Tableland and Mt. Druid (Oxley's Tableland bearing
250&deg; and Mt. Druid 25&deg;). It is necessary to explain here that the
Bogan, at that period, followed the course now known as the Dry
Bogan.</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* Up to this point the Bogan valley had already,
in 1833, been explored by Assistant Surveyor R. Dixon.]</blockquote>

<p>This is an appropriate place to refer to certain recommendations made
by Sturt (13 March 1835). Sturt, then newly married, could have only just
arrived back in New South Wales, and had evidently been consulted about
this expedition. Writing to Colonial Secretary Macleay (13 March 1835) he
advised that a suitable place to camp was just under Oxley's Tableland, a
good supply of water being in a lagoon there; and, under the impression
that Mitchell was to follow the Darling to the sea, he advised that it
was impracticable to launch boats on the Darling, and that Mitchell would
be very unwise to break up his party, sending some back, as Sturt himself
had done.[11]</p>

<p>Mitchell, after a reconnaissance from his camp near the Bogan, found
no water:</p>

<blockquote>It was obvious that had we, according to a suggestion sent to
the Government by Captain Sturt, proceeded to Oxley's Tableland, trusting
to find abundance of water, the loss of our cattle would have been
inevitable.</blockquote>

<p>At this stage the natives were still very friendly.</p>

<p>Moving then in a direction a little west of south, Mitchell came on
the Darling at a point about four miles on an air-line route from the
present site of Bourke town. From the appearance of the water Mitchell
did not doubt that it was salt as it was when found by Sturt.</p>

<blockquote>I was, however, so agreeably surprised, on descending the
steep bank, to find the taste perfectly sweet, that I began to doubt if
this river could be "The Darling". I proceeded some distance down the
river and I was at length satisfied that this was indeed the River
Darling.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell was so impressed with the site as a location for a base camp,
being on elevated ground, protected by a swamp and a bend of the river,
and with abundance of pasture, that he decided to form there a base
camp.</p>

<blockquote>We were extremely fortunate in the place to which the
bounteous hand of providence had led us. Abundance of pasture, indeed
such excellent grass as we had not seen in the whole journey, covered the
fine open forest ground on the bank of the river. Our first care was to
erect a stockade of strong logs that we might be secure under any
circumstances: for we had not asked permission to come there from the
inhabitants, who had been reported to be numerous, and who would of
course soon make their appearance. As the position was, in every respect,
a good one, either for its present purpose, or hereafter perhaps for a
township, and consequently was one important point gained by this
expedition, I named it Fort Bourke after His Excellency the present
Governor, the better to mark the epoch in the progress of interior
discovery.</blockquote>

<p>This last sentence disregards the fact that Sturt had been on this
spot seven years previously. Fort Bourke was situated at a horseshoe
lagoon known as Eight-mile Lagoon about seven miles downstream from
Bourke.[12] It is now dedicated as an historical reserve. No trace of the
original stockade remains although relics were to be seen until
1870.[13]</p>

<p>On this journey to Bourke were some minor points of interest. At New
Year's Range Mitchell had crossed Sturt's route of six years before, and
here he identified the burnt cypress trees which Sturt had set alight to
guide a lost member of his party back to camp. In his published account
of this journey Mitchell indulges in a little unworthy sarcasm at Sturt's
expense. Critical examination of the points at issue show that this
sarcasm was not justified.</p>

<p>During the later stages of the journey to Fort Bourke, Burnett, the
overseer, being attacked by an aboriginal, who hit him with a boomerang,
had fired his shot-gun, and wounded the native in the hand and arm.</p>

<p>At one point on the long journey down the Bogan Mitchell had killed a
kangaroo:</p>

<blockquote>On one of these open tracts I wounded a female kangaroo at a
far shot of my rifle, and the wretched animal was finally killed after a
desperate fight with the dogs.<br>
<br>
There is something so affecting in the silent and deadly struggle between
the harmless kangaroo and its pursuers, that I have sometimes found it
difficult to reconcile the sympathy such a death excites with our
possession of canine teeth, or our necessities, however urgent they might
be.<br>
<br>
"The huntsman's pleasure is no more" indeed when such an animal dies thus
before him, persecuted alike by the civilized and the savage. In this
instance a young one, warm from the pouch of its mother, frisked about at
a distance as if unwilling to leave her, although it finally escaped. The
nights were cold, and I confess that thoughts of the young kangaroo did
obtrude at dinner, and were mingled with my kangaroo-steak.</blockquote>

<p>FROM BOURKE TO MENINDEE AND RETURN (27 May to 10 August 1835)</p>

<p>Mitchell now launched his two boats, naming them <i>Discovery</i> and
<i>Resolution</i> after Captain Cook's boats. The names proved to be
unfortunate. The boats being ready, Mitchell, with Assistant Surveyor
Larmer and fourteen men, set off, on 1 June, to follow the river down,
leaving the rest of the party at the stockade; but the shallows and rocks
presented so many difficulties that Mitchell abandoned attempts at water
transport and decided to follow the river on land. They were in the boats
for one day only, returning to Fort Bourke on 2 June. Next day Mitchell
with a small party set out on a scouting journey downstream. He reached a
point about six miles below the Warrego Junction, returning to the site
of the present Redbank and from here rode to D'Urban's Group, the
southern summit of which he ascended. At Redbank, being close to the
place where Sturt's journey had ended six years before, Mitchell sought,
unsuccessfully, for the tree which had been marked by Hamilton Hume.</p>

<p>Returning to Fort Bourke, he left on 8 June with all the party, to
follow the river down; and at the junction of Gunderbooka Creek and the
Darling, Burnett and Souter found the tree marked by Hume. Mitchell on
his return journey visited this tree and found the bearing given by Sturt
to be wrong: instead of 58&deg; E. of S. on the southern end of D'Urban's
Group it was, really, 53&deg; E. of S. It has, however, to be noted that
Sturt said only: "I took the bearings of D'Urban's Group, and found them
to be S. 58&deg; E."[14] The bearing on the north end of D'Urban's Group
from near the tree is S. 58&deg; E., whereas Mitchell's bearing was on
the south end of the range.[15] Mitchell assumed a clerical error in
Sturt's account, but it is possible that both were right. Mitchell's
initials were cut on the same tree by his men. This tree cannot now be
located.</p>

<p>Proceeding down the river, Mitchell ascended Mt. Deerina (Dunlop's
Range) and Rankin's Range. In the vicinity of the latter Mitchell
records:</p>

<blockquote>We descried, from a tree not far from the camp, hills to the
westward, and the interest, with which we now daily watched the horizon,
may easily be imagined, for on the occurrence and direction of ridges of
high land, depended the course of the Darling, and its union with other
rivers, or discharge into the sea on the nearest line of coast.<br>
<br>
The position of the hills, and the direction of the river, were here
particularly interesting, as likely soon to decide the question
respecting the ultimate course of this solitary stream, on which our
lives depended, in this dry and naked wilderness.</blockquote>

<p>In this neighbourhood the natives were giving trouble:</p>

<blockquote>Some natives followed us during a part of this day, shouting,
and at length came boldly up to the head of the column. They were very
greedy, coveting every thing they saw. I had not been in their presence
one minute before their chief, a very stout fellow, drew forth my pocket
handkerchief, while a boy took my Kater's compass from the other pocket,
and was on the point of running off with it. I gave a clasp knife to the
chief, when another of the party most importunately demanded a tomahawk.
Observing that he carried a curious stone hatchet, I offered to exchange
the tomahawk for it, to which he reluctantly agreed. I left them at last
disgusted with their greediness: and I determined henceforward to admit
no more such specimens of wild men to any familiarity with my clothes,
pockets, or accoutrements.</blockquote>

<p>The party now travelled south-westward following the course of the
river for seven days, and on 22 June noted Mt. Macpherson.</p>

<p>By 23 June they had reached the vicinity of Wilcannia, where Mitchell
saw, and named, Macculloch's Range. Here they met a small group of
natives who were more friendly, and Mitchell recorded:</p>

<blockquote>We left the natives quite delighted with the gifts, which
were doubtless as important to them, as the discovery of a sea would then
have been to me. The journey of this day opened prospects the most
promising for such a discovery, for the river from that bend pursued a
more westerly course.</blockquote>

<p>This illusion of an inland sea had great influence in that period of
Australian history.</p>

<p>At this point, in the vicinity of Murtee, Mitchell crossed the
Darling, ascended the range on the other side of the river, saw in the
far distance the Nuntherungie Ranges, named Mts. Lye11 and Daubeny, and
"as we descended, I named the first hill beyond the Darling ever ascended
by any European, after my friend</p>

<p>Mr Murchisson".</p>

<p>Although the whole journey from Bourke to this camp near Wilcannia had
been free from incident, and among natives whose only unfriendly actions
had been attempts to steal, they now met definite signs of hostility.</p>

<blockquote>We had not yet accomplished one half of our journey to the
Murray from the junction of the Bogan and Darling; and it was no very
pleasing prospect to have to travel such a distance through a country
which might be occupied by inhabitants like these. I never saw such
unfavourable specimens of the aborigines as these children of the smoke,
they were so barbarously and implacably hostile and shamelessly
dishonest. Whether they were by nature implacable, or whether their
inveterate hostility proceeded from some cause of disquiet or
apprehension unimaginable by us, it was too probable they might ere long
force upon us the painful necessity of making them acquainted with the
superiority of our arms. The manner and disposition of these people were
so unlike those of the aborigines in general that I hoped they might be
an exception to the general character of the natives we were to meet
with: an evil disposed tribe perhaps, at war with all around them. The
difference in disposition between tribes not very remote from each other
was often striking. We had left, at only three days' journey behind us,
natives as kind and civil as any I had met with; and I was rather at a
loss now to understand how they could exist so near fiends like
these.</blockquote>

<p>From Wilcannia to the east bank of the Darling opposite Menindee (<a
href="#p7">Plate VII</a>) the journey was made with little incident, but
the natives followed them for the last three days until the camp was
formed on 9 July, becoming increasingly hostile: "they repeated all their
menaces and expressions of defiance, and as we again proceeded, the whole
of their woods appeared in flames."</p>

<p>The final camp was at a point on the Darling where a small stream from
the west joined that river, and a range was visible further to the west.
Mitchell, seeing that the natives were bent on mischief, selected the
site with more care than usual. As he describes it, it was not good but
the best he could find, on slightly rising ground, nearly free from trees
and only half a mile from the river. The site was visited nine years
later (1844) by Browne of Sturt's party: it was described as about a mile
from the river to the eastward; the dray tracks and fireplaces were still
visible.[16] The position is easily recognized today: it is on the
highest point of a low sandhill close to the road from the old punt
crossing at Menindee to Appin homestead.</p>

<p>Mitchell decided to end his journey at this point. The ranges he had
seen to the westward during the previous fortnight, and the small stream
coming from the west, seemed to exclude the possibility of any inland sea
in the region:</p>

<blockquote>the identity of this river with, that which had been seen to
enter the Murray, now admitted of little doubt, and the continuation of
the survey to that point was scarcely an object worth the peril likely to
attend it.</blockquote>

<p>Then he continues:</p>

<blockquote>scarce an hour had elapsed after I had communicated my
determination to return to the party, when a shot was heard on the
river.</blockquote>

<p>Several other shots followed. The camp was more than half a mile from
the river, some of the men had gone to get water, and others to rescue a
bullock which had become bogged in the mud at the bank of the river.</p>

<p>Owing to the distance, it was more than a hour before those at the
camp learned what had happened. Joseph Jones had been sent for water with
a pot and a kettle, and one of the natives, who had given trouble before,
tried to take the kettle away from him. When Jones resisted the native
knocked him to the ground unconscious with a blow on the head from a
club. Thomas Jones, who was guarding Joseph, at once fired at the native,
wounding him. Other natives came to the scene evidently about to attack;
and some of Mitchell's party, who had arrived, fired into the group--one
man and a woman with a child on her back were killed, others were
wounded. The only account of the incident now available is that recorded
by Mitchell, who was not personally present. The affair was perhaps
unavoidable, it was certainly unfortunate. Memories of it were still
alive amongst the natives when Sturt was in the locality more than nine
years later. Mitchell reflected on this incident:</p>

<blockquote>We met frequently with instances of natives receiving from us
all they could want one day, yet approaching us on the next with the most
unequivocal demonstrations of enmity and hostility. Indeed it seemed
impossible, in any manner, to conciliate these people when united in a
body. We wanted nothing, asked for nothing; on the contrary we gave them
presents of articles the most desirable to them; and yet they beset us as
keenly and with as little remorse as wild beasts seek their prey. It was
a consolation, however, under such unpleasant circumstances, to have men
on whose courage at least I could depend, for numbers might now be
expected to come against us.</blockquote>

<p>In the evening, from the other bank, was heard the mournful wailing of
women and</p>

<blockquote>it was then that I regretted most bitterly the inconsiderable
conduct of some of the men. I was, indeed, liable to pay dear for
geographical discovery, when my honour and character were delivered over
to convicts, on whom, although I might confide as courage, I could not
always rely for humanity.</blockquote>

<p>As a commentary on this, which appeared in his book published in 1838,
there is the statement made by Mitchell when giving evidence before the
Select Committee on Transportation in March 1838, that the convicts on
these expeditions behaved very well indeed.</p>

<p>On 12 July they broke camp and commenced their homeward journey. This
journey was, generally, without incident: one of the men developed
scurvy; and little trouble, except thieving, occurred with the natives,
whom they avoided and discouraged. On 26 July, from the vicinity of
Bulcolco, Mitchell ascended Mt. Greenough. On 29 July he crossed the
river, ascended, and named, Mt. Macpherson. By 7 August they had reached
the vicinity of Louth. Passing East Toorale on 7 August they arrived back
at Fort Bourke on 10 August after an absence from that base of two months
and two days.</p>

<p>Mitchell estimated that they had travelled during that time "over 600
miles, even in direct distance"--an estimate sufficiently accurate--the
present road from Bourke to Menindee being 301 miles. They found the
"fort" uninjured, except that the natives had been busy cutting out the
spike nails which had fastened the logs of the blockhouse.</p>

<p>Mitchell's description identifies the locality:</p>

<blockquote>Fort Bourke consists of an elevated plateau, overlooking a
reach of the river a mile and a half in length, the hill being situated
near a sharp turn, at the lower end of the reach. At this turn, a small
dry watercourse, which surrounds Fort Bourke on all sides, save that of
the river, joins the Darling.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell commented on the nature of the country over which they had
passed and thanked providence for the continued dryness of the winter,
for they could not have travelled over that country after rain.</p>

<p>As to the natives, it was clear that giving them presents was a
mistake as it only awakened a desire to "destroy us and to take all we
had" and "the expression of their countenances was sometimes so hideous
that I have found comfort in contemplating the honest faces of the horses
and sheep". Mitchell recorded his opinion that to discourage at once the
approach of such natives would tend more to the safety of an exploring
party than presenting them with gifts. It will appear that these
convictions influenced Mitchell's conduct during his expedition in these
regions the following year.</p>

<p>It may be noted also that Mitchell found the tribes of the Darling
reduced in numbers by the disease--smallpox or other--which was active
during Sturt's visit.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his experiences with the natives of the Darling Mitchell
observed:</p>

<blockquote>Even in defence of such an implacable disposition towards the
civilized intruder much may be urged. No reflecting man can witness the
quickness and intelligence of the aborigines, as displayed in their
instant comprehension of our numerous appliances without feelings of
sympathy. He must perceive that these people cannot be so obtuse as not
to anticipate, in the advent of such a powerful race, the extirpation of
their own in a country which barely affords to them the means of
existence. Such must be the conclusion in their minds, although it is to
be hoped that the results of our invasion may be different; and that, if
these savage people do not learn habits of industry, a breed of wild
cattle may at least compensate them for the loss of the kangaroo and
opossum.</blockquote>

<p>FROM BOURKE TO SYDNEY (13 August to October 1835)</p>

<p>Leaving Fort Bourke on 13 August, they followed the "dry Bogan",
crossed the Pink Hills on 17 August, and, at this stage, the carpenter,
Robert Whiting, who had been suffering with scurvy for some time, became
seriously ill. Crossing New Year's Range on 20 August, they proceeded up
the Bogan to a point approximately east of Girilambone. During this stage
another man, John Johnston, the blacksmith, developed a serious form of
scurvy.</p>

<p>At this point, east of Girilambone, Mitchell sent Larmer eastward to
survey the creek (Duck Creek, a little north of Canonba) which had been
crossed by Hume in March 1829. The main party proceeded upstream to
Nyngan, then across the bend of the river to Buddabadah, and, a little
after leaving this point, were joined by Larmer who had been to Duck
Creek as ordered. On 4 September they passed the spot where Cunningham
had been lost. They made enquiries from the natives but received only
evasive answers: there is no record of any further search having been
made. Mitchell's only record is:</p>

<blockquote>We proceeded and struck into our old track, where it touched
on the Bogan, and we crossed its channel half-a-mile beyond where we had
been encamped so long, when looking for Mr Cunningham. On this day's
journey we again intersected his footsteps; and I could not avoid
following them once more to the pond on the Bogan, where he must have
first drunk water, after a thirst and hunger of four or five days. There
was water still there, but not any longer the traces of Mr
Cunningham.</blockquote>

<p>From here Mitchell sent despatches back along their outward route to
Cookapie, while he, with the main party, followed the Bogan round its
easterly bend (Mungery), finding in the vicinity of Peak Hill two
stockmen in charge of cattle belonging to Mr Lee of Bathurst. This
meeting provoked reflections from Mitchell on how speedily land was being
occupied by squatters. From this point they followed their outward tracks
by way of Cookapie and Goobang to Boree, which was reached on 14
September. Here he learned definitely that Cunningham had been killed by
the natives.</p>

<p>On their arrival at Boree the two men with scurvy quickly recovered
under treatment. Checking the stores Mitchell found that</p>

<blockquote>we had made five months' rations serve the party nearly six
months, by a slight alteration of the weights...on my former travels in
the interior I found that the idea of reduced rations was disheartening
to men when undergoing fatigue.</blockquote>

<p>The sheep had proved to be a valuable addition to their supplies.</p>

<p>What had Mitchell accomplished? He had traversed and defined the
course of the Bogan from Goonumbla to New Year's Range, from which point
onwards Sturt had preceded him. Hume also had touched the Bogan at a
point east of Girilambone. In respect of the Bogan River the word
"discovery" can hardly be used. Then he had followed the Darling three
hundred miles from Bourke to Menindee. Here again he had added little to
knowledge beyond defining the course of the Darling in that section, and
describing the topographical features of the Darling plain. His
instructions had been to "proceed down the Darling River and trace its
course to the sea". This mission he did not complete.</p>

<p>But one thing he did achieve probably as unwittingly as unwillingly:
by his description of the stream coming into the Darling and the ranges
to the west he stoked the latent fire of Sturt's enthusiasm for
exploration and his vision of an inland sea, from which came Sturt's
expedition of 1844-6 and his discovery of the Cooper's Creek region. The
relationship between this and Mitchell's fourth expedition will appear
later in this story.</p>

<p>By February 1836, reports of this expedition had reached London, and
an editorial notice appeared in The Times of 25 February. In this notice
were made very favourable references to Captain Sturt. It was stated
that, although Mitchell had not traced the Darling right through to the
Murray to prove or disprove Sturt's conjecture that the two streams
joined where Sturt assumed they did:</p>

<blockquote>no doubt can be in the mind of any reasonable man but that
Captain Sturt is perfectly right in his conclusion and that his views of
the geographical features of the interior are confirmed.</blockquote>

<p><i>The Times</i> then went on to praise Sturt's book <i>Two
Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia</i>, and said that no
one interested in the progress of discovery in these interesting regions
could consider his information complete without reading this book. The
article ended by referring to the contrast between Sturt's journeys, and
the killing of aborigines by Mitchell's party; the comment was: <i>It is
a proof of the conciliating spirit of the first-mentioned officer, and
is, we humbly conceive, much more to his credit than if his path had been
marked with blood.</i></p>

<p>While in London in 1837 Mitchell delivered an address before the Royal
Geographical Society: in the course of that address when describing his
journey down the Darling he referred to this article in <i>The Times</i>
in these words:</p>

<blockquote>For an account of this journey from the pen of the traveller
who had preceded me see <i>The Times</i> of 25 February 1836...the
remarks contained in that advertisement evince but little sympathy for a
brother-traveller.[17]</blockquote>

<p>This is a direct statement that Sturt had written this article in
<i>The Times</i>. Sturt was then in New South Wales and from all that is
known of his character, and from the nature of the article itself, it is
unlikely that Sturt was in any way responsible.</p>

<p>No evidence has been found which would support Mitchell's accusation,
although he would naturally be annoyed at this criticism when he was
about to publish his own book.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX - The Third expedition</h2>

<p>Mitchell had returned to Sydney towards the end of September 1835,
and, almost at once, Bourke wrote to Secretary of State Glenelg (12
October), referring to the despatch of 19 July previous, and added:</p>

<blockquote>I had sent out an expedition with directions to proceed down
the Darling River and trace its course to the sea.<br>
<br>
It seems probable that the River Darling flows into the Murray at the
point indicated by Captain Sturt, but that fact had not been determined
when Major Mitchell found it necessary to retrace his steps.<br>
<br>
It is my intention to employ another exploring party to complete what has
been left undone.[1]</blockquote>

<p>There is a faint suggestion here that some person other than Mitchell
might be chosen to lead this other party, but there is no evidence to
support this. When the time came for a decision, Bourke "thought it
advisable to place this party under the direction of the same person".[2]
At least the point had been decided by February, for Bourke wrote to Hay
(1 February 1836):</p>

<blockquote>Major Mitchell as you are aware did not finish the course of
the Darling on his last exploration. I am just sending him out again to
finish and to return to the Colony through the country lying between the
left bank of the Murray and Morumbidgee and the Snowy Range. It is, I
believe, a fine pastoral country and it will be highly useful to know it.
The Surveyor General is a difficult man to manage and I fear I am rather
en mauvaise odeur with him at present. But I do my best to keep him and
others in good humour yet within decent bounds.[3]</blockquote>

<p>Glenelg replied (12 April 1836) to Bourke's despatch of 12 October
approving of this new expedition which he "trusted may be more successful
in attaining its object".[4] Before Glenelg's despatch had left London,
Bourke had sent to Glenelg another long despatch (15 March 1836) in which
he advised that Mitchell had just left Sydney for the interior. In this
rather long despatch Bourke indicated that his instructions to Mitchell
were to trace the Darling from the point at which he had left it on his
last expedition (Menindee) down to its junction with the Murray, and then
"return by the Murray to the located parts of the Colony". Bourke
indicated that this would go far to furnish knowledge of the country
between the routes of Hume on the east, and Sturt on the west and
north-west. It will presently appear that Mitchell adopted a generous
geographical interpretation of these instructions.</p>

<p>The despatch concluded with reference to an incident which was rather
characteristic of Mitchell's attitude and methods. In his earlier
despatch (12 October 1835) Bourke had stated that a map and copy of
Mitchell's journal of the second expedition would be immediately
forwarded; but:</p>

<blockquote>I regret to say I have not been able to procure a copy from
that officer, who has pleaded other business as the cause of his journal
not being copied or made out from the notes he took whilst in the
field.<br>
<br>
I do not consider this apology as admissible considering the time that
has elapsed since his return in September last, and more especially as he
asked leave of absence from his office at Christmas, and obtained it, one
of his objects being, as he assured me, the completion of his
journal.<br>
<br>
To this neglect he has added the strange indiscretion of taking his
original memoranda with him on this second expedition, thus risking the
fruits of the labours of the first.[5]</blockquote>

<p>Glenelg acknowledged (12 August 1836) this despatch, approved of
Bourke's arrangements for the expedition, trusted no untoward event would
occur, and added, in decorous official language:</p>

<blockquote>It is much to be regretted that Major Mitchell should have so
long delayed the completion of the map and journal of the last
expedition, and that he should have been so indiscreet as to risk the
loss of his original memoranda by taking them with him on his present
tour; but I feel assured that nothing which activity and zeal can
accomplish will be neglected by you for preventing their ultimate
loss.[6]</blockquote>

<p>These introductory passages may well conclude with another despatch
from Glenelg to Bourke (28 August 1836):</p>

<blockquote>The friends of Major Mitchell having informed me that a
necessity exists for his return to this country I beg to acquaint you
that there will be no objection to your granting him leave of absence for
that purpose, if you shall consider it compatible with the interests of
the public service.[7]</blockquote>

<p>This despatch was dated in London 28 August 1836. It seems probable
that Mitchell had written to his "friends" before the second expedition;
this despatch did not, however, reach Sydney until after Mitchell had
returned from the third expedition, now to be described. As will be seen
later, Mitchell took leave of absence and visited England in 1837.</p>

<p>FROM SYDNEY TO OXLEY (15 March to 12 May 1836)</p>

<p>In the original instructions given to Mitchell, Bourke had instructed
him to rejoin the Darling at the point of termination (Menindee) of the
previous expedition, and to complete the survey of that river to its
junction with the Murray: Bourke stated that it was considered fixed
almost beyond a doubt that the Darling joined the Murray at the point
assumed by Sturt to be that junction. If it was found to be otherwise
Mitchell was to follow the Darling to the sea wherever that might be. If,
however, it was found, as supposed, to join the Murray, Mitchell was to.
follow the Murray upwards along the southern bank to the located parts of
the colony. But Bourke included a proviso:</p>

<blockquote>If in your course upwards you should meet with different
streams flowing into the Murray you will follow that which you may deem
to have the most promising appearance.[8]</blockquote>

<p>This at least gave an excuse, if any had been needed, for Mitchell's
very extensive and prolonged detour south-west to the coast at
Nelson.</p>

<p>Mitchell's own statement of his instructions was that he should regain
that point on the Darling where his second expedition had ended, trace
the Darling into the Murray, embark on the Murray, and passing the carts
and oxen to the southern bank of that river, proceed upwards by water as
far as practicable and regain the colony somewhere about Yass Plains. His
proposed course, as stated by himself, was down the Lachlan, then across
to the Darling "keeping the lagoons of the Lachlan on the left, if water
were scarce".[9]</p>

<p>As much of the equipment used on the second expedition was still
available, and the boats and boat-carriage were serviceable, preparations
were not difficult. Because of the long-continued drought horses and
bullocks were scarce and expensive, but enough were obtained. The drought
conditions also involved great uncertainty as to continuity of fresh
water for the party.</p>

<p>Besides Mitchell, the party consisted of G. C. Stapylton as
second-in-command, and twenty-three men, all convicts or ex-convicts: of
these, six had been with Mitchell on each of his previous expeditions (A.
Burnett, W. Woods, J. Palmer, R. Muir-head, Joseph Jones, and his
faithful servant Anthony Brown): and five others had been on the second
expedition (C. Hammond, W. Thomas, C. King, J. Johnston, and J. Gayton).
The names of these men should be honoured: they played a valuable
although inconspicuous part in our history.</p>

<p>The party preceded Mitchell, who overtook them, on 15 March 1836, at
Boree, just west of Orange.</p>

<blockquote>On the following day I organized the party and armed the men.
I distributed to each a new suit of clothing, consisting of grey trowsers
and a red woollen shirt, the latter article, when crossed by white
braces, giving the men somewhat of a military appearance. This was the
army with which I was to traverse unexplored regions, peopled, as far as
we knew, by hostile tribes. But I could depend upon a great portion of
the men.*</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* This quotation, with others in this chapter
relating to incidents occurring during this expedition are, when not
otherwise indicated, from the text of Mitchell's published work <i>Three
Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia</i>.]</blockquote>

<p>Each man was given a firearm--rifle, carbine, musket or pistol--and a
small case containing six cartridges which he was ordered always to wear
about his waist.</p>

<p>Mitchell was taking no risk on the score of supplies:</p>

<blockquote>We commenced with due regard to the importance of our stock
of provisions on an interior journey, by so reducing the weight of our
steel-yard, that a five months' stock should last nearly seven months.
This arrangement was, however, a secret, known only to Burnett and
myself.</blockquote>

<p>They took with them a hundred sheep and five oxen for fresh food.
Burnett was "overseer" under Stapylton, and was well experienced, having
been on both of the previous expeditions.</p>

<p>At this camp of preparation they were visited by an aboriginal who had
become friendly with the party on the second expedition. This was Piper,
who joined the expedition and remained with it throughout the whole
journey. While preparations were proceeding Mitchell, with a companion,
visited the limestone caves at Oakey Creek finding there fossil bones.
These will be mentioned again in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Mitchell has recorded his feelings as he set out on this, his third
expedition:</p>

<blockquote>We found the earth parched and bare, but, as we bounded over
hill and dale, a fine cool breeze whispered through the open forest, and
felt most refreshing after the hot winds of Sydney. Dr Johnson's Obidah
was not more free from care on the morning of his journey than I was on
this, the first morning of mine. It was also St. Patrick's Day and, in
riding through the bush, I had leisure to recall past scenes and times
connected with the anniversary. I remembered that exactly on that
morning, twenty-four years before, I marched down the glacis of Elvas to
the tune of "St. Patrick's Day in the Morning" as the sun rose over the
beleaguered towers of Badajoz. Now, without any of the "pride, pomp, and
circumstance of glorious war" I was proceeding on a service not very
likely to be peaceful, for the natives here assured me that the myalls
were coming up to meet us.</blockquote>

<p>This last reference to anticipated native hostility may well be
regarded with reserve as perhaps an afterthought, when writing his book
for publication, to prepare the reader for the tragic event that occurred
three months later and five hundred miles to the west.</p>

<p>From his point of departure at Boree Mitchell kept to the course of
the Lachlan, noting the landmarks recorded by Oxley on his 1817 journey.
He moved down Byrne's (now Boree) Creek to Toogong, then down Mandadgery
Creek to Eugowra, passing and noting Mt. Murga, which he ascended.</p>

<p>The Lachlan was reached at Waagan, three miles east of Tonambil. The
Lachlan was dry,</p>

<blockquote>its waters were gone, except in a few small ponds in the very
deepest part of its bed. Such was now the state of that river, down which
my predecessor's boats had floated. I had, during the last winter, drawn
my whaleboats 1,600 miles overland without finding a river where I could
use them; whereas Mr Oxley had twice retired by nearly the same routes
and in the same season of the year, from supposed inland
seas.</blockquote>

<p>They passed Corridgery (Mt. Amyot) on 28 March, Mulguthrie (Mt.
Cunningham) on 29 March and reached Mt. Tilga (Hurd's Peak) at the
junction of the Goobang and the Lachlan on 4 April. Thus they were in the
vicinity of Forbes about 27 March and reached Condobolin on 4 April. On
this section of the journey they had located the tree marked by Oxley on
17 May 1817 at the point where he had left the Lachlan. This tree was
located near Warroo very close to Travelling Stock Reserve 27876. They
had also caught some unusually large fish in "an extensive pond of muddy
water" near Mt. Cunningham--this pond can be identified with reasonable
probability as that which is marked on the map of the county of
Cunningham as W.R. 388-23879. Here they were visited by two natives who
had met them on the Bogan during the second expedition. (This part of the
journey is shown on <a href="#m6">Map VI</a>.)</p>

<p>At twenty-two miles west of Condobolin a native pointed out a small
hill on the south side of the Lachlan where Oxley had camped just before
he crossed that river on his homeward journey. This spot, now marked by a
cairn of stones, is at the northern end of the Goobothery Range.</p>

<p>From near Condobolin Mitchell made a short journey to Oxley's Mt.
Granard (now Boorathumbila: Boordombil on Mitchell's map). Mitchell made
this comment on descending from Boorathumbila: "We descended, after I had
completed my survey from a hill, which, perhaps, no white man will again
ascend." There is now a trigonometrical survey cairn on this peak.</p>

<p>By 13 April, having passed Euabalong on 11 or 12 April, they had
reached Lake Cargelligo (Cudjallagong)--which they found to be a
backwater overflow from the Lachlan. At the time of Mitchell's visit it
was almost dry. From here Mitchell visited Mt. Rossi of the Ural Range
(Mitchell's Yerrarar of the Goulburn Range). The party moved on down the
northern bank of the Lachlan to Gunniguldry, having crossed the Booberoi
Creek, and, still moving along the north bank of the river, Mitchell
noted Uabba Plain and the Lachlan Range (Oxley's Macquarie's Range) with
its abrupt northern extremity on the river, Mt. Waabalong (Mt.
Porteous).</p>

<p>At some point down the Lachlan the party was joined by</p>

<blockquote>two intelligent native boys each being named Tommy. The "two
Tommies" obtained new chronological surnames, being known in the party as
Tommy Came-first and Tommy Came-last. The former had been told plainly to
go back, upon which he was heard to say he should follow the party
notwithstanding "Majy's" orders, as he could always find opossums in the
trees. I was pleased with his independence on being told this, and
allowed him to accompany the party, as well as his friend Tommy Came-last
whom he had picked up somehow in the woods.</blockquote>

<p>These boys remained with the party until the end of the expedition. At
Lake Cargelligo Piper acquired a gin who accompanied him throughout the
expedition.</p>

<p>When the party had reached North Marrowie (at Lane's Bridge), about
eight miles north of Hillston, Mitchell had to make a decision. His
instructions were to rejoin the Darling at the point where he had left it
on the previous expedition (Menindee), and as the Lachlan was definitely
trending south-west he was on this date (20 April) at the point on the
Lachlan nearest to Menindee, which was almost due west about two hundred
miles away.</p>

<p>In his own account he does not refer to his instructions but describes
his problem thus:</p>

<blockquote>I considered it necessary now to ascertain, if possible, and
before the heavy part of our equipment moved further, whether the Lachlan
actually joined the Murrumbidgee near the point where Mr Oxley saw its
waters covering the country: or whether it pursued a course so much more
to the westward as to have been taken for the Darling by Captain
Sturt.</blockquote>

<p>He therefore made a short reconnaissance westward towards Mt. Lookout
(now Dareton) but went only as far as Marrowie Creek near North Marrowie
head station. Finding this creek dry, and being assured by local natives
that there was no water westward, he returned to camp. On his return he
reviewed the position thus:</p>

<blockquote>We had just fallen back from want of water: a circumstance
likely to compel me to follow the Lachlan downwards, at least if it could
be ascertained thus early, that this river could not possibly be the
supposed Darling of Sturt.<br>
<br>
<p>Should I succeed in reaching the Lachlan at about sixty miles west of
my camp, I might be satisfied that it was this river which Captain Sturt
took for the Darling.<br>
<br>
Whereas, should I find sufficient reason to believe that the Darling
would join the Murray, I might continue my journey down the Lachlan until
I reduced the distance across the Darling as much as the scarcity of
water might render necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So he again set out with five men and an aboriginal guide, and
proceeding westward for forty-five miles, leaving Mt. Lookout to the
north, reached the vicinity of Moolbong. As, however, he found no water
he turned south-west, then south, then southeast looking for the Lachlan,
and finding it ultimately just where it should be on a south-west course
from the base camp. He regained the Lachlan a little north of
Booligal--perhaps about eight miles--the party returning to the camp
along the west bank of the river. At the point of contact near Booligal
"I thought Mr Oxley's line of route might have passed near the spot where
I then stood".</p>

<p>Reaching the base camp after five days' absence they found all well,
except that the native Piper, diving into the waterhole to spear fish,
brought up on his spear a human leg. It is interesting to note that wild
cattle, which had escaped from the settled areas, had already penetrated
thus far westward. Mitchell made a short journey to East Peak on the
Lachlan Range and connected up by theodolite with the peaks previously
visited.</p>

<p>Although this talk of Mitchell's about the Lachlan being Sturt's
Darling may seem now a little specious and unconvincing it is important
that an attempt should be made to understand his position. He knew from
Oxley's account of the highlands to the north of Rossi and Euabalong, and
from his own journey down the Bogan the previous year, that these
highlands, extending as far north as Cobar and Canbelego, formed a
watershed between the Bogan and the Darling; and he knew from Oxley's and
his own observations as he moved down the Lachlan that that river was
forced westward between the highlands to the north and those to the
south. That the Lachlan might join the Darling was, as an hypothesis, not
too improbable; in fact Joseph Furphy, writing many years later from his
own knowledge of the country, said:</p>

<blockquote>The Willandra Billabong which in moderately wet seasons
relieves the Middle Lachlan of some superfluous water, and in
epoch-making flood-times reluctantly debouches into the Lower Darling,
divides the country between those rivers into two unequal
parts.[10]</blockquote>

<p>The whole party moved down the river, reaching on 5 May the extreme
point of Oxley's journey: here they found marked trees. Mitchell
carefully fixed the location of this spot by latitude and longitude which
places it at a point on the river very close to Booligal. Mitchell dug
round the tree for a bottle which had been left by Oxley but was informed
by the aborigines that it had been broken by a child. The natives also
informed Mitchell that three white men on horseback, who had "canoes" on
the Murrumbidgee, had visited this part of the Lachlan after Oxley, and,
after crossing it and going a little way beyond, had returned: this was
Sturt, although Mitchell omits his name. So Booligal, a remote western
point, had in the course of twenty years been visited by Oxley, Sturt,
and Mitchell.</p>

<p>Mitchell was at this point assured by the local natives that the
Lachlan joined the Murrumbidgee and that the Darling joined a large river
into which the Murrumbidgee also flowed.</p>

<blockquote>This information determined me to follow the course of the
Lachlan, and in the event of its soon uniting with the Murrumbidgee to
continue along the right bank of that river to its junction with the
Murray: then to leave the bulk of our equipment, the carts and most of
the cattle, and complete the survey of the Darling with a lighter
party.</blockquote>

<p>The party reached the vicinity of Oxley on 9 or 10 May after passing
Lake Waljeers, and on 12 May reached the banks of the Murrumbidgee
without having, in spite of a long search, located its junction with the
Lachlan. Mitchell's verdict was:</p>

<blockquote>The long course of the River Lachlan is in no part better
defined than where it enters the basin of the Murrumbidgee. So far from
terminating in a lagoon or uninhabitable marsh, the banks of the Lachlan,
at fifty miles below the spot where Mr Oxley supposed he saw its
termination as a</blockquote>

river, are backed on both sides by rising ground, until the course turns
finally southward into the Murrumbidgee.

<p>Two points should be noted: Mitchell did not locate the termination of
the Lachlan: "we sought it in vain"; and he makes no reference to
Sturt.</p>

<p>The first stage of the journey ended with the arrival of the party on
the banks of the Murrumbidgee. For the whole of this journey Mitchell was
crossing no new ground. Oxley and Sturt between them had preceded him.
But he did achieve something valuable: by patiently climbing every peak,
and taking angles, he did, as a good surveyor, plot the general features
of the country.</p>

<p>To this section of the journey belongs an interesting incident. Near
Booligal a native woman with a little girl about four years old joined
the party. The woman acted as guide and, being able to understand Piper,
also as interpreter. This woman (Turandurey) remained with the party for
six months, leaving them at the Murrumbidgee on the return journey. The
child (Ballandella) was actually taken back to Sydney by Mitchell to be
educated under European conditions.</p>

<p>Also, when nearing the Murrumbidgee, Mitchell had the first signs of
trouble. One of his men had fired at a native dog which had attacked the
sheep: this dog belonged to a native who was acting as guide, and the
native promptly left the party.</p>

<p>This section of the story may well conclude with Mitchell's lyrical
praise of the red gum (<i>Eucalyptus rostrata</i>):</p>

<blockquote>The scenery was highly picturesque at that part of the banks
of the Lachlan, notwithstanding the dreary level of the naked plains back
from them. The "yarra" grew here, as on the Darling, to a gigantic size,
the height sometimes exceeding 100 feet; and its huge gnarled trunks,
wild romantic formed branches often twisting in coils, shining white or
light red bark, and dark masses of foliage, with consequent streaks of
shadow below, frequently produced effects equal to the wildest forest
scenery. The "yarra" is certainly a pleasing object, in various respects;
its shining bark and lofty height inform the traveller of the distant
probability of water, or at least of the bed of a river or lake. Often as
I hurried along, did I take my last look with reluctance of scenes
forming the most captivating studies.</blockquote>

<p>FROM OXLEY TO WENTWORTH AND RETURN (12 May to 13 June)</p>

<p>Mitchell had now reached the Murrumbidgee at a point passed by Sturt
in his boats.</p>

<blockquote>Without being at all aware that I was approaching a river; I
suddenly saw the water before me, and stood at last on the banks of the
Murrumbidgee; and it really exceeded so much my expectations (surpassing
far the Darling, and all the Australian rivers I had then seen) that I
was at first inclined to think it could be nothing less than the Murray;
which, like the Darling, might have been laid down too far to the
west.</blockquote>

<p>This comment is notable principally for the complete absence of any
reference to Sturt's journey seven years earlier. Mitchell must have had
available Sturt's published account of his journey, and while it is true
that the map accompanying that account placed both the Darling at Bourke
and the junction of the Lachlan with the Murrumbidgee too far to the
west, the error in the case of the Lachlan was less than twelve minutes
of longitude or less than fifteen miles, so that the text of Sturt's
account could leave no doubt in Mitchell's mind that he had reached the
Murrumbidgee and not the Murray.</p>

<p>At this point in the journey occurred further evidence of definite
hostility from the aborigines. Consisting at first merely of an
aggressive boldness it was soon to become more serious. Before describing
the incidents on this section of the journey their route will be briefly
traced. The party followed the Murrumbidgee down, passing the lakes near
Penarie (Weromba). At this point Mitchell was informed that a very large
lake (Quawingame) was on the left bank of the Lachlan. He did not verify
this but included it in his published map. Although this lake does not
exist it was repeated in successive official maps as late as 1933. It is
possible that the natives from whom Mitchell received the information
were speaking of Yanga Lake. Having passed Balranald on 16 May they
crossed the base of the southern bend of the river near Waldaira. When
they had reached the sharp bend in the Murrumbidgee where that river
turns due south (about four miles north of Weinby) Mitchell decided, as
there was abundant feed and water for the cattle, to leave Stapylton with
eight trusty men, proceeding himself with fifteen men, two light carts,
and one month's provisions, to the Darling. After being troubled by the
Balumpla Lagoon, which they crossed several times, they reached the
Murray on 23 May.</p>

<blockquote>It was quite impossible to say on what part of the Murray, as
laid down by Captain Sturt, we had arrived; and we were therefore obliged
to feel our way as if we had been upon a river unexplored.</blockquote>

<p>They reached the Benanee Creek and moved upwards along its course to
Lake Benanee; then, to cut off the great southward bend, they left the
Murray at Euston, rejoining it near Tapalin homestead. Here occurred the
encounter with aborigines which will presently be described.</p>

<p>Still following the Murray they proceeded, camping one night on
Bengallo Creek, until they came to the vicinity of Dareton. From this
point they crossed to the Darling, proceeding up this stream: but
Mitchell on 22 June decided to proceed no further.</p>

<blockquote>The Murray, unlike the Darling, was a permanent river, and I
thought it advisable to exhaust no more of my means in the survey of
deserts, but rather employ them and the time still at my disposal, in
exploring the sources of that river, according to my instructions, and in
the hopes of discovering a better country. My anxiety about the safety of
the depot brought me more speedily to this determination. To be in
detached parties amongst a savage population, was perilous in proportion
to the length of time we continued separate; and I did not feel warranted
in exhausting all my means, in order to attain, by a circuitous route,
the point where my survey ought to have commenced; while a second duty,
for which the means now left were scarcely adequate, remained to be
performed.</blockquote>

<p>It is a little difficult to determine the precise point reached by
Mitchell. It is probable that he did not get further than twenty miles
north of the junction of the Darling with the Murray. He was then about
130 miles on an air-line from Menindee--perhaps double that distance if
the river had been followed. He left the river at approximately the point
at which Sturt first touched it eight years later. It was left for Eyre
and Sturt to finish the task which Mitchell had twice failed to complete.
Retracing his steps down the Darling he continued until he reached the
Darling-Murray junction.</p>

<blockquote>Both rivers next turned south-west, leaving a narrow tongue
of land between...a bank of sand extended further, and on standing upon
this and looking back, I recognized the view given in Captain Sturt's
work and the adjacent localities described by him.</blockquote>

<p>Sturt later commented on this:</p>

<blockquote>Sir Thomas Mitchell was again sent into the interior. In due
time he came to the disputed junction, which he tells us he recognized
from its resemblance to a drawing in my first work. As I have since been
on the spot, I am sorry to say that it is not at all like the place,
because it obliges me to reject the only praise Sir Thomas Mitchell ever
gave me.<br>
<br>
It only shows how exceedingly useful such things are in books, for, it
Sir Thomas Mitchell had not so recognized the view, he might have doubted
whether that was really the junction of the Darling or not.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, however, the Surveyor General was enabled to satisfy
himself...A ray of light fell upon him, and he became convinced as I had
been, of the identity of this stream with the Darling, and suddenly
turning his back upon it, left the question as much in the dark as
before.[11]</blockquote>

<p>The drawing had been made by a friend in England, from Sturt's verbal
description, Sturt being at that time practically blind.</p>

<p>This caustic comment illustrates the rivalry between these two
contemporary explorers.</p>

<p>Before leaving the junction Mitchell buried a bottle at the foot of a
marked tree "in case it might ever be necessary to look for us". He was
very apprehensive of further trouble with the natives. This bottle was
found by Hawdon on his overland journey in 1838.[12] Mitchell's record
therein, dated 3 January 1836, stated that he was commencing his return
journey, was surrounded by hostile natives, and was very anxious about
the safety of his party at the base depot.</p>

<p>Mitchell returned to his base camp, passing and naming Mt. Lookout and
Gol Gol Creek. He arrived back at the camp on 10 June.</p>

<p>Several minor incidents occurred during the period now under review.
On 23 May Mitchell's own horse was kicked and its thigh broken so that it
had to be destroyed. On 16 May a valuable Clydesdale horse was drowned in
the Murrumbidgee, and, while crossing the Murray on 13 June, one of the
bullocks was drowned. On 21 May the little aboriginal child Ballandella
fell from a cart, and one of the wheels passing over her thigh broke the
bone close to the pelvis. The limb was set and by 10 June the
progress</p>

<p>of healing had been very satisfactory.</p>

<p>The principal feature of this stage of the journey was the clash with
the aborigines in which several of the latter were killed. From the time
when the party reached the Murrumbidgee until they began the return
journey from Wentworth the natives were troublesome. At Lake Benanee (24
May) they met a large body of natives:</p>

<blockquote>It will be readily understood with what caution we followed
these natives when we discovered, almost as soon as we fell in with them,
that they were actually our old enemies from the Darling! I had certainly
heard, when still far up the Lachlan, that these people were coming down
to fight us; but I little expected they were to be the first natives we
should meet with on the Murray, at a distance of nearly two hundred miles
from the scene of our former encounter.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell is here referring to the encounter at Menindee during the
second expedition. He states that there was mutual recognition between
the parties, and that night there were definite indications of
hostility.</p>

<p>While crossing the base of the loop between Euston and Tapalin--near a
hill named by Mitchell "Mt. Dispersion"--a climax was reached.</p>

<blockquote>It now became necessary for me to determine, whether I was to
allow the party under my charge to be perpetually subject to be cut off
in detail, by waiting until these natives had actually attacked, and
slain some of my people, or whether it was not my duty, in a war which
not my party but these savages had virtually commenced, to anticipate the
intended blow.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell therefore sent his overseer Burnett, with the aborigine Piper
and half the party, into the scrub--this was an ambush, but it was at
once discovered by the natives; and, one of Mitchell's party
"inconsiderately discharging his carbine", they all began firing, and the
natives fled. The result, "if we may credit the information of Piper",
but otherwise quite unverified, was that seven of the aborigines were
shot.</p>

<p>This incident was, later, the subject of official enquiry: Mitchell's
account written long afterwards, and after he had been required to
justify this occurrence, is a little unconvincing. In 1838 he wrote of
it:</p>

<blockquote>I was indeed satisfied that this collision had been brought
about in the most providential manner; for it is probable, that, from my
regard for the aborigines, I might otherwise have postponed giving orders
to fire, longer than might have been consistent with the safety of my
men. Such was the fate of the barbarians who, a year before, had
commenced hostilities by attacking treacherously a small body of
strangers which, had it been sent from heaven, could not have done more
to minister to their wants than it did then, nor endured more for the
sake of peace and goodwill. The men had then been compelled to fire in
their own defence, and at the risk of my displeasure. The hostility of
these savages had also prevented me from dividing my party, and obliged
me to retire from the Darling sooner than I might otherwise have done.
They had boastingly invaded the haunts of other tribes, more peaceably
disposed than themselves, for the avowed purpose of meeting and attacking
us.</blockquote>

<p>The natives, although threatening and troublesome, had actually made
no attack. Another point of interest is that friendly natives had
informed Piper that those natives who had, at Benanee, been recognized as
those who had attacked Mitchell at Menindee, were actually "the same
tribe which intended to kill another white man (Captain Sturt) in a canoe
at the junction of the rivers lower down". There is a distance of about
two hundred miles between Menindee and Wentworth.</p>

<p>Although there were occasional scares during the rest of this journey
Mitchell and his party had no further real trouble throughout the whole
journey to the Darling and back. It is a little difficult to accept
without some reserve the alleged identity of these natives with those who
had previously attacked Sturt at Wentworth and Mitchell at Menindee.</p>

<p>Mitchell now turned to his next task:</p>

<blockquote>We had now got through the most unpromising part of our task.
We had penetrated the Australian Hesperides--although the golden fruit
was still to be sought. We had accomplished so much, however, with only
half the party, that nothing seemed impossible with the whole; and to
trace the Murray upwards and explore the unknown regions beyond it was a
charming undertaking, when we had at length bid adieu, for ever, to the
dreary banks of the Darling.</blockquote>

<p>He was about to move into Australia Felix.</p>

<p>FROM OXLEY TO THE GLENELG (13 June to 20 August)</p>

<p>On 13 June all the party safely crossed the Murray about one mile west
of the Murrumbidgee junction. They followed the southern bank of the
Murray upstream until, on 20 June, they reached the junction of the
Loddon and the Murray (<a href="#m7">Map VII</a>): Mitchell named the
isolated hill here Swan Hill, being disturbed throughout the night by the
noise of the swans. Soon after leaving Swan Hill the two Tommies found "a
very curious and rare little quadruped" which they had never seen before:
this was later named <i>Dipus mitchellii</i> (see <a href="#dipus">later
reference</a>).</p>

<p>Describing the country through which they had passed Mitchell
says:</p>

<blockquote>The soil in these grassy flats was of the richest
description: indeed the whole of the country covered by reeds, seemed
capable of being converted into good wheat land, and of being easily
irrigated, at any time, by the river.</blockquote>

<p>Passing by the northern shore of Lake Boga they again reached the
Loddon and followed it upwards in a general south-easterly direction;
they soon left it, and, passing through the Lake Charm series of lakes,
they reached, on 24 June, the present site of Kerang. From here they
moved eastwards to Pyramid Hill Creek (Moonlight Creek), from which they
moved to Mt. Hope on 28 June. From the peak of Mt. Hope Mitchell saw
Pyramid Hill, a little more than five miles away, and various higher
hills to the south-west.</p>

<p>At this point Mitchell broke away from his instructions to follow the
Murray upwards:</p>

<blockquote>The country which I had seen this day beyond Mount Hope was
too inviting to be left behind us unexplored; and I therefore determined
to turn into it without further delay.</blockquote>

<p>As he said in a paper read (1837) before the Royal Geographical
Society in London:</p>

<blockquote>After surmounting the barriers of parched deserts and hostile
barbarians I had at length the satisfaction of overlooking from a pyramid
of granite a much better country. It was no longer my hopeless task, as
on the banks of the Darling to describe stagnation and delineate
vacancy.</blockquote>

<p><b>MAP VII. Map showing part of Mitchell's journey into "Australia
Felix": from Swan Hill to Mt. Arapiles</b></p>
</center>

<p>He moved south-west, climbing Pyramid Hill, from the top of which</p>

<blockquote>the view was exceedingly beautiful over the surrounding
plains. A land so inviting and still without inhabitants! As I stood, the
first European intruder on the sublime solitude of these verdant plains,
as yet untouched by flocks or herds I felt conscious of being the
harbinger of mighty changes; and that our steps would soon be followed by
the men and animals for which it seemed to have been
prepared.</blockquote>

<p>From Pyramid Hill proceeding south-west over open country near
Jarklin, they crossed the Loddon* and continued southwesterly passing
just to the south-east of Korong Vale and Wedderburn. The Loddon being in
flood it was necessary to use the boats. The great assistance given by
the aborigines who were with the party moved Mitchell at this point to
comment:</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* Mitchell had crossed the modern Loddon, without
naming it, as he was moving eastward from Swan Hill, and crossed it again
on his south-westward course from Pyramid Hill. At this second crossing
he named the stream the Yarrayne. Later he gave the name Loddon to one of
the tributaries of the Avoca; but later, with more accurate knowledge,
the name Loddon was officially transferred to Mitchell's Yarrayne.<br>
<br>
<p>This was a very busy day for the whole party--black and white; I
cannot fairly say savage and civilized, for in most of our difficulties
by flood and field, the intelligence and skill of our sable friends made
the "white-fellows" appear rather stupid. They could read traces on the
earth, climb trees, or dive into the water, better than the ablest of us.
In tracing lost cattle, speaking to the wild natives, hunting, or diving,
Piper was the most accomplished man in the camp.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell climbed Mt. Korong (to which Mitchell gave the aboriginal
name Barrabungale). The party proceeded down Fenton's Creek and came to
the Avoca in the region of Logan. At this point in his narrative Mitchell
is at variance with modern names: he here states that he named this
stream the Loddon. The latitude and longitude given by Mitchell make it
reasonably certain that here he was on the Avoca and not the modern
Loddon. Then they passed Kooreh and Carapooee, to reach the Avon at
Beazley's Bridge. Here Mitchell is again confused. On 10 July they
crossed "a deep creek running westward which I named the Avoca" but next
day they "crossed a deep stream running westward" and on the same day "a
fine stream flowing also westward". It seems reasonably certain that all
these streams were branches of the Avon, and that the Avoca was, as
stated above, the stream he had named the Loddon. He left the party
encamped at a point near Callawadda and, three miles from the camp, they
crossed Richardson's Creek. It is evident that they were throughout this
time in the Avon basin.</p>

<p>Now Mitchell, leaving the party in camp, made a short journey to the
Grampians, crossing the plain country east of the range to the foot of
Mt. William. Climbing to the summit they found the clouds so low that
they could see nothing. Camping all night under the most miserable
conditions with an unsatisfactory fire and without food</p>

<blockquote>we succeeded in keeping the fire alive, although while twigs
were blown into red heat at one end, icicles remained at the other, even
within a few inches of the flame.</blockquote>

<p>Even though the morning was clear the low mist prevented any
observation of the surrounding country although "at sunrise the clouds
left the summit for a short time and unveiled a scene of amazing
grandeur".</p>

<p>This section of the journey from Oxley to the Grampians had been
marked by only one special incident. Near Lake Boga the native Piper,
being attacked by the local aborigines, had shot and killed one of them.
In the neighbourhood of Wedderburn the native woman Turandurey wished to
return with the child Ballandella to her own country. Piper seems to have
set out to make her uneasy.</p>

<blockquote>Her child, to whom she appeared devotedly attached, was fast
recovering the use of its broken limb; and the mother seemed uneasy under
an apprehension that I wanted to deprive her of this child. I certainly
had always wished to take back with me to Sydney an aboriginal child,
with the intention of ascertaining what might be the effect of education
upon one of that race. This little savage, who at first would prefer a
snake or lizard to a piece of bread, had become so far civilized at
length as to prefer bread; and it began to cry bitterly on leaving us.
The mother, however, thought nothing of swimming, even at that season,
across the broad waters of the Murray, as she should be obliged to do,
pushing the child before her, floating on a piece of bark.<br>
<br>
She started off, but returned three days later, having been frightened by
some aborigines she had met.</blockquote>

<p>Speaking of the country around Glenorchy Mitchell said:</p>

<blockquote>The scenery around these hills, the excellent quality of the
soil, the abundance of water and verdure contrasted strangely with the
circumstance of their lying waste and unoccupied. It was evident that the
reign of solitude in these beautiful vales was near a close.</blockquote>

<p>From their camp near Richardson's Creek they moved westward towards
Mt. Zero, camping on the Wimmera near Wal Wal. Here Mitchell recorded
that the Wimmera collected the waters of all the streams they had crossed
on their way to Mt. William except Richardson's Creek. This was good
observation on his part for the first time across the country. Skirting
Mt. Zero, Mitchell crossed, and named, the Mackenzie and Norton Rivers
and camped near Mt. Arapiles (<a href="#p8">Plate VIII</a>), from the
summit of which numerous lakes were visible. Mitchell named the Mitre
Lake and the Mitre Rock. When he was just south of Mt. Arapiles, he made
an inaccurate deduction:</p>

<blockquote>Upon the whole, I think that the estuary of the Wimmera will
most probably be found either between Cape Bernouilli and Cape Jaffa, or
at some of the sandy inlets laid down by Captain Flinders...At all events
I here abandoned the pursuit of that river, and determined to turn
towards the south-west that we might ascertain what streams fell in that
direction from the Grampians and also the nature of the country between
these mountains and the shores of the Southern Ocean.</blockquote>

<p>From their base near Mt. Arapiles, a little north-west of Noradjuha,
they moved southwards along the eastern shore of White Lake (<a href=
"#m8">Map VIII</a>).</p>

<blockquote>Every day we passed over land which for natural beauty and
fertility could scarcely be surpassed. Stately trees and majestic
mountains adorned the ever-varying scenery of this region, the most
southern of all Australia and the best.</blockquote>

<p><b>MAP VIII. Map showing Mitchell's entry into the Glenelg River
region and the beginning of his return journey on the third
expedition</b></p>
</center>

<p>Then on 31 July, having been nine days on the way from Mt. Arapiles,
they found the Glenelg River at a point very close to Harrow, and
proceeded thence southward keeping to the high land past Chetwynd and
Wando Bridge to the junction of the Wannon and Glenelg Rivers near
Casterton--crossing the Wannon near Sandford.</p>

<p>Almost from the time of leaving Mt. Arapiles the party had had trouble
with soft and yielding ground making the transport of the wagons very
difficult. This trouble increased as they went south, especially in the
region between Sandford and Dartmoor. On 15 August they reached a little
river "which I named the Stokes in memory of a brother officer who fell
at Badajoz". They arrived at the Crawford River on 17 August: here
Mitchell established a base camp on a knoll between the Crawford and the
Glenelg about half a mile from the Glenelg.</p>

<blockquote>I left with Mr Stapylton instructions, that the men under his
charge should move up to, and occupy the round point of the hill, a
position which I named Fort O'Hare, in memory of a truly brave soldier,
my commanding officer, who fell at Badajoz in leading the forlorn hope of
the Light Division to the storm.</blockquote>

<p>Leaving eight men with Stapylton in camp, Mitchell, with sixteen men,
launched the two boats on the Glenelg, expecting to find it discharging
into Portland Bay. On the river as they rowed downstream were numerous
swans, ducks, and platypuses. Having embarked on 18 August they reached
the sea on 20 August.</p>

<p>Mitchell identified Mt. Gambier, Capes Northumberland and Bridgewater,
named the great bay Discovery Bay and the river the Glenelg, after the
Secretary of State for the Colonies. The party re-embarked, reaching the
base camp at Fort O'Hare on 22 August.</p>

<p>For the latter part of the journey from Oxley to the Glenelg, because
'of continued rain, soft and swampy ground delayed them considerably: on
some days they advanced only one or two miles. Aborigines were
occasionally met but they were neither numerous nor troublesome, beyond a
tendency to steal. Between White Lake and the Glenelg, however, one of
the men fired at and wounded a native in the arm. His defence was that
Piper had told him unless he fired he would be instantly speared. It is
to be noted that this half-civilized aborigine from Bathurst played a
prominent part whenever an aborigine was wounded by any of the party. On
several occasions they were delayed by some of the bullocks straying
because of carelessness on the part of the night watch.</p>

<p>FROM THE GLENELG TO MACEDON (24 August to 30 September)</p>

<p>Leaving Fort O'Hare and crossing the Crawford to the south bank, they
proceeded eastward along the course of that river. When north of Mt.
Eckersley Mitchell, leaving the main party, made a reconnaissance journey
southward to examine Portland Bay. Moving to Mt. Eckersley, then to the
Fitzroy River, and across the Surry River, they reached the sea on 29
August. Here the aborigine who was with Mitchell, Tommy Came-last,
discovered the fresh tracks of cattle and the shoe-marks of a white man:
also portions of tobacco pipes, and a glass bottle without a neck.</p>

<blockquote>That whaling vessels occasionally touched here, I was aware;
but how cattle could have been brought here I did not understand.
Proceeding round the bay I was struck with the resemblance to houses that
some supposed grey rocks under the grassy cliffs presented; and while I
directed my glass towards them my servant Brown said he saw a brig at
anchor; a fact of which I was soon convinced, and also that the grey
rocks were in reality wooden houses. We ascended the cliffs near the
wooden houses, which proved to be some deserted sheds of whalers. One
shot was heard as we drew near them, and another on our ascending the
rocks. I then became somewhat apprehensive that the parties might either
be, or suppose us to be, bushrangers, and to prevent if possible some
such awkward mistake, I ordered a man to fire a gun and the bugle to be
sounded; but on reaching the higher ground, we discovered not only a
beaten path, but the track of two carts, and while we were following the
latter, a man came towards us from the face of the cliffs. He informed me
that the vessel at anchor was the Elizabeth of Launceston, and that just
round the point there was a considerable farming establishment, belonging
to Messrs Henty, who were then at the house. It occurred to me that I
might there procure a small additional supply of provisions, especially
of flour, as my men were on very reduced rations. I, therefore,
approached the house, and was kindly received and entertained by the
Messrs Henty, who as I learnt had been established there during upwards
of two years. A good garden stocked with abundance of vegetables already
smiled on Portland Bay...I was informed that a communication was
regularly kept up with Van Diemen's Land by means of vessels from
Launceston. Messrs Henty were importing sheep and cattle as fast as
vessels could bring them over, and the numerous whalers touching at or
fishing on the coast were found to be good customers for farm produce and
whatever else could be spared from the establishment.<br>
<br>
I proceeded with the theodolite to a height near Cape Nelson, and from it
I intersected that cape and also Cape Bridgewater, Cape Sir William Grant
and also the islands to the eastward. I named a high hill Mount Kincaid
after my old and esteemed friend of Peninsular recollections. Returning
to Portland Bay I then obtained a good observation on the sun's meridian
altitude.<br>
<br>
I was accommodated with a small supply of flour by Messrs Henty, who
having been themselves on short allowance were awaiting the arrival of a
vessel then due two weeks. They also supplied us with as many vegetables
as the men could carry away on their horses.</blockquote>

<p>A record of this dramatic episode is also available from the diaries
of the Henty brothers. Edward Henty who was, at the time of Mitchell's
arrival, seven miles away, returned home to find his brother Frank
entertaining Mitchell and his party, who "might have been taken for
bushrangers and had I been at home I should certainly have planted the
swivel* indoors". Edward Henty records in his diary that Mitchell "had
not the most distant thought of our being there and was surprised to find
Englishmen in that part of the world". He recorded their movements on the
following day:</p>

<blockquote>Self and Frank rode out to Cape Nelson with Major Mitchell to
get bearings of Portland Bay, Julia Percy Isles, Cape Bridgewater: the
morning was dull which prevented our seeing Cape Bridgewater, he got
bearings of all the other points and seemed much pleased with our
attention: we returned home in time to take the sun; he dined with us at
one, and left at two, to join his party: we rode several miles with him:
we supplied him with 340 lbs. of flour--all we could spare--part of a
case of gin, bag of broccoli, onions, a sample of our potatoes,
etc.[13]</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* Small brass cannon.]</blockquote>

<p>Francis Henty reviewed this incident long afterwards in a speech
delivered on the fiftieth anniversary of the landing of his brother at
Portland:</p>

<blockquote>It was in the last week of August 1836 that Major Mitchell
first made his appearance at our house at Portland during my brother's
absence a few miles away settling a shepherd in a hut with a flock of
sheep. Of course we were much surprised and taken aback and could think
of nothing but bushrangers, knowing that at this time there could be no
one settled nearer to us than where Melbourne now stands; but however I
was soon undeceived in the matter as my cook was an old Sydney man and
recognized Major Mitchell as the Surveyor General of New South Wales.
Whatever he may have pretended to have thought we were, he certainly was
very chary of allowing me to be polite to him for he declined to allow me
to take his horse for him or his coat; after entering the house his first
exclamation was "Ah! windows too in the bush, I declarer Well, we were as
polite and hospitable to him as our means permitted, and after dinner he
became much more affable and friendly, and as we had no spare bed but a
cot we gave him that to sleep in, and I can assure you gentlemen he did
not require rocking to sleep.[14]</blockquote>

<p>The news of Mitchell's arrival at Portland Bay travelled by the Henty
vessels to Launceston, and from there soon reached Sydney. In the
<i>Sydney Gazette</i> (6 October 1836) appeared this notice:</p>

<blockquote>We are glad to find from the official announcement of the
circumstance that Major Mitchell and his party have been heard of, all
well, at Portland Bay on their way home. We have no doubt Major Mitchell
will visit Port Phillip. From his appearance on the south coast we are
led to suppose that the object of his journey, the course of the Darling,
has been fully determined by him, and that that river has been found to
join the Murray as originally conjectured by Captain Sturt.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell now moved along the shore of Portland Bay to the mouth of the
Surry, where he ascended and named Mt. Clay. Continuing by way of the
Fitzroy and Mt. Eckersley,* he joined the main party again on 31
August.</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* At this stage in his journey Mitchell was
liberal in his use of names connected with the Peninsular War: Clay,
Eckersley, Freeth, Napier, are some examples.]</blockquote>

<p>In the vicinity of Condah the swamps were giving so much trouble,
especially with the heavy boat carriage, that Mitchell decided to abandon
the larger boat and proceed with only the smaller one, shortening the
boat carriage. The larger boat was left, keel upwards, in the last swamp
which had given trouble. From the top of Mt. Napier, to which he made a
side journey, Mitchell saw, and named, Mt. Rouse and Lake Linlithgow. He
also named the ranges east of the Grampians the Pyrenees: he had already
named the western group the Victoria Range.</p>

<p>Following fairly closely the present road past Branxholme they
proceeded north and east through Hamilton, reaching the vicinity of
Dunkeld at the foot of Mt. Sturgeon on 13 September. Mitchell ascended
Mt. Abrupt, completing his angles of this region and defining the
outlines of the watersheds of the Glenelg, Wannon, and Wimmera Rivers.
Moving on eastwards they came to Lake Repose. At this point the cattle
had become so weak from endless dragging the carts out of bogs that
Mitchell decided they could not go much further without a long rest.</p>

<p>Their provisions, however, were getting low and the time had arrived
when Mitchell should, by his programme, have been back in Sydney. He
decided to leave most of the party in camp at Lake Repose, which is some
six miles south-east of Dunkeld, with two months' provisions: they were
to rest for two weeks and then proceed. Meanwhile he was to go ahead with
a small party and send back a supply of provisions and the boat to await
the second party on the banks of the Murray. Stapylton was in control of
the main party. '</p>

<blockquote>Of the natives in our party it was arranged amongst
themselves that Tommy Came-first and the widow, who most required a rest
having sore feet, should remain with Mr Stapylton, and that Piper and
Tommy Came-last should accompany me. When about to set out I observed
that the widow Turandurey, who was to remain with Mr Stapylton's party
and the carts, was marked with white round the eyes (the natives' fashion
of mourning) and that the face of her child Ballandella was whitened
also. This poor woman, who had cheerfully carried the child on her back,
when we offered to carry both on the carts and who was as careful and
affectionate as any mother could be, had at length determined to entrust
to me the care of this infant. I was gratified with such proof of the
mother's confidence in us, but I should have been less willing to take
charge of her child had I not been aware of the wretched state of slavery
to which the native females are doomed. I felt additional interest in
this poor child from the circumstance of her having suffered so much by
the accident that befell her while with our party, and which had not
prevented her from now preferring our mode of living so much that I
believe the mother at length despaired of being ever able to initiate her
thoroughly in the mysteries of killing and eating snakes, lizards, rats,
and similar food. The widow had been long enough with us to be sensible
how much more her sex was respected by civilized men than savages, and,
as I conceived, it was with such sentiments that she committed her child
to my charge, under the immediate care, however, of Piper's
gin.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell moved north-eastwards with the advance party, passing to the
west of Mt. Staveley through Glen Thompson and thence over open plains
which aroused Mitchell's enthusiasm, "certainly a land more favourable
for colonization could not be found", and passing Tatyoon came to Middle
Creek; then through Chute, Lexton, and south of Talbot to Newstead: they
had crossed the Dividing Range near Lexton. It is interesting to note
that near Middle Creek Mitchell saw fresh tracks of several bullocks: " a
very extraordinary circumstance in that situation".</p>

<p><b>MAP IX. Map showing the last stage of the third expedition:
Mitchell's route from Castlemaine to the Murrumbidgee</b></p>
</center>

<p>From Newstead, continuing north-easterly they passed the site of
Castlemaine on 28 September, and came to Expedition Pass, which is at
Faraday on the road between Chewton and Sutton Grange about six miles
east of Castlemaine (<a href="#m9">Map IX</a>). From there while awaiting
the repair of the boat carriage Mitchell decided to pay a flying visit to
Mt. Macedon, thirty miles to the south. From the summit, on 30
September:</p>

<blockquote>I at length recognized Port Phillip and the intervening
country round it. At the vast distance I could trace no signs of life,
although at the highest northern point of the bay I saw a mass of white
objects which might have been tents or vessels. I gave the mountain on
which I stood the name of Mount Macedon with reference to that of Port
Phillip.</blockquote>

<p>This is a rather inappropriate association of names. Mitchell could
hardly have been ignorant of the real origin of the name Port Phillip.
Later, in a letter to Surveyor Davidson (6 February 1852), he identified
Mt. Alexander as his Mt. Byng.[15]</p>

<p>Having returned to camp and finding the boat carriage repaired,
Mitchell resumed his journey on 3 October. In this section of the journey
between the Glenelg and Macedon there had been minor incidents of
interest. The aborigines occasionally gave trouble:</p>

<blockquote>Smoke arose from many parts of the country but we could now
look on such fires with indifference, so harmless were these natives,
compared with those on the Darling.</blockquote>

<p>Near Lake Linlithgow, however, Piper being angry with two local
aborigines threw his tomahawk at one of them--for which he was rebuked
"in the strongest terms" by Mitchell. Near Mt. Napier two bullocks were
lost while crossing a boggy stream.</p>

<p>From the time of leaving Lake Repose Mitchell adopted the practice of
burying messages for Stapylton, who would follow Mitchell's actual
tracks. He used the unusual method of poking a hole in the ground with a
stick and dropping in the paper "rolled like a cigar" containing the
message. The location of the message was indicated by suitable
markings.</p>

<p>FROM MT. MACEDON TO SYDNEY (3 October to 3 November 1836)</p>

<p>Continuing their journey north-eastwards they crossed a river which
Mitchell named the Campaspe--this crossing was at Redesdale. Campaspe was
the wife of Alexander; Mitchell was keeping to the classic mood. From
Redesdale the course was through Argyle just south of Heathcote, across
Major's Creek, reaching the Goulburn on 8 October at Deegay Ponds, later
appropriately named Mitchellstown.</p>

<p>At the Deegay Ponds the aborigines gave trouble: "Piper, who at first
seemed much disposed to make friends of these people...was now going
about sword in hand" and Mitchell resorted to theatrical methods to
frighten the natives away.</p>

<p>Having crossed the Goulburn Mitchell buried instructions to Stapylton
to await the boat there, instead of on the Murray. From this point
Mitchell passed to Nagambie, then north-east till he met the present
course of the Hume Highway at Violet Town on 11 October. Benalla was
reached on 13 October. In crossing the Broken River James Taylor, one of
the party, tried to swim his horse over the river and was drowned. On
each of his three expeditions Mitchell had lost at least one man of his
party.</p>

<p>Lady Franklin on her overland journey in 1839 recorded that she saw
Taylor's name cut into a tree at the site of this tragedy.*</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* Diary of a Journey from Port Phillip to Sydney,
1839 (15 April).]</blockquote>

<p>On 15 October they reached the junction of the King and Ovens Rivers
at Wangaratta and, still following the line of the Hume Highway to near
Chiltern, Mitchell there turned north passing to the east of Rutherglen
to cross the Murray at How-long. They reached the Murray on 17
October.</p>

<p>Mitchell, never very generous with praise of other explorers, states
that the map by Hume and Hovell of the region around Wangaratta was
"wonderfully correct", although he was at least fourteen miles west of
their track.[16] After they had crossed the Murray with much difficulty
three men volunteered to go back to the Goulburn and build rafts for
Stapylton, so that it would be unnecessary to send the boat back all that
distance, as Mitchell had promised to do in his buried message to
Stapylton. The boat was therefore sunk in a swamp and suitable
instructions sent to Stapylton by the men--A. McKean, J. Douglas, C.
King, and Tommy Came-last. Leaving the Murray, Mitchell passed the swamps
north of Balldale, and Goombargana Hill (Mt. Trafalgar), then in a
general north-easterly direction to the west of Culcairn and Henty, and
to the east of The Rock, they came finally to the valley of Kyeamba
Creek, and reached the Murrumbidgee at Mr Thompson's station near Oura.
Before reaching Thompson's, rations had been exhausted.</p>

<blockquote>Symptoms of famine now began to show themselves in the
sullenness of some of the men, and I most reluctantly allowed them to
kill one of our poor working animals which was accordingly shot and
divided amongst the party. Little Ballandella had been taken great care
of by Mrs Piper, and was now feasted with milk and seemed quite
happy.</blockquote>

<p>They had arrived at the Murrumbidgee on 24 October. From Thompson's
station Mitchell proceeded to Sydney on horseback, leaving the carts to
follow.</p>

<blockquote>Brightly shone the sun, the sky was dressed in blue and gold,
and "the fields were full of star-like flowers, and overgrown with joy"
on the first day of my ride homeward along the green banks of the
Murrumbidgee. Seven months had elapsed since I had seen either a road or
a bridge, although during that time I had travelled over two thousand
four hundred miles. Right glad was I, like Gilpin's horse, "at length to
miss the lumber of the wheels"--the boats, carts, specimens, and last,
but not least, Kater's compasses. No care had I now whether my single
step was east or north-east, nor about the length of my day's
journey--nor the hills and dales crossed, as to their true situation,
names or number--or where I should encamp. To be free from such cares
seemed heaven itself, and I rode on without the slightest thought about
where I should pass the night, quite sure that some friendly hut or house
would receive me, and afford snugger shelter and better fare than I had
seen for many a day.</blockquote>

<p>He spent the first night at James Macarthur's station at Nangus and
the next night at Henry O'Brien's at Jugiong. Passing through Yass and
declining Cornelius O'Brien's invitation, he stayed the night at The Gap,
then on to stay with Captain Rossi at Goulburn. Proceeding to Sydney by
the established route he arrived on 3 November</p>

<blockquote>and had the happiness, on terminating this long journey, to
find that all the members of my family were well, although they had been
much alarmed by reports of my death, and the destruction of my party, by
the savage natives of the interior.</blockquote>

<p>They had, however, known a month before of his safe arrival at
Portland.</p>

<p>Reviewing the results of this long journey, which had lasted from
March to the end of October 1836, Mitchell praised the country south of
the Murray:</p>

<blockquote>In returning, over flowery plains and green hills, fanned by
the breezes of early spring, I named this region Australia Felix, the
better to distinguish it from the parched deserts of the interior
country, where we had wandered so unprofitably, and so long.</blockquote>

<p>He visualized a new colony in that region planned from the
commencement and steadily built up according to this plan. Also he drew
attention to the market for cattle and sheep presented by the new colony
of South Australia founded actually whilst he was on this expedition: he
pointed out that by following "the direct line of road already traced by
my wheels along the right banks of the Rivers Lachlan, Murrumbidgee, and
Murray" herds might be driven to Adelaide with available water all the
way.</p>

<p>He did not foresee that enterprising settlers would have pushed far
into Victoria, and cattle would have been overlanded to Adelaide even
before his book describing this journey, and making these suggestions,
had been published in England; although those who were overlanding cattle
had not followed his route.</p>

<p>Stapylton arrived at Guy's station on the Murrumbidgee close to
Gundagai on 7 November, having had a "most prosperous" journey from Lake
Repose. He had found all of Mitchell's letters of instruction buried, as
already described, in the centre of a cross cut in the turf. He reported
that the native woman Turandurey</p>

<blockquote>has grown enormously fat, and to the best of my belief, no
improprieties with her as a female have ever taken place. She was married
last night to King Joey and she proceeds with him to her
friends.[17]</blockquote>

<p>This King Joey was a Murrumbidgee native.</p>

<p>Stapylton as a surveyor had located the point of arrival on the
Murrumbidgee in relation to the mouth of the Tumut River, which he had
previously surveyed.</p>

<p>The position of this river in relation to previous surveys being
known, it was possible for Mitchell to check the accuracy of his mapping
throughout the whole seven months. He established that he was incorrect
by one and three-quarter miles--which, if true, was good surveying under
the conditions.</p>

<p>The.men of the party all enjoyed the triumph of their return: they
were all suitably rewarded, the convicts receiving pardons, conditional
pardons, or tickets-of-leave according to their status: some received in
addition small cash gratuities.</p>

<p>Overseer Burnett afterwards became the keeper of the toll-gate at
Picton.[18] As for the natives:</p>

<blockquote>Piper seemed to relish his share of triumph most, and
certainly he well deserved the kindness he met with on all sides. I
clothed him in my own red coat and I gave him also a cocked hat and
feather which had once belonged to General Darling. His portrait, thus
arrayed, soon appeared in the print shops; an ingenious artist (Mr
Fernyhough having drawn his likeness very accurately.<br>
<br>
Piper was just the sort of man to enjoy superlatively, all his newly
acquired consequence. He carried his head high, for everybody knew him
and not a few gave him money. With these donations he purchased silk
handkerchiefs, and wore them in his breast--gowns for his gins, for he
had two--and, to his great credit, he abstained from any indulgence in
intoxication, looking down on those specimens of his race who lead a
gipsy life about Sydney.</blockquote>

<p>He returned to Bathurst in charge of Cunningham's murderer, Bureemal,
who was being returned to his own tribe. Mitchell had provided him with a
brass plate inscribed "Conqueror of the Interior": but, as will be seen,
he proved very unsatisfactory on Mitchell's fourth expedition in
1845.</p>

<blockquote>The two Tommies still remained to be provided for, and they
were both desirous of accompanying me to England. I had seriously
intended to take one with me, but so docile and so much attached to my
service were both these youths, that I felt much difficulty in choosing
between them. Meanwhile they remained at Sydney while official cares and
troubles so thickened about me that I at length abandoned my intention,
however reluctantly, and when they were about to return, at last, to
their own country, I gave to each what clothes I could spare, and they
both shed tears when they left my house. They were to travel through the
colony under the protection of Charles Hammond, one of my steadiest men,
who, having obtained his freedom in reward for his services with me, was
proceeding towards Bathurst.<br>
<br>
The little Ballandella, child of the widow, was a welcome stranger to my
children, among whom she remained and seemed to adopt the habits of
domestic life, evincing a degree of aptness which promised very
favourably. The great expense of the passage home of a large family
obliged me at last to leave her at Sydney under the care of my friend Dr
Nicholson who kindly undertook the superintendence of her education
during my absence in England.<br>
<br>
My experiment with the little native girl will be useful, I trust, in
developing hereafter the mental energies of the Australian
aborigines.</blockquote>

<p>While in England two years later Mitchell was advised that she was
reading as well as any white child of her age: the ultimate issue of this
experiment is unknown.</p>

<p>On this prolonged journey, while Mitchell had not discovered the
existence, he had determined the nature, of the extensive region between
the Murray and the sea to the south. He had established that there was an
immense area of extremely fertile country. Although he had really
disobeyed his instructions to return to the settled areas along the south
bank of the Murray, he had actually given a large measure of fulfilment
to Bourke's prophecy that the general feature and character of the vast
extent of country contained within the course of the Murrumbidgee and the
sea from Lake Alexandrina by Wilson's Promontory and Cape Howe to the
35th parallel of latitude on the eastern coast of New Holland would be in
a great measure finally determined by this expedition.[19]</p>

<p>This was true: but it has been recorded by Lang that during 1834 and
1835 there had been a great migration from Tasmania to Victoria as a
result of which "before Sir Thomas Mitchell had reached Australia Felix
at all" there were two hundred persons with thirty thousand sheep and
numerous cattle and horses, actually settled to the westward of Melbourne
and Geelong.[20] Mitchell's discoveries, therefore, were only a
continuation to the westward of country already in process of settlement
or occupation.</p>

<p>Governor Gipps, much later, in a despatch to Secretary of State
Russell (28 September 1840) said:</p>

<blockquote>The long and expensive journeys of Sir Thomas Mitchell in the
years 1835 to 1836 though highly interesting led to no discoveries which
could be turned to profit, with the exception perhaps of the fertile land
of Australia Felix which would surely have been reached by the ordinary
advance of our graziers even though he had never visited
it.[21]</blockquote>

<p>Bourke, however, in reporting Mitchell's return from this long
journey, commended him warmly. He observed that Mitchell had established
the correctness of the surmise of Captain Sturt that the Darling ran into
the Murray (which, in reality, he had not), and that he had gone over and
would be able to lay down and describe a very large extent of a rich and
well-watered country, deserving "as he thinks" the name of Australia
Felix. He added that copies of the journals and routes of this and the
former expedition would be forwarded to his Lordship as soon as they were
received from Mitchell.[22]</p>

<p>Mitchell's journey had one unexpected result. His party being
numerous, and his drays heavily laden, a deeply cut track was made in the
virgin soil and was plainly visible for many years: this became known as
"the Major's line" and formed, as recorded by one early settler, the
boundary of a number of the properties taken up by squatters: "on our own
and our neighbour's runs it formed the boundary of one entire
side."[23]</p>

<p>The <i>Sydney Gazette</i> of 6 October 1836, which has already been
cited as publishing the news of Mitchell's safe arrival at Portland,
made, in the same notice, the following comments:</p>

<blockquote>We expect that the present expedition of the Surveyor General
will be the last required in the southern part of New South Wales...As
the theories of an inland sea, and of a north-west outlet for our western
waters have been completely overturned by the discoveries of Sturt and
Mitchell: towards the north lie the sources of future fame. We suggest
that the next expedition of discovery should take up its labours at the
Karaula or Darling.<br>
<br>
What a field for speculation and conjecture will the discovery of a
strange river create--the old hypothesis of a Mediterranean Sea or a
northwest outlet will be revived and will incite adventurous science to
honourable toil for the determination of either or both
questions.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell found that, with all the glory of his great discovery, he had
to face an official enquiry into the killing of aborigines at Mt.
Dispersion.</p>

<p>Upon his arrival at the Murrumbidgee on the return journey he had
prepared for the Governor a report (24 October 1836) upon the results of
the expedition. Upon receiving this report, with its dramatic news of a
large area of fertile country, Bourke caused the report to be printed as
a supplement to the Government Gazette. But, as he duly informed Glenelg,
he omitted from the published report all reference to the encounter with
the aborigines at Mt. Dispersion.</p>

<blockquote>The mention made by Major Mitchell of this transaction in his
report is so abrupt, and at the same time so alarming, as to have induced
me to omit it in printing the document.<br>
<br>
I informed him of my intention to do so, and, at the same time, that the
matter must undergo an investigation before the Executive Council upon
the arrival of his party at Sydney.[24]</blockquote>

<p>An enquiry was therefore held and the findings of the Executive
Council were published in the Government Gazette, 21 January 1837. It is
appropriate to quote first the relevant clause from the instructions
given to Mitchell before the expedition:</p>

<blockquote>That in your intercourse with the aboriginal inhabitants you
are to endeavour by every possible means to conciliate their
goodwill...and in the event of any hostile demonstration on their part
the utmost forbearance is to be shown by all persons composing the
expedition, nor is the use of firearms or force of any kind to be
resorted to unless the safety of the party should absolutely require
it.[25]</blockquote>

<p>This was the paragraph in Mitchell's report which disturbed the
Governor:</p>

<blockquote>On the following day we were compelled to make a detour by an
anabranch of this river, and thus came upon a fine lake full sixteen
miles in circumference.<br>
<br>
It was swarming with natives and the alarm of our arrival was then
resounding along its western shores. I was not a little surprised to find
on their approaching our party that these were our old adversaries from
the Darling at a distance of nearly two hundred miles from their usual
haunts and come across (as I was afterwards told) to fight us. At all
events we could not have met them under less favourable circumstances;
for whereas I intended to have avoided that part of the Darling where we
had formerly seen these treacherous savages we had them already about us
on the very outset of my journey down the Murray and near my depot.<br>
<br>
Their system of warfare was to follow us, being ready to pick up any
stragglers and to gather in our rear as we went on, the whole savage
population on the banks of the rivers.<br>
<br>
Under such circumstances it appeared to me desirable to draw them after
us first to a greater distance from the depot camp and then turn and
attack them with as much effect as we could.<br>
<br>
When we left Lake Benanee they followed us carrying bundles of spears,
and after two days' journey the numbers in our rear amounted to about one
hundred and eighty.<br>
<br>
On the morning of 27 May they were following us closely along the river
bank with tumultuous shouting, and our own safety and further progress
evidently depended on our attacking them forthwith. But it was difficult
to come at such enemies hovering in our rear with the lynx-eyed vigilance
of savages. I succeeded, however, by sending back a party of volunteers
through the scrub to take them in the flank while I halted the rest of
the party suddenly beyond a hill to which the savages were likely to
follow our track.<br>
<br>
Attacked simultaneously by both parties the whole betook themselves to
the river, my men pursuing them and shooting as many as they could.
Numbers were shot swimming across the Murray, and some even after they
had reached the opposite shore as they descended the bank.<br>
<br>
Amongst those shot in the water was the chief (recognized by a particular
kind of cloak he wore, which floated after he went down).<br>
<br>
Thus in a short time the usual silence of the desert prevailed on the
banks of the Murray, and we pursued our journey unmolested.</blockquote>

<p>There is one point in this statement which is important. In this
account, which was submitted to the Governor immediately upon Mitchell's
return to Sydney, he stated that it was after the encounter that he
learned that these natives had come from the Darling to fight him:
whereas in his published book he took considerable trouble to emphasize
that he had earlier knowledge that these natives intended to attack him,
and so to justify his action in anticipating that attack.</p>

<p>The enquiry was held in December 1836 upon the arrival of the main
party under Stapylton: the Executive Council consisting of Governor
Bourke, Bishop Broughton, and Colonial Secretary Macleay. There were
called as witnesses, beside Mitchell himself, A. Burnett, R. Muirhead, J.
Drysdale, J. Richardson, J. Palmer, C. King, Joseph Jones, and the native
Piper. From the evidence given by these men it appeared that King was the
man who fired first, and after his shot Burnett gave orders to the rest
to fire. Mitchell had given orders that the ambush party under Burnett
was not to fire until they heard shots from the main party behind the
hill: but, for some reason, this order was not obeyed. Burnett, Woods,
and King stated that they recognized individual aborigines as having been
amongst those met at Menindee in the previous year, one having only one
eye, another having extensive scars from burns. Piper had frightened the
men by spreading the story that his gin had overheard the wild blacks
saying they were going to murder the whole party: and the men had not
undressed for two nights. According to Burnett seventy or eighty shots
were fired by the party.</p>

<p>The Council recorded its carefully considered verdict. It noted that
Mitchell's instructions as to commencement of shooting had not been
observed: it observed that Mitchell had not made sufficient efforts to
conciliate the natives, leaving, in this respect, too much to Piper: and
recorded that one indiscretion and premature shot had precipitated the
conflict, although the number of abo-</p>

<p>rigines killed had been less than Mitchell's letter had suggested. The
Council concluded:</p>

<blockquote>Considering the numbers, proximity, and threatening aspect of
the savages, and their apparent hostile purpose, the Council would not
too severely blame a want of coolness and presence of mind which it is
the lot of few men to possess.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Council regrets the necessity of recording objections to
any part of the Surveyor General's proceedings at the end of so
successful an expedition. The intention of the Council is not to mar the
credit of so useful an enterprise but to vindicate an important
principle.<br>
<br>
The Council regrets to observe in Major Mitchell's statements a tone
which they apprehend might encourage indifference to just, humane, and
politic principles. In his letter of 24 October the necessity of
resorting to bloodshed is lightly presumed instead of being, as the case
seems to require, anxiously asserted and explained, the sacrifice of
human life being at the same time adverted to in a spirit partaking more
of exultation than regret.</blockquote>

<p>No official action was taken at that stage other than the formal
communication of these findings to Mitchell.</p>

<p>In the course of this enquiry two facts emerged. As Mitchell had not
at that time given to the Governor his report on the 1835 expedition or
any account of his encounter with the aborigines at Menindee "many of the
particulars of that affair became known for the first time".[26] It is
difficult to understand this statement in view of the fact that The Times
in London had been able, on 25 February 1836, to comment on this episode.
Also it was learned that Mitchell had declined taking soldiers in his
party in 1835, although they had been offered to him. This is a curious
sidelight on his remarks in relation to the encounter at Menindee on the
previous expedition:</p>

<blockquote>It was then that I regretted most bitterly the inconsiderate
conduct of some of the men. I was, indeed, liable to pay dear for
geographical discovery, when my honour and character were delivered over
to convicts, on whom, although I might confide as to courage, I could not
always rely for humanity.</blockquote>

<p>But these comments were written in 1838 long after the Council's
rebuke already recorded, and after the 1836 expedition on which he had
again taken convicts and no soldiers. They must be accepted rather as an
afterthought than as indicating his attitude at the time suggested by the
place of their insertion in his published book, even though this book is
presented in the form of a daily current journal.</p>

<p>All the relevant papers were forwarded by Bourke to Glenelg (25
January 1837).[27] Glenelg, after the lengthy delay inevitable in those
times, wrote to Bourke (24 July 1837). He commended Bourke's discreet
handling of the situation, and stated that he could readily enter into
the feelings with which Bourke yielded to the necessity of bringing into
question the conduct of the Surveyor General at the very moment when he
had completed so successful a journey of discovery. He agreed that it was
impossible to acquit Mitchell of error in having drawn up his report in
very injudicious terms. He concluded by pointing out that it was his duty
to see that full justice was done, and instructed Bourke to refer the
papers to the law officers of the Crown: but he gave a broad hint to
Bourke that a lenient attitude would be acceptable.</p>

<blockquote>It would be difficult to exaggerate the reluctance with which
I should adopt any measure apparently at variance with the gratitude
which Her Majesty's Government feel for Major Mitchell's services, and
the respect which they entertain for his character.[28]</blockquote>

<p>Although the papers were so referred, the whole matter may be
considered as having officially closed on this note. Public opinion in
some quarters was not so tolerant.</p>

<p>Within a few days after publication of the Executive Council's report,
Mitchell sent a long communication (30 January 1837) direct to Secretary
of State Glenelg, forwarding all the papers and protesting against
"wrongs most cruel and distressing" and he concluded:</p>

<blockquote>I can only say that I am a Field Officer in the Army, that my
life has been passed laboriously in pursuit of fame rather than of
wealth, and that I hope to be able to show on returning home that my
labours have not been altogether useless to my country whatever the
consequences may be to myself.[29]</blockquote>

<p>But, by the time this reached England, Mitchell's old supporter Hay
had left the Colonial Office, and Stephen was now there. His firm hand is
evident in the office minute written by him (26 June 1837) on these
papers:</p>

<blockquote>This may be put by. It makes no addition to the statements
contained in the Governor's despatch. If such an addition had been made
without notice to the Governor it must, according to the general rule,
have been referred back to him for explanation.</blockquote>

<p>The account of this expedition would not be complete without reference
to the journal kept by Surveyor Stapylton, the secondin-command on the
expedition. He found some relief in using his private diary as a
safety-valve: he could hardly have realized that it would be permanently
preserved in the national archives. He spoke of the "irksomeness and
thraldom of my situation" and was discontented that on three critical
occasions he had been left in charge of a base camp and was not allowed
to share in the pleasant excitement of new discoveries: but even in this
mood of discontent he admitted Mitchell's judgment and acumen in
selecting the best line of traverse across new country.[30]</p>

<p>Mitchell had previously (1833), in a letter to Hay, praised
Stapylton's skill in surveying difficult country; but personal reactions
during long periods of close contact without social relief often become
difficult. Mitchell lacked that gentler human touch which bound Sturt's
travel companions to him in permanent loyalty.</p>

<p>RESULTS OF THE EXPEDITION</p>

<p>The results of Mitchell's journey of 1836 were immediate. He had
crossed the Goulburn River at Mitchellstown (Deegay Ponds) on his way
back to Sydney from Portland on 8 October. Almost at once others were on
his tracks. The first overland mail from Port Phillip to Sydney was
carried by Joseph Hawdon, who secured the contract.[31] In December 1837
Hawdon was returning from Sydney and stayed the night with John Clarke at
Yass. Upon Hawdon's advice Clarke moved to Mitchell's crossing on the
Goulburn River and there opened an inn (January 1838), the licence being
approved by the Governor in Sydney on 4 June 1838.[32] In that same
month, June 1838, Bourke decided that townships should be established on
the road at the Murray, the Ovens, Violet Creek, and Goulburn, with the
establishment of a military post at each.[33]</p>

<p>Hoddle gave instructions to Assistant Surveyor Smythe to</p>

<blockquote>proceed immediately by the road used by the Post Office to
the Goulburn at the point where Major Mitchell's Road from Portland Bay
joins the Melbourne road and where there is a station established by
Clarke...and furnish a plan of the spot selected for the site of a
town.</blockquote>

<p>By October Smythe had completed his survey, but, without waiting for
his plan, the Acting Surveyor General in Sydney had taken action, and, in
the <i>Government Gazette</i>, under date 9 October 1838, the site of the
township of "Mitchellstown on the Goulburn" was notified. At this time
Mitchell was in England on leave, but writing to Sir George Murray after
his return to Sydney (12 February 1840) he said:</p>

<blockquote>I have just arrived back in Sydney. The Governor received me
kindly and has named a town after me in Australia Felix where the names
of my different children are given to the streets.[34]</blockquote>

<p>It was at Mitchellstown that Hawdon and Bonney assembled their party
and stock and started (22 January 1838) on their first overlanding of
stock to Adelaide; their route was down the Goulburn and the Murray.[35]
The following year Bonney again assembled a party there, and followed
Mitchell's tracks to Portland and thence to Adelaide by the coastal
route. But Mitchellstown never flourished. By 1839 Dredge, a Protector of
Aborigines, recorded in his diary (7 October) that Mr Clarke was removing
to</p>

<blockquote>the new crossing place twelve miles further up the river...as
it seems likely that the road will now be fixed in that direction. Thus
it seems likely that Mitchellstown will by this alteration be rendered
ineligible.[36]</blockquote>

<p>In a letter from the Survey Office in Melbourne to the Surveyor
General, dated 14 October 1843, it is stated that Mr LaTrobe,
Superintendent of the Port Phillip district, considered that "Mitchell
Town" would be the most appropriate name for the new crossing place.[37]
But, as a letter from Hoddle (23 August 1844) indicates, the village was
named Seymour. Mitchellstown today is little more than a name. The last
two communications were addressed to the Surveyor General, so that
Mitchell must have been aware of these letters. In Pickering's initial
survey of Seymour his streets are shown as Stapylton and Piper Streets
respectively: these names were not adopted.</p>

<p>Although Mitchell did not reach Sydney until 3 November 1836, a party
had been formed in October 1836 by John Hepburn, Joseph Hawdon and John
Gardiner with the object of forming cattle runs at Port Phillip. They
collected their stock at Howe's station on the Murrumbidgee and met the
second section of Mitchell's party under Stapylton at Macarthur's station
at Nangus on 27 October 1836. Stapylton gave them useful information as
to the route and available food and water.[38]</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X - Four Years' Leave of Absence</h2>

<p>It was stated in the last chapter that Glenelg, in August 1836,
advised Bourke that Mitchell's friends in England had made
representations on his behalf that it was necessary for him to return to
England.[1] It is significant that when Mitchell had written to his
friends seeking their influence in this matter he had been under
criticism for the administration of his department.</p>

<p>He had previously written to his mother (28 May 1834)</p>

<blockquote>the children all thrive well in this country though I confess
I do not like the country or the people and always think of coming
home.[2]</blockquote>

<p>He had already applied for leave to visit England in March 1831, when
his actions and behaviour had been referred to the Executive Council by
Darling. Now he had another motive, wider than the desire to place his
case, and his grievances, before the Home Government and seek the support
and influence of his patrons.</p>

<p>Glenelg's approval to this proposed leave would have arrived after
Mitchell's return from the third expedition, and Bourke informed Glenelg
(19 February 1837) that he had now, at last, received from Mitchell the
journals and maps of the second and third expeditions; but that as he was
just about to leave for Port Phillip, and as Mitchell, who had just been
granted eighteen months' leave to visit England, had expressed an earnest
wish to be himself the bearer of these journals to Glenelg, he had
entrusted them to Mitchell for personal delivery.[3]</p>

<p>The leave was granted on half-pay of his salary as Surveyor General.
Mitchell must, immediately upon receiving word from Bourke that he would
be granted leave, have offered his house "Craigend" and land for sale, as
an advertisement to that effect appeared in the Australian on 9 December
1836. On this occasion the house was evidently not sold. On 9 March 1837
were offered for sale</p>

<blockquote>all the splendid household furniture, mirrors, plate, grand
piano, carriage and horses, large sized Brussels carpets, Grecian couches
(very fashionable), antique lamps in bronze, pair molu candelabras,
chintz curtains, plate chest, salvers, rich double-plated wine filters,
silver tea service suitable to a first-rate establishment, the property
of Major Mitchell, Surveyor General of New South Wales, who is proceeding
to England in the ship Duchess of Northumberland: and, after the above,
the house and offices will again be offered for sale with about three
acres of land, including the lawn, vineyard, shrubbery, sufficient
kitchen garden, etc.: the ground thus providing all the advantages of the
present commanding site and being capable of subdivision into extensive
street frontages.[4]</blockquote>

</center>

<p>This disposal of his domestic assets in Sydney suggests that he may
have had in mind the possibility, perhaps the hope, that he would not
return to Australia. On the occasion of his departure he was presented
with an address "numerously and respectably signed" by the residents of
the colony. The signatories expressed their high respect for his personal
character and their warm and grateful admiration for the zeal, assiduity,
and talent with which he had discharged the important duties of Surveyor
General; and the address concluded:</p>

<blockquote>Your arduous exertions amidst so many trying and formidable
difficulties, the caution, the scientific skill, the unwearied
perseverance which under Providence ensured the safe return of your
party: these distinguished merits, while they call forth our unbounded
applause, cannot fail to be fully appreciated by Our Most Gracious
Sovereign.</blockquote>

<p>This hint of Royal favour was not overlooked by Mitchell.</p>

<p>The editorial comment of the <i>Australian</i> (21 March 1837) was
caustic. Amongst other passages it said:</p>

<blockquote>We give below the address to Major Mitchell which, says the
Herald, is numerously and respectably signed. So much for the
discrimination of the respectables of this Colony.<br>
<br>
Let the reader remark the passages alluding to the "dangers he had past"
and to his treatment of the "hostile savages" he met with.<br>
<br>
How the humane will grieve and ask against whom does the blood
unnecessarily spilt cry out for vengeance.</blockquote>

<p>As Mitchell was at sea when this was published he would not have seen
it: he seemed to be leaving Sydney triumphant, but already one of the
major divisions of his department had been removed from his control.</p>

<p>In December 1836, after Mitchell's return from Australia Felix, Bourke
had written to Glenelg (29 December 1836) a long despatch on the question
of the control of the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges.
He said that he had long been dissatisfied with the imperfect
organization and discreditable appearance and behaviour of the convict
gangs which formed the working parties on the roads. Hitherto this work,
whether of gangs in, or out of, irons had been</p>

<blockquote>nominally at least directed by overseers named by the
Surveyor General and inspected by officers of that department. I have
reason to fear that horses, carriages, oxen, and tools of all
descriptions are often made away with by the inferior
overseers.[5]</blockquote>

<p>So Bourke altered the system; he placed the road gangs under the
control of military officers directed by the Commanding Royal Engineer,
thus completely removing this administrative function from Mitchell's
department. This very question of the appointment of overseers was one of
the principal issues which precipitated the conflict between Mitchell and
Darling in 1831. Bourke's decision was conveyed to Mitchell by Colonial
Secretary Macleay (29 December 1836) who, by direction of the Governor,
commended Mitchell's services in the laying out of the lines of road, a
service which would "long be memorable in this Colony", but also stated
that the control of road construction work had not been
satisfactory.[6]</p>

<p>Mitchell replied (3 January 1837) that he approved of the change, and
agreed that road and bridge construction under the new arrangement would
be more efficient:</p>

<blockquote>I have long been sensible that my department has not afforded
the adequate means, and I now return my thanks to the Governor for
relieving it from the duties connected with the superintendence of the
roads.[7]</blockquote>

<p>Bourke had stated, in the despatch quoted above, that Mitchell had
informed him "more than once" that what he had formerly contended for was
the marking out of the lines and directions of the great roads and not
their formation or repairs.[8]</p>

<p>When giving evidence on 1 March 1838, while he was in London before
the Select Committee on Transportation, Mitchell had said:</p>

<blockquote>Will you allow me to read an extract of what I stated on that
subject to the Government in 1834, on the duties of the department
generally: "The duties of the road department, as now transferred to that
of the Surveyor General, might easily be defined were they limited to
purposes connected with the survey of the country, but the proper
direction and formation of the roads, however onerous the responsibility
of engineering them properly, are not the duties in which assistant
surveyors of roads are chiefly considered responsible.[9]</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell had reached a state of uncertainty, if not complete
recantation, on the very matter he had fought to a final issue with
Darling. Bourke thus ended a six-year period of an administrative
arrangement which had been unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Of the three divisions of Mitchell's activities, one--after five
years--had been taken from him because of inefficient administration. Of
the other two, exploration had lifted him to triumph and was to lift him
even higher; survey and valuation of lands had still to come up for
judgment.</p>

<p>Mitchell left Sydney by the ship <i>Duchess of Northumberland</i> on
19 March 1837 with his wife, eight children, and one servant, and must
have arrived in England before 27 July 1837, for on that date he wrote to
Glenelg asking that payment of half salary in England should be
authorized, and on 4 August he sought an interview with Glenelg, with the
object of placing before him the story of his explorations and seeking
permission to publish the full account of his travels.[10] He was
informed by the Colonial Office that Glenelg was happy to convey to him
the necessary authority to publish.</p>

<p>He must have proceeded at once upon the compilation of his published
work <i>Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia</i>:
this was published in 1838; it was dedicated to Glenelg. The author's
preface stated that, as the surveys were undertaken by order of the
Government, it was his duty to lay the result of them early before the
public; though he would candidly own that he would rather have delayed
the performance of this task till he had completed another of a national
character, which, connected as it was with the days of his early service
in the cause of his country, would naturally be supposed to have stronger
and more attractive claims upon him. This reference was to the completion
of the plans and models of the battlefields of the Peninsular War.</p>

<p>Mitchell's preface is dated 18 August 1838, and the book, in two
volumes published by Boone, must have been published at once, as the
press reviews appeared from September 1838 onwards.* These press notices
were extremely laudatory.</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* The book was later translated into
Italian.]</blockquote>

<p><i>Blackwoods</i> said (November 1838):</p>

<blockquote>The kind of gentlemen who sit at home at ease...should follow
this gallant soldier, man of science, and man of accomplishment across
the fiery sands of the Australian wilderness...We do not hesitate in
publicly stating that Major Mitchell must stand alone in the exploring
world.</blockquote>

<p>The <i>Naval and Military Gazette</i> (8 September 1838):</p>

<blockquote>We have no hesitation in pronouncing these volumes of Major
Mitchell on Australia to be at once by far the most important and the
most interesting that have yet appeared, in connection with this most
important and interesting of all existing fields for emigration; nor can
it be doubted that their publication will speedily lead to the most
valuable results, no less in a political than a social point of
view.</blockquote>

<p>The <i>Athenaeum</i> (29 September 1838):</p>

<blockquote>As a leader of exploring parties through unknown regions,
Major Mitchell appears to us to stand unrivalled. Prudent and decisive he
advances like an experienced general; executing in a prompt and
unflinching manner all that he may attempt, yet never for a moment losing
sight of the limits of his resources.</blockquote>

<p>These notices would have been unwelcome to Sturt when the book arrived
in Adelaide early in 1839 and may well have been in his mind when,
writing to Stanley in 1843, he said, referring to his own expeditions,
that whilst he had steadily pursued the object he had in view he had
avoided all collisions with the natives and that he left behind him in
distant regions, "which unfortunately have been marked with slaughter",
the most favourable impression in the hearts of the native inhabitants.
He saw no honour in staining his track with the blood of those whose
wilds he had entered.[11]</p>

<p>Captain P. P. King wrote to Mitchell from Sydney (3 February 1839)
saying that he had been reading the book, that he hoped a second edition
would be called for, and that he hoped Mitchell would be remunerated for
all his trouble and expense,</p>

<blockquote>and for the cruel and unjust treatment you have received both
from the Colonial as well as the Home Government,</blockquote>

<p>and he continued:</p>

<blockquote>Cunningham, who is sitting near me, and I, have just had a
good laugh at your dotted track of Sturt's river the Morumbidgee. It is a
good commentary, and speaks volumes. I am glad you have not noticed Sturt
in the book: you had abundant cause, but your silence will be felt more
than any vituperation or remarks.[12]</blockquote>

<p>There was, however, local reaction of another kind. Henry Gisborne,
Commissioner of Crown Lands in the Port Phillip district, writing to his
mother (9 January 1840), said:</p>

<blockquote>I have just returned from a wild tour to Portland Bay, the
most beautiful part of Australia--the same country that Mitchell's
humbugging book is about.[13]</blockquote>

<p>There is some evidence that the expenses of producing the first
edition were heavy and gave little profit.[14] It would appear, too, that
one consignment of the first edition was lost by the wreck of the ship
<i>Red Rover</i> off the Cape Verde Islands. This loss involved copies
consigned to Australia.[15]</p>

<p>His financial difficulties over the publication of the book became, at
one stage, acute. Writing on 9 August 1840, Mitchell records:</p>

<blockquote>Yesterday on returning home to dinner I found my house beset
with Sheriff's officers who immediately arrested me for a debt of
&pound;306 and carried me off. One of these men was extremely insolent
and I had an extremely narrow escape from being locked up in a spunging
house till Monday morning.[16]</blockquote>

<p>This was a matter of unpaid accounts in connexion with the publication
of his book. However, he induced the officers to go with him to his
solicitor's house and the necessary security was given.</p>

<p>Mitchell sought from the Colonial Office a financial subsidy towards
the cost of this publication, referring to "private resources which my
duty towards a large and rising family renders sacred", but was
refused.[17]</p>

<p>He had not forgotten the address presented to him in Sydney with its
suggestion that his services might be "fully appreciated by Our Most
Gracious Sovereign", who, at the time of Mitchell's arrival in England,
had been but one month on the throne. He wasted no time: on 26 August
1837 Mitchell wrote to Glenelg that after the important duties on which
he had been engaged for the last ten years he was ambitious for a mark of
Royal approbation</p>

<blockquote>to gratify my personal feelings and convey to my friends here
and in the distant colony in which I am employed an unquestionable
testimony that it has pleased my Sovereign to view my services
favourably.[18]</blockquote>

<p>Glenelg replied on 7 September that he could not make such a
recommendation to the Queen until he had the opinion of the Governor
under whom Mitchell had worked, and that as Bourke would soon be in
England, the matter must wait till then. But Mitchell would not wait: the
very next day, 8 September, he replied pressing his claims for a
knighthood. In the Colonial Office records there is a large file of
papers written during 1838 in which Mitchell persistently pressed his
claim.[19] Bourke, having arrived in England, said that Mitchell's
treatment of aborigines at Mt. Dispersion was still under official and
legal scrutiny, and any question of knighthood should be deferred until
the outcome of these enquiries was known.</p>

<p>Glenelg evidently decided at first not to recommend Mitchell for this
honour, but changed his mind. There is a memorandum by him on the papers
dated 9 February 1839: "I was prepared to recommend Major Mitchell for
Knighthood and hope my successor may do so." Thus did Mitchell after
sixteen months obtain the prize he had so persistently sought.</p>

<p>During this visit to England Mitchell received from the University of
Oxford the honorary degree of Civil Law.* This was conferred on 12 June
1839:[20] on that same day an honorary degree was conferred upon the Earl
of Ripon, who, as Lord Goderich, had set in motion in 1831 those critical
enquiries into Mitchell's administration which produced the rebukes by
Bourke and Glenelg. The interview between these two persons, if any
actual personal contact occurred, must have been interesting.</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* In the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>
it is stated that Mitchell was a Fellow of the Royal Society: but this is
not correct.]</blockquote>

<p>While in England Mitchell made several attempts to advance his own
material interests. In February 1840, writing to his friend Murray, he
said that it appeared to be the intention of the Home Government to
divide New South Wales into three distinct governments.[21] He was
anticipating the creation of separate governments in Victoria and New
Zealand.[22] He then asked for Murray's influence in securing one of
these appointments as the "appointment which I have held so long must
become very insignificant after such a dismemberment of the Colony". He
also wrote to Secretary of State Russell (4 February 1840) submitting
that the colonization of Australia had been greatly extended by his three
expeditions into the interior, "which were more perilous and extensive
than those of any previous explorers of New South Wales", and asked for a
grant of land of 15,000 acres in Australia Felix.[23]</p>

<p>Writing to Murray (24 June 1840) enlisting his support he made a
curious financial estimate in support of his request for 15,000 acres in
Australia Felix. "If my extra services in New South Wales <i>must</i> be
estimated in figures the whole may be stated thus": and he proceeds to
analyse his services:</p>

<blockquote>When I acted as sole Lands Commissioner instead of three
originally appointed, the salaries of two Commissioners were saved, or
&pound;3,560.<br>
<br>
When I was in charge of the construction and maintenance of roads and
bridges the salary of an engineer was saved, or &pound;6,500.<br>
<br>
For perilous services, during fifteen months in all, performed in the
savage interior, which, estimated by the scale of remuneration of my
predecessor in office for ten months, similar exploration would give
15,000 acres equal now in price to &pound;9,000.<br>
<br>
To my half-salary for three years, but withheld while devoting my whole
time to public or national works in England,
&pound;1,500.[24]</blockquote>

<p>Thus he estimated the cash value of the services he had given
additional to those required of him as Surveyor General over the whole
period of nine years at &pound;20,560.</p>

<p>The reference to the public or national works in England is the same
as that which has already been quoted from the preface to his book as a
task of a national character connected with the days of his early service
in the cause of his country. This work was the completion of the plans of
the Peninsula battlefields which he had been obliged to abondon in 1826:
it was continued during this visit to England, and appeared in 1840 in a
publication <i>Maps and Plans of the Principal Battles in the Spanish
Peninsula and the South of France</i> by James Wyld, Geographer to the
Queen. In the introduction to this volume it is stated that the
supervision of this work was continued gratuitously by Sir George Murray;
and, of Mitchell, it is said that</p>

<blockquote>all the advantages which were originally expected to result
from his talents, acquirements, and industry: these, together with
increased practical skill, have been disinterestedly, as well as most
assiduously, afforded.</blockquote>

<p>Altogether twenty-six of the fifty-one maps, plans, and sketches are
from Mitchell's hand, and they cover the whole field of Wellington's
movements from Talavera in July 1809 to the Battle of Toulouse in April
1814. It is appropriate to recall here a letter from Sir Benjamin D'Urban
to Sir George Murray (21 April 1819) which is quoted in that volume. He
said: <i>I think you will be satisfied with Mitchell's work: he is a very
excellent draughtsman, the most laborious and patient one I ever yet
saw.</i></p>

<p>It is evident that this task required an extension of leave beyond the
eighteen months from 19 March 1837, originally granted, and Glenelg
notified Gipps (who had succeeded Bourke) that he had granted Mitchell an
extension of leave for one year. Glenelg's despatch was dated 19 July
1838.[25] Mitchell was normally due back in Sydney in September 1838.</p>

<p>He was not able, however, to complete the series of drawings and plans
in the time allowed, and wrote to Russell (2 March 1840) asking for a
further extension of six months.[26] In this he was supported by Murray,
and also by Sir Hussey Vivian who wrote independently to Russell (29
February 1840) saying that he had been influenced by Mitchell's friends.
Russell replied that as the work he was doing in England had no connexion
with his duties as Surveyor General, he would grant a further extension
of three months' leave but Mitchell must leave England on or before 18
June 1840. Accordingly he arrived back in Sydney with his family in the
barque <i>Mary Bannatyne</i> on 4 February 1841, and resumed duty as
Surveyor General. He was now Sir Thomas Mitchell.</p>

<p>It is appropriate to point out at this stage that in the five years
before beginning his leave Mitchell had been absent on his three
expeditions a total of approximately seventeen months: and fourteen of
these months had been during the last two years. This prolonged leave of
absence of nearly four years meant that, of the six years ending December
1840, he had been on active duty in his department for approximately ten
months.</p>

<p>Evidently he was not successful in whatever applications he had made
in London for a grant of land, for there is on record the draft of a
petition to the Queen, apparently to be sent through Murray (25 November
1841). In this he reviews his services: the trigonometrical survey and
map of nineteen counties, the surveying and construction of public roads,
his three expeditions of discovery, and his plans of the battlefields of
the Peninsular War. He refers to the fact that grants of land had been
discontinued but asks for a grant of portion of the land which his
services have assisted to make known and render available to Her
Majesty's subjects.[27] This draft petition is associated with a letter
in which he speaks of the fate of "poor Stapylton, I need not remind you
that he is not the only fellow traveller of mine whom the natives have
killed".[28] Stapylton was killed by aborigines while surveying on the
upper Bogan River in Queensland on 30 May 1840.[29]</p>

<p>A despatch from Stanley to Gipps (6 December 1841) shows that the
memorial which had been prepared by Mitchell in London asking for some
reward in recognition of his services in exploration had been received
and officially considered.[30] It had evidently reached the Treasury, as
that department asked for further particulars. In reply Stephen of the
Colonial Office forwarded copies of the despatches, and of the findings
of the Council in relation to the Mt. Dispersion episode. The Treasury
Lords replied that they were satisfied as to the services performed and
the nature of the expeditions but must withhold their approval of any
special reward until they received from Lord John Russell an assurance
that he was perfectly satisfied as to the Mt. Dispersion matter. The
Colonial Office replied that Lord Glenelg and the Marquis of Normanby had
both considered all the circumstances, and had, notwithstanding this
episode, recommended Mitchell to Her Majesty as deserving the honour of
knighthood for the very same service in the performance of which it
occurred. The Treasury Lords thereupon decided that the Governor should
suggest to the Council in New South Wales a "grant to Sir Thomas Mitchell
and the surviving officers of his party on that expedition", of an amount
which would make up their pay while absent on the expedition to double
what it would have been if they had remained on duty in Sydney.[31] The
Council unanimously voted that this gratuity should be paid.</p>

<p>There is a Colonial Office minute of August 1840 by Vernon Smith
recording a visit by Mitchell:</p>

<blockquote>I mentioned to him* that it might be disagreeable to Mitchell
to have his conduct in the expedition towards the aborigines stated,
since when Mitchell has called here and says he considers himself
whitewashed by knighthood. Whether Parliament will consider whitewashing
a good preparation for a vote of public monies he does not seem to
consider.[32]</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* Henry Goulburn, M.P. for Cambridge, to whom
Stapylton was related.]</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell delivered before the Royal Geographical Society in London a
long address on his explorations in Australia. This address contains a
statement of many of his views at that period (1837): it is to be found
in full text in the journal of the society, vol. vii, pt. 11, p. 271. In
this address his references to Oxley and Sturt were unfriendly. He
emphasized his reliance throughout his travels and his survey work upon
connecting up prominent peaks by angular plotting; and the importance in
exploration of relating topographically the ranges and the highlands,
instead of following river beds. This was a reflection on the practice of
Oxley and Sturt. He expressed the interesting speculation that it was not
improbable, in view of the course of the Darling and of the high lands
visible to the west of that river, that another river existed running
parallel to the Darling and discharging in the vicinity of Streaky Bay on
the south coast. This was not, on the whole, a bad guess. Finally he said
that the waters from the northern coastal ranges "must flow somewhere and
the most certain line of exploration for the solution of this question
appears to be in the prolongation of that marked by me in 1831". Eight
years later he followed up this idea on his fourth expedition.</p>

<p>Both Sturt and Leichhardt were honoured by the award of the gold medal
of the Royal Geographical Society, but Mitchell was not thus
honoured.</p>

<p>Some glimpses of personal incidents during this period are available.
Writing on 4 July 1838, he said that his eldest son Livingstone had
received a commission and must be fitted out for India, and he stated:
"we have now nine children and a heavy source of care and anxiety they
are".[33]</p>

<p>Writing to Lord John Russell on 4 February 1840, he spoke of his
family as ten children; the two youngest must have been born in London.
Two daughters were at school in Bristol.[34]</p>

<p>Early in the year 1839 a silver coffee-pot was presented to Mitchell
by the merchants of London in honour of his discovery of Australia Felix;
the contributions to this gift, however, were not as great as had been
expected.[35]</p>

<p>George Gordon McCrae, who came to Australia in 1841 while still a boy,
and who became a respected member of Melbourne society, achieving some
distinction as a poet, has recorded that one of his earliest
recollections of what led to the migration of his family to Australia was
being taken by his father to see "our friend Major T. L. Mitchell" at his
home in London. Mitchell showed them his pictures and a large clay model
of the battlefield of Waterloo upon which he was then working. Mitchell
induced McCrae's father to settle in Australia.[36]</p>

<p>Surveyor Russell, who had been Clerk of Works at Port Phillip, writing
in December 1841, said that Mitchell was a man rough in manner but a good
and constant friend; a Tory and consequently on no good terms with Sir
Richard Bourke.[37]</p>

<p><i>Mitchell's Scientific Interests</i></p>

<p>Some reference should be made to Mitchell's scientific activities;
already in the preceding chapter his visit to the limestone caves at
Oakey Creek has been noted. His contributions to scientific knowledge
were considerable, but, except in the field of geology, they were as a
collector not as a scientist; and on the third and fourth expeditions he
had official "collectors" as members of his party.</p>

<p>The Colonial Office had prescribed a set of standing instructions for
explorers which had been officially communicated to both Oxley and Sturt.
These specified that the explorer should, as far as was in his power,
attend to the animal, vegetable, and mineral productions of the country,
noting down everything that occurred to him, and preserving specimens as
far as his means would permit, especially some of all the ripe seeds that
he might discover. When the preservation of specimens was impossible,
drawings or detailed accounts of them were very desirable.</p>

<p>In the preface to his published account of the first three expeditions
Mitchell said, speaking as an author:</p>

<blockquote>there is one branch of his subject on which justice and
gratitude render it necessary for him to say something more. In those
departments of natural history to which he owns himself a stranger he has
received assistance of the utmost value from several distinguished
persons.</blockquote>

<p>He mentioned Dr Lindley who classified all the botanical specimens;
Professor Faraday who estimated the saline content of some of the inland
lakes; Professor Owen who reported on the fossil remains, and Mr
Alexander Macleay, Colonial Secretary in Sydney, who had wide scientific
interests:</p>

<blockquote>to these gentlemen and other scientific friends the warmest
acknowledgments of the writer are due for whatever naturalists may deem
worthy of praise in these pages.</blockquote>

<p>In his book he inserts the scientific description as recorded by these
scientists in respect of each specimen in relation to its appropriate
geographical locality.</p>

<p>On his fourth expedition he honoured Lindley, Faraday, Owen and Clift,
by giving their names to mountains in Queensland. Clift was curator of
the Hunterian Museum where the fossils were examined.</p>

<p>Some aspects of the story of the fossil bones have a special
scientific interest. The common Australian wombat has the scientific name
<i>Phascolomys mitchellii</i>. Concerning the origin of this name, which
in accordance with scientific practice allots to Mitchell some measure of
priority in relation either to first discovery or to first scientific
description, there is an involved story.</p>

<p>The wombat as a living animal was well known long before Mitchell's
arrival in the colony, and the surgeon George Bass had, in 1800, written
for Banks a scientific description of "the quadruped called wombat in New
South Wales".[38] At some time before 1830 Mr George Rankin of Bathurst
discovered in the limestone caves of the Wellington valley a quantity of
fossil bones. These bones were entrusted by Mr Rankin to the Rev. J. D.
Lang, when the latter left for England in 1830, for transmission to the
University of Edinburgh.[39] A note concerning these bones was published
in one of the Sydney papers, and this note was afterwards republished by
Professor Jamieson of the Edinburgh University in the <i>New Edinburgh
Philosophical Journal</i> for 1831: some of these bones were sent from
Edinburgh to the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in
London. Amongst these was the skull of a wombat.</p>

<p>In 1831 Mitchell, who had become interested in the geology of these
caves and also in the fossil bones, sent to the Geological Society in
England three large boxes of these fossil bones. In a letter to Mr Rankin
(17 January 1831) he refered to Rankin's previous association with
Jamieson in Edinburgh and added: "we may hope, in time, to find out what
'Father Time' has been about"; and in October 1831, writing again to
Rankin:</p>

<blockquote>I have now the <i>Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</i>, where
I see honourable mention made of you, and a great deal more about the
bones. They find most of them to be wombats and kangaroos.</blockquote>

<p>When Mitchell visited England in 1837 he called on Professor Owen at
the Royal College of Surgeons. It is not clear whether he took more
specimens with him, but in his own account he speaks of "the animal
remains found by me" and Professor Owen in a letter (8 May 1838) refers
to "the fossil remains which you discovered in Wellington Valley": from
Mitchell's own account it appears that he, personally, made careful
exploration of these caves and recovered many bones.</p>

<p>Professor Owen in his letter to Mitchell, after detailing certain
characteristics of one skull which he had examined, wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The fossil is also a little larger than the largest wombat's
cranium in the Hunterian collection. From these differences I feel no
hesitation in considering the species to which these fossils belong as
distinct: and propose to call it Phascolomys mitchellii.[40]</blockquote>

<p>It was subsequently established that this cranium was that of a common
wombat, and thus Mitchell's name, given first to a nonexistent species,
has become permanently attached to the common wombat.</p>

<p>Mitchell's activity and enthusiasm undoubtedly accelerated the close
study of these fossil remains from which came knowledge of the extinct
giant kangaroos, of the diprotodonts, and of the fact that the Tasmanian
wolf and the Tasmanian devil, now confined to Tasmania, once existed on
the Australian mainland.</p>

<p>Sturt paid generous tribute to Mitchell's activities in this
field:</p>

<blockquote>The local interest which has of late years been taken in the
prosecution of geological investigations led many gentlemen to examine
the contents of these caverns; and amongst the most forward Major
Mitchell, the Surveyor General, must justly be considered to whose
indefatigable perseverance the scientific world is already so much
indebted.[41]</blockquote>

<p><a name="dipus"></a>Brief reference has already been made to the
finding of the curious little quadruped named <i>Dipus mitchellii</i>.
The animal was described by Mitchell in these terms:</p>

<blockquote>Its fore and hind legs resembled in proportion those of the
kangaroo: and it used the latter by leaping on its hind quarters in the
same manner as that animal. It was not much larger than a common
field-mouse, but the tail was longer in proportion to the rest of the
body, even than that of a kangaroo, and terminated in a hairy brush about
two inches long.[42]</blockquote>

<p>The specimen found by Mitchell was deposited in the Australian Museum:
Ogilby, in London, received from Mitchell a drawing and description of
the animal from which material he gave the name <i>Dipus mitchellii</i>.[43]
After some changes in nomenclature the official name is now <i>Notomys
mitchelli Ogilby 1838</i>. The popular name is "Mitchell's hopping
mouse". It has become rare to the point of probable extinction in all
settled areas.[44]</p>

<p>Another contact Mitchell had with the early stages in the study of
biological evolution, and science generally, arose from the visit of
Charles Darwin to Australia in 1836: while in Sydney Darwin visited the
Blue Mountains and was impressed by those great perpendicular cliffs.
After his return to England he had communications, either personal or by
correspondence, with Mitchell concerning the geology of this
range.[45]</p>

<p>It was probably during Mitchell's visit to England in 1837 that he
gave to Darwin a specimen of what is now known as an "australite",
probably of meteorite origin, which had been found on the "great sandy
plain between the rivers Darling and Murray". This was described by
Darwin in his <i>Geological Observations, 1844</i>: it was the first
recorded australite.[46]</p>

<h2><a name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI - In Politics and Out Again</h2>

<p>During the years 1841-5 Mitchell continued his duties as Surveyor
General; it was not a period without incident. Bourke had left New South
Wales in December 1837, and had been succeeded by Gipps, the third senior
army officer to become Governor. Gipps, referring to Glenelg's
notification that he had approved an extension of leave for Mitchell,
advised (16 October 1840) that the Legislative Council had objected to
the continued payment of half salary to Mitchell for such a long period
of absence from his duties.[1] His salary at that time was &pound;1,000 per
annum.</p>

<p>The Australian (22 August 1840) had referred to his prolonged
absence:</p>

<blockquote>Sir Thomas Mitchell, doubtless a meritorious man, has now
been an absentee and therefore a sinecurist for a considerable
time.</blockquote>

<p>A little later (13 March 1841) the same paper stated that the
Campbelltown and Appin people were anxiously awaiting Mitchell's return
as he had, before he left for England, promised that he would construct a
new road into that district: this road would have provided a better route
to the district around Mitchell's property "Parkhall".</p>

<p>In 1840 Gipps had asked Secretary of State Russell (17 October 1840)
for more surveying staff as some were required for New Zealand: this
request was met by additional staff sent from England for both New
Zealand and New South Wales.[2] During 1842 correspondence occurred
concerning the dismissal from the public service of Assistant Surveyor
Dixon after nearly fifteen years' service. Various reasons were assigned
for his dismissal, but Gipps offered as proof of Dixon's "habitual
disregard of official duty" the fact that he had published and sold,
without Gipps' knowledge or consent, a map of Moreton Bay compiled from
surveys and documents obtained in the course of official duty; thus
repeating in intentional defiance of all authority the very irregularity
which, in respect of his previous publication of a map of the colony, led
to the first complaints against him by the head of his department.[3] The
"map of the colony" referred to was published for Robert Dixon by Cross
in London in 1837.[4] This is a curious incident in view of Mitchell's
own action eight years earlier when he had obtained official approval to
sell an engraved map of the colony for his own profit (see <a href=
"#aa">earlier</a>). He might well have been jealous of Dixon's map of the
colony published almost simultaneously with his own as, while Mitchell's
map was more ornamental and florid, it was much less practically
informative.</p>

<p>Writing to his old friend Sir George Murray (12 February 1841) a few
days after his return to Sydney from his protracted leave Mitchell
complained that with the abolition of transportation "the glory of Sydney
is departed": he said that he regretted not having approached Lord John
Russell to secure an order that he should be placed on the Executive
Council.</p>

<blockquote>It occurs to me that by the time this letter reaches your
hands it might be in your power so to order it, and that you would see
the propriety of placing me on a footing in the government with the other
civil officers composing the Council. Our present Governor has received
me very kindly and I hope to get through my duties under his auspices
with more satisfaction to myself than I have done
heretofore.[5]</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell was here referring to Gipps who during Mitchell's absence in
England, had succeeded Bourke as Governor.*</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* This was, of course, before the events which
have been narrated in this chapter.]</blockquote>

<p>As an appropriate commentary it only remains to be added that during
Mitchell's absence on his fourth expedition five years later it became
necessary to fill a vacancy in the Executive Council, Mitchell being the
most senior officer in the service for consideration. Gipps' comment was:
"My despatches will sufficiently shew that I cannot in any manner
recommend the first-named (Mitchell)."</p>

<p>In 1842 occurred an incident which revealed some aspects of, and
defects in, the administration of the Surveyor General's Department. It
also gave evidence that the Colonial Office in London, with the most
complete intention to maintain impartial justice, might, in their
ignorance of the conditions in the colony, make mistakes. Gipps, on
Mitchell's recommendation, had dismissed from the service Assistant
Surveyor F. F. Rusden. He informed Secretary of State Stanley (24 March
1842) of the circumstances when forwarding an appeal by Rusden. He said
that during the four years since his arrival he had had constantly to
complain of the very great expense of the Surveyor General's Department,
as well as of the inefficiency of some of the officers, and of the want
of subordination, or even of common respect to their chief or to the
Government, on the part of others. One major cause of their inefficiency
was that though they were provided with full equipment so that they might
be constantly in the field, many of them became owners of land so that
not only did their private interests conflict with their official duties,
but they objected when transferred on duty to another district. This was
Rusden's case. Because of Mitchell's prolonged absence on leave, Gipps
had to wait nearly four years before signing the reforms he considered
necessary. Upon Mitchell's return he at once took action. His first move
was to reduce severely the equipment with which surveyors were provided
when they took the field on duty; this made it impossible for
departmental horses, oxen, carriages, tents, etc., to be used on the
surveyors' private property. The surveyors were now required to provide
their own equipment, receiving &pound;100 per annum for its
maintenance.</p>

<p>Gipps impressed on Stanley that he, as Governor, had promised Mitchell
that he would give all the support in his power, even to the dismissal of
inefficient officers: and he ended his despatch with a submission that
the worst possible effect would be produced "in this important but very
expensive department" if the action in dismissing Rusden was not endorsed
by Stanley.[6] Stanley, however, replied (8 December 1842) that while he
greatly regretted having to take a step which might tend to weaken the
authority of either the Governor or the head of department, strict
justice required disapproval of the Governor's action in dismissing
Rusden. Among other reasons Stanley argued that Mitchell's absence from
his duties for nearly four years accounted, in part at least, for the
inefficiency in his department.[7] The matter was ended by the resignation
of Rusden.</p>

<p>In 1843 occurred an incident, in itself trivial and a normal public
service matter, which would under all ordinary conditions have been
adjusted without friction, but which gave further indications of
Mitchell's reactions to authority and his attitude in respect of the
responsibilities of his office. Gipps advised Stanley (26 April 1843)
that the Auditor General had reported that a total sum of more than
&pound;43,000, being advances made to various officers of the Government
for the service of their departments, had not been finally brought to
account.[8] These advances were for the most part of recent date and
easily adjusted: but some were of long standing, amongst them a total of
&pound;513 which had remained unadjusted in the Surveyor General's
Department since 1836.</p>

</center>

<p><a name="cc"></a>Bearing in mind that Mitchell had been away from his
office for almost the whole of the intervening period it is clear that
his direct personal responsibility might well have been small. He was
called upon formally to adjust this account, but a tedious and
inconclusive correspondence followed, until, at the end of three months,
Gipps ordered that Mitchell's salary should be withheld. This brought the
discussion to a crisis, and, explanations and details of the matters in
dispute having been provided, Mitchell's salary was restored after a
suspension of only fourteen days. He, however, was not prepared to accept
this as a routine public service enquiry, was very indignant, and sent
through Gipps a memorial, with covering letter, to Stanley. In the
memorial he pointed out that for about eight years he had had a double
responsibility as Surveyor General and as the officer in charge of
construction and maintenance of the roads, bridges, and public works of
the colony; that the latter responsibility was now held by an officer
with total emoluments of &pound;650 per annum; and he requested that he
be paid at that rate for the eight years during which he had held the
dual position. In the covering letter he said that the memorial and the
claim were not,</p>

<blockquote>as may at first seem, submitted only because of a
disallowance by the present Governor of my salary as Surveyor
General.</blockquote>

<p>and he made this general comment:</p>

<blockquote>The difficulties of my position have been such, in carrying
various plans of public works into effect, that my personal interests
here, as far as they depended on the favour of Governors, have been
wholly sacrificed; but it may be sufficient, perhaps for the present, to
state in general terms to Your Lordship that the more I have laboured to
fulfil with exactness the views of the Government at home, the less it
has seemed to be my good fortune to please the Governors of the
Colony.[9]</blockquote>

<p>Gipps' comments in his covering despatch (26 April 1843) were:</p>

<blockquote>The duty of superintending the formation of roads and bridges
was clearly at the time a part of the business of the Surveyor General,
though he was, and I think very properly, relieved from it under the
Government of my Predecessor in 1836...I can have no desire to underrate
the services rendered by Sir Thomas Mitchell to this colony; but, without
doing so, I may observe that there is no officer of this Government who
has less reason to complain of any want of indulgence from it. He has
been allowed to publish in his own name, and for his own advantage,
surveys performed by the Department, of which he is at the head, as well
as the narration of his own travels, performed at the public expense; he
has received some valuable grants of land, and very recently a gratuity
of about &pound;1,000 in money; and, between 1837 and 1842, he enjoyed
leave of absence for an uninterrupted period of more than four
years.[10]</blockquote>

<p>The claim by Mitchell for eight years' salary at &pound;650 per annum
for having acted as Superintendent of Roads and Bridges was summarily
dismissed by Stanley:</p>

<blockquote>The claim for past salary cannot be admitted. If Sir Thomas
Mitchell was underpaid during the period in respect of which this demand
is now advanced, he should then have called for higher remuneration.
Having however from year to year accepted his salary in satisfaction of
his claims, he is debarred by his own act from maintaining that they are
unsatisfied.[11]</blockquote>

<p>Stephen was still at the head of the Colonial Office, and Mitchell
received less sympathetic treatment than Hay had given him.</p>

<p>During the years 1841 and 1842 there had been a serious financial
crisis in the colony through over-speculation in land. One result of this
was that Gipps advised Stanley (13 June 1843) that the almost total
cessation of a demand for Crown land in the colony had forced him to
reduce greatly the expenses of the Surveyor General's Department.[12]</p>

<p>Then came another crisis. The Legislative Council decided to abolish
the estimates of the Surveyor General's Department as a separate item,
and to vote nothing for that service, declaring that all expenses of that
department should be met from the funds derived from the sale of Crown
lands.[13] This was a most embarrassing decision at a time when the sale
of Crown lands had almost ceased. Gipps advised Stanley (21 October 1843)
of this position and said that he had reduced the expenditure on the
department from &pound;26,384 to &pound;15,000:[14] but four months later
(13 February 1844) advised that the most he could provide from available
sources was &pound;12,000, and he proposed to keep the expenses of the
department within that sum, at the same time keeping faith with the
departmental officers, and not allowing the progress of the survey to be
altogether arrested.[15] He arranged that some of the surveyors should
cease to be full-time salaried officers, and should become licensed
surveyors, receiving one-third salary from the Government, and doing
private work on an approved scale of fees, their findings on private work
being accepted as official. They were also to act as Crown Land
Commissioners.[16] Mitchell tried to place these displaced officers in
districts where there was good prospect of private work, but this
arrangement did not pass without protests from some of them.[17]</p>

<p>In 1844 an incident occurred which, while it had quite serious
aspects, yet had a mildly humorous side. In 1824, a Legislative Council
had been established in New South Wales consisting of the Governor, four
senior Government officials, and one civilian appointed by the Governor.
In response to repeated agitation for a greater measure of
self-government in New South Wales the Constitution Act of 1842 was
passed by the Imperial Parliament. Under this Act a Legislative Council
was established consisting of twelve nominee members, and twenty-four
members to be elected. Six of these twenty-four were to represent Port
Phillip and to be elected by the residents of that district. Gipps
advised Stanley (18 July 1843) of the results of the first election. At
this election Mitchell had been one of the candidates for the Port
Phillip district; but he had not been elected: one Government official,
Roger Therry, Commissioner of Court of Requests, had been elected for a
New South Wales district.[18]</p>

<p>Public opinion in Port Phillip was against Mitchell's election for
three reasons, that as a Government officer his first loyalty was to the
Government, that his importance as Surveyor General would be greatly
diminished if Victoria became a separate colony, and that he was "silent
as the grave on the subject of separation, the only subject we care about
at present".[19]</p>

<p>In February of the following year, 1844, two of the members for the
Port Phillip district resigned; and Mr A. Young (Sheriff) and Mitchell
were elected in their places at the by-election held in the following
April. Mitchell had given a</p>

<blockquote>distinct and positive pledge that, if elected, he will be the
firm and consistent advocate of the separation of this territory from New
South Wales.</blockquote>

<p>He had sent one of his sons to Port Phillip to canvass on his behalf
and to commit his father as a firm advocate of total separation. The
election in April produced the following result: Mitchell, 195; Young,
134; O'Connell, 94. Mitchell's candidature was actively supported by
Stephen Henty and by Mr McCrae, who, as recorded in the last chapter, had
migrated to Australia on Mitchell's recommendation.</p>

<p>Gipps advised Stanley (26 July 1844) that there were now three
Government officials sitting in the Council as elected members, he
anticipated that these three would inevitably experience a conflict
between their divergent loyalties. He said that</p>

<blockquote>the Surveyor General has (and I may say systematically)
opposed himself to the views of Her Majesty's Government in respect to
the administration of the lands of the Crown.[20]</blockquote>

<p>One month later (18 August 1844) Gipps again advised Stanley that
Mitchell had "failed to give his support to the Government on the
question respecting District Councils". He had therefore had a personal
interview with Mitchell, and told him of the report sent to Stanley,
and:</p>

<blockquote>I told him at the same time that the undisguised hostility,
which he manifested at all times not only to my own measures, but to
those of Her Majesty's Government, and even to the enactments of
Parliament, in matters connected with the administration of the lands of
the Crown, was in my opinion inconsistent with his duty as an officer of
the Government, and might even endanger his situation, since, unless Her
Majesty's Government were disposed to give up all the control over the
Crown lands, it was most necessary that the office of Surveyor General
should be held by a person who would adopt and carry out the policy of
government in respect to the management of them.</blockquote>

<p>He added that Sir Thomas Mitchell had now resigned his seat on the
Legislative Council; he had been a member for only four months. The
correspondence on this subject is included verbatim in this volume as <a
href="#appc">Appendix C</a>.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that this change in the status of Government
officers from holding their positions in the Council at the will of the
Governor to that of holding their seats as freely elected members
independent of the Governor should, sooner or later, raise the issue of
the measure of that independence, and of the direction of their duty when
their loyalties were irreconcilable. The question had quickly arisen in
respect of both Mitchell and Young. Stanley ultimately settled the issue
by a decision in which it is not difficult to see the influence and even
the style of Stephen. Stanley's decision (1 January 1845) was to the
effect that he regarded as very doubtful the propriety of any public
officer of the Crown holding a seat in the Legislative Council except by
Her Majesty's nomination: and that Gipps was to tell Mitchell and Young
that they must immediately make the choice between neglecting their duty
to their constituents and their duty to the Government.</p>

<blockquote>If Her Majesty's officers think fit to assume relations and
responsibilities disqualifying them for the support of Her Majesty's
Representative, they are of course perfectly free to do so, but, having
done so, cannot be permitted to retain their employment. Otherwise there
would not only be an end of all concert and subordination in Her
Majesty's service, but the sincerity and good faith of those by whom it
is administered would be brought into serious discredit?[21]</blockquote>

<p>This, however, was in conflict with Stanley's expressed views three
years before that:</p>

<blockquote>There is no restriction as to the numbers of such officers
who may hold seats in the Council by election...it will of course be
desirable that some of the officers of Government should owe their seats
to popular election.[22]</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell had already resigned, but Therry and Young continued in the
Council: perhaps their official duties did not directly involve
controversial issues.[23]</p>

<p>What were the controversial issues which so sharply brought Mitchell's
position under discussion? From Gipps' letter to Stanley (18 August 1844)
the main issues were: (a) Mitchell's undisguised hostility to the
Government in matters connected with the administration of the lands of
the Crown, and (b) his failure to support the Government on the
legislation respecting District Councils. In support of these accusations
Gipps cited Mitchell's evidence before the Select Committee of the
Legislative Council on Crown Land Grievances in 1843.[24]</p>

<p>When declaring his disagreement with certain aspects of the land
policies of Bourke and Gipps, Mitchell had said:</p>

<blockquote>I would rather see the system revived under which I have
worked for many years: the systematic colonization under the Royal
instructions of 1825.[25]</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell was still invoking the "Royal instructions", ignoring the
fact that both Bourke and Gipps had been working under Royal instructions
replacing those of 1825.</p>

<p>These matters, as they form the basis of Gipps' complaint against
Mitchell as an elected member, should be examined. No other ground for
complaint was offered. The evidence given before the Committee in 1843
related to the disposal of Crown lands. The Ripon Regulations of 1831 had
abolished the system of free grants of land, substituting sale by auction
at a minimum price of five shillings per acre; and the Wakefield system
had been adopted to the extent that the money obtained by the sale of
Crown lands was devoted to the purpose of bringing immigrants to New
South Wales. The Parliament in England had passed an Act, the Crown Lands
Act of 1842, which enacted that no government land should be sold which
was not worth &pound;1 per acre. The object had been to prevent
speculation in low-grade land which had been largely responsible for the
financial crisis of that period. The Legislative Council had appointed a
Select Committee to consider the effect of this Act in New South Wales,
and on 20 December 1843 had presented an address to Gipps based on the
recommendations of this Committee.</p>

<p>This address entirely disapproved of the upset price of &pound;1 per
acre prescribed by the Act, condemned the system of applying the revenues
obtained by the sale of Crown lands to the purposes of immigration, and
recommended a quite different system. Mitchell, giving evidence before
this Select Committee, had stated his opinion, as already quoted, that
the old system of free grants should be re-established. He was not then a
member of the Legislative Council but a responsible executive official,
and was not only free, but it was his duty, to give his honest opinion to
a responsible parliamentary committee in a matter of policy which was
peculiarly that of his own department. Gipps, in an official despatch,
expressed his view that for the low-grade Crown lands outside nineteen
counties the system of squatting with payment of annual licence fee, was
the most satisfactory.[26] This system was adopted later.</p>

<p>The other question was that of District Councils, and the charge
against Mitchell was that he failed to give his support to the Government
on an occasion when the question before the Council was, whether the Act
passed by the Imperial Parliament for the government of the colony should
be obeyed or disobeyed. This is an interesting story as it relates to the
introduction of local government in Australia. Before 1835 no land was
granted or sold beyond the boundaries of location--the nineteen
counties--and no police protection or system of government was
provided.[27] But the discoveries of Sturt and Mitchell, together with
the enterprise of Henty and Batman, had forced a complete review of this
position. Bourke had pointed out the necessity for Government policy to
be adapted to the rapidly spreading pastoral activities, and Glenelg had
replied:</p>

<blockquote>All that remains for the Government in such circumstances is
to assume the guidance and direction of enterprises, which, tho' it
cannot prevent or retard, it may yet conduct to happy
results.[28]</blockquote>

<p>After various devices had been tried, including a levy per capita on
live-stock for the maintenance of border police, and unsuccessful
attempts by Gipps to induce the Legislative Council to pass laws imposing
local rates, the matter was brought to a critical issue in 1842 by the
Imperial Parliament passing an Act which, inter alia, provided for the
establishment of District Councils. This Act was proclaimed in Sydney on
5 January 1843, and thus became law. Gipps, as was his duty, proceeded to
apply the Act and create districts with councils.[29] This precipitated a
crisis which might have been avoided if progress had been allowed to
proceed more slowly. The Legislative Council during July and August 1844
adopted a firm stand against those clauses of the Act relating to
District Councils and asked Gipps to make representations to the
Secretary of State for the Colonies for the amendment of these
clauses.</p>

<p>It was precisely during the short period of Mitchell's elected
membership of the Legislative Council that this crisis occurred. He was
quite a new member when this critical issue was decided in the
Legislative Council, by vote, against the Government. Mitchell and Young
absented themselves from the discussion on this Bill. Gipps' comment
was:</p>

<blockquote>Sir Thomas Mitchell and Mr Adolphus Young should, I have no
doubt, have voted against the Government, had they not thought it
imprudent to do so.[30]</blockquote>

<p>It has to be added that later (30 January 1846) Gipps, by inference,
admitted that the refusal of the Legislative Council to accept the
objectionable clauses was well founded:[31] and this difficult question
was not properly settled until the introduction in 1855-6 of full
self-government in New South Wales. On the evidence it is difficult to
find justification for Gipps' action. Mitchell, within a short time after
his election, was called upon to make a critical decision in a very
contentious field, and, as most men would do, he refrained from voting.
For Gipps to link this with evidence properly given before the Select
Committee of the Council, as reasons for censuring his actions within
Parliament, was an act, taken by itself, of injustice. It is difficult to
avoid the impression that Gipps' action was taken against a general
background of dissatisfaction with Mitchell in his official duties.
Certainly there is something ludicrous in Gipps' dictum that</p>

<blockquote>the Member for Port Phillip may act as he pleases, but the
Surveyor General of New South Wales must both obey and support the
Government.[32]</blockquote>

<p>It was, however, wise for Mitchell to escape from his invidious
position by resigning.</p>

<p>Merivale, who later succeeded Stephen as Permanent Under-Secretary at
the Colonial Office, writing of this crisis long afterward made this
comment:</p>

<blockquote>District Councils for New South Wales were created in 1842 by
Act of Parliament. It must be admitted that the experiment was premature:
a pastoral country, of wide extent and thinly inhabited, is ill
calculated for the frequent meeting of local boards. The Act remained a
dead letter. When the constitution of the colony was amended under Lord
Grey's administration in 1849, his Lordship considered it best to content
himself with authorizing their creation by the local legislature: holding
out at the same time the inducement of intrusting to those bodies a
portion of Crown Lands revenue. The suggestion and the bribe remained as
ineffectual as the enactment had been. The legislature would not stir an
inch in that direction.[33]</blockquote>

<p>Upon his return from England Mitchell must have sold his house
"Craigend", which obviously had not been sold at auction in 1837, for it
was advertised for sale by auction in the <i>Australian</i> of 11
September 1841.</p>

<p>His son Livingstone had been moved from India and was, in 1841, with
the 96th Regiment at Norfolk Island.[34]</p>

<p>Mitchell now proceeded to build a country residence on his property
"Parkhall" near Appin. The foundation stone was laid, with some ceremony,
on 16 April 1842. In a cavity in the foundation stone was enclosed a
parchment on which was written, in Latin, an inscription of which the
following is a translation:</p>

<blockquote>Thomas Livingstone Mitchell, Honorary Doctor of Civil Law in
the University of Oxford, accompanied by Charles Nicholson, Doctor of
Medicine in the year of grace 1842, and in the reign of Queen Victoria,
laid the foundation stone of this house in a land now almost divided from
the world but which may one day equal in all the arts of civilization the
illustrious regions of his native country.</blockquote>

<p>The house (<a href="#p10">Plate X</a>) was built to a plan prepared by
.the architect who had designed Sir Walter Scott's home, and it was
modelled on "Parkhall", the home in Scotland of Mitchell's uncle.
Mitchell had brought the plans with him from England. It was built
entirely by free, not convict, labour: the building operations were
supervised by a Mr Merrick and his son, who received sixty pounds per
annum as payment: the workmen were paid forty pounds per annum with
rations. While the building was slowly advancing the improvement of the
land was not neglected. A start was made on the cultivation of hay and
vines, and on the Wilton side of the property several small farms were
cleared and rented. By 1845 the building was finished, and on 17 February
of that year the family moved there from Sydney.</p>

<p>It must have been at some time during this period that, having sold
"Craigend", Mitchell built his fine home "Carthona" on the water-front on
Darling Point. He had, therefore, during the rest of his life two
attractive residences, "Carthona" in town, and "Parkhall" in the
country.</p>

<p>Livingstone Mitchell must have left the army and joined the family, as
Mitchell, writing to his son Roderick (12 March 1846), remarks: "Livy
promises good strong wine at Parkhall."[35]</p>

<p>Roderick, the second son, had qualified at Durham University as a
civil engineer and was appointed a Commissioner of Crown Lands in New
South Wales on 23 August 1843. He was engaged soon after in surveying,
and appraising, the country north of the Darling in the Culgoa River
region.[36]</p>

<p>The colony of South Australia had been founded in 1836: exploration of
the interior districts had been only spasmodic until Hawdon, Bonney,
Eyre, and Sturt had brought cattle overland from New South Wales and
Victoria. By these journeys interest in a wider horizon had been
stimulated, and, in 1839, Eyre began a series of exploratory journeys to
the north and west. To the north he succeeded in reaching the great chain
of interior salt lakes which he named Lake Torrens; he was, in this
region, repelled by the waterless nature of the country.</p>

<p>When news of this journey reached Sydney, Mitchell, writing to General
Murray (12 February 1841), commented:</p>

<blockquote>An important, but by no means gratifying discovery has been
made in the interior by a party led northward from Adelaide by a Mr Eyre.
The high land at the head of Spencer Gulf was found to decline gradually
to the northward until it terminated on what seemed the bed of a vast
lake or inland sea--two arms of which trending northward appeared to
unite about the 29th parallel of latitude, probably to form the head of
some inland water which may extend towards the Gulf of Carpentaria...the
prospects to the colonists of South Australia by this discovery are by no
means brightened.<br>
<br>
A very small channel or watercourse containing some salt water connects
the head of St. Vincent Gulf with this inland basin.[37]</blockquote>

<h2><a name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII - The fourth expedition</h2>

<p>In 1843 Gipps wrote to Stanley (7 December 1843) that a committee of
the Legislative Council had been appointed to enquire into the
practicability of a design for an overland route to Port Essington.[1]
According to Lang there was a vague hope that good country might be
discovered in that direction. Gipps stated that both Sturt and Eyre had
offered to undertake the task: as, however, the expense was estimated at
between &pound;4,000 and &pound;5,000, the project had been, for the time
at least, abandoned. He went on to say that Mitchell not only considered
the project practicable but was himself ready to lead the
expedition.[2]</p>

<p>Gipps, writing again to Stanley (24 October 1844), said:</p>

<blockquote>I repeat that in the event of an expedition being undertaken
to Port Essington, I apprehend Sir Thomas Mitchell will claim (as indeed
he has already claimed) the honour of conducting it.<br>
<br>
A small private expedition is now on the point of starting from Moreton
Bay to Port Essington direct. Dr Leichhardt is, I believe, a physician, a
German by birth, and a man of considerable scientific
attainments.[3]</blockquote>

<p>In February 1844 Mitchell had been forced to reduce his departmental
expenditure by more than half--from &pound;26,384 to &pound;12,000--and
his staff correspondingly (Gipps himself had admitted that the reduction
was "an immense one") and, in August 1844, he had been forced, under
rebuke, to resign his seat in the Legislative Council.[4] It is hardly
surprising that, restless, he turned again to that field in which he had
gained great glory, and claimed the honour of leading the expedition
overland to Port Essington.</p>

<p>Sturt and Eyre had proposed that they should start from Moreton Bay
(Brisbane), follow the coast to Halifax Bay (Townsville), where they
would be met with a ship carrying supplies: thence overland to the Gulf
of Carpentaria where the same ship would meet them: and, from there,
overland to Port Essington.[5] Gipps considered this a more feasible
route than one directly overland from Sydney to Port Essington--which had
been the route recommended by the Legislative Council Committee. But, as
already stated, he considered the project to be too expensive. Stanley in
reply to Gipps (12 May 1844) approved of the expedition as soon as the
funds of the colony could properly bear the expense: as to the route,
Stanley said that it appeared to him that there was much force in the
argument in favour of the less hazardous though more expensive expedition
by way of the sea coast.[6]</p>

<p>Gipps may have received this approval by Stanley as early as September
1844, but he delayed until November 1845. He then advised Stanley (11
November 1845) that improvement in the public revenue justified the
expense and he had fitted out an expedition to proceed overland by way of
Bathurst and Fort Bourke and thence either direct to Port Essington, or
to the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria at Mitchell's discretion.</p>

<blockquote>It being the wish of the majority of the Legislative Council,
as well as of Sir Thomas Mitchell, that the shorter or direct course
should be adopted, rather than the more circuitous one by Halifax Bay, I
have not thought it right to oppose myself to their
wishes.[7]</blockquote>

<p>Sturt wrote a personal letter to King (5 December 1843) about the
project, in which he said:</p>

<blockquote>The conclusions at which the Committee of the Legislative
Council has arrived are in my judgment erroneous, and I think it is to be
regretted they did not refer to you or Hume for better information than
they would probably obtain from Sir Thomas Mitchell, whose opinions I
assure you I hold in the most sovereign contempt.[8]</blockquote>

<p>This project of an overland route to the settlement at Port Essington
had been under discussion for several years. Captain J. L. Stokes
recorded, relative to his visit to Sydney in 1842 when in command of
H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i>:</p>

<blockquote>The most interesting topic of conversation on our arrival in
Sydney was the projected expedition into the interior. Two candidates for
this important and deeply interesting undertaking had presented
themselves--Mr E. J. Eyre and Sir Thomas Mitchell--both experienced
Australian explorers. The latter proposed to start from Fort Bourke on
the Darling, and the former from Moreton Bay. In my humble opinion,
strengthened by recent experience, neither of these are practicable
routes, or at any rate they are not the best that could be
selected.[9]</blockquote>

<p>Leichhardt had become interested in this proposal, had formed a
private expedition, and started from Sydney in August 1844: but as no
news came from him there was in Sydney, even until March 1846, a
persistent belief that he and his whole party had been killed by
aborigines. Two search parties had returned with confirmatory
reports.</p>

<p>In Mitchell's own account of his expedition, published in 1848, he
gives his version of the preliminary discussion concerning this
expedition, which differs in some details from the official statements.
Mitchell says that Gipps, in one of his early despatches to the British
Government, expressed his readiness to encourage an expedition, and
stated that "no one came forward to claim the honour of such an
enterprise".[10] This is a reference to a despatch from Gipps to the
Colonial Office (28 September 1840) in which he said:</p>

<blockquote>I have frequently expressed my willingness to encourage an
attempt to penetrate either from Moreton Bay or any of the northern parts
of the colony to Port Essington but hitherto no person has presented
himself to claim the honour of that enterprise.[11]</blockquote>

<p>But, while this was true in 1840, it is equally true that both Sturt
and Eyre had, in 1843, volunteered to lead such an expedition, and Gipps
had in 1843 (7 December) reaffirmed his wish to promote this
enterprise.</p>

<blockquote>That an attempt should be made to reach Port Essington by an
overland route is, I think, most desirable; and it has long been a matter
of regret to me that I have not as yet found myself in a condition to
undertake one.[12]</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell must have known all this when he wrote his book and there can
be little doubt that, in writing the passage in the way he did, he was
not telling the whole truth.</p>

<p>This was a time of great financial depression in New South Wales and
Gipps' hesitancy was natural. He may have had other reasons, for he wrote
to Secretary of State Gladstone on 23 June 1846,[13] while Mitchell was
actually away, that the expedition was one which he had never
approved.*</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* There is here an obvious inconsistency with his
statement three years earlier that he had frequently expressed his
willingness to encourage such an expedition; but it is probable that his
disapproval applied to the expedition taking this particular
route.]</blockquote>

<p>In his preference for the overland route Mitchell was still possessed
by the idea of a large river flowing northward to discharge into the Gulf
of Carpentaria--"the ultimate course of the Condamine was still a
question".[14] He referred to his 1831 journey, and the statements of
Clarke the bushranger, and it might seem from his references to this that
he was prepared to overlook his own earlier statements that he had shown
this story of Clarke's to be false: his attitude was that it was very
desirable that a way should be opened to the shores of the Indian Ocean
which was already connected with England by steam navigation: a trade in
horses with India had in fact already begun.</p>

<p>Mitchell records that he had, in 1844, told Leichhardt all his plans
and invited him to join the expedition. But it is interesting to read
Leichhardt's comment on his safe return to Sydney: "I thought the whole
town would go mad with joy. Even the family of Sir Thomas Mitchell are
treating me with justice";[15] as Mitchell had previously invited
Leichhardt to join his own expedition there was no reason why Mitchell's
family should not treat him well other than a natural regret that he had
anticipated Mitchell in important discoveries.</p>

<p>The sum of &pound;2,000 was allocated for the expedition, Mitchell and
Kennedy--his second in command--both receiving their full Government
salaries during their absence.</p>

<p>During November Mitchell had been busy with long memoranda to the
Governor on the subject of the survey of lands in the colony. Gipps had
written on these papers:</p>

<blockquote>Inform the Surveyor General that I see no reason to forward
to the Secretary of State a copy of his voluminous and very uncalled for
report of 22 November. I am surprised to find Sir Thomas Mitchell still
in Sydney instead of being with the exploratory expedition which left
Parramatta above three weeks ago and which is already beyond Bathurst. I
must decline any further correspondence with Sir Thomas Mitchell unless
it be on the subject of the expedition.[16]</blockquote>

<p>FROM SYDNEY TO ST. GEORGE (14 November 1845 to 1 April 1846)</p>

<p>The party for this expedition included, beside Mitchell himself,
Assistant Surveyor E. B. Kennedy, W. Stephenson as surgeon and natural
history collector, Mitchell's faithful servant Anthony Brown, one
soldier, two civilians, and twenty-three convicts. 01 all the party only
Anthony Brown and W. Baldock had been on previous expeditions with
Mitchell; Baldock had been on the second, and Brown on all four
expeditions. The expedition was impressively equipped--there were
seventeen horses, three light carts, eight drays with 112 bullocks, and
250 sheep. Instead of standard type boats which had been taken on
previous expeditions Mitchell took two iron boats, each in two sections
which could be bolted together. These served additionally as troughs,
and, on occasions, for carrying water for the cattle.</p>

<p>In the preface to the published book describing this expedition
Mitchell expressed his feelings of pleasure at the prospect of another
journey of exploration:</p>

<blockquote>It has ever been the most attractive of the author's duties
to explore the interior of Australia. There the philosopher may look for
facts; the painter and the poet for original studies and ideas; the
naturalist for additional knowledge; and the historian might begin at a
beginning. The traveller there seeks in vain for the remains of cities,
temples, or towers; but he is amply compensated by objects that tell not
of decay but of healthful progress and hope;--of a wonderful past and a
promising future.<br>
<br>
Curiosity alone may attract us into the mysterious recesses of regions
still unknown; but a still deeper interest attaches to those regions, now
that the rapid increase of the most industrious and, may we add, most
deserving people on earth, suggests that the land there has been reserved
by the Almighty for their use.*</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* This quotation, with others in this chapter
relating to incidents occurring during this expedition, are, when not
otherwise indicated, from the text of Mitchell's published work
<i>Tropical Australia</i>.]</blockquote>

<p>The main party left Parramatta on 17 November 1845; Mitchell, leaving
Sydney on 8 December, joined the party at Boree on 13 December. Then the
whole party started northwards, or rather north-westwards, on 15 December
1845 (<a href="#m10">Map X</a>). Two points may be noted here. First, if
Mitchell had, as he vigorously advocated, taken a direct overland route
from Sydney to Port Essington, this route would pass the vicinity of
Dubbo, Bourke, Cunnamulla and Carnooweal. Mitchell was, therefore, quite
consistent in setting out from Boree along his old route to Fort Bourke.
Secondly, that two other explorers were at that time in the same field.
Leichhardt, who had left Sydney on 13 August and who was believed dead,
arrived at Port Essington actually two days after Mitchell had left
Boree. On the very day of Mitchell's departure, 15 December, Sturt was
struggling over the Barrier Range on the last lap of his weary journey
home. But Mitchell could not then know that Leichhardt on the east, and
Sturt on the west, had forestalled him to an important degree, and robbed
hi's enterprise of much of the credit of priority.</p>

<p>At Boree an aborigine, Yuranigh, had joined the party; he remained
with them throughout the expedition, and earned great praise from
Mitchell. Soon after leaving Boree a young aborigine, Dicky, also
attached himself to the expedition. On leaving Boree Mitchell had
included in the party the native Piper who had been with him all through
the third expedition. Piper, in the intervening nine years, had had a
varied experience. He had been to Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, and
Newcastle and had, as already recorded, received too much attention after
the third expedition; as will be seen later he gave trouble.</p>

<p>Mitchell kept closely to his former track across to the head waters of
the Bogan making only slight deviations. He soon became aware that, in
the interval of ten years since he had first crossed this country,
squatters had pushed out far along the Bogan. He passed through Bramadura
on Mandadgery Creek, Balderudgery, Seven-mile Creek, Goobang Creek,
Currandong, and Gananaguy, where he reached the Bogan, and then down the
Bogan to Kerr's station at Derribong. This was the limit of squatting at
that time; there had been attempts at Mudall and even Nyngan, but the
hostilities of the natives had made their holdings untenable. Mitchell
was to see the burnt ruins of the temorary buildings which had been
abandoned.</p>

<p>On 3 January they passed the scene of Cunningham's murder some
thirteen miles north-east of Tottenham, but although the grave had been
marked by Lieutenant Zouch, there is no record that Mitchell visited it.
He did, however, note in his diary that both Cunningham brothers were now
dead.</p>

<p><b>MAP X. Map showing the first part of Mitchell's fourth expedition:
the route from Boree to Narran Lake</b></p>
</center>

<p>Proceeding down the Bogan, passing Cajildry, Buddabadah, Mudall, and
Darouble, they reached Nyngan on 16 January. From Derribong to Nyngan
they had great trouble in finding water, and many delays because of the
bullocks straying at night. From Nyngan Mitchell again moved down the
Bogan to a point which he named Canbelego. This is not the place which
now has that name, but is in the vicinity of the place now shown on the
maps as Grahweed. Leaving the main party here Mitchell scouted for-, ward
in search of water to a point which is not now readily identifiable
except by Mitchell's own record that it was "near the debateable land of
Lee's old station"--perhaps in the region of Nidgery Crossing. This
reconnaissance, and the notable absence of water even in the Bogan
channel, altered Mitchell's plans: <i>I turned at length, reluctantly,
convinced that it would have been unsafe to venture with cattle and drays
into these regions before rain fell.</i></p>

<p>Three of their best cattle dogs had died from the heat. This was the
first important departure from his original plan of the direct route to
Port Essington. Back at the camp at "Canbelego" Mitchell suffered a
severe attack of ophthalmia for which he applied fourteen leeches brought
from the ponds at Nyngan.</p>

<p>After two days, his eyes having recovered, Mitchell abandoned the
Bogan, moving south-east to the Bellaringa ponds on Gunningbar Creek,
then north-east to Canonba ponds on Duck Creek. Mitchell claims that this
Gunningbar Creek was discovered by Larmer on the previous expedition, but
Hume had probably crossed it in 1829, as, indeed, he had also been on the
Bogan almost exactly at the point (Grahweed) where Mitchell left that
river. From Canonba, moving still in a direction slightly north of east,
they came to Marra Creek at Grahway--twelve miles northwest of Mt.
Foster. This had been a period of delay, for Piper had begun making
unreasonable demands, although he had been treated very favourably.
Moreover, he was a bad shot, awkward about horses, and proved useless as
an interpreter. Mitchell, therefore, sent him back under escort to the
nearest police station, and remained in camp awaiting the return of the
escort.</p>

<p>At Grahway they had re-entered settled districts, as here they met two
mounted policemen, who brought news of a flood coming down the Macquarie.
Being thus reasonably assured of water Mitchell decided to follow the
Macquarie down to its junction with the Darling. Mitchell's impressions
of the sudden arrival of the flood-waters were:</p>

<blockquote>Some hours later, and after the moon had risen, a murmuring
sound like that of a distant waterfall, mingled with occasional cracks as
of breaking timber, drew our attention, and I hastened to the river bank.
By very slow degrees the sound grew louder, and at length, so audible as
to draw various persons besides from the camp to the river-side.<br>
<br>
 Still no flood appeared, although its approach was indicated by the
occasional rending of trees with a loud noise. Such a phenomenon in a a
serene moonlight night was quite new to us all. At length the rushing
sound of waters and loud cracking of timber announced that the flood was
in the next bend. It rushed into our sight, glittering in the moonbeams,
a moving cataract, tossing before it ancient trees, and snapping them
against its banks. It was preceded by a point of meandering water,
picking its way like a thing of life, through the deepest parts of the
dark, dry, and shady bed of what thus again became a flowing river.<br>
<br>
 By my party, situated as we were at that time, beating about the
country, and impeded in our journey, solely by the almost total absence
of water--suffering excessively from thirst and extreme heat--I am
convinced the scene never can be forgotten. Here came at once abundance,
the product of storms in the far-off mountains that overlooked our homes.
My first impulse was to have welcomed this flood on our knees, for the
scene was sublime in itself, while the subject--an abundance of water
sent to us in a desert--greatly heightened the effect to our eyes.
Suffice it to say I had witnessed nothing of such interest in all my
Australian travels.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell now proceeded northwards along the western edge of the
Macquarie marshes. The bullocks were greatly troubled by the softness of
the soil and Mitchell was worried that</p>

<blockquote>the weather might change, and these marshes become
impassable; indeed, we were as much at the mercy of Providence in this
respect as the Israelites were in the bed of the Red Sea. It depended on
the weather whether we should deserve to be considered Jews or
Egyptians.</blockquote>

<p>The journey from their camp at Grahway to the Darling (Bar-won)
occupied sixteen days, some delay being caused by trouble with missing
bullocks and a recurrence of Mitchell's ophthalmia. They had reached the
Darling at the junction of the Macquarie, where Mr Parnell had
established a station. There was another station seventy-five miles down
the Darling, evidence of the rapid spread of settlement since Sturt had
discovered this region sixteen years, and since Mitchell's own visit
further upstream fifteen years, previously.</p>

<p>During this section of the journey the boy Dicky began to show his
value:</p>

<blockquote>One only of the two lost bullocks was found, and for this one
we were indebted to little Dicky, a native only ten years of age, whom
the big fool who had lost them was at some trouble to coax to go and
assist him in the search.</blockquote>

<p>When they reached the Darling Mitchell learned that his son,
Commissioner Roderick Mitchell, had recently passed down the river
charting the stations. Also he learned from the natives that the Rivers
Balonne (Bolloon), Culgoa, Biree, and Narran to the north were flowing;
and here he received despatches from his son Roderick giving account of
the district ahead of them, and a map showing the rivers even as far as
the Bokhara.</p>

<p>From Palmer's station at Wyabry, a few miles downstream from Boorooma,
Mitchell wrote a letter to his son Livingstone in Sydney, in which he
said (4 March 1846):</p>

<blockquote>Mind! I have written no account of my movements to any Sydney
friends lest by notices in the papers Sturt may be enlightened too
soon.[17]</blockquote>

<p>Sturt had been back in Adelaide since 17 January.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine the considerations which moved Mitchell to
write in those terms. Sturt had then been away from Adelaide for eighteen
months: there had been ample time for the despatches sent back by Sturt
from Preservation Creek to have reached Adelaide and for Mitchell to have
heard of them in Sydney. From this source he may have learned that Sturt
had set off to the north, and he may have feared that Sturt would be
moving along a line that would cross his own route. But it is difficult
to understand how he imagined that Sturt, cut off from all communication,
would learn of his movements. It can at least be accepted as an
indication of the attitude towards Sturt which he always maintained.</p>

<p>Leaving Parnell's station on 5 March, he proceeded northwards, guided
by some natives, to Narran Lagoon, and then followed the Narran River
closely, round the bend at Angledool, and over the Queensland border at
Pratt's Gate (<a href="#m11">Map XI</a>). At the eastern end of Angledool
bend (Yeranbah) he found traces of horses and looked for his son's
initials on the trees--evidence that he was still in country that had
been visited before. In this vicinity Mitchell found specimens of
Enchylaena tomentosa which was, possibly, the same species of berry which
had rapidly relieved Sturt's scurvy near the Barrier Range three months
before.[18]</p>

<p>At this point in his journey he wrote to his other son Roderick (12
March 1846) a letter in which he said:</p>

<blockquote>My progress should have presented a brilliant contrast to
that of Sturt had I not been so weak as to have altered my own original
plan to please a wooden-headed ass. I could not have been in my right
senses when last in Sydney. I would purchase myself, if I could find them
near, three or four pairs of draught horses and harness and make light
carts here for a vigorous push to the northwards. I think I know by the
strike of the rocks all about this basin of the Darling, where and how
the northern waters are to be found and beyond. But I am unwilling to
give any of my views to the public at this stage of the
journey.[19]</blockquote>

<p>The party arrived at the junction of the Balonne with the Narran
(Dirranbandi) on 1 April, twenty-six days from the Darling. Here, which
Mitchell assumed to be the point visited by his son, they found trees
marked "J. Towns" and "Bagot". Up to this point, then, priority was
denied to Mitchell--indeed, his son could, as Mitchell admitted, claim to
be the discoverer of this region. Still proceeding up the Narran--now
become the Balonne--and making a detour to the west to cross the Culgoa
junction at seven miles from the Balonne junction, the party passed the
Burrawurra Lagoon, and the Parachute Lagoon, arriving at St. George on 12
April.</p>

<p><b>MAP XI. Map showing the journey from Narran Lake to Mt. Bindango,
and part of the return journey, on Mitchell's fourth expedition</b></p>
</center>

<p>On this section of the journey the natives had been quite friendly.
Speaking of one of them, who had guided them over one section of the
journey, Mitchell said:</p>

<blockquote>Nothing could have been finer than this man's conduct. He had
at once come on with us to guide us where we wanted to go; took great
pains to make us known to his own tribe, and, I believe, to other
assembled tribes at some risk to himself; and, then, without claiming my
promised gifts, he had returned to his little family, only that he might
do that which was civil to us strangers. Yet we call these men savages! I
fear such disinterested acts of civility on the part of the civilized
portion of mankind are rather rare.</blockquote>

<p>And of another aboriginal guide a little later on he said that he had
never seen a Spanish or Portuguese go with a detachment half so
willingly.</p>

<p>Mitchell was now having further trouble with the bullocks.</p>

<blockquote>Another bullock died on the way, and thus I felt, when the
field of discovery lay open before me, that my means of conveyance were
unsuited to this task.<br>
<br>
Overloading at Buree, unskilful driving, excessive heat, and want of
water, had contributed to render the bullocks unserviceable.</blockquote>

<p>From the Darling to St. George had been through well watered country
with luxuriant pasture: these favourable conditions had influenced
Mitchell to his decision to establish a base camp at St. George, and
himself, with a lighter party, to push on more quickly. He intended to go
in a north-westerly direction</p>

<blockquote>where centred all my hopes of discovery. I formed my party of
infantry rather than cavalry, taking only two horses, drawing a cart
loaded chiefly with water, and six trusty men, almost all old
soldiers.</blockquote>

<p>He had started off on this forward journey on 16 April, but on 18
April he was overtaken by two men from the St. George base camp with
despatches which had arrived there. The occasion</p>

<p>was a little dramatic.</p>

<blockquote>They were two of our party come from the depot to bring me a
despatch which had been forwarded by Commissioner Wright, communicating
the news of Dr Leichhardt's return from Port Essington, and enclosing the
Gazette with his own account of his journey. Thus it became known to us
that we could no longer hope to be the first to reach the shore of the
Indian Ocean by land.</blockquote>

<p>FROM ST. GEORGE TO THE SECOND DEPOT (23 April to 1 June 1846)</p>

<p>In accordance with his altered plans he left the main party at St.
George for three weeks with Kennedy in charge so that the cattle might
rest while he, with eight men and two natives, went forward with horses
and light carts carrying ten weeks' provisions.</p>

<blockquote>I determined, if possible, to penetrate northward, into the
interior country, and ascertain where the division of the waters was
likely to be found. I intended, with this view, to trace upwards the
course of the Balonne, until I found mountains to the north-westward of
it; then to endeavour to turn them by the west, and thus acquire some
knowledge on that most interesting point, the watershed towards the
Gulf.</blockquote>

<p>Kennedy was instructed to follow Mitchell's tracks after three
weeks.</p>

<p>The advance party started on 23 April, moving northward along the west
bank of the Balonne, making a slight detour to the west at Burgurrah to
cross the Maranoa. Reaching the junction of the Balonne and the Cogoon,
half-way between Donga and Surat, they turned north-westward along the
latter river. Reaching Mt. First View (3 May) Mitchell, very prematurely,
recorded these impressions:</p>

<blockquote>From the crest I perceived woolly ridges on all sides: but
the most interesting sight to me then, was that of blue pics* at a great
distance to the north-west, the object of all my dreams of discovery for
years. No white man had before seen these. There we might hope to find
the <i>divisa aquarum</i> still undiscovered, the pass to Carpentaria
still unexplored.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* Mitchell frequently used this word instead of
"peaks".]</blockquote>

<p>Still following the Cogoon they passed Mt. Inviting and Red Peak,
crossed Frosty Creek, and came to the western side of Mt. Abundance.
Riding out from here towards Bindango, and ascending part of Mt.
Abundance, he "beheld the finest country I had ever seen in a primeval
state. I determined to name the whole country Fitzroy Downs".</p>

<p>This is an interesting example of post hoc record as he could not have
known when he made this ostensible entry in his diary that Fitzroy was to
be Governor of New South Wales. At this point Mitchell sighted and named
the Grafton Range to the north-east of Roma.</p>

<p>After reaching Mt. Bindango, which he ascended, Mitchell turned to the
north-west crossing over to the Maranoa watershed--on this section he
would pass close to Wooroonga (<a href="#m12">Map XII</a>). Thence he
followed the Maranoa upwards between the Denham and Chesterton Ranges,
having changed his direction from northwest to north in the region of
Donnybrook. At this point he made a short journey to Mt. Lonsdale. This
is broken country and Mitchell had some difficulty in deciding which
course to take next. The locality is, approximately, thirty miles
south-east of Mt. Elliot, on the Maranoa about the junction of Eastern
Creek. Kennedy overtook them at this point, and Mitchell decided to form
the second base camp here.</p>

<p>This section of the journey had occupied from 23 April to 1 June;
during the passage through this region there had been several threatening
approaches by the natives, but no actual conflict. Kennedy had brought
forward some despatches and newspapers from Sydney which had overtaken
the party at St. George. In the newspapers Mitchell read:</p>

<blockquote>Australia Felix and the discoveries of Sir Thomas Mitchell
now dwindle into comparative insignificance. We understand the intrepid
Dr Leichhardt is about to start another expedition to the Gulf, keeping
to the westward of the coast ranges.</blockquote>

<p>As this was precisely what Mitchell himself was at that time doing,
his comment was certainly restrained. "Not very encouraging to us,
certainly, but we work for the future."</p>

<p>After instructing Kennedy to build a stockyard and to make a fenced
garden for growing vegetables, Mitchell, again with a light party,
started on the next section of his journey.</p>

<blockquote>I bade Mr Kennedy adieu for at least four months, and crossed
the Maranoa with my party and light carts. It was not without very much
regret that I thus left this zealous assistant, and so large a portion of
my men, behind, in departing on a hazardous enterprise as this was likely
to be, where the population might be numerous. Anxiety for the safety of
the party left predominated with me, for whatever might be the danger of
passing and repassing through these dangerous regions, that of a party
stationary for a length of time in one place seemed greater, as they were
more likely to be assailed by assembled numbers, and more exposed to'
their cunning and treachery. I gave to Mr Kennedy the best advice I
could, and we parted in the hope of a happy meeting at the period of my
return--a hope, I must confess, I could not indulge in then with any
degree of pleasure, looking forward to the many difficulties we were
prepared to encounter, and considering the state of my own
health.</blockquote>

<p>FROM THE SECOND DEPOT TO THE NORTH (4 June to 8 September 1846)</p>

<p>Mitchell proceeded with his light party, to which had been added Mr
Stephenson and a shepherd, as he was taking some of the sheep for food.
Moving northwards along the Maranoa he crossed Possession Creek coming
from the slopes of Mt. Elliot. He then made an attempt to push to the
north-west, but after three days returned, convinced that he could not
make much progress in this direction. Much later, in the light of the
knowledge gained on his journey to the Barcoo, he realized that, if he
had only continued for another ten miles, he would have come to the head
waters of the Warrego, and have found a well-watered line direct to the
Barcoo. He had made a critical and unfortunate decision: later he
instructed Kennedy (see <a href="#dd">later</a>) to follow this
route.</p>

<p>Returning then to the Maranoa, he continued his journey northwards
along that river, and came to Mt. Owen, which he ascended. From its
summit he saw Mts. Clift, Ogilvie, Faraday--all of which he named. He was
now among a tangle of peaks of the Chesterton Range which together formed
the head waters of the Maranoa on the east, and the Warrego on the west.
After scouting around this region for seven days Mitchell decided to move
forward to the west of Mt. Owen, crossing the Chesterton Range just on
the western flanks of Mt. Clift: then passing Mt. P. P. King on its
eastern slopes, crossing Sandy Creek, he turned a little more to the
north-west crossing the head waters of the Warrego to arrive on the
southern slopes of Mt. Faraday. Here he was on the Great Dividing Range.
When approaching Mt. Faraday he had crossed streams which he recognized
to be the head waters of another river, which was in fact the Warrego.
From the top of Mt. King, surveying the assembly of peaks, "I was at a
loss to discover where our supposed northern river would pass". He was
still searching for his great waterway to the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="m12"></a><img alt="" src="0700531h-images/map-12.jpg"></p>

<p><b>MAP XII. Map showing Mitchell's journey north to Alpha, his route

journey</b></p>
</center>

<p>After passing Mt. Faraday he saw and named, but did not visit Mt.
Salvator; and at this point he had a momentary hope:</p>

<blockquote>The course of this river, having its origin in mountains
equidistant between Cape York and Wilson's Promontory, it was reasonable
to suppose we had at length crossed the division between the northern and
southern waters.</blockquote>

<p>It was a reasonable deduction; he was, in fact, on the head waters of
the Nogoa which did indeed flow north, but not to the Gulf. Of this
region he said:</p>

<blockquote>It was a discovery worthy of the toils of a pilgrimage. Those
beautiful recesses of unpeopled earth could no longer remain
unknown.</blockquote>

<p>After some difficulty in extricating themselves from the gullies
around Mt. Salvator, they followed down the Nogoa past Lake Salvator,
then turned north-west over the Claude River to the ranges just south of
Mt. Observatory, reaching the head waters of Balmy Creek. In the Claude
River region many fragments of fossil wood were seen. At this stage, too,
difficulty in finding a track through the gullies was experienced, but at
length a possible pass over the range was found to the east of Mt. Mudge,
and they came down on to fine, undulating, forest land--the head waters
of the Belyando--near Avoca head station. This section of the journey had
occupied them from 4 June to 20 July, but was without incident except for
occasional lack of water and difficult country. They had no trouble with
natives.</p>

<p>It was at this point, when Mitchell had emerged from the tangled
mountain country on to the head waters of the Belyando River, that he
expressed his feeling of relief:</p>

<blockquote>I saw enough to relieve me of all anxiety about the want of
water. A promising valley from the mountains to the eastward came due
west, and from it arose the smoke of many native fires. The bright
prospects of the morning were a pleasing contrast to the temporary
difficulties of yesterday, such is human life in travelling, and so it
was in war at Salamanca this day thirty-four years back.</blockquote>

<p>From 20 July to 8 August they followed the Belyando northwards, with
Mt. Beaufort at first to the westward of their course, and at this point
Mitchell recorded: "Now again I believed that we had at length discovered
the head of a north-west river."</p>

<p>For the first eighty miles they were following the more easterly of
the head streams of the Belyando, but on 31 July they met that westerly
branch of the river which runs north from Alpha, and here the general
course of the river, as they were following it, turned from
north-westward to almost due north. Mitchell was misled by Dunda Creek,
which he followed hoping it would lead him north-west, but he had to
return to the main river, and here doubts began to form:</p>

<blockquote>The general course was by no means promising, being somewhat
to the E. of N.; it was much to be apprehended that this river, too,
would run to the E. coast.</blockquote>

<p>His hopes were again raised by another river containing plenty of
water and coming from the north-west.</p>

<p>THE FOURTH EXPEDITION 185</p>

<blockquote>I hoped it would lead us to higher regions, by following it
upwards, to where other waters might fall in the direction of the
Gulf.</blockquote>

<p>Then, on 7 August, they came on an apparently large stream joining the
Belyando and coming up from the west--this later proved to be, higher up,
a comparatively small stream. It was. Carmichael Creek.</p>

<p>From this point Mitchell scouted forward reaching an ultimate northern
point, according to his own observations, of 21&deg; 30' S.--a point on
the Belyando between Carmichael Creek on the west and Mistake Creek on
the east near the modern Mt. Douglas homestead. He did not, apparently,
see Mistake Creek. On 11 August, after having had the near prospect of
trouble with hostile natives; he decided to return up the river.</p>

<blockquote>I concluded, with much regret, that this river must be either
a tributary to, or identical with, that which Mr Leichhardt saw joining
the Suttor in latitude 21&deg; 6' S. I could no longer doubt that the
division between eastern and western waters was still to the westward. I
arrived at the following conclusions:<br>
<br>
That the river of Carpentaria should have been sought for to the westward
of all the sources of the river Salvator.*<br>
<br>
That under the parallel of 25&deg; S. the highest spinal range must
extend westward, in a line of truncated cones, whereof Mt. Faraday
appeared to be one.<br>
<br>
I reluctantly ordered my men (who believed themselves on the highway to
Carpentaria) to turn the horses' heads homewards, merely saying that we
were obliged to explore from a higher point.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* Nogoa.]</blockquote>

<p>Even allowing for the possibility that although this was published in
diary form under the date when his decision to return was made the
passage may have been written, or rewritten, long afterwards (when he had
proved the existence of the western range and had, as he thought, found
his great river) it is still remarkably good deduction.</p>

<p>He was, as he supposed, on the river which Leichhardt had named Suttor
Creek (ultimately joining the Burdekin River). Leichhardt had crossed
this main valley a few miles north of Mistake Creek, so Mitchell was
actually within a few miles of Leichhardt's track of seventeen months
previously.</p>

<p>Mitchell's decision to return was understandable. The natives were
threatening. He could, by going further, only cover ground already
crossed, while the general direction was leading him away from his
objective. At his last camp he carved on a tree "N.S.W. over LXIX"; this
camp would be on the Belyando, perhaps, about ten miles south of the
Carmichael Creek junction, about Moray Downs head station.</p>

<p>From 11 to 29 August the journey southward was continued without
incident. At the point where they crossed the tropic line, Mitchell had
carved on a tree the letter "T" over "N.S.W.". This is in the region of
Islay Plains. Then, crossing Drummond Range, passing Mts. Mudge and
Wentworth, they came down on to the plains of the Nogoa again at Balmy
Creek. Crossing the plains on a line almost due south from Mt. Mudge to
Mt. Salvator, they followed their old track to a point west of Mt.
Faraday. Here the first signs of early spring were apparent with new
growth of herbage everywhere. In this section of the journey Mitchell
named the Claude River and the Mantuan Downs. Of this region he
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>Here was an almost boundless extent of the richest surface
still uncultivated and unoccupied by man. A great reserve provided by
nature for the extension of his race, where economy, art, and industry,
might suffice to people it with a peaceful, happy, and contented
population.</blockquote>

<p>He must have passed quite close to, and a little to the west of,
Mantuan Downs head station. Having reached a very suitable spot in one of
the gullies on a line between Mts. Salvator and Hutton, Mitchell
established what he called Pyramid Depot, and spent two days writing
despatches, prior to his next journey westward.</p>

<p>FROM PYRAMID DEPOT TO THE WEST (10 September to 6 October 1846)</p>

<p>From 10 September to 6 October was spent by Mitchell in a journey to
the west, still in search of the great river to the Gulf. Leaving
Stephenson in charge of the depot he started with two men, and the native
Yuranigh, all mounted, and leading two pack-horses, carrying sextant,
false horizon and one month's provisions. Two pack-horses for one month's
provisions suggest that the party travelled on very light rations.</p>

<p>Passing to the south of Mt. Pluto and north of Mt. Playfair the party
moved westward along the southern slopes of the range, till they came to
the Nive and its junction with the Nivelle.</p>

<blockquote>I verily believed that this river would run to Carpentaria,
and I called it the Nive, at least as a conventional name until the
native name could be ascertained, in commemoration of Lord Wellington's
action on the river of that name; and to the tributary from the north, I
gave the name of Nivelle.</blockquote>

<p>But he was soon disappointed in his hope that this river would lead
him to the Gulf as it continued on a southerly course, so he altered his
course to a gap in the Warrego Range to the northwest.</p>

<p>He moved into this gap (where the town of Tambo now is):</p>

<blockquote>I hastened towards the gap, and ascended a naked rock on the
west side of it. I there beheld downs and plains extending westward
beyond the reach of vision: the whole of these open downs declining to
the N.W. in which direction a line of trees marked the course of a river
traceable to the remotest verge of the horizon. There I found then, at
last, the realization of my long cherished hopes, an interior river
falling to the N.W. in the heart of an open country extending also in
that direction. Ulloa's delight at the first view of the Pacific could
not have surpassed mine on this occasion, nor could the fervour with
which he was impressed at the moment have exceeded my sense of gratitude,
for being allowed to make such a discovery. From that rock, the scene was
so extensive as to leave no room for doubt as to the course of the river,
which, thus and there revealed to me alone, seemed like a reward direct
from Heaven for perseverance, and as a compensation for the many
sacrifices I had made, in order to solve the question as to the interior
rivers of tropical Australia.</blockquote>

<p>He was impressed with these great open plains, where the grass
surpassed any he had ever seen in the colony in quality and abundance,
and was moved to some philosophical reflections:</p>

<blockquote>A situation might be imagined between earth and heaven, where
a man should hear nothing but the thoughts of the Almighty: but such a
sublime position seems almost attained by him who is the first permitted
to traverse extensive portions of the earth, as yet unoccupied by man; to
witness in solitude and silence regions well adapted to his use, brings a
man into more immediate converse with the author of his being, and of all
other combinations of matter than any other imaginable position he can
attain. With nothing but nature around him; his few wants supplied almost
miraculously; living on from day to day, just as he falls in with water;
his existence is felt to be in the hands of Providence alone; and this
feeling pervades even the minds of the least susceptible in journeys like
these.</blockquote>

<p>On 21 September, eleven days from camp, when they were in the vicinity
of Blackall, Mitchell recorded: "I laid down our journey on paper and
found we were making great progress towards Carpentaria." On 23 September
he noted the junction with the Alice River, and here began anxiety about
provisions.</p>

<blockquote>Our only care now was the duration of our provisions...my men
(two old soldiers) were willing to undergo any privations that might
enable me to prolong my ride.</blockquote>

<p>To save distance, in the belief that the river would continue
north-west, Mitchell struck off in that direction, but was soon convinced
that he would have to seek the continuation of the river to the
south-west. He regained the river, passing the vicinity of Isisford on 24
September and reaching a point on the level of Yaraka on the same day.
Here the natives showed signs of hostility and, the horses being weary,
the food supply dangerously low, Mitchell decided to return. At this
point he very briefly recorded in his diary (as printed in 1848): "I saw
the course of the river running nearly northward. Here, then, I turned
towards the east to travel home." On the map which is included in
Mitchell's published volume the river is shown as going to the
north-west, but he did not verify even that short section.</p>

<p>Having now arrived at the end point of his journey a review of his
situation is permissible. The enthusiasm at different early stages of his
journey, which is recorded in the entries already quoted, is quite absent
from his record in these last days. If he was not convinced that this was
not his great river to the Gulf, he must at least have had grave doubts.
On four successive observations he had found the height above sea level
to be only 700 feet, the stream showed the broken channel and anabranches
characteristic of inland rivers; and he was, approximately, 450 miles
from the nearest point on the Gulf. He was unusually skilled in his
profession, he must have known of this distance, and could hardly accept
this broken stream, with its multiple channels and with a fall over 700
miles of eighteen inches in the mile, as his great navigable waterway to
the Indian Ocean. Also he must have known by that time that Leichhardt,
having crossed round the base of the Gulf, had not crossed any such
stream. There is something a little unconvincing, and more than a little
pathetic, in reading Mitchell's own record of these few days. That he
started off with only two pack-horses and one month's provisions for a
total journey of about fourteen hundred miles, suggests that, when he set
out, he had no confident hope of reaching the Gulf.</p>

<p><a name="dd"></a>After he had returned to Sydney, and one month before
leaving Sydney for England, he gave written instructions (22 February
1847) to Kennedy to proceed overland to the end-point of his own journey
to determine the ultimate course of the river which he (Mitchell) had
named the Victoria River. He instructed Kennedy that the principal object
of this journey was to determine the course of the Victoria River, and
the discovery of a convenient route to the head of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, and added:</p>

<blockquote>On arriving at or near the Gulf of Carpentaria, I have
particularly to caution you against remaining longer than may be
unavoidable there.</blockquote>

<p>But, as the official correspondence shows, Mitchell's instructions to
Kennedy were so definite and rigid that Kennedy was not at liberty to
deviate from the course of the Barcoo (Victoria) River wherever that led
him: and although Kennedy was aware that the main object of the
expedition was to discover a "convenient route to the Gulf of
Carpentaria" he was so tied by Mitchell's instructions to follow that
river that he did not feel free to explore northwards.[20] Mitchell was
so obsessed by the belief that the Barcoo River discharged into the Gulf
of Carpentaria that he made no allowance for other possibilities.</p>

<p>At the stage at which he decided to abandon further investigation of
this river and return on his tracks, Mitchell made a decision which is
recorded in the published account of this journey:</p>

<blockquote>The river we were about to leave required a name, for no
natives could be made to understand our questions. It seemed to me to
deserve a great name, being of much importance as leading from temperate
into tropical regions, a river leading to India: the grand goal, in
short, of explorers by sea and land from Columbus downwards.<br>
<br>
This river seemed to me to be typical of God's providence, in conveying
living water into a dry parched land, and thus affording access to open
and extensive pastoral regions, likely to be soon peopled by civilized
inhabitants.<br>
<br>
It was with sentiments of devotion, zeal, and loyalty, that I therefore
gave to this river the name of my gracious Sovereign, Queen
Victoria.[21]</blockquote>

<p>Stokes during the voyage of H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i> had, in October 1839,
discovered and named the Victoria River in the Northern Territory, and
the <i>Beagle</i> was in Australian waters for several years afterwards,
visiting Sydney early in 1842, when Stokes had found the projected
expedition to Port Essington being widely discussed. Mitchell was then in
Sydney and it must be assumed that he was well aware of the prior naming
of that much larger river. Some writers have explained Mitchell's use of
the name by saying that he was sure he was on the head waters of the same
stream: but this theory is not tenable.[22] Fourteen years earlier he was
convinced that there was little probability that a river would flow from
this region to the sea westward of the Gulf of Carpentaria (see <a href=
"#ee">earlier</a>).</p>

<p>Gregory's comments when, twelve years later, he followed Mitchell's
tracks in this western district, are sensible:</p>

<blockquote>Captain Wickham having named an important river discovered by
him in H.M.S. <i>Beagle</i> on the north-west coast the Victoria several
years prior to Sir Thomas Mitchell having attached that name to the upper
portion of Cooper's Creek which had also been previously discovered and
named by Captain Sturt, I would suggest that the term River Cooper be
adopted for the whole of the main channel from its sources discovered by
Sir Thomas Mitchell to its termination in Lake Torrens; as, while it does
not interfere with the rule that the name given by the first discoverer
should be retained, will prevent the recurrence of the misapprehension
and inconvenience of having two important rivers with the same
designation on the maps of Australia.[23]</blockquote>

<p>Gregory also found that the downs in this region were not, as Mitchell
found them, covered with luxuriant grass, but were of bare grassless
clay.</p>

<p>Mitchell, when he turned, was about 260 miles from Sturt's last point
on Cooper's Creek. It is just possible that he had approximate, although
not exact, geographical details of Sturt's intended route. Certainly he
makes no mention of Sturt. He records at the end-point of his
journey:</p>

<blockquote>Even there, in the heart of the interior, on a river utterly
unheard of by white men, an iron tomahawk glittered on high in the hand
of a chief.</blockquote>

<p>Sturt records that he had given a tomahawk to a native on Cooper's
Creek on 31 October 1845--and that he had no others to give.[24] No other
white party had been in this region, and it is reasonably certain that
this was the very tomahawk given by Sturt. To complete this story it has
only to be recorded that Kennedy did, as instructed, proceed to the
Victoria River in 1847, followed it down to the south-west for about one
hundred miles farther than Mitchell, to within about one hundred miles of
Sturt's end-point, and he reported on his return: "There can exist but
little doubt that the Victoria is identical with Cooper's Creek of
Captain Sturt." He also reported that the natives told him that their
name for the river was the Barcoo--it has been known officially by that
name ever since.</p>

<p>Parker and Somerville have discussed at length the confusion between
the names Cooper's Creek given by Sturt (1845), Victoria River given by
Mitchell (1846), and Barcoo River given by Kennedy (1847).[25]</p>

<p>THE RETURN JOURNEY (24 September to 29 December 1846)</p>

<p>Mitchell began his return journey on 24 September. While the state of
his horses, and of his food supplies, were probably sufficient reasons,
it may also have been that the rebukes he had received for the Mt.
Dispersion incident in 1836 were still remembered, for he abandoned his
journey down the Belyando, and also down the Barcoo, on each occasion
when the natives were definitely hostile. Instead of following round the
big northern bend of the Victoria (which in this account will hereafter
be called the Barcoo) he moved along an easterly course, very much along
the line of the present railway, to reach the Barcoo again near Blackall.
In this section he saw and named the Gowan Range, with its peaks Gray and
Koenig. Thence following his outward track, he reached the Pyramid Depot
on 6 October.</p>

<p>Now began the long journey home. Leaving Pyramid Depot on 9 October
they followed their outward tracks down the Maranoa, arriving, without
incident, on 19 October at the base camp on that river where Kennedy and
party had been for four and a half months. Everything at the camp was in
good order--in the garden lettuce, radishes, melons and cucumbers were
flourishing. On 22 October the whole party started southwards, and,
instead of following their old track along the Cogoon, they followed the
Maranoa, passing the site of the present town of Mitchell on 24 October.
Mitchell comments:</p>

<blockquote>The discovery of these extensive downs was an important
incident in this journey, watered as they were by a fine
river.</blockquote>

<p>On 26 October he passed the junction of a river with the Maranoa,
which he placed as the Amby, and on 5 November arrived at their old camp
at St. George. At this stage Mitchell describes himself as</p>

<blockquote>wiser than when I set out--much improved in health--bronzed
and bearded; sun-proof, fly-proof, and water-proof: this is to say, proof
against the want of it.</blockquote>

<p>From 5 to 9 November they remained at St. George, Mitchell writing
despatches and Kennedy scouting a route to the endpoint of Mitchell's
first expedition, near Mungindi on the Bar-won, as Mitchell intended to
take the direct route home instead of going back to the Bogan. It would
be reasonably correct to say that, starting on 17 November, they followed
the course of the present road from St. George to near Mungindi, down the
Moonie River through Thallon. On 9 December they reached the Darling and
assembled the boats for the transport of their stores across the
river.</p>

<blockquote>These looked well in the water; their trim appearance and
utility then, renewed my regret that I had not reached the navigable
portion of the Victoria.</blockquote>

<p>These were idle words: he had not taken the boats to the Victoria.</p>

<p>Mitchell was now concerned to trace a direct line of road to 'dney:
however, the past century has proved that, in this, he d not succeed, as
his tracks did not develop into main roads:</p>

<blockquote>Since I had first explored that country to which my wheel
tracks marked and led the way, station after station had been taken up by
squatters, not by following any line of route, but rather according to
the course of the river, for the sake of water; and in such cases the
beaten track from station to station, no matter how crooked, becomes the
road.</blockquote>

<p>On 12 December they crossed the Gwydir and camped on Snodgrass Lagoon
on the Moomin branch of the Gwydir, then past Narrabri to arrive at
Maule's Creek. During this stage Mitchell, riding ahead, having left
Kennedy to bring on the party, proceeded to Wentworth's station on the
Namoi</p>

<blockquote>and next day I reached the dwelling of a resident squatter,
and saw a lady in a comfortable house near the very spot where, fifteen
years before, I had taken a lonely walk by the then unknown Nammoy, the
first white man permitted there to discover a flowery desert. I was most
kindly welcomed by this family; but I asked in vain, even there, to be
favoured with the perusal of a newspaper. When I expressed anxiety about
my numerous family, and spoke of my long absence of a year, I observed a
tear in. the lady's eye, which I then thought the product of mere
sensibility; but I learnt subsequently that she was aware the newspapers
she possessed, and out of sympathy withheld, would have apprised me of
the death of a son, which sad tidings were only communicated to me some
days after.</blockquote>

<p>This was his son Campbell who, at the age of eighteen, had died while
surveying the Australian Alps in winter. Mitchell arrived in Sydney on 29
December 1846.</p>

<p>The party under Kennedy arrived in Sydney on 20 January 347, and so
ended, after fourteen months, Mitchell's fourth, last, and longest
expedition of exploration.</p>

<blockquote>The new Governor, Sir Charles Fitz Roy, kindly granted such
gratuities to the most deserving of my men as I had recommended, and also
sent the names to England of such prisoners as His Excellency thought
deserving of Her Majesty's gracious pardon.<br>
<br>
It would ill become me to disparage the character of the aborigines for
one of that unfortunate race has been my "guide, companion, councillor
and friend" on the most eventful occasions during this last Journey of
Discovery. Yuranigh was small and slender in person but (as the youth
Dicky said, and I believed) he was of the most determined courage and
resolution. His intelligence and his judgment rendered him so necessary
to me that he was ever at my elbow, whether on foot or horseback.
Confidence in him was never misplaced. He well knew the character of all
the white men in the party. Nothing escaped his penetrating eye and quick
ear. His brief but oracular sentences were found to be sage though
uttered by one deemed a savage; and his affection and kindness towards
the little native Dicky seemed quite paternal. The younger was the
willing servant of the elder, who obliged him to wash and clean himself
before he allowed him to sleep near him. Yuranigh was particularly clean
in his person, frequently washing, and his glossy shining black hair,
always well-combed, gave him an uncommonly clean and decent appearance.
He had promised himself and Dicky a great reception on returning to
Sydney, and was perhaps disappointed. Dicky had never before seen houses,
and Yuranigh took much delight in showing him the theatre, and whatever
else was likely to gratify his curiosity.<br>
<br>
The boy was all questions and observation. I was at a loss how to make
these natives comfortable; or suitably reward their services. The new
Governor kindly granted the small gratuity asked for Yuranigh, and Dicky
became a favourite in my family. Both these natives loathed the idea of
returning to the woods as savages; and, as if captivated with the scenes
of activity around them both expressed a desire "to work and live like
white men". This shows that, when treated on a footing of equality, as
these had been in my party, the Australian native might be induced to
take part in the labours of white men; but at the first annoyance the old
freedom of the bush seems to overmaster their resolutions, and attracts
them back to it. Yuranigh was engaged (for wages and under a regular
agreement) as stockman to a gentleman who had cattle in the north, and he
took an affecting leave of my family.<br>
<br>
I carried Dicky to my house in the country with the intention of having
him educated there with my children, provided a tutor could be found,
which seemed doubtful when I left the colony. It has long been a
favourite project with me, to educate an aboriginal native as a husband
for Ballandella, and that their children should form at least one
civilized family of the native race upon which the influence of education
and religious principles might be fairly tried.</blockquote>

<p>Having said so much Mitchell admitted that the experiment was scarcely
practicable except by sending the married couple to another country, such
as the south of Europe, for ten or twelve years: he realized that this,
too, was impracticable as it would make them strangers to every aspect of
colonial life.</p>

<p>Writing to Surveyor Davidson in the Wellington district (25 April
1850), Mitchell enquired about Yuranigh saying that a gentleman in
England had been so pleased with Yuranigh's conduct, as described by
Mitchell in his book, that he had sent out one guinea as a present for
him.[26] But Davidson replied that Yuranigh was dead. Later Mitchell
advised Davidson (10 July 1852) that he wished that Yuranigh's grave
should be properly cared for, and that a stone should be provided to mark
the grave: he forwarded an inscription to be cut in the stone.[27] This
was done, the expense being borne by the Government. A later Government,
in 1900, through representations made by the Hon. Jago Smith, renovated
the headstone, re-erecting it on a base of Molong marble, and erected a
neat fence around the grave[28] (<a href="#p13">Plate XIII</a>). The
inscription on the tombstone was:</p>

<pre>
To
Native Courage
Honesty and Fidelity
YURANIGH
Who accompanied the
Expedition of discovery
Into Tropical Australia in 1846
Lies buried here
According to the rites
Of his countrymen
And this spot was
Dedicated and enclosed
By the Governor General's
Authority in 1852
</pre>

<p>What had Mitchell accomplished on this journey? Using, for the sake of
clarity, modern place-names, he had, in fact, covered no new ground until
he had passed the latitude of Dirranbandi, for his son had been on the
Culgoa and Bokhara. But from that point he explored, and roughly charted,
as far north as one hundred and twenty miles north of Alpha, and as far
west, on the Barcoo, as Isisford. He had successfully conducted a large
expedition for fourteen months without accident or serious incident. So
that he might travel farther afield, and more efficiently, he had
established three depot camps, the first, a temporary one, at St. George;
the second on the Maranoa south-east of Mt. Elliot in the region of
Donnybrook, this he left in Kennedy's charge; and the third on the Nogoa
between Mts. Salvator and Hutton in charge of Stephenson. This was, in
many ways, the most successful of his four expeditions: he did not find
his great river to the Gulf, but he added much to the knowledge of the
country, and he dispelled many uncertainties.</p>

<p>Fitzroy, who had succeeded Gipps as Governor, forwarded to Secretary
of State Grey copies of the reports which Mitchell had submitted, which
had appeared in the Government Gazettes of 7 and 31 December 1846, with
the comment that the main object which the legislature had in view when
they provided funds for defraying the expense of this expedition, namely,
the discovery of a practicable overland route to Port Essington, had not
been accomplished, but he added that Mitchell had made a valuable
addition to the discoveries in the interior of New Holland.[29] He
supplemented these despatches a little later (30 March 1847) with the
information that, on the advice of the Executive Council, he had granted
Mitchell twelve months' leave of absence.[30]</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII - Second Visit to England</h2>

<p>Mitchell had arrived in Sydney on return from the fourth expedition on
29 December 1846. He must have applied immediately for leave of absence,
which Fitzroy, with the approval of the Executive Council, granted on 28
January 1847. This leave of absence for twelve months was granted</p>

<blockquote>upon receiving Sir Thomas Mitchell's assurance that the
urgent private affairs which took him to England, were of great
importance and could not be transacted by correspondence from the
Colony.[1]</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell left Sydney by the ship <i>Walmor Castle</i> on 27 March
1847. During his leave he was entitled to half pay from the army as a
retired major, and half of his civil salary as Surveyor General. But
Fitzroy omitted to notify the Colonial Office concerning the payment of
these amounts in England and only sent the necessary instruction on 15
July 1847--four months after Mitchell's departure.[2] Soon after his
arrival in England, Mitchell wrote, on 24 July, to Secretary of State
Earl Grey asking that he would issue to the War Office and the Colonial
Office instructions for the payment of this salary.[3] The Colonial
Office replied on 8 August, that no advice had then been received from
Fitzroy that he had been granted leave of absence.[4] However, seven
weeks later, the Under-Secretary, Hawes, informed Mitchell (27 September
1847) that advice had now been received from Sydney, but that Earl Grey
had ruled that payment of salary should be withheld until he should be
satisfied concerning two issues raised by Fitzroy's despatch.[5] This
decision naturally embarrassed Mitchell financially, and he was obliged
to borrow money from his uncle Joseph, who was "still kind and hospitable
to me".[6]</p>

<p>The first issue raised by Grey was the necessity for so long a period
of leave. Fitzroy had granted leave of absence to deal with "urgent
private affairs": and the period of leave was twelve months. Grey did not
consider this as sufficient reason for so long an absence from Mitchell's
duties in Sydney and his reluctance to approve of the leave was increased
in view of "the great length of time during which you were absent from
those duties on your last visit to England".[7] Grey refused to approve the
leave or to direct payment of salary; but was ready to receive and
consider any statement on the subject which Mitchell might submit.[8]</p>

<p>Mitchell was absent in Spain, probably collecting vine cuttings and
other plant specimens to take back to Australia, when this letter was
written, but on his return two months later, he wrote to Hawes of the
Colonial Office (15 November 1847) and stated that the grounds upon which
he had applied for leave were:</p>

<blockquote>That very unfavourable reports concerning his health had been
sent to the Colonial Office.<br>
<br>
That he had had an attack of paralysis and his doctor had recommended a
sea voyage.*<br>
<br>
That he had occasion to give to the public the details of a journey
undertaken at the public expense.[9]</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* His own estimate of his health as stated in the
preceding chapter will be recalled.]</blockquote>

<p>He expressed his regret that Grey should have felt that the four years
spent on his last visit to England (1837-41) provided grounds for His
Lordship's reluctance to approve of the present visit as the service on
both occasions was the same--namely:</p>

<blockquote>To give to the public the benefit of surveys performed at the
public expense. I admit that I consider the due and full completion of
any public service entrusted to me, as being the most urgent of my
private affairs.</blockquote>

<p>He ended his letter to Hawes:</p>

<blockquote>I have further only to add that my health is much improved by
this visit to Europe, and that I have no desire to remain longer in
England than may be necessary to enable me to bring out the work whereof
Lord Grey had been pleased to sanction the publication.</blockquote>

<p>The real reason, the "urgent private affairs", which brought him to
England was the publication of the book describing his fourth expedition.
The suspicion that he wished his book to appear before Sturt's account of
his Central Australian expedition would not be too unkind.*</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* It was while Mitchell was in England during this
visit that, as Sturt records: "He saw me in the street, but hurried on
without recognition."[10] Also while in England he wrote to his son
Livingstone (18 August 1847): "Boone has sent me Leichhardt's travels and
a more useless mass of rubbish never was bound up in the form of a
book."[11]]</blockquote>

<p>Grey gave permission for the publication of the book and it was
published in 1848 well before Sturt's book. In it Mitchell makes no
reference to the fact that Kennedy had completely disproved his claim
that the Barcoo would ultimately discharge into the Gulf of Carpentaria.
There is no certainty that, in London, he would have knowledge of the
results of that journey. This volume, <i>Journal of an Expedition into
the Interior of Tropical Australia in search of a route from Sydney to
the Gulf of Carpentaria</i>, shows evidence of less careful preparation
than his previously published work: it does, however, contain certain
interesting reflections on the probable fate of the aborigines. He
compared the physical perfection of the aboriginal in his native state
with the inferior physique of civilized man: he emphasized that their
means of subsistence and their social habits were adjusted with admirable
fitness to the few resources afforded by the country in its wild state,
and he concluded:</p>

<blockquote>We cannot occupy the land without producing a change fully as
great to the aborigines as that which took place on man's fall and
expulsion from Eden. Surely it behoves a nation, so active in the
suppression of slavery, to consider betimes, in taking up new countries,
how the aboriginal races can be preserved; and how the evil effects of
spirituous liquors, of gunpowder, and of diseases more inimical to them
than even slavery, may be counteracted.</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately Grey sanctioned the leave but regarded the grounds upon
which leave was granted as far from satisfactory, and said that Mitchell
must understand that he would not approve of any extension of leave
beyond the twelve months even though the purposes for which Mitchell had
come to England had not been completed.[12] This meant that he should be
back in Sydney by 27 March 1848. Mitchell, however, on receipt of this
letter wrote again (8 January 1848) saying that his work was not
completed and hoping that he might be granted an extension of two
months.[13] Hawes replied (17 January 1848) that Grey consented to an
extension until 1 March, but no longer, and:</p>

<blockquote>His Lordship directs me to state that he is still unable to
approve of the original grant to you of leave of
absence.[14]</blockquote>

<p>But Mitchell was required to give evidence before a Committee of the
House of Lords and stayed even beyond 1 March. Anyone</p>

<p>with experience of public service procedure would know who had the
last word.</p>

<p>While in London he suffered from an attack of influenza concerning
which he wrote to the McCrae family in Melbourne:</p>

<blockquote>I too have been laid up in London with influenza, all which
annoyances endear the recollections of Australia where I never had a cold
of any kind.[15]</blockquote>

<p>The second issue raised in this correspondence was of a different
kind. Fitzroy in his despatch (30 March 1847) announcing that he had,
with the advice of his Executive Council, granted Mitchell leave of
absence, commented that, as Mitchell during the fourth expedition and the
forthcoming leave would have been away from his office for an almost
continuous period of two years, during which time the Survey Department
had been conducted by the Deputy Surveyor General alone, it was evident
that the necessity for the two positions must be questioned.[16] Hawes in
his letter (27 September 1847), already quoted, informed Mitchell that
Lord Grey wished to be informed of Mitchell's opinion as to the
necessity, under the circumstances already cited, of maintaining both a
Surveyor General and a Deputy Surveyor General on the colonial
establishment.[17]</p>

<p>Mitchell's reply, having regard to the facts on record and
unquestionably known to him, provides evidence of his conception of the
nature and scope of his official obligations:</p>

<blockquote>I beg to observe that this appears to me to depend wholly on
the nature of the duties to be required henceforth of the Surveyor
General (Lord Stanley's letter to the Governor of New South Wales, dated
15 June 1833 is very particular on this point as to the past). According
to the Royal instructions of 1825, extensive territorial divisions and
reserves were commanded to be made, and, pursuant to a Commission under
the great seal of the Colony, I made with my own hand a trigonometrical
survey and determined the boundaries and contents of nineteen counties,
marked out the great roads, and superintended their construction by
upwards of two thousand convicts, and explored the interior to Westward,
Southward, and lastly to the Northward.<br>
<br>
It must be obvious that I could not be always present at the Seat of
Government where my Deputy signed for me official documents requiring my
signature. I know of no other service on which I have required that
officer's assistance, besides that general superintendence of others
employed under my written instructions: and, therefore, I could not
object to such a diminution of my department, if, as I am led to infer
from your letter, my duty as head of the Survey Department may be
performed at Sydney.[18]</blockquote>

<p>The "Royal instructions" of 1825, were the instructions quoted <a
href="#hh">earlier</a> arising out of Commissioner Bigge's report, by the
Colonial Office, that the whole territory of New South Wales was to be at
once divided into counties, hundreds, and parishes.[19]</p>

<p>Lord Stanley's letter of 1833 was to the effect that whereas in 1825
instructions had been issued for a general survey, an exact
trigonometrical survey had been instituted by Mitchell, and this had,
apparently, made little progress, and Stanley had concluded:</p>

<blockquote>I have to convey to you His Majesty's commands that you lose
no time in calling upon Major Mitchell to explain the causes of the
delay.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell was unfortunate in invoking those two earlier incidents, or,
perhaps, he hoped that after fifteen years they would have been
forgotten. Whatever his attitude, he includes a reference to these "Royal
instructions" in his book <i>Journal of an Expedition into the Interior
of Tropical Australia</i>.[20]</p>

<p>In a private letter to Hay so early as 1832, Mitchell had said:</p>

<blockquote>It would indeed be a great relief to me and advantageous to
the service could Mr Perry be removed to some other situation, and
replaced by a man of business. It is not at all necessary for the
business of these departments that he should be a
surveyor.[21]</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell would have arrived back in Sydney about July 1848, the exact
date is not known. After his return to Sydney he wrote to Grey (21
September 1849) in terms inconsistent with his position as a public
officer. He said first that when he was invited in Downing Street in the
early part of the year 1827 to accept a colonial appointment he
understood that his services were required in a general survey of New
South Wales "to be made under Royal instructions". He reviewed his
services to the colony "during the long period of twenty-two years", and
continued:</p>

<blockquote>But during the whole of my Colonial service I have found that
the more I endeavoured to fulfil with exactness the views of the
Government at home, the less it seemed to be my good fortune to please
the Governors of the Colony,</blockquote>

<p>and referring to the correspondence which had passed during his recent
visit to London, he said:</p>

<blockquote>The letters written in Your Lordship's name on that occasion
and based on representations from Governors of the Colony, afforded to me
a painful proof that I could not expect from Your Lordship that
consideration to which not only my long career of Colonial service, but
still more my long previous career as a military geographer entitle
me.[22]</blockquote>

<p>He then asked for promotion such as that for which the late Sir George
Murray had recommended him in 1844: or alternatively, if he was to be
dismissed, that he be paid &pound;1 <i>per diem</i> for all the time he
was acting as sole Commissioner for Lands and Surveys, doing the duties
of all three. If he were paid this amount, he could remove his family
from the colony. He was still, even after so long an interval, harping on
the old themes.</p>

<p>This letter was received in the Colonial Office on 29 January 1850. As
it now stands in the records of the Colonial Office it carries an office
memorandum:</p>

<blockquote>When Sir Thomas Mitchell was first appointed Surveyor General
in New South Wales there was a certain royal authority for the survey and
apportionment of territory under which he assumed distinct
responsibilities and which proved a fruitful source of difference between
him and the head of the Government. He has had the misfortune to differ
with each successive Governor and he appears now to write in discontent
with Sir Charles Fitzroy. There is no record of the recommendation in his
favour from Sir George Murray.</blockquote>

<p>(Then follows a long recital of the occasions and reasons for
criticism of his administration by the Colonial Office, which is, in
effect, a summary of the events recorded in the preceding chapters.) The
minute concludes:</p>

<blockquote>I presume he will hardly have been thought to have shown any
claim either to promotion to a higher office or to a retiring
allowance.[23]</blockquote>

<p>Glenelg, who had succeeded Grey as Secretary of State, forwarded
Mitchell's letter of 21 September to Fitzroy with his comments: these
comments included the statement that</p>

<blockquote>much of his time in the colony has been consumed in exploring
expeditions entered upon much more because they were according to his
taste than because they fell within his regular duties.</blockquote>

<p>Glenelg gave instructions that these comments should be shown to
Mitchell. This provoked a long memorial from Mitchell which was forwarded
by Fitzroy (11 December 1850) with the following comments by himself.
These comments refer back to a matter which has recurred again and again
in this volume:</p>

<blockquote>The memorial sets forth Sir Thomas Mitchell's military and
civil services and prays acknowledgment by advancement to some more
important and lucrative office or money allowance as may compensate him
for half-pay and half salary alternately withheld on occasions when Sir
Thomas Mitchell's services either to the army or to the Colony were most
costly to himself.<br>
<br>
It is desirable that I should offer such observations as will put Your
Lordship in possession of accurate information concerning that portion of
it which refers to the proceedings of the local Government.<br>
<br>
In the twenty-fourth paragraph Sir Thomas Mitchell states as the reason
why he considers himself entitled either to protnotion or compensation
that "the Commission and Instructions under which he had performed his
duties for the long period of twenty-three years have been cancelled by
the local Government."<br>
<br>
In order that Your Lordship should be fully aware how far this statement
supports his claim, it is necessary that I should explain that Sir Thomas
Mitchell has always insisted that certain Instructions which in point of
fact were issued to him by Sir Ralph Darling when Governor in 1825 and
which were founded on the Royal Instructions delivered to Sir Ralph
Darling with his Governor's Commission, were instructions issued direct
from the Sovereign to himself; and that under them he was invested with
an authority entirely independent of the local Governor.<br>
<br>
It is superfluous to observe that instructions issued by Sir Ralph
Darling would be superseded by any issued to Sir Thomas Mitchell by the
next Governor, Bourke, under his own Commission and Royal Instructions;
and that these in their turn would be superseded by Instructions to Gipps
and finally by recent Act of Parliament 9 and 10 Vict. ch. 104 and Order
in Council.<br>
<br>
But not withstanding these self-evident facts Sir Thomas Mitchell has
throughout persisted in asserting that instructions he received under
Governor Darling--or what he has always designated in his correspondence
with the Government, "the Royal Instructions of 1825"--not having been at
any time expressly or formally revoked, he was still independent of the
local Governor.<br>
<br>
His endeavours to maintain this position have been the main cause of his
collisions with my predecessors and during my administration of this
Government. Since his return from England he has adhered to it with so
much pertinacity and offered so many impediments to the views of the
Government concerning the survey of squatting districts that I availed
myself of an opportunity of setting the question finally at rest; and,
under the advice of my Executive Council (10 October 1848) I formally
revoked Darling's instructions and issued fresh instructions to Sir
Thomas Mitchell in my own name in pursuance of the authority entrusted to
me by Order in Council of 9 March 1847.[24]</blockquote>

<p>Fitzroy's memorandum then proceeded with a discussion of other matters
raised by Mitchell in his memorial: these have already been discussed in
preceding chapters. When the memorial, and Fitzroy's comments, reached
London they were considered at the Colonial Office and finally Lord Grey
marked them (on 19 May 1851):</p>

<blockquote>Say that I have received the memorial, but it is not in my
power to comply with his request as I consider his services to have been
adequately rewarded.</blockquote>

<p>But Mitchell had not been content to let the matter rest at that
stage. As soon as Fitzroy had taken action to revoke the old instructions
of 1825, Mitchell announced in a memorial which was forwarded to the
Colonial Office that he considered himself entitled to promotion or
compensation because of this alteration in his official status.[25] This
memorial when it reached London provoked a long official Colonial Office
minute by Gairdner:</p>

<blockquote>Sir Charles Fitzroy has in his despatch given reasons why it
was considered necessary to revoke the Commission referred to under which
Sir Thomas Mitchell acted in respect of some portion of his duties and to
which he appears all along to have attached so singular an importance as
to lead him to act with insubordination towards his official superiors,
and, finally, when (in order to reduce him to proper subjection) it was
thought necessary to revoke that Commission, to claim compensation for
loss of position.</blockquote>

<p>In respect of some other letters which Mitchell had requested should
be forwarded at the same time, the Colonial Office minute comments that
it is difficult to understand why Mitchell should desire the transmission
of letters "which tell so little in his favour at a time when he is
seeking advancement or compensation on account of his imagined claims".
It is hardly surprising that his claim for advancement or compensation
was rejected.</p>

<p>In this atmosphere of irregular conduct towards his own Governor, and
even towards the Secretary of State, Mitchell chose to raise trouble over
still another matter. It has already been stated that, so long ago as
1832, he had wished for the removal of Perry, his Deputy Surveyor
General. Now, after twenty years, he returned to this attack. Fitzroy
wrote to Grey (22 September 1851) that he was sorry to have to trouble
Grey again about Mitchell, but Perry had sought his protection against
attacks by Mitchell.[26]</p>

<p>Perry, during Mitchell's prolonged absence in England in 1847-8, had
carried on the proper duties of the position of Surveyor General: but
Mitchell on his return had violently criticized Perry's official conduct
of the departmental functions. Fitzroy had tried personal reconciliation
without success, but Mitchell had continued his attacks on Perry, and
sought his replacement. Fitzroy, in forwarding the papers to Grey, said
that the attacks by Mitchell were so insulting and so obviously intended
to degrade Perry in the opinion of his subordinates, that he felt bound
to state that Perry, during Mitchell's frequent absences, had always been
a loyal and efficient officer, and that Mitchell himself had, on
occasions, given proof of his confidence in Perry's abilities. Fitzroy
added:</p>

<blockquote>If I had an officer to deal with less unreasonable and less
impracticable than Sir Thomas Mitchell I should endeavour by
remonstrance, and, that failing, by reproof, to bring him to a sense of
duty without thinking it necessary to appeal to Your Lordship, but my
experience of Sir Thomas Mitchell's disposition convinces me that
forbearance would be entirely thrown away upon him, and that any step I
could take short of suspending him from his office until Your Lordship's
pleasure was known would have no effect. I am reluctant to adopt that
extreme course in the case of an officer of such high and long standing
in military and civil services but I am satisfied that so long as Sir
Thomas Mitchell remains at the head of the Survey Department the views of
the Government will be thwarted by every means in his power and the
exertions of his subordinate officers paralysed by fear of incurring his
displeasure. I therefore recommend that Sir Thomas Mitchell should be
removed from the office of Surveyor General with a retiring allowance
commensurate to his age and length of service.</blockquote>

<p>When this reached the Colonial Office on 5 February 1852 it provoked
various official minutes on the file by T. F. Elliot and H.
Merivale*--respectively Assistant and Permanent Under-Secretaries at the
Colonial Office. Elliot had written to Merivale, his chief in the
department, an office minute:</p>

<blockquote>This is simply a repetition of past improprieties on
Mitchell's part. He is incorrigible: it is not perhaps surprising that an
officer so often guilty of impertinence to his superiors should indulge
in insults to those who have the misfortune to be his subordinates. What
makes his present conduct especially blameable is that the officer he has
assailed is just the one who has had to perform his proper duties for him
whilst he has been spending whole years in Europe bringing out lucrative
books of his own, or else indulging his taste in exploring expeditions in
the Colony: but perhaps it is for this very reason he views his deputy
with so evil an eye. The Governor will, I presume, be judged right in
considering it full time that he should be removed from a department in
which he has shown himself equally unwilling to do his duties himself and
jealous of the exertions of those who had done them for him.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* Merivale had succeeded Stephen in
1847.]</blockquote>

<p>Merivale, however, considered that there might be elements of
injustice in retiring Mitchell on a pension and was not prepared to use
such extreme measures: he considered that Fitzroy had not adopted a
course appropriate as precedent to a recommendation for dismissal.</p>

<p>The matter, having been considered by Parliamentary Under-Secretary
Peel, finally reached Grey who wrote to Fitzroy (20 February 1852) saying
that if Mitchell's conduct should continue to be such as to prevent the
proper discharge of his duties, or if he should be guilty of
insubordination or should withhold from the Governor the assistance he
should properly give, Fitzroy should suspend him and Grey would dismiss
him from his position in the Colonial Service.</p>

<p>While these discussions were proceeding, another matter provoked
censure on Mitchell's conduct. As stated in chapter XI, .Kennedy had been
sent to follow the course of the Barcoo (Victoria) River. He had returned
from this journey at the end of 1847, but in 1848 had been commissioned
by Governor Fitzroy to lead an exploring expedition in northern
Queensland. This journey ended tragically, for Kennedy was killed by the
aborigines.</p>

<p>Mitchell was not in any way concerned with this expedition as he was,
all the time, in England: but on his return to Sydney he wrote a
memorandum addressed to the Governor in terms quite inconsistent with the
respect due to the head of the Government. He objected to being held
responsible for an expedition undertaken without his advice and
concurrence: he criticized the plan of operations, and in general dealt
with the whole matter in a way which provoked Fitzroy to say, in a
despatch to Grey (10 October 1850):</p>

<blockquote>I consider the reflection which Sir Thomas Mitchell has
thought proper to cast on the Government's conduct uncalled for and in a
high degree offensive to myself.[27]</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell had requested that this offensive document should be
forwarded to the Minister at the Colonial Office. The Colonial Secretary
notified Mitchell (24 April 1850) that a copy of his letter would be
forwarded to London but that the Governor</p>

<blockquote>was not prepared to submit to being addressed by the head of
any department or other public officer serving under him in terms of
censure. His Excellency will therefore request His Lordship to take steps
to secure him from having such uncalled for and offensive observations as
those contained in your letter addressed to him with
impunity.</blockquote>

<p>Upon receipt and consideration of all the papers Grey wrote to Fitzroy
in these terms (25 April 1851):</p>

<blockquote>I entirely concur with you in thinking it an act of great
impropriety that a subordinate officer, because the opinions he
entertains concerning an important public proceeding have not been
followed by his superiors, should write a letter containing an elaborate
and acrimonious attack on the policy adopted by them, and should ask to
have this letter sent home as a sort of protest against what they have
done. There is the less excuse for Sir Thomas Mitchell's having allowed
himself thus to give way to the feelings of irritation under which he
seems to have acted, because, in the measures which he condemns, his
advice had not been overruled since his absence from the Colony for
objects of his own had rendered it impossible that it should be asked for
before those measures were determined upon. As to the merits of those
measures, it is quite unnecessary to require any further evidence than is
furnished by the very able vindication furnished in your despatch, and by
the weight of eminent authorities whose counsel you followed.*<br>
<br>
At your intercession I content myself on this occasion with approving the
rebuke you have conveyed to Sir Thomas Mitchell, but I must at the same
time instruct you to inform him that if he should think proper to engage
in opposition to the measures of the Government which it is his duty to
serve, or should indulge in intemperate remarks to his superiors, he must
hold himself prepared for immediate dismissal from his office as he
cannot be permitted to retain it under such circumstances.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b">[* The persons whose opinions were consulted were
Sturt, Eyre, Gipps, P. P. King, Owen Stanley and Stokes.]</blockquote>

<p>Thus a period of twenty years ended as it began. Darling in 1831 spoke
of Mitchell's "ill and ungovernable temper", and Secretary of State
Goderich regretted the tone of Mitchell's correspondence with the local
Governor.</p>

<p>In 1851 the Under-Secretary at the Colonial Office recorded that</p>

<blockquote>Mitchell had behaved intemperately towards every Governor
under whom he has served, and probably nothing will ever check his
irascible temper,</blockquote>

<p>and Secretary of State Grey issued a stringent warning to Mitchell
that continuation of this behaviour would produce immediate
dismissal.</p>

<p>So, twice within twelve months, Mitchell was seriously threatened with
dismissal by the Secretary of State himself, and would be forced to
realize that all hope of advancement or reward, or any other mark of
official recognition from the Colonial Office had ended.</p>

<p>Now Mitchell was left without further exploratory prospects: the
publication of his book on the fourth expedition had brought no
enthusiastic response, and the "whole territory" offered no field from
which he could hope to win applause and honour. The "interior" was so
unattractive, and the prospect of a great river to the gulf so
unpromising, that he deputed this task to Kennedy. Leichhardt had
anticipated him in the one region in which notable discoveries had been
possible, and he was left with only the prime duties of a Surveyor
General: even this was soon to be reduced in scope by the appointment of
a Surveyor General of Victoria, Hoddle being appointed to that position
on 15 July 1851. Mitchell was now fifty-seven years old.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV - The Last Years 1849-1855</h2>

<p>The last seven years of Mitchell's life were active; but concerning
them only disconnected information is available. Before discussing this
period, it is convenient here to go back a little to discuss a
controversy having important implications.</p>

<p>The establishment of a settlement at Port Phillip and the rapid
extension of squatting south of the Murray soon involved some form of
delegated administration. Bourke himself visited Port Phillip in 1837,
and had established Latrobe as a resident administrator. Some definition
of the Port Phillip district was necessary: the first definition of the
northern boundary was, tentatively, the Murrumbidgee River with a line
continued to the coast about Moruya.1 This, however, was not adopted when
a final decision was made. The eastern boundary of South Australia had
been fixed by Imperial Statute at 141&deg; east longitude. When the
necessity for separate administration of the Port Phillip district had
become great enough to receive serious consideration, the question of
boundaries naturally received attention. Sir George Grey, who was then
Governor of South Australia, wrote (September 1844) to the Home
Government suggesting that the boundary between South Australia and
Victoria should be altered, and should be the Glenelg River to its
source, thence to the source of, and along, the Wimmera, along a
northward line to the Darling-Murray junction, then northwards along the
Darling.2 This suggestion was made by Grey, because he, as the
responsible executive in South Australia, had found difficulty in
establishing the eastern limits of the area under his control, the
boundary line being nowhere visibly marked over open plain country: he
therefore suggested identifiable geographical features. The proposed line
was, quite obviously, suggested by Mitchell's map in the published
account of his three expeditions: no other source of such information was
available to Grey. Mitchell, on being consulted about this proposal,
suggested an alternative--that the Murray River throughout its course to
the sea, should be the eastern boundary of South Australia. Neither of
these proposals was adopted and the boundary has remained as originally
defined. Gipps, throughout the progress of events from 1840 to 1847, was
anticipating the separation of Victoria and Queensland from the original
territory of New South Wales.</p>

<p>Mitchell's active mind never seemed to be at rest. He produced in 1849
a pamphlet "Notes on the Cultivation of Vine and Olive". In 1850, at the
request of the Denominational Board of Education, he prepared an
<i>Australian Geography with the shores of the Pacific Ocean and those of
the Indian Ocean designed for the use of schools in New South Wales</i>.
An interesting feature of this work is that it showed Australia in the
centre, so that its relation to other countries could be appreciated, and
so that</p>

<blockquote>the serial arrangements derived from the apparent course of
the sun should connect all ideas of locality with our true position on
the planet. The natural divisions of land and water, the established
dependence of one part of the world upon another, for their mutual
intercourse, for their necessary supplies, or for their luxurious
gratifications--and viewed with reference to the insular situation of
Australia--are what the author has attempted briefly to sketch in this
book.</blockquote>

The London <i>Athenaeum</i> (4 December 1850) in reviewing this book laid
particular stress on the "clear, pure, and nervous English" in which it
was written. In 1851 appeared a second edition of this work, with an
appendix containing an account of the recent discovery of gold.

<p>In the year 1851 occurred a dramatic incident: a duel between Mitchell
and Mr Stuart Donaldson. This was the last duel fought in Australia. The
date was 27 September 1851. The story can best be told as recorded in the
<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> of 30 September 1851: slight amendments, but
without material alteration, have been made to secure continuity of the
text.</p>

<p>It was generally known in Sydney that a hostile meeting had taken
place between Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Thomas Livingstone Mitchell and Mr
Stuart A. Donaldson, M.L.C. The correspondence which appeared in the
<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> explained the origin of the
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>On the occasion of Mr Donaldson's speech on the hustings at the
election for the county of Durham he was reported to have complained that
the Surveyor General's Department cost &pound;40,000 per annum. In a
letter which Sir Thomas Mitchell addressed to the <i>Herald</i>, he
contradicted Mr Donaldson's statement, and added that "he left the public
to stamp its own reprobation upon a monstrous charge so falsely or so
carelessly made to his prejudice". Upon the appearance of the letter Mr
Dobie, on behalf of Mr Donaldson, demanded the withdrawal of the word
"falsely", and was referred by Sir Thomas to Lieutenant Burrowes.</p>

<p>After some conferences two notes were exchanged by these gentlemen in
the names of their respective friends. Mitchell (26 September 1851)
withdrew the words "charges so falsely" in his letter to the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i> of that date. He regretted having used them, feeling
assured that Donaldson did not mean to say that the department cost
&pound;40,000 per annum. Donaldson replied (26 September 1851) that the
remarks made by him on the hustings at the nomination for the county of
Durham with reference to the control and administration of the Crown
lands applied to the expenditure in the management of such lands in
general, of which the Surveyor General's Department formed only a
portion, and not to the Surveyor General's Department alone, such
expenditure (amounting to upwards of &pound;40,000 per annum) being
withdrawn by Acts of the Imperial Parliament from the control of the
local legislature.</p>

<p>These notes were forwarded by Mr Dobie and Lieutenant Burrowes to the
<i>Herald</i> for publication, and it was hoped that such mutual
explanation had ended this unpleasant affair. It seems, however, that
Lieutenant Burrowes had drawn up Sir Thomas Mitchell's note in a manner
which did not meet his approval, for upon Sir Thomas perceiving this he
addressed the following note to Mr Donaldson:</p>

<blockquote>8 a.m., Carthona<br>
27 September 1851<br>
<br>
Sir,<br>
<br>
In the note Mr Dobie delivered to me yesterday you observe that mine sent
to you from hence is no answer to yours. I wish it to be considered the
only reply I meant to give you.<br>
<br>
I wholly disapprove of the notes since proposed and exchanged between
that gentleman and my friend who happened to be at hand yesterday; and I
hasten to say that I am now on my way to see a friend who will, I trust,
endeavour to place this matter on a more satisfactory footing than it has
yet arrived at.<br>
<br>
I am, etc.,<br>
<br>
THOMAS L. MITCHELL.</blockquote>

<p>Sir Thomas again had recourse to the advice of Lieutenant Burrowes
who, with Mr Dobie, endeavoured once more to adjust the matters in
dispute. However, the omission or the retention of an apparently trifling
word in the proposed draft of another note on the part of Sir Thomas was
found to be a difficulty which neither of the principals would remove,
and a hostile meeting was declared the only alternative. Both parties met
at half-past four on Saturday afternoon at a secluded spot near the Water
Reserve, Sir Thomas attended by Lieutenant Burrowes, and Mr Donaldson by
Mr Dobie. They each exchanged three shots, and in the last fire a ball
passed through Mr Donaldson's hat, and another within an inch of Sir
Thomas' throat. The seconds then interfered and the combatants left the
ground.</p>

<p>In 1851 Mitchell was instructed to make a report on, and survey of,
the goldfields districts. This report was presented to the Legislative
Council in February 1852.[3]</p>

<p>Mitchell had not been long back in Sydney from his second visit to
England, when he developed an entirely new interest. He conceived the
idea that the principle of the aboriginal boomerang could be applied to
the propeller of steamships. On 3 December 1850, he read a paper before
the Philosophical Society in Sydney, setting forth his theory. A
propeller built according to his specifications was experimentally fitted
to a small vessel and given a trial on Sydney Harbour.</p>

<p>Fitzroy wrote to Secretary of State Pakington (26 August 1852) that a
trial trip on Sydney Harbour with a steamer fitted with this propeller
had proved successful and that Mitchell had applied for leave of absence
for one year to go to England "with a view of securing, if possible, for
himself some profit from a patent right to its use which he had held for
some years".[4] He said that Mitchell was willing to leave the question
of payment of half salary, while on leave, for decision after his arrival
in England. The Executive Council in New South Wales, being of opinion
that the discovery was likely to prove of great importance and value, had
approved of the leave, on the terms as to salary suggested by Mitchell.
The Legislative Council had, however, presented an address to Fitzroy
recommending that Mitchell should be paid full salary during leave.
Fitzroy forwarded this suggestion recommending it for Pakington's
favourable consideration. Upon these papers being received at the
Colonial Office, Merivale submitted to Secretary of State Newcastle (who
had succeeded Pakington) an official minute which contained these
passages:</p>

<blockquote>Once more Mitchell has found means of getting away from the
Colony, and not only this but has also managed to procure an address from
the Legislative Council praying that he may be allowed full salary during
his absence. I append to this minute a series of extracts from despatches
which it has been necessary to write about Mitchell during the last three
years. The first of these extracts will show for what long periods he
contrived to absent himself from his duties, sometimes in the teeth of a
positive refusal to sanction his leave. The remaining extracts will show
the insubordinate conduct and intemperate language into which he allowed
himself to be betrayed to the Colonial Government. Mitchell is a clever
man but in our minutes one must speak unreservedly. I am bound to say
that he appears to me as turbulent and self-indulgent an officer as can
be. Twice in the course of two years it has been necessary to threaten
him with dismissal...The Legislative Council is deserving of all respect,
but it steps much beyond its province in meddling with Executive
government in pure matters of administration. Perhaps, in view of their
recommendation, the Secretary of State may so far yield as to grant leave
on half-salary.</blockquote>

<p>This was approved by Newcastle.</p>

<p>Mitchell had booked passage by the <i>Roman Emperor</i> in August
1852, but became ill and was not able to leave Sydney until 21 September
1852, when he sailed on the <i>Phoenician</i>. As his leave had been
granted by Fitzroy in August, he thus lost one month of his leave.</p>

<p>He wrote a poem "Farewell" which is presumed to have been written on
the occasion of his departure from Australia at this time. From this poem
are taken the following extracts:</p>

<pre>
Deep, deep in thy rocks, 0 Australia,
I carved out my Sovereign's name;
By the side of the banished but faithful,
I climbed up the steep hill of fame.

Farewell to thy deserts, Australia,
My centaurs who swept o'er them are gone;
Their bones bleach on hill and in valley,
Their dust in the hot wind is blown.

Cold under the snows of Monera
And deep beneath wild Ocean's waves,
My two sons whilst serving Australia
Have both found untimely graves.

Yet I leave thee in sorrow, Australia,
Thou field of my toils and my tears;
May those reap in joy I shall send thee
And be English through thousands of years.[5]
</pre>

<p>The reference to the carving of his Sovereign's name is to the Mt.
Victoria road. His desire for fame was a recurring theme throughout his
career. One of the sons, Campbell, had died on 16 July 1846 as stated
earlier while surveying in the Snowy Ranges: the other, Roderick, the
second son, had been appointed to command an expedition in search of
Leichhardt, but, travelling from Newcastle by sea, he fell overboard and
was drowned on 28 August 1852. This alone provides evidence that the poem
could not have been written before that year.</p>

<p>On the homeward journey in the <i>Phoenician</i>, Mitchell used some
of his spare time in translating the Lusiad of Camoens from the original
Portuguese: he had carried the translation as far as the end of the
eighth canto when he reached England. He completed the ninth and tenth
cantos while in England. This translation was published the following
year (1854) by T. and W. Boone in an attractive little volume. It was
dedicated to the Earl of Dundonald. In a preface dated 9 December 1853
Mitchell writing, as author, in the third person said:</p>

<blockquote>As some apology for the rough chisseling of the work, if he
may use the expression, he must state also under what circumstances the
most of it came into shape. These were chiefly, under water, in a small
clipper, during a voyage round Cape Horn.</blockquote>

<p>The volume contains a drawing by Mitchell of the Fountain of Tears:
the reference is to stanza cxxxv in the Portuguese version of the
<i>Lusiad</i>.[6]</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival in England he wrote to Newcastle (6 January
1853) asking for official support with the Admiralty in respect of his
invention.[7] The invention was referred to the Admiralty on 14 January
for an opinion as to its merits.</p>

<p>On 25 January 1853, he protested against the decision that he was to
receive only half salary and asked for full salary.[8] On 31 January
1853, he wrote again contesting the references to his many periods of
leave, traversing the old familiar ground, from the Peninsular battle
plans and Sir George Murray onwards.[9] Finally, he tried a little
indirect pressure. He said, in a letter to Peel (3 March 1853), that he
had made a military survey of Port Jackson: that he had brought to
England all the data for completing this map, and that he would so
complete it, if the Colonial Office would meet the expense or,
alternatively, pay him full salary.[10] As this survey was an official
task done by him as Surveyor General the proposal was irregular,
especially as he conceded that the plates and impressions would, if his
conditions were accepted, become public property. The Colonial Office
notation on this says:</p>

<blockquote>This is both an inaccurate and an insolent expression.
Mitchell thinks to put the Government in a dilemma by professing to have
very valuable surveys and soundings and by offering to publish them if
the Government will but pay the expense or let him have his full salary.
I hardly like to enter fully into reasons why I should not recommend
compliance with this offer lest they should not seem
courteous.</blockquote>

<p>Mitchell's offer was not accepted.</p>

<p>Now began the familiar repetition of demands for extension of leave.
To have arrived back in Sydney before his leave had expired he should
have left England in April, but on 27 June 1853 he wrote to Newcastle
from 9 Suffolk Street, Pall Mall, asking for extension of leave,
assigning as reasons: his illness in Sydney had deprived him of one month
of leave; the trials of his propeller by the Admiralty at Portsmouth were
incomplete; he was engaged in preparing a map of Port Jackson from his
surveys and soundings.</p>

<p>The Colonial Office notation on his letter says plainly that it was
anticipated that Mitchell would ask for an extension of leave: it was
decided, however, that he would receive no pay at all when the twelve
months' period was ended, and he was asked how much leave he required.
Mitchell replied asking that his leave be extended to the end of 1853;
and the extension was granted without pay.</p>

<p>Newcastle took the unusual course of writing personally to Mitchell
(15 July 1853) referring to the previous occasions on which he had
flouted official decisions in respect of leave and said:</p>

<blockquote>You have already considerably outstayed the time which would
have rendered it possible for you to return to the colony within the
period of your original leave. It is also on record that the last time
you were in England you, in like manner, outstayed your leave before you
applied for its extension. I cannot observe these repeated irregularities
without express. ing regret that they should be committed by an officer
of your standing and long service.[12]</blockquote>

<p>There is an office minute on the draft of this letter prepared for
Newcastle's signature:</p>

<blockquote>Seeing Mitchell's steady and undeviating habits of
insubordination I trust this letter may not be considered too strong. I
am fully persuaded of two things: that he will not return to the colony
at the expiration of his original leave, and, in that case it would be
unjust to the officers who do the actual duties of his post, and
injurious to the public service if his place is not filled by a real
Surveyor General. But, if this is to be done, he ought to have fair
warning.</blockquote>

<p>Newcastle instructed Mitchell that he was to report to the Colonial
Office when he had taken his passage at a time which would enable him to
reach Sydney before the expiration of his leave at the end of December
1853. Then followed further correspondence. Mitchell wrote again on 26
September asking for a further two months' extension of leave, but was
informed that this could not be considered unless he produced a
certificate from the Admiralty that his further stay in England was of
importance to the public service. This, despite his efforts, Mitchell was
unable to do.[13] Independent enquiries from the Colonial Office had
revealed that the Admiralty was not satisfied as to the merits of
Mitchell's invention. Finally, Mitchell was definitely informed on 15
November that he must leave by the vessel leaving on 4 January 1854, or
forfeit his office as Surveyor General. He ultimately left by the Croesus
on 17 January 1854, nine months after the expiration of his original
leave. The official epilogue as recorded in the Colonial Office minutes
was:</p>

<blockquote>I felt pretty confident from the first that we should have
some more excuses and changes of purpose before this eccentric Surveyor
General should really start.</blockquote>

<p>This was the last occasion on which Mitchell had direct personal
contact in England with the Colonial Office.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that during this visit to England he had sought
to be employed on active military service in connexion with the Crimean
War which then appeared to be inevitable. There is a letter in which he
expresses the opinion that every soldier should be in this war; and there
is, in the Mitchell Library, a copy of an application in the year 1854 in
which he declares himself fit and ready for active service.[14]</p>

<p>While in England he had, on 22 June 1853, read a paper on the
boomerang propeller before the United Services Institution. He is
recorded as having feared that certain Liverpool people holding his
patents were "slippery", and that he had become accustomed "to the
rascally jobbing and impediments to his invention coming before the
public".[15]</p>

<p>This invention is hardly of historical interest to Australia; but it
did involve his absence from this country for another twenty months, and
there is ample written evidence that it largely engaged his enthusiasm at
that period.</p>

<p>At this period he used another method of supplementing his income.
Fitzroy had written to Secretary of State Pakington (30 August 1852)
stating that Mitchell had offered to sell to the Government the engraved
copper plates of his map of New South Wales (see <a href=
"#aa">earlier</a>) for &pound;300 "which he alleges, is a very small
price compared with what they cost him".[16] The Executive Council in New
South Wales had recommended this purchase, and Fitzroy supported the
recommendation. The Colonial Office notation (by Gairdner) was that the
chief object of this offer was to cover an unsuccessful speculation.
Ultimately the purchase was authorized by Secretary of State
Newcastle.</p>

<p>He arrived back in Australia in April or May 1854. On the return
journey to Australia there is evidence that he could, on occasion, be
light-hearted. The ship's magazine, The <i>Southern Cross and Antarctic
Gazette</i>, published a poem contributed by him on the occasion of the
death of a budgerigar, pet of one of the sailors:</p>

<pre>
Loud roared the storm around Cape Horn,
Severe the cold and snow;
The yards were broke, the sails were torn
And Jack aloft must go.
His bosom was the only home
Of feeble Budgery Gar,
And there it found a noble tomb:
The breast of British Tar.[17]
</pre>

<p>His poetic licence did not come under critical scrutiny until a little
later.</p>

<p>Writing from Sydney (21 July 1854) to his father-in-law, General
Blunt, he said:</p>

<blockquote>There is no officer...for whom the Colonial Office has shown
so decided an absolute hostility. This is a bitter reflection to me in my
old age in a colony where I am surrounded by the results of my surveys,
now almost ignored by those who have benefited by them--because the
Colonial Office has treated me so. The fate of Campbell tends still more
to embitter these reflections, and the treatment of my invention is still
worse.[18]</blockquote>

<p>In June 1854 Henry Parkes, who was controlling the Empire newspaper,
criticized Mitchell as being responsible for the existing defects in the
land system.[19] Parkes was then a member of the Legislative Council.
Mitchell wrote a private letter to Parkes:</p>

<blockquote>In order that you may obtain the most authentic information
respecting what has been intended, and what has been proposed, I enclose
a copy of the Royal Instructions of 1825, and I take the liberty of
suggesting that you could move in your place in Council for the
production of the Commissioner's Report under these instructions dated 2
September 1834: you would render a service to the public, and a kindness
to me, if you would cause the production of a document which would throw
light on what is very little understood.</blockquote>

<p>He was still harping on the old theme.</p>

<p>In the year 1855 (the date is uncertain) there appeared in Sydney a
long poem printed in pamphlet form, the title page of which is reproduced
here:</p>

<pre>
To
BOURKE'S STATUE
this
Appropriate Effusion
of
Unprofitable Brass
is
Unceremoniously dedicated
by
ICHNEUMON
Anxious to
Instruct his grandmothers
in
The Inductive Science
of
Sucking Eggs
</pre>

<p>The poems contained many rather personal, indeed scandalous,
references to prominent people, including certain passages obviously
referring to Mitchell.</p>

<pre>
See him of aspect dire and haughty gait,
As though himself were a triumvirate
Who dreams of honours, forges Boomerang screws
And wakes in anger Camoens lofty muse;
Who damns the language that cooked such rhyme
(To spoil the Lusiad were a heinous crime),
Your Childish choler but provokes a sneer
And makes you small, the very smallest beer.
With Sisyphic attempts Fame's temple try,
No niche is there for eccentricity;
High roads Colossus once was yours the power
To move each bullock team as coach and four;
Why did you fail when yours the ironed man
To make the "high hills hop" as hop'd Bashan?
Go grave your maps, in survey you succeed
Where praise is worthy, let me grant the meed:
Thousands of men and money shout for land,
But here as elsewhere work is at a stand.
</pre>

<p>At some time after the appearance of this pamphlet, Sir Charles
Nicholson wrote to Mitchell (22 August 1855) asking him to give his word
of honour as a gentleman and Christian that he had neither knowledge of,
nor share in the concoction or circulation of the verses known as
"Ichneumon".[21] If Mitchell would give this assurance Nicholson would
spare no trouble "to vindicate you against the aspersion under which you
labour". He added that Mitchell had said to George Macleay that he knew
the author to be Mitchell's own son. George Macleay had written stating
that Mitchell had said that from internal evidence he had been compelled
to arrive at the conviction that his own son was the author of it and
hoped he would never have to appear as a witness.[22] Mitchell replied to
Nicholson that he had never stated that he knew the author, but from
internal evidence he had his suspicions.[23]</p>

<p>This was all very disturbing. As to the date of publication, the
letter of Sir Charles Nicholson indicating that Mitchell was widely
suspected of being the author, suggests that the pamphlet could only have
appeared after Mitchell's return to Sydney in April or May 1854. The fact
that Nicholson did not write until August 1855 suggests that the pamphlet
had been published at a comparatively recent date.</p>

<p>There must surely have been some basis for the "aspersions" against
Mitchell. Sturt wrote to Stokes (both being in England at the time) and
referring to Mitchell said: "he is in general bad odour having lampooned
the government in an anonymous paper."[24] Sturt must have had this news
from some correspondent in Sydney.</p>

<p>It is distressing to read today the manuscripts in the Mitchell
Library which seem to be various drafts by Mitchell of the reply he would
send to Nicholson: they are evidence that Mitchell was under considerable
mental stress, and they raise in the mind of the reader some uncertainty
about the truth of the whole unhappy business.</p>

<p>This happened at the time when he was actually facing the
investigations of the Special Commission appointed by Governor Denison to
enquire into the whole field of his administration. Whoever wrote it, the
references to himself as a triumvirate, his failure in the matter of
roads and bridges, and the stagnation in the survey work, were
particularly pointed.</p>

<p>Writing from Sydney to his brother John in Scotland (8 July 1855) he
said:</p>

<blockquote>I may state that this new Governor General Sir William
Denison (a Captain of Engineers only) and supposed to be the cleverest
man in all the world--has been put wrong in the head by such elevation,
and manifests such an animus towards the Surveyor General and his whole
Department as must cause the removal of one of the two.<br>
<br>
But in my independence I have generally been at variance with Governors
although on the present occasion the fault is all on one side, and it , I
retire I am assured that full salary will be voted me as a pension.<br>
<br>
I am heartily tired of this country but my property is now worth
something and Lady Mitchell likes the country.<br>
<br>
I seem doomed to be all my life between extremes.[25]</blockquote>

In view of events which were to happen very soon there is tragedy in this
letter.

<p>It was written four days after Denison had appointed a Commission of
Enquiry. Denison was himself an engineer and, almost immediately after he
assumed duty as Governor on 20 January 1855, he concerned himself
actively with Mitchell's work. He submitted to Mitchell an extensive and
searching questionnaire covering the activities of, and the technical
methods used by, the Surveyor General's Department: Mitchell had
furnished answers to all these questions on 19 February. Amongst other
statements Mitchell claimed that he had made an accurate trigonometrical
survey.[26] Denison, being unsatisfied, placed these papers, with his
comments, before the Executive Council on I May; the Council recorded its
opinion that the work performed had not been what might reasonably have
been expected, that the cost to the public had been excessive, and that
the superintendence of the department was not sufficiently effective;
they added:</p>

<blockquote>In fact there are grounds even for doubting whether the
accuracy of the surveys conducted in the manner described in these papers
can be wholly relied on.</blockquote>

<p>The Executive Council decided that a full enquiry should be held, and
Denison, on 4 July, appointed a Royal Commission consisting of Professor
Pell, Professor of Mathematics at Sydney University; Captain Clarke,
R.E., Surveyor General in Victoria, and Captain Hawkins, R.E. The terms
of reference of the Royal Commission were very wide: after enumerating
seven distinct aspects for enquiry, the Commission ended:</p>

<blockquote>to make full and diligent enquiry into the present state of
the Survey Department and the details of the system on which the Survey
Department is conducted.</blockquote>

<p>The Commission concluded its report on 11 August: the report condemned
in severe terms the methods and results of Mitchell's surveying
activities, and his administration of the department. They began by
reviewing the methods of surveying used during the twenty-seven years of
Mitchell's administration. Reliance had been placed entirely upon angles
taken by theodolite from the summits of outstanding and recognizable
peaks: all subsequent action being based upon mathematical calculations.
Two base lines, each of 382 yards in length, were measured by means of
wooden rods on the shores of Botany Bay,* and another of one mile with
tent poles at Lake George.</p>

<blockquote class="b">[* This is the base line to which he referred in
his letter to his mother in 1828. (See <a href=
"#ff">earlier.</a>)]</blockquote>

<p>The Commission said that insufficient care seemed to have been taken
in the measurement of these base lines; nor was it clear in what way they
were used in the general survey, nor indeed with what intention they were
measured. The sides of some of the triangles were calculated, but the
Commission could not learn that, in the construction of the maps, any use
was made of the results so obtained: no complete diagram or set of
diagrams existed in the original triangulation: nor any record or
evidence showing in what degree the several angular measurements,
terrestrial and astronomical, were found to be consistent with one
another. The Commission expressed the opinion that it was impossible that
any great degree of accuracy in fixing the position of the angular
stations could have been secured by the methods used: only very
inadequate means were available for the determination of latitudes, and
the longitudes were solely dependent, by calculation, on that of
Parramatta. It was obvious, the Commission said, that a map, still
incomplete, constructed on such data, and in such a manner, though of
considerable value in delineating generally the features of the country
as a map. of reference, could not have any claim to the character of a
trigonometrical survey in the correct and ordinarily received acceptation
of the term; in fact there were grounds for doubting whether the accuracy
of the surveys conducted in the manner described could be wholly relied
on.</p>

<p>While expressing this adverse opinion of the map the Commission made
it clear that they did not wish in any way to detract from the intrinsic
merits of the map or to underrate the energy and determination with which
dangers were encountered and hardships endured in the course of the
surveys which led to its construction. They indicated that they did not
seek to imply censure upon the methods and policies of the past; but they
did wonder that no steps had been taken by the Government to carry out a
survey based on more accurate methods of observation: and they regretted
that there was no evidence vindicating the department from the charge of
never having recognized the need for a better system of survey.</p>

<p>Then the Commission dealt with the question of the private sale of
maps:</p>

<blockquote>Before passing on to other portions of our enquiry we must
call attention to the almost total absence of any recognized and
authentic public records of the combination of the data and materials
from which the published maps of the province are compiled...as well as
to the fact that these maps, which the Surveyor General considers of the
highest importance as official records of the work performed by the
department, and also of the greatest intrinsic value in delineating
accurately the topography of the country are those which he himself
compiled and published, not as a public servant but as a private
individual, his interest in them having recently been disposed of to the
Government.<br>
<br>
We have not thought it worth while to enquire more particularly into the
circumstances under which the publication of these maps took place, for
it is evident that if it was necessary or expedient, it should have been
carried out by the Government, and that under no circumstances should
they have failed to recognize the well-established and well-understood
rule that the results of the labour of a public officer in the discharge
of his duties are the property of the public alone.</blockquote>

<p>The system of licensed surveyors was wholly condemned, and, because of
lack of supervision, the amount of work done by the salaried surveyors
was small in proportion to their number. Most of the difficulties which
had been experienced could be attributed to a faulty system combined with
negligent administration. The amount of clerical labour was far greater
than the actual necessities of the case demanded. The laying out and
levelling of proposed roads both for main and ordinary lines of
communication were most important duties which required much more
attention than seemed to have been bestowed upon them. To carry out a
complete system of triangulation founded upon correctly measured bases
would be an undertaking, whatever its ultimate advantages, entirely
beyond the requirements and resources of the colony. At the same time
steps should be taken to initiate a general system of survey, upon a
measured base line gradually extending by triangulation.</p>

<p>They recorded the fact that the Surveyor General disclaimed all
responsibility for the acknowledged disorganization of the department,
maintaining that the system in operation was not of his own formation or
such as met with his approval; that he had been improperly interfered
with in the performance of his duties; and that he had not received the
support of the Government in endeavouring to maintain discipline and
efficiency. Upon this the Commission commented:</p>

<blockquote>We have repeatedly requested him to lay before us some
correspondence. or other documentary evidence which might illustrate and
confirm these statements: but nothing has been brought under our notice
from which it could be inferred that he has been in any case
unnecessarily interfered with: that the support of the Government has
been improperly withheld from him; or, although the Department had been
under his guidance for nearly thirty years, that any attempt has been
made by him, until very recently, to rectify alleged defects or to
introduce a system more in accordance with his views.<br>
<br>
He particularly complains that the time and energy of his surveyors have
been devoted to the measurement of pastoral runs, instead of to other
purposes more important, in his opinion, to the great interests of the
Colony. But we find that he himself insisted upon the necessity of the
surveys for the purpose of defining the boundaries of the runs.<br>
<br>
We feel called upon to bear testimony to the energy which has
characterized the personal efforts of the Surveyor General in carrying
out his general surveys, whatever may be the opinion which we have formed
as to their value; nor do we overlook the fact that many new districts
have been discovered and opened up, and much benefit thus conferred upon
the country by his exploratory expeditions as well as by the efforts of
his subordinates engaged upon "feature surveys".<br>
<br>
It appears to us, however, that the devotion of the Surveyor General to
feature and general surveys, and his long absences from the actual
supervision of his Department, have contributed materially to its
disorganization by withdrawing his attention from ordinary and more
immediately important duties connected with the transfer of land from the
Government to the settler.<br>
<br>
The alleged inefficiency of the Department seems also in great measure
attributable to the want of that mutual good feeling and cordial
cooperation between the Surveyor General and his officers, without which
it is impossible under any system, however excellent, that the duties of
the Department can be efficiently administered.<br>
<br>
Every possible assistance has been afforded to us in the conduct of our
enquiry by the Surveyor General and by every person to whom we have
applied.<br>
<br>
We have, nevertheless, experienced much difficulty and embarrassment from
the inconsistencies in the evidence of the Surveyor General and also from
the circumstances of his evidence having been materially modified,
altered, and enlarged.<br>
<br>
We feel compelled, in justice to curselves, to allude to these
inconsistencies on account of the difficulty which they have occasioned
us in arriving at a decision upon several points in our enquiry: at the
same time that we hope that they may fairly be attributed in some cases
to lapse of time, and in others to the multitude and complexity of the
subjects pressing upon his attention.</blockquote>

<p>The references to "long absences" was justified. Mitchell on his
journeys of exploration and visits to England had been absent from his
routine duties for a total of nine years, nearly one-third of his total
period of service.</p>

<p>This report was signed by the Commissioners on 11 August 1855. The day
before (10 August) Mitchell had written to Sur. veyor Davidson:</p>

<blockquote>We are standing our ground before a Board of Enquiry
here--very searching. I am exercising great patience by the kind advice
of all my friends.</blockquote>

<p>There is contemporary evidence of the distress which Mitchell
experienced during this enquiry. A. C. Gregory had been commissioned by
the Colonial Office to lead the North Australian expedition from the
Victoria River. He was instructed to assemble his party at Sydney. Being
delayed there because some of his party had not arrived he was asked by
the New South Wales Government to make a rapid journey in search of
evidence of the fate of Leichhardt's expedition of 1848: considering
whether this was possible in the time available, he consulted Mitchell as
to the nature of the country between the Darling Downs and the Barcoo
River:</p>

<blockquote>On stating my object to the Surveyor General and the nature
of the information I was desirous of obtaining he replied in a most
discourteous manner, "I suppose you have come here to do better than we
can: I am busy with my plans and have no time to give you any
information." I then requested to be informed whether, though he was so
much engaged, I could obtain any information relative to the country from
any other person in his department, to which he replied, "The Survey
Department has something of more importance to attend
to."[28]</blockquote>

<p>While discourtesy is never justifiable, Mitchell's irritable condition
at that time can be appreciated.</p>

<p>The Commission's report was ordered by the Legislative Assembly to be
printed on 23 November 1855. Mitchell had died on 5 October
preceding.</p>

<p>On 12 October 1855 Denison wrote a despatch to Secretary of State
Russell advising him of Mitchell's death, and next day, 13 October,
Denison forwarded the report of the Royal Commission with this
comment:</p>

<blockquote>I do not feel called on to express any opinion as to the
causes which have led to such a disorganization of the Survey Department,
neither is it necessary for me to impute blame to
anyone.[29]</blockquote>

<p>Upon receipt of Denison's despatch in the Colonial Office, an official
minute (by Gairdner) was attached to the papers:</p>

<blockquote>This report shows very much what might have been expected
that with originally a very imperfect education and with frequent
absences of the Surveyor General from the charge of his department, the
survey of the Colony has been very much neglected and very imperfectly
performed.</blockquote>

<p>This judgment by the Royal Commission, and this unhappy epitaph in the
Colonial Office seem, in retrospect, to have given less than proper value
to the circumstances. It is quite unjust to describe Mitchell as
imperfectly educated; his writings contain contrary proof. During the
first ten years of Mitchell's service as Surveyor General the boundaries
of occupied territory had expanded from the Darling Downs to Bass Strait,
and far to the west. Squatters were settling everywhere, and acquiring,
under the constantly changing land policy, the right to purchase the land
they had occupied. This led to a vigorous demand for surveys or
boundaries over an almost limitless area of continental magnitude.
Personal influence was, without doubt, attempted or used to secure
priority in survey. Mitchell referred to this in his statements to the
Royal Commission. Hoddle was surveying the pastoral runs of Moore,
Campbell, Murray, and Sturt in the Australian Capital Territory, two
hundred miles from Sydney, as early as 1832 and 1835.[30]</p>

<p>It was impossible for Mitchell to make an accurate trigonometrical
survey, as he claimed, over the whole of this region in the time and with
the resources available. He might well have been less emphatic on this
aspect, while claiming credit for what he had achieved. He had personally
traversed the length and breadth of "the whole territory" on his four
expeditions and numerous shorter journeys. He had followed and plotted
rivers: he had ascended very many peaks. He had been methodical in this
work and had produced a feature map on which all the main geographical
features were noted. A reasonable test would be a comparison between his
recorded positions for each of the two points most distant from Sydney,
the Alice-Barcoo junction and the mouth of the Glenelg River, with their
positions on modern maps; these are substantially in accord; when all the
conditions under which he travelled and made his observations are
considered, his accuracy was remarkable. The Commission might well have
given more generous recognition to this general mapping of the territory.
Many squatters and settlers must have been grateful.</p>

<p>As to the marking out of the great roads, for which Mitchell received
much praise, and on which he many times based his claims for recognition,
it is only necessary to say that all are agreed that this praise was
fully deserved: he was wise and skilled in practical topography.</p>

<p>The story of the Great Western Highway has been told earlier in this
volume: the main southern highway follows today, in all material
respects, the line he planned, although he was not satisfied with the
section over the Razorback Range north of Picton. There is evidence that
in 1851 he tried to have the road through Campbelltown and Appin to
Picton adopted as the main south road.[31] This would have passed through
his property at Wilton, by way of Broughton's Pass and Pheasant's Nest.
He stated his opinion that it was the "true south road" and its
construction would be a great public advantage: it would avoid the steep
crossing of the Razorback, although it involved two rough crossings of
the Nepean River. A Bill was actually introduced before the Legislative
Council in November 1851 to give effect to this proposal but was not
passed.</p>

<p>Under the hovering cloud of the adverse report on his life's work
came, unexpectedly, the end of Mitchell's dramatic story. Having
contracted a chill when supervising the survey of a road from Braidwood
to Nelligen, he developed broncho-pneumonia and died at his home,
"Carthona" (<a href="#p15">Plate XV</a>), at Darling Point on 5 October
1855, in his sixty-fourth year.</p>

<p>Governor Denison ordered that his death should be notified in a
special issue of the <i>Government Gazette</i> on the day (6 October)
following his death.</p>

<blockquote>The Governor with a desire to shew every respect for the
memory of Sir Thomas Mitchell invites all the civil officers of the
Government to attend the funeral. Sir Thomas Mitchell will be buried with
full military honours.</blockquote>

<p>His grave is in the churchyard of St. Stephen's Church, Newtown. The
headstone bears as emblems of his life work a sword, a pen, and laurel
wreaths.</p>

<p>His brother, Houston, had left Australia and had returned to Jamaica.
His wife, Lady Mitchell, survived him for many years.</p>

<p>In the Legislative Assembly of Victoria a proposal was made on 28
February 1860 that a pension of &pound;200 per annum should be paid to
Lady Mitchell</p>

<blockquote>as an acknowledgement of the public services of Sir Thomas
Mitchell in his discovery and exploration of the territory named by him
"Australia Felix" now the Colony of Victoria.[32]</blockquote>

<p>The proposal was not adopted.</p>

<p>The eldest son Livingstone was managing the Parkhall property.[33] In
the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> of 15 December 1853 appears an
advertisement under his name warning persons against</p>

<blockquote>tampering with my engaged German immigrants, employing them
on Sunday, hiring their wives, thus causing them to neglect their
families and the men their work.</blockquote>

<p>He married Catherine Macalister, sister of Captain Macalister. Richard
was engaged in the office of the Crown Solicitor in Sydney. The other
four sons had died. Of the daughters, Emily married Lord Audley whose
baronetage was of thirteenth century creation. Alicia married Philip
Dauncey and Camilla married J. F. Mann, a surveyor of English family
lineage. Emily and Camilla were married at a double wedding at St. Mark's
Church, Darling Point, Sydney, on 16 April 1857.[34]</p>

<p>Mann had been with Leichhardt on the abortive expedition of 1847:
later, in 1844, he had accompanied Commodore Erskine in H.M.S.
<i>Nelson</i> when Erskine went to proclaim a protectorate over
Papua.[35] His son, G. V. F. Mann, was Director of the Art Gallery in
Sydney for many years.</p>

<p>By his will Mitchell had bequeathed his property "Parkhall" to his son
Thomas, who however had not lived to inherit it. After Mitchell's death
it remained vacant for some years, and in 1867 was bought by Dr Jenkins
who renamed it "Nepean Towers". It is now the Apostolic School of the
Society of Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, and has been renamed "St.
Mary's Towers".</p>

<p>The surveying instruments used by Mitchell were presented to the
National Library at Canberra.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV - Epilogue</h2>

<p>Mitchell undertook to serve his country as a public servant. He
accepted the threefold obligation defined by Bacon as quoted <a href=
"#gg">earlier</a> in this volume--to serve the Sovereign or State, to
serve fame, and to serve business. Serving the Sovereign or. State
usually means for the public servant the faithful discharge of policies
which serve the self-interest of the Ministers of State, which, in turn
generally, but not always, means that the public servant is serving his
own material interests. But the public servant is the servant of the
public, that is, properly interpreted, the servant of the State.</p>

<p>The dilemma is clear enough: shall the public servant follow the
dictates of his conscience and press for the policy which he knows will
be right and best for the State and for the efficient discharge of
business, even if he knows it will be against his own interests; or shall
he complacently acquiesce in the decisions of a higher authority, and so
serve his own interests even if he knows that the prescribed policy is
inconsistent with the welfare of the people, and irreconcilable with his
professional conscience. In either case fame is so elusive and unstable
that its deliberate pursuit must always be an uncertain course. Bacon's
own career provides an excellent illustration of the inevitable conflict
between these three purposes. Very few in the past have succeeded, as
Pepys seems shrewdly to have done, in finding the solution to this
problem.</p>

<p>Under modern conditions a workable solution to this age-old problem
has been devised, but in Mitchell's day this was not so. With patronage
essential to advancement in the public service, with ultimate authority
arbitrarily, often unjustly, exercised, the public servant who honestly
wished to do his public service faithfully--and even, on a lower
platform, serve his own interests--had no other course open than vigorous
and persistent presentation of his opinions or his claims.</p>

<p>It is essential that these contemporary conditions should be
remembered in estimating (if indeed it is possible to form any accurate
estimate) the qualities and the public activities of this remarkable man,
one of the most remarkable men in our national history. A man of strong
character, intolerant of incompetence, impatient when opposed, these he
was, as are most strong men., As a strong man usually is, he was
sometimes right, sometimes wrong, sometimes wise, sometimes not so
wise.</p>

<p>Instructed to carry out an impossible task, that of dividing the whole
of the mainland east of the present boundary of Western Australia into
delineated counties, hundreds, and parishes, he did, in fact, achieve so
much of this task as was from time to time necessary to keep pace with
advancing settlement.</p>

<p>Committed by his own declaration in 1828 to the necessity for a
trigonometrical survey, which indeed would seem to have been
indispensably necessary for the desired division of the country, he was
adjudged twenty-seven years later to have failed in the completion of
this task. This, however, is a matter of interpretation: the Commission
was considering an exact survey from a measured base line with the sides
and angles of all triangles carefully recorded in a progressive serial
triangulation. This is the correct and established method, but over a
continental area and with a limited staff this was an impossible task for
Mitchell. The Commission itself declared that such a task was beyond the
requirements and resources of the colony. He was obliged to make his
trigonometrical survey by angles as from one prominent feature to
another. It must reasonably be accepted that, under the prevailing
conditions of uncontrolled expansion of occupation by pastoralist
squatters, general feature surveys were all that was possible. The
Commission recognized this and fully appreciated the value of this aspect
of his work.</p>

<p>It may not be denied that the measurements and the fixation of points
were not always accurate. A. C. Gregory, who was the first Surveyor
General in Queensland, recorded in 1885 that about 1850 Mitchell began a
trigonometrical survey of Moreton Bay and the Darling Downs:</p>

<blockquote>but the imperfections in the measurement of the base-line on
the Normanby plains by the use of hardwood bars of ten-foot lengths, the
small size of the theodolites, and somewhat unfavourable selection of the
trigonometrical stations, combined with the death of Surveyor Burnet,
left the work in such an imperfect state as not to be of much
value.[1]</blockquote>

<p>It is difficult, however, to dismiss the suspicion that Denison's
haste in instituting a searching enquiry into Mitchell's administration
as one of his first acts within a few days of assuming the post of
Governor was prompted by motives less innocent than a desire to secure
efficiency in the Surveyor General's Department.</p>

<p>The roads which Mitchell plotted are still monuments to his skill as a
surveyor, and the Victoria Pass provides an example of an executive
officer trusting his professional skill in opposition to the autocratic
instructions of the Governor--thus serving the State (or the business)
instead of the Sovereign where a conflict was necessary.</p>

<p>As Surveyor General, as a public officer, the nation should always
honour his name for the work which he did during a very difficult,
critical period in our history. If it was severely criticized in 1855 by
the standards of that period, it was, nevertheless, faithfully done
according to the only standards that were possible under the earlier
conditions.</p>

<p>It is possible to give differing verdicts on his explorations: his
first and second expeditions added little to knowledge except to his own;
the third and fourth expeditions made valuable additions to knowledge,
and replaced speculation with certainty, over very large regions of the
continent. It is probable that elements of professional rivalry were not
absent from the motives inducing the first two expeditions; but the third
and fourth were conducted with all the inspiration of the true explorer
and at the express direction of a higher authority. His geographical
acumen and prescience were of a high order, although exception must be
made in respect of his pronouncements as to the fate of the Barcoo River,
when other motives seem to have intruded. His prolonged absences on these
expeditions in the pursuit of fame were inconsistent with sustained
supervision of his department.</p>

<p>As to other aspects of his career, a rather more critical attitude is
necessary. There is no evidence that he was popular, as Sturt was, with
his subordinates in either the office or the field. His attacks on his
deputy, Perry, seem as far as available evidence goes, to have been
unworthy and without justification. He does not seem to have absorbed the
basic principle of public service efficiency that the executive head of a
department must work through his subordinates, accepting responsibility
for official mistakes, and giving the fullest possible degree of
responsibility and credit to his subordinate officers. On the other hand
there is evidence that these officers did not invariably in the earlier
years give evidence of a sensitive official conscience: in the later
years many of his officers gave faithful and efficient service.</p>

<p>The final evidence--lamentably too final--of his tendency to do
everything himself was his personal presence, in his sixty-fourth year,
at the survey of a road through that rugged Clyde Mountain region: work
which might well have been entrusted to his surveyors.</p>

<p>His petulant treatment of Sturt at the beginning and of Gregory at the
end of his career can hardly be condoned, although the circumstances at
the time should be remembered.</p>

<p>By contrast he maintained, throughout his life, an unbroken friendship
with Hamilton Hume. He wrote to Hume in 1841 recalling that Hume had
given him his first wide view of the colony from the summit of the Blue
Mountains "and entertained me hospitably in your tent while I was still a
stranger to the land of the gum trees". Again, in 1851, he wrote to Hume:
"The public ought to esteem you as much as I do. The career of discovery
and the path of truth all lead in one direction, as you have always shown
your fellow colonists, and your old fellow-traveller and very sincere
friend."[2]</p>

<p>His persistent defiance of successive Governors, his determined
reliance upon Royal instructions as the basis of his claim for
independent authority, and his sustained conflicts with the Colonial
Office during his periods of leave in London suggest that obstinacy too
often outran discretion.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand his obstinate obsession, through
repeated official contradictions and reprimands, that he was invested,
directly by the King in person, with an authority independent of all
established constitutional obligations. Even allowing for a natural fiery
independence, and a deep and unconquerable conviction that he was always
right, that what he was doing was, in spite of all opposition, the right
thing to do, he was too intelligent to be unaware that in accepting a
civil service position he had accepted certain obligations of duty to
higher authorities; that he had, in that position, committed himself to
the discharge of routine duties. Nor was it possible for him to be
ignorant of the fact that the collective pressure of civil service
officialdom is invariably too strong for the single individual to
challenge.</p>

<p>The pursuit of fame was his repeatedly declared objective; he pursued
it in too many directions, he would have gained it with less. He had all
the qualities which command success but failed by demanding too much.</p>

<p>He has pronounced his own verdict: writing to his brother John three
months before his death: "I seem doomed to be all my life between
extremes."</p>

<p>The circumstances of the time should not be forgotten. The rapid
evolution in the social system, with adjustments in official attitudes,
both in England and Australia, presented difficulties of unusual
complexity; the constant official conflicts, the deaths of his sons, his
financial difficulties, must have disturbed his mind at times when 'quiet
reflection would have been wise. 'Through it all the devotion of his wife
should be remembered.</p>

<p>This is the perplexing enigma of this notable figure in our history.
He was endowed by nature with unusual intellectual gifts. His published
volumes provide evidence of intelligent reading over a very wide range;
they contain more than sixty references to, or quotations from, classical
sources (including Herodotus, Homer, Ovid, Virgil, Tacitus, Ossian), from
Shakespeare, Milton, and Burns, as well as many quotations, all aptly
used, from the Bible, from Spanish, Portuguese, and Persian sources, and
many from unacknowledged sources.</p>

<p>He had great skill as an artist; he used written language with
accuracy and emphasis, although not always with discretion; his physical
restlessness urged him to continual action, while his mental alertness
impelled him to ceaseless exploration in new fields of thought and
action. He was, in intellectual qualities, ;o superior to most of his
contemporaries in the colony that he was, for these qualities at least,
respected then as he is still: ndeed, he could not otherwise have
successfully defied the Colonial Office and the local Governors for
twenty-seven years.</p>

<p>He was always conscious of, and never doubted, this superiority: :his
egoism, however, contained within itself the defects of his
personality--vanity, jealousy, insubordination: but his personality and
character cannot be concisely or precisely defined, cannot be fitted
neatly into any category; the record must speak for itself.</p>

<h2><a name="appb"></a>APPENDIX B</h2>

<p><b>Darling to Murray - 28 March 1831</b></p>

<p>If it should be asked why I did not represent Major Mitchell's
proceedings, I will, Sir, frankly confess that I was deterred from doing
so from a feeling that I had not received that support, which I conceived
I had a claim to in other cases, and that every failure in this respect
must tend more and more to weaken the Government and might induce others
to follow Major Mitchell's example.</p>

<p>His ill and ungovernable temper render him an impracticable servant of
the Government. I should have considered it my indispensable duty to
suspend him from office; but as it was not impossible that some
inconvenience might be occasioned at the moment, it appeared to the
Council and myself the safer course to put up with the contumely we had
experienced, rather than incur the responsibility of removing him.</p>

<p>I am constrained to observe, which I do with extreme deference and
reluctance, that the injury is incalculable, which this Government has
sustained by the course hitherto adopted on similar occasions. Had a
different line been pursued I have no doubt I should have been spared the
necessity of bringing Major Mitchell's name under your notice. I once
more, Sir, entreat you to consider the peculiar nature of this Colony and
the character and description of several of the indidivuals who have been
sent out to fill appointments here.</p>

<p>If the local Government is not supported, but should be left exposed
to the cavillings of every factious malcontent, or be subject without
redress to the insolence and opposition of its immediate servants, a
state of things will arise ere long, which may be regretted when too
late.</p>

<p>You will not, Sir, I trust, impute to me a proneness to complain
without cause. I some time since determined never to make another
representation. The gross misconduct of some of the officers compelled me
notwithstanding to bring their names under your notice...In the case of
Major Mitchell I have used every possible forbearance and have
remonstrated with him both personally and by letter without effect, which
would hardly have been the case had he seen that I possessed any weight
or influence: but fully aware of the contrary from the result of former
representations, he appears satisfied that he incurred little risk in
acting as others had done before him.</p>

<p>I have declined permitting Major Mitchell to return Home on leave. I
did not suspend him from office only from an apprehension that some
inconvenience might possibly be occasioned by his discontinuing to act:
the same reason would prevent me granting him leave of absence: but there
is still a stronger and I trust he will not be permitted to return Home,
retaining his office, until the matter now at issue is determined.</p>

<p><b>Darling to Goderich - 26 July 1831</b></p>

<p>I cannot abstain from noticing the passage in Your Lordship's despatch
in which you state that "the misunderstandings and dissensions" which
have occurred in New South Wales render it advisable for the King's
Service that I should be relieved. Surely, My Lord, you do not allude to
occurrences now some years gone by: but if Your Lordship does allude to
them may I not ask if it be just to make me responsible.</p>

<p>I have no desire to exaggerate the difficulties I have had to contend
with nor do I lay any claim to infallibility. If I have erred, surely, My
Lord, some allowance might have been made, if only in consideration of
the persons I have had to deal with, men, I may say habitual drunkards
filling the most important offices, speculators, bankrupts and radicals,
while I have exerted myself strenuously to promote the views of His
Majesty's authority.</p>

<p>If it be Your Lordship's will that I should be the sacrifice, I must
submit.</p>

<p>Your Lordship has disgraced me in the very face of the people whom I
have now governed for nearly six years. I can indeed hardly persuade
myself that Your Lordship could have been aware of the ruinous
consequences to my public reputation and private character. Had Your
Lordship reflected but a moment, you would have seen that, by dismissing
me from this Government, you at once stamped with the authority of Your
Lordship's name as a Minister of the Crown, the gross calumnies published
against me in the Colony and which were repeated and exaggerated in the
House of Commons last year.</p>

<p><b>Gipps to Stanley - 26 July 1844</b></p>

<p>(Advises that Condell and Thomson had resigned from the Legislative
Council and that Mitchell and Adolphus Young were elected to succeed
them; Gipps comments):</p>

<p>But though the number of Government officers in the Council is thus
increased by two, I scarcely expect that the Government will derive any
additional strength from their having seats in it. I have incidentally
had occasion already to shew to Your Lordship that the Surveyor General
had (and I may say systematically) opposed himself to the views of Her
Majesty's Government in respect to the administration of the Lands of the
Crown and Mr Young is also understood to have pledged himself to the same
course at the time of his election.</p>

<p><b>Gipps to Stanley - 18 August 1844</b></p>

<p>(Forwards correspondence and recalls having advised (26.7.44) of
Mitchell's election, and continues):</p>

<p>Having, in my despatch of the 16th ultimo, noticed the systematic
opposition offered by Sir Thomas Mitchell to the views of Her Majesty's
Government in matters connected with his own Department, and further
drawn Your Lordship's attention to the fact of his having failed to give
his support to the Government, on the question respecting District
Councils, which in fact involved the question whether one of the most
important provisions of the Constitutional Act for the Government of the
Colony should be maintained or set aside, I thought it right to inform
Sir Thomas Mitchell that I had written such a Despatch; and I told him at
the same time that the undisguised hostility, which he manifested at all
times not only to my own measures, but to those of Her Majesty's
Government, and even to the enactments of Parliament, in matters
connected with the administration of the lands of the Crown, was in my
opinion inconsistent with his duty as an officer of the Government, and
might even endanger his situation since, when Her Majesty's Government
were disposed to give up all control over the Crown Lands, it was most
necessary that the office of Surveyor General should be held by a person
who would adopt and carry out the policy of Government in respect to the
management of them.</p>

<p>In my despatch No. 17 of 17 January 1844 I pointed out instances in
which the evidence given by Sir Thomas Mitchell before a Committee of the
Legislative Council showed how much he was opposed to the policy of
Government; and similar instances might be adduced in more recent
evidence given by him before another Committee, in the course of the
present session.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Mitchell having now resigned his seat in the Legislative
Council I have of course issued a writ for the holding of a new election
at Port Phillip.</p>

<p><b>Mitchell to Parker* - 5 August 1844</b></p>

<p>The Governor having informed me, at the last interview I had with His
Excellency, that he had mentioned or alluded to me in a communication to
Lord Stanley having reference to the District Councils Bill, I beg His
Excellency will be pleased to communicate to me the nature and grounds of
any complaint he has thought fit to submit to Lord Stanley respecting my
conduct in Council.</p>

<p>I take leave also to refer to other remarks of His Excellency on that
occasion, and to beg that he will be pleased to define what support the
local Government is properly entitled to from a Member of the Legislative
Council, holding such a situation as mine.</p>

<blockquote style="b">[* Private Secretary to Governor.]</blockquote>

<p><b>Parker to Mitchell - 6 August 1844</b></p>

<p>I have received, and laid before His Excellency the Governor, your
letter dated yesterday; and I am directed by His Excellency to state to
you, in reply, that he has at various times had occasion incidentally to
mention to the Secretary of State the way in which you have opposed
yourself to the policy of Her Majesty's Government in the administration
of the Domain of the Crown in this Colony. In respect to your conduct in
the Council, His Excellency has simply informed Lord Stanley that you
failed to give your support to. the Government on an occasion when the
question before the Council was, whether the Act passed by the Imperial
Parliament for the Government of the Colony should be obeyed, or
disobeyed; and, in reply to your request that the Governor "will define
what support the local Government is properly entitled to from a Member
of the Council holding such a situation as yours", I am directed by His
Excellency to state that the Government does not assert any claim to your
support as Member for the District of Port Phillip; but, in conformity
with the rule which prevails throughout the whole of Her Majesty's
Dominions, so long as you continue to hold the office of Surveyor
General, the Government is entitled to your support in all cases
involving any material measure of policy.</p>

<p><b>Mitchell to Parker - 9 August 1844</b></p>

<p>I have had the honour to receive your letter dated the 6th instant, in
which you favour me with His Excellency's reply to my former
communication; and, in reference to the second portion of that reply, and
the Rule whereby it would appear that I, as Surveyor General, cannot act
as an independent Member for Port Phillip, I beg leave to request the
favour of information as to what the particular Order, Regulation or
Despatch is, by which such a Rule has been established, that I may know
how far it may be possible for me to perform my duty to my
constituents.</p>

<p><b>Parker to Mitchell - 9 August 1844</b></p>

<p>I have laid your letter of this day before the Governor, and am
desired by His Excellency in reply to state that the Rule referred to in
my former letter simply is, that the Member for Port Phillip may act as
he pleases, but the Surveyor General of New South Wales must obey and
support the Government. His Excellency can give you no further
information on the subject.</p>

<p><b>Mitchell to Parker - 16 August 1844</b></p>

<p>With reference to the enclosed letter, I request you will be so good
as to ascertain and inform me, whether I am at liberty to lay the
correspondence, which has passed between yourself and me, before the
gentleman by whom this document is signed.</p>

<p><b>Parker to Mitchell - 1 January 1845</b></p>

<p>In returning you the document which accompanied your letter of 16th
instant, I am desired by the Governor to inform you that the letters you
allude to are papers of your own and that the discretion must remain with
you as to the use you may make of them.</p>

<p><b>Stanley to Gipps - 1 January 1845</b></p>

<p>I have received your Despatch dated 26 July 1844 and numbered 158, in
which you announce the election of the Surveyor General and of the
Sheriff of New South Wales as Members of the Legislative Council of that
Colony; and express your opinion that, on some of the more considerable
measures of your Government, you cannot calculate on their support in the
local Legislature, but may not improbably have to encounter their
opposition. It is due to you that I should meet as distinctly as possible
the questions, alike delicate and important, which this question
raises.</p>

<p>In the first place, I regard as very doubtful the propriety of any
public officer of the Crown holding a seat in the Legislative Council of
New South Wales, except by Her Majesty's nomination. On that question,
however, I reserve the expression of my further opinion until I shall be
in possession of a report of your own views respecting it, which you will
report to me as speedily as possible. In the meantime, you will inform
the Surveyor General and the Sheriff that they are not to consider Her
Majesty's Government as acquiescing in this combination, in their
persons, of such employments, so that, if it shall eventually be decided
to call on them to make their choice between their offices and their
seats, they may not have it in their power to allege the want of timely
notice.</p>

<p>The Surveyor General and the Sheriff must further be given to
understand that they must immediately make that choice, if upon any
question, which you may regard as involving the character or the good
conduct of your Government, they shall be unable to render to you their
zealous and cordial support in the Colonial Legislature.</p>

<p>The necessity of making such a choice could be avoided only by methods
which I am well convinced those gentlemen would refuse to adopt, and in
which Her Majesty's Government would not less certainly refuse to
participate--that is, either by those officers neglecting their duty to
their constituents, or by their acting in direct opposition to that duty
as understood and appreciated by themselves.</p>

<p>If Her Majesty's officers think fit to assume relations and
responsibilities disqualifying them for the support of Her Majesty's
Representative, they are of course perfectly free to do so, but, having
done so, cannot be permitted to retain their employment. Otherwise there
would not only be an end of all concert and subordination in Her
Majesty's service, but the sincerity and good faith of those by whom it
is administered would be brought into serious discredit.</p>

<p>I am not forgetful that any general rules, which could be laid down on
a subject of this nature, must require qualifications and exceptions,
which it is not possible distinctly to foresee and to provide for. I
refer to your own discretion the application to particular cases, as they
may arise, of the general principle which I apprehend will be
sufficiently clear for your own guidance, and for the information of the
officers of the Crown serving under you.</p>

<h2><a name="appd"></a>APPENDIX D</h2>

<p><b>Grey to Fitzroy - 4 December 1847</b></p>

<p>I have received your despatch No. 64 of 30 March last, reporting that
with the advice of your Executive Council you had granted twelve months'
leave of absence to Sir Thomas Mitchell, the Surveyor General to your
Government, to enable him to proceed to England on urgent private
affairs.</p>

<p>I transmit for your information copies of a correspondence with Sir
Thomas Mitchell on the subject.</p>

<p>I regret that I cannot consider as satisfactory the grounds assigned
by Sir Thomas Mitchell for his application for leave, particularly as he
had recently been so long absent from his duties in the Colony; but, as
you had thought proper to grant him that leave, and as upon the strength
of it he had come to Europe, I did not consider it just to refuse to
sanction his receiving his absent allowance during that period; although
at the same time I have intimated to him that I should be unable to
extend the period or to sanction the issue of half salary beyond the date
at which the present leave will expire, even although the objects for
which he has visited Europe should not by that time be completed.</p>

<p><b>Mitchell to Grey - 24 July 1847</b></p>

<p>Having arrived from New South Wales on leave of absence for one year,
I have the honor to state that I left Sydney on 29 March last and to
request that Your Lordship may be pleased to cause a communication to be
made to the Colonial Agent General, and also to the War Office stating
such particulars as may be required to enable those authorities to pay me
my half salary as Surveyor General, and my half pay as an unattached
Major.</p>

<p><b>Under-Secretary Hawes to Mitchell - 8 August 1847</b></p>

<p>In reply to the request contained in your letter to Earl Grey of the
24th ultimo I am directed by His Lordship to inform you that no despatch
has yet been received from the Governor of New South Wales announcing the
leave of absence which you state has been granted to you, but that,
whenever such report shall have reached this Department, the necessary
communications on the subject will be made to the Colonial Agent and to
the War Office.</p>

<p><b>Under-Secretary Hawes to Mitchell - 27 September 1847</b></p>

<p>In my letter of 8 August last I informed you that no report had then
been received from the Governor of New South Wales announcing your leave
of absence. I am now directed by Earl Grey to acquaint you that such a
report has now reached him, but that he learns from it that you have
returned to England only on the ground of urgent private affairs.</p>

<p>Lord Grey directs me to observe that he cannot consider this as a
sufficient explanation of the grounds on which you propose so long to
absent yourself from your public duties. His Lordship regards the
difficulty of acquiescing in such a plea as the more considerable, when
he adverts to the great length of time during which you were absent from
those duties on your last visit to England. Under such circumstances, he
cannot sanction your leave of absence, nor direct the payment of your
half salary; but he is ready to receive and consider any statement on the
subject which you may be able and desirous to lay before him.</p>

<p>Lord Grey directs me to add that in his report of your leave of
absence, the Governor of New South Wales has remarked that it is evident
that, if the duties of the Survey Department can be conducted by the
Deputy Surveyor alone without inconvenience to the Public Service, which
was the case during the long period of your late exploratory expedition
as it will be now, it will not be necessary, in the event of any vacancy
occurring, that both the appointments should be filled up. Lord Grey
would, therefore, wish to be informed what is your own opinion as to the
necessity of maintaining both a Surveyor General and a Deputy Surveyor
General on the establishment of the Colony of New South Wales.</p>

<p><b>Mitchell to Hawes - 15 November 1847</b></p>

<p>On my arrival in town this day, having left Malaga on the 2nd instant,
1 had the honour to receive your letter dated 27 September, to which I
hasten to reply.</p>

<p>I beg to state for Earl Grey's information that the grounds on which I
applied to the Governor of New South Wales for leave of absence were,
first, that very unfavourable reports as to the state of my health had
been sent to the Colonial Office; secondly, that my health had been
affected by an attack of paralysis for the cure of which Dr Nicholson, my
physician, recommended a sea voyage; and thirdly, that I had occasion to
give to the public the details of a journey undertaken at the public
expense. On these grounds I personally asked and obtained from the
Governor of New South Wales leave of absence to come to England.</p>

<p>I regret exceedingly to learn from your letter that Lord Grey feels
more difficulty in acquiescing in my present plea when His Lordship
adverts to the great length of time during which I was absent from my
public duties on my last visit to England. I beg to apprise his Lordship
that public duties then engaged my attention, partly in another branch of
the service it is true, but for objects similar to that which now brings
me to London, namely to give to the public the benefit of surveys,
performed at the public expense. I admit that I consider the due and full
completion of any public service entrusted to me, as being the most
urgent of my private affairs, even although it involves the sacrifice
alternately of my military half pay or half my colonial salary; but I
cannot afford to lose both and maintain a very large family. I have been
unable to receive either my half-pay or half colonial salary since my
return to England on leave of absence; and the very serious
inconvenience, indeed distress, to which I must be reduced may be
imagined, if the issue of my half salary and half pay is not immediately
sanctioned.</p>

<p>With respect to the question on which you request my opinion for Lord
Grey's information as to the necessity of maintaining both a Surveyor
General and a Deputy Surveyor General on the establishment of the Colony
of New South Wales, I beg to observe that this appears to me to depend
wholly on the nature of the duties to be required henceforth of the
Surveyor General (Lord Stanley's letter to the Governor of New South
Wales, dated 15 June 1833, is very particular on this point as to the
past). According to the Royal instructions of 1825, extensive territorial
divisions and reserves were commanded to be made, and, pursuant to a
Commission under the great seal of the Colony, I made with my own hand a
trigonometrical survey and determined the boundaries and contents of
nineteen counties, marked out the great roads, and superintended their
construction by upwards of two thousand convicts, and explored the
interior to the Westward, Southward, and lastly to the Northward. It must
be obvious that I could not be always present at the Seat of Government,
where my Deputy signed for me official documents requiring my
signature.</p>

<p>I know of no other service on which I have required that officer's
assistance, besides that general superintendence of others employed under
my written instructions: and, therefore, I could not object to such a
diminution of my Department, if, as I am led to infer from your letter,
my duty as head of the Survey Department may be performed at Sydney.</p>

<p>I have further only to add that my health is much improved by this
visit to Europe, and that I have no desire to remain longer in England
than may be necessary to enable me to bring out the work whereof Lord
Grey has been pleased to sanction the publication.</p>

<p><b>Hawes to Mitchell - 3 December 1847</b></p>

<p>I have laid before Earl Grey your letter of 15th ultimo on explanation
of the circumstances under which you obtained leave of absence from New
South Wales.</p>

<p>In reply, I am directed to acquaint you that, as the Governor of New
South Wales thought proper to grant you leave of absence for a period of
twelve months, and as upon the strength of that leave you came to Europe,
His Lordship will not, during that time, refuse to sanction your
receiving your half salary, although he cannot but regard the grounds
upon which leave was granted to you as far from satisfactory, considering
that you had at a recent period been so long absent from your duties in
the Colony. Under these circumstances Lord Grey cannot sanction any
extension of your leave of absence or the grant of half salary beyond the
date at which your present leave will expire, even although the objects
for which you have visited Europe should not by that time be
completed.</p>

<p><b>Mitchell to Grey - 8 January 1848</b></p>

<p>From the favourable manner in which my application for leave was
received by the Governor of New South Wales, and the readiness with which
it was granted, I did not anticipate those difficulties which Your
Lordship appears to have felt in extending or even sanctioning that
leave.</p>

<p>My preparations for returning to the Colony are not, therefore, in
that state of forwardness, which enabled me by the utmost exertions to
complete my arrangements until the present time.</p>

<p>However grateful I feel to Your Lordship for having sanctioned the
original Leave of Absence, with the difficulty which you appear to have
felt in granting that indulgence, I am still induced to hope that I may
be excused for the interval that may elapse beyond the period of my
original leave by Your Lordship's granting me an extension of two months,
so that I might be fully prepared for embarkation by the end of next
month.</p>

<p><b>Hawes to Mitchell - 17 January 1848</b></p>

<p>I am directed by Earl Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 8th instant, in which you represent the difficulty you have
experienced in completing your arrangements so as to enable you to return
to New South Wales within the term of your present leave; and, under the
circumstances which you have stated, Lord Grey consents to permit your
remaining in this country until 1 March next.</p>

<p>At the same time His Lordship directs me to state that no delay beyond
that period can on any consideration be permitted, and that he is still
unable to approve of the original grant to you of leave of absence.</p>

<p><i>The following is a copy of a manuscript now in the Mitchell
Library. It must be regarded as a draft, as it has not been possible to
find evidence that it was actually sent as a letter to Grey. It has
sufficient intrinsic interest to justify its reproduction here. There is
no reference to it in official records.</i></p>

<p>London, December 1847</p>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>The tenor of two letters which I have received from Mr Hawes induces
me to address Your Lordship and to express my great disappointment that
the services I have endeavoured to render to my country should have
procured for me so little favour in Your Lordship's estimation.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which I obtained leave of absence, and the
objects of my visit to Europe, must be still too imperfectly known to
Your Lordship since they are considered so unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>The journey of which I came to Europe to publish an account was
undertaken at the expense of the Colony of New South Wales, and on the
petition of the Legislative Council. At the sacrifice of half my salary I
came to this country to give this new geographical matter to the public,
and to develop the resources of a portion of the empire hitherto
unknown--to contribute to botanical science--to enrich our gardens--to
gather here amongst men of science such information as may enable my
countrymen seeking a home in parts so remote, to employ their industry to
good account.</p>

<p>My researches with these objects in view have been extended to other
parts of Europe arid I could have hoped rather to have deserved Your
Lordship's approbation, than only to have arrived at the unexpected
discovery that the leave of absence granted me by the Governor and
Executive Council of New South Wales has been disapproved by Your
Lordship.</p>

<p>Time was when such services obtained for me marks of my Sovereign's
approbation, academical honours, and from the Colony the gratuity of a
double salary. I am not aware that the relations between England and
Australia are so entirely changed that when I at length arrive at the
successful completion of a service originating in Royal instructions, a
service which I, a field officer of the Army, was invited to undertake
twenty years ago, I should be ordered back in terms of disapprobation to
the Colony I have so zealously served.</p>

<p>The knowledge I have acquired of the country at the public expense
enables me to be useful to it here--in ascertaining the best means of
extending to these regions the modern improvements of railways and steam
power as applicable to the raising of water, and purposes of extensive
irrigation, and so long as I might be able to render such service to the
Colony, and lose half my salary, I could never have imagined that I
should, by so desiring to benefit the Colony, be so unfortunate as to
incur Your Lordship's displeasure.</p>

<p>At a time when various nervous diseases, paralysis, rheumatism and
palpitation of the heart might have been alleviated by some
acknowledgement of the services that induced them I have been under the
necessity of pleading for that payment of my half salary--the want of
which has embittered the days of this visit to England.</p>

<p>I am again informed that the grounds of Your Lordship's disapprobation
of the leave of absence are that I had at a recent period been so long
absent from my duties in the Colony. I beg to remind Your Lordship that
that absence was sanctioned by Your Lordship's predecessor in office My
Lord John Russell for a special purpose, and that it was never understood
by me that in completing the plans of the battles in the Peninsula I
should subject myself to banishment for life.</p>

<p>It was my ill-fortune to meet in the last Governor an Engineer whose
professional jealousy of a man competent to assert his own claim to
superiority in that branch of duty allocated to him made him an
irreconcilable enemy. Thus he thwarted my views of more extensive
exploration--afforded to a stranger the opportunity of reaping the
advantage of plans I had originated--refused my son the position his
labours in my office ought to have afforded him a preference in
obtaining, and, when disappointment and official vexations by harassing
my mind had paralysed my body, he permitted me to engage in a hazardous
service.</p>

<p>My return, if I have been rightly informed, was unexpected, but I did
return and to what? To learn that a youth, my Son, him for whom I had
sought and who merited patronage, had perished among the Snowy Mountains
of Australia.</p>

<p>Under such various causes of painful suffering it is not surprising
health should have failed--and the invigorating influence of my native
climate become requisite.</p>

<p>The present Governor saw my position and considerately granted that
leave of absence which my partial blindness from ophthalmia and paralysed
frame required--and to which my subsequent recovery is due.</p>

<p>As I trust these details will be sufficient to satisfy Your Lordship
that my sojourn in this country apart from my family, except from
considerations of health, is neither for my own interest nor
gratification; and as I find that three months' additional leave of
absence are necessary to enable me to take out the machinery of a wooden
railway, receive vine cuttings (to be sent from Andalusia at the proper
season), also some birds and animals only to be procured in the spring, I
beg an extension of leave of absence for three months.</p>

<p><i>Sidelined at the beginning of this letter are dates 27 September
1847 and 3 December 1847. These are the letters from Hawes which have
been quoted above.</i></p>

<p><i>In pencil, as a marginal note at the beginning of the draft, is
this note: "I complain of the style of these letters. Having zealously
performed my duty to my country I have now a second duty to perform
towards myself. Before I quit this country, probably never to return, I
find it necessary to enquire whether it is a principle with the Colonial
Office that when an officer's services have been long and efficient, and
his claims to consideration therefore the more, he is to be treated with
more rigour and shown less indulgence as it may be most convenient to get
rid of him. I cannot persuade myself that such a principle would be
avowed by the Imperial Government of Great Britain."</i></p>
