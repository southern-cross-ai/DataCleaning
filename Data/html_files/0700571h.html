<h1>The Golden Key (1867)</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>George MacDonald</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<blockquote><b>There was a boy who used to sit in the twilight and
listen to his great-aunt's stories. She told him that if he could reach
the place where the end of the rainbow stands he would find there a
golden key.</b></blockquote>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>"And what is the key for?" the boy would ask. "What is it the key
of? What will it open?"</p>

<p>"That nobody knows," his aunt would reply. "He has to find that
out."</p>

<p>"I suppose, being gold," the boy once said, thoughtfully, "that I
could get a good deal of money for it if I sold it."</p>

<p>"Better never find it than sell it," returned his aunt.</p>

<p>And the boy went to bed and dreamed about the golden key.</p>

<p>Now all that his great-aunt told the boy about the golden key would
have been nonsense, had it not been that their little house stood on
the borders of Fairyland. For it is perfectly well known that out of
Fairyland nobody ever can find where the rainbow stands. The creature
takes such good care of its golden key, always flitting from place to
place, lest any one should find it! But in Fairyland it is quite
different. Things that look real in this country look very thin indeed
in Fairyland, while some of the things that here cannot stand still for
a moment, will not move there. So it was not in the least absurd of the
old lady to tell her nephew such things about the golden key.</p>

<p>"Did you ever know anybody to find it?" he asked, one evening.</p>

<p>"Yes. Your father, I believe, found it."</p>

<p>"And what did he do with it, can you tell me?"</p>

<p>"He never told me."</p>

<p>"What was it like?"</p>

<p>"He never showed it to me."</p>

<p>"How does a new key come there always?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. There it is."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is the rainbow's egg."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is. You will be a happy boy if you find the nest."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it comes tumbling down the rainbow from the sky."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it does."</p>

<p>One evening, in summer, he went into his own room and stood at the
lattice-window, and gazed into the forest which fringed the outskirts
of Fairyland. It came close up to his great-aunt's garden, and, indeed,
sent some straggling trees into it. The forest lay to the east, and the
sun, which was setting behind the cottage, looked straight into the
dark wood with his level red eye. The trees were all old, and had few
branches below, so that the sun could see a great way into the forest
and the boy, being keen-sighted, could see almost as far as the sun.
The trunks stood like rows of red columns in the shine of the red sun,
and he could see down aisle after aisle in the vanishing distance. And
as he gazed into the forest he began to feel as if the trees were all
waiting for him, and had something they could not go on with till he
came to them. But he was hungry and wanted his supper. So he
lingered.</p>

<p>Suddenly, far among the trees, as far as the sun could shine, he saw
a glorious thing. It was the end of a rainbow, large and brilliant. He
could count all seven colours, and could see shade after shade beyond
the violet; while before the red stood a colour more gorgeous and
mysterious still. It was a colour he had never seen before. Only the
spring of the rainbow-arch was visible. He could see nothing of it
above the trees.</p>

<p>"The golden key!" he said to himself, and darted out of the house,
and into the wood.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before the sun set. But the rainbow only glowed
the brighter. For the rainbow of Fairyland is not dependent upon the
sun, as ours is. The trees welcomed him. The bushes made way for him.
The rainbow grew larger and brighter; and at length he found himself
within two trees of it.</p>

<p>It was a grand sight, burning away there in silence, with its
gorgeous, its lovely, its delicate colours, each distinct, all
combining. He could now see a great deal more of it. It rose high into
the blue heavens, but bent so little that he could not tell how high
the crown of the arch must reach. It was still only a small portion of
a huge bow.</p>

<p>He stood gazing at it till he forgot himself with delight&mdash;even
forgot the key which he had come to seek. And as he stood it grew more
wonderful still. For in each of the colours, which was as large as the
column of a church, he could faintly see beautiful forms slowly
ascending as if by the steps of a winding stair. The forms appeared
irregularly&mdash;now one, now many, now several, now none&mdash;men and women
and children&mdash;all different, all beautiful.</p>

<p>He drew nearer to the rainbow. It vanished. He started back a step
in dismay. It was there again, as beautiful as ever. So he contented
himself with standing as near it as he might, and watching the forms
that ascended the glorious colours towards the unknown height of the
arch, which did not end abruptly but faded away in the blue air, so
gradually that he could not say where it ceased.</p>

<p>When the thought of the golden key returned, the boy very wisely
proceeded to mark out in his mind the space covered by the foundation
of the rainbow, in order that he might know where to search, should the
rainbow disappear. It was based chiefly upon a bed of moss.</p>

<p>Meantime it had grown quite dark in the wood. The rainbow alone was
visible by its own light. But the moment the moon rose the rainbow
vanished. Nor could any change of place restore the vision to the boy's
eyes. So he threw himself down upon the mossy bed, to wait till the
sunlight would give him a chance of finding the key. There he fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p>When he woke in the morning the sun was looking straight into his
eyes. He turned away from it, and the same moment saw a brilliant
little thing lying on the moss within a foot of his face. It was the
golden key. The pipe of it was of plain gold, as bright as gold could
be. The handle was curiously wrought and set with sapphires. In a
terror of delight he put out his hand and took it, and had it.</p>

<p>He lay for a while, turning it over and over, and feeding his eyes
upon its beauty. Then he jumped to his feet, remembering that the
pretty thing was of no use to him yet. Where was the lock to which the
key belonged? It must be somewhere, for how could anybody be so silly
as make a key for which there was no lock? Where should he go to look
for it? He gazed about him, up into the air, down to the earth, but saw
no keyhole in the clouds, in the grass, or in the trees.</p>

<p>Just as he began to grow disconsolate, however, he saw something
glimmering in the wood. It was a mere glimmer that he saw, but he took
it for a glimmer of rainbow, and went towards it.&mdash;And now I will go
back to the borders of the forest.</p>

<p>Not far from the house where the boy had lived, there was another
house, the owner of which was a merchant, who was much away from home.
He had lost his wife some years before, and had only one child, a
little girl, whom he left to the charge of two servants, who were very
idle and careless. So she was neglected and left untidy, and was
sometimes ill-used besides.</p>

<p>Now it is well known that the little creatures commonly known as
fairies, though there are many different kinds of fairies in Fairyland,
have an exceeding dislike to untidiness. Indeed, they are quite
spiteful to slovenly people. Being used to all the lovely ways of the
trees and flowers, and to the neatness of the birds and all woodland
creatures, it makes them feel miserable, even in their deep woods and
on their grassy carpets, to think that within the same moonlight lies a
dirty, uncomfortable, slovenly house. And this makes them angry with
the people that live in it, and they would gladly drive them out of the
world if they could. They want the whole earth nice and clean. So they
pinch the maids black and blue and play them all manner of
uncomfortable tricks.</p>

<p>But this house was quite a shame, and the fairies in the forest
could not endure it. They tried everything on the maids without effect,
and at last resolved upon making a clean riddance, beginning with the
child. They ought to have known that it was not her fault, but they
have little principle and much mischief in them, and they thought that
if they got rid of her the maids would be sure to be turned away.</p>

<p>So one evening, the poor little girl having been put to bed early,
before the sun was down, the servants went off to the village, locking
the door behind them. The child did not know she was alone, and lay
contentedly looking out of her window towards the forest, of which,
however, she could not see much, because of the ivy and other creeping
plants which had straggled across her window. All at once she saw an
ape making faces at her out of the mirror, and the heads carved upon a
great old wardrobe grinning fearfully. Then two old spider-legged
chairs came forward into the middle of the room, and began to dance a
queer, old-fashioned dance. This set her laughing and she forgot the
ape and the grinning heads. So the fairies saw they had made a mistake,
and sent the chairs back to their places. But they knew that she had
been reading the story of Silverhair all day. So the next moment she
heard the voices of the three bears upon the stair, big voice, middle
voice, and little voice, and she heard their soft, heavy tread, as if
they had stockings over their boots, coming nearer and nearer to the
door of her room, till she could bear it no longer. She did just as
Silverhair did, and as the fairies wanted her to do; she darted to the
window, pulled it open, got upon the ivy, and so scrambled to the
ground. She then fled to the forest as fast as she could run.</p>

<p>Now, although she did not know it, this was the very best way she
could have gone; for nothing is ever so mischievous in its own place as
it is out of it; and, besides, these mischievous creatures were only
the children of Fairyland, as it were, and there are many other beings
there as well; and if a wanderer gets in among them, the good ones will
always help him more than the evil ones will be able to hurt him.</p>

<p>The sun was now set, and the darkness coming on, but the child
thought of no danger but the bears behind her. If she had looked round,
however, she would have seen that she was followed by a very different
creature from a bear. It was a curious creature, made like a fish, but
covered, instead of scales, with feathers of all colours, sparkling
like those of a humming-bird. It had fins, not wings, and swam through
the air as a fish does through the water. Its head was like the head of
a small owl.</p>

<p>After running a long way, and as the last of the light was
disappearing, she passed under a tree with drooping branches. It
dropped its branches to the ground all about her, and caught her as in
a trap. She struggled to get out, but the branches pressed her closer
and closer to the trunk. She was in great terror and distress, when the
air-fish, swimming into the thicket of branches, began tearing them
with its beak. They loosened their hold at once, and the creature went
on attacking them, till at length they let the child go. Then the
air-fish came from behind her, and swam on in front, glittering and
sparkling all lovely colours; and she followed.</p>

<p>It led her gently along till all at once it swam in at a cottage
door. The child followed still. There was a bright fire in the middle
of the floor, upon which stood a pot without a lid, full of water that
boiled and bubbled furiously. The air-fish swam straight to the pot and
into the boiling water, where it lay quiet. A beautiful woman rose from
the opposite side of the fire and came to meet the girl. She took her
up in her arms, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, you are come at last! I have been looking for you a long
time."</p>

<p>She sat down with her on her lap, and there the girl sat staring at
her. She had never seen anything so beautiful. She was tall and strong,
with white arms and neck, and a delicate flush on her face. The child
could not tell what was the colour of her hair, but could not help
thinking it had a tinge of dark green. She had not one ornament upon
her, but she looked as if she had just put off quantities of diamonds
and emeralds. Yet here she was in the simplest, poorest little cottage,
where she was evidently at home. She was dressed in shining green.</p>

<p>The girl looked at the lady, and the lady looked at the girl.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>"The servants always called me Tangle."</p>

<p>"Ah, that was because your hair was so untidy. But that was their
fault, the naughty women! Still it is a pretty name, and I will call
you Tangle too. You must not mind my asking you questions, for you may
ask me the same questions, every one of them, and any others that you
like. How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Ten," answered Tangle.</p>

<p>"You don't look like it," said the lady.</p>

<p>"How old are you, please?" returned Tangle.</p>

<p>"Thousands of years old," answered the lady.</p>

<p>"You don't look like it," said Tangle.</p>

<p>"Don't I? I think I do. Don't you see how beautiful I am!"</p>

<p>And her great blue eyes looked down on the little Tangle, as if all
the stars in the sky were melted in them to make their brightness.</p>

<p>"Ah! but," said Tangle, "when people live long they grow old. At
least I always thought so."</p>

<p>"I have no time to grow old," said the lady. "I am too busy for
that. It is very idle to grow old.&mdash;but I cannot have my little girl so
untidy. Do you know I can't find a clean spot on your face to
kiss!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," suggested Tangle, feeling ashamed, but not too much so to
say a word for herself,&mdash;"perhaps that is because the tree made me cry
so."</p>

<p>"My poor darling!" said the lady, looking now as if the moon were
melted in her eyes, and kissing her little face, dirty as it was, "the
naughty tree must suffer for making a girl cry."</p>

<p>"And what is your name, please?" asked Tangle.</p>

<p>"Grandmother," answered the lady.</p>

<p>"Is it really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. I never tell stories, even in fun."</p>

<p>"How good of you!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't if I tried. It would come true if I said it, and then I
should be punished enough." And she smiled like the sun through a
summer shower.</p>

<p>"But now," she went on, "I must get you washed and dressed, and then
we shall have some supper."</p>

<p>"Oh! I had supper long ago," said Tangle.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed you had," answered the lady,&mdash;"three years ago. You
don't know that it is three years since you ran away from the bears.
You are thirteen and more now."</p>

<p>Tangle could only stare. She felt quite sure it was true.</p>

<p>"You will not be afraid of anything I do with you&mdash;will you?" said
the lady.</p>

<p>"I will try very hard not to be; but I can't be certain, you know,"
replied Tangle.</p>

<p>"I like your saying so, and I shall be quite satisfied," answered
the lady.</p>

<p>She took off the girl's night-gown, rose with her in her arms, and
going to the wall of the cottage, opened a door. Then Tangle saw a deep
tank, the sides of which were filled with green plants, which had
flowers of all colours. There was a roof over it like the roof of the
cottage. It was filled with beautiful clear water, in which swam a
multitude of such fishes as the one that had led her to the cottage. It
was the light their colours gave that showed the place in which they
were.</p>

<p>The lady spoke some words Tangle could not understand, and threw her
into the tank.</p>

<p>The fishes came crowding about her. Two or three of them got under
her head and kept it up. The rest of them rubbed themselves all over
her, and with their wet feathers washed her quite clean. Then the lady,
who had been looking on all the time, spoke again; whereupon some
thirty or forty of the fishes rose out of the water underneath Tangle,
and so bore her up to the arms the lady held out to take her. She
carried her back to the fire, and, having dried her well, opened a
chest, and taking out the finest linen garments, smelling of grass and
lavender, put them upon her, and over all a green dress, just like her
own, shining like hers, and soft like hers, and going into just such
lovely folds from the waist, where it was tied with a brown cord, to
her bare feet.</p>

<p>"Won't you give me a pair of shoes too, Grandmother?" said
Tangle.</p>

<p>"No, my dear; no shoes. Look here. I wear no shoes."</p>

<p>So saying she lifted her dress a little, and there were the
loveliest white feet, but no shoes. Then Tangle was content to go
without shoes too. And the lady sat down with her again, and combed her
hair, and brushed it, and then left it to dry while she got the
supper.</p>

<p>First she got bread out of one hole in the wall; then milk out of
another; then several kinds of fruit out a third; and then she went to
the pot on the fire, and took out the fish, now nicely cooked, and, as
soon as she had pulled off its feathered skin, ready to be eaten.</p>

<p>"But," exclaimed Tangle. And she stared at the fish, and could say
no more.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," returned the lady. "You do not like to eat
the messenger that brought you home. But it is the kindest return you
can make. The creature was afraid to go until it saw me put the pot on,
and heard me promise it should be boiled the moment it returned with
you. Then it darted out of the door at once. You saw it go into the pot
of itself the moment it entered, did you not?"</p>

<p>"I did," answered Tangle, "and I thought it very strange; but then I
saw you, and forgot all about the fish."</p>

<p>"In Fairyland," resumed the lady, as they sat down to the table,
"the ambition of the animals is to be eaten by the people; for that is
their highest end in that condition. But they are not therefore
destroyed. Out of that pot comes something more than the dead fish, you
will see."</p>

<p>Tangle now remarked that the lid was on the pot. But the lady took
no further notice of it till they had eaten the fish, which Tangle
found nicer than any fish she had ever tasted before. It was as white
as snow, and as delicate as cream. And the moment she had swallowed a
mouthful of it, a change she could not describe began to take place in
her. She heard a murmuring all about her, which became more and more
articulate, and at length, as she went on eating, grew intelligible. By
the time she had finished her share, the sounds of all the animals in
the forest came crowding through the door to her ears; for the door
still stood wide open, though it was pitch-dark outside; and they were
no longer sounds only; they were speech, and speech that she could
understand. She could tell what the insects in the cottage were saying
to each other too. She had even a suspicion that the trees and flowers
all about the cottage were holding midnight communications with each
other; but what they said she could not hear.</p>

<p>As soon as the fish was eaten, the lady went to the fire and took
the lid off the pot. A lovely little creature in human shape, with
large white wings, rose out of it, and flew round and round the roof of
the cottage; then dropped, fluttering, and nestled in the lap of the
lady. She spoke to it some strange words, carried it to the door, and
threw it out into the darkness. Tangle heard the flapping of its wings
die away in the distance.</p>

<p>"Now have we done the fish any harm?" she said, returning.</p>

<p>"No," answered Tangle, "I do not think we have. I should not mind
eating one every day."</p>

<p>"They must wait their time, like you and me too, my little
Tangle."</p>

<p>And she smiled a smile which the sadness in it made more lovely.</p>

<p>"But," she continued, "I think we may have one for supper
to-morrow."</p>

<p>So saying she went to the door of the tank, and spoke; and now
Tangle understood her perfectly.</p>

<p>"I want one of you." she said,&mdash;"the wisest."</p>

<p>Thereupon the fishes got together in the middle of the tank, with
their heads forming a circle above the water, and their tails a larger
circle beneath it. They were holding a council, in which their relative
wisdom should be determined. At length one of them flew up into the
lady's hand, looking lively and ready.</p>

<p>"You know where the rainbow stands?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, quite well," answered the fish.</p>

<p>"Bring home a young man you will find there, who does not know where
to go."</p>

<p>The fish was out of the door in a moment. Then the lady told Tangle
it was time to go to bed; and, opening another door in the side of the
cottage, showed her a little arbour, cool and green, with a bed of
purple heath growing in it, upon which she threw a large wrapper made
of the feathered skins of the wise fishes, shining gorgeous in the
firelight. Tangle was soon lost in the strangest, loveliest dreams. And
the beautiful lady was in every one of her dreams.</p>

<p>In the morning she woke to the rustling of leaves over her head, and
the sound of running water. But, to her surprise, she could find no
door&mdash;nothing but the moss grown wall of the cottage. So she crept
through an opening in the arbour, and stood in the forest. Then she
bathed in a stream that ran merrily through the trees, and felt
happier; for having once been in her grandmother's pond, she must be
clean and tidy ever after; and, having put on her green dress, felt
like a lady.</p>

<p>She spent that day in the wood, listening to the birds and beasts
and creeping things. She understood all that they said, though she
could not repeat a word of it; and every kind had a different language,
while there was a common though more limited understanding between all
the inhabitants of the forest. She saw nothing of the beautiful lady,
but she felt that she was near her all the time; and she took care not
to go out of sight of the cottage. It was round, like a snow-hut or a
wigwam; and she could see neither door nor window in it. The fact was,
it had no windows; and though it was full of doors, they all opened
from the inside, and could not even be seen from the outside.</p>

<p>She was standing at the foot of a tree in the twilight, listening to
a quarrel between a mole and a squirrel, in which the mole told the
squirrel that the tail was the best of him, and the squirrel called the
mole Spade-fists, when, the darkness having deepened around her, she
became aware of something shining in her face, and looking round, saw
that the door of the cottage was open, and the red light of the fire
flowing from it like a river through the darkness. She left Mole and
Squirrel to settle matters as they might, and darted off to the
cottage. Entering, she found the pot boiling on the fire, and the
grand, lovely lady sitting on the other side of it.</p>

<p>"I've been watching you all day," said the lady. "You shall have
something to eat by-and-by, but we must wait till our supper comes
home."</p>

<p>She took Tangle on her knee, and began to sing to her&mdash;such songs as
made her wish she could listen to them for ever. But at length in
rushed the shining fish, and snuggled down in the pot. It was followed
by a youth who had outgrown his worn garments. His face was ruddy with
health, and in his hand he carried a little jewel, which sparkled in
the firelight.</p>

<p>The first words the lady said were,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is that in your hand, Mossy?"</p>

<p>Now Mossy was the name his companions had given him, because he had
a favourite stone covered with moss, on which he used to sit whole days
reading; and they said the moss had begun to grow upon him too.</p>

<p>Mossy held out his hand. The moment the lady saw that it was the
golden key, she rose from her chair, kissed Mossy on the forehead, made
him sit down on her seat, and stood before him like a servant. Mossy
could not bear this, and rose at once. But the lady begged him, with
tears in her beautiful eyes, to sit, and let her wait on him.</p>

<p>"But you are a great, splendid, beautiful lady," said Mossy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. But I work all day long&mdash;that is my pleasure; and you
will have to leave me so soon!"</p>

<p>"How do you know that, if you please, madam?" asked Mossy.</p>

<p>"Because you have got the golden key."</p>

<p>"But I don't know what it is for. I can't find the keyhole. Will you
tell me what to do?"</p>

<p>"You must look for the keyhole. That is your work. I cannot help
you. I can only tell you that if you look for it you will find it."</p>

<p>"What kind of box will it open? What is there inside?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. I dream about it, but I know nothing."</p>

<p>"Must I go at once?"</p>

<p>"You may stop here tonight, and have some of my supper. But you must
go in the morning. All I can do for you is to give you clothes. Here is
a girl called Tangle, whom you must take with you."</p>

<p>"That <i>will</i> be nice," said Mossy.</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Tangle. "I don't want to leave you, please,
grandmother."</p>

<p>"You must go with him, Tangle. I am sorry to lose you, but it will
the best thing for you. Even the fishes, you see, have to go into the
pot, and then out into the dark. If you fall in with the Old Man of the
Sea, mind you ask him whether he has not got some more fishes ready for
me. My tank is getting thin."</p>

<p>So saying, she took the fish from the pot, and put the lid on as
before. They sat down and ate the fish, and then the winged creature
rose from the pot, circled the roof, and settled on the lady's lap. She
talked to it, carried it to the door, and threw it out into the dark.
They heard the flap of its wings die away in the distance.</p>

<p>The lady then showed Mossy into just such another chamber as that of
Tangle; and in the morning he found a suit of clothes laid beside him.
He looked very handsome in them. But the wearer of Grandmother's
clothes never thinks about how he or she looks, but thinks always how
handsome other people are.</p>

<p>Tangle was very unwilling to go.</p>

<p>"Why should I leave you? I don't know the young man," she said to
the lady.</p>

<p>"I am never allowed to keep my children long. You need not go with
him except you please, but you must go some day; and I should like you
to go with him, for he has the golden key. No girl need be afraid to go
with a youth that has the golden key. You will take care of her, Mossy,
will you not?"</p>

<p>"That I will," said Mossy.</p>

<p>And Tangle cast a glance at him, and thought she should like to go
with him.</p>

<p>"And," said the lady, "If you should lose each other as you go
through the&mdash;the&mdash;I never can remember the name of that country,&mdash;do
not be afraid, but go on and on."</p>

<p>She kissed Tangle on the mouth and Mossy on the forehead, led them
to the door, and waved her hand eastward. Mossy and Tangle took each
other's hand and walked away into the depth of the forest. In his right
hand Mossy held the golden key.</p>

<p>They wandered thus a long way, with endless amusement from the talk
of the animals. They soon learned enough of their language to ask them
necessary questions. The squirrels were always friendly, and gave them
nuts out of their own hoards; but the bees were selfish and rude,
justifying themselves on the ground that Tangle and Mossy were not
subjects of their queen, and charity must begin at home, though indeed
they had not one drone in their poorhouse at the time. Even the
blinking moles would fetch them an earth-nut or a truffle now and then,
talking as if their mouths, as well as their eyes and ears, were full
of cotton wool, or their own velvety fur. By the time they got out of
the forest they were very fond of each other, and Tangle was not in the
least sorry that her grandmother had sent her away with Mossy.</p>

<p>At length the trees grew smaller, and stood farther apart, and the
ground began to rise, and it got more and more steep, till the trees
were all left behind, and the two were climbing a narrow path with
rocks on each side. Suddenly they came upon a rude doorway, by which
they entered a narrow gallery cut in the rock. It grew darker and
darker, till it was pitch dark, and they had to feel their way. At
length the light began to return, and at last they came out upon a
narrow path on the face of a lofty precipice. This path went winding
down the rock to a wide plain, circular in shape, and surrounded on all
sides by mountains. Those opposite to them were a great way off, and
towered to an awful height, shooting up sharp, blue, ice-enamelled
pinnacles. An utter silence reigned where they stood. Not even the
sound of water reached them.</p>

<p>Looking down, they could not tell whether the valley below was a
grassy plain or a great still lake. They had never seen any place look
like it. The way to it was difficult and dangerous, but down the narrow
path they went, and reached the bottom in safety. They found it
composed of smooth, light-coloured sandstone, undulating in parts, but
mostly level. It was no wonder to them now that they had not been able
to tell what it was, for this surface was everywhere crowded with
shadows. It was a sea of shadows. The mass was chiefly made up of the
shadows of leaves innumerable, of all lovely and imaginative forms,
waving to and fro, floating and quivering in the breath of a breeze
whose motion was unfelt, whose sound was unheard. No forests clothed
the mountain-sides, no trees were anywhere to be seen, and yet the
shadows of the leaves, branches, and stems of all various trees covered
the valley as far as their eyes could reach. They soon spied the
shadows of flowers mingled with those of the leaves, and now and then
the shadow of a bird with open beak, and throat distended with song. At
times would appear the forms of strange, graceful creatures, running up
and down the shadow-boles and along the branches, to disappear in the
wind-tossed foliage. As they walked they waded knee-deep in the lovely
lake. For the shadows were not merely lying on the surface of the
ground, but heaped up above it like substantial forms of darkness, as
if they had been cast upon a thousand different planes of the air.
Tangle and Mossy often lifted their heads and gazed upwards to descry
whence the shadows came; but they could see nothing more than a bright
mist spread above them, higher than the tops of the mountains, which
stood clear against it. No forests, no leaves, no birds were
visible.</p>

<p>After a while, they reached more open spaces, where the shadows were
thinner; and came even to portions over which shadows only flitted,
leaving them clear for such as might follow. Now a wonderful form, half
bird-like half human, would float across on outspread sailing pinions.
Anon an exquisite shadow group of gambolling children would be followed
by the loveliest female form, and that again by the grand stride of a
Titanic shape, each disappearing in the surrounding press of shadowy
foliage. Sometimes a profile of unspeakable beauty or grandeur would
appear for a moment and vanish. Sometimes they seemed lovers that
passed linked arm in arm, sometimes father and son, sometimes brothers
in loving contest, sometimes sisters entwined in gracefullest community
of complex form. Sometimes wild horses would tear across, free, or
bestrode by noble shadows of ruling men. But some of the things which
pleased them most they never knew how to describe.</p>

<p>About the middle of the plain they sat down to rest in the heart of
a heap of shadows. After sitting for a while, each, looking up, saw the
other in tears: they were each longing after the country whence the
shadows fell.</p>

<p>"We MUST find the country from which the shadows come," said
Mossy.</p>

<p>"We must, dear Mossy," responded Tangle. "What if your golden key
should be the key to it?"</p>

<p>"Ah! that would be grand," returned Mossy.&mdash;"But we must rest here
for a little, and then we shall be able to cross the plain before
night."</p>

<p>So he lay down on the ground, and about him on every side, and over
his head, was the constant play of the wonderful shadows. He could look
through them, and see the one behind the other, till they mixed in a
mass of darkness. Tangle, too, lay admiring, and wondering, and longing
after the country whence the shadows came. When they were rested they
rose and pursued their journey.</p>

<p>How long they were in crossing this plain I cannot tell; but before
night Mossy's hair was streaked with grey, and Tangle had got wrinkles
on her forehead.</p>

<p>As evening drew on, the shadows fell deeper and rose higher. At
length they reached a place where they rose above their heads, and made
all dark around them. Then they took hold of each other's hand, and
walked on in silence and in some dismay. They felt the gathering
darkness, and something strangely solemn besides, and the beauty of the
shadows ceased to delight them. All at once Tangle found that she had
not a hold of Mossy's hand, though when she lost it she could not
tell.</p>

<p>"Mossy, Mossy!" she cried aloud in terror.</p>

<p>But no Mossy replied.</p>

<p>A moment after, the shadows sank to her feet, and down under her
feet, and the mountains rose before her. She turned towards the gloomy
region she had left, and called once more upon Mossy. There the gloom
lay tossing and heaving, a dark stormy, foamless sea of shadows, but no
Mossy rose out of it, or came climbing up the hill on which she stood.
She threw herself down and wept in despair.</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered that the beautiful lady had told them, if
they lost each other in a country of which she could not remember the
name, they were not to be afraid, but to go straight on.</p>

<p>"And besides," she said to herself, "Mossy has the golden key, and
so no harm will come to him, I do believe."</p>

<p>She rose from the ground, and went on.</p>

<p>Before long she arrived at a precipice, in the face of which a stair
was cut. When she had ascended halfway, the stair ceased, and the path
led straight into the mountain. She was afraid to enter, and turning
again towards the stair, grew giddy at the sight of the depth beneath
her, and was forced to throw herself down in the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>When she opened her eyes, she saw a beautiful little creature with
wings standing beside her, waiting.</p>

<p>"I know you," said Tangle. "You are my fish."</p>

<p>"Yes. But I am a fish no longer. I am an a&euml;ranth now."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Tangle.</p>

<p>"What you see I am," answered the shape. "And I am come to lead you
through the mountain."</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you, dear fish&mdash;a&euml;ranth, I mean," returned Tangle,
rising.</p>

<p>Thereupon the a&euml;ranth took to his wings, and flew on through
the long narrow passage, reminding Tangle very much of the way he had
swum on before her when he was a fish. And the moment his white wings
moved, they began to throw off a continuous shower of sparks of all
colours, which lighted up the passage before them. All at once he
vanished, and Tangle heard a low, sweet sound, quite different from the
rush and crackle of his wings. Before her was an open arch, and through
it came light, mixed with the sound of sea-waves.</p>

<p>She hurried out, and fell, tired and happy, upon the yellow sand of
the shore. There she lay, half asleep with weariness and rest,
listening to the low plash and retreat of the tiny waves, which seemed
ever enticing the land to leave off being land, and become sea. And as
she lay, her eyes were fixed upon the foot of a great rainbow standing
far away against the sky on the other side of the sea. At length she
fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>When she awoke, she saw an old man with long white hair down to his
shoulders, leaning upon a stick covered with green buds, and so bending
over her.</p>

<p>"What do you want here, beautiful woman?" he said.</p>

<p>"Am I beautiful? I am so glad!" answered Tangle, rising. "My
grandmother is beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yes. But what do you want?" he repeated, kindly.</p>

<p>"I think I want you. Are not you the Old Man of the Sea?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Then grandmother says, have you any more fishes ready for her?"</p>

<p>"We will go and see, my dear," answered the old man, speaking yet
more kindly than before. "And I can do some thing for you, can I
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;show me the way up to the country from which the shadows
fall," said Tangle. For there she hoped to find Mossy again.</p>

<p>"Ah! indeed, that would be worth doing," said the old man. "But I
cannot, for I do not know the way myself. But I will send you to the
Old Man of the Earth. Perhaps he can tell you. He is much older than I
am."</p>

<p>Leaning on his staff, he conducted her along the shore to a steep
rock, that looked like a petrified ship turned upside down. The door of
it was the rudder of a great vessel, ages ago at the bottom of the sea.
Immediately within the door was a stair in the rock, down which the old
man went, and Tangle followed. At the bottom, the old man had his
house, and there he lived.</p>

<p>As soon as she entered it, Tangle heard a strange noise, unlike
anything she had ever heard before. She soon found that it was the
fishes talking. She tried to understand what they said; but their
speech was so old-fashioned, and rude, and undefined, that she could
not make much of it.</p>

<p>"I will go and see about those fishes for my daughter," said the Old
Man of the Sea.</p>

<p>And moving a slide in the wall of his house, he first looked out,
and then tapped upon a thick piece of crystal that filled the round
opening. Tangle came up behind him, and peeping through the window into
the heart of the great deep green ocean, saw the most curious
creatures, some very ugly, all very odd, and with especially queer
mouths, swimming about everywhere, above and below, but all coming
towards the window in answer to the tap of the Old Man of the Sea. Only
a few could get their mouths against the glass; but those who were
floating miles away yet turned their heads towards it. The Old Man
looked through the whole flock carefully for some minutes, and then
turning to Tangle, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am sorry I have not got one ready yet. I want more time than she
does. But I will send some as soon as I can."</p>

<p>He then shut the slide.</p>

<p>Presently a great noise arose in the sea. The old man opened the
slide again, and tapped on the glass, whereupon the fishes were all as
still as sleep.</p>

<p>"They were only talking about you," he said. "And they do speak such
nonsense!&mdash;Tomorrow," he continued, "I must show you the way to the Old
Man of the Earth. He lives a long way from here."</p>

<p>"Do let me go at once," said Tangle.</p>

<p>"No. That is not possible. You must come this way first."</p>

<p>He led her to a hole in the wall, which she had not observed before.
It was covered with the green leaves and white blossoms of a creeping
plant.</p>

<p>"Only white-blossoming plants can grow under the sea," said the old
man. "In there you will find a bath, in which you must lie till I call
you."</p>

<p>Tangle went in, and found a smaller room or cave, in the further
corner of which was a great basin hollowed out of a rock, and half full
of the clearest sea-water. Little streams were constantly running into
it from cracks in the wall of the cavern. It was polished quite smooth
inside, and had a carpet of yellow sand in the bottom of it. Large
green leaves and white flowers of various plants crowded up and over
it, draping and covering it almost entirely.</p>

<p>No sooner was she undressed and lying in the bath, than she began to
feel as if the water were sinking into her, and she was receiving all
the good of sleep without undergoing its forgetfulness. She felt the
good coming all the time. And she grew happier and more hopeful than
she had been since she lost Mossy. But she could not help thinking how
very sad it was for a poor old man to live there all alone, and have to
take care of a whole seaful of stupid and riotous fishes.</p>

<p>After about an hour, as she thought, she heard his voice calling
her, and rose out of the bath. All the fatigue and aching of her long
journey had vanished. She was as whole, and strong, and well as if she
had slept for seven days.</p>

<p>Returning to the opening that led into the other part of the house,
she started back with amazement, for through it she saw the form of a
grand man, with a majestic and beautiful face, waiting for her.</p>

<p>"Come," he said; "I see you are ready."</p>

<p>She entered with reverence.</p>

<p>"Where is the Old Man of the Sea?" she asked, humbly.</p>

<p>"There is no one here but me," he answered, smiling. "Some people
call me the Old Man of the Sea. Others have another name for me, and
are terribly frightened when they meet me taking a walk by the shore.
Therefore I avoid being seen by them, for they are so afraid, that they
never see what I really am. You see me now. But I must show you the way
to the Old Man of the Earth."</p>

<p>He led her into the cave where the bath was, and there she saw, in
the opposite corner, a second opening in the rock.</p>

<p>"Go down that stair, and it will bring you to him," said the Old Man
of the Sea.</p>

<p>With humble thanks Tangle took her leave. She went down the
winding-stair, till she began to fear there was no end to it. Still
down and down it went, rough and broken, with springs of water bursting
out of the rocks and running down the steps beside her. It was quite
dark about her, and yet she could see. For after being in that bath,
people's eyes always give out a light they can see by. There were no
creeping things in the way. All was safe and pleasant though so dark
and damp and deep.</p>

<p>At last there was not one step more, and she found herself in a
glimmering cave. On a stone in the middle of it sat a figure with its
back towards her&mdash;the figure of an old man bent double with age. From
behind she could see his white beard spread out on the rocky floor in
front of him. He did not move as she entered, so she passed round that
she might stand before him and speak to him. The moment she looked in
his face, she saw that he was a youth of marvellous beauty. He sat
entranced with the delight of what he beheld in a mirror of something
like silver, which lay on the floor at his feet, and which from behind
she had taken for his white beard. He sat on, heedless of her presence,
pale with the joy of his vision. She stood and watched him. At length,
all trembling, she spoke. But her voice made no sound. Yet the youth
lifted up his head. He showed no surprise, however, at seeing her&mdash;only
smiled a welcome.</p>

<p>"Are you the Old Man of the Earth?" Tangle had said.</p>

<p>And the youth answered, and Tangle heard him, though not with her
ears:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Tell me the way to the country whence the shadows fall."</p>

<p>"Ah! that I do not know. I only dream about it myself. I see its
shadows sometimes in my mirror: the way to it I do not know. But I
think the Old Man of the Fire must know. He is much older than I am. He
is the oldest man of all."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"I will show you the way to his place. I never saw him myself."</p>

<p>So saying, the young man rose, and then stood for a while gazing at
Tangle.</p>

<p>"I wish I could see that country too," he said. "But I must mind my
work."</p>

<p>He led her to the side of the cave, and told her to lay her ear
against the wall.</p>

<p>"What do you hear?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I hear," answered Tangle, "the sound of a great water running
inside the rock."</p>

<p>"That river runs down to the dwelling of the oldest man of all&mdash;the
Old Man of the Fire. I wish I could go to see him. But I must mind my
work. That river is the only way to him."</p>

<p>Then the Old Man of the Earth stooped over the floor of the cave,
raised a huge stone from it, and left it leaning. It disclosed a great
hole that went plumb-down.</p>

<p>"That is the way," he said.</p>

<p>"But there are no stairs."</p>

<p>"You must throw yourself in. There is no other way."</p>

<p>She turned and looked him full in the face&mdash;stood so for a whole
minute, as she thought: it was a whole year&mdash;then threw herself
headlong into the hole.</p>

<p>When she came to herself, she found herself gliding down fast and
deep. Her head was under water, but that did not signify, for, when she
thought about it, she could not remember that she had breathed once
since her bath in the cave of the Old Man of the Sea. When she lifted
up her head a sudden and fierce heat struck her, and she sank it again
instantly, and went sweeping on.</p>

<p>Gradually the stream grew shallower. At length she could hardly keep
her head under. Then the water could carry her no farther. She rose
from the channel, and went step for step down the burning descent. The
water ceased altogether. The heat was terrible. She felt scorched to
the bone, but it did not touch her strength. It grew hotter and hotter.
She said, "I can bear it no longer." Yet she went on.</p>

<p>At the long last, the stair ended at a rude archway in an all but
glowing rock. Through this archway Tangle fell exhausted into a cool
mossy cave. The floor and walls were covered with moss&mdash;green, soft,
and damp. A little stream spouted from a rent in the rock and fell into
a basin of moss. She plunged her face into it and drank. Then she
lifted her head and looked around. Then she rose and looked again. She
saw no one in the cave. But the moment she stood upright she had a
marvellous sense that she was in the secret of the earth and all its
ways. Everything she had seen, or learned from books; all that her
grandmother had said or sung to her; all the talk of the beasts, birds,
and fishes; all that had happened to her on her journey with Mossy, and
since then in the heart of the earth with the Old man and the Older
man&mdash;all was plain: she understood it all, and saw that everything
meant the same thing, though she could not have put it into words
again.</p>

<p>The next moment she descried, in a comer of the cave, a little naked
child, sitting on the moss. He was playing with balls of various
colours and sizes, which he disposed in strange figures upon the floor
beside him. And now Tangle felt that there was something in her
knowledge which was not in her understanding. For she knew there must
be an infinite meaning in the change and sequence and individual forms
of the figures into which the child arranged the balls, as well as in
the varied harmonies of their colours, but what it all meant she could
not tell. He went on busily, tirelessly, playing his solitary game,
without looking up, or seeming to know that there was a stranger in his
deep-withdrawn cell. Diligently as a lace-maker shifts her bobbins, he
shifted and arranged his balls. Flashes of meaning would now pass from
them to Tangle, and now again all would be not merely obscure, but
utterly dark. She stood looking for a long time, for there was
fascination in the sight; and the longer she looked the more an
indescribable vague intelligence went on rousing itself in her mind.
For seven years she had stood there watching the naked child with his
coloured balls, and it seemed to her like seven hours, when all at once
the shape the balls took, she knew not why, reminded her of the Valley
of Shadows, and she spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where is the Old Man of the Fire?" she said.</p>

<p>"Here I am," answered the child, rising and leaving his balls on the
moss. "What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>There was such an awfulness of absolute repose on the face of the
child that Tangle stood dumb before him. He had no smile, but the love
in his large grey eyes was deep as the centre. And with the repose
there lay on his face a shimmer as of moonlight, which seemed as if any
moment it might break into such a ravishing smile as would cause the
beholder to weep himself to death. But the smile never came, and the
moonlight lay there unbroken. For the heart of the child was too deep
for any smile to reach from it to his face.</p>

<p>"Are you the oldest man of all?" Tangle at length, although filled
with awe, ventured to ask.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. I am very, very old. I am able to help you, I know. I
can help everybody."</p>

<p>And the child drew near and looked up in her face so that she burst
into tears.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me the way to the country the shadows fall from?" she
sobbed.</p>

<p>"Yes. I know the way quite well. I go there myself sometimes. But
you could not go my way; you are not old enough. I will show you how
you can go."</p>

<p>"Do not send me out into the great heat again," prayed Tangle.</p>

<p>"I will not," answered the child.</p>

<p>And he reached up, and put his little cool hand on her heart.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "you can go. The fire will not burn you. Come."</p>

<p>He led her from the cave, and following him through an other
archway, she found herself in a vast desert of sand and rock. The sky
of it was of rock, lowering over them like solid thunderclouds; and the
whole place was so hot that she saw, in bright rivulets, the yellow
gold and white silver and red copper trickling molten from the rocks.
But the heat never came near her.</p>

<p>When they had gone some distance, the child turned up a great stone,
and took something like an egg from under it. He next drew a long
curved line in the sand with his finger, and laid the egg in it. He
then spoke something Tangle could not understand. The egg broke, a
small snake came out, and, lying in the line in the sand, grew and grew
till he filled it. The moment he was thus full-grown, he began to glide
away, undulating like a sea-wave.</p>

<p>"Follow that serpent," said the child. "He will lead you the right
way."</p>

<p>Tangle followed the serpent. But she could not go far with out
looking back at the marvellous Child. He stood alone in the midst of
the glowing desert, beside a fountain of red flame that had burst forth
at his feet, his naked whiteness glimmering a pale rosy red in the
torrid fire. There he stood, looking after her, till, from the
lengthening distance, she could see him no more. The serpent went
straight on, turning neither to the right nor left.</p>

<p>Meantime Mossy had got out of the lake of shadows and, following his
mournful, lonely way, had reached the seashore. It was a dark, stormy
evening. The sun had set. The wind was blowing from the sea. The waves
had surrounded the rock within which lay the Old Man's house. A deep
water rolled between it and the shore, upon which a majestic figure was
walking alone.</p>

<p>Mossy went up to him and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you tell me where to find the Old Man of the Sea?"</p>

<p>"I am the Old Man of the Sea," the figure answered.</p>

<p>"I see a strong kingly man of middle age," returned Mossy.</p>

<p>Then the Old Man looked at him more intently, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your sight, young man, is better than that of most who take this
way. The night is stormy: come to my house and tell me what I can do
for you."</p>

<p>Mossy followed him. The waves flew from before the footsteps of the
Old Man of the Sea, and Mossy followed upon dry sand.</p>

<p>When they had reached the cave, they sat down and gazed at each
other.</p>

<p>Now Mossy was an old man by this time. He looked much older than the
Old Man of the Sea, and his feet were very weary.</p>

<p>After looking at him for a moment, the Old Man took him by the hand
and led him into his inner cave. There he helped him to undress, and
laid him in the bath. And he saw that one of his hands Mossy did not
open.</p>

<p>"What have you got in that hand?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mossy opened his hand, and there lay the golden key.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Old Man, "that accounts for your knowing me. And I
know the way you have to go."</p>

<p>"I want to find the country whence the shadows fall," said
Mossy.</p>

<p>"I dare say you do. So do I. But meantime, one thing is
certain.&mdash;what is that key for, do you think?"</p>

<p>"For a keyhole somewhere. But I don't know why I keep it. I never
could find the keyhole. And I have lived a good while, I believe," said
Mossy, sadly. "I'm not sure that I'm not old. I know my feet ache."</p>

<p>"Do they?" said the Old Man, as if he really meant to ask the
question; and Mossy, who was still lying in the bath, watched his feet
for a moment before he replied.</p>

<p>"No, they do not," he answered. "Perhaps I am not old either."</p>

<p>"Get up and look at yourself in the water."</p>

<p>He rose and looked at himself in the water, and there was not a grey
hair on his head or a wrinkle on his skin.</p>

<p>"You have tasted of death now," said the Old Man. "Is it good?"</p>

<p>"It is good," said Mossy. "It is better than life."</p>

<p>"No," said the Old Man, "it is only more life.&mdash;Your feet will make
no holes in the water now."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I will show you that presently."</p>

<p>They returned to the outer cave, and sat and talked together for a
long time. At length the Old Man of the Sea rose, and said to
Mossy,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Follow me."</p>

<p>He led him up the stair again, and opened another door. They stood
on the level of the raging sea, looking towards the east. Across the
waste of waters, against the bosom of a fierce black cloud, stood the
foot of a rainbow, glowing in the dark.</p>

<p>"This indeed is my way," said Mossy, as soon as he saw the rainbow,
and stepped out upon the sea. His feet made no holes in the water. He
fought the wind, and climbed the waves, and went on towards the
rainbow.</p>

<p>The storm died away. A lovely day and a lovelier night followed. A
cool wind blew over the wide plain of the quiet ocean. And still Mossy
journeyed eastward. But the rainbow had vanished with the storm.</p>

<p>Day after day he held on, and he thought he had no guide. He did not
see how a shining fish under the waters directed his steps. He crossed
the sea, and came to a great precipice of rock, up which he could
discover but one path. Nor did this lead him farther than half-way up
the rock, where it ended on a platform. Here he stood and pondered.&mdash;It
could not be that the way stopped here, else what was the path for? It
was a rough path, not very plain, yet certainly a path.&mdash;He examined
the face of the rock. It was smooth as glass. But as his eyes kept
roving hopelessly over it, something glittered, and he caught sight of
a row of small sapphires. They bordered a little hole in the rock.</p>

<p>"The keyhole!" he cried.</p>

<p>He tried the key. It fitted. It turned. A great clang and clash, as
of iron bolts on huge brazen caldrons, echoed thunderously within. He
drew out the key. The rock in front of him began to fall. He retreated
from it as far as the breadth of the platform would allow. A great slab
fell at his feet. In front was still the solid rock, with this one slab
fallen forward out of it. But the moment he stepped upon it, a second
fell, just short of the edge of the first, making the next step of a
stair, which thus kept dropping itself before him as he ascended into
the heart of the precipice. It led him into a hall fit for such an
approach&mdash;irregular and rude in formation, but floor, sides, pillars,
and vaulted roof, all one mass of shining stones of every colour that
light can show. In the centre stood seven columns, ranged from red to
violet. And on the pedestal of one of them sat a woman, motionless,
with her face bowed upon her knees. Seven years had she sat there
waiting. She lifted her head as Mossy drew near. It was Tangle. Her
hair had grown to her feet, and was rippled like the windless sea on
broad sands. Her face was beautiful, like her grandmother's, and as
still and peaceful as that of the Old Man of the Fire. Her form was
tall and noble. Yet Mossy knew her at once.</p>

<p>"How beautiful you are, Tangle!" he said, in delight and
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Am I?" she returned. "Oh, I have waited for you so long! But you,
you are the Old Man of the Sea. No. You are like the Old Man of the
Earth. No, no. You are like the oldest man of all. You are like them
all. And yet you are my own old Mossy! How did you come here? What did
you do after I lost you? Did you find the keyhole? Have you got the key
still?"</p>

<p>She had a hundred questions to ask him, and he a hundred more to ask
her. They told each other all their adventures, and were as happy as
man and woman could be. For they were younger and better, and stronger
and wiser, than they had ever been before.</p>

<p>It began to grow dark. And they wanted more than ever to reach the
country whence the shadows fall. So they looked about them for a way
out of the cave. The door by which Mossy entered had closed again, and
there was half a mile of rock between them and the sea. Neither could
Tangle find the opening in the floor by which the serpent had led her
thither. They searched till it grew so dark that they could see
nothing, and gave it up.</p>

<p>After a while, however, the cave began to glimmer again. The light
came from the moon, but it did not look like moon light, for it gleamed
through those seven pillars in the middle, and filled the place with
all colours. And now Mossy saw that there was a pillar beside the red
one, which he had not observed before. And it was of the same new
colour that he had seen in the rainbow when he saw it first in the
fairy forest. And on it he saw a sparkle of blue. It was the sapphires
round the keyhole.</p>

<p>He took his key. It turned in the lock to the sounds of Aeolian
music. A door opened upon slow hinges, and disclosed a winding stair
within. The key vanished from his fingers. Tangle went up. Mossy
followed. The door closed behind them. They climbed out of the earth;
and, still climbing, rose above it. They were in the rainbow. Far
abroad, over ocean and land, they could see through its transparent
walls the earth beneath their feet. Stairs beside stairs wound up
together, and beautiful beings of all ages climbed along with them.</p>

<p>They knew that they were going up to the country whence the shadows
fall.</p>

<p>And by this time I think they must have got there.</p>
