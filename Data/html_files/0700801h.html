  ERNEST LOCKHART, BARRISTER AT LAW</h2>

  <h2><a name="ch1-1"
     id="ch1-1"></a>I. &mdash; A GOSSIPY CHAPTER IN WHICH COMING<br>
  EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE THEM</h2>

  <p class="first">I have been asked to make my contribution to the curious
  history of the disappearance of Mr. Daniel Penrose, and I accordingly do so;
  but not without reluctance and a feeling that my contribution is but a
  retailing of the smallest of small beer. For the truth is that of that
  strange disappearance I knew nothing at the time, and, even now, my knowledge
  is limited to what I have learned from those who were directly concerned in
  the investigation. Still, I am assured that the little that I have to tell
  will elucidate the accounts which the investigators will presently render of
  the affair, and I shall, therefore, with the above disclaimer, proceed with
  my somewhat trivial narrative.</p>

  <p>Whenever my thoughts turn to that extraordinary case, there rises before
  me the picture of a certain antique shop in a by-street of Soho. And quite
  naturally; for it was in that shop that I first set eyes on Daniel Penrose,
  and it was in connection with that that my not very intimate relations with
  Penrose existed.</p>

  <p>It was a queer little shop; an antique shop in both senses. For not only
  were the goods that it contained one and all survivors from the past, but the
  shop was an antique in itself. Indeed, it was probably a more genuine museum
  piece than anything in its varied and venerable stock, with its small-paned
  window bulging in a double curve&mdash;as shop-fitters could make them in the
  eighteenth century&mdash;and glazed with the original crown glass, greenish
  in tone and faintly streaked, like an oyster-shell, with concentric lines. I
  dated the shop at the first half of the eighteenth century, basing my
  estimate on a pedimented stone tablet at the corner of the street; which set
  forth the name, "Nassau Street in Whetten's Buildings," and the date, 1734.
  It was a pleasant and friendly shop, though dingy; dignified and reticent,
  too, for the fascia above the window bore only, in dull gilt letters, the
  name of the proprietor, "D. Parrott."</p>

  <p>For some time I remained under the belief that this superscription
  referred to some former incumbent of the premises whose name was retained for
  the sake of continuity, since the only persons whom I encountered in my early
  visits were Mrs. Pettigrew, who appeared to manage the business, and, more
  rarely, her daughter, Joan, a strikingly good-looking girl of about twenty; a
  very modern young lady, frank, friendly and self-possessed, quite well
  informed on the subject of antiques, though openly contemptuous of the whole
  genus.</p>

  <p>Presently, however, I discovered that Parrott, so far from being a mere
  disembodied name, was a very real person. He was, in fact, the mainspring of
  the establishment, for he was not only the buyer&mdash;and an uncommonly good
  buyer&mdash;but he had quite a genius for converting mere dismembered
  carcasses into hale and hearty pieces of furniture. Somewhere in the regions
  behind the shop he had a workshop where, with the aid of an incredibly aged
  cabinet-maker named Tims, he carried out the necessary restorations. And they
  were real restorations, not fakes; honest repairs carried out for structural
  reasons and left open and undisguised. I came to have a great respect for Mr.
  Parrott.</p>

  <p>My first visit was undoubtedly due to the ancient shop-front. But when I
  crossed the narrow street to examine it and discovered in the window a court
  cupboard and a couple of Jacobean chairs, I decided to avail myself of the
  courteous invitation, written on a card, to enter and inspect and indulge a
  mild passion for ancient furniture.</p>

  <p>There were three persons in the shop; a comely woman of about fifty, who
  greeted me with a smile and a little bow, and thereafter took no further
  notice of me; a stout, jovial, rather foxy-looking gentleman who was
  inspecting a trayful of old silver; and a small clerical-looking gentleman
  who appeared to be disembowelling a bloated verge watch and prying into its
  interior through a watchmaker's eye-glass, which stuck miraculously in his
  eye, giving him somewhat the appearance of a one-eyed lobster.</p>

  <p>"Now," said the stout gentleman, "that's quite an elegant little milk-jug,
  in my opinion. Don't you agree with me, Mrs. Pettigrew?"</p>

  <p>I looked at him in some surprise. For the thing was not a milk-jug. It was
  a coffee-pot. However, Mrs. Pettigrew did not contest the description. She
  merely agreed that the shape was pleasant and graceful.</p>

  <p>"I am glad, Mrs. Pettigrew," said the stout gentleman, regarding the
  coffee-pot with his head on one side, "that you regard the lactiferous
  receptacle with favour. I am encouraged and confirmed. The next question is
  that of the date of its birthday. I am reluctant to interrupt the erudite Mr.
  Polton in his studies of the internal anatomy of the Carolean warming-pan,
  but I have no skill in galactophorous genealogies. May I venture?"</p>

  <p>He held out the coffee-pot engagingly towards the small gentleman, who
  thereupon laid the watch down tenderly, removed the eye-glass from his eye
  and smiled. And I found Mr. Polton's smile almost as astonishing as the other
  gentleman's vocabulary. It was the most amazingly wrinkly smile that I have
  ever seen, but yet singularly genial and pleasant. And here I may remark that
  this amiable little gentleman was for some time a profound mystery to me. I
  could make nothing of him. I could not place him socially or otherwise. By
  his appearance, he might&mdash;in different raiment&mdash;have been a
  dignitary of the Church. His deferential manner suggested some superlative
  kind of manservant, but his hands and his comprehensive and inexhaustible
  knowledge of the products of the ancient crafts hinted at the dealer or
  expert collector. It was only after I had known him some months that the
  mystery was resolved through the medium of a legal friend, as will be related
  in due course. To return to the present incident, Mr. Polton took the
  coffee-pot in his curiously prehensile hands, beamed on it approvingly, and,
  having stuck his eye-glass in his eye, examined the hall-mark and the maker's
  "touch."</p>

  <p>"It was made," he reported, "in 1765 by a man named John Hammond, who had
  a shop in Water Lane, Fleet Street. And an excellent tradesman he must have
  been."</p>

  <p>"There, now!" exclaimed the stout gentleman. "Just listen to that! It's my
  belief that Mr. Polton carries in his head a complete directory of all the
  artful craftsmen and crafty artists who ever made anything, with the dates of
  every piece they made. Don't you agree, Mrs. Pettigrew?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed!" she replied. "His knowledge is perfectly wonderful.
  Perhaps," she added, addressing Mr. Polton, "you can tell us something about
  that watch. It is said to have belonged to Prince Charlie, and, of course,
  that would add to its value if it were really the fact. What do you think,
  Mr. Polton?"</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am," was the cautious reply, "I see no reason why it should not
  have belonged to him, if he was not a very punctual gentleman. It was made in
  Edinburgh in 1735, and there is a crucifix engraved inside the outer case. I
  don't know what the significance of that may be."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," said the lady. "What do you think, Mr. Penrose?"</p>

  <p>"I should say," replied the stout gentleman, "that the evidence is
  conclusive. Charles Edward, being a Scotchman, would have a Scottish watch;
  and being a papistical Romanist would naturally have a crucifix engraved in
  it. Q.E.D."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pettigrew smiled indulgently, and, as Mr. Penrose had indicated his
  adoption of the coffee-pot, she proceeded to swathe it in tissue-paper and
  make it up into a presentable parcel; and, meanwhile, I browsed round the
  premises and inspected those specimens of the stock which were more
  particularly within my province. But it was not a very peaceful inspection,
  for Mr. Penrose persisted in accompanying me and expounding and commenting
  upon the various pieces in terms which I found rather distracting. For Mr.
  Penrose, as the reader has probably observed, was a wag, and his waggery took
  the form of calling things by quaintly erroneous names and of using odd and
  facetious circumlocutions; which was all very well at first and was even
  mildly amusing, but it very soon became tiresome. A constant effort was
  necessary to arrive at what he really meant.</p>

  <p>However, in the end, I lighted upon a bible-box of dark-brown oak,
  pleasantly carved and bearing the incised date, 1653, and, as the little
  chest rather took my fancy and the price marked on the attached ticket seemed
  less than its value, I closed with Mrs. Pettigrew, and, having paid for my
  purchase and given the address to which it was to be sent, took my departure.
  And, as I strolled at a leisurely pace in the direction of Wardour Street, I
  reflected idly on my late experience, and especially on the three rather
  unusual persons whose acquaintance I had just made. I am not in general a
  curious man, but I found in each of these three persons matter for
  speculation. There was Mrs. Pettigrew, for instance. Admirably as she played
  her part in the economy of the shop, she did not completely fit her
  surroundings. One is accustomed nowadays to finding women of a very superior
  class serving in shops. But not quite of Mrs. Pettigrew's type. She gave me
  the impression of being very definitely a lady; and I found myself
  speculating on the turn of the wheel of Fortune that had brought her
  there.</p>

  <p>Then there was the enigmatical Mr. Polton with his strangely prehensile
  hands and his astonishing memory for hall-marks. And there was the facetious
  Penrose. And at this point, being then about halfway along Gerrard Street,
  the subject of my reflections overtook me and announced himself
  characteristically by expressing the hope that I was pleased with my bacon
  cupboard. I replied that I was quite pleased with my purchase and had thought
  it decidedly cheap.</p>

  <p>"So did I," said he. "But our psittacoid friend has the wisdom to temper
  the breeze to the shorn collector."</p>

  <p>"Our psittacoid friend?" I repeated.</p>

  <p>"I refer to the tropic bird who presides over the museum of domestic
  archaeology," he explained, and, as I still looked at him questioningly, he
  added, by way of elucidation: "The proprietor of the treasure-house of
  antiquities in which you discovered the repository of ancestral piety."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" I exclaimed. "You mean Mr. Parrott."</p>

  <p>"Certainly!" he replied. "Did I not say so?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you did," I admitted, with a slightly sour laugh; at which he
  smiled his peculiar, foxy smile, looking at me out of the corners of his
  eyes, and evidently pleased at having "stumped" me. It was a pleasure that he
  must have enjoyed pretty often.</p>

  <p>"I take it," he resumed, after a short pause, "that you, like myself, are
  a devotee of St. Margaret Pie?"</p>

  <p>I considered this fresh puzzle and decided that the solution was "magpie";
  and apparently I was right as he did not correct me.</p>

  <p>"No," I replied, "there is nothing of the magpie about me. I don't
  accumulate old things for the sake of forming a collection. I buy old
  furniture and use it. One must have furniture of some kind, old or new, and I
  prefer the old. It was made by men who knew all about it and who enjoyed
  making it and took their time. It is much more companionable to live with
  than new machine-made stuff, turned out by the thousand by people who don't
  care a straw what it is like. But my object is quite utilitarian. I am no
  collector."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said he, "that isn't my case. I am a convinced disciple of the great
  John Daw, a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles, a hoarder of miscellaneous
  treasure. Nothing comes amiss to me, from a blue diamond to a Staffordshire
  dog."</p>

  <p>"Have you no special fancy?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I have a special fancy for any relic of the past that I can lay hands
  on," he replied. "But perhaps, like the burglars, I have a particular leaning
  towards precious stones&mdash;those and the other kind of stones&mdash;the
  siliceous variety&mdash;with which our impolite forefathers used to fracture
  one another's craniums."</p>

  <p>"Your collection must take up a lot of space," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"It does," said he. "That's the trouble. John Daw's nest has a tendency to
  overflow. And still they come. I'm always finding fresh treasures."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said I, "where do you find the stuff?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, call it not stuff," he protested, regarding me with a foxy smile. "I
  spoke of treasures. As to where I discover them; well, well, surely there is
  a mine for silver and a place for gold where they refine it; a place
  also&mdash;many places, mostly cottage parlours, that no bird of prey
  knoweth, neither hath the travelling dealer's eye seen them, where may be
  found ancestral Wrotham pots and Staffordshire figures, to say nothing of
  venerable tickers and crocks from far Cathay. These the wise collector makes
  a note of&mdash;and locks up the note."</p>

  <p>I was half amused and half exasperated by his evasive verbiage and his
  unabashed, and quite unnecessary caution. A mighty secretive gentleman, this,
  I reflected; and proceeded to fire a return shot.</p>

  <p>"In effect," said I, "you go rooting about in cottage parlours, snapping
  up rustic heirlooms, probably at a fraction of their value."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," he agreed, with a snigger. "That is the essence of the
  sport. I once, in a labourer's cottage, picked up a genuine 'Vicar and Moses'
  by Ralph Wood for five shillings. But that was a windfall."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't much of a windfall for the owner," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"He was quite satisfied," said Penrose, "and so was I. What more would you
  have? But windfalls are not frequent, and when they fail I fall back on the
  popinjay."</p>

  <p>"The pop&mdash;Oh, you mean Mr. Parrott?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said he. "Our friend Monsieur le Perroquet. Actually, I let him
  do most of the rooting about. He knows all the ropes, and, as we agreed, he
  doesn't demand payment through the proboscis."</p>

  <p>"No," said I, "he doesn't appear to be grasping, to judge by the price of
  my own purchase; and I gather that you have got most of your stuff&mdash;I
  beg pardon; treasure&mdash;from him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I wouldn't say that," he replied. "Mere purchase from a dealer is a
  dull affair, though necessary. But one wants the sport as well, the pleasure
  of the chase, not to mention those of the pick and shovel."</p>

  <p>"The pick and shovel!" I repeated. "That sounds as if you did a little in
  the resurrection line. You are not a tomb-robber, I trust?"</p>

  <p>I was, of course, only jesting, but he took me up quite seriously.</p>

  <p>"But why not? We may grant the impropriety of disturbing the repose of the
  freeholders in Finchley Cemetery. Besides, they have nothing but their bones,
  which, at present, are not collector's pieces. But our rude forefathers had a
  foolish&mdash;but, for us, convenient&mdash;habit of taking their goods and
  chattels to bed with them, so to speak. Now, a man's title to his goods,
  after his decease, does not extend to an indefinite period. When a deceased
  gentleman has enjoyed the possession of his chattels for a couple of thousand
  years or more, I think he ought to be satisfied. His title has lapsed by the
  effluxion of time; and my title, by right of discovery, has come into being.
  The expression 'tomb-robber' is not applicable to an archaeological
  excavator. Don't you agree?"</p>

  <p>I admitted that excavation for scientific purposes seemed to be a
  permissible proceeding, though I had secret doubts as to whether the
  expression was properly applicable to his activities. He did not impress me
  as a scientific investigator.</p>

  <p>"But," I asked, "what sort of things do you turn up when you go
  a-digging?"</p>

  <p>"All sorts of things," he replied. "Mostly preposterous stone substitutes
  for cutlery, decayed and fragmentary pots and pans, with an
  occasional&mdash;very occasional&mdash;torque or brooch and portions of the
  deceased proprietor. But I leave those. I don't collect proprietors."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose," said I, "that when you find a gold or silver ornament you
  notify the coroner of the discovery of treasure trove?"</p>

  <p>"That," he replied with his queer, foxy smile, "is indispensable. But you
  seem to be interested in my miscellaneous gleanings. I wonder if you would
  care to cast a supercilious eye on my little hoard. I don't often display my
  treasures because your regular collector is usually a man of one
  idea&mdash;indefinitely repeated&mdash;and he is disappointed to find that I
  am not. But you, like myself, are more eclectic in taste and I should have
  great pleasure in introducing you to Aladdin's Cave, if you would care to
  inspect its contents."</p>

  <p>I was not, really, particularly interested, but yet I was faintly curious
  as to the nature of his "hoard." It sounded like a very queer collection, and
  might include some objects of real interest. Besides which, the man, himself,
  despite his exasperating verbosity and obscurities of speech, rather
  attracted me. Accordingly, I accepted his invitation, and, when we had
  exchanged visiting cards and arranged the day and hour of my visit, we
  separated; he shaping a course in a westerly direction and I bearing east,
  towards my chambers in Lincoln's Inn.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-2"
     id="ch1-2"></a>II. &mdash; ALADDIN'S CAVE</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Penrose's residence or John Daw's Nest, as he would have
  called it, was situated in Queen Square, Bloomsbury, and, what is more, it
  was one of the few remaining original houses, dating back to the time when
  residents could look out of their windows through the open end of the square,
  across the meadows to the heights of Highgate. Appropriately to the house of
  a collector of antiquities, its door was garnished with a pair of
  link-extinguishers, as well as with a fine brass knocker and an old-fashioned
  bell-handle.</p>

  <p>A flourish on the knocker, reinforced by a hearty tug at the bell-pull,
  resulted in the opening of the door and the appearance thereat of an elderly
  man of depressed and nephritic aspect, with puffy eyelids and a complexion
  like that of a suet pudding. He received the announcement of my identity with
  resignation, and, having admitted me, took my hat and stick and silently
  introduced me to a small room, the window of which commanded a view of the
  leaden statue of Her late Majesty, Queen Anne. At this window I had taken up
  a position from which I could contemplate that rather neglected example of an
  extinct art when the door opened briskly and Mr. Penrose entered.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said he, "I see you are admiring the mimic rendering of our
  proverbially deceased twenty-shilling Lady."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said I, as we shook hands, "that your paraphrase fails in
  precision. You would have to pay thirty shillings to-day to buy a sovereign,
  if you could find one."</p>

  <p>"There," he retorted, "is exemplified the pedantic accuracy of the legal
  mind. But I spoke in terms of the past. The aureous reality is now as dead as
  madame herself. But what think you of that masterpiece of the plumber's art?
  I rather like it; and it is the genuine metal. I have tried it with my
  pocket-knife. To tell you a little secret, I had thought of making an offer
  for it."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," I exclaimed, "that you want to buy it?"</p>

  <p>"If it should come into the market," he replied. "Unfortunately it has
  not, up to the present."</p>

  <p>"But what on earth could you do with a leaden statue?" I protested.</p>

  <p>"Put it in my gallery," he replied, "if the floor would stand it."</p>

  <p>"You can take it," said I, "that it would not. Why, the thing must weigh
  tons. Besides, it is much better in the place that it was made to occupy and
  which it does really adorn in its rather mouldy way."</p>

  <p>"In short," said he, "you think me a bit of a vandal" (which was the
  literal truth). "Well, you needn't be alarmed. It is safe from my acquisitive
  instincts for the present."</p>

  <p>He turned to a nondescript piece of furniture, half cupboard and half
  armoire, and, opening a door, took out a decanter and two glasses, which he
  placed on the table.</p>

  <p>"Before we venture into Aladdin's Cave," said he, taking out the stopper
  of the decanter, "shall we fortify ourselves with a morsel of cake?"</p>

  <p>He looked at me interrogatively as he picked up the decanter. Of course,
  there was no cake visible; but my growing skill in interpreting his verbal
  puzzles enabled me to diagnose the dark-brown wine as Madeira.</p>

  <p>Without giving me time to refuse, he filled the two glasses, and, having
  handed me one, proceeded in a very deliberate and workmanlike fashion to
  empty the other.</p>

  <p>"The vintages of the Fortunate Isles," said he, as he refilled his glass,
  "have always commended themselves to me, rivalled only in my affection by the
  product of the vines of Xeres" (he pronounced the name in the Spanish manner,
  "Hereth," as a slight additional precaution against being too readily
  understood), "preferably the elderly and fuscous variety."</p>

  <p>I noted the fact&mdash;while he filled his third glass&mdash;as explaining
  the vinous aroma which I had noticed in Parrott's shop as apparently exhaling
  from his person. It turned out later to be not without significance. Madeira
  and old brown sherry by no means share the innocuousness of what Penrose
  would probably have called "the celestial herb."</p>

  <p>When I had resolutely declined a refill, he reluctantly returned the
  decanter to its abiding-place and locked the door thereof.</p>

  <p>"And now," said he, "we shall proceed to explore the secret recesses of
  the cavern."</p>

  <p>He conducted me out into the fine, spacious hall, from which a noble
  staircase gave access to the upper floors. In one swift glance I noted that
  the appointments were not worthy of the architecture, for the
  furniture&mdash;of which there was a good deal too much&mdash;consisted of
  undeniable "dentist's oak," and there were one or two shabby-looking busts,
  the obvious plaster of which had been varnished by some optimist in the hope
  that they might thereby be mistaken for bronze. But I had little opportunity
  for detailed inspection, for my host threw open, with something of a
  flourish, an adjacent door and motioned to me to enter; which I did, and
  found myself in one of a pair of great, lofty communicating rooms, and
  forthwith began my tour of inspection.</p>

  <p>I had expected to find Mr. Penrose's collection something of an oddity,
  but the reality far exceeded my expectations. It was an amazing hoard. Alike,
  in respect of matter and manner, it was astonishing and bewildering. Of the
  ordinary collector's fastidious selection, prim tidiness and orderly
  arrangement there was no trace. The things that jostled one another on the
  crowded shelves and tables were in every respect incongruous; for, on the one
  hand, rare and valuable pieces, such as the "Vicar and Moses" and a fine
  slip-ware tyg, stood check by jowl with common, worthless oddments, and, on
  the other, the objects themselves were devoid of any sort of kinship or
  relation. The "Vicar," for instance, was accompanied by a broken Roman pot, a
  few worthless fragments of Samian ware, a dried crab covered with acorn
  barnacles and half a dozen horse-brasses; while the tyg had as its immediate
  neighbour a Sheffield coffee-pot, a Tunbridge-ware wafer-box, a pewter
  candlestick and one or two flint implements.</p>

  <p>The confusion and disorder that prevailed were perfectly astounding. These
  fine old rooms, with such splendid possibilities, suggested nothing more or
  less than the store of some curio dealer or the premises of an auctioneer on
  the day preceding a sale of miscellaneous property. I ventured tentatively to
  comment on the lack of arrangement.</p>

  <p>"You have certainly got a very remarkable collection," said I, "but don't
  you think that its interest would be increased if you adopted some sort of
  classification? Here, for instance, is a wine-glass, a Jacobite glass,
  apparently."</p>

  <p>"Not apparently," he objected. "Actually. An undoubtedly genuine piece. An
  appropriate memorial, too. 'Charlie loved good ale and wine.'"</p>

  <p>"So he did, as 'his nose doth show' in the portraits. But why put this
  glass next to that barbaric-looking pot? There is no relation whatever
  between the two things."</p>

  <p>"There is the relation of unlikeness," he replied. "And don't disparage
  that rare and precious pot. It is extremely ancient. Prehistoric. Neolithic,
  I believe, is the correct word."</p>

  <p>"But why not put all the prehistoric pots together instead of mixing them
  up with table-glass and Scandinavian carvings?"</p>

  <p>"That would seem a dull arrangement," said he. "You would lose the effect
  of variety, the thrill of unexpectedness. How delightful, for instance, after
  considering this book of hours and this highly ornate
  sternutatorium"&mdash;he indicated a handsome tortoise-shell
  snuff-box&mdash;"to come upon these siliceous relics of the childhood of the
  race&mdash;also neolithic, I believe&mdash;the products of my own fossatory
  activities."</p>

  <p>The "relics" referred to consisted of half a dozen rough flint nodules
  which looked as if they might have been gathered from a road-mender's heap.
  They may have been genuine flint implements, but they were certainly not
  neolithic. No one with the most elementary knowledge of stone implements
  could have supposed that they were. But my host's easy-going acceptance of
  them, and his indifference as to the actual facts, brought home to me a state
  of mind at which I wondered more and more as I examined this amazing
  collection.</p>

  <p>For, in the first place, Mr. Penrose displayed the most complete and
  comprehensive ignorance of "antiques" of every kind. He knew no more of them
  than their names, and he frequently got those wrong. But not only was he
  ignorant. He was quite indifferent. He seemed to be totally devoid of
  interest in the individual things which he had accumulated; and the question
  that I asked myself was what earthly object he could have had in making this
  enormous and miscellaneous collection. Apparently, he was possessed by an
  insatiable acquisitiveness, with no other motive behind it. Mere possession
  seemed to be the object of his desire; and with mere possession he appeared
  to be satisfied. Not without reason had he likened himself to "The Great John
  Daw."</p>

  <p>My long tour of inspection came at last to an end. I had examined the
  collection very thoroughly, not only to please my host&mdash;though he was
  evidently gratified and flattered by the interest that I displayed in his
  "hoard"&mdash;but because it contained, mingled with a good deal of rubbish,
  many curious and beautiful objects that invited examination. The last piece
  that I inspected was an ancient gold brooch, richly decorated with gilt
  filigree work and set with garnets. I lifted it tenderly from the dusty scrap
  of paper (marked in pencil with the number 963) on which it rested and
  carried it to the window to look at it in a better light.</p>

  <p>"This is a very fine piece of work, Mr. Penrose," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said he, "the papistical fibula commends itself. I am glad you like
  it."</p>

  <p>"A Roman fibula!" I exclaimed in surprise. "I should have taken it for a
  Saxon brooch."</p>

  <p>"You may be right," he admitted; "in fact, I am inclined to think that you
  are. At any rate, it is one or the other."</p>

  <p>"But," I protested, "surely you keep some sort of record. I see that the
  pieces are numbered. Haven't you a catalogue?"</p>

  <p>"To be sure I have," he replied. "Excellent idea! We'll get out the
  Domesday Book and see which of us is right."</p>

  <p>He pulled out the drawer of a table and produced therefrom a manuscript
  book which he opened and began to turn over the leaves. Still holding the
  brooch, I stepped across to him and looked over his shoulder. And then I got
  a fresh surprise, though I ought to have been prepared for something unusual.
  For if the collection was eccentric, the catalogue was positively fantastic.
  It seemed to be (and probably was) expressly designed to be as completely
  unintelligible as possible. The brief entries, scribbled illegibly in pencil,
  were apparently worded in Mr. Penrose's peculiar, cryptic dialect, and, for
  the most part, I could make nothing of them. Running my eye down the pages, I
  deciphered with difficulty such entries as: "Up +. Mudlarks," "Sammy. Pot
  sand. Sinbad," "Funereal flower-pot, Julie-Polly," "Carver, Jul. Pop."</p>

  <p>I stood gazing in speechless astonishment at this amazing record while
  Penrose slowly turned the leaves, glancing slyly at me from time to time,
  apparently to see how I took it. At length&mdash;at unnecessary
  length&mdash;Number 963 was found; but it was not very illuminating&mdash;to
  me&mdash;for it consisted only of the laconic statement, "Sweeney's
  resurrection." Apparently, however, it conveyed something to him, for he
  said, "Yes, you are right. I recollect now." But he did not enter into any
  particulars.</p>

  <p>I laid the brooch down on its slip of paper and began to think of
  departing; and meanwhile he looked at me with a very odd expression; an
  expression of mingled anxiety and hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I have to thank you, Mr. Penrose," said I, "for a very pleasant and
  profitable afternoon. It was very good of you to let me see all your
  treasures. I have seen them all, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>He did not reply for a few moments, but continued to look at me in that
  queer, anxious, irresolute fashion. Suddenly, his hesitation gave way and he
  burst out in low, impressive tones, in a manner of the deepest secrecy:</p>

  <p>"The fact is that you haven't. There is another little hoard, which I
  don't show to any one, but just float over in secret. I don't even mention
  its existence. But, somehow I feel tempted to make an exception in your case.
  What do you say? Would you like to have a peep at the contents of Bluebeard's
  chamber?"</p>

  <p>"This sounds rather alarming," said I. "Were there not certain penalties
  for undue curiosity?"</p>

  <p>"I hold you immune from those," he replied. "Only I stipulate that this
  private view shall be a really private view, to be spoken of to nobody. I can
  rely on you to keep my secret?"</p>

  <p>I did not much like this. Like most lawyers, I am a cautious man, and
  cautious men do not care to be made the unprivileged repositories of other
  people's secrets. But I could hardly refuse; and when I had, rather
  reluctantly, given the required undertaking, he moved off towards a door in a
  corner of the room and I followed, wondering anxiously what he was going to
  show me and whether it would commit me to any unlawful knowledge.</p>

  <p>The room into which he led me&mdash;and of which he closed and bolted the
  door&mdash;was a smallish apartment, at one end of which was a massive
  mahogany cupboard or armoire. When he had unlocked this and thrown open the
  doors, there was revealed the steel front of a large safe or small
  strong-room. Apparently the safe-key was not in his bunch, for he returned
  the latter to his pocket and then, retiring a few paces, stood with his back
  to me while he dived into some secret recesses of his clothing. In a few
  moments he turned round, rather red from his exertions, and stepped up to the
  safe with the key in his hand, while I watched with growing curiosity.</p>

  <p>The lock clicked softly, a turn of the handle withdrew the bolts and the
  ponderous door swung open, disclosing a range of shallow drawers which
  occupied the whole of the interior. My host, first withdrawing the key and
  slipping it into his waistcoat pocket, proceeded to pull out the top drawer
  and carry it to a table under the window. And then I breathed a sigh of
  relief. There was nothing incriminating, after all. The drawer was simply
  filled with jewellery, looking, indeed, like a tray from a jeweller's window.
  My host's secrecy was naturally and reasonably explained by the value of his
  treasures and their highly portable and negotiable character.</p>

  <p>I looked over the contents of the drawer with keen interest, for I am
  rather fond of gems, though I have no special knowledge of them. My host,
  too, showed a pleasure and enthusiasm in regard to the things, themselves,
  which contrasted strikingly with the indifference that he had displayed
  towards the general collection.</p>

  <p>Yet, even here, there was no glimmer of connoisseur-ship. His manner
  suggested mere miserly gloating; and his ignorance of these beautiful baubles
  astonished me. It was suggested by the absence of any classification, by the
  way in which totally unrelated stones were jumbled together, and the
  suggestion was confirmed by his comments. For instance, in this first drawer
  were two cat's-eyes placed side by side; but they belonged to totally
  different categories. One, a dark yellowish-green stone with a bright band of
  bluish light, was a cymophane or true cat's-eye&mdash;a chrysoberyl. The
  other, a charming stone of the hue known as "honey yellow," was a quartz
  cat's-eye and should have been placed with the other quartz gems. I ventured
  to comment on the fact, referring to the cymophane as a chrysoberyl, but he
  interrupted me with the protest:</p>

  <p>"Chrysoberyl! Violin-bows, my dear sir! Gall not the optic of the fair
  Tabitha a chrysoberyl."</p>

  <p>As he obviously knew&mdash;and cared&mdash;nothing of the actual
  characters of precious stones, I did not pursue the question, but continued
  my inspection of the really interesting and remarkable collection. The
  admiration that I expressed evidently gave him considerable pleasure and he
  also made admiring comments from time to time, though without much appearance
  of taste or discrimination. But his enthusiasm did really wake up when he
  brought forth the third drawer, which was devoted entirely to opals, and as
  these beautiful gems are special favourites of mine, we examined them with
  sympathetic pleasure.</p>

  <p>It was a really magnificent collection, and what rather surprised me
  (considering the collector's comprehensive ignorance) was its genuinely
  representative character. There were specimens of every variety of the gem.
  Of the noble, or precious, opal a long range of examples was shown, of all
  the varied rainbow hues and of various sizes up to nearly an inch in
  diameter; some in plain mounts but most of them encircled with borders of
  rose diamonds or brilliants. There were harlequin opals, Mexican fire opals,
  glowing like blazing coals, black opals, a large series of the common,
  non-prismatic form, of various hues, and one or two examples of the dark,
  pitchy "root" or matrix streaked and speckled with points of prismatic
  colour.</p>

  <p>But the gem of the collection, in interest if not in beauty, was a cameo,
  cut in a disc of precious opal embedded in its dark matrix. The oval slab of
  matrix, carrying the glowing cameo, was worked into a pendant with a broad
  border of small rose diamonds and coloured stones forming the design of a
  rose, a thistle and a central star, while, at the bottom, worked in tiny
  diamonds, was the word "Fiat"; which, with the engraved portrait of a
  middle-aged gentleman in a wig, gave a clue to the significance of the
  jewel.</p>

  <p>As I pored over this curious memorial, Penrose watched me with a smile of
  evident gratification.</p>

  <p>"My favourite child," he remarked, taking it out of its compartment and
  handing it to me, together with a magnifying glass. "Just look at the detail
  of the face."</p>

  <p>I examined it through the lens and was greatly impressed by the perfection
  of the modelling on so minute a scale.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "it is quite a wonderful piece of work. One gets the
  impression that it might be a really good portrait. And now I know," I added,
  as I returned the jewel to him, "why you swore me to secrecy."</p>

  <p>He paused with the trinket in his hand, looking at me with a distinctly
  startled expression.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well," I replied, "you must admit that it is a rather incriminating
  object to have in your possession."</p>

  <p>He gazed at me uneasily, almost with an appearance of alarm, and rejoined:
  "I don't understand you. How, incriminating?"</p>

  <p>I chuckled with mischievous satisfaction. For an inveterate joker, he
  seemed decidedly "slow in the uptake."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it occur to you," I replied, "that a portrait of James Francis
  Edward, the King over the water, cherished secretly by a presumably loyal
  subject of His Majesty George the Fifth, tends to suggest highly improper
  political sentiments? I call it rank sedition."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see what you mean," said he, with an uneasy laugh, apparently
  relieved&mdash;and slightly annoyed&mdash;at my schoolboy jest, "but sedition
  of that kind is a trifle threadbare in these days."</p>

  <p>He returned the jewel to its place in the drawer and carried the latter
  back to the safe. As he slid it in, he remarked:</p>

  <p>"That's the last of the gem collection. The other drawers contain coins.
  You may as well see them, too."</p>

  <p>I went through the coin collection and was rather surprised at its range,
  for it included ancient coins, Greek, Roman, Gaulish and British and English
  coins from the Middle Ages down to the late spade guineas. But all that
  remains in my memory concerning them is that the different periods seemed to
  be mixed up, with an almost total lack of order, and that there appeared to
  be an abnormal proportion of gold coins. When the last of the drawers had
  been examined and returned and the safe and its enclosing cupboard had been
  closed and locked, I began once more to think of taking my leave. But my host
  pressed me to stay and take a cup of tea with him, and, when I had accepted
  his invitation, he conducted me back through the large gallery to the room
  into which I had first been shown. Here, the melancholy manservant&mdash;who
  answered to the name of Kickweed&mdash;presently brought us tea and drew a
  couple of arm-chairs up to the table.</p>

  <p>"This collection of yours," I remarked, as my host poured out the tea,
  "must represent a large amount of sunk capital."</p>

  <p>"I hardly regard it as sunk," he replied, "seeing that I have the use and
  enjoyment of my treasures; but the collection is worth a lot of
  money&mdash;at least, I hope it is. It has cost a lot."</p>

  <p>"So I should suppose," said I; "and it must cost you something quite
  substantial in the matter of insurance."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said he, "I am glad you raised that question. For the fact is that
  the collection is not insured at all. I have intended to go into the matter,
  but there are certain difficulties that have put me off. Now, I dare say you
  know a good deal about insurance."</p>

  <p>"I know something about the legal aspects," I replied, "and such knowledge
  as I possess is at your disposal. You certainly ought to be secured against
  what might be a very heavy loss. What are the difficulties that you refer
  to?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he answered in a low voice, leaning across the table, "I don't
  want to go about proclaiming myself as the owner of a priceless collection.
  Might arouse interest in the wrong quarter, you see. And as to the gems, as I
  told you, they are a secret hoard the existence of which I disclose to nobody
  excepting yourself. You are the only person to whom I have shown them."</p>

  <p>"But," I protested, "somebody must have sold them to you and must be aware
  that you have them."</p>

  <p>"They know that I have&mdash;or had&mdash;the individual jewels that they
  sold me, but they don't know that I have a great and valuable collection. And
  I don't want them to know; but that is the difficulty about the insurance.
  Before I could insure the collection, I should have to get it valued; and the
  valuer would have to see the gems; and then the cat would be out of the bag.
  At least, that is what I suppose. Perhaps I am wrong. Could I effect an
  insurance for a certain definite sum without calling in a valuer?"</p>

  <p>"You mean," I replied, "on a declaration that you had certain property of
  a certain value? No. I think a Company would want evidence that the property
  insured actually existed and was of the value alleged; and in the event of a
  fire or a burglary, they certainly would not pay on property alleged to have
  been lost but which had never been proved to exist. But I think you are
  raising imaginary difficulties. You could stipulate that the valuation should
  be a strictly confidential transaction. Remember that the company's interests
  are the same as your own. If they insure you against burglary, they won't
  want you to be burgled."</p>

  <p>"No, that is true," he admitted. "And you think I could rely on the
  secrecy of the valuer?"</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt of it," I replied, "particularly if you made clear your
  reasons for insisting on secrecy."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you think that," said he, "and I shall act on your advice
  without delay. I will put the case to the manager of the Society which has
  insured this house."</p>

  <p>"I think you ought to do so at once," I urged. "There must be many
  thousands of pounds' worth of property in your collections and a fire or a
  burglary might sweep away the bulk of it in a night."</p>

  <p>He repeated, with emphasis, his intention to attend to the matter without
  further delay, and the subject then dropped. After a little more desultory
  conversation, I rose to take my leave; and the lugubrious Kickweed, having
  presented me with my hat and stick, let me out at the street door with the
  air of admitting me to the family vault.</p>

  <p>As I wended homewards I found ample matter for reflection in the incidents
  of my visit; but chiefly my thoughts concerned themselves with my eccentric
  host. Mr. Penrose was certainly a very strange man, and the more I thought
  about him, the less did I feel able to understand him. He had so many
  oddities, and each of them suggested problems to which I could find no
  solution. There was the collection, for instance. Including the gems and
  coins, it must have been of very great value, and its accumulation must have
  entailed a vast expenditure of time and effort, to say nothing of the
  prodigious sums of money that must have been spent. But with what object? He
  had none of the ordinary collector's expertness and enthusiasm. He had no
  special knowledge of any single class of objects, not even of the gems for
  which he professed so much affection. The motive force that impelled him to
  collect seemed to be simple acquisitiveness, the mere cupiditas habendi.</p>

  <p>But the outstanding feature of his character was secretiveness. He was a
  secret man of the very deepest dye. His inveterate habit of secrecy coloured
  every word and action. The ridiculous jargon that he used, his silly
  circumlocutions and ellipses and paraphrases, were but phases of the
  tendency, as if he grudged to disclose the whole of his meaning. Even the
  preposterous catalogue revealed the same trait, for, while it seemed to have
  been made deliberately unintelligible, it was clear that the absurd entries
  held some hidden meaning which was intelligible to him.</p>

  <p>It was not an endearing trait. None of us likes a secret man. And very
  naturally. For secrecy implies distrust; and, moreover, we are
  apt&mdash;again very naturally&mdash;to assume some reason for the secrecy,
  and to suspect that it is a discreditable reason. Thus it was with me in the
  present case; and my general dislike of the secret habit of mind was
  aggravated by the fact that I had become involved in the secrecy. The promise
  that had been exacted from me in regard to the gems recurred to me with a
  certain distaste and resentment. I was committed to the concealment of a fact
  which was no concern of mine and of the bearings of which I knew nothing. The
  explanations that Penrose had given for keeping secret his precious hoard
  were not unreasonable. But suppose there were other reasons. The thing was
  possible. Some collectors are not over-scrupulous; and I recalled not for the
  first time, the singular, startled expression with which he had looked at me
  when I made my foolish joke about the Jacobite jewel.</p>

  <p>In short, I was not quite comfortable about that promise. There is
  something a little disturbing about a secret hoard of valuable gems; and, but
  for the fact that Penrose was obviously a man of ample means, my professional
  experiences might have caused me to ask myself whether this very odd
  collection might not cover some activities of a more questionable kind.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch1-3"
     id="ch1-3"></a>III. &mdash; EXIT MR. PENROSE</h2>

  <p class="first">I did not see Penrose again for about a fortnight. Then,
  having occasion to call at Parrott's shop to inquire after a gate-leg table
  which I had purchased and which was undergoing some necessary restorations, I
  encountered him, standing opposite to a lantern clock which had been fixed on
  a temporary bracket and was ticking cheerfully with every sign of robust
  health. Noting his evident interest in the venerable timepiece, I stopped to
  discuss it with him.</p>

  <p>"You are looking at that clock, Mr. Penrose," said I, "as if you
  contemplated making an investment."</p>

  <p>"I don't contemplate," he replied. "I investigated in it some time ago. It
  is a poor thing, but mine own."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't call it a poor thing," said I. "It is quite a good clock and
  it looks to me as if it were absolutely intact and in its original condition.
  Which is unusual in the case of lantern clocks. People will tinker at them
  and spoil them. You were lucky to find an untouched specimen."</p>

  <p>"I didn't," said he. "When it came to me&mdash;through the usual
  psittacoid channel&mdash;it was a mere wreck. Some misbegotten Daedalus had
  eviscerated it and wrought havoc with its entrails. Thereupon I sought
  medicinal advice for the invalid and had it put under treatment."</p>

  <p>"You sent it to a clockmaker?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"I did not," he replied. "It had had too much clockmaker already. I
  consulted the erudite and podophthalmate horologer, and behold!&mdash;it has
  renewed its youth like the eagle."</p>

  <p>I must confess that this stumped me for the moment, until a flash of
  supernormal intelligence associated the word "podophthalmate" with Mr.
  Polton's protuberant eye-glass.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that Mr. Polton was a practical mechanic," I remarked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't call him that!" Penrose protested. "He is a magician, a wizard,
  a worker of miracles. By the way, Mrs. Pettigrew, I rather expected to find
  him here. He promised to see this clock safely established in my
  gallery."</p>

  <p>"He is here," replied Mrs. Pettigrew. "He is in the workshop, doing
  something to Mr. Tims's lathe. Would you like to walk across and let him know
  that you have arrived? You know the way. And perhaps, Mr. Lockhart, you would
  like to go and inspect your table? I think Tims wants you to see it."</p>

  <p>I accepted the invitation and, following Penrose, passed out at the back
  of the shop and crossed a small paved yard to a wide doorway. Passing through
  this, I entered a roomy workshop, lighted by a skylight and littered with
  articles of ancient furniture in all stages of decay and dismemberment. There
  were three persons in the workshop. First, there was Mr. Tims, a tall, aged
  man, frail and decrepit of aspect&mdash;until he picked up a tool; when he
  seemed suddenly to develop fresh strength and vitality. Next, there was Mr.
  Polton in shirt-sleeves and an apron (which appeared by its length to have
  been borrowed from Tims), engaged at the moment in re-fixing the head-stock
  of a wood-turner's lathe. The third person was Mr. Parrott, as I learned when
  Penrose greeted him; and, as this was the first time that I had encountered
  him in the flesh, I looked at him with some curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur le Perroquet" was a somewhat unusual-looking man and not at all
  the type of a shopkeeper. Dark, clean-shaved and blue-jowled, he had rather
  the appearance of an actor; and this suggestion was heightened by a certain
  precision of speech and clearness of enunciation, and especially by a
  tendency to the use of studied and appropriate gestures. Obviously, he was
  not only an educated man but what one would call a gentleman; easy and
  pleasant in manner, with that combination of deference and dignity that is
  attainable only by a well-bred man.</p>

  <p>When I had introduced myself, Mr. Tims produced the dismembered table and
  exhibited the repairs on the damaged leg.</p>

  <p>"You see, sir," he explained, "I've cut out the worm-eaten part and let in
  a patch of sound oak. Do you think he'll do?"</p>

  <p>"Do you propose to stain the patch?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"That's as you please," replied Tims. "I wouldn't. A mend's a mend, but a
  stained mend looks like a fake."</p>

  <p>"I think Tims is right," said Parrott. "Better leave the patch to darken
  naturally."</p>

  <p>To this I assented, and thereupon Mr. Tims proceeded to assemble the
  separated parts while Parrott and I looked on, and Penrose divided his
  attention between the table and Mr. Polton's operations on the lathe.</p>

  <p>"By the way, Mr. Penrose," said I, suddenly remembering our last
  conversation, "how goes the insurance scheme? Have you solved the difficulty
  of the valuer?"</p>

  <p>Penrose turned to me quickly with a look of annoyance, so that I was sorry
  I had spoken.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to report at present," he replied with unwonted
  shortness of manner; and, as if to close the subject, he stepped across to
  the lathe and manifested a sudden and not very intelligent interest in its
  mechanism. However, Mr. Polton's job was apparently completed, for, when he
  had replaced the band on the pulley, tested the centres and given the
  fly-wheel a trial spin, he proceeded to shed the apron and put on his coat,
  and was forthwith spirited away by Penrose.</p>

  <p>I had noticed that when I spoke of the insurance Mr. Parrott had seemed to
  prick up his ears (which, perhaps, explained the annoyance of the secretive
  Penrose). But he made no remark while the latter was present, though he had
  evidently heard and noted what had been said, for, when Penrose had gone, he
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Do I understand that Mr. Penrose has actually decided to insure his
  collection? I have repeatedly urged him to, but he has always agreed with me
  and then let the matter slide."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said I, "that my experience is the same as yours. I advised
  him to insure without delay, but you heard what he said."</p>

  <p>"I heard what he said," Parrott replied, "but it didn't convey much to me,
  excepting that he is still putting the business off. Which is rather foolish
  of him. His collection is of no great value, as collections go, but still, it
  represents a good deal of money, and he would suffer a substantial loss if he
  had a fire."</p>

  <p>"Or a burglary," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"There is not much risk of that," said he. "Burglars wouldn't be tempted
  by a collection of miscellaneous bric-a-brac, most of it identifiable and
  none of any considerable value. Burglars like more portable goods and things
  that are intrinsically valuable, such as precious metals and jewellery."</p>

  <p>"You have seen his collection, of course?" said I.</p>

  <p>"Yes. As a matter of fact, I supplied the greater part of it. And I gather
  that you have seen it, too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He was good enough to show me his treasures. That was how I came to
  advise him about the insurance. It seemed to me very unsafe for valuable
  property like that to be quite unprotected."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have called it very valuable property," said he. "But perhaps
  he has some things that I haven't seen. It would be like Mr. Penrose to keep
  his court-cards up his sleeve. Did he show you any really valuable
  pieces?"</p>

  <p>Now, here was the very difficulty that I had foreseen. Obviously, Parrott
  was unaware of the existence of the hoard of jewels and coins, but he
  evidently suspected Penrose of possessing something more than he had
  disclosed. It was very unpleasant, but my promise of secrecy left me no
  choice. I must either lie or prevaricate.</p>

  <p>"It is difficult for me to estimate values," said I, adopting the less
  objectionable alternative, "but some of the things that I saw must have been
  worth a good deal of money. There was a Saxon gold ornament, for instance.
  Wouldn't that be rather valuable?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly," he agreed, "but only in a modest way. I don't know what
  such a thing would fetch, say, at Christie's. But I think you said he was
  employing a valuer, and having some difficulty with him, apparently?"</p>

  <p>"No," I replied. "His difficulty is that a regular valuation would have to
  be made, which would involve an inspection of his goods and the making of an
  inventory. He seems to object to having a valuer nosing round his
  premises."</p>

  <p>"He would, naturally," said Parrott. "I have never met such an
  extraordinarily secretive man. But really, the valuer would not be necessary.
  I could draw up an estimate that would satisfy the Company&mdash;that is, if
  the property to be insured is only what I have seen. But, as I said, he may
  have some other things which he has not disclosed to me. Do you think he
  has?"</p>

  <p>Here I must needs prevaricate again; but I kept as near to the truth as I
  could.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible for me to guess what property he has," I said. "You know
  the man. I know only what he showed me."</p>

  <p>Parrott looked dissatisfied with my answer, which was, indeed, pretty
  obviously evasive, and he seemed disposed to press the matter further; but,
  at this point, Mr. Tims, having completed the assembling of the parts of the
  table, offered the completed work for my inspection and approval. I looked it
  over quickly, and, having pronounced it satisfactory, took the opportunity to
  make my escape before Parrott should have time to propound any more
  questions.</p>

  <p>As I re-entered the shop from the yard, Penrose and Polton were just
  passing out at the front door, the latter carrying the body of the clock and
  the former bearing a large parcel, which presumably contained the weights,
  the pendulum and the bracket. I went to the door and watched them receding
  down the street until they reached the corner, when Penrose, happening to
  glance back, observed me and greeted me with a flourish of his free hand.
  Then they turned the corner and disappeared from my sight; and thus, though I
  little guessed it at the time, did Mr. Penrose pass out of my ken for
  ever.</p>

  <p>For I never saw him again. A few days later, I joined the South-Eastern
  circuit, and thenceforth, for the next few months, passed most of my time in
  the county towns in which the assizes were held; and when I came back, Mr.
  Penrose had disappeared.</p>

  <p>The fact was communicated to me by Mrs. Pettigrew, who, in her kindly and
  discreet fashion, tried to minimise the abnormal features of the affair.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean, Mrs. Pettigrew," I exclaimed, "that he has gone away from
  his home and left no address or indication as to where he is to be
  found?"</p>

  <p>"So I understand," she replied, "but I don't really know any of the
  particulars."</p>

  <p>"But," said I, "it is a very extraordinary affair."</p>

  <p>"It would be," said she, "in the case of any ordinary man. But you know
  what Mr. Penrose is. It would be quite like him, if he had occasion, say, to
  go abroad, to go and keep his own counsel as to where he had gone to. I
  believe he has done it before, though not for so long a time. I understand
  that on more than one occasion he has gone out in his car and driven away
  into the country without saying anything to his servant as to his
  intentions&mdash;just gone out and returned after a few days, saying nothing
  to anybody as to where he had been."</p>

  <p>"Amazing!" said I. "He can't be quite in his right mind. But this affair
  seems rather different from the other escapades. You say he has been gone for
  a couple of months. It looks very much as if he had gone for good."</p>

  <p>"It does," she agreed; and then, after a pause, she continued: "It has
  been a great blow to Mr. Parrott, for Mr. Penrose was by far our best
  customer. He was really the mainstay of the business; and now that he has
  gone and that we have lost poor Mr. Tims, it is very doubtful if we can carry
  on."</p>

  <p>"Why, what has happened to Tims?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"He is dead, poor old thing," she replied. "He got influenza and went out
  like the snuff of a candle. He was very old and frail, you know. But he was
  invaluable to Mr. Parrott. He was such a wonderful workman."</p>

  <p>"Still," I said, "I suppose he can be replaced."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Parrott thinks not," said she, "and I am afraid he is right. It is
  very difficult to find a real cabinet-maker in these days. The few that are
  left are mostly old men, and even they don't understand old furniture as Mr.
  Tims did. But, without a skilled restorer, we can't get on at all. Mr.
  Parrott is an excellent judge, but he is no workman."</p>

  <p>In short, what the absent Penrose would have called "the psittacoid
  emporium" was in a bad way. It had never been a very prosperous concern, I
  gathered, and indeed, I had seldom seen a stranger in the shop; but with the
  aid of Penrose's numerous purchases (or "investigations," as he would have
  described them) and the prestige of Tims's skilful restorations, it had just
  managed to keep afloat.</p>

  <p>"I do hope," Mrs. Pettigrew said, rather dismally, "that we shall be able
  to struggle on. It will be an awful disaster for poor Joan and me if the
  business collapses. Of course, Mr. Parrott has not been in a position to pay
  me much of a salary, but Joan and I have the use of the rooms over the shop,
  and with her earnings as a secretary we have rubbed along quite comfortably.
  But it will be very different if I am earning nothing and we have only her
  little salary to live on, and rent to pay as well. And it will be so unfair
  to the poor girl, who ought to be considering her own future, to have to
  carry the burden of a superannuated mother."</p>

  <p>I was very sorry for Mrs. Pettigrew and I tried to present a more hopeful
  picture of the financial possibilities. I also reminded her that she had my
  address and that it was the address of a friend. And so we parted. A little
  way down the street&mdash;but on the opposite side&mdash;I met Miss Joan
  wending homewards and observed her with a new interest. With her short hair
  and short skirts, her horn-rimmed spectacles and her attache case, she was
  the typical Miss Twentieth Century. But as she swung along manfully, she
  conveyed a pleasant impression of pluck and energy and buoyant spirits, with
  mighty little of the "poor girl" in her aspect or bearing; and, raising my
  hat in response to her friendly nod, I hoped that the gathering clouds might
  pass over her harmlessly.</p>

  <p>But, when I next visited London the blow had fallen. I made my way to the
  dingy little street, only to find a gang of painters disfiguring the empty
  shop with garish adornments. The Tropic Bird had flown. The Popinjay was no
  more. The vacant window greeted me with a dull, unwelcoming stare. The
  pleasant little rendezvous had gone out, like poor Mr. Tims, with hardly a
  final flicker; and Mrs. Pettigrew and Joan and Penrose and the mysterious Mr.
  Polton seemed to have faded out of my life like the actors in a play when the
  curtain has fallen.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2-0"
     id="ch2-0"></a>BOOK II. &mdash; NARRATED BY CHRISTOPHER JERVIS, M.D.</h2>

  <h2><a name="ch2-4"
     id="ch2-4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE BURGLARY AT QUEEN SQUARE</h2>

  <p class="first">My introduction to the strange and puzzling circumstances
  connected with the disappearance of Mr. Daniel Penrose occurred in a rather
  casual, almost accidental fashion. On a certain evening, at the close of the
  day's work in the Law Courts, I had walked up with my colleague, Dr. John
  Thorndyke, to New Square, Lincoln's Inn, to restore to our old friend, Mr.
  Brodribb, some documents which it had been necessary to produce in Court.
  Finding Mr. Brodribb in his office, apparently up to his eyes in business, we
  handed the documents to him, and, when he had checked them, were about to
  depart when our friend laid down his pen, took off his spectacles and held up
  his hand to detain us.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Thorndyke," said he. "Before you go, there is a little matter
  that I should like to take your opinion on. I'll just pop on my hat and walk
  with you to the corner of the Square. It is quite a trifling affair&mdash;at
  least&mdash;well, I'll tell you about it as we go." He rose and, putting on
  the immaculate top hat which he invariably wore in defiance of modern
  fashions, stepped through into the outer office.</p>

  <p>"I shall be back in a few minutes, Jarrett," said he, addressing his
  managing clerk, and with that he led the way out.</p>

  <p>"The matter," he began, as we emerged on to the broad pavement of the
  Square, "relates to a burglary, or attempted burglary, at the house of a man
  whom I may call my client; a man named Daniel Penrose, though, actually, I am
  being consulted by his executor, a Mr. Horridge."</p>

  <p>"Penrose, then, I take it, is deceased," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"No. Penrose is alive, but he is absent from his home and no one knows
  where he is at the moment. So Horridge is assuming that his position as
  executor authorises him to take action in the absence of the testator."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't seem a very sound position," Thorndyke remarked. "But what
  action does he propose to take?"</p>

  <p>"I had better explain the circumstances," said Brodribb. "In the first
  place, the man Penrose, who has a biggish house in Queen Square, is the owner
  of a collection; a very miscellaneous collection, I understand; all sorts of
  trash from old clocks to china dogs. This stuff is kept in two large rooms on
  the ground floor, but adjoining the main rooms is a small room which contains
  nothing but a table, a chair and a large cupboard or armoire. This room is
  usually kept locked, but, by a fortunate chance, when Penrose went away he
  left the key in the door, and the butler, a man named Kickweed, finding it
  there, very properly took possession of it.</p>

  <p>"Now, the alleged burglary occurred about ten days ago. It seems that
  Kickweed, making his morning round of the premises, unlocked the door of the
  small room to go in and inspect, when, to his astonishment, he found it
  bolted on the inside. Thereupon he took a pair of library steps round to the
  side of the house where the window of the small room looks on a narrow
  uncovered passage. On climbing up the steps he found the window unfastened
  and was able to slide it up and step over into the room. There he confirmed
  the fact that the door was bolted on the inside, but that, and the unfastened
  window, were the only signs of anything out of the ordinary. The cupboard was
  perfectly intact, with no traces whatever of its having been tampered with;
  and, although there were some scratches on the table by the window, as if
  some hard objects had been put on it and moved about, there was nothing to
  show when those marks had been made."</p>

  <p>"The cupboard, I presume, was locked?" said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and with a Chubb lock."</p>

  <p>"And what was in the cupboard?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Brodribb, "that is the problem. No one knows what it contained
  or whether it contained anything. But, having regard to the facts that
  Penrose is a collector, that he always kept this room locked and that the
  cupboard was fitted with a Chubb lock, the reasonable assumption is that it
  contained something of value."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "that seems probable. But what does Mr. Horridge
  propose to do?"</p>

  <p>"He would like, with my consent&mdash;I am co-executor&mdash;to have the
  lock picked and explore the inside of the cupboard."</p>

  <p>"That plan seems to present difficulties," said Thorndyke. "To say nothing
  of the fact that a Chubb lock takes a good deal of picking, there is the
  objection that, as you don't know what was in the cupboard, you couldn't
  judge whether anything had been taken. Suppose you find it empty; you don't
  know that it was not empty previously. Suppose you find valuable property in
  it; you still don't know that nothing has been taken, and, by having forced
  the lock, you assume a slightly uncomfortable responsibility for the safety
  of the contents. Why not just seal the cupboard and let Penrose do the
  investigating when he returns?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Brodribb, with a rather dissatisfied air, as he halted at the
  corner of the Square and looked up at the clock above the library. "But
  suppose he doesn't return?" He paused for a few moments and then burst out:
  "The fact is, Thorndyke, that this burglary is only an incident in a most
  complicated and puzzling affair. There is no time to go into it now, but I
  should very much like, some time when you have an hour or so to spare, to put
  the whole case before you and hear what you have to suggest."</p>

  <p>"I shall have an hour or so to spare&mdash;for you&mdash;this evening,"
  said Thorndyke, "if that will suit you."</p>

  <p>Brodribb brightened visibly. "It will suit me admirably," said he. "I will
  get a bit of dinner and then I will trot along to King's Bench Walk."</p>

  <p>"You needn't do that," said Thorndyke. "Jervis and I are dining at our
  chambers this evening. Come along and join us. Then we shall be able to get
  into our conversational stride with the aid of food and a glass of wine."</p>

  <p>Brodribb accepted gleefully, and, when we had settled the time for him to
  arrive, he turned away towards his office. But suddenly he stopped, searching
  frantically in a bulging pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"Here," said he, holding out a small piece of paper, "is something to
  occupy your mighty brains until we meet at dinner, when I will ask you to let
  me have it back."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke took the paper from him, he broke out into a broad smile,
  and, turning away once more, hurried off to relieve the waiting Jarrett. My
  colleague looked at the paper, considered for a few moments, turned it over
  to glance at the back, held it up to the light and passed it to me without
  comment. It was a small scrap of paper&mdash;about three inches
  square&mdash;apparently cut off a sheet with a paper-knife, and it bore three
  words untidily scribbled on it with a hard pencil: "Lobster (Hortus
  petasafus)."</p>

  <p>"Well," I exclaimed, gazing at the paper with mild astonishment, "I
  suppose this has some meaning, but I'm hanged if I can make any sense of it.
  Can you?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head, and, taking the little document from me, put it away
  carefully in his wallet.</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose it is some sort of clue?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose anything," he replied. "Let us wait and hear what
  Brodribb has to say about it. His expression suggested what school-boys call
  a leg-pull. But I suspect that he has something quite interesting to tell us
  about the absent Penrose."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's suspicion turned out to be correct, for, when Mr. Brodribb
  arrived at our chambers, dressed immaculately and accompanied by a clerk
  carrying a brown-paper parcel, he gave us to understand that he had some
  rather surprising facts to communicate.</p>

  <p>"But," he added, "I haven't come here just to eat your dinner and waste
  your time with idle talk. I want you to regard this as a professional
  consultation."</p>

  <p>"We will consider that question later," said Thorndyke. "Our immediate
  purpose is to dine, but, meanwhile, I will return your rather cryptic
  document. I have kept a copy of it in case it may have a bearing on anything,
  and Jervis has made a minute study of its ostensible meaning."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you say 'ostensible,'" chuckled Brodribb, as he stowed the
  document away in his pocket-book. "And what conclusions has the learned
  Jervis arrived at?"</p>

  <p>"My conclusions," said I, "are not very illuminating. Broadly speaking,
  the inscription is damned nonsense."</p>

  <p>"I am with you there," said Brodribb.</p>

  <p>"Then, as to the ostensible meaning, I take it that the word 'Lobster'
  means&mdash;well, it means lobster&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll take my bible oath it doesn't," Brodribb interposed.</p>

  <p>"And as to the Latin words, hortus, of course, is a garden and petasatus
  according to the erudite Dr. William Smith, means 'having on a travelling
  cap' or, alternatively, in more general terms, 'dressed in readiness for a
  journey.' Which doesn't make any sort of sense. You can't imagine a garden
  wearing a travelling-cap or being dressed in readiness for a journey."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it was the lobster that wore the cap," Thorndyke suggested,
  regardless of syntax. "But what is the significance of this document? I
  presume that it has some connection with the burglary."</p>

  <p>"Yes, it has," Brodribb replied; "and if we could only find out what the
  devil it means, it might be quite an important clue. The paper was found by
  Kickweed, when he was examining the small room, under the table by the
  window. He thinks that it came from inside the cupboard; and if he is right,
  it furnishes evidence that the cupboard had been opened. And if we could only
  make any sense of the damned thing, it might give us a hint as to what had
  been taken."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "but this is all very hypothetical. There is no
  evidence as to when the paper was dropped. It is quite possible that it may
  have been dropped by Penrose, himself. But as to this cryptic inscription. As
  Jervis says, it probably has some meaning. Does it convey anything at all to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"As to meaning, most emphatically NO. But," Brodribb continued, grasping
  his wine-glass fiercely, "it impresses on me what I have always thought; that
  Daniel Penrose is an exasperating ass!"</p>

  <p>At this outburst, Polton (our laboratory assistant and general factotum),
  who had just removed the covers and was in the act of re-filling Brodribb's
  glass, looked at the speaker with an expression of surprised interest. He
  even seemed disposed to linger; but as there was no excuse for his doing so,
  he retired slowly as if reluctant to go.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Thorndyke suggested when Polton had withdrawn, "that statement
  might be amplified and its bearings explained. You seem to imply that the
  cryptic inscription was written by Penrose."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly it was," Brodribb replied. "It is typical of the man. Let me
  explain to you what sort of fellow Penrose is; and I want you to bear his
  peculiarities in mind when I come to tell you my story, because they probably
  have an important bearing on it. Now, Penrose has two outstanding oddities of
  character. In the first place, he is an inveterate joker. He seems incapable
  of speaking seriously; and the form that his facetiousness takes is in
  calling everything by its wrong name. The tendency seems to have grown on him
  until it has become a fixed habit and now his conversation is a sort of
  everlasting cross-word puzzle. You have to cudgel your brains when he is
  speaking, to guess what he really means, and the only certainty that you have
  is that whatever he says, you know that he means something else."</p>

  <p>"It sounds a bit confusing," said I. "But I suppose there is some method
  in his madness. Could you give us an illustrative example?"</p>

  <p>"His method," replied Brodribb, "consists in using allusive phrases,
  equivalents in sound or sense, or distortions or perversions of words. He
  would not invest his money: he would investigate it. He would not call our
  friend John Thorndyke; he would probably describe him as Giovanni
  Brambleditch."</p>

  <p>"I must bear that name in mind," said I, "for use on suitable occasions.
  But I think I grasp the principle. It is a sort of mixture of puns and
  metaphors."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Brodribb, "that is roughly what it amounts to. And now as to
  his other eccentricity. Penrose is an extraordinarily secret man. I use the
  word 'extraordinarily' advisedly. We are all, as lawyers, in the habit of
  keeping our own counsel. But we don't make secrets of our common and simple
  doings. If Thorndyke wants to go to the Law Courts, he doesn't sneak out on
  tip-toe when there is nobody about and leave no information as to where he
  has gone. But that is what Penrose would do. His habit of secrecy is as
  inveterate as his habit of facetiousness. He has been known to set forth from
  his house in his car without giving any notice to his butler or anybody else,
  to drive away into the country and stay away for several days&mdash;probably
  rooting about for bargains for his collection&mdash;and come back without a
  word of explanation as to where he had been. I assure you that when I had to
  draft his will I had the greatest difficulty in extracting from him any
  intelligible particulars of the property that was to be disposed of."</p>

  <p>"It is rather remarkable," said Thorndyke, "that he should have made a
  will at all."</p>

  <p>"It is," agreed Brodribb. "Men of that type usually die intestate. And
  thereby hangs another part of the tale that I have to tell. But I repeat that
  it is most necessary to bear these oddities of character in mind in
  connection with what has happened. And now, I will drop Penrose for the
  present and let you finish your dinners in peace."</p>

  <p>I think that Brodribb's resolution to change the subject occasioned some
  disappointment to Polton; for that cunning artificer developed an
  unprecedented degree of attentiveness, which caused him to make frequent
  incursions into the room for the ostensible purpose of filling wine-glasses
  and performing other unnecessary services. His obvious interest in our rather
  trivial conversation caused me some slight surprise at the time. But later
  events explained his curiosity.</p>

  <p>When we had finished dinner, and before removing the debris, he drew the
  three easy chairs up to the fire, placed a small table by that which was
  assigned to Brodribb and deposited on it the invariable decanter of port and
  three wine-glasses. Then he proceeded to clear the table by small instalments
  and by methods strikingly at variance with his usual swift economy of time
  and labour. But his procrastination was all in vain; for not until the table
  was cleared to the last vestige and Polton had made his final and reluctant
  disappearance, did Brodribb make the slightest allusion to the subject of our
  consultation.</p>

  <p>Then, when the door had closed, the glasses had been filled and Thorndyke
  and I had produced our pipes, he extracted a slip of paper from his
  pocket-book and laid it on the table by his side, fortified himself with a
  sip of wine and opened the proceedings.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-5"
     id="ch2-5"></a>V. &mdash; MR. BRODRIBB PROPOUNDS A PROBLEM</h2>

  <p class="first">"The circumstances connected with Penrose's disappearance,"
  Mr. Brodribb began, "are so complicated that I hardly know in what order I
  should present them."</p>

  <p>"Probably," suggested Thorndyke, "the simplest plan would be to deal with
  the events in their chronological sequence."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Brodribb agreed, "that would probably be the best way. I can refer
  back to previous occurrences if necessary. Then we will begin with the
  seventeenth of last October, roughly three months ago. On that day, in the
  early afternoon, he started out from home in his car and, contrary to his
  usual practice, he told Kickweed that he did not expect to be back until
  rather late. He directed that no one should sit up for him, but that a cold
  supper should be left in the dining-room. As to where he was going or on what
  business, he naturally gave no hint, but we are justified in assuming that he
  started forth with the intention of returning that night. But he did not
  return; and, so far as we know, he was never seen again by anybody who was
  acquainted with him."</p>

  <p>"Your description," said Thorndyke, "seems to suggest that he is a
  bachelor."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Brodribb, "he is a bachelor, and, with the exception of an
  aged father, to whom I shall refer presently, he seems to have no very near
  relations. Horridge, his executor, is a somewhat distant cousin and a good
  deal younger man. Well, then, to repeat; on the day that I have mentioned,
  having given this very vague information to his butler, he went off to his
  garage, got his car out, closed up the garage and departed. Kickweed saw him
  drive away past the house; and that was the last that was seen of him by any
  person who knew him.</p>

  <p>"His next appearance was in very remarkable circumstances. At midnight on
  that same day, or in the early hours of the next, a gentleman, a resident of
  Gravesend, who was returning home from Chatham in his car, saw a man lying
  face downwards on a heap of gravel by the roadside. The gentleman pulled up
  and got out to see what had happened; and as the man seemed to be either dead
  or unconscious, and there was nobody about excepting a rather squiffy
  labourer, he carefully lifted the man, with the labourer's assistance, put
  him into his car and conveyed him to the hospital at Gravesend, which was
  about a mile and a half from the place where he picked him up. At the
  hospital it was found that the man was alive though insensible, and on this
  the gentleman, a Mr. Barnaby, went away, leaving the hospital authorities to
  give information to the police.</p>

  <p>"The injured man appeared to be suffering from concussion. He had
  evidently fallen on the gravel with great violence, for his face was a mass
  of bruises and both his eyes were completely closed by the swelling due to
  the contusions. There was a deep, ragged wound across his right eyebrow in
  which the house surgeon had to put a couple of stitches; and there were
  various other bruises about his person, suggesting that he had been knocked
  down by some passing vehicle, but there appeared to be no broken bones or
  other severe injuries. The visiting surgeon, however, seems to have suspected
  the existence of a fracture of the base of the skull, and, on this account,
  directed that the patient should be kept very quiet and not questioned or
  disturbed in any way.</p>

  <p>"The next day he still appeared to be unconscious, or nearly so, though he
  took the small amount of nourishment that was offered. But he answered no
  questions, and, by reason of the suspected fracture, no particular attempts
  were made to rouse him. And so the day passed. On the following day, the
  nineteenth, he remained in much the same condition; speechless and somnolent,
  lying nearly motionless, taking no notice of anything that was occurring
  around him and giving no answers to questions.</p>

  <p>"But about eight o'clock at night he roused quite suddenly and very
  completely, for he seemed at once to be in full possession of his senses. But
  what is more, he proceeded to get out of bed, and demanded his clothes,
  declaring that he was quite well and intended to leave the hospital and go
  about his business. As you may suppose, there was a mighty hubbub.</p>

  <p>"The house surgeon absolutely forbade the patient to leave the hospital
  and at first refused to let him have his clothes. But the man persisted that
  he was going, clothes or no clothes. Well, of course, they had no power to
  detain him, so the end of it was that they produced his clothes, and when he
  had dressed himself they gave him a light meal and took the particulars of
  his name and address and what little he could tell them of the circumstances
  of his accident. But of this he knew practically nothing. All he could tell
  them was that some vehicle had come on him from behind and knocked him down,
  and he remembered no more.</p>

  <p>"When he had finished his meal and made his statement, such as it was, he
  asked for his overcoat. But there was no overcoat with his clothes, though
  the ward sister remembered that he was wearing one when he was brought in.
  Apparently, a patient who had been discharged earlier in the evening must
  have taken it by mistake, for there was a spare overcoat of the same
  kind&mdash;the ordinary raincoat, such as you may see by the dozen in any
  street; and it was suggested that he should take this in exchange for his
  own. But he would not agree to this, and eventually, as it was a mild night,
  he was allowed to go as he was.</p>

  <p>"Now, he had not been gone more than an hour when the man who had taken
  the wrong coat brought it back. He had discovered his mistake by finding in
  the pocket a motorist's driving licence. But the odd thing was that the name
  and address on the licence did not agree with those that the departed patient
  had given. And yet there seemed to be no doubt that it was the missing coat,
  for the night nurse remembered the daubs of mud that she had noticed on it
  when she had undressed the patient. Moreover, she now recalled that the
  collar which she had taken off him had borne the initials 'D.P.,' in Roman
  capitals, apparently written with a marking-ink pencil.</p>

  <p>"But there was an evident discrepancy. The patient had given the name of
  Joseph Blewitt, with an address somewhere in Camden Town; but the name on the
  licence was Daniel Penrose and the address was his address in Queen
  Square.</p>

  <p>"It was certainly a facer. The coat had to be returned to its owner. But
  who was its owner? The secretary decided that it was not his business to
  solve that problem; and, moreover, as there seemed to be something a trifle
  queer about the affair, he thought it best to communicate with the police.
  But as it was rather late and there seemed to be no urgency in the matter, he
  put it off until the following morning; and when the morning came, the police
  saved him the trouble by calling to make inquiries. And then something still
  more queer came to light.</p>

  <p>"That morning, early, a patrol had discovered an abandoned car backed into
  the bushes at the bottom of an unfrequented lane leading down to the marshes
  a mile or so outside Gravesend. On making inquiries, he learned that it had
  been there all the previous day, for it had been seen by some boys who had
  gone down to the marshes on their probably unlawful occasions. They had taken
  no special notice of it, assuming that the owner had gone off on some
  business into the village in the irresponsible way that motorists have of
  leaving their cars unattended. But the boys could not say when it had
  arrived, as they had not been to the marshes on the day before. However, when
  the patrol pushed his inquiries in the village, he heard of the accident and
  of the man who had been picked up on the road not very far away. Thereupon,
  he took possession of the car and brought it into the town, lodging it, for
  the time being, in the garage belonging to the police station. And then he
  came on to the hospital to interview the injured man. But the bird had flown
  and only the coat with the driving licence remained.</p>

  <p>"And then, once more, the plot thickened. For the name on the insurance
  certificate which was found in the car was the same as that on the licence;
  and if&mdash;as seemed nearly certain&mdash;the coat belonged to the departed
  patient, then that patient had given a false name and address. And this
  turned out to be the fact. No such person as Joseph Blewitt was known at the
  Camden Town address; and on inquiring at Daniel Penrose's house, it was
  ascertained that the said Daniel had left home in his car in the early
  afternoon of the day on which the injured man had been brought into the
  hospital and had not since been seen or heard of.</p>

  <p>"As to what had become of that injured man, all that they could discover
  was that he&mdash;or, at least, a man with two black eyes and generally
  answering to the description&mdash;had taken a first-class ticket to London
  shortly after the time at which the patient had left the hospital, and that a
  man, apparently the same, had got out at New Cross. But they could get no
  farther. From the time when he passed the barrier at New Cross all trace of
  him was lost."</p>

  <p>"Did the police make any efforts to follow him up?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"At the moment, I don't think they did. Why should they? So far as they
  then knew, the man had committed no offence. He was no business of theirs. If
  he chose to vamoose, he was quite entitled to."</p>

  <p>"I need not ask if you know of any reason that he may have had for
  disappearing?"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Brodribb, "now we come to the inwardness of the affair. I have
  told the story in the actual order of events, and, at the time when he bolted
  from the hospital, there seemed no reason for his sneaking off and hiding
  himself. But, a day or two later, some other facts transpired which threw an
  entirely new light on his behaviour.</p>

  <p>"It appeared that early in the morning of the eighteenth, the day after
  that on which he left home&mdash;and, incidentally, was picked up on the
  road&mdash;the dead body of an old woman was found in a dry ditch at the side
  of a by-road leading to the main road from Ashford to Maidstone. From the
  condition of the body as to rigor mortis and temperature, the police surgeon
  inferred that she had been dead about six hours; which, as the body was
  discovered at about five o'clock in the morning, roughly fixes the time of
  her death at eleven o'clock on the previous night. Of the cause of death
  there seemed to be no doubt. She had been knocked down by a motor, the driver
  of which had either been unaware of what had happened or had cleared off to
  avoid trouble. The latter seemed the more probable, for, not only must the
  force of the impact have been terrific to fling the poor old creature right
  across the grass verge into the ditch, but the tracks of a car, which were
  plainly visible in the lane, showed it to have been zigzagging wildly and to
  have actually struck the grass verge at the point where the accident must
  have occurred.</p>

  <p>"At first, it looked as if the motorist had got away without leaving a
  recognisable trace. But when the police came to make inquiries, they picked
  up some important information from the attendant at a filling station at
  Maidstone. He recalled that, a little after eleven o'clock on the night of
  the old woman's death, a car had come to his establishment for a refill of
  petrol. It was apparently travelling from the direction of Ashford; and there
  were certain circumstances connected with the car and the driver which had
  attracted his attention. He had noticed, for instance, that the near-side
  mudguard was badly bent, and there was earth on the wheels, as if the car had
  been run over a ploughed field. He had also observed that the
  driver&mdash;who was alone in the car&mdash;looked rather pale and shaken,
  and seemed to be excited or agitated. Moreover, he smelt strongly of drink;
  and the man was of opinion that the liquor was not whisky, but smelt more
  like 'sherry wine.' These facts, taken together, made him suspect that the
  motorist had been in trouble and he very wisely made a note of the number of
  the car and had a good look at the driver. His description of the man is not
  very illuminating, excepting that he noticed the muddy state of the raincoat,
  which the nurse had mentioned. But the number of the car gave all the
  necessary information. It was that of Daniel Penrose's car; and, sure enough,
  in confirmation of the identity, was the fact that the left mud-guard of
  Penrose's car was badly bent and there was a quantity of earth on the wheels.
  And there is a bit of further evidence, for it appears that Penrose was
  stopped by a police patrol on the top of Bluebell Hill, on the
  Maidstone-Rochester Road, and asked to show his licence; which explains how
  the licence came to be in his raincoat pocket. When you consider the devil of
  a hurry that he was in, you can understand that he would just shove it into
  the nearest pocket.</p>

  <p>"Well, the final phase of the affair&mdash;so far&mdash;was the inquest on
  the old woman. Naturally, when they had heard the evidence of the police and
  the man from the petrol-filling station, the jury found a verdict of
  manslaughter against some person unknown."</p>

  <p>"Unknown!" I repeated. "Then they did not mention Penrose by name?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Brodribb. "The coroner knew his business better than many
  coroners do. He directed the jury to confine their finding to the facts that
  had been definitely proved and leave the identification of the offender to
  the police. But I need not say that the police are keeping a bright look-out
  for Daniel Penrose.</p>

  <p>"So there, you see, we have an explanation of the initial disappearance.
  Perhaps, not a very reasonable one; but then Penrose is not a very reasonable
  man. But that explanation does not quite clear up the mystery. He disappeared
  about three months ago and since then has made no sign. Now, we can
  understand his bolting off in a panic, but it is less easy to understand his
  remaining in hiding. On reflection he must have seen that he was really in no
  great danger, even if he did actually knock the poor old woman down, which is
  by no means certainly the case. There were no witnesses of the accident. If
  he chose to deny that he was in any way concerned in it, it would be
  impossible to prove that he was. He might even have denied that he was ever
  on that particular road at all."</p>

  <p>"You mentioned," said Thorndyke, "that there were distinct tracks of motor
  tyres. Probably they would be identifiable."</p>

  <p>"That would not be conclusive," Brodribb replied. "It would only prove
  that the tyres were of the same make. But, even if he admitted that he had
  caused the old woman's death, still, in the absence of witnesses, he could
  give any account that he pleased of the disaster. Carelessness on the part of
  the pedestrian is usually quite satisfactory to a coroner or his jury."</p>

  <p>"I don't think the matter is as simple as that," Thorndyke objected. "I
  agree with you that there has been a most amazing indifference to the value
  of human life since the coming of the motor car. But this was an
  exceptionally bad case. The man had been drinking; he must have known that he
  had knocked the woman down, but yet he drove on callously, leaving her to die
  uncared for, and did not even report the accident. Whatever the coroner's
  verdict might have been, the police would certainly have prosecuted, and the
  man would almost inevitably have been committed for trial. But at the assizes
  he would have had to deal with a judge; and judges, as a rule&mdash;to which
  there are, I admit, one or two remarkable exceptions&mdash;take a reasonable
  and legal view of the killing of a human being."</p>

  <p>"Well, even so," Brodribb rejoined, "what does it amount to? Supposing he
  had been convicted of manslaughter? It might have been a matter of six
  months' hard labour, or even twelve. It could hardly have been more. Killing
  with a motor car is accepted as something different from any other kind of
  killing."</p>

  <p>"But," said I, "he would not be particularly keen on twelve months'
  imprisonment with hard labour."</p>

  <p>"No," Brodribb agreed, "but what is the alternative? To say nothing of the
  fact that he is pretty certain to be caught, sooner or later, what is his
  present condition? He&mdash;a well-to-do man, accustomed to every luxury, is
  a wanderer and a fugitive, hiding in obscure places by day and sneaking out
  in terror by night. It must be a dreadful existence; and how the devil he is
  living and what he is living on, is beyond my powers to imagine, seeing that,
  when he went off, he had, presumably, nothing more about him than the few
  pounds that he would ordinarily carry in his pockets."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Thorndyke said, reflectively, "it has not occurred to you to
  connect that fact with the burglary?"</p>

  <p>Brodribb looked at him in evident surprise.</p>

  <p>"I don't think," said he, "that I quite understand what you mean. What
  connection could there be?"</p>

  <p>"'I am only throwing out the suggestion," replied Thorndyke, "as a bare
  possibility. But the house seems undoubtedly to have been entered, and
  entered by a person who appears to have been acquainted with it. The entry
  was made into the small room; and that room was clearly the objective, as is
  proved by the fact that the door was bolted on the inside. Then the person
  who entered apparently knew what was in that room. But, so far as we know,
  the contents of that room were known only to Penrose. If the cupboard was
  opened, it was opened with a key; for it is practically impossible to pick a
  Chubb lock, and a burglar would not have tried. He would have used his jemmy
  and forced the door."</p>

  <p>"By Jove, Thorndyke!" Brodribb exclaimed, slapping the table, at the risk
  of spilling the wine, "you have solved the mystery! It never occurred to me
  that the burglar might be Penrose, himself. But your suggestion fits the case
  to a T. Here is poor old Penrose, penniless and perhaps starving. He knows
  that in that cupboard is portable property of very substantial value. He has
  the key of the cupboard in his pocket and he knows that he can get into the
  room easily by just slipping back the catch of the window with a knife. Of
  course it was Penrose. I was a damned blockhead not to have thought of it
  before. But you see, Thorndyke, I haven't got your criminal mind."</p>

  <p>But Thorndyke, having made the suggestion, proceeded to sprinkle a little
  cold water on Brodribb's enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a certainty," said he, "and we mustn't treat it as one. It is a
  reasonable and probable hypothesis, but we may think of others when we
  consider the matter further. However, the immediate question is what you want
  me to do."</p>

  <p>"You can guess that," chuckled Brodribb, as I refilled his glass. "What do
  I always want you to do when I come here taking up your valuable time and
  drinking your excellent port? I want you to perform miracles and do
  impossibilities. It seems a pretty large order, I admit, even for you, seeing
  that the police are unable to locate Penrose, but I am going to ask you to
  exercise your remarkable power of resolving insoluble riddles and just tell
  us where he is."</p>

  <p>"'But why trouble to hunt him up?" Thorndyke objected. "He probably knows
  his own business best."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure that he does," Brodribb retorted. "But, in any case, it
  is not his business that is specially agitating me. There are some other
  people whose interests are affected and one of them is keeping me very
  effectively stirred up. However, I suppose I mustn't inflict on you details
  of the purely civil aspects of the case."</p>

  <p>It was easy to gather from the apologetic tone of the concluding sentence
  and the wistful glance that he cast at Thorndyke, that he wanted very much to
  inflict those details, and I was not surprised when my colleague replied:</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be an infliction, Brodribb. On the contrary, it would be both
  interesting and helpful to have a complete picture of the case."</p>

  <p>"I suspect," said Brodribb, "that you are only being beastly polite, but I
  will take you at your word. After all, the civil aspects are part of the
  problem and they may be more relevant than I realise. So here goes.</p>

  <p>"I spoke just now of Daniel Penrose's aged father and I mentioned that
  there were no other near relations. Now, Penrose Senior, Oliver by name, is a
  very remarkable old gentleman. He is over ninety years of age, but
  surprisingly well preserved. Up to a week or two ago, he was, mentally and
  physically, the equal of an ordinary man of sixty. That was his condition at
  the time of Daniel's disappearance; lively and active, apparently going
  strong for his hundredth birthday.</p>

  <p>"But, within the last fortnight, the old man has been taken ill&mdash;a
  slight touch of influenza. It appeared at first, that seemed to offer no
  particular cause for anxiety. But you know what these hale and robust
  nonagenarians are. They dodder along peacefully, looking as if they were
  going to live for ever, until, one fine day, something gives them a shake up
  and puts them out of their stride; and then they just quietly fade away.
  Well, that is what is happening to old Penrose. He doesn't seem particularly
  ill. But he shows no sign of recovering. Suddenly, the weight of his years
  seems to have descended on him and he is gradually fading out. It is
  practically certain that he will die within the next few weeks; and, when he
  does die, some very curious complications are going to arise.</p>

  <p>"Oliver Penrose is what we humble professional people would call a rather
  rich man. Nothing on the commercial scale of wealth. Nothing of the
  millionaire order. But there will be an estate, mostly personal, of over a
  hundred and fifty thousand pounds. And, so far as we know, that estate is not
  disposed of by will. The old man was rather obstinate about it, though there
  was some reason in his contention that it was a waste of trouble to make a
  will leaving the estate to the next of kin, who would inherit without a will.
  However, that question is of no importance, for, in any case, Penrose Junior
  would come into the property. If there is a will, he will be the principal
  beneficiary, and if there is no will, he is the next of kin, and, being the
  only child, will take the bulk of the estate.</p>

  <p>"And now you see the difficulty. Daniel has made a will leaving a
  considerable proportion of his property to his cousin, Francis Horridge, who
  is also one of the executors and the residuary legatee. Daniel is not as rich
  as his father, but they are a well-to-do family and he has some fifty
  thousand pounds of his own. So Horridge will not do so badly if he should
  survive Daniel, which he is likely to do, as he is over twenty years younger.
  But he wants to do better. On the old man's death, the bulk of his property
  will, as I said, come to Daniel; and, as Daniel's will at present stands, it
  will fall into the residue of the estate and thus, eventually, come to
  Horridge.</p>

  <p>"But there is a snag. Daniel has disappeared, but the old man is still
  alive. Now, suppose that Daniel elects to disappear for good. The thing is
  possible. He may have some resources that are unknown to us. It would be like
  him to have a secret banking account in a false name; and he may be in such a
  funk of criminal prosecution that he may never dare to come to the surface
  again. Well, suppose he remains in hiding. Suppose he has gone abroad or into
  some entirely new surroundings and has the means to go on living there; just
  see what a hideous mess will be created. In the first place, there will be an
  indefinite delay in distributing the old man's estate. Daniel is the next of
  kin (or else the principal beneficiary, if there should be a will). But his
  share cannot be allotted until it is proved that he is alive, and it cannot
  be otherwise disposed of until he is either proved or presumed to be dead.
  And, similarly, his own will cannot be administered so long as he is
  presumably alive."</p>

  <p>"If he remains absent long enough," Thorndyke remarked, "the interested
  parties will probably apply for permission to presume his death."</p>

  <p>"Well," retorted Brodribb, "they certainly wouldn't get it at present, or
  for a long time to come. If Daniel remains in hiding, the whole business may
  be hung up for years. But, even if they do, later, succeed in getting his
  death presumed, another and still worse complication will have to be dealt
  with. For, of course, the question of survivorship will be raised. Oliver's
  next of kin will naturally contend that Daniel died before the old man and
  that he could, therefore, not have inherited the old man's property; in which
  case, Horridge stands to lose the best part of a hundred and fifty thousand
  pounds. And that, I may say, is where I come in. Horridge is in a most
  frightful twitter for fear Daniel should slip away for good and perhaps die
  somewhere under a false name. He wants to find Daniel, or at least ascertain
  that he is alive; and he is prepared to spend untold gold on the search. He
  has tried to ginger up the police and induce them to set up a hue and cry,
  regardless of poor old Daniel's feelings. But the police are not
  enthusiastic, as they have no conclusive evidence against him, even if they
  were able to locate him. So he has fallen back on me, and I have fallen back
  on you. And now the question is, are you prepared to take up the case?"</p>

  <p>I had expected that Thorndyke would return a prompt refusal, for there
  seemed absolutely nothing to go on. To my surprise, he replied with a
  qualified acceptance, though he was careful to point out the
  difficulties.</p>

  <p>"It is not very clear to me," said he, "that I can give you much help. You
  must see for yourself that this is really a police case. For the tracing of a
  missing man, the police have all the facilities as well as the necessary
  knowledge and experience. I have no facilities at all. Any inquiries that I
  may wish to make I must make through them."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see that," said Brodribb, "and, of course, I am not really asking
  you to perform miracles. I don't expect you to go outside and put your nose
  down on the pavement and forthwith make a bee-line for Daniel's hiding-place.
  But it occurs to me that you may be able to approach the matter from a
  different direction and by different methods from those of the police."</p>

  <p>"That is possible," Thorndyke admitted, "but even a medico-legal
  investigator cannot get on without evidence of some kind, and there seems to
  be practically nothing to lay hold of. Do you know where the car is?"</p>

  <p>"In Daniel's garage. It was taken there and locked up as soon as the
  police had made their examination of it."</p>

  <p>"Do you know whether anything was found in it?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard of nothing excepting a large empty flask which had,
  apparently, once contained brown sherry."</p>

  <p>"Do you know whether the car has been cleaned since it was returned?"</p>

  <p>"I am pretty sure that it has not. Penrose was his own chauffeur and did
  all the cleaning himself."</p>

  <p>"Then you spoke of a raincoat. What has become of that?"</p>

  <p>"It is in the parcel that I brought with me and which I put on the table
  in the lobby. It was delivered at Daniel's house by the police when they had
  looked it over, and Kickweed handed it to Horridge, who at once locked it up,
  and later, at my request, transferred it to me. I knew you would want to see
  it."</p>

  <p>"Was anything found in the pockets?"</p>

  <p>"There was the driving licence, as I told you. Beyond that there was
  nothing but the stump of a lead pencil, a wooden cigarette-holder and what
  looked like a fragment of a broken flower-pot. And I may say that those
  things are still in the pockets. So far as I know, the coat is in exactly the
  condition in which it was found."</p>

  <p>"We will have a look at it presently," said Thorndyke, "though it doesn't
  seem likely that we shall extract much information from it."</p>

  <p>"It certainly does not," I agreed, heartily, "and the little information
  it may yield can hardly have much bearing on what we want to know. It won't
  tell us what Penrose's intentions may have been, or where he is now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't say that!" exclaimed Brodribb. "I had hoped that Thorndyke
  would practise some of his wizardry on that coat and make it tell us all that
  we want to know about Daniel. And I hope so still, notwithstanding your
  pessimism. At any rate," he added, glancing at my colleague, "you are going
  to give us a run for our money? You agree to that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke replied, "just as a forlorn hope. It is nothing more, and
  it is unlikely that I shall have more success than the police. Still, I will
  sort out the facts, such as they are, and see if they offer us any kind of
  opening for an investigation. I suppose I can see the car?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, you can. I will tell Kickweed to let you have the key of the
  garage and to give you any help that you may ask for. Is there anything that
  you will want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"I think," replied Thorndyke, "that, as Penrose is quite unknown to me, I
  had better have a description of his person, and it should be as minute and
  exhaustive as possible; and if a photograph of him is available, I should
  like to have that, too."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Brodribb, "I will get a description of Daniel from
  Horridge and Kickweed, separately, and write out another from my own
  observations. I will let you have the three, so that you can compare them,
  and I will try to get you a photograph. And that," he concluded, emptying his
  glass with relish, and rising, "is all, for the present; and I may say that,
  despite Jervis's pessimism, you have taken a load of anxiety off my
  shoulders. Experience has taught me that when John Thorndyke starts an
  investigation, the problem is as good as solved."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-6"
     id="ch2-6"></a>VI. &mdash; THORNDKYE EXAMINES THE RELICS</h2>

  <p class="first">As we returned from the landing, to which we had escorted
  Mr. Brodribb, I took up the parcel from the lobby table and conveyed it to
  the sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"Well, Thorndyke," I remarked, as I deposited it on the table under the
  electric light, "you seem to have let yourself in for a proper wild-goose
  chase."</p>

  <p>He paused in the act of digging out his pipe to regard me with an
  approving smile.</p>

  <p>"That is rather happily expressed, Jervis," said he, "having regard to the
  personal peculiarities of our quarry. But we are not actually committed to
  chasing him."</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine why you undertook the case," I continued. "There is
  absolutely nothing to go on."</p>

  <p>"That is how it strikes me," he agreed placidly, blowing through the pipe
  preparatory to refilling. "But we couldn't refuse Brodribb."</p>

  <p>"The few facts that we have," I went on doggedly, "are all totally
  irrelevant. Our information stops short exactly at the point where the
  problem begins. Take this coat, for instance. Here is a fool&mdash;and a
  frightened, artful, secretive fool at that&mdash;who does a bolt and leaves
  his coat behind; and we are offered that coat as a guide to the particular
  bolt-hole that he has gone down. The thing is ridiculous. If it had been a
  question of where he had come from, the coat might have told us something.
  But obviously it can bear no traces of the place that he intended to go
  to."</p>

  <p>"That is perfectly true," Thorndyke admitted, "but it might be worth while
  to find out whence he had come, if that were possible."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why," I objected, adding hurriedly, to anticipate the
  inevitable reply: "Of course you will say that the significance of a fact
  cannot be judged until the fact is known; but still, I really cannot see any
  possible connection between the place whence he came and the place whither he
  went, especially as the circumstances had changed in the interval."</p>

  <p>"Nor can I," said Thorndyke. "But yet it is possible that there may be
  some connection. It is evident that Penrose started out with a definite
  objective. He was going to a particular place with some defined purpose; and
  it seems to me at least conceivable that if we could discover whither he went
  and on what business, that knowledge might be helpful. Of course, it probably
  would not; but seeing that we know nothing of the habits and mode of life of
  this curious, eccentric and secretive man, our only course is to pick up any
  stray facts concerning him that may come within our reach."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, without much conviction, "and I take it that what is in
  your mind is that when he bolted he probably made for some place that was
  known to him and where he believed that he could hide in safety."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Thorndyke agreed. "If we could discover some of his haunts, we
  might have a clue to a possible hiding-place."</p>

  <p>"It may be so," I rejoined, "and if that is your view, I suppose you will
  begin by seeing what you can glean from this coat"; and with this I proceeded
  to untie the string and open the parcel.</p>

  <p>The coat, when I lifted it out and unrolled it, was seen to be amazingly
  dirty. It was not merely splashed with mud. On the sleeves and around the
  bottom of the skirt were great daubs of thick dirt mingled with a number of
  whitish marks such as might have been produced by contact with wet chalk.</p>

  <p>"It is extraordinary," said I, holding the coat up for Thorndyke's
  inspection. "The fellow seems to have been positively wallowing in the
  mire."</p>

  <p>"Not exactly in the mire," said Thorndyke, looking closely at the great
  daubs. "This is not road dirt. It is earth; and the earth seems to have been
  mixed with particles of chalk. Perhaps we had better empty the pockets before
  we proceed with the examination of the coat."</p>

  <p>I thrust my hand into the two pockets and drew out from one the driving
  licence, crumpled, smeared, and marked with the prints of dirty fingers, and
  from the other a stump of lead pencil, a cigarette-holder and what looked
  like a fragment of a broken tile. But it was so encrusted with earth that it
  was difficult to see exactly what it was.</p>

  <p>"Brodribb's description," said I, as I handed it to Thorndyke, "doesn't
  seem to fit. This is certainly not a fragment of a flower-pot. It is too dark
  in colour. It looks to me more like part of a tile."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke took it from me and examined it closely in the bright light of
  the electric lamp.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it is a tile, Jervis," said he, "but we shall see better
  when we get it clean. The interesting point about it is that the earth in
  which it is embedded seems to be similar to that on the coat; a mixture of
  loam and small fragments of chalk&mdash;a sort of chalk rubble. We will brush
  off the earth when we have looked over the other things."</p>

  <p>He laid it in a small cardboard tray and put it aside on the mantel-shelf.
  Then he turned his attention to the cigarette-tube which I held in my
  hand.</p>

  <p>"There," said I, handing it to him, "is another example of excellent but
  quite irrelevant clues."</p>

  <p>"How irrelevant?" he asked. "And irrelevant to what?"</p>

  <p>"To the subject of our inquiry," I replied. "Here is a highly distinctive
  object, for it was certainly never bought at a shop. As evidence in a case of
  doubtful identity, it would be quite valuable. But it is of no use to us. It
  gives us no hint as to where its owner is at present hiding."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled indulgently. "We mustn't expect too much, Jervis," said
  he; "in fact, we have no reason to expect anything. We are just looking over
  this jetsam as a matter of routine to note any facts that it may seem to
  suggest, without regard to their apparent relevancy or irrelevancy to our
  inquiry. You cannot judge the relevancy of an isolated fact. Experience has
  taught me, and must have taught you, that the most trivial, commonplace and
  seemingly irrelevant facts have a way of suddenly assuming a crucial
  importance by connecting, explaining or filling in the detail of later
  discoveries.</p>

  <p>"Take this cigarette-tube, for instance. It appears to be the property of
  Daniel Penrose. But how did he come by it? As you say, it was certainly not
  bought in the ordinary way at a shop. There is no suggestion of
  mass-production about it. It is an individual thing made by a particular
  person, and probably there is not another like it in the world. But if we
  look at it attentively, we can form some idea of the kind of person who made
  it and can even suggest the probable circumstances in which it was made.
  Thus, it is composed of a very hard, heavy, black wood, much like ebony in
  character but with a slight brownish tinge instead of the characteristic dead
  black. Probably it is African ebony. It is competently turned but with no
  special display of skill. The mouthpiece has been shaped with a chisel,
  whereas you or I would have used a file on such a very hard material. The
  suggestion is that the chisel was a tool to which the maker was accustomed
  and which he used with facility. Then the rather artless but quite pleasant
  decoration consists of a pattern of circular white spots, each an eighth of
  an inch in diameter, made, apparently, by boring holes probably with a Morse
  drill&mdash;right through the half finished piece and driving into them
  little dowels of holly or some other white hardwood, which would be cut off
  flush when the work was finished in the lathe. Then there is the suggestion
  that the tube was made from odd scrap of wood, left over from some larger
  work."</p>

  <p>"How do you arrive at that? I asked.</p>

  <p>"I think," he replied, "it is suggested by this little streak of sapwood.
  It is a distinct blemish, and one feels that it would have been avoided if a
  larger piece of wood had been available. So you see that the impression we
  get is of a workman who was handy with a paring-chisel but also had some
  skill as a turner; possibly a joiner or cabinet-maker who had a lathe in his
  workshop."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "he may have been, and, on the other hand, he may not. I
  don't see that it matters. He is not our pigeon. What seems to me of more
  interest&mdash;though mighty little at that&mdash;is that there is a
  good-sized stump of a cigarette still in the tube. It looks as if Penrose had
  dropped the holder in his pocket with the cigarette still alight; and if he
  did that&mdash;in a motor car, with plenty of petrol vapour about&mdash;he
  must have been either drunk or frightened out of his wits.</p>

  <p>"What is the next proceeding?"</p>

  <p>"I think," said he, as he deposited the licence, the cigarette-tube and
  the stump of pencil provisionally in a cardboard box, "we had better collect
  as much earth as we can get off the coat to examine at our leisure. We shall
  want one or two photographic dishes, a clean toothbrush, a glass funnel, a
  wide-mouthed jar and a few filter-papers. Do you mind getting them while I
  damp the coat?"</p>

  <p>I ran up to the laboratory and collected these articles, and when I
  returned with them I found Thorndyke with the coat spread out on the table,
  cautiously damping the larger mud-stains with a sponge; and we at once fell
  to work on the rather dirty and not very thrilling task of transferring the
  mud from the coat to one of the dishes, which I had partly filled with water.
  But the quantity that we collected by scraping with a paper-knife and
  brushing off into the water was quite surprising; and when, from the state of
  liquid mud in the dish, it was transformed into wet earth on a filter-paper,
  it at once took on the character of a definite and recognisable type of
  soil.</p>

  <p>"That," said Thorndyke as he carefully removed the filter-paper from the
  funnel and set it on a blotting-pad to drain, "we can examine later and, if
  necessary, with the aid of an expert geological opinion. It appears to be a
  rather fine reddish loam a little like the Thanet sands, with a few minute
  white particles, apparently chalk. But we shall see. And now let us take a
  look at Brodribb's alleged flower-pot."</p>

  <p>He brought the tray from the mantelpiece and, taking out the fragment,
  cautiously wetted its surface. Then, having first carefully washed the
  toothbrush, he proceeded to brush the earth from the pottery fragment into a
  small dish until it was completely clean, and, having dried its surface with
  blotting-paper and his handkerchief, put it aside while he collected the
  detached earth-on a filter-paper.</p>

  <p>"You notice, Jervis," said he as he opened out the filter-paper on the
  blotting-pad, "that it seems to be the same soil as that on the coat. There
  are more chalk particles and they are larger; but that is what we should
  expect, as the larger particles would have less tendency to adhere to the
  coat. And now let us have your considered opinion on this fragment."</p>

  <p>I took it from him and examined it with a decent pretence of interest (and
  an inward conviction that it didn't matter tuppence what it was).</p>

  <p>"I still think," said I, "that it looks like a piece of tile. The material
  is as coarse as brick and it has a slight curvature like that of an old
  hand-made tile. But I don't quite understand what those marks are. They are
  evidently not accidental."</p>

  <p>"No," he agreed, "and I think they exclude your diagnosis, and so does the
  definite thickening at the edge. But let us proceed systematically. I find it
  a help to a thorough examination of an object to describe it in detail as if
  one were preparing an entry in a museum catalogue."</p>

  <p>I agreed warmly and invited him to go ahead.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he, "if you feel unequal to the effort, the task
  devolves upon me. We will take the physical properties in regular order,
  beginning with the general character.</p>

  <p>"This is a fragment of pottery of excessively coarse and crude quality,
  consisting of a reddish buff matrix in which are embedded numerous angular
  white particles which have the appearance of burnt flint. The texture is
  somewhat porous and there is no trace of a glaze on either surface. On taking
  it in the hand, and allowing for the fact that it is wet, we find it
  noticeably heavy.</p>

  <p>"Size and shape. The fragment forms an irregular oblong, approximately an
  inch and a half long by three-quarters wide. Of the four sides, three are
  fractured&mdash;recently, you notice&mdash;and the fourth&mdash;one of the
  long sides&mdash;is thickened into a definite flange or rim, roughly T-shaped
  in section. The thickness, as shown by the calliper gauge, varies from five
  thirty-seconds of an inch at the thinnest broken edge to eleven
  thirty-seconds on the thick unbroken edge.</p>

  <p>"On the thick edge are five indented marks such as might have been made
  with a blunt knife on the soft clay, roughly a quarter of an inch apart; and
  on the convex surface, next to the long broken edge, are four similar linear
  indentations, roughly half an inch apart and at right angles to the thickened
  edge.</p>

  <p>"The fragment is curved in both diameters, rather irregularly, but still
  quite definitely. Let us see, approximately, what those curvatures amount
  to."</p>

  <p>He took a sheet of writing-paper and placed the fragment on it, standing
  up on its thick edge, and, with a sharp pencil, carefully traced the outline.
  The tracing showed the curvature very distinctly; and it became still more
  obvious when he placed a straightedge against the concave side and connected
  the two ends with a ruled line. Then he produced a pair of compasses
  furnished with a pencil, and, setting the pencil-point on one end of the
  ruled line, was able, after one or two trials, to strike an arc which passed
  through both ends of the line and followed the curve of the tracing. On
  measuring the distance from the centre to the arc, it was found to be three
  inches and an eighth.</p>

  <p>"We see, then," said he, "that the curve has a radius of three inches and
  an eighth, so that it seems to be part of a circle, six inches and a quarter
  in diameter. Now, let us try the other curvature."</p>

  <p>He stood the fragment up on one of its short ends and made a tracing as
  before. Measurement of this showed a curve with a radius of two inches and
  three-quarters.</p>

  <p>"We can't take this last measurement very seriously," said he, "as the
  curve is so very short and irregular. But you see that we now have the
  material for a fairly reliable reconstruction of the object of which this
  fragment formed a part. It appears to have been an earthenware vessel of the
  very coarsest and crudest type, with curved sides&mdash;some kind of bowl or
  pot&mdash;approximately six inches across the top, or mouth, and possibly
  about three inches high. But the height is a matter of mere guess-work. The
  irregularity in the curvature of the mouth makes it pretty certain that the
  vessel was built by hand, not thrown on the wheel; and this suggestion is
  confirmed by the extremely crude and primitive decoration. The thickened rim
  of the mouth is ornamented by a series of linear markings about a quarter of
  an inch apart, made, apparently, by indenting with a blunt knife, or perhaps
  a long thumb-nail, on the soft clay; and there is another series of similar
  markings, a little wider apart, which encircles the vessel about half an inch
  below the rim.</p>

  <p>"There, Jervis, is a summary of the characteristics which enable us to
  form a reasonably exact picture of the object which yielded this fragment.
  Taking them together and in conjunction with the fact that the fragment was
  found in the pocket of a man who is known to be a collector of antiquities,
  what conclusion do you arrive at?"</p>

  <p>"Concerning the object? Well, I suppose we must conclude that the pot or
  bowl must have been an extremely ancient vessel, perhaps prehistoric. It
  would hardly be Roman."</p>

  <p>"No," he agreed. "Roman pottery was the product of a developed industry
  with quite advanced technical methods. This was quite a primitive piece of
  work; certainly pre-Roman, I should say, and more probably neolithic than
  Bronze Age. But that is a question which we can easily settle by inquiries or
  reference to published work."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I; "and when you have settled it, you will be exactly where
  you are now, so far as the abiding-place of Daniel Penrose is concerned, and
  where you were before you carried out this very interesting little
  investigation. You will have established a fact that can have no possible
  bearing on the problem that you are asked to solve."</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" he retorted. "We have learned that Penrose had in his pocket
  a fragment of ancient pottery. It is not likely that he picked it up by
  chance on the road; and if he did not, it is possible that we may have here a
  clue to the purpose with which he set out on his travels on the day when he
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"But," I persisted, "even if you knew that, you would be no more forward.
  He certainly did not set out with the purpose of killing an old woman and
  becoming a fugitive from the law. You would just have another irrelevant
  fact."</p>

  <p>He smiled as he dropped the fragment into the box, together with the two
  filter-papers. "It is quite likely that you are right, Jervis," said he. "But
  we have already agreed that the relevancy of a fact often fails to be
  perceived until the appearance of some further facts brings its significance
  into view. It is always much easier to be wise after the event."</p>

  <p>With this, he deposited the cardboard box in the drawer of a cabinet,
  while I hung the wet coat on a peg in the lobby. Then we disposed ourselves
  in our respective chairs to smoke the final pipe before turning in and,
  dismissing the affairs of Daniel Penrose, chatted somewhat discursively on
  the morning's doings in court. But, in the intervals of our talk I found my
  thoughts drifting back to the cardboard box and to the occupations with which
  it was associated. And not only then but in the days that followed did that
  curious little investigation furnish me with matter for reflection.</p>

  <p>Of course, Thorndyke was perfectly right in his contention. It is
  impossible to decide in advance whether a particular item of knowledge may or
  may not prove at some future time to be of value; and it was a fact that
  Thorndyke made a rule of acquiring every item of knowledge that was
  obtainable in connection with a case, without regard to its apparent
  relevancy. But, still, I had the feeling that, in this present case, he was
  not merely acting on this rather academic principle. The care and
  thoroughness and the appearance of interest with which he had made this
  examination conveyed to me the impression that the facts elicited meant more
  to him than they did to me.</p>

  <p>Yet what could they mean? The disappearance of Penrose had the hospital as
  its starting-point, or, at the earliest, the accident to the old woman. But
  the mud and the pottery fragment were related to events that had occurred
  before the accident, and which were, therefore, totally unconnected with the
  disappearance. Then how could they possibly throw any light on the present
  whereabouts of the missing man, which was the problem that we had to
  solve?</p>

  <p>That was the question that I asked myself again and again. But by no
  amount of cogitation could I find any answer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-7"
     id="ch2-7"></a>VII. &mdash; A VISIT OF INSPECTION</h2>

  <p class="first">The dubious and slightly bewildered state of mind to which I
  have referred induced me to observe Thorndyke's proceedings with a little
  closer attention than was usual with me. Not that there was really any
  occasion, for Thorndyke appeared to go out of his way to make me a party to
  any doings connected with the Penrose case; which tended to increase my
  suspicion that I had missed some point of evidential importance.</p>

  <p>It was some two or three days after Brodribb's visit to us, when we seemed
  to have a few hours at our disposal, that Thorndyke suggested a call at Queen
  Square to examine Penrose's car. I had been expecting this suggestion, and,
  with the hope of getting some new light on the purpose of his investigations,
  assented cheerfully. Accordingly, when Thorndyke had slipped a good-sized
  note-book and some other small necessaries into his pocket, we set forth on
  our quest.</p>

  <p>I have always liked Queen Square, and have watched, regretfully, its
  gradual deterioration&mdash;or "improvement," as the optimistic modern phrase
  has it. When I first knew the place, it was nearly intact, with its
  satellites, Great Ormond Street, The Foundling Hospital and the group of
  other pleasant old squares adjacent. As we walked towards it we discussed the
  changes that the years had wrought. Thorndyke, as an old Londoner,
  sympathised warmly with my regrets.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed, "the works of man tell us more about him than we can
  gather from volumes of history. Every generation leaves, in the products of
  its activities, a faithful picture of its capabilities, its standard of taste
  and its outlook on life. The people who conceived and created these
  delightful, dignified haunts of peace and quiet, had never heard of
  town-planning and did not talk much about architecture. But they planned
  towns by instinctive taste and they built charming houses, the dismembered
  fragments of which we can now study in our museums. There is a beautiful
  wooden portico at South Kensington which I used to admire when it stood in
  Great Ormond Street."</p>

  <p>"I remember it," said I. "But in the museum they have scraped off the
  paint and gilding to show the construction; which is all very interesting and
  instructive, but is not quite what the architect had in view when he designed
  it. It is rather as if one should offer the anatomical exhibits in the
  Hunterian museum as illustrations of the beauty of the human figure. They
  might have restored the painting and gilding so that visitors could see what
  a fine London door-way was like in the time of Good Queen Anne."</p>

  <p>As I spoke, we turned out of Great Ormond Street and crossed the square,
  passing the ancient pump with its surmounting lantern and its encircling
  posts, and directing our steps towards Penrose's house, which had been
  described as nearly opposite the statue of Queen Anne. As we approached the
  latter, Thorndyke remarked, continuing our discussion:</p>

  <p>"There is another example of what is practically a lost art. It seems to
  me a pity that leadwork should have been allowed to fall into such a state of
  decay. Lead may not be an ideal material for statues, but it is imperishable,
  it is cheap and it is easy to work. In the eighteenth century, the Piccadilly
  foundries, from which this statue probably came, turned out thousands of
  works&mdash;urns and vases, shepherds and shepherdesses and other rustic
  figures for use in parks and formal gardens or as architectural ornaments.
  But they have nearly all gone; melted down, I suppose, to form sheet lead or
  water pipes. This looks like the house, and a fine old house it is; one of
  the last survivors of its family."</p>

  <p>We ascended to the broad door-step, enclosed by forged railings bearing a
  pair of link-extinguishers and the standard for an oil lamp, gave a tug at
  the old-fashioned bell-pull and executed a flourish on the handsome brass
  knocker. After a decent interval, the door was opened by a smart-looking
  maid-servant to whom Thorndyke communicated the purpose of our visit.</p>

  <p>"We have called to see Mr. Kickweed on certain legal business. I think he
  is expecting a visit from me. I am Dr. Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>On this the maid opened the door wide, and, inviting us to enter,
  conducted us to a small room adjacent to the hall, where she requested us to
  wait while she informed Mr. Kickweed of our arrival. When she had gone, I
  cast an inquisitive glance round the room, which contained a table, two
  chairs and a piece of furniture which might have been regarded either as a
  cupboard or as some kind of sideboard.</p>

  <p>"This can hardly be the room in which the burglary took place," said I,
  "though it fits the description to some extent, but the window seems in the
  wrong place."</p>

  <p>"Very much so," said Thorndyke, "as it looks out on the square and is over
  the area. And it is the wrong sort of cupboard with the wrong sort of lock.
  No, this is not the mysterious chamber."</p>

  <p>Here the door opened slowly and discreetly to admit a pale-faced, rather
  unwholesome-looking elderly man who bowed deferentially and introduced
  himself by name as Mr. Kickweed; though the introduction was hardly
  necessary, for he might have served, in a museum of social anthropology, as a
  type specimen of the genus, upper manservant.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brodribb wrote to me, sir," he continued in a melancholy tone, "to
  say that you would probably call and instructing me to give you any
  assistance that I could. In what way can I have the pleasure of carrying out
  those instructions?"</p>

  <p>"My immediate object," replied Thorndyke, "is to inspect Mr. Penrose's
  car. Has anything been done to it since it came back?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever, sir," Kickweed replied. "I suppose it ought to be
  cleaned, but I know nothing about cars. Mr. Penrose always attended to it
  himself excepting when it went out for repairs, and he always kept the garage
  locked up. In fact, it was locked when they brought the car back."</p>

  <p>"Then how did you get the car in?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"The police officer, sir, who came with the car, fortunately had a few odd
  keys with him, and one of them happened to fit the lock. He was good enough
  to leave it with me, so I shall be able to let you in. If you would like to
  go round there now I will just get my hat and show you the way."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Thorndyke. "If it is not troubling you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is no trouble at all, sir," interrupted Kickweed, and thereupon he
  stole out of the room with the light, noiseless tread that seems to be almost
  characteristic of heavy, bulky men. A few minutes later he reappeared in
  correct morning dress, including a slightly rusty top hat, and we set forth
  together. The garage was not far away, being situated in a sort of mews,
  approached from Guilford Street. As we halted at the door and Kickweed
  produced the key, I noticed that Thorndyke cast an inquisitive glance at it,
  and I guessed what was in his mind, because it was also in mine. But we were
  both wrong. The key was not of the filed or skeleton variety but was just a
  normal warded key of a simple type. However, it turned in the lock, after a
  good deal of persuasion, and, the doors being flung open, we entered.</p>

  <p>It was a roomy place and fairly well lighted by a wide window above the
  doors. The car stood in the middle, leaving ample space on either side and
  still more at the end, where a rough bench had been placed, with a vice and a
  number of rather rusty tools together with various oddments in the way of
  bolts, nuts and miscellaneous scrap.</p>

  <p>"I take it," said Thorndyke, glancing at the littered bench, "that Mr.
  Penrose is not a skilled mechanic."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," Kickweed admitted. "I don't think he is much of a workman. And
  yet he used to spend a good deal of time here. I don't know what he would
  have been doing."</p>

  <p>"You did not assist him, then?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I have only been in here once or twice, and then only for a few
  minutes with Mr. Penrose. I never came here by myself, nor, I think, did
  anybody else. There was only one key, until I got this one, and Mr. Penrose
  kept that himself, and has it still."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you don't know of any reason why he should have objected to
  your coming here alone?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. And I don't think there was any. It was just his way. He has
  rather a habit of making secrets of nothing."</p>

  <p>"So I have understood," said Thorndyke, "and a very bad habit it is,
  leading to all sorts of unnecessary suspicions and surmises. However, we came
  here primarily to inspect the car, so perhaps we had better get on with
  that."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, he proceeded to make a systematic and detailed survey of the
  vehicle, beginning with the bent mudguard, the leading edge of which he
  examined minutely with the aid of a lens. But, if there had ever been any
  fibres or other traces of the collision, they had been removed by the police.
  He then transferred his attention to the wheels, and, after a preliminary
  glance at them, produced one or two envelopes from his pocket and laid them
  on the bench.</p>

  <p>"The dirt on the face of the tyres," he remarked, "is of no interest to
  us, as it will have changed from moment to moment. But that on the inside and
  on the rims of the wheels is more significant. Its presence there suggests
  that, at one time, the car had been driven over quite soft earth; and that
  earth was a natural soil, not a road material; a reddish loam similar to that
  on the coat."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "it is evident that the wheels sank in pretty deep by the
  quantity of soil on the rims. And I think," I added, stooping low to look
  under the car, "that I can see a leaf sticking to the rim of the wheel."</p>

  <p>With some difficulty I managed to reach in and pick it off together with
  the lump of dry loam in which it was embedded.</p>

  <p>"A dead leaf," Thorndyke pronounced when I handed it to him; "I mean a
  last year's leaf, and it looks like a hornbeam. But we shall see better when
  we wet it and flatten it out."</p>

  <p>He deposited the leaf and earth in an envelope, on which he wrote a brief
  memorandum of the source of the specimen, and then continued his examination.
  But there was nothing more to be seen from the outside excepting a general
  dirtiness, suggestive of a not very fastidious owner. Nor was there anything
  very significant to be seen when I opened the door. The interior showed no
  signs of anything unusual. The floor was moderately clean excepting that
  under the driver's seat, which was thickly plastered with loam. But this was
  what we should have expected; and the evidence that it furnished that there
  was almost certainly only one person in the car during that last drive,
  merely confirmed what we already knew. There were no loose articles in any of
  the pockets or receptacles other than the insurance certificate and the
  rather scanty outfit of tools. In fact, the only discovery&mdash;and a very
  modest one at that&mdash;was another dead leaf, apparently also hornbeam,
  trodden flat into the dirt by the driver's seat.</p>

  <p>Having finished with the car, Thorndyke once more glanced round the garage
  and I could see that he was making a mental inventory of the various objects
  that it contained. But his next question reverted to the car.</p>

  <p>"I understood," said he, "that the police found an empty flask in the
  car."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied Kickweed. "I took that away to wash it and polish it
  up. It is a silver flask and it seemed a pity to leave it in the dirty state
  in which it was found. I have cleaned it thoroughly and put it away among the
  plate. Did you wish to see it?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke, "but I should like a few particulars. About how
  much does it hold?"</p>

  <p>"It holds the best part of a bottle. About an imperial pint."</p>

  <p>"That is a large flask," Thorndyke remarked. "Did Mr. Penrose usually
  carry it in the car?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know, sir, I really can't say. I have only seen it once before.
  That was about two years ago when I happened to be brushing Mr. Penrose's
  overcoat and found it in the pocket. But I have the impression that he
  usually carried it with him when he went away from home. He would be likely
  to because he is rather fastidious about his wine. He drinks nothing but
  Madeira and old brown sherry; and you can't get good Madeira or brown sherry
  at roadside inns."</p>

  <p>"And as to quantity? It has been stated that when he was last seen he
  appeared to be under the influence of liquor. Was that at all usual?"</p>

  <p>Kickweed shook his head emphatically. "No, sir," he replied. "That must
  have been a mistake. He may have smelt of sherry. He often does. But sherry
  has a very strong aroma and a little of it goes a long way in the matter of
  smell. But in all the years that I have known Mr. Penrose, I have never seen
  him in the slightest degree the worse for drink. He does certainly take a
  good deal, as I can judge by the wine merchant's deliveries and the empty
  bottles, but then he takes no beer or spirits or any other kind of wine. They
  must have been misled by the odour."</p>

  <p>"That seems quite likely," said Thorndyke. "By the way, I notice a couple
  of hazel twigs hanging up there under that hat. Do you happen to know whether
  Mr. Penrose is a dowser?"</p>

  <p>"A dowser, sir?" Kickweed repeated with mystified air.</p>

  <p>"A water-finder," Thorndyke explained. "That is what those forked twigs
  are used for." He took the hat from the peg and laid it on the bench, and,
  taking down one of the twigs, held it by its two ends and continued: "The
  specially gifted persons&mdash;known as dowsers&mdash;who search for
  underground streams or springs, hold the twig in this way and walk to and fro
  over the land where they expect to find water; and when they pass over a
  hidden spring&mdash;so it is stated&mdash;they become aware of the presence
  of underground water by a movement of the twig in their hands. It looks as if
  Mr. Penrose had practised the dowser's art.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Kickweed, "I remember now that Mr. Penrose once showed me
  one of these things and told me about it. But I thought it was one of his
  little jokes; for it was not water that he professed to be able to find with
  it. He said that it was an infallible guide to buried treasure. It would show
  the treasure-seeker exactly where to dig. But I never supposed that he was
  speaking seriously. You see, sir, Mr. Penrose is rather a jocular gentleman
  and it is sometimes a little difficult to be quite sure what he really does
  mean."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," said Thorndyke, "and he may have been joking in this
  case. But the idea of digging seems to have been in his mind. Now, so far as
  you know, did he ever engage in any sort of digging activities in his search
  for antiquities?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," replied Kickweed, "it is rather difficult to say. He is so
  very facetious. But I have known him to bring home certain
  articles&mdash;lumps of flint and bits of crockery, they looked like to
  me&mdash;which were covered with earth and which I have helped him to scrub
  clean at the scullery sink. I supposed that he must have dug them up
  somewhere as he referred to them as 'Treasure Trove' and 'the
  resurrectionist's loot' and other similar expressions."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "those expressions and the condition of the
  objects certainly suggest something in the way of excavations. But I don't
  see any tools suitable for the purpose; and I should suppose that if he had
  had any he would have kept them here. Do you happen to remember having seen
  any picks, shovels or similar tools here or elsewhere?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Kickweed reflected as he ran an inquiring glance round the walls. "As
  I said, sir," he replied, "I have only been in here once or twice before Mr.
  Penrose went away. But I seem to remember a sort of pick&mdash;I think it is
  called a trenching tool&mdash;which I don't see now. And there was a small
  spade, pointed like the ace of hearts, with a leather case for the blade. But
  I don't see that either. It hung, I think, on one of those pegs. But that was
  over a year ago."</p>

  <p>"It looks," I suggested, remembering the pottery fragment, "as if Mr.
  Penrose may have taken them with him when he left home. They were not in the
  car when it was found, but it had then been lying unattended for a couple of
  days. Loose property has rather a way of disappearing from derelict
  cars."</p>

  <p>"It is quite possible," said Thorndyke; and he then appeared to dismiss
  the subject, for he replaced the hazel twig on its peg and picked up the hat
  to return that also, but paused, looking with a faint smile into its dusty
  and decayed interior.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Penrose," he remarked, "seems to have attached undue value to this
  relic. But perhaps the marking was done when it was in a more presentable
  condition."</p>

  <p>He exhibited the interior of the hat, on the crown of which the name "D.
  Penrose" had been carefully printed with a rubber stamp.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Kickweed, "the name was probably stamped when the hat was
  new. Not that that would have made any difference, for Mr. Penrose stamped
  his name on everything that he possessed; not only on his underclothing and
  handkerchiefs and the things that are usually marked, but his hats, shoes,
  books, paper-knives&mdash;everything that was movable. It always seemed to me
  a little inconsistent."</p>

  <p>"How inconsistent?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I mean," replied Kickweed, "he is in general a very secret gentleman. He
  makes a secret of the most simple and ordinary things. And yet he prints his
  full name, not just his initials as most men do, inside his hat and his shoes
  and his waistcoat lining, and even on his pocket-knife. Now, if a stranger
  asked him his name he would probably avoid telling him; but yet, as soon as
  he takes his hat off, he discloses his identity to all the world."</p>

  <p>"I take it," said Thorndyke, "that he usually does the stamping
  himself?"</p>

  <p>"Lord bless you, yes, sir! That rubber stamp has always been kept under
  lock and key as if it had been the Koh-i-noor, or as if it could have been
  used for forging his signature. I have never even seen it. But, of course,
  that signifies nothing. It is just his way."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "and you are a wise man, to accept his harmless
  oddities and not let them worry you." He hung the hat on its peg and then,
  turning to Kickweed, opened a fresh subject.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brodribb consulted me about a burglary that occurred in your house a
  short time ago. There was a question of calling in the police and getting the
  cupboard opened. How does that suggestion strike you?"</p>

  <p>"It strikes me," Kickweed replied severely, "as an improper and a foolish
  suggestion. It would be improper to tamper with Mr. Penrose's property in his
  absence and without his consent, sir, and it would be foolish because we
  should be none the wiser when we had opened the cupboard as we don't know
  what it contained, or whether it contained anything."</p>

  <p>Here I interposed rather rashly.</p>

  <p>"The suggestion has been made that it is just possible that the person who
  entered the room may have been Mr. Penrose himself."</p>

  <p>Kickweed looked, and professed to be, deeply shocked. But I had,
  nevertheless, a strong suspicion that that was his own opinion.</p>

  <p>"But, you know, Mr. Kickweed," said I, "there is nothing immoral or even
  improper in a gentleman's entering his own house to take his own property if
  he happens to have need of it. Most men, it is true, would prefer to enter by
  the front door. But Mr. Penrose was not like most men; and if he preferred
  the window, he was entirely within his rights. It was his own window."</p>

  <p>I had the feeling that my observations were received with approval and
  even with some relief. But Mr. Kickweed, if he secretly concurred, as I
  believed that he did, was not committing himself.</p>

  <p>"No doubt, sir," said he, "you are perfectly right. But I couldn't imagine
  Mr. Penrose doing anything so undignified, especially as he had the key of
  the front door in his pocket. And," he added, with a pensive smile, "it was
  his own front door."</p>

  <p>"You were saying just now," said Thorndyke, "that nothing is known as to
  the contents of that cupboard. Have you no idea at all as to what it
  contained, or contains?"</p>

  <p>"I said knowledge, sir," replied Kickweed. "I know nothing at all as to
  what is, or has been, in that cupboard."</p>

  <p>He spoke with an emphasis that gave us clearly to understand that he was
  not going beyond his actual knowledge. He was going to hazard no
  opinions.</p>

  <p>"And it is the fact, Mr. Kickweed," Thorndyke pursued, "that there is no
  one in the world who knows, or could form any reasonable judgement as to what
  that cupboard did, does or might contain?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Kickweed reflected, a trifle uneasily, I thought. But Thorndyke's
  question admitted of no evasion, and he at length replied with some
  reluctance:</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I wouldn't say that, for there is one person who may possibly
  know. I have not spoken of him to any one hitherto, because Mr. Penrose was
  very secret about that room, and he is my employer and it is my duty to abide
  by his wishes, whether expressed or not. But you ask me a definite question
  and I suppose you are entitled to an answer. I think it possible that Mr.
  Penrose may have confided his secret to a certain friend of his; a gentleman
  named Lockhart."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think that Mr. Lockhart may know what is or was, in the
  cupboard?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"The discovery&mdash;if it was one&mdash;" Kickweed replied, "was quite
  accidental. Mr. Lockhart came to the house by appointment to look over the
  collection, and Mr. Penrose took him into the great gallery. When they had
  been there some considerable time, I ventured to look in to ask if I should
  bring them up some tea. But when I entered the big gallery they were not
  there; but I could hear them talking, and the voices seemed to come from the
  small room, though the door of that room was shut. But they must have been in
  there because there was no other room that opened out of the great gallery.
  Now the small room contained nothing but the cupboard, so that if Mr. Penrose
  took Mr. Lockhart into that room, it could only have been to show him what
  was in the cupboard. And I did, in fact, hear sounds of movement in the room
  as if drawers were being pulled out. But, of course, as soon as I realised
  what was happening, I went away.</p>

  <p>"But there was another circumstance that made me think that Mr. Penrose
  might have let Mr. Lockhart into the secret of the small room. When they had
  finished with the collection they went into the morning-room&mdash;the little
  front room that you went into&mdash;and I took them up some tea; and there
  they were for quite a long time before Mr. Lockhart went away. Afterwards I
  learned from Mr. Penrose, himself, that Mr. Lockhart had been advising him
  about insuring the collection, which made it seem likely that Mr. Lockhart
  had been shown all that there was to insure."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "that seems a reasonable inference. Is Mr. Lockhart
  connected with insurance business?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. He is a legal gentleman, a barrister."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Thorndyke. "Lockhart. Now I wonder if that would be&mdash;you
  don't happen to know what inn he belongs to?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. He belongs to Lincoln's Inn, at least, that is his address. I
  happen to know by having seen a card of his which Mr. Penrose left on his
  dressing-table."</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Lockhart an intimate friend of Mr. Penrose?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. Quite a recent acquaintance, I believe, though Mr. Penrose
  seemed to take to him more than he usually does to strangers. Still, I was
  rather surprised at his taking him into the small room. I have never known
  him to do such a thing before."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke made no immediate rejoinder, but stood apparently considering
  this last statement and letting his glance travel about the place as if
  searching for some further objects of interest. But it seemed that he had
  squeezed both the garage and Mr. Kickweed dry, for he said, at length:</p>

  <p>"Well, I think we have learned all that there is to learn here; and I must
  thank you, Mr. Kickweed, for having been so extremely helpful."</p>

  <p>Kickweed smiled a somewhat dreary smile. "I hope I have not been too much
  so, sir," said he. "I am not a willing helper, though I feel bound to carry
  out Mr. Brodribb's instructions. I understand from him that you are trying to
  find out where Mr. Penrose has gone to; and, if you will pardon me for saying
  so, I hope you won't succeed."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled appreciatively. "Now, why do you say that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Because, sir," Kickweed replied earnestly, "I feel that this pursuit is
  not justifiable. Mr. Penrose, as I understand, has had a little mishap and
  thinks it best to keep out of sight for a time. But if he thinks so, it is
  his own affair, and I don't consider it just or proper that other people, for
  their own purposes, should hunt him up and perhaps get him into
  difficulties."</p>

  <p>I must confess that I sympathised heartily with Mr. Kickweed's sentiments,
  and so, apparently, did Thorndyke, for he replied:</p>

  <p>"That is precisely what I pointed out to Mr. Brodribb. But there are legal
  reasons for ascertaining Mr. Penrose's whereabouts, though there are none for
  disclosing them to others. You may take it from me, Mr. Kickweed, that
  nothing which may come to my knowledge will be used in any way to his
  disadvantage."</p>

  <p>"I am very relieved to hear you say that, sir," Kickweed rejoined with
  evident sincerity, "because I have felt that there are others who take a
  different view. Mr. Horridge, for instance, has, to my knowledge, been in
  communication with the police."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, as we retired from the garage and Kickweed locked the
  door, "I don't suppose he has done any harm if he has no more to tell them
  than we have been told."</p>

  <p>As our way home led through Queen Square, we walked thither with Mr.
  Kickweed, and Thorndyke took the opportunity to ask a few questions
  concerning Mr. Penrose's collection.</p>

  <p>"I don't know much about the things," said Kickweed, "excepting that there
  is a rare lot of them and that they take a terrible amount of dusting. I do
  most of it with a pair of bellows when Mr. Penrose is not about. But if you
  feel any interest in them, why not step in, as you are here, and have a look
  at them yourself?"</p>

  <p>Now I have no doubt whatever that this was precisely what Thorndyke had
  intended to do, but, in his queer, secretive way, had preferred that the
  inspection should seem to occur by chance. At any rate, he accepted the
  invitation, and we followed Kickweed to the door of the house and were by him
  admitted to the hall.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-8"
     id="ch2-8"></a>VIII. &mdash; MR. HORRIDGE</h2>

  <p class="first">Mr. Kickweed, as has been mentioned, had a light tread, and
  his movements in general tended to be silent. Thus our entry into the hall of
  the old house and the subsequent closing of the door were almost noiseless.
  Nevertheless, our arrival was not unobserved; for, even as Kickweed was
  pocketing his latch-key, the door of the morning-room opened slowly and
  quietly and a large, distinctly fat gentleman appeared framed in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>There was something slightly odd and even ridiculous in the sudden and
  silent manner in which he became visible, and in the sly, inquisitive glance
  that he turned on us; as if he had been a plain-clothes officer and we a
  surprised party of burglars.</p>

  <p>"How did you know I was here, Kickweed?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I didn't, sir," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Oh," rejoined the other, "I thought these gentlemen might have come on
  some business with me."</p>

  <p>"No, sir. They have been inspecting the car. They are Dr. Thorndyke and
  Dr. Jervis."</p>

  <p>The fat man bowed stiffly. "Ah!" said he, "they have inspected the car.
  And now?"</p>

  <p>"Dr. Thorndyke thought he would like to take a look at the collection,"
  Kickweed replied frigidly, evidently resentful of the other man's manner, "so
  I invited him to step in and look over it."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said the fat gentleman. "You thought it quite in order to do that?
  Well, if Dr. Thorndyke wants to see the collection, there is no reason why he
  should not. I will show him round the gallery, myself. My name," he added,
  turning to us, "is Horridge. You have probably heard of me. I am Mr.
  Penrose's executor, and, in his absence, am keeping an eye on his
  property."</p>

  <p>Now, the tone of his remarks filled me with a burning desire to kick Mr.
  Horridge; but that being impracticable, I should certainly, if left to
  myself, have told him to go to the devil and forthwith walked out of the
  house. Thorndyke, however, was completely unruffled; and having once more
  thanked Kickweed, who was slinking away in dudgeon, he accepted the
  invitation with a suavity bordering on meekness (whereby I judged that he had
  definite reasons for wishing to see the collection).</p>

  <p>"So," said Mr. Horridge, as he conducted us along the hall, "you have been
  examining the car. Now, what did you expect to find out from the car?"</p>

  <p>"I did not expect anything," Thorndyke replied.</p>

  <p>Horridge giggled. "And did your examination answer your expectations?" he
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"Substantially," replied Thorndyke, "I may say that it did."</p>

  <p>Horridge giggled again, and, throwing open a door which opened from the
  hall, invited us to enter. We accordingly passed in and found ourselves in an
  immense and lofty room communicating with another of similarly magnificent
  proportions by an opening from which the original folding doors had been
  removed.</p>

  <p>I looked around me with surprise and extreme distaste, for the noble
  apartments had been degraded to the status of a mere lumber-room. Of the trim
  and orderly character of a museum there was not a trace. The walls were
  occupied by interminable ranges of open shelves and the floor was crowded
  with plain deal tables, coarsely stained and varnished to disguise their
  humble material; and shelves and tables were littered with a chaos of
  miscellaneous objects, all exposed baldly to the air and dust. There was not
  a single glazed case in the room and the only article of comely furniture was
  a lantern clock, perched on a bracket, which ticked sedately and actually
  showed the approximately correct time.</p>

  <p>"This is a very singular collection," Thorndyke remarked, casting a
  puzzled glance over the shelves and tables. "One doesn't quite see what its
  purpose is; what it is intended to illustrate."</p>

  <p>Horridge giggled again in his unpleasant way. "Whatever the intention is,"
  said he, "it illustrates very perfectly poor old Pen's usual state of
  mind&mdash;muddle. But may I ask what is the object of this inspection? Is it
  just a matter of curiosity or is it connected with the inquiry into Pen's
  disappearance? Because I don't see how the inspection is going to help
  you."</p>

  <p>"It is not very obvious, certainly," Thorndyke admitted. "But one never
  knows what light chance facts may throw on the problem. I think it will be
  worth while for me to see what things Mr. Penrose has collected and where he
  obtained them."</p>

  <p>Horridge grinned&mdash;and the explanation of the grin was presently
  forthcoming. Meanwhile he rejoined:</p>

  <p>"Well, cast your eye over the oddments and see what takes your fancy. Then
  you can go into the question of where they came from. What would you like to
  start with?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke glanced once more along the shelves and then announced his
  choice.</p>

  <p>"I see there is a good deal of ancient pottery, mixed up with other
  exhibits. Perhaps it would be well to sort that out and see where the pieces
  were found. Now, here is a little dish of Gaulish red ware. The slip of paper
  that it rests on bears the number, 201. That, I presume, refers to a
  catalogue."</p>

  <p>"It does," replied Horridge, giggling delightedly. "I will get you the
  catalogue and then you will be able to find out all about the specimen."</p>

  <p>He went to a table near the end of the room and pulled out a drawer from
  which he extracted a stout quarto volume. This he brought to Thorndyke and,
  having handed it to him with something of a flourish, stood looking at him
  and giggling like a fool. But the reason for his merriment became apparent
  when Thorndyke opened the book and turned to the number. Observing the slow
  smile which spread over my colleague's face, I looked over his shoulder and
  read the entry, scrawled, not very legibly, in pencil:</p>

  <p>201. Sammy. Pot Sand. Sinbad.</p>

  <p>"This is not very illuminating," Thorndyke remarked; on which Horridge
  burst into a roar of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't say that!" he gurgled. "I understood from old Brodribb that you
  could see through a brick wall. Well, here's your chance. The whole catalogue
  is written in the same damn silly sort of jargon. Of course, Pen knows what
  it means, but he doesn't intend that any one else shall. Perhaps you would
  like to note down a few samples to think over at your leisure."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke instantly grasped the opportunity.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said he. "A most excellent suggestion. If you will be so very
  kind as to show Dr. Jervis the collection, I will make a few notes on the
  pottery and extract the entries from the catalogue. If we could identify some
  of the localities, we might get quite a useful hint."</p>

  <p>This suggestion did not at all meet the views of Mr. Horridge, who was
  evidently as curious as to Thorndyke's proceedings as I was, myself. But he
  could not very well refuse; for Thorndyke, seeing a chance of carrying out
  his investigations&mdash;whatever they might be&mdash;uninterrupted by
  Horridge's chatter and free from his inquisitive observation, was quietly
  persistent and, of course, had his way, as he usually did.</p>

  <p>"Very well," Horridge at length agreed, with a rather bad grace, "then
  I'll just take Dr. Jervis round the shelves and show him the curios. But I
  don't know much about them, and I don't suppose he cares much."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, we set forth on a voyage of exploration round the crowded,
  disorderly shelves; and, realising that my function was to keep Horridge's
  attention distracted from Thorndyke's activities, I plied him with questions
  about the exhibits and commented on their interest and beauty with the utmost
  prolixity and tediousness at my command. But it was a wretched make-believe
  on both sides; for, while Horridge was answering my questions (usually quite
  ignorantly and all wrong, as even I knew) he kept one eye cocked in
  Thorndyke's direction, and my own attention was similarly occupied.</p>

  <p>But Thorndyke gave us but a poor entertainment. Drawing a chair up to a
  table near the window, he seated himself with his back to us and the
  catalogue before him. This he pored over for some time, making occasional
  entries in his note-book. Then he rose, and, having taken a survey of the
  shelves, began to select pieces of pottery, each of which he took in turn to
  the table where he examined it critically, compared it with the entry in the
  catalogue and copied the latter into his note-book. He began with the Roman
  pottery, but, from long acquaintance with his habits and methods, I suspected
  that this was only a tactical move to conceal from Horridge his actual
  purpose. For I knew that it was his invariable habit, when he had to work in
  the presence of inquisitive observers, to confuse the issues in their minds
  by actions which had no bearing on the matter in hand.</p>

  <p>As to his real purpose, I had no doubt that it was in some way connected
  with the fragment which we had examined; and as Horridge conducted me round
  the loaded shelves, I kept a sharp look-out for pottery exhibits which might
  correspond to the hypothetical vessel which Thorndyke had sketched in his
  reconstruction. There were two pieces (in different places and among totally
  unrelated objects) which, so far as I could see without close inspection,
  answered the description; one, a largish, rather shallow bowl of which a
  large part was missing, and the other a deeper pot which had been broken and
  rather unskilfully mended and which was complete save for a small part of the
  rim. This pot corresponded very closely both in shape and size with
  Thorndyke's reconstruction, and it seemed to me, even, that the piece which
  was missing from the rim was about the size of our fragment. Accordingly, I
  gave that pot my special attention.</p>

  <p>One after another Thorndyke gravely examined specimens of Roman, Saxon and
  Iron Age pottery in which I felt sure he could have no interest whatever. At
  last, after circling round, so to speak, he arrived at this pot, picked it
  up, and with a glance at the number on its paper, bore it over to the table.
  As he set it down and seated himself, I saw him take something from his
  pocket, but as his back was towards us I could not see what it was, or what
  he did with it. I assumed, however, that it was some measuring instrument and
  that he was ascertaining the dimensions of the piece that was missing. At any
  rate, his examination was quite brief, and, when he had copied the entry in
  the catalogue, he carried the pot back to its place and proceeded to look
  about for further objects for study.</p>

  <p>By this time, however, Horridge had begun to be rather bored and was
  disposed to make no secret of the fact.</p>

  <p>"I should think," said he, with an undisguised yawn, "that you've got
  enough material to occupy you for a month or two; and I'll wager that you
  don't make any sense of it then."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked thoughtfully at his open notebook. "Perhaps you are
  right," he agreed. "These entries will take a good deal of deciphering and
  probably will yield no information, after all. I don't think we need trespass
  on your patience any longer."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," said Horridge, "but, before you go&mdash;if you've
  seen all that you want to see&mdash;perhaps you might as well have a look at
  the small room&mdash;the one that was broken into, you know. You heard about
  that burglary, I think? Old Brodribb said he was going to consult you about
  it."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Brodribb did consult me," Thorndyke replied, "on the question of
  opening the cupboard by force or otherwise. I advised him that, in the
  absence of Mr. Penrose, it would not be proper to force the cupboard and
  that, as the contents of the cupboard were unknown, the proceeding would be
  useless as well as improper."</p>

  <p>"But what about calling in the police?" Horridge suggested.</p>

  <p>"I don't think the police would force a cupboard, without the owner's
  knowledge or consent, if it were locked and showed no signs of having been
  tampered with."</p>

  <p>"Well," Horridge grumbled, "it's very unsatisfactory. Some one may have
  got away with a whole lot of valuable property and able to dispose of it at
  their leisure. However&mdash;if you have finished with the catalogue, do you
  mind putting it back in its drawer?"</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke complied with this rather odd request, our host walked
  quickly up the long room to a door in the corner, and I had the impression
  that he inserted a key and turned it. But, as he stood half turned towards us
  and in front of the handle and keyhole, I could not see distinctly, nor did I
  give the matter any particular attention.</p>

  <p>"It is odd," he remarked, still standing before the door, grasping the
  handle, "that Pen should have left the key in this door when he went away. He
  was always so deadly secret about Bluebeard's chamber, as he called it in his
  silly way. He never let me see into it. I always thought he had something
  very precious in it; and I'm inclined to think so still."</p>

  <p>With this, he opened the door and we all entered the mysterious chamber; a
  smallish room and very bare of furniture, for it contained only a single
  chair, a mahogany table, placed under the window, and a massive cupboard,
  also of mahogany, with a pair of doors like a wardrobe.</p>

  <p>"So this is the famous cupboard," said Thorndyke, standing before it and
  looking it over critically; "the repository of hidden treasure, as you
  believe. Well, looking at it, one would say that whatever precious things
  were once in it, are in it still. But one might be wrong."</p>

  <p>Having made this rather ambiguous pronouncement, he proceeded to a more
  particular inspection. The escutcheon of the Chubb lock was examined with the
  aid of a lens, and the interior of the keyhole with the tiny electric lamp
  that he always carried. From the lock he transferred his attention to the
  cupboard itself, closely examining the sides, standing on the chair to
  inspect the top, and, finally, setting his shoulder to one corner and his
  foot against the skirting of the wall, tried to test its weight by tilting
  it. But beyond eliciting a complaining creak, he could make no impression on
  it. "I've tried that," said Horridge. "It's like shoving against the
  Eddystone lighthouse. The thing is a most ungodly weight, unless it is
  screwed to the floor. It can hardly be the stuff inside."</p>

  <p>"Unless," I suggested, "Mr. Penrose indulged in the hobby of collecting
  gold ingots. But even a collection of plate can be pretty heavy if there is
  enough of it."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said Thorndyke, "one thing is clear. That cupboard has not
  been opened unless it was opened with its own key."</p>

  <p>"Don't think the lock could have been picked?" said Horridge.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head. "Burglars don't try to pick Chubb locks," said
  he. "They use the jemmy, or else cut the lock out with centre-bits."</p>

  <p>Horridge grunted and then amplified the grunt with the remark:</p>

  <p>"Looks a bit as if our friend Kick had raised a false alarm."</p>

  <p>"That can hardly be," Thorndyke objected. "I understood that he found the
  door bolted on the inside and had to enter through the window."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that was what he said," Horridge admitted grudgingly in a tone that
  seemed to imply some scepticism as to the statement.</p>

  <p>"It is conceivable," Thorndyke suggested, "that the visitor may have been
  disturbed, or that he gave up the attempt when he found it impossible to pick
  the lock. You see, there is no evidence that he was a skilled burglar. No
  difficulties were overcome. He simply opened the window and stepped in. The
  really astonishing thing is that Penrose should have left the place so
  insecure&mdash;that is, assuming that there actually was some valuable
  property here. The window, as you can see, has no shutters, or even screws or
  stops, and it looks on to an alley which I understand is invisible from the
  street. Let us see what that alley is like."</p>

  <p>He moved the table away from the window, glancing at a number of parallel
  scratches on its polished surface, slid up the window and looked out.</p>

  <p>"It is quite remarkable," said he. "The window is only a few feet from the
  ground and the alley is closed by a small wooden gate which has no bolt or
  latch and seems to be secured only by a lock; which is probably a simple
  builder's lock which could be easily opened with a skeleton key or a common
  pick-lock. There is no security whatever. That stout bolt on the room door
  is, of course, useless, as it is on the inside; and the lock is probably a
  simple affair."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he opened the door and plucked out the key, which he held out
  for our inspection.</p>

  <p>"You see?" he said. "Just a plain warded lock which a skilled operator
  could turn with a bit of stiff wire. Penrose seems to have pinned his faith
  to the Chubb lock; and perhaps events have justified him."</p>

  <p>He slipped the key back into the lock; and this seemed to bring the
  proceedings to an end. After a few perfunctory expressions of hope that our
  visit had satisfied us and that we had seen all that we wished to see, our
  host escorted us through the great gallery and the hall and finally launched
  us into the street.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-9"
     id="ch2-9"></a>IX. &mdash; THORNDYKE TESTS A THEORY</h2>

  <p class="first">As we took our way homeward I tried to arrange in my mind
  the rather confusing experiences of the last hour or two. Those hours, it
  seemed to me, had been virtually wasted, for we had learned nothing new that
  bore directly on our problem. This view I ventured to propound to Thorndyke,
  beginning, naturally, with Mr. Horridge, who had made a deep and disagreeable
  impression on me.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "he is not a prepossessing person. A bad-mannered
  man and distinctly sly and suspicious. You probably noted his mental attitude
  towards Kickweed."</p>

  <p>"Yes, distinctly hostile; and I gathered that he is inclined to suspect
  him of having faked that burglary for his own ends. I suppose, by the way,
  that it is not possible that he may be right?"</p>

  <p>"It is not actually impossible," Thorndyke replied, "but there is nothing
  to support such a suspicion. Kickweed impressed me very favourably,
  especially by his loyalty to Penrose. If he is not a liar, the position with
  regard to the small room is this: some one entered that room; that some one
  either knew or thought he knew what it contained. He either failed to open
  that cupboard or he opened it with its own key. The only evidence that he did
  open it is the piece of paper that was found, which, you notice, was similar
  to the slips of paper under the specimens in the gallery, excepting that it
  bore no catalogue number but had an inscription similar to those in the
  catalogue. That paper strongly suggests that the cupboard had been opened,
  but is not conclusive, since it might have been dropped by Penrose on some
  other occasion. But, as I said, its presence is strongly suggestive of a
  hurried opening of the cupboard at night. There were one or two other points
  that probably did not escape you."</p>

  <p>"You mean the extraordinary weight of the cupboard? That certainly
  impressed me as significant though I am not quite clear as to what it
  signifies. It might be due to some ponderous contents, but it seemed to me to
  suggest an iron safe inside."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "that is undoubtedly the explanation. The cupboard
  is a mere wooden case enclosing a large iron safe. That was quite clear from
  the construction, which is very much like that of an organ case. The sides
  and top are fixed in position by large screws instead of being keyed in with
  proper cabinet-maker's joints. The wooden case was built on after the safe
  had been placed in position."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, "the Chubb lock is a mere hollow pretence."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. The wooden case could have been taken off with a common
  screw-driver. You noticed the scratches on the table?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But, of course, there is no evidence as to when they were made."</p>

  <p>"No," he agreed. "Probably they were made at various times. But they are
  of interest in relation to the arrangement of the cupboard. You must have
  noticed that they were in two groups, roughly two feet six inches apart and
  all approximately parallel. They looked like the scratches that would be made
  by the runners of drawers of that width; and comparing them with the
  cupboard, one saw that, allowing for the space taken up by the wooden case,
  there would just be room for a range of drawers of that width. The reasonable
  inference is that the iron safe houses a range of largish drawers and that
  these have been taken out from time to time and placed on the table so that
  their contents could be looked at by the light from the window."</p>

  <p>I agreed that this appeared to be the case, but I could not see that it
  mattered very much whether it was so or not.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," I added, "that we are acquiring a lot of oddments of
  information none of which has the slightest bearing on the one question that
  we are asked to answer: Where is Penrose hiding at the present moment?"</p>

  <p>"It would be safer," said he, "to say, 'seems to have'. I am picking up
  all the information that I can in the hope that some of it may turn out to
  have a bearing on our problem."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said I, "why were you so keen on seeing the collection? You
  were, you know, or you would not have put up with Horridge's insolence. You
  had some definite point to clear up respecting that pottery fragment. What
  was it?"</p>

  <p>"The point," he replied, "was this. To an archaeologist, that fragment
  alone would have been an object of interest, since, as you saw, it was
  possible to make from it a rough, but quite reliable reconstruction. But
  Penrose is not an archaeologist. He is, as we understood, a mere collector of
  curios. To such a man, a tiny fragment would be of no interest by itself.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, to an archaeologist, a broken pot is, practically, of
  the same scientific value as a complete pot. But to the mere collector, or
  curio-monger, the completeness of a specimen is a matter of cardinal
  importance. If he has an incomplete specimen, he will spare no trouble or
  expense to make it complete. He is not concerned with its scientific interest
  but with its value as a curio.</p>

  <p>"Knowing, then, what we did of Penrose, it occurred to me as a bare
  possibility that this apparently worthless fragment that we found in his
  pocket might be the product of a definite search ad hoc. That he might have
  re-visited some place from which he had obtained an incomplete specimen with
  the express purpose of searching for the fragment which would make it
  complete. The edges of the fragment were freshly fractured. It had been
  broken off the pot in the course of digging it out. Therefore, the missing
  piece of the pot was still in the place where the digging had taken place and
  was certainly recoverable, It was just a speculative possibility, but it was
  worth testing as we are so short of data, so I decided to look over the
  collection when I got a chance."</p>

  <p>"And I gather," said I, "that you obtained confirmation of your very
  ingenious theory?"</p>

  <p>"I am hoping that I did," he replied; "but we shall see when we get home.
  If I have, we shall have some sort of a clue to the place from which that
  disastrous homeward journey started."</p>

  <p>I forbore to remark that it did not seem to me to matter two straws where
  it started from, since it was evident that he thought the information worth
  acquiring. So I merely asked what the clue amounted to.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately," he replied, "it amounts to very little. This is the entry
  in the catalogue corresponding to the pot which I examined."</p>

  <p>He indicated the entry in his note-book, and I read:</p>

  <p>"Moulin a vent. Julie (Polly)."</p>

  <p>"What a perfect and complete ass the fellow must be," I exclaimed,
  returning the note-book in disgust, "to write meaningless twaddle like that
  in what purports to be a museum catalogue!"</p>

  <p>"I agree with you most warmly," he replied. "But the man's oddities are an
  element in our problem. And, of course, these preposterous entries in the
  catalogue are not meaningless. They have a meaning which is deliberately
  concealed and which we have got to extract."</p>

  <p>"In the case of this one?" I asked, "can you make any sense of it? Can
  you, for instance, discover any connection between an earthen pot and a
  windmill?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "I think that is fairly clear, though it doesn't help
  us much. There is a place in Wiltshire, near Avebury, known as Windmill Hill,
  where a certain distinctive kind of neolithic pottery has been found and
  which has been named the Windmill Hill type. Probably, this pot is an example
  of that type, but that is a question that we can easily settle, though it
  doesn't seem to be an important one. The information that we want is probably
  contained in the other two words; and, at present, I can make nothing of
  them."</p>

  <p>"No," I agreed, "they are pretty obscure. Who is Julie? What is she? And
  likewise: Who is Polly? Good God! What damned nonsense it is!"</p>

  <p>He smiled at my exasperation. "You are quite right, Jervis," said he. "It
  is monstrous that two learned medical jurists should have to expend their
  time and intellect in solving a set of silly puzzles. But it is part of our
  present job."</p>

  <p>"Do you find any method in this fellow's madness?" I asked. "I noticed you
  copying out a lot of this balderdash."</p>

  <p>"There is a little method," he replied. "Not much. But this entry,
  relating to that little embossed red ware dish that you saw, will illustrate
  Penrose's method. You see, it reads: 'Sammy. Pot Sand. Sinbad.' Now, this
  Gaulish red ware is usually described as Samian ware, so we may take it that
  'Sammy' means 'Samian.' The interpretation of 'Pot Sand' is also fairly
  obvious. There is a shoal in the Thames Estuary off Whitstable on which it is
  believed that a Roman ship, laden with pottery, went aground and broke up.
  From time immemorial, oyster dredgers working over that shoal have brought up
  quantities of Roman pottery, including Samian ware, whence the shoal has been
  named The Pan Sand, and is so marked on the Admiralty charts. Penrose's 'Pot
  Sand' is therefore, presumably The Pan Sand; and as to Sinbad, we may assume
  him to have been a sailor, probably an oyster dredger or a whelk fisher."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that you are right," said I, "but it is difficult to
  consider such childish twaddle with patience. I should like to kick the
  fellow."</p>

  <p>"I should be delighted if you could," said he, "for, since you would have
  to catch him before you could kick him, that would mean that our problem
  would be solved. By the way, we shall have to contrive, somehow, to make the
  acquaintance of Mr. Lockhart. I wonder if Brodribb knows him."</p>

  <p>"You think he could tell us what was in that small room. But I doubt if he
  would. Penrose would probably have sworn him to secrecy, and, in any case, it
  would be a matter of professional confidence. But it seems to me that the
  burglary is a side issue, though I know you will say that we can't judge
  which issues are side issues."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," he retorted, "the burglary is not one. It is very material.
  For, if Penrose was the burglar, he must be in possession of property which
  he intends to dispose of, by which, if we knew what it was, we might be able
  to trace him. And if the burglar was not Penrose, we should very much like to
  know who he was."</p>

  <p>I did not quite see why; but, as our discussion had now brought us to our
  doorstep, there was no opportunity to pursue the question; for, as I had
  expected, Thorndyke made straight for the laboratory, and I followed, with
  mild curiosity as to the test that I assumed to be in view. As we entered,
  the sound of Polton's lathe in the adjacent workshop informed us that he had
  some job on hand there, but his quick ear had noted our arrival and he came
  in at once to see if his services were required.</p>

  <p>"I need not disturb you, Polton," said Thorndyke. "It is only a matter of
  a small plaster mould."</p>

  <p>"You are not disturbing me, sir," replied Polton. "I am just turning up a
  few spare tool handles to pass the time. You would like the quick-setting
  plaster, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"If you please," Thorndyke replied; and as Polton retired to fetch the
  materials, he produced from his pocket a small tin box from which he tenderly
  shook out into his hand a slab of moulding wax. Looking at it as it lay on
  his palm, I saw that it was a "squeeze" of the edge of the pot, the gap in
  the broken rim being represented by a wart-like swelling of the shape of the
  missing piece. Noting the exact correspondence, I remarked:</p>

  <p>"You hardly want the plaster. The shape of the squeeze is exact enough for
  comparison."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed, "but an actual measurement is always better than a
  judgement of resemblance."</p>

  <p>Here, Polton returned with ajar of the special plaster, a rubber bowl, a
  jug of water and the other necessaries for the operation. Unobtrusively, but
  firmly taking possession of the squeeze, he laid it in one of the little
  paper trays that he used for making small moulds or casts, brushed it over
  lightly with a camel-hair brush containing a trace of oil, and then proceeded
  to mix the plaster. This had to be done quickly, since the special plaster
  set solid in about five minutes; and I could not but admire the calm,
  unhurried way in which Polton carried the process through its various stages.
  At exactly the right moment, the plaster was dropped on to the squeeze, blown
  with the breath into all the interstices, and then the remainder poured on
  until the little tray was full to the brim; and even as the last drops were
  being persuaded out of the bowl with a spoon, the change began which
  transformed the creamy liquid into a white solid like the "icing" on a
  wedding cake.</p>

  <p>At this point Thorndyke retired to fetch the fragment, and Polton and I
  took the opportunity to clean the bowl and spoon and spread on the bench a
  sheet of newspaper to receive the inevitable crumbs and scrapings; a most
  necessary precaution, for plaster, in spite of its delicate whiteness, is one
  of the dirtiest of materials. The particles which detach themselves from a
  cast seem to spread themselves over a whole room, with a special predilection
  for the soles of shoes, whence they distribute impressions on stairs and
  passages in the most surprising and unexpected fashion. But a sheet of paper
  collects the particles and enables them to be removed tidily before they have
  the opportunity to develop their diabolical tendencies.</p>

  <p>When Thorndyke returned our labours were completed, and the little tray
  reposed on the paper with the plaster tools beside it.</p>

  <p>"Is it hard enough to open?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>Polton tested with his finger-nail the smooth, white mass that bulged up
  from the tray, and, having reported that it was "set as hard as stone,"
  proceeded carefully to shell it out of the paper container. Then he scraped
  away the projecting edges until the wax was free all round. A little cautious
  persuading with the thumb induced the squeeze to separate from the plaster,
  when Polton laid them down side by side and looked expectantly at Thorndyke.
  The cast was now clearly recognisable as the replica of a portion of the
  outside surface of the pot, including the rim and the gap where a piece of
  the rim had been broken away.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke now produced the fragment of pottery, and, holding it delicately
  between his finger and thumb&mdash;for the plaster was still moist and
  tender&mdash;very carefully inserted it into the gap; and as it dropped in,
  exactly filling the space, with a perfect fit at every point, he
  remarked:</p>

  <p>"I think that settles the question of identity. This fragment is the piece
  that is missing from the museum pot."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed. "The proof is absolutely conclusive. What is not quite
  obvious to me is the importance of the fact which is proved. I see that it
  strongly supports your theory that the fragment was the product of a definite
  search, but it is not clear to me that even the confirmation of your theory
  has any particular value."</p>

  <p>"It has now very little value," he replied. "The importance of the fact
  which this experiment has established is that it carries us out of the region
  of the unknown into that of the known. If this fragment was part of the
  museum pot, then the place from which that pot came is the place from which
  this fragment came."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, "that is clear enough. And it is fair to assume that the
  place whence this fragment came is the place from which Penrose started on
  his homeward journey. But, as we don't know where the pot came from, I can't
  see that we have got so very far from the unknown. We have simply connected
  one unknown with another unknown."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled indulgently. "You are a proper pessimist, Jervis," said
  he. "But you will, at least, admit that we have narrowed the unknown down to
  a very small area. We have got to find out where that pot came from; and I
  don't think we shall have very much difficulty. Probably the catalogue entry
  embodies some clue."</p>

  <p>"But," I persisted, "even if you discover that, I don't see that you will
  be any further advanced. You will know where Penrose came from, but that
  knowledge will not help you to discover where he has gone to. At least, that
  is how it appears to me. But perhaps there is some point that I have
  overlooked."</p>

  <p>"My impression is," Thorndyke replied, "that you have not given any
  serious consideration to this curious and puzzling case. If you would turn it
  over in your mind carefully and try to see the connections between the
  various facts that are known to us, you would realise that we have got to
  begin by re-tracing that last journey to its starting-point."</p>

  <p>With this, he picked up the cast with the embedded fragment of pottery to
  put them into the box with the other "exhibits"; and, as he retired, Polton
  (who had been listening with a curious intentness to our conversation)
  gathered up the newspaper and the plaster appliances and went back to his
  lathe.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-10"
     id="ch2-10"></a>X. &mdash; INTRODUCES MR. CRABBE</h2>

  <p class="first">Thorndyke's rather cryptic observation gave me considerable
  food for thought. But it was not very nourishing food, for no conclusion
  emerged. He was quite right in believing that I had given little serious
  consideration to the case of Daniel Penrose. It had not greatly interested
  me, and I had seen no practical method by which the problem could be
  approached. Nor did I now; and the only result of my cogitations was to
  confirm my previous opinion that I had missed some crucial point in the
  evidence and to make me suspect that there was in this case something more
  than met the eye.</p>

  <p>This latter suspicion deepened when I reflected on Thorndyke's concluding
  statement: "You would realise that we have got to begin by re-tracing that
  last journey to its starting-point." But I did not realise anything of the
  sort. The problem, as I understood it, was to discover the present
  whereabouts of Daniel Penrose; and to this problem, the starting-point of his
  last known journey seemed completely irrelevant. But in that I knew that I
  must be wrong; a conviction which merely brought me back to the
  unsatisfactory conclusion that I had failed to take account of some vital
  element in the case.</p>

  <p>But it was not only in respect of that disastrous return journey that I
  was puzzled by Thorndyke's proceedings. There was his unaccountable interest
  in the burglary at Queen Square. Apparently, he believed the burglar to have
  been Penrose himself; and in this I was disposed to concur. But suppose that
  we were able to establish the fact with certainty; what help would it give us
  in tracing Penrose to his hiding-place? So far as I could see, it would not
  help us at all; and Thorndyke's keenness in regard to the burglary only
  increased my bewilderment.</p>

  <p>Naturally, then, I was all agog when, a few days later, Thorndyke
  announced that Mr. Lockhart was coming in to smoke a pipe with us on the
  following evening; for here seemed to be a chance of getting some fresh light
  on the subject. Lockhart was being lured to our chambers to be pumped, little
  as he probably suspected it, and if I listened attentively, I might catch
  some of the drippings.</p>

  <p>"You haven't forgotten," said I, "that Miller is likely to call to-morrow
  evening?"</p>

  <p>"'No," he replied, "but we have no appointment so he may choose some other
  time. At any rate, we must take our chance; and it won't matter so very much
  if he does drop in."</p>

  <p>It seemed to me that the superintendent would be very much in the way and
  I sincerely hoped that he would choose some other evening for his visit. But
  Thorndyke presumably knew his own business.</p>

  <p>"How did you get hold of Lockhart?" I asked. "Did Brodribb know him?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't ask him," Thorndyke replied. "I saw Lockhart's name in the list
  of cases at the Central Criminal Court so I dropped in there and introduced
  myself. When I told him that I was looking into Penrose's affairs, he was
  very ready to come in and hear all about the case."</p>

  <p>I laughed aloud. "So," said I, "this poor deluded gentleman is coming with
  the belief that he is going to be the recipient of information. It is a rank
  imposition."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he protested. "We shall tell him what we know of the case,
  and no doubt we shall learn something from him in exchange. At least, I hope
  we shall."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, "you are an optimist. If he knows anything that you don't,
  you can be pretty certain that he learned it under the seal of the
  confessional."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke agreed that I was probably right. "But," he added hopefully, "we
  shall see. It is sometimes possible to learn something from what a man
  refuses to disclose."</p>

  <p>I made a mental note of this observation and kept it in mind when our
  visitor arrived on the following evening, for it suggested to me that
  Thorndyke's questions might be more illuminating than the answers that they
  might evoke, particularly if our friend should turn out to be
  uncommunicative. But this did not, at first, appear to be the case, for,
  after a little general conversation, he led up to the subject of Daniel
  Penrose of his own accord.</p>

  <p>"I did not quite gather what it was," said he, "that your clients expected
  you to do. If it is a permissible question, what sort of inquiry are you
  engaged in?"</p>

  <p>"It is a perfectly permissible question," replied Thorndyke. "I can tell
  you all about the case without any breach of professional confidence as the
  main facts are already in the public domain. What I am expected to do is to
  discover the place in which Mr. Penrose is at present hiding, or at least to
  locate him sufficiently to make it possible to produce him, if
  necessary."</p>

  <p>"And apparently he doesn't want to be produced? But why not? Why has he
  gone into hiding? My very discreet informant told me that he had gone away
  from home and left no address, but she didn't mention any reasons for his
  disappearing. Are there any substantial reasons?"</p>

  <p>"He thinks that there are," replied Thorndyke. "But, if you are
  interested, I will give you a sketch of the circumstances of his
  disappearance, so far as they are known to me."</p>

  <p>"I am very much interested," said Lockhart. "Penrose is a queer
  fellow&mdash;the sort of fellow who might do queer things&mdash;and I don't
  know that I am so violently fond of him. But he always interested me as a
  human oddity, and I should like to hear what has happened to him."</p>

  <p>Thereupon, Thorndyke embarked on a concise but detailed account of the
  strange circumstances which surrounded Penrose's disappearance from human
  ken; and I listened with almost as much attention as Lockhart himself. For
  Thorndyke's clear summary of the events in their due order was a useful
  refresher to my own memory. But, what specially amused and delighted me was
  the masterly tactical approach to the cross-examination which I felt pretty
  sure was to follow. Thorndyke's perfectly open and unreserved narrative,
  treating the whole affair as one generally known, in respect of which there
  was not the slightest occasion for secrecy, was an admirable preparation for
  a few discreet questions. It would be difficult for Lockhart to adopt a
  reticent attitude after being treated with such complete confidence.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Lockhart, when the story was told, "it is a queer affair,
  but, as I remarked, Penrose is a queer fellow. Still, there are some points
  that rather surprise me."</p>

  <p>"For instance?" Thorndyke suggested.</p>

  <p>"It is a small matter," replied Lockhart, "and I may be mistaken in the
  man, but I shouldn't have expected him to be the worse for liquor. You seemed
  to imply that he was definitely squiffy."</p>

  <p>"It is only hearsay," Thorndyke reminded him, "and an inexpert opinion at
  that. The report may have been exaggerated. But, in your experience of him,
  should you say that he is a strictly temperate man?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't go so far as that," said Lockhart. "He is most uncommonly fond
  of what he calls 'the vintages of the Fortunate Isles' and the 'elderly and
  fuscous wine of Jerez,' and I should think that he gets through a fair amount
  of them, But he impressed me as a man who would take a glass, or two or three
  glasses, of sherry or Madeira pretty often, but not a great quantity at once.
  Your regular nipper, especially of wine, doesn't often get drunk."</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed, "though sherry and Madeira are strong wines. What
  were the other points?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Lockhart, "doesn't it strike you that the actions of
  Penrose are rather disproportionate to the cause? He seems to have been
  abnormally funky. After all, it was only a motor accident, and there isn't
  any clear evidence that it was his car. He could have denied that he was
  there. And, in any case, it doesn't seem worth his while to bolt off and
  abandon his home and all his worldly possessions. If he had committed a
  murder or arson or something really serious, it would have been
  different."</p>

  <p>"It was manslaughter," I remarked; "'and a rather bad case. And the
  vintages of the Fortunate Isles didn't make it any less culpable. He might
  have got a longish term of hard labour, even if he escaped penal
  servitude."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it was as bad as that," said Lockhart. "At any rate, if I
  had been in his place, I would have stayed and faced the music; and I would
  have left it to the prosecution to prove that I was on that road."</p>

  <p>"That," said Thorndyke, "is a matter of temperament. From your knowledge
  of Penrose, should you have taken him for a nervous, panicky man?"</p>

  <p>Lockhart reflected for a few moments. "You speak," said he, "of my
  knowledge of Penrose. But, really, I hardly know him at all. I made his
  acquaintance quite recently, and I have not met him half a dozen times."</p>

  <p>"You don't know his people, then?"</p>

  <p>"No. I know nothing about his family affairs. Our acquaintance arose out
  of a chance meeting at a curio shop in Soho. We walked away from the shop
  together, discussing collecting and antiques, and he then invited me to go
  and inspect his treasures. Which I did; and that is the only occasion on
  which I was ever in his house. But I must say that it was a memorable
  experience."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Lockhart, "there was the man, himself; one of the oddest
  fishes that I have ever encountered. But I dare say you have heard about his
  peculiarities."</p>

  <p>"I understand that he is a most inconveniently secretive gentleman, and
  also that he has an inveterate habit of calling things by their wrong
  names."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Lockhart, "that is what I mean. He speaks, not in parables,
  but in a sort of cross-word puzzles, leaving you to make out his meaning by
  the exercise of your wits. You can imagine what it was like to be shown round
  a collection by a man who called all the specimens by utterly and
  ridiculously inappropriate names."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke; "rather confusing, I should suppose. But you did
  see the collection; and perhaps he showed you the catalogue too?"</p>

  <p>"He did. In fact, he made a point of letting me see it in order, I think,
  to enjoy my astonishment. What an amazing document it is! If ever he should
  have to plead insanity, I should think that the production of that catalogue
  would make medical testimony unnecessary. I take it that you have seen it and
  the collection, too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "I examined the catalogue and made a few extracts
  with notes of the pieces to which they referred. And I was shown round the
  collection by Mr. Horridge, Penrose's executor. But I have an idea that he
  did not show us the whole collection. We saw only the collection in the great
  gallery; but probably you were more favoured, as you were shown round by the
  proprietor?"</p>

  <p>The question was very adroitly thrown out; but, at this point, Mr.
  Lockhart, as I had expected, developed a sudden evasiveness.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible for me to say," he replied; "as I don't know what the
  whole collection consisted of. I assumed that he had shown me all that there
  was to see."</p>

  <p>"Probably you were right," said Thorndyke; and then, coming boldly to the
  real issue, he asked: "Did he show you the contents of the small room?"</p>

  <p>For some moments Lockhart did not reply, but sat looking profoundly
  uncomfortable. At length, he answered in an apologetic tone: "It's a
  ridiculous situation, but you know what sort of man Penrose is. The fact is
  that when he showed me his collection, he made it a condition that I should
  regard the transaction as a strictly confidential one and that I should not
  discuss his possessions or communicate their nature or amount to any person
  whatsoever. It is an absurd condition, but I accepted it and consequently I
  am not in a position to tell you what he did actually show me. But I don't
  suppose that it is of any consequence. I take it that you have no special
  interest in his collection."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," said Thorndyke, "we have a very special interest in the
  collection, and particularly that part of it which was kept in the small
  room. Since Penrose went away, there has been a burglary&mdash;or a suspected
  burglary&mdash;at his house. The small room was undoubtedly entered one
  night, and there is a suspicion that the big cupboard was opened. But, if it
  was, it was opened with a key, as there was no trace of any injury to the
  doors. On the other hand, it is possible that the burglar failed to pick the
  lock and was disturbed. But Penrose has the only key of the cupboard, so
  there are no means of ascertaining, without picking the lock or forcing the
  door, whether there has or has not been a robbery; and we have decided that
  it would not be admissible to do either in Penrose's absence. Nevertheless,
  it is important for us to know what was in that cupboard."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why," said Lockhart. "If it is not admissible to force the
  door&mdash;and I entirely agree with you that it is not&mdash;I don't see
  that it would help you to know what was in the cupboard&mdash;or whether it
  contained anything at all. Supposing that it had certain contents, you cannot
  ascertain, without opening it, whether those contents are still there or
  whether they have been stolen. But, if you say that the lock has not been
  picked nor the door forced, and Penrose has the only key, doesn't that prove
  pretty conclusively that no burglary has taken place?"</p>

  <p>At this moment, a familiar sound came to justify my fears of an
  interruption. I had taken the precaution to shut the outer oak door when
  Lockhart had entered. But the light from our windows must have been visible
  from without. At any rate, the well known six taps with a
  walking-stick&mdash;in three pairs, like the strokes of a ship's
  bell&mdash;spelled out the name of the visitor who stood on our threshold.
  Accordingly, I rose and threw open the doors, closing them again as the
  superintendent walked in.</p>

  <p>"Now, don't let me disturb any one," exclaimed Miller, observing that, at
  his entrance, Lockhart had risen with the air of taking his departure. "I am
  only a bird of passage. I have just dropped in to collect those documents and
  hear if the doctor has any remarks to make on them."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke walked over to a cabinet, and, unlocking it, took out a small
  bundle of papers which he handed to the superintendent.</p>

  <p>"I can't give a very decided opinion on them," said he. "It is really a
  case for a handwriting expert. All that I can say is that there are none of
  the regular signs of forgery; no indications of tracing or of very deliberate
  writing. The separate words seem to have been written quickly and freely. But
  I got the impression&mdash;it is only an impression&mdash;that there is a
  slight lack of continuity, as if each word had been executed as a separate
  act."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow that," said Miller.</p>

  <p>"I mean," Thorndyke explained, "that&mdash;assuming it, for the moment, to
  be a forgery&mdash;the forger's method might have been, instead of copying
  words continuously from an original, to take one word, copy it two or three
  times so as to get to know it thoroughly, then write it quickly on the
  document and go on to the next word. Written in that way, the words would not
  form such completely continuous lines as if the whole were written at a
  single operation. But you had better get the opinion of a first-class
  expert."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Miller, "I will; and I will tell him what you have
  suggested. And now, I had better take myself off and leave you to your
  conference."</p>

  <p>"You need not run away, Miller," Thorndyke protested, very much to my
  surprise. "There is no conference. Fill up a glass of grog and light a cigar
  like a Christian."</p>

  <p>He indicated the whisky decanter and siphon and the box of cigars, which
  had been offered to, and declined by, Lockhart, and drew up a chair.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, seating himself and selecting a cigar, "if you are
  sure that I am not breaking in on a consultation, I shall be delighted to
  spend half an hour or so in your intellectual society." He thoughtfully mixed
  himself a temperate whisky and soda, and then, with a quizzical glance at
  Thorndyke inquired:</p>

  <p>"Was there any little item of information that you were requiring?"</p>

  <p>"Really, Miller," Thorndyke protested, "you under-estimate your personal
  charms. When I ask for the pleasure of your society, need you look for an
  ulterior motive?"</p>

  <p>Miller regarded me with a crafty smile and solemnly closed one eye.</p>

  <p>"I'm not looking for one," he replied. "I merely asked a question."</p>

  <p>"And I am glad you did," said Thorndyke, "because you have reminded me
  that there was a little matter that I wanted to ask you about."</p>

  <p>Miller grinned at me again. "Ah," he chuckled. "Now we are coming to it.
  What was the question?"</p>

  <p>"It was concerned with a man named Crabbe. Jonathan Crabbe of Hatton
  Garden. Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"He is not a personal friend," Miller replied. "And he is not Mr. Crabbe
  of Hatton Garden just at present. He is Mr. Crabbe of Maidstone jail. What
  did you want to know about him?"</p>

  <p>"Anything that you can tell me. And you needn't mind Mr. Lockhart. He is
  one of the Devil's own, like the rest of us."</p>

  <p>"I know Mr. Lockhart very well by sight and by reputation," said the
  superintendent. "Now, with regard to this man Crabbe. He had a place, as you
  say, in Hatton Garden where he professed to carry on the business of a
  diamond broker and dealer in precious stones. I don't know anything about the
  diamond brokery, but he was a dealer in precious stones all right. That's why
  he is at Maidstone. He got two years for receiving."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember when he was convicted?"</p>

  <p>"I can't give you the exact date off hand," replied Miller. "It wasn't my
  case. I was only an interested onlooker. But it was somewhere about the end
  of last September. Is that near enough?"</p>

  <p>"Quite near enough for my purpose," Thorndyke replied. "Do you know
  anything more about him? Is he an old hand?"</p>

  <p>"There," replied Miller, "you are asking me a question that I can't answer
  with certainty. There were no previous convictions against him, but it was
  clear that he had been carrying on as a fence for a considerable time. There
  was definite evidence of that. But there was another little affair which
  never got beyond suspicion. I looked into that myself; and I may say that I
  was half inclined then to collar the worthy Jonathan. But when we came to
  talk the case over, we came to the conclusion that there was not enough
  evidence and no chance of getting any more. So we put our notes of the case
  into cold storage in the hope that something fresh might turn up some day.
  And I still hope that it may, for it was an important case and we got
  considerable discredit for not being able to spot the chappies who did the
  job."</p>

  <p>"Is there any reason why you should not tell us about the case?" Thorndyke
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, you know," Miller replied, "it was only a case of suspicion,
  though, in my own mind, I feel pretty cock-sure that our suspicions were
  justified. Still, I don't think there would be any harm in my just giving you
  an outline of the case, on the understanding that this is in strict
  confidence."</p>

  <p>"I think you can take that for granted," said Thorndyke. "We are all
  lawyers and used to keeping our own counsel."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Miller, "I will give you a sketch of the case; what we know
  and what I think. It's just possible that you may remember the case as it
  made a good deal of stir at the time. The papers referred to it as 'The
  Billington Jewel Robbery.'"</p>

  <p>"I have just a faint recollection of the affair," Thorndyke replied; "but
  I can't recall any of the details."</p>

  <p>"It was a remarkable case in some respects," Miller proceeded, "and the
  most remarkable feature was the ridiculous softness of the job. Billington
  was a silly fool. He had an important collection of jewellery, which is a
  stupid thing in itself. No man ought to keep in a private house a collection
  of property of such value&mdash;and portable property, too&mdash;as to offer
  a continual temptation to the criminal class. But he did; and what is more,
  he kept the whole lot of jewels in a set of mahogany cabinets that you could
  have opened with a pen-knife. It is astonishing that he went on so long
  without a burglary.</p>

  <p>"However, he got what he deserved at last. He had gone across to Paris, to
  buy some more of the stuff, I believe, when, some fine night, some cracksmen
  dropped in and did the job. It was perfectly simple. They just let themselves
  in, prised the drawers open with a jemmy, cleared them out and went off
  quietly with the whole collection. Nobody knew anything about it until the
  servants came down in the morning and found the drawers all gaping open.</p>

  <p>"Then, of course, there was a rare philaloo. The police were called in and
  our people made a careful inspection of the premises. But it had been such an
  easy job that anybody might have done it. There was nothing that was
  characteristic of any known burglar. But, on taking impressions of the
  jemmy-marks and a few other trifles, we were inclined to connect it with one
  or two other jobs of a similar type in which jewels had been taken. But we
  had not been able to fix those cases on any particular crooks, though we had
  a growing suspicion of two men who were also suspected of receiving. Of those
  two men, one was Jonathan Crabbe and the other was a man named Wingate. So we
  kept those two gentlemen under pretty close observation and made a few
  discreet inquiries. But it was a long time before we could get anything
  definite; and when, at last, we did manage to drop on Mr. Crabbe, it was only
  on a charge of receiving. The Billington job still remained in the air. And
  that's where it is still."</p>

  <p>"And what about Wingate?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he disappeared. Apparently, he rumbled the fact that he was getting a
  bit of attention from the police, and didn't like it. So he cut his
  connection with Crabbe and went away."</p>

  <p>"And have you lost sight of him?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You see, we never had anything against him but his association with
  Crabbe, and that may have been a perfectly innocent business connection. And
  our inquiries seemed to show that he belonged to quite a respectable family,
  and the man, himself, was of a decidedly superior type; a smart, dressy sort
  of fellow with a waxed moustache and an eye-glass. Quite a toff, in fact. The
  only thing about him that seemed at all fishy was the fact that he was using
  an assumed name. But there was not so very much even in that, for we
  ascertained that he had been on the stage for a time, and he had probably
  taken the name of Wingate in preference to his family name, which was rather
  an odd one&mdash;Deodatus Pettigrew."</p>

  <p>"You never traced any of the proceeds of the robbery?" Thorndyke
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"No. Of course, jewellery is often difficult to trace if the stones are
  taken out of their settings and the mounts melted down. But these jewels of
  Billington's ought to have been easier than most to trace, as a good many of
  them were quite unusual and could only have been disguised by re-cutting,
  which would have brought down their value a lot. And there was one that
  couldn't have been disguised at all. I remember the description of it quite
  well. It was rather a famous piece, known as the Jacobite Jewel. It consisted
  principally of a lump of black opal matrix with a fire opal in the centre,
  and on this fire opal was carved a portrait of the Old Pretender, who called
  himself James the Third. I believe there was quite a little history attached
  to it. But the whole collection was rather famous. Billington was
  particularly keen on opals, and I believe that his collection of them was one
  of the finest known."</p>

  <p>"Had you any inkling as to what had become of this loot?" Thorndyke asked.
  "The thieves could hardly have been able to afford to put the whole of it
  away into storage for an indefinite time."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Miller. "They would have had to get rid of the stuff somehow.
  We thought it just possible that there might be some collector behind the
  affair."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "a collector would probably know all about the
  specimens in other collections and particularly a famous piece like this
  Jacobite Jewel. And he would be almost certain to have heard of the robbery.
  It would be a matter of special interest to him."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," said Miller. "But collectors are queer people. Some of them
  are mighty unscrupulous. When a man has got the itch to possess, there is no
  saying what he will not do to gratify it. Some of the rich Americans who have
  made their fortunes by pretty sharp practice, are not above a little sharp
  practice in spending them. And your millionaire collector is dead keen on
  getting something that is unique; something of which he can say that it is
  the only one of its kind in the world. And if it has a history attached to
  it, so much the better. I shouldn't be at all surprised if that Jacobite
  Jewel had been smuggled out of the country together with the great collection
  of opals. It is even possible that Crabbe had negotiated the sale before the
  robbery was committed; but, of course, it is also possible that I may be
  mistaken and that Crabbe may have had nothing to do with the robbery. We are
  all liable to make mistakes."</p>

  <p>Here the superintendent, having come to the end of his story, emptied his
  glass, re-lit his cigar and looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" he exclaimed, "how the time does go when you are enjoying
  intellectual conversation&mdash;especially if it is your own. It's time I
  made a move. No, thank you; not another drop. But, well, yes, I will take
  another of these excellent cigars. You have listened very attentively to my
  yarn, and I hope you have picked up something useful from my chatter."</p>

  <p>"I always pick up something useful from your chatter, as you call it,"
  replied Thorndyke, rising as the superintendent rose to depart; "but on this
  occasion you have given me quite a lot to think about."</p>

  <p>He walked to the door with Miller and even escorted him out on to the
  landing; and meanwhile, I occupied myself in restraining, with exaggerated
  hospitality, a strong tendency on the part of our guest to rise and follow
  the superintendent. For I could not let him go until I had seen what
  Thorndyke's next move was to be.</p>

  <p>The superintendent's narrative had given me a very curious experience, in
  respect of its effect on Lockhart. At first, he had listened with lively
  interest, probably comparing the Billington collection with that of Penrose.
  But presently he began to look distinctly uncomfortable and to steal furtive
  glances at Thorndyke and me. I kept him unobtrusively under observation, and
  Thorndyke, I know, was watching him narrowly, though no one who did not know
  him would have suspected it, and we both observed the change of manner. But
  when Miller mentioned the Jacobite Jewel and went on to describe its
  appearance, the expression on Lockhart's face was unmistakable. It was that
  of a man who has suffered a severe shock.</p>

  <p>Having seen the last of the superintendent, Thorndyke closed both the
  doors and went back to his chair.</p>

  <p>"That was a queer story of Miller's," he remarked, addressing Lockhart.
  "One does not often hear of a receiver including burglary in his
  accomplishments. I am disposed to think that Miller's surmise as to the
  destination of the swag from the Billington robbery is about correct. What do
  you think, Lockhart?"</p>

  <p>"You mean," the latter replied, "that it was smuggled out of the
  country."</p>

  <p>"No," said Thorndyke, "I don't mean that, Lockhart, and you know I don't.
  What I am suggesting is that the Billington opals, including the Jacobite
  Jewel, are, or were, in Penrose's possession; that they were in the cupboard
  in the small room and that you saw them there."</p>

  <p>Lockhart flushed hotly, but he kept his temper, replying with mild
  facetiousness:</p>

  <p>"Now, you know, Thorndyke, it's of no use for you to try the suggesting
  dodge on me. I am a practising barrister, and I have used it too often
  myself. I have told you that I gave an undertaking to Penrose not to discuss
  his collection with anybody; and I intend to honour that undertaking to the
  letter and in the spirit."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Lockhart," Thorndyke rejoined, "we will leave it at that.
  Probably, I should adopt the same attitude if I were in your position, though
  I doubt if I should have given the undertaking. We will let the collection
  go, unless you would consider it admissible to discuss the source of some of
  the things in the big room, which we all saw. The question as to where he got
  some of those things has a direct bearing on the further question as to where
  he is lurking at the present moment."</p>

  <p>"I don't see the connection," said Lockhart, "but if you do, that is all
  that matters. What is it that you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"I should like to know," Thorndyke replied, "what his methods of
  collection are. Has he been in the habit of attending farmhouse auctions, or
  prowling about in labourer's cottages? Or did he get his pieces through
  regular dealers?"</p>

  <p>"As to that," said Lockhart, "I can only tell you what he told me. He
  professed to have discovered many of his treasures in cottage parlours and in
  country inns and elsewhere, and to have practised on quite an extensive scale
  what he called 'resurrectionist activities,' but he was mighty secret about
  the actual localities. My impression is that his explorations were largely
  bunkum. I suspect that the bulk of his collection came from the dealers, and
  particularly from the antique shop that I mentioned to you. In fact, he
  almost admitted as much, for he told me that when his explorations drew a
  blank, he was accustomed to fall back on the Popinjay."</p>

  <p>"The Popinjay?" I repeated.</p>

  <p>"The proprietor of the antique shop was a man named Parrott, but I need
  not say that Penrose never referred to him by that name. He was-always 'our
  psittacoid friend,' or 'Monsieur le Perroquet' or 'the Popinjay.' You will
  even find him referred to in those terms in the catalogue."</p>

  <p>"That is useful to know," said Thorndyke. "I met with some entries
  containing the words, 'Psitt', 'le Perro' and 'Pop' and could make nothing of
  them. Now I realise that they represented purchases from Mr. Parrott. And
  there was an entry, 'Sweeney's resurrection.' That, I suppose, had a similar
  meaning. Do you know who Sweeney is?"</p>

  <p>Lockhart laughed as he replied: "No, I have never heard of him, though I
  remember the entry. The only thing that I feel sure of is that his name is
  not Sweeney. Possibly it is Todd; and he is probably a dealer in antiquities.
  The piece, I remember, is an Anglo-Saxon brooch; and we may guess that Mr.
  Sweeney Todd got it from a Saxon burial ground in the course of some
  unauthorised excavations."</p>

  <p>"That seems likely," said Thorndyke. "I must look up the list of dealers
  in antiquities in the directory and see if I can find out who he is."</p>

  <p>"But does it matter who he is?" asked Lockhart. "If you are trying to
  discover the whereabouts of our elusive friend, I don't quite follow your
  methods."</p>

  <p>"My dear Lockhart," Thorndyke replied, "my methods are of the utmost
  simplicity. I know practically nothing about Penrose, his habits and his
  customs, and I am out to pick up any items of information on the subject that
  I can gather, in the hope that some of them may prove to have some bearing on
  my quest. After all, it is only the ordinary legal method which you yourself,
  are in the habit of practising."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is," Lockhart admitted. "But, fortunately for me, I have
  never had a problem of this kind to deal with. I can't imagine a more
  hopeless task than trying to find a very artful, secretive man who doesn't
  mean to be found."</p>

  <p>At this moment, I heard the sound of a key being inserted in the outer
  door. Then the inner door opened and Polton entered with an apologetic
  crinkle.</p>

  <p>"I have just looked in, sir," he announced, "to see if there is anything
  that you wanted before I go out. I shall be away about a couple of
  hours."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Polton," Thorndyke replied. "No, there is nothing that I shall
  want that I can't get for myself."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke spoke, Lockhart looked round quickly and then stood up,
  holding out his hand.</p>

  <p>"This is a very unexpected pleasure, Mr. Polton," said he. "I didn't know
  that you were a denizen of the Temple; and I was afraid that I had lost sight
  of you for good, now that Parrott's is no more." He shook hands heartily with
  our ingenious friend and explained to us: "Mr. Polton and I are quite old
  acquaintances. He also, was a frequenter of Parrott's establishment, and the
  leading authority on clocks, watches, hallmarks and other recondite
  matters."</p>

  <p>"You speak of Parrott's shop," said Thorndyke, "as a thing of the past. Is
  our psittacoid friend deceased, or has he gone out of business?"</p>

  <p>"Parrott is still to the good, so far as I know," replied Lockhart, "'but
  the business is defunct. I suspect that it was never more than half alive.
  Then poor Parrott had a double misfortune. Penrose, who was by far his best
  customer, disappeared; and then his cabinetmaker&mdash;a remarkably clever
  old man named Tims&mdash;died and could not be replaced. So there was no one
  left to do the restorations which were the mainstay of the business. I was
  sorry to find the shop closed when I came back from my travels on circuit. It
  was quite a loss, wasn't it, Mr. Polton?"</p>

  <p>"It was to me," replied Polton, regretfully. "Many a pleasant and
  profitable hour have I spent in the workshop. To a man who uses his hands, it
  was a liberal education to watch Mr. Tims at work. I have never seen any man
  use wood-working tools as he did."</p>

  <p>With this, Polton wished our guest "Good evening!" and took himself off.
  As the outer door closed, Lockhart asked:</p>

  <p>"If it is not an impertinent question, what is Mr. Polton's connection
  with this establishment? He has always been rather a mystery to me."</p>

  <p>"He is rather a mystery to me," Thorndyke replied, with a laugh. "He says
  that he is my servant. I say that he is my faithful friend and Jervis's.
  Nominally, he is our laboratory assistant and artificer. Actually, since he
  can do or make anything and insists on doing everything that is to be done,
  he is a sort of universal fairy godmother to us both. And, I can assure you
  that he is not unappreciated."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to know that," said Lockhart. "We all&mdash;the frequenters of
  Parrott's, I mean&mdash;held him in the greatest respect, and none more so
  than Penrose."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he knew Penrose, did he?" said I, suddenly enlightened as to Polton's
  interest in our conversations respecting the missing man. "He has never
  mentioned the fact."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you have never given him an opening," Lockhart suggested, not
  unreasonably. "But they were quite well acquainted; in fact, the very last
  time that I saw Penrose, he and Mr. Polton were walking away from the shop
  together, carrying a lantern clock that Mr. Polton had been restoring."</p>

  <p>We continued for some time to discuss Polton's remarkable personality and
  his versatile gifts and abilities, in which Lockhart appeared to be deeply
  interested. At length the latter glanced at his watch and rose.</p>

  <p>"I have made an unconscionably long visit," said he, as he prepared to
  depart; "but it is your fault for making the time pass so agreeably."</p>

  <p>"You certainly have not out-stayed your welcome," Thorndyke replied, "and
  I hope you will stay longer next time."</p>

  <p>With this exchange of civilities, we escorted our guest out to the
  landing, and, having wished him "Good night!" returned to our chamber to
  discuss the events of the evening.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-11"
     id="ch2-11"></a>XI. &mdash; RE-ENTER MR. KICKWEED</h2>

  <p class="first">When I had closed the door and drifted back towards my
  chair, I cast an expectant glance at Thorndyke; but, as he maintained a
  placidly reflective air, and thoughtfully re-filled his pipe in silence, I
  ventured to open the inevitable discussion.</p>

  <p>"May I take it that my revered senior is satisfied with the evening's
  entertainment?"</p>

  <p>"Eminently so," he replied; "in fact, considerably beyond my most sanguine
  expectations. We have made appreciable progress."</p>

  <p>"In what direction?" I asked. "Does Miller's story throw any light on the
  case?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," he answered. "What he told us, in conjunction with what
  Lockhart refused to tell us, seems to help us to this extent; that it appears
  to disclose a motive for the burglary, or the attempt."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that it establishes the probability that there was something
  there worth stealing and that somebody besides Penrose knew of it?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "though that also is true. But, what is in my mind is
  this: When Penrose disappeared, either for good or for some considerable
  time, there arose the probability that, sooner or later, the cupboard in the
  small room would be opened for inspection by Horridge or some other person
  claiming authority. But if that cupboard contained&mdash;as I have no doubt
  it did&mdash;a quantity of stolen property, the identifiable proceeds of a
  known robbery, a very awkward situation would be created."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "it would be awkward for Penrose when Miller caught the
  scent. There would be a hue and cry with a vengeance. And it might be
  unpleasant for Mr. Crabbe if any connection could be traced between him and
  Penrose. I suppose there can be no doubt that the stuff was really
  there?"</p>

  <p>"It is only an inference," Thorndyke replied, "but I am convinced that the
  Billington jewels were in that cupboard and that Lockhart saw them there.
  Everything points to that conclusion. You saw how intensely uncomfortable
  Lockhart looked when Miller described the stolen jewels; and you must have
  noticed that he was perfectly willing to discuss the general collection. From
  which we may reasonably infer that his promise of secrecy referred only to
  the contents of the small room. Besides, if the stolen jewels had not been
  there, or he had not seen them, he would certainly have said so when I
  challenged him. The denial would have been no breach of his promise."</p>

  <p>"No," I agreed, "I think you are right in assuming that he saw them,
  though how Penrose could have been such an idiot as to show them at all is
  beyond my comprehension&mdash;that is, if he knew that they were stolen
  goods, which I gather is your opinion."</p>

  <p>"It is not by any means certain that he did," said Thorndyke. "Evidently
  he is quite ignorant of the things that he collects. The promise may have
  been only a manifestation of his habitual secrecy, accentuated by the
  knowledge that he had acquired the jewels from some rather shady dealer. The
  evidence seems a little contradictory."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said I, "it was a lucky chance that Miller happened to drop
  in this evening. Or wasn't it a chance at all? There was just a suspicion of
  arrangement in the way things fell out. Did you know that Miller would select
  this evening for his call?"</p>

  <p>"In effect, I may say that I did. I had good reason to believe that he
  would call this evening, and, as you suggest, I made my arrangements
  accordingly. But those arrangements did not work out according to plan, for I
  knew nothing of the Billington robbery. Miller's disclosure was a windfall
  and it made the rest of my plan unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"Then what had you proposed to do?"</p>

  <p>"My intention was," Thorndyke replied, "to demonstrate to Lockhart that
  there had been transactions between Crabbe and Penrose. Of course, I could
  have done this without Miller's help, but I thought that if he heard of
  Crabbe's misdeeds from a police officer he would be more impressed and,
  therefore, more amenable to questions. But, as I said, Miller's story did all
  that was necessary."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, "there was a connection between Crabbe and Penrose, and
  that connection was known to you. How did you find that out? And, by the way,
  how did you come by your knowledge of Mr. Crabbe? I had never heard of him
  until you mentioned his name."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled in his exasperating way. "My learned friend is
  forgetting," said he. "Are we not decipherers of cross-word puzzles and
  interpreters of dark sayings?"</p>

  <p>"I am not," said I. "So you may as well come straight to the point."</p>

  <p>"You have not forgotten the scrap of paper with the cryptic inscription
  which was found in the small room?"</p>

  <p>"Ha!" I exclaimed, suddenly recalling the ridiculous inscription, "I
  begin, as Miller would say, to rumble you. But not very completely. The
  inscription read: 'Lobster: hortus petasatus.' But I still don't see how you
  arrived at it. Crabs are not the only crustaceans&mdash;besides
  lobsters."</p>

  <p>"Very true, Jervis," said he. "Lobster is ambiguous as to its possible
  alternatives. Evidently, the more specific character was contained in the
  other term, 'hortus petasatus.' Now, the learned Dr. Smith translates
  petasatus as 'wearing, or having on, a travelling-cap; ready for a journey.'
  But the word 'petasus' means either a cap or a hat, so the adjective,
  petasatus, may be rendered as 'hatted' or 'having a hat on.'"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see," said I, with a sour grin. "So hortus petasatus would be a
  hat on garden. But what puerile balderdash it is. That man, Penrose, ought to
  be certified."</p>

  <p>"Still," said Thorndyke, "you see that it was worth while to study his
  jargon, for, when I had deciphered the inscription so far, the rest of the
  inquiry was perfectly simple. I looked up Hatton Garden in the directory and
  ran through the names of occupants in search of one that seemed related to
  the term 'lobster.' Among them I found the name of Jonathan Crabbe (the only
  one, in fact, who answered the description); and as he was described as a
  diamond broker and dealer in precious stones, I decided that he was probably
  the man referred to by Penrose. Accordingly, I paid a visit to Hatton Garden
  and made a few discreet inquiries, which elicited the fact that Mr. Crabbe
  was absent from his premises and was in some sort of trouble in connection
  with a charge of receiving. Whereupon I made arrangements to give Lockhart a
  shock."</p>

  <p>"And very completely you succeeded," said I. "He is in a deuce of a
  twitter, and well he may be, knowing quite well that he is making himself an
  accessory after the fact."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "he is in a very unpleasant dilemma. But I don't
  think we can interfere, at least for the present. He is a lawyer and knows
  exactly what his position is; and, meanwhile, his reticence suits us well
  enough. I don't want a premature hue and cry raised."</p>

  <p>Here the discussion appeared to have petered out; but it seemed that the
  evening's experiences were not yet finished, for, in the silence which
  followed Thorndyke's rejoinder, there came to my ear the sound of soft and
  rather stealthy footsteps ascending the stairs, and at the same moment I
  suddenly remembered that I had not shut the outer door when we came in after
  seeing Lockhart off.</p>

  <p>The steps continued slowly to ascend. Then they crossed the landing and
  paused opposite our door. There was a brief interval followed by a very
  elaborate flourish, softly and skilfully executed, on the little brass
  knocker of the inner door, very much in the style of the old-fashioned
  footman's knock. I rose, and, striding across the room, threw open the door,
  when my astonished gaze encountered no less a person than Mr. Kickweed. He
  broke out at once into profuse apologies for disturbing us at so untimely an
  hour. "But," he explained, "the matter seemed to me of some importance, and I
  thought it best not to call in the daytime in case you might not wish my
  visit to become known."</p>

  <p>This sounded rather mysterious, so, in accordance with his hint, I closed
  both the doors before ushering him across the room to the chair lately
  vacated by Miller.</p>

  <p>"You needn't be apologetic, Mr. Kickweed," said Thorndyke, as he shook his
  visitor's hand. "It is very good of you to turn out at night to come and see
  us. Sit down and mix yourself a whisky and soda. Will you light a cigar as an
  aid to business discussion?"</p>

  <p>Kickweed declined the refreshments but was obviously gratified by the
  manner of his reception; and, having expressed his thanks, he came at once to
  the object of his visit.</p>

  <p>"I am the bearer of news, sir, which I think you will be glad to hear. I
  have received a letter from Mr. Penrose."</p>

  <p>There did not, to me, appear to be anything particularly surprising in
  this statement. But it was evidently otherwise with Thorndyke, for he
  received the announcement with more astonishment than I had ever known him to
  show; though, even so, it needed my expert and accustomed eye to detect his
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"When did you receive the letter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It came by the first post this morning," Kickweed replied. "I thought you
  would like to know about it, and, perhaps, like to see it, so I have brought
  it along for your inspection."</p>

  <p>He produced from his pocket a bulging letter-case from which he extracted
  a letter in its envelope and handed it to Thorndyke, who took out the letter,
  opened it and read it through. When he had finished the reading, he
  proceeded, according to his invariable custom when dealing with strange
  letters, to scrutinise its various parts, especially the signature and the
  date, to examine the paper, holding it up to the light, and, finally, to make
  a minute inspection of the envelope.</p>

  <p>"The letter, I see," said he, "is dated with yesterday's date but gives no
  address; but the postmark is Canterbury and is dated yesterday afternoon. Do
  you suppose Mr. Penrose is staying at Canterbury?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no, sir," replied Kickweed, "I do not, though he used rather
  frequently to stay there. But, from my knowledge of Mr. Penrose, I don't
  think he would have posted the letter in the town where he was staying.
  Still, he can hardly be far away from there. I think he knows that
  neighbourhood rather well."</p>

  <p>"Does any one else know about this letter?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir. I took it from the letter-box myself, and I have not spoken of
  it to anybody."</p>

  <p>"I think," said Thorndyke, "that Mr. Brodribb ought to be told. In fact I
  think that the letter ought&mdash;with your consent&mdash;to be handed to him
  for safe keeping. You probably realise that it may become of considerable
  legal importance."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I realise that and that it ought to be taken great care of.
  What I proposed was to hand it to you, if you will take custody of it. Of
  course, you will dispose of it as you think best, but I brought it to you
  because you seemed to take a more sympathetic view of poor Mr. Penrose than
  any one else has done. And I may say, sir, that I should be more happy if you
  would keep it in your possession for the present. I shouldn't like it to be
  used to help the police to worry Mr. Penrose by searching in his
  neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mr. Kickweed," said Thorndyke. "I will keep the letter for the
  present on the understanding that it shall be produced only if circumstances
  should arise which would make its production necessary in the interests of
  justice. Do you agree to that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly, sir," replied Kickweed. "You will, of course, make any use
  of it that you think proper and necessary, other than the one I
  mentioned."</p>

  <p>"You may take it," said Thorndyke, "that no attempt will be made by me, or
  with my connivance, to harass Mr. Penrose, and that you may safely leave the
  letter in my custody. And I may say that I am greatly obliged to you for
  letting me have it and for having taken the trouble to report the matter to
  me."</p>

  <p>Kickweed mildly deprecated these acknowledgments, and Thorndyke continued:
  "On reading this letter I am struck by certain peculiarities on which I
  should like to hear your opinion. It is a rather odd letter."</p>

  <p>"It is," Kickweed admitted, "but then you know, sir, Mr. Penrose is a
  rather odd man, if I may venture to say so."</p>

  <p>Here Thorndyke handed me the document and I rapidly read it through. It
  was certainly a very odd letter. Secretly, I pronounced it the letter of a
  born fool or a lunatic, but I made no audible comments. Its precious contents
  were as follows:</p>

  <p>"26th March, 1935.</p>

  <p>"CERASTIUM VULGATUM, ESQ,</p>

  <p>"RESPECTED CER,</p>

  <p>"These presents are to inform you that, some time after my departure from
  Her Deceased Majesty's Equilateral Rectangle, I dish-covered that the key of
  the small room was not in my pocket. Thereupon I reflected, and after
  profound cogitation decided that it must be somewhere else. Peradventure,
  when I sarahed forth on that infelicitous occasion, I may have left it in the
  door, where it may have presented itself to your penetrating vision and been
  taken into protective custardy. This is my surmise; and if I have reason and
  you are now seised or possessed of the said key, I will ask you to convey the
  same to my bank and deliver it into the hand of the manager, in my name, to
  have and to hold until such time as I shall demand it from him. But first,
  fasten the window and lock the door. The room contains nothing but a few
  unconsidered trifles of merely scentimental value, but I wish it to remain
  undisturbed until I shall return carrying my sheaves and ready to do justice
  to the obese calf.</p>

  <p>"Hoping that you are in your usual boisterous spirits</p>

  <p>"Yours in saecula saeculorum,</p>

  <p>"DANIEL PENROSE."</p>

  <p>"You will agree with me, Jervis," said Thorndyke, when I returned the
  document, "that this is a very odd letter?"</p>

  <p>I agreed with him in the most emphatic and unmistakable terms.</p>

  <p>"We are all, by now," he continued, "accustomed to Mr. Penrose's oddities
  of speech. But this seems to go rather beyond even his usual eccentricity.
  What do you think, Mr. Kickweed?"</p>

  <p>"I am disposed to think you are right, sir," replied Kickweed, a little to
  my surprise; for the letter contained just the sort of twaddle that I should
  have expected from Penrose.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Thorndyke, "that you mentioned, when we last met, having
  noticed a gradual change in Mr. Penrose; a growing tendency to oddity and
  obscurity of speech."</p>

  <p>"I think I did say," replied Kickweed, "that the habit of jocularity had
  been growing and becoming more confirmed. But habits usually do tend to grow,
  and I don't know that he was changed in any other respect. And as to this
  letter, we must bear the circumstances in mind. He is probably very much
  upset and he may have been a little more facetious than usual by way of
  keeping up his spirits."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "that has to be considered. But a tendency to
  increasing eccentricity is a very significant thing, especially in the case
  of a man who has rather unaccountably disappeared. Any recent change in Mr.
  Penrose's mental condition might have an important bearing on his recent
  conduct, and I am inclined to believe that there has been some such change.
  Now, take this letter. Is it the kind of letter that you have been in the
  habit of receiving from him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no, sir," Kickweed admitted. "He did not often have occasion to
  write to me, and when he did, his letters were usually quite short and to the
  point. They were not written in a jocular vein."</p>

  <p>"In this letter," Thorndyke continued, "he addresses you by the style and
  title of Cerastium Vulgatum, Esq. Has he ever done that before?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; and it doesn't convey much to me now."</p>

  <p>"Cerastium vulgatum," said Thorndyke, "is the botanical name of the common
  chickweed."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," said Kickweed, with a sad and rather disapproving smile. "I
  supposed it was some kind of a joke, but I did not connect it with my
  somewhat unfortunate name."</p>

  <p>"Has Mr. Penrose ever before made any kind of joke on your surname?"
  Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," Kickweed replied, promptly and emphatically. "Mr. Penrose has
  his oddities, but he is a gentleman, and in all his dealings with me he has
  always been scrupulously correct and courteous. I am almost disposed to think
  that you may be right, sir, after all, in believing that his troubles have
  affected his mind."</p>

  <p>Evidently, the botanical joke had produced a profoundly unfavourable
  impression.</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Thorndyke, "have you delivered the key to the bank
  manager?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," replied Kickweed. "Of course, I must carry out Mr. Penrose's
  instructions, but I don't at all like the idea of having a locked
  room&mdash;possibly containing valuable property&mdash;with no means of
  access in case of an emergency."</p>

  <p>"No," said Thorndyke, "it is a bad and unsafe arrangement. I suppose you
  have kept the key in your own possession?"</p>

  <p>"Always," was the reply, "excepting on one occasion when I let Mr.
  Horridge have it for a few minutes to examine the window of the room. I was
  just going out to post a letter when he asked for it, and he gave it back to
  me when I returned from the post."</p>

  <p>"I certainly think," said Thorndyke, "that you ought to have the means of
  access to that room. Do you happen to have the key about you?"</p>

  <p>By way of reply, Kickweed thrust his fingers into his waistcoat pocket and
  withdrew them holding a key, which he held out to Thorndyke, who took it from
  him and inspected it.</p>

  <p>"An extraordinarily simple key," he remarked, "for the lock of so
  important a room. It looks very like the key of my office cupboard. Would you
  mind if I tried it in the lock?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," replied Kickweed; whereupon Thorndyke bore the key
  away to the office, the door of which he closed after him; a proceeding that
  somehow associated itself in my mind with the idea of moulding wax. In a
  couple of minutes he returned, and, handing the key back to Kickweed,
  announced:</p>

  <p>"It fits the lock quite fairly; which is not surprising as it is of quite
  a common pattern. But it is a fortunate circumstance, for now, if the need
  should arise, I could supply you with a key that would open the small room
  door."</p>

  <p>"That is very kind of you, sir," said Kickweed, "and I will bear your
  offer in mind. And now I mustn't detain you any longer. It is exceedingly
  good of you to have given me so much of your time."</p>

  <p>With this he rose, and once more declining our offer of refreshment, took
  up his hat and stick and was duly escorted out on to the landing. When he had
  gone, and we were once more within closed doors, I delivered myself of a
  matter that had rather puzzled me.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be something a little queer about that key. You haven't
  forgotten that Horridge had it&mdash;or a duplicate&mdash;in his possession
  when he showed us the small room?"</p>

  <p>"I remember that he had a key," replied Thorndyke; "and the feeble and
  clumsy efforts that he made to keep it out of sight made me suspect that it
  was a duplicate. Now we know that it was."</p>

  <p>"I presume that you took a squeeze of Kickweed's key?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "and I shall ask Polton to make a key from the pattern.
  If it is good enough for Horridge to have a duplicate, it is good enough for
  us to have one, too."</p>

  <p>"Why do you suppose Horridge had his made?"</p>

  <p>"It is difficult to say. Horridge, as you observed, is convinced that the
  mysterious cupboard contains something of enormous value&mdash;which it
  undoubtedly did at one time, and may still&mdash;and he is highly suspicious
  of Kickweed. He may want to try the cupboard lock at his leisure, or he may
  simply want to see that Kickweed does not. I doubt whether he has any very
  definite purpose."</p>

  <p>"You seem," said I, "to be pretty confident that the Billington jewels
  were in that cupboard and that they are not there now. Have you formed an
  opinion as to who the burglar was?"</p>

  <p>"We haven't much to go on," he replied. "We know that Crabbe could not
  have been the man, as he was in prison when the burglary occurred; and we
  know&mdash;or may fairly assume&mdash;that the Chubb key was in Penrose's
  possession. Those are all the facts that we have, and they lead to no certain
  conclusion. But now we have another problem to consider."</p>

  <p>"You mean that idiot Penrose's letter. But what is its importance, apart
  from the internal evidence that the writer is certainly a fool and possibly a
  lunatic?"</p>

  <p>"That is precisely what we have to discover. How important is it? Perhaps
  we had better begin with the obituary columns of The Times."</p>

  <p>We did not keep a complete file of The Times on account of its enormous
  bulk, but it was our custom to retain our copies for three months, which
  usually answered our purpose. And it did on this occasion; for, on opening
  the file and scanning the obituary columns, we presently came upon a notice
  announcing that Oliver Penrose passed away peacefully in his sleep on the
  16th of March, a few days before his ninetieth birthday.</p>

  <p>"There," said Thorndyke, carefully replacing the papers and closing the
  file, "you have the answer to our question. Penrose's letter is
  dated&mdash;and was posted&mdash;ten days after his father's death. That is a
  fact of cardinal importance. It anticipates any possible question of
  survivorship. If Penrose should never be heard of again; if he should die and
  neither the time nor place of his death should ever be known, this letter
  could be produced as decisive proof that he was alive ten days after his
  father's death. Its immediate effect is to enable Brodribb to deal with
  Oliver's estate. If there is a will, it can be proved and administered; if
  there is no will, the intestacy proceedings can be set going."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "it is a mighty important letter in spite of its ridiculous
  contents, and its arrival will be hailed with profound relief by Brodribb.
  But it is a remarkably opportune letter, too. Doesn't it strike you as rather
  singularly opportune?"</p>

  <p>"It does," he replied. "That is what immediately impresses one. So much so
  that one asks oneself whether its arrival can be no more than a
  coincidence."</p>

  <p>"To me," said I, "it suggests that Penrose is not such a fool as his
  letter would imply. He has been keeping his eye on the obituary columns of
  The Times, and, when he read the notice of the old gentleman's death, he made
  a pretext to write to Kickweed and thus put it on record that he was alive.
  That is how it strikes me. And that view is supported by the letter, itself.
  It was a perfectly unnecessary letter. Kickweed had had the key for months
  and there was no reason why he should not have continued to keep it, and
  every reason why he should. It looks as if the key had been a mere pretext
  for writing a letter. Don't you agree with me?"</p>

  <p>"I do," he replied, "so far as the character of the letter is concerned.
  But we have to remember that when Penrose went away, his father was quite
  well, so that there was no need for him to watch the obituary columns.
  However, this is all rather speculative. The material fact is that the letter
  has arrived, and that fact will have to be communicated to Brodribb. I shall
  take the letter round and show it to him to-morrow morning."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-12"
     id="ch2-12"></a>XII. &mdash; MR. ELMHURST</h2>

  <p class="first">Between Thorndyke and me there existed a rather queer
  convention, which the reader of this narrative may have noticed. In the cases
  on which we worked together, he was always most scrupulous in keeping me
  informed as to the facts, and making me, if possible, a partner in the
  investigation by which they were ascertained. But he expected me to make my
  own inferences. Any attempt of mine to elicit from him a statement of
  opinion, or of his interpretation of the facts that were known to us both,
  met with the inevitable response: "My dear fellow, you know as much about the
  case as I do, and you have only to make use of your excellent reasoning
  faculties to extract the significance of what is known to us." The convention
  had been established when I first joined Thorndyke as his partner or
  understudy, as part of my training in the art and science of medico-legal
  investigation. But, apparently, my education was to continue indefinitely,
  for Thorndyke's attitude continued unchanged. He would tell me everything
  that he knew, but he was uncommunicative, even to secretiveness, as to what
  he thought.</p>

  <p>But a habit of secretiveness sets up certain natural reactions. If
  Thorndyke would not tell me what he thought, it was admissible for me to find
  out, if I could; and I occasionally got quite a useful hint by observing the
  books that he was reading. For, unlike most lawyers, he dealt comparatively
  little in legal literature. His peculiar type of practice demanded a wide
  range of knowledge other than legal; and frequently it happened that his
  knowledge required amplification on some particular point. But, by observing
  the direction in which he was seeking to enlarge his knowledge, I was able,
  at least, to judge which of the facts seemed to him the most significant.</p>

  <p>Now, I had noticed, of late, the appearance in our chambers of a number of
  books on prehistoric archaeology, a subject in which, so far as I knew,
  Thorndyke was not specially interested. There was, for instance, Jessup's
  Archeology of Kent, into which I dipped lightly; and there was a copy of the
  Archaeological Journal, containing a paper by Stuart Piggott on the
  "Neolithic Pottery of the British Isles." In this a slip of paper had been
  inserted as a book-mark, and, on opening it, I found that it was marked at
  the section headed "Pottery of the Windmill Hill Type," and opposite, a page
  of drawings representing the characteristic forms of vessels and their
  decorative markings. And there were others of different characters, but all
  agreeing in giving descriptions and illustrations of neolithic pottery.</p>

  <p>From these facts it was evident to me that Thorndyke's attention was still
  occupied by the ridiculous fragment of pottery that we had found in the
  pocket of Penrose's raincoat; and the object of his researches was, I had no
  doubt, the discovery of some likely place from which that fragment might have
  come. But why he wished to discover that place or what light it would throw,
  if found, on the present whereabouts of Daniel Penrose, I was utterly unable
  to imagine. That the question was one of importance I did not doubt for a
  moment. Thorndyke was not in the least addicted to the finding of mares'
  nests or the pursuit of that interesting phenomenon, the Will-of-the-Wisp. He
  wanted to discover the place which had been the starting-point of that wild
  journey in the motor car. Therefore, the identity of that place had some
  profound significance; and for several days I continued, at intervals, to
  cudgel my brains in a vain effort to reason out its bearing on our quest.</p>

  <p>About a week after the receipt of the mysterious letter from Mr. Penrose,
  our inquiry entered on a new stage. Hitherto, Thorndyke's attitude had been
  mainly that of a passive observer. The visit to Queen Square, the examination
  of the coat and the pottery fragment, and the unearthing of Mr. Crabbe were
  the only instances of anything like active investigation. Otherwise, he had
  listened to the reports from Brodribb, Miller and Lockhart, and, while he
  had, no doubt, turned them over thoroughly in his mind, had made no positive
  move. But now he showed signs of a kind of activity which I associated, by
  the light of experience, with a definite objective.</p>

  <p>I became aware of the change when, on a certain evening, coming home after
  a long day's work, I found a visitor seated by the fire, apparently in close
  consultation with Thorndyke. A glance at the little table with the decanter,
  wine glasses and box of cigars told me that he was certainly a welcome and
  probably an invited guest; and a sheet of the six-inch ordnance map, on which
  lay the pottery fragment, hinted at the nature of the consultation.</p>

  <p>The visitor, who rose as I entered, was a young man of grave and studious
  aspect, whose face&mdash;adorned with an impressive pair of tortoise-shell
  rimmed spectacles&mdash;seemed familiar, but yet I could not place him until
  Thorndyke came to my aid.</p>

  <p>"You haven't forgotten Mr. Elmhurst, surely, Jervis?" said he.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I haven't," I replied, as we shook hands. "You are the dene
  hole gentleman and the discoverer of headless corpses."</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmhurst did not repudiate the dene hole, but protested that he had
  not actually made a habit of discovering headless corpses, at least in the
  recent state. "The corpses that come my way," he explained, "are usually
  prehistoric corpses, in which the presence or absence of the head is of no
  special significance."</p>

  <p>"In short," said Thorndyke, "Mr. Elmhurst is an archaeologist who is
  kindly allowing us to benefit by his special knowledge, as we did in the case
  of the dene hole."</p>

  <p>"That," said Elmhurst, "is very nicely put, but it gives me undeserved
  credit. I am not an altruist at all. I am agreeing to do something that I
  have long wanted to do, but have been deterred by the cost. But now Dr.
  Thorndyke wants this thing done and is prepared to bear the expense, or at
  least part of it. You see, it is a case of enlightened self-interest on both
  sides."</p>

  <p>"And what is this job?" I asked. "Something in the resurrection line, I
  suspect."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Elmhurst, "it is an excavation. The doctor has here a fragment
  of what seems to have been a neolithic pot of the Windmill Hill type, as it
  is usually described. He thinks it possible that this fragment was found in a
  certain long barrow in Kent. I don't know why he thinks so, but it is not
  improbable that he is right. At any rate, if that barrow contains any
  pottery, it is pretty certain to be of this type."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't carry you very far," said I. "Supposing you found some
  pottery of this kind in the barrow, would that enable you to say that this
  fragment must have come from that barrow?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "It would only enable one to say that this fragment was
  of the same type as that it found in the barrow."</p>

  <p>"But you know that already," said I.</p>

  <p>"Believe," Elmhurst corrected.</p>

  <p>"You said it was pretty certain to be of this type; and if you would
  repeat that on oath in the witness-box, I should think it would be
  sufficient. The excavation seems to be unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't say that!" exclaimed Elmhurst. "You would degrade me from the
  rank of an investigator to that of a mere expert witness."</p>

  <p>"My learned friend," said Thorndyke, "in spite of his great experience in
  court, seems to fail to appreciate the vast difference, in their effects on a
  jury, between an expert opinion&mdash;and a qualified one at that&mdash;and a
  pair of exhibits which the expert can declare, and the jury can see for
  themselves, are identically similar."</p>

  <p>"Still," I persisted, "even if you could prove them to be identically
  similar, that would not be evidence that they came from the same barrow. You
  admit that, Elmhurst?"</p>

  <p>"I admit nothing," he replied. "You know more about evidence than I do.
  But Dr. Thorndyke wants that barrow excavated and I want to do the
  excavation. And I may say that all the necessary preliminaries have been
  arranged. As the barrow is scheduled as an ancient monument, I have had to
  apply for, and have been granted by the Office of Works, a permit authorising
  me to excavate and examine the interior of the tumulus situated by the river
  Stour near Chilham in Kent and commonly known as Julliberrie's Grave."</p>

  <p>"Whose grave?" I demanded with suddenly-aroused interest; for as he
  pronounced the name there flashed instantly into my mind the words of
  Penrose's ridiculous entry: "Moulin-a-vent; Julie: Polly."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst cast a quick, inquisitive glance at me and then proceeded to
  explain:</p>

  <p>"Julliberrie's. There is a local tradition that the mound is the
  burial-place of a more or less mythical person named Jul Laber, or Julaber,
  said to have been either a witch or a giant. If he was a giant we may be able
  to confirm that tradition, but I am afraid that a witch&mdash;in the fossil
  state&mdash;would defy diagnosis."</p>

  <p>"And has this mound never been excavated, so far as you know?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"It was excavated tentatively," he replied, "in 1702 by Heneage Finch,
  whose report is extant; but it appears that nothing was found beyond a few
  animal bones. Then an aerial photograph, taken only a week or two ago, shows
  signs of some more recent disturbance of the surface. Apparently some one has
  been doing a little unauthorised digging, which may account for this fragment
  of the doctor's. But still, we hope to find the burial chamber intact."</p>

  <p>I reflected on the possible means by which Thorndyke had managed to locate
  this barrow and once more speculated on his inexplicable interest in this
  locality. And then suddenly I recalled Penrose's mysterious letter and the
  postmark on it.</p>

  <p>"You say," said I, "that this mound is near Chilham. Isn't that somewhere
  in the Canterbury district?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "Quite near. Not more than half a dozen miles from
  Canterbury."</p>

  <p>This began to be a little more understandable, though I was still unable
  to make out exactly what was in Thorndyke's mind. But I now had something
  like a clue which I could consider at my leisure; and meanwhile I returned to
  the subject of the excavation.</p>

  <p>"I gather," said I, "that you are practically ready to begin operations.
  Is the date of the expedition fixed?"</p>

  <p>"That is what we were discussing when you came in," replied Elmhurst. "Of
  course, there is no need for the doctor or you to attend the function. I can
  let you know if any pottery is found, and produce it for your inspection. But
  I hope you will both be able to come at least once while the work is in
  progress. One doesn't often get the chance of seeing a complete excavation of
  a virtually intact long barrow. If you can only make one visit, I would
  recommend you to wait until we are ready to expose the burial chamber. That
  is the most thrilling moment."</p>

  <p>"It sounds like quite a big job," I remarked. "How long do you think it
  will take?"</p>

  <p>"I should say from three to four weeks," he replied.</p>

  <p>"My word!" I exclaimed. "Four weeks! Why, it will cost a small fortune. Of
  course, you will have to employ a gang of labourers."</p>

  <p>"We shall want five men," said he, "in addition to the volunteers, and I
  reckon that sixty pounds will cover it easily."</p>

  <p>I whistled. "I suspect, Thorndyke," said I, "that you will have to find
  that sixty pounds yourself. You won't get Brodribb to include archaeological
  researches in the costs. But do you tell me, Elmhurst, that this colossal
  work is necessary just to find out what sort of pottery there is in the
  barrow?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," he replied. "But, you see, the position is this:
  Julliberrie's Grave is scheduled as an Ancient Monument. No one
  may&mdash;lawfully&mdash;disturb it without a permit from the Office of
  Works. Now, they are perfectly willing to grant a permit to genuine
  archaeologists who are known to them as such, but subject to very rigorous
  conditions. They won't grant permits for mere casual digging. Their
  conditions are that, if you want to excavate, you must excavate completely
  and exhaustively so that the mound need never be touched again. All finds
  must be preserved and labelled and a detailed account of the excavation must
  be published; and when the work is finished, the barrow must be restored
  completely to its original condition. I explained all this to the
  doctor."</p>

  <p>I must confess that I was staggered. The means seemed to be so
  disproportionate to the end. But Thorndyke seemed quite satisfied to pay
  sixty pounds for a few specimens of pottery and Elmhurst made no secret of
  his unholy joy at the prospect of a first-class "dig."</p>

  <p>"Are you proposing to take part in this super-resurrection, Thorndyke?" I
  asked sourly.</p>

  <p>"I am not proposing to join the diggers," he replied, "but I shall take
  the opportunity to see how a thorough excavation is done. I want to see the
  burial chamber opened, but I am also rather curious to see how the work is
  begun, and what the barrow looks like when the turf is removed and the mound
  exposed as it appeared when it was newly made. When do you reckon that you
  will have the barrow uncovered?"</p>

  <p>"I expect," Elmhurst replied, "that we shall begin skinning off the turf
  on Thursday. We start operations, as I told you, on Tuesday morning, and
  there will be a full two days' work on the preliminaries&mdash;pegging out
  the site, putting up an enclosing fence and preparing the dumps. I think, if
  you come down on Thursday&mdash;not too early&mdash;I can promise you that
  you will see the barrow as its builders saw it. I could, if you liked, meet
  you at Maidstone or Canterbury and personally conduct you to the scene of the
  operations."</p>

  <p>"That isn't necessary," said Thorndyke. "We have the map, and you will
  want to be early at work. Moreover, I think I shall take the opportunity to
  do some prospecting on my way and I may be a little late in arriving at the
  barrow."</p>

  <p>"That will be all to the good," said Elmhurst. "The later you arrive the
  more we shall have ready to show you."</p>

  <p>This brought the discussion on ways and means to an end; and shortly
  afterwards our guest, having a train to catch, rose and took his leave.</p>

  <p>During the week that intervened, very little was said either by Thorndyke
  or me on the subject of the expedition. Not that I was not keenly interested;
  for Thorndyke's reference to his "prospecting" intentions made it clear to me
  that he had something in his mind beyond the mere search for pottery. It
  seemed that now, for the first time, he was going to take some active
  measures to locate the elusive Penrose. But I asked no questions. I was going
  to take part in the prospecting operations and I hoped that their nature
  would throw some light on the methods by which Thorndyke proposed to attempt
  what looked like an impossibility.</p>

  <p>One discovery I made, however; which was that Polton had in some way
  managed to attach himself to the expeditionary force. The fact was revealed
  to me when I found him in the act of pasting a couple of sheets of the
  six-inch ordnance map on thin mounting board. Observing that one of them
  included Chilham and our tumulus on Julliberrie Downs, I ventured to make
  inquiries.</p>

  <p>"Why are you mounting them, Polton?" I asked. "You are not proposing to
  frame them and hang them on the wall?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," he replied. "When they are dry, I am going to cut them up into
  sections nine inches by six, that is four sections to a sheet. Then I shall
  number them and make a case to carry them in. You see, sir, a map is awkward
  to carry, even if you fold it, and most inconvenient to use out of doors if
  there is any wind. But by this method you can just take out the one or two
  sections that you are using, and the whole lot will go easily into my
  poacher's pocket, or the doctor's either, for that matter. I'm getting them
  ready for our little trip next Thursday."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said I, "you are coming with us, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," he replied, with a complacent crinkle. "The doctor mentioned
  to me that he was going down into Kent on some sort of exploring job, so I
  persuaded him to let me come and lend a hand. I understood him to say that
  they were going to dig up that old grave that is marked on the
  map&mdash;Julliberrie's Grave."</p>

  <p>"That is quite correct, Polton," I assured him.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said he, with a crinkle of ghoulish satisfaction. "That will be very
  interesting. Do you happen to know when the party was buried?"</p>

  <p>"I understand," I replied, "that the burial took place at some time from
  four to ten thousand years ago."</p>

  <p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Polton. "Ten thousand years! Well, well! I
  should have thought that if he has been there as long as that they might have
  let him stay there. There can't be much of him left."</p>

  <p>"That is what we are going to find out," said I; and with this I retired,
  leaving him to his pasting and his reflections.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-13"
     id="ch2-13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE TRACK OF THE FUGITIVE</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the course of my long association with Thorndyke, I had
  often been impressed by the number of things that he appeared to carry in his
  pockets. He reminded me somewhat of The White Knight. But there was this
  essential difference; that whereas that unstable equestrian was visibly
  encumbered with a raffle of things that he could never possibly want,
  Thorndyke was invisibly provided with the things that he did want. If the
  need arose for any instrument, appliance or material, forthwith the
  desiderated object was produced from his pocket even as the parlour magician
  produces the required guinea-pig or goldfish. So, after all, the appearances
  may have been illusory; they may have been due, not to the gross quantity of
  things carried, but to an accurate prevision of the probable
  requirements.</p>

  <p>The matter is recalled to my mind by the astonishing stowage capacity that
  Polton developed on the morning of our expedition to Chilham. Not only did
  the special outfit for the day's work&mdash;six-inch map, one-inch map,
  prismatic compass, telescope, surveyor's tape and other oddments, laid out
  for Thorndyke's inspection&mdash;vanish into unsuspected pockets, leaving no
  trace, but, as appeared later, his lading included a substantial meal, a big
  flask of sherry and a nest of aluminium drinking cups. And even then he
  didn't bulge perceptibly.</p>

  <p>Of the details of our travels on that day I have but a confused
  recollection. It was all very well for Thorndyke, who had apparently
  transferred the six-inch map bodily to his consciousness; he knew exactly
  where he was at any given moment. But to me, when once we had left the plain
  high road, all sense of direction was lost and I was aware only of a
  bewildering succession of abominably steep lanes, cart-tracks and footpaths,
  which we scrambled up or stumbled down until we became finally and hopelessly
  submerged in a wood.</p>

  <p>However, I will make an effort to give an intelligible account of this
  "prospecting" expedition, with apologies in advance for the somewhat nebulous
  topography. From Charing Cross we proceeded uneventfully to Ashford, where we
  got out of the train and took our places in a motor omnibus which was lurking
  in the vicinity and which was bound for Canterbury. Apparently it had been
  awaiting the arrival of the train, for as soon as we and one or two other
  train passengers had settled ourselves, the conductor, having taken a last
  fond look at the station, gave the signal to the driver, who thereupon
  started the vehicle with a triumphant hoot.</p>

  <p>We rumbled along the main road for about six miles (as I afterwards
  ascertained) and then, shortly after crossing a small river, drew up at a
  village which the conductor announced as Godmersham. Here we got out and
  walked forward until we came to the cross-roads beyond the village, where
  Thorndyke turned to the right and led the way along the by-road. Presently we
  passed under a railway line and then, as the road made a sharp turn to the
  right, followed it along the bottom of a valley nearly parallel to the
  railway. About half a mile farther on, another by-road led off to the left,
  and, as Thorndyke turned off into it, my sense of direction began to get
  somewhat confused. It was quite a good road and fairly level, but its
  windings made it difficult to keep a "dead reckoning," and when, half a mile
  along it, yet another by-road led off from it to the left at right
  angles&mdash;into which Thorndyke turned confidently&mdash;and then made a
  right-angle turn to the right, I abandoned all attempts to keep count of our
  direction.</p>

  <p>Along this road we trudged for three-quarters of a mile, still keeping
  fairly on the level, but then the ground began to rise sharply and the road
  zig-zagged more than ever. A mile or so farther on we passed through a
  village, and I found myself casting a slightly wistful glance at a couple of
  rustics who were seated on a bench outside the inn, sustaining themselves
  with beer and conversation. But Thorndyke plodded on relentlessly, and when,
  a few hundred yards beyond the village, we came to yet another cross-roads,
  he finished me off by taking the turning to the left.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Thorndyke," said I, when we had toiled up this road for about
  half a mile and he halted to look around, "you know where you are."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," he replied. "That village that we passed through just now is
  Sole Street. I will show you on the map where we are. Let us have the
  six-inch, Polton."</p>

  <p>The latter dived into the interior of his clothing, whence he produced the
  case of mounted sections and handed it to his principal.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," said Thorndyke, when he had picked out the appropriate
  card. "That is the village at the bottom and this is the road we are on. You
  see that it peters out, more or less, when it enters the wood."</p>

  <p>I compared the section of map with the visible objects and was able to
  identify a farm-house across the fields on our right and a considerable wood
  which we were approaching.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "it is clear enough so far, though it doesn't mean much to
  me. What is the significance of that pencilled cross by the roadside?"</p>

  <p>"That," he replied, "marks the spot, as nearly as I could locate it from
  the evidence at the inquest, where the old woman was killed."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" I exclaimed. "So this is where the chapter of accidents began,
  or, at least, a few yards farther up. Then I may assume that the purpose of
  this prospecting expedition is to retrace the route of Penrose's car?"</p>

  <p>"That is so," he admitted; "and presently we must begin to look for
  traces. At the moment, we don't need them, as there seems to be no doubt that
  the car came down this road. It was seen&mdash;or, at least, a car was
  seen&mdash;to come flying round the corner into the village and past the inn.
  Of course, it may not have been Penrose's car. But the time, the outrageous
  speed, and the wild manner in which it was being driven, all seem to connect
  it with the disaster."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "even if it was the car that killed the woman, that is
  no evidence that it was Penrose's car. It seems to me that the argument
  against Penrose moves in a circle. Penrose is proved to have killed the old
  woman by the fact that he was on the road where she was killed; and he is
  proved to have been on that road by the fact that he killed the old woman. I
  respectfully suggest that my learned senior may probably be tracing,
  laboriously and with characteristic skill, the movements of a motor car in
  which we are not interested at all."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled appreciatively. "Admirably argued, Jervis; and the
  point that you make is clearly realised by the police. There is very little
  doubt that it was Penrose's car, but there is no positive evidence that it
  was. And the police know, and we know, that you can't secure a conviction on
  mere probabilities. That is a further purpose of the prospecting expedition;
  not only to ascertain which way, and from whence, the car was travelling, but
  also, if possible, to establish what car it was."</p>

  <p>As we continued to toil upwards towards the wood, I cogitated on this
  statement with considerable surprise. It seemed inconsistent with what I had
  supposed to be Thorndyke's object and especially with his assurance to
  Kickweed that no action was contemplated which might compromise Penrose or
  menace his safety. Yet here he was, by his own admission, industriously
  searching for the one missing item of evidence which could secure Penrose's
  conviction. Unless, indeed, he had any reason to believe that the wrong car
  had been identified; which his words did not in the least suggest.
  Incidentally, I was utterly unable to imagine how he proposed to identify a
  car which had passed down the road months ago, or even pick up its tracks.
  The road was extraordinarily unfrequented. We had met not a single car, and
  only one farm cart, since we had passed under the railway. But still it was a
  metalled road, showing only slight traces of the carts and wagons that had
  passed over it; and obviously none of those traces had anything to tell
  us.</p>

  <p>When we entered the wood, I noticed that Thorndyke kept a close watch on
  the borders of the road though he did not slacken his pace.</p>

  <p>"I presume," said I, "that you are looking for the tracks of the car. But
  isn't that rather hopeless, seeing that it is about six months since Penrose
  passed down this road&mdash;if he ever did actually pass down it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," he replied, "it would be futile to look for tracks on the
  road, or even on the margins. But what I am looking for&mdash;though I don't
  expect to find it here&mdash;is some sign of a car having driven or backed
  off the road into the wood and along one of the footpaths. The marks made by
  a car entering the wood over the soft soil would be deep and they would
  remain visible for years. Moreover, they would be unique. They would not be
  confused with other tracks, as in the case of any kind of road."</p>

  <p>"You have reasons, then, for believing that Penrose backed his car into
  the wood?"</p>

  <p>"We have reasons, Jervis," he replied. "You saw the car and the dead
  leaves and earth on the wheels; and you will remember that the earth was of
  the same type as the surface soil here; a loam of the Thanet Sands type.
  Besides, there is the fact that, if Penrose was engaged, as the evidence
  suggests, in digging in the barrow, he must have left the car somewhere. But
  it appeared at the inquest that nobody had seen the car until it passed
  through Sole Street."</p>

  <p>"There isn't much in that," said I. "We seem to have this tract of country
  all to ourselves. A car might remain parked by the side of this road for
  hours without being noticed."</p>

  <p>He admitted the truth of this, "but," he added, "don't forget the state of
  the car, or the fact that Penrose was engaged in an unlawful act."</p>

  <p>"And have you any idea," I asked, "where the car was probably left?"</p>

  <p>"I have settled on a spot which seems likely," he replied. "But it is
  little more than a guess; and if I am wrong we shall have to give up the
  quest. We can't search the whole area of woodland."</p>

  <p>Half a mile farther on, we came to a fork in the road, the left-hand
  branch being little more than a cart-track. Into this Thorndyke turned
  unhesitatingly; and by the care with which he scrutinised the margins, I
  judged that we were approaching the "likely spot." But the issue was rather
  confused by the fact that the rough, unmetalled road was fairly deeply
  rutted, having evidently been used by various carts and wagons. This road,
  however, after crossing a considerable open space, took a sharp, right-angle
  turn to the left opposite a pair of cottages, but its original direction was
  continued by a broad footpath. Thorndyke first followed the road in its new
  direction where it entered and crossed a narrow strip of wood, but, after a
  careful examination of the ruts in the wood, he came back and explored the
  footpath. And here it was that we struck the first trace of what might have
  been a car-track.</p>

  <p>The footpath passed along the front of the cottages, still in the open,
  but presently it skirted the edge of the wood. It was an old path, never
  disturbed by the plough, and its surface was trodden down hard by years of
  use. Moreover, its margins showed faint impressions of wheels, which had been
  nearly obliterated by the feet of the wayfarers who had walked over them.</p>

  <p>"They don't look to me like the tracks of a car," I remarked as we all
  stooped to examine them.</p>

  <p>"No," he agreed, taking a rough measurement with his stick. "The gauge is
  much too wide. Probably they are the tracks of some woodman's cart or
  timber-carriage. But a hard path like this would scarcely show an impression
  of a pneumatic tire excepting after heavy rain."</p>

  <p>We continued our progress slowly for another hundred yards, keeping a
  close watch on the faint ruts beside the path. Then we all halted
  simultaneously. For here we could see the faint, but clearly distinguishable,
  tracks of some wheeled vehicle which had turned off the path on to the rough
  turf of the open field.</p>

  <p>"This looks more likely," I remarked; and Polton supported me with the
  opinion that "the Doctor's got him this time, as I knew he would."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke made no comment but, producing from his pocket a steel tape,
  carefully measured the space between the wheel-marks.</p>

  <p>"The measurement is correct," he announced, "but that is only an
  agreement. It would apply to thousands of other cars. However, we will see
  whither these tracks lead us."</p>

  <p>We followed the tracks, not without difficulty, across the wide meadow
  until we readied another belt of woodland. Here the tracks entered the wood
  by a footpath and were easy enough to follow on the soft earth. The path
  continued for about a furlong and then emerged into the open, where it
  crossed a small grass-covered space; and, following it, we were still able to
  distinguish the wheel-tracks by its sides. When it reached the edge of the
  wood, the footpath turned sharply to the right, keeping in the open. But here
  the tracks left the path and plunged straight into the wood, which was fairly
  free from undergrowth. Following the comparatively deep ruts which the wheels
  had made in the soft leaf-mould, we advanced by a rather tortuous route about
  a couple of hundred yards into the wood. And then, once more, we halted; for
  we had apparently come to the end of the tracks.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be no doubt about it; but, as the last year's leaves lay
  here more deeply, and the undergrowth had suddenly grown denser, I went on a
  few yards to make sure that the tracks did not reappear beyond the place
  where they had seemed to end. With difficulty I forced my way through the
  bushes and was further impeded by the brambles and spreading roots; and I had
  not gone more than a few yards when my foot was caught by some hard, angular
  object&mdash;obviously not a root or a bramble&mdash;whereby, after
  staggering forward a pace or two, I fell sprawling among the tangle of
  vegetation.</p>

  <p>At the sound of the fall, and the accompanying pious ejaculations,
  Thorndyke hurried towards me to see what had happened. I picked myself up,
  and, having wiped my hand, proceeded to search for the object which had
  tripped me up. Cautiously probing with my foot in a clump of nettles, I
  brought to light what looked like the haft of an axe; but, when I seized it
  and drew it out, it proved to be a trenching tool.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment, as I stood with it in my hand, trying to connect it
  with some vague stirring of memory, that Thorndyke appeared through the
  bushes.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are not hurt, Jervis," he said, anxiously. "That would be a
  nasty thing to fall upon."</p>

  <p>I assured him that I had come to no harm beyond a few scratches. "But," I
  added, "I am not quite clear about the significance of this thing. I have a
  vague idea that something was said by somebody about a trenching tool, but I
  can't remember what or who it was."</p>

  <p>"The somebody," he replied, "was Kickweed. Don't you remember our
  interview in the garage when he told us, among other items, that he had a
  vague recollection of having seen a trenching tool there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course, I remember now. Then it is quite possible that this is
  the very tool he was speaking of?"</p>

  <p>By way of answer, he took the tool from me, and, having run his eye along
  the handle and turned it over, placed his finger on a spot near to the blade
  and held it out to me. Looking at it closely, I was able to make out in very
  faded lettering the name "D. Penrose," apparently printed with a rubber
  stamp.</p>

  <p>I must confess that I was profoundly impressed. Once more Thorndyke had
  achieved what had seemed to me an impossibility. Not only had he traced the
  route that the car had followed, but he had clearly established the identity
  of the car. Moreover, he had settled the place from which the car started in
  a country which he had never seen, working by inference and aided only by the
  map. It was a remarkable performance even for Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>But here my reflections were interrupted by a hail from Polton in a tone
  of high excitement. For he, too, had been "prospecting"; and as we returned
  to the end of the track, he met us, fairly bubbling with exultation and
  carrying his treasure trove in the form of a small spade and a leather
  case.</p>

  <p>"Here is an astonishing thing, sir!" he exclaimed. "I found these in the
  bushes, and they've both got Mr. Penrose's name stamped on them. I could
  hardly believe my eyes. But there," he added, "I don't suppose, sir, that you
  are surprised at all. I expect you knew they were there before we started
  from home."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smilingly disclaimed the omniscience with which his admiring
  henchman credited him (though, in fact, Polton was not so very wide of the
  mark), and taking from him the spade and case, looked them over and verified
  the marks of ownership.</p>

  <p>"You notice, Jervis," said he, "that these things correspond exactly with
  Kickweed's description; a small, light spade, pointed at the end, and a
  leather sheath or case to protect the point. The spade and the trenching tool
  appear to have been Penrose's equipment for his clandestine digging
  expeditions."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "and their presence here demonstrates that you were right
  in your inference as to the place where he parked his car. By the way, how
  did you arrive at it?"</p>

  <p>"I can hardly say that I arrived at it," he replied. "As I said, it was
  little more than a guess. I started with the hypothesis&mdash;a very
  well-supported one&mdash;that Penrose went forth that day with the intention
  of digging in Julliberrie's Grave, and that he did dig there. If that were
  so, he would park his car as near to the place as possible; and the more so
  since he knew that he was committing an unlawful act and might have to clear
  out of the neighbourhood in a hurry. For the same reason he would wish to
  leave his car where it would not be seen. But examination of the map showed
  this excellent place of concealment, less than half a mile from the
  barrow."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "it looks perfectly simple and obvious now that you have
  explained matters. But these tools, thrown away into the bushes, seem to
  suggest that the contingency that you mentioned did actually arise.
  Apparently, he did have to clear out of the neighbourhood in a hurry.
  Probably he was spotted in the act of digging and had to do a bolt, which
  would account for his having got rid of the incriminating tools. At any rate,
  it looks as if the panic had started here and not after the accident."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Thorndyke agreed. '"The killing of the old woman was not the
  cause but the consequence of the panic. And now, as we have finished this
  part of our quest, we may as well move on and see how Elmhurst is
  progressing&mdash;unless there is anything more that you would like to
  see."</p>

  <p>"There is," I replied with emphasis. "What I should like to see, above all
  other things in the world, is a good hospitable pub with oceans of beer and
  mountains of bread and cheese. As you seem to have memorised the whole
  neighbourhood, perhaps you know where one is to be found."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said Thorndyke, "that there is nothing nearer than the
  Wool-pack at Chilham."</p>

  <p>But here Polton, crinkling ecstatically, proceeded to unbutton his
  coat.</p>

  <p>"No need for a pub, sir," said he. "We're provided. And we can do
  something better than bread and cheese and beer."</p>

  <p>With this he fished out of his inexhaustible pockets a flat
  parcel&mdash;found to contain a veal and ham pie&mdash;a large flask of
  sherry, a nest of three aluminium drinking-cups and a shoe-maker's knife in a
  leather sheath wherewith to carve the pie. There were no forks, but the need
  of them was not felt as the thickness of the flat pie had been thoughtfully
  adapted to the dimensions of a moderately-opened human mouth. Joyfully, we
  selected a place as free as possible from brambles and nettles and there
  seated ourselves on the ground; and while Polton, by his unerring craftsman's
  eye, divided the pie into three equal parts, Thorndyke and I filled our cups
  and toasted the giver of the feast.</p>

  <p>When the banquet was finished and the empty flask, the cups and the knife
  had vanished into the receptacles whence they came, Polton thriftily utilised
  the wrapping-paper to disguise the naked form of the trenching tool. Then,
  with the aid of the compass, Thorndyke led the way through the wood and
  presently brought us out on to a stretch of rough pasture where, some three
  hundred yards away, we could see the excavators at work.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-14"
     id="ch2-14"></a>XIV. &mdash; JULLIBERRIE'S GRAVE</h2>

  <p class="first">The scene on which I looked as we came out of the wood
  rather took me by surprise; though, to be sure, Elmhurst's lucid and detailed
  account of the proposed operations ought to have prepared me. But to an
  uninformed person like myself, excavation is just a matter of digging, and I
  had hardly taken in the elaborate preliminaries that exact scientific
  procedure demands.</p>

  <p>Looking along the brow of the steep hill-side, one could see the
  barrow&mdash;a long, oval, grassy mound about fifty yards in
  length&mdash;standing out plainly against a background of trees that were
  just about to burst into leaf. Past it, to the left, down in the river
  valley, rose the tall white shape of Chilham Mill, while farther to the left
  and more distant was the town or village of Chilham. At ordinary times it
  must have been a rather desolate and solitary place, for no habitation was
  visible nearer than the distant mill, but now it was a scene of strenuous
  activity, peopled by busy workers.</p>

  <p>The preparatory operations had apparently been nearly completed. The
  barrow was surrounded by a substantial spile fence&mdash;evidently
  new&mdash;which marked off a rectangular enclosure. Inside this, two rows of
  surveying pegs had been driven into the ground and a theodolite stand set up
  over one of them suggested a survey in progress. Outside the enclosure was a
  methodically spread dump of turf, and a trackway of planks was being laid to
  another spot, apparently the site of a dump for the chalk and earth which
  would be removed from the mound as the excavation proceeded. There was also a
  stack of half a dozen metal wheelbarrows, and, hard by, a small shepherd's
  hut, in which a stoutly-built gentleman, apparently the surveyor, was at the
  moment depositing what looked like a theodolite case; which he did carefully,
  with a proper respect for the instrument, and then, having shut the door of
  the hut, strode away briskly down the hill towards the village.</p>

  <p>We seemed to have timed our arrival rather fortunately, for the work of
  uncovering the barrow had already commenced. Within the fenced enclosure two
  parties of workers were engaged, from opposite sides, in cutting out strips
  of turf and rolling them up like lengths of stair carpet. Of the two parties,
  one consisted of four labourers, who went about their work with the leisurely
  ease born of long experience, while the other party was, with the exception
  of one labourer, evidently composed of volunteers, among whom I
  distinguished, with some difficulty, our friend Elmhurst, transformed into
  the likeness of a coal-miner with leanings towards tennis.</p>

  <p>We halted near the edge of the wood to observe the procedure without
  interrupting the work. Presently Elmhurst, having accumulated a goodly heap
  of turf-rolls, loaded them into a wheelbarrow, which was promptly seized by
  one of his two assistants&mdash;a fair-haired young viking in a blue jersey
  and a pair of the most magnificent orange-red trousers of the kind known by
  fishermen as "fear-noughts"&mdash;who trundled it off through an opening in
  the fence and unloaded it neatly on to the turf dump on top of the already
  considerable stack that occupied it. Then he returned at a brisk trot, and,
  having set down the empty wheel-barrow, picked up his spade and fell to work
  again on the cutting out of a fresh load.</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that Elmhurst, happening to glance in our direction,
  not only observed our presence but evidently recognised us, for he laid down
  his spade and began to walk towards us; whereupon we hurried forward to meet
  him. As we approached, I noticed that he cast an inquisitive eye on the tools
  which Polton was carrying, and, as soon as we had exchanged greetings, he
  inquired:</p>

  <p>"Are you proposing to take an active part in the proceedings? I see that
  you are provided with the necessary implements."</p>

  <p>"The appearance is illusory," Thorndyke replied. "We did not bring these
  tools with us. They are the products of our prospecting activities in the
  wood hard by. And they are not going to be used on this occasion. It seems
  advisable to preserve them in the condition in which they were found."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst regarded the tools with intelligent interest and, I thought, with
  some disfavour.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said reflectively; "you connect those tools with the piece of
  pottery that you showed me?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke admitted that the connection seemed to be a reasonable one.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Elmhurst. "A pick and a spade do certainly seem to connect
  themselves with traces of unlawful digging in the neighbourhood. And they are
  quite workmanlike tools, especially the spade. I only hope that your friends
  have not been too workmanlike. In one respect they certainly have not. They
  have made a very poor job of replacing the turf."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "you have found evidence that the mound has really
  been dug into?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply. "There is no doubt whatever. But they seem only to
  have made a short, irregular trench, and, as they were nowhere near the
  burial chamber, I am still hopeful of finding that intact. But we shall see
  better how far they went when we get the turf off. As you see, we have got
  all the margin unturfed and we are just starting on the mound itself. We
  shall soon get that done with eight workers besides myself; and, meanwhile, I
  can take you round and show you the arrangements for excavating a
  barrow."</p>

  <p>"You mustn't let us waste your time," said Thorndyke, "and leave your
  colleagues to do all the work; though I must say, they seem to enjoy it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Jove!" I agreed. "They are proper enthusiasts. I have been
  watching that sea rover in the decorative trousers and wondering what those
  labourers think of him. But perhaps they are not Union men."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst smiled a cryptic smile but expressed complete satisfaction both
  with the labourers and his volunteer assistants. "I think," he added, "that
  my friends would like to make the acquaintance of the benefactor who has
  given us this very great pleasure."</p>

  <p>Accordingly we proceeded towards the fenced enclosure and entered it by
  one of the openings left for the wheelbarrows to pass in and out.</p>

  <p>"You notice," said Elmhurst, "that we have driven in a row of pegs all
  round the tumulus to define its edges. Those are for use in marking our plan
  and to guide us when we come to rebuild the mound. It has to be restored
  exactly to its original shape and size."</p>

  <p>"You speak of rebuilding the mound," said I. "You don't mean that you are
  going to move the entire structure?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly we are," he replied. "The essence of a complete excavation is
  in the thorough examination of every part of it. The whole of it will be
  moved excepting a narrow longitudinal wall, or spine, along the middle, which
  has to be left to preserve the contour and serve as a guide to build up to.
  We shall move one half at a time and the earth&mdash;or chalk rubble, as it
  will be in this case&mdash;that we take out will be carefully deposited in
  one of those dumps. Each dump will have a revetment of chalk blocks to
  prevent the piled earth from slipping away and getting scattered."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "it is all very thorough and methodical; a very
  different thing from the slovenly methods of the casual digger. By the way,
  which side do you propose to begin with?"</p>

  <p>"The right-hand side," replied Elmhurst. "That is the side on which your
  friends operated, and we are rather anxious to settle once for all what they
  really did in the way of excavation and how much damage they have done. My
  colleagues are now beginning to peel off the turf from that side of the
  mound."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, we rounded the end of the barrow and came in sight of the two
  volunteers and the labourer, all busily engaged in cutting lines in the turf
  with implements like cheese-cutters set on long handles. As we approached,
  the owner of the fear-noughts looked up and rather disconcerted me by
  disclosing an extremely comely feminine countenance; which accounted for
  Elmhurst's cryptic smile and caused me hurriedly to re-examine the other
  "gentleman," only to discover that the breeches which I had innocently
  accepted as diagnostic of masculinity, appertained to a lady.</p>

  <p>The introductions, effected by Elmhurst with a ceremonious bow and a grin
  of malicious satisfaction, informed us that the two ladies were,
  respectively, Miss Stirling&mdash;the wearer of the nautical
  garments&mdash;and Miss Bidborough, and that both were qualified and
  enthusiastic archaeologists (this was Elmhurst's statement, and neither
  denied it on behalf of the other); and that both were profoundly grateful to
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"It is the chance of a life-time," said Miss Stirling, "to carry out a
  complete excavation of a neolithic barrow; and such a famous one, too. I have
  often come here and looked at Julliberrie's Grave and thought how interesting
  it would be to turn it out thoroughly and see what it really contained. But
  we are in an awful twitter about those tomb-robbers who have been hacking at
  the mound. It will be a tragedy if they have reached the important part of
  the barrow."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Miss Bidborough agreed, severely. "These clandestine diggers are
  the bane of scientific archaeology. They confuse all the issues by disturbing
  the stratification, they break or damage valuable relics, and, worst of all,
  they sneak off secretly with things of priceless scientific value and never
  record what they have found. Do you happen to know who these people were, Dr.
  Thorndyke, who broke into this barrow?"</p>

  <p>"The only person," replied Thorndyke, "known to me as being under
  suspicion is an amateur&mdash;a very amateur&mdash;collector of
  antiques."</p>

  <p>"They usually are," said Elmhurst, gloomily; "and this fellow must have
  been worse than usual. Just look at the way he put the turf back!"</p>

  <p>He pointed indignantly to an irregular area on the side of the mound in
  which even my inexpert eye could detect the ragged lines which marked the
  untidy replacement. From my knowledge of the man (and my distinct prejudice
  against him) it was just what I should have expected; and I was indiscreet
  enough to say so.</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Miss Bidborough, addressing Elmhurst, "I am in hopes
  that we shall have a visit from Theophilus. He has to come down to Canterbury
  to-day, and I think he intends to come on here and see how we are getting on
  with the work. I hope he will. I know he would like to meet Dr.
  Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke looked inquiringly at Elmhurst. "Do I know Mr. Theophilus?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"His name isn't really Theophilus," Elmhurst explained. "That is only a
  term of affection among his friends. He is actually Professor Templeton."</p>

  <p>"Then I do know him, at least by repute," said Thorndyke. "And now I
  suggest that we move on and let these ladies proceed with their work and see
  what enormities the unauthorised diggers have committed."</p>

  <p>With this we bowed to the fair excavators, and as they picked up their
  cheese-cutters to renew their assault on the turf, we resumed our personally
  conducted tour, passing round the head of the mound (where Elmhurst pointed
  out to us the probable position of the burial chamber) to inspect the works
  on the other side. As we came out on to the lower side, whence we could see
  the whole hill-side and the river valley below, we observed a figure in the
  distance striding up the steep ascent with a purposeful air suggesting a
  definite objective.</p>

  <p>"Here is Theophilus, himself," remarked Elmhurst (whose power of
  recognising distant persons did credit to his spectacles). "We may as well go
  down and meet him and get the introductions over before we come to the scene
  of the operations."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, we proceeded down the hill-side, but at a leisurely pace, as
  we had to come up again, and, in due course, came within hail of the visitor,
  who viewed us with undisguised interest; which, indeed, was mutual; for a man
  who gets called by an affectionate nickname by his juniors probably merits
  respectful consideration. And this gentleman&mdash;a tall, athletic,
  eminently good-looking man, very unlike the popular conception of a
  professor&mdash;made a definitely pleasant impression.</p>

  <p>When we at length met, he shook hands cordially with Elmhurst and then
  looked at Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I think," said he, "that I can diagnose the giver of this archaeological
  feast. You are Dr. Thorndyke, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke admitted his identity, but protested:</p>

  <p>"I am really getting a great deal of undeserved credit for this
  excavation. Actually, I am greatly indebted to Elmhurst for all the trouble
  that he is taking, since I am hoping to get some useful information from the
  opening of the barrow."</p>

  <p>Professor Templeton looked at him somewhat curiously.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said he, "you know your own business&mdash;uncommonly well,
  as I understand&mdash;but I can't imagine what information you expect to get
  by the excavation that we couldn't have given you without it."</p>

  <p>"Probably you are right," Thorndyke admitted, "at least in a scientific
  sense. But in legal practice, and in relation to a particular set of
  circumstances, an ascertained fact is usually of more weight than even the
  most authoritative opinion."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the professor, "I appreciate that. But when Elmhurst told me
  about the project, I wondered&mdash;and am still wondering&mdash;whether
  there might not be some&mdash;what shall we say?&mdash;some arriere-pensee,
  some expectation that the digging operations might yield some
  extra-archaeological facts. You see, your reputation has preceded you."</p>

  <p>He smiled genially, and Thorndyke was evidently in no wise disconcerted by
  the implied suspicions; and I was just beginning to wonder, for my part,
  whether there might not be some justice in those suspicions when my colleague
  addressed Elmhurst.</p>

  <p>"I think," said he, "your presence is required at the diggings. Some
  rather urgent signals are being made."</p>

  <p>We all looked up towards the barrow, and there, sure enough, was a
  picturesque, red-trousered figure standing on the summit of the mound,
  beckoning excitedly; and, even as we looked, a labourer came down the hill at
  a heavy trot, and, when he had arrived within earshot, announced that Miss
  Stirling asked Mr. Elmhurst to return at once.</p>

  <p>In compliance with this unmistakably urgent summons, Elmhurst immediately
  started up the hill at something between a walk and a trot, and we turned and
  followed at a more convenient pace.</p>

  <p>"Those girls have apparently found something out of the common," the
  professor remarked. "I wonder what it can be. They can't have struck the
  burial chamber, for they have only begun peeling the turf off; and you don't
  look for anything important so near the surface."</p>

  <p>We watched Elmhurst run round the end of the mound, where he disappeared
  for the moment. But in a very short time he reappeared, hurrying in our
  direction; and, as we, thereupon, quickened our pace, we met within a short
  distance of the mound.</p>

  <p>"My colleagues," he announced in his usual sedate, self-contained manner,
  though a little breathlessly, "have found something, Doctor, which is rather
  more in your line than in ours. Apparently, there is some one buried just
  under the surface in the place where the unauthorised digging has been
  carried out."</p>

  <p>"You say 'apparently,'" said Thorndyke. "Then I take it that you have not
  uncovered a body?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Elmhurst, as we turned to accompany him back. "What happened
  was this: Miss Stirling was rolling up a strip of turf when she saw what
  looked like the toe of a boot showing through the surface soil! So she
  scraped away some of the soil with her spade and I uncovered the greater part
  of a boot; and then the toe of a second boot came into view; whereupon she
  ran up the mound and signalled for me to come."</p>

  <p>"You are sure that they are not just a pair of empty boots?" Thorndyke
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite sure," was the reply. "I scraped away the earth enough to see the
  bottoms of a pair of trousers and then came on to report. But there is no
  doubt that there are feet in those boots."</p>

  <p>Nothing more was said as we walked quickly up the hill, but I caught a
  significant glance from the professor's eye, and I noticed that Polton had
  developed a new and lively interest in the proceedings. As to Thorndyke, it
  was impossible to judge whether the discovery had occasioned him any
  surprise; but I suspected&mdash;and so, evidently did the
  professor&mdash;that the possibility had been in his mind. Indeed, I began to
  ask myself if this gruesome "find" did not represent the actual purpose of
  the excavation.</p>

  <p>On arriving at the barrow, we passed round the foot end and came in sight
  of the scene of the discovery, where a broad patch of the chalky soil had
  been uncovered by the removal of the turf. The two ladies stood close by it,
  backed by the gang of labourers who had been attracted to the spot by the
  report of the discovery; and the eyes of them all were rivetted on a shallow
  depression at the bottom of which a pair of whitened boots projected through
  the chalk rubble.</p>

  <p>"Would you like me to get the body out?" Thorndyke asked. "As you said, it
  is more in my line than yours."</p>

  <p>"I didn't mean that," replied Elmhurst. "I'll dig it out. But, as I have
  had no experience of the exhumation of recent remains, you had better see
  that I go about it in the right way."</p>

  <p>With this, he selected a suitable pick and spade, and, having placed a
  wheelbarrow close by to receive the soil, fell to work.</p>

  <p>We watched him cautiously and skilfully pick away the clammy chalk rubble
  in which the corpse was embedded, and, as each new part became disclosed,
  attention and curiosity quickened. First the legs, looking almost as if
  modelled in chalk, then the skirt of a rain-coat, and one whitened,
  repulsive-looking hand. Then, partly covered by the body, an object was seen,
  the nature of which was not at first obvious; but when Elmhurst had carefully
  disengaged it from the soil and drawn it out, it appeared as the whitened and
  shapeless remains of a felt hat, which was at once handed to Thorndyke; who
  restored it, as far as possible, to a recognisable shape, wiped its exterior
  with a bunch of turf, glanced into its interior, and then put it down on the
  side of the mound.</p>

  <p>Gradually the corpse was uncovered and disengaged from its chalky bed
  until, at length, it lay revealed as the body of a stoutish man who, so far
  as could be judged, was on the shady side of middle age. Naturally, six
  months of burial in the clammy chalk had left uncomely traces and obscured
  the characteristics of the face; but when Thorndyke had gently cleaned the
  latter with a wisp of turf, the chalk-smeared, sodden features still retained
  enough of their original character to render identification possible by one
  who had known the man. In fact, it was not only possible. It was actually
  achieved. For, as Thorndyke stood up and threw away the wisp of turf, Polton,
  who had watched the procedure with fascinated eyes, suddenly stooped and
  gazed with the utmost astonishment into the dead man's face.</p>

  <p>"Why!" he exclaimed, "it looks like Mr. Penrose!"</p>

  <p>"You think it does?" said Thorndyke, without the slightest trace of
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Of course, sir," replied Polton, "I couldn't be positive. He's so very
  much changed. But he looks to me like Mr. Penrose; and I feel pretty certain
  that that is who he is."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that you are right, Polton," said Thorndyke. "The hat is
  certainly his hat; and the fact that you recognised the body seems to settle
  the question of identity. And now another question arises. How is the body to
  be disposed of? The correct procedure would be to leave it where it is and
  notify the police. What do you say to that, Elmhurst?"</p>

  <p>"You know best what the legal position is," was the reply. "But it won't
  be very comfortable carrying on the work with that gruesome object staring us
  in the face. Is there any legal objection to its being moved?"</p>

  <p>"No, I think not," replied Thorndyke. "There are competent witnesses as to
  the circumstances of the discovery, and the soil is going to be thoroughly
  examined, so that any objects connected with the body are certain to be
  found."</p>

  <p>"Quite certain," said Elmhurst. "The soil will not only be examined. That
  from this part will be sifted. And, of course, any objects found will be
  carefully preserved and reported. Still, we don't want to do anything
  irregular."</p>

  <p>"I will take the responsibility for moving the body," said Thorndyke, "if
  you will find the means. But I think it would be as well to send a messenger
  in advance to the police so that they may be prepared."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Elmhurst agreed. "Then I will send a man off at once and, if
  Mr. Polton will come and lend me a hand, we can rig up an extemporised
  stretcher from some of the spare fencing material."</p>

  <p>With this he went off, accompanied by Polton, in search of the necessary
  material; the ladies migrated to the farther end of the mound, where they
  resumed their turf-cutting operations, and the labourers returned to their
  tasks.</p>

  <p>When we were alone, the professor stood for a while looking thoughtfully
  at the ghastly figure, lying at the bottom of its trench. Presently he turned
  to Thorndyke and asked:</p>

  <p>"Has it occurred to you, Doctor&mdash;I expect it has&mdash;that the
  person who buried this poor creature showed very considerable foresight?"</p>

  <p>"You mean in selecting a scheduled monument as a burial-place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but I see that you have considered the point. It is rather
  subtle. According to ordinary probabilities, a scheduled tumulus should be
  the safest of all places in which to dispose of a dead body. It is actually
  secured by law against any disturbance of the soil. But for your
  intervention, this place might have remained untouched for a century."</p>

  <p>"Very true," Thorndyke agreed, "but, of course, there is the converse
  aspect. If suspicion arises in respect of a given locality, the very security
  of a barrow from chance disturbance makes it the likeliest place for a
  suspected burial."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," the professor ventured, "that an ordinary exhumation order
  would not have answered your purpose?"</p>

  <p>"It would not have been practicable," Thorndyke replied. "I did not know
  that the body was here. I did not even know for certain that there was a dead
  body; and I don't suppose that either the Home Office or the Office of Works
  would have agreed to the excavation of a scheduled tumulus to search for
  corpse whose existence was purely hypothetical. The only practicable method
  was a regular excavation by competent archaeologists; which would not only
  settle the question whether the body was there or not, but, in the event of a
  negative result, would not have raised any troublesome issues or disclosed
  any suspicions which might possibly turn out to be unfounded."</p>

  <p>"Yes," the professor agreed. "I admire your tact and discretion. You have
  done valuable service to archaeology and you have managed very neatly to
  harness the unsuspecting Elmhurst to your legal chariot."</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," said I, "that Elmhurst was quite so unsuspecting as you
  think. But he also is a discreet gentleman. He wanted to excavate the barrow
  and was willing to do it and ask no questions. But I fancy that he expected
  to find something more significant than neolithic pottery."</p>

  <p>Here our discussion was brought to an end by the arrival of Elmhurst and
  Polton, bearing a sort of elongated hurdle formed very neatly by lashing
  together a number of stout rods. This they deposited opposite the place where
  the body was lying in readiness to receive its melancholy burden.</p>

  <p>"I think, Jervis," said Thorndyke, "that the next proceeding devolves upon
  us. Will you lend us a hand, Polton? The body ought to be lifted as evenly as
  possible to avoid any disturbance of the joints."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, we placed ourselves by the side of the trench, Thorndyke
  taking the head and shoulders, I taking the middle, while Polton supported
  the legs and feet. At the word from Thorndyke, we all very carefully lifted
  the limp, sagging figure and carried it to the hurdle on which we gently
  lowered it. As we rose and stood looking down at the poor shabby heap of
  mortality, Polton, who appeared to be deeply moved, moralised sadly.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear!" he exclaimed, "what a dreadful and grievous thing it is. To
  think that that miserable, dirty mass of rags and carrion is all that is left
  of a fine, jovial, happy gentleman, full of energy and enjoying every moment
  of his life. There is a heavy debt against somebody, and I hope, sir, that
  you will see that it is paid to the uttermost farthing."</p>

  <p>"I hope so, too, Polton," said Thorndyke. "That, you know, is what we are
  here for. Can we find anything to cover the body? It is a rather gruesome
  object to carry down into the village."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, the four labourers who had volunteered as bearers approached
  carrying a bundle of sacks; and with these, laid across the hurdle, the
  wretched, unseemly remains were decently covered up. Then the four men lifted
  the hurdle (which, with its wasted burden, must have been quite light) and
  moved away round the foot of the barrow, watched, not without evident relief,
  by Elmhurst and his two colleagues.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Elmhurst, as we prepared to follow, "you won't be coming
  back here?"</p>

  <p>"Not to-day," replied Thorndyke. "But we shall have to attend the inquest,
  either as witnesses or to watch the proceedings, so we shall have an
  opportunity to see your work in a more advanced stage. Don't think that our
  interest in it is extinct because we are no longer concerned with neolithic
  pottery."</p>

  <p>With this we took leave of our friends and, starting off down the
  hill-side, soon overtook and passed the bearers and made our way to the
  foot-bridge over the river near the mill. A few yards farther on, we met our
  messenger returning in company with a police sergeant, and halted to give the
  latter the necessary particulars.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he remarked, "you ought, properly, to have left the body
  where it was and reported to us. Still, as you say, there's nothing in it as
  the witnesses are available. I'll just note your addresses and those of any
  other persons that you know of who may be wanted at the inquest."</p>

  <p>We accordingly gave our own names and addresses (at which I noticed that
  the sergeant seemed to prick up his ears), and Thorndyke gave those of
  Brodribb, Horridge and Kickweed. And this concluded the day's business. Of
  the spade and the trenching tool Thorndyke said nothing, evidently intending
  to examine them at his leisure before handing them over to the police.</p>

  <p>I may say that the discovery had given me one of the greatest surprises of
  my life. The idea that Penrose might be dead had never occurred to me. And
  yet, as soon as the discovery had been made, I began to realise how all the
  facts that were known to us pointed in this direction, and I also began to
  see the drift of the many hints that Thorndyke had given me. But, although,
  over a very substantial tea at the Wool-pack Inn, we discussed the various
  and stirring events of the day, I did not think it expedient to enter into
  the details of the case in Polton's presence. Not that, in these days, we had
  many secrets from Polton. But there were certain other matters, as yet
  undisclosed, that it seemed better to reserve for discussion when we should
  be alone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-15"
     id="ch2-15"></a>XV. &mdash; WHAT BEFELL AT THE WOOL-PACK</h2>

  <p class="first">The inquest on the body of Daniel Penrose yielded nothing
  that was new to us. The coroner had been provided by Thorndyke with a brief
  synopsis of the known facts of the case (which my colleague had, apparently,
  prepared in advance) to serve as a guide in conducting the inquiry; but he
  was a discreet man who understood his business and avoided extending the
  proceedings beyond the proper scope of a coroner's inquest. Nor had we been
  able to increase our knowledge of the case; for neither the spade nor the
  trenching tool furnished any information whatever. All our attempts to
  develop finger-prints failed utterly, and the most minute examination of the
  tools for traces of hair or blood was equally fruitless. Which was not
  surprising; for even if such traces had originally existed, six months
  exposure to the weather would naturally have dissipated them.</p>

  <p>But if the coroner was not disposed to go beyond the facts connected with
  the discovery, there was another person who was. We had put up for the night
  at the Wool-pack in Chilham in order to be present at the post-mortem (by the
  coroner's invitation), and were just finishing a leisurely breakfast when the
  coffee-room door opened to admit no less a person than Mr. Superintendent
  Miller. He had come down by an early train for the express purpose of getting
  an outline of the case from Thorndyke to assist him in following the
  proceedings at the inquest.</p>

  <p>"Well, Doctor," he said, cheerfully, seating himself without ceremony at
  our table, "here we are, and both on the same errand, I take it."</p>

  <p>"We are," Thorndyke replied, "if you have come to attend the inquest on
  poor Penrose."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," rejoined Miller. "We have a common purpose&mdash;which isn't
  always the case. Lord, Doctor! What a pleasure it is to find myself, for once
  in a way, on the same side of the board with you, playing the same game
  against the same opponent! You won't mind if I ask you a few questions?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied Thorndyke. "But the first question is, have you had
  breakfast?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I have, you know," said Miller, "but it was a long time ago. I
  think I could pick a morsel, since you mention the matter."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, Thorndyke rang the bell, and, having given an order for a
  morsel in the form of a gammon rasher and a pot of coffee, prepared himself
  for the superintendent's assault.</p>

  <p>"Now, Doctor," the latter began, in his best cross-examining manner, "it
  is perfectly clear to me that you know all about this case."</p>

  <p>"I wish it were as clear to me," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"There, now. Dr. Jervis," exclaimed Miller, "just listen to that. Isn't he
  an aggravating man? He has got all the facts of the case up his sleeve, as he
  usually has, and now he is going to pretend&mdash;as he usually
  does&mdash;that he doesn't know anything about it. But it won't do, Doctor.
  The facts speak for themselves. Here were our men trapesing up and down the
  country, looking for Daniel Penrose to execute a warrant on him, and all the
  time you knew perfectly well that he was safely tucked away in a
  barrow&mdash;though why the deuce they call the thing a barrow when it is
  obviously just a mound of earth, I can't imagine."</p>

  <p>"That is a wild exaggeration, you know, Miller," Thorndyke protested.
  "After six months' study of the case, I came to the conclusion that Penrose
  was probably buried in this barrow. But I was so far from certainty that I
  had to take this roundabout way of settling the question whether I was or was
  not mistaken. It happened that my conclusion was correct."</p>

  <p>"It usually does," said Miller. "And I expect you have formed some
  conclusions as to who planted that body in the barrow. And I expect those
  conclusions will happen to be right, too. And I should very much like to know
  what they are."</p>

  <p>"Really, Miller," I exclaimed, "I am surprised at you. Have you known
  Thorndyke all these years without discovering that he never lets the cat out
  of the bag until he can let her right out? No protruding heads or tails for
  him. But, when everything is finished and the course is clear, out she
  comes."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," said Miller, gloomily, "I know his beastly secret ways. I
  think that, in some previous state of existence, he must have been an oyster.
  Still, doctor, you needn't be so close with an old friend."</p>

  <p>"But my dear Miller," protested Thorndyke, "you are entirely mistaken. I
  am withholding nothing that could properly tell you. What Jervis has said,
  though crudely put, is the strict truth. If I knew who had committed this
  crime, of course I should tell you. But I don't know. And if I have any
  half-formed suspicions, I am going to keep them to myself until I am able to
  test them. In short, Miller, I will tell you all I know. But I tell nobody
  what I think. So now ask me any questions you please."</p>

  <p>I must admit that it was not very encouraging for Miller. My experience of
  Thorndyke was fairly expressed in what he had just said. He would tell you
  all the facts (which you usually knew already and which were more or less
  common property) but the general truths which were implicit in those facts he
  would leave you to discover for yourself; which you never did until the final
  conclusions emerged; when it was surprising how obvious they were.</p>

  <p>"Well, to begin with," said Miller. "There was that chappie at the
  hospital whom we all supposed to be Penrose. Have you any idea who he really
  was? You obviously spotted the fact that he was not Penrose."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke, "I have no idea who he was. My suspicion that he
  was not Penrose was based on his behaviour, especially on the fact that he
  appeared particularly anxious to avoid being seen or recognised by any one
  who knew Penrose. As a matter of fact, he was not then recognisable at all,
  and nobody knows what he was really like. But I don't think that there is any
  utility in going into details of the case at that stage. Remember that my
  investigations were then concerned with the questions: Is Penrose alive or
  dead? And if he is dead, what has become of his body? Now, I have settled
  those questions and their solution has evolved the further questions: Was he
  murdered? And, if so who murdered him? The first question will be answered at
  the inquest&mdash;pretty certainly in the affirmative; and we shall then
  address ourselves to the second. And as you say, we have a common purpose and
  shall try to be mutually helpful.</p>

  <p>"Now, I have given the coroner a synopsis of the case from the beginning,
  and I have a copy of it which I am going to hand to you. I suggest that you
  study it, and then, if anything occurs to you in connection with it, and you
  like to ask me any questions on matters of fact, I will give you all the
  information that I possess. How will that do for you?"</p>

  <p>I suspected that it was not at all what Miller would have liked; but he
  saw clearly, as I did, that Thorndyke was not going to disclose any theories
  that he might have formed as to where we might look for the possible
  murderer. Accordingly, he accepted the position with as good a grace as he
  could, and, when he had finished a very substantial breakfast, he demanded
  the synopsis, which Thorndyke fetched from his room and placed in his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Are you coming to watch the post-mortem, Jervis?" my colleague asked.</p>

  <p>"No," I replied. "I shall hear all about it at the inquest; so I think I
  shall improve the shining hour by taking a walk up to the barrow to see how
  the work is progressing."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Miller. "Then perhaps you wouldn't mind my walking with you. I
  have never seen a barrow. Never heard of one until I read the report in the
  paper."</p>

  <p>Of course, I had to agree; not unwillingly, in fact, for liked our old
  friend. But I knew quite well what the proposal meant. As nothing was to be
  got out of Thorndyke, Miller intended to apply a gentle squeeze to me. And to
  this also I had no objection, for I was still in the dark as to how Thorndyke
  had reached his very definite conclusions and was quite willing to have my
  memories of the investigation stirred up.</p>

  <p>The process began as soon as we were fairly outside the inn.</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, Dr. Jervis," said the superintendent, "it's all very well
  for the doctor to pretend that he hasn't anything to go on, but there are
  certain obvious questions that arise when a well-to-do man like Penrose gets
  murdered. The first is: Who benefits by its death?"</p>

  <p>"The answer to that," I replied, "is quite simple. Penrose made a will by
  which practically the whole of his property goes to a man named
  Horridge."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Miller, "it will be worth while to give a little attention to
  Mr. Horridge. Do you know anything about him?"</p>

  <p>"Not very much," I replied. "But I know this much; that he is about the
  most unlikely man in the world to have murdered Penrose."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?" demanded Miller.</p>

  <p>"Because, if Penrose died when we believe he did, Horridge stands to lose
  something like a hundred and fifty thousand pounds by his death. Penrose was
  the principal heir of his father, who was quite a rich man. But when Penrose
  died&mdash;if he did die on the date which we are assuming&mdash;his father
  was alive and consequently the father's estate would not pass to him. But
  Horridge was Penrose's heir and would have inherited the father's property,
  as well as Penrose's, under the latter's will. So it didn't suit Horridge at
  all for Penrose to die when he did."</p>

  <p>"And is the old man still alive?"</p>

  <p>"No. He died quite recently."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Miller. "Then somebody else benefits by Penrose's death. Do you
  happen to know who that will be?"</p>

  <p>"No," I replied. "I understand, but do not know for certain, that the old
  man died intestate. In that case, the next of kin will benefit. They will
  benefit very considerably, as their expectations would have been quite small
  if Penrose had been alive when his father died. But I have no idea who they
  are."</p>

  <p>"Well, we shall have to find that out," said Miller. "It seems that
  somebody had a perfectly understandable motive for getting rid of Penrose
  while the old man was still alive."</p>

  <p>As Miller continued his interrogations, asking uncommonly shrewd questions
  and making equally shrewd comments, I began to feel an unwonted sympathy with
  Thorndyke in respect of his habitual reticence and secretiveness. For his
  approach to a criminal problem was quite different from Miller's, and there
  might easily arise some conflict between the two. Miller was evidently on the
  look-out for a suspect, and was considering the problem in terms of persons;
  whereas Thorndyke's practice was to watch, unseen and unsuspected, while he
  collected and sifted the evidence, and above all, to avoid alarming the
  suspected persons until he was ready to make the final move.</p>

  <p>But our arrival at the top of Julliberrie Downs put an end, for the time
  being, to Miller's bombardment; for here we came in sight of the barrow, now
  stripped of its turf and presenting the smooth, white, rounded shape on which
  its builders had looked a couple of thousand years or more before the coming
  of the Romans. I explained its nature and its great antiquity to Miller, who
  was deeply impressed, but who, nevertheless, showed a strong inclination to
  "cut the cackle and get back to the case." But as we approached, the
  eagle-eyed Elmhurst observed us and came forward to do the honours of the
  excavation.</p>

  <p>Under his guidance we went round to the farther side of the mound which
  was in the process of being cut away like a gigantic cheese, and the chalk
  rubble, stored in the dump, was mounting to the magnitude of a considerable
  hill. At this point, the superintendent's interest in the barrow awakened
  surprisingly, for an excavation was more or less in his line, and he took the
  opportunity to pick up a few technical tips. He was particularly impressed by
  a builder's sieve which had been set up at the dump.</p>

  <p>"I see," he remarked to Elmhurst, "that you don't mean to miss anything. I
  shall bear your methods in mind the next time I have to direct a search. And
  speaking of a search, have you turned up anything that seems to be connected
  with the body that you found?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Elmhurst. "We found, near the place where the body was
  lying, quite an interesting thing, and, I should say, decidedly connected
  with that body&mdash;a small bronze pestle, apparently belonging to an
  ancient drug-mortar. I'll show it to you. Miss Stirling, have you got that
  pestle?"</p>

  <p>As the lady addressed turned round and greeted me with a friendly nod, the
  superintendent whispered to me in an awe-stricken tone:</p>

  <p>"Good gracious! That young person in the fisherman's trousers is a female!
  And I believe the other one is, too. Well, I never!"</p>

  <p>"You would hardly expect them to wear evening dress for a job like this,"
  I remarked; to which the superintendent assented, but continued to watch the
  ladies furtively and with fascinated eyes.</p>

  <p>The pestle was presently produced from the shepherd's hut and offered for
  our inspection; a smallish pestle of bronze&mdash;now covered with a thick
  green patina&mdash;with a bulbous end and a rather elaborately decorated
  handle surmounted by a bearded head of the classical type which I assumed to
  represent Esculapius. Attached to it was a small tie-on label on which was
  written a note of its precise "find-spot" in the mound.</p>

  <p>Miller took it in his hand and executed a warlike flourish with it, by way
  of testing its weight.</p>

  <p>"It's of no great size," he remarked, "but it is quite a formidable
  weapon. Uncommonly handy, too, and as portable as a life-preserver. Perhaps I
  had better take charge of it."</p>

  <p>He was about to slip it into his pocket when Elmhurst interposed
  firmly.</p>

  <p>"I think I must keep it for the present. I am summoned to give evidence at
  the inquest and I shall have to produce this. Besides, I am personally
  responsible to the Office of Works for all objects found during the
  excavation."</p>

  <p>With this he quietly resumed possession of the pestle, which Miller
  reluctantly surrendered, and as the latter had no further interest in the
  excavation, and made no secret of the fact, we presently took our leave and
  resumed our perambulations, with a running accompaniment of interrogation on
  the part of the superintendent which caused me to hail the luncheon hour with
  a certain sense of relief.</p>

  <p>The superintendent, of course, lunched with us, and when at the table he
  continued his quest for knowledge, beginning, naturally, with inquiries as to
  the result of the post-mortem.</p>

  <p>"The cause of death is obvious enough," said Thorndyke. "There is a
  depressed fracture of the skull at the left side and towards the back; not
  very large, but deep, and suggesting a very violent blow. The shape of the
  depression&mdash;a fairly regular oval concavity&mdash;implies a blunt weapon
  of a smooth, rounded shape."</p>

  <p>"Such as a pestle, for instance," Miller suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke replied, "a pestle would agree with the conditions. But
  why do you suggest a pestle?"</p>

  <p>"Because your excavating friends have found one; a bronze pestle; quite a
  handy little weapon, and portable enough to go quite easily into an ordinary
  pocket."</p>

  <p>Here he gave a very excellent and concise description of the weapon, to
  which Thorndyke listened with deep interest.</p>

  <p>"So you see," Miller concluded, "that it is a thing that ought to be quite
  easy to identify by any one who had ever seen it. Dr. Jervis thinks that it
  would not be likely to be the property of a chemist or apothecary. What do
  you say to that?"</p>

  <p>"I agree with him," Thorndyke replied. "That is to say, it does not
  definitely suggest an apothecary as would have been the case if it had been a
  Wedgwood pestle. Bronze mortars and pestles are not now in general use; and
  this is pretty evidently an ancient pestle."</p>

  <p>"A sort of curio, in fact," said Miller, "and rather suggestive of a
  collector or curio monger?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke agreed that this was so, but he made no further comment, though
  the connection of a curio with the late Daniel Penrose was fairly
  significant. But my recent experiences of Miller's eager and persistent
  cross-examinations enabled me to understand the sort of defensive reticence
  that they tended to engender. Moreover, the connection, though significant,
  was not very clear as to its bearing. It would have been more obvious if
  Penrose had been the murderer.</p>

  <p>The inquest was held in a large room at the inn, normally reserved for
  gatherings of a more festive character, and when we entered and took our
  places the preliminaries of swearing in the jury and viewing the body had
  already been disposed of. I looked round the room and noted that in the seats
  set apart for the witnesses, not only Elmhurst and his two coadjutors were
  present but also Kickweed and Horridge. Both of the latter showed evident
  signs of distress, but more especially Horridge. Which rather surprised me.
  The grief of the lugubrious, red-eyed Kickweed was understandable enough; for
  not only had he manifested a genuine affection and loyalty towards his dead
  master, but the death of Penrose was a very material loss to him. But I could
  not reconcile Horridge's condition with the callous selfishness that he had
  shown previously. It is true that the apparent date of the death put an end
  to his hopes of inheriting the fortune of the lately deceased Penrose senior,
  but, on the other hand, he stood to gain forthwith the very respectable sum
  of fifty thousand pounds, for which he might reasonably have expected to wait
  for years. Nevertheless, he was obviously extremely upset, and it was evident
  from his pale, haggard face and his restless movements, that this sudden,
  unforeseen catastrophe had come on him as an overwhelming shock.</p>

  <p>The first witness called was Miss Stirling, who gave a brief,
  matter-of-fact description of her discovery, to which the jury listened with
  absorbed interest. She was followed by Elmhurst, who amplified her statement
  and described his disinterment of the body and the appearance and position of
  the latter. He also explained the methods of excavation and the procedure
  after the body had been removed.</p>

  <p>"In the soil which was taken away after the removal of the body," the
  coroner inquired, "did you find any objects that seemed to be connected with
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Elmhurst. "I found this pestle, which could certainly not
  have been among the original contents of the barrow."</p>

  <p>Here he produced the pestle wrapped in a handkerchief, and, having removed
  the latter, handed the "find" to the coroner, who inspected it curiously and
  then passed it on to the foreman of the jury.</p>

  <p>"This," he remarked, "does not look like a modern pestle. As you are an
  authority on antiquities, Mr. Elmhurst, perhaps you can tell us something
  about it."</p>

  <p>"I am not much of an authority on recent antiquities," Elmhurst disclaimed
  modestly, "but I should judge that this pestle belonged to a bronze
  drug-mortar of the kind that was in use in the seventeenth or early
  eighteenth century."</p>

  <p>"You would not regard it as probably part of the outfit of a chemist's
  shop?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Elmhurst. "I understand that, since the introduction of
  grinding machinery, the practice of grinding hard drugs in metal mortars is
  quite extinct."</p>

  <p>"Can you form any idea how long this object has been buried?"</p>

  <p>"I could not judge the exact time; but, assuming it to have been bright,
  or at least clean, when it was buried, I should say that it must have been
  lying in the ground for several months."</p>

  <p>That concluded Elmhurst's evidence, and, as he retired to his seat, the
  name of the medical witness was called.</p>

  <p>"You have made an examination of the body of the deceased?" the coroner
  began, when the preliminaries had been disposed of. "Can you give any opinion
  as to how long deceased has been dead?"</p>

  <p>"My examination," the witness replied, "led me to the belief that he had
  been dead at least six months."</p>

  <p>"Did you arrive at any conclusion as to the cause of death?"</p>

  <p>"The cause of death was an injury to the brain occasioned by a heavy blow
  on the head. There is a small but deep depressed fracture of the skull on the
  left side just above and behind the ear, which appears to have been produced
  by a blunt, smooth weapon with a rounded end."</p>

  <p>"Please look at this pestle, which you have heard was found near the place
  where the body had been lying. Could the injuries which you found have been
  produced by this?"</p>

  <p>The doctor examined the pestle and gave it as his opinion that it
  corresponded completely with the shape of the fracture.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that it is a mere formality to ask whether the injuries could
  have been self-inflicted or due to an accident?" the coroner suggested.</p>

  <p>"They certainly could not have been self-inflicted," the witness replied.
  "As to an accident, one doesn't like to use the word impossible, but I cannot
  imagine my kind of accident which would have produced the injuries that were
  found."</p>

  <p>This completed the medical evidence proper, but Thorndyke was called to
  give confirmatory testimony.</p>

  <p>"You have heard the evidence of the doctor. Have you any observations to
  make on it?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "I am in complete agreement with everything that
  my colleague has said."</p>

  <p>"We may take it," said the coroner, "that you know more about this affair
  than anybody else. Can you throw any light on the actual circumstances in
  which the tragedy occurred?"</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke replied. "My investigations have been concerned with the
  question whether Daniel Penrose was alive or dead; and, if he was dead, when
  and where his death occurred. I can make no suggestion as to the identity of
  the person who killed him."</p>

  <p>"As to the date of his death; have you arrived at any conclusion on that
  point?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have no doubt that deceased met his death at some time in the
  evening of the seventeenth of last October. I base that conclusion
  principally on the fact that his car was seen coming away from the
  neighbourhood of the place where his body was found, and that it was
  evidently being driven by some other person."</p>

  <p>"And have you formed any opinion as to who that other person may have
  been?"</p>

  <p>"I have not. At present I have no evidence pointing to any particular
  person."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner. "I hope you will now take up this further
  question, and that your efforts will be as successful in this as in the
  problem which you have solved in such a remarkable manner. Is there any
  question that any member of the jury would like to ask?"</p>

  <p>Apparently there was not. Accordingly Thorndyke returned to his seat and
  the name of Francis Horridge was called. And, as he walked up to the table, I
  was once more impressed by his extraordinarily agitated and shaken condition.
  It was noticed also by the coroner, who, before beginning his examination,
  offered a few words of sympathy.</p>

  <p>"This, Mr. Horridge," said he, "must be a very painful and distressing
  experience for you, as an intimate friend of the deceased."</p>

  <p>"It is," replied Horridge. "I had not the faintest suspicion that my old
  friend was not alive and well. It has been a terrible shock."</p>

  <p>"It must have been," the coroner agreed, "and I am sorry to have to
  trouble you with questions. But we have to solve this dreadful mystery if we
  can, or at least find out as much as possible about it. You have seen the
  body of deceased. Could you identify it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is the body of Daniel Penrose."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner, "there seems to be no doubt as to the identity of
  the body. Now, Mr. Horridge, the medical evidence makes it clear that
  deceased met his death by the act of some unknown person. It is very
  necessary to discover, if possible, who that person is. You were an intimate
  friend of deceased and must know a good deal about his personal affairs. Do
  you know of anything that might throw any light on the circumstances
  surrounding his death?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the reply. "But I did not know so very much about his personal
  habits or his friends and acquaintances."</p>

  <p>"I understand that deceased had made a will. Do you know anything about
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I am the executor of his will."</p>

  <p>"Then you can tell us whether there was anything in connection with it
  which might give rise to trouble or enmity. In rough, general terms what are
  the provisions of the will?"</p>

  <p>"They are quite simple. There is a handsome, but well-deserved legacy to
  his butler, Kickweed, amounting to two thousand pounds. Beyond that, the bulk
  of the property is devised and bequeathed to me."</p>

  <p>"So you and Mr. Kickweed are the persons who benefit most in a pecuniary
  sense by the death of deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; and I am sure we should both very gladly forgo the benefit to have
  our friend back again."</p>

  <p>"I am sure you would," said the coroner. "But can you tell us if there are
  any other persons who would benefit materially in any way by the death of
  deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there are," replied Horridge. "Quite recently, deceased's father
  died and left a considerable fortune. If deceased had been alive at that
  time, the bulk of that fortune would have come to him. As it is, it will be
  distributed among his next of kin. Consequently, those persons will benefit
  very considerably by deceased's death if that death occurred on the date
  given by Dr. Thorndyke. I do not know who they are; and, of course, I do not
  suspect any of them of being concerned in this crime."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," the coroner agreed. "But one naturally looks round for
  some persons who might have had a motive for making away with deceased. But
  you know of no such persons? You do not know of any one with whom deceased
  was on terms of enmity or who had any sort of grudge against him?"</p>

  <p>"No. So far as I know, he had no enemies whatever. He was not likely to
  have any. He was a kindly man and on pleasant terms with every one with whom
  he came in contact."</p>

  <p>"May the same be said of us all when our time comes," the coroner
  moralised. "But there is another motive that we ought to consider. That of
  robbery. Do you know whether deceased was in the habit of carrying about with
  him&mdash;on his person I mean&mdash;property of any considerable value?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," replied Horridge. "He must have done so at times, for he
  was a great collector and was in the habit of going about the country making
  purchases. I had supposed that his last journey was made with that object,
  and I am disposed to think so still. He used to come down to this
  neighbourhood to visit a dealer named Todd who has a shop at Canterbury."</p>

  <p>"You say that he was a collector. What kind of things did he collect?"</p>

  <p>"It was a very miscellaneous collection, but I have always believed that,
  in addition to the oddments that were displayed in the main gallery, he had a
  collection of jewels of much more considerable value which were kept in a
  small room. That room was always kept locked, and deceased would never say
  definitely what it contained."</p>

  <p>Here Horridge gave a description of the small room as we had seen it on
  the occasion of our visit of inspection, and he also gave an account of the
  supposed burglary, to which the coroner&mdash;and Superintendent
  Miller&mdash;listened with profound interest.</p>

  <p>"This," said the former, "seems to be a matter of some importance. What is
  the precise date on which the supposed burglary took place?"</p>

  <p>"The second of last January."</p>

  <p>"That," said the coroner, "would be nearly three months after the death of
  deceased, if Dr. Thorndyke is correct as to the date on which that death
  occurred. And you say that, if the cupboard was opened, it must have been
  opened with its own proper key, since the lock is unpickable and the cupboard
  had not been broken open. Is there any reason to believe that the cupboard
  was actually opened?"</p>

  <p>"I think there is," replied Horridge. "It is certain that some one entered
  the room on that night, and it is practically certain that he entered the
  premises by the side gate, as there is no other way of approaching the
  window. But that gate was always kept locked, and it was found to be locked
  on the morning after the supposed burglary. So it seems that the burglar must
  have had the key of the gate, at least."</p>

  <p>"And who usually had possession of that key?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Penrose. It seems that he sometimes used that gate and he kept the
  key in his own possession. There was no duplicate."</p>

  <p>"When you went to the mortuary to identify the body, did you look over the
  effects of deceased which had been taken from the pockets?"</p>

  <p>"No; but I asked the coroner's officer if any keys had been found and he
  told me that there had not."</p>

  <p>The coroner nodded gravely and Miller remarked to me in a whisper that we
  were beginning to see daylight.</p>

  <p>"It is unfortunate," the former observed, "that we have no clear evidence
  as to whether a burglary did or did not take place. However, that is really a
  matter for the police. But the question is highly significant in relation to
  the problem of the motive for killing deceased. Do you know whether, apart
  from this burglary, there were any attempts to rob deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Horridge; "but I think it was only a chance affair.
  Deceased told me on one occasion that his car had been stopped on a rather
  solitary road by a gang of men who were armed with revolvers and who made him
  deliver up what money he had about him. But, apparently, his loss was only
  trifling as he had nothing of value with him at the time."</p>

  <p>This concluded Horridge's evidence; and when the coroner's officer, who
  turned out to be the police sergeant whom I had met, had deposed to having
  examined the contents of deceased's pockets and found no keys among them, the
  name of Edward Kickweed was called.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-16"
     id="ch2-16"></a>XVI. &mdash; MR. KICKWEED SURPRISES THE CORONER</h2>

  <p class="first">THE evidence given by our friend, Horridge, had been
  listened to with keen interest, not only by the coroner and the jury, but
  especially by Superintendent Miller. For, though it comprised nothing that we
  did not already know, it had elicited the important fact that the body of
  Penrose had apparently been rifled of his keys. But striking and significant
  as this fact was, it was left to Kickweed to contribute the really
  sensational item of evidence.</p>

  <p>But this came later. The early part of his evidence seemed to be little
  more than a series of formalities, confirming what had already been proved.
  When he took his place at the table, his lugubrious aspect drew from the
  coroner a kindly expression of sympathy similar to that with which he had
  greeted Horridge, after which he proceeded with his examination.</p>

  <p>"You have seen the body which is lying in the mortuary, Mr. Kickweed. Were
  you able to identify it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," groaned Kickweed. "It is the body of my esteemed and beloved
  employer, Mr. Daniel Penrose."</p>

  <p>"How long had you known deceased?"</p>

  <p>"I have known him practically all his life. I was in his father's service
  and when he grew up and took a house of his own, he asked me to come to him
  as butler. So I came gladly, and have been with him ever since."</p>

  <p>"Then you probably know a good deal about his manner of life and the
  people he knew. Can you tell us whether there was any one who might have had
  any feelings of enmity towards him?"</p>

  <p>"There was not," Kickweed replied confidently. "Deceased was a rather
  self-contained man, but he was a kind, courteous and generous man and I am
  sure that he had not an enemy in the world."</p>

  <p>"You confirm Mr. Horridge's estimate," said the coroner, "and a very
  satisfactory one it is; and it seems to dispose of revenge or malice as the
  motive for killing him. By the way, it is not of much consequence, but do you
  recognise these objects?"</p>

  <p>Here he took from behind his chair the spade and trenching tool which we
  had found in the wood and laid them on the table for Kickweed's
  inspection.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the witness, "they belonged to deceased. He used to keep them
  in the garage. I am not quite sure what he used them for, but I know that he
  occasionally took them with him when he went out in the country in his
  car."</p>

  <p>"Were you aware that he had taken them with him when he last left
  home?"</p>

  <p>"I was not. But afterwards, when I saw that they were not in their usual
  place, I assumed that he had taken them with him."</p>

  <p>The coroner entered this not very illuminating statement in the
  depositions, and then, noting that the witness's eyes were fixed on the
  pestle which lay on the table, he picked it up, and, holding it towards him,
  said:</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is needless to ask you if you recognise this object?"</p>

  <p>"I do," was the totally unexpected reply. "It belongs to a small bronze
  mortar which forms part of Mr. Penrose's collection."</p>

  <p>"This is very extraordinary!" the coroner exclaimed. "You are sure that
  you recognise it?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly sure," replied Kickweed. "The pestle and mortar stood together
  on a shelf in the great gallery and I have often, when dusting the things in
  the collection, given this pestle and the mortar a rub with the cloth. I know
  it very well indeed."</p>

  <p>"Well," the coroner exclaimed, "this is indeed a surprise! The weapon is
  actually the property of the deceased!"</p>

  <p>There was a short interval of silence, in which I could hear Miller
  cursing softly under his breath.</p>

  <p>"There," he muttered, "is another promising clue gone west!"</p>

  <p>Then the coroner, recovering from his astonishment, resumed his
  examination of the witness.</p>

  <p>"Can you explain by what extraordinary chance deceased came to have this
  thing with him on the day when he was killed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It was his usual custom, when he went out in his car and was likely
  to be on the road late, to slip the pestle in his pocket before he started.
  The custom arose after he had been stopped on the road by robbers, as Mr.
  Horridge has mentioned. I urged him to get a revolver or some other means of
  defending himself. But he had a great dislike of fire-arms, so I suggested a
  life-preserver. But then he happened to see me polishing this pestle, and it
  occurred to him that it would do as well as the life-preserver, and, as he
  said, would be a more interesting thing to carry. So he used to take it with
  him, and he did on this occasion, as I discovered a few days after he had
  gone, when I saw the mortar on the shelf without the pestle."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner, "there is evidently no doubt that this pestle
  really belonged to deceased, and that fact may have a rather important
  bearing on the case."</p>

  <p>He paused, and, having entered Kickweed's last statement in the
  depositions, turned to him once more.</p>

  <p>"Apparently, Mr. Kickweed, of all the persons who knew deceased, you are
  the one who last saw him alive. Can you recall the circumstances of his
  departure from his home?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," the witness replied, "very clearly. At lunch-time on the
  seventeenth of last October, deceased informed me that he should presently be
  starting for a run in the country in his car. He was not sure about the time
  when he would return, but he thought he might be rather late; and he directed
  that no one should sit up for him, but that a cold supper should be left for
  him in the dining-room. He left the house a little before three to go to the
  garage, and, about a quarter of an hour later, I saw him drive past the house
  in his car. That would be about three o'clock."</p>

  <p>"And after that, did you ever see him again?"</p>

  <p>"I never saw him again. I sat up until past midnight, but, of course, he
  never came home."</p>

  <p>"Did you then suspect that any mischance had befallen him?"</p>

  <p>"I was rather uneasy," Kickweed replied, "because he had apparently
  intended to come home. Otherwise, I should not have been, as he often stayed
  away from home without notice."</p>

  <p>"When did you first learn that there was something wrong?"</p>

  <p>"It was in the afternoon of the twentieth of October. Mr. Horridge had
  called to see him, and we were just discussing the possible reasons for his
  staying away when a police officer arrived, carrying deceased's raincoat, and
  told us that deceased had apparently absconded from the hospital at
  Gravesend. And that was all that I ever knew of the matter until I heard Dr.
  Thorndyke's evidence."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the coroner, "to repeat; you saw him drive away on the
  seventeenth of October and you never saw him, or had any knowledge of him,
  again. Is that not so?"</p>

  <p>"I never saw him again. But as to having any further knowledge of him, I
  am rather doubtful. I received a letter from him."</p>

  <p>"You received a letter from him!" the coroner repeated in evident
  surprise. "When did you receive that letter?"</p>

  <p>"It was delivered on the morning of the twenty-seventh of last March."</p>

  <p>A murmur of astonishment arose from the jury and the coroner exclaimed in
  a tone of amazement:</p>

  <p>"Last March! Why, the man had been dead for months!"</p>

  <p>"So it appears," Kickweed admitted; "and I am glad to believe that the
  letter was not really written by him."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

  <p>"Because," Kickweed replied, "it was not a very creditable letter for a
  gentleman of Mr. Penrose's character. It was a foolish letter and not as
  polite as it should have been."</p>

  <p>"Have you that letter about you?"</p>

  <p>"No. I handed it to Dr. Thorndyke, and I believe he has it still. But I
  can remember the substance of its contents. It directed me to lock up the
  small room and deposit the key at Mr. Penrose's bank."</p>

  <p>"And did you do so?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, I did, though Dr. Thorndyke seemed rather opposed to my doing
  so. But, at the time, I supposed it to be a genuine letter from my employer
  and, of course, I had no choice but to carry out his instructions."</p>

  <p>"Have you formed any opinion as to who might have written that
  letter?"</p>

  <p>"No, I have not the faintest idea. Until I heard Dr. Thorndyke's evidence,
  I still supposed it to be a genuine letter from deceased."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner, "it is a most extraordinary affair. I, think we
  had better recall Dr. Thorndyke and hear what he can tell us about it."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, as Kickweed had apparently given all the information that he
  had to give, and no one wished to ask him any questions, he was allowed to
  return to his seat and Thorndyke was recalled.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell us what you know about this very remarkable letter that Mr.
  Kickweed received?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"I first heard of that letter when Mr. Kickweed called at my chambers late
  in the evening of the twenty-seventh of last March. He then informed me that
  he had received that letter and gave it to me to read. I read and examined it
  and at once came to the conclusion that it was a forgery. I took a photograph
  of it&mdash;of which I have a copy here&mdash;and carried the original to Mr.
  Brodribb, deceased's solicitor, to whom I handed it for safe custody and to
  whom I stated my opinion that it was a forgery."</p>

  <p>"You decided at once that the letter was a forgery. What led you to that
  decision?"</p>

  <p>"My decision was based on the circumstances and on the character of the
  letter itself. As to the circumstances, I had by that time formed the very
  definite opinion that Daniel Penrose was dead and that he had died on the
  seventeenth of the previous October. The letter itself presented several
  suspicious features. The matter of it was quite unreasonable and inadequate.
  The room was already locked up and the key was in the very safe custody of
  deceased's trusted and responsible servant, and had been for months. The
  directions in the letter appeared to be merely a pretext for writing and
  suggested some ulterior purpose. Then the manner of the letter was quite out
  of character with that of the supposed writer&mdash;a gentleman addressing
  his confidential servant. It was written in a tone of coarse, jocular
  familiarity with a most ill-mannered caricature of Mr. Kickweed's name. It
  impressed me as a grotesque, overdone attempt to imitate deceased's
  habitually facetious manner of speech. And, on questioning Mr. Kickweed, who
  was obviously hurt and surprised by the rudeness of this letter, I learned
  that deceased had always been in the habit of addressing him in a strictly
  correct and courteous fashion."</p>

  <p>"Apart from these inferences, was there anything visible that marked this
  letter as a forgery?"</p>

  <p>"I did not discover anything. Of the handwriting I could not judge as I
  was not familiar with deceased's writing. But there were no signs of tracing
  or other gross indications of forgery. But I may say that Mr. Brodribb was of
  opinion that the writing did not look, to him, like that of deceased."</p>

  <p>"You say that the matter of this letter suggested to you that a mere
  pretext had been made for writing and that there was some ulterior purpose.
  Can you suggest what that ulterior purpose might have been?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest that its purpose was to make it appear that deceased was
  alive."</p>

  <p>"That seems to imply that the unknown writer of the letter knew that he
  was dead, though no one but yourself had any suspicion that he was not still
  alive. There would seem to be no object in trying to prove that a man was
  alive when nobody supposed that he was dead. Don't you agree?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke; "that seems to be the natural inference."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you cannot offer any suggestion as to who the writer of the
  letter may have been?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot. It seems clear that whoever he may have been, he must have been
  well acquainted with deceased, for the phraseology of the letter, although
  greatly exaggerated, was a recognisable imitation of deceased's rather odd
  manner of expressing himself. But I cannot give him a name."</p>

  <p>"There was one matter that we overlooked when you were giving your
  evidence. You ascertained in some mysterious manner that deceased was buried
  in Julliberrie's Grave. But is that the place where he met his death, or was
  his body brought from some other place?"</p>

  <p>"I should say that there is no doubt that he was killed close to the place
  where his body was found. The implements which we found in the wood and which
  have been identified as his property suggest very strongly that he came to
  Julliberrie's Grave of his own accord with the intention of searching for
  antiquities for his collection. Probably he had actually done some excavation
  in the mound and the cavity that he had dug offered the facilities for
  disposing of his body. And the finding of the weapon with which he was
  apparently killed, near to the body, supports this view."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner, "I think you have made it clear that the death
  occurred in the neighbourhood of the barrow and that the body was not brought
  there from a distance. And that, I think, gives us all the evidence that we
  need."</p>

  <p>He bowed to Thorndyke, and, as the latter returned to his seat, he began a
  brief and very sensible summing up.</p>

  <p>"The disappearance of Mr. Daniel Penrose involves a long and complicated
  story. But with that story we are not concerned. This is a coroner's inquest;
  and the function of such an inquiry is to answer certain questions relating
  to a dead body which has been found within our jurisdiction. Those questions
  are: Who is the dead person? and where, when and by what means did deceased
  meet with his death? We are not concerned with the person, if any, who caused
  the death of deceased unless such person should be plainly and evidently in
  view. We have to decide whether or not a crime has been committed, but it is
  not our function to bring that crime home to any particular person. That duty
  appertains to the police.</p>

  <p>"Now, in respect of those questions which I have mentioned, we have no
  difficulty. The evidence which we have heard enables us to answer them quite
  confidently. The body has been identified as that of a gentleman named Daniel
  Penrose; and it has been clearly proved that he met his death at a place
  called Julliberrie's Grave on the seventeenth of last October and that his
  death was caused by violence inflicted by some unknown person. These are
  matters of fact which have been proved; and the only question which you have
  to decide is that of the nature of the act by which the death was caused.
  Deceased was killed by a heavy blow on the head inflicted with a bronze
  pestle. The person who struck that blow killed deceased and, therefore,
  undeniably committed an act of homicide. But there are many kinds of
  homicide, varying in their degree of culpability. A man may justifiably kill
  another in defence of his own life. Then there is no crime. Or he may kill
  another quite accidentally, when, again, there is no crime. Or he may kill
  another in the course of a struggle, by violence which was not intended to
  cause death. Here the act of homicide amounts only to manslaughter; and the
  degree of criminality will depend on the particular circumstances. Again, a
  man may kill another with the deliberate and considered intention of killing
  him&mdash;that is with what the law calls malice. Such deliberate and
  premeditated killing constitutes wilful murder.</p>

  <p>"Now, in the present case, we have to consider the circumstances in which
  the death of deceased occurred; and of those circumstances we have very
  imperfect knowledge. A striking fact is that the weapon with which deceased
  was killed was his own property and must, apparently, have been brought to
  the place by himself. We have learned, also, that he habitually carried this
  weapon for the purpose of self-defence. There is thus the suggestion that he
  may have so used it on the occasion when he was killed. That is to say, there
  is a distinct suggestion of a struggle, and the actual possibility that
  deceased may have been the aggressor, killed by the unknown in
  self-defence.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand, the unknown, having killed deceased, buried the body
  secretly and hurried away from the place&mdash;incidentally killing another
  person on his way&mdash;and has since given no information and made no sign,
  unless we assume that the very mysterious letter that Mr. Kickweed received
  emanated from him. And it is, perhaps, worth while to give that letter a
  brief consideration, as it seems to have some bearing on the question which
  we are trying to decide.</p>

  <p>"Who was the writer of that letter and for what purpose was the letter
  written? From Dr. Thorndyke we learn that the writer must have been some
  person who was well acquainted with deceased. That is an important matter,
  but we are not concerned with the actual identity of the writer. We are
  concerned with his connection with the death of deceased; and that connection
  seems to be suggested by the purpose of the letter. That purpose seems to be
  indicated quite clearly by Dr. Thorndyke. It was to create the belief that
  deceased was still alive. But nobody&mdash;excepting the doctor&mdash;had any
  doubt that he was alive. No suggestion had been made by anybody that he might
  be dead. Then why should the writer of this letter have sought to create a
  belief which was already universally held? The only possible answer seems to
  be that he, himself, knew that deceased was dead and he wished, in the
  interests of his own safety, to forestall any suspicions that might arise
  that deceased might be dead.</p>

  <p>"Thus the consideration of this letter suggests to us, first, that the
  writer knew that deceased was dead, and, second, that he had reasons for
  desiring that the fact of the death should not become known or suspected. But
  the fact of the death could have been known only to the person who killed
  deceased; and his anxiety to conceal the fact suggests strongly that he had
  no reasonable defence if he should be charged with the murder of
  deceased.</p>

  <p>"That, I think, is all that I need say. Deceased was evidently killed by
  some unknown person; and it is for you to decide whether the circumstances,
  so far as they are known to us, suggest excusable homicide, accidental
  homicide, manslaughter, or wilful murder."</p>

  <p>On the conclusion of the summing up, the jury consulted together for a few
  minutes. Then the foreman announced that they had agreed on their
  finding.</p>

  <p>"And what decision have you arrived at?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"We find that the deceased was murdered by some person unknown."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner, "I think that it is the only reasonable
  conclusion at which you could have arrived. I will record a verdict of wilful
  murder by some person unknown, and we may hope that the police will presently
  be able to discover who that unknown person is and bring him to justice."</p>

  <p>He entered the verdict in the depositions and this brought the proceedings
  to an end.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-17"
     id="ch2-17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THORNDYKE RETRACES THE TRAIL</h2>

  <p class="first">As the court rose and we all stood up, Miller turned on me
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>"You never told me about that letter," he exclaimed; "and there was not a
  word about it in the synopsis that the doctor gave me."</p>

  <p>"As to me," said I, "there is no question of reservations. I did not refer
  to it because I had not regarded it as having any particular bearing on the
  case."</p>

  <p>"No bearing!" exclaimed Miller. "Why, it hits you in the face. But if you
  think it has no bearing, I'll warrant that is not the doctor's view."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," I replied, "I don't know what his views are, but he is here
  and can answer for himself."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, "what about it, Doctor? You knew about that letter
  and you must know quite well who wrote it and why he wrote it."</p>

  <p>"Now, Miller," said Thorndyke, "don't let us misuse words. We don't know
  who wrote that letter. We may have our opinions, and they may be
  right&mdash;or wrong. But in any case they will be pretty difficult to turn
  into evidence."</p>

  <p>"I suspect you have done that already," grumbled Miller, "and you are
  keeping that evidence to yourself."</p>

  <p>"You are quite wrong," Thorndyke replied. "I have no evidence beyond the
  facts which are known to you. Actually, I have given very little attention to
  the letter. It threw no light on the problem which I was trying to solve;
  whether Penrose was alive or dead, and, if he was dead, where we might look
  for his body."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought it was highly relevant." Miller objected. "If it
  was good enough for some one to forge a letter to prove that Penrose was
  alive, when nobody supposed otherwise, that would suggest pretty strongly
  that the forger knew he was dead."</p>

  <p>"So it would," Thorndyke agreed, "but that was of no use to me. I was not
  out for opinions or beliefs but for demonstrable facts."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Miller, "you have produced your demonstrable facts all right,
  and you have solved your problem. And now, I suppose, you are going on to the
  next problem: Who murdered Daniel Penrose? And the solution of that problem
  is to be found in that letter; and as we are both working to the same end, I
  think you ought to put me in possession of any facts that are known to
  you."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Miller," Thorndyke protested, "I have no facts respecting
  this letter that are not known to you. I will hand you the photograph, and
  you can have an enlargement if you want to employ handwriting experts, or you
  can have the original. That is all I can do for you."</p>

  <p>He produced his letter-case, and, taking the photograph of the forged
  letter from it, handed it to Miller, who slipped it into his wallet and
  buried the latter in the depths of an internal pocket. As he did so he looked
  round sharply and exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, Mr. Horridge? Are you not feeling well, sir?"</p>

  <p>I looked at our friend, who seemed to be groping his way towards the door,
  and certainly the inquiry was justified. His aspect was ghastly. His face was
  blanched to a tallowy white, his hands trembled visibly, and he had the
  dazed, bewildered appearance suggestive of a severe mental shock.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied unsteadily. "I am not feeling at all well. This awful
  affair has been too much for me. It was all so horrible and so
  unexpected."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Miller agreed sympathetically. "I expect it has given you a bad
  shake-up. Better come along with me to the bar and have a good stiff whisky.
  Don't you think so, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I think," replied Thorndyke, "that a hot meal and a glass of wine would
  be better, if Mr. Horridge is returning to town this evening."</p>

  <p>"I am," said Horridge, "but I couldn't look at food just now. Besides, my
  train is due in less than half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Well, then," urged Miller, "come along to the bar and have a good stiff
  drink. That will pick you up and fit you for the journey home. I happen to be
  going by that train, myself, so I can see you safely to Charing Cross, and
  into a cab if necessary."</p>

  <p>I think Horridge would sooner have been without the proffered escort, but
  Miller left him no choice, and accordingly allowed himself passively to be
  led away in the direction of the bar.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke watched the two men disapprovingly as they passed out, and when
  they had disappeared, he remarked:</p>

  <p>"I am afraid Miller is going to be a nuisance to us. His activity is
  premature."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "he is in full cry after Horridge and he thinks that he
  is on a hot trail. Obviously, he is convinced that Horridge wrote that
  letter, and I think he is right."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that he is," said Thorndyke. "The obvious purpose of that
  letter was to create evidence that Penrose was alive after Oliver's death,
  and so would inherit his property. But it would be impossible to prove that
  Horridge wrote it."</p>

  <p>"So it may be," said I. "But Miller has got him at a disadvantage, and he
  is going to push his opportunity for all that it is worth. If he lets on that
  he is a police officer, Horridge will probably collapse altogether. He is in
  a fearful state of panic."</p>

  <p>"And well he may be," Thorndyke rejoined, "if he wrote that letter. For,
  quite apart from the suggestion of guilty knowledge that it offers, the mere
  writing and uttering of that letter is a serious crime. It is a forgery in
  the fullest sense. It was done with intent to deceive, and the purpose of the
  deception was grossly fraudulent. If Miller can frighten him into an
  admission of having written the letter, he will be absolutely certain of
  securing a conviction."</p>

  <p>"On the charge of forgery," said I. "But that is not Miller's objective.
  You heard what he said. He is all out on the capital charge."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I realise that," said Thorndyke. "Which is why I say that he is
  going to be a nuisance to us. Because he won't be able to prove his case and
  he will have set up a disturbance just at the moment when what is needed is a
  little masterly inactivity combined with careful observation. It is a pity
  that Miller will not trust us more. He will butt in when the case is not
  ready for police methods. However, I am glad he is not travelling up with us.
  His eagerness to acquire knowledge becomes rather fatiguing."</p>

  <p>"We are not going up by that train, then?"</p>

  <p>"No. We may as well have a little early dinner and take the motor omnibus
  to Canterbury."</p>

  <p>We adopted this plan, and, after a comfortable and restful meal, caught
  the omnibus and were duly deposited in the main street of Canterbury, not far
  from the cathedral. As we proceeded thence towards the station, we noticed an
  "antique" shop, the fascia of which bore the single word "Todd."</p>

  <p>"This," I remarked, halting to glance at the antiquities&mdash;mostly of
  the prehistoric type&mdash;which were displayed in the window, "seems to be
  the shop that Horridge referred to as a favourite resort of poor Penrose.
  Probably some of the things that we saw in the collection came from
  here."</p>

  <p>"One of them almost certainly did," said Thorndyke. "Don't you remember
  that Saxon brooch? The entry in the catalogue noted its origin as 'Sweeney's
  Resurrection.'"</p>

  <p>"I remember the entry, now you mention it. Lockhart suggested that
  'Sweeney' probably meant Todd, and apparently he was right."</p>

  <p>We went on our way, discussing the late Daniel Penrose and his harmless
  oddities, of which I had been so intolerant, and eventually reached the
  station in time to select our compartment at our leisure. There were few
  passengers besides ourselves, so that we were able to secure a first-class
  smoking-compartment of which we were the sole occupants, a matter to which I
  attended with some anxiety. For the train ran through to Charing Cross
  without a stop, and the long, uninterrupted journey would afford an
  opportunity for certain explanations which I felt were now overdue. With this
  view Thorndyke apparently agreed, for, when I presently opened my examination
  with a tentative question, he replied quite freely, without a sign of his
  customary reticence and evasiveness.</p>

  <p>"Of course," I began, "when Penrose's body was found, I realised at once,
  in general terms, how I had managed to miss the essential points of the case.
  The possibility that Penrose might be dead never occurred to me; and it
  ought. It looks obvious enough now. But still I don't quite see how you
  contrived to establish the fact of his death&mdash;which you evidently
  did&mdash;and locate the place of his burial."</p>

  <p>"It was all very hypothetical," he replied, "even up to the last stage.
  Until Elmhurst reported the discovery I was not certain that my theory of the
  course of events might not contain some fallacy that I had overlooked. Hence
  my rather elaborate provisions to cover up a possible failure. But to come
  back to your own case; the initial mistake that you made was in disregarding
  the good old Spencerian principle that when certain facts are presented as
  proving a particular thesis, we should consider, not only that which is
  presented, but that, also, which is not presented. In other words, we should
  at once separate fact from inference.</p>

  <p>"Now, when Brodribb gave us his narrative of the disappearance of Penrose,
  he honestly believed that his story was a recital of facts; whereas it was
  really a mixture of fact and inference. It had not occurred to him that the
  hospital patient might be some person other than Penrose, and he accordingly
  presented that patient as Penrose. And you accepted that presentation as a
  statement of fact, whereas it was only an inference. Hence you made a false
  start and got on the wrong track from the beginning.</p>

  <p>"I was fortunate enough to avoid this pitfall; for even while Brodribb was
  telling us his story, I made a mental note that the identity of the patient
  had been taken for granted, and that it would have to be considered, before
  any action could be taken. But as soon as I began to consider the question,
  it became clear to me that the balance of probability was against the
  patient's being Penrose."</p>

  <p>"Did it really?" I exclaimed. "Now, I should have said that all the known
  facts pointed to his being Penrose. And so it seems to me still."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "let us argue the question. We will take two
  hypotheses: A, that the patient was Penrose; and B, that he was some other
  person, and examine the evidence in support of each.</p>

  <p>"Let us begin with hypothesis A. What evidence was there that the patient
  was Daniel Penrose?</p>

  <p>"There were five principal items of evidence. 1. The car was certainly
  Penrose's car. 2. The patient had been in possession of that car. 3. The
  coat, which was undeniably the patient's coat, had Penrose's driving licence
  in its pocket. 4. The initials on the patient's collar were Penrose's
  initials. 5. A fragment of an ancient object was found in the pocket of the
  patient's coat. But Penrose was a collector of antiquities and there was
  reason to believe that he had gone out that day for the purpose of acquiring
  some such objects.</p>

  <p>"Now, you will notice that the first three items are what we may call
  extrinsic. They afford no evidence of personal identity. They merely prove
  that the patient was in possession of Penrose's property, and they are thus
  of very little weight. The other two items we may call intrinsic. They are
  connected with the actual personality of the patient.</p>

  <p>"Of these, the initials on the collar furnished by far the more weighty
  evidence of identity."</p>

  <p>"I should have assumed them to be quite conclusive," said I.</p>

  <p>"Then you would have been wrong," he replied, "for you would have been
  assuming that Penrose was the only man in the world whose initials were D. P.
  Still, the fact that the patient's initials were D. P. established a very
  high probability that he was Daniel Penrose."</p>

  <p>"I should have put it higher than that," said I. "It would have seemed to
  me as nearly as possible a certainty. For if he were not Penrose the
  coincidence would be, as it was, such an amazing one."</p>

  <p>"I think you exaggerate the abnormality," he rejoined. "It was a very
  remarkable coincidence; but there are two things that we should bear in mind.
  First, the adverse chances were not so enormous as you seem to imply. There
  are great numbers of men whose initials are D. P. And, secondly, that the
  laws of probability relate to large numbers. They must be applied with great
  caution to particular cases. The tendency to assume that because a thing is
  improbable, it will not happen, is a mistake. Improbabilities and
  coincidences are constantly occurring, and we have to allow for that
  fact.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, it had to be admitted that those initials made it, in a
  very high degree, probable that the patient was Daniel Penrose. But now let
  us take the alternative hypothesis and see what the probabilities were on the
  other side. And first, consider the conduct of the patient. Owing to his
  black eyes and contused face, he was completely unrecognisable. Nobody could
  form any idea what he was like. But when his injuries cleared up he would
  have been recognisable; and the extraordinary and determined way in which he
  absconded from the hospital at a carefully-chosen time, is very suggestive.
  Evidently, during his simulated unconsciousness, he had been watching for an
  opportunity to get away at night when his odd appearance would be less
  observed. His behaviour was like that of a man who sought to escape before
  recognition should be possible.</p>

  <p>"Then, there was the man's previous behaviour. Apparently he had abandoned
  his car. But a car which is abandoned is usually a stolen car. Again, the car
  which killed the old woman was being driven wildly and furiously. We knew
  then of no reason why Penrose should have been driving in that manner. But a
  stranger in unlawful possession of a car would probably have sufficient
  reasons; and in fact, persons who steal cars usually do drive furiously.
  Then, if Penrose had knocked down the old woman he would probably have
  stopped and reported the accident. He was a responsible, decent gentleman and
  there was no reason why he should not have stopped. But a stranger, in
  possession of a stolen car&mdash;in effect, a fugitive&mdash;could not afford
  to stop and be interviewed.</p>

  <p>"Furthermore, if this man had been in unlawful possession of a car,
  something must have happened to the owner of that car at some place. The
  stranger would have good reasons for getting away from that neighbourhood as
  quickly as possible. Thus, the furious driving both before and after the
  accident would be sufficiently explained.</p>

  <p>"So, looking at the case as a whole, you will see that, on the assumption
  that the patient was Penrose, his conduct was utterly unreasonable and
  inexplicable; on the assumption that he was not Penrose, his behaviour was in
  every respect exactly what we should have expected it to be. For if he was
  not Penrose, he was under strong suspicion of having made away with Penrose,
  for the reasons: 1. That Penrose had unaccountably disappeared, and; 2. That
  the stranger was in possession of Penrose's car and his driving licence.
  Taking all the facts together, I came to the conclusion that, in spite of the
  initials, the balance of probability was against his being Penrose.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, those initials presented a formidable objection to the view
  that I was disposed to adopt, and I decided that the question whether they
  were Penrose's initials or those of some other person must be settled before
  any further investigation would be worth while. It was not a difficult
  question to dispose of, and it turned out to be easier than I had expected.
  You remember how we obtained the answer?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I don't," I replied. "I never knew that the question had been
  raised."</p>

  <p>"You never followed this case very closely, for some reason," said
  Thorndyke, "but if you will recall our visit to the garage, you will remember
  that I was able, quite easily, to extract a statement from Kickweed which
  settled the question definitely.</p>

  <p>"We learned from him that Penrose was in the habit of marking all his
  portable property, including his collars and handkerchiefs, with his name, D.
  Penrose, by means of a rubber stamp."</p>

  <p>I grinned rather sheepishly. "I remember quite well now you mention it,
  but I am afraid that, at the time, I merely wondered, like a fool, why you
  were going into such trivialities at such length."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Thorndyke, "you will now see that our conversation with
  Kickweed cleared up all our difficulties. Penrose's collars were marked 'D.
  Penrose' with a rubber stamp; the patient's collar was marked 'D. P.' with a
  marking-ink pencil. Therefore, the evidence of the collar supported all the
  other evidence; it went to prove that the patient was not Penrose.</p>

  <p>"Then, at once, arose two other questions: If he was not Penrose, who was
  he? And what had become of Penrose? The first question had to be left until
  we had answered the second. Penrose had disappeared. What had happened to
  him? Was he alive or dead?</p>

  <p>"Now, having regard to the strange and sinister circumstances: the
  disappearance of one man, the appearance of another man in possession of his
  property and the anxiety of that other man to escape without being
  identified, there was only one reasonable conclusion that we could come to.
  The overwhelming probability was that Penrose was dead and that his body had
  been concealed by burial or otherwise.</p>

  <p>"Adopting this view, as I did, the next questions were: Where did Penrose
  meet his death? And where was his body concealed? The latter question was the
  more important, but the answer to both was probably the same. And both
  questions were contained in the further question: From what place did the car
  start on that wild journey home?</p>

  <p>"Now, in regard to this problem&mdash;the starting-point of the car's
  journey&mdash;we had two clues, and they were both very imperfect. The place
  where the woman was killed was in the Canterbury district and the car was
  travelling via Maidstone towards Gravesend. But the speed at which it was
  travelling made it difficult to judge how far it might have come, especially
  as we had no exact information as to the time at which it started. All that
  we knew was that the car advanced towards the Canterbury-Ashford road from
  some place to the south and east.</p>

  <p>"The other clue was the very distinctive pottery fragment. But this also
  was a very ambiguous clue. The pocket in which we found it was not Penrose's
  pocket; and we did not know how long it had been in that pocket. However,
  when we came to examine these difficulties, they did not appear insuperable.
  Thus, notwithstanding that the fragment was in another man's possession, I
  was disposed to associate it with Penrose for two reasons; first, that
  Penrose was a collector of antiquities, and, second, that, when he started
  from home, he took with him&mdash;as we learned from Kickweed&mdash;two
  digging tools and was, apparently, intending to do some sort of excavation.
  As to the second difficulty, the earth in which the fragment was embedded was
  of the same kind as that which we scraped from the coat and that which we
  found later on the car. So it appeared practically certain that the fragment
  was the product of that day's digging.</p>

  <p>"The next question was: Whence had that fragment come? That was a vitally
  important question; for there could be little doubt that the place where that
  fragment was dug up was the place where Penrose had met his death and where
  his body was concealed. But how was that question to be answered? It seemed
  that the only possible method was that which I had adopted in regard to the
  other questions; to form a working hypothesis and see whither it led. Now,
  the broken edges of the fragment showed fresh fractures. It had been broken
  off the pot at the time of the excavation; and as the digging had probably
  been done after dark, by a very imperfect light, the fragment had apparently
  been overlooked, the new fracture of the pot being mistaken for an ancient
  one. It followed that, somewhere, there was a broken pot with a space in it
  corresponding to this fragment, by which it could infallibly be recognised.
  If we could find that pot it would-probably be possible to ascertain where it
  had been dug up.</p>

  <p>"But where were we to look for that pot? The only possible place known to
  us was Penrose's collection; and circumstances created an initial probability
  that it was there. But, further, I had a theory, as I mentioned to you, that
  the expedition on which Penrose had embarked that day possibly had the
  express purpose of recovering this fragment to make the imperfect pot
  complete. Accordingly, I took an opportunity of inspecting the collection,
  and I took with me my invaluable box of moulding wax.</p>

  <p>"You know the result. The pot was there, easily recognisable at sight and
  conclusively identified by the wax squeeze. There was also a catalogue entry,
  presumably describing the piece and recording the source whence it had been
  obtained. But the wording of the entry was so obscure as to present a fresh
  puzzle. Nevertheless, it was a great advance; for the information was there,
  if we could only extract the meanings of the words.</p>

  <p>"Those words were, you will remember: 'Moulin a vent; Julie; Polly.' Now,
  the first term was obvious enough; the piece was a 'Windmill Hill' pot. By
  the study of other entries in the catalogue, I reached the conclusion that
  'Julie' probably represented the locality, and 'Polly' the person from whom
  the pot was obtained. Accordingly, the first thing to be done was to
  ascertain, if possible, the meaning of the word 'Julie.'</p>

  <p>"To this end, I procured and read various works dealing with neolithic
  pottery; and, since our pot had almost certainly been dug out of a long
  barrow, I gave attention to those also. But the result, for a time, was very
  disappointing. I read through quite a large number of books and papers on
  barrows and pottery without meeting with any name resembling "Julie." At
  last, I struck the clue in Jessup's Archeology of Kent. There, in the chapter
  dealing with neolithic remains, I found a reference to a long barrow known as
  Julliberrie's Grave, in the neighbourhood of Chilham. Looking it up on the
  ordnance map, I saw at once that its situation fitted the circumstances
  exactly, for it was quite close to the known track of the car. Thereupon I
  decided that Julliberrie's Grave was almost certainly the place for which I
  had been searching, the starting-point of the car's wild career and the place
  in which the body of Daniel Penrose was probably reposing.</p>

  <p>"The question then arose: What was to be done? I had not a particle of
  definite evidence to support my belief. My whole case was just a train of
  hypothetical reasoning&mdash;guess-work, if you will; and guess-work was not
  good enough either for the Home Office or the Office of Works. Besides, as
  you acutely observed, I didn't want to let the cat out of the bag
  prematurely. Yet it was impossible to get any further in the investigation
  until the barrow had been explored.</p>

  <p>"There was only one thing to do&mdash;to organise a scientific excavation
  of the barrow by skilled and trained archaeologists. That would ensure an
  absolutely exhaustive exploration without injury to the barrow and without
  any disclosure of my suspicions if they should prove to be unfounded.
  Accordingly, I looked up our invaluable friend, Elmhurst, and, to my great
  satisfaction, found that he had both the means and the will to carry out the
  excavation if I were prepared to finance the work.</p>

  <p>"You know the rest. Everything went according to plan and the first stage
  of our investigation was brought to a triumphant conclusion. I only hope that
  the second stage will go as well. It ought to; for we have now a solid
  foundation of established fact to build on."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed. "We know that Penrose is dead and that somebody killed
  him. But I don't see much of a lead towards the conclusion as to who that
  somebody may have been. But I expect that you do. Perhaps the word 'Polly' in
  that ridiculous catalogue entry, suggests something to you. Apparently, it
  refers to a person, though it is hardly safe to say even that. The only thing
  that is certain is that it doesn't mean Polly."</p>

  <p>"The meaning of that word," he replied, "really belongs to the second
  stage of our inquiry, on which we are now embarking; the identification of
  the person whom we may call 'the murderer'&mdash;though the fact of murder is
  not established. Penrose was killed with his own weapon, which, as the
  coroner justly observed, suggests a struggle or conflict. But as to the
  identity of that person, I have not yet formed a definite opinion. There is
  one essential question that has to be settled before we begin to theorise. We
  have got to know whether the alleged burglary at Queen Square was an actual
  burglary and whether the cupboard in the small room was actually opened."</p>

  <p>"You mean," said I, "that, if the cupboard was opened, it must have been
  opened with Penrose's keys, as you have always maintained, and that,
  therefore, the person who opened it must have been the murderer."</p>

  <p>"I would hardly go as far as that," he replied. "If some person did
  actually enter that room and open the cupboard, he must have opened it with
  Penrose's keys or with duplicates made from them. That would suggest that he
  was either the murderer or in league with the murderer. But even if he opened
  the cupboard, that would not be conclusive evidence that he stole the jewels.
  He might have found the cupboard empty. That is not probable, but it has to
  be borne in mind. And then we have to remember that the only evidence of the
  room's having been entered is the unsupported statement of one person."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, "and not an entirely unsuspected person. Our friend,
  Horridge, seems to have had considerable misgivings as to the discreet and
  melancholy Kickweed; but I didn't think that you had any suspicions in that
  direction."</p>

  <p>"I don't say that I have," replied Thorndyke, "or that I entertain
  seriously the various possibilities that I have mentioned. I am merely
  pointing out that we have got a good many eggs in our basket. A sensible man
  keeps in his mind all the possibilities, no matter how remote; but he also
  gives his special attention, in the first place, to those that are least
  remote. And, meanwhile, we have got to begin our quest by settling definitely
  whether that cupboard has or has not been opened. We have very little doubt
  as to what was in it when Penrose was alive, and Lockhart will now have to
  make an explicit statement. If the things are not there, we shall have a
  definite fact and can consider what follows from it; and if we find the
  collection intact&mdash;well, I shall be very much surprised."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-18"
     id="ch2-18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; THE OPENING OF THE SAFE</h2>

  <p class="first">On suitable occasions, Thorndyke could lie remarkably low
  and exhibit a most masterly inactivity.</p>

  <p>But also, on suitable occasions he could act with surprising promptitude.
  And the matter of the alleged burglary at Queen Square presented such an
  occasion. Armed with an authority from Mr. Brodribb, as joint executor, he
  proceeded to call on Chubbs and make all necessary arrangements for the
  opening of the safe in the small room; and then, as I gathered, he had an
  interview with Lockhart. What passed at that interview I did not learn, but I
  suspect that there was some rather plain speaking. Not that it should have
  been necessary, for Lockhart was a lawyer and knew in what a very
  questionable position he stood. But whatever passed on that occasion, he was
  quite amenable. He frankly admitted that he had seen in the small room a
  collection of jewels which were almost certainly the Billington jewels, and
  he gave Thorndyke a written statement to that effect. Further, he wrote a
  letter to Miller, in somewhat ambiguous terms, referring him to Thorndyke for
  fuller particulars, and agreed to be present when the safe was opened.</p>

  <p>Naturally, this letter brought Miller, hotfoot, to our chambers, and a
  preliminary discussion was unavoidable in spite of Thorndyke's efforts to
  stave it off.</p>

  <p>"Now, Doctor," the superintendent began a little truculently, "this is the
  sort of thing that I was complaining of. You knew those jewels were there,
  but you didn't let on the faintest hint to me."</p>

  <p>"I did not know," Thorndyke protested. "I only suspected; and I don't
  profess to communicate mere suspicions."</p>

  <p>"Well," rejoined Miller, "there they were, at any rate, and we can take it
  as a certainty that they are not there now."</p>

  <p>"I expect you are right," said Thorndyke, "but why not leave the
  discussion until we know?"</p>

  <p>"For all practical purposes, we do know," replied Miller. "We can take it
  that there was either a real or a pretended burglary, and in either case the
  stuff is pretty certainly gone; and the question is, who lifted it?"</p>

  <p>"You remember," said Thorndyke, "that the keys were stolen from Penrose's
  body. Presumably, they were taken for the purpose of being used; and they
  could have been used only by entering the premises. Moreover, if the cupboard
  was opened, it could have been opened only with Penrose's keys."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's a fact," Miller agreed. "But suppose the murderer did enter
  the premises, how do we know that he found the stuff there? Or, for that
  matter, how do we know that the place was ever entered? We have got only one
  man's word for it. And, to an experienced eye, it looks a bit like an indoor
  job."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see what is in your mind," said Thorndyke. "You are not
  letting your thoughts run on Horridge?"</p>

  <p>Miller grinned sourly. "No," he replied, "though I must admit that I did
  suspect him very considerably in connection with the murder. But I have
  squeezed him pretty dry&mdash;and I can tell you he didn't like being
  squeezed. But in the end, he was able to produce an undeniable alibi&mdash;a
  club dinner that he attended on the seventeenth of October at which all the
  members signed their names. So Horridge is now out of the picture."</p>

  <p>"He was never in," said Thorndyke. "The proceedings at the inquest made
  that perfectly clear."</p>

  <p>"What proceedings do you mean?" Miller demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am referring to Kickweed's evidence," Thorndyke replied. "If you had
  not been so preoccupied with the forged letter, you would have seen that it
  excluded Horridge from any possible suspicion in regard to the murder.
  Kickweed deposed that on the twentieth of October, three days after the
  murder, and the very day after the flight of the presumed murderer from
  Gravesend Hospital, Horridge called at Queen Square to see Penrose; and the
  two of them, Horridge and Kickweed, interviewed a police officer who had come
  to bring the coat that was assumed to belong to Penrose. Now, if Horridge had
  been the murderer, he must also have been the hospital patient. But the
  patient had two very bad black eyes and a severe wound across his right
  eyebrow. Obviously, he would have been in no condition for paying calls; and
  you will remember that the police officer was looking for a man with two
  black eyes and a cut across his right eyebrow."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Miller admitted, "I had overlooked that. But it did look as if
  Horridge had written that letter. Have you any idea who did write it? We have
  got to find that out."</p>

  <p>"My dear Miller," Thorndyke said, a little impatiently, "you had better
  forget that letter. It is a criminal matter, but it has no bearing on the
  crime which we are investigating. But if you have dropped Horridge, what do
  you mean by suggesting that this burglary may have been an indoor job?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you know," replied Miller, "this burglary rests on the story told
  by Mr. Kickweed; and Mr. Kickweed strikes me as a decidedly downy bird."</p>

  <p>"He couldn't have been the murderer, you know," said Thorndyke. "But it
  was presumably the murderer who had the keys."</p>

  <p>"I know," rejoined Miller. "But he was in the house; and there is such a
  thing as wax."</p>

  <p>"You can take it," said Thorndyke, "that Penrose was not in the habit of
  leaving his keys about."</p>

  <p>"No, probably not," Miller agreed, "but I suppose he had a bath sometimes,
  and I don't suppose he took his clothes into the bathroom with him."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled indulgently at the superintendent and admonished him in
  mock solemn tones:</p>

  <p>"Now, my dear Miller, let me urge you to beware of obsessions. At the
  inquest you allowed yourself to become letter-minded, and so you missed a
  vitally important item of evidence. And now you seem inclined to let yourself
  become Kickweed-minded. Why not leave Kickweed alone and address yourself to
  the more obvious lines of inquiry?"</p>

  <p>"Still, you know, Doctor," Miller persisted, "somebody must have known
  that those jewels were there."</p>

  <p>"There is not a particle of evidence that Kickweed did. You must remember
  that Penrose kept their existence absolutely secret from everybody excepting
  Lockhart; and he swore him to secrecy before he showed them. So far as we
  know, their existence was known only to two persons; Lockhart, and the man,
  whoever he was, who supplied them."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Miller, "the chappie who supplied them to Penrose certainly
  knew that they were there. It would be interesting, quite apart from the
  murder business, to know who he was. I wonder if it could have been Crabbe,
  after all."</p>

  <p>"You needn't wonder, Miller," said Thorndyke. "It was Crabbe. I think
  there can be no doubt about that."</p>

  <p>Miller sat up in his chair and turned a rather startled face to my
  colleague.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, Doctor!" he exclaimed. "You seem to know a mighty lot about it.
  And how did you manage to dig up Mr. Crabbe? I've been wondering about that
  ever since that evening when you asked me about him."</p>

  <p>"There was a document," replied Thorndyke; "a scrap of paper, apparently a
  descriptive label, which was found in the small room, on the morning after
  the alleged burglary. That was what enabled me to connect Crabbe with
  Penrose's collection."</p>

  <p>"Then," Miller exclaimed excitedly, "we have got actual, tangible evidence
  against Crabbe. Who has got that scrap of paper?"</p>

  <p>"Brodribb has the original, but I kept a copy. You shall see it;" and,
  with this, he rose and went to the cabinet in which the Penrose dossier was
  kept. Taking out from the collection of notes and papers the copy of Mr.
  Penrose's cryptogram, he brought it over and gravely handed it to Miller, who
  stared at it aghast while I watched him with unholy glee.</p>

  <p>"I can't make anything of this," the superintendent grumbled. "'Lobster:
  hortus petasatus.' It doesn't make sense. Besides, a lobster isn't a crab;
  and what in creation is a hortus petasatus?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke expounded the meaning of the inscription, explaining the late
  Mr. Penrose's peculiarities of speech, and Miller listened with incredulous
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Well, Doctor," he commented. "I take off my hat to you. That thing would
  have conveyed nothing to me. It's like some damn' silly puzzle game. And you
  might have passed it all round the C.I.D. and no one would have been an atom
  the wiser. But I am afraid it wouldn't do as evidence in a court of law."</p>

  <p>"Possibly not," Thorndyke admitted; "but I am not concerned with the
  robbery charge against Crabbe. I am investigating the murder of Daniel
  Penrose; and I am assuming that there was a burglary, that the burglar was in
  possession of Penrose's keys and that he knew what the cupboard in the small
  room contained. Of course, if we find the jewels still in the cupboard, we
  shall know that those assumptions were wrong."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Miller agreed, "but we shan't. Burglary or no burglary, those
  jewels have been pinched. I'd lay my bottom dollar to that. But you realise,
  Doctor, that, even if there was a burglary, the burglar couldn't have been
  Crabbe. He was in chokee at the time when it was supposed to have
  occurred."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "I had noted that fact; so we shall have to look
  round for some other person who knew that the jewels were there. And no such
  person is actually known to us, if we except Lockhart, and I suppose we can
  hardly suspect him."</p>

  <p>Miller grinned faintly at the suggestion and then became thoughtful. After
  a few moments of profound reflection he remarked:</p>

  <p>"Those locksmiths will make hay with poor old Penrose's safe. Are you
  going to be present to see how the job is done?"</p>

  <p>I was instantly struck by this abrupt change of subject and I could see
  that it was also noticed by Thorndyke, who, however, followed the
  superintendent's lead.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "I shall not turn up until they have had time to get the
  job finished. But Polton will be there to watch the proceedings and pick up a
  few tips on the correct method of opening a safe."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Miller, "I shall have to keep an eye on Mr. Polton if he is
  going to qualify as an expert safe-breaker. He is mighty handy already in the
  matter of locks and skeleton keys and house-breaker's tools."</p>

  <p>He pursued this facetious and quite irrelevant topic at considerable
  length and with no tendency whatever to revert to the subject of the Queen
  Square burglary. And then he pulled out his watch and, having bestowed on it
  a single startled glance, sprang up, declaring that, if he didn't look sharp,
  he would be late for an important appointment. And with this he took his
  departure hurriedly and with a distinctly purposive air.</p>

  <p>"Miller has got a bright idea of some kind." I remarked when he had
  gone.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "and he thinks he has got it all to himself. You
  noticed his sudden anxiety to switch the conversation off the subject of Mr.
  Crabbe. Well, it is all to the good if he doesn't get busy prematurely. I
  suppose you are coming to swell the multitude at Queen Square to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"If there is room," I replied, "I should like to see the fateful question
  decided. But it will be a bit of an anti-climax if the stuff is there after
  all, though I don't suppose Horridge will complain."</p>

  <p>"He will have a bad disappointment," said Thorndyke, "if we find the
  jewels there and he is then told that they are stolen property. However,
  there is no use in speculating. To-morrow we shall know whether they were or
  were not stolen, and until we know that, neither Miller nor I can decide on
  the next move."</p>

  <p>When, on the following morning, we arrived at the house in Queen Square
  and were admitted by Kickweed, we learned from him that the locksmiths had
  started their work on the safe about an hour previously and that the
  operations were still in progress. Our friend shook his head despondently as
  he showed us into the morning-room and remarked that it was a dreadful
  business and very disturbing.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to wait here until they are ready," he asked, "or will you
  join the&mdash;er&mdash;assembly in the great gallery?"</p>

  <p>We elected to join the assembly, whereupon he ushered us into the gallery,
  announcing us with due solemnity as he threw open the door. The word
  "assembly" appeared to represent Mr. Kickweed's state of mind rather than the
  actual facts, for there were only three persons present; Lockhart, Miller and
  Horridge, the latter very subdued, care-worn and decidedly gloomy. The cause
  of his depressed state was made evident presently when he took us apart,
  leaving Lockhart and Miller amicably discussing the legal position of an
  accessory after the fact.</p>

  <p>"This is a nice state of affairs," Horridge complained. "Do you know that
  this detective fellow actually accused me, in so many words, of having
  murdered poor old Pen? Me, his old and trusted friend and an executor of his
  will! And, if I hadn't had a conclusive alibi, I believe he would have run me
  in. And now he tells me that even if we find the jewels intact, it will be of
  no advantage to me because they are all stolen property; which I don't
  believe. I ask you, is it likely that a man of Pen's character would have
  been guilty of trafficking in stolen goods?"</p>

  <p>"I should, say, certainly not," replied Thorndyke, "if he knew that the
  goods were stolen. But the point is hardly worth discussing if the goods in
  question have disappeared."</p>

  <p>Here our conversation was interrupted by Polton who entered to announce
  that the work on the lock was completed and that the safe door was free and
  ready to be opened. Thereupon we followed him into the small room where we
  found two very superior artificers standing on guard over the remains of a
  large iron safe, the massive door of which was disclosed by the opening of
  the wooden case. Miller's prognostications had certainly not over-stated the
  results of the locksmith's activities. To say nothing of the wooden door with
  its shattered detector lock, those artificers had undoubtedly "made hay with"
  the safe, itself.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Horridge," said Miller, "you, as executor, are the proper person
  to open the safe."</p>

  <p>Horridge, however, deputed his functions to one of the workmen who
  accordingly took hold of the battered door and swung it wide open, disclosing
  a range of shallow drawers like those of an entomological cabinet.</p>

  <p>"Are these drawers in the condition in which you saw them when Mr. Penrose
  showed you his collection?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, so far as I can see," Lockhart replied. "He took them out, one by
  one, in their proper order from above downwards, and carried each over to
  that table by the window so that we could see the contents better."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "we had better do the same."</p>

  <p>But it was not necessary; for when the top drawer was pulled out it was
  seen to be undeniably empty. Horridge exhibited its vacant interior to the
  assembled company, turned it upside-down and shook it, and glumly returned it
  to its place. The case was the same with the second drawer and also with the
  third, excepting that when it was inverted some small object was heard to
  fall out on to the floor. Miller picked it up and exhibited it in the palm of
  his hand, when it was seen to be a small opal and was dropped back into the
  drawer. But that little opal was the solitary occupant of the cabinet. Apart
  from it and a plentiful covering of dust, the whole range of drawers from top
  to bottom was empty.</p>

  <p>"That burglar," Lockhart commented as the last of the drawers was slid
  back into its place, "was pretty thorough in his methods. He made a clean
  sweep of the whole collection; not only the gems but the coins as well. And
  he must have been fairly heavily laden when he went away, for most of the
  coins were gold and I should say there were some hundreds of them."</p>

  <p>"I don't fancy those coins were gold," said Miller. "I think I know where
  they came from, and, if I am right, they were electros&mdash;copper, gilt.
  Still, even copper electros weigh something. But it's surprising what a lot
  of coins and jewellery you can stow away about your person if you have the
  right sort of pockets. And it's pretty certain that he had an overcoat as
  well."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember, Lockhart," Thorndyke asked, "whether, when you saw the
  jewels, there were any labels attached to them?"</p>

  <p>"Not attached," Lockhart replied. "There were no fixed labels; only slips
  of paper like those on the shelves of the gallery."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice what was written on those slips of paper? Were they
  descriptive labels?"</p>

  <p>Lockhart grinned. "You know what Penrose's descriptions were like," he
  replied, "and you have seen the catalogue. So far as I could make out, the
  descriptions on the labels were similar to those in the catalogue;
  apparently, unintelligible nonsense."</p>

  <p>"You can't recall any of them?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"I remember one, because I tried to puzzle out what it could mean, and
  failed utterly. It was 'Decapod; jardin a chapeau'. Does that convey anything
  to you?"</p>

  <p>"It does to me, thanks to the doctor's explanations," said Miller, who had
  been listening eagerly to the questions and answers. "I don't know what a
  decapod is but I've got enough French to infer that jardin de chapeau is much
  the same as hortus petasatus. And the doctor can tell you what that
  means."</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" Lockhart demanded; and Thorndyke&mdash;not very
  willingly, I thought&mdash;gave the required explanation.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Lockhart chuckled, "I see now, though I hadn't your ingenuity. Poor
  old Penrose! What nonsense he did write and speak! But I think I also see the
  point of your questions."</p>

  <p>"And an uncommonly good point it is," said Miller. "That chappie was
  careful to take away the labels as well as the goods, and if he hadn't
  dropped one of them we should know a good deal less than we do. It's a very
  significant point, indeed."</p>

  <p>"And now," said Thorndyke, "as we have done what we came to do, perhaps we
  had better leave Mr. Horridge to discuss the question of repairs. Are you
  walking in our direction, Miller?"</p>

  <p>The superintendent was not. He was proposing, he said, to make a slight
  survey of the premises to elucidate the circumstances of the burglary, but I
  suspected that he was unwilling to run the risk of an interrogation by
  Thorndyke. So we left him to his survey, and, having once more condoled with
  Horridge, we set forth in company with Lockhart, leaving Polton to spy on the
  superintendent and worm out any trifles in the way of technical tips and
  trade secrets that he could from the locksmiths.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2-19"
     id="ch2-19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THORNDYKE'S DILEMMA</h2>

  <p class="first">I HAVE REFERRED MORE THAN once to Thorndyke's habitual
  unwillingness to discuss uncompleted cases, excepting in relation to
  questions of fact, or to disclose any opinions or theories that he had built
  on the facts which were known to us both. I had come to accept this reticence
  as a condition of our friendship and usually refrained from any attempts to
  discover what lines his thoughts were pursuing or what inferences he had
  drawn. But when we met at our chambers in the evening after our visit to
  Queen Square, I found him in a mood of unwonted expansiveness, apparently
  ready to discuss our present case without any reservations.</p>

  <p>The discussion opened with a question that I put tentatively, half
  expecting the usual invitation to exercise my own admirable faculty of
  deduction.</p>

  <p>"I noticed that you and Miller seemed to attach great importance to the
  circumstance that the burglar had carefully removed all the labels from the
  drawers. I don't quite see why. Would not a burglar ordinarily take away any
  labels that might furnish a clue to what had been stolen?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see why he should," Thorndyke replied. "An ordinary burglar would
  assume that the contents of the drawers were known, so that the labels would
  give no additional information. But these were not ordinary descriptive
  labels. They gave very definite information as to the person who had supplied
  the jewels; and as those jewels were the proceeds of a robbery which was
  known to the police, the information would be very dangerous to the person
  named. But that would not concern an ordinary burglar. The labels would
  furnish no clue to his identity. Of course, we know that he was not an
  ordinary, casual burglar, since he had Penrose's keys. But the point is that,
  whoever he was, he seemed to consider it a matter of importance that the
  identity of the person who sold the jewels to Penrose should not become
  known."</p>

  <p>"But the jewels were sold to Penrose by Crabbe."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But Crabbe could not have been the burglar. He was in prison at the
  time."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Thorndyke rejoined. "That is the importance of the discovery.
  The labels implicated Crabbe. But Crabbe could not have been the burglar. It
  seems to follow that they implicated some one besides Crabbe; and as the
  burglar was in possession of Penrose's keys and would thus appear to have
  been either the murderer or an accessory to the murder, it would be very
  interesting to know whom those labels could have implicated. I fancy that
  Miller has a very definite opinion on the subject; and I am disposed to think
  that he is right."</p>

  <p>"The deuce you are!" I exclaimed. "Then it seems to me that you have got
  the investigation much farther advanced than I had imagined. I had supposed
  that the search for the murderer had still to be begun. But it seems that
  there is already a definite suspect. Is that so?"</p>

  <p>He reflected for a few moments and then replied:</p>

  <p>"The word 'suspect' is perhaps a little too strong. My conclusions as to
  the possible identity of the murderer are at present on an entirely
  hypothetical plane. I have considered the whole complex of circumstances
  connected with the murder and have noted the persons who seem to have made
  any sort of contact with those circumstances; and I have considered each of
  those persons in relation to the questions whether he could possibly be the
  murderer and whether his known characteristics agree with those of the
  murderer."</p>

  <p>"But," I demanded, "what do we know of the characteristics of the
  murderer?"</p>

  <p>"Very little," he replied, "but still enough to enable us to apply at
  least a negative test in conjunction with the other considerations. Thus we
  can exclude Kickweed and Horridge because, although they make certain
  contacts, neither could have been present at the place and time of the
  murder. But let us take a glance at the positive aspects.</p>

  <p>"We begin with the justifiable assumption that the hospital patient was
  the murderer. Now, what do we know about him? Of his personal characteristics
  we have no description whatever. All that we know is that his collar bore the
  letters D.P., which were presumably the initial letters of his name, and that
  he had a deep wound crossing his right eyebrow which must have left a rather
  conspicuous permanent scar. So you see that, little as we know, we have the
  means of excluding or accepting any given individual. If his characteristics
  agree with those of the patient, he is a possible suspect; if they do not
  agree, he is not possible."</p>

  <p>"And do you know of any person whose characteristics do agree with those
  of the patient?"</p>

  <p>"Up to a certain point," he replied. "The ascertainment of the scar would
  involve a personal examination. That will have to come later as a final test.
  For the present, we must be content with agreement so far as is known."</p>

  <p>"But you have some such person in view?"</p>

  <p>Again he reflected for a few moments. At length, he replied:</p>

  <p>"I am in a rather odd dilemma. I have two theoretically possible suspects
  and I can make no sort of choice between them."</p>

  <p>"And do the names of both of them begin with D.P.?" I asked, imagining
  that I was putting a poser.</p>

  <p>"But," he exclaimed, "that is the extraordinary thing. They do. There is a
  coincidence for you if you like. It was a striking coincidence that the
  murderer should have the same initials as the victim. But this is more than
  striking. It is almost incredible."</p>

  <p>"I suppose we name no names," I suggested humbly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why not," he replied. "We keep our own counsel until we can
  turn hypothesis into proof. Well, my two possible suspects are Deodatus
  Pettigrew and David Parrott."</p>

  <p>"Parrott!" I exclaimed in astonishment. "I don't see where he comes into
  it; or Pettigrew either for that matter."</p>

  <p>"It is just a question of the contacts that they make with the
  circumstances of the murder," he replied. "Let us take them separately and
  see what those contacts are. The odd and confusing thing is that their
  contacts are entirely separate and from different sides."</p>

  <p>"Is it possible that they were both concerned in the murder?" I suggested;
  "that they may have been confederates?"</p>

  <p>"I have considered that," he answered. "It is possible, but, I think,
  unlikely. The crime has all the appearances of a one-man job. Moreover, I can
  find no evidence of any contact between these two men. So far as I know, they
  were strangers to each other and they persistently remain completely
  separate. So we will consider them separately.</p>

  <p>"Now, as to Parrott. The hospital patient had in his pocket a fragment of
  pottery which almost certainly came from Julliberrie's Grave. That fragment
  had been broken off a pot which was in Penrose's museum and which had come
  from Julliberrie's Grave. The entry in the catalogue relating to that pot
  consisted of the usual three terms; the description of the
  piece&mdash;'Moulin de vent'&mdash;the place whence it
  came&mdash;'Julie'&mdash;and a third term&mdash;'Polly'&mdash;which
  presumably indicated the person who supplied it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "that seems to have been Penrose's custom. So now the
  question is: Who is Polly? What is she? Have you found an answer to it?"</p>

  <p>"I infer, having regard to Penrose's cryptic terminology, that 'Polly'
  indicates Mr. Parrott."</p>

  <p>"Of course," I exclaimed. "I ought to have spotted that. Poll parrot.
  Pretty Polly. But still, you know, Thorndyke, it is only a guess, after
  all."</p>

  <p>"It is a little more than that," he objected. "Parrott is referred to
  frequently in the catalogue, and always by some allusive name, such as
  Perroquet, Psittacus, or Popinjay. Penrose may well have tried to find a new
  variant. But I admit your objection. This is not proof; it is only
  hypothesis. That is all I claim. At present we are only looking for some one
  whom it would be possible to suspect, as a guide to further investigation.
  Parrott is such a person, and so is Pettigrew, whose case is equally
  hypothetical. But you will note that Parrott agrees with the hospital patient
  in the initials of his name and that we have reason to believe that he knew
  Julliberrie's Grave and had actually dug into it.</p>

  <p>"Now let us consider Pettigrew. He does not appear to be in any way
  connected with Julliberrie's Grave, or, so far as I know, with Penrose. But
  there are reasons for connecting him with the burglary. The burglar knew of
  the existence of the Billington jewels and apparently knew where they were
  kept. Moreover, he was at pains to take away the labels which contained
  evidence that the jewels had been supplied by Crabbe. Apparently, he was
  anxious that Crabbe's guilt should not be revealed. But why? He certainly was
  not Crabbe himself. What was his interest in the matter?</p>

  <p>"You remember that Miller strongly suspected Crabbe of the Billington
  robbery. And it was not mere suspicion. He had enough evidence to make him
  consider seriously the possibility of a prosecution, though he decided that
  the evidence was not sufficient. The difficulty was that the jewels had
  disappeared and could not be traced. But now they have been traced and are
  known to have been sold to Penrose by Crabbe. So there is probably a complete
  case against the latter. But you will also remember that Miller's case
  against Crabbe included Pettigrew, for the reason&mdash;and no
  other&mdash;that Pettigrew was associated with Crabbe at the time of the
  robbery.</p>

  <p>"Now, that robbery was committed by Crabbe, or by his agents&mdash;but
  almost certainly by Crabbe himself. Whether Pettigrew did or did not take
  part in the robbery, we don't know. But we do know that he was associated
  with Crabbe at the time, that that association put him under suspicion, and
  that if Crabbe should be proved guilty, he, Crabbe's associate, would
  certainly be implicated. You see, therefore, that Pettigrew agrees completely
  with the special characteristics that we have assigned to the burglar, and we
  know of no one else who does.</p>

  <p>"But that burglar was in possession of Penrose's keys and was, therefore,
  either the murderer himself or a confederate of the murderer."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "it is a very complete case so far as it goes. But it is
  only a string of hypotheses, after all."</p>

  <p>"Not entirely," he replied. "The association of Crabbe and Pettigrew is a
  fact, if we accept Miller's statement. There is really a definite case of
  suspicion against Pettigrew, at least that is my opinion; and it is certainly
  Miller's. If I am not greatly mistaken, the superintendent is in full cry
  after Deodatus. But you see the curious dilemma that we are in. Here are two
  men each of whom agrees in certain respects with the characters of the
  murderer. But the characters with which they agree are not the same. Parrott
  is connected with Julliberrie's Grave but seems to have no connection with
  the burglary. Pettigrew is connected with the burglary but seems to have no
  connection with Julliberrie's Grave. But the murderer must have been
  connected with both."</p>

  <p>"It almost seems," said I, "that you will have to accept&mdash;at least
  provisionally&mdash;the idea of confederacy. The assumption that both men
  were concerned in the murder would release you from your dilemma."</p>

  <p>"That is quite true," he replied. "But it would be a gratuitous
  assumption. There is nothing to support it. The two men are separate and
  there is no apparent connection between them; nothing to suggest that they
  were even acquainted. And again I must say that I have the strongest feeling
  that the murder was the work of one man absolutely alone."</p>

  <p>"It certainly has that appearance," I admitted, "but still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I paused as the sound of footsteps on our landing caught my ear. A moment
  later, an old-fashioned flourish on the little brass knocker of our inner
  door at once announced the arrival of a visitor and declared his identity. I
  rose, and, crossing the room, threw open the door; whereupon Mr. Brodribb
  bounced in, looking, with his glossy silk hat and his faultless morning
  dress, as if he had just bounced out of a band-box.</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, holding up his hand, "don't let me create any disturbance.
  I am only a bird of passage. Off again in two or three minutes."</p>

  <p>"But why?" said Thorndyke. "Polton will be bringing in our dinner by that
  time. Why not stay and season the feast with your illustrious presence?"</p>

  <p>"Very good of you," replied Brodribb, "and very nicely put. I should love
  to. But I have got a confounded engagement. However, I will sit down for a
  minute or two and say what I have to say. It isn't very important."</p>

  <p>He placed his hat tenderly on the table and then continued:</p>

  <p>"My principal object in calling, I don't mind admitting, is to bespeak the
  good offices of the incomparable Polton. I've got a fine old bracket
  clock&mdash;belonged to my grandfather; made for him by Earnshaw, and I set
  considerable store by it. Now, something has gone wrong with its strike and I
  don't like to trust it to a common clock-jobber. So I thought I would ask
  Polton to have a look at it. Probably he can do all that is necessary, and,
  if he can't, he will be able to give me the name of one of his Clerkenwell
  friends who is equal to dealing with a fine bracket clock."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke, "I will undertake the commission on his
  behalf. He will be delighted, I am sure, to do what he can for pure love of a
  good clock, to say nothing of his love of the owner."</p>

  <p>"Does he love me?" asked Brodribb. "Well, I hope he does, for I have the
  greatest admiration and regard for him. Then that is settled. And now to the
  other matter. I thought you would be interested to know that I have got the
  intestacy proceedings in re Penrose well under way."</p>

  <p>"You haven't lost much time," I remarked in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mean that I have got it settled," said he. "That will be a
  work of months, at least. But I have got the essentials in train. As soon as
  I got your note informing me that Daniel Penrose was dead and that he died on
  the seventeenth of October, I set the machinery going. Seemed a bit callous,
  with the body still above ground, but I don't believe in wasting time. None
  of the law's delay for me if I can help it. So I put out the necessary
  advertisements at once. You see, it was pretty plain sailing as I had a copy
  of the Penrose pedigree. That told me at once who the principal next of kin
  were, though, of course, I didn't know where to find them. But I was able to
  give names and particulars which were likely to catch the attention of
  interested parties. And they did. As a matter of fact, there are only two
  persons who matter and I have got into touch with them both. They are
  descendants of a certain Elizabeth Penrose, an aunt of Oliver's, who married
  a man named John Pettigrew. What their exact relationship is to each other, I
  have forgotten, but they are both named Pettigrew. One of them is a young
  lady named Joan; a nice girl, poor as a church mouse but very independent and
  industrious. Works for her living and supports her mother&mdash;secretary to
  some professor fellow. And the mother is quite a nice lady. She had a job as
  manageress of some sort of antique shop, but the proprietor went bust and she
  lost the billet. It is pleasant to think of these two worthy ladies coming in
  for a bit of luck."</p>

  <p>"You have seen them, apparently," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they turned up two days after the advertisement appeared, and I
  liked the look of both of them. The girl, Joan, is very much on the spot and
  very modern&mdash;short skirts, head like a mop, you know the sort of thing.
  But I like her. She's a good girl and she has evidently been a good
  daughter."</p>

  <p>"And the other person?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"The other is a man, Deodatus Pettigrew. Quaint name, isn't it? I hope he
  will justify it, but I have my doubts. Joan and her mother knew him, but they
  were mighty reticent about him. Rather evasive, in fact. Made me suspect that
  he might be a sheep of the brunette type. But we shall see. In any case, his
  personal character is no concern of mine."</p>

  <p>"You haven't met him yet?" Thorndyke suggested.</p>

  <p>"No. He didn't seem keen on an interview. Joan and her mother turned up in
  person, but he just wrote and seemed to want to do the whole business by
  correspondence. Of course, I couldn't have that in the case of a big estate
  like this. Must know the people I am dealing with."</p>

  <p>"What do you reckon these two persons are likely to receive?" Thorndyke
  asked.</p>

  <p>"The whole estate is about a hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and, as
  there are practically no other claimants, they can hardly get less than fifty
  thousand apiece."</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand pounds," I remarked, "ought to be worth the trouble of an
  interview."</p>

  <p>"So I told him," said Brodribb, "and, in effect, he agreed. So he is
  coming up to see me to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"At what time?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"The appointment is for twelve o'clock, noon, sharp. But why do you ask
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Because I rather want to see Mr. Pettigrew."</p>

  <p>"Ho, ha!" said Brodribb. "So you know something about him."</p>

  <p>"Not very much," replied Thorndyke. "I am interested. I should like to
  have a look at him in a good light to see if he agrees with a description
  that I had of a person of that name. Can you manage that?"</p>

  <p>"I can and I will. Would you like an introduction?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "I don't want to know him and I don't wish him to
  know who I am. I just want to have a good look at his face."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Brodribb. "I scent a mystery. But I ask no questions. You
  will bear me out in that, Jervis. I ask no questions though I am bursting
  with curiosity. I just do what I am asked to do. I shall arrange for you to
  be shown into the waiting-room&mdash;where, by the way, the clock is.
  Pettigrew will come to the clerk's office, but when he goes away I shall let
  him out through the waiting-room. So, if you sit or stand close to the outer
  door, which is by the window, you will have a good view of him in an
  excellent light. I wonder why the devil you want to see him. But I don't ask.
  No, not at all. I know my place."</p>

  <p>Here Brodribb consulted a fat gold watch. Then, as he sprang up and seized
  his hat, he concluded:</p>

  <p>"Now I must really be off. To-morrow at noon; and don't forget to tell
  Polton about the clock."</p>

  <p>When he had gone, I reopened our previous discussion with the inevitable
  comment.</p>

  <p>"This communication of Brodribb's throws a fresh and lurid light on the
  case and lets you out of your dilemma. It looks as if Parrott might be
  dismissed from the role of suspect."</p>

  <p>"It does," Thorndyke agreed. "But we mustn't exaggerate the significance
  of these new facts. Because a man stands to benefit by another man's death,
  it doesn't follow that he is prepared to murder that other man."</p>

  <p>"True," I replied. "But that is not quite the position. It is not merely a
  case of a man standing to benefit by the death of another. The benefit was
  actually created by the murder. If Penrose had not been murdered, he would
  have taken practically the whole estate and the others would have received
  nothing. There is no blinking the fact that the murder of Daniel Penrose was
  worth fifty thousand pounds to Pettigrew, and that without the murder he
  would have got nothing. I should say that you might pretty safely forget
  Parrott."</p>

  <p>"You may be right, Jervis," he rejoined. "You are, certainly, in regard to
  the reality of the motive. But that motive is no answer to the positive
  evidence that seems to implicate Parrott."</p>

  <p>Here Polton stole silently into the room (having let himself in with his
  key), bearing the advance guard of the materials for dinner, and the
  discussion was necessarily suspended. Thorndyke lapsed into silence, and, as
  his invaluable henchman laid the table in his quietly efficient fashion, he
  watched him thoughtfully, as if noting his noiseless, unhurried dexterity. As
  Polton retired to fetch a fresh consignment, he rose, and, stepping over to
  the cabinet, pulled out a drawer and took from it the cardboard box in which
  the pottery fragment and its mould and the other objects from the pocket of
  the hospital patient had been deposited. From the box he picked out the
  cigarette-tube&mdash;the existence of which I had forgotten&mdash;turned it
  over in his fingers, looking at it curiously, and replaced the box in the
  drawer. Then he walked over to the table, and, having laid the tube on the
  white cloth, went back to his chair.</p>

  <p>I watched the proceeding with a good deal of curiosity but I made no
  comment. For the immediate purpose was plain enough and it remained only to
  await the further developments. And I had not long to wait. Presently Polton
  returned with the remainder of the materials for our meal on a tray. The
  latter he set down on the table and was about to begin unloading it when the
  cigarette-tube caught his eye. He looked at it very hard and with evident
  surprise for a few moments and then picked it up and turned it over as
  Thorndyke had done, examining every part of it with the minutest
  scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"Well, Polton," said Thorndyke, "what do you think of it?"</p>

  <p>Polton looked at him with a cunning and crinkly smile and replied
  comprehensively in a single word:</p>

  <p>"Tims."</p>

  <p>"Tims," I repeated. "What on earth are Tims?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tims, sir," he explained, "now deceased. Mr. Parrott's
  cabinet-maker."</p>

  <p>"You think it once belonged to Mr. Tims?" Thorndyke suggested.</p>

  <p>"I don't think," Polton replied. "I know. I saw him make it. The way it
  came about was this; there was a little cabinet of African ebony sent to the
  workshop for some repairs, and the owner of it sent with it a piece of the
  same wood that he had managed to get hold of&mdash;queer-looking stuff of a
  sort of brownish-black, rather like a lump of pitch, with a streak of grey
  sap-wood running through it.</p>

  <p>"Well, Tims did the repairs and he was mighty economical with the wood
  because there was none too much of it. However, when the job was finished,
  there was a small bit left over, mostly sap-wood. But Tims cut most of that
  away and then put the piece in the lathe and turned up this tube, finishing
  the mouthpiece with a paring chisel; and he made these white dots by-drilling
  holes and driving little holly-wood dowels into them before he finished the
  turning. He was quite pleased with it when it was done."</p>

  <p>"Did he keep it for his own use?" Thorndyke asked, "or did he sell
  it?"</p>

  <p>"That I can't say, sir. But he would hardly have kept it, because he
  didn't smoke cigarettes. I supposed at the time that he had made it to give
  to Mr. Parrott, who smoked cigarettes a lot and always used a tube; and the
  one that he had was burned to a stump. Still, Tims may have given it or sold
  it to some one else. Might I ask, sir, how it came into your hands?"</p>

  <p>"We found it," Thorndyke replied, "in the pocket of a raincoat that was
  left by the unknown man who was in possession of Mr. Penrose's car."</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear!" said Polton. "Then I am afraid it has been in bad
  company."</p>

  <p>He laid it down on the table and resumed the business of unloading the
  tray. Then, having removed the covers, he made a little bow to intimate that
  dinner was served, and retired, apparently wrapped in profound thought.</p>

  <p>"There, Jervis," said Thorndyke, picking up the tube and restoring it to
  its abiding-place, "you see how the evidence oscillates back and forth and
  still keeps a rough balance. Here we are, back in the old dilemma. First
  comes Brodribb and weights the balance heavily against Pettigrew; so heavily
  that you are disposed to drop Parrott overboard. But then comes Polton and
  weights the balance heavily against Parrott&mdash;and, by the way, I think he
  has his own suspicions of the Popinjay. He looked mighty thoughtful after I
  had answered his question."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I, "it seemed to me that your answer had given him something
  to think about. But with regard to this tube. There is not a particle of
  evidence that it was ever in Parrott's possession."</p>

  <p>"Not of direct evidence," he admitted. "But just look at the prima facie
  appearances as a whole. Here was a man who was evidently intimately
  acquainted with Penrose, for they had been digging together in the barrow. He
  had in his pocket an object which had been dug up in that barrow and which
  was part of another object, dug up from the same barrow, and almost certainly
  dug up by Parrott and sold by him to Penrose. That, at least, suggests the
  possibility&mdash;even a probability&mdash;that the man was Parrott. Now we
  find in that same man's pocket an object that was certainly made in Parrott's
  workshop. That is a very striking fact. It makes, at least, another
  connection between Parrott and the hospital patient. And then there is the
  very strong probability that Tims made the thing as a gift to his employer;
  that it was actually Parrott's property. By the ordinary rules of
  circumstantial evidence, all these agreements create a very definite
  probability that the man was Parrott."</p>

  <p>I had to admit the truth of this. "But," I objected, "this suspicion of
  Parrott is no answer to the positive evidence against Pettigrew. If you
  refuse to entertain the idea of a joint crime by two confederates&mdash;which
  still seems to me the only way out&mdash;you are left in a hopeless dilemma.
  You have got evidence suggesting that Tweedledum is the guilty party and
  evidence that Tweedledee committed the crime; and yet&mdash;on your one-man
  theory&mdash;they can't both be guilty. I don't quite see how you are going
  to resolve the puzzle."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget, Jervis," said he, "that there are certain final tests
  which, if we can only apply them, will carry us out of the region of
  inference into that of demonstrable fact. If our inferences are correct, one
  of these men is pretty certainly in possession of the Billington jewels. And
  there are other confirmatory tests equally conclusive. The purpose of our
  hypothetical reasoning is to discover the persons to whom the tests may be
  applied."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch2-20"
     id="ch2-20"></a>XX. &mdash; THE DILEMMA RESOLVED</h2>

  <p class="first">It wanted some minutes to the appointed time when Thorndyke
  and I, accompanied by Polton and a burglarious-looking handbag, arrived at
  Mr. Brodribb's premises in New Square, Lincoln's Inn. The visitor, we learned
  from the chief clerk, had not yet made his appearance, and we were shown at
  once into the private office, where we found Brodribb seated at his
  writing-table sorting out a heap of letters and documents. He rose as we were
  announced, and, taking off his spectacles, proceeded to the business on which
  we had come.</p>

  <p>"You had better come out into the ante-room at once," said he, "as
  Pettigrew will come in through the clerks' office. I don't think you will
  have so very long to wait. The interview needn't be a very protracted affair
  as there isn't much to discuss. It is really only a matter of my making his
  acquaintance."</p>

  <p>He opened a small, light door and ushered us through into the ante-room, a
  rather long, narrow chamber, lighted by a large window at one end which was
  close to the door of exit. A large office table occupied a good deal of the
  floor space and extended to the neighbourhood of the window, leaving a space
  just sufficient for a couple of chairs.</p>

  <p>"There," said Brodribb, indicating the latter, "if you take those chairs
  you will be close to the window and the door. He will have to pass quite near
  to you and you will be able to inspect him in an excellent light. And I think
  this table will do for you, Polton. There is your patient on the mantelpiece.
  He is ticking away all right but, when he tries to strike, he makes a most
  ungodly noise."</p>

  <p>Polton walked round to the mantelpiece and surveyed the clock with a
  friendly and appreciative crinkle.</p>

  <p>"It's a noble old timepiece," said he. "They don't make clocks like that
  nowadays. Don't want 'em, I suppose, now that you can get the time by
  counting the hiccups from a loud-speaker."</p>

  <p>He listened for a few moments, with his ear close to the dial and then
  lifted the clock, cautiously and with loving care, on to the table. The keys
  were in the front and back doors, and, when he had unlocked and opened them,
  he placed his bag on the table and began to discharge its cargo of tools and
  appliances. First, he took out a roll of clean, white paper, which he spread
  on the table, weighting it with one or two tools and a couple of lignum-vitae
  bowls. Then he started the strike, which was accompanied by the most horrid
  asthmatical wheezing, and having listened critically to these abnormal
  sounds, he took off the pendulum and fell to work with a screwdriver to such
  effect that, in a jiffy, the clock was out of its case and lying on its back
  on the sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>At this point a clerk appeared at the door of the private office and
  announced that Mr. Pettigrew had arrived, whereupon Mr. Brodribb directed him
  to show the visitor in, and, after a last, anxious glance at the clock, went
  back into his office and shut the communicating door.</p>

  <p>But the latter, as I have said, was by no means a massive structure, and,
  in fact, hardly seemed to meet the requirements of a lawyer's office in the
  matter of privacy. Brodribb's voice, indeed, was hardly audible, but I heard
  quite distinctly the visitor's reply: "Yes, sir. I am Mr. Pettigrew."</p>

  <p>But I was not the only person who heard that reply. As Pettigrew spoke, I
  noticed that Polton seemed to pause for an instant in his operations and
  listened with a rather odd expression of interest and attention. And so, as
  the interview proceeded, each time that Pettigrew spoke, Polton's movements
  were arrested and he sat with his mouth slightly open, listening, without any
  disguise, to the voice that penetrated the door.</p>

  <p>It was a rather peculiar voice, resonant, penetrating and clear; and its
  quality was reinforced by the deliberate manner and distinct enunciation. The
  disjointed sentences that came through the door might have been spoken by an
  actor or by a man making a set speech. But I think that Brodribb must have
  done most of the talking, for the sounds that came through took the form,
  generally, of an indistinct rumble which certainly did not proceed from
  Pettigrew.</p>

  <p>The interview was not a long one, but to me the inaction, coupled with an
  ill-defined expectancy, made the time pass slowly and tediously. Thorndyke
  relieved the tedium of waiting by following Polton's operations and
  discussing&mdash;almost in a whisper&mdash;the construction of the striking
  mechanism and the symptoms of its disorder. The latter did not appear to be
  very serious, for, presently, Polton began to reassemble the dismembered
  parts of the movement, applying here and there, with a pointed style, a
  delicate touch of oil.</p>

  <p>He had got the greater part of the striking movement together when the
  sound, from the private office, of a chair being drawn back seemed to herald
  the termination of the interview. Thereupon Thorndyke went back to his chair
  and Polton, softly laying down a pair of flat-nosed pliers, suddenly became
  immobile and watchful. Then the door opened an inch or two and Brodribb's
  voice became audible.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mr. Pettigrew," he said, "you shall not be troubled with
  unnecessary journeys. I shall let you know, from time to time, how matters
  are progressing and not ask for your personal attendance unless it is
  absolutely necessary."</p>

  <p>With this he threw open the door and ushered his client into the
  ante-room, filling up the doorway with his own rather bulky person as if to
  prevent any retreat. I glanced with natural curiosity at Pettigrew and saw a
  rather large man, dark-complexioned and wearing a full beard and moustache,
  the latter turned up fiercely at the ends in a fashion slightly suggestive of
  wax. Apparently, he had supposed the room to be empty, for he looked round
  with quick, uneasy surprise. And then his glance fell on Polton; and I could
  see at once that he recognised him and was rather disconcerted by the
  recognition. But he made no sign after the first startled glance, walking
  straight up the room in the narrow space between the table and the fireplace,
  looking neither to the right nor left. But just as he had advanced midway,
  Polton rose suddenly and exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Mr. Parrott! Bless me, sir, I hardly knew you with that
  beard."</p>

  <p>Pettigrew cast a malignant glance at the speaker and replied, gruffly:</p>

  <p>"My name is Pettigrew."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Polton, "I suppose Parrott was the business name."</p>

  <p>Pettigrew made no reply, but stalked up the room until he passed between
  our chairs and the table to reach the door. And then he suddenly clapped on
  his hat. But not soon enough. For I had already noted&mdash;and so certainly
  had Thorndyke&mdash;an irregular, rather recent, scar crossing his right
  eyebrow. And when I saw that, I realised what Thorndyke had meant by "the
  final tests."</p>

  <p>As Pettigrew grasped the handle of the door, he cast a swift, apprehensive
  glance at my colleague. Then he opened the door quickly, and, when he had
  passed out, shut it after him. Instantly, Thorndyke rose and followed him,
  and, of course, I followed Thorndyke; and so we came out in a sort of
  procession into the Square.</p>

  <p>As we emerged from the house, I became aware of a man loitering on the
  pavement at its northern end. He was a stranger to me, but I diagnosed him at
  once as a plain-clothes police officer. So, perhaps had Pettigrew, for he
  turned in the other direction, towards the Searle Street gate. But that path
  also was guarded, and by no less a person than Superintendent Miller. When I
  first saw him, he was standing in the middle of the pavement, apparently
  studying a document. But as we turned in his direction, Thorndyke took off
  his hat; whereupon Miller hastily pocketed the paper and awaited the approach
  of his quarry.</p>

  <p>It was evident that Pettigrew viewed the superintendent with suspicion for
  he turned and crossed the road to the railings of the garden; and when the
  superintendent also crossed the road, with the evident purpose of
  intercepting him, the position was unmistakable. Pettigrew paused for a
  moment irresolutely, thrusting his hand into his pocket. Then, as Miller
  rushed towards him, he drew out a revolver and fired at him nearly point
  blank. The superintendent staggered back a couple of paces but did not fall;
  and when Pettigrew, having fired his shot, dodged across to the pavement and
  broke into a run, he clapped his hand to his thigh and followed as well as he
  could.</p>

  <p>The swift succession of events has left an indelible impression on my
  memory. Even now I can see vividly with my mind's eye that strange picture of
  hurry and confusion that disturbed the peace and repose of New Square: the
  terrified fugitive, racing furiously down the pavement with Thorndyke and me
  in hot pursuit; the plain-clothes man clattering noisily behind; and the
  superintendent hobbling after us with a blood-stained hand grasping his
  thigh.</p>

  <p>But it was a short chase. For hardly had Pettigrew&mdash;running like a
  hare and gaining on us all&mdash;covered half the distance to the gate when
  suddenly he halted, flung away his revolver and sank to the ground, rolling
  over on to his back and then lying motionless. When we reached him and looked
  down at the prostrate figure, his aspect&mdash;wretch as he was&mdash;could
  not but evoke some feelings of pity and compunction. The ghastly face, the
  staring, terrified eyes, the retracted lips, and the hands, clutching at the
  breast, presented the typical picture of angina pectoris.</p>

  <p>But this, too, was but a passing phase. Before any measures of relief
  could be thought of, it was over. The staring eyes relaxed, the mouth fell
  open, and the hands slipped from the breast and dropped limply to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>The superintendent, hobbling up, still grasping his wounded thigh, looked
  down gloomily at his prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Well," he commented, "he made a game try, and he has given us the slip,
  sure enough. It's a pity, but it's no one's fault. We couldn't have got him
  any sooner. Hadn't we better move him indoors before a crowd collects?"</p>

  <p>It did seem desirable; for the pistol shot and the sounds of hurrying feet
  had brought startled faces to office windows and now began to bring curious
  spectators from office doorways.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if we carry him into your anteroom?" Thorndyke asked, turning
  to Brodribb, who had just come up with Polton.</p>

  <p>"No, no," Brodribb replied. "Take the poor creature in, of course. Is he
  badly hurt?"</p>

  <p>"He is dead," Thorndyke announced as I hastened with the assistance of the
  plain-clothes officer to lift the body.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" exclaimed Brodribb, turning as pale as his complexion would
  permit. "Good God! What a shocking thing! Just as he was coming into a
  fortune too. How perfectly appalling!"</p>

  <p>He followed the gruesome procession as the officer and I, now aided by
  Thorndyke, bore the corpse back along the pavement to the doorway from which
  we had emerged but a minute or two previously and finally laid it down on the
  ante-room floor; and he stole softly into the room and shrank away with a
  horrified glance at the ghastly figure. And his agitation was natural enough.
  There was something very dreadful in the suddenness of the catastrophe. I was
  sensible of it myself as I rose from laying down the corpse and my glance
  lighted on the clock and the litter of tools on the table, lying just as the
  dead man had seen them when he passed to the door.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Thorndyke, "that we had better telephone for an ambulance
  to take away the body and convey the superintendent to the hospital. Where is
  he?" he added anxiously.</p>

  <p>The question was answered by Miller in person, who limped into the room,
  his gory hand still grasping his wound and a trickle of blood running across
  his boot.</p>

  <p>"My God, Miller!" exclaimed Brodribb, gazing at him in consternation, "you
  too! But aren't you going to do something for him, Thorndyke?"</p>

  <p>"We had better see what the damage is," said I, "and at least control the
  bleeding."</p>

  <p>"I don't think it is anything that matters," said Miller, "excepting to
  Mr. Brodribb's carpet. However, you may as well have a look at it."</p>

  <p>I made a rapid examination of the wound and was relieved to find that his
  estimate was correct. The bullet had passed through the outer side of the
  thigh leaving an almost imperceptible entrance wound but a rather ragged
  wound of exit which was bleeding somewhat freely.</p>

  <p>"You haven't any bandages or dressing material, I suppose?" said I.</p>

  <p>"I have not," replied Brodribb, "but I can produce some clean
  handkerchiefs, if they will do. But bring him into my private office. I can't
  bear the sight of that poor creature lying on the floor."</p>

  <p>We accordingly moved off to the private office where, with Brodribb's
  handkerchiefs, I contrived a temporary dressing which restrained the
  bleeding.</p>

  <p>"There," said I, "that will serve until the ambulance comes. Some one has
  telephoned, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Brodribb, "the police officer sent a message. And now tell
  me what it is all about. I heard a pistol shot. Who was it that fired?"</p>

  <p>"Pettigrew," Thorndyke answered. "The position is this: the superintendent
  came here on my information to arrest Pettigrew and charge him with the
  murder of Daniel Penrose, and Pettigrew fired at Miller in the hope of
  getting away."</p>

  <p>Brodribb was horrified. "You astound me, Thorndyke!" he exclaimed. "I have
  actually been conferring with poor Penrose's murderer. And not only that. I
  have been aiding and abetting him in getting possession of the plunder. But I
  don't understand how he comes to be dead. What killed him?"</p>

  <p>"It was a heart attack," Thorndyke replied, "Angina, brought about by the
  excitement and the intense physical effort. But I think I hear the ambulance
  men in the ante-room. That sounded like a stretcher being put down."</p>

  <p>He opened the door and we looked out. At the table Polton was seated,
  apparently engrossed in his work upon the clock and watched with grim
  amusement by the plain-clothes officer, while the ambulance men, having
  lifted the body on to the stretcher, were preparing to carry it away. I was
  about to help Miller to rise from his chair when Thorndyke interposed.</p>

  <p>"Before you go, Miller," said he, "there is one little matter to be
  attended to. You had better get Pettigrew's address from Mr. Brodribb; and
  you had better lose no time in sending some capable officer there with a
  search warrant. You understand what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," replied Miller. "But there isn't going to be any sending. I
  shall make that search myself, if I have to go down in an ambulance."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Miller," Thorndyke rejoined. "But remember that you have got
  only two legs and that you can't afford to part with either of them."</p>

  <p>With this warning he assisted the superintendent to rise; and when the
  latter had received and carefully pocketed the slip of paper on which
  Brodribb had written Pettigrew's address, we escorted him out to the
  ambulance and saw him duly dispatched en route for Charing Cross
  Hospital.</p>

  <p>As we turned to re-enter the house, our ears were saluted by the cheerful
  striking of a clock; and passing into the ante-room, we found Polton, still
  seated at the table, surveying with an admiring and crinkly smile the
  venerable timepiece, now completely reconstructed and restored to its
  case.</p>

  <p>"He's all right now, sir," he announced triumphantly. "Just listen to his
  strike." He moved the minute hand round, and, having paused a moment for the
  "warning," set it at the hour and listened ecstatically as the hammer struck
  out six silvery notes.</p>

  <p>"Clear as the day he was born," he remarked complacently; and forthwith
  moved the hand round to the next hour.</p>

  <p>"You must stop that noise," exclaimed Brodribb. "I can't bear it. Have you
  no sense of decency, to be making that uproar in the house of death,
  you&mdash;you callous, indifferent little villain?"</p>

  <p>Polton regarded him with a surprised and apologetic crinkle (and moved the
  hand round to the next hour).</p>

  <p>"But, sir," he protested, "you can't set a striking clock to time any
  other way, unless you take the gong off. Shall I do that?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," replied Brodribb. "I'll go outside until you've finished. And I
  apologise for calling you a villain. My nerves are rather upset."</p>

  <p>We accompanied him out into the Square and walked up and down the pavement
  for a few minutes giving him some further explanations of the recent events.
  Presently Polton made his appearance, carrying his bag, and announced that
  the clock was now set to time and established in its place on the
  mantelpiece. Brodribb thanked him profusely and apologised still more
  profusely for his outburst.</p>

  <p>"You must forgive me, Polton," he said. "My nerves are not equal to this
  sort of thing. You understand, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I understand, sir," replied Polton, "and I suppose I was callous. But he
  was a bad man, not worth troubling about, and the world is the better without
  him. I never liked him and I always suspected him of fleecing poor Mr.
  Penrose."</p>

  <p>"Probably you were right," rejoined Brodribb, "but we must talk about that
  when I am more myself. And now I will get back to my business and try to
  forget these horrors."</p>

  <p>He shook hands with us and retired into his entry while we turned away and
  set a course for the Temple.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Thorndyke," I said presently, "you were not surprised by our
  friend's recognition of Parrott. I am judging by the fact that you took the
  opportunity of having Polton with us."</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "I was not. The assumption that Parrott and Pettigrew
  were one and the same person seemed to offer the only way out of my dilemma
  if I rejected&mdash;as I certainly did&mdash;the idea of confederacy. There
  were the two men, making separate appearances. Each of them seemed, by the
  evidence, to be the murderer. But there was only one murderer. The only
  solution of the problem was the assumption that they were the same man. That
  was a perfectly reasonable assumption and there was nothing against it."</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all," I admitted. "In fact, it is rather obvious&mdash;when
  once it is suggested. But I have found this case rather confusing from the
  first; it has seemed to me a bewildering mass of disjointed facts."</p>

  <p>"That is a mistake, Jervis," said he. "The facts form a perfectly coherent
  sequence. Some time, we will go over the ground again, and then I think you
  will see that your confusion was principally due to your having made a false
  start."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2-21"
     id="ch2-21"></a>XXI. &mdash; AFTERTHOUGHTS</h2>

  <p class="first">"It seems to me," Lockhart suggested, "that this case is, to
  a certain extent, left in the air. The essential facts, in a legal sense, are
  perfectly clear. But there is a lot that we don't know, and, I suppose, never
  shall know."</p>

  <p>The remark&mdash;which fairly expressed my own view&mdash;was made on the
  occasion of a little dinner-party at our chambers, arranged partly to
  celebrate the completion of the case, and partly to enable Lockhart&mdash;who
  had developed unexpected archaeological sympathies&mdash;to make the
  acquaintance of Elmhurst. The dinner was supplied by the staff of a
  neighbouring tavern, an arrangement which not only relieved Polton of
  culinary labours but included him in the festivities; for he was enabled
  thereby to entertain, in his own apartments adjacent to the laboratory, no
  less a person than Mr. Kickweed.</p>

  <p>Both of our guests had been, in a sense, parties to the case; but each had
  made contact with it at only a single point. It was natural, then, that when
  the meal had reached its more leisurely and less manducatory stage, the
  desultory conversation should have subsided into a more definite discussion,
  with a demand from both for a complete exposition of the investigation. And
  it was then, when Thorndyke readily complied with the demand, that I was
  able, for the first time, to realise how clearly he had grasped the
  essentials of the problem from the very beginning and how steadily and
  directly he had proceeded, point by point, to unravel the tangle of false
  appearances.</p>

  <p>I need not report his exposition. It contained nothing but what is
  recorded in the foregoing narrative of the events. It consisted, in fact, of
  a condensed summary of that narrative with the events presented in their
  actual sequence with a running accompaniment of argument demonstrating their
  logical connections. When he had come to the end of the story with an account
  of its tragic climax, he paused to push round the decanters and then
  proceeded reflectively to fill his pipe; and it was then that Lockhart made
  the observation which I have recorded above.</p>

  <p>"That is quite true," Thorndyke agreed. "For legal purposes&mdash;for the
  purpose of framing an indictment and securing a conviction&mdash;the case was
  as complete as it could well be. But the death of Pettigrew has left us in
  the dark on a number of points on which we should probably have been
  enlightened if he had been brought to trial and had made a statement in his
  defence. At present, the circumstances surrounding the murder&mdash;if it was
  a murder&mdash;and the motive&mdash;if there was a clear-cut motive&mdash;are
  more or less wrapped in mystery."</p>

  <p>"Are they?" Elmhurst exclaimed in evident surprise. "To me it looks like a
  simple murder, deliberately planned in cold blood, for the plain purpose of
  getting possession of a very large sum of money. Fifty thousand pounds would
  seem to furnish a very sufficient motive to a man of Pettigrew's type. But
  you don't take that view?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke, "I do not. I am even inclined to doubt whether
  the money was a factor in the case at all. We must not lose sight of the
  conditions prevailing at the time. When Penrose left home, that is to say on
  the day of his death, his father was alive and well and the question of the
  disposition of his property had not arisen. At that time, the only persons
  who knew the state of affairs were Penrose, Horridge and Brodribb; and even
  they knew it very imperfectly. Brodribb, himself, was not certain whether
  there was or was not a will. As to Pettigrew, there is no evidence, or any
  reason for believing, that he had any knowledge, or even suspicion, that
  Oliver's estate was not duly disposed of by a will."</p>

  <p>"Penrose knew, more or less, how matters stood," said Lockhart, "and he
  may have 'let on' to Pettigrew."</p>

  <p>"That is possible," Thorndyke admitted, "though it would be rather unlike
  the secretive Penrose to babble about his private affairs to a comparative
  stranger. For it seems pretty certain that he had no idea as to who Parrott
  was. Mrs. Pettigrew almost certainly knew who he was, but she must have been
  sworn to secrecy, and she kept the secret loyally. Still, we must admit the
  possibility of Penrose having made some unguarded statements to Parrott,
  unlikely as it seems."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Lockhart, "if you reject the money as the impelling motive,
  what is there left? What other motive do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"I am not in a position to make any definite suggestion," replied
  Thorndyke, "but I have a vague feeling that there may have been a motive of
  another kind; a motive that would fit in better with the circumstances of the
  murder&mdash;or homicide&mdash;in so far as they are known to us."</p>

  <p>"I am not sure that I quite follow you," said Lockhart.</p>

  <p>"I mean," Thorndyke explained, "that the money theory of motive would
  imply a deliberate, planned, unconditional murder with carefully prepared
  means of execution; and the method would involve the necessary detail of
  taking the victim unaware and forestalling any possibility of resistance. But
  that is not what happened. The weapon with which Penrose was killed was not
  brought there by his assailant. It was his own weapon. So that the method of
  homicide actually used must have been improvised. And Penrose must have been
  either on the defensive or offensive. There was an encounter. But it was a
  deadly encounter, as we can judge by the formidable weapon used, not a mere
  chance 'scrap'. And the deadliness of that encounter implies something more
  than a sudden disagreement. There is a suggestion of something involving a
  fierce and bitter enmity. Perhaps it is possible to imagine some cause of
  deadly strife between these two men. But I knew very little of either of
  them; and before I offer even a tentative suggestion, I would ask you,
  Lockhart, who at least knew them better than I did, if anything occurs to
  you."</p>

  <p>"They were both practically strangers to me," said Lockhart. "I knew
  nothing of their relations except as buyer and seller. But could you put your
  question a little more definitely?"</p>

  <p>"I will put it quite definitely," Thorndyke replied. "Looking back on your
  relations with these two men, and considering them by the light of what we
  now know, does it appear to you that there was anything that might have been
  the occasion of enmity between them or that might have caused one of them to
  go in fear of the other?"</p>

  <p>Lockhart looked at Thorndyke in evident surprise, but he did not reply
  immediately. He appeared to be turning the question over in his mind and
  considering its bearing. And then a little frown appeared on his brow as if
  some new and rather surprising idea had occurred to him.</p>

  <p>"I think I see what is in your mind, Thorndyke," he replied, at length;
  "and I am not sure that you aren't right. The idea had never occurred to me
  before; but now, looking back as you say, by the light of what we know, I am
  disposed to think that there may have been some occasion of enmity, and
  especially of fear. But you don't want my opinions. I had better relate the
  actual experiences that I am thinking of.</p>

  <p>"I have told you about my visit to Penrose when he showed me his
  collection of jewels, which we now know to have been the stolen Billington
  collection."</p>

  <p>"Do you think," Thorndyke asked, "that Penrose knew they were stolen
  property?"</p>

  <p>"I can hardly think that," Lockhart replied, "or he would surely never
  have let me see them. But I do think that he had some uneasy suspicions that
  there may have been something a little fishy about them. I have told you how
  startled he seemed when I jocosely suggested that the Jacobite Jewel was a
  rather incriminating possession. My impression is that he may have got the
  collection comparatively cheap, on the condition that no questions were to be
  asked."</p>

  <p>"Which," I remarked, "usually means that the goods are stolen
  property."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Lockhart admitted, "that is so. But I am afraid that your really
  acquisitive collector is not always extremely scrupulous. However, there the
  things were, obviously property of considerable value, and I naturally raised
  the question of insurance. Penrose was quite alive to the desirability of
  insuring the jewels. But he was in a difficulty. Before they could be
  insured, they would have to be valued; and he had an apparently unaccountable
  objection to their being seen by a valuer. I put this down to his inveterate
  habit of secrecy. Now, of course, we know that he was doubtful of the safety
  of letting a stranger&mdash;and an expert stranger, too&mdash;see what they
  were. But he agreed in principle and promised to think over the problem of
  the valuer.</p>

  <p>"Now, on the only occasion when I met Parrott in the flesh, it happened
  that Penrose was present. The meeting occurred in Parrott's workshop when I
  was waiting for a table that poor Tims had been repairing and Penrose was
  waiting for Mr. Polton. By way of making conversation, I rather foolishly
  asked Penrose what he was doing about the valuer. I saw instantly that I had
  made a faux pas in referring to the matter before Parrott, for
  Penrose&mdash;usually a most suave and amiable man&mdash;snapped out a very
  short answer and was obviously extremely annoyed.</p>

  <p>"At the moment, Parrott made no comment and seemed not to have noticed
  what had passed. But as soon as Penrose had gone, he opened the subject of
  the insurance and the valuer; and as I, having been sworn to secrecy, was
  necessarily evasive in my answers, he pressed the matter more closely and
  went on to question me in the most searching and persistent fashion as to
  what I had seen and whether Penrose had shown me anything more than the
  contents of the large gallery. It was very awkward as I could not give him a
  straight answer, and eventually I had to cut the interrogation short by
  making a hasty retreat.</p>

  <p>"Looking back on this interview, I now see a new significance in it.
  Parrott was undoubtedly angry. He was quiet and restrained, but I detected an
  undercurrent of deep resentment, the occasion of which I entirely
  misunderstood, putting it down to mere pique on his part that Penrose should
  have contemplated employing a strange valuer when he, Parrott, could have
  managed the business quite competently. And I also misunderstood the drift of
  his questions, for I assumed that he knew nothing of the jewels and was
  merely curious as to whether Penrose had any things of value which had been
  obtained through some other dealer. Now I see that he suspected Penrose of
  having shown me the jewels and was trying to find out definitely whether he
  had or had not. And I think that my evasive answers must have convinced him I
  had seen the jewels."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "I think you are right. And what do you infer from
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Lockhart, "by the light of what we now know, certain
  conclusions seem to emerge. The jewels were sold to Penrose by Crabbe, but I
  think we are agreed that Parrott&mdash;I will still call him Parrott as that
  is the name by which I knew him&mdash;was the go-between who actually
  negotiated the deal. Now, as these jewels were a complete collection,
  instantly identifiable by any one who had seen them, and of which the police
  had a full description, I think it follows that they must have been sold to
  Penrose with the condition that he should maintain inviolable secrecy as to
  their being in his possession and that he should neither show them nor
  disclose their existence to anybody. Do you agree?"</p>

  <p>"I do, certainly," Thorndyke replied. "It seems impossible that they could
  have been sold on any other conditions."</p>

  <p>"Moreover," Lockhart continued, "there is nothing improbable in such a
  condition. Penrose wanted the things, not for display, but for the purpose of
  gloating over in secret. In consideration of a low price, he would be quite
  willing to accept the condition of secrecy. Very well, then; we are agreed
  that Penrose must have been bound by a promise of secrecy to Parrott, on the
  faithful performance of which Parrott's safety depended. Consequently, when
  it appeared to Parrott that Penrose had broken his promise by showing me the
  jewels and that he was actually contemplating their disclosure to a valuer
  (who would almost certainly recognise them), he would suddenly see himself
  placed in a position of great and imminent danger. Penrose's indiscretion
  threatened to send him to penal servitude. In your own phrase, Parrott must
  thenceforth have gone in fear of Penrose. But when a man of a criminal type
  like Parrott goes in fear of another, there has arisen a fairly adequate
  motive for the murder of that other. I think that answers your question."</p>

  <p>"It does, very completely," said Thorndyke. "It brings into view exactly
  the kind of motive for which I have been looking. The money motive, even if
  Pettigrew had known about the intestacy, would have seemed hardly sufficient.
  Deliberate, planned murder for the purpose of pecuniary profit is rare. But
  murder planned and committed for the purpose of removing some person whose
  existence is a menace to the safety of the murderer, is relatively common.
  The motive of fear is understandable, and, in a sense, reasonable. It may
  even be, in certain circumstances, justifiable. But in any case, it is a
  strong and urgent motive, impelling to immediate action and making it worth
  while to take risks. You don't remember the date of your interview with
  Parrott, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," replied Lockhart, "but it must have been quite a short time
  before Penrose's disappearance, for, when I came back to London, he had been
  absent for a month or two. It looks as if the murder had followed pretty
  closely on that interview."</p>

  <p>"And now, Thorndyke," said I, "that you have heard Lockhart's story, what
  is your final conclusion? Apparently you exclude the money motive
  altogether."</p>

  <p>"I would hardly say that," he replied, "because, after all, we have no
  certain knowledge. But I see no reason to suppose that Pettigrew knew
  anything about his position as next of kin until he saw Brodribb's
  advertisement. On the other hand, from the moment when he became a party to
  the sale of the jewels, he was at Penrose's mercy; and as soon as he formed
  the definite suspicion that Penrose was not keeping faith with him, he had a
  perfectly understandable motive for making away with Penrose."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, "you think it was a deliberate, premeditated murder?"</p>

  <p>"I think that is the conclusion that we are driven to," he replied. "At
  any rate, we must conclude that Pettigrew lured Penrose to that place with
  the idea of murder in his mind. The intention may have been conditional on
  what happened there; on whether, for instance, Penrose could or would clear
  himself of the charge of bad faith. But the remarkable suitability of the
  time and place, both for the murder, itself, and for the secure disposal of
  the body, seems to imply a careful selection and a considered intention."</p>

  <p>"What makes you suggest that the intention may have been conditional?"
  Lockhart asked.</p>

  <p>"There are two facts," Thorndyke replied, "which seem to offer that
  suggestion. The piece of pottery that we found in Pettigrew's pocket shows
  clearly that an excavation was actually carried out by the two men. There
  would certainly have been no collecting of pottery after the murder. Then the
  fact that Penrose was killed with his own weapon suggests a quarrel, and a
  pretty violent one, for Penrose must, himself, have produced his weapon. But
  when Pettigrew had got possession of that weapon, his behaviour was
  unmistakable. He struck to kill. It was no mere tap on the head. It was a
  murderous blow into which the assailant put his whole strength.</p>

  <p>"So, taking all the facts into account, I think our verdict must be wilful
  murder, not only in the legal sense&mdash;which it obviously was&mdash;but in
  the sense in which ordinary men use the words. But it is an impressive and
  disturbing thought that only by a hair's-breadth did he miss escaping
  completely. He had abandoned and hidden the car and was sneaking off in the
  darkness to disappear for ever, unknown and unsuspected. But for the
  incalculable chance of his being knocked down by that unknown car or lorry,
  he would have got away without leaving a trace, and we should still be
  looking for the missing Penrose."</p>

  <p>There was a short interval of silence when Thorndyke had concluded. Then
  Elmhurst remarked:</p>

  <p>"It is rather a gruesome thought, that of the two men digging away
  amicably into the barrow when one of them must have known that the other was
  almost certainly digging his own grave."</p>

  <p>"It is," I agreed. "But Thorndyke's interpretation of the facts suggests
  some other strange and gruesome pictures; that, for instance, of the murderer
  reading Brodribb's advertisement and realising that his murderous blow had
  been worth fifty thousand pounds; and his visit to New Square to collect his
  earnings."</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed," moralised Elmhurst, "and he collected them truly enough. It
  is a satisfaction to think of that moment of disillusionment when he saw his
  ill-gotten fortune turn to dust and ashes and realised that, for him as for
  others, the wages of sin was death."</p>
