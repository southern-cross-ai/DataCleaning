<p><b>The Old World.<br>
1926.</b></p>

<p>Hello Charley old hand, How are you?</p>

<p>I just thought I would drop you a line and tell you how things are a
working on the old range since you left. Old Timer you don't know how
we miss you, Gee but its been lonesome since you left, even to us away
down here in California, where we dident get to see near as much of you
as we wanted to anyhow. But think what all them old Montana Waddies are
thinking. Why some of these old Birds would miss their wives less than
they do you.</p>

<p>Nancy come down to California this fall as usual her and Jack, I
dident want to tell her so and she tried to let on they wasent but I
tell you they was a pretty sad looking outfit. They sho was a lonesome
layout. Nancy and I talked over the usual old routine about "it all
being for the best, and that you had a better job, and would do maby
better work there than you did here," Yes we both said that we kinder
agreed in our talk with each other, and we joshed it off and sorter
smiled a little, but I want to tell you that it was a mighty sickly
little grin, and between you and me, in our own hearts we knew we were
both trying to load each other, We knew in each others own hearts that
we couldent see why you had to go and switch outfits, just when you had
got to be Boss of this one.</p>

<p>You know I hadent seen you in about a year, and she told me the most
part of that Time, that you were working on a Book of yours even more
than on your Paintings, She said you had the thing all just finished
up. She said she wanted me to write a sort of an introduction to the
book, Said you wanted me to before you left. My Lord Charley you know I
cant write any Introduction, thats for writers to do, Why a book like
you got Charley that you put all your best Stories in, and spent all
that time drawing, I bet a hundred wonderful pictures are with it, Why
you ought to have somebody turn an introduction out of the "schute"
that would really turn on some high grade words, and doctor them up
with some pretty salty ideas. It ought to be sorter classy, I couldent
try to make it funny in the introduction, for you know yourself Charley
what chance I got being in the same book with my little maverick brand
along side of your outfit of humor. Why you never heard me open my
mouth when you was around, and you never knew any of our friends that
would let me open it as long as there was a chance to get you to tell
another one. I always did say that you could tell a story better than
any man that ever lived. If I could a got you to quit that crazy
painting idea, and took up something worth while like joke telling, Why
I would a set you out there on the stage at the tail end of an old
chuck wagon, hunched up on an old roll of "Sougans" and a "prop"
campfire burning in your face, Say you would have been the biggest
thing that ever fit in while the "Glorified Beauties" was changing
their color of powder. But you would dab around with them old brushes,
and squeeze a handful of mud into the shape of some old "limber neck"
bronk, You looked to me at times like you would ruther be a good dirt
dobber, or a sort of an old painter than just about anything.</p>

<p>Now I am going to try to talk Nancy out of that introduction Gag to
that book, Every one of your old friends are too anxious to get into
the book, to be messing around with any introduction anyway, I don't
know why it is but everyone of them feel that this book will be more
like you than anything you have done. We can just set there by the hour
and imagine you telling that very yarn, and then we can look at the
drawing and you will show us in it the things that we might never get
if it wasent for you pointing it out to us, I bet we get many a laugh
out of all those comical drawings. I want to see old Ed Borein when he
starts a pointing out all the little cute things in the pictures that
he thinks we don't get. Some of them stories of yours is going to be
mighty sad when somebody else tries to tell em like you did. They say
your range is up on a high Mountain and you can look down on all these
little outfits like ours, You will get many a quiet laugh hearing
modern "grangers" trying to unload one of your old favorites.</p>

<p>There aint much news here to tell you, You know the big Boss gent
sent a hand over and got you so quick Charley, But I guess He needed a
good man pretty bad, I hear they been a working shorthanded over there
pretty much all the time, I guess its hard for Him to get hold of good
men, they are just getting scarce everywhere. But you was gone one
morning before the old cook could roll out, and when you beat him up
you are stepping, But after we had realized that you had rolled your
Bed and gone, it sure would a done your old hide good to a seen what
they all thought of you, You know how it is yourself with a fellow
leaving an outfit and going over to another, in talking it over after
he has gone there is generally a BUT to it somewhere, Some old "Peeler"
will unload some dirt about him, But there sure wasent any after you
crossed the skyline, Why it would a been almost worth your going to a
new Outfit just to have heard all the fine things said about you. Why
even a lot of them old Reprobates (that perhaps owed you money) they
said "we may have Painters in time to come, that will be just as good
as old Charley, We may have Cowboys just as good, and we may
occasionally round up a pretty good man, But us, and the manicured
tribe that is following us, will never have the Real Cowboy, Painter
and Man, combined that old Charley was, For we aint got no more real
cowboys, and we aint got no real Cows to paint, and we just don't raise
no more of his kind of men, and if by a Miracle we did get all that
combination why it just wouldent be Charley."</p>

<p>Why you old Rascal you would a thought you was somebody. Why the
Governor and the State Legislature of that big old commonwealth of
Montana, said you was the biggest thing ever produced in the State,
That your work would live and be known when maby Montana was the
central part of Japan. Why we got ahold of Editorials by big Writers
and Art Guys from all over the east, that said that you was the Michael
Angelo of the west, (Thats some Dago over there that was as big in his
day as Mussolini is now), You never was much for swelling up, but I
tell you your old hat band would be busted if you had heard what was
said about you.</p>

<p>Ah! but it was wonderful Charley, and it did please your old friends
that the world recognized you. But somehow that dident seem to repay
us, It wasent what you had done, it wasent because you paint a horse
and a cow and a cowboy better than any man that ever lived, I don't
know, it was just you Charley, We want you here if you couldent
whitewash a fence, We are just sorter selfish I guess, Why when you
left there was actually old "Rounders" cried, that you would a bet your
last sack of tobacco that dident have any more sentiment than a wet
saddle blanket. Why even your old horse followed you off with your
saddle on, if you had looked back you would a seen him.</p>

<p>But we all know you are getting along fine, You will get along fine
anywhere, I bet you hadent been up there three days till you had out
your old Pencial and was a drawing something funny about some of their
old punchers. That makes us want to see you more than ever for we know
that you will have some new ones for us about some of them Sky Line
Riders up there. I bet you Mark Twain and Old Bill Nye, and Whitcomb
Riley and a whole bunch of those old Joshers was just a waiting for you
to pop in with all the latest ones, What kind of a Bird is Washington
and Jefferson I bet they are regula fellows when you meet em aint they?
Most big men are. I would like to see the bunch that is gathered around
you the first time you tell the one about putting the Limburger Cheese
in the old Nestors Whiskers, Don't tell that Charley till you get
Lincoln around you, he would love that, I bet you and him kinder throw
in together when you get well acquainted, Darn it when I get to
thinking about all them Top Hands up there, If I could just hold a
Horse wrangling job with em, I wouldent mind following that wagon
myself.</p>

<p>Write me about Bret Harte, and O Henry, I bet there is a couple of
Guys standing guard together, auger awhile with them, and you will get
many a laugh.</p>

<p>With that sign language that you "savvy" why you can gab with any of
those old "hombres" up there, Tie in to that old Napoleon some time and
pick a load into him, you ought to get something pretty good from him,
if it aint nothing but about war, and women.</p>

<p>At first we couldent understand why they moved you, but we can now,
They had every kind of a great man up there, but they just dident have
any great Cowboy Artist like you. Shucks! on the luck, there was only
one of you and he couldent use you both places.</p>

<p>You will run onto my old Dad up there Charley, For he was a real
Cowhand and bet he is running a wagon, and you will pop into some well
kept ranch house over under some cool shady trees and you will be asked
to have dinner, and it will be the best one you ever had in your life,
Well, when you are a thanking the women folks, You just tell the sweet
looking little old lady that you know her boy back on an outfit you
used to rep for, and tell the daughters that you knew their brother,
and if you see a cute looking little rascal running around there kiss
him for me. Well cant write you any more Charley dam papers all wet, It
must be raining in this old bunk house.</p>

<p>Course we are all just a hanging on here as long as we can. I don't
know why we hate to go, we know its better there, Maby its because we
havent done anything that will live after we are gone. from your old
friend,</p>

<p><b>WILL.</b></p>

<h2><a name="ch0-1"></a>A FEW WORDS ABOUT MYSELF</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p><b>(A personal introduction written by the author but a few months
before his death)</b></p>

<p>The papers have been kind to me many times more kind than true.
Although I worked for many years on the range, I am not what the people
think a cowboy should be. I was neither a good roper nor rider. I was a
night wrangler. How good I was, I'll leave it for the people I worked
for to say there are still a few of them living. In the spring I
wrangled horses, in the fall I herded beef. I worked for the big
outfits and always held my job.</p>

<p>I have many friends among cowmen and cowpunchers. I have always been
what is called a good mixer I had friends when I had nothing else. My
friends were not always within the law, but I haven't said how
law-abiding I was myself. I haven't been too bad nor too good to get
along with.</p>

<p>Life has never been too serious with me I lived to play and I'm
playing yet. Laughs and good judgment have saved me many a black eye,
but I don't laugh at other's tears. I was a wild young man, but age has
made me gentle. I drank, but never alone, and when I drank it was no
secret. I am still friendly with drinking men.</p>

<p>My friends are mixed preachers, priests, and sinners. I belong to no
church, but am friendly toward and respect all of them. I have always
liked horses and since I was eight years old have always owned a
few.</p>

<p>I am old-fashioned and peculiar in my dress. I am eccentric (that is
a polite way of saying you're crazy). I believe in luck and have had
lots of it.</p>

<p>To have talent is no credit to its owner; what man can't help he
should get neither credit nor blame for it's not his fault.</p>

<p>I am an illustrator. There are lots better ones, but some worse.</p>

<p>Any man that can make a living doing what he likes is lucky, and I'm
that. Any time I cash in now, I win.</p>

<h3><a name="ch1-1"></a>THE STORY OF THE COWPUNCHER</h3>

<p>"Speakin' of cowpunchers," says Rawhide Rawlins, "I'm glad to see in
the last few years that them that know the business have been writin'
about 'em. It begin to look like they'd be wiped out without a history.
Up to a few years ago there's mighty little known about cows and cow
people. It was sure amusin' to read some of them old stories about
cowpunchin'. You'd think a puncher growed horns an' was haired
over.</p>

<p>"It put me in mind of the eastern girl that asks her mother:</p>

<p>"'Ma,' says she, 'do cowboys eat grass?' 'No, dear,' says the old
lady, 'they're part human,' an' I don't know but the old gal had 'em
sized up right. If they are human, they're a separate species. I'm
talkin' about the old-time ones, before the country's strung with wire
an' nesters had grabbed all the water, an' a cowpuncher's home was big.
It wasn't where he took his hat off, but where he spread his blankets.
He ranged from Mexico to the Big Bow River of the north, an' from where
the trees get scarce in the east to the old Pacific. He don't need no
iron hoss, but covers his country on one that eats grass an' wears
hair. All the tools he needed was saddle, bridle, quirt, hackamore, an'
rawhide riatta or seagrass rope; that covered his hoss.</p>

<p>"The puncher himself was rigged, startin' at the top, with a good
hat not one of the floppy kind you see in pictures, with the rim turned
up in front. The top-cover he wears holds its shape an' was made to
protect his face from the weather; maybe to hold it on, he wore a
buckskin string under the chin or back of the head. Round his neck a
big silk handkerchief, tied loose, an' in the drag of a trail herd it
was drawn over the face to the eyes, hold-up fashion, to protect the
nose an' throat from dust. In old times, a leather blab or mask was
used the same. Coat, vest, an' shirt suits his own taste. Maybe he'd
wear California pants, light buckskin in color, with large brown plaid,
sometimes foxed, or what you'd call reinforced with buck or antelope
skin. Over these came his chaparejos or leggin's. His feet were covered
with good high-heeled boots, finished off with steel spurs of Spanish
pattern. His weapon's usually a forty-five Colt's six-gun, which is
packed in a belt, swingin' a little below his right hip. Sometimes a
Winchester in a scabbard, slung to his saddle under his
stirrup-leather, either right or left side, but generally left, stock
forward, lock down, as his rope hangs at his saddle-fork on the
right.</p>

<p>"By all I can find out from old, gray-headed punchers, the cow
business started in California, an' the Spaniards were the first to
burn marks on their cattle an' hosses, an' use the rope. Then men from
the States drifted west to Texas, pickin' up the brandin' iron an'
lass-rope, an' the business spread north, east, an' west, till the
spotted long-horns walked in every trail marked out by their brown
cousins, the buffalo.</p>

<p>"Texas an' California, bein' the startin' places, made two species
of cowpunchers; those west of the Rockies rangin' north, usin'
centerfire or single-cinch saddles, with high fork an' cantle; packed a
sixty or sixty-five foot rawhide rope, an' swung a big loop. These cow
people were generally strong on pretty, usin' plenty of hoss jewelry,
silver-mounted spurs, bits, an' conchas; instead of a quirt, used a
romal, or quirt braided to the end of the reins. Their saddles were
full stamped, with from twenty-four to twenty-eight-inch eagle-bill
tapaderos. Their chaparejos were made of fur or hair, either bear,
angora goat, or hair sealskin. These fellows were sure fancy, an'
called themselves buccaroos, coming from the Spanish word,
vaquero."</p>

<p><b>A CENTER-FIRE FASHION LEADER</b></p>
</center>

<p>"The cowpuncher east of the Rockies originated in Texas and ranged
north to the Big Bow. He wasn't so much for pretty; his saddle was low
horn, rimfire, or double-cinch; sometimes 'macheer.' Their rope was
seldom over forty feet, for being a good deal in a brush country, they
were forced to swing a small loop. These men generally tied, instead of
taking their dallie-welts, or wrapping their rope around the saddle
horn. Their chaparejos were made of heavy bullhide, to protect the leg
from brush an' thorns, with hog-snout tapaderos.</p>

<p>"Cowpunchers were mighty particular about their rig, an' in all the
camps you'd find a fashion leader. From a cowpuncher's idea, these
fellers was sure good to look at, an' I tell you right now, there ain't
no prettier sight for my eyes than one of those good-lookin',
long-backed cowpunchers, sittin' up on a high-forked, full-stamped
California saddle with a live hoss between his legs.</p>

<p>"Of course a good many of these fancy men were more ornamental than
useful, but one of the best cow-hands I ever knew belonged to this
class. Down on the Gray Bull, he went under the name of Mason, but most
punchers called him Pretty Shadow. This sounds like an Injun name, but
it ain't. It comes from a habit some punchers has of ridin' along,
lookin' at their shadows. Lookin' glasses are scarce in cow outfits, so
the only chance for these pretty boys to admire themselves is on
bright, sunshiny days. Mason's one of these kind that doesn't get much
pleasure out of life in cloudy weather. His hat was the best; his boots
was made to order, with extra long heels. He rode a center-fire,
full-stamped saddle, with twenty-eight-inch tapaderos; bearskin
ancaroes, or saddle pockets; his chaparejos were of the same skin. He
packed a sixty-five-foot rawhide. His spurs an' bit were silver inlaid,
the last bein' a Spanish spade. But the gaudiest part of his regalia
was his gun. It's a forty-five Colt's, silverplated an' chased with
gold. Her handle is pearl, with a bull's head carved on.</p>

<p>"When the sun hits Mason with all this silver on, he blazes up like
some big piece of jewelry. You could see him for miles when he's ridin'
high country. Barrin' Mexicans, he's the fanciest cow dog I ever see,
an' don't think he don't savvy the cow. He knows what she says to her
calf. Of course there wasn't many of his stripe. All punchers liked
good rigs, but plainer; an' as most punchers 're fond of gamblin' an'
spend their spare time at stud poker or monte, they can't tell what
kind of a rig they'll be ridin' the next day. I've seen many a good rig
lost over a blanket. It depends how lucky the cards fall what kind of a
rig a man's ridin'.</p>

<p>"I'm talkin' about old times, when cowmen were in their glory. They
lived different, talked different, an' had different ways. No matter
where you met him, or how he's rigged, if you'd watch him close he'd do
something that would tip his hand. I had a little experience back in
'83 that'll show what I'm gettin' at.</p>

<p>"I was winterin' in Cheyenne. One night a stranger stakes me to buck
the bank. I got off lucky an' cash in fifteen hundred dollars. Of
course I cut the money in two with my friend, but it leaves me with the
biggest roll I ever packed. All this wealth makes Cheyenne look small,
an' I begin longin' for bigger camps, so I drift for Chicago. The
minute I hit the burg, I shed my cow garments an' get into white man's
harness. A hard hat, boiled shirt, laced shoes all the gearin' known to
civilized man. When I put on all this rig, I sure look human; that is,
I think so. But them shorthorns know me, an' by the way they trim that
roll, it looks like somebody's pinned a card on my back with the word
'EASY' in big letters. I ain't been there a week till my roll don't
need no string around it, an' I start thinkin' about home. One evenin'
I throw in with the friendliest feller I ever met. It was at the bar of
the hotel where I'm camped. I don't just remember how we got
acquainted, but after about fifteen drinks we start holdin' hands an'
seein' who could buy the most and fastest. I remember him tellin' the
barslave not to take my money, 'cause I'm his friend. Afterwards, I
find out the reason for this goodheartedness; he wants it all an' hates
to see me waste it. Finally, he starts to show me the town an' says it
won't cost me a cent. Maybe he did, but I was unconscious, an' wasn't
in shape to remember. Next day, when I come to, my hair's sore an' I
didn't know the days of the week, month, or what year it was.</p>

<p>"The first thing I do when I open my eyes is to look at the winders.
There's no bars on 'em, an' I feel easier. I'm in a small room with two
bunks. The one opposite me holds a feller that's smokin' a cigarette
an' sizin' me up between whiffs while I'm dress-in'. I go through
myself but I'm too late. Somebody beat me to it. I'm lacin' my shoes
an' thinkin' hard, when the stranger speaks:</p>

<p>"Neighbor, you're a long way from your range.'</p>

<p>"You call the turn,' says I, 'but how did you read my iron?'</p>

<p>"I didn't see a burn on you,' says he, 'an' from looks, you'll go as
a slick-ear. It's your ways, while I'm layin' here, watchin' you get
into your garments. Now, humans dress up an' punchers dress down. When
you raised, the first thing you put on is your hat. Another thing that
shows you up is you don't shed your shirt when you bed down. So next
comes your vest an' coat, keepin' your hindquarters covered till you
slide into your pants, an' now you're lacin' your shoes. I notice you
done all of it without quittin' the blankets, like the ground's cold. I
don't know what state or territory you hail from, but you've smelt
sagebrush an' drank alkali. I heap savvy you. You've slept a whole lot
with nothin' but sky over your head, an' there's times when that old
roof leaks, but judgin' from appearances, you wouldn't mind a little
open air right now.'</p>

<p>"This feller's my kind, an' he stakes me with enough to get back to
the cow country."</p>

<h3><a name="ch1-2"></a>A GIFT HORSE</h3>

<p>Charley Furiman tells me about a hoss he owns and if you're able to
stay on him he'll take you to the end of the trail. The gent Charley
got him from, says he, "Gentle? He's a pet." (This man hates to part
with him.) "He's a lady's hoss. You can catch him anywhere with a
biscuit."</p>

<p>Next day Charley finds out he's a lady's hoss, all right, but he
don't like men. Furiman ain't a mile from his corral when he slips the
pack. Charley crawls him again kinder careful and rides him sixty miles
an' he don't turn a hair. Next day he saddles him he acts like he's
harmless but he's looking for something. He's out about ten mile.
Charley notices he travels with one ear down. This ain't a good sign,
but Charley gets careless and about noon he comes to a dry creek bed
where there's lots of boulders. That's what this cayuse is looking for
'cause right in the middle of the boulder-strewn flat is where he
breaks in two and unloads. Charley tells me, "I don't miss none of them
boulders an' where I light there's nothing gives but different parts of
me. For a while I wonder where I'm at and when things do clear up it
comes to me right quick. I forgot to bring the biscuits. How am I going
to catch him? If I had a Winchester, I'd catch him just over the
eye.</p>

<p>"To make a long story short, I followed him back to the ranch afoot.
Walking ain't my strong holt an' these boulder bumps don't help me
none. Next morning after a good night's sleep, I feel better. Going out
to the corral, I offer this cayuse a biscuit, thinkin' I'll start off
friendly. He strikes at me and knocks my hat off. My pardner tries to
square it by telling me I ain't got the right kind. 'That's a lady's
hoss,' says he, 'and being a pet, he wants them little lady's biscuits;
it's enough to make him sore, handing him them sour doughs.'</p>

<p>"While I'm getting my hat, I happen to think of a friend of mine
that's got married and I ain't give him no wedding present. This friend
of mine is a bronk rider named Con Price. So while my heart's good, I
saddle a gentle hoss and lead this man-hater over and presents him to
Price with my best wishes.</p>

<p>"I don't meet Con till next fall on the beef roundup. He ain't too
friendly. Next morning when we're roping hosses, he steps up to me and
says, kinder low, holdin' out his hand to shake, 'Charley, I'm letting
bygones be bygones, but if I get married again anywhere in your
neighborhood, don't give me no wedding presents. If you do you'll get
lots of flowers."</p>

FLAT"</b></p>

<h3><a name="ch1-3"></a>A SAVAGE SANTA CLAUS</h3>

<p>"Talkin' about Christmas," said Bedrock, as we smoked in his cabin
after supper, an' the wind howled as it sometimes can on a blizzardy
December night, "puts me in mind of one I spent in the '60s. Me an' a
feller named Jake Mason, but better knowed as Beaver, is trappin' an'
prospectin' on the head of the Porcupine. We've struck some placer, but
she's too cold to work her. The snow's drove all the game out of the
country, an' barrin' a few beans and some flour, we're plum out of
grub, so we decide we'd better pull our freight before we're snowed
in.</p>

<p>"The winter's been pretty open till then, but the day we start
there's a storm breaks loose that skins everything I ever seed. It
looks like the snow-maker's been holdin' back, an' turned the whole
winter supply loose at once. Cold? Well, it would make a polar bear
hunt cover.</p>

<p>"About noon it lets up enough so we can see our pack-hosses. We're
joggin' along at a good gait, when old Baldy, our lead packhoss, stops
an' swings 'round in the trail, bringin' the other three to a stand.
His whinner causes me to raise my head, an' lookin' under my hat brim,
I'm plenty surprised to see an old log shack not ten feet to the side
of the trail."</p>

<center>
<p><a name="trails-04"></a><img alt="" src=
"0700941h-images/0700941h-04.jpg"></p>

<p><b>"I'M PLENTY SURPRISED TO SEE AN OLD LOG SHACK NOT TEN FEET TO THE
SIDE OF THE TRAIL"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"'I guess we'd better take that cayuse's advice,' says Beaver,
pintin' to Baldy, who's got his ears straightened, lookin' at us as
much as to say: 'What, am I packin' fer Pilgrims; or don't you know
enough to get in out of the weather? It looks like you'd loosen these
packs.' So, takin' Baldy's hunch, we unsaddle.</p>

<p>"This cabin's mighty ancient. It's been two rooms, but the
ridge-pole on the rear one's rotted an' let the roof down. The door's
wide open an' hangs on a wooden hinge. The animal smell I get on the
inside tells me there ain't no humans lived there for many's the
winter. The floor's strewn with pine cones an' a few scattered bones,
showin' it's been the home of mountain-rats an' squirrels. Takin' it
all 'n all, it ain't no palace, but, in this storm, it looks mighty
snug, an' when we get a blaze started in the fireplace an' the beans
goin' it's comfortable.</p>

<p>"The door to the back's open, an' by the light of the fire I can see
the roof hangin' down V-shaped, leavin' quite a little space agin the
wall. Once I had a notion of walkin' in an' prospectin' the place, but
there's somethin' ghostly about it an' I change my mind.</p>

<p>"When we're rollin' in that night, Beaver asks me what day of the
month it is.</p>

<p>"'If I'm right on my dates,' says I, 'this is the evenin' the kids
hang up their socks.'</p>

<p>"The hell it is,' says he. 'Well, here's one camp Santy'll probably
overlook. We ain't got no socks nor no place to hang 'em, an' I don't
think the old boy'd savvy our foot-rags.' That's the last I remember
till I'm waked up along in the night by somethin' monkeyin' with the
kettle.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't fer a snufflin' noise I could hear, I'd a-tuk it fer a
trade-rat, but with this noise it's no guess with me, an' I call the
turn all right, 'cause when I take a peek, there, humped between me an'
the fire, is the most robust silvertip I ever see. In size, he
resembles a load of hay. The fire's down low, but there's enough light
to give me his outline. He's humped over, busy with the beans,
snifflin' an' whinin' pleasant, like he enjoys 'em. I nudged Beaver
easy, an' whispers: 'Santy Claus is here.'</p>

<p>"He don't need but one look. 'Yes,' says he, reachin' for his Henry,
'but he ain't brought nothin' but trouble, an' more'n a sock full of
that. You couldn't crowd it into a wagon-box.'</p>

<p>"This whisperin' disturbs Mr. Bear, an' he straightens up till he
near touches the ridge-pole. He looks eight feet tall. Am I scared?
Well, I'd tell a man. By the feelin' runnin' up and down my back, if I
had bristles I'd resemble a wild hog. The cold sweat's drippin' off my
nose, an' I ain't got nothin' on me but sluice-ice.</p>

<p>"The bark of Beaver's Henry brings me out of this scare. The bear
goes over, upsettin' a kettle of water, puttin' the fire out. If it
wasn't for a stream of fire runnin' from Beaver's weapon, we'd be in
plumb darkness. The bear's up agin, bellerin' an' bawlin', and comin'
at us mighty warlike, and by the time I get my Sharps workin', I'm near
choked with smoke. It's the noisiest muss I was ever mixed up in.
Between the smoke, the barkin' of the guns an' the bellerin' of the
bear, it's like hell on a holiday."</p>

<p><b>"THE BEAR'S COMIN' AT US MIGHTY WARLIKE"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"I'm gropin' for another ca'tridge when I hear the lock on Beaver's
gun click, an' I know his magazine's dry. Lowerin' my hot gun, I
listen. Everythin's quiet now. In the sudden stillness I can hear the
drippin' of blood. It's the bear's life runnin' out.</p>

<p>"'I guess it's all over,' says Beaver, kind of shaky. 'It was a
short fight, but a fast one, an' hell was poppin' while she
lasted.'</p>

<p>"When we get the fire lit, we take a look at the battle ground.
There lays Mr. Bear in a ring of blood, with a hide so full of holes he
wouldn't hold hay. I don't think there's a bullet went 'round him.</p>

<p>"This excitement wakens us so we don't sleep no more that night. We
breakfast on bear meat. He's an old bear an' it's pretty stout, but a
feller livin' on beans and bannocks straight for a couple of weeks
don't kick much on flavor, an' we're at a stage where meat's meat.</p>

<p>"When it comes day, me an' Beaver goes lookin' over the bear's
bedroom. You know, daylight drives away ha'nts, an' this room don't
look near so ghostly as it did last night. After winnin' this fight,
we're both mighty brave. The roof caved in with four or five feet of
snow on, makes the rear room still dark, so, lightin' a pitch-pine
glow, we start explorin'.</p>

<p>"The first thing we bump into is the bear's bunk. There's a rusty
pick layin' up against the wall, an' a gold-pan on the floor, showin'
us that the human that lived there was a miner. On the other side of
the shack we ran onto a pole bunk, with a weather-wrinkled buffalo robe
an' some rotten blankets. The way the roof slants, we can't see into
the bed, but by usin' an axe an' choppin' the legs off, we lower it to
view. When Beaver raises the light, there's the frame-work of a man.
He's layin' on his left side, like he's sleepin', an' looks like he
cashed in easy. Across the bunk, under his head, is an old-fashioned
cap-'n-ball rifle. On the bedpost hangs a powder horn an' pouch, with a
belt an' skinnin' knife. These things tell us that this man's a pretty
old-timer.</p>

<p>"Findin' the pick an' gold-pan causes us to look more careful for
what he'd been diggin'. We explore the bunk from top to bottom, but
nary a find. All day long we prospects. That evenin', when we're
fillin' up on bear meat, beans and bannocks, Beaver says he's goin' to
go through the bear's bunk; so, after we smoke, relightin' our torches,
we start our search again.</p>

<p>"Sizin' up the bear's nest, we see he'd laid there quite a while. It
looks like Mr. Silvertip, when the weather gets cold, starts huntin' a
winter location for his long snooze. Runnin' onto this cabin, vacant,
and lookin' like it's for rent, he jumps the claim an' would have been
snoozin' there yet, but our fire warmin' up the place fools him. He
thinks it's spring an' steps out to look at the weather. On the way he
strikes this breakfast of beans, an' they hold him till we object.</p>

<p>"We're lookin' over this nest when somethin' catches my eye on the
edge of the waller. It's a hole, roofed over with willers.</p>

<p>"'Well, I'll be damned. There's his cache,' says Beaver, whose eyes
has follered mine. It don't take a minute to kick these willers loose,
an' there lays a buckskin sack with five hundred dollars in dust in
it.</p>

<p>"Old Santy Claus, out there,' says Beaver, pointin' to the bear
through the door, 'didn't load our socks, but he brought plenty of meat
an' showed us the cache, for we'd never a-found it if he hadn't raised
the lid.'</p>

<p>"The day after Christmas we buried the bones, wrapped in one of our
blankets, where we'd found the cache. It was the best we could do.</p>

<p>"I guess the dust's ours,' says Beaver. 'There's no papers to show
who's his kin-folks.' So we splits the pile an' leaves him sleepin' in
the tomb he built for himself."</p>

<p><b>COW-HEAD</b></p>
</center>

<p><a name="ch1-4"></a></p>

<h3>DUNC McDONALD</h3>

<p>"Dunc McDonald, the breed, tells about a buffalo hunt he has when
he's a kid," says Rawhide Rawlins. "Like all things that happen that's
worth while, it's a long time ago. He's traveling with his people, the
Blackfeet they're making for the buffalo country. They're across the
range they ain't seen much maybe an old bull once in a while that ain't
worth shootin' at, so they don't disturb nothin'. They're lookin' for
cow meat and lots of it.</p>

<p>"Dunc's traveling ahead of the women with the men. As I said, it's a
long time ago when Injuns ain't got many guns they're mostly armed with
bows and arrows. There's one old man packing a rifle. It's a Hudson Bay
flintlock but a good gun, them days. Duncan is young and has good eyes
that go with youth. He sees a few buffalo in some broken hills, and
tells this old man if he'll lend him his gun, he'll get meat. The old
man don't say nothin', but taking the gun from its skin cover, hands it
to Dunc. Dunc wants bullets and the powder horn but the old man signs
that the gun is loaded, and one ball is enough for any good hunter. The
wolf hunts with what teeth he's got.</p>

<p>"Dunc knows he won't get no more so he rides off. There ain't much
wind, but Dunc's gettin' what there is, and keepin' behind some rock
croppin's he gets pretty close. There are five cows, all laying down.
Pretty soon he quits his pony and crawls to within twenty-five yards
and pulls down a fat cow. When his gun roars, they all jump and run but
the cow he shoots don't make three jumps till she's down.</p>

<p>"When Dunc walks up she's laying on her belly with her feet under
her. She's small but fat. When Dunc puts his foot agin her to push her
over, she gets up and is red-eyed. She sure shows war. The only hold
Dunc can see is her tail and he ain't slow takin' it. The tail-hold on
a buffalo is mighty short, but he's clamped on. She's tryin' to turn
but he's keepin' her steered right and he's doing fine till she starts
kickin'. The first one don't miss his ear the width of a hair. If you
never saw a buffalo kick it's hard to tell you what they can do, but
Dunc ain't slow slippin' his hold.</p>

<p>"There's nothin' left but to run for it. This rock croppin' ain't
over two feet high, but it's all there is. These rocks are covered with
ground cedar and Dunc dives into this. He gophers down in this cedar
till a hawk couldn't find him. He lays there a long time, his heart
poundin' his ribs like it will break through. When the scare works out
of him he raises, and there agin the rock rim lays the cow it's a lung
shot and she's bled to death.</p>

<p>"There's only one hold,' says Dunc, 'shorter than a tail-hold on a
buffalo that of a bear.'"</p>

<h3><a name="ch1-5"></a>THE TRAIL OF THE REEL FOOT</h3>

<p>"Gettin' mighty weary of holin' up in this line camp," said Long
Wilson, scratching the frost from the window and gazing discontentedly
out at the storm. "If the snow ever lets up, it'll be fine trackin'
weather, an' chances 'll be good for a blacktail over on Painted
Ridge."</p>

<p>"Tracks 'd do you a whole lot of good, old scout," said Bowlegs,
sitting up cross-legged in the bunk and rolling a cigarette. "You
couldn't track a bed-wagon through a boghole. I ain't forgot last
winter, when you're lost on Dog Creek. You're ridin' in a circle,
follerin' your own trail, an' you'd a-been there yet if the Cross H
boys hadn't found you. You're a tracker, I don't think."</p>

<p>"Speakin' of trackin'," broke in Dad Lane, the wolfer, "reminds me
of a cripple I knowed who goes by the name of Reel Foot. He's one of
nature's mistakes, a born deformity. It looks like when Old Lady Nature
built him, she starts from the top an' does good work till she gets to
his middle, an' then throws off the job to somebody that's workin' for
fun.</p>

<p>"This cripple was before your time, but he's well known on the lower
Yellerstone in the early '70s. The first winter I ever see Reel Foot
I'm sittin' in a poker game with him. Now, lookin' at him across the
table, he'll average up with any man for shape an' looks, but at this
time I ain't acquainted with him from his waist down.</p>

<p>"For two weeks I've been eatin' plenty booze, an' I'm at that stage
where I see things that ain't there. Old Four-Ace Jack that's handin'
us the beverage, looks like twins; my sight's doublin' up on me. The
game's goin' along smooth enough till I reach for a pot on a pair of
aces, an' Reel Foot claims I only got one. There's quite a little
argument, an' while he's convincin' me I spill some chips. When I'm
gropin' 'round for 'em under the table, I run onto them hoofs, warped
an' twisted. As I said before, I ain't acquainted with his hind
quarters, an' it rattles me till I see feet enough for four men, an'
there's only two of us playin'. This ends the game with me, so cashin'
in, I tell Four-Ace to pour my drink back in the bottle. I'm that shaky
I couldn't empty it into a barrel with the head out, an' don't swallow
no more booze that trip.</p>

<p>"The scare wears off when I get acquainted with Reel Foot, but I
never do look at him without wonderin' which way he's goin' to start
off. His right foot's straight ahead, natural; the left, p'intin' back
on his trail. It's an old sayin', 'a fool for luck,' an' in this case,
I guess it goes with cripples, for it's these twisted hin' legs of
his'n that saves his hide an' hair for him once.</p>

<p>"It happens when he first hits the country from Nebrasky. He's
camped on the Porcupine, an' as trappin's good an' he's figurin' on
staying awhile, he's throwed up a lean-to of brush. He's one of these
kind that don't get lonesome, an' 'lows if you don't mix with no worse
company than animals you're all right. Livin' so long with cayuses, he
savvies 'em an' they understand him. They even seem to know what he's
talkin' to 'em about.</p>

<p>"One mornin' Reel Foot leaves camp to visit his traps. He's on his
pony, but about a mile down the creek, the brush bein' thick, he quits
the cayuse an' goes afoot. After visitin' his traps Reel Foot circles
'round an' doubles back on his old trail a couple of hundred yards
below where his hoss is tied. When he reaches his cayuse he climbs on
an' rides into camp.</p>

<p>"Now, there's a bunch of Ogallaly Sioux in this country, led by
Blood Lance. They're runnin' buffalo, an' one day they find where some
whites has made a killin' an' tuk nothin' but the tongues. This waste
of meat makes their hearts bad, an' it wouldn't be healthy for no
whites they run across. Their feelin's are stirred up this way when
they strike Reel Foot's tracks, which causes them to pull up their
ponies, an' every Injun skins his gun. There's snow on the ground, so
the readin's plain. He's wearin' moccasins, but that don't fool 'em
none; they see where he's shuk out his pipe while he's walkin'. This
tells 'em he's a white man, 'cause Injuns don't smoke while they're
travelin'. Whenever a redskin lights his pipe, you can bet he's down on
his hunkers, takin' comfort.</p>

<p>"My brothers,' says one wise old buck who's been sittin' wrapped in
his blanket, sayin' nothin', 'are the Ogallalys like the bat that
cannot see in the light of the sun? Shall we sit an' talk like women
while these men with hair on their faces, who leave our meat to rot on
the prairie, walk from under our knives an' laugh at us? I am old an'
do not boast of the eye of the hawk, but it's as plain as the travois
tracks in the snow; there are two men.'</p>

<p>"After studyin' the tracks awhile they decide the old man's right.
There are two one-legged men travelin' in opposite directions. From the
length of the strides showed by the tracks, they figger these men are
long in the leg, an' must be very tall. They talk it over an' decide to
split the party an' take both trails."</p>

<p><b>"THEY DECIDE THERE'S TWO ONE-LEGGED MEN TRAVELIN' IN OPPOSITE
DIRECTIONS"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Of course, they go lookin' for the track of a crutch or wooden leg,
but finally the only way they can figger it out is that these two men's
travelin' by hoppin', an' the tricks these cripples does has them
savages guessin'. There's one place where Reel Foot's jumped off a
cutbank; it's anyway ten feet straight down. Now for the cripple that
jumps down, it is easy, but what's worryin' these Injuns is how the
other one-legged man stands flat-footed an' bounds up the bank,
lightin' easy, with no sign of scramblin'.</p>

<p>"When the party that takes the trail towards camp gets to where Reel
Foot doubles back, they're plenty puzzled. Injun-like, these fellers
are superstitious, an' when the tracks run together, they're gettin'
scary.</p>

<p>"It looks like the tracks of two two-legged men walkin' in opposite
directions,' says a young buck named Weasel. 'Or else the one-legged
men have found their lost legs.'</p>

<p>"But the old wise man says: 'Again the young buck has the eyes of
the bat. There are four tracks; two of the right foot an' two of the
left. These are the tracks of four one-legged men.'</p>

<p>"Some thinks it's the work of ghosts an' are willin' to turn back,
but their curiosity downs their fear, an' they foller the trail mighty
shaky till they run onto where Reel Foot mounts his hoss. Here they
figger that two of these one-legged men got off the hoss, while the
other two, comin' the opposite way, get on an' ride into the
willers.</p>

<p>"By this time these savages are so rattled that the snappin' of a
twig would turn the whole band back. They're beginnin' to think they've
struck the land of one-legged men, an' they're follerin' the trail
mighty cautious when they sight the smoke of Reel Foot's camp.</p>

<p>"Now when the Reel Foot gets in from his traps, he's mighty
leg-weary after draggin' them warped feet of his'n through the snow. So
the minute he gets some grub under his belt, he freshens the fire an'
beds down with his feet stickin' out towards the warmth. He's layin'
this way asleep, when these killers come up on him. The minute they
sight his feet, every buck's hand goes to his mouth, an' when an Injun
does this, he's plenty astonished. All the tricks in the tracks are
plain to 'em now. Some of 'em are hostile an' are for killin' him, but
the old men of the party say it is not good to kill a man whose tracks
have fooled the hawk-eyed Ogallalys. Deformities amongst these people
are few an' far between. In buildin' all wild animals Nature makes few
mistakes, Injuns 're only part human, an' when you see a cripple among
'em, it's safe bettin' that somebody's worked him over.</p>

<p>"They don't even wake Reel Foot, but coverin' their guns an'
crawlin' their ponies, sneak away. When he raises from his nap he finds
pony an' moccasin tracks, but never knows how close he comes to
crossin' the range till about two years later, me an' him's in a
Ogallaly camp doin' some tradin'. We're in Blood Lance's lodge, smokin'
an' dickerin' on this swap, when Blood Lance, who's been starin' at
Reel Foot between puffs, lays down the pipe an' signs he knows him.
'Those feet,' says he, pointin' to Reel Foot's twisted legs, 'fooled
the Ogallalys an' saved the white man's hair,' an' with that he spins
us the yarn of Reel Foot's crooked tracks. Always after, he's knowed
amongst the Ogallalys as 'The Man-Who-Walks-Both-Ways.'"</p>

<h3><a name="ch1-6"></a>BULLARD'S WOLVES</h3>

<p>Lots of cowpunchers like to play with a rope, but ropes, like guns,
are dangerous. All the difference is, guns go off and ropes go on. So
you'll savvy my meanin', I'll tell you a story.</p>

<p>One time Bill Bullard's jogging along towards camp when he bumps
into a couple of wolves that's been agin a bait. They've got enough
strychnine so they're stiff and staggerin'. Bill drops his loop on one
easy. Then he thinks, "What's the matter with taking both?" So he puts
a couple of half hitches in the middle of his string, drops 'em over
the horn, builds a loop at the other end of his rope, and dabs it on
the second wolf. He's snaking 'em along all right till one of these
calf-killers bumps on a sagebrush and bounces too near his hoss.</p>

<p>Right then's when the ball opens. The old hoss will stand anything
but he don't like the smell of these meat eaters, so when this one
starts crowdin' him, snappin' his teeth, he goes hog-wild; and wherever
he's goin' Bill don't know, but the gait he takes it's a cinch they
won't be late. Tain't so bad till they hit the sagebrush country. Then,
first one and then another bounces by Bill's head and lands ahead of
him. This old cayuse starts trying to out-dodge this couple. Mr.
Bullard manages to keep his cayuse headed for the camp, but he's mighty
busy staying in the middle of this living lightning he's riding.</p>

<p><b>"THE OLD CAYUSE STARTS TRYING TO OUT-DODGE THESE WOLVES"</b></p>
</center>

<p>When the boys in camp see him coming down the bottom, they all
wonder what's his hurry, but they heap savvy when they see what's
following him. He don't slow up none when he reaches camp, so the boys
hand him some remarks like: "What's your hurry, Bill, won't you stay to
eat?" "Don't hurry, Bill, you got lots of time." "If you're going to
Medicine Hat, a little more to the left!"</p>

<p>Bullard's red-eyed by this time, and of course these remarks cheer
him up a whole lot. A little more and Bill would bite himself. If he
had a gun, there'd be a massacre. Finally the hoss wrangler, who's
afraid Bill will mix with the saddle band, rides out and herds the
whole muss into the rope corral.</p>

<p>When Bullard dismounts he don't say nothing an' it don't look safe
to ask questions.</p>

<p>Bill's mighty quiet for days. About a week later somebody says
something about killin' two birds with one stone. "Yes," says Bill,
"maybe you'll kill two birds with one stone but don't ever bet you can
get two anythings with one rope."</p>

<h3><a name="ch1-7"></a>INJUNS</h3>

<p>"Some of these wise book-learned men claim that our red brothers
come from China but they can't prove it," says Murphy. "These folks
ain't got no history, barring a few paintin's or carvin's on rocks.
They don't write these folks ain't got no books, an' books are
back-tracks of man. An Injun can't tell you further back than his
grand-dad told him, an' you can't back-track far on grass and most
Injun trails are grass-grown.</p>

<p>"If I told only what I know about Injuns, I'd be through right now.
I run on to a beaver house last fall. It looked the same as the first
one I ever saw that's over forty-five years ago. The Injun is no
different the buffalo skin lodge of long ago is the same thing as the
canvas lodge of to-day. What changes the red man has made, he took from
his white brothers.</p>

<p>"The big change came when old Cortez brought that three-cross brand
of hosses over. Mr. Injun wasn't long afoot. Before this he had only
wolves broke to pack or drag a travois. The country was lousy with meat
but in open spaces it ain't easy to get when you're afoot. The Injuns,
like their brother, the wolf, followed the herds. The wolf had the edge
with his four legs, and when the wolf made his kill it's a safe bet
that if there was enough Injuns so they wouldn't be bashful, they took
it away from Mr. Wolf and sometimes they took what the wolf left. When
man gets his feed this way, he don't get his meals often or regular
enough to hurt his digestion, an' where meat lays too long in hot
weather, it doesn't need cooking but when you go a few days without
eatin', you won't mind this."</p>

<p><b>"WITH A GOOD HOSS UNDER HIM, IT WAS EASY FOR AN INJUN TO GET
MEAT"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Sometimes they'd run buffalo off cliffs. These were big killin's.
This was pulled by the medicine man who owned a buffalo stone. I've
seen one of these stones. Injuns claim this stone could call buffalo.
It's a queer-looking rock about the size of your fist. If a band of
buffalo comes near one of these cliffs, Mr. Medicine Man goes out with
his stone. He ain't wearing much but his robe. Under that he's
stripped, knowing, if he's lucky, he's got to make a race out of it and
outrun the buffalo. He gets as near as he can to the herd, wraps his
robe around him and gets down on his hands and knees an' starts going
through all kinds of manoeuvres, makin' noises and at the same time
working towards the cliff.</p>

<p>"While this is going on, the rest of his folks is sneaking up behind
the buffalo that's so busy watchin' this thing that's wearing one of
their hides. Naturally, the buffalo want to know what this thing is
that dresses like them, but ain't got no shape that they ever saw. This
medicine man knows enough; he's got their wind, they can't smell him.
They follow him slow first, but soon they're running. When they're
close enough to the cliff, he drops his robe, and makes a getaway. When
they try to turn, all these Injuns behind them rares up, waving their
robes and yelling. In a minute they're all millin' and crowdin' till
most of them, maybe all, go over, an' them that ain't killed are
crippled so bad they're easy finished with lances or arrows.</p>

<p>"I seen one of these places near the Teton River, where there's
three feet of buffalo bones, about a hundred yards long under this
cliff. Them days, the squaws stripped the meat with their knives,
leaving the bones. At this place the whites gather arrow heads to this
day. Them they find are stone, telling that it happened a long time
ago. There are layers of buffalo hair and wool that looks like
felt.</p>

<p>"Such places were called by the Blackfeet, piscum. These places
weren't used much, I don't think, after they got the hoss they didn't
need them. With a good hoss under him, a bow and arrows with steel or
iron points that the white traders brought, it was easy for an Injun to
get meat."</p>

<p><b>"BEFORE THIS HE ONLY HAD WOLVES BROKE TO PACK OR DRAG A
TRAVOIS"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"While the buffalo lasted, the Injuns counted their wealth in
hosses. The Injun always was a trouble hunter, and getting hosses don't
make him any easier to get along with. Whites that don't know him think
he never smiles. They got this idea walking into lodges without no
invite, pickin' up anything they see. Maybe the owner of this lodge is
talking to a friend. The white man thinks it's all right to stand
between these two redskins. If the Injun is smoking, the civilized man
takes the pipe and examines it. If there's a party of these wedge-ins,
they're picking things up and talking and making all kinds of remarks
one'll tell the rest what dirty people Injuns are. Maybe there's an
Injun in the lodge that savvys white man talk; if he does, he ain't
slow tellin' what the white man says. Naturally, the red man that's
been starving for years on white man's promises ain't got lots of love
for him, so when he busts in on his home and fireside, the Injun don't
show much joy. If other people would walk into my house without bein'
asked, I don't think I'd smile an' look pleasant. What would I do if I
wasn't able to throw them out? I'd call the police. An Injun laughs
only when it's on the square.</p>

<p>"Some white men, especially these wedgers-in, are as welcome in an
Injun camp as a rattlesnake in a dog town. If an Injun likes you, he'll
go to the end of the trail for you; if he don't, he'll go further the
other way. If he's a friend, anything he's got is yours. If he don't
like you, anything you got is his if he can get away with it. Whites
will do the same, I notice, in war times. We stole every inch of land
we got from the Injun but we didn't get it without a fight, and Uncle
Sam will remember him a long time.</p>

<p>"The whites have always held the edge. The first were Spaniards with
steel bow-guns and with clothes made by a blacksmith. Mister Injun met
him with wooden bows an' stone-pointed arrows, and paint wasn't much
protection against a bow-gun that would drive an iron bolt through a
steel plate. The only chance an Injun had to get a Spaniard was when
he's in bathing, an' beaches were only used them days to land boats on,
and folks didn't bathe often it wasn't considered healthy, and I
imagine the white man's camp was a little stronger than a wolf den if
the wind's right. It's no trick for Mr. Injun to locate the camp, but
what's the good? His stone arrow heads only bust on this iron shell the
white man wears. When the white man gets the gun, an Injun gets one too
but he ain't got no powder he's always a few jumps behind, but by doing
some careful sneakin' he gets enough scalps to trim his leggin's. Then
there are so many whites that's baldheaded that it's hardly worth the
Injun's while takin' chances, for when he's got so he can load a
flintlock gun in twenty minutes, the paleface shows up with a
britch-loader. When he gets a britch-loader, the white man's got a
repeater.</p>

<p>"If you're out looking for a man with a repeater and you are packin'
a missile stuffer and you got powder that's wet, naturally you're
careful. The man with a repeater and belt full of cartridges calls the
feller with a single shot a coward. Of course, this makes a
bush-whacker out of an Injun.</p>

<p>"I believe if the white man had the same weapons as his red
brothers, Uncle Sam wouldn't own only part of this country yet and we
wouldn't need any game law. I think the white man is the smartest man
in the world but he's no braver than others. He's the smartest, he's
proved that. He's the only man in the world that plays golf to keep
himself in shape-other colors keep the extry leaf-lard off with a pick
and shovel. The old-time Injun didn't pack much fat. He didn't work,
but he was busy finding meat and dodgin' enemies. Civilization don't
agree with him he ain't got room. A few more generations an' there
won't be a full-blood American left."</p>

<p><b>"THE BIG CHANGE CAME WHEN OLD CORTEZ BROUGHT HOSSES OVER"</b></p>
</center>

<h3><a name="ch1-8"></a>WHISKEY</h3>

<p>Whiskey has been blamed for lots it didn't do. It's a brave-maker.
All men know it. If you want to know a man, get him drunk and he'll tip
his hand. If I like a man when I'm sober, I kin hardly keep from
kissing him when I'm drunk. This goes both ways. If I don't like a man
when I'm sober, I don't want him in the same town when I'm drunk.</p>

<p>Remember, I ain't saying that booze is good for men, but it boils
what's in him to the top. A man that beats his wife when he's drunk
ain't a good man when he's sober. I've knowed drunks that would come
home to mama loaded down with flowers, candy, and everything that they
thought their wife would like. Other men that wouldn't take a drink
never brought home nothing but laundry soap. The man that comes home
drunk and licks his wife wouldn't fight a chickadee when he's sober.
The drunk that brings home presents knows he's wrong and is sorry. He
wants to square himself. The man that licks his wife ain't sorry for
nobody but himself, and the only way to make him real sorry is to beat
him near to death.</p>

<p>There's a difference in whiskey some's worse than others. Me and a
friend drops into a booze parlor on the Canadian line. The man that
runs this place is a friend of ours. I ain't mentioning no names but
his front name's Dick. He's an old-time cowpuncher. He's bought a lot
of booze in his day but right now he's selling it.</p>

<p>When me and my friend name our drink we notice there's about ten men
in this joint. Their actions tells us they've been using some of Dick's
goods, but there ain't no loud talk. They are all paired off, talking
low like they're at a funeral. I get curious and ask Dick if these
gents are pallbearers that's spreading sorrow on his joint.</p>

<p>"No," says Dick, looking wise. "This ain't no cow-town no more. It's
one of the coming farmer-cities of this country, and the sellers of all
this rich land don't want nothing that'll scare away farmers, and I'm
here to please the folks. Most of these tillers of the soil come from
prohibition states where men do their drinkin' alone in the cellar.
When you drink that way, it don't cost so much. The old-timer that you
knew was generally on the square. When he got drunk he wanted everybody
to know it and they did, if they were in the same town. Folks to-day
ain't been able to sweep all this old stuff out but, like some old
bachelors I know, they've swept the dirt under the bed, and what you
don't see don't look bad.</p>

<p>"The gent that sold me this brand of booze told me there ain't a
cross word in a barrel of it, and he told the truth. All these gents
you see in here are pleasant without the noise. This bunch, if they
stay to the finish, will whisper themselves to sleep. This booze would
be safe for a burglar. I call it," says Dick, "whisperin' booze."</p>

<p>But as I said before, there's different kinds. I knowed a old Injun
trader on the Missouri River that sold another kind. Back in the '80s
the cowmen of Judith country was throwing their cattle north of the
river. This old trader had a place on the river right where we crossed
the cattle. All summer we were swimming herds.</p>

<p>I never knowed what made an Injun so crazy when he drunk till I
tried this booze. I always was water shy and this old stream has got
many a man, but with a few drinks of this trade whiskey the Missouri
looked like a creek and we spur off in it with no fear. It was sure a
brave-maker, and if a man had enough of this booze you couldn't drown
him. You could even shoot a man through the brain or heart and he
wouldn't die till he sobered up.</p>

<p>When Injuns got their hides full of this they were bad and
dangerous. I used to think this was because an Injun was a wild man,
but at this place where we crossed the herds there's about ten lodges
of Assiniboines, and we all get drunk together. The squaws, when we
started, got mighty busy caching guns and knives. In an hour we're all,
Injuns and whites, so disagreeable that a shepherd dog couldn't have
got along with us. Some wise cowpuncher had persuaded all the
cowpunchers to leave their guns in camp. This wise man could see ahead
an' knowed things was going to be messy. Without guns either
cowpunchers or Injuns are harmless they can't do nothing but pull hair.
Of course the Injun, wearing his locks long, gets the worst of it. We
were so disagreeable that the Injuns had to move camp.</p>

<p>It used to be agin the law to sell an Injun whiskey, but the law has
made Injuns out of all of us now. Most new booze is worse than trade
whiskey. Whiskey made all men brave. If nobody got drunk the East Coast
would be awful crowded by this time. Maybe the leaders of the exploring
party didn't drink, but the men that went with them did. It's a safe
bet there wasn't a man in Columbus' crew that knowed what a maple-nut
sundae was.</p>

<p>In the old times, when the world had lots of wild countries and some
brave explorer wanted men to go up agin danger and maybe starvation, he
don't go to the fireside of home lovers; he finds the toughest street
in a town where there's music, booze, and lots of fighters he ain't
lookin' for pets. When he steps in this joint, he walks to the bar and
asks them all up. He don't bar nobody, not even the bartender. He
starts with making a good feller of himself. This sport don't ask
nobody who he is, but while he's buyin' drinks he's telling about
others that has gone to these countries and come back with gold in
every pocket, an' it ain't long till all have signed up and joined. If
there's any danger of them weakening, he keeps them drunk. There's been
many a man that got drunk in St. Louis, and when he comes to out of
this debauch he's hundreds of miles up the Missouri, on a line dragging
a boat loaded with trade goods for the Injun country. If he turns back
he's liable to bump into war parties, so he stays. This game is played
on sailor, woods and river men. Cowpunchers were of the same kind of
goods all careless, homeless, hard-drinking men.</p>

<p><b>"COWPUNCHERS WERE CARELESS, HOMELESS, HARD-DRINKING MEN"</b></p>
</center>

<p>Fur traders were the first and real adventurers. They went to
countries unknown every track they made was dangerous. On every side
were unseen savages. Such people as Colter, Bridger, and men of their
stamp, these fellers were not out for gold or great wealth they asked
for little but life and adventure. They had no dreams of palaces. Few
of them ever returned. The gold-hunter who came later loved the
mountains for the gold he found in them, and some when they got it
returned to the city, where they spent it and died in comfort. But most
trappers kissed good-bye to civilization and their birthplace took an
Injun woman, and finished, nobody knowed how or where.</p>

<p>The cowboy was the last of this kind, and he's mighty near extinct.
He came from everywhere farms, big cities, and some of them from
colleges. Most of them drank when they could get it.</p>

<p>As I said before, they're all Injuns now since the Volstead law.
Just the other day I'm talking to a friend. Says he, "It's funny how
crazy an Injun is for whiskey. A few days ago I'm riding along I got a
quart of booze in my saddle pocket. I meet an Injun. He sees what I
got, and offers me the hoss he's riding for the quart. To a man that
wants a saddle hoss, this one is worth a hundred dollars. I paid six
for this moonshine."</p>

<p>"Did you make the trade?" says I.</p>

<p>"Hell, no!" says he. "It's all the booze I got!"</p>

<h3><a name="ch1-9"></a>WHEN PETE SETS A SPEED MARK</h3>

<p>"Sizin' Pete Van up from looks," says Rawhide Rawlins, "you'd never
pick him for speed, an' I, myself, never see Pete make a quick move
without a hoss under him. If Pete's entered in a footrace most folks
would play him with a copper, but Bill Skelton claims Pete's the
swiftest animal he ever see, barrin' nothin'. At that Bill says he
never saw Pete show speed but once, an' that's back in about '78.</p>

<p>"They're in the Musselshell country, an' one mornin' they're out
after meat. They ain't traveled far till they sight dust. In them days
this means Injuns or buffalo. This makes 'em cautious, 'cause they
ain't anxious to bump into no red brothers with a bunch of stolen
hosses. When Injuns are traveling with this kind of goods it ain't safe
to detain 'em, an' Pete an' Bill both are too genteel to horn in where
they ain't welcome, 'specially if it's a big party. Of course, if it's
a small bunch they'd be pleased to relieve them by the help of their
rifles.</p>

<p>"They start cayotin' around the hills till they sight long strings
of brown grass-eaters buffalo. This herd ain't disturbed none just
travelin'. This means meat an' plenty of it, so gettin' the wind right,
they approach.</p>

<p>"The country's rough, an' by holdin' the coulees they're within a
hundred yards before they're noticed. It's an old bull that tips their
hand; this old boy kinks his tail and jumps stiff-legged. This starts
the whole bunch runnin', but it ain't a minute till Pete and Bill's
among 'em.</p>

<p>"Pete singles out a cow an' Bill does the same. Pete's so busy
emptyin' his Henry into this cow that he forgets all about his saddle.
He's ridin' an old-fashioned center-fire. His hoss is young an'
shad-bellied, an' with a loose cinch the saddle's workin' back. The
first thing Pete knows he's ridin' the cayuse's rump. This hoss ain't
broke to ride double an' objects to anybody sittin' on the hind seat,
so he sinks his head an' unloads Pete right in front of a cow.</p>

<p>"Bill, who's downed his meat, looks up just in time to see Pete
land, and he 'lights runnin'. Bill says the cow only once scratches the
grease on Pete's pants. From then on it's Pete's race. It looks like
the cow was standin' still."</p>

down, tryin' to turn him back.'"</p>

<h3><a name="ch1-10"></a>BILL'S SHELBY HOTEL</h3>

<p>"They tell me," says Rawhide Rawlins, "that Bill's goin' to build a
fine hotel for tourists up on Flathead Lake, not far from where his
ranch is. I stayed with him a time or two when he's runnin' that big
hotel in Great Falls, an' he sure savvies makin' folks comfortable.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't ever figger that Bill would be runnin' one of these
fine modern hotels if you'd knowed him when I first run onto him
twenty-five years ago. It's hard to recognize Bill in them good
clothes, with a white collar an' a diamond as big as a Mexican bean in
his tie, if you wasn't told it was the same man.</p>

<p>"Bill was born near Des Moines, Iowa, and as a boy was knowed as the
champion lightweight corn shucker of Hog Bristle County. But when he
gets to manhood he takes a dislike to work, an' after hoardin' his
wages of three dollars a month for eight years, he just naturally steps
underneath a freight train one mornin' with his bankroll an' takes a
seat on the rods. He gives one lingerin' look at the old homestead and
tells the brakeman he can turn her loose.</p>

<p>"Bill finds a pleasant travelin' companion in a noted tourist,
Brakebeam Ben, who kindly divides his conversation an' whatever little
things he has on him. Some of these last makes lively company for Bill,
who finds travelin' pleasant an' makes lots of stops at points of
interest along the line. He gets acquainted with several men who wear
stars an' brass buttons. They all take a kindly interest in Bill, an'
after insistin' on his spendin' a few days with them, show him the
railroad tracks out of town and wish him a pleasant journey.</p>

<p>"A year or so later Bill arrives in McCartyville, a town that in
them days was about as quiet an' peaceful as Russia is to-day.
McCartyville consists of a graveyard an' one or two ghost cabins now,
but then it's a construction camp for the Great Northern, an' there
ain't a tougher one on earth, even in them times. The most prosperous
business men in McCartyville was the undertakers. They kept two shifts
at work all the time, an' every mornin' they'd call at the hotel an'
saloons to carry out the victims of the night before. No one asked no
questions.</p>

<p>"When Bill steps off the train there he has an Iowa thirst, an' he's
just as welcome as his remainin' two dollars an' a half, which is good
for just ten drinks. To this prohibition-raised boy this is a real
novelty, for where he comes from, no one drinks without hidin' in the
cellar. Bill tells me that the lives of a lot of his friends there is
just one long game of hide-and-seek. In them days an Iowan could drink
more in one swaller than the average westerner can in three hours, so
Bill's called on frequent by the barkeep to slow up, as they can only
make just so much liquor every twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>"It's here Bill gets his trainin' in hotel-runnin', from washin'
dishes to dealin' biscuits through the smoke that hangs heavy around
the dinin' room. At the end of three days he's told by the marshal to
climb the hill an' back-track as far as he likes. Bill said that they
didn't like no peaceful disposed citizens there, but I never heard no
one else accuse him of this weakness he claims.</p>

<p>"A few days later he lands in Shelby, where the citizens are
surprised and delighted to see him separate himself from the rods. He's
covered with dust an' resembles part of the runnin' gear. In this way
he was able to hide out from the brakies. When he asks for a room with
a bath it's too much for the clerk, who has a nervous temperament an'
has spent the previous evenin' drinkin' Shelby lemonade, an' he shoots
Bill's hat off. This drink I mention was popular among the Shelbyites
of that day. It's a mixture of alkali water, alcohol, tobacco juice an'
a dash of strychnine the last to keep the heart goin'.</p>

<p>"This outburst of the clerk don't scare Bill none, as he's been
permanently cured of gunshyness at McCartyville. As the clerk lowers
his gun, Bill warps a couplin' pin just under where the gent's hat
rests. The hat's ruined, but the clerk comes to three days later to
find Bill's got his job. This is where Bill breaks into the hotel
business. A week later in a game of stud poker he wins the hotel. I
never believe the story whispered around by some of the citizens that
it's a cold deck that did it.</p>

<p>"Bill's chef's one of the most rapid cooks known in the West. He
hangs up a bet of a hundred dollars that with the use of a can-opener,
he can feed more cowpunchers an' sheepherders than any other cook west
of the Mississippi. There's never no complaint about the meat, either,
for this cook's as good with a gun as he is with a can-opener. In fact,
no one ever claims he ain't a good cook after takin' one look at
him.</p>

<p>"Shelby's changed a lot since them days. In the old times the
residents there include a lot of humorists who have a habit of stoppin'
trains an' entertainin' the passengers. Most of these last is from the
East, an' they seemed to be serious-minded, with little fun in their
make-up. The Shelby folks get so jokey with one theatrical troupe that
stops there that many of these actors will turn pale to-day at the
mention of the place. At last Jim Hill gets on the fight an' threatens
to build around by way of Gold Butte an' cut out Shelby, preferrin' to
climb the Sweetgrass Hills to runnin' his trains through this jolly
bunch.</p>

<p>"This hotel of Bill's was one of the few places I've seen that's got
flies both winter an' summer. During the cold months they come from all
over the Northwest to winter with Bill, an' hive in the kitchen an'
dinin' room. Bill claims they're intelligent insects, as they'll spend
several hours a day in warm weather frolickin' around the hog pens, but
when he rings the triangle for meals they start in a cloud for the
dinin' room. For a home-like, congenial place for a fly to live, you
couldn't beat Bill's hotel.</p>

<p>"Bill's run several hotels since this, an' as he's kept on goin' up
in the business, this new one he's goin' to tackle on the lake will
probably top 'em all, but it's doubtful if he'll be able to furnish as
much excitement for his guests as the old place at Shelby used to
provide for the boarders."</p>

<p><b>BILL WARD'S SHELBY HOTEL</b></p>
</center>

<h3><a name="ch1-11"></a>DAD LANE'S BUFFALO YARN</h3>

<p>Talk had drifted into the days of the buffalo. "I run onto a head
yesterday that the bone hunters must have overlooked," said Long
Wilson. "It's kinda hid away under the rimrock on Lone Injun. 'Twas an
old bull, with the horns gnawed down to the nubs by trade-rats an'
there's a little wool on the forehead, bleached an' faded till it's
almost white. 'Tain't long ago the country was covered with these
relics, but since the bone hunters cleaned up you seldom see one. Down
on the Missouri I've seen bunches of skeletons, runnin' from ten to
sixty. You generally find 'em under a knoll or raise in the country,
an' by scoutin' around a little you might find in a waller or behind a
greasewood a pile of long, bottleneck shells. These are Sharp's
ca'tridges, an' in number they'd count a few over the skulls. These
skin hunters didn't waste much lead; they had killin' down to a
fineness, goin' at it in a business way. They hunted afoot, an' most of
'em used glasses. When Mister Skin Hunter leaves camp he's loaded down
with ammunition, an' packin' a gun that looks an' weighs like a
crowbar. He prowls along the high country till he sights the herd; then
gettin' the wind right he keeps the coulees till he sights the range,
an' it don't have to be close, 'cause these old Sharp's pack lead a
thousand yards. First he picks out a cow on the edge of the bunch, an'
pullin' down on her he breaks her back. Of course she starts draggin'
her hindquarters an' makin' all kinds of buffalo noise. Quicker than
you'd bat your eye, her neighbors 're 'round her wantin' to know what's
the matter.</p>

<p>"Buffalo 're like any other cow-brute; kill one, an'they don't
notice it much or 're liable to quit the country; cripple one an' start
the blood, an' it's pretty near a cinch they'll hang 'round. The hide
hunters know this trick an' most of 'em use it. When the herd gets to
millin', he goes to work pourin' lead into 'em as fast as he can work
the lever on his breech-block. Whenever one tries to break out of the
mill, there's a ball goes bustin' through its lungs, causin' it to
belch blood, an' strangle, an' it ain't long till they quit tryin' to
get away an' stand an' take their medicine. Then this cold-blooded
proposition in the waller settles down to business, droppin' one at a
time an' easin' up now an' agin to cool his gun, but never for long
till he sees through the smoke the ground covered with still, brown
spots. Then layin' down his hot weapon he straightens up an' signals
the skinners that's comin' up behind. They've located him by the talk
of his Sharp's.</p>

<p>"This is what hunters called 'gettin' a stand'; there's nothin'
taken off the animal but the hide an' sometimes the tongue. The rest
goes to the wolves. These hide hunters 're the gentlemen that cleaned
up the buffalo, an' since the bone gatherers come there ain't nothin'
left to show that there ever was any. I've seen a few buffalo myself,
but the big herds was gettin' pretty seldom when I hit the country. I
guess you've all heard them yarns about how they used to stop the boats
on the Missouri, an' how wagon-trains would have to corral for days,
lettin' a herd pass. The strongest yarn I ever heard of this kind was
told by an old feller up on High River Springs. He's a Hudson Bay man,
an's tellin' about comin' south from Edmonton with a Red River
cart-train. They're just north of the Big Bow when they run into a
herd; as near as he can figure there's a couple of million. It's spring
an' the calves 're so plentiful they have to stop every little ways an'
pry 'em from between the spokes; they keep blockin' the wheels."</p>

<p><b>"I'VE SEEN BUFFALO MYSELF"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Buffalo?" says old Dad Lane. "I was here when they're thick as hair
on a dog, but it's surprisin' how quick one of these big herds could
quit a country. You'd travel for days in sight of 'em, an' wake up some
mornin' an' it'd look like they'd disappeared from the face of the
earth; you'd ride for ten days without seein' hide or hair of 'em.
Whether they walked or run I never knowed, but from looks you'd swear
they'd flew. This sudden disappearin' of buffalo comes pretty near
causin' me to cash in once.</p>

<p>"It's back in '62. There's me, Jack Welch, Murphy, an' a feller
called Whisky Brown, builds a tradin' post up near Writin' Stone. We're
short of goods an' somebody's got to go to Benton; so me an' Joe Burke,
an interpreter, knowin' the country, volunteers to make the trip. This
Burke's a full-blooded Piegan, but bein' raised by a white man he's tuk
his name. He's knowed amongst his people as 'Bad Meat.' Our outfit's
made up of eight pack-ponies an' two Red River carts. We're drivin'
these vehicles jerkneck, that is the trail pony's tied to the lead cart
so one man can handle both. I'm teamster; the Injun's got the
pack-train. The first couple of days it's smooth sailin'. It's August,
the weather's fine, an' we're never out o' sight o' buffalo, so meat's
always handy."</p>

<p><a name="trails-18"></a><img alt="" src=
"0700941h-images/0700941h-18.jpg"></p>

<p><b>A FULL-BLOODED PIEGAN</b></p>
</center>

<p>"The second mornin' when we're quittin' the blankets I notice the
sun down on the skyline, lookin' like a red-hot stove lid, an' my
nostrils fill with the smell of burnt grass, tellin' me the range is
afire somewhere south of us. 'Tain't an hour till the sky's smoked up
so the sun's hid, an' we've lost our timepiece an' compass. But it
don't worry me none; I can see the Injun joggin' along ahead; all the
smoke in hell couldn't lose him. There's one place where an Injun holds
the edge on a white man day or night you can't lose him.</p>

<p>"I remember askin' Bad Meat how it was that an Injun never loses his
way. He tells me when a white man travels he looks one way, always
straight ahead. Passin' a butte, he only sees one side of it, never
lookin' back; so of course he don't savvy that butte on his return. The
Injun looks all ways an' sees all sides of everythin'. There's
somethin' in this, but that ain't all there is to it. Of course an
Injun ain't got eyes for nothin', but it ain't all seein', 'cause I've
been with savages nights so black that bats stayed to home; but it
don't bother Mister Injun. He travels without hesitatin', like it's
broad day. I don't know how he does it an' I doubt if the Injun can
tell himself. These people 're only part human an' this is where the
animal crops out.</p>

<p>"Well, we keep workin' along south through the smoke. Once in a
while I can see a string o' buffalo, dim through the smoke like
shadows. Sometimes they get right up on us before sightin' our outfit.
Then swervin' from their course they go lopin' off an' 're soon lost
from sight. Towards evenin' Bad Meat downs a young cow an' while we're
takin' the back-meat he advises takin' the hams; but I say 'What's the
use? It's only that much extra packin', an' we'll get meat
to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"'All the buffalo we see to-day is travelin',' says he. 'Maybe-so no
meat to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"Since he spoke of it I notice that they are all travelin', an' not
so slow either, but I've seen buffalo lope an' trot goin' to or leavin'
water, an' didn't think nothin' of it. But takin' Bad Meat's hunch, we
take the hams.</p>

<p>"Bout noon the next day we strike the burnt country. As far as you
can see she's black, with now an' then a smoulderin' buffalo chip that
still holds the fire. It's a sorry sight; a few hours ago this country
wore grass that'd whip a hoss on the knees, an' buffalo fed by
thousands. Now she's lifeless, smoked an' charred till she looks like
hell with the folks moved out. It's the same all day black, without a
livin' critter in sight. The outlook's bad for the cayuses, but towards
evenin' we strike a creek that Bad Meat calls 'Wild Dog,' an' a little
patch of grass the fire's gone 'round. The Injun's not for stoppin'
except to eat a bite an' water the hosses; then push on into the night
away from the fire. Injun-like, he's been houndin' the ground all day
an' finds some tracks. He tells me he's seen the moccasin marks, as
near as he can guess, of about eight men, an' there ain't no pony sign
among 'em; they're all afoot. An' when the sun shows red like a bloody
warshield, he says, it's 'bad medicine.'</p>

<p>"This savage superstition about the sun sounds foolish to me, an' I
tell him it's the smoke causes it. 'Yes,' says he, 'but who built the
fire? We're still in the country of the Piegans; do they burn their own
grass?'</p>

<p>"Of course these tracks look bad, 'cause when you see Injuns walkin'
in a country it's a cinch they ain't friendly. Walkin' makes all people
dangerous. War parties generally travel this way an' by the time they,
or anybody else, have walked a hundred miles or so they ain't to be
trusted amongst hosses. Me an' Bad Meat talks it over an' decides by
puttin' out the fire it'll be safe enough.</p>

<p>"Our hosses 're all good to stay, an' barrin' two we hobble an' our
herd-hoss on a picket rope, they're all loose. It's been a tiresome
day, an' I no more'n hit the blankets till I'm asleep.'</p>

<p>"Along in the night sometime I'm awakened by a report of guns. It
kind o' dazes me at first; then a ball spats agin a wheel spoke just
above my head, an' I ain't slow changin' my bed-ground. Mister Injun
had an idee where I'm sleepin' an' is feelin' for me with his gun. He's
doin' good guessin' in the darkness an' comes within a foot of findin'
me. I'm awake plenty now an' hear the hosses runnin'. By the way the
noise is leavin' me I know they're pushin' the country behind 'em
mighty rapid. I tell you, boys, it's tough layin' there listenin' to
all you got leavin' you, but there ain't nothin' to do. In that country
we're as good as blind men. It's the darkest night I ever see, an' the
burnt ground don't help it none. I'm so damn mad I blaze away in the
dark once at the noise an' think I hear a hoss bawl like he's hit, but
I guess it's my imagination, for there's nothin' to show for it in the
mornin'. I'm cussin' an' goin' on when I hear Bad Meat kind o'
chucklin'. He calls to me from his blankets. 'I knowed it,' says
he.</p>

<p>"If you knowed,' says I, 'you're a little late breakin' the news.
What's the cause of you holdin' out all this knowledge?' An' I cussed
him up a batch. I'm in the wrong all right, but ain't in no humor to
own up to it 'specially to an Injun.</p>

<p>"As I said before, we're helpless, but there ain't nothin' to do but
wait for day. When it's light I'm surprised at Bad Meat's appearance.
Up till now he's wearin' white man's clothes, but this mornin' he's
back to the clout, skin leggin's, an' shirt. His foretop's wrapped in
otterskin an' from his hair to just below his eyes he's smeared with
ochre. The rest of his face is black, with green stripes. He notices my
surprise an' tells me it ain't good medicine for an Indian to die with
white men's clothes. I ask him what's his reason for thinkin' about
cashin' in. 'That war-party,' says he, 'is mighty successful in gettin'
them hosses, but all Injuns love to get some little token to take back
to their folks, such as hair.' This kind o' worries me; I ain't anxious
to furnish no savages locks to trim leggin's with, an' I think Bad Meat
feels the same way, 'cause he says it'll be a good idea to travel
nights from here on, an' I second the motion.</p>

<p>"Bad Meat calls the turn when he says these Injuns ain't satisfied,
for while we're eatin' breakfast there's a band of 'em looms up on a
ridge. It's the same party that makes the night visit; I recognize the
hosses. While we're lookin' 'em over, one buck slides from his pony,
an' restin' his gun on his cross-sticks takes a crack at us. There's a
little curl o' dust out on the prairie shows me that his old
smooth-bore won't pack lead near that distance, but the way he's
pintin' his weapon tells me it ain't no friendly salute, so me an' Bad
Meat takes out the prairie. We don't no more'n reach the brush till
they're all down off the ridge, yelpin' like a band o' coyotes. Bad
Meat starts singin' his war-ditty. On hearin' his gun bark I look off
on the prairie; there lays one still Injun. There's a loose pony lopin'
off with nothin' on but a war-bridle. It's a good shot for an Injun,
but Bad Meat's over average.</p>

<p>"This good shootin' don't seem to pacify these savages, an' the way
they start pilin' lead in our direction makes us hug the brush; we
don't leave it till dark. Barrin' a bundle o' robes Bad Meat grabs when
we're quittin' the camp it's a Mexican stand-off, which means gettin'
away alive. Of course we got our guns, but we're grubless, an' for
three days we don't swaller nothin' more stimulatin' than water. The
fourth mornin' we're out o' the burnt country. It's gettin' pretty
light an' we're thinkin' about campin' when we see four old bulls about
a mile off. The country's level as a table an' the chances of gettin'
near enough for a shot looks slim. The Injun says he knows a way, an'
unrollin' the robes he comes up with a couple o' wolf-skins. He tells
me his granddad used to play wolf an' fool the buffalo. When we get our
disguises tied on we find a shallow coulee that'll save a lot of
crawlin'. On reachin' the raise we drop to all fours an' start playin'
wolf. The Injun's a little ahead an' when he tops the draw I notice him
pull a wisp o' grass an' toss it up. There's so little wind it's hard
to tell the direction, but the grass falls just back of his shoulder.
Bad Meat signs 'good,' an' we start crawlin'. I'm so hungry I feel like
a wolf all right, but for looks I'm no good; my suit's too small an' I
keep thinkin' that any buffalo that wouldn't tumble to me must be
nearsighted or a damn fool. It's different with Bad Meat. A little way
off in the grass he's actin' wolf mighty natural. Injun-like, he knows
the animal an's got that side-wheelin' gait of the loafer wolf down
fine.</p>

<p>"We ain't gone far when the nearest bull raises his head an' lifts
nose, but the wind's wrong an' he don't find nothin'; so after lookin'
us over, he goes grazin'. I'm within twenty-five yards when I pick out
my bull. They're all old boys that's been whipped out of the main herd,
but goin' on looks I draw down on the youngest. I'm half hid in the
buckbrush an' he's standin' broadside. His heart's what I aim for, but
bein' weak an' trembly from hunger I notice the sight wavin' when I
pull the trigger, an' when I look under the smoke there stands the bull
with his head up, an' tail kinked. There's a red blotch on his side,
but it's too high an' fur back. The bull stands a few seconds lookin'.
He can't see me 'cause I'm layin' flat as a snake; it's the damn smoke
hangin' over me that tips my hand. I'm tryin' hard to re-load when he
comes for me, snortin' an' gruntin'. When I raise to run, the wolf-skin
slips down an' hobbles me, an' the next thing I know I'm amongst his
horns.</p>

<p>"Lucky for me I get between 'em, an' grabbin' a horn in each hand
I'm hangin' for all there's in me, while the bull's doin' his best to
break my holt. But bein' shot through the lungs he's weak an' slowly
bleedin' to death. I'm playin' my strength agin his'n when I hear the
bark of Bad Meat's gun. The bull goes over, an' the fight's mine. Maybe
you think that old Injun don't look good standin' there with his old
muzzle-loader."</p>

pretty strong an' tough, but it's fillin' an' takes us to Benton."</p>

<h3><a name="ch1-12"></a>BAB'S SKEES</h3>

<p>"Old Babcock," says Rawhide, "could tell yarns that's scary. We're
talking about skees when Bab springs this one.</p>

<p>"Me and Gumboot Williams are camped on Swimmin' Women,' says Bab.
'We was set afoot by the Crows. It's back in '76 we'd saved our hair
and we're hidin'. The snow comes early that fall we're away up on the
Swimmin' Women. There's lots of game, but we're huggin' camp close
we're afraid of war parties, but a little later when we know Injuns
have quit prowlin', we get bold. We're right comfortable, but we're
running low on meat.</p>

<p>"It's hard travelin', the snow's so deep. I don't know nothin' about
makin' snowshoes so I decide it's easier to build skees, and hew a pair
out of lodgepole pine. I try 'em out around camp. I can't make much
time, but I keep on top of the snow. It's hard climbing till I wrap
them with a strip of buffalo robe, makin' a kind of rough lock. So, one
morning, I starts climbing the south side of the Snowies. I'm keepin'
to the open country, avoidin' timber. 'Tain't long till I jump five
blacktail but don't get a shot.</p>

<p>"About noon I'm pretty high, and stop to get my wind while I'm
viewing the country. It's so clear I can see the Musselshell, 'way
south. Suddenly I see about two miles below me, a band of about twenty
elk some of them is laying down. I'm packing a forty-four Henry, so
after throwing a shell in the barrel, I slip my rough locks and start,
an' it ain't a minute till I know I've lost control. I'm riding a
cyclone with the bridle off, or somebody's kicked the lid off and I'm
coming like a bat out of hell. I can smell the smoke of my skees.
They're sure warming up when I hit astride of a dead lodgepole. It
looks like this would stop me, but don't ever think it. She busts at
the root, bends over, and when I shoot off the end she's trimmed as
slick as a fish-pole there ain't a limb on her. I must have split about
fifty of these when these elk hear the noise. They're leaving their
beds when I come hurling off the end of a lodgepole and light straddle
of the biggest bull there. I stay with him till he wipes me off with
his horns. I land this time sittin' on my skees. I've still got my
Henry and I'm fightin' mad. While I'm passin' this bunch they look like
they're backing up. I throw down a big cow and break her shoulders. I'm
still traveling south but ain't got time to skin my killin'. After
trimming several hundred more acres of lodgepoles, the country levels
and I slow down and finally quit. From my belt down I'm dressed like a
Savage, but I'm warm both ways from the middle; I'm plumb feverish. I'm
still wearing a belt, and lucky I've got my rough locks. It's easy back
tracking of course, there are long distances there ain't no tracks, but
while I'm in the air I'm cutting swaths in the timber that looks like a
landslide. When I get to the cow, I take the tongue and loins. I don't
reach camp till dark.</p>

<p>"I think,' says Bab, shaking out his pipe, 'that Injun webs is the
best if you ain't in a hurry.'"</p>

<p>This yarn, a friend of mine tells I ain't givin' his name 'cause

got 'em bedded, you can see the lights of town, and once in a while I
can hear singin' and music. It's a fine night. They've been on good
grass all day and they're laying good, so good my pardner says to me,
'Big, if you want to go to town for a while, I'll hold 'em all right.'
Says I, 'I won't be gone long, then you can take your turn.'</p>

<p>"It ain't long after till my hoss is at the rack, and I've joined
the joymakers. They're sure whooping her up, singin', and I get a
little of that conversation fluid in me. I'm singin' so good I wonder
why some concert hail in Butte don't hire me. The bartender is busy as
a beaver the piano player's singin' 'Always Take Mother's Advice; She
Knows What Is Best for Her Boy.' And, of course, we're all doin' that.
I've heard that song where a rattlesnake would be ashamed to meet his
mother. But whiskey is the juice of beautiful sentiment.</p>

<p>"A little while before I become unconscious, I'm shaking hands with
a feller that I knowed for years but never knowed he had a twin
brother. The last I remember, I'm crawling my horse at the rack. Then
the light goes out. When I wake up I'm cold as a dead snake, and I'm
laying on my belly in the middle of the herd. I'm feared to move 'cause
many of this bunch are out of the brakes an' are wild as buffalo and
they're mighty touchy. If I'd get up, this bunch would beat me to it,
and when they've passed over, my friends would scrape me up with a
hoe.</p>

<p>"I can't tell what time it is. It's cloudy and I can't find the
dipper. There's one old spotted boy that I recognize he's a
Seventy-nine steer. A few of them are standing. One I see is wanderin'
around grazin', but they're mighty quiet. I'm gettin' colder every
minute. I'm wantin' to smoke, but I dassn't. I put my head on my arm
and doze a little. 'Tain't long. The next time I take a look it's
breaking day. And where do you think I am?" says Big Man.</p>

<p>"In the middle of the herd," says I.</p>

<p>"In the middle of the herd? In the middle of hell," says he. "I'm
laying in the center of the town dump. The steers that I been looking
at are nothing but stoves, tables, boxes; all the discard of Sandy is
there. The few that's standin' are tables. That spotted Seventy-nine
steer that I know so well is a big goods box. Them spots is white
paper. The one I see movin' around is my hoss. He's the only live thing
in sight. I got a taste in my mouth like I had supper with a coyote. I
ain't quite dead, but I wish I was. From where I am I can see Big
Sandy, and from the looks it's as near dead as I am."</p>

<h3><a name="ch2-2"></a>CURLEY'S FRIEND</h3>

<p>The yarn I'm about to spring was told to me a long time ago. There's
a bunch talking about Injuns, when a feller I'm calling Curley cuts in.
"I ain't no Injun lover," says he, "but I'm willin' to give any man a
square shake.</p>

<p>"Once I'm runnin' a feed and livery stable at Black Butte. About ten
mile out I got a hay camp with a crew of men putting up hay; there's no
fences in this country, so I got a hoss herder. This herder is a
Bannock Injun; he can't talk much white man, but all the hosses seem to
savvy Bannock. I'm feedin' him and his squaw and their bead-eyed boy
who's old enough to day herd, and his dad takes 'em nights.</p>

<p>"The old man tells me his name in Bannock, which I don't savvy; but
his woman tells it in English talk, that ain't quite as lame as her
man's, that it means in my tongue 'Sorry Dog.' So as Sorry Dog, he's on
the pay roll. Besides me feedin' him and his family, Sorry Dog's
getting $25 a month. This Injun's civilized enough so he wears a hat
with the top cut out, but he bars pants; he still wears a clout,
leggin's, and blanket like the rest of his folks, besides a shirt I
give him that spring. It's a boiled one with a stiff busim which is
some soiled. This completes his garb.</p>

<p>"Sorry Dog has a lodge set up where him and his folks is living. The
white hands that works for me camps separate in square tents. This
Injun has got my work teams throwed in with the town herd which gives
him about a hundred head he's herding. As I said before, Sorry Dog
can't talk much English but he's got some language hosses seem to
savvy, and as he knows just a little more than a hoss they get along
fine.</p>

<p>"One evening I ride out to my hay camp. It's a little before sundown
I notice a strange Injun in front of Sorry Dog's lodge when I step off
my hoss. This Injun walks up holding out his hand. We shake. He's the
same as all other red brothers to me but I notice he sizes me up
plenty. His pock-marked face is smeared with vermillion, he's wearing a
green blanket wrapped to his snaky eyes, an' holding an old Spencer in
the crook of his left arm, an' I notice he's shy two fingers on that
hand. I savvy, maybe he's lost some folks it might be one of his women,
maybe it's a son, 'cause Injuns like to show their sorrow is on the
square an' sometimes hacks off their fingers. It's like white folks
tying strings on their fingers so they'll remember what they went
after. But when you chop one off you shore won't forget you'll be sorry
for a long time. I see lots of Injuns trimmed this way, so he's no
different than others of his kind.</p>

<p>"I guess he camps with his friends all night, but when I'm saddling
my hoss next morning I notice he's missing in Sorry Dog's camp. He
don't even stay to breakfast. It ain't more than breaking day when I'm
saddling, and I notice that Sorry Dog's woman is still building
bannocks. I ask where this stranger is. She don't look up from her
cooking but says 'He go.' 'Gone where?' says I. 'Lost River,' says she.
This river is easy a hundred miles from my hay camp. 'What's he doing
here?' says I. 'Come see you,' says she. 'What for see me?' says I.
'Say you good man. Say you not let other man kill his woman.'</p>

<p>"It's three years since what this squaw's talking about happens.
It's like this: Me and three other fellers are drifting north from
Nevada. We've got ten hosses there's two that's green bronks, and we're
having trouble holdin' 'em. They're bunch quitters. We hobble most of
the hosses every night but nearly every morning we're out these two,
and we comb the country hunting the quitters we've hobbled every known
way, but they've got so they can travel better with hobbles than they
kin without. But by the time we're in Idaho the bunch're so trail-worn
they stay anywhere, and we're turning 'em all loose but these two
bronks.</p>

<p>"One night we're camped in a beaver meadow with grass up to their
knees. We've camped there a couple of days, givin' this leg-weary bunch
a chance to rest, but we've still got those quitters staked by a front
foot to the willows.</p>

<p>"As I said, the feed's good, an' by changing 'em once in a while
they're doing fine. We ain't seen anybody white or red since we left
Salt Lake, but the second night in this good camp about two o'clock
we're wakened an' setting up in our blankets. It's a noise that every
man that has lived in this country knows it's the hoofs of running
hosses, and a holler that no human can make but Injuns. This yell will
scare a bunch of tired work bulls off the bed-ground.</p>

<p>"Well, we're afoot and there's no use getting up, so we just lay
there and talk it over. I've just heard the last hoof beats, when out
from the dark I hear a hoss whinner close to camp. 'We ain't afoot,'
says Kelly who's sleeping with me. 'That's one of them bunch
quitters.'</p>

<p>"Sure enough, when light comes, there they are. If you've got a hoss
that will pull a pin, if you'll just tie your stake rope to one of his
front feet and the other end to a green willow, pretty well up so as to
give it spring, it's a safe bet you'll have a hoss in the morning, as
he can't break his rope or pull the willow, an' there's too much spring
to hurt him. If these Injuns had of known that, they'd have slipped in
an' cut the ropes, but they overlooked a bet and I guess they thought
they had 'em all.</p>

<p>"Well, it ain't long till me and Jim Baker that ain't his name but
that's what I'm calling him in this yarn are trailin' these hoss
thieves. Jim is sure warlike he's one man that likes to kill. I've
knowed men that would kill if they had cause, but this Jim kills for
the love of killing. It all crops out on him on this war trip of
ours.</p>

<p>"These hoss thieves ain't hard to follow. We've kept our stock all
shod and we know we're on the right track, but we're slow sometimes. We
lose the trail and pick it up again. It's dark when we locate their
camp. It looks like a small hunting party they ain't even got a lodge.
We can't see nothing but a brush wickey-up and we can't tell how many
there are. Baker's for opening the ball right away, but I talk him into
waiting till daylight.</p>

<p>"These Injuns don't think they're followed they think we're plumb
afoot, and are careless. This ain't no regular war party, 'cause I see
a woman pass between me and the firelight once in a while, and war
parties don't often have shes among 'em. I whisper this to Baker an' he
says they're all alike to him, an' I knowed by the growl in his voice
what he means. He's itchin' to kill. 'When I'm killin' lice, I don't
play no favors,' says he.</p>

<p>"We're laying in the brush in sight of the camp. These Injuns are
laughin' and talkin', but I ain't able to make out their number. It's
about midnight when I doze off. The bark of a gun wakens me, and there
stands Baker with his gun still smoking. It's moonlight and I can see
this camp plain, an' there's an Injun laying still right in front of
the brush wickey-up. I ain't more than looked till Baker's gun speaks
and there's another one down. They're all running for a patch of brush,
but when Baker kills his second Injun, I see they're only three women
left. They see they can't make it to this shelter an' the three turns
towards us with their hands up, calling for mercy, but this don't
soften Baker none. He downs one while her hands are up, an' before I
can stop him he's got another bead on 'em, when I get to him and kick
the gun out of his hand just as his cartridge busts. His shot goes wild
he's squatted, using his knee as a rest, making his shots dead sure,
when I kick his gun. I'm warlike myself an' I kick fur enough back to
get his hand with my heel. The look he gives me don't show no
sweetness. He's using a needle gun, an' he reaches for it again, at the
same time tellin' me a few things he thinks about me. I stand for all
this, but when his hand goes for another cartridge then I block his
game and tell him if he makes another break I'll blow a hole in him
that these squaws can walk through. He takes one look at me and he
knows my Henry has a full magazine. I make him drop his cartridge belt
and walk away from it.</p>

<p>"One of these squaws is young, the other old an' wrinkled. I tell
the young one in signs to take my hoss and round up all the hosses.
Both these women are so scared the white shows under their paint, but
they savvy I'm their friend an' it ain't long till she's got all the
hosses in. These Injun hosses with those they stole from us makes about
twenty head. All ours are there. I give three to the women and tell
them to light out. They pack some grub on their extra hoss, the old
woman shakes hands with me, and they make their get-away.</p>

<p>"Baker is standing there all the time cussin' me, and the things
he's calling me ain't nice to listen to. But I got his cartridge belt,
and with his empty gun he's harmless as a pet rabbit. Well, when we get
to camp that night Baker ain't quite so frothy. The rest of the boys
sees all these hosses, and when I tell them why I'm wearing Baker's
belt they all take sides with me. They don't mind killing Injuns, but
when I tell them about them squaws coming with their hands up, this
softens 'em and they're all my way, so Baker don't get his belt back
until several days later he rides up to me and shakes hands and says he
is wrong. Then I give him ammunition but with the understanding that if
he makes one crooked break we'll all turn on him, so he stays
square.</p>

<p>"We all winter in Virginia City, but we're split up me and Murphy's
batchin' together. I see Baker once in a while he's pleasant enough,
but I ain't forgot the looks given me when I kicked the gun out of his
hand, and I never feel safe with my back to him.</p>

<p>"One night Baker's playin' the bank and quarrels with another
feller. This feller was quicker than Baker, which was the end of the
killin'est man I ever knowed, and to tell the truth I don't miss Baker
none and feel a whole lot easier. I'd near forgot about him when Sorry
Dog's woman tells me why this strange Injun comes so far to see me.</p>

<p>"A year after this happens I'm on my way back to Black Butte from
this same ranch. I ain't more than started, when I bump into a band of
twenty-five of the most disagreeable-looking Injuns I ever see. The
minnit they sight me they pull their ponies down to a walk an' start
peelin' their guns. They're about a hundred yards off when they all
stop, and one of them starts talking in his own tongue, which I don't
savvy. Finally he comes to me alone. He's stripped to the waist and
painted yeller and green and he looks nastier than a Healy Monster.
When he rides up close he tells me in sign he's my friend. There's
nothing about him that looks like friendship and I watched for some
crooked move, when I get a flash of his left hand. It's shy two
fingers. This makes me look closer and I notice pockmarks under his
paint, and then he tells me he knows me; that I'm his woman's friend;
that all his people like me; that my heart is strong; that there's no
man among the Bannocks that would harm me.</p>

<p>"The only weapon I got is an old cap-and-ball Colt's. If I didn't
waste no lead this might get six, but there's anyhow twenty-five. So,
when this savage tells me all Bannocks are my friends, he shook hands
again and again and told me to go, and I took his word for it."</p>

<p>"Next day the whites are all coming into Black Butte, telling about
the Bannock outbreak. Them Injuns done a lot of killing before they
stopped a little ways from where they met me. They killed four
whites.</p>

<p>"I heard that all good Injuns were dead ones. If that's true, I'm
damn glad the one I met that day was still a bad one."</p>

<p><b>AN INDIAN DANCER</b></p>
</center>

<h3><a name="ch2-3"></a>WHEN MIX WENT TO SCHOOL</h3>

<p>"School days, school days, dear old Golden Rule days that's the song
I've heer'd 'em sing," says Rawhide Rawlins, "an' it may be all right
now, but there was nothin' dear about school days when I got my
learnin'. As near as I can remember them he-schoolmarms we had was made
of the same material as a bronco-buster. Anyway the one I went to in
Missouri had every kid whip-broke. He'd call a name an' pick up a
hickory, an' the owner of the name would come tremblin' to the
desk.</p>

<p>"Charlie Mix maybe some of you knowed him that used to run the stage
station at Stanford, tells me about his school days, an' it sure sounds
natural. As near as I can remember, he's foaled back in the hills in
New York state. There's a bunch of long, ganglin' kids in this neck of
the woods that's mostly the offspring of old-time lumber jacks that's
drifted down in that country, an' nobody has to tell you that this
breed will fight a buzz-saw an' give it three turns the start.</p>

<p>"These old grangers bring in all kinds of teachers for this school,
but none of 'em can stay the week out. The last one the kids trim is
pretty game an' is over average as a rough-an'-tumble fighter, but his
age is agin him. He's tall an' heavy in the shoulders like a work bull,
an' he wears long moss on his chin which he's sure proud of, but it
turns out it don't help him none to win a battle. Two or three of these
Reubens would be easy for him, but when they start doublin' up on him
about ten strong, one or two hangin' in his whiskers, another couple
ham-stringin' him and the rest swingin' on him with slates, it makes
him dizzy. Eye-gougin' an' bitin' ain't barred either, an' this
wisdom-bringer has got the same chance of winnin' as a grasshopper that
hops into an anthill. He comes to the school in a spring buggy with a
high-strung span of roadsters, but he leaves in a light spring wagon,
layin' on a goosehair bedtick, with several old ladies bathin' his
wounds. The team is a quiet pair of plow animals, an' the driver is
told to move along slow an' avoid all bumps.</p>

<p>"It looks like a life vacation to the boys, but the old folks think
different. They don't 'low to have their lovin' offspring grow up into
no ignorant heathen. So one night these old maws an' paws pull a kind
of medicine smoke, an' two of the oldest braves is detailed to go to
the big camp, work the herd an' cut out a corral boss for these kids.
They go down to New York City, an' after perusin' aroun' they locate a
prize-fighter that's out of work. They question him, an' findin' he can
read an' write an' knows the multiplication table, they hire him.</p>

<p>"Next morning, Mix tells me, teacher shows up an' the boys are all
there itchin' to tear into him. But Mix says there's somethin' about
this teacher's looks that makes him superstitious. Of course he don't
say nothin' not wantin' to show yaller but somehow he's got a hunch
that somethin's goin' to happen.</p>

<p>"This gent's head is smaller than's usual in humans. There don't
seem to be much space above his eyes, an' his smile, which is meant to
be pleasant, is scary. There's a low place where his nose ought to be,
an' he could look through a keyhole with both eyes at once. His neck's
enough larger than his head so that he could back out of his shirt
without unbuttoning his collar. From here down he's built all ways for
scrappin', an' when he's standin' at rest his front feet hang about
even with his knees. All this Mix takes in at a glance.</p>

<p>"When the school room quiets down the new teacher pulls a nice
little talk. 'Boys,' says he, 'I ain't huntin' for trouble, but it's
been whispered around that this bunch is fighty, an' I'm here to tell
you as a gentleman that if there's any battle pulled, you boys is goin'
to take second money.'</p>

<p>"The last word ain't left his mouth till one of the big kids blats
at him.</p>

<p>"'Come here,' says he, kind of pleasant, to the kid that did it. The
kid starts, but the whole bunch is with him.</p>

<p>"The teacher don't move nor turn a hair, but he kind of shuffles his
feet like he's rubbin' the rosin. The first kid that reaches him, he
side steps an' puts him to sleep with a left hook. The next one he
shoots up under a desk with an upper-cut, and the kid lays there
snorin'. They begin goin' down so fast Mix can't count 'em, but the
last he remembers he sees the big dipper an' the north star, an' a
comet cuts a hole through the moon. When he comes to, it looks like the
battle of Bull Run, an' teacher is bendin' over, pourin' water on him
from a bucket. He can hear what few girl scholars there is outside
cryin'.</p>

<p>"When he gets through bringin' his scholars back to life, teacher
tells the boys to get their song books an' line up.</p>

<p>"'Now,' says he, 'turn to page 40 an' we will sing that beautiful
little song:'</p>

<p>"'Every Monday mornin' we are glad to go to school, For we love our
lovin' teacher an' obey his kindly rule.'</p>

<p>"'He makes us sing that every mornin',' says Mix, 'an' we was sure
broke gentle.'"</p>

<h3><a name="ch2-4"></a>MORMON MURPHY'S CONFIDENCE</h3>

<p>The line camp was jammed to her fifteen by twenty-foot log walls. It
was winter, and the storm had driven many homeless punchers to shelter.
Both bunks were loaded with loungers, and as cow-people never sit down
when there is a chance to lie down, the blankets on the floor in their
tarpaulin covers held their share of cigarette-smoking forms. Talk
drifted from one subject to another riding, roping, and general range
chat, finally falling to the proper and handy way to carry a rifle.</p>

<p>"I used ter pack my gun in a sling," said old Dad Lane, the wolfer.
"They ain't used these days, since men's got ter usin' scabbards an'
hangin' 'em under their legs. Them old-fashioned slings was used by all
prairie and mountain men. If you never seed one, they was made of
buckskin or sometimes boot leather, cut in what I'd call a long circle
with a hole in each end that lipped over the saddle horn. The gun stuck
through acrost in front of ye. In them same times men used gun-covers
made of skin or blanket. As I said before, I used one of them slings
till I near got caught with my hobbles on; since then I like my weapon
loose an' handy. I'll tell you how the play comes up.</p>

<p>"It's back in '78, the same year that Joseph's at war agin the
whites. Me an' Mormon Murphy's comin' up from Buford, follerin' the
Missouri, trappin' the streams an' headin' toward Benton. This Murphy
ain't no real Mormon. He's what we'd call a jack-Mormon; that is, he'd
wintered down with Brigham an' played Mormon awhile. He's the best
natured man I ever knowed, always wearin' a smile an' lookin' at the
bright side of things. We'd wood-hawked, hunted an' trapped together
for maybe four years, an' I never heered 'im kick on nothin'. He claims
when a man's got his health he's got no licence to bellyache. Murphy's
good-hearted till he's foolish, an' so honest he thinks everybody else
is on the square. He says if you treat folks right, nobody'll bother
you. It's a nice system to play, but I arger it won't do to gamble on.
There is men that'll tell ye when ye've tipped yer hole-card, but
they're long rides apart. This same confidence in humans is what gets
Mormon killed off.</p>

<p>"Well, as I said before, we're trappin' along an' takin' it easy. In
them days all a man needs is a shootin'-iron an' a sack of salt to
live. There's nothin' to worry us. We're in the Gros Ventres' country,
but they ain't hoss-tile, an' we're never out o' sight o' meat the
country's lousy with game.</p>

<p>"One mornin' we're joggin' along at a good gait. It's late in the
fall, an' ye know cool weather makes hosses travel up good, when ol'
Blue, one of the pack-hosses, throws up his head an' straightens his
ears like he sees something, an' when a hoss does this, ye can tap
yerself, he ain't lyin'. So I go to watchin' the country ahead where
he's lookin'.</p>

<p>"Sure enough, pretty soon there's a rider looms up out of a draw
'bout half a mile off. It's an Injun I can tell by the way he swings
his quirt an' is diggin' his heels in his pony's belly at every step.
There's a skift of snow on the country an' he shows up plain agin the
white. When he gits clost enough he throws up his hand an' signs he's a
friend. Then I notice he's left-handed anyhow, he's packin' his gun
that-a-way. It's in a skin cover stuck through his belt, Injun fashion,
with the stock to the left, but what looks crooked to me after sizin'
him up is that his quirt hangs on his right wrist.</p>

<p>"With hand-talk I ask him what he is; he signs back 'Gros Ventre.'
This Injun looks like any other savage; he's wearin' a white blanket
capote with blue leggin's of the same goods. From the copper rim-fire
cattridges in his belt, I guess his weapon's a Henry. Now what makes me
think he's lyin' is his pony. He's ridin' a good-lookin' but leg-weary
Appalusy, an', as I know, these hosses ain't bred by no Indians east o'
the Rockies. 'Course all Injuns is good hoss-thieves an' there's plenty
o' chance he got him that-away, but the Umatilla camp's a long way off,
an' these peculiar spotted ponies comes from either there or Nez Perce
stock.</p>

<p>"Well, he rides up, an' instead o' comin' to my right an' facin' me,
he goes roun' one o' the pack-hosses an' comes quarterin' behind me to
the left, his hoss pintin' the same as mine, an' holdin' out his hand
says, 'How!' with one o' them wooden smiles. Ye know ye can't tell what
an Injun's got for a hole-card by readin' his countenance; winner or
loser he looks the same. I shuk my head someway I don't like this
maneuver; I don't know what his game is, but ain't takin' no
chances."</p>

<p><b>A SHOW INDIAN</b></p>

<p>"He looks at me like his feelin's is hurt, swings around behind my
hoss an' goes to Murphy the same way. Then I'm suspicious an' hollers
to Murphy:</p>

<p>"Don't shake hands with that savage,' says I.</p>

<p>"What are ye afeard of?' says he, holdin' out his hand an' smilin'
good-natured. 'He won't hurt nobody.' Them's the last words Mormon ever
speaks.</p>

<p>"It's the quickest trick I ever seed turned; when they grip hands,
that damn snake pulls Murphy toward him, at the same time kickin' the
Mormon's hoss in the belly. Naturally the animal lunges forward, makin'
Murphy as helpless as a man with no arms. Like a flash the Injun's left
hand goes under his gun-cover to the trigger. There's a crack, an' the
smell of burnt leather an' cloth."</p>

<p><b>"THE INJUN PULLS MURPHY TOWARD HIM, AND AT THE SAME TIME HIS LEFT
HAND PULLS THE TRIGGER"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Murphy ain't hit the ground before that Injun quits his hoss, an'
when he lands he lands singin'. I savvy what that means it's his death
song, an' I'm workin' like a beaver to loosen my gun from that damn
sling. Maybe it ain't a second, but it seems to me like an hour before
it's loose an' I'm playin' an accompaniment to his little ditty. This
solo don't last long till I got him as quiet as he made the Mormon.</p>

<p>"When the Injun first rides up, he figgers on downin' me fust. He's
a mind reader an' the smilin' Mormon looks easy. Seein' his game
blocked, he takes a gamblin' chance. He'd a-got me, too, but the lever
on his Henry gets foul of the fringe on the cover, an' I got him on a
limb.</p>

<p>"Yes, I planted my pard, all right, but as I ain't got nothin' to
dig a grave with bigger 'n a skinnin'-knife, I wraps him in his blanket
an' packs him down to a washout an' caves a bank on him. When I takes a
last look at him, he seems to be smilin' like he forgives everybody. I
tell ye, fellers, I don't know when I cried, it's been a long time ago,
an' I didn't shed no tears then, but I damn nigh choked to death at
that funeral.</p>

<p>"I've helped plant a whole lot of men one time an' another in my
career, but this is the only time I did it single-handed an' lonesome.
It's just me an' the hosses, but I'll tell ye I'm damn glad to have
them. When ye ain't got humans ve'll find animals good company.</p>

<p>"No, there ain't no prayers said; I ain't used none since I was
weaned, an' I've forgot the little one my mammy learnt me. But, I
figure it out this way, there ain't no use an old coyote like me makin'
a squarin' talk for a man as good as Mormon Murphy. So I stand for a
minut with my head bowed like whites do at funerals. It's the best I
can do for him. Then I go to the hosses a-standin' there with their
heads down like they're helpin' out as mourners, especially Murphy's
with the empty saddle an' the gun still in the sling, pulled away off
to one side where the helpless Mormon makes his last grab.</p>

<p>"I don't scalp the Injun not that I wouldn't like to, but I ain't
got time to gather no souvenirs an' I'm afeared to hang around, 'cause
Injuns ain't lonesome animals; they band up, an' it's safe bettin' when
we see one there's more near by. If I'd a-tuk a head and tail robe
off'n him, I'd a-peeled him to his dewclaws, but as it is I'm nervous
an' hurried, an' all I got's his hoss an' gun an' four pair of new
moccasins I found under his belt.</p>

<p>"Guess this Injun's a Nez Perce, all right, because a short time
after the killin' of Murphy there's a bull-train jumped an' burned on
the Cow Creek, an' it ain't long till Joseph surrenders to Miles over
on the Snake."</p>

<h3><a name="ch2-5"></a>LEPLEY'S BEAR</h3>

<p>Old Man Lepley tells me one time about a bear he was near enough to
shake hands with but they don't get acquainted. He's been living on hog
side till he's near starved. So, one day he saddled up and starts
prowling for something fresh. There's lots of black-tail in the country
but they have been hunted till they are shy, so after riding a while
without seeing nothing he thinks he'll have better luck afoot. So, the
first park he hits, he stakes his hoss. It's an old beaver meadow with
bluejoint to his cayuse's knees, and about the center (like it's put
there for him) is a dead cottonwood snag handy to stake his hoss
to.</p>

<p>"After leaving the park he ain't gone a quarter of a mile till he
notices the taller branches of a chokecherry bush movin'.There's no
wind, and Lepley knows that bush don't move without something pushing
it, so naturally he's curious. 'Tain't long till he heap savvys. It's a
big silvertip and he's sure busy berrying. There's lots of meat here,
and bear grease is better than any boughten lard. So, Lepley pulls down
on him, aimin' for his heart. Mr. Bear bites where the ball hits. It
makes Old Silver damn disagreeable he starts bawlin' and comin'.</p>

<p>"As I said before, there ain't no wind. It's the smoke from his gun
hovering over Lepley that tips it off where he's hiding. He's packing a
Sharp's carbine an' he ain't got time to reload, so he turns this bear
hunt into a foot race. It's a good one, but it looks like the man'll
take second money. When he reaches the park his hoss has grazed to the
near end. Lepley don't stop to bridle, but leaps for the saddle.</p>

<p>"About this time the hoss sees what's hurrying the rider. One look's
enough. In two jumps, he's giving the best he's got. Suddenly something
happens. Lepley can't tell whether it's an earthquake or a cyclone, but
everything went from under him, and he's sailin' off; but he's flying
low, and uses his face for a rough lock, and stops agin some bushes.
When he wakes up he don't hear harps nor smell smoke. It ain't till
then he remembers he don't untie his rope. The snag snapped off, and
his hoss is tryin' to drag it out of the country, and Mr. Bear, by the
sound of breaking brush, is hunting a new range and it won't be
anywhere near where they met. When his hoss stops on the end of the
rope, that old snag snaps and all her branches scatter over the park. I
guess Mr. Bear thinks the hoss has turned on him. Maybe some of them
big limbs bounced on him and he thinks the hoss has friends and they're
throwing clubs at him. Anyhow, Mr. Bear gives the fight to Lepley and
the hoss."</p>

<p><b>"HIS HOSS STOPS ON THE END OF THE ROPE"</b></p>

<p>"Lepley says that for months he has to walk that old hoss a hundred
yards before he can spur him into a lope, and that you could stake him
on a hairpin and he'd stay."</p>

<h3><a name="ch2-6"></a>HOW LOUSE CREEK WAS NAMED</h3>

<p>"Ain't you ever heard how Louse Creek got its name?" inquires
Rawhide Rawlins. "Well, I ain't no historian, but I happen to savvy
this incident. The feller that christens it ain't like a lot of
old-timers that consider it an honor to have streams an' towns named
after 'em. His first name's Pete, and he still lives in the Judith, but
I ain't goin' no further exceptin' to say he's a large, dark-complected
feller, he's mighty friendly with Pat O'Hara, and his hangout is the
town of Geyser.</p>

<p>"When I knowed him first he's a cowpuncher. From looks you'd say he
didn't have nothin' under his hat but hair, but what he knows about
cows is a gift. Right now he's got a nice little bunch rangin' in the
foothills. There's a lot of talk about the way he gets his start you
can believe it or not, suit yourself but I think it's his winnin' way
among cows. He could come damn near talkin' a cow out of her calf. Some
say they've seen calves follerin' his saddle hoss across the prairie.
One old cowman says he's seen that, alright, but lookin' through
glasses, there's a rope between the calf and Pete's saddle horn.</p>

<p>"But goin' back to the namin' of Louse Creek, it's one spring
roundup, back in the early '80s. We're out on circle, an' me an' Pete's
ridin' together. Mine's a center-fire saddle, and I drop back to
straighten the blanket an' set it. I ain't but a few minutes behind
him, but the next I see of Pete is on the bank of this creek, which
didn't have no name then. He's off his hoss an' has stripped his shirt
off. With one boulder on the ground an' another about the same size in
his hand, he's poundin' the seams of the shirt. He's so busy he don't
hear me when I ride up, and he's cussin' and swearin' to himself. I
hear him mutter, 'I'm damned if this don't get some of the big
ones!'</p>

<p>"Well, from this day on, this stream is known as Louse Creek."</p>

<h3><a name="ch2-7"></a>JOHNNY REFORMS LANDUSKY</h3>

<p>"Over in Lewistown there's a gent livin' that's one of the leadin'
citizens. I ain't tippin' his hand by mentionin' no names, but if I'd
ever told what I know about him he'd be makin' hair bridles to-day,"
said Rawhide Rawlins. "We'll call him Johnny an' let it go at
that."</p>

<p>"A hoss-wrangler by perfession, he has a natural gift for cookin'
an' a keen affection for a Dutch oven, but in them crude days his
qualities as a chef ain't appreciated by his rough, uncouth comrades in
Yogo Gulch, where when I first knowed him he's leadin' a happy,
care-free life, watchin' the miners strugglin' to wrest gold from the
unyieldin' rocks. I remember one finicky proposition in the camp that
objects to Johnny's pet rats livin' in the flour sack.</p>

<p>"Johnny's got such a good opinion of his own cookin' he hangs up a
standin' bet that he can outcook any man in Montana, barrin' Dirty
Mike, a chef of the Sour Dough School, who's got a sensitive
disposition and is impulsive with a gun. One record Johnny points to is
a vinegar pie he bakes at Yogo. It seems that while the pie's in the
oven, a prospector, Bedrock Jim, with whom he's bachin', puts some
giant powder in with the pie to thaw it out. The powder, likely
becomin' jealous of the pie, cuts loose and scatters the cabin for
miles up and down the gulch. They find one stove lid on Lost Fork, and
the pan the pie's in is missin', but there where the cabin once stood
is Vinegar, himself, without even a scar.</p>

<p>"Bein' discouraged in his light cookin', an' never workin' as long
as he can get anything else to do, Johnny begins figgerin' out a soft
way of makin' a livin'. His pious disposition inclines him toward
missionary work, finally, and he picks out the Little Rockies as the
most promisin' district to begin reformin'. He starts a revival there
that's a cross between Mormonism an' a Sioux ghost dance, but this
brand's too tough for even the citizens of this section.</p>

<p>"In them days Landusky is the principal town in the Little Rockies,
an' it's a sociable camp, life there bein' far from monotonous. The
leadin' industries is saloons an' gamblin' houses, with a fair
sprinklin' of dance halls. For noise an' smoke there wasn't nothin'
ever seen like it before the big fight in Europe starts. Little lead's
wasted, as the shootin's remarkably accurate an' almost anybody serves
as a target.</p>

<p>"The mayor, Jew Jake, has lost one hind leg in a argument with a
sheriff, and he uses a Winchester for a crutch. Funerals in Landusky is
held at night under a white flag, so that business ain't interrupted in
the daytime.</p>

<p>"It's towards this peaceful village that Johnny rides one day on a
hoss that he's borrowed from a rancher who isn't in when he calls.
Johnny don't know he's near a town till he hears it a few miles away.
Spurrin' his hoss along he suddenly busts into sight of the place,
which reminds him of a chromo of Gettysburg he once seen. But Johnny's
game, an' mutterin' somethin' that might have been a short prayer, he
passes through the firin' line, bein' shy only his hat and a cigarette
he was smokin' when he arrives.</p>

<p>"Either the excitement or somethin' he takes for it puts him into a
kind of trance for a few days, an' when he comes to he's laid out on a
poker table with his head hangin' off. He takes readily to the life of
the place, an' picks as his partner Dum Dum Bill, who's got the
reputation of bein' a quiet, scholarly man with a lovable character,
always shootin' to kill to save unnecessary pain an' sufferin'. Dum
Dum's made a hobby of changin' brands on hosses, an' he's done much to
discourage gamblin' by makin' it hard, if not impossible, for other
players in a game he's sittin' in to win. His end's a sad ore. Bein'
caught by a war party of Missourians who's had bad luck with their hoss
herds, he's strung up to a corral crossbar. As he hasn't got enough
weight below his head to break his neck, his end's hastened by tuckin'
an anvil into the seat of his pants.</p>

<p>"Johnny, after throwin' in with Dum Dum Bill, does a lot of good as
a reformer. It's due to him that the custom of shootin' at unarmed
strangers is barred, an' a bounty a little less than they paid for a
wolf is placed on a number of citizens. As he's in with the reformers,
Johnny's name ain't on this list. The bounty claimer has to show both
ears of his victims but scalpin' is frowned on as uncivilized."</p>

<p><a name="trails-27"></a><img alt="" src=

<p><b>"A BOUNTY IS PLACED ON A NUMBER OF CITIZENS"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Johnny's in much demand for preachin' funeral sermons, but
sometimes he ain't got much tact. At one buryin' where the deceased's
been killed in a gun battle, Johnny takes as his text, 'When Fools Go
Forth to Fight.' The relatives of the corpse get hostile and Johnny has
to spend the next three weeks in a stockade he's built around his house
for an emergency like this. After a while he's elected mayor, but as he
ain't over-good with a forty-five, he don't take the job.</p>

<p>"Some forms of killin' was barred in Landusky, an' when Johnny makes
a puddin' for a Thanksgivin' dinner that kills three guests and
disables several more, he has to make a quick get-away. He beats a
posse to the railroad by a dozen jumps and swings under the rods of a
freight train that's passin'.</p>

<p>"I never took no stock in the rumors that was scattered about Johnny
afterward joinin' the Curry gang. The Kid once tells me he'd give five
hundred dollars for the name of the man that starts this libel against
his hold-up outfit."</p>

<h3><a name="ch2-8"></a>SAFETY FIRST! BUT WHERE IS IT?</h3>

<p>"Safety first! is the big holler to-day," says Rawhide Rawlins, "but
how do you know when and where you're safe? These days it's hard to
find. A rocking chair looks gentle, but when an earthquake comes along
it's no safer nor as safe as a locoed bronk. A bronk might get you in
the clear. I never heard of a salmon from fresh water hurting anybody,
but out of a can he's often dangerous.</p>

<p>"One time I'm on a coach," says Rawhide. "I'm sitting up with the
driver. We're going down a steep grade when the brake pole snaps. The
coach starts crowding the wheelers. Playing safe, I jumps. I roll down
a bank about forty feet an' stop in a bed of cactus. This driver's a
good one and starts playing the silk on his six, and keeps them ahead
of the wheels. They don't run twenty-five yards till the man with the
ribbons finds an up-grade, straightens his team and stops. The coach is
loaded and nobody gets a scratch. But me, that's playing safe I look
like a porcupine, and it takes weeks to pluck me!</p>

<p>"Old Bedrock Jim tells me one time about him and his pardner.
They're prospecting in the Big Horns. One morning they're out of meat.
They ain't gone far till they jump an elk. It's a bull. Bedrock gets
the first shot that's all he needs. The bull goes to his knees and
rolls over. They both walk up, laying their guns agin a log. The bull's
laying with his head under him. Bedrock notices the blood on the bull's
neck and thinks his neck's broke, but when he grabs a horn and starts
to straighten him out to stick him, the bull gets up. And he ain't
friendly and goes to war with Bedrock and his pardner. He's between the
hunters and their guns. There's nothing to do but give the bull the
fight.</p>

<p>"Bedrock makes a scrub pine that's agin a rock ledge. This tree
won't hold two, so his pardner finds a hole under the ledge. It's late
in the winter; there's plenty of snow and the wind's in the north.
There ain't much comfort up this jack pine. When Bedrock looks around,
he notices that Jack Williams (that's his pardner's name) keeps coming
out of the hole. Then the bull will charge them. Jack goes back but he
don't stay long. The bull ain't only creased, and he's mighty nasty.
His hair's all turned the wrong way and the way he rattles his horns
agin the rocks around that hole tells he ain't jokin'. But Bedrock
can't savvy why, when the bull steps back, Jack comes out of the
hole.</p>

<p>"Bedrock's getting cold and plumb out of patience, and he finally
hollers down from his perch, 'If you'd stay in that hole, you damn
fool, that bull would leave and give us a chance to get away!'"</p>

<center>
<p><a name="trails-28"></a><img alt="" src=
"0700941h-images/0700941h-28.jpg"></p>

<p><b>"STAY IN THAT HOLE, YOU DAMN FOOL!"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Jack is taking his turn outside. The bull charges. Jack ducks in as
the bull scrapes his horns on the rocks. The bull backs away, shakin'
his head. This time when Jack shows, he yells up to Bedrock, 'Stay in
the hole, hell! There's a bear in the hole.'</p>

<p>"It's near dark when they get away. Bedrock gets on a lower limb and
flags the bull with his coat. He's taking a long chance. The footing
he's got, if he ever slips, it's good-bye. As I said before, the bull
ain't joshing, but he holds the bull till Jack gets his gun, and when
he does he sure kills him. He empties his Henry into him and not a ball
goes by."</p>

<h3><a name="ch2-9"></a>A PAIR OF OUTLAWS</h3>

<p>"The worst hoss I ever rode," said Bowlegs, "I rode because I had
to. It was a case of ride or lose my locks, an' I'm still wearin'
hair.</p>

<p>"I was born in a cow-country an' raised with a hoss under me. I've
been ridin' 'em ever since, an' come pretty near savvyin' the animal.
Of course I'm a has-been now, but there was a time when I feared
nothin' that wore hair, an' I've rode some bad ones. This snaky hoss is
one I pick up on the range one time I'm makin' a get-away.</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' into no details, but I'm with a trail outfit when I
get into this jackpot. It's at a dance-house where we've been long
enough for the redeye they're handin' us to get action, an' durin' an'
between quadrilles we're sure givin' full vent to our joy. I'm gettin'
pretty well salivated an' it ain't no wonder, 'cause one drink of this
booze would make a jackrabbit spit in a rattlesnake's eye.</p>

<p>"But we're all peaceful enough till the sport that runs this
hog-ranch objects to the noise I'm makin'. There's a little back talk
an' he tells me if I don't take my gun off he'll make me eat it. He's a
bad 'ombry, already packin' notches on his gun, an' I'm not so drunk
but what I can see the butt of a forty-five peepin' from his
waistband.</p>

<p>"Knowin' this feller's back history, I ain't takin' no chances. I
see his right hand drop; the next thing I know he's on the floor with a
bunch of screamin' women over him, an' I'm backin' for the door with a
smokin' gun.</p>

<p>"It's night, an' goin' from light into darkness that way blinds me
for a second or two, but it ain't long till I got my hoss from a
snortin', whistlin' bunch at the rack. An' the way that old cow-pony
pushes the country behind him, it looks like he savvies there's
trouble.</p>

<p>"Our wagon's camped about a mile from this burg, an' it ain't long
till I hear the bell of the remuda. This saddle bunch is pretty well
trail-worn, but I've one tough, long-winded hoss in my string, an' as
the one I'm on won't stand a hard ride, I'm thinkin' of changin'. So
when I locate the hoss-wrangler, after tellin' him my troubles, he
bunches the remuda till I drop the loop on my top hoss. This wrangler's
righter than a rabbit, 'cause when he shakes goodbye, he forks over all
his cattridges an' what loose money he's got.</p>

<p>"I know the country south of me well enough, but it ain't healthy
hangin' too close to the old trail, so ridin' wide of that, I travel
the lonesome places. There ain't no wire in the country them days an'
it's smooth sailin'. Cattle's plentiful, an' by the use of my six-gun
it's no trouble to get beef. Three days later I'm crossin' the Cheyenne
country. These people are pretty warlike, they've been havin'
considerable trouble with the cowmen an' there's been some killin'
done. You bet all you got they'd make it interestin' for any lonesome
puncher they bump into. Knowin' this, I'm mighty cautious.</p>

<p>"What's troublin' me most is my hoss. I've covered anyway two
hundred miles, an' he's gone tender. His feet's so wore down that once,
lookin' back, I notice blood in his track, an' I can't help thinkin'
what a snap these savages would have if they'd run onto me ridin' this
leg-weary pony.</p>

<p>"About this time I sight a bunch of hosses trailin' in to water.
They're all Injun stock, mostly mares, barrin' one big, high-headed
roan. If I can only get my string on him I'll be all right, but with
this dead-head between my legs, how am I goin' to do it?</p>

<p>"The creek they're headin' for is pretty broken, an' there's a
chance to cut-bank him, so droppin' in behind, I trail along easy, like
I'm one of 'em. None of 'em notice me much but the roan; he keeps
eyein' me over his shoulder, kind of suspicious. He's a rangy hoss with
four white feet an' a bald face, one glass eye givin' him a snaky look.
His tail's been trimmed out, an' saddle-marks tells me he's been
rode.</p>

<p>"The only thing I don't like about him is his brands. He wears an
iron everywhere you can burn a hoss even his neck an' both jaws. He's
burnt till he resembles a brand-book. I don't have to tell you fellers
that's a bad sign. Whenever you see a hoss worked over this way, it's a
cinch he's changed hands a lot of times an' none of his owners loved
him. But then, again, if I'm pickin' a hoss for a long ride, give me a
bad one. If he's an outlaw, he ain't got me beat none there's a pair of
us.</p>

<p>"When we drop down on the water I'm plenty pleased. It couldn't have
been better if I'd had it made to order. She's cut-banked an'
rim-rocked up an' down as far as I can see. But the minnit we start
down the slope, Mister Roan gets nervous. With his head higher than
ever he starts circlin'. He's seen me makin' my loop, an' it looks like
he's on to my hole-card. Right here the creek makes a half-circle, with
walls on the opposite side from eight to ten feet high.</p>

<p>"These hosses act pretty dry, for the minnit their feet hit the wet,
their muzzles go to the water; all but the roan he's too busy watchin'
me. I've got him cut-banked an' he knows it, but's figurin' on breakin'
back. The minnit my rope hits the air, he starts for the open, head an'
tail up, but the hum of my swingin' rope turns him, an' back he goes
through the mares. With one jump, clearin' the creek, he's agin the
bank an' tryin' to climb out, but it's too many for him. He's back with
a bull rush, knockin' one mare down an' jumpin' over another. He comes
out of there like a bat out of hell an's got the whole bunch stirred up
now. Reefin' my tired hoss from shoulder to flank, we jump to the gap.
I ain't takin' no chances; my rope's tied hard an' fast, an' with one
backhand swing my loop settles on his shoulders, but grabbin' the slack
quick, I jerk her up his jaws. Then throwin' all my weight in my left
stirrup, with my right spur hooked under the cantle to help my hoss, I
wait for the jar.</p>

<p>"This old hoss I'm ridin' 's one of the kind that holds with his
hindquarters towards the animal. He's spread out an' braced, but bein'
weak, when the roan goes to the end of the rope, he's jerked down. The
roan's in the air when the rope tightens, an' he goes plumb over,
turnin' a summerset an' hittin' the ground with a thud that stuns him,
givin' my hoss time to get to his feet.</p>

<p>"Tain't two seconds till the roan's up and comin' at me through the
dust, with his head an' ears up an' tail flagged; he sure looks
warlike. Trottin' up within twenty-five feet of me he stops with all
feet braced an' whistles long an' loud. He's tryin' to buffalo me. It's
the first hoss I ever see that I'm plumb scared of. From looks he's a
man-eater; he's got me pretty near bluffed.</p>

<p>"But sizin' up the hoss under me, it's a groundhog case climb the
tree or the dog'll get you. So slidin' from the saddle I start walkin'
up on the rope. He stands braced till I reach his nose; then strikes
like a flash of lightnin' with both front feet, just touchin' the rim
of my hat. By the way his hoofs cut the air, it wouldn't have been
healthy for me if I'd a-been under 'em.</p>

<p>"'If that's yer game, I'll head it off,' thinks I, so goin' to my
saddle hoss I unloop the McCarthy from my hackamore. An' buildin'
another loop, 'tain't long till I got him by the front feet. When I get
him hobbled good, I unsaddle my old friend an' start fixin' for high
ridin'. From the looks of the roan's hindquarters an' the way he's
muscled an' strung up it's a safe bet he'll go in the air some. When
I'm bridlin' him he tries to reach me with his front feet, but bein'
hobbled, can't do much. He stands humped, but quiet enough when I'm
bridlin' him. He can't fool me; by the way his left ear's dropped down
an' the look he's givin' me with that glass eye, I savvy he's layin'
for me.</p>

<p>"Of a sudden he swings his head a little to the right an'
straightens his ears. Lookin' between 'em, I spy a band of about as
nasty a-lookin' Cheyennes as I ever see. One look's a plenty; the way
they're stripped an' painted, I know they ain't friendly. These Injuns
have sighted me now; I can tell that by their yelpin'. They ain't
more'n half a mile off, every pony runnin' an' every rider kickin' him
in the belly.</p>

<p>"It's sure a case of hurry up, so tightenin' the cinch till the roan
grunts, an' loosenin' the footrope, I grab the cheekpiece of the bridle
an' pull the roan's head close 'round to me. Grippin' the horn of the
saddle an' chuckin' my foot into the stirrup to the heel, I step across
him. The minnit he feels my weight, the ball opens.</p>

<p>"Mister Outlaw squats an' then shoots up straight as a rocket so
straight I'm afraid he's comin' back over, but he don't. He lands all
spraddled out. The next jump he catches his head, weaves an' sunfishes,
hittin' the ground one leg at a time, all stiffened, givin' me four
separate jolts. This mighty near loosens me, but hookin' my right spur
in his shoulder an' grabbin' leather with all hands, I get back. When
he goes up again he shakes himself like a dog leavin' water, an' the
saddle pops an' rattles, causin' me to lose my left stirrup. As I never
did get the right one, I'm sittin' on his ribs. He'd a-unloaded me all
right, but I hear shots from the Cheyennes an' it scares me so you
couldn't a-chopped me loose from him with an axe. If he turned
summersets in the air he couldn't pile me now. I've made my brags
before this that nothin' that wore hair could make me go to leather,
but this time I damn near pull the horn out by the roots, an' it's a
Visalia steel fork at that. I've heard many a hoss bawl before, but
this one roared, an' I believe if he'd a-loosened me he'd a-eat me up.
I'm scareder of him than I am of the Injuns, 'cause there ain't a man
on earth, white or red, that could hit me with a scattergun while I'm
goin' through these motions. The work I'm doin' would make a
professional trapeze performer look like a green hand. Sometimes I'm
behind the cantle, then I move over in front of the horn. Finally he
kicks my hat off either that or he makes me kick it off."</p>

<p>"I don't know how long this lasts, but I'm gettin' mighty dizzy when
the roan raises his head from where he's had it hid, an' straightenin'
his back, starts runnin'. Talk about swift hosses in two jumps I'm
goin' the fastest I ever rode; it looks like he's tryin' to run from
under me.</p>

<p>"He's sure bustin' a hole in the breeze. Once there's a Cheyenne
ball tears the dust off to one side, but it don't scare me none. At the
gait we're goin', if a ball did hit me it wouldn't break the hide. It
wouldn't no more'n catch up with us. When I look back over my shoulder
there's a chain of dust a mile long, an' it appears like the Cheyennes
're backin' up. The wind roarin' in my ears finally brings me to my
senses, an' shakin' the hair out of my hands I get the reins an' start
lookin' over my layout. The roan's mane's pretty well pulled out from
his ears back. My hat an' six-shooter's missin' an' there's one
cantle-string tore out, but barrin' these trimmin's we're all right an'
there's no kick comin'. The hoss under me can beat these Injun cavayos
any distance from a squirrel's jump to the Rocky Mountains, so I bid
farewell to the Cheyennes.</p>

<p>"Yes, fellers, that's the worst hoss I ever forked, but that same

gentle hosses is all right, but give me a snaky one for a hard

<p><a name="ch2-10"></a>THE GHOST HORSE</p>

<p>About forty-five years ago a small band of Crows, maybe twenty-five
lodges, were camped on the Greybull. As with all plains Indians, horses
meant wealth. This camp was rich, for the hills were covered with
ponies of all sizes and colors. It was early summer, and among them
were many colts.</p>

<p>Two Crow boys squatted on a knoll, wrapped to their beady eyes, one
in a white Hudson Bay blanket, the other in a ragged buffalo robe. The
hair of both was carefully fashioned in the style of their people two
parts starting over each temple and ending at the scalp lock. The
partings were painted bright vermillion, the same as the upper part of
the face. The hair between was cropped and stood erect in a brush-like
crest. Beneath their robes they wore breech-clouts and leggings, with
moccasins. Neither wore a shirt.</p>

<p>These boys were herders, and their ponies grazed at the ends of
their elkskin ropes. They not only watched the pony herds, but their
keen eyes saw anything that moved for miles around.</p>

<p>The boy in the buffalo robe beat the ground with the elkhorn handle
of his quirt and chanted the war song of his father. Suddenly his
companion threw his naked arm from under his blanket and signed,
"Medicine," at the same time pointing with his chin to a mare that
grazed nearby. The animal was a pinto, and the white parts of her coat
were painted in a way that means much to red men. Her foretop and tail
wore strips of weatherworn otter skin, and braided in her mane was a
skin bag that hid the medicine secrets of her owner.</p>

<p>The mare was well known. She was old, but had given many buffalo
horses to her master, and the long-legged colt at her flank was also a
pinto. His short back and deep chest spoke well for his future years.
His were the points of a buffalo horse.</p>

<p>The colt had been acquainted with the world only a few hours, but he
had seen, smelt, and heard many strange things. He had tried many times
to reach the grass with his muzzle, but failed by many inches. The boys
saw this, and Small Shield, the one in the ragged robe, said his
grandfather had told him that it was good when a little horse did this;
he would be strong and would carry his rider a long way between
suns.</p>

<p>It is the life story of this pinto colt that I shall tell you.</p>

<p>His first year was spent close to his mother's flank. One morning
not long after the day on which my story begins, there was great
excitement in camp. The pinto colt, which had been given the name of
Paint, saw all the horses among the lodges. The men were catching their
best animals. Some were smearing their mounts with paint. Most of the
hunters rode one horse and led another. The led horses wore no saddles
and sometimes were ridden by naked boys. These horses were decked with
feathers and paint and wore a medicine charm in mane or tail. This
might be the full skin of a magpie or a wolf leg, or possibly a bat's
wing, but whatever it was, it meant luck to the owner of the horse.</p>

<p>The women were also busy, saddling the quieter ponies or harnessing
them to the long-poled travois. As they left the camp the hunters were
in advance of the women, and as the latter traveled slower, they were
soon left behind.</p>

<p>Paint noticed that after they had gone some distance, a very old man
made a signal and the women ceased talking. Even the children were
quiet. Now all conversation was carried on by the hands in sign
language. Not long after, they topped a ridge, and it was here that
Paint first smelled the dust and heard the roar of a running herd. The
Crows were among the buffalo.</p>

<p><b>AN INDIAN SIGNAL</b></p>
</center>

<p>Here the women stopped their ponies. Many of them sang. It meant
meat and robes, which spelled life to these wild people.</p>

<p>Paint stood with pricked ears, watching the scene in the valley
below. It was an old story to his mother, who quietly cropped the
grass. Before long a rider appeared, leading a sweat-covered, panting
pony. Then others came and the women moved down the slope.</p>

<p>Paint saw many brown spots upon the prairie. As they neared them he
saw that these were horned animals, lying motionless, and he smelled
blood.</p>

<p>For five years he lived with the Crows, and himself became a buffalo
horse, wandering from one country to another, always in the wake of the
herds. One night the Crows were camped on Painted Robe Creek. They were
in a dangerous country, a land where their enemies, the Blackfeet,
often came, so the lodges were placed in a great circle, forming a
corral. At night the horses were brought into the enclosure, most of
them staked, or picketed, with short ropes.</p>

<p>The Crows had danced, and all slept soundly. A coyote back of a
butte barked. It would have fooled any human, but the wind came and
told the nose of Paint the truth it was a man. The dogs knew, too, and
many of them howled in answer.</p>

<p>Not long after this, though the night was dark, Paint saw several
robed figures among the ponies. They were busy cutting ropes, and a
pony, as soon as loosened, would walk quietly from among the lodges.
One came to Paint, and after cutting the rope at the picket pin, coiled
it and rubbed his neck. Paint knew it was a stranger and snorted; then
jumping to one side, he backed into a tripod of travois, which was hung
with drying meat. All of this upset and fell against a lodge, awakening
the sleepers. But the stranger held to Paint's rope, and crowding him
among the other horses, sprang to his back.</p>

<p>The stranger drove his heels into Paint's flanks and flapped his
robe, which he had loosened from his body, over the backs of the
animals nearest. The horses were all running now. There was much noise.
Guns talked with their yellow tongues into the darkness. Women
screamed, dogs howled, and men sang their death songs.</p>

<p>A few jumps and Paint, with his rider, was at the edge of the lodges
that formed the corral. Gunfire streaked the darkness from most of the
lodges, but as no Indian likes to kill a horse both the Crows and their
enemies fired low enough to kill a rider, but too high to hit a horse.
As Paint passed between the lodges he saw a streak of fire rip the
blackness at his side, and he felt his rider clutch his mane and ride
as he had seen the Crows at the trading post when they drank something
the white men traded them. Then Paint felt something warm and wet on
his neck and withers; the rider's legs loosened and his body lurched
heavily over the pony's shoulders to the ground, and Paint ran on
riderless.</p>

<p>He was glad to leave the lodges. The noise frightened him. He had
seen guns and arrows kill buffalo, and this night he felt as though
they might kill a horse. They had traveled far and fast when it grew
light. The pony saw painted strangers behind him. This was a Piegan war
party down from the north, which had surprised the sleeping Crows. When
they left Belly River they numbered ten, but now they were only nine.
They were mostly young men, led by Bad Wound.</p>

<p>Bad Wound had seen over fifty winters. Time had been good to him,
but war had left him not good to look at. He had lost one eye, and a
trade ball from a flintlock in the hands of a Crow had broken both
jaws, leaving him with a horrible war dimple in each cheek and a
crooked mouth.</p>

<p>When the sun came the party halted to change mounts, as the horses
under them were winded. The ponies were bunched and each rider dropped
his loop on the neck of a fresh one. It was Bad Wound's loop that
caught Paint. The war chief looked him over at rope's end, and then
signed "good and strong" to his painted companions. Walking up for
close inspection, Bad Wound's hand felt the hard, dark brown substance
on Paint's mane and withers and knew why his men only counted nine.
Then the chief drew the loop from Paint's neck, and slipping his Henry
rifle from its skin cover, fired at the pinto as it trotted into the
herd. The animal went to its knees; then rolled over and stiffened. "It
was not good," said Bad Wound, "to let a friend walk to the sand hills.
The trail is long and I have given him a strong horse."</p>

<center>
<p><a name="trails-31"></a><img alt="" src=
"0700941h-images/0700941h-31.jpg"></p>

<p><b>"THE CHIEF FIRED AT THE PINTO"</b></p>
</center>

<p>After the warriors had all caught fresh horses they took the herd to
a deep, grassy valley, where their mounts were hobbled and all the
ponies were watered and allowed to graze. The men then ate their jerked
meat, and all excepting two sentinels, who watched the back country,
rolled in their blankets or robes and slept.</p>

<p>The sun was low when they moved again, and when Bad Wound's one eye
passed over the traveling herd, his hand went to his mouth in surprise.
He said, "Ghost horse," to a near companion, and pointed to a
blood-stained horse in the herd. It was Paint, and his head and neck
showed fresh blood. Bad Wound thought his bullet had made a wound that
killed, but the lead which was meant for Paint's head had only passed
through the neck cord, stunning him for a short time.</p>

<p>They traveled mostly by night, and it was many days before they
reached the Piegan camp on the Teton. This was a large camp, a mixture
of Piegans, Bloods, and Blackfeet. As far as Paint could see the smoked
skin lodges dotted the valley. A scout, or "wolf" as he is called,
reported the coming of Bad Wound's party long before his arrival, so
when he and his men with the stolen ponies entered the camp, an old
medicine man on a much painted pony rode in advance and told the
people: "Two moons have come since these men danced with the sun and
left their lodges afoot. Their bellies have often been empty and their
tracks sometimes red, but they are brothers of the wolf, with strong
hearts. When a Blackfoot goes to war he may never return, or his hair
may be whitened by winters when he comes, but if he reaches his lodge,
whether it has been a few suns or many winters, his feet are not sore,
for he has an enemy's horse under him. I have said these are wolves,
and the wolf women will give them meat. It is good."</p>

<p>As the party rode into camp hundreds of dogs slunk silently among
the lodges. They did not bark, as their only language is the howl of
their wilder cousin, the wolf. Every travois and extra lodge pole was
hung with buffalo flesh, and the wind was heavy with the smell of
meat.</p>

<p>In the Piegan camp there was much feasting and dancing, but there
were five with their faces painted black, the father, mother, two
sisters, and the young wife of Calf Robe, the one left dead among the
Crow lodges. These people did not join in the merriment, but squatted
out on the butte, crying and cutting their arms and legs while those in
camp sang and stepped time to the big drum. And when the mourners
returned to camp, Calf Robe's wife had but two fingers on her left
hand. She had given the others to the sun to show her great sorrow.</p>

<p>Then Bad Wound came to Calf Robe's father and gave him three horses
and said: "Old Man, I would give you the horse your son rode, but he is
a ghost horse. I tried to give him to your son, but the horse would not
die. It is not good to give a friend a pony that dead men ride. Three
times while I slept the spotted horse came to me. Your son rode him,
but he was dead and the pony's back was red with blood. He is a good
horse, but I will never ride him. My heart is afraid, and I have said
that it is not good to give a friend what you fear yourself."</p>

<p>Next spring the Piegans were camped on a river called
The-Banks-That-Fell-on-Them, when a few whites came to buy ponies.
Among them was a very young boy and a man with a gray beard, who was
the boy's companion. When Bad Wound led out Paint, the boy was much
pleased, and Gray Beard counted out forty-five silver dollars into the
hand of Bad Wound.</p>

<p>So now Paint had a white master. He had never felt a bit in his
mouth before. His bridle had always been two half-hitches of rawhide
thong about his under jaw. Also the white man's saddle with its two
cinches was strange to him. His back knew only the halfbreed pad and
other Indian saddles.</p>

<p>Paint was gentle, but as all Indians mount from the offside, it was
days before he would allow the boy to mount from the near side. The
pinto pony was not to be alone, as the boy already owned a black mare
which packed his blankets and grub.</p>

<p>Some days later, Paint, the mare and their master joined a hunter
and trapper who lived in the mountains. One night as they were cooking
supper, the old hunter told the boys to trade off the mare. "Lady
hosses," said he, "are like their human sisters. They get notions of
goin' home, an' no gentleman cayuse would think of letting a lady go
alone. Judging from actions, there ain't a cayuse in our bunch that
ain't a perfect gentleman, so to play safe, boy, you stake that
mare."</p>

<p>A few days later the boy traded the mare for a one-eyed buckskin
cayuse.</p>

<p>For two years the boy lived with the hunter. The next time he
appears in our story he is wrangling horses for a trail herd which was
traveling north. This herd was turned loose on Ross's Fork, where there
was a big roundup camp. Here the boy was hired to night-herd four
hundred saddle horses. This camp reminded Paint somewhat of the homes
of his early wild owners, but the lodges were not tall like those of
the Crows or Piegans.</p>

<p>For many years Paint, with his master, followed the white man's
buffalo. Once they went north and again the pony was among the lodges
of the Piegans. When the big cow herds moved north of the Missouri,
Paint and his master were with them.</p>

<p>One night in a little cow town on Milk River, Paint, among other
ponies, was tied to a rack in front of a place where cowmen drank,
sang, and made merry. The night was warm, and the door was open, so
Paint could see inside. There was some hard talk, and Paint knew men
well enough to understand that it was war talk of the white man. He saw
a man pull a gun and fire twice, then back through the door with the
smoking weapon in his hand. Another man lay on the floor very still.
The man who had fired the gun stepped to the hitching rack, mounted a
horse and rode away into the darkness. Paint knew then that the white
man was no different from the red. They both kill their own kind.</p>

<p>Some years later two riders, one leading a pack horse, traveled
between the Missouri River and the Highwood Mountains. One of them
pointed to a heavy smoke that showed on the horizon, a little south of
west. "There's where we camp to-night," said he.</p>

<p>It was dark when they reached the town which the smoke had led them
to, and their ponies, which knew no lights but Nature's, jumped the
great shadows made by the arc lights at the street crossings. They
passed rows of saloons, dance halls, and gambling houses, and after
enquiring the way of a bystander, rode to the Park stables, where they
unsaddled and stripped the pack horse of their bedding and grub.</p>

<p>Now, under the overhanging light of the stable, I will describe the
riders and their mounts. One rider was rather slender with black hair
and eyes. The other was of medium height, with light hair worn rather
long. Both men were dressed as cow hands, and the only difference in
their clothes was a bright colored, French half-breed sash, worn by the
light-haired man. The latter's mount was a rangy gray, branded Diamond
G one of the old Geddis herd. The pack horse which he led was a bay
pinto.</p>

<p>The darker man rode a brown, strongly-built bronco, which snorted at
every strange thing he saw.</p>

<p>The name of this town was Great Falls. The rider of the brown bronc
was Henry Stough. The other, who rode the gray, was the writer of this
story. The pinto pack horse was Paint, called Monty by his owner.</p>

<p>When Paint died near Great Falls he had been with his master
twenty-five years.</p>

<p><b>RIDERS OF THE OPEN RANGE</b></p>
</center>

<h3><a name="ch3-1"></a>RANGE HORSES</h3>

<p>"Range hosses," says Rawhide Rawlins, "don't ask nothin' of men.
Since Cortez brought them, they've been takin' care of themselves.
They've been a long time learnin' from the land of drought to the
country of deep snows and long winters, they ranged.</p>

<p>"The Injuns used to tame wolves to move their camps till the
Spaniard came. These dogs bein' meat eaters, it kept the red man busy
feedin' his folks and his dogs. It's a cinch that lots of the time the
whole outfit went hungry. I'm guessin' that in those days that nobody
knows about, the red men followed the wolf and when able, drove him
from his kill, and the wolf had the best end of it. But with a hoss
under him it was different. The wolf followed the red man and got part
of his kill. Some Injuns call the hoss 'the big dog,' but I'm tellin'
about hosses.</p>

<p>"All other animals cached their young when they went to water. When
a colt was born, his mother never left him and in a short time, he
would travel with his maw. Wolves don't have much chance. Hosses stay
in bands if a wolf or wolves show up, they won't run like other
animals, they bunch; and range hosses are dangerous at both ends,
strikin' and kickin'. A wolf likes somethin' easy. After he feels the
hoofs of a range mare a few times, he quits it takes his appetite.</p>

<p>"When winter comes, the range hoss don't hug the brush like cows and
starve to death he hunts the ridges where the snow blows off. When he
gets cold, the whole band will run and warm up if the snow's deep, he
paws to the grass. This keeps him warm. Nature gives him a winter coat.
Sometimes, when his belly's full, he'll hunt a wind-break. Sometimes a
lion will get a colt, but not often. Range hosses like open country,
and won't stay in the brush only long enough to water.</p>

<p>"Hosses love pure cold water. In running water, which they like
best, most of them drink with their heads up stream, every hoss tryin'
to get up stream above the rile. I've seen bands of hosses at a prairie
spring waitin' their turn to drink where it was cold and clear. As I
said before, hosses like good water, but in countries where water ain't
good, they drink anythin' that's wet. In fly time they bunch and stand
heads and tails, each hoss using the tail of his pardner as a fly
brush. If there's a breeze they hunt high ground; if it's still, they
pick bare ground where there's lots of dust. In saddle bands, like
you'll see on roundups, hosses will stay in groups from two to four or
five."</p>

<center>
<p><a name="trails-32"></a><img alt="" src=

<p><b>"IN FLY TIME THEY STAND HEADS AND TAILS, EACH HOSS USIN' THE TAIL
OF HIS PARTNER AS A FLY BRUSH"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Some hosses will stay friends for years; others, like men, are
changeable. A band of hosses turn their hind quarters to a rain or snow
storm. They will, if driven, face a storm, but it's hard to make them
go sideways. Range hosses in a hilly country stand with their heads
down hill. You could drive a band of hosses up the steepest kind of a
hill but nobody that I ever knowed could drive a bunch straight down
(that goes with cows, too) they'd sidle it every time.</p>

<p>"Hosses raised on the plains don't like the mountains, and if
there's any chance they pull out. A hoss loves the range where he was
foaled and will drift hundreds of miles to get back. If you're
traveling with strange hosses, and camp, as long as they are tired and
hungry they stay, but if there's a bunch quitter watch him when he
fills up he'll drift and travel.</p>

<p>"Most hosses are good swimmers, but few of them like it. If you want
to play safe, swimming a hoss, loosen your cinches and jerk your bridle
off. Maybe you won't come out just where you wanted, but you'll come
out. Many a man has drowned himself and hoss by pullin' his hoss over.
If you're lost in a blizzard, give your cayuse his head he'll take you
to shelter it's hard to lose an animal.</p>

<p>"In the dark, don't spur a hoss where he don't want to go. There's
lots of times a hoss knows more than a man. A man that says a hoss
don't know nothin' don't know much about hosses."</p>

<h3><a name="ch3-2"></a>THE HORSE</h3>

<p>"I read in the papers a while back where there's seventy thousand
wild hosses on the ranges of Montana," says Rawhide Rawlins. "They say
these animals are a menace to stockmen. Mebbe this is right, but I
think it would bother this old state to round up that many tame
ones.</p>

<p>"A few years ago a hoss was considered kind of handy to have around.
He was needed everywhere and used all ways. Up hill or down, mud or
dust, he worked. They made no good roads for him. There's not a city in
mighty near the whole world he didn't help build. There's a few
ice-bound countries where the hoss don't live, and in these same lands
it ain't easy for humans to live.</p>

<p>"This last war was a machine-made hell, but I doubt if it could have
been win without hosses, an' the same kind that some folks say is a
menace to men now. There was thousands of branded hosses died with our
fighters on the other side. The range hoss was God-made, an' like all
of His makin', the best. These hosses cost the man that branded an'
claimed 'em nothing. They lived on the grass an' water the Almighty
gave 'em.</p>

<p>"Many thousand years ago, when folks was all a-foot, lizards, horned
toads, an' bullfrogs measured from thirty to a hundred feet in length
an' stood from forty to sixty hands. Besides these, there was tigers
and laffin' hyenas that would eat an elephant for breakfast. From what
I've read, in the days I'm talkin' about man wasn't much, an' he sure
lived simple. A good, stout cave was his home. He fed mostly on bugs
an' snails, an' a grasshopper that happened to 'light anywhere near him
or his family was out of luck. Sometimes some real game gent would slip
out with his stone tomahawk an' bring back a skunk or two. Then's when
they pulled a regular feed, but there wasn't no set date for these
feasts, an' they mostly came far apart. With a hyena that weighed seven
ton a-laffin' around the door, man loved his home, an' Maw never
worried about where Paw was.</p>

<p>"But one day one of these old home-livers was sunnin' himself an'
layin' for a grasshopper, when he looks down from his ledge to the
valley below where all these animals is busy eatin' one another, an'
notices one species that don't take no part in this feast, but can
out-run an' out-dodge all others. This cave man is progressive, an' has
learned to think. He sees this animal is small compared to the rest,
an' ain't got no horns, tusks or claws, eatin' nothin' but grass.
There's other grass-eaters, but they all wear horns that don't look
good to Mister Cave Man.</p>

<p>"He remembers when his Maw used to pack him on her back. Bein' a
lazy gent he's lookin' for somethin' easy, an' he figgers that if he
could get this hornless animal under him, he could ride once more like
he did in his childhood. Right then is when man starts thinkin' of
somethin' besides eatin'.</p>

<p>"Not far from the cave there's a trail where herds of hosses come to
water, so one day Mister Man climbs into a tree that hangs over the
trail, an' with a grapevine loop he snares one of these animals. But he
finds out that though this beast ain't got horns or claws, he's mighty
handy with all four feet, and when Paw sneaks home that evenin' he's
got hoof marks all over him an' he ain't had a ride yet. Sore as he is,
he goes back next day an' tries again. About the sixth day this poor
hoss is so starved that Mister Man gets up to him, an' tyin' a strip of
bark to his under jaw an' another around his belly, he steps across the
hoss. The bronc sinks his head an' goes in the air. Mister Man stays,
but he breaks all the rules in a ridin' contest of to-day. He don't
pull leather, but tears all the mane out from ears to withers, an' that
bark hand-hold of his is all that keeps the hoss from unloadin' him. A
few days later his bronc is plumb gentle. Paw mounts, goes out an' with
a stone-headed spear kills a wild cow, an' he comes back to the cave
with the hide an' more meat than the folks ever seen before. The family
is so pleased with this useful pet that they bring him in the cave
nights, an' all get busy pullin' grass for him."</p>

<p>"Mister Man finds that with four legs under him instead of two, he
can ride rings around them big lizards, an' there ain't any of them
claw-wearin', tusk-bearin' critters can overtake him. The old gent
snares more hosses, an' it ain't long till the whole family's
hoss-back. When this bunch starts out, armed an' mounted, they sure
bring home the bacon. Meat I'd tell a man. This cave looks an' smells
like a packin' plant before the pure food law. It's now mankind sheds
the leaf garments of old Granddad Adam an' starts wearin' new

<p>"Paw's wearin' a head-an'-tail cowskin; the boys has a yearlin' robe
apiece. Maw an' the girls wouldn't be in style at all these days. Mebbe
it's modesty it might be the chill in the weather but they're sure
covered from ears to heels in deer an' elk skins, an' from that day to
just lately man never knowed whether his sweetheart was knock-kneed or
bow-legged.</p>

<p>"Since that old bug-eater snared that first cayuse, his descendants
have been climbin', an' the hoss has been with 'em. It was this animal
that took 'em from a cave. For thousands of years the hoss an' his
long-eared cousins furnished all transportation on land for man an'
broke all the ground for their farmin'. He has helped build every
railroad in the world. Even now he builds the roads for the automobile
that has made him nearly useless, an' I'm here to tell these
machine-lovers that it will take a million years for the gas wagon to
catch up with the hoss in what he's done for man. To-day some of these
auto drivers want to kill him off to make fertilizer out of his body.
Mebbe I'm sentimental, but I think it's a damned hard finish for one
that has been as good a friend to man as the hoss"</p>

<h3><a name="ch3-3"></a>TOMMY SIMPSON'S COW</h3>

<p>"In the old days the sight of a cow follered by more than one calf
is apt to cause comment among cowpeople," says Rawhide Rawlins. "But
times have changed, an' it looks like new improvements has come in the
stock business along with dry farmin' an' prohibition. Not all these
modern ideas is hatched up on this side of the water, though. Tommy
Simpson's prize cow proves that.</p>

<p>"The other day I'm ridin' on Box Elder Creek, when I'm surprised to
see a cow that's got five calves follerin' her, all wearin' Tommy
Simpson's brand. Tommy's an old-timer in the cattle business, so I
figger he'll have some interestin' explanation to make of this miracle.
I'm still ponderin' over it when I ride into the town of Fife, which
Tommy has named after the village in Scotland that he's run out of as a
youth for poachin'. Enterin' the store there, who do I see but the
owner of the cow an' five calves. I presently remark that's sure some
cow of his.</p>

<p>"Tommy, with both jowls loaded with Climax, as usual, is speechless,
until he opens the stove door an' nearly puts the fire out. Then,
gettin' his breath, he explains that the cow has been sent to him from
the Highlands of Scotland by his grandfather. The animal, he says,
comes to this country in charge of a cousin of Tommy.</p>

<p>"It appears that Tommy's cousin, with thrift that's characteristic
of the family, drives a sharp bargain with the captain of the sailin'
ship in which he engages passage from Strachlachan, which is not far
from Ballochantry, somewhere north of the Firth of Galway. Tommy's
cousin agrees to furnish milk and cream to the ship's crew an'
twenty-three passengers, if they'll let him an' the cow travel on a
pass. This suits the captain. On the way over, the cow is milked
evenin' an' mornin' by Tommy's cousin an' the members of the larboard
watch. How Tommy's cousin an' the cow beat their way from New York to
Montana, I never hear.</p>

<p>"Accordin' to Tommy, cows of this breed ain't uncommon in the Scotch
Highlands. They're built somewhat along the lines of the lady pig.
Tommy says it's an interestin' sight, after the cow gets to his ranch,
for the neighbors to watch Tommy and several hired men milk the Scotch
cow. The milk from the off side supplies the Fife creamery with butter
fat, while that from the near side of the cow nourishes her half-dozen
calves.</p>

<p>"Tommy tells me that in Scotland, where these cows eat the
nutritious heather, the center bag gives pure cream, the rear one
buttermilk, an' the forward one skim milk, so they don't need no
separator."</p>

<h3><a name="ch3-4"></a>HANDS UP!</h3>

<p>Jack Shea tells one time about being held up. It was in Colorado,
and he's travelin' on a coach. There's five passengers, and one of them
is a middle-aged woman. There's been a lot of stick-up men on this
road, and this old lady is worried. She's got fifty dollars, and she's
tryin' to get to her daughter somewhere up North. This fifty is all
she's got, and if she loses it she's on the rocks.</p>

<p>"There's an old man in the bunch that's got all the earmarks of a
cowman," says Shea. "He tells her to stick her roll under the cushions,
and slips her a couple of dollars, sayin' that it will pacify these
road robbers.</p>

<p>"We ain't gone five mile when the coach stops sudden and a gent
outside says, 'Step out, folks, an' keep your hands up while you're
doin' it.' We all know what we're up against and ain't slow gettin'
out. There's one gent at the leaders, got the driver and the outside
passenger covered; another that's waitin' for us. They're both wearin'
blinds and heeled till they look nasty. This stick-up seems to know the
old cowman and speaks to him. The old man steps out of line and
whispers something to him. None of us get any of his talk, but when the
hold-up gets through trimmin' us he reaches into the coach, flips the
cushion, and grabs the old lady's roll. Then we all return to our seats
and the hold-up gives the driver his orders and the coach pulls
out."</p>

<center>
<p><a name="trails-36"></a><img alt="" src=
"0700941h-images/0700941h-36.jpg"></p>

<p><b>A STICK-UP ON THE ROAD</b></p>
</center>

<p>"We're all trimmed; the old lady's cryin', and the rest of us ain't
sayin' much, but we're doin' lots of thinkin'. From what we get, it
looks like the old cowman stands in with the hold-ups. He's tellin' the
lady not to take it so hard. When one of the passengers wants to know
what the low talk is between him and the stick-up, the cowman don't
turn a hair but tells us all he double-crossed the lady; that he tells
this hold-up that twenty dollars is his bank roll, but if he'll pass
him up he knows where there's fifty. The hold-up agrees, and he tips
off the old lady's cash to protect himself. He tells it like he ain't
ashamed, and finishes, sayin', 'If you don't take care of yourself,
nobody else will.'</p>

<p>"This talk makes the whole bunch wolfy. The passenger that's doin'
the talkin' is for stoppin' the coach, and if there's a rope there'll
be a hangin'. 'We don't need no rope; what's the matter with a lead
rein? If he's as light in pounds as he is in principle, we'll slip a
boulder in his pants to give him weight. This skunk is dirtier than
airy hold-up on the road, and the sooner we pull this party, the better
it suits me.'</p>

<p>"We're gettin' worked up on all this talk when the cowman that ain't
turned a hair, says, 'If you gentlemen will let me play my hand out
you'd find out who wins, but if you're bound to, go through with this
hangin'.'</p>

<p>"By this time, the old lady's beggin' for the cowman. She don't want
to see him strung up, but thinks jail is strong enough. But these
passengers are frothin' at the mouth, and it sure looks like the
cowman's end is near. The driver has heard the story and stopped.</p>

<p>"'Well,' says the old man, 'if you're bound to hang me and he don't
scare worth a dam' I'll slip my boots. I've been a gambler all my
life,' says he, draggin' off his right boot, 'but none of you
shorthorns ever was; you never played nothin' but solitaire. This lady
stakes me to fifty,' says he, 'and I always split my winnin's in the
middle with them that stakes me.' And takin' a thousand dollars he's
got tucked in his sock, he counts off five one-hundred-dollar bills,
and hands them to the lady. 'That's yours,' says he.</p>

<p>"Nobody says nothin'. The old lady's shakin' hands, and, between
sobs, thankin' this old cross-roader. Somebody tells the driver to
drive on, and we're just pullin' into town when the man that's strong
for hangin' pulls a pint from his hip and says, 'To show you there's no
hard feelin's, we'll all take a drink barrin' the lady.' When the
bottle comes back to its owner, it's near dry, but before he empties
it, he says, 'Here's to the gambler that pays his stakes!' Then he
empties her and throws her out the window, and we all shake hands."</p>

<h3><a name="ch3-5"></a>MORMON ZACK, FIGHTER</h3>

<p>"I see Mormon Zack's in the hospital with a bad front foot. This
bein' crippled ain't nothin' strange for the Mormon," said Rawhide
Rawlins, as he pulled the makin's out of his coat pocket and started
rollin' one.</p>

<p>"If I knowed the story of every scar he's got, I could hand the
people a history that would make a lot of the scraps the Kaiser lost
look like a prayer meetin'. My knowledge of history's a little hazy,
but knowin' Zack came from Norway and judgin' from his actions, he's a
come-back of some of them old fightin' Norsemen. You might lick him,
but you can't keep him licked, and he fights as well underneath as he
does on top.</p>

<p>"The first time I see Zack I'm a kid, helpin' throw up a log shack
on the Judith River. There's a feller rides up with an Injun hoss under
him. He's sittin' in an old-fashioned low-horn saddle with 'doghouse'
stirrups. In dress he's wearin' the garments of a breed moccasins and
beaded buckskin leggin's that come to the knees. In his ca'tridge belt
is a skinnin' knife, an' across the front of him lays a Winchester in a
fringed an' beaded skin gun-cover. One of the men that's with me tells
me that's Mormon Zack."</p>

<p><b>"HE'S WEARIN' THE GARMENTS OF A BREED"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"That'll soon be 40 years ago. At that time there's still a lot of
Injun trade in the country, an' that's the Mormon's business. The first
time I knowed of Zack gettin' warlike is a little while after this at
Reed's fort, a tradin' post near where Lewistown stands to-day. It's
run by Reed and Bowles."</p>

<center>
<p><a name="trails-38"></a><img alt="" src=
"0700941h-images/0700941h-38.jpg"></p>

<p><b>"THERE'S STILL A LOT OF INDIAN TRADE IN THE COUNTRY"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"There's about 200 lodges of Piegans come to the post for trade.
Bowles don't happen to be there, as he's gone to Benton to get whiskey.
While he's off gettin' this wet goods, Zack an' his partner comes along
and make a trade, an' when Bowles arrives there ain't as much as a
skunk skin left among them Piegans. They're traded down to a
breech-clout.</p>

<p>"This don't make Bowles pleasant to get along with, an' he starts
fillin' up on this trade whiskey. This is the booze that made the
jack-rabbit spit in a wolf's eye.</p>

<p>"As I said before, Bowles fills up an' starts tellin' Zack how much
he thinks of him, an' the talk Zack comes back with ain't very genteel.
Zack's standin' pretty close, for all the time they're talkin' he's
onto Bowles' hole-card. He knows this hog-leg that's hangin' on Bowles'
hip ain't no watch-charm, so to avoid any misunderstanding Zack hands
Bowles one on the chin, knockin' him from under his hat. He's near
bein' too late, for Bowles has already reached for his barker an' just
when Zack's reachin' his jaw she speaks out loud, the ball nearly
tearin' Zack's hind leg off at the hip.</p>

<p>"Bowles don't come to till next day, an' then he wants to know which
hoss kicked him. Zack's worse off, as there ain't no doctor nearer than
Benton. Of course, there's a medicine man in the Piegan camp, but Zack
ain't Injun enough to believe that this red doctor can beat a tom-tom
an' sing his leg together, so he forks a hoss an' pulls for the
steamboat town. This little incident don't seem to take none of the
fight out of Zack, an' he wins an' loses a few battles down there while
he's healin' up.</p>

<p>"It's a few years later Zack comes near crossin' the range, when he
mixes with a fighter in Benton. The battle's Zack's from the start,
till the other fellow cheats by drawin' a knife, an' slippin' it to
Zack's flank he walks clean around him, leavin' Zack with nothin'
holdin' him up but his backbone. His friends help him gather up the
loose ends, and gettin' a doctor with a sackin' needle, he's soon
patched up again.</p>

<p>"Another time Zack fights a feller all day. Of course they stop for
drinks an' feed. There really ain't no hard feelins'; they're just
tryin' to find out which is the best man. They'd a-been fightin' yet,
but their eyes swelled shut at last an' they couldn't find one
another.</p>

<p>"There was one town Zack was doubtful of, an' that was Bull Hook. In
them days this burg held the pennant for fighters.</p>

<p>"Zack had been cookin' on the Teton roundup, an' when they break up
that fall he jumps a train headed east. He's got quite a bankroll, and
a friend stakes him to a quart that ain't grape juice. He's figurin' on
winterin' in some of the towns along the road, so when the train stops
at this town of Bull Hook, or Havre as they call it now, he steps off
to get the air an' size up the citizens.</p>

<p>"As I was sayin', this town in the old days was the home of most of
the fighters of the Northwest. Zack picks out the biggest, hardest one
in sight, an' walkin' up friendly like, hands him one in the jaw with
every pound he's got. With this the ball opens, but it don't last long,
an' Zack's hit him everywhere when the big feller hollers 'enough.'</p>

<p>"Then the stranger wants to know what it's all about, and asks Zack
to introduce himself an' explain, just out of curiosity, what's his
reason for tearin' into him. Zack tells him there's no hard feelin's
an' it ain't no old grudge he's workin' off, but he kind of figured on
winterin' in Bull Hook, an' hearin' they're all fighters there, he
thinks this is the best way of introducin' himself.</p>

<p>"I picked the biggest one among you,' says the Mormon. 'If I'd
a-lose, I was goin' on to Chinook, but seein' I win, I'll winter with
you.' An' he did.</p>

<p>"Although Zack's a natural scrapper, like many of his kind he has
plenty of good traits, is good-hearted, an' I never knowed him to jump
on a weakling; it was always a man who claimed to be a fighter, too.
Zack belonged to his time, an' it was his kind and not the reformers
that made Montana. These last came with the tumbleweed."</p>

<p><b>COW HORSE PULLING CALF</b></p>
</center>

<h3><a name="ch3-6"></a>FINGER THAT KILLS WINS HIS SQUAW</h3>

<p>"That story that Dad Lane tells the other night 'bout his compadre
getting killed off, sure shows the Injun up," says 'Squaw' Owens.
"Injuns is born bushwhackers; they believe in killin' off their enemy
an' ain't particular how it's done, but prefer gettin' him from cover,
an' I notice some of their white brothers play the same way. You watch
these old gun-fighters an' you'll see most of 'em likes a shade the
start in a draw; there's many a man that's fell under the smoke of a
forty-five drawn from a sneak that ain't lookin' when he got it.</p>

<p>"I've had plenty experience amongst Injuns, an' all the affection I
got for 'em wouldn't make no love story, but with all their tricks an'
treachery I call them a game people. It's their religion to die without
a whimper; in olden times when a prisoner's took, there's no favors
asked or given. He's up agin it. It's a sure case of cash in skinned
alive, cooked over a slow fire, or some such pleasant trail to the
huntin'-ground an' all Mister Prisoner does is to take his medicine
without whinin'. If he makes any talk it's to tell ye you're a green
hand at the business; of course he don't cuss none, he don't know how.
That art belongs to civilized folks, but an Injun's got a string of
names to call ye that'll do till something better comes along. They
sure talk scandalous about you an' your relations.</p>

<p>"Talkin' about an Injun's nerve reminds me of an old buck I run onto
on the Blackfoot Reserve a few years ago. I'm ridin' for the Flyin' O;
this outfit's fillin' a beef contract, an' throwin' steers into the
Agency near where we're holdin' the beef on Two Medicine,
close-herdin'."</p>

<p><b>BLACKFEET</b></p>
</center>

<p>"There's an old Injun comes visitin' our camp, an' after he feeds
once you can bet on him showin' up 'bout noon every day. If there's a
place where an Injun makes a hand, it's helpin' a neighbor hide grub,
an' they ain't particular about quality it's quantity they want. Uncle
Sam's Injuns average about one good meal a week; nobody's got to graze
this way long till a tin plate loaded with beans looks like a Christmas
dinner.</p>

<p>"This old buck takes a great likin' to me an' the chuck wagon, an'
as I can talk some Blackfoot we get right sociable. I get this talk
from a 'Live Dictionary' the year before, when I wintered up on Old
Man's River; that is, I marry a Blood woman. When I say marry, I traded
her pa two ponies an' a Winchester, an' in accordance with all Injun's
law we're necked all right. Of course I furnish grub an' material to
her relations for a tea dance to make the weddin' fashionable."</p>

<p><b>A BLACKFOOT WOMAN</b></p>
</center>

<p>"But our married life ain't joyful I sure kick on that cookin', for
there ain't enough Injun in me to like it.</p>

<p>"Thinkin' to civilize her a little, I buy her a white woman's rig at
McLeod, an' when she slips this on I'm damned if you can tell which way
she's travelin'.</p>

<p>"We ain't been married a week till I've learned enough of the talk
to call her all the names known to Blackfeet, an' by spring we can pull
off nearly as good a quarrel as civilized folks in harness. When grass
comes we separate; there's no divorce needed, as we're both willin', so
we split the blankets; she pulls for camp, an' I drift south.</p>

<p>"But this old buck I started to tell ye about Finger-That Kills is
his name is all Injun from his moccasins up. If it ain't for his calico
shirt an' leggin's an' clout bein' made of blanket instead of skin,
he's dressed like he'd be a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>"The first day he shows up I notice he's shy three fingers on his
right hand, leavin' nothin' but his thumb an' trigger finger. Now he
don't look to me like he's ever railroaded or worked in a sawmill, an'
of course I'm curious to know who worked him over. So one day I'm
layin' in the shade of my hoss on herd, when old Finger-That-Kills
rides up on his little pinto whittledig for a visit. It's then I ask
him how he gets trimmed up. He don't say nothin' for a long time, but
goes to gazin' off on the prairie like he's lookin' for somethin'. Now
folks that don't know Injuns 'ud think he don't hear me, but I heap
savvy he's reachin' back in his history for the yarn I want.</p>

<p>"The only book he's got is these old prairies, but it's open to him
an' he knows every leaf in her; I tell you, fellers, she sure holds
good yarns for them that can read her.</p>

<p>"Finally he shakes out his black stone pipe, an' layin' her down,
opens up on his yarn.</p>

<p>"My cousin, it's a long way behind me,' says he, drawin' his
crippled hand slow from his left, out in front of him an' back over his
shoulder, which means in signs 'very long.'</p>

<p>"Forty times I've seen the snow come an' go since I took my first
war-trail. I was then young an' my heart was strong.'</p>

<p>"Now I can't give it to you as flowery as this Injun does, 'cause
these people are sure pretty with talk, but as I interpret it he's
'bout nineteen the age the Reds begin lookin' for a mate when he starts
ridin' 'round on a painted pony an' puttin' in his time lookin' pretty.
When a bunch of young squaws is down gettin' water, he accidentally
rides through the creek, givin' them a chance to admire him. He's
ablaze with paint an' feathers to hear him tell it he's rigged out so
it hurts your eyes to look at him, an' it ain't hard to imagine, 'cause
I've seen young bucks stripped to the clout an' moccasins, painted till
they're sure gaudy.</p>

<p>"Well, he finally sees the one he's lookin' for; she's as pretty as
a painted wagon an' loves him right back. Now some folks think Injuns
don't have love scrapes, but don't ever believe it. There's many a
squaw that leaves camp with a rawhide under her blanket, an' next day
she's found hangin' in a cottonwood all because she can't get the buck
she wants. An' the bucks are just as locoed in their way.</p>

<p>"Well, as I said before, Finger-That-Kills is sure warmed on this
squaw; they're both willin', but he ain't got the price. He's shy on
ponies, as her old dad's holdin' her for fifteen an' he's only got
five, so it's a case of steal hosses or lose the girl.</p>

<p>"It's spring an' time for the Sun-Dance, so when that's pulled off
he takes a hand an' goes through all right. Shortly after, there's a
war-party starts for the Crow country, an' he's among 'em; there's
fifteen, all afoot an' travelin' light stealin' parties generally goes
this way. Each man's packin' his bundle of moccasins, dried meat, a
rawhide rope an' weepons mostly bows, as guns is scarce them days; the
ones they've got is flintlocks that go off whenever they feel like
it.</p>

<p>"They travel many sleeps with nothin' happenin' except runnin' low
on meat, but that's nothin' no Injun's supposed to get hungry on a
war-trip. Finally they run clean out of pemmican, an' they're gettin'
ga'nt an' wolfy. There's plenty of game, but they can't hunt, bein'
afoot, an' it's pretty ticklish work disturbin' buffalo in the enemy's
country. There's no tellin' what butte holds a red sentinel wrapped to
the eyes in his robe. You can't see him, but he's there, still as a
sleepin' snake. He don't need no bring-'em-close glasses; nature's give
him a couple of beady blinkers that ain't wore none by readin', an'
what they overlook ain't worth huntin' up.</p>

<p>"He sees the herd way yonder in the open; maybe there's a couple of
bulls locked horns to one side, or one gougin' out a waller. The herd
may be trailin' in to water, leavin' long strings of dust. These
maneuvers don't excite him none, but let 'em start runnin', millin', or
churnin', an' he's sure interested, for there ain't but one animal
that'll cause these brown grass-eaters to act up that away and that
animal walks on hind legs an' ain't haired over.</p>

<p>"This lookout heap savvys, an' you can bet he ain't slow at
signalin'. He's got several ways of telegraphin', accordin' to time an'
weather. If the sun's right, it's a lookin' glass; if it's too windy
for smoke, it's a blanket or robe, an' at night, a fire. An' it's
surprisin' how quick he'll change that quiet, peaceful scene. Before
you know it the country's swarmin' with painted, feathered
hair-hunters, an' hell's poppin'. Of course the Blackfeet know all this
an' they're mighty cautious.</p>

<p>"They're nearin' the Crow country, travelin' nights, 'mostly. One
mornin' just breakin' day, Finger-That-Kills is sneakin' along ahead of
his party kind of advance scout. He's sure hungry, his belt's cinched
to its last hole, an' he can't think of nothin' but eatin', when of a
sudden he stumbles right onto a big bull. This old buffalo's got three
wolves around him; he's hamstrung an' down behind, but he's whirlin'
'round an' makin' a good stand-off with his horns. When Mister Injun
walks up, these wolves go slinkin' off, makin' faces at him; they don't
like bein' busted in on at meal-times.</p>

<p>"With a couple of arrows Finger-That-Kills finishes the bull, but
before touchin' the meat, holdin' up his hands, he thanks the sun,
who's just peepin' over the sky-line. You may not know it, but all
Injuns is great people to give thanks to their God.</p>

<p>"Then he cuts in an' gets the liver; Redskins are sure fond of this,
raw an' warm. He's so busy fillin' up that he gets careless; there's a
flock of sage hens comes sailin' over that disturbs his meal, an' the
next thing he knows three Injuns comes yelpin' down on him, quirtin'
their ponies at every jump.</p>

<p>"Now there's a bunch of cottonwoods not far from where he's sittin'
that looks mighty handy, so he hits the breeze, not runnin' straight,
but sidewindin', duckin', an' dodgin' like a grouse-hen tollin' ye from
her nest.</p>

<p>"He's a hard mark, but he ain't made three of these curves till a
trade ball goes plowin' up under his scalp an' he turns over on his
face as dead as he'll ever be, for a minute. When he comes to, the
strangers are down off their ponies, jokin' an' laughin'. Of course
Finger-That-Kills don't see the humor; he's playin' dead for all
there's in it. They're Gros Ventres he knows this by the few words he
savvys of their guttural tongue. He feels the hand of his enemy twisted
in his scalp-lock, an' it ain't no guess with him that he'll be losing
some hair shortly. He is layin' face down, his right hand's stretched
out along the ground, his left doubled under him. Bein' a dandy an' a
leader of fashion, he wears jewelry regardless, an' his hands are
loaded to the knuckles with brass trade rings.</p>

<p>"The Gros Ventre's eye for finery is caught by this glitter, an'
droppin' the hair he reaches for the jeweled hand, first tryin' to slip
the rings. But they're tight, so takin' his knife he begins hackin' the
fingers off."</p>

<p>"The minute these Big Bellies see they're outnumbered, they crawl
their ponies an' bust the breeze; havin' hosses the best of it, they
make a clean get-away. Finger-That-Kills is glad he's livin' an's got
his hair, but he's sure sore 'bout losin' those rings.</p>

<p>"This little trouble don't stop the Blackfeet. They reach the Crows
all right, an' come back with two hundred stolen ponies.</p>

<p>"Of course Finger-That-Kills gets his squaw all right, but this
don't end his love scrapes, for an Injun with one wife is a tolerable
poor husband. These people set no limit to matrimony, an' count wealth
by squaws an' bosses.</p>

<p>"'How does it feel,' says I, 'when that Gros Ventre's trimmin'
you?'</p>

<p>"The Big Belly's lazy; his knife's dull very dull. The dogeater's
foolish like a squaw when he leaves me this,' says he, smilin' an'
holdin' up his lone finger. 'For this one has killed two Big Bellies
for every one of his dead brothers, an' their scalps have long dried in
the lodge of the Finger-That-Kills.'"</p>

<h3><a name="ch3-7"></a>DOG EATER</h3>

<p>"A man that ain't never been hungry can't tell nobody what's good to
eat," says Rawhide Rawlins. "I eat raw sow bosom and frozen biscuit
when it tasted like a Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>"Bill Gurd tells me he's caught one time. He's been ridin' since
daybreak and ain't had a bite. It's plumb dark when he hits a breed's
camp. This old breed shakes hands and tells Bill he's welcome, so after
strippin' his saddle and hobblin' his hoss, he steps into the shack.
Being wolf hungry, he notices the old woman's cooking bannocks at the
mud fire. Tired and hungry like Bill is, the warmth and the smell of
grub makes this cottonwood shack, that ain't much more than a
windbreak, look like a palace.</p>

<p>"Tain't long till the old woman hands him a tin plate loaded with
stew and bannocks, with hot tea for a chaser. He don't know what kind
of meat it is but he's too much of a gentleman to ask. So he don't look
a gift hoss in the mouth. After he fills up, while he's smokin', the
old man spreads down some blankets and Bill beds down.</p>

<p>"Next mornin' he gets the same for breakfast. Not being so hungry,
he's more curious, but don't ask no questions. On the way out to catch
his hoss he gets an answer. A little ways from the cabin, he passes a
fresh dog hide pegged down on the ground. It's like seeing the
hole-card it's no gamble what that stew was made of, but it was good
and Bill held it.</p>

<p>"I knowed another fellow one time that was called Dog Eatin' Jack. I
never knowed how he got his name that's hung to him, till I camp with
him. This old boy is a prospector and goes gopherin' 'round the hills,
hopin' he'll find something.</p>

<p>"I'm huntin' hosses one spring and ain't found nothing but tracks.
I'm up on the Lodgepole in the foothills; it's sundown and my hoss has
went lame. We're limping along slow when I sight a couple of hobbled
cayuses in a beaver meadow. One of these hosses is wearing a Diamond G
iron, the other's a Quarter-Circle-Block hoss. They're both old cow
ponies. I soon locate their owner's camp it's a lean-to in the edge of
the timber.</p>

<p>"While I'm lookin' over the layout, here comes the owner. It's the
Dog Eater. After we shake hands I unsaddle and stake out my tired hoss.
When we're filled up on the best he's got which is beans, bacon, and
frying pan bread, which is good filling for hungry men we're sittin'
smokin', and it's then I ask him if he ever lived with Injuns.</p>

<p>"You're thinkin',' says he, 'about my name. It does sound like
Injun, but they don't hang it on me. It happens about ten winters ago.
I'm 'way back in the Diamond range; I've throwed my hosses about ten
mile out in the foothills where there's good feed and less snow. I
build a lean-to, a good one, and me and my dog settles down. There's
some beaver here and I got out a line of traps and figger on winterin'
here. Ain't got much grub, but there's lots of game in the hills and my
old needle gun will get what the traps won't.</p>

<p>"Snow comes early and lots of it. About three days after the storm I
step on a loose boulder and sprain my ankle. This puts me plumb out; I
can't more than keep my fire alive. All the time I'm running short of
grub. I eat a couple of skinned beaver I'd throwed away one day. My old
dog brings in a snowshoe rabbit to camp and maybe you don't think he's
welcome. I cut in two with him but manlike, I give him the front end.
That's the last we got.</p>

<p>"Old Friendship that's the dog's name goes out every day, but he
don't get nothing and I know he ain't cheating he's too holler in the
flanks. After about four days of living on thoughts, Friendship starts
watchin' like he's afraid. He thinks maybe I'll put him in the pot, but
he sizes me up wrong. If I'd do that, I hope I choke to death.</p>

<p>"The sixth day I'm sizin' him up. He's laying near the fire. He's a
hound with a long meaty tail. Says I to myself, 'Oxtail soup! What's
the matter with dog tail?' He don't use it for nothing but sign talk,
but it's like cutting the hands off a dummy. But the eighth day, with
hunger and pain in my ankle, I plumb locoed and I can't get that dog's
tail out of my mind. So, a little before noon I slip up on him, while
he's sleeping, with the ax. In a second it's all over, Friendship goes
yelpin' into the woods and I am sobbin' like a kid, with his tail in my
hand."</p>

<p><b>"FRIENDSHIP GOES YELPIN' INTO THE WOODS"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"The water is already boiling in the pot, an' as soon as I singe the
hair off it's in the pot. I turned a couple of flour sacks inside out
and dropped them in and there's enough flour to thicken the soup. It's
about dark. I fill up, and if it weren't for thinkin' it would have
been good. I could have eat it all but I held out over half for
Friendship, in case he come back.</p>

<p>"It must be midnight when he pushes into the blankets with me. I
take him in my arms. He's as cold as a dead snake, and while I'm
holdin' him tight I'm crying like a baby. After he warms up a little, I
get up and throw some wood on the fire and call Friendship to the pot.
He eats every bit of it. He don't seem to recognize it. If he does,
being a dog, he forgives.</p>

<p>"We go back to the blankets. It's just breaking day when he slides
out, whinin' and sniffin' the air with his ears cocked and his bloody
stub wobblin'. I look the way he's pointin', and not twenty-five yards
from the lean-to stands a big elk. There's a fine snow fallin'; the
wind's right for us. I ain't a second gettin' my old needle gun, but
I'm playin' safe I'm coming Injun on him. I use my ram-rod for a rest.
When old needle speaks, the bull turns over his neck's broken. 'Tain't
long till we both get to that bull and we're both eatin' raw, warm
liver. I've seen Injuns do this but I never thought I was that much
wolf, but it was sure good that morning.</p>

<p>"He's a big seven-point bull old and pretty tough, but me and
Friendship was looking for quantity, not quality, and we got it. That
meat lasted till we got out.'</p>

<p>"What became of Friendship?' says I.</p>

<p>"He died two years ago,' says Jack. 'But he died fat."</p>

<h3><a name="ch3-8"></a>HOW LINDSAY TURNED INDIAN</h3>

<p>"Most folks don't bank much on squaw-men, but I've seen some mighty
good ones doubled up with she-Injuns," says Dad Lane. "Ain't you,
Owens?"</p>

<p>"I told you my short experience with that Blood woman; I wasn't a
successful Injun, but the comin' of white women to the country's made
big changes; men's got finicky about matin'. I guess if I'd come to the
country earlier, squaws would a-looked good enough, an' if there wasn't
nothin' but Injun women, it's a cinch that all married men would be
wearin' moccasins. There's a whole lot of difference livin' with Injuns
now an' when the buffalo were thick; the savages owned the country
then.</p>

<p>"When I'm ridin' line for the H-half-H, my camp's on the border of
the Piegan Reserve. Of course I gets lots of visits from my red
brothers. Among 'em is an old squaw-man named Lindsay. He's white all
right, but you'd have to be a good guesser to call the turn. Livin' so
long with Injuns, he's got all their ways an' looks. Can't talk without
usin' his hands. His white hair's down over his shoulder an' his
wrinkled face is hairless. By the holes punched in his ears I know he's
wore rings sometimes. He packs a medicine-bag, all same savage.</p>

<p>"From his looks an' the dates he gives me, he's crowdin' eighty
winters. This old boy could string the best war and buffalo yarns I
ever heard. It's like readin' a romance; any time he calls I'm sure of
a good yarn.</p>

<p>"I remember one day we're sittin' outside the shack, clear of the
eaves. There's a Chinook blowing an' the roof's drippin' like it's
rainin'. It's mighty pleasant in the sun out of the wind. This old
breeze is cuttin' the snow off the hills in a way that's a blessin' to
cows an' cowmen. The country's been hid for six weeks, an' if the
Chinook hadn't come, cowmen would needed skinnin'-knives instead of
brandin'-irons.</p>

<p>"As I said before, we're sittin' outside enjoyin' the change; the
white Injun's smokin' his mixture of willow bark an' tobacco, while I'm
sizin' him up, an' somehow I can't help but pity him. Here's an old man
as white as I am. No doubt he's been a great man with these savages,
but he's nothin' or nobody to his own blood or color. While I'm
thinkin' about him in this way he starts mumblin' to himself in Injun.
I don't savvy only part of it, so I ask him what it's all about. He
says he's talkin' to the sun; he's thankin' him for the warm wind that
melts the snow.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe in God?' says I.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' says he.</p>

<p>"'What kind of a one?'</p>

<p>"That one,' says he, pintin' with his staff to the sun. 'The one I
can see an' have watched work for many years. He gathers the clouds an'
makes it rain; then warms the ground an' the grass turns green. When
it's time he dries it yellow, makin' it good winter feed for
grass-eaters.</p>

<p>"Again, when he's mad, my people say he drives the rain away, dryin'
up the streams an' water-holes. If it wasn't for him there couldn't
nothin' or nobody live. Do you wonder that we pray him to be good an'
thank him when he is? I'm all Injun but my hide; their God's my God,
an' I don't ask for no better.'</p>

<p>"However did you come to throw in with these savages in the
start-off?' says I.</p>

<p>"Well, boys, I'll tell you how it happened,' says he, signin' for a
match, an' lightin' up fresh, he starts off.</p>

<p>"There used to be lots of white Injuns like me what you'd call
squaw-men, but I've outlived the most of 'em. Some got civilized,
throwed away their red women an' took white ones, but I've been too
long in the Piegan camp to change, an', nearin' the end o' the road
like I am, I guess I'll finish with the red ones.</p>

<p>"It's the women that make the men in this world, I heard an educated
feller say once, an' it's the truth that, if a man's goin' to hell or
heaven, if you look in the trail ahead of him you'll find a track the
same shape as his, only smaller; it's a woman's track. She's always
ahead, right or wrong, tollin' him on. In animals, the same as humans,
the female leads. That ain't the exact words this educated man uses,
but it's as near as I can interpret, an' it's the truth. If you ever
run buffalo, you'll notice the cow-meats in the lead. With wild hosses
the stallion goes herdin' them along, snakin' an' bowin' his neck, with
his tail flagged. From looks you'd call him chief, but the mares lead
to the water-hole they've picked out. An' I believe, if all women were
squaws, the whites would be wearin' clouts to-day.</p>

<p>"In early times when white men mixed with Injuns away from their own
kind, these wild women in their paint an' beads looked mighty enticin',
but to stand in with a squaw you had to turn Injun. She'd ask were your
relations all dead that you cut your hair? or was you afraid the
enemy'd get a hold an' lift it? at the same time givin' you the sign
for raisin' the scalp. The white man, if he liked the squaw, wouldn't
stand this joshin' long till he throwed the shears away, an' by the
time the hair reached his shoulders he could live without salt. He
ain't long forgettin' civilization. Livin' with Nature an' her people
this way, he goes backwards till he's a raw man, without any flavorin'.
In grade, he's a notch or two above a wolf, follerin' the herds for his
meat the same as his wild dog-brother. But, boy, I started to tell you
about myself.'</p>

<p>"An' this is about the way he strings it to me.</p>

<p>"He's born in St. Louis, at that time the outfittin'-place for all
fur trade south of the British line. His first remembrance, when he's a
youngster, is seein' traders in from their far-off, unknown country.
These long-haired fellers, some in fringed buckskin, others in
bright-colored blanket-clothes, strike the kid's fancy. There's
Frenchmen an' Breeds that's come down in boats loaded with buffalo an'
beaver hides, from the upper Missouri. From the Southwest comes the
Spanish an' Mexican traders, their hundreds of pack-mules loaded with
pelts. These men are still more gaudy, with silver braid an' buttons
from their broad sombreros to their six-inch rowels, all wearin'
bright-colored sashes an' serapis. Sometimes a band of Pawnees would
drift in from the plains, their faces painted an' heads shaved, barrin'
the scalplock."</p>

<p><b>"FROM THE SOUTHWEST COMES SPANISH AN' MEXICAN TRADERS"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"All these sights make this romantic kid restless, an' it wouldn't
take much to make him break away. So one day a tannin' he gets from his
step-dad gives him all the excuse he needs, an' bustin' home ties, he
quits the village as fast as his small feet an' shanks will pack him.
Follerin' the Mississippi he's mighty leg-weary an' hungry next mornin'
when he meets up with Pierre Chouteau's cordellers or boatmen. He tells
'em his story between whimpers an' tears, an' these big-hearted river
travelers feed him an' take him in.</p>

<p>"They're about the mouth of the Missouri when he overtakes 'em,
towin' north with goods for the Upper Missouri trade. This trip ain't
no picnic, but bein' a strong, healthy kid, he enjoys it. They pass the
dirt-lodge towns of the Mandans an' Rickarees, that look like overgrown
anthills, where the Injuns come to meet 'em in bowl-shaped bull-boats,
made of green buffalo hide stretched on willers. Many times they're
stopped by herds of buffalo crossin' the river. It's pretty smooth for
the kid, chorin' around an' herdin' bosses for the post, till one day
he falls asleep an' a war-party of Crows drop down an' get about half
of 'em. This makes the chief of the post hostile, an' he has Lindsay
licked. This old man tells me that the chiefs of tradin'-posts made
their own laws, an' when you broke one you had a floggin' comin'.
Sometimes men were shot or hung, accordin' to how serious the break
was. The lickin' he gets is too much for him, so he busts out an' makes
a get-away.</p>

<p>"There's about a hundred lodges of Piegans pullin' north, camped two
mile above the post. He finds out these Injuns will break camp about
daybreak. It's gettin' gray when he clears the stockade. On reachin'
the camp-ground he's mighty disappointed in findin' nothin' but the
dead ashes of their fires. He's afraid to go back to the post, an' the
Missouri lays between him an' the Injuns, so bein' desperate, he strips
his garments an' takes the water. Before startin' he ties his clothes
in a pack on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"The water's low an' don't require much swimmin', but nearin' the
bank on the fur side, an undercurrent catches him an' he loses his gun.
This old flintlock is mighty dear to him, but it's a case of lighten up
or go under, so he loosens his holt, hittin' the shore with nothin' but
a wet powder-horn an' a skinnin'-knife. The draggin' of hundreds of
travois an' lodge poles makes a trail as easy to foller as a wagon
road. About noon he reaches the rear guard. In them days Injuns
traveled, when in dangerous country, with advance, flank, an' rear
guard, their squaws, children, an' loose ponies in the centre. The
Piegans, bein' in the Sioux country, ain't takin' no chances.</p>

<p>"When he meets up with the rear guard they're down off their ponies,
figurin' on a smoke, but they've lost the steel an' there don't happen
to be a flintlock gun in this bunch. They're tryin' hard to get a light
by hackin' an old iron trade knife agin the flint. When Lindsay looms
up, Injun-like, they don't hardly notice him. These months around the
post, he's picked up considerable hand-talk, so signs 'em he'll light
their pipe. One old pock-marked buck, that's holdin' the pipe an' seems
to be chief, says, 'The boy is foolish, if he has no steel, to talk to
old men.'</p>

<p>"Lindsay don't make no back talk, but, walkin' up to the old man,
signs him to hold the bowl up; that the sun will make smoke. Then,
reachin' in his pouch, he pulls a sun-glass. As I says before, it's
about noon an' the sun's well up. It's one of them warm fall days, not
a cloud in the sky; this makes it easy for Lindsay, so holdin' the
glass above the bowl an' movin' her up an' down till he gets the focus,
an' holdin' her steady, it's not long before the little bright light
down in the bowl sends up a fine curl of smoke. The old Injun, seein'
this, takes a long draw, an' when they all see the smoke roll from the
old chief's nostrils they're plenty surprised, but don't show it none;
'tain't Injun nature. You could take one of these savages up to the
Missouri River an' by a wave of your hand stop the flow an' back her up
a mile; an' if he didn't want to, he wouldn't change expression; he
wouldn't even look interested. His old insides might be boilin' with
astonishment, but you'd never know it. On these people it don't show
through the hide.</p>

<p>"When they get through passin' the pipe, they all fork their ponies,
an' the old Injun signs the kid to crawl up behind him on his pony.
He's pretty leg-weary an' don't wait for no second invite, so rides
double the rest of the way with the old man. By the time they reach
camp the news is spread 'round about the medicine-boy that lights the
pipe with the sun. He can hardly eat his supper for Injuns crowdin'
around takin' a peek at him. The young women look at him, the old hags
kiss him, an' the mothers rub their papooses on his breast to get his
medicine. Lindsay takes it all goodhumored, barrin' the old ladies
kissin' him, which he says don't mix well with his supper. That night
Lindsay tells the old man how the trader treated him an' begs not to be
sent back.</p>

<p>"This old Injun, Wounded Hoss is his name, is chief of the band. He
tells the boy he'll not be sent back an' there's no danger of the
trader follerin' him, for a white man that follers a Piegan those days,
unless he's lookin' for trouble, is plumb silly.</p>

<p>"The grass has grown twice since my two sons were killed by the
Sioux,' says the old chief; 'my heart is on the ground; I am lonesome,
but since the sun has sent you, it is good. I will adopt you as my boy.
I am old an' my muscles are tired very tired. My lodge is yours till
you're old enough to take a woman. I have plenty ponies, an' among them
good buffalo hosses. You shall ride them, an' bring meat an' robes to
my women. Child of the Sun, it is good.' An' after that, until Lindsay
won his war-name, he was known as 'Child of the Sun.'</p>

<p>"Next day his new father gives him a bow an' otter-skin quiver,
filled with steel-pointed arrows. This bow is of fine make, chokecherry
wood, wrapped with sinew. With this rig, mounted on a fine pinto, this
kid wouldn't trade places with the President.</p>

<p>"The first few days there ain't nothin' happens; Lindsay rides along
with the bunch, learnin' to handle the bow. This ain't no easy trick,
for though a bow with a Injun behind it's a nasty weapon, with a green
hand it's mighty near harmless. It takes an expert to pull an arrow
back to the head, an' it's several years before Lindsay can get the
knack an' can drive his arrow to the feathers. The Injun pulls his
string with three an' sometimes four fingers, with all his strength,
an' by gettin' back of the ribs, an' aimin' forward, he'll drive his
arrow plumb to the lungs an' sometimes clean through a buffalo.</p>

<p>"Lindsay's enjoyin' the life fine, barrin' his everlastin' longin'
for salt an' sugar. He craves it all day an' dreams of it nights, an'
it's months before he's plumb weaned.</p>

<p>"About the fourth evenin' some scouts ride in with news of a big
herd they've located a short ride north of 'em, so all hands prepare
for a surround next day. The kid's so excited he don't sleep much. All
night long he can hear the tom-tom of the medicine-man. It's just
breakin' day when he wakes. Everybody an' the dogs are up. Quittin' the
pile of robes he throws the lodge door aside. The ponies are among the
lodges; squaws an' bucks are all busy pickin' out their mounts. From
the fires in front of the lodges he can smell meat cookin'. Lookin'
around he spies his foster father wrapped to his eyes in his robes. He
don't recognize him in the dim light till he speaks."</p>

<p><b>AN INDIAN CAMP</b></p>
</center>

<p>"My son, bring your rope an' foller me,' says Wounded loss.</p>

<p>"Gettin' his rawhide, Lindsay follers the old man among the ponies,
an' after two or three throws, gets his loop over a black pinto that is
pointed out to him as his buffalo hoss.</p>

<p>"While they're eatin', one of the kid's foster mothers leads up
three more ponies. One of these is for Wounded Hoss; the other for his
adopted boy. Injuns generally led their buffalo hosses to the runnin'
ground, an' that's what these extra mounts is for. In them days buffalo
hosses was worth plenty of robes. This animal had to be sure-footed,
long-winded, an' quick as a cat. It's no bench of a hoss that'll lay
alongside of a buffalo cow, while you're droppin' arrows or lead in
her. He's got to be a dodger, all the same cowhoss, 'cause a wounded
cow's liable to get ringy or on the fight, an' when she does, she's
mighty handy with them black horns. An Injun's sure proud of his
buffalo hoss, an' this animal gets the best a savage can give it. Old
Lindsay tells me, in winters, when it's a bad storm, he's seen 'em put
the ponies in the lodges an' the squaws would bring grass that they cut
with their knives or a kind of hoe that they had for that purpose.</p>

<p>"This white Injun tells me that if he lives a thousand years, he'll
never forget that day. Just this bunch of riders is a sight worth
seein'. There's about two hundred bucks, youngsters an' all, an' ponies
well, there ain't no color known to hossflesh that ain't there. Some of
'em's painted till you couldn't tell what shade of hide they wear. Each
buck's ridin' an ordinary-lookin' cayuse, but the one he's leadin',
or's got a light boy ridin', is sure gay an' gaudy, with tail an'
foretop tied up an' decked with feathers. Maybe he's got a medicine-bag
hangin' in his mane to make him strong an' lucky. Paint's smeared
regardless, an' there's pictures all over him.</p>

<p>"Barrin' some old coffee-cooler mumblin' a prayer, or a pony
clearin' his nostrils, these riders are joggin' along pretty near as
noiseless as a band of ghosts. Barefoot ponies on well-grassed sod
travel mighty silent, an' the savages ain't doin' no talkin' except
with their hands. This is where sign-talk comes in mighty handy. In
quiet weather the mumble of a dozen men will travel for miles, but with
hand-talk a thousand Injuns might be within gunshot, an' you'd never
know it. Buffalo, like most four-footed animals, are wind-readers, but
there ain't nothin' the matter with their hearin', so, after gettin'
the wind right, Mr. Injun makes a sneak, an' there ain't nobody capable
of givin' him lessons in the art of hidin' or sneakin'. It's been
proved; for years they've played 'I spy' with Uncle Sam, an' most of
the time Uncle's been 'It.'</p>

<p>"They ain't gone four miles when a scout looms up on a butte an'
signs with his robe. This signal causes them all to spread out an'
every Injun slides from his pony an' starts backin' out of his cowskin
shirt an' skinnin' his leggin's. 'Tain't a minute till they're all
stripped to the clout an' moccasins, forkin' their ponies naked like
themselves, barrin' two half hitches of rawhide on the lower jaw. That
sign means that the herd is in sight an' close. When they're all
mounted, the scout on the butte swings his robe a couple of times
around his head an' drops it. Before it hits the ground every pony's
runnin', with a red rider quirtin' him down the hind leg, leavin'
little curls of dust in the yellow grass behind him. At the top of the
ridge the herd shows a couple of thousand, all spread out grazin'. But
seein' these red hunters pilin' down on 'em, their heads leave the
grass. One look's a plenty, an' with tails straightened, they start
lumberin' together. It ain't long till they've bunched, millin' an'
churnin', all same spotted cattle.</p>

<p>"When Lindsay gets to 'em, the dust's rollin' so he just gets a
glimpse now an' again of his naked brothers emptyin' their quivers. He
notices Mr. Injun pull five or six arrows at a draw, holdin' the extras
in his mouth an' bow-hand, an' the way he's got of turnin' 'em loose
don't trouble him none. Above the rumble an' gruntin' of these animals,
he faintly hears now an' agin the reports of a fuke, or sawed-off
flintlock, or the quick, sharp yelp of the Injun, as he sends his arrow
home. Barrin' this, it's all dust an' rumblin'. Lindsay singles out a
cow for his meat. The dodgin' of his pony mighty near unloads him, but
by hookin' his toe under the fore leg, Injun fashion, he manages to
keep his hoss under him. The kid gets the cow all right, but he tells
me she resembles a porcupine; her hide's bristlin' with arrows when she
lays down. Aft the run's over, they've made a killin' of about three
hundred. While the squaws are skinnin', Lindsay lunches on raw liver,
like any other Injun. Looks like this short run has turned him
savage.</p>

<p>"My boy,' says Lindsay, finishin' up his yarn, openin' and shuttin'
his hands like an Injun I savvy he's countin' winters--'that's been
sixty-five years ago as near as I can figure. I run buffalo till the
whites cleaned 'em out, but that's the day I turned Injun an' I ain't
cut my hair since."</p>

<h3><a name="ch3-9"></a>BROKE BUFFALO</h3>

<p>"There used to be a man on the Yellerstone," says Rawhide Rawlins,
"that catches a pair of yearling buffalo. He handles them hump-back
cows till they're plumb gentle they hang around the ranch like any
other cows.</p>

<p>"One day he decides to put them in the yoke. That bump fits back of
the yoke and in all ways they are built for work. But he finds looks
are deceivin' when he rigs a pole on a pair of old hind wheels, making
a kind of cart it's no sulky, 'tain't built for speed, but that's what
it's used for. They ain't hard to yoke. He's whacked bulls and skinned
mules, but when he gets up behind this team he can't find no team talk
the pair savvies. He's usin' rope reins but they might as well be
thread he couldn't bend their necks with a canthook.</p>

<p>"Finally, they start. Maybe these hump-backs know where they's
going, but this driver ain't got no idea. 'Tain't long till he's in a
country he ain't never saw, but judgin' from the sun he's going south,
an' both wheels are smoking. They run over a jackrabbit and pass a band
of antelope that's doing their damdest. It's afternoon when the
hurry-up party hits a rut that breaks the driver's hold and he lands in
a patch of buck brush. He's dain' glad of it he's plumb tired holdin'.
He don't know how far they went, but don't get home till noon next day.
About a week later his team shows up at the corral they're still
packing the yoke. They don't show no signs of being jaded."</p>

<p><b>"MAYBE THESE HUMP-BACKS KNOWS WHERE THEY'S GOIN', BUT THE DRIVER
AIN'T GOT NO IDEA"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Next spring a neighbor talks him into breaking sod with them. He
gets to thinkin' this over, and knowin' they got the power he hooks
them onto a plow. This time he heads them north, but this direction
suits them. It's springtime and they don't mind going north. He's got
his plow sunk to the beam it slows their gait some but he can't turn
them. They started north and that's where they's going. Streams don't
stop them, and when he quits the handles they's still plowing
north.</p>

<p>"He finds out that these animals travel north in the spring and
south in the fall. If he could find a country with seasons no longer
than this field, they'd do good for a driving team. If he was fixed so
he could spend his winters in Mexico and his summers in Canada, they'd
just be the thing. He hears from them through a friend late that summer
they're north of the Teton, plowing south."</p>

<h3><a name="ch3-10"></a>A RIDE IN A MOVING CEMETERY</h3>

<p>The conversation among the group at the end of the bar had turned to
the subject of sudden death, when Rawhide Rawlins cuts in. "Several
times in my life I've been close to the cash in," he says, "but about
the nearest I ever come to crossin' the big range is a few years ago,
before I move to Montana. This is down in California, an' there's a
friend with me at the time I ain't givin' his name, but we'll call him
Bill Roslin. His father's a Chicago millionaire.</p>

<p>"Bill crosses over, and the reason I don't tell his right name is
because his folks never know what kind of an end Bill meets. It seems
he's out West for his parents' health, they remainin' in the East, an'
it appears they never get the facts in the case. They believe to-day
that their lovin' son quit this life in bed, with a preacher hangin'
over him an' a doctor takin' the pulse count. The truth is there wasn't
no one with him at the finish but me an' a team of hosses, an' the
hosses take the long trail with him, leavin' me in the only travelin'
cemetery I've ever seen.</p>

<p>"The way this incident starts, we are leanin' over the mahogany in a
joint in Los Gatos, after a big night together. As we're both hoss
lovers, we're givin' this subject a lot of our conversation, and
finally Bill suggests that a buggy ride would be a good thing, as we're
feelin' the need of some fresh air. We leave this joy parlor arm-in-arm
and visit a friend of mine who owns a livery stable. I tell him what
we're after, and he gives us the best he's got a span of bays bred in
the purple, and as good as any roadsters in California.</p>

<p>"For fear of losin' any of this joyful feelin' we've accumulated
we're heeled with a quart of corn juice, which we're partakin' of free
and reg'lar as we spin along one of them good California roads with our
hosses up and comin'. Bill keeps tellin' me how fancy he is with the
reins, not forgettin' to criticise my drivin', for he's reached the
stage where he's gettin' argumentative. From the line of talk he hands
out I've got my doubts as to how much he knows about hoss flesh, but
I'm not disputin' him any, for the whole world right now looks so
beautiful to me that there's no chance for an argument on any subject
from religion or Teddy Roosevelt to the best brand of red-eye. I want
to sing, and do warble for awhile, but Bill ain't got no musical ear,
and he claims the noise I'm makin' is frettin' the team and drivin' all
the birds out of the country. From feelin' musical I begin to get
sleepy, and the last I remember I'm dozin' off. I recollect Bill
reachin' for the reins, and the next I know I've a vague notion I'm in
an airship and can see clear to the Mexican line. I'm wonderin' where I
changed cars when the light goes out.</p>

<p>"When I wake up I'm layin' with my feet higher than my head, and my
eyes open slowly on a big marble tombstone with the letterin':</p>

<p>OUR LOVED ONE AT REST.<br>
JOINED THE ANGELS<br>
JUNE 30, 1911.</p>

<p>"I think to myself, I may be their 'loved one,' but they're liars
when they say I'm at rest. There ain't a place on me that don't ache;
even my hair is sore to the touch.</p>

<p>"I start figurin' from the date on the stone how long I've been
dead, but my brain won't work and I give it up. While I'm wonderin'
whether I'll have to make a squarin' talk with Peter, the gateman, I
hear the puff of a switch engine somewhere close by.</p>

<p>"'Since when,' thinks I, 'did they get a railroad built through
here?' But the thirst I've got makes me think maybe I've took the
southern route, and perhaps they're haulin' coal.</p>

<p>"What the hell you doin' here?' breaks in a voice, and it ain't no
angel talkin', so I realize that I'm in the same old world. Lookin'
over the tombstone, sizin' me up, is the toughest lookin' brakie I ever
see.</p>

<p>"Where am I?' I inquire without movin'.</p>

<p>"He gives me the name of the burg, but it's a camp I never heard
of.</p>

<p>"If you'll lead me to a thirst parlor,' I says, 'I'll buy somethin'
and you're in on it.'</p>

<p>"You're on, Bo," says he.</p>

<p>"Then, sittin' up and lookin' around, I discover I'm on a flat car
loaded to the rims with tombstones, and I'm layin' in front of the
biggest one in the lot. Although it nearly kills me to move, I scramble
to the ground, and the brakie pilots me to a little joint across the
tracks. There's nobody in there but the bartender and the flies, and
this toddy mixer is busy readin' a newspaper. Throwin' my silver on the
bar, I tell him to get in. It's pretty bad booze, but it helps bring me
back to life. The bartender's sociable, and after I buy a couple of
rounds for the three of us, pickin' up the paper again he says, 'Quite
a killin' across the state.'</p>

<p>"What killin'?' says I.</p>

<p>"Some feller runs a team into a freight that's slidin' down a grade
about three hundred miles south of here,' says the barkeep. 'Smashes
himself and the team into chunks.'</p>

<p>"I'll bet that's Bill Roslin,' I says. 'Seems to me I was
buggyridin' with him some time this year. Judgin' from where I find
myself this mornin', I was with him at the cash in.'</p>

<p>"What do you think of that?' the brakie asks the bartender, tappin'
his forehead.</p>

<p>"Turn over, you're layin' on your back,' says the bartender. 'That
smash-up happens a day's ride from here. Wait a minute, though,' he
goes on. 'It does say here that there's a feller with him that they
can't locate.'</p>

<p>"'Well, that's me,' says I.</p>

<p>"I find out later that Roslin tries to cut a freight in two with
this team, killin' himself and both hosses. That's when I land among
these grave ornaments and take a ride in a movin' cemetery."</p>

<p><b>COW PONY</b></p>
</center>

<h3><a name="ch3-11"></a>A REFORMED COWPUNCHER AT MILES CITY</h3>

<p>"I didn't go to the stockmen's meet at Miles, myself," says Rawhide
Rawlins, "but Teddy Blue tells me about it, an' as the strongest thing
he used as a joy bringer is a maple-nut sunday mixed by a lady
bartender, I guess his sight is pretty clear.</p>

<p>"Teddy has attended a lot of these gatherings in years gone by, but
always before those rock-bass eyes of his was dimmed by cow-swallows of
Miles City home-made liquid fire, so he's mostly numb an' unconscious
of what's goin' on after the first few hours.</p>

<p>"This time Teddy's a little nervous an' keeps his hat brim pretty
well down over his eyes for the first few hours he's there, as he's not
sure whether he'll be recognized by the man who was sheriff at Miles
some years back an' wanted Teddy to take room an' board with him for a
few months for shootin' up a canary bird in a place where Teddy an' a
few of his friends are pullin' a concert. Ted claims this canary
insulted him several times before he gets ringy by breakin' in with his
ditty while Ted's singin' 'The Texas Ranger.'</p>

<p>"When Teddy leaves town that time, his hoss wonders at the hurry
they're in, an' when they reach the high ground Ted looks back and sees
there's still a string of dust in Milestown that ain't had time to
settle since his hoss's feet tore it loose. He plays in luck, for the
sheriff, knowin' Ted's from Texas, goes south, while Ted's headin' for
the north pole. He's just toppin' the hill out of Miles when he runs
down a jackrabbit that gets in his way. Teddy says he never thought a
canary bird would have so many friends.</p>

<p>"So he feels easier at this meeting when he finds the sheriff an'
all the canary's friends have either cashed in or left the country.</p>

<p>"Although Montana's gone dry, this special train from the north
loaded with cowmen and flockminders don't seem to feel the drouth none,
and Miles City itself acts cheerful under the affliction. Teddy, though
he ain't drinkin' nothin' these days, admits to me on the quiet that
just the little he inhales from his heavy-breathin' friends has him
singin' 'The Dyin' Cowboy.' He figures the ginger ale and root beer
they're throwin' into 'em must have got to workin' in the bottles a
little, judgin' from the cheerful effect it has.</p>

<p>"There's another train from Helena, the headquarters for the
law-makers, that's filled with a bunch that acts as care-free as if
they'd forgot there's such a thing as an attorney-general in their
camp. They overlooked bringin' any root beer with them, so they had to
fall back on stuff they was used to. Teddy looked into one of the
Helena cars, he says, and what he sees through the smoke reminds him of
Butte in the days of licensed gamblin'. He's told they're only playin'
a few harmless games like 'Old Maid,' so he figures they just have the
chips lyin' around to make them feel at home. He says he can see one
banker has plumb forgot how to play cards, for he notices him slip an
ace off the bottom. Ted says the friendly and trustful feelin' among
this Helena crowd is fine to see. One time during daylight they pass
through a tunnel, an' strikin' a match, Teddy sees every man at the
table he's watchin' leanin' forward all spread out over his chips. They
was undoubtedly afraid they might jolt into another train and spill the
chips around, an' of course it would be a job pickin' 'em up off the
floor.</p>

<p>"There's one sport in the Fergus County bunch that was raised on the
range, that for size and weight would take the prize at the state fair
in the bull show, but he ain't wearin' any ribbons when Teddy looks at
him.</p>

<p>"Another gent from the upper Sun River country, also born on the
range an' raised in the saddle, ain't no baby in build. He's had a hoss
under him so long that his legs is kind of warped, an' when he sits in
one of the chairs they have these days in front of the root beer bars,
he straddles it instead of sittin' like a human. This feller, like
Teddy, ain't usin' nothin' stronger than the law allows now, but in old
days he was no stranger to corn juice or any of the other beverages
that brought cheer and pleasure to the life of a cow-puncher. At the
stock meetin's he used to attend, all the speakin' he listened to was
done in front of a bar.</p>

<p>"One of the oldest cow owners in the bunch, whose front name's Bill
and who in years past was known all over Montana, does most of his
ridin' in an automobile these days. Bill's in the bankin' business now
an' you might think he's cold-blooded, but I know different. To sick
folks he's almost motherly. One time in the Lake Basin country Bill's
trailin' the F beef south, an' he's on ahead lookin' for water when he
runs onto a sheepherder that's lyin' on the prairie, havin' spasms. The
shepherd tells this good Samaritan that he's swallered strychnine.</p>

<p>"Now, most cowmen them days would have let a wooly herder slip
across the divide with the wolf bait in him, but Bill's heart softens,
an' the way he quirts his hoss down the hind leg for camp is scary.
When he returns at the same gait, he's packin' a ten-pound lard can,
an' buildin' a chip fire he warms this hog fat till it runs easy. Then
with the help of an iron spoon an' three or four good calf-rastlers to
hold him, Bill empties the whole ten pounds into the shepherd. About
the time Bill runs out of lard, a stranger rides up an' breaks the news
to him that he's treatin' a case of snakes from Billings booze instead
of strychnine. The herder recovers, but for six months he sweats
straight leaf lard, an' his hide's so slick he can hardly keep his
garments on.</p>

<p>"There's one gentleman from Great Falls in the party who don't deal
in livestock, and whose name spells strong of Irish. This gent is
drinkin' coca cola, but judgin' by the expression in his eye, Teddy
Blue thinks some jobber has slipped something else into his beverage.
He gets so lit up one night in the sleeper that he dreams he's a dry
goods store and yells fire, which causes a panic and many of the
peaceful sleepers leaped from the upper berths. One heavy man the gent
from the Sun River valley was lucky enough to fall on his head, so he
wasn't injured none.</p>

<p>"Joe Scanlan, the Lord Northcliffe of Milestown, seems to be actin'
as head of the entertainment committee, an' he must have used up a
month's supply of gasoline in two days, haulin' friends and strangers
to points of interest, like the Powder River special on the Milwaukee
tracks.</p>

<p>"One of the attractions that the visitors enjoyed at Miles was
Huffman's collection of range pictures at the fine art studio he has
built to keep 'em in. Huffman was post photographer at Fort Keogh in
the old Indian fightin' days of the '70s, and is one of the real
old-timers in this business in Montana, which his pictures show.</p>

<p>"Teddy Blue meets an old friend of his, Jack Hawkins, who he hasn't
seen for years. Hawkins is an old Texas ranger, an' he drifts into
Montana as a buffalo hunter in the late '70s. He's later sheriff of
Custer County. Hawkins has seen some real fightin' when Indians an'
outlaws was bad in the early days in Texas. If you want to hear a good
story some time, ask Jack about scalpin' a Comanche.</p>

<p>"Although Miles has always been a cow town, it's earned the right to
be called a city, an' they handled the visitors in the old welcome way
of the West."</p>

<h3><a name="ch4-1"></a>RANCHES</h3>

<p>"The cow ranches that I knowed," says Rawhide Rawlins, "is nothing
like them they're running to-day. In the old days, it wasn't much, only
a place to winter. They were on a stream or river bottom. The buildings
were made of what the country gave logs, either cottonwood or pine in
the North. They had one house maybe two, with a shed between, a stable,
and a pole corral. All these buildings were dirt roof, some had no
floor but ground. There was no fences, not even a pasture. South of
Colorado these buildings were adobe. Out on the treeless plains where
there's no timber, they were sod."</p>

<p><b>"THE COW RANCHES I KNOWED HAD ONE HOUSE, A STABLE, AND A POLE
CORRAL"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"A few tons of wild hay were put up for a little bunch of saddle
hosses for winter. This was put up, not by cowpunchers, but by some
outsider that wanted work.</p>

<p>"Cows sound like milk, but if a cowpuncher got milk it was Eagle
Brand. A cowpuncher might work a brand over or steal a slick ear, but
he wouldn't steal milk from a calf.</p>

<p>"I never knowed but one woman on a cow ranch, and she wore moccasins
an' smoked willow bark. I'm talkin' about the days of the open range
when there wasn't a wire from the Arctic Sea to the Gulf of Mexico.
There were no dogs, no chickens some had a cat, but he had to rustle
for his grub during the summer months. There was a cat hole in the door
with a little swinging door that the cat could open, and don't think he
couldn't handle it 'specially if a coyote, or his big cousin, Mr. Bob
Cat, showed up. He liked to see the snow come 'cause he knowed that
would drive the punchers home, and maybe you think he didn't purr when
the boys came home; he was sure loving.</p>

<p>"Barring line riders that were stationed at a lonesome line camp,
cowpunchers put in their time at the stage station playing monty or
stud poker. Most cow hands were whiskey drinkers. Some of them wintered
in cow towns, either tending bar, gambling, or working in a livery
stable a cow hand could hold down any of these jobs. The booze joints
he worked in, he tended bar with his hat on. He was good around hosses,
and most always was a gambler. On the range he played on a blanket; in
town he could generally hold his own on a round table agin tin horns.
Some punchers hung around at the ranch, making hackamores and ropes.
Reading matter was scarce a saddle catalog, maybe a back number Police
Gazette, sometimes a well-worn stray novel. In the long winter nights
their light was coal-oil lamps or candles sometimes they were forced to
use a 'bitch,' which was a tin cup filled with bacon grease and a
twisted rag wick. It didn't only give light it gave its owners a smell
like a New England dinner.</p>

<p>"When spring came, cowpunchers gathered hosses an' rode bog till the
roundup time.</p>

<p>"Most of the cow ranches I've seen lately was like a big farm. A
bungalow with all modern improvements, a big red barn that holds
white-faced bulls an' hornless milk cows. The corrals are full of fancy
chickens, there's a big garage filled with all kinds of cars, and at
the bunkhouse that sets back where the owner and his family can't see
or hear them, are the hands.</p>

<p>"You might see a man with a big hat, boots, and spurs he's the fence
rider but most of them wear bib overalls. The boss wears puttees and a
golf cap.</p>

<p>"The bungalow, that's got electric lights an' hot and cold water.
There's a piana that you play with your feet, and a radio, a Mah Jong
set, and a phonograph. The owner, if he's an old-timer, don't care for
this. He'd rather camp in the bunkhouse and talk to some old bowleg
about cows that wore horns. But maybe the woman he's tied to is the new
kind. If she is, she's got paw whip-broke. She's out for sheriff. She's
that kind. She's been wearin' the bell since she stepped in her loop,
so paw, like any other good packhoss, takes anything you put on him.
He's wearin' golf socks and knickerbockers and when he meets his old
friends, looks ashamed.</p>

<p>"If they've got a son or daughter, these come home during vacation.
The daughter goes to finishin' school, she's got her hair bobbed. At
this school she learns to smoke, and wears less clothes and makes 'em
stay on with less visible support than any since the days of Eve. If
she or her brother ride at all, they ride with an English saddle an'
English boots. Both her and her brother can knock a golf ball so far a
bloodhound couldn't find it in a week but there's a hired girl in the
house to pass the biscuits.</p>

<p>"Son can play football. He's good with the gloves and can do all
kinds of tricks with Injun clubs, but with an ax he's plumb harmless.
He couldn't split enough wood to cook a flapjack, in a month. He can
find the button that turns on the light but he couldn't find one of his
dad's calves in a corral with a bell on. Maybe he could find work, but
he never looks for it.</p>

<p>"All these folks have been across the big water. Paw didn't care to
go, but ma was wearing the bell, so he trails along him an' his
checkbook. They've traveled in the Alps with a Swiss guide, but nary
one of them ever saw the Yellerstone or Glacier Park.</p>

<p>"The cow ranch to-day," says Rawhide, "is a place to make money to
go somewheres else."</p>

<h3><a name="ch4-2"></a>FASHIONS</h3>

<p>In granddad's time, when a man starts looking for his mate, he's
sure gambling. If the lady limps he might think her shoes hurt, but
maybe she's got a wooden leg; with the yards of garments she's wearing,
he can't tell. What she's got on would overdress a ballroom to-day.
He's only got two safe bets her face and her hands. Of course she's
wearing long hair, but her head is another gamble; maybe it's got bumps
like a summer squash; and maybe the hair that hides it is a wig. She'd
look the same with a night-cap on in a feather bed. As I said before,
"Our grandpaws was sure gamblers!"</p>

<p>It's different to-day. Bobbed hair, short skirts, low front and back
every rag she's wearing wouldn't pad a crutch. If you think you're
getting the worst of it, take the lady to the seashore, get her wet in
her one-piece suit and you don't need no X-ray the cards are face up on
the table; scars, warts, or pimples, they are all in sight all you got
to do now is find out what brand of cigarettes she uses.</p>

<p>I used to think that men could stand more punishment than women, but
I was wrong. In winter a girl wears a fox skin, but her brisket is
bared to the weather, and there ain't nothin' on her that's warmer than
a straw hat. But she don't pound her feet nor swing her arms. If she's
cold nobody knows it. If a man would go out dressed this way, there
ain't doctors enough in the world to save him. No sir, a woman can go
farther with a lipstick than a man with a Winchester and a side of
bacon.</p>

<h3><a name="ch4-3"></a>THE OPEN RANGE</h3>

<p>There's mighty little open range left, barring the mountains it's
all under wire now. There's countries in the Southwest where the horned
toad still lives undisturbed.</p>

<p>Most cow countries now are pastures. The old-time roundups of the
old days are almost a thing of the past. Before they strung wire, cow
ranges were divided by imaginary lines. These lines were ridden by line
riders who kept most of the cattle on their own ranges.</p>

<p>In the spring cowmen came to a set meeting place with their riders.
The number of riders a cowman had was according to the size of his
herd. In the Northwest, I've seen as high as a hundred men, though not
often so many. I worked on roundup where there was seventy-five men
with over four hundred head of saddle horses. These were handled by
hoss wranglers night and day.</p>

<p>In the country I knowed, the first thing done in the spring by
cowpunchers was to gather hosses. The roundup captain had to know all
the brands and the country. When they all had met, these folks started
working the country for calves. When the punchers were all saddled, the
whole bunch left camp. The roundup ground was generally within a mile
of camp. The captain rode out with his bunch and did what's called
scatterin' his riders. As I said before, these cowboys know the range
and they know where the most cows are, so the captain sends his riders
according. Maybe he'll say, "Slim, you an' Bill and Frank go out to the
head of Lone Injun and work them Clear Lake flats." Maybe it's twenty
miles. If it's a long ride, it's called the outside circle. "Slack, you
and Curley with Owens comb them dry Wolf Flats." He does this till he's
sent them all on circle in different sized bunches according to the
number of cattle they'd find.</p>

<p>The sun ain't up yet and maybe they're all back by noon, bringing
lots of cows and calves. They're all thrown into one big herd. Maybe
there's a thousand head. Now, all these riders, barring a few that's
left to hold herd, go to camp for dinner. By the time they're through
the hoss wrangler has the hosses in the rope corral. Then these
punchers rope out their fast or "cut" hosses, saddle and ride to the
herd. Then they ride in and cut out all cows with calves, each puncher
taking out cows that's wearing the brand he's working for.</p>

<p><b>"ALL THESE RIDERS GO TO CAMP FOR DINNER"</b></p>
</center>

<p>In old times when they branded on the prairie, separate herds were
held to the side of the main herd these were called "cuts." A fire was
built nearby, where they kept the irons hot. These punchers roped
calves from the cut and dragged them to the fire where two men afoot,
called "rustlers," took them off the rope, and the "iron man" branded
and ear-marked them. If the herd was too big and they couldn't brand
all the calves, the unbranded calves were held with their mothers,
night-herded and branded next day.</p>

<p>This was kept up all summer, moving camp according to how many
cattle held. The fall roundup was the same, except steers and all
cattle considered beef were cut out of the herd and night-herded. The
last thing was trailing the beef to the railroads. In old times, these
beef herds were trailed hundreds of miles to the railroads.</p>

<p>I'm only telling about cow countries I know different countries
handled cows different ways. In some southern countries a roundup was
called a "rodeo," and cowpunchers was called "buckaroos." Most of them
were known by this name west of the mountains from California to
Oregon. I have heard Texas men call a roundup a "cow hunt."</p>

<h3><a name="ch4-4"></a>BRONC TWISTERS</h3>

<p>"Talkin' about bronc twisters," says Rawhide Rawlins, "there's some
difference between hoss fighters to-day an' them I knowed years ago. I
ain't sayin' these up-to-date riders ain't good as they ever was, an'
I'd bet there's more of 'em than in the old days. The bronc rider
always was and always will be a game glory hunter, gritty as a fish-egg
rolled in sand, but the lives they live to-day an' the rigs they ride
are different.</p>

<p>"The modern bronc fighter saddles an' steps across the bronc in a
narrer chute, or he's got a bunch of hoss handlers earin' the animal
down till he saddles an' mounts. Of course he's got rules to ride
under, such as keepin' one hand up, keepin' his spurs loose an'
scratchin'. He ain't allowed to change hands, reach for or touch
nothin'. The snake he's ridin' is an old outlaw from six to fifteen
years old, an' he's grain-fed. It's a cinch a hoss with a paunch full
of oats is stronger than one with a grass belly.</p>

<p>"These modern twisters ride a swell-fork saddle with high horn. The
cantle is also high an' steep. Their spurs are long and
straight-shanked. This is the contest rider I'm talkin' about, an' he's
a sure-enough glory rider. When he breaks away from the chute in the
middle of a twistin' snake, there's thousands of folks yellin' their
heads off, but more'n half of 'em's howlin' for the hoss. There's
generally three judges on hosses follerin' him, seein' he don't pull
nothin' crooked.</p>

<p>"The big half of the folks that take in ridin' contests never rode
nothin' but cushions, so if Mister Buster gets unloaded, they say he
couldn't ride; if he stays an' scratches his bronc they say the hoss
didn't buck. But there's always a few old bowlegs that have went
straight up to the end of the bridle reins who heap savvy, an' are
ready to shake hands with this bronc rider whether he stays or hits the
ground. These twisters of to-day are made of the same leather as the
old-time ones. It ain't their fault that the country's fenced an' most
of the cows are wearin' bells.</p>

<p>"Now the old bronc fighter I knowed, lived when there wasn't a wire
from the Arctic Sea to the Gulf of Mexico, an' that whole stretch was
mighty near all his home. This gent lived on either cow or hoss ranges.
His saddle was a straight-fork with a cantle that sloped back, an'
compared to saddles now, the horn was low. I've seen bronc riders use
an old macheer saddle with a Texas tree. It had two cinches an' was
called a 'rim-fire.' The horn was low an' flat so big you couldn't
more'n span it with your hand. The macheer, as it was called, was one
piece of leather that fitted over the cantle an' horn, makin' a
coverin' for the whole rig. This leather was smooth an' so slick it
wasn't easy to stay in.</p>

<p>"These old-timers' spurs had crooked shanks that turned down. They
all rode an' broke broncs with a hackamore. It wasn't a rope one like
they're usin' to-day, but one made of braided leather an' rawhide.
Looped to this was about fifteen or twenty foot of hair rope called a
'McCarthy.' This was wrapped around the lower end of the noseband under
the jaws of the hoss, makin' reins an' a tie-rope.</p>

<p>"Range hosses them days was wild as buffalo, an' corraling a bunch
wasn't always easy. But Mister Bronc Fighter's work really begun after
the gate was closed or the bars up, for the first thing was to rope the
one he figgered on ridin'. Generally he fore-footed him. This made him
fairly safe in front, but a bronc's dangerous at both ends, an' the
bronc fighter knows this. He ain't takin' chances, an' after he's got
the bronc's front feet snared, he man-handles him till he gets the
hackamore on. Then, sometimes usin' a blind, he saddles him an' steps
across.</p>

<p>"Mebbe this bronc's a snake, an' mebbe he's easy, but either way
there ain't nobody watchin' but the other broncs. If the bronc fighter
rides him outside the corral he might buck through a bunch of range
cows, but neither cows nor broncs seem to appreciate good ridin', so
there's nobody boostin' for this twister. The old bronc riders didn't
only ride a bronc, but they worked him. They'd take a string of rough
ones to a roundup an' ride circle, cut cattle or rope off of him.</p>

<p>"All these things happened in the good old days long ago, when men
like Con Price, Charlie Brewster, Windy Bill Davis, Kid Price, Little
Jack Davis, Happy Jack Anderson, Jim Dency, Ed Rhodes, Joe Doles,
Charlie Parks, Johnny Van, Bill Shaules, and Colonel Johnson were
needed on all the cow ranges. These men were all well known when
Montana was a cow country. They were all riders that rode smooth
fork.</p>

<p>"Some of these old riders is friends of mine. Charlie Brewster's one
of the best that ever stepped across a hoss, an' many a bad one he's
tamed. One time Charlie's ridin' on a roundup. Of course his string's
all broncs, an' one mornin' he'll never forget he's got a snaky roan
under him an' starts out on circle with six other punchers in the Deep
Creek country. This stream in places is walled in with rimrock cliffs
that run up twenty to sixty feet above the bottom.</p>

<p>"They're ridin' along mebbe twenty yards from the edge of one of
these rims, when Charlie drops his hackamore reins an' builds a
cigarette. Most men ridin' a hoss like this roan would be careful, but
it's different with Charlie. He don't fear no hoss on earth, an' he
ain't askin' no bronc whether he objects to smokin'. While he's rollin'
his smoke the roan drops his ear down an' shows the white of his eyes,
so it's easy to guess his feelin's is hurt. Charlie strikes a match,
but he never lights his cigarette. While he's cuppin' his hands over
the match, lettin' the sulphur burn off, somethin' mebbe the brimfire
sniff he gets wakes the hell in the roan. He kicks the lid off, hides
his head an' starts for the rimrock.</p>

<p>"Charlie has plenty of time to quit, but does he step off? Don't
ever think it. He sinks the steel into the roan's right shoulder and
throws his weight on the left rein, but he don't turn him. The roan's
goin' high an' scary when he hits the edge of the cliff an' goes
over.</p>

<p>"There's a feller called Oregon John with Brewster when he takes
that long jump. Oregon tells me that when he sees Charlie sink into the
landscape he's afraid to look over, but he'd have bet what he's got an'
all he could beg, borrow, or steal, that at the bottom he'll find a
scramble of man an' hoss meat.</p>

<p>"None of the bunch says nothin', but ridin' up easy, like they're
goin' to a funeral, they peek over, an' what do you think they see?
There, mebbe ten feet below the rimrock, sits Charlie in the middle of
the roan. The bronc's lookin' healthy, but uncomfortable. He's lodged
in the top of a big cottonwood. Charlie's still holdin' his cigarette,
an' when the boys show up he hollers: 'Anybody got a match? The one I
struck blowed out.'"</p>

<p><b>"THE BRONC'S LODGED IN THE TOP OF A BIG COTTONWOOD"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Oregon says that bronc's sure helpless, for he's wedged in the old
tree so he can't more than move an ear. One of the boys goes to camp
an' brings an axe, an' they have to fall the tree to get the roan
out.</p>

<p>"This story may sound fishy to some folks, but it's true. Charlie
Brewster's still in Montana, an' I'll bet wherever he is, he's still
with hosses. He was a real bronc rider, an' all old-time cowmen knew
him.</p>

<p>"I remember another old-time bronc fighter that could ride any hoss
livin' an' work with him. His name's Con Price, an' right now he's with
a cow outfit in California. There's a story about him that a lot of old
cowmen will remember an' laugh about.</p>

<p>"Con's out one time with Ed Rosser, huntin' hosses. They're riding
the high country, when Rosser pulls up his hoss an' points to a
nester's cabin in a little valley below. 'There's women in that shack,'
says he.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?' asks Con.</p>

<p>"I see washin' on the line there a few days ago,' says Rosser, 'an'
all the he-folks we know, when they do any washin', use the creek an'
hang their clothes on the willers. But to make my belief a cinch bet,
there's garments on that line that ain't worn by no he-people.'</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you're right,' Con says. 'I remember a few weeks ago
that nester told me he had a wife an' daughter comin' out from the
States.'</p>

<p>"Wonder what the gal looks like,' says Rosser.</p>

<p>"She's a good looker, judgin' from the photograph the old man shows
me,' Con answers.</p>

<p>"In the days when this happens, women 're scarce, an' the few
cowpunchers an' old mountain men that lived in this womanless land sure
liked to see a white woman an' hear her voice. So Con an' Rosser start
figgerin' on some kind of an excuse to visit this ranch. They can't ask
for a drink of water, 'cause the hills are full of springs an' they
have to cross the creek to get to the cabin.</p>

<p>"They're both studyin' when Con gets a plumb new one. The hoss he's
ridin's a snuffy old boy. If you thumb him or hang the steel in his
shoulder he'll go high. Con's idea is to start him an' then fall
off.</p>

<p>"They're mebbe fifty yards from the house when Con throws one of his
hooks in the shoulder of the old hoss, hopin' somebody's lookin' from
behind a curtain to see the fall he gets. Once is enough. This animal,
like many of his kind, considers this an insult, an' sinkin' his head,
he starts for the clouds.</p>

<p>"About the third jump Con loosens. The hoss, Con tells me later,
makes the play realistic. 'When he feels me goin',' he says, 'he weaves
off to one side an' I hit the ground a lot harder than I
expected.'"</p>

<center>
<p><a name="trails-53"></a><img alt="" src=
"0700941h-images/0700941h-53.jpg"></p>

<p><b>"I HIT THE GROUND A LOT HARDER THAN I EXPECTED"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Con lays like he's hurt bad. Rosser quits his hoss an' runs to his
friend, an' he's got all he can do to get him on his feet.</p>

<p>"You're a sure-enough actor,' Rosser whispers to Con. 'You're as
heavy as a dead bear,' he says, as he part leads an' part packs him up
the hill to the house. 'If it was another twenty feet I'd have to cut
hand-holds in you.'</p>

<p>"It's a cinch that anybody not on to the play would bet Con's got
all his legs broke. A sweat's broke out all over Rosser when he gently
lays Con on the step an' knocks at the door.</p>

<p>"Con lays there, listenin' for footsteps of the ladies, but they
don't come. There's no sign of life, an' the only livin' thing in sight
is two hosses Con's and Rosser's. They're driftin' mighty rapidly
homeward. The one Con rode, with the reins still over his neck, is
headed like he knows where he's goin'. Rosser's is follerin' close with
his head to one side, so he don't step on the reins. Lookin' at these
hosses, an' nobody comin' to the door, makes Con recover mighty fast,
an' his groans turns to cussin'.</p>

<p>"In them days, when the country was wide open an' lawless, the
houses had no keys, so after knockin' a few more times, they both walk
in. Rosser's right; it's a woman's camp. There's curtains on the
winders and flowers growin' in a tomato can that's settin' on a table
where the sun hits them. From the sign, they read there's two ladies
camped here an' they ain't to home. They might have got sympathy from
these ladies, but they don't get none from one another. This play of
theirs turns into a hoss joke, an' of course nobody laughs but the
hosses.</p>

<p>"It's a ten-mile ride to the ranch, an' it means twice that a-foot
to these spur-heeled gents, so after prospectin', they locate some
bacon, real light-bread an' a dried apple pie. Finishin' their feed
they wash the dishes an' start on their sorrowful journey.</p>

<p>"Con laughs about it now, but Rosser says he never even smiled the
day he walked. Rosser says Con had no license to kick. He'd fought
hosses all his life and win most of the fights. That day he throws the
fight to the hoss. The hoss, bein' crooked as Con, double-crossed
him."</p>

<h3><a name="ch4-5"></a>THERE'S MORE THAN ONE DAVID</h3>

<p>"I never knowed much about the Good Book," says Rawhide Rawlins,
"but there's one story I've always remembered since childhood that I
heer'd at Sunday school. That's the one where this sheepherder, David,
hurls a rock at Goliar an' wins the fight easy. But when I growed up I
kind of doubted this yarn till it's proved to me by the real thing that
size nor weepons don't always win a battle.</p>

<p>"One time, years ago, I'm winterin' in a little burg. I ain't
mentionin' no names, as some of the parties still live, an' havin'
families it might cause the offspring to underestimate the old man.</p>

<p>"In this camp there's a man that's got a history back of him that's
sure scary. He's wearin' several notches on his gun an' has this little
burg buffaloed. This gentleman's big all ways. He stands six feet four
an' he'll weigh two hundred an' fifty easy. As for looks, his features
is wolfish an' his brain cavity wouldn't make a drinkin' cup for a
canary bird. Knowin' he's got everybody bluffed, his feelin's is mighty
easy hurt, an' most of the folks keep him soothed by buyin' drinks for
him. One day a stranger forgets to buy him a drink, an' the big man
bends a gun over his head.</p>

<p>"There's a reformed preacher in this town, runnin' a stud poker
game. This feller is Bible-wise and hangs the name 'Goliar' on the big
man, but when he calls him that to his face the giant gets wolfy.
Misunderstandin' the name, he thinks the stud dealer's callin' him a
liar. The gambler, bein' a quick thinker, is mighty fast squarin' it up
an' tells him the Bible story, barrin' the finish, but whisperin' to me
on the side, says he wishes David would drop in.</p>

<p>"Goliar has things his own way all winter, when Christmas comes
along. There's fellers from line camps, an' all the cow and hoss
ranches in the country rides in to celebrate. Most of 'em, knowin'
Goliar's back record an' lookin' for pleasure, not trouble, are careful
about startin' arguments. They're all gamblin' an' buyin' drinks.
Nobody's barred, so it's pretty soft for the big feller. The whiskey
they're sellin' ain't a peaceful fluid at the best, an' with his hide
full of fightin' booze, he's touchy as a teased snake. He makes a
tenderfoot or two dance, but he can't get no excuse to make no
killin's.</p>

<p>"Among these range people there's a lonesome sheepherder an' his
dog. He's an undersized proposition, takes plenty of whiskey but says
nothin'. He loves music an' does his entertainin' with a mouth harp,
but most of the time he's sleepin' off in a corner with the best friend
he's got layin' at his feet.</p>

<p>"These people are all mighty enthusiastic celebratin' this saintly
day, an' of course there's several fights pulled, but none of 'em's
finished with worse than a black eye or broken nose. One gentleman, a
gun packer, reaches for his weepon once, but Goliar's standin' close to
his meat. He gets his own barker first an' combs this puncher's hair.
Of course this finishes the fight with the spillin' of some blood, but
there's no powder burnt.</p>

<p>"Long about noon this little shepherd dozes off into a nap over in a
corner. All this drunken hollerin' an' talkin' don't disturb his
slumbers, but it seems to work on his dog's nerves, an' when the collie
can't stand it no longer, he slips out, lookin' for some of his own
kind that's sober. He's soon gettin' along fine with a bunch of his
species, an' is sure enjoyin' himself when Goliar, who's roamin' from
one joint to another, sets eyes on him. It's pickin's for this
low-minded giant, an' it ain't long before he's got this poor dog
turned loose with a can hangin' to him.</p>

<p>"The first charge the collie makes is in among the hosses that's
tied to'the rack, leavin' nothin' much on the pole but broken bridle
reins an' hackamore ropes, an' quite a few of the celebrators are
afoot. Then Mr. Dog starts for his friend an' partner, an' when he
tears into this saloon, the noise he's makin' wakens the little
shepherd. The dog winds up whinin' on his master's knee.</p>

<p>"This shepherd's face, that has always been smilin' an' happy, looks
mighty warlike now, an' it wouldn't be healthy for the canner to be
close to him. Seems like he's sober in a minute. While he's untyin' the
can from his dog, the owner of this booze joint, who's a dog lover
himself, steps over an' slippin' a forty-five into the sheepherder's
hand, whispers: 'That's Goliar's work; go get him, Shep.'</p>

<p>"But the sheepherder, who's cryin' now, shakes his head, an' refuses
the weepon, sayin' he don't need no gun to clean up that big louse.
Then he leaves without even askin' for a drink, his dog slinkin' close
to his heels. He's quite a way up the street when Goliar spies him an'
hollers: 'Go 'round 'em, Shep! Have you got all the black ones?'
Pullin' his gun, the giant starts liftin' the dirt around the
shepherd's feet.</p>

<p>"But the herder ain't gun-shy an' don't even side-step till one of
the bullets grazes the dog, who whines an' crowds his master's legs.
Whirlin' 'round, the gentle shepherd reaches down, picks up a
good-sized boulder an' hurls it at Goliar, catchin' him on the point of
the chin. Goliar straightens up an' falls his length, an' before he can
recover the herder has tore the gun loose from the giant's clutches and
is workin' him over with the barrel.</p>

<p>"Some one wants to stop him, but the same feller that offers him the
gun tells the crowd to stand back an' let Shep finish. The stud dealer,
who's watched the play from the start, says: 'Goliar got his that's
sure enough David. The same as cards, history repeats I'd 've played
Goliar with a copper.'</p>

<p>"This Goliar is gathered up an' sent by the next stage to the
hospital where he's nursed back to life. His nose is broke, the same
with his right jaw, an' one of his ears has to be sewed on.</p>

<p>"I ain't seen Goliar for years, but the last time I met him he's
wearin' scars that's a map of the battle he had with David."</p>

<h3><a name="ch4-6"></a>THE WAR SCARS OF MEDICINE WHIP</h3>

<p>I'd been over on Broken Bow, an' had seen many strange Indians in
Long Pipe's camp; among 'em an old, scar-faced warrior that interested
me. Knowin' Squaw Owens' acquaintance among these people, I enquire if
he knows any such savage.</p>

<p>"From the earmarks you give me," says he, "it's old Medicine-Whip,
my uncle by marriage; that Blood woman I had was his niece. When I'm a
kid in Missouri I used to read yaller-back novels that was sure scary,
but Medicine-Whip's history would make them romances look like a primer
story. There ain't much pleasure for him since the Whites made laws
agin killin' men for fun. His range is up on Belly River. I guess he's
down visitin' some of his relatives, an' when an Injun goes visitin' it
ain't one of them how-d'ye-do, how-are-you calls, where you stand
awhile with your hat in your hand. It's a case of stay till the grub
plays out. This social habit is one of the things that makes 'em hard
to civilize; you'd as well try an' scatter a flock of blackbirds or
make a bee live lonesome as to separate these people. 'Tain't their
nature. In old times they bunched for protection agin their enemies,
an' they've never got over likin' that way of livin'. Nature fed an'
clothed her children an' taught 'em how to live, an' it'll take Uncle
Sam some time to wean 'em from their mother,</p>

<p>"We'll say here's an Injun forty years old. He's had the dust of the
runnin' herd in his nostrils, an' the clatter of dewclaws an' hoofs are
still fresh in his ears, when Uncle Sam pulls him down off a
highheaded, painted buffalo hoss, an' hookin' his hands around the
handle of a walkin' plow, tells him it's a good thing, to push it
along.</p>

<p>"Farmin' is the hardest work on earth, an' when Uncle Sam saws off a
job like this to Mr. Injun, a gentleman that never raised nothin' but
hell an' hair, it's no wonder he backs away from the proposition. As
far back as anybody knows, his folks lived by the use of their weapons.
They sowed nothin' an' reaped nothin'. Barrin' a few roots an' berries
the women gathered, Injuns were carniverous animals; meat was their
strong holt, an' if they had that they asked for nothin' more.</p>

<p>"But you were askin' about Medicine-Whip. That old savage is the
real article, an' can spin yarns of killin's an' scalpin's that would
make your hair set up like the roach on a buck antelope; that is, if
you caught him feelin' right. I ain't never got him strung out but
once.</p>

<p>"That's about four years ago; I'm huntin' hosses in the Ghost Butte
country. One afternoon after ridin' since sun-up with nothin' to eat, I
run on to a Blood camp an' I ain't sorry, for I'm sure hungry. This
camp's pretty quiet; barrin' a few half-naked kids playin' an' an old
squaw humped over, scrapin' a beefhide, there's no life in sight. It's
one of these hot days that makes folks hug shadows; even the dogs,
layin' in the shade of the lodges with their tongues lollin', don't no
more'n glance at me. I ask the old woman where is the chief's lodge.
She straightens up and points with her chin to one with queer-bookin'
birds painted on each side of the door. Droppin' my reins to the
ground, I slide from the saddle an' approach the gentleman's residence.
Not wantin' to walk in too free, I say 'How' when I near the door.
There's an answer of 'How! How! How!' from inside, an' stoopin' an'
peekin' in, I see my old uncle.</p>

<p>"He's kind of half leanin' agin a willer backrest, cuttin' his smoke
mixture of red willow an' tobacco with a long butcher knife. He never
looks up from his work, but signs to me with his free hand to come in
an' sit down. Readin' his face, you wouldn't think he knew I was there,
but it's a safe bet he or some of his snake-eyed kids had me spotted
before I discovered the camp. There never was an Injun camp without a
lookout, an' when he sees anything it don't bother him none to let the
folks know. A man that can get to an Injun camp without bein' seen has
got a medal comin' for sneakin'.</p>

<p>"Well, after a mighty cold handshake, I sit down. He keeps choppin'
away at his tobacco with no word of welcome. While I'm sittin' there,
rollin' a smoke, he calls to a squaw outside an' tells her somethin' I
don't catch. Pretty soon the lady shows up with some half-boiled beef
an' a greasy bannock on a tin plate, along with a cup of tea, an' sets
it on the ground before me. For looks it ain't very appetizin', but the
way I'm hollered out inside, I ain't lookin' for dainties, an' I'm not
long makin' a cleanup. While I'm feedin' I go to sizin' up
Medicine-Whip. He ain't wearin' nothin' but a clout, givin' me a chance
to look him over. The lodge sides are rolled up all around, allowin'
what little breeze there is to work under, makin' it mighty pleasant in
there, while outside it's hot enough to pop corn. An' maybe you think
my uncle ain't takin' comfort in his summer garments, while I'm clothed
from heel to chin in clothes grimed with sweat an' alkali dust; but
bein' civilized, I'm forced to stand it.</p>

<p>"Well, as I started to say, sizin' up this old killer, in age I'd
guess him anywhere between seventy-five an' a hundred, an' he looks
like he'll go that much more if somebody don't put his light out. For
by the scars he's wearin', he's a hard one to down, an' it's a cinch
he's packin' considerable lead under his hide right now. His hair, that
hangs loose on his shoulders, is gettin' roan; there's a deep scar
follerin' his wrinkled face from where the hair starts on his forehead
down across his left eye, windin' up at the point of his chin. The way
the bone of his cheek is caved in an' the crooked set of his jaw, this
ain't no knife wound; it's a safe bet it was a tomahawk, swung by
somebody that wasn't jokin'. His thin-lipped mouth looks like another
scar under his nose; if he ever had a good feature, time, weather, an'
fightin' has wiped it out. On his breast, just above the nipples, is
several sets of scars. I savvy these; they're the marks of the
Sun-Dance, where the skewers held him to the medicine pole, an' by the
numbers, he's went through several of these sun jigs. Barrin' these,
his body ain't marked up much, but his legs an' arms have sure had
rough handlin'. He's a regular war map settin' up before me in his
clout an' scars, but I can't read him. Knowin' Medicine-Whip to be a
close-mouthed Injun, I'm wonderin' how I'll wring a story out of him.
He ain't got no love for a man of my color; he hates a white man's
tracks. He's fed me, but Injuns are liberal with grub, an' the chances
are the beef I'm eatin' he downed on the range an' burned or buried the
hide, or cut it up for moccasin soles. The Whites killed his cattle,
an' he can't see where it ain't right to knock over a spotted buffalo
now an' then. He'd do the same with the owner if the play came right. I
don't doubt for a minute but this old uncle would down his lovin'
nephew if he caught him lonesome. But even knowin' this I admire this
red-handed killer. The Whites have killed his meat an' taken his
country, but they've made no change in him. He's as much Injun as his
ancestors that packed their quivers loaded with flint-pointed arrows,
an' built fires by rubbin' sticks together. He laughs at priests an'
preachers. Outside his lodge on a tripod hangs a bullhide shield an'
medicine bag to keep away the ghosts. He's got a religion of his own,
an' it tells him that the buffalo are comin' back. He lights his pipe,
an' smokes with the sun the same as his folks did a thousand winters
behind him. When he cashes in, his shadow goes prancin' off on a shadow
pony, joinin' those that have gone before, to run shadow buffalo. He's
seen enough of white men, an' don't want to throw in with 'em in no
other world.</p>

<p>"Feelin' this way toward me an' my people, naturally it's hard for
me to get confidential with him. He's smokin' his pipe, which he ain't
never offered to me, when I break the ice of my visit by enquiring
about them hosses I'm huntin'. He tells me he ain't seen or heard
nothin' of 'em. Then I start fillin' him up about bein' a great
warrior, an' I'd like to hear the story of them scars he's wearin'. I
make this talk so smooth an' strong that he starts thawin' out, but's
mighty slow loosenin' up his history. Finally, reloadin' an' lightin'
his pipe, he hands it to me, an' I know he's comin' my way. Injuns are
slow talkers, an' it's some time before he gathers his yarn to reel it
out to me.</p>

<p>"On the start he straightens up, throwin' his shoulders back, an'
tells me his folks was all fighters. He ain't seen three moons when his
mother is killed by a Sioux war party. She's gatherin' berries, an' the
Sioux try to take her prisoner, but she gets noisy an' one of the party
slips a knife under her left ribs, quietin' her for always. When her
folks find her, the boy's asleep, soaked in his mother's blood. The old
men an' women prophesy that he will be a great warrior; it will be bad
for the Sioux that meets the boy that slept in his mother's blood. An'
it's the truth, 'cause before he's fifteen he downs an' scalps a Sioux,
an' from that time on he makes it his business to upset an' take the
hair of his enemy any time he meets one.</p>

<p>"He's about twenty-five when he gets these scars I'm enquirin'
about. Them days this killer's known as 'Sleeps-In-Blood.' He gets the
name of Medicine-Whip along with these scars. It's about this time the
Crows burn the Blood range, drivin' the herd south, and his people are
forced to foller up for their meat. Sleeps-In-Blood, with about fifteen
warriors, is in advance of the main band. The whole camp's hungry, an'
you know empty bellies don't sweeten nobody's temper. This advance
guard ain't joyous; they're sure wolfy, with belts cinched to their
lean flanks, an' it wouldn't be healthy for man or beast that runs into
these hungry hunters. They're all rigged for war; lances, bows, an'
loaded quivers. Most of 'em's packin' bullhide shields; a few's got
smooth-bore flintlocks; their ponies're feathered an' painted."</p>

<p><b>"IT WOULDN'T BE HEALTHY FOR MAN OR BEAST THAT RUNS INTO THESE
HUNGRY HUNTERS"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"They're joggin' along, bad-humored, when of a sudden
Sleeps-In-Blood, who's a little in advance, pulls up his pony; his
bead-eye has caught a pony track in the beaten buffalo trail they're
follerin'. In a minute they're all down, studyin' the tracks. As near
as they can figger there's about ten ponies, an' by the way the sign's
strung out, they're packin' riders.</p>

<p>"The sight of these tracks sets this blood-hungry bunch warlike for
sure, an' they ain't slow about strippin' their saddles an' sheddin'
their extra garments. Every Injun pulls his paintbag an's busy puttin'
on the finishin' touches; when they're through with their toilets, they
don't look like the same bunch. Sleeps-In-Blood smears his left hand
with vermillion an' slaps it across his mouth, leavin' a red hand-print
under his nose, showin' he's drank the enemies' blood. To keep the hair
out of his eyes he wraps his foretop in weaselskin. One or two of the
party's wearin' war-bonnets, but barrin' eagle or hawk feathers, the
bunch ain't wearin' nothin' heavier'n paint. When everybody's striped
and streaked till they look like hell's home guard, Sleeps-In-Blood
lights a small war-pipe, an' after a couple of whiffs holds the
mouthpiece toward the sun, reelin' off a prayer that would do a
preacher proud. 'See, Father, I smoke with you,' he says. 'I've lit the
pipe, an' Sleeps-In-Blood does not lie when the pipe is passed. Have
mercy on your children, Big Father; our parfleshes swing light at our
ponies' sides; already the babies cry with empty bellies. Our enemy has
burnt the grass. Now that we have struck their trail make our medicine
strong!' He winds up his long, flowery prayer by handin' the pipe
around to his painted brothers, who take two or three draws apiece.
Then it is shaken out, an' each Injun forks his pony.</p>

<p>"They don't travel fast; the tracks are plain enough in the trail,
but in the grass they're hard to hold. The party ain't gone far when
the leaders catch sight of dust. They savvy this; it's buffalo, an' it
ain't long till they hear the rumble of the runnin' herd. It's an easy
guess the enemy they're follerin's among 'em, an' raisin' the next hill
they sight 'em. A glimpse shows they're Sioux, so busy gettin' meat
they're careless, allowin' Sleeps-In-Blood an' his men to ride up in
plain sight.</p>

<p>"The Bloods are wise an' don't jump 'em right away, givin' 'em time
to fag their ponies. Then, slippin' into the dust of the herd, they go
to work on 'em an' down three before the Sioux savvy what they're up
against. But, as soon as they do, they ain't slow about quittin' the
herd. Now buffalo runnin' is hard on hoss flesh; they ain't gone no
distance till the Sioux ponies, plumb winded, throw their tails up.
They're makin' a slow runnin' fight of it when Sleeps-In-Blood kills
the pony under the Sioux medicine man, causin' his party to pull up an'
bunch. They're pretty well heeled, most of 'em packin' guns, an' the
way they handle 'em keeps the Bloods at a respectful distance. From
what old Medicine-Whip tells me, the Sioux are sure makin' a good
standoff. Twice they charge 'em, an' each time a pony comes back shy a
rider. These charges ain't successful; they've lost two men an' have
three cripples out of the fight. The Bloods are plumb buffaloed, an' it
looks like it's goin' to be a drawn battle. Sleeps-In-Blood an' his men
have pulled off out of range an' are bunched up, makin' medicine, when
a Sioux starts shoutin' abuse to 'em in their own tongue. This might
sound strange to anyone that don't know Injuns. In those times, women
were counted as plunder an' were taken as such by war parties. The
speaker is either a renegade Blood or his mother a stolen woman an'
she's learnt her offspring the tongue of her people. He hollers to them
that it ain't no credit to a Sioux to take the hair of a Blood: these
trophies are only good to trim squaw leggin's with, or make wigs for
dolls for the youngsters. He said that the Sioux, when they take Bloods
prisoners, don't kill 'em, but keep 'em to pack water for the squaws.
Then he starts pickin' on Sleeps-In-Blood, who is sittin' on his pinto
pony.</p>

<p>"That pony,' said he, describin' Sleeps-In-Blood's animal, 'is a war
hoss. Why is he under a woman? No,' says he, shadin' his eyes with his
hand, 'it's a maggot I see. Do the Bloods allow the flies to blow their
ponies' backs? Come, pony, to a warrior who will clean your back before
it rots. The smell is already bad on the wind.' The Sioux all laughed
long and loud.</p>

<p>"This talk makes Sleeps-In-Blood madder than a teased snake, an' he
hollers back: 'Has the liar said all? The Sioux call themselves
hunters, but they lay in camp and eat their brothers, the dog!'</p>

<p>"You may not know it but the Bloods are one tribe that don't eat
dog, an' say it is not good to eat those who guard your camp, an' howl
at your door with lonesomeness when you're gone.</p>

<p>"It's a poor hunter that eats his friends,' goes on Sleeps-In-Blood.
'If the liar has more to say, let him speak fast, for in less time than
it takes to smoke the war-pipe, his tongue will be stilled for always;
for he you call the maggot will whip your medicine man like he would a
bad woman.'</p>

<p>"With that he throws to the ground his bow an' nearly empty quiver.
He has already got his rawhide rope wrapped 'round an' 'round his
pony's belly, an' by shovin' his legs under an' crampin' his knees back
with feet stuck in the rope below, he's as good as tied. This is often
done by Indians when chargin' a dangerous place, knowin' if they are
wounded or killed the pony will pack them out. If the pony is downed,
the Indian takes a chance of cuttin' himself loose with his scalpin'
knife. So, as I said before, he throws down his bow and empty quiver,
an' flies at them. This sure surprises the Sioux: before you could bat
your eye, he's among 'em.</p>

<p>"The feller that has been doin' the talkin' is standin' on the edge
of the bunch, an' as Sleeps-In-Blood reaches him he shoves his lance up
under the Sioux's ribs, hollerin': 'If I'm a maggot I give meat to my
brothers!' The lance catches in the Sioux's carcass, and
Sleeps-In-Blood loses it, leavin' him nothin' but his quirt an'
bullhide shield, which he holds close over his vitals an' crowds in
among the ponies. The last he remembers he's lashing the medicine-man
across the back an' shoulders with his quirt. He's so fightin' locoed
he don't feel the arrows that are piercin' his legs an' thighs. He's
got 'em pretty well scattered with his quirt, when a Sioux beefs him
with his tomahawk an' he flops over.</p>

<p>"This game charge of his rallies an' nerves up his own men so
they're right at his pony's tail when he hits the Sioux bunch, who are
so busy dodgin' the swing of his quirt they're killed before they come
to.</p>

<p>"When Sleeps-In-Blood wakes up he's sure dazed. Lookin' 'round he
don't seem to savvy what's happened, till one of his friends slips a
knife into his hand an' tells him to go to work. Plumb locoed with the
pain of his wound, he starts butcherin'. The Sioux are all dead an'
scalped but two: the medicine-man an' the one that done the talkin'.
They've held them two out for him to trim.</p>

<p>"The blood runnin' through Sleeps-In-Blood's eyes has set him mad.
He couldn't have been more fiendish if he'd broke fresh from hell. He's
satisfied with the locks of the medicine-man, but the way he trims that
Sioux that calls him names is sure scandalous. Every cut he makes means
somethin' to an Injun, an' as these people believe a man lands in the
next world in the shape he leaves this one, it won't be hard, he
thinks, to identify this Sioux as a liar an' thief in the happy huntin'
ground.</p>

<p>"Reelin' off this yarn has warmed my uncle up plenty; it's brought
all the savage in him to the surface, an' lookin' him over, I don't
doubt his story. He's been a fighter all right, an' it's in him
yet."</p>

<h3><a name="ch4-7"></a>HOW PAT DISCOVERED THE GEYSER</h3>

<p>"Columbus discovers America. A feller called Ponce de Leon claims he
discovered Florida. Jim Bridger finds the Great Salt Lake, but it's Pat
Geyser, as he's knowed by old-timers, that locates the geyser on Geyser
Creek, near the town that gets its name from it. Pat Geyser ain't this
gent's right name, but I ain't tippin' nobody's hand," observed Rawhide
Rawlins.</p>

<p>"Pat tells that one day in the early '80s he's out lookin' for cows,
an' the chances are good that any he takes an interest in belong to
somebody else. Pat's good hearted an' he hates to see calves wanderin'
around wearin' no brand. They look so homeless that he's always willin'
to stake 'em to a brand with his own iron.</p>

<p>"Pat's hoss is dry when he rides onto this creek an' notices a muddy
pool, but as there ain't no geysers in Ireland, Pat don't savvy, he
says. His hoss ain't no more'n dropped his head to drink than this here
geyser busts loose, takin' Pat an' the hoss along with it. There's
steam, sody water, an' a mixture of all the health resorts, in this
stew that's boiled over, an' Pat claims the force of it lifts his hoss
from his iron shoes."</p>

<p><b>"THE FORCE OF IT LIFTS PAT'S HOSS FROM HIS IRON SHOES"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Pat tells that he don't know how far skyward he goes, but him an'
the hoss passes an eagle on the way back.</p>

<p>"Now I'm goin' to say here that I've seen this geyser myself, many a
time, but me nor no one else, barrin' Pat, ever see it do anything more
vicious than a keg of sour dough would. It just kind of bubbles once in
a while.</p>

<p>"Havin' heard of the Yallerstone Park, an' thinkin' he's found
another one, Pat starts, a few days after, buildin' a health resort,
follerin' the plans of the Mammoth Hotel, but bein' built of
cotton-wood logs, dry weather shrinks her a lot. I remember bein' there
once, and after a few drinks of Pat Geyser's favorite, the measurements
swells till this shack looks like the Brown Palace in Denver.</p>

<p>"For the first few years Pat don't draw a strong trade, as humans
are scatterin' and the only sickness in the country is scab, the
sheepmen havin' dippin' tanks for that. But in time it grows into quite
a resort and rest cure for shepherds. These herders don't take much to
the geyser water, barrin' the little Pat throws in as a 'chaser.'</p>

<p>"Tenderfeet stoppin' with Pat would often ask, 'When does this
geyser turn loose?'</p>

<p>"Pat's always there with a comeback: 'How long will you be
here?'</p>

<p>"Leavin' to-morrer,' the tenderfoot might say.</p>

<p>"You'll just miss it by a day.' Pat had it fixed so the visitor was
always shy a day or two of seein' it.</p>

<p>"None of the regular patrons of the resort ever see anything that
ain't brought on by liquor, but by usin' enough of the rest cure
medicine the bartender passed out there, a man could see northern
lights at noon time, rainbows at night, an' total eclipses of the sun
any time to say nothin' of geysers of all sizes.</p>

<p>"Pat was strong for the social end of life, an' he used to pull card
parties for freighters to break the monotony of their trips. At these
no skinner was allowed to bet any more than he had. Some knockers said
Pat knew both sides of the cards, but if he ever dealt off the bottom
it's when nobody's lookin'.</p>

<p>"One afternoon when Pat's asleep the railroad sneaks in an' moves
the town. The minute Pat opens his eyes he's onto their holecard, and
gettin' the wheelbarrow, he moves his hotel over to the new location
an' has his dinin' room open for supper.</p>

<p>"When automobiles get popular, Pat, who's always progressive an'
up-to-date, buys one. The day after it's delivered, Pat asks a friend
to ride over to Stanford with him. They started, an' after passin' what
looks like Stanford as far as he could tell at the 80-mile gait they're
goin', an' seein' they're nearin' Judith Gap, the friend asks: 'What's
your hurry, Pat?'</p>

<p>"I'm in no hurry,' Pat yelled, 'but I'm damned if I know how to stop
the thing. We'll have to let it run down.'</p>

<p>"The car bein' young, it has the ways of a bronc, an' Pat almost
died at the wheel with his hands numb an' locked in the spokes. The
friend gives him nourishment that keeps life in him, an' 18 hours later
they wind up on Greybull River in Wyoming."</p>

<h3><a name="ch4-8"></a>SOME LIARS OF THE OLD WEST</h3>

<p>Speakin' of liars, the Old West could put in its claim for more of
'em than any other land under the sun. The mountains and plains seemed
to stimulate man's imagination. A man in the States might have been a
liar in a small way, but when he comes west he soon takes lessons from
the prairies, where ranges a hundred miles away seem within touchin'
distance, streams run uphill and Nature appears to lie some
herself.</p>

<p><b>"THE MOUNTAINS AND PLAINS SEEMED TO STIMULATE A MAN'S
IMAGINATION"</b></p>
</center>

<p>These men weren't vicious liars. It was love of romance, lack of
reading matter, and the wish to be entertainin' that makes 'em stretch
facts and invent yarns. Jack McGowan, a well-known old-timer now livin'
in Great Falls, tells of a man known as Lyin' Jack, who was famous from
Mexico to the Arctic.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>McGowan says one of Jack's favorite tales is of an elk he once
killed that measured 15-feet spread between the antlers. He used to
tell that he kept these horns in the loft of his cabin.</p>

<p>"One time I hadn't seen Jack for years," said McGowan, "when he
shows up in Benton. The crowd's all glad to see Jack, an' after a round
or two of drinks, asks him to tell them a yarn.</p>

<p>"No, boys,' says Jack, 'I'm through. For years I've been tellin'
these lies told 'em so often I got to believin' 'em myself. That story
of mine about the elk with the is-foot horns is what cured me. I told
about that elk so often that I knowed the place I killed it. One night
I lit a candle and crawled up in the loft to view the horns an' I'm
damned if they was there."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Once up in Yogo, Bill Cameron pointed out Old Man Babcock an'
another old-timer, Patrick, sayin', "there's three of the biggest liars
in the world."</p>

<p>"Who's the third?" inquired a bystander.</p>

<p>"Patrick's one, an' old Bab's the other two," says Cameron.</p>

<p>This Babcock one night is telling about getting jumped by 50 hostile
Sioux, a war party, that's giving him a close run. The bullets an'
arrows are tearin' the dirt all around, when he hits the mouth of a
deep canyon. He thinks he's safe, but after ridin' up it a way,
discovers it's a box gulch, with walls straight up from 600 to 1,000
feet. His only get-away's where he come in, an' the Indians are already
whippin' their ponies into it.</p>

<p>Right here old Bab rares back in his chair, closes his eyes, an'
starts fondlin' his whiskers. This seems to be the end of the story,
when one of the listeners asks:</p>

<p>"What happened then?"</p>

<p>Old Bab, with his eyes still closed, takin' a fresh chew, whispered:
"They killed me, b' God!"</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>The upper Missouri River steamboats, they used to say, would run on
a light dew, an' certainly they used to get by where there was mighty
little water. X. Beidler an' his friend, Major Reed, are traveling by
boat to Fort Benton. One night they drink more than they should. X. is
awakened in the morning by the cries of Reed. On entering his
stateroom, X. finds Reed begging for water, as he's dying of
thirst.</p>

<p>X. steps to the bedside, and takin' his friend's hand, says: "I'm
sorry, Major, I can't do anything for you. That damned pilot got drunk,
too, last night, and we're eight miles up a dry coulee!"</p>

<p>"Some say rattlers ain't pizen," said Buckskin Williams, an old
freighter, "but I know different. I'm pullin' out of Milk River one day
with 14, when I notice my line hoss swing out an' every hoss on the
near side crowds the chain. My near wheel hoss, that I'm ridin', rares
up an' straddles the tongue. It's then I see what the trouble is a big
rattler has struck, misses my hoss an' hits the tongue. The tongue
starts to swell up. I have to chop it off to save the wagon, an' I'm

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>"Cap" Nelse, a well-known old-timer around Benton in the early days,
tells of coming south from Edmonton with a string of half-breed carts.
They were traveling through big herds of buffalo. It was spring and
there were many calves. They had no trouble with the full-grown
buffalo, Cap said, but were forced to stop often to take the calves
from between the spokes of the cart-wheels!</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>A traveling man in White Sulphur Springs makes a bet of drinks for
the town with Coates, a saloon keeper, that Coates can't find a man
that will hold up his hand and take his oath that he has seen 100,000
buffalo at one sight. When the bet's decided, it's agreed to ring the
triangle at the hotel, which will call the town to their drinks.</p>

<p>Many old-timers said they had seen that many buffalo, but refused to
swear to it, and it looked like Coates would lose his bet until Milt
Crowthers showed up. Then a smile of confidence spread over Coates'
face as he introduces Crowthers to the drummer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crowthers," said the traveling man, "how many antelope have you
seen at one time?"</p>

<p>Crowthers straightens up and looks wise, like he's turning back over

<p>"Somethin' over a million," replies Crowthers.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crowthers, how many buffalo will you hold up your hand and
swear you have seen at one sight?"</p>

<p>Crowthers holds up his hand. "As near as I can figure," says he,
"about three million billion."</p>

<p>This is where Coates starts for the triangle, but the traveling man
halts him, saying, "Where were you when you saw these buffalo, Mr.
Crowthers?"</p>

<p>"I was a boy travelin' with a wagon train," replies Crowthers. "We
was south of the Platte when we was forced to corral our wagons to keep
our stock from bein' stampeded by buffalo. For five days an' nights 50
men kep' their guns hot killin' buffalo to keep 'em off the wagons. The
sixth day the herd spread, givin' us time to yoke up an' cross the
Platte, an' it's a damn good thing we did."</p>

<p>"Why?" asks the traveling man.</p>

<p>"Well," says Crowthers, "we no more than hit the high country north
of the Platte, than lookin' back, here comes the main herd!"</p>

<h3><a name="ch4-9"></a>HIGHWOOD HANK QUITS</h3>

<p>"When I first knowed Highwood Hank he's a cowpuncher and is pretty
handy among broncs," says Rawhide Rawlins. "In them days he's ridin'
for the P, and anybody that savvies that iron knows they never owned a
hoss that wasn't a snake. A man had to be a rider to work for 'em. If a
hoss thief found a P hoss in his bunch at daybreak, it's a cinch he'd
turn him loose. P hosses was notorious.</p>

<p>"Kid Russell tells me he rode one summer for Ben Phillips, who owned
that brand. He claimed he didn't take on no flesh that year. When he
quit, his fingernails was all wore off an' there wasn't a hoss in his
string that had any mane from his ears to his withers. There was spur
tracks all over his saddle. He couldn't eat supper thinkin' of the hoss
he had to fork the next mornin', and he never made no try at breakfast.
His hands is so shaky, all that spring, that he has to get a friend to
roll his cigarettes, an' if he'd worked a whole season his fingers
would be wore down to the knuckles. As it is, it takes a solid year to
get the crooks out of his hands from havin' 'em clamped 'round the
saddle horn.</p>

<p>"As I said before, Hank's a rider, but like all others, old Daddy
Time has hung it on him. It seems these days like his backbone has
growed together in places an' it don't take to the swing of a pitchin'
bronc. Hank's married now, and he's a granddad. He still owns a ranch
and rides, but they ain't the long circles he used to make.</p>

<p>"A couple of years ago Hank runs in a bunch of broncos. They're
rollin' fat an' pretty snuffy. He drops his rope on to one, an' the
minute his loop tightens, Mr. Bronc swings 'round, comin' at Hank with
his ears up, whistlin' like a bull elk. In the old days this would
a-been music to Hank's ears. It takes him back to the P string.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hank's lookin' through the corral fence, an' begs Hubby not to
crawl this one. He tells her not to worry.</p>

<p>"All you got to do is sit back an' watch me scratch his shoulders,'
he says. 'You won't have to pay no railroad fare to Miles City to see
bronc ridin,' he tells her. 'This is goin' to be home talent.'</p>

<p>"He'll throw you,' says she.</p>

<p>"Yes, he will,' says Hank, as he cinches his hull on.</p>

<p>"This bronc's got his near ear dropped down an' about half of his
eye shows white. He's humped till you could throw a dog under the
saddle skirts behind. Hank's whistlin' 'Turkey in the Straw' to keep
his sand up, an' his wife notices there's a tremble in his hand as he
reaches for the horn.</p>

<p>"The minute the bronc feels weight on the near stirrup he starts for
the clouds, an' the second time he comes down Hank ain't with him. He's
sittin' on the ground with two hands full of corral dust."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did,' says Hank. 'You're a fine partner, sittin' there
like you're deaf and dumb. Any time I ever rode a bronc before, there's
always been somebody around to tell me to stay with him to hang an'
rattle. You didn't give me any encouragement. Just lookin' at you
scared me loose.'</p>

<p>"All right,' says Mrs. Hank, 'I'll try to do better next time.'</p>

<p>"But the next one is a shorter ride than the first. His better half
yells: 'Stay with him!' but it's just as Hank hits the ground.</p>

<p>"I hollered that time,' says she.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did,' says Hank. 'Why didn't you wait till New
Year's?'</p>

<p>"Hank hates to do it, but he has to own up that his bronc ridin'
days is over."</p>

<h3><a name="ch4-10"></a>LONGROPE'S LAST GUARD</h3>

<p>"Whoever told you that cattle stampede without cause was talkin'
like a shorthorn," says Rawhide Rawlins. "You can bet all you got that
whenever cattle run, there's a reason for it. A whole lot of times
cattle run, an' nobody knows why but the cows an' they won't tell.</p>

<p>"There's plenty of humans call it instinct when an animal does
something they don't savvy. I don't know what it is myself, but I've
seen the time when I'd like to a-had some. I've knowed of hosses bein'
trailed a thousand miles an' turned loose, that pulled back for their
home range, not goin' the trail they come, but takin' cut-offs across
mountain ranges that would puzzle a big-horn. An' if you'd ask one of
these wise boys how they done it, he'd back out of it easy by sayin'
it's instinct. You'll find cow ponies that knows more about the
business than the men that rides 'em.</p>

<p>"There's plenty of causes for a stampede; sometimes it's a green
hand or a careless cowpuncher scratchin' a match to light a cigarette.
Maybe it's something on the wind, or a tired nighthoss spraddles and
shakes himself, an' the poppin' of the saddle leather causes them to
jump the bed-ground. Scare a herd on the start, and you're liable to
have hell with them all the way. I've seen bunches well trail-broke
that you couldn't fog off the bedground with a slicker an' six-shooter;
others, again, that had had a scare, you'd have to ride a hundred yards
away from to spit. Some men's too careful with their herd an' go
tiptoein' around like a mother with a sick kid. I've had some
experience, an' claim this won't do. Break 'em so they'll stand noise;
get 'em used to seein' a man afoot, an' you'll have less trouble.</p>

<p>"There's some herds that you dassen't quit your hoss short of five
hundred yards of. Of course it's natural enough for cow-brutes that
never see hoss an' man apart to scare some when they see 'em separate.
They think the top of this animal's busted off, an' when they see the
piece go movin' around they're plenty surprised; but as I said before,
there's many reasons for stampedes unknown to man. I've seen herds
start in broad daylight with no cause that anybody knows of. The smell
of blood will start 'em goin'; this generally comes off in the mornin'
when they're quittin' the bed-ground. Now, in every herd you'll find
steers that's regular old rounders. They won't go to bed like decent
folks, but put in the night perusin' around, disturbin' the peace. If
there's any bulls in the bunch, there's liable to be fightin'. I've
often watched an old bull walkin' around through the herd an' talkin'
fight, hangin' up his bluff, with a bunch of these rounders at his
heels. They're sure backin' him up boostin' an' ribbin' up trouble, an'
if there's a fight pulled off you should hear these trouble-builders
takin' sides; every one of 'em with his tongue out an' his tail kinked,
buckin' an' bellerin, like his money's all up. These night ramblers
that won't go to bed at decent hours, after raisin' hell all night, are
ready to bed down an' are sleepin like drunks when decent cattle are
walkin' off the bed-ground.</p>

<p>"Now, you know, when a cow-brute quits his bed he bows his neck,
gaps an' stretches all the same as a human after a night's rest. Maybe
he accidentally tromps on one of these rounders' tails that's layin'
along the ground. This hurts plenty, and Mr. Night Rambler ain't slow
about wakin' up; he raises like he's overslept an' 's afeared he'll
miss the coach, leavin' the tossel of his tail under the other fellow's
hoof. He goes off wringin' his stub an' scatterin' blood on his rump
an' quarters. Now the minute them other cattle winds the blood, the
ball opens. Every hoof's at his heels barkin' and bellerin'. Them
that's close enough are hornin' him in the flank like they'd stuck to
finish him off. They're all plumb hog-wild, an' if you want any beef
left in your herd you'd better cut out the one that's causin' the
excitement, 'cause an hour of this will take off more taller than
they'll put on in a month.</p>

<p>"Cattle like open country to sleep in. I sure hate to hold a herd
near any brakes or deep 'royos, 'cause no matter how gentle a herd is,
let a coyote or any other animal loom up of a sudden close to 'em an'
they don't stop to take a second look, but are gone like a flash in the
pan. Old bulls comin' up without talkin' sometimes jump a herd this
way, an' it pays a cowpuncher to sing when he's comin' up out of a
'royo close to the bed-ground.</p>

<p>"Some folks'll tell you that cowboys sing their cows to sleep, but
that's a mistake, judgin' from my experience, an' I've had some. The
songs an' voices I've heard around cattle ain't soothin'. A cowpuncher
sings to keep himself company; it ain't that he's got any motherly love
for these longhorns he's put to bed an' 's ridin' herd on; he's amusin'
himself an' nobody else. These ditties are generally shy on melody an'
strong on noise. Put a man alone in the dark, an' if his conscious is
clear an' he ain't hidin' he'll sing an' don't need to be a born
vocalist. Of course singin's a good thing around a herd, an' all
punchers know it. In the darkness it lets the cows know where you're
at. If you ever woke up in the darkness an' found somebody you didn't
know who or what loomin' up over you, it would startle you, but if this
somebody is singin' or whistlin', it wouldn't scare you none. It's the
same with Mr. Steer; that snaky, noiseless glidin' up on him's what
scares the animal.</p>

<p>"All herds has some of these lonesomes that won't lie down with the
other cattle, but beds down alone maybe twenty-five to thirty yards
from the edge of the herd. He's got his own reason for this; might be
he's short an eye. This bein' the case you can lay all you got he's
layin' with the good blinker next to the herd. He don't figure on
lettin' none of his playful brothers beef his ribs from a sneak.
One-eyed hoss is the same. Day or night you'll find him on the outside
with his good eye watchin' the bunch. Like Mister Steer, the confidence
he's got in his brother's mighty frail.</p>

<p>"But these lonesome cattle I started to tell you about, is the ones
that a puncher's most liable to run onto in the dark, layin' out that
way from the herd. If you ride onto him singin', it don't startle Mr.
Steer; he raises easy, holdin' his ground till you pass; then he lays
down in the same place. He's got the ground warm an' hates to quit her.
Cows, the same as humans, like warm beds. Many's the time in cool
weather I've seen some evil-minded, lowdown steer stand around like he
ain't goin' to bed, but all the time he's got his eye on some poor,
undersized brother layin' near by, all innocent. As soon as he thinks
the ground's warm he walks over, horns him out an' jumps his claim.
This low-down trick is sometimes practiced by punchers when they got a
gentle herd. It don't hurt a cowpuncher's conscience none to sleep in a
bed he stole from a steer.</p>

<p>"If you ride sneakin' an' noiseless onto one of these lonesome
fellers, he gets right to his feet with dew-claws an' hoofs rattlin',
an' 's runnin' before he's half up, hittin' the herd like a canned dog,
an' quicker than you can bat an eye the whole herd's gone. Cows are
slow animals, but scare 'em an' they're fast enough; a thousand will
get to their feet as quick as one. It's sure a puzzler to cowmen to
know how a herd will all scare at once, an' every animal will get on
his feet at the same time. I've seen herds do what a cowpuncher would
call 'jump' that is, to raise an' not run. I've been lookin' across a
herd in bright moonlight a thousand head or more, all down; with no
known cause there's a short, quick rumble, an' every hoof's
standin'.</p>

<p>"I've read of stampedes that were sure dangerous an' scary, where a
herd would run through a camp, upsettin' wagons an' trompin' sleepin'
cowpunchers to death. When day broke they'd be fifty or a hundred miles
from where they started, leavin' a trail strewn with blood, dead
cowpunchers, an' hosses, that looked like the work of a Kansas cyclone.
This is all right in books, but the feller that writes 'em is romancin'
an' don't savvy the cow. Most stampedes is noisy, but harmless to
anybody but the cattle. A herd in a bad storm might drift thirty miles
in a night, but the worst run I ever see, we ain't four miles from the
bed-ground when the day broke.</p>

<p>"This was down in Kansas; we're trailin' beef an' have got about
seventeen hundred head. Barrin' a few dry ones the herd's straight
steers, mostly Spanish longhorns from down on the Cimarron. We're about
fifty miles south of Dodge. Our herd's well broke an' lookin' fine, an'
the cowpunchers all good-natured, thinkin' of the good time comin' in
Dodge.</p>

<p>"That evenin' when we're ropin' our hosses for night guard, the
trail boss, 'Old Spanish' we call him he ain't no real Spaniard, but
he's rode some in Old Mexico an' can talk some Spanish says to me:
'Them cattle ought to hold well; they ain't been off water four hours,
an' we grazed 'em plumb onto the bed-ground. Every hoof of 'em's got a
paunch full of grass an' water, an' that's what makes cattle lay
good.'</p>

<p>"Me an' a feller called Longrope's on first guard. He's a centerfire
or single-cinch man from California; packs a sixty-foot rawhide riata,
an' when he takes her down an' runs about half of her into a loop she
looks big, but when it reaches the animal, comes pretty near fittin'
hoof or horn. I never went much on these longrope boys, but this man
comes as near puttin' his loop where he wants as any I ever see. You
know Texas men ain't got much love for a single rig, an' many's the
argument me an' Longrope has on this subject. He claims a center-fire
is the only saddle, but I 'low that they'll do all right on a
shad-bellied western hoss, but for Spanish pot-gutted ponies they're no
good. You're ridin' up on his withers all the time.</p>

<p>"When we reach the bed-ground most of the cattle's already down,
lookin' comfortable. They're bedded in open country, an' things look
good for an easy night. It's been mighty hot all day, but there's a
little breeze now makin' it right pleasant; but down the west I notice
some nasty-lookin' clouds hangin' 'round the new moon that's got one
horn hooked over the skyline. The storm's so far off that you can just
hear her rumble, but she's walkin' up on us slow, an' I'm hopin' she'll
go 'round. The cattle's all layin' quiet an' nice, so me an' Longrope
stop to talk awhile.</p>

<p>"They're layin' quiet,' says I.</p>

<p>"Too damn quiet,' says he. 'I like cows to lay still all right, but
I want some of the natural noises that goes with a herd this size. I
want to hear 'em blowin' off, an' the creakin' of their joints, showin'
they're easin' themselves in their beds. Listen, an' if you hear
anything I'll eat that rimfire saddle of yours grass rope an' all.'</p>

<p>"I didn't notice till then, but when I straighten my ears it's quiet
as a grave. An' if it ain't for the lightnin' showin' the herd once in
a while, I couldn't a-believed that seventeen hundred head of longhorns
lay within forty feet of where I'm sittin' on my hoss. It's gettin'
darker every minute, an' if it wasn't for Longrope's slicker I couldn't
a-made him out, though he's so close I could have touched him with my
hand. Finally it darkens up so I can't see him at all. It's black as a
nigger's pocket; you couldn't find your nose with both hands.</p>

<p>"I remember askin' Longrope the time.</p>

<p>"'I guess I'll have to get help to find the timepiece,' says he, but
gets her after feelin' over himself, an' holdin' her under his
cigarette takes a long draw, lightin' up her face.</p>

<p>"Half-past nine,' says he.</p>

<p>"Half an hour more,' I says. 'Are you goin' to wake up the next
guard, or did you leave it to the hoss-wrangler?'</p>

<p>"There won't be but one guard to-night,' he answers, 'an' we'll ride
it. You might as well hunt for a hoss thief in heaven as look for that
camp. Well, I guess I'll mosey 'round.' An' with that he quits me.</p>

<p>"The lightnin's playin' every little while. It ain't making much
noise, but lights up enough to show where you're at. There ain't no use
ridin'; by the flashes I can see that every head's down. For a second
it'll be like broad day, then darker than the dungeons of hell, an' I
notice the little fire-balls on my hoss's ears; when I spit there's a
streak in the air like strikin' a wet match. These little fire-balls is
all I can see of my hoss, an' they tell me he's listenin' all ways; his
ears are never still.</p>

<p>"I tell you, there's something mighty ghostly about sittin' up on a
hoss you can't see, with them two little blue sparks out in front of
you wigglin' an' movin' like a pair of spook eyes, an' it shows me the
old night hoss is usin' his listeners pretty plenty. I got my ears
cocked, too, hearing nothin' but Longrope's singin'; he's easy three
hundred yards across the herd from me, but I can hear every word:</p>

<pre>
"Sam Bass was born in Injiana,
It was his native home,
'Twas at the age of seventeen
Young Sam began to roam.
He first went out to Texas,
A cowboy for to be;
A better hearted feller
You'd seldom ever see.
</pre>

<p>"It's so plain it sounds like he's singin' in my ear; I can even
hear the click-clack of his spur chains against his stirrups when he
moves 'round. An' the cricket in his bit he's usin' one of them hollow
conchoed half-breeds she comes plain to me in the stillness. Once
there's a steer layin' on the edge of the herd starts sniffin'. He's
takin' long draws of the air, he's nosin' for something. I don't like
this, it's a bad sign; it shows he's layin' for trouble, an' all he
needs is some little excuse.</p>

<p>"Now every steer, when he beds down, holds his breath for a few
seconds, then blows off; that noise is all right an' shows he's
settlin' himself for comfort. But when he curls his nose an' makes them
long draws it's a sign he's sniffin' for something, an' if anything
crosses his wind that he don't like there's liable to be trouble. I've
seen dry trail herds mighty thirsty, layin' good till a breeze springs
off the water, maybe ten miles away; they start sniffin', an' the
minute they get the wind you could comb Texas an' wouldn't have enough
punchers to turn 'em till they wet their feet an' fill their
paunches.</p>

<p>"I get tired sittin' there starin' at nothin', so start ridin'
'round. Now it's sure dark when animals can't see, but I tell you by
the way my hoss moves he's feelin' his way. I don't blame him none;
it's like lookin' in a black pot. Sky an' ground all the same, an' I
ain't gone twenty-five yards till I hear cattle gettin' up around me;
I'm in the herd an' it's luck I'm singing an' they don't get scared.
Pullin' to the left I work cautious an' easy till I'm clear of the
bunch. Ridin's useless, so I flop my weight over on one stirrup an' go
on singin'.</p>

<p>"The lightin' 's quit now, an' she's darker than ever; the breeze
has died down an' it's hotter than the hubs of hell. Above my voice I
can hear Longrope. He's singin' the 'Texas Ranger' now; the Ranger's a
long song an' there's few punchers that knows it all, but Longrope's
sprung a lot of new verses on me an' I'm interested.</p>

<p>"Seems like he's on about the twenty-fifth verse, an' there's danger
of his chokin' down, when there's a whisperin' in the grass behind me;
it's a breeze sneakin' up. It flaps the tail of my slicker an' goes by;
in another second she hits the herd. The ground shakes, an' they're all
runnin'. My hoss takes the scare with 'em an' 's bustin' a hole in the
darkness when he throws both front feet in a badger hole, goin' to his
knees an' plowin' his nose in the dirt. But he's a good night hoss an'
's hard to keep down. The minute he gets his feet under him he raises,
runnin' like a scared wolf. Hearin' the roar behind him he don't care
to mix with them locoed longhorns. I got my head turned over my
shoulder listenin', tryin' to make out which way they're goin', when
there's a flash of lightnin' busts a hole in the sky it's one of these
kind that puts the fear of God in a man, thunder an' all together. My
hoss whirls an' stops in his tracks, spraddlin' out an' squattin' like
he's hit, an' I can feel his heart beatin' agin my leg, while mine's
poundin' my ribs like it'll bust through. We're both plenty scared.</p>

<p>"This flash lights up the whole country, givin' me a glimpse of the
herd runnin' a little to my left. Big drops of rain are pounding on my
hat. The storm has broke now for sure, with the lightnin' bombardin' us
at every jump. Once a flash shows me Longrope, ghostly in his wet
slicker. He's so close to me that I could hit him with my quirt an' I
hollers to him, 'This is hell.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he yells back above the roar; 'I wonder what damned fool
kicked the lid off.'</p>

<p>"I can tell by the noise that they're runnin' straight; there ain't
no clickin' of horns. It's a kind of hummin' noise like a buzzsaw, only
a thousand times louder. There's no use in tryin' to turn 'em in this
darkness, so I'm ridin' wide just herdin' by ear an' follerin' the
noise. Pretty soon my ears tell me they're crowdin' an' comin'
together; the next flash shows 'em all millin', with heads jammed
together an' horns locked; some's rared up ridin' others, an' these is
squirmin' like bristled snakes. In the same light I see Longrope, an'
from the blink I get of him he's among 'em or too close for safety, an'
in the dark I thought I saw a gun flash three times with no report. But
with the noise these longhorns are makin' now, I doubt if I could
a-heard a six-gun bark if I pulled the trigger myself, an' the next
thing I know me an' my hoss goes over a bank, lightin' safe. I guess it
ain't over four feet, but it seems like fifty in the darkness, an' if
it hadn't been for my chin-string I'd a-went from under my hat. Again
the light shows me we're in a 'royo with the cattle comin' over the
edge, wigglin' an' squirmin' like army worms.</p>

<p>"It's a case of all night riding. Sometimes they'll mill an' quiet
down, then start trottin' an' break into a run. Not till daybreak do
they stop, an' maybe you think old day ain't welcome. My hoss is sure
leg-weary, an' I ain't so rollicky myself. When she gets light enough I
begin lookin' for Longrope, with nary a sign of him; an' the herd, you
wouldn't know they were the same cattle smeared with mud an' ga'nt as
greyhounds; some of 'em with their tongues still lollin' out from their
night's run. But sizin' up the bunch, I guess I got 'em all. I'm kind
of worried about Longrope. It's a cinch that wherever he is he's afoot,
an' chances is he's layin' on the prairie with a broken leg.</p>

<p>"The cattle's spread out, an' they begin feedin'. There ain't much
chance of losin' 'em, now it's broad daylight, so I ride up on a raise
to take a look at the back trail. While I'm up there viewin' the
country, my eyes run onto somethin' a mile back in a draw. I can't make
it out, but get curious, so spurrin' my tired hoss into a lope I take
the back trail. 'Tain't no trouble to foller in the mud; it's plain as
plowed ground. I ain't rode three hundred yard till the country raises
a little an' shows me this thing's a hoss, an' by the white streak on
his flank I heap savvy it's Peon that's the hoss Longrope's ridin'.
When I get close he whinners pitiful like; he's lookin' for sympathy,
an' I notice, when he turns to face me, his right foreleg's broke. He's
sure a sorry sight with that fancy, full-stamped center-fire saddle
hangin' under his belly in the mud. While I'm lookin' him over, my hoss
cocks his ears to the right, snortin' low. This scares me I'm afeared
to look. Somethin' tells me I won't see Longrope, only part of him that
part that stays here on earth when the man's gone. Bracin' up, I foller
my hoss's ears, an' there in the holler of the 'royo is a patch of
yeller; it's part of a slicker. I spur up to get a better look over the
bank, an' there tromped in the mud is all there is left of Longrope.
Pullin' my gun I empty her in the air. This brings the boys that are
follerin' on the trail from the bed-ground. Nobody'd had to tell 'em
we'd had hell, so they come in full force, every man but the cook an'
hoss-wrangler."</p>

<p><b>"PULLIN' MY GUN, I EMPTY HER IN THE AIR"</b></p>
</center>

<p>"Nobody feels like talkin'. It don't matter how rough men are I've
known 'em that never spoke without cussin', that claimed to fear
neither God, man, nor devil but let death visit camp an' it puts 'em
thinkin'. They generally take their hats off to this old boy that comes
everywhere an' any time. He's always ready to pilot you willin' or not
over the long dark trail that folks don't care to travel. He's never
welcome, but you've got to respect him.</p>

<p>"'It's tough damned tough,' says Spanish, raisin' poor Long-rope's
head an' wipin the mud from his face with his neck-handkerchief,
tender, like he's feared he'll hurt him. We find his hat tromped in the
mud not fur from where he's layin'. His scabbard's empty, an' we never
do locate his gun.</p>

<p>"That afternoon when we're countin' out the herd to see if we're
short any, we find a steer with a broken shoulder an' another with a
hole plumb through his nose. Both these is gun wounds; this accounts
for them flashes I see in the night. It looks like, when Longrope gets
mixed in the mill, he tries to gun his way out, but the cattle crowd
him to the bank an' he goes over. The chances are he was dragged from
his hoss in a tangle of horns.</p>

<p>"Some's for takin' him to Dodge an' gettin' a box made for him, but
Old Spanish says: 'Boys, Longrope is a prairie man, an' if she was a
little rough at times, she's been a good foster mother. She cared for
him while he's awake, let her nurse him in his sleep.' So we wrapped
him in his blankets, an' put him to bed.</p>

<p>"It's been twenty years or more since we tucked him in with the
end-gate of the bed-wagon for a headstone, which the cattle have long
since rubbed down, leavin' the spot unmarked. It sounds lonesome, but
he ain't alone, 'cause these old prairies has cradled many of his kind
in their long sleep."</p>
