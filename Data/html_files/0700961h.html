  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Until he was nearly arrived at manhood, it did not become
clear to Kipps
  how it was that he had come into the care of an aunt and uncle instead of
  having a father and mother like other little boys. He had vague memories of a
  somewhere else, a dim room, a window looking down on white buildings, and of
  a some one else who talked to forgotten people and who was his mother. He
  could not recall her features very distinctly, but he remembered with extreme
  definition a white dress she wore, with a pattern of little sprigs of flowers
  and little bows upon it, and a girdle of straight-ribbed white ribbon about
  the waist. Linked with this, he knew not how, were clouded half-obliterated
  recollections of scenes in which there was weeping, weeping in which he was
  inscrutably moved to join. Some terrible tall man with a loud voice played a
  part in these scenes, and, either before or after them, there were
  impressions of looking for interminable periods out of the window of railway
  trains in the company of these two people.</p>

  <p>He knew, though he could not remember that he had ever been told, that a
  certain faded wistful face that looked at him from a plush and gilt framed
  daguerreotype above the mantel of the 'sitting-room' was the face of his
  mother. But that knowledge did not touch his dim memories with any
  elucidation. In that photograph she was a girlish figure, leaning against a
  photographer's stile, and with all the self-conscious shrinking natural to
  that position. She had curly hair and a face far younger and prettier than
  any other mother in his experience. She swung a Dolly Varden hat by the
  string, and looked with obedient, respectful eyes on the
  photographer-gentleman who had commanded the pose. She was very slight and
  pretty. But the phantom mother that haunted his memory so elusively was not
  like that, though he could not remember how she differed.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she was older or a little less shrinking, or, it may be, only
  dressed in a different way...It is clear she handed him over to his aunt and
  uncle at New Romney with explicit directions and a certain endowment. One
  gathers she had something of that fine sense of social distinctions that
  subsequently played so large a part in Kipps' career. He was not to go to a
  'Common' school, she provided, but to a certain seminary in Hastings, that
  was not only a 'middle-class academy' with mortar-boards and every evidence
  of a higher social tone, but also remarkably cheap. She seems to have been
  animated by the desire to do her best for Kipps even at a certain sacrifice
  of herself, as though Kipps were in some way a superior sort of person. She
  sent pocket-money to him from time to time for a year or more after Hastings
  had begun for him, but her face he never saw in the days of his lucid
  memory.</p>

  <p>His aunt and uncle were already high on the hill of life when first he
  came to them. They had married for comfort in the evening or, at any rate, in
  the late afternoon of their days. They were at first no more then vague
  figures in the background of proximate realities, such realities as familiar
  chairs and tables, quiet to ride and drive, the newel of the staircase,
  kitchen furniture, pieces of firewood, the boiler tap, old newspapers, the
  cat, the High Street, the back-yard and the flat fields that are always so
  near in that little town. He knew all the stones in the yard individually,
  the creeper in the corner, the dust-bin and the mossy wall, better than many
  men know the faces of their wives. There was a corner under the ironing-board
  which, by means of a shawl, could be made, under propitious gods, a very
  decent cubby-house, a corner that served him for several years as the
  indisputable hub of the world, and the stringy places in the carpet, the
  knots upon the dresser, and the several corners of the rag hearthrug his
  uncle had made, became essential parts of his mental foundations. The shop he
  did not know so thoroughly; it was a forbidden region to him, yet somehow he
  managed to know it very well.</p>

  <p>His aunt and uncle were, as it were, the immediate gods of this world,
  and, like the gods of the world of old, occasionally descended right into it,
  with arbitrary injunctions and disproportionate punishments. And, unhappily,
  one rose to their Olympian level at meals. Then one had to say one's 'grace,'
  hold one's spoon and fork in mad, unnatural ways called 'properly,' and
  refrain from eating even nice, sweet things 'too fast.' If he 'gobbled' there
  was trouble, and at the slightest abandon with knife, fork, and spoon his
  aunt rapped his knuckles, albeit his uncle always finished up his gravy with
  his knife. Sometimes, moreover, his uncle would come pipe in hand out of a
  sedentary remoteness in the most disconcerting way when a little boy was
  doing the most natural and attractive things, with 'Drat and drabbit that
  young rascal! What's he a-doing of now?' and his aunt would appear at door or
  window to interrupt interesting conversation with children who were upon
  unknown grounds considered 'low' and undesirable, and call him in. The
  pleasantest little noises, however softly you did them, drumming on
  tea-trays, trumpeting your fists, whistling on keys, ringing chimes with a
  couple of pails, or playing tunes on the window-panes, brought down the gods
  in anger. Yet what noise is fainter than your finger on the
  window&mdash;gently done? Sometimes, however, these gods gave him broken toys
  out of the shop, and then one loved them better&mdash;for the shop they kept
  was, among other things, a toy-shop. (The other things included books to read
  and books to give away, and local photographs; it had some pretentions to be
  a china-shop and the fascia spoke of glass; it was also a stationer's shop
  with a touch of haberdashery about it, and in the windows and odd corners
  were mats and terra-cotta dishes and milking-stools for painting, and there
  was a hint of picture-frames, and firescreens, and fishing-tackle, and
  air-guns and bathing-suits, and tents&mdash;various things, indeed, but all
  cruelly attractive to a small boy's fingers.) Once his aunt gave him a
  trumpet if he would promise faithfully not to blow it, and afterwards took it
  away again. And his aunt made him say his catechism, and something she
  certainly called the 'Colic for the Day,' every Sunday in the year.</p>

  <p>As the two grew old as he grew up, and as his impression of them modified
  insensibly from year to year, it seemed to him at last that they had always
  been as they were when in his adolescent days his impression of things grew
  fixed; his aunt he thought of as always lean, rather worried looking, and
  prone to a certain obliquity of cap, and his uncle massive, many chinned, and
  careless about his buttons. They neither visited nor received visitors. They
  were always very suspicious about their neighbours and other people
  generally; they feared the 'low' and they hated and despised the 'stuck up'
  and so they 'kept themselves to themselves,' according to the English ideal.
  Consequently Little Kipps had no playmates, except through the sin of
  disobedience. By inherent nature he had a sociable disposition. When he was
  in the High Street he made a point of saying 'Hallo!' to passing cyclists,
  and he would put his tongue out at the Quodling children whenever their
  nursemaid was not looking. And he began a friendship with Sid Pornick, the
  son of the haberdasher next door, that, with wide intermissions, was destined
  to last his lifetime through.</p>

  <p>Pornick, the haberdasher, I may say at once, was, according to old Kipps,
  a 'blaring jackass'; he was a teetotaller, a 'nyar, nyar, 'im-singing
  Methodis',' and altogether distasteful and detrimental, he and his together,
  to true Kipps ideals so far as little Kipps could gather them. This Pornick
  certainly possessed an enormous voice, and he annoyed old Kipps greatly by
  calling 'You&mdash;Arn' and 'Siddee' up and down his house. He annoyed old
  Kipps by private choral services on Sunday, all his family, 'nyar, nyar'-ing;
  and by mushroom culture, by behaving as though the pilaster between the two
  shops was common property, by making a noise of hammering in the afternoon
  when old Kipps wished to be quiet after his midday meal, by going up and down
  uncarpeted stairs in his boots, by having a black beard, by attempting to be
  friendly, and by&mdash;all that sort of thing. In fact, he annoyed old Kipps.
  He annoyed him especially with his shop-door mat. Old Kipps never beat his
  mat, preferring to let sleeping dust lie, and seeking a motive for a foolish
  proceeding, he held that Pornick waited until there was a suitable wind in
  order that the dust disengaged in that operation might defile his neighbour's
  shop. These issues would frequently develop into loud and vehement quarrels,
  and on one occasion came so near to violence as to be subsequently described
  by Pornick (who read his newspaper) as a 'Disgraceful Frackass.' On that
  occasion he certainly went into his own shop with extreme celerity.</p>

  <p>But it was through one of these quarrels that the friendship of little
  Kipps and Sid Pornick came about. The two small boys found themselves one day
  looking through the gate at the doctor's goats together; they exchanged a few
  contradictions about which goat could fight which, and then young Kipps was
  moved to remark that Sid's father was a 'blaring jackess.' Sid said he
  wasn't, and Kipps repeated that he was, and quoted his authority. Then Sid,
  flying off at a tangent rather alarmingly, said he could fight young Kipps
  with one hand, an assertion young Kipps with a secret want of confidence
  denied. There were some vain repetitions, and the incident might have ended
  there, but happily a sporting butcher boy chanced on the controversy at this
  stage, and insisted upon seeing fair play.</p>

  <p>The two small boys, under his pressing encouragement, did at last button
  up their jackets, square, and fight an edifying drawn battle until it seemed
  good to the butcher boy to go on with Mrs. Holyer's mutton. Then, according
  to his directions and under his experienced stage management, they shook
  hands and made it up. Subsequently a little tear-stained, perhaps, but
  flushed with the butcher boy's approval ('tough little kids'), and with cold
  stones down their necks as he advised, they sat side by side on the doctor's
  gate, projecting very much behind, staunching an honourable bloodshed, and
  expressing respect for one another. Each had a bloody nose and a black
  eye&mdash;three days later they matched to a shade&mdash;neither had given
  in, and, though this was tacit, neither wanted any more.</p>

  <p>It was an excellent beginning. After this first encounter the attributes
  of their parents and their own relative value in battle never rose between
  them, and if anything was wanted to complete the warmth of their regard it
  was found in a joint dislike of the eldest Quodling. The eldest Quodling
  lisped, had a silly sort of straw hat and a large pink face (all covered over
  with self-satisfaction), and he went to the National school with a
  green-baize bag&mdash;a contemptible thing to do. They called him names and
  threw stones at him, and when he replied by threatenings ('Look 'ere, young
  Art Kipth, you better thtoppit!') they were moved to attack, and put him to
  fight.</p>

  <p>And after that they broke the head of Ann Pornick's doll, so that she went
  home weeping loudly&mdash;a wicked and endearing proceeding. Sid was whacked,
  but, as he explained, he wore a newspaper tactically adjusted during the
  transaction, and really it didn't hurt him at all...And Mrs. Pornick put her
  head out of the shop door suddenly and threatened Kipps as he passed.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">'Cavendish Academy,' the school that had won the limited
choice of Kipps'
  vanished mother, was established in a battered private house in the part of
  Hastings remotest from the sea; it was called an Academy for Young Gentlemen,
  and many of the young gentlemen had parents in 'India' and other unverifiable
  places. Others were the sons of credulous widows, anxious, as Kipps' mother
  had been, to get something a little 'superior' to a board school education as
  cheaply as possible, and others, again, were sent to demonstrate the dignity
  of their parents and guardians. And of course there were boys from
  France.</p>

  <p>Its 'principal' was a lean, long creature of indifferent digestion and
  temper, who proclaimed himself on a gilt-lettered board in his front area,
  George Garden Woodrow, F.S.Sc., letters indicating that he had paid certain
  guineas for a bogus diploma. A bleak, white-washed outhouse constituted his
  schoolroom, and the scholastic quality of its carved and worn desks and forms
  was enhanced by a slippery blackboard and two large, yellow, out-of-date
  maps&mdash;one of Africa and the other of Wiltshire&mdash;that he had picked
  up cheap at a sale. There were other maps and globes in his study, where he
  interviewed inquiring parents, but these his pupils never saw. And in a glass
  cupboard in the passage were several shillings-worth of test-tubes and
  chemicals, a tripod, a glass retort, and a damaged Bunsen burner, manifesting
  that the 'Scientific laboratory' mentioned in the prospectus was no idle
  boast.</p>

  <p>This prospectus, which was in dignified but incorrect English, laid
  particular stress on the sound preparation for a commercial career given in
  the Academy, but the army, navy, and civil service were glanced at in an
  ambiguous sentence. There was something vague in the prospectus about
  'examinational successes'&mdash;though Woodrow, of course, disapproved of
  'cram'&mdash;and a declaration that the curriculum included 'art,' 'modern
  foreign languages,' and 'a sound technical and scientific training.' Then
  came insistence upon the 'moral well-being' of the pupils, and an emphatic
  boast of the excellence of the religious instruction, 'so often neglected
  nowadays even in schools of wide repute.'</p>

  <p>'That's bound to fetch 'em,' Mr. Woodrow had remarked when he drew up the
  prospectus. And in conjunction with the mortar-boards it certainly did.
  Attention was directed to the 'motherly' care of Mrs. Woodrow, in reality a
  small, partially effaced woman with a plaintive face and a mind above
  cookery, and the prospectus concluded with a phrase intentionally vague,
  'Fare unrestricted, and our own milk and produce.'</p>

  <p>The memories Kipps carried from that school into afterlife were set in an
  atmosphere of stuffiness and mental muddle, and included countless pictures
  of sitting on creaking forms, bored and idle; of blot licking and the taste
  of ink; of torn books with covers that set one's teeth on edge; of the slimy
  surface of the laboured slates; of furtive marble-playing, whispered story-
  telling, and of pinches, blows, and a thousand such petty annoyances being
  perpetually 'passed on' according to the custom of the place; of standing up
  in class and being hit suddenly and unreasonably for imaginary misbehaviour;
  of Mr. Woodrow's raving days, when a scarcely sane injustice prevailed; of
  the cold vacuity of the hour of preparation before the bread-and-butter
  breakfast; and of horrible headaches and queer, unprecedented internal
  feelings, resulting from Mrs. Woodrow's motherly rather than intelligent
  cookery. There were dreary walks when the boys marched two by two, all
  dressed in the mortar-board caps that so impressed the widowed mothers; there
  were dismal half-holidays when the weather was wet, and the spirit of evil
  temper and evil imagination had the pent boys to work its will on; there were
  unfair, dishonourable fights, and miserable defeats and victories; there was
  bullying and being bullied. A coward boy Kipps particularly afflicted, until
  at last he was goaded to revolt by incessant persecution, and smote Kipps to
  tolerance with whirling fists. There were memories of sleeping three in a
  bed; of the dense, leathery smell of the school-room when one returned
  thither after ten minutes' play; of a playground of mud and incidental sharp
  flints. And there was much furtive foul language.</p>

  <p>'Our Sundays are our happiest days,' was one of Woodrow's formulae with
  the inquiring parent, but Kipps was not called in evidence. They were to him
  terrible gaps of inanity, no work, no play, a dreary expanse of time with the
  mystery of church twice and plum-duff once in the middle. The afternoon was
  given up to furtive relaxations, among which 'Torture Chamber' games with the
  less agreeable weaker boys figured. It was from the difference between this
  day and common days that Kipps derived his first definite conceptions of the
  nature of God and Heaven. His instinct was to evade any closer acquaintance
  as long as he could.</p>

  <p>The solid work varied, according to the prevailing mood of Mr. Woodrow.
  Sometimes that was a despondent lethargy, copy-books were distributed or sums
  were 'set,' or the great mystery of book-keeping was declared in being, and
  beneath these superficial activities lengthy conversations and interminable
  guessing games with marbles went on, while Mr. Woodrow sat inanimate at his
  desk, heedless of school affairs, staring in front of him at unseen things.
  At times his face was utterly inane; at times it had an expression of
  stagnant amazement, as if he saw before his eyes with pitiless clearness the
  dishonour and mischief of his being...</p>

  <p>At other times the F.S.Sc., roused himself to action, and would stand up a
  wavering class and teach it, goading it with bitter mockery and blows through
  a chapter of Ahn's 'First French Course'; or, 'France and the French,' or a
  dialogue about a traveller's washing or the parts of an opera house. His own
  knowledge of French had been obtained years ago in another English private
  school, and he had refreshed it by occasional weeks of loafing and mean
  adventure in Dieppe. He would sometimes in their lessons hit upon some
  reminiscence of these brighter days, and then he would laugh inexplicably and
  repeat French phrases of an unfamiliar type.</p>

  <p>Among the commoner exercises he prescribed the learning of long passages
  of poetry from a 'Potry Book,' which he would delegate an elder boy to 'hear'
  and there was reading aloud from the Holy Bible, verse by verse&mdash;it was
  none of your 'godless' schools!&mdash;so that you counted the verses up to
  your turn and then gave yourself to conversation; and sometimes one read from
  a cheap History of this land. They did, as Kipps reported, 'loads of
  catechism.' Also there was much learning of geographical names and lists, and
  sometimes Woodrow, in an outbreak of energy, would see these names were
  actually found in a map. And once, just once, there was a chemistry
  lesson&mdash;a lesson of indescribable excitement&mdash;glass things of the
  strangest shape, a smell like bad eggs, something bubbling in something, a
  smash and stench, and Mr. Woodrow saying quite distinctly&mdash;they threshed
  it out in the dormitory afterwards&mdash;'Damn!' Followed by the whole school
  being kept in, with extraordinary severities, for an hour...</p>

  <p>But interspersed with the memories of this gray routine were certain
  patches of brilliant colour, the Holidays, his holidays, which, in spite of
  the feud between their seniors, he spent as much as possible with Sid
  Pornick, the son of the irascible black-bearded haberdasher next door. They
  seemed to be memories of a different world. There were glorious days of
  'mucking about' along the beach, the siege of unresisting Martello towers,
  the incessant interest of the mystery and motion of windmills, the windy
  excursions with boarded feet over the yielding shingle to Dungeness
  lighthouse&mdash;Sid Pornick and he far adrift from reality, smugglers and
  armed men from the moment they left Great Stone behind them&mdash;wanderings
  in the hedgeless, reedy marsh, long excursions reaching even to Hythe, where
  the machine-guns of the Empire are for ever whirling and tapping, and to Rye
  and Winchelsea perched like dream-cities on their little hills. The sky in
  these memories was the blazing hemisphere of the marsh heaven in summer, or
  its wintry tumult of sky and sea; and there were wrecks, real wrecks, in it
  (near Dymchurch pitched high and blackened and rotting were the ribs of a
  fishing smack, flung aside like an empty basket when the sea had devoured its
  crew), and there was bathing all naked in the sea, bathing to one's armpits,
  and even trying to swim in the warm sea-water (spite of his aunt's
  prohibition) and (with her indulgence) the rare eating of dinner from a paper
  parcel miles away from home. Cake and cold ground-rice puddin' with plums it
  used to be&mdash;there is no better food at all. And for the background, in
  the place of Woodrow's mean and fretting rule, were his aunt's spare but
  frequently quite amiable figure&mdash;for though she insisted on his
  repeating the English Church catechism every Sunday, she had an easy way over
  dinners that one wanted to take abroad&mdash;and his uncle, corpulent and
  irascible, but sedentary and easily escaped. And freedom!</p>

  <p>The holidays were, indeed, very different from school. They were free,
  they were spacious, and though he never knew it in these words&mdash;they had
  an element of beauty. In his memory of his boyhood they shone like strips of
  stained-glass window in a dreary waste of scholastic wall, they grew brighter
  and brighter as they grew remoter. There came a time at last and moods when
  he could look back to them with a feeling akin to tears.</p>

  <p>The last of these windows was the brightest, and instead of the
  kaleidoscopic effect of its predecessors its glory was a single figure. For
  in the last of his holidays before the Moloch of Retail Trade got hold of
  him, Kipps made his first tentative essays at the mysterious shrine of Love.
  Very tentative they were, for he had become a boy of subdued passions, and
  potential rather than actual affectionateness.</p>

  <p>And the object of these first stirrings of the great desire was no other
  than Ann Pornick, the head of whose doll he and Sid had broken long ago, and
  rejoiced over long ago, in the days when he had yet to learn the meaning of a
  heart.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Negotiations were already on foot to make Kipps into a
draper before he
  discovered the lights that lurked in Ann Pornick's eyes. School was over,
  absolutely over, and it was chiefly present to him that he was never to go to
  school again. It was high summer. The 'breaking up' of school had been
  hilarious; and the excellent maxim, 'Last Day's Pay Day,' had been observed
  by him with a scrupulous attention to his honour. He had punched the heads of
  all his enemies, wrung wrists and kicked shins; he had distributed all his
  unfinished copy-books, all his school books, his collection of marbles, and
  his mortar-board cap among such as loved him; and he had secretly written in
  obscure pages of their books 'remember Art Kipps.' He had also split the
  anaemic Woodrow's cane, carved his own name deeply in several places about
  the premises, and broken the scullery window. He had told everybody so often
  that he was to learn to be a sea captain, that he had come almost to believe
  the thing himself. And now he was home, and school was at an end for him for
  evermore.</p>

  <p>He was up before six on the day of his return, and out in the hot sunlight
  of the yard. He set himself to whistle a peculiarly penetrating arrangement
  of three notes, supposed by the boys of the Hastings Academy and himself and
  Sid Pornick, for no earthly reason whatever, to be the original Huron
  war-cry. As he did this he feigned not to be doing it, because of the hatred
  between his uncle and the Pornicks, but to be examining with respect and
  admiration a new wing of the dustbin recently erected by his uncle&mdash;a
  pretence that would not have deceived a nestling tom-tit.</p>

  <p>Presently there came a familiar echo from the Pornick hunting-ground. Then
  Kipps began to sing, 'Ar pars eight tra-la, in the lane be'ind the church.'
  To which an unseen person answered, 'Ar pars eight it is, in the lane be'ind
  the church.' The 'tra-la' was considered to render the sentence
  incomprehensible to the uninitiated. In order to conceal their operations
  still more securely, both parties to this duet then gave vent to a
  vocalisation of the Huron war-cry again, and after a lingering repetition of
  the last and shrillest note, dispersed severally, as became boys in the
  enjoyment of holidays, to light the house fires for the day.</p>

  <p>Half-past eight found Kipps sitting on the sunlit gate at the top of the
  long lane that runs towards the sea, clashing his boots in a slow rhythm, and
  whistling with great violence all that he knew of an excruciatingly pathetic
  air. There appeared along by the churchyard wall a girl in a short frock,
  brown-haired, quick-coloured, and with dark blue eyes. She had grown so that
  she was a little taller than Kipps, and her colour had improved. He scarcely
  remembered her, so changed was she since last holidays&mdash;if, indeed, he
  had seen her during his last holidays, a thing he could not clearly
  recollect.</p>

  <p>Some vague emotion arose at the sight of her. He stopped whistling and
  regarded her, oddly tongue-tied. 'He can't come,' said Ann, advancing boldly.
  'Not yet.'</p>

  <p>'What&mdash;not Sid?'</p>

  <p>'No. Father's made him dust all his boxes again.'</p>

  <p>'What for?'</p>

  <p>'I dunno. Father's in a stew's morning.'</p>

  <p>'Oh!'</p>

  <p>Pause. Kipps looked at her, and then was unable to look at her again. She
  regarded him with interest. 'You left school?' she remarked, after a
  pause.</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'So's Sid.'</p>

  <p>The conversation languished. Ann put her hands on the top of the gate, and
  began a stationary hopping, a sort of ineffectual gymnastic experiment.</p>

  <p>'Can you run?' she said presently. 'Run you any day,' said Kipps. 'Gimme a
  start?'</p>

  <p>'Where for?' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>Ann considered, and indicated a tree. She walked towards it and turned.
  'Gimme to here?' she called. Kipps, standing now and touching the gate,
  smiled to express conscious superiority. 'Farther!' he said.</p>

  <p>'Here?'</p>

  <p>'Bit more!' said Kipps; and then, repenting of his magnanimity, said
  'Orf!' suddenly, and so recovered his lost concession.</p>

  <p>They arrived abreast at the tree, flushed and out of breath. 'Tie!' said
  Ann, throwing her hair back from her face with her hand. 'I won,' panted
  Kipps. They disputed firmly, but quite politely. 'Run it again then,' said
  Kipps.' I don't mind.'</p>

  <p>They returned towards the gate.</p>

  <p>'You don't run bad,' said Kipps, temperately, expressing sincere
  admiration. 'I'm pretty good, you know.' Ann sent her hair back by an expert
  toss of the head. 'You give me a start,' she allowed.</p>

  <p>They became aware of Sid approaching them. 'You better look out, young
  Ann', said Sid, with that irreverent want of sympathy usual in brothers. 'You
  have been out nearly 'arf-'our. Nothing ain't been done upstairs. Father said
  he didn't know where you was, but when he did he'd warm y'r young ear.'</p>

  <p>Ann prepared to go.</p>

  <p>'How about that race?' asked Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Lor!' cried Sid, quite shocked. 'You ain't been racing her!'</p>

  <p>Ann swung herself round the end to the gate with her eyes on Kipps, and
  then turned away suddenly and ran off down the lane. Kipps' eyes tried to go
  after her, and came back to Sid's.</p>

  <p>'I give her a lot of start,' said Kipps apologetically. 'It wasn't a
  proper race.' And so the subject was dismissed. But Kipps was distrait for
  some seconds perhaps, and the mischief had begun in him.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">They proceeded to the question of how two accomplished
Hurons might most
  satisfactorily spend the morning. Manifestly their line lay straight along
  the lane to the sea. 'There's a new wreck,' said Sid, 'and my!&mdash;don't it
  stink just!'</p>

  <p>'Stink?'</p>

  <p>'Fair make you sick. It's rotten wheat.'</p>

  <p>They fell to talking of wrecks, and so came to ironclads and wars and
  such-like manly matters. Half-way to the wreck Kipps made a casual,
  irrelevant remark.</p>

  <p>'Your sister ain't a bad sort,' he said off-handedly.</p>

  <p>'I clout her a lot,' said Sidney modestly; and, after a pause, the talk
  reverted to more suitable topics.</p>

  <p>The new wreck was full of rotting grain, and stank abominably, even as Sid
  had said. This was excellent. They had it all to themselves. They took
  possession of it in force, at Sid's suggestion, and had speedily to defend it
  against enormous numbers of imaginary 'natives,' who were at last driven off
  by loud shouts of bang bang, and vigorous thrusting and shoving of sticks.
  Then, also at Sid's direction, they sailed with it into the midst of a
  combined French, German, and Russian fleet, demolishing the combination
  unassisted, and having descended to the beach, clambered up the side and cut
  out their own vessel in brilliant style; they underwent a magnificent
  shipwreck (with vocalised thunder) and floated 'waterlogged'&mdash;so Sid
  insisted&mdash;upon an exhausted sea.</p>

  <p>These things drove Ann out of mind for a time. But at last, as they
  drifted without food or water upon a stagnant ocean, haggard-eyed, chins
  between their hands, looking in vain for a sail, she came to mind again
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>'It's rather nice 'aving sisters,' remarked one perishing mariner.</p>

  <p>Sid turned round and regarded him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'Not it!' he said.</p>

  <p>'No?'</p>

  <p>'Not a bit of it.'</p>

  <p>He grinned confidentially. 'Know too much,' he said, and afterwards, 'get
  out of things.'</p>

  <p>He resumed his gloomy scrutiny of the hopeless horizon. Presently he fell
  spitting jerkily between his teeth, as he had read was the way with such ripe
  manhood as chews its quid.</p>

  <p>'Sisters,' he said, 'is rot. That's what sisters are. Girls, if you like,
  but sisters&mdash;No!'</p>

  <p>'But ain't sisters girls?'</p>

  <p>'N-eaow!' said Sid, with unspeakable scorn; and Kipps answered, 'Of
  course, I didn't mean&mdash;I wasn't thinking of that.'</p>

  <p>'You got a girl?' asked Sid, spitting very cleverly again.</p>

  <p>Kipps admitted his deficiency. He felt compunction.</p>

  <p>'You don't know who my girl is, Art Kipps, I bet.'</p>

  <p>'Who is, then?' asked Kipps, still chiefly occupied by his own poverty.
  'Ah!'</p>

  <p>Kipps let a moment elapse before he did his duty. 'Tell us!' Sid eyed him
  and hesitated.</p>

  <p>'Secret?' he said.</p>

  <p>'Secret.'</p>

  <p>'Dying solemn?'</p>

  <p>'Dying solemn!' Kipps' self-concentration passed into curiosity.</p>

  <p>Sid administered a terrible oath.</p>

  <p>Sid adhered lovingly to his facts. 'It begins with a Nem,' he said, doling
  it out parsimoniously. 'M-A-U-D,' he spelt, with a stern eye on Kipps.
  'C-H-A-R-T-E-R-I-S.'</p>

  <p>Now, Maud Charteris was a young person of eighteen and the daughter of the
  vicar of St. Bavon's&mdash;besides which, she had a bicycle&mdash;so that as
  her name unfolded, the face of Kipps lengthened with respect. 'Get out,' he
  gasped incredulously. 'She ain't your girl, Sid Pornick.'</p>

  <p>'She is!' answered Sid stoutly.</p>

  <p>'What&mdash;truth?'</p>

  <p>'Truth.'</p>

  <p>Kipps scrutinised his face. 'Reely?'</p>

  <p>Sid touched wood, whistled, and repeated a binding doggerel with great
  solemnity.</p>

  <p>Kipps still struggled with the amazing new light on the world about him.
  'D'you mean&mdash;she knows?'</p>

  <p>Sid flushed deeply, and his aspect became stern and gloomy. He resumed his
  wistful scrutiny of the sunlit sea. 'I'd die for that girl, Art Kipps,' he
  said presently; and Kipps did not press a question he felt to be ill-timed.
  I'd do anything she asked me to do,' said Sid; 'just anything. If she was to
  ask me to chuck myself into the sea.' He met Kipps' eye. 'I would,' he
  said.</p>

  <p>They were pensive for a space, and then Sid began to discourse in
  fragments of Love, a theme upon which Kipps had already in a furtive way
  meditated a little, but which, apart from badinage, he had never yet heard
  talked about in the light of day. Of course, many and various aspects of life
  had come to light in the muffled exchange of knowledge that went on under the
  shadow of Woodrow, but this of Sentimental Love was not among them. Sid, who
  was a boy with an imagination, having once broached this topic, opened his
  heart, or, at any rate, a new chamber of his heart, to Kipps, and found no
  fault with Kipps for a lack of return. He produced a thumbed novelette that
  had played a part in his sentimental awakening; he proffered it to Kipps, and
  confessed there was a character in it, a baronet, singularly like himself.
  This baronet was a person of volcanic passions, which he concealed beneath a
  demeanour of 'icy cynicism.' The utmost expression he permitted himself was
  to grit his teeth, and, now his attention was called to it, Kipps remarked
  that Sid also had a habit of gritting his teeth, and, indeed, had had all the
  morning. They read for a time, and presently Sid talked again. The conception
  of love, Sid made evident, was compact of devotion and much spirited fighting
  and a touch of mystery, but through all that cloud of talk there floated
  before Kipps a face that was flushed and hair that was tossed aside.</p>

  <p>So they budded, sitting on the blackening old wreck in which men had lived
  and died, looking out to sea, talking of that other sea upon which they must
  presently embark.</p>

  <p>They ceased to talk, and Sid read; but Kipps, falling behind with the
  reading, and not wishing to admit that he read slowlier than Sid, whose
  education was of the inferior Elementary School brand, lapsed into
  meditation.</p>

  <p>'I would like to 'ave a girl,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'I mean just to talk to, and all that&mdash;'</p>

  <p>A floating sack distracted them at last from this obscure topic. They
  abandoned the wreck, and followed the new interest a mile along the beach,
  bombarding it with stones until it came to land. They had inclined to a view
  that it would contain romantic mysteries, but it was simply an ill-preserved
  kitten&mdash;too much even for them. And at last they were drawn dinner-ward,
  and went home hungry and pensive side by side.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">But Kipps' imagination had been warmed by that talk of
love, and in the
  afternoon when he saw Ann Pornick in the High Street and said 'Hallo!' it was
  a different 'hallo' from that of their previous intercourse. And when they
  had passed they both looked back and caught each other doing so. Yes, he did
  want a girl badly&mdash;</p>

  <p>Afterwards he was distracted by a traction engine going through the town,
  and his aunt had got some sprats for supper. When he was in bed, however,
  sentiment came upon him again in a torrent quite abruptly and abundantly, and
  he put his head under the pillow and whispered very softly, 'I love Ann
  Pornick,' as a sort of supplementary devotion.</p>

  <p>In his subsequent dreams he ran races with Ann, and they lived in a wreck
  together, and always her face was flushed and her hair about her face. They
  just lived in a wreck and ran races, and were very, very fond of one another.
  And their favourite food was rock chocolate, dates, such as one buys off
  barrows, and sprats&mdash;fried sprats&mdash;</p>

  <p>In the morning he could hear Ann singing in the scullery next door. He
  listened to her for some time, and it was clear to him that he must put
  things before her.</p>

  <p>Towards dusk that evening they chanced on one another out by the gate by
  the church, but though there was much in his mind, it stopped there with a
  resolute shyness until he and Ann were out of breath catching cockchafers and
  were sitting on that gate of theirs again. Ann sat up upon the gate, dark
  against vast masses of flaming crimson and darkling purple, and her eyes
  looked at Kipps from a shadowed face. There came a stillness between them,
  and quite abruptly he was moved to tell his love.</p>

  <p>'Ann,' he said, 'I do like you. I wish you was my girl '...'I say, Ann.
  Will you be my girl?'</p>

  <p>Ann made no pretence of astonishment. She weighed the proposal for a
  moment with her eyes on Kipps. 'If you like, Artie,' she said lightly. 'I
  don't mind if I am.'</p>

  <p>'All right,' said Kipps, breathless with excitement, 'then you are.'</p>

  <p>'All right,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>Something seemed to fall between them, they no longer looked openly at one
  another. 'Lor!' cried Ann, suddenly, 'see that one!' and jumped down and
  darted after a cockchafer that had boomed within a yard of her face. And with
  that they were girl and boy again...</p>

  <p>They avoided their new relationship painfully.</p>

  <p>They did not recur to it for several days, though they met twice. Both
  felt that there remained something before this great experience was to be
  regarded as complete; but there was an infinite diffidence about the next
  step. Kipps talked in fragments of all sorts of matters, telling particularly
  of the great things that were being done to make a man and a draper of him;
  how he had two new pairs of trousers and a black coat and four new shirts.
  And all the while his imagination was urging him to that unknown next step,
  and when he was alone and in the dark he became even an enterprising wooer.
  It became evident to him that it would be nice to take Ann by the hand; even
  the decorous novelettes Sid affected egged him on to that greater nearness of
  intimacy.</p>

  <p>Then a great idea came to him, in a paragraph called 'Lover's Tokens' that
  he read in a torn fragment of Tit-Bits. It fell in to the measure of his
  courage&mdash;a divided sixpence! He secured his aunt's best scissors, fished
  a sixpence out of his jejune tin money-box, and jabbed his finger in a varied
  series of attempts to get it in half. When they met again the sixpence was
  still undivided. He had not intended to mention the matter to her at that
  stage, but it came up spontaneously. He endeavoured to explain the theory of
  broken sixpences and his unexpected failure to break one.</p>

  <p>'But what you break it for?' said Ann. 'It's no good if it's broke.'</p>

  <p>'It's a Token,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Like&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you keep half and I keep half, and when we're sep'rated, you look at
  your half and I look at mine&mdash;see? Then we think of each other.'</p>

  <p>'Oh!' said Ann, and appeared to assimilate this information.</p>

  <p>'Only, I can't get it in 'arf nohow,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>They discussed this difficulty for some time without illumination. Then
  Ann had a happy thought.</p>

  <p>'Tell you what,' she said, starting away from him abruptly and laying a
  hand on his arm, 'you let me 'ave it, Artie. I know where father keeps his
  file.'</p>

  <p>Kipps handed her the sixpence, and they came upon a pause. 'I'll easy do
  it,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>In considering the sixpence side by side, his head had come near her
  cheek. Quite abruptly he was moved to take his next step into the unknown
  mysteries of love. 'Ann,' he said, and gulped at his temerity, 'I do love
  you. Straight. I'd do anything for you, Ann. Reely&mdash;I would.'</p>

  <p>He paused for breath. She answered nothing, but she was no doubt enjoying
  herself. He came yet closer to her, his shoulder touched hers. 'Ann, I wish
  you'd&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He stopped.</p>

  <p>'What?' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Ann&mdash;lemme kiss you.'</p>

  <p>Things seemed to hang for a space; his tone, the drop of his courage made
  the thing incredible as he spoke. Kipps was not of that bold order of wooers
  who impose conditions.</p>

  <p>Ann perceived that she was not prepared for kissing after all. Kissing,
  she said, was silly, and when Kipps would have displayed a belated enterprise
  she flung away from him. He essayed argument. He stood afar off as it
  were&mdash;the better part of a yard&mdash;and said she might let him kiss
  her, and then that he didn't see what good it was for her to be his girl if
  he couldn't kiss her...</p>

  <p>She repeated that kissing was silly. A certain estrangement took them
  homeward. They arrived in the dusky High Street not exactly together, and not
  exactly apart, but straggling. They had not kissed, but all the guilt of
  kissing was between them. When Kipps saw the portly contours of his uncle
  standing dimly in the shop doorway his footsteps faltered, and the space
  between our young couple increased. Above, the window over Pornick's shop was
  open, and Mrs. Pornick was visible, taking the air. Kipps assumed an
  expression of extreme innocence. He found himself face to face with his
  uncle's advanced outposts of waistcoat buttons.</p>

  <p>'Where ye bin, my boy?'</p>

  <p>'Bin for a walk, uncle.'</p>

  <p>'Not along of that brat of Pornick's?'</p>

  <p>'Along of who?'</p>

  <p>'That gell'&mdash;indicating Ann with his pipe. 'Oh, no,
  uncle!'&mdash;very faintly.</p>

  <p>'Run in, my boy.' Old Kipps stood aside, with an oblique glance upward,
  and his nephew brushed clumsily by him and vanished out of sight of the
  street into the vague obscurity of the little shop. The door closed behind
  old Kipps with a nervous jangle of its bell, and he set himself to light the
  single oil-lamp that illuminated his shop at nights. It was an operation
  requiring care and watching, or else it flared and 'smelt.' Often it smelt
  after all. Kipps, for some reason, found the dusky living-room with his aunt
  in it too populous for his feelings, and went upstairs.</p>

  <p>'That brat of Pornick's!' It seemed to him that a horrible catastrophe had
  occurred. He felt he had identified himself inextricably with his uncle and
  cut himself off from her for ever by saying 'Oh, no!' At supper he was so
  visibly depressed that his aunt asked him if he wasn't feeling well. Under
  this imminent threat of medicine he assumed an unnatural cheerfulness...</p>

  <p>He lay awake for nearly half an hour that night, groaning because things
  had all gone wrong, because Ann wouldn't let him kiss her, and because his
  uncle had called her a brat. It seemed to Kipps almost as though he himself
  had called her a brat...</p>

  <p>There came an interval during which Ann was altogether inaccessible. One,
  two, three days passed and he did not see her. Sid he met several times; they
  went fishing and twice they bathed, but though Sid lent and received back two
  further love stories, they talked no more of love. They kept themselves in
  accord, however, agreeing that the most flagrantly sentimental story was
  'proper.' Kipps was always wanting to speak of Ann, and never daring to do
  so. He saw her on Sunday evening going off to chapel. She was more beautiful
  than ever in her Sunday clothes, but she pretended not to see him because her
  mother was with her. But he thought she pretended not to see him because she
  had given him up for ever. Brat!&mdash;who could be expected ever to forgive
  that? He abandoned himself to despair, he ceased even to haunt the places
  where she might be found...</p>

  <p>With paralysing unexpectedness came the end.</p>

  <p>Mr. Shalford, the draper at Folkestone to whom he was to be bound
  apprentice, had expressed a wish to 'shape the lad a bit' before the autumn
  sale. Kipps became aware that his box was being packed, and gathered the full
  truth of things on the evening before his departure. He became feverishly
  eager to see Ann just once more. He made silly and needless excuses to go out
  into the yard, he walked three times across the street without any excuse at
  all to look up at the Pornick windows. Still she was hidden. He grew
  desperate. It was within half an hour of his departure that he came on
  Sid.</p>

  <p>'Hallo!' he said, 'I'm orf!'</p>

  <p>'Business?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>Pause.</p>

  <p>'I say, Sid. You going 'ome?'</p>

  <p>'Straight now.'</p>

  <p>'D'you mind&mdash;. Ask Ann about that.'</p>

  <p>'About what?'</p>

  <p>'She'll know.'</p>

  <p>And Sid said he would. But even that, it seemed, failed to evoke Ann.</p>

  <p>At last the Folkestone bus rumbled up, and he ascended. His aunt stood in
  the doorway to see him off. His uncle assisted with the box and portmanteau.
  Only furtively could he glance up at the Pornick windows and still it seemed
  Ann hardened her heart against him. 'Get up!' said the driver, and the hoofs
  began to clatter. No&mdash;she would not come out even to see him off. The
  bus was in motion, and old Kipps was going back into his shop. Kipps stared
  in front of him, assuring himself that he did not care.</p>

  <p>He heard a door slam, and instantly craned out his neck to look back. He
  knew that slam so well. Behold! out of the haberdasher's door a small, untidy
  figure in homely pink print had shot resolutely into the road and was
  sprinting in pursuit. In a dozen seconds she was abreast of the bus. At the
  sight of her Kipps' heart began to beat very quickly, but he made no
  immediate motion of recognition.</p>

  <p>'Artie!' she cried breathlessly. 'Artie! Artie! You know! I got that!'</p>

  <p>The bus was already quickening its pace and leaving her behind again, when
  Kipps realised what 'that' meant. He became animated, he gasped, and gathered
  his courage together and mumbled an incoherent request to the driver to 'stop
  jest a jiff for sunthin'. The driver grunted, as the disparity of their years
  demanded, and then the bus had pulled up and Ann was below.</p>

  <p>She leapt up upon the wheel. Kipps looked down into Ann's face, and it was
  foreshortened and resolute. He met her eyes just for one second as their
  hands touched. He was not a reader of eyes. Something passed quickly from
  hand to hand, something that the driver, alert at the corner of his eye, was
  not allowed to see. Kipps hadn't a word to say, and all she said was, 'I done
  it, 'smorning.' It was like a blank space in which something pregnant should
  have been written and wasn't. Then she dropped down, and the bus moved
  forward.</p>

  <p>After the lapse of about ten seconds, it occurred to him to stand and wave
  his new bowler hat at her over the corner of the bus top, and to shout
  hoarsely, 'Goo'-bye, Ann! Don' forget me&mdash;while I'm away!'</p>

  <p>She stood in the road looking after him, and presently she waved her
  hand.</p>

  <p>He remained standing unstably, his bright, flushed face looking back at
  her and his hair fluffing in the wind, and he waved his hat until at last the
  bend of the road hid her from his eyes. Then he turned about and sat down,
  and presently he began to put the half-sixpence he held clenched in his hand
  into his trouser-pocket. He looked sideways at the driver to judge how much
  he had seen.</p>

  <p>Then he fell a-thinking. He resolved that, come what might, when he came
  back to New Romney at Christmas, he would, by hook or by crook, kiss Ann.</p>

  <p>Then everything would be perfect and right, and he would be perfectly
  happy.</p>

<a id="chap12"
     name="chap12"></a>II. &mdash; THE EMPORIUM</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">When Kipps left New Romney, with a small yellow tin box, a
still smaller
  portmanteau, a new umbrella, and a keepsake half-sixpence, to become a
  draper, he was a youngster of fourteen, thin, with whimsical drakes'-tails at
  the pole of his head, smallish features, and eyes that were sometimes very
  light and sometimes very dark, gifts those of his birth; and by the nature of
  his training he was indistinct in his speech, confused in his mind, and
  retreating in his manners. Inexorable fate had appointed him to serve his
  country in commerce, and the same national bias towards private enterprise
  and leaving bad alone, which had left his general education to Mr. Woodrow,
  now indentured him firmly into the hands of Mr. Shalford of the Folkestone
  Drapery Bazaar. Apprenticeship is still the recognised English way to the
  distributing branch of the social service. If Mr. Kipps had been so
  unfortunate as to have been born a German he might have been educated in an
  elaborate and costly special school ('over-educated&mdash;crammed
  up'&mdash;old Kipps) to fit him for his end&mdash;such being their pedagogic
  way.</p>

  <p>He might&mdash;But why make unpatriotic reflections in a novel? There was
  nothing pedagogic about Mr. Shalford.</p>

  <p>He was an irascible, energetic little man with hairy hands, for the most
  part under his coat-tails, a long, shiny, bald head, a pointed aquiline nose
  a little askew, and a neatly trimmed beard. He walked lightly and with a
  confident jerk, and he was given to humming. He had added to exceptional
  business 'push,' bankruptcy under the old dispensation, and judicious
  matrimony. His establishment was now one of the most considerable in
  Folkestone, and he insisted on every inch of frontage by alternate stripes of
  green and yellow down the house over the shops. His shops were numbered 3, 5,
  and 7 on the street, and on his bill-heads 3 to 7. He encountered the abashed
  and awe-stricken Kipps with the praises of his System and himself. He spread
  himself out behind his desk with a grip on the lapel of his coat, and made
  Kipps a sort of speech. 'We expect y'r to work, y'r know, and we expect y'r
  to study our interests,' explained Mr. Shalford, in the regal and commercial
  plural.</p>

  <p>'Our System here is the best system y'r could have. I made it, and I ought
  to know. I began at the very bottom of the ladder when I was fourteen, and
  there isn't a step in it I don't know. Not a step. Mr. Booch in the desk will
  give y'r the card of rules and fines. Jest wait a minute.' He pretended to be
  busy with some dusty memoranda under a paper-weight, while Kipps stood in a
  sort of paralysis of awe regarding his new master's oval baldness. 'Two
  thous'n three forty-seven pounds,' whispered Mr. Shalford audibly, feigning
  forgetfulness of Kipps. Clearly a place of great transactions!</p>

  <p>Mr. Shalford rose, and, handing Kipps a blotting-pad and an inkpot to
  carry, mere symbols of servitude, for he made no use of them, emerged into a
  counting-house where three clerks had been feverishly busy ever since his
  door-handle had turned. 'Booch,' said Mr. Shalford, "ave y'r copy of the
  Rules?' and a downtrodden, shabby little old man, with a ruler in one hand
  and a quill pen in his mouth, silently held out a small book with green and
  yellow covers, mainly devoted, as Kipps presently discovered, to a voracious
  system of Fines. He became acutely aware that his hands were full and that
  everybody was staring at him. He hesitated a moment before putting the inkpot
  down to free a hand.</p>

  <p>'Mustn't fumble like that,' said Mr. Shalford as Kipps pocketed the Rules.
  'Won't do here. Come along, come along,' cocked his coat-tails high, as a
  lady might hold up her dress, and led the way into the shop.</p>

  <p>A vast, interminable place it seemed to Kipps, with unending shining
  counters and innumerable faultlessly dressed young men and, presently, Houri-
  like young women staring at him. Here there was a long vista of gloves
  dangling from overhead rods, there ribbons and baby linen. A short young lady
  in black mittens was making out the account of a customer, and was clearly
  confused in her addition by Shalford's eagle eye.</p>

  <p>A thick-set young man with a bald head and a round very wise face, who was
  profoundly absorbed in adjusting all the empty chairs down the counter to
  absolutely equal distances, awoke out of his preoccupation and answered
  respectfully to a few Napoleonic and quite unnecessary remarks from his
  employer. Kipps was told that this young man's name was Mr. Buggins, and that
  he was to do whatever Mr. Buggins told him to do.</p>

  <p>They came round a corner into a new smell, which was destined to be the
  smell of Kipps' life for many years, the vague, distinctive smell of
  Manchester goods. A fat man with a large nose jumped&mdash;actually
  jumped&mdash;at their appearance, and began to fold a pattern of damask in
  front of him exactly like an automaton that is suddenly set going. 'Carshot,
  see to this boy tomorrow,' said the master. 'See he don't fumble. Smart'n
  'im-up.'</p>

  <p>'Yussir,' said Carshot fatly, glanced at Kipps, and resumed his pattern-
  folding with extreme zeal.</p>

  <p>'Whatever Mr. Carshot says y'r to do, ye do,' said Mr. Shalford, trotting
  onward; and Carshot blew out his face with an appearance of relief.</p>

  <p>They crossed a large room full of the strangest things Kipps had ever
  seen. Lady-like figures, surmounted by black, wooden knobs in the place of
  the refined heads one might have reasonably expected stood about with a
  lifelike air of conscious fashion. 'Costume Room,' said Shalford. Two voices
  engaged in some sort of argument&mdash;'I can assure you, Miss Mergle, you
  are entirely mistaken&mdash;entirely, in supposing I should do anything so
  unwomanly,'&mdash;sank abruptly, and they discovered two young ladies, taller
  and fairer than any of the other young ladies, and with black trains to their
  dresses, who were engaged in writing at a little table. Whatever they told
  him to do Kipps gathered he was to do. He was also, he understood, to do
  whatever Carshot and Booch told him to do. And there were also Buggins and
  Mr. Shalford. And not to forget or fumble!</p>

  <p>They descended into a cellar called The Warehouse, and Kipps had an
  optical illusion of errand-boys fighting. Some aerial voice said 'Teddy!' and
  the illusion passed. He looked again, and saw quite clearly that they were
  packing parcels, and always would be, and that the last thing in the world
  that they would or could possibly do was to fight. Yet he gathered from the
  remarks Mr. Shalford addressed to their busy backs that they had been
  fighting&mdash;no doubt at some past period of their lives.</p>

  <p>Emerging in the shop again among a litter of toys and what are called
  'fancy articles,' Shalford withdrew a hand from beneath his coat-tails to
  indicate an overhead change carrier. He entered into elaborate calculations
  to show how many minutes in one year were saved thereby, and lost himself
  among the figures. 'Seven turns eight seven nine&mdash;was it? Or seven eight
  nine? Now, now! Why, when I was a boy your age I c'd do a sum like that as
  soon as hear it. We'll soon get y'r into better shape than that. Make you
  Fishent. Well, y'r must take my word it comes to pounds and pounds saved in
  the year&mdash;pounds and pounds. System! System everywhere. Fishency.' He
  went on murmuring 'Fishency' and 'System' at intervals for some time. They
  passed into a yard, and Mr. Shalford waved his hand to his three delivery
  vans, all striped green and yellow&mdash;'uniform&mdash;green,
  yell'r&mdash;System.' All over the premises were pinned absurd little cards,
  'This door locked after 7.30. By order, Edwin Shalford,' and the like.</p>

  <p>Mr. Shalford always wrote 'By Order,' though it conveyed no earthly
  meaning to him. He was one of those people who collect technicalities upon
  them as the Reduvius bug collects dirt. He was the sort of man who is not
  only ignorant but absolutely incapable of English. When he wanted to say he
  had a sixpenny-ha'penny longcloth to sell, he put it thus to startled
  customers: 'Can DO you one six half, if y'like.' He always omitted pronouns
  and articles and so forth; it seemed to him the very essence of the
  efficiently business-like. His only preposition was 'as' or the compound 'as
  per.' He abbreviated every word he could; he would have considered himself
  the laughingstock of Wood Street if he had chanced to spell socks in any way
  but 'sox.' But, on the other hand, if he saved words here he wasted them
  there; he never acknowledged an order that was not an esteemed favour, nor
  sent a pattern without begging to submit it. He never stipulated for so many
  months' credit, but bought in November 'as Jan.' It was not only words he
  abbreviated in his London communications. In paying his wholesalers his
  'System' admitted of a constant error in the discount of a penny or twopence,
  and it 'facilitated business,' he alleged, to ignore odd pence in the cheques
  he wrote. His ledger clerk was so struck with the beauty of this part of the
  System that he started a private one on his own account with the stampbox
  that never came to Shalford's knowledge.</p>

  <p>This admirable British merchant would glow with a particular pride of
  intellect when writing his London orders.</p>

  <p>'Ah! do y'r think you'll ever be able to write London orders?' he would
  say with honest pride to Kipps, waiting impatiently long after closing-time
  to take these triumphs of commercial efficiency to post, and so end the
  interminable day.</p>

  <p>Kipps shook his head, anxious for Mr. Shalford to get on.</p>

  <p>'Now, here, f'example, I've written&mdash;see? '1 piece 1 in, cott blk
  elas 1/or'; what do I mean by that or&mdash;eh? d'ye know?'</p>

  <p>Kipps promptly hadn't the faintest idea.</p>

  <p>'And then, '2 ea silk net as per patts herewith'; ea&mdash;eh?'</p>

  <p>'Dunno, sir.'</p>

  <p>It was not Mr. Shalford's way to explain things. 'Dear, dear!</p>

  <p>Pity you couldn't get some c'mercial education at your school. 'Stid of
  all this lit'ry stuff. Well, my boy, if y'r not a bit sharper, y'll never
  write London orders, that's pretty plain. Jest stick stamps on all those
  letters and mind y'r stick 'em right way up, and try and profit a little more
  by the opportunities your aunt and uncle have provided ye. Can't say what'll
  happen t'ye if ye don't.' And Kipps, tired, hungry, and belated, set about
  stamping with vigour and dispatch.</p>

  <p>'Lick the envelope,' said Mr. Shalford, 'lick the envelope, as though he
  grudged the youngster the postage-stamp gum. 'It's the little things mount
  up,' he would say and, indeed, that was his philosophy of life&mdash;to
  hustle and save, always to hustle and save. His political creed linked
  Reform, which meant nothing, with Peace and Economy, which meant a sweated
  expenditure, and his conception of a satisfactory municipal life was to 'keep
  down the rates.' Even his religion was to save his soul and to preach a
  similar cheeseparing to the world.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">The indentures that bound Kipps to Mr. Shalford were
antique and complex;
  they insisted on the latter gentleman's parental privileges, they forbade
  Kipps to dice and game, they made him over, body and soul, to Mr. Shalford
  for seven long years, the crucial years of his life. In return there were
  vague stipulations about teaching the whole art and mystery of the trade to
  him, but as there was no penalty attached to negligence, Mr. Shalford being a
  sound, practical, business man, considered this a mere rhetorical flourish,
  and set himself assiduously to get as much out of Kipps and to put as little
  into him as he could in the seven years of their intercourse.</p>

  <p>What he put into Kipps was chiefly bread and margarine, infusions of
  chicory and tea-dust, colonial meat by contract at threepence a pound,
  potatoes by the sack, and watered beer. If, however, Kipps chose to buy any
  supplementary material for growth, Mr. Shalford had the generosity to place
  his kitchen resources at his disposal free&mdash;if the fire chanced to be
  going. He was also allowed to share a bedroom with eight other young men, and
  to sleep in a bed which, except in very severe weather, could be made, with
  the help of his overcoat and private under-linen, not to mention newspapers,
  quite sufficiently warm for any reasonable soul. In addition, Kipps was
  taught the list of fines, and how to tie up parcels, to know where goods were
  kept in Mr. Shalford's systematised shop, to hold his hands extended upon the
  counter, and to repeat such phrases as 'What can I have the pleasure&mdash;?'
  'No trouble, I assure you,' and the like; to block, fold, and measure
  materials of all sorts, to lift his hat from his head when he passed Mr.
  Shalford abroad, and to practise a servile obedience to a large number of
  people. But he was not, of course, taught the 'cost' mark of the goods he
  sold, nor anything of the method of buying such goods. Nor was his attention
  directed to the unfamiliar social habits and fashions to which his trade
  ministered. The use of half the goods he saw sold and was presently to assist
  in selling he did not understand; materials for hangings, cretonnes,
  chintzes, and the like; serviettes, and all the bright, hard whitewear of a
  well-ordered house; pleasant dress materials, linings, stiffenings; they were
  to him from first to last no more than things, heavy and difficult to handle
  in bulk, that one folded up, unfolded, cut into lengths, and saw dwindle and
  pass away out into that mysterious, happy world in which the Customer dwells.
  Kipps hurried from piling linen table-cloths, that were, collectively, as
  heavy as lead, to eat off oil-cloth in a gas-lit dining-room underground,
  and he dreamt of combing endless blankets beneath his overcoat, spare
  undershirt, and three newspapers, so he had at least the chance of learning
  the beginnings of philosophy.</p>

  <p>In return for these benefits he worked so that he commonly went to bed
  exhausted and footsore. His round began at half past six in the morning, when
  he would descend, unwashed and shirtless, in old clothes and a scarf, and
  dust boxes and yawn, and take down wrappers and clean the windows until
  eight. Then in half an hour he would complete his toilet, and take an austere
  breakfast of bread and margarine and what only an Imperial Englishman wou'd
  admit to be coffee, after which refreshment he ascended to the shop for the
  labours of the day.</p>

  <p>Commonly these began with a mighty running to and fro with planks and
  boxes and goods for Carshot, the window-dresser, who, whether he worked well
  or ill, nagged persistently, by reason of a chronic indigestion, until the
  window was done. Sometimes the costume window had to be dressed, and then
  Kipps staggered down the whole length of the shop from the costume room with
  one after another of those ladylike shapes grasped firmly but shamefully each
  about her single ankle of wood. Such days as there was no window-dressing
  there was a nightly carrying and lifting of blocks and bales of goods into
  piles and stacks. After this there were terrible exercises, at first almost
  despairfully difficult; certain sorts of goods that came in folded had to be
  rolled upon rollers, and for the most part refused absolutely to be rolled,
  at any rate by Kipps; certain other sorts of goods that came from the
  wholesalers rolled had to be measured and folded, and folding makes young
  apprentices wish they were dead. All of it, too, quite avoidable trouble, you
  know, that is not avoided because of the cheapness of the genteeler sorts of
  labour and the dearness of forethought in the world. And then consignments of
  new goods had to be marked off and packed into paper parcels, and Carshot
  packed like conjuring tricks, and Kipps packed like a boy with tastes in some
  other direction&mdash;not ascertained. And always Carshot nagged&mdash;.</p>

  <p>He had a curious formula of appeal to his visceral economy that the
  refinement of our times and the earnest entreaties of my friends oblige me to
  render by an etiolated paraphrase.</p>

  <p>'My Heart and Liver! I never see such a boy,' so I will present Carshot's
  refrain; and even when he was within a foot or so of the customer's face, the
  disciplined ear of Kipps would still at times develop a featureless
  intercalary murmur into&mdash;well, 'My Heart and Liver!'</p>

  <p>There came a blessed interval when Kipps was sent abroad 'matching.' This
  consisted chiefly in supplying unexpected defects in buttons, ribbon, lining,
  and so forth in the dressmaking department. He was given a written paper of
  orders with patterns pinned thereto and discharged into the sunshine and
  interest of the street. Then until he thought it wise to return and stand the
  racket of his delay, he was a free man, clear of all reproach.</p>

  <p>He made remarkable discoveries in topography, as, for example, that the
  most convenient way from the establishment of Mr. Adolphus Davis to the
  establishment of Messrs. Plummer, Roddis, and Tyrrell, two of his principal
  places of call, is not, as is generally supposed, down the Sandgate road, but
  up the Sandgate road, round by West Terrace and along the Leas to the lift,
  watch the lift up and down twice, but not longer, because that wouldn't do,
  back along the Leas, watch the Harbour for a short time, and then round by
  the churchyard, and so (hurrying) into Church Street and Rendezvous Street.
  But on some exceptionally fine days the route lay through Radnor Park to the
  pond where little boys sail ships and there are interesting swans.</p>

  <p>He would return to find the shop settling down to the business of serving
  customers. And now he had to stand by to furnish any help that was necessary
  to the seniors who served, to carry parcels and bills about the shop, to
  clear away 'stuff' after each engagement, to hold up curtains until his arms
  ached, and, what was more difficult than all, to do nothing and not stare
  disconcertingly at customers when there was nothing for him to do. He plumbed
  an abyss of boredom, or stood a mere carcass with his mind far away, fighting
  the enemies of the empire, or steering a dream-ship perilously into unknown
  seas. To be recalled sharply to our higher civilisation by some bustling
  senior's 'Nar then, Kipps. Look alive! Ketch 'old. (My Heart and Liver!)'</p>

  <p>At half-past seven o'clock&mdash;except on late nights&mdash;a feverish
  activity of straightening 'up' began, and when the last shutter was up
  outside, Kipps, with the speed of an arrow leaving a bow, would start hanging
  wrappers over the fixtures and over the piles of wares upon the counters,
  preparatory to a vigorous scattering of wet sawdust and the sweeping out of
  the shop.</p>

  <p>Sometimes people would stay long after the shop was closed. 'They don't
  mind a bit at Shalford's,' these ladies used to say, and while they loitered
  it was forbidden to touch a wrapper or take any measures to conclude the day
  until the doors closed behind them.</p>

  <p>Mr. Kipps would watch these later customers from the shadow of a stack of
  goods, and death and disfigurement was the least he wished for them. Rarely
  much later than nine, a supper of bread and cheese and watered beer awaited
  him downstairs, and, that consumed, the rest of the day was entirely at his
  disposal for reading, recreation, and the improvement of his mind...</p>

  <p>The front door was locked at half-past ten, and the gas in the dormitory
  extinguished at eleven.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">On Sundays he was obliged to go to church once, and
commonly he went
  twice, for there was nothing else to do. He sat in the free seats at the
  back; he was too shy to sing, and not always clever enough to keep his place
  in the Prayer Book, and he rarely listened to the sermon. But he had
  developed a sort of idea that going to church had a tendency to alleviate
  life. His aunt wanted to have him confirmed, but he evaded this ceremony for
  some years.</p>

  <p>In the intervals between services he walked about Folkestone with an air
  of looking for something. Folkestone was not so interesting on Sundays as on
  week-days because the shops were shut; but, on the other hand, there was a
  sort of confusing brilliance along the front of the Leas in the afternoon.
  Sometimes the apprentice next above him would condescend to go with him; but
  when the apprentice next but one above him condescended to go with the
  apprentice next above him, then Kipps, being habited as yet in ready-made
  clothes without tails, and unsuitable, therefore, to appear in such company,
  went alone.</p>

  <p>Sometimes he would strike out into the country&mdash;still as if looking
  for something he missed&mdash;but the rope of meal-times haled him home
  again, and sometimes he would invest the major portion of the weekly
  allowance of a shilling that old Booch handed out to him, in a sacred concert
  on the pier. He would sometimes walk up and down the Leas between twenty and
  thirty times after supper, desiring much the courage to speak to some other
  person in the multitude similarly employed. Almost invariably he ended his
  Sunday footsore.</p>

  <p>He never read a book, there were none for him to read, and, besides, in
  spite of Mr. Woodrow's guidance through a cheap and cheaply annotated edition
  of The Tempest (English Literature), he had no taste that way; he never read
  any newspapers except, occasionally, Tit-Bits or a ha'penny 'comic.' His
  chief intellectual stimulus was an occasional argey-bargey that sprang up
  between Carshot and Buggins at dinner. Kipps listened as if to unparalleled
  wisdom and wit, and treasured all the gems of repartee in his heart against
  the time when he, too, should be a Buggins and have the chance and courage
  for speech.</p>

  <p>At times there came breaks in this routine&mdash;sale-times, darkened by
  extra toil and work past midnight, but brightened by a sprat supper and some
  shillings in the way of 'premiums.' And every year&mdash;not now and then,
  but every year&mdash;Mr. Shalford, with parenthetic admiration of his own
  generosity and glancing comparisons with the austerer days when he was
  apprenticed, conceded Kipps no less than ten days holiday&mdash;ten whole
  days every year! Many a poor soul at Portland might well envy the fortunate
  Kipps. Insatiable heart of man! but how those days were grudged and counted
  as they snatched themselves away from him one after another!</p>

  <p>Once a year came stocktaking, and at intervals gusts of 'marking off'
  goods newly arrived. Then the splendours of Mr. Shalford's being shone with
  oppressive brilliancy. 'System!' he would say, 'system! Come! 'ussel!' and
  issue sharp, confusing, contradictory orders very quickly. Carshot trotted
  about, confused, perspiring, his big nose up in the air, his little eye on
  Mr. Shalford, his forehead crinkled, his lips always going to the formula,
  'Oh, my Heart and Liver!' The smart junior and the second apprentice vied
  with one another in obsequious alacrity. The smart junior aspired to
  Carshot's position and that made him almost violently subservient to
  Shalford. They all snapped at Kipps. Kipps held the blotting-pad and the
  safety inkpot and a box of tickets, and ran and fetched things. If he put the
  ink down before he went to fetch things, Mr. Shalford usually knocked it
  over, and if he took it away Mr. Shalford wanted it before he returned. 'You
  make my tooth ache, Kipps,' Mr. Shalford would say. 'You gimme n'ralgia. You
  got no more System in you than a bad potato.' And at the times when Kipps
  carried off the inkpot Mr. Shalford would become purple in the face, and jab
  round with his dry pen at imaginary inkpots and swear, and Carshot would
  stand and vociferate, and the smart junior would run to the corner of the
  department and vociferate, and the second apprentice would pursue Kipps,
  vociferating, 'Look Alive, Kipps! Look Alive! Ink, Man! Ink!'</p>

  <p>A vague self-disgust that shaped itself as an intense hate of Shalford and
  all his fellow-creatures filled the soul of Kipps during these periods of
  storm and stress. He felt that the whole business was unjust and idiotic, but
  the why and the wherefore was too much for his unfortunate brain. His mind
  was a welter. One desire, the desire to dodge some, at least, of a pelting
  storm of disagreeable comment, guided him through a fumbling performance of
  his duties. His disgust was infinite! It was not decreased by the inflamed
  ankles and sore feet that form a normal incident in the business of making an
  English draper, and the senior apprentice Minton, a gaunt, sullen-faced
  youngster with close-cropped, wiry, black hair, a loose, ugly mouth, and a
  moustache like a smudge of ink, directed his attention to deeper aspects of
  the question and sealed his misery.</p>

  <p>'When you get too old to work they chuck you away,' said Minton. 'Lor! you
  find old drapers everywhere&mdash;tramps, beggars, dock labourers, bus
  conductors&mdash;Quod. Anywhere but in a crib.'</p>

  <p>'Don't they get shops of their own?'</p>

  <p>'Lord! 'Ow are they to get shops of their own? They 'aven't any Capital!
  How's a draper's shopman to save up five hundred pounds even? I tell you it
  can't be done. You got to stick to Cribs until it's over. I tell you we're in
  a blessed drain-pipe, and we've got to crawl along it till we die.'</p>

  <p>The idea that fermented perpetually in the mind of Minton was to 'hit the
  little beggar slap in the eye'&mdash;the little beggar being Mr.
  Shalford&mdash;'and see how his blessed System met that.'</p>

  <p>This threat filled Kipps with splendid anticipations whenever Shalford
  went marking off on Minton's department. He would look at Minton and look at
  Shalford and decide where he would best like Shalford hit...But for reasons
  known to himself Shalford never pished and tushed with Minton as he did at
  the harmless Carshot, and this interesting experiment upon the System was
  never attempted.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">There were times when Kipps would lie awake, all others in
the dormitory
  asleep and snoring, and think dismally of the outlook Minton pictured. Dimly
  he perceived the thing that had happened to him, how the great stupid machine
  of retail trade had caught his life into its wheels, a vast, irresistible
  force which he had neither strength of will nor knowledge to escape. This was
  to be his life until his days should end. No adventures, no glory, no change,
  no freedom. Neither&mdash;though the force of that came home to him
  later&mdash;might he dream of effectual love and marriage. And there was a
  terrible something called the 'swap,' or 'the key of the street,' and 'crib
  hunting,' of which the talk was scanty but sufficient. Night after night he
  would resolve to enlist, to run away to sea, to set fire to the warehouse, or
  drown himself, and morning after morning he rose up and hurried downstairs in
  fear of a sixpenny fine. He would compare his dismal round of servile
  drudgery with those windy, sunlit days at Littlestone, those windows of
  happiness shining ever brighter as they receded. The little figure of Ann
  seemed in all these windows now.</p>

  <p>She, too, had happened on evil things. When Kipps went home for the first
  Christmas after he was bound, that great suspended resolve of his to kiss her
  flared up to hot determination, and he hurried out and whistled in the yard.
  There was a silence, and then old Kipps appeared behind him.</p>

  <p>'It's no good your whistling there, my boy,' said old Kipps in a loud,
  clear tone, designed to be audible over the wall. 'They've cleared out all
  you 'ad any truck with. She's gone as help to Ashford, my boy. Help! Slavey
  is what we used to call 'em, but times are changed. Wonder they didn't say
  lady-'elp while they was about it. It 'ud be like 'em.'</p>

  <p>And Sid&mdash;? Sid had gone too. 'Arrand boy or somethink,' said old
  Kipps. 'To one of these here brasted bicycle shops.'</p>

  <p>'Has 'e?' said Kipps, with a feeling that he had been gripped about the
  chest; and he turned quickly and went indoors.</p>

  <p>Old Kipps, still supposing him present, went on to further observations of
  an anti-Pornick tendency...</p>

  <p>When Kipps got upstairs, safe in his own bedroom, he sat down on the bed
  and stared at nothing. They were caught&mdash;they were all caught. All life
  took on the hue of one perpetual dismal Monday morning. The Hurons were
  scattered, the wrecks and the beach had passed away from him, the sun of
  those warm evenings at Littlestone had set for evermore...</p>

  <p>The only pleasure left for the brief remainder of his holiday after that
  was to think he was not in the shop. Even that was transient. Two more days,
  one more day, half a day. When he went back there were one or two very dismal
  nights indeed. He went so far as to write home some vague intimation of his
  feelings about business and his prospects, quoting Minton, but Mrs. Kipps
  answered him, 'Did he want the Pornicks to say he wasn't good enough to be a
  draper?' This dreadful possibility was, of course, conclusive in the matter.
  'No,' he resolved they should not say he failed at that.</p>

  <p>He derived much help from a 'manly' sermon delivered in an enormous voice
  by a large, fat, sun-red clergyman, just home from a colonial bishopric he
  had resigned on the plea of ill-health, exhorting him that whatever his hand
  found to do, he was to do with all his might, and the revision of his
  catechism preparatory to his confirmation reminded him that it behoved him to
  do his duty in that state of life into which it had pleased God to call
  him.</p>

  <p>After a time the sorrows of Kipps grew less acute, and, save for a
  miracle, the brief tragedy of his life was over. He subdued himself to his
  position even as his church required of him, seeing, moreover, no way out of
  it.</p>

  <p>The earliest mitigation of his lot was that his soles and ankles became
  indurated to the perpetual standing. The next was an unexpected weekly whiff
  of freedom that came every Thursday. Mr. Shalford, after a brave stand for
  what he called 'Innyvishal lib'ty' and the 'Idea of my System,' a stand
  which, he explained, he made chiefly on patriotic grounds, was at last, under
  pressure of certain of his customers, compelled to fall in line with the rest
  of the local Early Closing Association, and Mr. Kipps could emerge in
  daylight and go where he listed for long, long hours. Moreover, Minton, the
  pessimist, reached the end of his appointed time and left&mdash;to enlist in
  a cavalry regiment, and go about this planet leading an insubordinate but
  interesting life that ended at last in an intimate, vivid, and really, you
  know, by no means painful or tragic night grapple in the Terah Valley. In a
  little while Kipps cleaned windows no longer; he was serving customers (of
  the less important sort) and taking goods out on approval, and presently he
  was third apprentice, and his moustache was visible, and there were three
  apprentices whom he might legally snub and cuff. But one was (most
  dishonestly) too big to cuff, in spite of his greener years.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">There came still other distractions, the natural
distractions of
  adolescence, to take his mind off the inevitable. His costume, for example,
  began to interest him more; he began to realise himself as a visible object,
  to find an interest in the costume-room mirrors and the eyes of the girl-
  apprentices.</p>

  <p>In this he was helped by counsel and example. Pearce, his immediate
  senior, was by way of being what was called a Masher, and preached his cult.
  During slack times grave discussions about collars, ties, the cut of trouser-
  legs, and the proper shape of a boot-toe, were held in the Manchester
  department. In due course Kipps went to a tailor, and his short jacket was
  replaced by a morning coat with tails. Stirred by this he purchased at his
  own expense three stand-up collars to replace his former turndown ones. They
  were nearly three inches high, higher than those Pearce wore, and they made
  his neck quite sore, and left a red mark under his ears...So equipped, he
  found himself fit company even for this fashionable apprentice who had now
  succeeded Minton in his seniority.</p>

  <p>Most potent help of all in the business of forgetting his cosmic disaster
  was this, that so soon as he was in tail coats, the young ladies of the
  establishment began to discover that he was no longer a 'horrid little boy.'
  Hitherto they had tossed heads at him and kept him in his place. Now they
  discovered that he was a 'nice boy,' which is next door at least to being a
  'feller,' and in some ways even preferable. It is painful to record that his
  fidelity to Ann failed at their first onset. I am fully sensible how entirely
  better this story would be, from a sentimental point of view, if he had
  remained true to that early love. Only then it would have been a different
  story altogether. And at least Kipps was thus far true, that with none of
  these later loves was there any of that particular quality that linked Ann's
  flushed face and warmth and the inner things of life so inseparably together.
  Though they were not without emotions of various sorts.</p>

  <p>It was one of the young ladies in the costume-room who first showed by her
  manner that he was a visible object and capable of exciting interest. She
  talked to him, she encouraged him to talk to her, she lent him a book she
  possessed, and darned a sock for him and said she would be his elder sister.
  She allowed him to escort her to church with a great air of having induced
  him to go. Then she investigated his eternal welfare, overcame a certain
  affectation of virile indifference to religion, and extorted a promise that
  he would undergo 'confirmation.' This excited the other young lady in the
  costumes, her natural rival, and she set herself with great charm and
  subtlety to the capture of the ripening heart of Kipps. She took a more
  worldly line. She went for a walk with him to the pier on Sunday afternoon,
  and explained to him how a gentleman must always walk 'outside' a lady on a
  pavement, and how all gentlemen wore, or, at least, carried gloves, and
  generally the broad beginnings of the British social ideal. Afterwards the
  ladies exchanged 'words' upon Sabbatical grounds. In this way was the toga
  virilis bestowed on Kipps, and he became recognised as a suitable object for
  that Platonic Eros whose blunted darts devastate even the very highest class
  establishments. In this way, too, did that pervading ambition of the British
  young man to be, if not a 'gentleman,' at least mistakably like one, take
  root in his heart.</p>

  <p>He took to these new interests with a quite natural and personal zest. He
  became initiated into the mysteries of 'flirting' and&mdash;at a slightly
  later stage and with some leading hints from Pearce, who was of a
  communicative disposition in these matters of the milder forms of 'spooning.'
  Very soon he was engaged. Before two years were out he had been engaged six
  times, and was beginning to be rather a desperate fellow, so far as he could
  make out. Desperate, but quite gentlemanly, be it understood, and without let
  or hindrance to the fact that he was in four brief lessons 'prepared' by a
  distant-mannered and gloomy young curate, and 'confirmed' a member of the
  Established Church.</p>

  <p>The engagements in drapery establishments do not necessarily involve a
  subsequent marriage. They are essentially more refined, less coarsely
  practical, and altogether less binding than the engagements of the vulgar
  rich. These young ladies do not like not to be engaged, it is so unnatural,
  and Mr. Kipps was as easy to get engaged to as one could wish. There are,
  from the young lady's point of view, many conveniences in being engaged. You
  get an escort for Church and walks, and so forth. It is not quite the thing
  to walk abroad with a 'feller', much more to 'spoon' with him, when he is
  neither one's fiance nor an adopted brother; it is considered either a little
  fast or else as savouring of the 'walking-out' habits of the servant girls.
  Now, such is the sweetness of human charity, that the shop young lady in
  England has just the same horror of doing anything that savours of the
  servant girl as the lady journalist, let us say, has of anything savouring of
  the shop-girl, or the really quite nice young lady has of anything savouring
  of any sort of girl who has gone down into the economic battlefield to earn
  herself a living...But the very deepest of these affairs was still among the
  shallow places of love, at best it was paddling where it is decreed that men
  must sink or swim. Of the deep and dangerous places, and of the huge, buoyant
  lift of its waves, he tasted nothing. Affairs of clothes and vanities they
  were, jealousies about a thing said, flatteries and mutual boastings,
  climaxes in the answering grasp of hands, the temerarious use of Christian
  names, culminations in a walk, or a near confidence, or a little pressure
  more or less. Close sitting on a seat after twilight with some little
  fondling was, indeed, the boldest of a lover's adventures, the utmost limit
  of his enterprises in the service of that stark Great Lady who is daughter of
  Uranus and the sea. The 'young ladies' who reigned in his heart came and went
  like people in an omnibus; there was the vehicle, so to speak, upon the road,
  and they entered and left it without any cataclysm of emotion. For all that,
  this development of the sex interest was continuously very interesting to
  Kipps, and kept him going as much as anything through all these servile
  years...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">For a tailpiece to this chapter one may vignette a specimen
minute.</p>

  <p>It is a bright Sunday afternoon; the scene is a secluded little seat half-
  way down the front of the Leas, and Kipps is four years older than when he
  parted from Ann. There is a quite perceptible down upon his upper lip, and
  his costume is just as tremendous a 'mash' as lies within his means. His
  collar is so high that it scars his inaggressive jaw-bone, and his hat has a
  curly brim, his tie shows taste, his trousers are modestly brilliant, and his
  boots have light cloth uppers and a button at the side. He jabs at the gravel
  before him with a cheap cane and glances sideways at Flo Bates, the young
  lady from the cash desk. She is wearing a brilliant blouse and a gaily
  trimmed hat. There is an air of fashion about her that might disappear under
  the analysis of a woman of the world, but which is quite sufficient to make
  Kipps very proud to be distinguished as her particular 'feller,' and to be
  allowed at temperate intervals to use her Christian name.</p>

  <p>The conversation is light and gay in the modern style, and Flo keeps on
  smiling, good temper being her special charm.</p>

  <p>'Ye see, you don't mean what I mean,' he is saying.</p>

  <p>'Well, what do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Not what you mean!'</p>

  <p>'Well, tell me.'</p>

  <p>'Ah! That's another story.'</p>

  <p>Pause. They look meaningly at one another.</p>

  <p>'You are a one for being roundabout,' says the lady.</p>

  <p>'Well, you're not so plain, you know.'</p>

  <p>'Not plain?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'You don't mean to say I'm roundabout?'</p>

  <p>'No. I mean to say&mdash;Though&mdash;' Pause.</p>

  <p>'Well?'</p>

  <p>'You're not a bit plain&mdash;you're' (his voice jumps up to a squeak)
  'pretty. See?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, get out!'&mdash;her voice lifts also&mdash;with pleasure.</p>

  <p>She strikes him with her glove, then glances suddenly at a ring upon her
  finger. Her smile disappears momentarily. Another pause. Eyes meet and the
  smile returns.</p>

  <p>'I wish I knew&mdash;' says Kipps. 'Knew&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'Where you got that ring.'</p>

  <p>She lifts the hand with the ring until her eyes just show (very prettily)
  over it. 'You'd just like to know,' she says slowly, and smiles still more
  brightly with the sense of successful effect.</p>

  <p>'I dessay I could guess.'</p>

  <p>'I dessay you couldn't.'</p>

  <p>'Couldn't I?'</p>

  <p>'No!'</p>

  <p>'Guess it in three.'</p>

  <p>'Not the name.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!'</p>

  <p>'Ah!'</p>

  <p>'Well, anyhow, lemme look at it.'</p>

  <p>He looks at it. Pause. Giggles, slight struggle, and a slap on Kipps'
  coat-sleeve. A passer-by appears down the path and she hastily withdraws her
  hand.</p>

  <p>She glances at the face of the approaching man. They maintain a bashful
  silence until he has passed...</p>

<a id="chap13"
     name="chap13"></a>III. &mdash; THE WOODCARVING CLASS</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Though these services to Venus Epipontia, and these studies
in the art of
  dress, did much to distract his thoughts and mitigate his earlier miseries,
  it would be mere optimism to present Kipps as altogether happy. A vague
  dissatisfaction with life drifted about him, and every now and again
  enveloped him like a sea-fog. During these periods it was grayly evident that
  there was something, something vital in life, lacking. For no earthly reason
  that Kipps could discover, he was haunted by a suspicion that life was going
  wrong, or had already gone wrong in some irrevocable way. The ripening
  self-consciousness of adolescence developed this into a clearly felt
  insufficiency. It was all very well to carry gloves, open doors, never say
  'Miss' to a girl, and walk 'outside', but were there not other things,
  conceivably even deeper things, before the complete thing was attained? For
  example, certain matters of knowledge. He perceived great bogs of ignorance
  about him, fumbling traps, where other people, it was alleged, real gentlemen
  and ladies, for example, and the clergy, had knowledge and assurance, bogs
  which it was sometimes difficult to elude. A girl arrived in the millinery
  department who could, she said, speak French and German. She snubbed certain
  advances, and a realisation of inferiority blistered Kipps. But he tried to
  pass the thing off as a joke by saying 'Parlez-vous Francey' whenever he met
  her, and inducing the junior apprentice to say the same.</p>

  <p>He even made some dim, half-secret experiments towards remedying the
  deficiencies he suspected. He spent five shillings on five serial numbers of
  a Home Educator, and bought (and even thought of reading) a Shakespeare and a
  Bacon's 'Advancement of Learning,' and the poems of Herrick from a chap who
  was hard up. He battled with Shakespeare all one Sunday afternoon, and found
  the 'English Literature,' with which Mr. Woodrow had equipped him, had
  vanished down some crack in his mind. He had no doubt it was very splendid
  stuff, but he couldn't quite make out what it was all about. There was an
  occult meaning, he knew, in literature, and he had forgotten it. Moreover, he
  discovered one day, while taunting the junior apprentice with ignorance, that
  his 'rivers of England' had also slipped his memory, and he laboriously
  restored that fabric of rote learning: Ty Wear Tees 'Umber&mdash;'</p>

  <p>I suppose some such phase of discontent is a normal thing in every
  adolescence. The ripening mind seeks something upon which its will may
  crystallise, upon which its discursive emotions, growing more abundant with
  each year of life, may concentrate. For many, though not for all, it takes a
  religious direction; but in those particular years the mental atmosphere of
  Folkestone was exceptionally free from any revivalistic disturbance that
  might have reached Kipps' mental being. Sometimes they fall in love. I have
  known this uneasiness end in different cases in a vow to read one book (not a
  novel) every week, to read the Bible through in a year, to pass in the
  Honours division of the London Matriculation examination, to become an
  accomplished chemist, and never more to tell a lie. It led Kipps finally into
  Technical Education, as we understand it in the south of England.</p>

  <p>It was in the last year of his apprenticeship that he had pursued his
  researches after that missing qualification into the Folkestone Young Men's
  Association, where Mr. Chester Coote prevailed. Mr. Chester Coote was a young
  man of semi-independent means, who inherited a share in a house agency, read
  Mrs. Humphry Ward, and took an interest in social work. He was a
  whitish-faced young man, with a prominent nose, pale blue eyes, and a
  quivering quality in his voice. He was very active upon committees; he was
  very prominent and useful on all social occasions, in evidence upon
  platforms, and upon all those semi-public occasions when the Great descend.
  He lived with an only sister. To Kipps and his kind in the Young Men's
  Association he read a stimulating paper on 'Self-Help.' He said it was the
  noblest of all our distinctive English characteristics, and he was very much
  down upon the 'over-educated' Germans. At the close a young German
  hairdresser made a few commendatory remarks which developed somehow into an
  oration on Hanoverian politics. As he became excited he became guttural and
  obscure; the meeting sniggered cheerfully at such ridiculous English, and
  Kipps was so much amused that he forgot a private project to ask this Chester
  Coote how he might set about a little Self-Help on his own private account in
  such narrow margins of time as the System of Mr. Shalford spared him. But
  afterwards in the night-time it came to him again. It was a few months later,
  and after his apprenticeship was over, and Mr. Shalford had with depreciatory
  observations taken him on as an Improver at twenty pounds a year, that this
  question was revived by a casual article on Technical Education in a morning
  paper that a commercial traveller left behind him. It played the role of the
  word in season. Something in the nature of conversion, a faint sort of
  concentration of purpose, really occurred in him then. The article was
  written with penetrating vehemence, and it stimulated him to the pitch of
  inquiring about the local Science and Art Classes; and after he had told
  everybody in the shop about it, and taken the advice of all who supported his
  desperate resolution, he joined. At first he attended the class in Freehand,
  that being the subject taught on early closing night, and he had already made
  some progress in that extraordinary routine of reproducing freehand 'copies',
  which for two generations has passed with English people for instruction in
  art, when the dates of the classes were changed. Thereby, just as the March
  winds were blowing, he was precipitated into the Woodcarving class, and his
  mind diverted first to this useful and broadening pursuit, and then to its
  teacher.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">The class in woodcarving was an extremely select class,
conducted at that
  time by a young lady named Walshingham; and as this young lady was destined
  by fortune to teach Kipps a great deal more than woodcarving, it will be well
  if the reader gets the picture of her correctly in mind. She was only a year
  or so older than he was, she had a pale, intellectual face, dark gray eyes
  and black hair, which she wore over her forehead in an original and striking
  way that she had adapted from a picture by Rossetti in the South Kensington
  Museum. She was slender, so that without ungainliness she had an effect of
  being tall, and her hands were shapely and white when they came into contrast
  with hands much exercised in rolling and blocking. She dressed in those loose
  and pleasant forms and those soft and tempered shades that arose in England
  in the socialistic-aesthetic epoch, and remain to this day among us as the
  badge of those who read Turgenev's novels, scorn current fiction, and think
  on higher planes. I think she was as beautiful as most beautiful people, and
  to Kipps she was altogether beautiful. She had, Kipps learnt, matriculated at
  London University, an astounding feat to his imagination, and the masterly
  way in which she demonstrated how to prod and worry honest pieces of wood
  into useless and unedifying patterns in relief, extorted his utmost
  admiration.</p>

  <p>At first when Kipps had learnt he was to be taught by a 'girl' he was
  inclined to resent it, the more so as Buggins had recently been very strong
  on the gross injustice of feminine employment. 'We have to keep wives,' said
  Buggins (though, as a matter of fact, he did not keep even one), 'and how are
  we to do it with a lot of girls coming in to take the work out of our
  mouths?' Afterwards, Kipps, in conjunction with Pearce, looked at it from
  another point of view, and thought it would be rather a 'lark.' Finally when
  he saw her, and saw her teaching and coming nearer to him with an impressive
  deliberation, he was breathless with awe and the quality of her dark, slender
  femininity.</p>

  <p>The class consisted of two girls and a maiden lady of riper years, friends
  of Miss Walshingham's, and anxious rather to support her in an interesting
  experiment than to become really expert woodcarvers; an elderly, oldish young
  man with spectacles and a black beard, who never spoke to any one, and who
  was evidently too shortsighted to see his work as a whole; a small boy, who
  was understood to have a 'gift' for wood-carving; and a lodging-house keeper,
  who 'took classes' every winter, she told Mr. Kipps, as though they were a
  tonic, and 'found they did her good.' And occasionally Mr. Chester Coote-
  -refined and gentlemanly&mdash;would come into the class, with or without
  papers, ostensibly on committee business, but in reality to talk to the less
  attractive of the two girl-students, and sometimes a brother of Miss
  Walshingham's, a slender, dark young man with a pale face and fluctuating
  resemblances to the young Napoleon, would arrive just at the end of the
  class-time to see his sister home.</p>

  <p>All these personages impressed Kipps with a sense of inferiority that in
  the case of Miss Walshingham became positively abysmal. The ideas and
  knowledge they appeared to have, their personal capacity and freedom, opened
  a new world to his imagination. These people came and went with a sense of
  absolute assurance, against an overwhelming background of plaster casts,
  diagrams and tables, benches and a blackboard, a background that seemed to
  him to be saturated with recondite knowledge and the occult and jealously
  guarded tips and secrets that constitute Art and the Higher Life. They went
  home, he imagined, to homes where the piano was played with distinction and
  freedom, and books littered the tables and foreign languages were habitually
  used. They had complicated meals, no doubt. They 'knew etiquette,' and how to
  avoid all the errors for which Kipps bought penny manuals&mdash;'What to
  Avoid,' 'Common Errors in Speaking,' and the like. He knew nothing about it
  all, nothing whatever; he was a creature of the outer darkness blinking in an
  unsuspected light.</p>

  <p>He heard them speak easily and freely to one another of examinations, of
  books and paintings, of 'last year's Academy'&mdash;a little
  contemptuously&mdash;and once, just at the end of the class-time, Mr. Chester
  Coote and young Walshingham and the two girls argued about something or other
  called, he fancied, 'Vagner,' or 'Vargner'&mdash;they seemed to say it both
  ways&mdash;and which presently shaped itself more definitely as the name of a
  man who made up music. (Carshot and Buggins weren't in it with them.) Young
  Walshingham, it appeared, said something or other that was an 'epigram,' and
  they all applauded him. Kipps, I say, felt himself a creature of outer
  darkness, an inexcusable intruder in an altitudinous world. When the epigram
  happened he first of all smiled to pretend he understood, and instantly
  suppressed the smile to show he did not listen. Then he became extremely hot
  and uncomfortable, though nobody had noticed either phase.</p>

  <p>It was clear his only chance of concealing his bottomless baseness was to
  hold his tongue, and meanwhile he chipped with earnest care and abased his
  soul before the very shadow of Miss Walshingham. She used to come and direct
  and advise him, with, he felt, an effort to conceal the scorn she had for
  him, and, indeed, it is true that at first she thought of him chiefly as the
  clumsy young man with the red ears.</p>

  <p>And as soon as he emerged from the first effect of pure and awe-stricken
  humility&mdash;he was greatly helped to emerge from that condition to a
  perception of human equality by the need the lodging-house keeper was under
  to talk while she worked, and as she didn't like Miss Walshingham and her
  friends very much, and the young man with spectacles was deaf, she naturally
  talked to Kipps&mdash;he perceived that he was in a state of adoration for
  Miss Walshingham that it seemed almost a blasphemous familiarity to speak of
  as being in love.</p>

  <p>This state, you must understand, had nothing to do with 'flirting' or
  'spooning' and that superficial passion that flashes from eye to eye upon the
  Leas and Pier&mdash;absolutely nothing. That he knew from the first. Her
  rather pallid, intellectual young face beneath those sombre clouds of hair
  put her in a class apart; towards her the thought of 'attentions' paled and
  vanished. To approach such a being, to perform sacrifices and to perish
  obviously for her, seemed the limit he might aspire to, he or any man. For if
  his love was abasement, at any rate it had this much of manliness that it
  covered all his sex. It had not yet come to Kipps to acknowledge any man as
  his better in his heart of hearts. When one does that the game is played, and
  one grows old indeed.</p>

  <p>The rest of his sentimental interests vanished altogether in this great
  illumination. He meditated about her when he was blocking cretonne, her image
  was before his eyes at teatime, and blotted out the more immediate faces and
  made him silent and pre-occupied and so careless in his bearing that the
  junior apprentice, sitting beside him, mocked at and parodied his enormous
  bites of bread and butter unreproved. He became conspicuously less popular on
  the 'fancy' side, the 'costumes' was chilly with him and the 'millinery'
  cutting. But he did not care. An intermittent correspondence with Flo Bates,
  that had gone on since she left Mr. Shalford's desk for a position at
  Tunbridge, 'nearer home,' and which had roused Kipps in its earlier stages to
  unparalleled heights of epistolary effort, died out altogether by reason of
  his neglect. He heard with scarcely a pang that, as a consequence, perhaps,
  of his neglect, Flo was 'carrying on with a chap who managed a farm.'</p>

  <p>Every Thursday he jabbed and gouged at his wood, jabbing and gouging
  intersecting circles and diamond traceries, and that laboured inane which our
  mad world calls ornament, and he watched Miss Walshingham furtively whenever
  she turned away. The circles, in consequence, were jabbed crooked, and his
  panels, losing their symmetry, became comparatively pleasing to the untrained
  eye&mdash;and once he jabbed his finger. He would cheerfully have jabbed all
  his fingers if he could have found some means of using the opening to express
  himself of the vague emotions that possessed him. But he shirked conversation
  just as earnestly as he desired it; he feared that profound general ignorance
  of his might appear.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">There came a time when she could not open one of the
classroom windows.
  The man with the black beard pored over his chipping heedlessly...</p>

  <p>It did not take Kipps a moment to grasp his opportunity. He dropped his
  gouge and stepped forward. 'Lem me,' he said...</p>

  <p>He could not open the window either! 'Oh, please don't trouble,' she said.
  'Sno trouble,' he gasped.</p>

  <p>Still the sash stuck. He felt his manhood was at stake. He gathered
  himself together for a tremendous effort, and the pane broke with a snap, and
  he thrust his hand into the void beyond.</p>

  <p>'There!' said Miss Walshingham, and the glass fell ringing into the
  courtyard below.</p>

  <p>Then Kipps made to bring his hand back and felt the keen touch of the edge
  of the broken glass at his wrist. He turned dolefully. 'I'm tremendously
  sorry,' he said, in answer to the accusation in Miss Walshingham's eyes. 'I
  didn't think it would break like that'&mdash;as if he had expected it to
  break in some quite different and entirely more satisfactory manner. The boy
  with the gift for woodcarving, having stared at Kipps' face for a moment,
  became involved in a Laocoon struggle with a giggle.</p>

  <p>'You've cut your wrist,' said one of the girl friends, standing up and
  pointing. She was a pleasant-faced, greatly freckled girl, with a helpful
  disposition, and she said, 'You've cut your wrist' as brightly as if she had
  been a trained nurse.</p>

  <p>Kipps looked down and saw a swift line of scarlet rush down his hand. He
  perceived the other man-student regarding this with magnified eyes. 'You have
  cut your wrist,' said Miss Walshingham; and Kipps regarded his damage with
  greater interest.</p>

  <p>'He's cut his wrist,' said the maiden lady to the lodging-house keeper,
  and seemed in doubt what a lady should do.</p>

  <p>'It's&mdash;' she hesitated at the word 'bleeding,' and nodded to the
  lodging-house keeper instead. 'Dreadfully,' said the maiden lady, and tried
  to look and tried not to look at the same time.</p>

  <p>'Of course he's cut his wrist,' said the lodging-house keeper, momentarily
  quite annoyed at Kipps; and the other young lady, who thought Kipps rather
  common, went on quietly with her wood-cutting with an air of its being the
  proper thing to do&mdash;though nobody else seemed to know it.</p>

  <p>'You must tie it up,' said Miss Walshingham.</p>

  <p>'We must tie it up,' said the freckled girl.</p>

  <p>'I 'adn't the slightest idea that window was going to break like that,'
  said Kipps, with candour. 'Nort the slightest.'</p>

  <p>He glanced again at the blood on his wrist, and it seemed to him that it
  was on the very point of dropping on the floor of that cultured class-room.
  So he very neatly licked it off, feeling at the same time for his
  handkerchief. 'Oh, don't!' said Miss Walshingham as he did so, and the girl
  with the freckles made a movement of horror. The giggle got the better of the
  boy with the gift, and celebrated its triumph by unseemly noises, in spite of
  which it seemed to Kipps at the moment that the act that had made Miss
  Walshingham say, 'Oh, don't!' was rather a desperate and manly treatment of
  what was, after all, a creditable injury.</p>

  <p>'It ought to be tied up,' said the lodging-house keeper, holding her
  chisel upright in her hand. 'It's a bad cut to bleed like that.'</p>

  <p>'We must tie it up,' said the freckled girl, and hesitated in front of
  Kipps. 'Have you got a handkerchief?' she said.</p>

  <p>'I dunno 'ow I managed not to bring one,' said Kipps. 'I&mdash;Not 'aving
  a cold, I suppose some 'ow I didn't think&mdash;!' He checked a further flow
  of blood.</p>

  <p>The girl with the freckles caught Miss Walshingham's eye and held it for a
  moment. Both glanced at Kipps' injury. The boy with the gift, who had
  reappeared with a chastened expression from some noisy pursuit beneath his
  desk, made the neglected motions of one who proffers shyly. Miss Walshingham,
  under the spell of the freckled girl's eye, produced a handkerchief. The
  voice of the maiden lady could be heard in the background: 'I've been through
  all the technical education Ambulance classes twice, and I know you go so if
  it's a vein, and so if it's an artery&mdash;at least you go so for one, and
  so for the other, whichever it may be&mdash;but...'</p>

  <p>'If you will give me your hand,' said the freckled girl; and proceeded,
  with Miss Walshingham's assistance, to bandage Kipps in a most businesslike
  way. Yes, they actually bandaged Kipps. They pulled up his
  cuffs&mdash;happily they were not a very frayed pair&mdash;and held his wrist
  and wrapped the soft handkerchief round it, and tightened the knot together.
  And Miss Walshingham's face, the face of that almost divine Over-human came
  close to the face of Kipps.</p>

  <p>'We're not hurting you, are we?' she said.</p>

  <p>'Not a bit,' said Kipps, as he would have said if they had been sawing his
  arm off. 'We're not experts, you know,' said the freckled girl.</p>

  <p>'I'm sure it's a dreadful cut,' said Miss Walshingham.</p>

  <p>'It ain't much, reely,' said Kipps; 'and you're taking a lot of trouble.
  I'm sorry I broke that window. I can't think what I could have been
  doing.'</p>

  <p>'It isn't so much the cut at the time, it's the poisoning afterwards,'
  came the voice of the maiden lady. 'Of course, I'm quite willing to pay for
  the window,' panted Kipps opulently.</p>

  <p>'We must make it just as tight as possible to stop the bleeding,' said the
  freckled girl.</p>

  <p>'I don't think it's much, reely,' said Kipps. 'I'm awful sorry I broke
  that window, though.'</p>

  <p>Tut your finger on the knot, dear,' said the freckled girl.</p>

  <p>'Eh?' said Kipps. 'I mean&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Both the young ladies became very intent on the knot, and Mr. Kipps was
  very red and very intent upon the two young ladies.</p>

  <p>'Mortified, and had to be sawn off,' said the maiden lady.</p>

  <p>'Sawn off,' said the lodging-house keeper.</p>

  <p>'Sawn right off,' said the maiden lady, and jabbed at her mangled
  design.</p>

  <p>'There,' said the freckled girl, 'I think that ought to do. You're sure
  it's not too tight?'</p>

  <p>'Not a bit,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>He met Miss Walshingham's eyes and smiled to show how little he cared for
  wounds and pain. 'It's only a little cut,' he added.</p>

  <p>The maiden lady appeared as an addition to their group. 'You should have
  washed the wound, dear,' she said. 'I was just telling Miss Collis&mdash;'
  She peered through her glasses at the bandage. 'That doesn't look quite
  right,' she remarked critically. 'You should have taken the ambulance
  classes. But I suppose it will have to do. Are you hurting?'</p>

  <p>'Not a bit,' said Kipps; and smiled at them all with the air of a brave
  soldier in hospital. 'I'm sure it must hurt,' said Miss Walshingham.</p>

  <p>'Anyhow, you're a very good patient,' said the girl with the freckles.</p>

  <p>Mr. Kipps became bright pink. 'I'm only sorry I broke the
  window&mdash;that's all,' he said. 'But who would have thought it was going
  to break like that?'</p>

  <p>Pause.</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid you won't be able to go on carving to-night,' said Miss
  Walshingham. 'I'll try,' said Kipps. 'It reely doesn't hurt&mdash;not
  anything to matter.'</p>

  <p>Presently Miss Walshingham came to him as he carved heroically with his
  hand bandaged in her handkerchief. There was a touch of novel interest in her
  eyes. 'I'm afraid you're not getting on very fast,' she said.</p>

  <p>The freckled girl looked up and regarded Miss Walshingham.</p>

  <p>'I'm doing a little, anyhow,' said Kipps. 'I don't want to waste any time.
  A feller like me hasn't much time to spare.'</p>

  <p>It struck the girls that there was a quality of modest disavowal about
  that 'feller like me.' It gave them a light into this obscure person, and
  Miss Walshingham ventured to commend his work as 'promising' and to ask
  whether he meant to follow it up. Kipps didn't 'altogether
  know'&mdash;'things depended on so much,' but if he was in Folkestone next
  winter he certainly should. It did not occur to Miss Walshingham at the time
  to ask why his progress in art depended upon his presence in Folkestone.
  There were some more questions and answers&mdash;they continued to talk to
  him for a little time even when Mr. Chester Coote had come into the
  room&mdash;and when at last the conversation had died out, it dawned upon
  Kipps just how much his cut wrist had done for him...</p>

  <p>He went to sleep that night revising that conversation for the twentieth
  time, treasuring this and expanding that, and inserting things he might have
  said to Miss Walshingham&mdash;things he might still say about
  himself&mdash;in relation, more or less explicit, to her. He wasn't quite
  sure if he wouldn't like his arm to mortify a bit, which would make him
  interesting, or to heal up absolutely, which would show the exceptional
  purity of his blood...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">The affair of the broken window happened late in April, and
the class came
  to an end in May. In that interval there were several small incidents and
  great developments of emotion. I have done Kipps no justice if I have made it
  seem that his face was unsightly. It was, as the freckled girl pointed out to
  Helen Walshingham, an 'interesting' face, and that aspect of him which
  presented chiefly erratic hair and glowing ears ceased to prevail.</p>

  <p>They talked him over, and the freckled girl discovered there was something
  'wistful' in his manner. They detected a 'natural delicacy,' and the freckled
  girl set herself to draw him out from that time forth. The freckled girl was
  nineteen, and very wise and motherly and benevolent, and really she greatly
  preferred drawing out Kipps to woodcarving. It was quite evident to her that
  Kipps was in love with Helen Walshingham, and it struck her as a queer and
  romantic and pathetic and extremely interesting phenomenon. And as at that
  time she regarded Helen as 'simply lovely,' it seemed only right and proper
  that she should assist Kipps in his modest efforts to place himself in a
  state of absolute abandon upon her altar.</p>

  <p>Under her sympathetic management the position of Kipps was presently
  defined quite clearly. He was unhappy in his position&mdash;misunderstood. He
  told her he 'didn't seem to get on like' with customers, and she translated
  this for him as 'too sensitive.' The discontent with his fate in life, the
  dreadful feeling that Education was slipping by him, troubles that time and
  usage were glazing over a little, revived to their old acuteness but not to
  their old hopelessness. As a basis for sympathy, indeed, they were even a
  source of pleasure.</p>

  <p>And one day at dinner it happened that Carshot and Buggins fell talking of
  'these here writers,' and how Dickens had been a labeller of blacking, and
  Thackeray 'an artis' who couldn't sell a drawing,' and how Samuel Johnson had
  walked to London without any boots, having thrown away his only pair 'out of
  pride.'</p>

  <p>'It's Luck,' said Buggins, 'to a very large extent. They just happen to
  hit on something that catches on, and there you are!'</p>

  <p>'Nice easy life they have of it, too,' said Miss Mergle. 'Write just an
  hour or so, and done for the day! Almost like gentlefolks.'</p>

  <p>'There's more work in it than you'd think,' said Carshot, stooping to a
  mouthful.</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't mind changing for all that,' said Buggins. 'I'd like to see
  one of these here authors marking off with Jimmy.'</p>

  <p>'I think they copy from each other a good deal,' said Miss Mergle.</p>

  <p>'Even then (chup, chup, chup),' said Carshot, 'there's writing it out in
  their own hands.'</p>

  <p>They proceeded to enlarge upon the literary life, on its ease and dignity,
  on the social recognition accorded to those who led it, and on the ample
  gratifications their vanity achieved. 'Pictures everywhere&mdash;never get a
  new suit without being photographed&mdash;almost like Royalty,' said Miss
  Mergle. And all this talk impressed the imagination of Kipps very greatly.
  Here was a class that seemed to bridge the gulf. On the one hand essentially
  Low, but by fictitious circumstances capable of entering upon these levels of
  social superiority to which all true Englishmen aspire, these levels from
  which one may tip a butler, scorn a tailor, and even commune with those who
  lead 'men' into battle. 'A'most like gentlefolks'&mdash;that was it! He
  brooded over these things in the afternoon, until they blossomed into
  daydreams. Suppose, for example, he had chanced to write a book, a well-known
  book, under an assumed name, and yet kept on being a draper all the
  time...Impossible, of course; but suppose&mdash;It made quite a long
  dream.</p>

  <p>And at the next woodcarving class he let it be drawn from him that his
  real choice in life was to be a Nawther&mdash;'only one doesn't get a
  chance.'</p>

  <p>After this there were times when Kipps had the pleasant sense that comes
  of attracting interest. He was a mute, inglorious Dickens, or at any rate
  something of that sort, and they were all taking him at that. The discovery
  of this indefinable 'something' in him, the development of which was now
  painfully restricted and impossible, did much to bridge the gulf between
  himself and Miss Walshingham. He was unfortunate, he was futile, but he was
  not 'common'. Even now with help&mdash;? The two girls, and the freckled girl
  in particular, tried to 'stir him up' to some effort to do his imputed
  potentialities justice. They were still young enough to believe that to nice
  and niceish members of the male sex&mdash;more especially when under the
  stimulus of feminine encouragement&mdash;nothing is finally impossible.</p>

  <p>The freckled girl was, I say, the stage manager of this affair, but Miss
  Walshingham was the presiding divinity. A touch of proprietorship came in her
  eyes at times when she looked at him. He was
  hers&mdash;unconditionally&mdash;and she knew it.</p>

  <p>To her directly, Kipps scarcely ever made a speech. The enterprising
  things that he was continually devising to say to her, he usually did not
  say, or said, with a suitable modification, to the girl with the freckles.
  And one day the girl with the freckles smote him to the heart. She said to
  him, looking across the class-room to where her friend reached a cast from
  the shelf, 'I do think Helen Walshingham is sometimes the most lovely person
  in the world. Look at her now!'</p>

  <p>Kipps gasped for a moment. The moment lengthened, and she regarded him as
  an intelligent young surgeon might regard an operation without anaesthetics.
  'You're right,' he said, and then looked at her with an entire abandonment of
  visage.</p>

  <p>She coloured under his glare of silent avowal, and he blushed brightly. 'I
  think so, too,' he said hoarsely, cleared his throat, and, after a meditative
  moment, proceeded sacramentally with his woodcarving.</p>

  <p>'You are wonderful,' said the freckled girl to Miss Walshingham, apropos
  of nothing, as they went on their way home together. 'He simply adores
  you.'</p>

  <p>'But, my dear, what have I done?' said Helen.</p>

  <p>'That's just it,' said the freckled girl. 'What have you done?'</p>

  <p>And then with a terrible swiftness came the last class of the course to
  terminate this relationship altogether. Kipps was careless of dates, and the
  thing came upon him with an effect of abrupt surprise. Just as his petals
  were expanding so hopefully, 'Finis,' and the thing was at an end. But Kipps
  did not fully appreciate that the end was indeed and really and truly the end
  until he was back in the emporium after the end was over.</p>

  <p>The end began practically in the middle of the last class, when the
  freckled girl broached the topic of terminations. She developed the question
  of just how he was going on after the class ended. She hoped he would stick
  to certain resolutions of self-improvement he had breathed. She said quite
  honestly that he owed it to himself to develop his possibilities. He
  expressed firm resolve, but dwelt on difficulties. He had no books. She
  instructed him how to get books from the public library. He was to get a form
  of application for a ticket signed by a ratepayer, and he said 'of course'
  when she said Mr. Shalford would do that, though all the time he knew
  perfectly well it would 'never do' to ask Mr. Shalford for anything of the
  sort. She explained that she was going to North Wales for the summer,
  information he received without immediate regret. At intervals he expressed
  his intention of going on with woodcarving when the summer was over, and once
  he added, 'if&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She considered herself extremely delicate not to press for the completion
  of that 'if&mdash;'</p>

  <p>After that talk there was an interval of languid woodcarving and watching
  Miss Walshingham.</p>

  <p>Then presently there came a bustle of packing, a great ceremony of
  handshaking all round by Miss Collis and the maiden lady of ripe years, and
  then Kipps found himself outside the class-room, on the landing with his two
  friends. It seemed to him he had only just learnt that this was the last
  class of all. There came a little pause, and the freckled girl suddenly went
  back into the class-room, and left Kipps and Miss Walshingham alone together
  for the first time. Kipps was instantly breathless. She looked at his face
  with a glance that mingled sympathy and curiosity, and held out her white
  hand.</p>

  <p>'Well, good-bye, Mr. Kipps,' she said.</p>

  <p>He took her hand and held it, 'I'd do anything,' said Kipps, and had not
  the temerity to add 'for you.' He stopped awkwardly.</p>

  <p>He shook her hand and said 'Good-bye.'</p>

  <p>There was a little pause. 'I hope you will have a pleasant holiday,' she
  said.</p>

  <p>'I shall come back to the class next year, anyhow,' said Kipps, valiantly,
  and turned abruptly to the stairs.</p>

  <p>'I hope you will,' said Miss Walshingham. He turned back towards her.</p>

  <p>'Really?' he said.</p>

  <p>'I hope everybody will come back.'</p>

  <p>'I will&mdash;anyhow,' said Kipps. 'You may count on that;' and he tried
  to make his tones significant.</p>

  <p>They looked at one another through a little pause.</p>

  <p>'Good-bye,' she said.</p>

  <p>Kipps lifted his hat.</p>

  <p>She turned towards the class-room.</p>

  <p>'Well?' said the freckled girl, coming back towards her.</p>

  <p>'Nothing,' said Helen. 'At least&mdash;presently.'</p>

  <p>And she became very energetic about some scattered tools on a desk. The
  freckled girl went out and stood for a moment at the head of the stairs. When
  she came back she looked very hard at her friend. The incident struck her as
  important&mdash;wonderfully important. It was unassimilable, of course, and
  absurd, but there it was, the thing that is so cardinal to a girl, the
  emotion, the subservience, the crowning triumph of her sex. She could not
  help feeling that Helen took it on the whole a little too hardly.</p>

<a id="chap14"
     name="chap14"></a>IV. &mdash; CHITTERLOW<br>
  <br></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">The hour of the class on the following Thursday found Kipps
in a state of
  nearly incredible despondency. He was sitting with his eyes on the
  reading-room clock, his chin resting on his fists, and his elbows on the
  accumulated comic papers, that were comic, alas! in vain. He paid no heed to
  the little man in spectacles glaring opposite to him, famishing for Fun. In
  this place it was he had sat night after night, each night more blissful than
  the last, waiting until it should be time to go to Her! and then&mdash;bliss!
  And now the hour had come and there was no class! There would be no class now
  until next October. It might be there would never be a class, so far as he
  was concerned, again.</p>

  <p>It might be there would never be a class again, for Shalford, taking
  exception at a certain absent-mindedness that led to mistakes, and more
  particularly to the ticketing of several articles in Kipps' Manchester window
  upside down, had been 'on to' him for the past few days in an exceedingly
  onerous manner&mdash;</p>

  <p>He sighed profoundly, pushed the comic papers back&mdash;they were rent
  away from him instantly by the little man in spectacles&mdash;and tried the
  old engravings of Folkestone in the pats that hung about the room. But these,
  too, failed to minister to his bruised heart. He wandered about the corridors
  for a time and watched the Library Indicator for a while. Wonderful thing
  that! But it did not hold him for long. People came and laughed near him, and
  that jarred with him dreadfully. He went out of the building, and a beastly
  cheerful barrel-organ mocked him in the street. He was moved to a desperate
  resolve to go down to the beach. There, it might be, he would be alone. The
  sea might be rough&mdash;and attuned to him. It would certainly be dark.</p>

  <p>'If I 'ad a penny I'm blest if I wouldn't go and chuck myself off the end
  of the pier...She'd never miss me...' He followed a deepening vein of
  thought.</p>

  <p>'Penny, though! It's tuppence,' he said, after a space.</p>

  <p>He went down Dover Street in a state of profound melancholia&mdash;at the
  pace and mood, as it were, of his own funeral procession&mdash;and he crossed
  at the corner of Tontine Street, heedless of all mundane things. And there it
  was that Fortune came upon him, in disguise and with a loud shout, the shout
  of a person endowed with an unusually rich, full voice, followed immediately
  by a violent blow in the back.</p>

  <p>His hat was over his eyes, and an enormous weight rested on his shoulders,
  and something kicked him in the back of his calf.</p>

  <p>Then he was on all fours in some mud that Fortune, in conjunction with the
  Folkestone corporation and in the pursuit of equally mysterious ends, had
  heaped together even lavishly for his reception.</p>

  <p>He remained in that position for some seconds, awaiting further
  developments, and believing almost anything broken before his heart.
  Gathering at last that this temporary violence of things in general was over,
  and being perhaps assisted by a clutching hand, he arose, and found himself
  confronting a figure holding a bicycle and thrusting forward a dark face in
  anxious scrutiny.</p>

  <p>'You aren't hurt, Matey?' gasped the figure.</p>

  <p>'Was that you 'it me?' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'It's these handles, you know,' said the figure with an air of being a
  fellow-sufferer. 'They're too low. And when I go to turn, if I don't
  remember, Bif!&mdash;-and I'm in to something.'</p>

  <p>'Well&mdash;you give me a oner in the back&mdash;anyhow,' said Kipps,
  taking stock of his damages.</p>

  <p>'I was coming downhill, you know,' explained the bicyclist. 'These little
  Folkestone hills are a Fair Treat. It isn't as though I'd been on the level.
  I came rather a whop.'</p>

  <p>'You did that,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'I was back-pedalling for all I was worth, anyhow,' said the bicyclist.
  'Not that I'm worth much back-pedalling.'</p>

  <p>He glanced round and made a sudden movement almost as if to mount his
  machine. Then he turned as rapidly to Kipps again, who was now stooping down,
  pursuing the tale of his injuries.</p>

  <p>'Here's the back of my trouser-leg all tore down,' said Kipps, 'and I
  believe I'm bleeding. You reely ought to be more careful&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The stranger investigated the damage with a rapid movement. 'Holy Smoke,
  so you are!' He laid a friendly hand on Kipps' arm. 'I say&mdash;look here!
  Come up to my diggings and sew it up. I'm&mdash;Of course I'm to blame, and I
  say&mdash;'</p>

  <p>His voice sank to a confidential friendliness. 'Here's a slop. Don't let
  on I ran you down. Haven't a lamp, you know. Might be at bit awkward, for
  me.'</p>

  <p>Kipps looked up towards the advancing policeman. The appeal to his
  generosity was not misplaced. He immediately took sides with his assailant.
  He stood as the representative of the law drew nearer. He assumed an air
  which he considered highly suggestive of an accident not having happened.</p>

  <p>'All right,' he said, 'go on!'</p>

  <p>'Right you are,' said the cyclist, promptly, and led the way; and then,
  apparently with some idea of deception, called over his shoulder, 'I'm
  tremendous glad to have met you, old chap.'</p>

  <p>'It really isn't a hundred yards,' he said, after they had passed the
  policeman; 'it's just round the corner.'</p>

  <p>'Of course,' said Kipps, limping slightly. 'I don't want to get a chap
  into trouble. Accidents will happen. Still&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, rather! I believe you. Accidents will happen. Especially when you get
  me on a bicycle.' He laughed. 'You aren't the first I've run down, not by any
  manner of means! I don't think you can be hurt much, either. It isn't as
  though I was scorching. You didn't see me coming. I was back-pedalling like
  anything. Only naturally it seems to you I must have been coming fast. And I
  did all I could to ease off the bump as I hit you. It was just the treadle, I
  think, came against your calf. But it was All Right of you about that
  policeman, you know. That was a Fair Bit of All Right. Under the Circs., if
  you'd told him I was riding, it might have been forty bob! Forty bob! I'd
  have had to tell 'em Time is Money just now for Mr. H. C.'</p>

  <p>'I shouldn't have blamed you either, you know. Most men, after a bump like
  that, might have been spiteful. The least I can do is to stand you a needle
  and thread. And a clothes' brush. It isn't every one who'd have taken it like
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Scorching! Why, if I'd been scorching you'd have&mdash;coming as we
  did&mdash;you'd have been knocked silly.'</p>

  <p>'But, I tell you, the way you caught on about that slop was something
  worth seeing. When I asked you&mdash;I didn't half expect it. Bif! Right off.
  Cool as a cucumber. Had your line at once. I tell you that there isn't many
  men would have acted as you have done, I will say that. You acted like a
  gentleman over that slop.'</p>

  <p>Kipps' first sense of injury disappeared. He limped along a pace or so
  behind, making depreciatory noises in response to these flattering remarks,
  and taking stock of the very appreciative person who uttered them.</p>

  <p>As they passed the lamps he was visible as a figure with a slight anterior
  plumpness, progressing buoyantly on knicker-bockered legs, with quite
  enormous calves, legs that, contrasting with Kipps' own narrow practice, were
  even exuberantly turned out at the knees and toes. A cycling cap was worn
  very much on one side, and from beneath it protruded carelessly straight
  wisps of dark-red hair, and ever and again an ample nose came into momentary
  view round the corner. The muscular cheeks of this person and a certain
  generosity of chin he possessed were blue shaven, and he had no moustache.
  His carriage was spacious and confident, his gestures up and down the narrow,
  deserted back street they traversed were irresistibly suggestive of
  ownership; a succession of broadly gesticulating shadows were born squatting
  on his feet, and grew and took possession of the road and reunited at least
  with the shadows of the infinite, as lamp after lamp was passed. Kipps saw by
  the flickering light of one of them that they were in Little Fenchurch
  Street, and then they came around a corner sharply into a dark court and
  stopped at the door of a particularly ramshackle-looking little house, held
  up between two larger ones, like a drunken man between policemen.</p>

  <p>The cyclist propped his machine carefully against the window, produced a
  key and blew down it sharply. 'The lock's a bit tricky,' he said, and devoted
  himself for same moments to the task of opening the door. Some mechanical
  catastrophe ensued, and the door was open.</p>

  <p>'You'd better wait here a bit while I get the lamp,' he remarked to Kipps;
  'very likely it isn't filled,' and vanished into the blackness of the
  passage. 'Thank God for matches!' he said; and Kipps had an impression of a
  passage in the transitory pink flare and the bicyclist disappearing into a
  farther room. Kipps was so much interested by these things that for the time
  he forgot his injuries altogether.</p>

  <p>An interval, and Kipps was dazzled by a pink-shaded kerosene lamp. 'You go
  in,' said the red-haired man, 'and I'll bring in the bike,' and for a moment
  Kipps was alone in the lamp-lit room. He took in rather vaguely the shabby
  ensemble of the little apartment, the round table covered with a torn, red,
  glass-stained cover on which the lamp stood, a mottled looking-glass over the
  fireplace reflecting this, a disused gas-bracket, an extinct fire, a number
  of dusty postcards and memoranda stuck round the glass, a dusty, crowded
  paper-rack on the mantel with a number of cabinet photographs, a table
  littered with papers and cigarette ash, and a siphon of soda-water. Then the
  cyclist reappeared, and Kipps saw his blue-shaved, rather animated face, and
  bright, reddish-brown eyes for the first time. He was a man, perhaps, ten
  years older than Kipps, but his beardless face made them in a way
  contemporary.</p>

  <p>'You behaved all right about that policeman, anyhow,' he repeated as he
  came forward.</p>

  <p>'I don't see 'ow else I could 'ave done,' said Kipps, quite modestly. The
  cyclist scanned his guest for the first time, and decided upon hospitable
  details.</p>

  <p>'We'd better let that mud dry a bit before we brush it. Whisky there is,
  good old Methuselah, Canadian Rye; and there's some brandy that's all right.
  Which'll you have?'</p>

  <p>'I dunno,' said Kipps, taken by surprise; and then seeing no other course
  but acceptance, 'Well, whisky, then.'</p>

  <p>'Right you are, old boy; and if you'll take my advice you'll take it neat.
  I may not be a particular judge of this sort of thing, but I do know old
  Methuselah pretty well. Old Methuselah&mdash;four stars. That's me! Good old
  Harry Chitterlow, and good old Methuselah. Leave 'em together. Bif! He's
  gone!'</p>

  <p>He laughed loudly, looked about him, hesitated, and retired, leaving Kipps
  in possession of the room, and free to make a more precise examination of its
  contents.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">He particularly remarked the photographs that adorned the
apartment. They
  were chiefly photographs of ladies, in one case in tights, which Kipps
  thought a 'bit 'ot'; but one represented the bicyclist in the costume of some
  remote epoch. It did not take Kipps long to infer that the others were
  probably actresses, and that his host was an actor, and the presence of the
  half of a large coloured playbill seemed to confirm this. A note in an Oxford
  frame that was a little too large for it he presently demeaned himself to
  read. 'Dear Mr. Chitterlow,' it ran its brief course, 'if, after all, you
  will send the play you spoke of, I will endeavour to read it,' followed by a
  stylish but absolutely illegible signature, and across this was written in
  pencil, 'What price Harry now?' And in the shadow by the window was a rough
  and rather able sketch of the bicyclist in chalk on brown paper, calling
  particular attention to the curvature of the forward lines of his hull and
  calves and the jaunty carriage of his nose, and labelled unmistakably
  'Chitterlow.' Kipps thought it 'rather a take-off.' The papers on the table
  by the siphon were in manuscript, Kipps observed, manuscript of a
  particularly convulsive and blottesque sort, and running obliquely across the
  page.</p>

  <p>Presently he heard the metallic clamour as if of a series of irreparable
  breakages with which the lock of the front door discharged its function, and
  then Chitterlow reappeared, a little out of breath, and with a
  starry-labelled bottle in his large, freckled hand.</p>

  <p>'Sit down, old chap,' he said, 'sit down. I had to get out for it after
  all. Wasn't a solitary bottle left. However, it's all right now we're here.
  No, don't sit on that chair, there's sheets of my play on that. That's the
  one&mdash;with the broken arm. I think this glass is clean, but, anyhow, wash
  it out with a squizz of siphon and shy it in the fireplace. Here, I'll do it!
  Lend it here!'</p>

  <p>As he spoke Mr. Chitterlow produced a corkscrew from a table drawer,
  attacked and overcame good old Methuselah's cork in a style a bar-tender
  might envy, washed out two tumblers in his simple, effectual manner, and
  poured a couple of inches of the ancient fluid into each. Kipps took his
  tumbler, said 'Thenks' in an off-hand way, and, after a momentary hesitation
  whether he should say 'Here's to you!' or not, put it to his lips without
  that ceremony. For a space fire in his throat occupied his attention to the
  exclusion of other matters, and then he discovered Mr. Chitterlow with an
  intensely bulldog pipe alight, seated on the opposite side of the empty
  fireplace, and pouring himself out a second dose of whisky.</p>

  <p>'After all,' said Mr. Chitterlow, with his eye on the bottle and a little
  smile wandering to hide amidst his larger features, 'this accident might have
  been worse. I wanted some one to talk to a bit, and I didn't want to go to a
  pub, leastways not a Folkestone pub, because, as a matter of fact, I'd
  promised Mrs. Chitterlow, who's away, not to, for various reasons, though, of
  course, if I'd wanted to, I'm just that sort, I should have all the
  same&mdash;and here we are! It's curious how one runs up against people out
  bicycling!'</p>

  <p>'Isn't it!' said Kipps, feeling that the time had come for him to say
  something.</p>

  <p>'Here we are, sitting and talking like old friends, and half an hour ago
  we didn't know we existed. Leastways we didn't know each other existed. I
  might have passed you in the street, perhaps, and you might have passed me,
  and how was I to tell that, put to the test, you would have behaved as
  decently as you have behaved. Only it happened otherwise, that's all. You're
  not smoking!' he said. 'Have a cigarette?'</p>

  <p>Kipps made a confused reply that took the form of not minding if he did,
  and drank another sip of old Methuselah in his confusion. He was able to
  follow the subsequent course of that sip for quite a long way. It was as
  though the old gentleman was brandishing a burning torch through his vitals,
  lighting him here and lighting him there, until at last his whole being was
  in a glow. Chitterlow produced a tobacco-pouch and cigarette-papers, and,
  with an interesting parenthesis that was a little difficult to follow about
  some lady, named Kitty something or other, who had taught him the art when he
  was as yet only what you might call a nice boy, made Kipps a cigarette, and,
  with a consideration that won Kipps' gratitude, suggested that, after all, he
  might find a little soda-water an improvement with the whisky. 'Some people
  like it that way,' said Chitterlow; and then with voluminous emphasis, 'I
  don't.' Emboldened by the weakened state of his enemy, Kipps promptly
  swallowed the rest of him, and had his glass at once hospitably replenished.
  He began to feel he was of a firmer consistency than he commonly believed,
  and turned his mind to what Chitterlow was saying with the resolve to play a
  larger part in the conversation than he had hitherto done. Also he smoked
  through his nose quite successfully, an art he had only very recently
  acquired.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Chitterlow explained that he was a playwright, and the tongue
  of Kipps was unloosened to respond that he knew a chap or rather one of their
  fellows knew a chap, or at least, to be perfectly, correct this fellow's
  brother did, who had written a play. In response to Chitterlow's inquiries,
  he could not recall the title of the play, nor where it had appeared, nor the
  name of the manager who produced it, though he thought the title was
  something about 'Love's Ransom,' or something like that.</p>

  <p>'He made five 'undred pounds by it, though,' said Kipps. 'I know
  that.'</p>

  <p>'That's nothing,' said Chitterlow, with an air of experience that was
  extremely convincing. 'Nothing. May seem a big sum to you, but I can assure
  you it's just what one gets any day. There's any amount of money, an-ny
  amount, in a good play.'</p>

  <p>'I dessay,' said Kipps, drinking. 'Any amount of money!'</p>

  <p>Chitterlow began a series of illustrative instances. He was clearly a
  person of quite unequalled gift for monologue. It was as though some
  conversational dam had burst upon Kipps, and in a little while he was
  drifting along upon a copious rapid of talk about all sorts of theatrical
  things by one who knew all about them, and quite incapable of anticipating
  whither that rapid meant to carry him. Presently, somehow, they had got to
  anecdotes about well-known theatrical managers&mdash;little Teddy
  Bletherskite, artful old Chumps and the magnificent Behemoth, 'petted to
  death, you know, fair sickened, by all these society women.' Chitterlow
  described various personal encounters with these personages, always with
  modest self-depreciation, and gave Kipps a very amusing imitation of old
  Chumps in a state of intoxication. Then he took two more stiff doses of old
  Methuselah in rapid succession.</p>

  <p>Kipps reduced the hither end of his cigarette to a pulp as he sat
  'dessaying' and 'quite believing' Chitterlow in the sagest manner, and
  admiring the easy way in which he was getting on with this very novel and
  entertaining personage. He had another cigarette made for him, and then
  Chitterlow, assuming by insensible degrees more and more of the manner of a
  rich and successful playwright being interviewed by a young admirer, set
  himself to answer questions which sometimes Kipps asked, and sometimes
  Chitterlow, about the particulars and methods of his career. He undertook
  this self-imposed task with great earnestness and vigour, treating the
  matter, indeed, with such fullness that at times it seemed lost altogether
  under a thicket of parentheses, footnotes, and episodes that branched and
  budded from its stem. But it always emerged again, usually by way of
  illustration to its own digressions. Practically it was a mass of material
  for the biography of a man who had been everywhere and done everything
  (including the Hon. Thomas Norgate, which was a record), and in particular
  had acted with great distinction and profit (he dated various anecdotes,
  'when I was getting thirty, or forty, or fifty dollars a week') throughout
  America and the entire civilised world.</p>

  <p>And as he talked on and on in that full, rich, satisfying voice he had,
  and as old Methuselah, indisputably a most drunken old reprobate of a whisky,
  busied himself throughout Kipps, lighting lamp after lamp until the entire
  framework of the little draper was illuminated and glowing like some public
  building on a festival, behold Chitterlow, and Kipps with him, and the room
  in which they sat were transfigured! Chitterlow became in very truth that
  ripe, full man of infinite experience and humour and genius, fellow of
  Shakespeare and Ibsen and Maeterlinck (three names he placed together quite
  modestly far above his own), and no longer ambiguously dressed in a sort of
  yachting costume with cycling knickerbockers, but elegantly if
  unconventionally attired, and the room ceased to be a small and shabby room
  in a Folkestone slum, and grew larger and more richly furnished, and the
  flyblown photographs were curious old pictures, and the rubbish on the walls
  the most rare and costly bric-a-brac, and the indisputable paraffin lamp a
  soft and splendid light. A certain youthful heat that to many minds might
  have weakened old Methuselah's starry claim to a ripe antiquity vanished in
  that glamour; two burnt holes and a clamant darn in the table-cloth,
  moreover, became no more than the pleasing contradictions natural in the
  house of genius; and as for Kipps&mdash;Kipps was a bright young man of
  promise, distinguished by recent quick, courageous proceedings not too
  definitely insisted upon, and he had been rewarded by admission to a sanctum
  and confidences for which the common prosperous, for which 'society women'
  even, were notoriously sighing in vain. 'Don't want them, my boy; they'd
  simply play old Harry with the Work, you know! Chaps outside, bank clerks and
  university fellows, think the life's all that sort of thing. Don't you
  believe 'em! Don't you believe 'em!'</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;!</p>

  <p>'Boom...Boom...Boom...Boom...' right in the middle of a most entertaining
  digression on flats who join touring companies under the impression that they
  are actors, Kipps much amused at their flatness as exposed by Chitterlow.</p>

  <p>'Lor!' said Kipps, like one who awakens, 'that's not eleven!'</p>

  <p>'Must be,' said Chitterlow. 'It was nearly ten when I got that whisky.
  It's early yet&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'All the same, I must be going,' said Kipps, and stood up. 'Even
  now&mdash;maybe. Fact is&mdash;I 'ad no idea. The 'ouse door shuts at 'arf-
  past ten, you know. I ought to 'ave thought before.'</p>

  <p>'Well, if you must go&mdash;! I tell you what. I'll come to...Why! There's
  your leg, old man! Clean forgot it! You can't go through the streets like
  that. I'll sew up the tear. And meanwhile have another whiskey.'</p>

  <p>'I ought to be getting on now,' protested Kipps, feebly; and then
  Chitterlow was showing him how to kneel on a chair in order that the rent
  trouser leg should be attainable, and old Methuselah on his third round was
  busy repairing the temporary eclipse of Kipps' arterial glow. Then suddenly
  Chitterlow was seized with laughter, and had to leave off sewing to tell
  Kipps that the scene wouldn't make a bad bit of business in a farcical
  comedy, and then he began to sketch out the farcical comedy, and that led him
  to a digression about another farcical comedy of which he had written a
  ripping opening scene which wouldn't take ten minutes to read. It had
  something in it that had never been done on the stage before, and was yet
  perfectly legitimate, namely a man with a live beetle down the back of his
  neck trying to seem at his ease in a roomful of people...</p>

  <p>'They won't lock you out,' he said, in a singularly reassuring tone, and
  began to read and act what he explained to be (not because he had written it,
  but simply because he knew it was so on account of his exceptional experience
  of the stage), and what Kipps also quite clearly saw to be, one of the best
  opening scenes that had ever been written.</p>

  <p>When it was over, Kipps, who rarely swore, was inspired to say the scene
  was 'damned fine' about six times over, whereupon, as if by way of
  recognition, Chitterlow took a simply enormous portion of the inspired
  antediluvian, declaring at the same time that he had rarely met a 'finer'
  intelligence than Kipps' (stronger there might be, that he couldn't say with
  certainty as yet, seeing how little, after all, they had seen of each other,
  but a finer never), that it was a shame such a gallant and discriminating
  intelligence should be nightly either locked up or locked out at
  ten&mdash;well, ten-thirty, then&mdash;and that he had half a mind to
  recommend old somebody or other (apparently the editor of a London daily
  paper) to put on Kipps forthwith as a dramatic critic in the place of the
  current incapable.</p>

  <p>'I don't think I've ever made up anything for print,' said Kipps, 'ever.
  I'd have a thundering good try, though, if ever I got a chance. I would that!
  I've written window tickets orfen enough. Made 'em up and everything. But
  that's different.'</p>

  <p>'You'd come to it all the fresher for not having done it before. And the
  way you picked up every point in that scene, my boy, was a Fair Treat! I tell
  you, you'd knock William Archer into fits. Not so literary, of course, you'd
  be, but I don't believe in literary critics any more than in literary
  playwrights. Plays aren't literature&mdash;that's just the point they miss.
  Plays are plays. No! That won't hamper you, anyhow. You're wasted down here,
  I tell you. Just as I was, before I took to acting. I'm hanged if I wouldn't
  like your opinion on these first two acts of that tragedy I'm on to. I
  haven't told you about that. It wouldn't take me more than an hour to
  read.'...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Then, so far as he could subsequently remember, Kipps had
'another,' and
  then it would seem that, suddenly regardless of the tragedy, he insisted that
  he 'really must be getting on,' and from that point his memory became
  irregular. Certain things remained quite clearly, and as it is a matter of
  common knowledge that intoxicated people forget what happens to them, it
  follows that he was not intoxicated. Chitterlow came with him, partly to see
  him home and partly for a freshener before turning in. Kipps recalled
  afterwards very distinctly how in Little Fenchurch Street he discovered that
  he could not walk straight, and also that Chitterlow's needle and thread in
  his still unmended trouser leg was making an annoying little noise on the
  pavement behind him. He tried to pick up the needle suddenly by surprise, and
  somehow tripped and fell, and then Chitterlow, laughing uproariously, helped
  him up. 'It wasn't a bicycle this time, old boy,' said Chitterlow, and that
  appeared to them both at the time as being a quite extraordinarily good joke
  indeed. They punched each other about on the strength of it.</p>

  <p>For a time after that Kipps certainly pretended to be quite desperately
  drunk and unable to walk, and Chitterlow entered into the pretence and
  supported him. After that Kipps remembered being struck with the extremely
  laughable absurdity of going downhill to Tontine Street in order to go uphill
  again to the Emporium, and trying to get that idea into Chitterlow's head and
  being unable to do so on account of his own merriment and Chitterlow's
  evident intoxication; and his next memory after that was of the exterior of
  the Emporium, shut and darkened, and, as it were, frowning at him with all
  its stripes of yellow and green. The chilly way in which 'SHALFORD' glittered
  in the moonlight printed itself with particular vividness on his mind. It
  appeared to Kipps that that establishment was closed to him for evermore.
  Those gilded letters, in spite of appearances, spelt FINIS for him and exile
  from Folkestone. He would never do wood-carving, never see Miss Walshingham
  again. Not that he had ever hoped to see her again. But this was the knife,
  this was final. He had stayed out, he had got drunk, there had been that row
  about the Manchester window dressing only three days ago...In the retrospect
  he was quite sure that he was perfectly sober then and at bottom extremely
  unhappy, but he kept a brave face on the matter nevertheless, and declared
  stoutly he didn't care if he was locked out.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Chitterlow slapped him on the back very hard and told him that
  was a 'Bit of All-Right,' and assured him that when he himself had been a
  clerk in Sheffield, before he took to acting, he had been locked out
  sometimes for six nights running.</p>

  <p>'What's the result?' said Chitterlow. 'I could go back to that place now,
  and they'd be glad to have me...Glad to have me,' he repeated, and then
  added, 'That is to say, if they remember me&mdash;which isn't very
  likely.'</p>

  <p>Kipps asked a little weakly, 'What am I to do?'</p>

  <p>'Keep out,' said Chitterlow. 'You can't knock 'em up now&mdash;that would
  give you Right away. You'd better try and sneak in in the morning with the
  Cat. That'll do you. You'll probably get in all right in the morning if
  nobody gives you away.'</p>

  <p>Then for a time&mdash;perhaps as the result of that slap on the
  back&mdash;Kipps felt decidedly queer, and, acting on Chitterlow's advice,
  went for a bit of a freshener upon the Leas. After a time he threw off the
  temporary queerness, and found Chitterlow patting him on the shoulder and
  telling him that he'd be all right now in a minute and all the better for
  it&mdash;which he was. And the wind having dropped and the night being now a
  really very beautiful moonlight night indeed, and all before Kipps to spend
  as he liked, and with only a very little tendency to spin round now and again
  to mar its splendour, they set out to walk the whole length of the Leas to
  the Sandgate lift and back, and as they walked Chitterlow spoke first of
  moonlight transfiguring the sea and then of moonlight transfiguring faces,
  and so at last he came to the topic of Love, and upon that he dwelt a great
  while, and with a wealth of experience and illustrative anecdote that seemed
  remarkably pungent and material to Kipps. He forgot his lost Miss Walshingham
  and his outraged employer again. He became, as it were, a desperado by
  reflection.</p>

  <p>Chitterlow had had adventures, a quite astonishing variety of adventures,
  in this direction; he was a man with a past, a really opulent past, and he
  certainly seemed to like to look back and see himself amidst its
  opulence.</p>

  <p>He made no consecutive history, but he gave Kipps vivid momentary pictures
  of relations and entanglements. One moment he was in flight&mdash;only too
  worthily in flight&mdash;before the husband of a Malay woman in Cape Town. At
  the next he was having passionate complications with the daughter of a
  clergyman in York. Then he passed to a remarkable grouping at Seaford.</p>

  <p>They say you can't love two women at once,' said Chitterlow. 'But I tell
  you&mdash;' He gesticulated and raised his ample voice. 'It's Rot! Rot!'</p>

  <p>'I know that,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Why, when I was in the smalls with Bessie Hopper's company there were
  Three.' He laughed, and decided to add, 'not counting Bessie, that is.'</p>

  <p>He set out to reveal Life as it is lived in touring companies, a quite
  amazing jungle of interwoven 'affairs' it appeared to be, a mere amorous
  winepress for the crushing of hearts.</p>

  <p>'People say this sort of thing's a nuisance and interferes with Work. I
  tell you it isn't. The Work couldn't go on without it. They must do it. They
  haven't the Temperament if they don't. If they hadn't the Temperament they
  wouldn't want to act; if they have&mdash;Bif!'</p>

  <p>'You're right,' said Kipps. 'I see that.'</p>

  <p>Chitterlow proceeded to a close criticism of certain historical
  indiscretions of Mr. Clement Scott respecting the morals of the stage.
  Speaking in confidence, and not as one who addresses the public, he admitted
  regretfully the general truth of these comments. He proceeded to examine
  various typical instances that had almost forced themselves upon him
  personally, and with especial regard to the contrast between his own
  character towards women and that of the Hon. Thomas Norgate, with whom it
  appeared he had once been on terms of great intimacy...</p>

  <p>Kipps listened with emotion to these extraordinary recollections. They
  were wonderful to him, they were incredibly credible. This tumultuous,
  passionate, irregular course was the way life ran&mdash;except in high-class
  establishments! Such things happened in novels, in plays&mdash;-only he had
  been fool enough not to understand they happened. His share in the
  conversation was now, indeed, no more than faint writing in the margin;
  Chitterlow was talking quite continuously. He expanded his magnificent voice
  into huge guffaws, he drew it together into a confidential intensity, it
  became drawlingly reminiscent, he was frank, frank with the effect of a
  revelation, reticent also with the effect of a revelation, a stupendously
  gesticulating moonlit black figure, wallowing in itself, preaching Adventure
  and the Flesh to Kipps. Yet withal shot with something of sentiment, with a
  sort of sentimental refinement very coarsely and egotistically done. The
  Times he had had!&mdash;even before he was as old as Kipps he had had
  innumerable Times.</p>

  <p>Well, he said with a sudden transition, he had sown his wild
  oats&mdash;one had to somewhen&mdash;and now, he fancied he had mentioned it
  earlier in the evening, he was happily married. She was, he indicated, a
  'born lady.' Her father was a prominent lawyer, a solicitor in Kentish Town,
  'done a lot of public-house business'; her mother was second cousin to the
  wife of Abel Jones, the fashionable portrait painter&mdash;'almost Society
  people in a way.' That didn't count with Chitterlow. He was no snob. What did
  count was that she possessed what he ventured to assert, without much fear of
  contradiction, was the very finest completely untrained contralto voice in
  all the world. ('But to hear it properly,' said Chitterlow, 'you want a Big
  Hall.') He became rather vague, and jerked his head about to indicate when
  and how he had entered matrimony. She was, it seemed, 'away with her people.'
  It was clear that Chitterlow did not get on with these people very well. It
  would seem they failed to appreciate his playwriting, regarding it as an
  unremunerative pursuit, whereas, as he and Kipps knew, wealth beyond the
  dreams of avarice would presently accrue. Only patience and persistence were
  needful.</p>

  <p>He went off at a tangent to hospitality. Kipps must come down home with
  him. They couldn't wander about all night with a bottle of the right sort
  pining at home for them. 'You can sleep on the sofa. You won't be worried by
  broken springs, anyhow, for I took 'em all out myself two or three weeks ago.
  I don't see what they ever put 'em in for. It's a point I know about. I took
  particular notice of it when I was with Bessie Hopper. Three months we were,
  and all over England, North Wales, and the Isle of Man, and I never struck a
  sofa in diggings anywhere that hadn't a broken spring. Not once&mdash;all the
  time.'</p>

  <p>He added, almost absently, 'It happens like that at times.'</p>

  <p>They descended the slant road towards Harbour Street and went on past the
  Pavilion Hotel.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">They came into the presence of old Methuselah again, and
that worthy,
  under Chitterlow's direction, at once resumed the illumination of Kipps'
  interior with the conscientious thoroughness that distinguished him.
  Chitterlow took a tall portion to himself with an air of asbestos, lit the
  bulldog pipe again and lapsed for a space into meditation, from which Kipps
  roused him by remarking that he expected 'a nacter 'as a lot of ups and downs
  like, now and then.'</p>

  <p>At which Chitterlow seemed to bestir himself. 'Rather,' he said. 'And
  sometimes it's his own fault and sometimes it isn't. Usually it is. If it
  isn't one thing it's another. If it isn't the manager's wife it's
  bar-bragging. I tell you things happen at times. I'm a fatalist. The fact is,
  Character has you. You can't get away from it. You may think you do, but you
  don't.'</p>

  <p>He reflected for a moment. 'It's that what makes tragedy. Psychology
  really. It's the Greek irony&mdash;Ibsen and&mdash;all that. Up to date.'</p>

  <p>He emitted this exhaustive summary of high-toned modern criticism as if he
  was repeating a lesson while thinking of something else; but it seemed to
  rouse him as it passed his lips, by including the name of Ibsen.</p>

  <p>He became interested in telling Kipps, who was, indeed open to any
  information whatever about this quite novel name, exactly where he thought
  Ibsen fell short, points where it happened that Ibsen was defective just
  where it chanced that he, Chitterlow, was strong. Of course, he had no desire
  to place himself in any way on an equality with Ibsen; still, the fact
  remained that his own experience in England and America and the colonies was
  altogether more extensive than Ibsen could have had. Ibsen had probably never
  seen 'one decent bar scrap' in his life. That, of course, was not Ibsen's
  fault, or his own merit, but there the thing was. Genius, he knew, was
  supposed to be able to do anything or to do without anything; still, he was
  now inclined to doubt that. He had a play in hand that might perhaps not
  please William Archer&mdash;whose opinion, after all, he did not value as he
  valued Kipps' opinion&mdash;but which, he thought, was, at any rate, as well
  constructed as anything Ibsen ever did.</p>

  <p>So with infinite deviousness Chitterlow came at last to his play. He
  decided he would not read it to Kipps, but tell him about it. This was the
  simpler, because much of it was still unwritten. He began to explain his
  plot. It was a complicated plot, and all about a nobleman who had seen
  everything and done everything and knew practically all that Chitterlow knew
  about women, that is to say, 'all about women' and such-like matters. It
  warmed and excited Chitterlow. Presently he stood up to act a situation which
  could not be explained. It was an extremely vivid situation.</p>

  <p>Kipps applauded the situation vehemently. 'Tha's dam fine,' said the new
  dramatic critic, quite familiar with his part now, striking the table with
  his fist and almost upsetting his third portion (in the second series) of old
  Methuselah. 'Tha's dam fine, Chit'low!'</p>

  <p>'You see it?' said Chitterlow, with the last vestiges of that incidental
  gloom disappearing. 'Good old boy! I thought you'd see it. But it's just the
  sort of thing the literary critic can't see. However, it's only a
  beginning&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He replenished Kipps and proceeded with his exposition.</p>

  <p>In a little while it was no longer necessary to give that over-advertised
  Ibsen the purely conventional precedence he had hitherto had. Kipps and
  Chitterlow were friends, and they could speak frankly and openly of things
  not usually admitted. 'Any'ow,' said Kipps, a little irrelevantly, and
  speaking over the brim of the replenishment, 'what you read jus' now was dam
  fine. Nothing can't alter that.'</p>

  <p>He perceived a sort of faint buzzing vibration about things that was very
  nice and pleasant, and with a little care he had no difficulty whatever in
  putting his glass back on the table. Then he perceived Chitterlow was going
  on with the scenario, and then that old Methuselah had almost entirely left
  his bottle. He was glad there was so little more Methuselah to drink, because
  that would prevent his getting drunk. He knew that he was not now drunk, but
  he knew that he had had enough. He was one of those who always know when they
  have had enough. He tried to interrupt Chitterlow to tell him this, but he
  could not get a suitable opening. He doubted whether Chitterlow might not be
  one of those people who did not know when they had had enough. He discovered
  that he disapproved of Chitterlow. Highly. It seemed to him that Chitterlow
  went on and on like a river. For a time he was inexplicably and quite
  unjustly cross with Chitterlow, and wanted to say to him 'you got the gift of
  the gab,' but he only got so far as to say 'the gift,' and then Chitterlow
  thanked him and said he was better than Archer any day. So he eyed Chitterlow
  with a baleful eye until it dawned upon him that a most extraordinary thing
  was taking place. Chitterlow kept mentioning some one named Kipps. This
  presently began to perplex Kipps very greatly. Dimly but decidedly he
  perceived this was wrong.</p>

  <p>'Look 'ere,' he said suddenly, 'what Kipps?'</p>

  <p>'This chap Kipps I'm telling you about.'</p>

  <p>'What chap Kipps you're telling which about?'</p>

  <p>'I told you.'</p>

  <p>Kipps struggled with a difficulty in silence for a space. Then he
  reiterated firmly, 'What chap Kipps?'</p>

  <p>'This chap in my play&mdash;man who kisses the girl.'</p>

  <p>'Never kissed a girl,' said Kipps, 'leastways&mdash;' and subsided for a
  space. He could not remember whether he had kissed Ann or not&mdash;he knew
  he had meant to. Then suddenly, in a tone of great sadness, and addressing
  the hearth, he said, 'My name's Kipps.'</p>

  <p>'Eh?' said Chitterlow.</p>

  <p>'Kipps,' said Kipps, smiling a little cynically.</p>

  <p>'What about him?'</p>

  <p>'He's me.' He tapped his breastbone with his middle finger to indicate his
  essential self.</p>

  <p>He leant forward very gravely towards Chitterlow. 'Look 'ere, Chit'low,'
  he said. 'You haven't no business putting my name into play. You mustn't do
  things like that. You'd lose me my crib, right away.' And they had a little
  argument&mdash;so far as Kipps could remember. Chitterlow entered upon a
  general explanation of how he got his names. These he had for the most part
  got out of a newspaper that was still, he believed, 'lying about.' He even
  made to look for it, and while he was doing so Kipps went on with the
  argument, addressing himself more particularly to the photograph of the girl
  in tights. He said that at first her costume had not commended her to him,
  but now he perceived she had an extremely sensible face. He told her she
  would like Buggins if she met him, he could see she was just that sort. She
  would admit&mdash;all sensible people would admit&mdash;that using names in
  plays was wrong. You could, for example, have the law on him.</p>

  <p>He became confidential. He explained that he was already in sufficient
  trouble for stopping out all night, without having his name put in plays: He
  was certain to be in the deuce of a row, the deuce of a row. Why had he done
  it? Why hadn't he gone at ten? Because one thing leads to another. One thing,
  he generalised, always does lead to another...</p>

  <p>He was trying to tell her that he was utterly unworthy of Miss
  Walshingham, when Chitterlow gave up the search, and suddenly accused him of
  being drunk and talking 'Rot&mdash;'</p>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">He awoke on the thoroughly comfortable sofa that had had
all its springs
  removed, and although he had certainly not been intoxicated, he awoke with
  what Chitterlow pronounced to be, quite indisputably, a Head and a Mouth. He
  had slept in his clothes, and he felt stiff and uncomfortable all over, but
  the head and mouth insisted that he must not bother over little things like
  that. In the head was one large, angular idea that it was physically painful
  to have there. If he moved his head, the angular idea shifted about in the
  most agonising away. This idea was that he had lost his situation and was
  utterly ruined, and that it really mattered very little. Shalford was certain
  to hear of his escapade, and that, coupled with that row about the Manchester
  window&mdash;!</p>

  <p>He raised himself into a sitting position under Chitterlow's urgent
  encouragement.</p>

  <p>He submitted apathetically to his host's attentions. Chitterlow, who
  admitted being a 'bit off it' himself and in need of an egg-cupful of brandy,
  just an egg-cupful neat, dealt with that Head and Mouth as a mother might
  deal with the fall of an only child. He compared it with other Heads and
  Mouths that he had met, and in particular to certain experienced by the Hon.
  Thomas Norgate. 'Right up to the last,' said Chitterlow, 'he couldn't stand
  his liquor. It happens like that at times.' And after Chitterlow had pumped
  on the young beginner's head and given him some anchovy paste piping hot on
  buttered toast, which he preferred to all the other remedies he had
  encountered, Kipps resumed his crumpled collar, brushed his clothes, tacked
  up his knee, and prepared to face Mr. Shalford and the reckoning for this
  wild, unprecedented night&mdash;the first 'night out' that ever he had
  taken.</p>

  <p>Acting on Chitterlow's advice to have a bit of a freshner before returning
  to the Emporium, Kipps walked some way along the Leas and back, and then went
  down to a shop near the Harbour to get a cup of coffee. He found that
  extremely reinvigorating, and he went on up the High Street to face the
  inevitable terrors of the office, a faint touch of pride in his depravity
  tempering his extreme self-abasement. After all, it was not an unmanly
  headache; he had been out all night, and he had been drinking, and his
  physical disorder was there to witness the fact. If it wasn't for the thought
  of Shalford, he would have been even a proud man to discover himself at last
  in such a condition. But the thought of Shalford was very dreadful. He met
  two of the apprentices snatching a walk before shop began. At the sight of
  them he pulled his spirits together, put his hat back from his pallid brow,
  thrust his hands into his trousers pockets, and adopted an altogether more
  dissipated carriage; he met their innocent faces with a wan smile. Just for a
  moment he was glad that his patch at the knee was, after all, visible, and
  that some, at least, of the mud on his clothes had refused to move at
  Chitterlow's brushing. What wouldn't they think he had been up to? He passed
  them without speaking. He could imagine how they regarded his back. Then he
  recollected Mr. Shalford...</p>

  <p>The deuce of a row certainly, and perhaps&mdash;! He tried to think of
  plausible versions of the affair. He could explain he had been run down by
  rather a wild sort of fellow who was riding a bicycle, almost stunned for the
  moment (even now he felt the effects of the concussion in his head), and had
  been given whisky to restore him, and 'the fact is, Sir,'&mdash;with an
  upward inflection of the voice, an upward inflection of the eyebrows, and an
  air of its being the last thing one would have expected whisky to do, the
  manifestation, indeed, of a practically unique physiological
  weakness&mdash;'it got into my 'ed! '...</p>

  <p>Put like that it didn't look so bad.</p>

  <p>He got to the Emporium a little before eight, and the housekeeper, with
  whom he was something of a favourite ('There's no harm in Mr. Kipps,' she
  used to say), seemed to like him, if anything, better for having broken the
  rules, and gave him a piece of dry toast and a hot cup of tea.</p>

  <p>'I suppose the G. V.&mdash;' began Kipps.</p>

  <p>'He knows,' said the housekeeper.</p>

  <p>He went down to the shop a little before time, and presently Booch
  summoned him to the presence. He emerged from the private office after an
  interval of ten minutes.</p>

  <p>The junior clerk scrutinised his visage. Buggins put the frank
  question.</p>

  <p>Kipps answered with one word.</p>

  <p>'Swapped!' said Kipps.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Kipps leant against the fixtures with his hands in his
pockets and talked
  to the two apprentices under him. 'I don't care if I am swapped,' said Kipps.
  'I been sick of Teddy and his System some time.'</p>

  <p>'I was a good mind to chuck it when my time was up,' said Kipps. 'Wish I
  'ad now.'</p>

  <p>Afterwards Pearce came round, and Kipps repeated this.</p>

  <p>'What's it for?' said Pearce. 'That row about the window tickets?'</p>

  <p>'No fear!' said Kipps, and sought to convey a perspective of splendid
  depravity. 'I wasn't in las' night,' he said, and made even Pearce, 'man
  about town' Pearce, open his eyes.</p>

  <p>'Why, where did you get to?' asked Pearce.</p>

  <p>He conveyed that he had been 'fair all round the town, with a Nactor chap'
  he knew. 'One can't always be living like a curit,' he said.</p>

  <p>'No fear,' said Pearce, trying to play up to him.</p>

  <p>But Kipps had the top place in that conversation.</p>

  <p>'My lor!' said Kipps, when Pearce had gone, 'but wasn't my mouth and 'ed
  bad this morning before I 'ad a pick-me-up!'</p>

  <p>'Whad jer 'ave?'</p>

  <p>'Anchovy on 'ot buttered toast. It's the very best pick-me-up there is.
  You trust me, Rodgers. I never take no other, and I don't advise you to.
  See?'</p>

  <p>And when pressed for further particulars, he said again he had been 'fair
  all round the town, with a Nactor chap' he knew. They asked curiously all he
  had done, and he said, 'Well, what do you think?' And when they pressed for
  still further details, he said there were things little boys ought not to
  know, and laughed darkly and found them some huckaback to roll.</p>

  <p>And in this manner for a space did Kipps fend off the contemplation of the
  'key of the street' that Shalford had presented him.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">This sort of thing was all very well when junior
apprentices were about,
  but when Kipps was alone with himself it served him not at all. He was
  uncomfortable inside, and his skin was uncomfortable, and the Head and Mouth,
  palliated, perhaps, but certainly not cured, were still with him. He felt, to
  tell the truth, nasty and dirty, and extremely disgusted with himself. To
  work was dreadful, and to stand still and think still more dreadful. His
  patched knee reproached him. These were the second best of his three pairs of
  trousers, and they had cost him thirteen and sixpence. Practically ruined
  they were. His dusting pair was unfit for shop, and he would have to degrade
  his best, when he was under inspection he affected the slouch of a desperado,
  but directly he found himself alone, this passed insensibly into the
  droop.</p>

  <p>The financial aspect of things grew large before him. His whole capital in
  the world was the sum of five pounds in the Post Office Savings Bank, and
  four and sixpence cash. Besides, there would be two months' 'screw.' His
  little tin box upstairs was no longer big enough for his belongings, he would
  have to buy another, let alone that it was not calculated to make a good
  impression in a new 'crib.' Then there would be paper and stamps needed in
  some abundance for answering advertisements and railway fares when he went
  'crib hunting.' He would have to write letters, and he never wrote letters.
  There was spelling, for example, to consider. Probably if nothing turned up
  before his month was up, he would have to go home to his Uncle and Aunt.</p>

  <p>How would they take it?...</p>

  <p>For the present, at any rate, he resolved not to write to them.</p>

  <p>Such disagreeable things as this it was that lurked below the fair surface
  of Kipps' assertion, 'I been wanting a change. If 'e 'adn't swapped me, I
  should very likely 'ave swapped 'im.'</p>

  <p>In the perplexed privacies of his own mind he could not understand how
  everything had happened. He had been the Victim of Fate, or at least of one
  as inexorable&mdash;Chitterlow. He tried to recall the successive steps that
  had culminated so disastrously. They were difficult to recall...</p>

  <p>Buggins that night abounded in counsel and reminiscence.</p>

  <p>'Curious thing,' said Buggins, 'but every time I've had the swap I've
  never believed I should get another Crib&mdash;never. But I have,' said
  Buggins. 'Always. So don't lose heart, whatever you do.'</p>

  <p>'Whatever you do,' said Buggins, 'keep hold of your collars and
  cuffs&mdash;shirts, if you can, but collars anyhow. Spout them last. And,
  anyhow, it's summer, you won't want your coat...You got a good
  umbrella...</p>

  <p>'You'll no more get a shop from New Romney than&mdash;anything. Go
  straight up to London, get the cheapest room you can find&mdash;and hang out.
  Don't eat too much. Many a chap's put his prospects in his stomach. Get a cup
  o' coffee and a slice&mdash;egg, if you like&mdash;but remember you got to
  turn up at the Warehouse tidy. The best places now, I believe, are the old
  cabmen's eating houses. Keep your watch and chain as long as you can...</p>

  <p>'There's lots of shops going,' said Buggins, 'Lots!'</p>

  <p>And added reflectively, 'But not this time of year, perhaps.'</p>

  <p>He began to recall his own researches. "Stonishing lot of chaps you see,'
  he said. 'All sorts. Look like Dukes, some of 'em. High hat. Patent boots.
  Frockcoat. All there. All right for a West End crib. Others&mdash;Lord! It's
  a caution, Kipps. Boots been inked in some reading-rooms&mdash;I used to
  write in a Reading Room in Fleet Street, regular penny club&mdash;hat been
  wetted, collar frayed, tail-coat buttoned up, black chest-plaster
  tie&mdash;spread out. Shirt, you know, gone&mdash;' Buggins pointed upward
  with a pious expression.</p>

  <p>'No shirt, I expect?'</p>

  <p>'Eat it.' said Buggins.</p>

  <p>Kipps meditated. 'I wonder where old Minton is,' he said at last. 'I often
  wondered about 'im.'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">It was the morning following Kipps' notice of dismissal
that Miss
  Walshingham came into the shop. She came in with a dark, slender lady, rather
  faded, rather tightly dressed, whom Kipps was to know some day as her mother.
  He discovered them in the main shop, at the counter of the ribbon department.
  He had come to the opposite glove counter with some goods enclosed in a
  parcel that he had unpacked in his own department. The two ladies were both
  bent over a box of black ribbon.</p>

  <p>He had a moment of tumultuous hesitations. The etiquette of the situation
  was incomprehensible. He put down his goods very quietly and stood, hands on
  counter, staring at these two ladies. Then, as Miss Walshingham sat back, the
  instinct of flight seized him...</p>

  <p>He returned to his Manchester shop wildly agitated. Directly he was out of
  sight of her he wanted to see her. He fretted up and down the counter, and
  addressed some snappish remarks to the apprentice in the window. He fumbled
  for a moment with a parcel, untied it needlessly, began to tie it up again,
  and then bolted back again into the main shop. He could hear his own heart
  beating.</p>

  <p>The two ladies were standing in the manner of those who have completed
  their purchases and are waiting for their change. Mrs. Walshingham regarded
  some remnants with impersonal interest; Helen's eyes searched the shop. They
  distinctly lit up when they discovered Kipps.</p>

  <p>He dropped his hands to the counter by habit, and stood for a moment
  regarding her awkwardly. What would she do? Would she cut him? She came
  across the shop to him.</p>

  <p>'How are you, Mr. Kipps?' she said, in her clear, distinct tones, and she
  held out her hand. 'Very well, thank you,' said Kipps; 'how are you?'</p>

  <p>She said she had been buying some ribbon.</p>

  <p>He became aware of Mrs. Walshingham very much surprised. This checked
  something allusive about the class, and he said instead that he supposed she
  was glad to be having her holidays now. She said she was, it gave her more
  time for reading and that sort of thing. He supposed that she would be going
  abroad, and she thought that perhaps they would go to Knocke or Bruges for a
  time.</p>

  <p>Then came a pause, and Kipps' soul surged within him. He wanted to tell
  her he was leaving and would never see her again. He could find neither words
  nor voice to say it. The swift seconds passed. The girl in the ribbons was
  handing Mrs. Walshingham her change. 'Well,' said Miss Walshingham,
  'good-bye,' and gave him her hand again.</p>

  <p>Kipps bowed over her hand. His manners, his counter manners, were the
  easiest she had ever seen upon him. She turned to her mother. It was no good
  now, no good. Her mother! You couldn't say a thing like that before her
  mother! All was lost but politeness. Kipps rushed for the door. He stood at
  the door bowing with infinite gravity, and she smiled and nodded as she went
  out. She saw nothing of the struggle within him, nothing but a gratifying
  emotion. She smiled like a satisfied goddess as the incense ascends.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Walshingham bowed stiffly and a little awkwardly.</p>

  <p>He remained holding the door open for some seconds after they had passed
  out, then rushed suddenly to the back of the 'costume' window to watch them
  go down the street. His hands tightened on the window rack as he stared. Her
  mother appeared to be asking discreet questions. Helen's bearing suggested
  the off-hand replies of a person who found the world a satisfactory place to
  live in. 'Really, Mumsie, you cannot expect me to cut my own students dead,'
  she was, in fact, saying&mdash;</p>

  <p>They vanished round Henderson's corner.</p>

  <p>Gone! And he would never see her again&mdash;never!</p>

  <p>It was as though some one had struck his heart with a whip. Never! Never!
  Never! And she didn't know! He turned back from the window, and the
  department, with its two apprentices, was impossible. The whole glaring world
  was insupportable.</p>

  <p>He hesitated, and made a rush, head down, for the cellar that was his
  Manchester warehouse. Rogers asked him a question that he pretended not to
  hear.</p>

  <p>The Manchester warehouse was a small cellar apart from the general
  basement of the building, and dimly lit by a small gas flare. He did not turn
  that up, but rushed for the darkest corner, where, on the lowest shelf, the
  Sale window-tickets were stored. He drew out the box of these with trembling
  hands and upset them on the floor, and so, having made himself a justifiable
  excuse for being on the ground with his head well in the dark, he could let
  his poor bursting little heart have its way with him for a space.</p>

  <p>And there he remained until the cry of 'Kipps! Forward!' summoned him once
  more to face the world.</p>

  <h2>
<a id="chap16"
     name="chap16"></a>VI. &mdash; THE UNEXPECTED</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Now in the slack of that same day, after the midday dinner
and before the
  coming of the afternoon customers, this disastrous Chitterlow descended upon
  Kipps with the most amazing coincidence in the world. He did not call
  formally, entering and demanding Kipps, but privately, in a confidential and
  mysterious manner. Kipps was first aware of him as a dark object bobbing
  about excitedly outside the hosiery window. He was stooping and craning and
  peering in the endeavour to see into the interior between and over the socks
  and stockings. Then he transferred his attention to the door, and after a
  hovering scrutiny, tried the baby-linen display. His movements and gestures
  suggested a suppressed excitement.</p>

  <p>Seen by daylight, Chitterlow was not nearly such a magnificent figure as
  he had been by the subdued nocturnal lightings and beneath the glamour of his
  own interpretation. The lines were the same, indeed, but the texture was
  different. There was a quality about the yachting cap, an indefinable
  finality of dustiness, a shiny finish on all the salient surfaces of the
  reefer coat. The red hair and the profile, though still forcible and fine,
  were less in the quality of Michelangelo and more in that of the merely
  picturesque. But it was a bright, brown eye still that sought amidst the
  interstices of the baby-linen.</p>

  <p>Kipps was by no means anxious to interview Chitterlow again. If he had
  felt sure that Chitterlow would not enter the shop, he would have hid in the
  warehouse until the danger was past, but he had no idea of Chitterlow's
  limitations. He decided to keep up the shop in the shadows until Chitterlow
  reached the side window of the Manchester department, and then to go outside
  as if to inspect the condition of the window and explain to him that things
  were unfavourable to immediate intercourse. He might tell him he had already
  lost his situation...</p>

  <p>"Ullo, Chit'low,' he said, emerging.</p>

  <p>'Very man I want to see,' said Chitterlow, shaking with vigour. 'Very man
  I want to see.' He laid a hand on Kipps' arm. 'How old are you, Kipps?'</p>

  <p>'One-and-twenty,' said Kipps. 'Why?'</p>

  <p>'Talk about coincidences! And your name, now? Wait a minute.' He held out
  a finger. 'Is it Arthur?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'You're the man,' said Chitterlow.</p>

  <p>'What man?'</p>

  <p>'It's about the thickest coincidence I ever struck,' said Chitterlow,
  plunging his extensive hand into his breast coat pocket. 'Half a jiff and
  I'll tell you your mother's Christian name.' He laughed and struggled with
  his coat for a space, produced a washing-book and two pencils, which he
  deposited in his side pocket, then in one capacious handful, a bent but by no
  means finally disabled cigar, the rubber proboscis of a bicycle pump, some
  twine and a lady's purse, and finally a small pocket-book, and from this
  after dropping and recovering several visiting-cards, he extracted a
  carelessly torn piece of newspaper. 'Euphemia,' he read, and brought his face
  close to Kipps'. 'Eh?' He laughed noisily. 'It's about as fair a Bit of All
  Right as any one could have&mdash;outside a coincidence play. Don't say her
  name wasn't Euphemia, Kipps, and spoil the whole blessed show.'</p>

  <p>'Whose name Euphemia?' asked Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Your mother's.'</p>

  <p>'Lemme see what it says on the paper.'</p>

  <p>Chitterlow handed him the fragment and turned away.</p>

  <p>'You may say what you like,' he said, addressing a vast, deep laugh to the
  street generally.</p>

  <p>Kipps attempted to read. 'WADDY or KIPPS. If Arthur Waddy or Arthur Kipps,
  the son of Margaret Euphemia Kipps, who&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Chitterlow's finger swept over the print. 'I went down the column, and
  every blessed name that seemed to fit my play I took. I don't believe in
  made-up names. As I told you. I'm all with Zola in that. Documents whenever
  you can. I like 'em hot and real. See? Who was Waddy?'</p>

  <p>'Never heard his name.'</p>

  <p>'Not Waddy?'</p>

  <p>'No!'</p>

  <p>Kipps tried to read again, and abandoned the attempt. 'What does it mean?'
  he said. 'I don't understand.'</p>

  <p>'It means,' said Chitterlow, with a momentary note of lucid exposition,
  'so far as I can make out, that you're going to strike it Rich. Never mind
  about the Waddy&mdash;that's a detail. What does it usually mean? You'll hear
  of something to your advantage&mdash;very well. I took that newspaper up to
  get my names by the merest chance. Directly I saw it again and read
  that&mdash;I knew it was you. I believe in coincidences. People say they
  don't happen. I say they do. Everything's a coincidence. Seen properly. Here
  you are. Here's one! Incredible? Not a bit of it! See? It's you! Kipps! Waddy
  be damned! It's a Mascot. There's luck in my play. Bif! You're there. I'm
  there. Fair in it! Snap!' And he discharged his fingers like a pistol. 'Never
  you mind about the 'Waddy."</p>

  <p>'Eh?' said Kipps, with a nervous eye on Chitterlow's fingers.</p>

  <p>'You're all right,' said Chitterlow, 'you may bet the seat of your only
  breeches on that! Don't you worry about the Waddy&mdash;that's as clear as
  day. You're about as right side up as a billiard ball...whatever you do.
  Don't stand there gaping, man! Read the paper if you don't believe me. Read
  it!'</p>

  <p>He shook it under Kipps' nose.</p>

  <p>Kipps became aware of the second apprentice watching them from the shop.
  His air of perplexity gave place to a more confident bearing.</p>

  <p>'&mdash;who was born at East Grinstead.' I certainly was born there. I've
  'eard my Aunt say&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I knew it,' said Chitterlow, taking hold of one edge of the paper and
  bringing his face close alongside Kipps'. '&mdash;on September the first,
  eighteen hundred and seventy-eight&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'That's all right,' said Chitterlow. 'It's all, all right, and all you
  have to do is to write to Watson and Bean and get it&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Get what?'</p>

  <p>'Whatever it is.'</p>

  <p>Kipps sought his moustache. 'You'd write?' he asked. 'Ra-ther.'</p>

  <p>'But what do you think it is?'</p>

  <p>'That's the fun of it!' said Chitterlow, taking three steps in some as yet
  uninvented dance. 'That's where the joke comes in. It may be
  anything&mdash;it may be a million. If so! Where does little Harry come in?
  Eh?'</p>

  <p>Kipps was trembling slightly. 'But&mdash;' he said, and thought. 'If you
  was me&mdash;' he began. 'About that Waddy&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>He glanced up and saw the second apprentice disappear with amazing
  swiftness from behind the goods in the window.</p>

  <p>'What?' asked Chitterlow, but he never had an answer.</p>

  <p>'Lor! There's the guv'nor!' said Kipps, and made a prompt dive for the
  door.</p>

  <p>He dashed in, only to discover that Shalford, with the junior apprentice
  in attendance, had come to mark off remnants of Kipps' cotton dresses, and
  was demanding him. 'Hallo, Kipps,' he said, 'outside&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'Seein' if the window was straight, Sir,' said Kipps. 'Umph!' said
  Shalford.</p>

  <p>For a space Kipps was too busily employed to think at all of Chitterlow or
  the crumpled bit of paper in his trouser pocket. He was, however, painfully
  aware of a suddenly disconnected excitement at large in the street. There
  came one awful moment when Chitterlow's nose loomed interrogatively over the
  ground glass of the department door, and his bright little red-brown eye
  sought for the reason of Kipps' disappearance, and then it became evident
  that he saw the high light of Shalford's baldness, and grasped the situation
  and went away. And then Kipps (with that advertisement in his pocket) was
  able to come back to the business in hand.</p>

  <p>He became aware that Shalford had asked a question. 'Yessir, nosir,
  rightsir. I'm sorting up zephyrs to-morrow, Sir,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>Presently he had a moment to himself again, and, taking up a safe position
  behind a newly unpacked pile of summer lace curtains, he straightened out the
  piece of paper and re-perused it. It was a little perplexing. That 'Arthur
  Waddy or Arthur Kipps'&mdash;did that imply two persons or one? He would ask
  Pearce or Buggins. Only&mdash;</p>

  <p>It had always been impressed upon him that there was something demanding
  secrecy about his mother.</p>

  <p>'Don't you answer no questions about your mother,' his aunt had been wont
  to say. 'Tell them you don't know, whatever it is they ask you.'</p>

  <p>Now, this&mdash;?</p>

  <p>Kipps' face became portentously careful, and he rugged at his moustache,
  such as it was, hard.</p>

  <p>He had always represented his father as being a 'gentleman farmer.' 'It
  didn't pay,' he used to say, with a picture in his own mind of a penny
  magazine aristocrat prematurely worn out by worry. 'I'm a Norfan, both
  sides,' he would explain, with the air of one who had seen trouble. He said
  he lived with his uncle and aunt, but he did not say that they kept a
  toy-shop, and to tell any one that his uncle had been a butler&mdash;a
  servant!&mdash;would have seemed the maddest of indiscretions. Almost all the
  assistants in the Emporium were equally reticent and vague, so great is their
  horror of 'Lowness' of any sort. To ask about this 'Waddy or Kipps' would
  upset all these little fictions. He was not, as a matter of fact, perfectly
  clear about his real status in the world (he was not, as a matter of fact,
  perfectly clear about anything), but he knew that there was a quality about
  his status that was&mdash;detrimental.</p>

  <p>Under the circumstances&mdash;?</p>

  <p>It occurred to him that it would save a lot of trouble to destroy the
  advertisement there and then. In which case he would have to explain to
  Chitterlow!</p>

  <p>'Eng!' said Mr. Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Kipps!' cried Carshot, who was shop-walking. 'Kipps Forward!'</p>

  <p>He thrust back the crumpled paper into his pocket, and sallied forth to
  the customer.</p>

  <p>'I want,' said the customer, looking vaguely about her through glasses, 'a
  little bit of something to cover a little stool I have. Anything would
  do&mdash;a remnant or anything.'</p>

  <p>The matter of the advertisement remained in abeyance for half an hour, and
  at the end the little stool was still a candidate for covering, and Kipps had
  a thoroughly representative collection of the textile fabrics in his
  department to clear away. He was so angry about the little stool that the
  crumpled advertisement lay for a space in his pocket, absolutely
  forgotten.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Kipps sat on his tin box under the gas-bracket that
evening, and looked up
  the name Euphemia, and learnt what it meant in the 'Inquire Within About
  Everything' that constituted Buggins' reference library. He hoped Buggins,
  according to his habit, would ask him what he was looking for, but Buggins
  was busy turning out his week's washing. 'Two collars,' said Buggins, 'half
  pair socks, two dickeys. Shirt?...M'm. There ought to be another collar
  somewhere'.</p>

  <p>'Euphemia,' said Kipps at last, unable altogether to keep to himself this
  suspicion of a high origin that floated so delightfully about him.
  'Eu-phemia; it isn't a name common people would give a girl, is it?'</p>

  <p>'It isn't the name any decent people would give to a girl,' said Buggins,
  'common or not.'</p>

  <p>'Lor!' said Kipps. 'Why?'</p>

  <p>'It's giving girls names like that,' said Buggins, 'that nine times out of
  ten makes 'em go wrong. It unsettles 'em. If ever I was to have a girl, if
  ever I was to have a dozen girls, I'd call 'em all Jane. Every one of 'em.
  You couldn't have a better name than that. Euphemia, indeed! What
  next?...Good Lord!...That isn't one of my collars there, is it, under your
  bed?'</p>

  <p>Kipps got him the collar.</p>

  <p>'I don't see no great 'arm in Euphemia,' he said as he did so.</p>

  <p>After that he became restless. 'I'm a good mind to write that letter,' he
  said; and then, finding Buggins preoccupied wrapping his washing up in the
  'sox,' added to himself, 'a thundering good mind.'</p>

  <p>So he got his penny bottle of ink, borrowed the pen from Buggins, and with
  no very serious difficulty in spelling or composition, did as he had
  resolved.</p>

  <p>He came back into the bedroom about an hour afterwards, a little out of
  breath and pale. 'Where you been?' said Buggins, who was now reading the
  Daily World Manager, which came to him in rotation from Carshot.</p>

  <p>'Out to post some letters,' said Kipps, hanging up his hat. 'Crib
  hunting?'</p>

  <p>'Mostly,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Rather,' he added, with a nervous laugh; 'what else?'</p>

  <p>Buggins went on reading. Kipps sat on his bed and regarded the back of the
  Daily World Manager thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'Buggins,' he said at last.</p>

  <p>Buggins lowered his paper and looked.</p>

  <p>'I say, Buggins, what do these here advertisements mean that say so-and-
  so will hear of something greatly to his advantage?'</p>

  <p>'Missin' people,' said Buggins, making to resume reading.</p>

  <p>'How d'yer mean?' asked Kipps. 'Money left and that sort of thing?'</p>

  <p>Buggins shook his head. 'Debts,' he said, 'more often than not.'</p>

  <p>'But that ain't to his advantage.'</p>

  <p>'They put that to get 'old of 'em', said Buggins. 'Often it's wives.'</p>

  <p>'What you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Deserted wives try and get their husbands back that way.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose it is legacies sometimes, eh? Perhaps if some one was left a
  hundred pounds by some one&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Hardly ever,' said Buggins.</p>

  <p>'Well, 'ow&mdash;?' began Kipps, and hesitated.</p>

  <p>Buggins resumed reading. He was very much excited by a leader on Indian
  affairs. 'By Jove!' he said, 'it won't do to give these here Blacks
  votes.'</p>

  <p>'No fear,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'They're different altogether,' said Buggins. 'They 'aven't the sound
  sense of Englishmen, and they 'aven't the character. There's a sort of tricky
  dishonesty about 'em&mdash;false witness and all that&mdash;of which an
  Englishman has no idea. Outside their courts of law&mdash;it's a pos'tive
  fact, Kipps&mdash;there's witnesses waitin' to be 'ired. Reg'lar trade. Touch
  their 'ats as you go in. Englishmen 'ave no idea, I tell you&mdash;not
  ord'nary Englishmen. It's in their blood. They're too timid to be honest. Too
  slavish. They aren't used to being free like we are, and if you gave 'em
  freedom they woudn't make a proper use of it. Now, we&mdash;Oh, Damn!'</p>

  <p>For the gas had suddenly gone out, and Buggins had the whole column of
  Society Club Chat still to read.</p>

  <p>Buggins could talk of nothing after that but Shalford's meanness in
  turning off the gas, and after being extremely satirical about their
  employer, undressed in the dark, hit his bare toe against a box, and
  subsided, after unseemly ejaculations, into silent ill-temper.</p>

  <p>Though Kipps tried to get to sleep before the affair of the letter he had
  just posted resumed possession of his mind, he could not do so. He went over
  the whole thing again, quite exhaustively.</p>

  <p>Now that his first terror was abating, he couldn't quite determine whether
  he was glad or sorry that he had posted that letter. If it should happen to
  be a hundred pounds!</p>

  <p>It must be a hundred pounds!</p>

  <p>If it was he could hold out for a year, for a couple of years even, before
  he got a Crib.</p>

  <p>Even if it was fifty pounds&mdash;!</p>

  <p>Buggins was already breathing regularly when Kipps spoke again. 'Buggins,'
  he said.</p>

  <p>Buggins pretended to be asleep, and thickened his regular breathing (a
  little too hastily) to a snore.</p>

  <p>'I say, Buggins,' said Kipps, after an interval.</p>

  <p>'What's up now?' said Buggins, unamiably.</p>

  <p>'S'pose you saw an advertisement in a paper, with your name in it, see,
  asking you to come and see some one, like, so as to hear of something very
  much to your&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Hide,' said Buggins, shortly. 'But&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I'd hide.'</p>

  <p>'Er?'</p>

  <p>'Goo'-night, o'man,' said Buggins, with convincing earnestness. Kipps lay
  still for a long time, then blew profoundly, turned over and stared at the
  other side of the dark.</p>

  <p>He had been a fool to post that letter!</p>

  <p>Lord! Hadn't he been a fool!</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">It was just five days and a half after the light had been
turned out while
  Buggins was reading, that a young man with a white face, and eyes bright and
  wide open, emerged from a side road upon the Leas front. He was dressed in
  his best clothes, and, although the weather was fine, he carried his
  umbrella, just as if he had been to church. He hesitated, and turned to the
  right. He scanned each house narrowly as he passed it, and presently came to
  an abrupt stop. 'Hughenden,' said the gateposts in firm, black letters, and
  the fanlight in gold repeated 'Hughenden.' It was a stucco house, fit to take
  your breath away, and its balcony was painted a beautiful sea green,
  enlivened with gilding. He stood looking up at it.</p>

  <p>'Gollys!' he said at last in an awe-stricken whisper.</p>

  <p>It had rich-looking crimson curtains to all the lower windows, and brass-
  railed blinds above. There was a splendid tropical plant in a large artistic
  pot in the drawing-room window. There was a splendid bronzed knocker (ring
  also) and two bells&mdash;one marked 'servants.'</p>

  <p>'Gollys! Servants, eh?'</p>

  <p>He walked past away from it with his eyes regarding it, and then turned
  and came back. He passed through a further indecision, and finally drifted
  away to the sea front and sat down on a seat a little way along the Leas and
  put his arm over the back and regarded 'Hughenden.' He whistled an air very
  softly to himself, put his head first on one side and then on the other. Then
  for a space he scowled fixedly at it.</p>

  <p>A very stout old gentleman with a very red face and very protuberant eyes
  sat down beside Kipps, removed a Panama hat of the most abandoned desperado
  cut, and mopped his brow and blew. Then he began mopping the inside of his
  hat. Kipps watched him for a space, wondering how much he might have a year,
  and where he bought his hat. Then 'Hughenden' reasserted itself.</p>

  <p>An impulse overwhelmed him. 'I say,' he said, leaning forward to the old
  gentleman. The old gentleman started and stared.</p>

  <p>'What did you say?' he asked fiercely.</p>

  <p>'You wouldn't think,' said Kipps, indicating with his forefinger, 'that
  that 'ous there belongs to me.'</p>

  <p>The old gentleman twisted his neck round to look at 'Hughenden.' Then he
  came back to Kipps, looked at his mean little garments with apoplectic
  intensity, and blew at him by way of reply.</p>

  <p>'It does,' said Kipps, a little less confidently.</p>

  <p>'Don't be a fool,' said the old gentleman, and put his hat on and wiped
  out the corners of his eyes. 'It's hot enough,' panted the old gentleman
  indignantly, 'without Fools.' Kipps looked from the old gentleman to the
  house, and back to the old gentleman. The old gentleman looked at Kipps, and
  snorted and looked out to sea, and again, snorting very contemptuously, at
  Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Mean to say it doesn't belong to me?' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>The old gentleman just glanced over his shoulder at the house in dispute,
  and then fell to pretending Kipps didn't exist. 'It's been lef me this very
  morning,' said Kipps. 'It ain't the only one that's been lef me,
  neither.'</p>

  <p>'Aw!' said the old gentleman, like one who is sorely tried. He seemed to
  expect the passers-by presently to remove Kipps.</p>

  <p>'It 'as,' said Kipps. He made no further remark to the old gentleman for a
  space, but looked with a little less certitude at the house...</p>

  <p>'I got&mdash;' he said, and stopped.</p>

  <p>'It's no good telling you if you don't believe,' he said.</p>

  <p>The old gentleman, after a struggle with himself, decided not to have a
  fit. 'Try that game on with me,' he panted. 'Give you in charge.'</p>

  <p>'What game?'</p>

  <p>'Wasn't born yesterday,' said the old gentleman, and blew. 'Besides,' he
  added, 'look at you!'</p>

  <p>'I know you,' said the old gentleman, and coughed shortly and nodded to
  the horizon, and coughed again.</p>

  <p>Kipps looked dubiously from the house to the old gentleman and back to the
  house. Their conversation, he gathered, was over.</p>

  <p>Presently he got up and went slowly across the grass to its stucco portal
  again. He stood, and his mouth shaped the precious word, 'Hughenden.' It was
  all right! He looked over his shoulder as if in appeal to the old gentleman,
  then turned and went his way. The old gentleman was so evidently past all
  reason!</p>

  <p>He hung for a moment some distance along the parade, as though some
  invisible string was pulling him back. When he could no longer see the house
  from the pavement he went out into the road. Then with an effort he snapped
  the string.</p>

  <p>He went on down a quiet side street, unbuttoned his coat furtively, took
  out three bank-notes in an envelope, looked at them, and replaced them. Then
  he fished up five new sovereigns from his trouser pocket, and examined them.
  To such confidence had his exact resemblance to his dead mother's portrait
  carried Messrs. Watson and Bean.</p>

  <p>It was right enough. It really was all right.</p>

  <p>He replaced the coins with grave precaution, and went his way with a
  sudden briskness. It was all right&mdash;he had it now&mdash;he was a rich
  man at large. He went up a street and round a corner and along another
  street, and started towards the Pavilion, and changed his mind and came round
  back, resolved to go straight to the Emporium and tell them all.</p>

  <p>He was aware of some one crossing a road far off ahead of him, some one
  curiously relevant to his present extraordinary state of mind. It was
  Chitterlow. Of course, it was Chitterlow who had told him first of the whole
  thing! The playwright was marching buoyantly along a cross street. His nose
  was in the air, the yachting cap was on the back of his head, and the large
  freckled hand grasped two novels from the library, a morning newspaper, a new
  hat done up in paper, and a lady's net bag full of onions and tomatoes...</p>

  <p>He passed out of sight behind the wine-merchant's at the corner, as Kipps
  decided to hurry forward and tell him of the amazing change in the Order of
  the Universe that had just occurred.</p>

  <p>Kipps uttered a feeble shout, arrested as it began, and waved his
  umbrella. Then he set off at a smart pace in pursuit. He came round the
  corner, and Chitterlow had gone; he hurried to the next, and there was no
  Chitterlow; he turned back unavailingly, and his eyes sought some other
  possible corner. His hand fluttered to his mouth, and he stood for a space on
  the pavement edge, staring about him. No good!</p>

  <p>But the sight of Chitterlow was a wholesome thing, it connected events
  together, joined him on again to the past at a new point, and that was what
  he so badly needed...</p>

  <p>It was all right&mdash;all right.</p>

  <p>He became suddenly very anxious to tell everybody at the Emporium,
  absolutely everybody, all about it. That was what wanted doing. He felt that
  telling was the thing to make this business real. He gripped his umbrella
  about the middle, and walked very eagerly.</p>

  <p>He entered the Emporium through the Manchester department. He flung open
  the door (over whose ground glass he had so recently, in infinite
  apprehension, watched the nose of Chitterlow), and discovered the second
  apprentice and Pearce in conversation. Pearce was prodding his hollow tooth
  with a pin and talking in fragments about the distinctive characteristics of
  Good Style.</p>

  <p>Kipps came up in front of the counter.</p>

  <p>'I say,' he said. 'What d'yer think?'</p>

  <p>'What?' said Pearce over the pin.</p>

  <p>'Guess.'</p>

  <p>'You've slipped out because Teddy's in London.'</p>

  <p>'Something more.'</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'Been left a fortune.'</p>

  <p>'Garn!'</p>

  <p>'I 'ave.'</p>

  <p>'Get out!'</p>

  <p>'Straight. I been lef twelve 'undred pounds&mdash;twelve 'undred pounds a
  year!'</p>

  <p>He moved towards the little door out of the department into the house,
  moving as heralds say, regardant passant. Pearce stood with mouth wide open
  and pin poised in air.</p>

  <p>'No!' he said at last.</p>

  <p>'It's right,' said Kipps, 'and I'm going.'</p>

  <p>And he fell over the doormat into the house.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">It happened that Mr. Shalford was in London buying summer
sale goods, and,
  no doubt, also interviewing aspirants to succeed Kipps.</p>

  <p>So that there was positively nothing to hinder a wild rush of rumour from
  end to end of the Emporium. All the masculine members began their report with
  the same formula. 'Heard about Kipps?'</p>

  <p>The new girl in the cash desk had had it from Pearce, and had dashed out
  into the fancy shop to be the first with the news on the fancy side. Kipps
  had been left a thousand pounds a year&mdash;twelve thousand pounds a year.
  Kipps had been left twelve hundred thousand pounds. The figures were
  uncertain, but the essential facts they had correct. Kipps had gone upstairs.
  Kipps was packing his box. He said he wouldn't stop another day in the old
  Emporium not for a thousand pounds! It was said that he was singing ribaldry
  about old Shalford. He had come down! He was in the counting-house. There was
  a general movement thither. (Poor old Buggins had a customer, and couldn't
  make out what the deuce it was all about! Completely out of it, was
  Buggins.)</p>

  <p>There was a sound of running to and fro, and voices saying this, that, and
  the other thing about Kipps. Ring-a-dinger, ring-a-dinger went the dinner-
  bell, all unheeded. The whole of the Emporium was suddenly bright-eyed,
  excited, hungry to tell somebody, to find at any cost somebody who didn't
  know, and be first to tell them, 'Kipps has been left
  thirty&mdash;forty&mdash;fifty thousand pounds!'</p>

  <p>'What!' cried the senior porter. 'Him!' and ran up to the counting-house
  as eagerly as though Kipps had broken his neck.</p>

  <p>'One of our chaps just been left sixty thousand pounds,' said the first
  apprentice, returning after a great absence to his customer.</p>

  <p>'Unexpectedly?' said the customer. 'Quite,' said the first
  apprentice...</p>

  <p>'I'm sure if Any One deserves it, it's Mr. Kipps,' said Miss Mergle; and
  her train rustled as she hurried to the counting-house.</p>

  <p>There stood Kipps amidst a pelting shower of congratulations. His face was
  flushed, and his hair disordered. He still clutched his hat and best umbrella
  in his left hand. His right hand was any one's to shake rather than his own.
  (Ring-a-dinger, ring-a-dinger, ding, ding, ding, dang you! went the neglected
  dinner-bell.)</p>

  <p>'Good old Kipps!' said Pearce, shaking. 'Good old Kipps!' Booch rubbed one
  anaemic hand upon the other. 'You're sure it's all right, Mr. Kipps?' he said
  in the background. 'I'm sure we all congratulate him,' said Miss Mergle.
  'Great Scott!' said the new young lady in the glove department. 'Twelve
  hundred a year! Great Scott! You aren't thinking of marrying any one, are
  you, Mr. Kipps?'</p>

  <p>'Three pounds five and ninepence a day,' said Mr. Booch, working in his
  head almost miraculously...</p>

  <p>Every one, it seemed, was saying how glad they were it was Kipps, except
  the junior apprentice, upon whom&mdash;he being the only son of a widow, and
  used to having the best of everything as a right&mdash;an intolerable envy, a
  sense of unbearable wrong, had cast its gloomy shade. All the rest were quite
  honestly and simply glad&mdash;gladder, perhaps, at that time than Kipps,
  because they were not so overpowered...</p>

  <p>Kipps went downstairs to dinner, emitting fragmentary disconnected
  statements. 'Never expected anything of the sort...When this here old Bean
  told me, you could have knocked me down with a feather...He says, "You ben
  lef money." Even then I didn't expect it'd be mor'n a hundred pounds,
  perhaps. Something like that.'</p>

  <p>With the sitting down to dinner and the handing of plates, the excitement
  assumed a more orderly quality. The housekeeper emitted congratulations as
  she carved, and the maidservant became dangerous to clothes with the
  plates&mdash;she held them anyhow; one expected to see one upside down,
  even&mdash;she found Kipps so fascinating to look at. Every one was the
  brisker and hungrier for the news (except the junior apprentice), and the
  housekeeper carved with unusual liberality. It was High Old Times there under
  the gaslight, High Old Times. 'I'm sure if Any One deserves it,' said Miss
  Mergle&mdash;'pass the salt, please&mdash;it's Mr. Kipps.'</p>

  <p>The babble died away a little as Carshot began barking across the table at
  Kipps. 'You'll be a bit of a Swell, Kipps,' he said. 'You won't hardly know
  yourself.'</p>

  <p>'Quite the gentleman,' said Miss Mergle.</p>

  <p>'Many real gentlemen's families,' said the housekeeper, 'have to do with
  less.'</p>

  <p>'See you on the Leas,' said Carshot. 'My&mdash;!' He met the housekeeper's
  eye. She had spoken about that expression before. 'My eye!' he said tamely,
  lest words should mar the day.</p>

  <p>'You'll go to London, I reckon,' said Pearce. 'You'll be a man about town.
  We shall see you mashing 'em, with violets in your button 'ole, down the
  Burlington Arcade.'</p>

  <p>'One of these West End Flats. That'd be my style,' said Pearce. 'And a
  first-class club.'</p>

  <p>'Aren't these Clubs a bit 'ard to get into?' asked Kipps, open-eyed over a
  mouthful of potato.</p>

  <p>'No fear. Not for Money,' said Pearce. And the girl in the laces, who had
  acquired a cynical view of Modern Society from the fearless exposures of Miss
  Marie Corelli, said, 'Money goes everywhere nowadays, Mr. Kipps.'</p>

  <p>But Carshot showed the true British strain. 'If I was Kipps,' he said,
  pausing momentarily for a knifeful of gravy, 'I should go to the Rockies and
  shoot bears.'</p>

  <p>'I'd certainly 'ave a run over to Boulogne,' said Pearce, 'and look about
  a bit. I'm going to do that next Easter myself, anyhow&mdash;see if I
  don't.'</p>

  <p>'Go to Oireland, Mr. Kipps,' came the soft insistence of Biddy Murphy, who
  managed the big workroom, flushed and shining in the Irish way as she spoke,
  'Go to Oireland. Ut's the loveliest country in the world. Outside currs.
  Fishin', shoot-in', huntin'. An' pretty gals! Eh! You should see the Lakes of
  Killarney, Mr. Kipps!' And she expressed ecstasy by a facial pantomine, and
  smacked her lips.</p>

  <p>And presently they crowned the event. It was Pearce who said, 'Kipps, you
  ought to stand Sham!' And it was Carshot who found the more poetical word
  'Champagne.'</p>

  <p>'Rather!' said Kipps, hilariously; and the rest was a question of detail
  and willing emissaries. 'Here it comes!' they said, as the apprentice come
  down the staircase, 'How about the shop?' said some one. 'Oh, hang the shop!'
  said Carshot; and made gruntulous demands for a corkscrew with a thing to cut
  the wire. Pearce, the dog! had a wire-cutter in his pocket-knife. How
  Shalford would have stared at the gold-tipped bottles if he had chanced to
  take an early train! Bang went the corks, and bang! Gluck, gluck, gluck, and
  sizzle!</p>

  <p>When Kipps found them all standing about him under the gas flare, saying
  almost solemnly 'Kipps!' with tumblers upheld, 'Have it in tumblers,' Carshot
  had said, 'have it in tumblers. It isn't a wine like you have in glasses. Not
  like port and sherry. It cheers you up, but you don't get drunk. It isn't
  hardly stronger than lemonade. They drink it at dinner, some of 'em, every
  day.'</p>

  <p>'What! At three and six a bottle!' said the housekeeper, incredulously.
  'They don't stick at that,' said Carshot. 'Not the champagne sort.' The
  housekeeper pursed her lips and shook her head&mdash;</p>

  <p>When Kipps, I say, found them all standing up to toast him in that manner,
  there came such a feeling in his throat and face that for the life of him he
  scarcely knew for a moment whether he was not going to cry. 'Kipps!' they all
  said, with kindly eyes. It was very good of them, and hard there wasn't a
  stroke of luck for them all!</p>

  <p>But the sight of upturned chins and glasses pulled him together
  again...They did him honour. Unenviously and freely they did him honour.</p>

  <p>For example, Carshot, being subsequently engaged in serving cretonne, and
  desiring to push a number of rejected blocks up the counter in order to have
  space for measuring, swept them by a powerful and ill-calculated movement of
  the arm, with a noise like thunder, partly on to the floor, and partly on to
  the foot of the still gloomily preoccupied junior apprentice. And Buggins,
  whose place it was to shopwalk while Carshot served, shopwalked with quite
  unparalleled dignity, dangling a new season's sunshade with a crooked handle
  on one finger. He arrested each customer who came down the shop with a grave
  and penetrating look. 'Showing very tractive line new sheason' sunshade,' he
  would remark; and after a suitable pause, 'Markable thing, one our 'sistant
  leg'sy twelve 'undred a year. Very tractive. Nothing more to-day, mum? No!'
  And he would then go and hold the door open for them with perfect decorum,
  and with the sunshade dangling elegantly from his left hand...</p>

  <p>And the second apprentice, serving a customer with cheap ticking, and
  being asked suddenly if it was strong, answered remarkably,</p>

  <p>'Oo, no, mum! Strong! Why, it ain't 'ardly stronger than lemonade'...</p>

  <p>The head porter, moreover, was filled with a virtuous resolve to break the
  record as a lightning packer, and make up for lost time. Mr. Swaffenham of
  the Sandgate Riviera, for example, who was going to dinner that night at
  seven, received at half-past six, instead of the urgently needed dress shirt
  he expected, a corset specially adapted to the needs of persons inclined to
  embonpoint. A parcel of summer underclothing selected by the elder Miss
  Waldershawe was somehow distributed in the form of gratis additions
  throughout a number of parcels of a less intimate nature, and a box of
  millinery on approval to Lady Pamshort (at Wampachs) was enriched by the
  addition of the junior porter's cap...</p>

  <p>These little things, slight in themselves, witness, perhaps none the less
  eloquently to the unselfish exhilaration felt throughout the Emporium at the
  extraordinary and unexpected enrichment of Mr. Kipps.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">The bus that plies between New Romney and Folkestone is
painted a British
  red, and inscribed on either side with the word Tip-top' in gold amidst
  voluptuous scrolls. It is a slow and portly bus; even as a young bus it must
  have been slow and portly. Below it swings a sort of hold, hung by chains
  between the wheels and in the summer time the top has garden seats. The front
  over those two dauntless, unhurrying horses rises in tiers like a theatre;
  there is first a seat for the driver and his company, and above that a seat,
  and above that, unless my memory plays me false, a seat. You sit in a sort of
  composition by some Italian painter&mdash;a celestial group of you. There are
  days when it doesn't go&mdash;you have to find out. And so you get to New
  Romney. So you will continue to get to New Romney for many years, for the
  light railway concession along the coast is happily in the South Eastern
  Railway Company's keeping, and the peace of the marsh is kept inviolate save
  for the bicycle bells of such as Kipps and I. This bus it was, this ruddy,
  venerable and, under God's mercy, immortal bus, that came down the Folkestone
  hill with unflinching deliberation, and trundled through Sandgate and Hythe,
  and out into the windy spaces of the Marsh, with Kipps and all his fortunes
  on its brow.</p>

  <p>You figure him there. He sat on the highest seat diametrically above the
  driver, and his head was spinning and spinning with champagne and this
  stupendous Tomfoolery of Luck; and his heart was swelling, swelling indeed at
  times as though it would burst him, and his face toward the sunlight was
  transfigured. He said never a word, but ever and again as he thought of this
  or that, he laughed. He seemed full of chuckles for a time, detached and
  independent chuckles, chuckles that rose and burst on him like bubbles in a
  wine...He held a banjo sceptre-fashion and resting on his knee. He had always
  wanted a banjo, now he had got one at Melchior's, while he was waiting for
  the bus.</p>

  <p>There sat beside him a young servant, who was sucking peppermint, and a
  little boy with a sniff whose flitting eyes showed him curious to know why
  ever and again Kipps laughed, and beside the driver were two young men in
  gaiters talking about 'tegs.' And there sat Kipps, all unsuspected, twelve
  hundred a year as it were, except for the protrusion of the banjo, disguised
  as a common young man, and the young man in gaiters, to the left of the
  driver, eyed Kipps and his banjo, and especially his banjo, ever and again,
  as if he found it and him, with his rapt face, an insoluble enigma. And many
  a King has ridden into a conquered city with a lesser sense of splendour than
  Kipps.</p>

  <p>Their shadows grew long behind them, and their faces were transfigured in
  gold as they rumbled on towards the splendid west. The sun set before they
  had passed Dymchurch, and as they came lumbering into New Romney past the
  windmill the dusk had come.</p>

  <p>The driver handed down the banjo and the portmanteau, and Kipps having
  paid him, 'That's aw right,' he said to the change as a gentleman should,
  turned about, and ran the portmanteau smartly into old Kipps, whom the sound
  of the stopping of the bus had brought to the door of the shop in an
  aggressive mood and with his mouth full of supper.</p>

  <p>"Ullo, Uncle, didn't see you,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Blunderin' ninny,' said old Kipps. 'What's brought you here? Ain't early
  closing, is it? Not Toosday?'</p>

  <p>'Got some news for you, Uncle,' said Kipps, dropping the portmanteau.</p>

  <p>'Ain't lost your situation, 'ave you? What's that you got there? I'm
  blowed if it ain't a banjo, Goolord! Spendin' your money on banjoes! Don't
  put down your portmanty there&mdash;anyhow. Right in the way of everybody.
  I'm blowed if ever I saw such a boy as you've got lately. Here! Molly! And
  look here! What you got a portmanty for? Why! Goolord! You ain't really lost
  your place, 'ave you?'</p>

  <p>'Somethin's happened,' said Kipps, slightly dashed. 'It's all right,
  Uncle. I'll tell you in a minute.' Old Kipps took the banjo as his nephew
  picked up the portmanteau again.</p>

  <p>The living-room door opened quickly, showing a table equipped with
  elaborate simplicity for supper, and Mrs. Kipps appeared.</p>

  <p>'If it ain't young Artie!' she said. 'Why, whatever's brought you
  'ome?'</p>

  <p>"Ullo, Aunt,' said Artie. 'I'm coming in. I got somethin' to tell you.
  I've 'ad a bit of luck.'</p>

  <p>He wouldn't tell them all at once. He staggered with the portmanteau round
  the corner of the counter, set a bundle of children's tin pails into
  clattering oscillation, and entered the little room. He deposited his luggage
  in the corner beside the tall clock, and turned to his aunt and uncle again.
  His aunt regarded him doubtfully; the yellow light from the little lamp on
  the table escaped above the shade, and lit her forehand and the tip of her
  nose. It would be all right in a minute. He wouldn't tell them all at once.
  Old Kipps stood in the shop door with the banjo in his hand, breathing
  nosily. 'The fact is, Aunt, I've 'ad a bit of luck.'</p>

  <p>'You ain't been backin' gordless 'orses, Artie?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'No fear.'</p>

  <p>'It's a draw he's been in,' said old Kipps, still panting from the impact
  of the portmanteau, 'it's a dratted draw. Jest look here, Molly. He's won
  this 'ere trashy banjer and throwd up his situation on the strength of
  it&mdash;that's what he's done. Goin' about singing. Dash and plunge. Jest
  the very fault poor Pheamy always 'ad. Blunder right in, and no one mustn't
  stop 'er!'</p>

  <p>'You ain't thrown up your place, Artie, 'ave you?' said Mrs. Kipps. Kipps
  perceived his opportunity. 'I 'ave,' he said. 'I've throwed it up.'</p>

  <p>'What for?' said old Kipps.</p>

  <p>'So's to learn the banjo!'</p>

  <p>'Goo Lord!' said old Kipps, in horror to find himself verified. 'I'm going
  about playing,' said Kipps, with a giggle.</p>

  <p>'Goin' to black my face, Aunt, and sing on the beach. I'm going to 'ave a
  most tremenjous lark and earn any amount of money&mdash;you see. Twenty-six
  fousand pounds I'm going to earn just as easy as nothing!'</p>

  <p>'Kipps,' said Mrs. Kipps, 'he's been drinking!'</p>

  <p>They regarded their nephew across the supper table with long faces. Kipps
  exploded with laughter, and broke out again when his aunt shook her head very
  sadly at him. Then suddenly he fell grave. He felt he could keep it up no
  longer. 'It's all right, Aunt. Reely, I ain't mad, and I ain't been drinking.
  I been lef money. I been left twenty-six fousand pounds.'</p>

  <p>Pause.</p>

  <p>'And you thrown up your place?' said old Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Kipps, 'rather!'</p>

  <p>'And bort this banjer, put on your best noo trousers, and come right on
  'ere?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Mrs. Kipps, 'I&mdash;never&mdash;did!'</p>

  <p>'These ain't my noo trousers, Aunt,' said Kipps, regretfully. 'My noo
  trousers wasn't done.'</p>

  <p>'I shouldn't ha' thought that even you could ha' been such a fool as
  that,' said old Kipps.</p>

  <p>Pause.</p>

  <p>'It's all right,' said Kipps, a little disconcerted by their distrustful
  solemnity. 'It's all right, reely! Twenny-six thousan' pounds. And a
  'ouse.'</p>

  <p>Old Kipps pursed his lips and shook his head.</p>

  <p>'A 'ouse on the Leas. I could have gone there. Only I didn't. I didn't
  care to. I didn't know what to say. I wanted to come and tell you.'</p>

  <p>'How d'yer know the 'ouse&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'They told me.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said old Kipps, and nodded his head portentously towards his
  nephew, with the corners of his mouth pulled down in a strikingly
  discouraging way. 'Well, you are a young Gaby.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't think it of you, Artie!' said Mrs. Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Wadjer mean?' asked Kipps, faintly, looking from one to the other with a
  withered face.</p>

  <p>Old Kipps closed the shop door. 'They been 'avin' a lark with you,' said
  old Kipps, in a mournful undertone. 'That's what I mean, my boy. They jest
  been seein' what a Gaby like you 'ud do.'</p>

  <p>'I dessay that young Quodling was in it,' said Mrs. Kipps. "E's jest that
  sort.'</p>

  <p>(For Quodling of the green-baize bag had grown up to be a fearful dog, the
  terror of New Romney.) 'It's somebody after your place, very likely,' said
  old Kipps.</p>

  <p>Kipps looked from one sceptical reproving face to the other, and round him
  at the familiar shabby little room, with his familiar cheap portmanteau on
  the mended chair, and that banjo amidst the supper-things, like some
  irrevocable deed. Could he be rich indeed? Could it be that these things had
  really happened? Or had some insane fancy whirled him thither?</p>

  <p>Still&mdash;perhaps a hundred pounds&mdash;</p>

  <p>'But,' he said. 'It's all right, reely, Uncle. You don't think&mdash;? I
  'ad a letter.'</p>

  <p>'Got up,' said old Kipps.</p>

  <p>'But I answered it and went to a norfis.'</p>

  <p>Old Kipps felt staggered for a moment, but he shook his head and chins
  sagely from side to side. As the memory of old Bean and Shalford's revived,
  the confidence of Kipps came back to him.</p>

  <p>'I saw a nold gent, Uncle&mdash;perfect gentleman. And 'e told me all
  about it. Mos' respectable 'e was. Said 'is name was Watson and
  Bean&mdash;leastways 'e was Bean. Said it was lef me.'</p>

  <p>&mdash;Kipps suddenly dived into his breast pocket&mdash;'by my
  Grandfather&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The old people started.</p>

  <p>Old Kipps uttered an exclamation and wheeled round towards the
  mantelshelf, above which the daguerreotype of his lost younger sister smiled
  its fading smile upon the world.</p>

  <p>'Waddy, 'is name was,' said Kipps, with his hand still deep in his pocket.
  'It was 'is son was my father&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Waddy!' said old Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Waddy!' said Mrs. Kipps.</p>

  <p>'She'd never say,' said old Kipps.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence.</p>

  <p>Kipps fumbled with a letter, a crumpled advertisement and three banknotes.
  He hesitated between these items.</p>

  <p>'Why! That young chap what was arsting questions&mdash;' said old Kipps,
  and regarded his wife with an eye of amazement.</p>

  <p>'Must 'ave been,' said Mrs. Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Must 'ave been,' said old Kipps.</p>

  <p>'James,' said Mrs. Kipps, in an awe-stricken voice. 'After
  all&mdash;perhaps&mdash;it's true!'</p>

  <p>"Ow much did you say?' asked old Kipps. "Ow much did you say 'e'd lef
  you, me b'y?'</p>

  <p>It was thrilling, though not quite in the way Kipps had expected. He
  answered almost meekly across the meagre supper-things, with his documentary
  evidence in his hand,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Twelve 'undred pounds.' Proximately, he said. Twelve 'undred pounds a
  year. 'E made 'is will jest before 'e died&mdash;not mor'n a month ago. When
  'e was dying, 'e seemed to change like, Mr. Bean said. 'E'd never forgiven
  'is son, never&mdash;not till then. 'Is son 'ad died in Australia, years and
  years ago, and then 'e 'adn't forgiven 'im. You know&mdash;'is son what was
  my father. But jest when 'e was ill and dying 'e seemed to get worried like,
  and longing for some one of 'is own. And 'e told Mr. Bean it was 'im that had
  prevented them marrying. So 'e thought. That's 'ow it all come
  about...'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">At last Kipps' flaring candle went up the narrow,
uncarpeted staircase to
  the little attic that had been his shelter and refuge during all the days of
  his childhood and youth. His head was whirling. He had been advised, he had
  been warned, he had been flattered and congratulated, he had been given
  whisky and hot water and lemon and sugar; and his health had been drunk in
  the same. He had also eaten two Welsh rarebits&mdash;an unusual supper. His
  uncle was chiefly for his going into Parliament, his aunt was consumed with a
  great anxiety. 'I'm afraid he'll go and marry beneath him.'</p>

  <p>'Y'ought to 'ave a bit o' shootin' somewhere,' said old Kipps.</p>

  <p>'It's your duty to marry into a county family, Artie&mdash;remember
  that.'</p>

  <p>There's lots of young noblemen'll be glad to 'eng on to you,' said old
  Kipps. 'You mark my words. And borrow your money. And then good-day to
  ye.'</p>

  <p>'I got to be precious careful,' said Kipps. 'Mr. Bean said that.'</p>

  <p>'And you got to be precious careful of this old Bean,' said old Kipps. 'We
  may be out of the world in Noo Romney, but I've 'eard a bit about solicitors
  for all that. You keep your eye on old Bean, me b'y.'</p>

  <p>"Ow do we know what 'e's up to, with your money, even now?' said old
  Kipps, pursuing his uncomfortable topic.</p>

  <p>"E looked very respectable,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>Kipps undressed with great deliberation and with vast gasps of pensive
  margin. Twenty-six thousand pounds!</p>

  <p>His aunt's solicitude had brought back certain matters into the foreground
  that his 'Twelve 'undred a year!' had for a time driven away altogether. His
  thoughts went back to the wood-carving class. Twelve Hundred a Year. He sat
  on the edge of the bed in profound meditation, and his boots fell 'whop' and
  'whop' upon the floor, with a long interval between each 'whop.' Twenty-six
  thousand pounds. 'By Gum!' He dropped the remainder of his costume about him
  on the floor, got into bed, pulled the patchwork quilt over him, and put his
  head on the pillow that had been first to hear of Ann Pornick's accession to
  his heart. But he did not think of Ann Pornick now.</p>

  <p>It was about everything in the world except Ann Pornick that he seemed to
  be trying to think of&mdash;simultaneously. All the vivid happenings of the
  day came and went in his overtaxed brain&mdash;'that old Bean' explaining and
  explaining, the fat man who wouldn't believe, an overpowering smell of
  peppermint, the banjo, Miss Mergle saying he deserved it, Chitterlow
  vanishing round a corner, the wisdom and advice and warnings of his aunt and
  uncle. She was afraid he would marry beneath him, was she? She didn't
  know...</p>

  <p>His brain made an excursion into the woodcarving class and presented Kipps
  with the picture of himself amazing that class by a modest yet clearly
  audible remark, 'I been left twenty-six thousand pounds.' Then he told them
  all quietly but firmly that he had always loved Miss
  Walshingham&mdash;always, and so he had brought all his twenty-six thousand
  pounds with him to give to her there and then. He wanted nothing in
  return...Yes, he wanted nothing in return. He would give it to her all in an
  envelope and go. Of course he would keep the banjo&mdash;and a little present
  for his aunt and uncle&mdash;and a new suit perhaps&mdash;and one or two
  other things she would not miss. He went off at a tangent. He might buy a
  motor-car, he might buy one of these here things that will play you a
  piano&mdash;that would make old Buggins sit up! He could pretend he had
  learnt to play&mdash;he might buy a bicycle and a cyclist suit...</p>

  <p>A terrific multitude of plans of what he might do, and in particular of
  what he might buy, came crowding into his brain, and he did not so much fall
  asleep as pass into a disorder of dreams in which he was driving a four-horse
  Tip-Top coach down Sandgate Hill ('I shall have to be precious careful'),
  wearing innumerable suits of clothes, and through some terrible accident
  wearing them all wrong. Consequently, he was being laughed at. The coach
  vanished in the interest of the costume. He was wearing golfing suits and a
  silk hat. This passed into a nightmare that he was promenading on the Leas in
  a Highland costume, with a kilt that kept shrinking, and Shalford was
  following him with three policemen. 'He's my assistant,' Shalford kept
  repeating; 'he's escaped. He's an escaped Improver. Keep by him, and in a
  minute you'll have to run him in. I know 'em. We say they wash but they
  won't'...He could feel the kilt creeping up his legs. He would have tugged at
  it to pull it down, only his arms were paralysed. He had an impression of
  giddy crises. He uttered a shriek of despair. 'Now!' said Shalford. He woke
  in horror, his quilt had slipped off the bed.</p>

  <p>He had a fancy he had just been called, that he had somehow overslept
  himself and missed going down for dusting. Then he perceived it was still
  night, and light by reason of the moonlight, and that he was no longer in the
  Emporium. He wondered where he could be. He had a curious fancy that the
  world had been swept and rolled up like a carpet, and that he was nowhere. It
  occurred to him that perhaps he was mad. 'Buggins!' he said. There was no
  answer, not even the defensive snore. No room, no Buggins, nothing!</p>

  <p>Then he remembered better. He sat on the edge of his bed for some time.
  Could any one have seen his face, they would have seen it white, and drawn,
  with staring eyes. Then he groaned weakly. 'Twenty-six thousand pounds!' he
  whispered.</p>

  <p>Just then it presented itself in an almost horribly overwhelming mass.</p>

  <p>He remade his bed and returned to it. He was still dreadfully wakeful. It
  was suddenly clear to him that he need never trouble to get up punctually at
  seven again. That fact shone out upon him like a star through clouds. He was
  free to lie in bed as long as he liked, get up when he liked, go where he
  liked; have eggs every morning for breakfast, or rashers, or bloater-paste,
  or...Also he was going to astonish Miss Walshingham...</p>

  <p>Astonish her and astonish her...</p>

  <p>He was awakened by a thrush singing in the fresh dawn. The whole room was
  flooded with warm, golden sunshine. 'I say!' said the thrush. 'I say! I say!
  Twelve 'Undred a Year! Twelve 'UNDRED a Year! I say! I say! I say!'</p>

  <p>He sat up in bed and rubbed the sleep from his eyes with his knuckles.
  Then he jumped out of bed and began dressing very eagerly. He did not want to
  lose any time in beginning the new life.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="book2"
     name="book2">BOOK TWO - MR. COOTE THE CHAPERON</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21"></a>I. &mdash; THE NEW CONDITIONS</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">There comes a gentlemanly figure into these events, and for
a space takes
  a leading part therein, a Good Influence, a refined and amiable figure, Mr.
  Chester Coote. You must figure him as about to enter our story, walking with
  a curious rectitude of bearing through the evening dusk towards the Public
  Library, erect, large-headed&mdash;he had a great big head, full of the
  suggestion of a powerful mind well under control&mdash;with a large,
  official-looking envelope in his white and knuckly hand. In the other he
  carries a gold-handled cane. He wears a silken gray jacket suit, buttoned
  up, and anon he coughs behind the official envelope. He has a prominent nose,
  slaty gray eyes, and a certain heaviness about the mouth. His mouth hangs
  breathing open, with a slight protrusion of the lower jaw. His straw hat is
  pulled down a little in front, and he looks each person he passes in the eye,
  and, directly his look is answered, looks away.</p>

  <p>Thus Mr. Chester Coote, as he was on the evening when he came upon Kipps.
  He was a local house-agent, and a most active and gentlemanly person, a
  conscious gentleman, equally aware of society and the serious side of life.
  From amateur theatricals of a nice refined sort to science classes, few
  things were able to get along without him. He supplied a fine full bass, a
  little flat and quavery perhaps, but very abundant, to the St. Stylites'
  choir...</p>

  <p>He goes on towards the Public Library, lifts the envelope in salutation to
  a passing curate, smiles, and enters...It was in the Public Library that he
  came upon Kipps.</p>

  <p>By that time Kipps had been rich a week or more, and the change in his
  circumstances was visible upon his person. He was wearing a new suit of drab
  flannels, a Panama hat, and a red tie for the first time, and he carried a
  silver-mounted stick with a tortoiseshell handle. He felt extraordinarily
  different, perhaps more different than he really was, from the meek Improver
  of a week ago. He felt as he felt Dukes must feel, yet at bottom he was still
  modest. He was leaning on his stick and regarding the indicator with a
  respect that never palled. He faced round to meet Mr. Coote's overflowing
  smile.</p>

  <p>'What are you doang hea?' asked Mr. Chester Coote. Kipps was momentarily
  abashed. 'Oh,' he said slowly, and then, 'Mooching round a bit.'</p>

  <p>That Coote should address him with this easy familiarity was a fresh
  reminder of his enhanced social position. 'Jest mooching round,' he said. 'I
  been back in Folkestone free days now. At my 'ouse, you know.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' said Mr. Coote. 'I haven't yet had an opportunity of congratulating
  you on your good fortune.'</p>

  <p>Kipps held out his hand. 'It was the cleanest surprise that ever was,' he
  said. 'When Mr. Bean told me of it&mdash;you could have knocked me down with
  a feather.'</p>

  <p>'It must mean a tremendous change for you.'</p>

  <p>'O-o. Rather. Change? Why, I'm like the chap in the song they sing, I
  don't 'ardly know where I are. You know.'</p>

  <p>'An extraordinary change,' said Mr. Coote. 'I can quite believe it. Are
  you stopping in Folkestone?'</p>

  <p>'For a bit. I got a 'ouse, you know. What my grandfather 'ad. I'm stopping
  there. His housekeeper was kept on. Fancy&mdash;being in the same town and
  everything!'</p>

  <p>'Precisely,' said Mr. Coote. 'That's it,' and coughed like a sheep behind
  four straight fingers.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Bean got me to come back to see to things. Else I was out in New
  Romney, where my uncle and aunt live. But it's a lark coming back. In a
  way...'</p>

  <p>The conversation hung for a moment. 'Are you getting a book?' asked
  Coote.</p>

  <p>'Well, I 'aven't got a ticket yet. But I shall get one all right, and have
  a go in at reading. I've often wanted to. Rather. I was just 'aving a look at
  this Indicator. First-class idea. Tells you all you want to know.'</p>

  <p>'It's simple,' said Coote, and coughed again, keeping his eyes fixed on
  Kipps. For a moment they hung, evidently disinclined to part. Then Kipps
  jumped at an idea he had cherished for a day or more&mdash;not particularly
  in relation to Coote, but in relation to any one.</p>

  <p>'You doing anything?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Just called with a papah about the classes.'</p>

  <p>'Because&mdash;Would you care to come up and look at my 'ouse and 'ave a
  smoke and a chat&mdash;eh?' He made indicative back jerks of the head, and
  was smitten with a horrible doubt whether possibly this invitation might not
  be some hideous breach of etiquette. Was it, for example, the correct hour?
  'I'd be awfully glad if you would,' he added.</p>

  <p>Mr. Coote begged for a moment while he handed the official-looking
  envelope to the librarian, and then declared himself quite at Kipps' service.
  They muddled a moment over precedence at each door they went through, and so
  emerged to the street.</p>

  <p>'It feels awful rum to me at first, all this,' said Kipps. "Aving a 'ouse
  of my own&mdash;and all that. It's strange, you know. 'Aving all day. Reely I
  don't 'ardly know what to do with my time.'</p>

  <p>'D'ju smoke?' he said suddenly, proffering a magnificent gold-decorated
  pig-skin cigarette case, which he produced from nothing, almost as though it
  was some sort of trick. Coote hesitated and declined, and then with great
  liberality, 'Don't let me hinder you...'</p>

  <p>They walked a little way in silence, Kipps being chiefly concerned to
  affect ease in his new clothes and keeping a wary eye on Coote. 'It's rather
  a big windfall,' said Coote presently. 'It yields you an income&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'Twelve 'undred a year,' said Kipps. 'Bit over&mdash;if anything.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think of living in Folkestone?'</p>

  <p>'Don't know 'ardly yet. I may. Then again, I may not. I got a furnished
  'ouse, but I may let it.'</p>

  <p>'Your plans are undecided?'</p>

  <p>'That's jest it,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Very beautiful sunset it was to-night,' said Coote, and Kipps said,
  'Wasn't it?' and they began to talk of the merits of sunsets. Did Kipps
  paint? Not since he was a boy. He didn't believe he could now. Coote said his
  sister was a painter, and Kipps received this intimation with respect. Coote
  sometimes wished he could find time to paint himself, but one couldn't do
  everything, and Kipps said that was 'jest it.'</p>

  <p>They came out presently upon the end of the Leas, and looked down to where
  the squat, dark masses of the harbour and harbour station, gemmed with
  pin-point lights, crouched against the twilight gray of the sea. 'If one
  could do that,' said Coote; and Kipps was inspired to throw his head back,
  cock it on one side, regard the harbour with one eye shut, and say that it
  would take some doing. Then Coote said something about 'Abend,' which Kipps
  judged to be in a foreign language, and got over by lighting another
  cigarette from his by no means completed first one. 'You're right&mdash;puff,
  puff.'</p>

  <p>He felt that so far he had held up his end of the conversation in a very
  creditable manner, but that extreme discretion was advisable.</p>

  <p>They turned away, and Coote remarked that the sea was good for crossing,
  and asked Kipps if he had been over the water very much. Kipps said he hadn't
  been&mdash;'much,' but he thought very likely he'd have a run over to
  Boulogne soon; and Coote proceeded to talk of the charms of foreign travel,
  mentioning quite a number of unheard-of places by name. He had been to them!
  Kipps remained on the defensive, but behind his defences his heart sank. It
  was all very well to pretend, but presently it was bound to come out. He
  didn't know anything of all this&mdash;</p>

  <p>So they drew near the house. At his own gate Kipps became extremely
  nervous. It was a fine impressive door. He knocked neither a single knock nor
  a double but about one and a half&mdash;an apologetic half. They were
  admitted by an irreproachable housemaid with a steady eye, before which Kipps
  cringed dreadfully. He hung up his hat and fell about over hall chairs and
  things. 'There's a fire in the study, Mary?' he had the audacity to ask,
  though evidently he knew, and led the way upstairs panting. He tried to shut
  the door and discovered the housemaid behind him coming to light his lamp.
  This enfeebled him further. He said nothing until the door closed behind her.
  Meanwhile to show his sang-froid, he hummed and flitted towards the window
  and here and there.</p>

  <p>Coote went to the big hearthrug and turned and surveyed his host. His hand
  went to the back of his head and patted his occiput&mdash;a gesture frequent
  with him.</p>

  <p>"Ere we are,' said Kipps, hands in his pockets, and glancing round
  him.</p>

  <p>It was a gaunt, Victorian room, with a heavy, dirty cornice, and the
  ceiling enriched by the radiant plaster ornament of an obliterated gas
  chandelier. It held two large glass-fronted bookcases, one of which was
  surmounted by a stuffed terrier encased in glass. There was a mirror over the
  mantel, and hangings and curtains of magnificent crimson patternings. On the
  mantel were a huge black clock of classical design, vases in the Burslem
  Etruscan style, spills, and toothpicks in large receptacles of carved rock,
  large lava ash-trays, and an exceptionally big box of matches. The fender was
  very great and brassy. In a favourable position under the window was a
  spacious rosewood writing-desk, and all the chairs and other furniture were
  of rosewood and well stuffed.</p>

  <p>'This,' said Kipps, in something near an undertone, 'was the o'
  gentleman's study&mdash;my grandfather that was. 'E used to sit at that desk
  and write.'</p>

  <p>'Books?'</p>

  <p>'No. Letters to the Times and things like that. 'E's got 'em all cut
  out&mdash;stuck in a book...Leastways he 'ad. It's in that bookcase...Won't
  you sit down?'</p>

  <p>Coote did, blowing very slightly, and Kipps secured his vacated position
  on the extensive black-skin rug. He spread out his legs compass fashion, and
  tried to appear at his ease. The rug, the fender, the mantel, and mirror,
  conspired with great success to make him look a trivial and intrusive little
  creature amidst their commonplace hauteur, and his own shadow on the opposite
  wall seemed to think everything a great lark, and mocked and made tremendous
  fun of him&mdash;.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">For a space Kipps played a defensive game, and Coote drew
the lines of the
  conversation. They kept away from the theme of Kipps' change of fortune, and
  Coote made remarks upon local and social affairs. 'You must take an interest
  in these things now,' was as much as he said in the way of personalities. But
  it speedily became evident that he was a person of wide and commanding social
  relationships. He spoke of 'society' being mixed in the neighbourhood, and of
  the difficulty of getting people to work together and 'do' things; they were
  cliquish. Incidentally he alluded quite familiarly to men with military
  titles and once even to some one with a title, a Lady Punnet.</p>

  <p>Not snobbishly, you understand, nor deliberately, but quite in passing. He
  had, it appeared, talked to Lady Punnet about private theatricals! In
  connection with the hospitals. She had been reasonable, and he had put her
  right&mdash;gently, of course, but firmly. 'If you stand up to these people,'
  said Coote, 'they like you all the better.' It was also very evident he was
  at his ease with the clergy; 'my friend Mr. Densmore&mdash;a curate, you
  know, and rather curious, the Reverend and Honourable.' Coote grew visibly in
  Kipps' eyes as he said these things; he became, not only the exponent of
  'Vagner or Vargner,' the man whose sister had painted a picture to be
  exhibited at the Royal Academy, the type of the hidden thing called culture,
  but a delegate, as it were, or at least an intermediary from that great world
  'up there,' where there were men-servants, where there were titles, where
  people dressed for dinner, drank wine at meals, wine costing very often as
  much as three and sixpence the bottle, and followed through a maze of
  etiquette, the most stupendous practices...</p>

  <p>Coote sat back in the arm-chair smoking luxuriously and expanding
  pleasantly with the delightful sense of savoir faire; Kipps sat forward, his
  elbows on his chair arm, alert, and his head a little on one side. You figure
  him as looking little and cheap, and feeling smaller and cheaper amidst his
  new surroundings. But it was a most stimulating and interesting conversation.
  And soon it became less general, and more serious and intimate. Coote spoke
  of people who had got on, and of people who hadn't; of people who seemed to
  be in everything, and people who seemed to be out of everything; and then he
  came round to Kipps.</p>

  <p>'You'll have a good time,' he said abruptly, with a smile that would have
  interested a dentist. 'I dunno,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'There's mistakes, of course.'</p>

  <p>'That's jest it.'</p>

  <p>Coote lit a new cigarette. 'One can't help being interested in what you
  will do,' he remarked. 'Of course&mdash;for a young man of spirit, come
  suddenly into wealth&mdash;there's temptations.'</p>

  <p>'I got to go careful,' said Kipps. 'O' Bean told me that at the very
  first.'</p>

  <p>Coote went on to speak of pitfalls, of Betting, of Bad Companions. 'I
  know,' said Kipps, 'I know.'</p>

  <p>'There's Doubt again,' said Coote. 'I know a young fellow&mdash;a
  solicitor&mdash;handsome, gifted. And yet, you know&mdash;utterly sceptical.
  Practically altogether a Sceptic.'</p>

  <p>'Lor!' said Kipps, 'not a Natheist?'</p>

  <p>'I fear so,' said Coote. 'Really, you know, an awfully fine young
  fellow&mdash;Gifted! But full of this dreadful Modern Spirit&mdash;Cynical!
  All this Overman stuff. Nietzsche and all that...I wish I could do something
  for him.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' said Kipps, and knocked the ash off his cigarette. 'I know a
  chap&mdash;one of our apprentices he was&mdash;once. Always scoffing...He
  lef.'</p>

  <p>He paused. 'Never wrote for his refs,' he said, in the deep tone proper to
  a moral tragedy; and then, after a pause, 'Enlisted!'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' said Coote.</p>

  <p>'And often,' he said, after a pause, 'it's just the most spirited chaps,
  just the chaps one likes best, who Go Wrong.'</p>

  <p>'It's temptation,' Kipps remarked.</p>

  <p>He glanced at Coote, leant forward, knocked the ash from his cigarette
  into the mighty fender. 'That's jest it,' he said, 'you get tempted. Before
  you know where you are.'</p>

  <p>'Modern life,' said Coote, 'is so&mdash;complex. It isn't every one is
  Strong. Half the young fellows who go wrong aren't really bad.'</p>

  <p>'That's jest it,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'One gets a tone from one's surroundings&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'That's exactly it,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>He meditated. 'I picked up with a chap,' he said. 'A Nacter. Leastways, he
  writes plays. Clever feller. But&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He implied extensive moral obloquy by a movement of his head. 'Of course
  it's seeing life,' he added.</p>

  <p>Coote pretended to understand the full implications of Kipps' remark. 'Is
  it worth it?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'That's jest it,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>He decided to give some more. 'One gets talking,' he said. Then it's "Ave
  a drink!' Old Methuselah three stars&mdash;and where are you? 'I been drunk,'
  he said, in a tone of profound humility, and added, 'lots of times.'</p>

  <p>'Tt&mdash;tt,' said Coote.</p>

  <p>'Dozens of times,' said Kipps, smiling sadly; and added, 'lately.'</p>

  <p>His imagination became active and seductive. 'One thing leads to another.
  Cards, p'raps. Girls&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Coote, 'I know.'</p>

  <p>Kipps regarded the fire, and flushed slightly. He borrowed a sentence that
  Chitterlow had recently used. 'One can't tell tales out of school,' he
  said.</p>

  <p>'I can imagine it,' said Coote.</p>

  <p>Kipps looked with a confidential expression into Coote's face. 'It was bad
  enough when money was limited,' he remarked. 'But now'&mdash;he spoke with
  raised eyebrows&mdash;'I got to steady down.'</p>

  <p>'You must' said Coote, protruding his lips into a sort of whistling
  concern for a moment.</p>

  <p>'I must,' said Kipps, nodding his head slowly, with raised eyebrows. He
  looked at his cigarette end and threw it into the fender. He was beginning to
  think he was holding his own in this conversation rather well after all.</p>

  <p>Kipps was never a good liar. He was the first to break silence. 'I don't
  mean to say I been reely bad or reely bad drunk. A 'eadache,
  perhaps&mdash;three or four times, say. But there it is!'</p>

  <p>'I have never tasted alcohol in my life,' said Coote, with an immense
  frankness, 'never!'</p>

  <p>'No?'</p>

  <p>'Never. I don't feel I should be likely to get drunk at all&mdash;it isn't
  that. And I don't go so far as to say even that in small quantities&mdash;at
  meals&mdash;it does one harm. But if I take it, some one else who doesn't
  know where to stop&mdash;you see?'</p>

  <p>'That's jest it,' said Kipps, with admiring eyes.</p>

  <p>'I smoke,' admitted Coote. 'One doesn't want to be a Pharisee.'</p>

  <p>It struck Kipps what a tremendously Good chap this Coote was, not only
  tremendously clever and educated and a gentleman, and one knowing Lady
  Punnet, but Good. He seemed to be giving all his time and thought to doing
  good things to other people. A great desire to confide certain things to him
  arose. At first Kipps hesitated whether he should confide an equal desire for
  Benevolent activities or for further Depravity&mdash;either was in his mind.
  He rather affected the pose of the Good Intentioned Dog. Then suddenly his
  impulses took quite a different turn&mdash;fell, indeed, into what was a far
  more serious rut in his mind. It seemed to him Coote might be able to do for
  him something he very much wanted done.</p>

  <p>'Companionship accounts for so much,' said Coote.</p>

  <p>'That's jest it,' said Kipps. 'Of course, you know, in my new
  position&mdash;That's just the difficulty.'</p>

  <p>He plunged boldly at his most secret trouble. He knew that he wanted
  refinement&mdash;culture. It was all very well&mdash;but he knew. But how was
  one to get it? He knew no one, knew no people&mdash;He rested on the broken
  sentence. The shop chaps were all very well, very good chaps and all that,
  but not what one wanted. 'I feel be'ind,' said Kipps. 'I feel out of it. And
  consequently I feel it's no good. And then if temptation comes
  along&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' said Coote.</p>

  <p>Kipps spoke of his respect for Miss Walshingham and her freckled friend.
  He contrived not to look too selfconscious. 'You know, I'd like to talk to
  people like that, but I can't. A chap's afraid of giving himself away.'</p>

  <p>'Of course,' said Coote, 'of course.'</p>

  <p>'I went to a middle-class school, you know. You mustn't fancy I'm one of
  these here board-school chaps, but you know it reely wasn't a first-class
  affair. Leastways he didn't take pains with us. If you didn't want to learn
  you needn't. I don't believe it was much better than one of these here
  national schools. We wore mortar-boards, o' course. But what's that?</p>

  <p>'I'm a regular fish out of water with this money. When I got it&mdash;it's
  a week ago&mdash;reely I thought I'd got everything I wanted. But I dunno
  what to do.'</p>

  <p>His voice went up into a squeak. 'Practically,' he said, 'it's no good
  shuttin' my eyes to things&mdash;I'm a gentleman.'</p>

  <p>Coote indicated a serious assent.</p>

  <p>'And there's the responsibilities of a gentleman,' he remarked. 'That's
  jest it,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'There's calling on people,' said Kipps. 'If you want to go on knowing
  Someone you knew before, like. People that's refined.' He laughed nervously.
  'I'm a regular fish out of water,' he said, with expectant eyes on Coote.</p>

  <p>But Coote only nodded for him to go on.</p>

  <p>'This actor chap,' he meditated, 'is a good sort of chap. But 'e isn't
  what I call a gentleman. I got to 'old myself in with 'im. 'E'd make me go it
  wild in no time. 'E's pretty near the on'y chap I know. Except the shop
  chaps. They've come round to 'ave supper once already and a bit of a
  sing-song afterwards. I sang. I got a banjo, you know, and I vamp a bit.
  Vamping&mdash;you know. Haven't got far in the book&mdash;'Ow to
  Vamp&mdash;but still I'm getting on. Jolly, of course, in a way, but what
  does it lead to?...Besides that, there's my aunt and uncle. They're very good
  old people&mdash;very&mdash;jest a bit interfering p'r'aps, and thinking one
  isn't grown up, but Right enough. Only&mdash;It isn't what I want. I feel
  I've got be'ind with everything. I want to make it up again. I want to get
  with educated people who know 'ow to do things&mdash;in the regular proper
  way.'</p>

  <p>His beautiful modesty awakened nothing but benevolence in the mind of
  Chester Coote. 'If I had some one like you,' said Kipps, 'that I knew regular
  like&mdash;'</p>

  <p>From that point their course ran swift and easy. 'If I could be of any use
  to you,' said Coote...'But you're so busy, and all that.'</p>

  <p>'Not too busy. You know, your case is a very interesting one. It was
  partly that made me speak to you and draw you out. Here you are with all this
  money and no experience, a spirited young chap&mdash;'</p>

  <p>That's jest it,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'I thought I'd see what you were made of, and I must confess I've rarely
  talked to any one that I've found quite so interesting as you have
  been&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I seem able to say things to you, like, somehow,' said Kipps. 'I'm glad.
  I'm tremendously glad.'</p>

  <p>'I want a Friend. That's it&mdash;straight.'</p>

  <p>'My dear chap, if I&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes; but&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I want a Friend too.'</p>

  <p>'Reely?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. You know, my dear Kipps&mdash;if I may call you that.'</p>

  <p>'Go on,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'I'm rather a lonely dog myself. This to-night&mdash;I've not had any one
  I've spoken to so freely of my Work for months.'</p>

  <p>'No?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. And, my dear chap, if I can do anything to guide or help
  you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Coote displayed all his teeth in a kindly tremulous smile, and his eyes
  were shiny. 'Shake 'ands,' said Kipps, deeply moved; and he and Coote rose
  and clasped with mutual emotion.</p>

  <p>'It's reely too good of you,' said Kipps. 'Whatever I can do I will,' said
  Coote.</p>

  <p>And so their compact was made. From that moment they were friends&mdash;
  intimate, confidential, high-thinking sotto-voce friends. All the rest of
  their talk (and it inclined to be interminable) was an expansion of that. For
  that night Kipps wallowed in self-abandonment, and Coote behaved as one who
  had received a great trust. That sinister passion for pedagogy to which the
  Good-Intentioned are so fatally liable, that passion of infinite presumption
  that permits one weak human being to arrogate the direction of another weak
  human being's affairs, had Coote in its grip. He was to be a sort of lay
  confessor and director of Kipps; he was to help Kipps in a thousand ways; he
  was, in fact, to chaperon Kipps into the higher and better sort of English
  life. He was to tell him his faults, advise him about the right thing to
  do&mdash;</p>

  <p>'It's all these things I don't know,' said Kipps. 'I don't know, for
  instance, what's the right sort of dress to wear&mdash;I don't even know if
  I'm dressed right now&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'All these things'&mdash;Coote stuck out his lips and nodded rapidly to
  show he understood&mdash;'trust me for that,' he said; 'trust me.'</p>

  <p>As the evening wore on Coote's manner changed, became more and more the
  manner of a proprietor. He began to take up his role, to survey Kipps with a
  new, with a critical affection. It was evident the thing fell in with his
  ideas. 'It will be awfully interesting,' he said. 'You know, Kipps, you're
  really good stuff.' (Every sentence now he said 'Kipps,' or 'my dear Kipps,'
  with a curiously authoritative intonation.)</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Kipps, 'only there's such a lot of things I don't seem to
  be up to some'ow. That's where the trouble comes in.'</p>

  <p>They talked and talked, and now Kipps was talking freely. They rambled
  over all sorts of things. Among others Kipps' character was dealt with at
  length. Kipps gave valuable lights on it. 'When I'm reely excited,' he said,
  'I don't seem to care what I do. I'm like that.' And again, 'I don't like to
  do anything under'and. I must speak out&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He picked a piece of cotton from his knee, the fire grimaced behind his
  back, and his shadow on the wall and ceiling was disrespectfully
  convulsed.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Kipps went to bed at last with an impression of important
things settled,
  and he lay awake for quite a long time. He felt he was lucky. He had
  known&mdash;in fact Buggins and Carshot and Pearce had made it very clear
  indeed&mdash;that his status in life had changed, and that stupendous
  adaptations had to be achieved; but how they were to be effected had driven
  that adaptation into the incredible. Here, in the simplest, easiest way, was
  the adapter. The thing had become possible. Not, of course, easy, but
  possible.</p>

  <p>There was much to learn, sheer intellectual toil, methods of address,
  bowing, an enormous complexity of laws. One broken, you are an outcast. How,
  for example, would one encounter Lady Punnet? It was quite possible some day
  he might really have to do that. Coote might introduce him. 'Lord!' he said
  aloud to the darkness between grinning and dismay. He figured himself going
  into the Emporium, to buy a tie, for example, and there in the face of
  Buggins, Carshot, Pearce, and the rest of them, meeting 'my friend, Lady
  Punnet!' It might not end with Lady Punnet! His imagination plunged and
  bolted with him, galloped, took wings, and soared to romantic, to poetical
  altitudes&mdash;</p>

  <p>Suppose some day one met Royalty. By accident, say! He soared to that!
  After all&mdash;twelve hundred a year is a lift, a tremendous lift. How did
  one address Royalty? 'Your Majesty's Goodness' it would be, no
  doubt&mdash;something like that&mdash;and on the knees. He became impersonal.
  Over a thousand a year made him an Esquire, didn't it? He thought that was
  it. In which case, wouldn't he have to be presented at court? Velvet
  breeches, like you wear cycling, and a sword! What a curious place a court
  must be! Kneeling and bowing; and what was it Miss Mergle used to talk about?
  Of course!&mdash;ladies with long trains walking about backward. Everybody
  walked about backward at court, he knew, when not actually on their knees.
  Perhaps, though, some people regular stood up to the King! Talked to him,
  just as one might talk to Buggins, say. Cheek, of course! Dukes, it might be,
  did that&mdash;by permission? Millionaires?...</p>

  <p>From such thoughts this free citizen of our Crowned Republic passed
  insensibly into dreams&mdash;turgid dreams of that vast ascent which
  constitutes the true-born Briton's social scheme, which terminates with
  retrogressive progression and a bending back.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">The next morning he came down to breakfast looking
grave&mdash;a man with
  much before him in the world.</p>

  <p>Kipps made a very special thing of his breakfast. Daily once hopeless
  dreams came true then. It had been customary in the Emporium to supplement
  Shalford's generous, indeed unlimited, supply of bread and butter-substitute
  by private purchases, and this had given Kipps very broad artistic
  conceptions of what the meal might be. Now there would be a cutlet or so or a
  mutton chop&mdash;this splendour Buggins had reported from the great London
  clubs&mdash;haddock, kipper, whiting, or fish-balls, eggs, boiled or
  scrambled, or eggs and bacon, kidney also frequently, and sometimes liver.
  Amidst a garland of such themes, sausages, black and white puddings,
  bubble-and-squeak, fried cabbage and scallops, came and went. Always as camp
  followers came potted meat in all varieties, cold bacon, German sausage,
  brawn, marmalade, and two sorts of jam; and when he had finished these he
  would sit among his plates and smoke a cigarette, and look at all these
  dishes crowded round him with beatific approval. It was his principal meal.
  He was sitting with his cigarette regarding his apartment with the
  complacency begotten of a generous plan of feeding successfully realised,
  when newspapers and post arrived.</p>

  <p>There were several things by the post, tradesmen's circulars and cards,
  and two pathetic begging letters&mdash;his luck had got into the
  papers&mdash;and there was a letter from a literary man and a book to enforce
  his request for 10s. to put down Socialism. The book made it very clear that
  prompt action on the part of property owners was becoming urgent, if property
  was to last out the year. Kipps dipped in it, and was seriously perturbed.
  And there was a letter from old Kipps, saying it was difficult to leave the
  shop and come over and see him again just yet, but that he had been to a sale
  at Lydd the previous day, and bought a few good old books and things it would
  be difficult to find the equal of in Folkestone. 'They don't know the value
  of these things out here,' wrote old Kipps, 'but you may depend upon it they
  are valuable,' and a brief financial statement followed. 'There is an
  engraving some one might come along and offer you a lot of money for one of
  these days. Depend upon it, these old things are about the best investment
  you could make...'</p>

  <p>Old Kipps had long been addicted to sales, and his nephew's good fortune
  had converted what had once been but a looking and a craving&mdash;he had
  rarely even bid for anything in the old days, except the garden tools or the
  kitchen gallipots or things like that, things one gets for sixpence and finds
  a use for&mdash;into a very active pleasure. Sage and penetrating
inspection, a
  certain mystery of bearing, tactical bids and
  Purchase&mdash;Purchase!&mdash;the old man had had a good time.</p>

  <p>While Kipps was re-reading the begging letters, and wishing he had the
  sound, clear common sense of Buggins to help him a little, the Parcels Post
  brought along the box from his uncle. It was a large, insecure-looking case,
  held together by a few still loyal nails, and by what the British War Office
  would have recognised at once as an Army Corps of string&mdash;rags, and odds
  and ends tied together. Kipps unpacked it with a table knife, assisted at a
  critical point by the poker, and found a number of books and other objects of
  an antique type.</p>

  <p>There were three bound volumes of early issues of Chambers' Journal, a
  copy of Punch's Pocket Book for 1875, Sturm's Reflections, an early version
  of Gill's Geography (slightly torn), an illustrated work on Spinal Curvature,
  an early edition of Kirke's Human Physiology, The Scottish Chiefs, and a
  little volume on the Language of Flowers. There was a fine steel engraving,
  oak-framed, and with some rusty spots, done in the Colossal style and
  representing the Handwriting on the Wall. There were also a copper kettle, a
  pair of candle-snuffers, a brass shoe-horn, a tea-caddy to lock, two
  decanters (one stoppered), and what was probably a portion of an
  eighteenth-century child's rattle. Kipps examined these objects one by one,
  and wished he knew more about them. Turning over the pages of the Physiology
  again, he came upon a striking plate, in which a youth of agreeable profile
  displayed his interior in an unstinted manner to the startled eye. It was a
  new view of humanity altogether for Kipps, and it arrested his mind.
  'Chubes,' he whispered. 'Chubes.'</p>

  <p>This anatomised figure made him forget for a space that he was
  'practically a gentleman' altogether, and he was still surveying its
  extraordinary complications when another reminder of a world quite outside
  those spheres of ordered gentility into which his dreams had carried him
  overnight arrived (following the servant) in the person of
  Chitterlow.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">"Ullo!' said Kipps, rising.</p>

  <p>'Not busy?' said Chitterlow, enveloping Kipps' hand for a moment in one of
  his own, and tossing the yachting cap upon the monumental carved oak
  sideboard.</p>

  <p>'Only a bit of reading,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Reading, eh?' Chitterlow cocked the red eye at the books and other
  properties for a moment and then, 'I've been expecting you round again one
  night.'</p>

  <p>'I been coming round,' said Kipps; 'on'y there's a chap 'ere&mdash;I was
  coming round last night, on'y I met 'im.'</p>

  <p>He walked to the hearthrug. Chitterlow drifted round the room for a time,
  glancing at things as he talked. 'I've altered that play tremendously since I
  saw you,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Pulled it all to pieces.'</p>

  <p>'What play's that, Chitlow?'</p>

  <p>'The one we were talking about. You know. You said something&mdash;I don't
  know if you meant it&mdash;about buying half of it. Not the tragedy. I
  wouldn't sell my own twin brother a share in that. That's my investment.
  That's my serious Work. No! I mean that new farce I've been on to. Thing with
  the business about a beetle.'</p>

  <p>'Oo yes,' said Kipps. 'I remember.'</p>

  <p>'I thought you would. Said you'd take a fourth share for a hundred pounds.
  You know.'</p>

  <p>'I seem to remember something&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Well, it's all different. Every bit of it. I'll tell you. You remember
  what you said about a butterfly. You got confused, you know&mdash;Old Meth.
  Kept calling the beetle a butterfly, and that set me off. I've made it quite
  different. Quite different. Instead of Popplewaddle&mdash;thundering good
  farce-name that, you know, for all that it came from a Visitors'
  List&mdash;instead of Popplewaddle getting a beetle down his neck and rushing
  about, I've made him a collector&mdash;collects butterflies, and this one you
  know's a rare one. Comes in at window, centre!' Chitterlow began to
  illustrate with appropriate gestures. 'Pop rushes about after it. Forgets he
  mustn't let on he's in the house. After that&mdash;Tells 'em. Rare butterfly,
  worth lots of money. Some are, you know. Every one's on to it after that.
  Butterfly can't get out of the room; every time it comes out to have a try,
  rush, and scurry. Well, I've worked on that. Only&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He came very close to Kipps. He held up one hand horizontally and tapped
  it in a striking and confidential manner with the fingers of the other.
  'Something else,' he said. That's given me a Real Ibsenish Touch&mdash;like
  the Wild Duck. You know that woman&mdash;I've made her lighter&mdash;and she
  sees it. When they're chasing the butterfly the third time, she's on! She
  looks. 'That's me!' she says. Bif! Pestered Butterfly. She's the Pestered
  Butterfly. It's legitimate. Much more legitimate than the Wild
  Duck&mdash;where there isn't a duck!</p>

  <p>'Knock 'em! The very title ought to knock 'em. I've been working like a
  horse at it...You'll have a goldmine in that quarter share, Kipps...I don't
  mind. It's suited me to sell it, and suited you to buy. Bif!'</p>

  <p>Chitterlow interrupted his discourse to ask, 'You haven't any brandy in
  the house, have you? Not to drink, you know. But I want just an eggcupful to
  pull me steady. My liver's a bit queer...It doesn't matter if you haven't.
  Not a bit. I'm like that. Yes, whisky'll do. Better!'</p>

  <p>Kipps hesitated for a moment, then turned and fumbled in the cupboard of
  his sideboard. Presently he disinterred a bottle of whisky and placed it on
  the table. Then he put out first one bottle of soda-water, and, after the
  hesitation of a moment, another. Chitterlow picked up the bottle and read the
  label. 'Good old Methuselah,' he said. Kipps handed him the corkscrew, and
  then his hand fluttered up to his mouth. 'I'll have to ring now,' he said,
  'to get glasses.' He hesitated for a moment before doing so, leaning
  doubtfully, as it were, towards a bell.</p>

  <p>When the housemaid appeared, he was standing on the hearthrug with his
  legs wide apart, with the bearing of a desperate fellow. And after they had
  both had whiskies, 'You know a decent whisky,' Chitterlow remarked, and took
  another, 'just to drink.' Kipps produced cigarettes, and the conversation
  flowed again.</p>

  <p>Chitterlow paced the room. He was, he explained, taking a day off; that
  was why he had come round to see Kipps. Whenever he thought of any extensive
  change in a play he was writing, he always took a day off. In the end it
  saved time to do so. It prevented his starting rashly upon work that might
  have to be re-written. There was no good in doing work when you might have to
  do it over again&mdash;none whatever.</p>

  <p>Presently they were descending the steps by the parade en route for the
  Warren, with Chitterlow doing the talking and going with a dancing drop from
  step to step...</p>

  <p>They had a great walk, not a long one, but a great one. They went up by
  the Sanatorium, and over the East Cliff and into that queer little wilderness
  of slippery and tumbling clay and rock under the chalk cliffs&mdash;a
  wilderness of thorn and bramble, wild rose and wayfaring tree, that adds so
  greatly to Folkestone's charm. They traversed its intricacies, and clambered
  up to the crest of the cliffs at last by a precipitous path that Chitterlow
  endowed in some mysterious way with suggestions of Alpine adventure. Every
  now and then he would glance aside at sea and cliffs with a fresh boyishness
  of imagination that brought back New Romney and the stranded wrecks to Kipps'
  memory; but mostly he talked of his great obsession, of plays and playwriting
  and that empty absurdity that is so serious to its kind, his Art. That was a
  thing that needed a monstrous lot of explaining. Along they went, sometimes
  abreast, sometimes in single file, up the little paths and down the little
  paths, and in among the bushes and out along the edge above the beach; and
  Kipps went along trying ever and again to get an insignificant word in
  edgeways, and the gestures of Chitterlow flew wide and far, and his great
  voice rose and fell, and he said this and he said that, and he biffed and
  banged into the circumambient Inane.</p>

  <p>It was assumed that they were embarked upon no more trivial enterprise
  than the Reform of the British Stage, and Kipps found himself classed with
  many opulent and even royal and noble amateurs&mdash;the Honourable Thomas
  Norgate came in here&mdash;who had interested themselves in the practical
  realisation of high ideals about the Drama. Only he had a finer understanding
  of these things, and instead of being preyed upon by the common
  professional&mdash;'and they are a lot,' said Chitterlow; 'I haven't toured
  for nothing'&mdash;he would have Chitterlow. Kipps gathered a few details. It
  was clear he had bought the quarter of a farcical comedy&mdash;practically a
  goldmine&mdash;and it would appear it would be a good thing to buy the half.
  A suggestion, or the suggestion of a suggestion, floated out that he should
  buy the whole play and produce it forthwith. It seemed he was to produce the
  play upon a royalty system of a new sort, whatever a royalty system of any
  sort might be. Then there was some doubt after all, whether that farcical
  comedy was in itself sufficient to revolutionise the present lamentable state
  of the British Drama. Better, perhaps, for such a purpose was that
  tragedy&mdash;as yet unfinished&mdash;which was to display all that
  Chitterlow knew about women, and which was to centre about a Russian nobleman
  embodying the fundamental Chitterlow personality. Then it became clearer that
  Kipps was to produce several plays. Kipps was to produce a great number of
  plays. Kipps was to found a National Theatre&mdash;</p>

  <p>It is probable that Kipps would have expressed some sort of disavowal, if
  he had known how to express it. Occasionally his face assumed an expression
  of whistling meditation, but that was as far as he got towards protest.</p>

  <p>In the clutch of Chitterlow and the Incalculable, Kipps came round to the
  house in Fenchurch Street, and was there made to participate in the midday
  meal. He came to the house forgetting certain confidences, and was reminded
  of the existence of a Mrs. Chitterlow (with the finest completely untrained
  contralto voice in England) by her appearance. She had an air of being older
  than Chitterlow, although probably she wasn't and her hair was a reddish
  brown, streaked with gold. She was dressed in one of those complaisant
  garments that are dressing-gowns, or tea-gowns, or bathing wraps, or rather
  original evening robes, according to the exigencies of the moment&mdash;from
  the first Kipps was aware that she possessed a warm and rounded neck, and her
  well-moulded arms came and vanished from the sleeves&mdash;and she had large
  expressive eyes, that he discovered ever and again fixed in an enigmatical
  manner upon his own.</p>

  <p>A simple but sufficient meal had been distributed with careless
  spontaneity over the little round table in the room with the photographs and
  looking-glass, and when a plate had, by Chitterlow's direction, been taken
  from under the marmalade in the cupboard, and the kitchen fork and a knife
  that was not loose in its handle had been found for Kipps, they began and
  made a tumultuous repast. Chitterlow ate with quiet enormity, but it did not
  interfere with the flow of his talk. He introduced Kipps to his wife very
  briefly; she had obviously heard of Kipps before, and he made it vaguely
  evident that the production of the comedy was the thing chiefly settled. His
  reach extended over the table, and he troubled nobody. When Mrs. Chitterlow,
  who for a little while seemed socially self-conscious, reproved him for
  taking a potato with a jab of his fork, he answered, 'Well, you shouldn't
  have married a man of Genius,' and from a subsequent remark it was perfectly
  clear that Chitterlow's standing in this respect was made no secret of in his
  household.</p>

  <p>They drank old Methuselah and siphon soda, and there was no clearing away;
  they just sat among the plates and things, and Mrs. Chitterlow took her
  husband's tobacco-pouch and made a cigarette and smoked and blew smoke, and
  looked at Kipps with her large brown eyes. Kipps had seen cigarettes smoked
  by ladies before, for fun, but this was real smoking. It frightened him
  rather. He felt he must not encourage this lady&mdash;at any rate in
  Chitterlow's presence.</p>

  <p>They became very cheerful after the repast, and as there was now no waste
  to deplore, such as one experiences in the windy open air, Chitterlow gave
  his voice full vent. He fell to praising Kipps very highly and loudly. He
  said he had known Kipps was the right sort, he had seen it from the first,
  almost before he got up out of the mud on that memorable night. 'You can,' he
  said, 'sometimes. That was why&mdash;' He stopped, but he seemed on the verge
  of explaining that it was his certainty of Kipps being the right sort had led
  him to confer this great Fortune upon him. He left that impression. He threw
  out a number of long sentences and material for sentences of a highly
  philosophical and incoherent character about Coincidences. It became evident
  he considered dramatic criticism in a perilously low condition...</p>

  <p>About four Kipps found himself stranded, as it were, by a receding
  Chitterlow on a seat upon the Leas. He was chiefly aware that Chitterlow was
  an overwhelming personality. He puffed his cheeks and blew.</p>

  <p>No doubt this was seeing life, but had he particularly wanted to see life
  that day? In a way Chitterlow had interrupted him. The day he had designed
  for himself was altogether different from this. He had been going to read
  through a precious little volume called Don't that Coote had sent round for
  him&mdash;a book of invaluable hints, a summary of British deportment, that
  had only the one defect of being at points a little out of date.</p>

  <p>That reminded him he had intended to perform a difficult exercise called
  an Afternoon Call upon the Cootes, as a preliminary to doing it in deadly
  earnest upon the Walshinghams. It was no good to-day, anyhow, now.</p>

  <p>He came back to Chitterlow. He would have to explain to Chitterlow he was
  taking too much for granted&mdash;he would have to do that. It was so
  difficult to do in Chitterlow's presence, though; in his absence it was easy
  enough. This half-share, and taking a theatre and all of it, was going too
  far.</p>

  <p>The quarter share was right enough, he supposed, but even that&mdash;! A
  hundred pounds! What wealth is there left in the world after one has paid out
  a hundred pounds from it?</p>

  <p>He had to recall that, in a sense, Chitterlow had indeed brought him his
  fortune before he could face even that.</p>

  <p>You must not think too hardly of him. To Kipps, you see, there was as yet
  no such thing as proportion in these matters. A hundred pounds went to his
  horizon. A hundred pounds seemed to him just exactly as big as any other
  large sum of money.</p>

<a id="chap22"
     name="chap22"></a>II. &mdash; THE WALSHINGHAMS</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">The Cootes lived in a little house in Bouverie Square, with
a tangle of
  Virginia creeper up the veranda.</p>

  <p>Kipps had been troubled in his mind about knocking double or
  single&mdash;it is these things show what a man is made of&mdash;but happily
  there was a bell.</p>

  <p>A queer little maid with a big cap admitted Kipps, and took him through a
  bead curtain and a door into a little drawing-room, with a black and gold
  piano, a glazed bookcase, a Moorish cosy corner, and a draped looking-glass
  overmantel, bright with Regent Street ornaments and photographs of various
  intellectual lights. A number of cards of invitation to meetings and the
  match list of a Band of Hope cricket club were stuck into the looking-glass
  frame, with Coote's name as a Vice-President. There was a bust of Beethoven
  over the bookcase, and the walls were thick with conscientiously executed but
  carelessly selected 'views' in oil and water colours and gilt frames. At the
  end of the room, facing the light, was a portrait that struck Kipps at first
  as being Coote in spectacles and feminine costume, and that he afterwards
  decided must be Coote's mother. Then the original appeared, and he discovered
  that it was Coote's elder and only sister, who kept house for him. She wore
  her hair in a knob behind, and the sight of the knob suggested to Kipps an
  explanation for a frequent gesture of Coote's, a patting exploratory movement
  to the back of his head. And then it occurred to him that this was quite an
  absurd idea altogether.</p>

  <p>She said, 'Mr. Kipps, I believe,' and Kipps laughed pleasantly, and said,
  'That's it!' and then she told him that 'Chester' had gone down to the art
  school to see about sending off some drawings or other, and that he would be
  back soon. Then she asked Kipps if he painted, and showed him the pictures on
  the wall. Kipps asked her where each one was 'of,' and when she showed him
  some of the Leas slopes, he said he never would have recognised them. He said
  it was funny how things looked in a picture very often. 'But they're awfully
  good,' he said. 'Did you do them?' He would look at them with his neck arched
  like a swan's, his head back and on one side, and then suddenly peer closely
  into them. 'They are good. I wish I could paint.'</p>

  <p>'That's what Chester says,' she answered. 'I tell him he has better things
  to do.' Kipps seemed to get on very well with her.</p>

  <p>Then Coote came in, and they left her and went upstairs together, and had
  a good talk about reading and the rules of Life. Or rather Coote talked, and
  the praises of thought and reading were in his mouth...</p>

  <p>You must figure Coote's study, a little bedroom put to studious uses, and
  over the mantel an array of things he had been led to believe indicative of
  culture and refinement&mdash;an autotype of Rossetti's 'Annunciation,' an
  autotype of Watts's 'Minotaur,' a Swiss carved pipe with many joints, and a
  photograph of Amiens Cathedral (these two the spoils of travel), a
  phrenological bust, and some broken fossils from the Warren. A rotating
  bookshelf carried the Encyclopaedia Britannica (tenth edition), and on the
  top of it a large official-looking, age-grubby envelope, bearing the mystic
  words, 'On His Majesty's Service,' a number or so of the Bookman, and a box
  of cigarettes were lying. A table under the window bore a little microscope,
  some dust in a saucer, some grimy glass slips, and broken cover glasses, for
  Coote had 'gone in for' biology a little. The longer side of the room was
  given over to bookshelves, neatly edged with pinked American cloth, and with
  an array of books&mdash;no worse an array of books than you find in any
  public library; an almost haphazard accumulation of obsolete classics,
  contemporary successes, the Hundred Best Books (including Samuel Warren's Ten
  Thousand a Year), old school-books, directories, the Times Atlas, Ruskin in
  bulk, Tennyson complete in one volume, Longfellow, Charles Kingsley, Smiles,
  a guide-book or so, several medical pamphlets, odd magazine numbers, and much
  indescribable rubbish&mdash;in fact a compendium of the contemporary British
  mind. And in front of this array stood Kipps, ill-taught and untrained,
  respectful, awe-stricken, and, for the moment at any rate, willing to learn,
  while Coote, the exemplary Coote, talked to him of reading and the virtue in
  books.</p>

  <p>'Nothing enlarges the mind,' said Coote, 'like Travel and Books...And
  they're both so easy nowadays, and so cheap!'</p>

  <p>'I've often wanted to 'ave a good go in at reading,' Kipps replied.</p>

  <p>'You'd hardly believe,' Coote said, 'how much you can get out of books.
  Provided you avoid trashy reading, that is. You ought to make a rule, Kipps,
  and read one Serious Book a week. Of course we can Learn even from Novels,
  Nace Novels, that is, but it isn't the same thing as serious reading. I made
  a rule, One Serious Book and One Novel&mdash;no more. There's some of the
  Serious Books I've been reading lately&mdash;on that table: Sartor Resartus,
  Mrs. Twaddletome's Pond Life, The Scottish Chiefs, Life and Letters of Dean
  Farrar...'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">There came at last the sound of a gong, and Kipps descended
to tea in that
  state of nervous apprehension at the difficulties of eating and drinking that
  his aunt's knuckle rappings had implanted in him for ever. Over Coote's
  shoulder he became aware of a fourth person in the Moorish cosy corner, and
  he turned, leaving incomplete something incoherent he was saying to Miss
  Coote about his modest respect and desire for literature, to discover this
  fourth person was Miss Helen Walshingham, hatless, and looking very much at
  home.</p>

  <p>She rose at once with an extended hand to meet his hesitation. 'You're
  stopping in Folkestone, Mr. Kipps?'</p>

  <p>"Ere on a bit of business,' said Kipps. 'I thought you was away in
  Bruges.'</p>

  <p>'That's later,' said Miss Walshingham. 'We're stopping until my brother's
  holiday begins, and we're trying to let our house. Where are you staying in
  Folkestone?'</p>

  <p>'I got a 'ouse of mine&mdash;on the Leas.'</p>

  <p>'I've heard all about your good fortune&mdash;this afternoon.'</p>

  <p>'Isn't it a Go!' said Kipps. 'I 'aven't nearly got to believe it's reely
  'appened yet. When that Mr. Bean told me of it, you could 'ave knocked me
  down with a feather. It's a tremenjous change for me.'</p>

  <p>He discovered Miss Coote was asking him whether he took milk and sugar. 'I
  don't mind,' said Kipps. 'Jest as you like.'</p>

  <p>Coote became active, handing tea and bread-and-butter. It was thinly cut,
  and the bread was rather new, and the half of the slice that Kipps took fell
  upon the floor. He had been holding it by the edge, for he was not used to
  this migratory method of taking tea without plates or table. This little
  incident ruled him out of the conversation for a time, and when he came to
  attend to it again, they were talking about something or other
  prodigious&mdash;a performer of some sort&mdash;that was coming, called, it
  seemed, 'Padrooski!' So Kipps, who had dropped quietly into a chair, ate his
  bread-and-butter, said 'no, thank you' to any more, and by this discreet
  restraint got more freedom with his cup and saucer.</p>

  <p>Apart from the confusion natural to tea, he was in a state of tremulous
  excitement on account of the presence of Miss Walshingham. He glanced from
  Miss Coote to her brother, and then at Helen. He regarded her over the top of
  his cup as he drank. Here she was, solid and real. It was wonderful. He
  remarked, as he had done at times before, the easy flow of the dark hair back
  from her brow over her ears, the shapeliness of the white hands that came out
  from her simple white cuffs, the delicate pencilling of her brow.</p>

  <p>Presently she turned her face to him almost suddenly, and smiled with the
  easiest assurance of friendship. 'You will go, I suppose?' she said, and
  added 'to the Recital.'</p>

  <p>'If I'm in Folkestone I shall,' said Kipps, clearing away a little
  hoarseness. 'I don't know much about music, but what I do know I like.'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure you'll like Paderewski,' she said.</p>

  <p>'If you do,' he said, 'I dessay I shall.'</p>

  <p>He found Coote very kindly taking his cup.</p>

  <p>'Do you think of living in Folkestone?' asked Miss Coote in a tone of
  proprietorship from the hearthrug.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Kipps. 'That's jest it&mdash;I hardly know.' He also said that
  he wanted to look round a bit before doing anything. 'There's so much to
  consider,' said Coote, smoothing the back of his head.</p>

  <p>'I may go back to New Romney for a bit,' said Kipps. 'I got an uncle and
  aunt there. I reely don't know.' Helen regarded him thoughtfully for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>'You must come and see us,' she said, 'before we go to Bruges.'</p>

  <p>'Oo, rather!' said Kipps. 'If I may.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, do,' she said, and suddenly stood up before Kipps could formulate an
  inquiry when he should call.</p>

  <p>'You're sure you can spare that drawing-board?' she said to Miss Coote;
  and the conversation passed out of range.</p>

  <p>And when he had said 'Good-bye' to Miss Walshingham, and she had repeated
  her invitation to call, he went upstairs again with Coote to look out certain
  initiatory books they had had under discussion. And then Kipps, blowing very
  resolutely, went back to his own place, bearing in his arm (1) Sesame and
  Lilies; (2) Sir George Tressady; (3) an anonymous book on Vitality that Coote
  particularly esteemed. And having got to his own sitting-room, he opened
  Sesame and Lilies and read with ruthless determination for some time.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Presently he leant back and gave himself up to the business
of trying to
  imagine just exactly what Miss Walshingham could have thought of him when she
  saw him. Doubts about the precise effect of the gray flannel suit began to
  trouble him. He turned to the mirror over the mantel, and then got into a
  chair to study the hang of the trousers. It looked all right. Luckily she had
  not seen the Panama hat. He knew he had the brim turned up wrong, but he
  could not find out which way the brim was right. However, that she had not
  seen. He might, perhaps, ask at the shop where he bought it.</p>

  <p>He meditated for a while on his reflected face&mdash;doubtful whether he
  liked it or not&mdash;and then got down again and flitted across to the
  sideboard where there lay two little books, one in a cheap magnificent cover
  of red and gold, and the other in green canvas. The former was called, as its
  cover witnessed, Manners and Rules of Good Society, by a Member of the
  Aristocracy, and after the cover had indulged in a band of gilded decoration,
  light-hearted, but natural under the circumstances, it added, 'TWENTY-FIRST
  EDITION.' The second was that admirable classic, The Art of Conversing. Kipps
  returned with these to his seat, placed the two before him, opened the latter
  with a sigh, and flattened it under his hand.</p>

  <p>Then with knitted brows he began to read onward from a mark, his lips
  moving.</p>

  <p>'Having thus acquired possession of an idea, the little ship should not be
  abruptly launched into deep waters, but should be first permitted to glide
  gently and smoothly into the shallows; that is to say, the conversation
  should not be commenced by broadly and roundly stating a fact, or
  didactically expressing an opinion, as the subject would be thus virtually or
  summarily disposed of, or perhaps be met with a "Really" or "Indeed" or some
  equally brief monosyllabic reply. If an opposite opinion were held by the
  person to whom the remark were addressed, he might not, if a stranger, care
  to express it in the form of a direct contradiction or actual dissent. To
  glide imperceptibly into conversation is the object to be
  attained&mdash;'</p>

  <p>At this point Mr. Kipps rubbed his fingers through his hair with an
  expression of some perplexity, and went back to the beginning.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">When Kipps made his call on the Walshinghams, it all
happened so
  differently from the Manners and Rules prescription ('Paying Calls') that he
  was quite lost from the very outset. Instead of the footman or maidservant
  proper in these cases, Miss Walshingham opened the door to him herself. 'I'm
  so glad you've come,' she said, with one of her rare smiles.</p>

  <p>She stood aside for him to enter the rather narrow passage. 'I thought I'd
  call,' said he, retaining his hat and stick.</p>

  <p>She closed the door and led the way to a little drawing room, which
  impressed Kipps as being smaller and less emphatically coloured than that of
  the Cootes, and in which, at first, only a copper bowl of white poppies upon
  the brown tablecloth caught his particular attention.</p>

  <p>'You won't think it unconventional to come in, Mr. Kipps, will you?' she
  remarked. 'Mother is out.'</p>

  <p>'I don't mind,' he said, smiling amiably, 'if you don't.'</p>

  <p>She walked round the table and stood regarding him across it, with that
  same look between speculative curiosity and appreciation that he remembered
  from the last of the art-class meetings.</p>

  <p>'I wondered whether you would call or whether you wouldn't before you left
  Folkestone.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not leaving Folkestone for a bit, and any'ow I should have called on
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Mother will be sorry she was out. I've told her about you, and she wants,
  I know, to meet you.'</p>

  <p>'I saw 'er&mdash;if that was 'er&mdash;in the shop,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;you did, didn't you?...She has gone out to make some duty
  calls, and I didn't go. I had something to write. I write a little, you
  know.'</p>

  <p>'Reely,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'It's nothing much,' she said, 'and it comes to nothing.' She glanced at a
  little desk near the window, on which there lay some paper. 'One must do
  something.' She broke off abruptly. 'Have you seen our outlook?' she asked,
  and walked to the window, and Kipps came and stood beside her. 'We look on
  the Square. It might be worse, you know. That out-porter's truck there is
  horrid&mdash;and the railings, but it's better than staring one's social
  replica in the face, isn't it? It's pleasant in early spring&mdash;bright
  green laid on with a dry brush&mdash;and it's pleasant in autumn.'</p>

  <p>'I like it,' said Kipps. 'That laylock there is pretty, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Children come and pick it at times,' she remarked. 'I dessay they do,'
  said Kipps.</p>

  <p>He rested on his hat and stick and looked appreciatively out of the
  window, and she glanced at him for one swift moment. A suggestion that might
  have come from The Art of Conversing came into his head. 'Have you a garden?'
  he said.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders. 'Only a little one,' she said, and then,
  'Perhaps you would like to see it.'</p>

  <p>'I like gardening,' said Kipps, with memories of a penny worth of
  nasturtiums he had once trained over his uncle's dustbin.</p>

  <p>She led the way with a certain relief.</p>

  <p>They emerged through a four-seasons' coloured glass door to a little iron
  veranda, that led by iron steps to a minute walled garden. There was just
  room for a patch of turf and a flower-bed; one sturdy variegated Euonymus
  grew in the corner. But the early June flowers, the big narcissus, snow upon
  the mountains, and a fine show of yellow wallflowers, shone gay.</p>

  <p>'That's our garden,' said Helen. 'It's not a very big one, is it?'</p>

  <p>'I like it,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'It's small,' she said, 'but this is the day of small things.'</p>

  <p>Kipps didn't follow that.</p>

  <p>'If you were writing when I came,' he remarked, 'I'm interrupting
  you.'</p>

  <p>She turned round with her back to the railing and rested, leaning on her
  hands. 'I had finished,' she said. 'I couldn't get on.'</p>

  <p>'Were you making up something?' asked Kipps.</p>

  <p>There was a little interval before she smiled. 'I try&mdash;quite
  vainly&mdash;to write stories,' she said. 'One must do something. I don't
  know whether I shall ever do any good&mdash;at that&mdash;anyhow. It seems so
  hopeless. And, of course&mdash;one must study the popular taste. But now my
  brother has gone to London&mdash;I get a lot of leisure.'</p>

  <p>'I seen your brother, 'aven't I?'</p>

  <p>'He came to the class once or twice. Very probably you have. He's gone to
  London to pass his examinations and become a solicitor. And then I suppose
  he'll have a chance. Not much, perhaps, even then. But he's luckier than I
  am.'</p>

  <p>'You got your classes and things.'</p>

  <p>'They ought to satisfy me. But they don't. I suppose I'm ambitious. We
  both are. And we hadn't much of a spring board.' She glanced over her
  shoulder at the cramped little garden with an air of reference in her
  gesture.</p>

  <p>'I should think you could do anything if you wanted to?' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'As a matter of fact, I can't do anything I want to.'</p>

  <p>'You done a good deal.'</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'Well, didn't you pass one of these here University things?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I matriculated!'</p>

  <p>'I should think I was no end of a swell if I did&mdash;I know that.'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Kipps, do you know how many people matriculate into London University
  every year?'</p>

  <p>'How many, then?'</p>

  <p>'Between two and three thousand.'</p>

  <p>'Well, just think how many don't!'</p>

  <p>Her smile came again and broke into a laugh. 'Oh, they don't count,' she
  said; and then realising that might penetrate Kipps if he was left with it,
  she hurried on to, 'The fact is, I'm a discontented person, Mr. Kipps.
  Folkestone, you know, is a Sea Front, and it values people by sheer vulgar
  prosperity. We're not prosperous, and we live in a back street. We have to
  live here because this is our house. It's a mercy we haven't to 'let.' One
  feels one hasn't opportunities. If one had, I suppose one wouldn't use them.
  Still&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Kipps felt he was being taken tremendously into her confidence. 'That's
  jest it,' he said.</p>

  <p>He leant forward on his stick and said very earnestly, 'I believe you
  could do anything you wanted to, if you tried.'</p>

  <p>She threw out her hands in disavowal.</p>

  <p>'I know,' said he, very sagely, and nodding his head. 'I watched you once
  or twice when you were teaching that woodcarving class.'</p>

  <p>For some reason this made her laugh&mdash;a rather pleasant laugh, and
  that made Kipps feel a very witty and successful person. 'It's very evident,'
  she said, 'that you're one of those rare people who believe in me, Mr.
  Kipps,' to which he answered, 'Oo, I do!' and then suddenly they became aware
  of Mrs. Walshingham coming along the passage. In another moment she appeared
  through the four-seasons' door, bonneted and ladylike, and a little faded,
  exactly as Kipps had seen her in the shop. Kipps felt a certain apprehension
  at her appearance, in spite of the reassurances he had had from Coote.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Kipps has called on us,' said Helen; and Mrs. Walshingham said it was
  very, very kind of him, and added that new people didn't call on them very
  much nowadays. There was nothing of the scandalised surprise Kipps had seen
  in the shop; she had heard, perhaps, he was a gentleman now. In the shop he
  had thought her rather jaded and haughty, but he had scarcely taken her hand,
  which responded to his touch with a friendly pressure, before he knew how
  mistaken he had been. She then told her daughter that someone called Mrs.
  Wace had been out, and turned to Kipps again to ask him if he had had tea.
  Kipps said he had not, and Helen moved towards some mysterious interior.
  'But, I say,' said Kipps, 'don't you on my account&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Helen vanished, and he found himself alone with Mrs. Walshingham. Which,
  of course, made him breathless and Boreas-looking for a moment.</p>

  <p>'You were one of Helen's pupils in the wood-carving class?' asked Mrs.
  Walshingham, regarding him with the quiet watchfulness proper to her
  position.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Kipps; 'that's 'ow I 'ad the pleasure&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'She took a great interest in her woodcarving class. She is so energetic,
  you know, and it gives her an Outlet.'</p>

  <p>'I thought she taught something splendid.'</p>

  <p>'Every one says she did very well. Helen, I think, would do anything well
  that she undertook to do. She's so very clever. And she throws herself into
  things so.'</p>

  <p>She untied her bonnet-strings with a pleasant informality.</p>

  <p>'She had told me all about her class. She used to be full of it. And about
  your cut hand.'</p>

  <p>'Lor!' said Kipps; 'fancy telling that!'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. And how brave you were!'</p>

  <p>(Though, indeed, Helen's chief detail had been his remarkable expedient
  for checking bloodshed.) Kipps became bright pink. 'She said you didn't seem
  to feel it a bit.'</p>

  <p>Kipps felt he would have to spend weeks over The Art of Conversing.</p>

  <p>While he still hung fire, Helen returned with the apparatus for afternoon
  tea upon a tray. 'Do you mind pulling out the table?' asked Mrs.
  Walshingham.</p>

  <p>That again was very homelike. Kipps put down his hat and stick in the
  corner, and amidst an iron thunder pulled out a little rusty, green-painted,
  iron table, and then in the easiest manner followed Helen in to get
  chairs.</p>

  <p>So soon as he had got rid of his teacup&mdash;he refused all food, of
  course, and they were merciful&mdash;he became wonderfully at his ease.
  Presently he was talking. He talked quite modestly and simply about his
  changed condition, and his difficulties and plans. He spread what indeed had
  an air of being all his simple little soul before their eyes. In a little
  while his clipped, defective accent had become less perceptible to their
  ears, and they began to realise, as the girl with the freckles had long since
  realised, that there were passable aspects of Kipps. He confided, he
  submitted, and for both of them he had the realest, the most seductively
  flattering undertone of awe and reverence.</p>

  <p>He remained about two hours, having forgotten how terribly incorrect it is
  to stay at such a length. They did not mind at all.</p>

  <h2>
<a id="chap23"
     name="chap23"></a>III. &mdash; ENGAGED</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Within two months, within a matter of three-and-fifty days,
Kipps had
  clambered to the battlements of Heart's Desire.</p>

  <p>It all became possible by the Walshinghams&mdash;it would seem at Coote's
  instigation&mdash;deciding, after all, not to spend the holidays at Bruges.
  Instead they remained in Folkestone, and this happy chance gave Kipps just
  all those opportunities of which he stood in need.</p>

  <p>His crowning day was at Lympne, and long before the summer warmth began to
  break, while, indeed, August still flamed on high. They had
  organised&mdash;no one seemed to know who suggested it first&mdash;a water
  party on the still reaches of the old military canal at Hythe, and they were
  to picnic by the brick bridge, and afterwards to clamber to Lympne Castle.
  The host of the gathering, it was understood very clearly, was Kipps.</p>

  <p>They went a merry party. The canal was weedy, with only a few inches of
  water at the shallows, and so they went in three canoes. Kipps had learnt to
  paddle; it had been his first athletic accomplishment; and his
  second&mdash;with the last three or four of ten private lessons still to
  come&mdash;was to be cycling. But Kipps did not paddle at all badly; muscles
  hardened by lifting pieces of cretonne could cut a respectable figure by the
  side of Coote's exertions, and the girl with the freckles, the girl who
  understood him, came in his canoe. They raced the Walshinghams, brother and
  sister; and Coote, in a liquefying state and blowing mightily, but still
  persistent, and always quite polite and considerate, toiled behind with Mrs.
  Walshingham. She could not be expected to paddle (though, of course, she
  'offered'), and she reclined upon specially adjusted cushions under a
  black-and-white sunshade, and watched Kipps and her daughter, and feared at
  intervals that Coote was getting hot.</p>

  <p>They were all more or less in holiday costume; the eyes of the girls
  looked out under the shade of wide-brimmed hats; even the freckled girl was
  unexpectedly pretty, and Helen, swinging sunlight to her paddle, gave Kipps,
  almost for the first time, the suggestion of a graceful body. Kipps was
  arrayed in the completest boating costume, and when his fashionable Panama
  was discarded and his hair blown into disorder, he became, in his white
  flannels, as sightly as most young men. His complexion was a notable
  asset.</p>

  <p>Things favoured him, the day favoured him, every one favoured him. Young
  Walshingham, the girl with the freckles, Coote, and Mrs. Walshingham, were
  playing up to him in the most benevolent way, and between the landing-place
  and Lympne, Fortune, to crown their efforts, had placed a small convenient
  field entirely at the disposal of an adolescent bull. Not a big, real,
  resolute bull but, on the other hand, no calf; a young bull, at the same
  stage of emotional development as Kipps, 'where the brook and river meet.'
  Detachedly our party drifted towards him.</p>

  <p>When they landed, young Walshingham, with the simple directness of a
  brother, abandoned his sister to Kipps and secured the freckled girl, leaving
  Coote to carry Mrs. Walshingham's light wool wrap. He started at once in
  order to put an effectual distance between himself and his companion on the
  one hand, and a certain pervasive chaperonage that went with Coote, on the
  other. Young Walshingham, I think I have said, was dark, with a Napoleonic
  profile, and it was natural for him therefore to be a bold thinker and an
  epigrammatic speaker, and he had long ago discovered great possibilities of
  appreciation in the freckled girl. He was in a very happy frame that day
  because he had just been entrusted with the management of Kipps' affairs (old
  Bean inexplicably dismissed), and that was not a bad beginning for a
  solicitor of only a few months' standing; and, moreover, he had been reading
  Nietzsche, and he thought that in all probability he was the Non-Moral
  Overman referred to by that writer. He wore fairly large-sized hats. He
  wanted to expand the theme of the Non-Moral Overman in the ear of the
  freckled girl, to say it over, so to speak, and in order to seclude his
  exposition they went aside from the direct path and trespassed through a
  coppice, avoiding the youthful bull. They escaped to these higher themes but
  narrowly, for Coote and Mrs. Walshingham, subtle chaperones both, and each
  indisposed, for excellent reasons, to encumber Kipps and Helen, were hot upon
  their heels. These two kept the direct route to the stile of the bull's
  field, and the sight of the animal at once awakened Coote's innate aversion
  to brutality in any shape or form. He said the stiles were too high, and that
  they could do better by going round by the hedge, and Mrs. Walshingham,
  nothing loath, agreed.</p>

  <p>This left the way clear for Kipps and Helen, and they encountered the
  bull. Helen did not observe the bull; Kipps did; but that afternoon, at any
  rate, he was equal to facing a lion. And the bull really came at them. It was
  not an affair of the bull-ring exactly, no desperate rushes and gorings, but
  he came; he regarded them with a large, wicked, bluish eye, opened a mouth
  below his moistly glistening nose, and booed, at any rate, if he did not
  exactly bellow, and he shook his head wickedly, and showed that tossing was
  in his mind. Helen was frightened, without any loss of dignity, and Kipps
  went extremely white. But he was perfectly calm, and he seemed to her to have
  lost the last vestiges of his accent and his social shakiness. He directed
  her to walk quietly towards the stile, and made an oblique advance towards
  the bull.</p>

  <p>'You be orf!' he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>When Helen was well over the stile, Kipps withdrew in good order. He got
  over the stile, under cover of a feint, and the thing was done&mdash;a small
  thing, no doubt, but just enough to remove from Helen's mind an incorrect
  deduction that a man who was so terribly afraid of a teacup as Kipps must
  necessarily be abjectly afraid of everything else in the world. In her moment
  of reaction she went, perhaps too far in the opposite direction. Hitherto
  Kipps had always had a certain flimsiness of effect for her. Now, suddenly,
  he was discovered solid. He was discovered possible in many new ways. Here,
  after all, was the sort of back a woman can get behind!...</p>

  <p>As they went past the turf-crowned mass of Portus Lemanus, up the steep
  slopes towards the castle on the crest, the thing was almost manifest in her
  eyes.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Every one who stays in Folkestone goes sooner or later to
Lympne. The
  Castle became a farm-house, and the farm-house, itself now ripe and
  venerable, wears the walls of the castle as a little man wears a big man's
  coat. The kindliest of farm ladies entertains a perpetual stream of visitors,
  and shows you her vast mangle and her big kitchen, and takes you out upon the
  sunniest little terrace-garden in all the world, and you look down the
  sheep-dotted slopes, to where, beside the canal and under the trees, the
  crumbled memories of Rome sleep for ever. One climbs the Keep, up a tortuous
  spiral of stone, worn to the pitch of perforation, and there one is lifted to
  the centre of far more than a hemisphere of view. Away below one's feet,
  almost at the bottom of the hill, the Marsh begins and spreads and spreads in
  a mighty crescent that sweeps about the sea, the Marsh dotted with the church
  towers of forgotten mediaeval towns, and breaking at last into the low blue
  hills by Winchelsea and Hastings; east hangs France between the sea and sky;
  and round the north, bounding the wide perspectives of farms and houses and
  woods, the Downs, with their hangers and chalk-pits, sustain the passing
  shadows of the sailing clouds.</p>

  <p>And here it was, high out of the world of every day, and in the presence
  of spacious beauty, that Kipps and Helen found themselves agreeably alone.
  All six, it had seemed, had been coming for the Keep; but Mrs. Walshingham
  had hesitated at the horrid little stairs, and then suddenly felt faint, and
  so she and the freckled girl had remained below, walking up and down in the
  shadow of the house; and Coote had remembered they were all out of
  cigarettes, and had taken off young Walshingham into the village. There had
  been shouting to explain between ground and parapet, and then Helen and Kipps
  turned again to the view and commended it, and fell silent.</p>

  <p>Helen sat fearlessly in an embrasure, and Kipps stood beside her.</p>

  <p>'I've always been fond, of scenery,' Kipps repeated, after an interval.
  Then he went off at a tangent. 'D'you reely think that was right what Coote
  was saying?'</p>

  <p>She looked interrogation.</p>

  <p>'About my name.'</p>

  <p>'Being really C-U-Y-P-S? I have my doubts. I thought at first&mdash;What
  makes Mr. Coote add an 'S' to Cuyp?'</p>

  <p>'I dunno,' said Kipps, foiled. I was jest thinking'...</p>

  <p>She shot one wary glance at him, and then turned her eyes to the sea.</p>

  <p>Kipps was out for a space. He had intended to lead from this question to
  the general question of surnames and change of names; it had seemed a light
  and witty way of saying something he had in mind, and suddenly he perceived
  that this was an unutterably vulgar and silly project. The hitch about that
  'S' had saved him. He regarded her profile for a moment, framed in
  weatherbeaten stone, and backed by the blue elements.</p>

  <p>He dropped the question of his name out of existence, and spoke again of
  the view. 'When I see scenery&mdash;and things that&mdash;that are beautiful,
  it makes me feel&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She looked at him suddenly, and saw him fumbling for his words. 'Silly
  like,' he said.</p>

  <p>She took him in with her glance, the old look of proprietorship it was,
  touched with a certain warmth. She spoke in a voice as unambiguous as her
  eyes. 'You needn't,' she said. 'You know, Mr. Kipps, you hold yourself too
  cheap.'</p>

  <p>Her eyes and words smote him with amazement. He stared at her like a man
  who awakens. She looked down. 'You mean&mdash;' he said; and then, 'Don't you
  hold me cheap?' She glanced up again and shook her head.</p>

  <p>'But&mdash;for instance&mdash;you don't think of me&mdash;as an equal
  like.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?'</p>

  <p>'Oo! But, reely&mdash;'</p>

  <p>His heart beat very fast.</p>

  <p>'If I thought&mdash;' he said; and then, 'You know so much.'</p>

  <p>'That's nothing,' she said.</p>

  <p>Then for a long time, as it seemed to them, both kept silence&mdash;a
  silence that said and accomplished many things.</p>

  <p>'I know what I am,' he said at length...'If I thought it was possible...If
  I thought you....I believe I could do anything&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He stopped, and she sat downcast and strikingly still.</p>

  <p>'Miss Walshingham,' he said, 'is it possible that you...could care for me
  enough to&mdash;to 'elp me? Miss Walshingham, do you care for me at all?'</p>

  <p>It seemed she was never going to answer. She looked up at him. 'I think,'
  she said, 'you are the most generous&mdash;look at what you have done for my
  brother!&mdash;the most generous and the most modest of&mdash;men. And this
  afternoon&mdash;I thought you were the bravest.'</p>

  <p>She turned her head, glanced down, waved her hand to some one on the
  terrace below, and stood up. 'Mother is signalling,' she said. 'We must go
  down.'</p>

  <p>Kipps became polite and deferential by habit, but his mind was a tumult
  that had nothing to do with that.</p>

  <p>He moved before her towards the little door that opened on the winding
  stairs&mdash;'always precede a lady down or up stairs'&mdash;and then, on the
  second step, he turned resolutely 'But&mdash;' he said, looking up out of the
  shadow, flannel clad and singularly like a man.</p>

  <p>She looked down on him, with her hand upon the stone lintel.</p>

  <p>He held out his hand as if to help her. 'Can you tell me?' he said. 'You
  must know&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'If you care for me?'</p>

  <p>She did not answer for a long time. It was as if every thing in the world
  was drawn to the breaking-point, and in a minute must certainly break.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she said at last. 'I know.'</p>

  <p>Abruptly, by some impalpable sign, he knew what the answer would be, and
  he remained still. She bent down over him and softened to her wonderful
  smile.</p>

  <p>'Promise me,' she insisted.</p>

  <p>He promised with his still face.</p>

  <p>'If I do not hold you cheap, you will never hold yourself cheap.'</p>

  <p>'If you do not hold me cheap! You mean?'</p>

  <p>She bent down quite close to him. 'I hold you,' she said, and then
  whispered, 'dear.'</p>

  <p>'Me?'</p>

  <p>She laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>He was astonished beyond measure. He stipulated lest there might yet be
  some misconception. 'You will marry me?'</p>

  <p>She was laughing, inundated by the sense of bountiful power, of possession
  and success. He looked quite a nice little man to have. 'Yes,' she laughed.
  'What else could I mean?' and, 'Yes.'</p>

  <p>He felt as a praying hermit might have felt, snatched from the midst of
  his quiet devotions, his modest sackcloth and ashes, and hurled neck and crop
  over the glittering gates of Paradise, smack among the iridescent wings, the
  bright-eyed Cherubim. He felt like some lowly and righteous man dynamited
  into Bliss...</p>

  <p>His hand tightened on the rope that steadies one upon the stairs of stone.
  He was for kissing her hand and did not.</p>

  <p>He said not a word more. He turned about, and, with something very like a
  scared expression on his face, led the way into the obscurity of their
  descent...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Every one seemed to understand. Nothing was said, nothing
was explained;
  the merest touch of the eyes sufficed. As they clustered in the castle
  gateway, Coote, Kipps remembered afterwards, laid hold of his arm as if by
  chance, and pressed it. It was quite evident he knew. His eyes, his nose,
  shone with benevolent congratulation; shone, too, with the sense of a good
  thing conducted to its climax. Mrs. Walshingham, who had seemed a little
  fatigued by the hill, recovered, and was even obviously stirred by affection
  for her daughter. There was in passing a motherly caress. She asked Kipps to
  give her his arm in walking down the steep. Kipps in a sort of dream obeyed.
  He found himself trying to attend to her, and soon he was attending.</p>

  <p>She and Kipps talked like sober, responsible people and went slowly, while
  the others drifted down the hill together, a loose little group of four. He
  wondered momentarily what they would talk about, and then sank into his
  conversation with Mrs. Walshingham. He conversed, as it were, out of his
  superficial personality, and his inner self lay stunned in unsuspected depths
  within. It had an air of being an interesting and friendly talk, almost their
  first long talk together. Hitherto he had had a sort of fear of Mrs.
  Walshingham, as of a person possibly satirical, but she proved a soul of
  sense and sentiment, and Kipps, for all his abstraction, got on with her
  unexpectedly well. They talked a little upon scenery and the inevitable
  melancholy attaching to old ruins and the thought of vanished
  generations.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps they jousted here,' said Mrs. Walshingham.</p>

  <p>'They was up to all sorts of things,' said Kipps; and then the two came
  round to Helen. She spoke of her daughter's literary ambitions. 'She will do
  something, I feel sure. You know, Mr. Kipps, it's a great responsibility to a
  mother to feel her daughter is&mdash;exceptionally clever.'</p>

  <p>'I dessay it is,' said Kipps. 'There's no mistake about that.'</p>

  <p>She spoke, too, of her son&mdash;almost like Helen's twin&mdash;alike yet
  different. She made Kipps feel quite fatherly.</p>

  <p>'They are so quick, so artistic,' she said, 'so full of ideas. Almost they
  frighten me. One feels they need opportunities&mdash;as other people need
  air.'</p>

  <p>She spoke of Helen's writing. 'Even when she was quite a little tot she
  wrote verse.'</p>

  <p>(Kipps, sensation.)</p>

  <p>'Her father had just the same tastes&mdash;' Mrs. Walshingham turned a
  little beam of half-pathetic reminiscence on the past. 'He was more artist
  than business man. That was the trouble...He was misled by his partner, and
  when the crash came every one blamed him...Well, it doesn't do to dwell on
  horrid things...especially to-day. There are bright days, Mr. Kipps, and dark
  days. And mine have not always been bright.'</p>

  <p>Kipps presented a face of Coote-like sympathy.</p>

  <p>She diverged to talk of flowers, and Kipps' mind was filled with the
  picture of Helen bending down towards him in the Keep...</p>

  <p>They spread the tea under the trees before the little inn, and at a
  certain moment Kipps became aware that every one in the party was
  simultaneously and furtively glancing at him. There might have been a certain
  tension had it not been first of all for Coote and his tact, and afterwards
  for a number of wasps. Coote was resolved to make this memorable day pass off
  well, and displayed an almost boisterous sense of fun. Then young Walshingham
  began talking of the Roman remains below Lympne, intending to lead up to the
  Overman. 'These old Roman chaps&mdash;' he said; and then the wasps arrived.
  They killed three in the jam alone.</p>

  <p>Kipps killed wasps, as it were in a dream, and handed things to the wrong
  people, and maintained a thin surface of ordinary intelligence with the
  utmost difficulty. At times he became aware&mdash;aware with an extraordinary
  vividness&mdash;of Helen. Helen was carefully not looking at him, and
  behaving with amazing coolness and ease. But just for that one time there was
  the faintest suggestion of pink beneath the ivory of her cheeks...</p>

  <p>Tacitly the others conceded to Kipps the right to paddle back with Helen;
  he helped her into the canoe and took his paddle and, paddling slowly,
  dropped behind the others. And now his inner self stirred again. He said
  nothing to her. How could he ever say anything to her again? She spoke to him
  at rare intervals about reflections and flowers and the trees, and he nodded
  in reply. But his mind moved very slowly forward now from the point at which
  it had fallen stunned in the Lympne Keep, moving forward to the beginnings of
  realisation. As yet he did not say even in the recesses of his heart that she
  was his! But he perceived that the goddess had come from her altar,
  amazingly, and had taken him by the hand!</p>

  <p>The sky was a vast splendour, and then close to them were the dark
  protecting trees, and the shining, smooth still water.</p>

  <p>He was an erect black outline to her; he plied his paddle with no
  unskilful gesture; the water broke to snaky silver and glittered far behind
  his strokes. Indeed, he did not seem so bad to her. Youth calls to youth the
  wide world through, and her soul rose in triumph over his subjection. And
  behind him was money and opportunity, freedom, and London, a great background
  of seductively indistinct hopes. To him her face was a warm dimness. In truth
  he could not see her eyes, but it seemed to his love-witched brain he did,
  and that they shone out at him like dusky stars.</p>

  <p>All the world that evening was no more than a shadowy frame of darkling
  sky and water and dipping boughs about Helen. He seemed to see through things
  with an extraordinary clearness; she was revealed to him certainly as the
  cause and essence of it all.</p>

  <p>He was, indeed, at his Heart's Desire. It was one of those times when
  there seems to be no future, when Time has stopped and we are at the end.
  Kipps that evening could not have imagined a to-morrow; all that his
  imagination had pointed towards was attained. His mind stood still, and took
  the moments as they came.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">About nine that night Coote came round to Kipps' new
apartment in the
  Upper Sandgate Road&mdash;the house on the Leas had been let furnished and
  Kipps made an effort towards realisation. He was discovered sitting at the
  open window and without a lamp&mdash;quite still. Coote was deeply moved, and
  he pressed Kipps' palm and laid a knobby white hand on his shoulder, and
  displayed the sort of tenderness becoming in a crisis. Kipps, too, was moved
  that night and treated Coote like a very dear brother.</p>

  <p>'She's splendid,' said Coote, coming to it abruptly.</p>

  <p>'Isn't she?' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'I couldn't help noticing her face,' said Coote...'You know, my dear
  Kipps, this is better than a legacy.'</p>

  <p>'I don't deserve it,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'You can't say that.'</p>

  <p>'I don't. I can't 'ardly believe it. I can't believe it at all. No!'</p>

  <p>There followed an expressive stillness.</p>

  <p>'It's wonderful,' said Kipps. 'It takes me like that.'</p>

  <p>Coote made a faint blowing noise, and so again they came for a time on
  silence.</p>

  <p>'And it began&mdash;before your money?'</p>

  <p>'When I was in 'er class,' said Kipps solemnly.</p>

  <p>Coote speaking out of a darkness which he was illuminating strangely with
  efforts to strike a match, said it was beautiful. He could not have wished
  Kipps a better fortune.</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette, and Kipps was moved to the same, with a sacramental
  expression. Presently speech flowed more freely.</p>

  <p>Coote began to praise Helen, and her mother and brother; he talked of when
  'it' might be; he presented the thing as concrete and credible. 'It's a
  county family, you know,' he said. 'She is connected, you know, with the
  Beaupr&Uacute;s family&mdash;you know Lord Beaupr&Uacute;s.'</p>

  <p>'No!' said Kipps, 'reely!'</p>

  <p>'Distantly, of course,' said Coote. 'Still&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He smiled a smile that glimmered in the twilight.</p>

  <p>'It's too much,' said Kipps, overcome. 'It's so all like that.'</p>

  <p>Coote exhaled. For a time Kipps listened to Helen's praises and matured a
  point of view.</p>

  <p>'I say, Coote,' he said. 'What ought I to do now?'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?' said Coote.</p>

  <p>'I mean about calling on 'er and all that.'</p>

  <p>He reflected. 'Naturally I want to do it all right.'</p>

  <p>'Of course,' said Coote.</p>

  <p>'It would be awful to go and do something now&mdash;all wrong.'</p>

  <p>Coote's cigarette glowed as he meditated. 'You must call, of course,' he
  decided. 'You'll have to speak to Mrs. Walshingham.'</p>

  <p>"Ow?' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Tell her you mean to marry her daughter.'</p>

  <p>'I dessay she knows,' said Kipps, with defensive penetration.</p>

  <p>Coote's head was visible, shaking itself judicially.</p>

  <p>'Then there's the ring,' said Kipps. 'What 'ave I to do about that?'</p>

  <p>'What ring do you mean?'</p>

  <p>"Ngagement Ring. There isn't anything at all about that in Manners and
  Rules of Good Society&mdash;not a word.'</p>

  <p>'Of course you must get something&mdash;tasteful. Yes.'</p>

  <p>'What sort of ring?'</p>

  <p>'Something nace. They'll show you in the shop.'</p>

  <p>'O' course. I s'pose I got to take it to 'er, eh? Put it on 'er
  finger.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no! Send it. Much better.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' said Kipps for the first time with a note of relief.</p>

  <p>'Then 'ow about this call?&mdash;on Mrs. Walshingham, I mean. 'Ow ought
  one to go?'</p>

  <p>'Rather a ceremonial occasion,' reflected Coote. 'Wadyer mean? Frock
  coat?'</p>

  <p>'I think so,' said Coote, with discrimination. 'Light trousers, and all
  that?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Rose?'</p>

  <p>'I think it might run to a buttonhole.'</p>

  <p>The curtain that hung over the future became less opaque to the eyes of
  Kipps. To-morrow, and then other days, became perceptible at least as
  existing. Frock coat, silk hat, and a rose! With a certain solemnity he
  contemplated himself in the process of slow 'transformation into an English
  gentleman.' Arthur Cuyps, frock-coated on occasions of ceremony, the familiar
  acquaintance of Lady Punnet, the recognised wooer of a distant connection of
  the Earl of Beaupr&Uacute;s.</p>

  <p>Something like awe at the magnitude of his own fortunes came upon him. He
  felt the world was opening out like a magic flower in a transformation scene
  at the touch of this wand of gold. And Helen, nestling beautiful in the red
  heart of the flower. Only ten weeks ago he had been no more than the
  shabbiest of improvers and shamefully dismissed for dissipation, the mere
  soil-buried seed, as it were, of these glories. He resolved the engagement
  ring should be of impressively excessive quality and appearance, in fact the
  very best they had.</p>

  <p>'Ought I to send 'er flowers?' he speculated.</p>

  <p>'Not necessarily,' said Coote. 'Though, of course, it's an
  attention'...</p>

  <p>Kipps meditated on flowers.</p>

  <p>'When you see her,' said Coote, 'you'll have to ask her to name the
  day.'</p>

  <p>Kipps started. 'That won't be just yet a bit, will it?'</p>

  <p>'Don't know any reason for delay.'</p>

  <p>'Oo, but&mdash;a year say.'</p>

  <p>'Rather a long taime,' said Coote.</p>

  <p>'Is it?' said Kipps, turning his head sharply. 'But&mdash;'</p>

  <p>There was quite a long pause.</p>

  <p>'I say!' he said at last, and in an altered voice, 'you'll 'ave to 'elp me
  about the wedding.'</p>

  <p>'Only too happy!' said Coote.</p>

  <p>'O' course,' said Kipps. 'I didn't think&mdash;' He changed his line of
  thought. 'Coote,' he asked, 'wot's a 'tate-eh-tate'?'</p>

  <p>'A 'tate-ah-tay,'</p>

  <p>' said Coote improvingly, 'is a conversation alone together.'</p>

  <p>'Lor!' said Kipps, 'but I thought&mdash;It says strictly we oughtn't to
  enjoy a tater-tay, not sit together, walk together, or meet during any part
  of the day. That don't leave much time for meeting, does it?'</p>

  <p>'The book says that?' asked Coote.</p>

  <p>'I jest learn it by 'eart before you came. I thought that was a bit rum,
  but I 'spose it's all right.'</p>

  <p>'You won't find Mrs. Walshingham so strict as all that,' said Coote. 'I
  think that's a bit extreme. They'd only do that now in very strict old
  aristocratic families. Besides, the Walshinghams are so modern&mdash;advanced
  you might say. I expect you'll get plenty of chances of talking
  together.'</p>

  <p>'There's a tremendous lot to think about,' said Kipps, blowing a profound
  sigh. 'D'you mean&mdash;p'raps we might be married in a few months or
  so?'</p>

  <p>'You'll have to be,' said Coote. 'Why not?'...</p>

  <p>Midnight found Kipps alone, looking a little tired, and turning over the
  leaves of the red-covered text-book with a studious expression. He paused for
  a moment at page 233, his eye caught by the words:</p>

  <p>'FOR AN UNCLE OR AUNT BY MARRIAGE the period is six weeks black with jet
  trimmings.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Kipps, after a vigorous mental effort. That's not it.' The
  pages rustled again. He stopped and flattened out the little book decisively
  at the beginning of the chapter on 'Weddings.'</p>

  <p>He became pensive. He stared at the lamp-wick. 'I suppose I ought to go
  over and tell them,' he said at last.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Kipps called on Mrs. Walshingham attired in the proper
costume for
  Ceremonial Occasions in the Day. He carried a silk hat, and he wore a deep-
  skirted frock-coat; his boots were patent leather, and his trousers a dark
  gray. He had generous white cuffs with gold links, and his gray gloves, one
  thumb of which had burst when he put them on, he held loosely in his hand. He
  carried a small umbrella, rolled to an exquisite tightness. A sense of
  singular correctness pervaded his being and warred with the enormity of the
  occasion for possession of his soul. Anon he touched his silk cravat. The
  world smelt of his rosebud.</p>

  <p>He seated himself on a newly re-covered chintz armchair, and stuck out the
  elbow of the arm that held his hat.</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Mrs. Walshingham, 'I know everything,' and helped him out
  most amazingly. She deepened the impression he had already received of her
  sense and refinement. She displayed an amount of tenderness that touched
  him.</p>

  <p>'This is a great thing,' she said, 'to a mother,' and her hand rested for
  a moment on his impeccable coat-sleeve. 'A daughter, Arthur,' she exclaimed,
  'is so much more than a son.'</p>

  <p>Marriage, she said, was a lottery, and without love and
  toleration&mdash;there was much unhappiness. Her life had not always been
  bright&mdash;there had been dark days and bright days. She smiled rather
  sweetly. 'This is a bright one,' she said.</p>

  <p>She said very kind and flattering things to Kipps, and she thanked him for
  his goodness to her son. ('That wasn't anything,' said Kipps.) And then she
  expanded upon the theme of her two children. 'Both so accomplished,' she
  said, 'so clever. I call them my Twin Jewels.'</p>

  <p>She was repeating a remark she had made at Lympne that she always said her
  children needed opportunities as other people needed air, when she was
  abruptly arrested by the entry of Helen. They hung on a pause, Helen perhaps
  surprised by Kipps' week-day magnificence. Then she advanced with
  outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>Both the young people were shy. 'I jest called round,' began Kipps, and
  became uncertain how to end.</p>

</div>

  <p>'Won't you have some tea?' asked Helen.</p>

  <p>She walked to the window, looked at the familiar outporter's barrow,
  turned, surveyed Kipps for a moment ambiguously, said, 'I will get some tea,'
  and so departed again.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Walshingham and Kipps looked at one another, and the lady smiled
  indulgently. 'You two young people mustn't be shy of each other,' said Mrs.
  Walshingham, which damaged Kipps considerably.</p>

  <p>She was explaining how sensitive Helen always had been, even about quite
  little things, when the servant appeared with the tea-things; and then Helen
  followed, and, taking up a secure position behind the little bamboo
  tea-table, broke the ice with officious teacup clattering. Then she
  introduced the topic of a forth-coming open-air performance of As You Like
  It, and steered past the worst of the awkwardness. They discussed stage
  illusion. 'I mus' say,' said Kipps, 'I don't quite like a play in a theayter.
  It seems sort of unreal some'ow.'</p>

  <p>'But most plays are written for the stage,' said Helen, looking at the
  sugar. 'I know,' admitted Kipps.</p>

  <p>They got through tea. 'Well,' said Kipps, and rose.</p>

  <p>'You mustn't go yet,' said Mrs. Walshingham, rising and taking his hand.
  'I'm sure you two must have heaps to say to each other'; and so she escaped
  towards the door.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Among other projects that seemed almost equally correct to
Kipps at that
  exalted moment was one of embracing Helen with ardour so soon as the door
  closed behind her mother, and one of headlong flight through the open window.
  Then he remembered he ought to hold the door open for Mrs. Walshingham, and
  turned from that duty to find Helen still standing, beautifully inaccessible,
  behind the tea-things. He closed the door and advanced towards her with his
  arms akimbo and his hands upon his coat skirts. Then feeling angular, he
  moved his right hand to his moustache. Anyhow, he was dressed all right.
  Somewhere at the back of his mind, dim and mingled with doubt and surprise,
  appeared the perception that he felt now quite differently towards her, that
  something between them had been blown from Lympne Keep to the four winds of
  heaven&mdash;</p>

  <p>She regarded him with an eye of critical proprietorship. 'Mother has been
  making up to you,' she said, smiling slightly. She added, 'It was nice of you
  to come round to see her.'</p>

  <p>They stood through a brief pause, as though each had expected something
  different in the other, and was a little perplexed at its not being there.
  Kipps found he was at the corner of the brown-covered table, and he picked up
  a little flexible book that lay upon it to occupy his mind.</p>

  <p>'I bought you a ring to-day,' he said, bending the book and speaking for
  the sake of saying something, and then he moved to genuine speech. 'You
  know,' he said, 'I can't 'ardly believe it.'</p>

  <p>Her face relaxed slightly again. 'No?' she said, and may have breathed,
  'Nor I.'</p>

  <p>'No,' he went on. 'It's as though everything 'ad changed. More even than
  when I got that money. 'Ere we are going to marry. It's like being someone
  else. What I feel is&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He turned a flushed and earnest face to her. He seemed to come alive to
  her with one natural gesture. 'I don't know things. I'm not good enough. I'm
  not refined. The more you see of me, the more you'll find me out.'</p>

  <p>'But I'm going to help you.'</p>

  <p>'You'll 'ave to 'elp me a fearful lot.'</p>

  <p>She walked to the window, glanced out of it, made up her mind, turned and
  came towards him, with her hands clasped behind her back.</p>

  <p>'All these things that trouble you are very little things. If you don't
  mind&mdash;if you will let me tell you things&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I wish you would.'</p>

  <p>'Then I will.'</p>

  <p>They're little things to you, but they aren't to me.'</p>

  <p>'It all depends, if you don't mind being told.'</p>

  <p>'By you?'</p>

  <p>'I don't expect you to be told by strangers.'</p>

  <p>'Oo!' said Kipps, expressing much.</p>

  <p>'You know, there are just a few little things&mdash;For instance, you
  know, you are careless with your pronunciation...You don't mind my telling
  you?'</p>

  <p>'I like it,' said Kipps. 'There aitches.'</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Kipps, and then endorsingly, 'I been told. Fact is, I know
  a chap, a Nacter, he's told me. He's told me, and he's going to give me a
  lesson or so.'</p>

  <p>'I'm glad of that. It only requires a little care.'</p>

  <p>'Of course, on the stage they got to look out. They take regular
  lessons.'</p>

  <p>'Of course,' said Helen, a little absently.</p>

  <p>'I dessay I shall soon get into it,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'And then there's dress,' said Helen, taking up her thread again. Kipps
  became pink, but he remained respectfully attentive.</p>

  <p>'You don't mind?' she said.</p>

  <p>'Oo no.'</p>

  <p>'You mustn't be too&mdash;too dressy. It's possible to be over
  conventional, over elaborate. It makes you look like a shop...like a common
  well-off person. There's a sort of easiness that is better. A real gentleman
  looks right, without looking as though he had tried to be right.'</p>

  <p>'Jest as though 'e'd put on what came first?' said the pupil in a faded
  voice. 'Not exactly that, but a sort of ease.'</p>

  <p>Kipps nodded his head intelligently. In his heart he was kicking his silk
  hat about the room in an ecstasy of disappointment.</p>

  <p>'And you must accustom yourself to be more at your ease when you are with
  people,' said Helen. 'You've only got to forget yourself a little and not be
  anxious&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I'll try,' said Kipps, looking rather hard at the tea-pot. 'I'll do my
  best to try.'</p>

  <p>'I know you will,' she said; and laid a hand for an instant upon his
  shoulder and withdrew it.</p>

  <p>He did not perceive her caress. 'One has to learn,' he said. His attention
  was distracted by the strenuous efforts that were going on in the back of his
  head to translate, 'I say, didn't you ought to name the day?' into easy as
  well as elegant English, a struggle that was still undecided when the time
  came for them to part...</p>

  <p>He sat for a long time at the open window of his sitting-room with an
  intent face, recapitulating that interview. His eyes rested at last almost
  reproachfully on the silk hat beside him. "Ow is one to know?' he asked. His
  attention was caught by a rubbed place in the nap, and, still thoughtful, he
  rolled up his handkerchief skilfully into a soft ball and began to smooth
  this down.</p>

  <p>"Ow the Juice is one to know?' he said, putting down the hat with some
  emphasis.</p>

  <p>He rose up, went across the room to the sideboard, and, standing there,
  opened and began to read in Manners and Rules.</p>

  <h2>
<a id="chap24"
     name="chap24"></a>IV. &mdash; THE BICYCLE MANUFACTURER</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">So Kipps embarked upon his engagement, steeled himself to
the high
  enterprise of marrying above his breeding. The next morning found him
  dressing with a certain quiet severity of movement, and it seemed to his
  landlady's housemaid that he was unusually dignified at breakfast. He
  meditated profoundly over his kipper and his kidney and bacon. He was going
  to New Romney to tell the old people what had happened and where he stood.
  And the love of Helen had also given him courage to do what Buggins had once
  suggested to him as a thing he would do were he in Kipps' place, and that was
  to hire a motor-car for the afternoon. He had an early cold lunch, and then,
  with an air of quiet resolution, assumed a cap and coat he had purchased to
  this end, and, thus equipped, strolled round, blowing slightly, to the motor
  shop. The transaction was unexpectedly easy, and within the hour, Kipps,
  spectacled and wrapped about, was tootling through Dymchurch.</p>

  <p>They came to a stop smartly and neatly outside the little toyshop. 'Make
  that thing 'oot a bit, will you?' said Kipps. 'Yes. That's it.'</p>

  <p>'Whup,' said the motor-car. 'Whurrup.' Both his aunt and uncle came out on
  the pavement. 'Why, it's Artie!' cried his aunt; and Kipps had a moment of
  triumph.</p>

  <p>He descended to hand-claspings, removed wraps and spectacles, and the
  motor-driver retired to take 'an hour off.' Old Kipps surveyed the machinery
  and disconcerted Kipps for a moment by asking him, in a knowing tone, what
  they asked him for a thing like that. The two men stood inspecting the
  machine and impressing the neighbours for a time, and then they strolled
  through the shop into the little parlour for a drink.</p>

  <p>'They ain't settled,' old Kipps had said at the neighbours. 'They ain't
  got no further than experiments. There's a bit of take-in about each. You
  take my advice and wait, me boy, even if it's a year or two before you buy
  one for your own use.'</p>

  <p>(Though Kipps had said nothing of doing anything of the sort.)</p>

  <p>"Ow d'you like that whisky I sent?' asked Kipps, dodging the old familiar
  bunch of children's pails.</p>

  <p>Old Kipps became tactful. 'It's very good whisky, my boy,' said old Kipps.
  'I 'aven't the slightest doubt it's a very good whisky, and cost you a tidy
  price. But&mdash;dashed if it soots me! They put this here Foozle Ile in it,
  my boy, and it ketches me jest 'ere.' He indicated his centre of figure.
  'Gives me the heartburn,' he said, and shook his head rather sadly.</p>

  <p>'It's a very good whisky,' said Kipps. 'It's what the actor-manager chaps
  drink in London, I 'appen to know.'</p>

  <p>'I dessay they do, my boy,' said old Kipps, 'but then they've 'ad their
  livers burnt out&mdash;and I aven't. They ain't dellicat like me. My stummik
  always 'as been extrydellicat. Sometimes it's almost been as though nothing
  would lay on it. But that's in passing. I liked those segars. You can send me
  some more of them segars...'</p>

  <p>You cannot lead a conversation straight from the gastric consequences of
  Foozle Ile to Love, and so Kipps after a friendly inspection of a rare old
  engraving after Morland (perfect except for a hole kicked through the centre)
  that his Uncle had recently purchased by private haggle, came to the topic of
  the old people's removal.</p>

  <p>At the outset of Kipps' great fortunes there had been much talk of some
  permanent provision for them. It had been conceded they were to be provided
  for comfortably, and the phrase, 'retire from business,' had been very much
  in the air. Kipps had pictured an ideal cottage with a creeper always in
  exuberant flower about the door, where the sun shone for ever, and the wind
  never blew, and a perpetual welcome hovered in the doorway. It was an
  agreeable dream, but when it came to the point of deciding upon this
  particular cottage or that, and on this particular house or that, Kipps was
  surprised by an unexpected clinging to the little home, which he had always
  understood to be the worst of all possible houses.</p>

  <p>'We don't want to move in a 'urry,' said Mrs. Kipps.</p>

  <p>'When we want to move, we want to move for life. I've had enough moving
  about in my time,' said old Kipps. 'We can do here a bit more now we done
  here so long,' said Mrs. Kipps.</p>

  <p>'You lemme look about a bit fust,' said old Kipps.</p>

  <p>And in looking about old Kipps found perhaps a finer joy than any mere
  possession could have given. He would shut his shop more or less effectually
  against the intrusion of customers, and toddle abroad seeking a new matter
  for his dream; no house was too small and none too large for his knowing
  inquiries. Occupied houses took his fancy more than vacant ones, and he would
  remark. 'You won't be a-livin' 'ere for ever, even if you think you will,'
  when irate householders protested against the unsolicited examination of
  their more intimate premises...</p>

  <p>Remarkable difficulties arose, of a totally unexpected sort.</p>

  <p>'If we 'ave a larger 'ouse,' said Mrs. Kipps, with sudden bitterness, 'we
  shall want a servant, and I don't want no gells in the place larfin' at me,
  sniggerin' and larfin' and prancin' and trapesin', lardy da!'</p>

  <p>'If we 'ave a smaller 'ouse,' said Mrs. Kipps, 'there won't be room to
  swing a cat.'</p>

  <p>Room to swing a cat, it seemed, was absolutely essential. It was an
  infrequent but indispensable operation. 'When we do move,' said old Kipps,
  'if we could get a bit of shootin'&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I don't want to sell off all this here stock for nothin',' said old
  Kipps. 'It's took years to 'cumulate. I put a ticket in the winder sayin',
  "sellin' orf," but it 'asn't brought nothing like a roosh. One of these 'ere
  dratted visitors, pretendin' to want an air-gun, was all me 'ad in yesterday.
  Jest an excuse for spyin' round, and then go away and larf at you. No thanky
  to everything, it didn't matter what...That's 'ow I look at it, Artie.'</p>

  <p>They pursued meandering fancies about the topic of their future settlement
  for a space, and Kipps became more and more hopeless of any proper
  conversational opening that would lead to his great announcement, and more
  and more uncertain how such an opening should be taken. Once, indeed, old
  Kipps, anxious to get away from this dangerous subject of removals, began,
  'And what are you a-doin' of in Folkestone? I shall have to come over and see
  you one of these days,' but before Kipps could get in upon that, his uncle
  had passed into a general exposition of the proper treatment of landladies
  and their humbugging, cheating ways, and so the opportunity vanished. It
  seemed to Kipps the only thing to do was to go out into the town for a
  stroll, compose an effectual opening at leisure, and then come back and
  discharge it at them in its consecutive completeness. And even out-of-doors
  and alone, he found his mind distracted by irrelevant thoughts.</p>

  <p>His steps led him out of the High Street towards the church, and he leant
  for a time over the gate that had once been the winning-post of his race with
  Ann Pornick, and presently found himself in a sitting position on the top
  rail. He had to get things smooth again, he knew; his mind was like a mirror
  of water after a breeze. The image of Helen and his great future was broken
  and mingled into fragmentary reflections of remoter things, of the good name
  of Old Methuselah Three Stars, of long-dormant memories the High Street saw
  fit, by sometrick of light and atmosphere, to arouse that afternoon...</p>

  <p>Abruptly a fine full voice from under his elbow shouted, 'What-o, Art!'
  and behold Sid Pornick was back in his world, leaning over the gate beside
  him, and holding out a friendly hand.</p>

  <p>He was oddly changed, and yet oddly like the Sid that Kipps had known. He
  had the old broad face and mouth, abundantly freckled, the same short nose,
  and the same blunt chin, the same odd suggestion of his sister Ann without a
  touch of her beauty; but he had quite a new voice, loud, and a little hard,
  and his upper lip carried a stiff and very fair moustache.</p>

  <p>Kipps shook hands. 'I was jest thinking of you, Sid,' he said, 'jest this
  very moment, and wondering if ever I should see you again&mdash;ever. And
  'ere you are!'</p>

  <p>'One likes a look round at times,' said Sid. 'How are you, old chap?'</p>

  <p>'All right,' said Kipps. 'I just been lef&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You aren't changed much,' interrupted Sid.</p>

  <p>'Ent I?' said Kipps, foiled.</p>

  <p>'I knew your back directly I came round the corner. Spite of that 'at you
  got on. Hang it, I said, that's Art Kipps or the devil. And so it was.'</p>

  <p>Kipps made a movement of his neck as if he would look at his back and
  judge. Then he looked Sid in the face. 'You got a moustache, Sid,' he
  said.</p>

  <p>'I s'pose you're having your holidays?' said Sid. 'Well, partly. But I
  just been lef&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I'm taking a bit of a holiday,' Sid went on. 'But the fact is, I have to
  give myself holidays nowadays. I've set up for myself.'</p>

  <p>'Not down here?'</p>

  <p>'No fear! I'm not a turnip. I've started in Hammersmith, manufacturing.'
  Sid spoke off-hand, as though there was no such thing as pride.</p>

  <p>'Not drapery?'</p>

  <p>'No fear! Engineer. Manufacture bicycles.' He clapped his hand to his
  breast pocket and produced a number of pink handbills. He handed one to
  Kipps, and prevented him reading it by explanations and explanatory dabs of a
  pointing finger. 'That's our make&mdash;my make, to be exact&mdash;the Red
  Flag&mdash;see? I got a transfer with my name&mdash;Pantocrat tyres, eight
  pounds&mdash;yes, there&mdash;Clinchers ten, Dunlops eleven, Ladies' one
  pound more&mdash;that's the lady's. Best machine at a democratic price in
  London. No guineas and no discounts&mdash;honest trade. I build 'em&mdash;to
  order. I've built,' he reflected, looking away seaward, 'seventeen. Counting
  orders in 'and...</p>

  <p>'Come down to look at the old place a bit,' said Sid. 'Mother likes it at
  times.'</p>

  <p>'Thought you'd all gone away&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'What! after my father's death? No! My mother's come back, and she's
  living at Muggett's cottages. The sea-air suits 'er. She likes the old place
  better than Hammersmith...and I can afford it. Got an old crony or so
  here...Gossip&mdash;have tea...S'pose you ain't married, Kipps?</p>

  <p>Kipps shook his head. 'I&mdash;' he began.</p>

  <p>'I am,' said Sid. 'Married these two years, and got a nipper. Proper
  little chap.' Kipps got his word in at last. 'I got engaged day before
  yesterday,' he said. 'Ah!' said Sid airily. 'That's all right. Who's the
  fortunate lady!'</p>

  <p>Kipps tried to speak in an off-hand way. He stuck his hands in his pockets
  as he spoke. 'She's a solicitor's daughter,' he said, 'in Folkestone.
  Rather'r nice set. County family. Related to the Earl of
  Beaupr&Uacute;s&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Steady on!' cried Sid.</p>

  <p>'You see, I've 'ad a bit of luck, Sid. Been lef money.'</p>

  <p>Sid's eye travelled instinctively to mark Kipps' garments. 'How much?' he
  asked. "Bout twelve 'undred a year,' said Kipps, more off-handedly than
  ever. 'Lord!' said Sid, with a note of positive dismay, and stepped back a
  pace or two.</p>

  <p>'My granfaver it was,' said Kipps, trying hard to be calm and simple.
  "Ardly knew I 'ad a granfaver. And then bang! When o' Bean, the solicitor,
  told me of it, you could 'ave knocked me down&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Ow much?' demanded Sid, with a sharp note in his voice. Twelve 'undred
  pound a year&mdash;proximately, that is...'</p>

  <p>Sid's attempt at genial unenvious congratulation did not last a minute. He
  shook hands with an unreal heartiness, and said he was jolly glad. 'It's a
  blooming stroke of Luck,' he said.</p>

  <p>'It's a blooming' stroke of Luck,' he repeated, 'that's what it is,' with
  the smile fading from his face. 'Of course, better you 'ave it than me, o'
  chap. So I don't envy you, anyhow. I couldn't keep it if I did 'ave it.'</p>

  <p>'Ow's that?' said Kipps, a little hipped by Sid's patent chagrin.</p>

  <p>'I'm a Socialist, you see,' said Sid. 'I don't 'old with Wealth. What is
  Wealth? Labour robbed out of the poor. At most it's only yours in trust.
  Leastways, that's 'ow I should take it.'</p>

  <p>He reflected. The Present distribution of Wealth,' he said, and
  stopped.</p>

  <p>Then he let himself go, with unmasked bitterness. 'It's no sense at all.
  It's jest damn foolishness. Who's going to work and care in a muddle like
  this? Here first you do&mdash;something anyhow&mdash;of the world's work and
  it pays you hardly anything, and then it invites you to do nothing, nothing
  whatever, and pays you twelve hundred pounds a year. Who's going to respect
  laws and customs when they come to damn silliness like that?'</p>

  <p>He repeated, 'Twelve hundred pounds a year!'</p>

  <p>At the sight of Kipps' face he relented slightly.</p>

  <p>'It's not you I'm thinking of, o' man; it's the system. Better you than
  most people. Still&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He laid both hands on the gate and repeated to himself, 'Twelve 'undred a
  year&mdash;Gee-whiz, Kipps! You'll be a swell!'</p>

  <p>'I shan't,' said Kipps, with imperfect conviction. 'No fear.'</p>

  <p>'You can't 'ave money like that and not swell out. You'll soon be too big
  to speak to&mdash;'ow do they put it?&mdash;a mere mechanic like me.'</p>

  <p>'No fear, Siddee,' said Kipps, with conviction. 'I ain't that sort.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' said Sid, with a sort of unwilling scepticism, 'money'll be too much
  for you. Besides&mdash;you're caught by a swell already.'</p>

  <p>"Ow d'yer mean?'</p>

  <p>'That girl you're going to marry. Masterman says&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oo's Masterman?'</p>

  <p>'Rare good chap, I know&mdash;takes my first-floor front room. Masterman
  says it's always the wife pitches the key. Always. There's no social
  differences&mdash;till women come in.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' said Kipps profoundly. 'You don't know.'</p>

  <p>Sid shook his head. 'Fancy!' he reflected, 'Art Kipps!...Twelve 'Undred a
  Year!' Kipps tried to bridge that opening gulf. 'Remember the Hurons,
  Sid?'</p>

  <p>'Rather,' said Sid.</p>

  <p>'Remember that wreck?'</p>

  <p>'I can smell it now&mdash;sort of sour smell.'</p>

  <p>Kipps was silent for a moment, with reminiscent eyes on Sid's still
  troubled face. 'I say, Sid, 'ow's Ann?'</p>

  <p>'She's all right,' said Sid.</p>

  <p>'Where is she now?'</p>

  <p>'In a place...Ashford.'</p>

  <p>'Oh!'</p>

  <p>Sid's face had became a shade sulkier than before.</p>

  <p>'The fact is,' he said, 'we don't get on very well together. I don't hold
  with service. We're common people, I suppose, but I don't like it. I don't
  see why a sister of mine should wait at other people's tables. No. Not even
  if they got Twelve 'Undred a Year.'</p>

  <p>Kipps tried to change the point of application. 'Remember 'ow you came out
  once when we were racing here?...She didn't run bad for a girl.'</p>

  <p>And his own words raised an image brighter than he could have supposed, so
  bright it seemed to breathe before him, and did not fade altogether, even
  when he was back in Folkestone an hour or so later.</p>

  <p>But Sid was not to be deflected from that other rankling theme by any
  reminiscences of Ann.</p>

  <p>'I wonder what you will do with all that money,' he speculated. 'I wonder
  if you will do any good at all. I wonder what you could do. You should hear
  Masterman. He'd tell you things. Suppose it came to me; what should I do?
  It's no good giving it back to the State as things are. Start an Owenite
  profit-sharing factory perhaps. Or a new Socialist paper. We want a new
  Socialist paper.'</p>

  <p>He tried to drown his personal chagrin in elaborate exemplary
  suggestions...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">'I must be gettin' on to my motor,' said Kipps at last,
having to a large
  extent heard him out. 'What! Got a motor?'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Kipps apologetically. 'Only jobbed for the day.'</p>

  <p>"Ow much?'</p>

  <p>'Five pounds.'</p>

  <p>'Keep five families for a week! Good Lord!' That seemed to crown Sid's
  disgust.</p>

  <p>Yet drawn by a sort of fascination, he came with Kipps and assisted at the
  mounting of the motor. He was pleased to note it was not the most modern of
  motors, but that was the only grain of comfort. Kipps mounted at once, after
  one violent agitation of the little shop-door to set the bell ajangle and
  warn his uncle and aunt. Sid assisted with the great fur-lined overcoat and
  examined the spectacles.</p>

  <p>'Good-bye, o' chap!' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Good-bye, o' chap!' said Sid.</p>

  <p>The old people came out to say good-bye.</p>

  <p>Old Kipps was radiant with triumph. "Pon my sammy, Artie! I'm a goo' mind
  to come with you,' he shouted; and then, 'I got something you might take with
  you!'</p>

  <p>He dodged back into the shop and returned with the perforated engraving
  after Morland.</p>

  <p>'You stick to this, my boy,' he said. 'You get it repaired by some one who
  knows. It's the most vallyble thing I got you so far&mdash;you take my
  word.'</p>

  <p>'Warrup!' said the motor, and tuff, tuff, tuff, and backed and snorted,
  while old Kipps danced about on the pavement as if foreseeing complex
  catastrophes, and told the driver, 'That's all right.'</p>

  <p>He waved his stout stick to his receding nephew. Then he turned to Sid.
  'Now if you could make something like that, young Pornick, you might blow a
  bit!'</p>

  <p>'I'll make a doocid sight better than that before I done,' said Sid, hands
  deep in his pockets. 'Not you,' said old Kipps.</p>

  <p>The motor set up a prolonged sobbing moan and vanished round the corner.
  Sid stood motionless for a space, unheeding some further remark from old
  Kipps. The young mechanic had just discovered that to have manufactured
  seventeen bicycles, including orders in hand, is not so big a thing as he had
  supposed, and such discoveries try one's manhood...</p>

  <p>'Oh, well!' said Sid at last, and turned his face towards his mother's
  cottage.</p>

  <p>She had got a hot tea-cake for him, and she was a little hurt that he was
  dark and preoccupied as he consumed it. He had always been such a boy for
  tea-cake, and then when one went out specially and got him one&mdash;!</p>

  <p>He did not tell her&mdash;he did not tell any one&mdash;he had seen young
  Kipps. He did not want to talk about Kipps for a bit to any one at
  all.</p>

     name="chap25"></a>V. &mdash; THE PUPIL LOVER</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">When Kipps came to reflect upon his afternoon's work, he
had his first
  inkling of certain comprehensive incompatibilities lying about the course of
  true love in his particular case. He had felt without understanding the
  incongruity between the announcement he had failed to make and the circle of
  ideas of his aunt and uncle. It was this rather than the want of a specific
  intention that had silenced him, the perception that when he travelled from
  Folkestone to New Romney he travelled from an atmosphere where his engagement
  to Helen was sane and excellent to an atmosphere where it was only to be
  regarded with incredulous suspicion. Coupled and associated with this jar was
  his sense of the altered behaviour of Sid Pornick, the evident shock to that
  ancient alliance caused by the fact of his enrichment, the touch of hostility
  in his 'You'll soon be swelled too big to speak to a poor mechanic like me.'
  Kipps was unprepared for the unpleasant truth&mdash;that the path of social
  advancement is, and must be, strewn with broken friendships. This first
  protrusion of that fact caused a painful confusion in his mind. It was
  speedily to protrude in a far more serious fashion in relation to the 'hands'
  from the Emporium, and Chitterlow.</p>

  <p>From the day at Lympne Castle his relations with Helen had entered upon a
  new footing. He had prayed for Helen as good souls pray for Heaven, with as
  little understanding of what it was he prayed for. And now that period of
  standing humbly in the shadows before the shrine was over, and the goddess,
  her veil of mystery flung aside, had come down to him and taken hold of him,
  a good strong firm hold, and walked by his side. She liked him. What was
  singular was, that very soon she had kissed him thrice, whimsically upon the
  brow, and he had never kissed her at all. He could not analyse his feelings,
  only he knew the world was wonderfully changed about them; but the truth was
  that, though he still worshipped and feared her, though his pride in his
  engagement was ridiculously vast, he loved her now no more. That subtle
  something, woven of the most delicate strands of self-love and tenderness and
  desire, had vanished imperceptibly, and was gone now for ever. But that she
  did not suspect in him, nor, as a matter of fact, did he.</p>

  <p>She took him in hand in perfect good faith. She told him things about his
  accent; she told him things about his bearing, about his costume and his way
  of looking at things. She thrust the blade of her intelligence into the
  tenderest corners of Kipps' secret vanity; she slashed his most intimate
  pride to bleeding tatters. He sought very diligently to anticipate some at
  least of these informing thrusts by making great use of Coote. But the
  unanticipated made a brave number...</p>

  <p>She found his simple willingness a very lovable thing.</p>

  <p>Indeed, she liked him more and more. There was a touch of motherliness in
  her feelings towards him. But his upbringing and his associations had been,
  she diagnosed, 'awful.' At New Romney she glanced but little&mdash;that was
  remote. But in her inventory&mdash;she went over him as one might go over a
  newly taken house, with impartial thoroughness&mdash;she discovered more
  proximate influences, surprising intimations of nocturnal
  'sing-songs'&mdash;she pictured it as almost shocking that Kipps should sing
  to the banjo&mdash;much low-grade wisdom treasured from a person called
  Buggins&mdash;'Who is Buggins?' said Helen&mdash;vague figures of
  indisputable vulgarity&mdash;Pearce and Carshot&mdash;and more particularly a
  very terrible social phenomenon&mdash;Chitterlow.</p>

  <p>Chitterlow blazed upon them with unheralded oppressive brilliance, the
  first time they were abroad together.</p>

  <p>They were going along the front of the Leas to see a school-play in
  Sandgate&mdash;at the last moment Mrs. Walshingham had been unable to come
  with them&mdash;when Chitterlow loomed up into the new world. He was wearing
the
  suit of striped flannel and the straw hat that had followed Kipps' payment in
  advance for his course in elocution, his hands were deep in his side-pockets
  and animated the corners of his jacket, and his attentive gaze at the passing
  loungers, the faint smile under his boldly drawn nose, showed him engaged in
  studying character&mdash;no doubt for some forthcoming play.</p>

  <p>'What HO!' said he, at the sight of Kipps, and swept off the straw hat
  with so ample a clutch of his great flat hand that it suggested to Helen's
  startled mind a conjurer about to palm a halfpenny.</p>

  <p>"Ello, Chitt'low,' said Kipps, a little awkwardly, and not saluting.</p>

  <p>Chitterlow hesitated. 'Half a mo', my boy,' he said, and arrested Kipps by
  extending a large hand over his chest. 'Excuse me, my dear,' he said, bowing
  like his Russian count by way of apology to Helen, and with a smile that
  would have killed at a hundred yards. He effected a semi-confidential
  grouping of himself and Kipps, while Helen stood in white amazement.</p>

  <p>'About that play,' he said.</p>

  <p>"Ow about it?' asked Kipps, acutely aware of Helen.</p>

  <p>'It's all right,' said Chitterlow. 'There's a strong smell of syndicate in
  the air, I may tell you. Strong.'</p>

  <p>'That's aw right,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'You needn't tell everybody,' said Chitterlow, with a transitory
  confidential hand to his mouth, which pointed the application of the
  'everybody' just a trifle too strongly. 'But I think it's coming off.
  However&mdash;I mustn't detain you now. So long. You'll come round, eh?'</p>

  <p>'Right you are,' said Kipps. 'To-night?'</p>

  <p>'At eight.'</p>

  <p>And then, and more in the manner of a Russian prince than any common
  count, Chitterlow bowed and withdrew. Just for a moment he allowed a
  conquering eye to challenge Helen's, and noted her for a girl of
  quality...</p>

  <p>There was a silence between our lovers for a space.</p>

  <p>'That,' said Kipps, with an allusive movement of the head, 'was
  Chitt'low.'</p>

  <p>'Is he&mdash;a friend of yours?'</p>

  <p>'In a way...You see, I met Mm. Leastways 'e met me. Run into me with a
  bicycle, 'e did, and so we got talking together.'</p>

  <p>He tried to appear at his ease. The young lady scrutinised his profile.
  'What is he?'</p>

  <p>"E's a Nacter chap,' said Kipps. 'Leastways 'e writes plays.'</p>

  <p>'And sells them?'</p>

  <p>'Partly.'</p>

  <p>'Whom to.'</p>

  <p>'Different people. Shares he sells&mdash;It's all right, reely&mdash;</p>

  <p>'I meant to tell you about him before.'</p>

  <p>Helen looked over her shoulder to catch a view of Chitterlow's retreating
  aspect. It did not compel her complete confidence.</p>

  <p>She turned to her lover, and said in a tone of quiet authority, 'You must
  tell me all about Chitterlow. Now.' The explanation began...</p>

  <p>The School Play came almost as a relief to Kipps. In the flusterment of
  going in he could almost forget, for a time, his Laocoon struggle to explain,
  and in the intervals he did his best to keep forgetting. But Helen, with a
  gentle insistence, resumed the explanation of Chitterlow as they returned
  towards Folkestone.</p>

  <p>Chitterlow was confoundedly difficult to explain. You could hardly
  imagine!</p>

  <p>There was an almost motherly anxiety in Helen's manner, blended with the
  resolution of a schoolmistress to get to the bottom of the affair. Kipps'
  ears were soon quite brightly red.</p>

  <p>'Have you seen one of his plays?'</p>

  <p>"E's tole me about one.'</p>

  <p>'But on the stage.'</p>

  <p>'No. He 'asn't 'ad any on the stage yet. That's all coming...'</p>

  <p>'Promise me,' she said in conclusion, 'you won't do anything without
  consulting me.' And, of course, Kipps promised. 'Oo no!'</p>

  <p>They went on their way in silence.</p>

  <p>'One can't know everybody,' said Helen in general.</p>

  <p>'Of course,' said Kipps, 'in a sort of way it was him that helped me to my
  money.' And he indicated in a confused manner the story of the advertisement.
  'I don't like to drop 'im all at once,' he added.</p>

  <p>Helen was silent for a space, and when she spoke she went off at a
  tangent. 'We shall live in London&mdash;soon,' she remarked. 'It's only while
  we are here.'</p>

  <p>It was the first intimation she gave him of their postnuptial
  prospects.</p>

  <p>'We shall have a nice little flat somewhere, not too far west, and there
  we shall build up a circle of our own.'</p>

  <p>All that declining summer Kipps was the pupil lover. He made an
  extraordinarily open secret of his desire for self-improvement; indeed Helen
  had to hint once or twice that his modest frankness was excessive, and all
  this new circle of friends did, each after his or her manner, everything that
  was possible to supplement Helen's efforts and help him to ease and skill in
  the more cultivated circles to which he had come. Coote was still the chief
  teacher, the tutor&mdash;there are so many little difficulties that a man may
  take to another man that he would not care to propound to the woman he
  loves&mdash;but they were all, so to speak, upon the staff. Even the freckled
  girl said to him once in a pleasant way, 'You mustn't say 'centre temps,' you
  must say 'contraytom,' when he borrowed that expression from Manners and
  Rules, and she tried, at his own suggestion, to give him clear ideas upon the
  subject of 'as' and 'has.' A certain confusion between these words was
  becoming evident, the first-fruits of a lesson from Chitterlow on the
  aspirate. Hitherto he had discarded that dangerous letter almost altogether,
  but now he would pull up at words beginning with 'h' and draw a sawing
  breath&mdash;rather like a startled kitten&mdash;and then aspirate with
  vigour.</p>

  <p>Said Kipps one day, 'As 'e?&mdash;I should say, ah&mdash;Has 'e? Ye know I
  got a lot of difficulty over them two words, which is which?'</p>

  <p>'Well, 'as' is a conjunction, and 'has' is a verb.'</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Kipps, 'but when is 'has' a conjunction and when is 'as' a
  verb?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said the freckled girl, preparing to be very lucid. 'It's has when
  it means one has, meaning having, but if it isn't it's as. As, for instance,
  one says 'e&mdash;I mean he&mdash;He has. But one says&mdash;'as he
  has."</p>

  <p>'I see,' said Kipps. 'So I ought to say "as 'e?"</p>

  <p>'No, if you are asking a question you say has 'e&mdash;I mean he&mdash;'as
  he?' She blushed quite brightly, but still clung to her air of lucidity.</p>

  <p>'I see,' said Kipps. He was about to say something further, but he
  desisted. 'I got it much clearer now. Has 'e? Has 'e as. Yes.'</p>

  <p>'If you remember about having.'</p>

  <p>'Oo, I will,' said Kipps...</p>

  <p>Miss Coote specialised in Kipps' artistic development. She had early
  formed an opinion that he had considerable artistic sensibility; his remarks
  on her work had struck her as decidedly intelligent, and whenever he called
  round to see them she would show him some work of art&mdash;now an
  illustrated book, now perhaps a colour print of a Botticelli, now the Hundred
  Best Paintings, now 'Academy Pictures,' now a German art handbook and now
  some magazine of furniture and design. 'I know you like these things,' she
  used to say, and Kipps said, 'Oo, I do.' He soon acquired a little armoury of
  appreciative sayings. When presently the Walshinghams took him up to the Arts
  and Crafts, his deportment was intelligent in the extreme. For a time he kept
  a wary silence and suddenly pitched upon a colour print. That's rather nace,'
  he said to Mrs. Walshingham. 'That lill' thing. There.' He always said things
  like that by preference to the mother rather than the daughter unless he was
  perfectly sure.</p>

  <p>He quite took to Mrs. Walshingham. He was impressed by her conspicuous
  tact and refinement; it seemed to him that the ladylike could go no farther.
  She was always dressed with a delicate fussiness that was never disarranged,
  and even a sort of faded quality about her hair, and face, and bearing, and
  emotions, contributed to her effect. Kipps was not a big man, and commonly he
  did not feel a big man, but with Mrs. Walshingham he always felt enormous and
  distended, as though he was a navy who had taken some disagreeable poison
  which puffed him up inside his skin as a preliminary to bursting. He felt,
  too, as though he had been rolled in clay and his hair dressed with gum. And
  he felt that his voice was strident and his accent like somebody swinging a
  crowded pig's-tail in a free and careless manner. All this increased and
  enforced his respect for her. Her hand, which flitted often and again to his
  hand and arm, was singularly well shaped and cool. 'Arthur,' she called him
  from the very beginning.</p>

  <p>She did not so much positively teach and tell him as tactfully guide and
  infect him. Her conversation was not so much didactic as exemplary. She would
  say, 'I do like people to do' so and so. She would tell him anecdotes of nice
  things done, of gentlemanly feats of graceful consideration; she would record
  her neat observations of people in trains and omnibuses, how, for example, a
  man had passed her change to the conductor, 'quite a common man he looked,'
  but he had lifted his hat. She stamped Kipps so deeply with the hat-raising
  habit that he would uncover if he found himself in the same railway
  ticket-office with a lady, and so stand ceremoniously until the difficulties
  of change drove him to an apologetic provisional oblique resumption of his
  headgear...And robbing these things of any air of personal application, she
  threw about them an abundant talk about her two children&mdash;she called
  them her Twin Jewels quite frequently&mdash;about their gifts, their
  temperaments, their ambition, their need of opportunity. They needed
  opportunity, she would say, as other people needed air...</p>

  <p>In his conversations with her Kipps always assumed&mdash;and she seemed to
  assume&mdash;that she was to join that home in London Helen foreshadowed; but
  he was surprised one day to gather that this was to be the case. 'It wouldn't
  do,' said Helen, with decision. 'We want to make a circle of our own.'</p>

  <p>'But won't she be a bit lonely down here?' asked Kipps.</p>

  <p>'There's the Waces, and Mrs. Prebble, and Mrs. Bindon Botting,
  and&mdash;lots of people she knows.' And Helen dismissed this
  possibility...</p>

  <p>Young Walshingham's share in the educational syndicate was smaller. But he
  shone out when they went to London on that Arts and Crafts expedition. Then
  this rising man of affairs showed Kipps how to buy the more theatrical
  weeklies for consumption in the train, how to buy and what to buy in the way
  of cigarettes with gold tips and shilling cigars, and how to order hock for
  lunch and sparkling Moselle for dinner, how to calculate the fare of a hanson
  cab&mdash;penny a minute while he goes&mdash;how to look intelligently at an
  hotel tape, and how to sit still in a train like a thoughtful man instead of
  talking like a fool and giving yourself away. And he, too, would glance at
  the good time coming when they were to be in London for good and all.</p>

  <p>That prospect expanded and developed particulars. It presently took up a
  large part of Helen's conversation. Her conversations with Kipps were never
  of a grossly sentimental sort; there was a shyness of speech in that matter
  with both of them; but these new adumbrations were at least as interesting,
  and not so directly disagreeable, as the clear-out intimations of personal
  defect that for a time had so greatly chastened Kipps' delight in her
  presence. The future presented itself with an almost perfect frankness as a
  joint campaign of Mrs. Walshingham's Twin Jewels upon the Great World, with
  Kipps in the capacity of baggage and supply. They would still be dreadfully
  poor, of course&mdash;this amazed Kipps, but he said nothing&mdash;until
  'Brudderkins' began to succeed; but if they were clever and lucky they might
  do a great deal.</p>

  <p>When Helen spoke of London, a brooding look, as of one who contemplates a
  distant country, came into her eyes. Already it seemed they had the nucleus
  of a set. Brudderkins was a member of the Theatrical Judges, an excellent and
  influential little club of journalists and literary people, and he knew
  Shimer and Stargate and Whiffle of the 'Red Dragon,' and besides these were
  the Revels. They knew the Revels quite well. Sidney Revel, before his rapid
  rise to prominence as a writer of epigrammatic essays that were quite above
  the ordinary public, had been an assistant master at one of the best
  Folkestone schools. Brudderkins had brought him home to tea several times,
  and it was he had first suggested Helen should try and write. 'It's perfectly
  easy,' Sidney had said. He had been writing occasional things for the evening
  papers and for the weekly reviews even at that time. Then he had gone up to
  London, and had almost unavoidably become a dramatic critic. Those brilliant
  essays had followed, and then Red Hearts a-Beating, the romance that had made
  him. It was a tale of spirited adventure, full of youth and beauty and naive
  passion and generous devotion, bold, as the Bookman said, and frank in
  places, but never in the slightest degree morbid. He had met and married an
  American widow with quite a lot of money, and they had made a very distinct
  place for themselves, Kipps learnt, in the literary and artistic society of
  London. Helen seemed to dwell on the Revels a great deal; it was her
  exemplary story, and when she spoke of Sidney&mdash;she often called him
  Sidney&mdash;she would become thoughtful. She spoke most of him, naturally,
  because she had still to meet Mrs. Revel...Certainly they would be in the
  world in no time, even if the distant connection with the Beaupr&Uacute;s
  family came to nothing.</p>

  <p>Kipps gathered that with his marriage and the movement to London they were
  to undergo that subtle change of name Coote had first adumbrated. They were
  to become 'Cuyps,' Mr. and Mrs. Cuyps. Or was it Cuyp?</p>

  <p>'It'll be rum at first,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'I dessay I shall soon get into it,' he said...</p>

  <p>So in their several ways they all contributed to enlarge and refine and
  exercise the intelligence of Kipps. And behind all these other influences,
  and as it were presiding over and correcting these influences, was Kipps'
  nearest friend, Coote, a sort of master of the ceremonies. You figure his
  face, blowing slightly with solicitude, his slate-coloured, projecting, but
  not unkindly eye intent upon our hero. The thing, he thought, was going off
  admirably. He studied Kipps' character immensely. He would discuss him with
  his sister, with Mrs. Walshingham, with the freckled girl, with any one who
  would stand it. 'He is an interesting character,' he would say,
  'likeable&mdash;a sort of gentleman by instinct. He takes to all these
  things. He improves every day. He'll soon get Sang-Froid. We took him up just
  in time. He wants now&mdash;Well&mdash;next year, perhaps, if there is a good
  Extension Literature course he might go in for it. He wants to go in for
  something like that.'</p>

  <p>'He's going in for his bicycle now,' said Mrs. Walshingham.</p>

  <p>'That's all right for summer,' said Coote, 'but he wants to go in for some
  serious intellectual interest, something to take him out of himself a little
  more. Savoir Faire and self-forgetfulness is more than half the secret of
  Sang-Froid'...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">The world, as Coote presented it, was in part an
endorsement, in part an
  amplification, and in part a rectification of the world of Kipps&mdash;the
  world that derived from the old couple in New Romney and had been developed
  in the Emporium; the world, in fact, of common British life. There was the
  same subtle sense of social gradation that had moved Mrs. Kipps to prohibit
  intercourse with labourers' children, and the same dread of anything 'common'
  that had kept the personal quality of Mr. Shalford's establishment so high.
  But now a certain disagreeable doubt about Kipps' own position was removed,
  and he stood with Coote inside the sphere of gentlemen assured. Within the
  sphere of gentlemen there are distinctions of rank indeed, but none of class;
  there are the Big People, and the modest, refined, gentlemanly little people,
  like Coote, who may even dabble in the professions and counterless trades;
  there are lords and magnificences, and there are gentle-folk who have to
  manage&mdash;but they can all call on one another, they preserve a general
  quality of deportment throughout, they constitute that great state within the
  state&mdash;Society.</p>

  <p>'But reely,' said the Pupil, 'not what you call being in Society?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Coote. 'Of course, down here, one doesn't see much of it, but
  there's local society. It has the same rules.'</p>

  <p>'Calling and all that?'</p>

  <p>'Precisely,' said Coote.</p>

  <p>Kipps thought, whistled a bar, and suddenly broached a question of
  conscience. 'I often wonder,' he said, 'whether I oughtn't to dress for
  dinner&mdash;when I'm alone 'ere.'</p>

  <p>Coote protruded his lips and reflected. 'Not full dress,' he adjudicated;
  'that would be a little excessive. But you should change, you know. Put on a
  mess jacket, and that sort of thing&mdash;easy dress. That is what I should
  do, certainly, if I wasn't in harness&mdash;and poor.'</p>

  <p>He coughed modestly, and patted his hair behind.</p>

  <p>And after that the washing-bill of Kipps quadrupled, and he was to be seen
  at times by the bandstand with his light summer overcoat unbuttoned, to give
  a glimpse of his nice white tie. He and Coote would be smoking the gold-
  tipped cigarettes young Walshingham had prescribed as 'chic,' and
  appreciating the music highly. 'That's&mdash;puff&mdash;a very nice bit,'
  Kipps would say; or better, 'That's nace.' And at the first grunts of the
  loyal anthem they stood with religiously uplifted hats. Whatever else you
  might call them, you could never call them disloyal.</p>

  <p>The boundary of Society was admittedly very close to Coote and Kipps, and
  a leading solicitude of the true gentleman was to detect clearly those
  'beneath' him, and to behave towards them in a proper spirit. 'It's jest
  there it's so 'ard for me.' said Kipps. He had to cultivate a certain
  'distance,' to acquire altogether the art of checking the presumption of
  bounders and old friends. It was difficult, Coote admitted.</p>

  <p>'I got mixed up with this lot 'ere,' said Kipps. 'That's what's so
  harkward&mdash;I mean awkward.'</p>

  <p>'You could give them a hint,' said Coote.</p>

  <p>'Ow?'</p>

  <p>'Oh&mdash;the occasion will suggest something.'</p>

  <p>The occasion came one early-closing night, when Kipps was sitting in a
  canopy chair near the bandstand with his summer overcoat fully open, and a
  new Gibus pulled slightly forward over his brow, waiting for Coote. They were
  to hear the band for an hour, and then go down to assist Miss Coote and the
  freckled girl in trying over some Beethoven duets, if they remembered them,
  that is, sufficiently well. And as Kipps lounged back in his chair and
  occupied his mind with his favourite amusement on such evenings, which
  consisted chiefly in supposing that every one about him was wondering who he
  was, came a rude rap at the canvas back and the voice of Pearce...</p>

  <p>'It's nice to be a gentleman,' said Pearce, and swung a penny chair into
  position, while Buggins appeared smiling agreeably on the other side, and
  leant upon his stick. He was smoking a common briar pipe!</p>

  <p>Two real ladies, very fashionably dressed, and sitting close at hand,
  glanced quickly at Pearce, and then away again, and it was evident their
  wonder was at an end.</p>

  <p>'He's all right,' said Buggins, removing his pipe and surveying Kipps.</p>

  <p>"Ello, Buggins!' said Kipps, not too cordially. "Ow goes it?'</p>

  <p>'All right. Holidays next week. If you don't look out, Kipps, I shall be
  on the Continong before you. Eh?'</p>

  <p>'You going t' Boologne?'</p>

  <p>'Ra-ther. Parley vous Francey. You bet.'</p>

  <p>'I shall 'ave a bit of a run over there one of these days,' said
  Kipps.</p>

  <p>There came a pause. Pearce applied the top of his stick to his mouth for a
  space and regarded Kipps. Then he glanced at the people about them.</p>

  <p>'I say, Kipps,' he said in a distinct loud voice, 'see 'er Ladyship
  lately?'</p>

  <p>Kipps perceived the audience was to impressed, but he responded half-
  heartedly. 'No, I 'aven't,' he said.</p>

  <p>'She was along of Sir William the other night,' said Pearce, still loud
  and clear, 'and she asked to be remembered to you.' It seemed to Kipps that
  one of the two ladies smiled faintly, and said something to the other, and
  then certainly they glanced at Pearce. Kipps flushed scarlet. 'Did she?' he
  answered. Buggins laughed good-humouredly over his pipe. 'Sir William suffers
  a lot from his gout,' Pearce continued unabashed.</p>

  <p>(Buggins much amused with his pipe between his teeth.) Kipps became aware
  of Coote at hand. Coote nodded rather distantly to Pearce. 'Hope I haven't
  kept you waiting, Kipps,' he said.</p>

  <p>'I kep' a chair for you,' said Kipps, and removed a guardian foot.</p>

  <p>'But you've got your friends,' said Coote. 'Oh, we don't mind,' said
  Pearce cordially 'the more the merrier'; and, 'Why don't you get a chair,
  Buggins?' Buggins shook his head in a sort of aside to Pearce, and Coote
  coughed behind his hand.</p>

  <p>'Been kep' late at business?' asked Pearce. Coote turned quite pale, and
  pretended not to hear. His eyes sought in space for a time, and with a
  convulsive movement he recognised a distant acquaintance and raised his hat.
  Pearce had also become a little pale. He addressed himself to Kipps in an
  undertone.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Coote, isn't he?' he asked.</p>

  <p>Coote addressed himself to Kipps directly and exclusively. His manner had
  the calm of extreme tension. 'I'm rather late,' he said. 'I think we ought
  almost to be going on now.'</p>

  <p>Kipps stood up. 'That's all right,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Which way are you going?' said Pearce, standing also, and brushing some
  crumbs of cigarette ash from his sleeve.</p>

  <p>For a moment Coote was breathless. 'Thank you,' he said, and gasped. Then
  he delivered the necessary blow, 'I don't think we're in need of your
  society, you know,' and turned away.</p>

  <p>Kipps found himself falling over chairs and things in the wake of Coote,
  and then they were clear of the crowd.</p>

  <p>For a space Coote said nothing; then he remarked abruptly, and quite
  angrily for him, 'I think that was awful Cheek!'</p>

  <p>Kipps made no reply...</p>

  <p>The whole thing was an interesting little object-lesson in 'distance,' and
  it stuck in the front of Kipps' mind for a long time. He had particularly
  vivid the face of Pearce with an expression between astonishment and
  anger.</p>

  <p>He felt as though he had struck Pearce in the face under circumstances
  that gave Pearce no power to reply. He did not attend very much to the duets,
  and even forget at the end of one of them to say how perfectly lovely it
  was.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">But you must not imagine that the national ideal of a
gentleman, as Coote
  developed it, was all a matter of deportment and selectness, a mere isolation
  from debasing associations. There is a Serious Side, a deeper aspect of the
  true Gentleman. But it is not vocal. The True Gentleman does not wear his
  heart on his sleeve. For example, he is deeply religious, as Coote was, as
  Mrs. Walshingham was; but outside the walls of a church it never appears,
  except perhaps now and then in a pause, in a profound look, in a sudden
  avoidance. In quite a little while Kipps also had learnt the pause, the
  profound look, the sudden avoidance, that final refinement of spirituality,
  impressionistic piety.</p>

  <p>And the True Gentleman is patriotic also. When one saw Coote lifting his
  hat to the National Anthem, then perhaps one got a glimpse of what patriotic
  emotions, what worship, the polish of a gentleman may hide. Or singing out
  his deep notes against the Hosts of Midian, in St. Stylites' choir; then
  indeed you plumbed his spiritual side.</p>

  <p>'Christian, dost thou heed them On the holy ground,</p>

  <p>How the hosts of Mid-i-an</p>

  <p>Prowl and prowl around?</p>

  <p>Christian, up and smai-it them...</p>

  <p>But these were but gleams. For the rest, Religion, Nationality, Passion,
  Finance, Politics, much more so those cardinal issues Birth and Death, the
  True Gentleman skirted about, and became facially rigid towards, and ceased
  to speak, and panted and blew.</p>

  <p>'One doesn't talk of that sort of thing,' Coote would say, with a gesture
  of the knuckly hand. 'O' course,' Kipps would reply, with an equal
  significance.</p>

  <p>Profundities. Deep, as it were, blowing to deep.</p>

  <p>One does not talk, but on the other hand one is punctilious to do. Action
  speaks. Kipps&mdash;in spite of the fact that the Walshinghams were more than
  a little lax&mdash;Kipps, who had formerly flitted Sunday after Sunday from
  one Folkestone church to another, had now a sitting of his own, paid for
  duly, at Saint Stylites. There he was to be seen, always at the surplice
  evening service, and sometimes of a morning, dressed with a sober precision,
  and with an eye on Coote in the chancel. No difficulties now about finding
  the place in his book. He became a communicant again&mdash;he had lapsed soon
  after his confirmation when the young lady in the costume-room who was his
  adopted sister left the Emporium&mdash;and he would sometimes go round to the
  Vestry for Coote, after the service. One evening he was introduced to the
  Hon. and Rev. Densmore, He was much too confused to say anything, and the
  noble cleric had nothing to say, but they were introduced...</p>

  <p>No! You must not imagine that the national ideal of a gentleman is without
  its 'serious side,' without even its stern and uncompromising side. The
  imagination, no doubt, refuses to see Coote displaying extraordinary
  refinements of courage upon the stricken field, but in the walks of peace
  there is sometimes sore need of sternness. Charitable as one may be, one must
  admit there are people who do things&mdash;impossible things; people who
  place themselves 'out of it' in countless ways; people, moreover, who are by
  a sort of predestination out of it from the beginning; and against these
  Society has invented a terrible protection for its Cootery&mdash;the Cut. The
  cut is no joke for any one. It is excommunication. You may be cut by an
  individual, you may be cut by a set, or you may be&mdash;and this is so
  tragic that beautiful romances have been written about it&mdash;'Cut by the
  Country.' One figures Coote discharging this last duty and cutting somebody
  .&mdash;Coote, erect and pale, never speaking, going past with eyes of
  pitiless slate, lower jaw protruding a little, face pursed up and cold and
  stiff...</p>

  <p>It never dawned upon Kipps that he could one day have to face this
  terrible front, to be to Coote not only as one dead, but as one gone more
  than a stage or so in decay, cut and passed, banned and outcast for ever. It
  never dawned upon either of them.</p>

  <p>Yet so it was to be!</p>

  <p>One cannot hide any longer that all this fine progress of Kipps is doomed
  to end in collapse. So far, indeed, you have seen him ascend. You have seen
  him becoming more refined and careful day by day, more carefully dressed,
  less clumsy in the uses of social life. You have seen the gulf widening
  between himself and his former low associates. I have brought you at last to
  the vision of him, faultlessly dressed and posed, in an atmosphere of
  candlelight and chanting, in his own sitting, his own sitting! in one of the
  most fashionable churches in Folkestone...I have refrained from the lightest
  touch upon the tragic note that must now creep into my tale. Yet the net of
  his low connections has been about his feet, and, moreover, there was
  something interwoven in his being...</p>

<a id="chap26"
     name="chap26"></a>VI. &mdash; DISCORDS</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">One day Kipps set out upon his newly mastered bicycle to
New Romney, to
  break the news of his engagement to his uncle and aunt&mdash;positively. He
  was now a finished cyclist, but as yet an unseasoned one; the south-west
  wind, even in its summer guise, as one meets it in the Marsh, is the
  equivalent of a reasonable hill, and ever and again he got off and refreshed
  himself by a spell of walking. He was walking just outside New Romney
  preparatory to his triumphal entry (one hand off), when abruptly he came upon
  Ann Pornick.</p>

  <p>It chanced he was thinking about her at the time. He had been thinking
  curious things; whether, after all, the atmosphere of New Romney and the
  Marsh had not some difference, some faint impalpable quality that was missing
  in the great and fashionable world of Folkestone behind there on the hill.
  Here there was a homeliness, a familiarity. He had noted as he passed that
  old Mr. Clifferdown's gate had been mended with a fresh piece of string. In
  Folkestone he didn't take notice, and he didn't care if they built three
  hundred houses. Come to think of it, that was odd. It was fine and grand to
  have twelve hundred a year; it was fine to go about on trams and omnibuses
  and think not a person on board was as rich as oneself; it was fine to buy
  and order this and that and never have any work to do, and to be engaged to a
  girl distantly related to the Earl of Beaupr&Uacute;s; but yet there had been
  a zest in the old time out here, a rare zest in the holidays, in sunlight, on
  the sea beach, and in the High Street, that failed from these new things. He
  thought of those bright windows of holiday that had seemed so glorious to him
  in the retrospect from his apprentice days. It was strange that now, amidst
  his present splendours, they were glorious still!</p>

  <p>All those things were over now&mdash;perhaps that was it! Something had
  happened to the world, and the old light had been turned out. He himself was
  changed, and Sid was changed, terribly changed, and Ann, no doubt, was
  changed.</p>

  <p>He thought of her with the hair blown about her flushed cheeks as they
  stood together after their race...</p>

  <p>Certainly she must be changed, and all the magic she had been fraught with
  to the very hem of her short petticoats gone, no doubt, for ever. And as he
  thought that, or before and while he thought it&mdash;for he came to all
  these things in his own vague and stumbling way&mdash;he looked up, and there
  was Ann!</p>

  <p>She was seven years older, and greatly altered; yet for the moment it
  seemed to him that she had not changed at all. 'Ann!' he said; and she, with
  a lifting note, 'It's Art Kipps!'</p>

  <p>Then he became aware of changes&mdash;improvements. She was as pretty as
  she had promised to be, her blue eyes as dark as his memory of them, and with
  a quick, high colour; but now Kipps by several inches was the taller again.
  She was dressed in a simple gray dress, that showed her very clearly as a
  straight and healthy little woman, and her hat was Sunday-fied, with pink
  flowers. She looked soft and warm and welcoming. Her face was alight to Kipps
  with her artless gladness at their encounter.</p>

  <p>'It's Art Kipps!' she said. 'Rather' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'You got your holidays?'</p>

  <p>It flashed upon Kipps that Sid had not told her of his great fortune. Much
  regretful meditation upon Sid's behaviour had convinced him that he himself
  was to blame for exasperating boastfulness in that affair, and this time he
  took care not to err in that direction. So he erred in the other.</p>

  <p>'I'm taking a bit of a 'oliday,' he said.</p>

  <p>'So'm I,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'You been for a walk?' asked Kipps.</p>

  <p>Ann showed him a bunch of wayside flowers.</p>

  <p>'It's a long time since I seen you, Ann. Why, 'ow long must it be?
  Seven&mdash;eight years nearly.'</p>

  <p>'It don't do to count,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'It don't look like it,' said Kipps, with the slightest emphasis.</p>

  <p>'You got a moustache,' said Ann, smelling her flowers and looking at him
  over them, not without admiration. Kipps blushed&mdash;</p>

  <p>Presently they came to the bifurcation of the roads.</p>

  <p>'I'm going down this way to mother's cottage,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'I'll come a bit your way, if I may.'</p>

  <p>In New Romney social distinctions that are primary realities in Folkestone
  are absolutely non-existent, and it seemed quite permissible for him to walk
  with Ann, for all that she was no more than a servant. They talked with
  remarkable ease to one another, they slipped into a vein of intimate
  reminiscence in the easiest manner. In a little while Kipps was amazed to
  find Ann and himself at this,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'You r'member that half-sixpence? What we cut togevver?'</p>

  <p>'Yes?'</p>

  <p>'I got it still.'</p>

  <p>She hesitated. 'Funny, wasn't it?' she said, and then, 'You got yours,
  Artie?'</p>

  <p>'Rather,' said Kipps. 'What do you think?' and wondered in his heart of
  hearts why he had never looked at that sixpence for so long.</p>

  <p>Ann smiled at him frankly.</p>

  <p>'I didn't expect you'd keep it,' she said. 'I thought often&mdash;it was
  silly to keep mine. 'Besides,' she reflected, 'it didn't mean anything
  really.'</p>

  <p>She glanced at him as she spoke and met his eye.</p>

  <p>'Oh, didn't it! said Kipps, a little late with his response, and realising
  his infidelity to Helen even as he spoke. 'It didn't mean much anyhow,' said
  Ann. 'You still in the drapery?'</p>

  <p>'I'm living at Folkestone,' began Kipps, and decided that that sufficed.
  'Didn't Sid tell you he met me?'</p>

  <p>'No! Here?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. The other day. 'Bout a week or more ago.'</p>

  <p>'That was before I came.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, that was it,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'E's got on,' said Ann. 'Got 'is own shop now, Artie.'</p>

  <p>"E tole me.'</p>

  <p>They found themselves outside Muggett's cottages. 'You're going in?' said
  Kipps.</p>

  <p>'I s'pose so,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>They both hung upon the pause. Ann took a plunge. 'D'you often come to New
  Romney?' she asked. 'I ride over a bit at times,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>Another pause. Ann held out her hand.</p>

  <p>'I'm glad I seen you,' she said.</p>

  <p>Extraordinary impulses arose in neglected parts of Kipps' being. 'Ann,' he
  said, and stopped.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said she, and was bright to him.</p>

  <p>They looked at one another.</p>

  <p>All, and more than all, of those first emotions of his adolescence had
  come back to him. Her presence banished a multitude of countervailing
  considerations. It was Ann more than ever. She stood breathing close to him
  with her soft-looking lips a little apart and gladness in her eyes.</p>

  <p>'I'm awful glad to see you again,' he said; 'it brings back old
  times.'</p>

  <p>'Doesn't it?'</p>

  <p>Another pause. He would have liked to have had a long talk to her, to have
  gone for a walk with her or something, to have drawn nearer to her in any
  conceivable way, and above all to have had some more of the appreciation that
  shone in her eyes, but a vestige of Folkestone, still clinging to him, told
  him it 'wouldn't do.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' he said, 'I must be getting on,' and turned away reluctantly, with
  a will under compulsion&mdash;</p>

  <p>When he looked back from the corner she was still at the gate. She was
  perhaps a little disconcerted by his retreat. He felt that. He hesitated for
  a moment, half turned, stood, and suddenly did great things with his hat.
  That hat! The wonderful hat of our civilisation!...</p>

  <p>In another minute he was engaged in a singularly absent-minded
  conversation with his uncle about the usual topics.</p>

  <p>His uncle was very anxious to buy him a few upright clocks as an
  investment for subsequent sale. And there were also some very nice globes,
  one terrestrial and the other celestial, in a shop at Lydd that would look
  well in a drawing-room, and inevitably increase in value...Kipps either did
  or did not agree to this purchase, he was unable to recollect.</p>

  <p>The south-west wind perhaps helped him back; at any rate he found himself
  through Dymchurch without having noticed the place. There came an odd effect
  as he drew near Hythe. The hills on the left and the trees on the right
  seemed to draw together and close in upon him until his way was straight and
  narrow. He could not turn round on that treacherous half-tamed machine, but
  he knew that behind him, he knew so well, spread the wide vast flatness of
  the Marsh shining under the afternoon sky. In some way this was material to
  his thoughts. And as he rode through Hythe, he came upon the idea that there
  was a considerable amount of incompatibility between the existence of one who
  was practically a gentleman and of Ann.</p>

  <p>In the neighbourhood of Seabrook he began to think he had, in some subtle
  way, lowered himself by walking along by the side of Ann...After all, she was
  only a servant.</p>

  <p>Ann!</p>

  <p>She called out all the least gentlemanly instincts of his nature. There
  had been a moment in their conversation when he had quite distinctly thought
  it would really be an extremely nice thing for some one to kiss her
  lips...There was something warming about Ann&mdash;at least for Kipps. She
  impressed him as having, somewhen during their vast interval of separation,
  contrived to make herself in some distinctive way his.</p>

  <p>Fancy keeping that half-sixpence all this time!</p>

  <p>It was the most flattering thing that ever happened to Kipps.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">He found himself presently sitting over The Art of
Conversing, lost in the
  strangest musings. He got up, walked about, became stagnant at the window for
  a space, roused himself, and by way of something lighter, tried Sesame and
  Lilies. From that, too, his attention wandered. He sat back. Anon he smiled,
  anon sighed. He arose, pulled his keys from his pocket, looked at them,
  decided, and went upstairs. He opened the little yellow box that had been the
  nucleus of all his possessions in the world, and took out a small Escritoire,
  the very humblest sort of present, and opened it&mdash;kneeling. And there in
  the corner was a little packet of paper, sealed as a last defence against any
  prying invader with red sealing-wax. It had gone untouched for years. He held
  this little packet between finger and thumb for a moment, regarding it, and
  then put down the escritoire and broke the seal&mdash;</p>

  <p>As he was getting into bed that night he remembered something for the
  first time! 'Dash it!' he said. 'Deshed if I told 'em this time...Well!</p>

  <p>'I shall 'ave to go over to New Romney again!'</p>

  <p>He got into bed, and remained sitting pensively on the pillow for a
  space.</p>

  <p>'Rum world,' he reflected, after a vast interval.</p>

  <p>Then he recalled that she had noticed his moustache. He embarked upon a
  sea of egotistical musing. He imagined himself telling Ann how rich he was.
  What a surprise that would be for her!</p>

  <p>Finally he sighed profoundly, blew out his candle, and snuggled down, and
  in a little while he was asleep...</p>

  <p>But the next morning and at intervals afterwards, he found himself
  thinking of Ann&mdash;Ann the bright, the desirable, the welcoming, and with
  an extra-ordinary streakiness he wanted quite badly to go, and then as badly
  not to go, over to New Romney again.</p>

  <p>Sitting on the Leas in the afternoon, he had an idea. 'I ought to 'ave
  told 'er, I suppose, about my being engaged.'</p>

  <p>'Ann!'</p>

  <p>All sorts of dreams and impressions that had gone clean out of his mental
  existence came back to him, changed and brought up to date to fit her altered
  presence. He thought of how he had gone back to New Romney for his Christmas
  holidays, determined to kiss her, and of the awful blankness of the discovery
  that she had gone away.</p>

  <p>It seemed incredible now, and yet not wholly incredible, that he had cried
  real tears for her&mdash;how many years was it ago?</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Daily I should thank my Maker that He did not delegate to
me the
  Censorship of the world of men. I should temper a fierce injustice with a
  spasmodic indecision, that would prolong rather than mitigate the bitterness
  of the Day. For human dignity, for all conscious human superiority I should
  lack the beginnings of charity; for bishops, prosperous schoolmasters,
  judges, and all large respect-pampered souls. And more especially bishops,
  towards whom I bear an atavistic Viking grudge, dreaming not infrequently and
  with invariable zest of galleys and landings, and well-known living ornaments
  of the episcopal bench sprinting inland on twinkling gaiters before my
  thirsty blade&mdash;all these people, I say, I should treat below their
  deserts; but, on the other hand, for such as Kipps&mdash;</p>

  <p>There the exasperating indecisions would come in. The Judgment would be
  arrested at Kipps. Every one and everything would wait. The balance would
  sway and sway, and whenever it heeled towards an adverse decision, my finger
  would set it swaying again. Kings; warriors, statesmen, brilliant women,
  'personalities' panting with indignation, headline humanity in general would
  stand undamned, unheeded, or be damned in the most casual manner for their
  importunity, while my eye went about for anything possible that could be said
  on behalf of Kipps...Albeit I fear nothing can save him from condemnation
  upon this present score, that within two days he was talking to Ann
  again.</p>

  <p>One seeks excuses. Overnight there had been an encounter of Chitterlow and
  young Walshingham in his presence that had certainly warped his standards.
  They had called within a few minutes of each other, and the two, swayed by
  virile attentions to Old Methuselah Three Stars, had talked against each
  other, over and at the hospitable presence of Kipps. Walshingham had seemed
  to win at the beginning, but finally Chitterlow had made a magnificent
  display of vociferation and swept him out of existence. At the beginning
  Chitterlow had opened upon the great profits of playwrights, and young
  Walshingham had capped him at once with a cynical but impressive display of
  knowledge of the High Finance. If Chitterlow boasted his thousands, young
  Walshingham boasted his hundreds of thousands, and was for a space left in
  sole possession of the stage, juggling with the wealth of nations. He was
  going on by way of Financial Politics to the Overman, before Chitterlow
  recovered from his first check, and came back to victory. 'Talking of women,'
  said Chitterlow, coming in abruptly upon some things not generally known,
  beyond Walshingham's more immediate circle, about a recently departed
  Empire-builder; 'Talking of Women and the way they Get at a man&mdash;'</p>

  <p>(Though, as a matter of fact, they had been talking of the Corruption of
  Society by Speculation.)</p>

  <p>Upon this new topic Chitterlow was soon manifestly invincible. He knew so
  much, he had know so many. Young Walshingham did his best with epigrams and
  reservations, but even to Kipps it was evident that his was a book-learned
  depravity. One felt Walshingham had never known the inner realities of
  passion. But Chitterlow convinced and amazed. He had run away with girls, he
  had been run away with by girls, he had been in love with several at a
  time&mdash;'not counting Bessie'&mdash;he had loved and lost, he had loved
  and refrained, and he had loved and failed. He threw remarkable lights upon
  the moral state of America&mdash;in which country he had toured with great
  success. He set his talk to the tune of one of Mr. Kipling's best-known
  songs. He told an incident of simple romantic passion, a delirious dream of
  love and beauty in a Saturday to Monday steamboat trip up the Hudson, and
  tagged his end with 'I learn about women from 'er!' After that he adopted the
  refrain, and then lapsed into the praises of Kipling. 'Little Kipling,' said
  Chitterlow, with the familiarity of affection, 'he knows,' and broke into
  quotation:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'I've taken my fun where I've found it;</p>

  <p>I've rogued and I've ranged in my time; I've 'ad my picking of
  sweet'earts, An' four of the lot was Prime.' (These things, I say, affect the
  moral standards of the best of us.)</p>

  <p>'I'd have liked to have written that,' said Chitterlow. 'That's Life, that
  is! But go and put it on the Stage, put even a bit of the Realities of Life
  on the Stage and see what they'll do to you! Only Kipling could venture on a
  job like that. That Poem KNOCKED me! I won't say Kipling hasn't knocked me
  before and since, but that was a Fair Knock Out. And yet&mdash;you
  know&mdash;there's one thing in it...this,&mdash;'</p>

  <p>I've taken my fun where I've found it.</p>

  <p>And now I must pay for my fun, For the more you 'ave known o' the others
  The less will you settle to one.</p>

  <p>Well. In my case anyhow&mdash;I don't know how much that proves, seeing
  I'm exceptional in so many things and there's no good denying it&mdash;but so
  far as I'm concerned&mdash;I tell you two, but, of course, you needn't let it
  go any farther&mdash;I've been perfectly faithful to Muriel ever since I
  married her&mdash;ever since...Not once. Not even by accident have I ever
  said or done anything in the slightest&mdash;' His little brown eye became
  pensive after this flattering intimacy, and the gorgeous draperies of his
  abundant voice fell into graver folds. 'I learnt about women from 'er,' he
  said impressively.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Walshingham, getting into the hinder spaces of that splendid
  pause, 'a man must know about women. And the only sound way of learning is
  the experimental method.'</p>

  <p>'If you want to know about the experimental method, my boy,' said
  Chitterlow, resuming...</p>

  <p>So they talked. Ex pede Herculem, as Coote, that cultivated polyglot,
  would have put it. And in the small hours Kipps went to bed, with his brain
  whirling with words and whisky, and sat for an unconscionable time upon his
  bed edge, musing sadly upon the unmanly monogamy that had cast its shadow
  upon his career, musing with his thoughts pointing round more and more
  certainly to the possibility of at least duplicity with Ann.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">For some days he had been refraining with some insistence
from going off
  to New Romney again...</p>

  <p>I do not know if this may count in palliation of his misconduct. Men, real
  Strong-Souled, Healthy Men, should be, I suppose, impervious to
  conversational atmospheres, but I have never claimed for Kipps a place at
  these high levels. The fact remains, that next day he spent the afternoon
  with Ann, and found no scruple in displaying himself a budding lover.</p>

  <p>He had met her in the High Street, had stopped her, and almost on the spur
  of the moment had boldly proposed a walk, 'for the sake of old times.'</p>

  <p>'I don't mind,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>Her consent almost frightened Kipps. His imagination had not carried him
  to that. 'It would be a lark,' said Kipps, and looked up the street and down,
  'Now,' he said.</p>

  <p>'I don't mind a bit, Artie. I was just going for a walk along towards St.
  Mary's.'</p>

  <p>'Let's go that way, be'ind the church,' said Kipps; and presently they
  found themselves drifting seaward in a mood of pleasant commonplace. For a
  while they talked of Sid. It went clean out of Kipps' head, at that early
  stage even, that Ann was a 'girl' according to the exposition of Chitterlow,
  and for a time he remembered only that she was Ann. But afterwards, with the
  reek of that talk in his head, he lapsed a little from that personal
  relation. They came out upon the beach and sat down in a tumbled pebbly place
  where a meagre grass and patches of sea poppy were growing, and Kipps
  reclined on his elbow and tossed pebbles in his hand, and Ann sat up, sunlit,
  regarding him. They talked in fragments. They exhausted Sid, they exhausted
  Ann, and Kipps was chary of his riches.</p>

  <p>He declined to a faint lovemaking. 'I got that 'arf-sixpence still,' he
  said.</p>

  <p>'Reely?'</p>

  <p>That changed the key. 'I always kept mine, some'ow,' said Ann; and there
  was a pause.</p>

  <p>They spoke of how often they had thought of each other during those
  intervening years. Kipps may have been untruthful, but Ann, perhaps, was not.
  'I met people here and there,' said Ann; 'but I never met any one quite like
  you, Artie.'</p>

  <p>'It's jolly our meeting again, anyhow,' said Kipps. 'Look at that ship out
  there. She's pretty close in&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He had a dull period, became, indeed, almost pensive, and then he was
  enterprising for a while. He tossed up his pebbles so that, as if by
  accident, they fell on Ann's hand. Then, very penitently, he stroked the
  place. That would have led to all sorts of coquetries on the part of Flo
  Bates, for example, but it disconcerted and checked Kipps to find Ann made no
  objection, smiled pleasantly down on him, with eyes half shut because of the
  sun. She was taking things very much for granted.</p>

  <p>He began to talk, and Chitterlow standards resuming possession of him, he
  said he had never forgotten her. 'I never forgotten you either, Artie,' she
  said. 'Funny, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>It impressed Kipps also as funny.</p>

  <p>He became reminiscent, and suddenly a warm summer's evening came back to
  him. 'Remember them cockchafers, Ann?' he said. But the reality of the
  evening he recalled was not the chase of cockchafers. The great reality that
  had suddenly arisen between them was that he had never kissed Ann in his
  life. He looked up, and there were her lips.</p>

  <p>He wanted to very badly, and his memory leaped and annihilated an
  interval. That old resolution came back to him, and all sorts of new
  resolutions passed out of mind. And he had learnt something since those
  boyish days. This time he did not ask. He went on talking, his nerves began
  very faintly to quiver, and his mind grew bright.</p>

  <p>Presently, having satisfied himself that there was no one to see, he sat
  up beside her, and remarked upon the clearness of the air, and how close
  Dungeness seemed to them. Then they came upon a pause again.</p>

  <p>'Ann,' he whispered, and put an arm that quivered about her.</p>

  <p>She was mute and unresisting, and, as he was to remember, solemn.</p>

  <p>He turned her face towards him and kissed her lips, and she kissed him
  back again&mdash;kisses frank and tender as a child's.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">It was curious that in the retrospect he did not find
nearly the
  satisfaction in this infidelity he had imagined was there. It was no doubt
  desperately doggish, doggish to an almost Chitterlowesque degree, to recline
  on the beach at Littlestone with a 'girl,' to make love to her and to achieve
  the triumph of her kissing when he was engaged to another 'girl' at
  Folkestone; but somehow these two people were not 'girls,' they were Ann and
  Helen. Particularly Helen declined to be considered as a 'girl.' And there
  was something in Ann's quietly friendly eyes, in her frank smile, in the
  naive pressure of her hand, there was something undefended and welcoming that
  imparted a flavour to the business upon which he had not counted. He had
  learnt about women from her. That refrain ran through his mind and deflected
  his thoughts, but, as a matter of fact, he had learnt about nothing but
  himself.</p>

  <p>He wanted very much to see Ann some more and explain&mdash;He did not
  clearly know what it was he wanted to explain.</p>

  <p>He did not clearly know anything. It is the last achievement of the
  intelligence to get all of one's life into one coherent scheme, and Kipps was
  only in a measure more aware of himself as a whole than is a tree. His
  existence was an affair of dissolving and recurring moods. When he thought of
  Helen or Ann, or any of his friends, he thought sometimes of this aspect and
  sometimes of that&mdash;and often one aspect was finally incongruous with
  another. He loved Helen, he revered Helen. He was also beginning to hate her
  with some intensity. When he thought of that expedition to Lympne, profound,
  vague, beautiful emotions flooded his being; when he thought of paying calls
  with her perforce, or of her latest comment on his bearing, he found himself
  rebelliously composing fierce and pungent insults, couched in the vernacular.
  But Ann, whom he had seen so much less of, was a simpler memory. She was
  pretty, she was almost softly feminine, and she was possible to his
  imagination just exactly where Helen was impossible. More than anything else,
  she carried the charm of respect for him, the slightest glance of her eyes
  was balm for his perpetually wounded self-conceit.</p>

  <p>Chance suggestions it was set the tune of his thoughts, and his state of
  health and repletion gave the colour. Yet somehow he had this at least almost
  clear in his mind, that to have gone to see Ann a second time, to have
  implied that she had been in possession of his thoughts through all this
  interval, and, above all, to have kissed her, was shabby and wrong. Only,
  unhappily, this much of lucidity had come now just a few hours after it was
  needed.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Four days after this it was that Kipps got up so late. He
got up late, cut
  his chin while shaving, kicked a slipper into his sponge bath, and said
  'Dash!'</p>

  <p>Perhaps you know those intolerable mornings, dear Reader, when you seem to
  have neither the heart nor the strength to rise, and your nervous adjustments
  are all wrong and your fingers thumbs, and you hate the very birds for
  singing. You feel inadequate to any demand whatever. Often such awakenings
  follow a poor night's rest and commonly they mean indiscriminate eating, or
  those subtle mental influences old Kipps ascribed to 'Foozle Ile' in the
  system, or worry. And with Kipps&mdash;albeit Chitterlow had again been his
  guest overnight&mdash;assuredly worry had played a leading role. Troubles had
  been gathering upon him for days, there had been a sort of concentration of
  these hosts of Midian overnight, and in the gray small hours Kipps had held
  his review. The predominating trouble marched under this banner&mdash;</p>

  <p>MR KIPPS.</p>

  <p>MRS BINDON BOTTING At Home, Thursday, September 16th. Anagrams, 4 to 6.30.
  R.S.V.P.</p>

  <p>a banner that was the facsimile of a card upon his looking-glass in the
  room below. And in relation to this terribly significant document, things had
  come to a pass with Helen, that he would only describe in his own expressive
  idiom as 'words.'</p>

  <p>It had long been a smouldering issue between them that Kipps was not
  availing himself with any energy or freedom of the opportunities he had of
  social exercises, much less was seeking additional opportunities. He had, it
  was evident, a peculiar dread of that universal afternoon enjoyment, the
  Call, and Helen made it unambiguously evident that this dread was 'silly' and
  had to be overcome. His first display of this unmanly weakness occurred at
  the Cootes on the day before he kissed Ann. They were all there, chatting
  very pleasantly, when the little servant with the big cap announced the
  younger Miss Wace.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Kipps manifested a lively horror and rose partially from his
  chair. "O Gum!' he protested. 'Carn't I go upstairs?'</p>

  <p>Then he sank back, for it was too late. Very probably the younger Miss
  Wace had heard him as she came in.</p>

  <p>Helen said nothing of that, though her manner may have shown her surprise,
  but afterwards she told Kipps he must get used to seeing people, and
  suggested that he should pay a series of calls with Mrs. Walshingham and
  herself. Kipps gave a reluctant assent at the time, and afterwards displayed
  a talent for evasion that she had not expected in him. At last she did
  succeed in securing him for a call upon Miss Punchafer of Radnor Park&mdash;a
  particularly easy call, because Miss Punchafer being so deaf, one could say
  practically what one liked&mdash;and then outside the gate he shirked again,
  'I can't go in' he said, in a faded voice.</p>

  <p>'You must,' said Helen, beautiful as ever, but even more than a little
  hard and forbidding.</p>

  <p>'I can't.'</p>

  <p>He produced his handkerchief hastily, thrust it to his face, and regarded
  her over it with rounded hostile eyes. 'Impossible,' he said in a hoarse,
  strange voice out of the handkerchief. 'Nozzez bleedin"...</p>

  <p>But that was the end of his power of resistance, and when the rally for
  the Anagram Tea occurred, she bore down his feeble protests altogether. She
  insisted. She said frankly, 'I am going to give you a good talking to about
  this'; and she did...</p>

  <p>From Coote he gathered something of the nature of Anagrams and Anagram
  parties. An anagram, Coote explained, was a word spelt the same way as
  another, only differently arranged; as, for instance, T.O.C.O.E. would be an
  anagram for his own name Coote.</p>

  <p>'T.O.C.O.E.,' repeated Kipps, very carefully.</p>

  <p>'Or T.O.E.C.O.,' said Coote.</p>

  <p>'Or T.O.E.C.O.,' said Kipps, assisting his poor head by nodding it at each
  letter. Toe Company, like,' he said in his efforts to comprehend.</p>

  <p>When Kipps was clear what an anagram meant Coote came to the second
  heading, the Tea. Kipps gathered there might be from thirty to sixty people
  present, and that each one would have an anagram pinned on. 'They give you a
  card to put your guesses on, rather like a dence programme, and then, you
  know, you go round and guess,' said Coote. 'It's rather good fun.'</p>

  <p>'Oo, rather!' said Kipps, with simulated gusto. 'It shakes everybody up
  together,' said Coote. Kipps smiled and nodded...</p>

  <p>In the small hours all his painful meditations were threaded by the vision
  of that Anagram Tea; it kept marching to and fro and in and out of his other
  troubles, from thirty to sixty people, mostly ladies and callers, and a great
  number of the letters of the alphabet, and more particularly P.I.K.P.S. and
  T.O.E.C.O., and he was trying to make one word out of the whole interminable
  procession...</p>

  <p>This word, as he finally gave it with some emphasis to the silence of the
  night, was, 'Demn!'</p>

  <p>Then wreathed as it were in this lettered procession was the figure of
  Helen as she had appeared at the moment of 'words'; her face a little hard, a
  little irritated, a little disappointed. He imagined himself going round and
  guessing under her eye...</p>

  <p>He tried to think of other things, without lapsing upon a still deeper
  uneasiness that was decorated with yellow sea-poppies, and the figures of
  Buggins, Pearce, and Carshot, three murdered friendships, rose reproachfully
  in the stillness and changed horrible apprehensions into unspeakable remorse.
  Last night had been their customary night for the banjo, and Kipps, with a
  certain tremulous uncertainty, had put Old Methuselah amidst a retinue of
  glasses on the table and opened a box of choice cigars. In vain. They were in
  no need, it seemed, of his society. But instead Chitterlow had come, anxious
  to know if it was all right about that syndicate plan. He had declined
  anything but a very weak whisky-and-soda, 'just to drink,' at least until
  business was settled, and had then opened the whole affair with an effect of
  great orderliness to Kipps. Soon he was taking another whisky by sheer
  inadvertency, and the complex fabric of his conversation was running more
  easily from the broad loom of his mind. Into that pattern had interwoven a
  narrative of extensive alterations in the Pestered Butterfly&mdash;the
  neck-and-beetle business was to be restored&mdash;the story of a grave
  difference of opinion with Mrs. Chitterlow, where and how to live after the
  play had succeeded, the reasons why the Hon. Thomas Norgate had never
  financed a syndicate, and much matter also about the syndicate now under
  discussion. But if the current of their conversation had been vortical and
  crowded, the outcome was perfectly clear. Kipps was to be the chief
  participator in the syndicate, and his contribution was to be two thousand
  pounds. Kipps groaned and rolled over, and found Helen again, as it were, on
  the other side. 'Promise me,' she had said, 'you won't do anything without
  consulting me.'</p>

  <p>Kipps at once rolled back to his former position, and for a space lay
  quite still. He felt like a very young rabbit in a trap.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, with extraordinary distinctness, his heart cried out for
  Ann, and he saw her as he had seen her at New Romney, sitting amidst the
  yellow sea-poppies with the sunlight on her face. His heart called out for
  her in the darkness as one calls for rescue. He knew, as though he had known
  it always, that he loved Helen no more. He wanted Ann, he wanted to hold her
  and be held by her, to kiss her again, to turn his back for ever on all these
  other things...</p>

  <p>He rose late, but this terrible discovery was still there, undispelled by
  cockcrow or the day. He rose in a shattered condition, and he cut himself
  while shaving, but at last he got into his dining-room, and could pull the
  bell for the hot constituents of his multifarious breakfast. And then he
  turned to his letters. There were two real letters in addition to the
  customary electric belt advertisement, continental lottery circular, and
  betting tout's card. One was in a slight mourning envelope, and addressed in
  an unfamiliar hand. This he opened first, and discovered a note.&mdash;</p>

  <p>MRS. RAYMOND WACE requests the pleasure of MR. KIPPS' Company at Dinner on
  Tuesday, Sept. 21st, at 8 o'clock R.S.V.P.</p>

  <p>With a hasty movement Kipps turned his mind to the second letter. It was
  an unusually long one from his uncle, and ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'MY DEAR NEPHEW,&mdash;We are considerably startled by your letter, though
  expecting something of the sort and disposed to hope for the best. If the
  young lady is a relation to the Earl of Beaupr&Uacute;s well and good but
  take care you are not being imposed upon for there are many who will be glad
  enough to snap you up now your circumstances are altered. I waited on the old
  Earl once while in service and he was remarkably close with his tips and
  suffered from corns. A hasty old gent and hard to please&mdash;I dare say he
  has forgotten me altogether&mdash;and anyhow there is no need to rake up
  bygones. To-morrow is bus day and as you say the young lady is living near by
  we shall shut up shop for there is really nothing doing now what with all the
  visitors bringing everything with them down to their very children's pails
  and say how-de do to her and give her a bit of a kiss and encouragement if we
  think her suitable&mdash;she will be pleased to see your old uncle. We wish
  we could have had a look at her first but still there is not much mischief
  done and hoping that all will turn out well yet I am&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Your affectionate Uncle, 'EDWARD GEORGE KIPPS.</p>

  <p>'My heartburn still very bad. I shall bring over a few bits of rhubarb I
  picked up, a sort you won't get in Folkestone and if possible a good bunch of
  flowers for the young lady.'</p>

  <p>'Comin' over to-day,' said Kipps, standing helplessly with the letter in
  his hand. "Ow the Juice&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'I carn't.'</p>

  <p>'Kiss 'er!'</p>

  <p>A terrible anticipation of that gathering framed itself in his mind, a
  hideous, impossible disaster.</p>

  <p>'I carn't even face 'er&mdash;!'</p>

  <p>His voice went up to a note of despair. 'And it's too late to telegrarf
  and stop 'em!'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">About twenty minutes after this, an out-porter in Castle
Hill Avenue was
  accosted by a young man with a pale, desperate face, an exquisitely rolled
  umbrella, and a heavy Gladstone bag.</p>

  <p>'Carry this to the station, will you?' said the young man. 'I want to
  ketch the nex' train to London...You'll 'ave to look sharp; I 'even't very
  much time.'</p>

  <h2>
<a id="chap27"
     name="chap27"></a>VII. &mdash; LONDON</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">London was Kipps' third world. There were, no doubt, other
worlds, but
  Kipps knew only these three: firstly, New Romney and the Emporium,
  constituting his primary world, his world of origin, which also contained
  Ann; secondly, the world of culture and refinement, the world of which Coote
  was chaperon, and into which Kipps was presently to marry, a world, it was
  fast becoming evident, absolutely incompatible with the first; and thirdly, a
  world still to a large extent unexplored, London. London presented itself as
  a place of great gray spaces and incredible multitudes of people, centring
  about Charing Cross station and the Royal Grand Hotel, and containing at
  unexpected arbitrary points shops of the most amazing sort, statuary,
  squares, restaurants&mdash;where it was possible for clever people like
  Walshingham to order a lunch item by item to the waiters' evident respect and
  sympathy&mdash;exhibitions of incredible things&mdash;the Walshinghams had
  taken him to the Arts and Crafts and to a Picture Gallery&mdash;and Theatres.
  London, moreover, is rendered habitable by hansom cabs. Young Walshingham was
  a natural cab-taker; he was an all-round, large-minded young man, and he had
  in the course of their two days' stay taken Kipps into no less than nine, so
  that Kipps was singularly not afraid of these vehicles. He knew that wherever
  you were, so soon as you were thoroughly lost, you said 'Hi!' to a cab, and
  then 'Royal Grand Hotel.' Day and night these trusty conveyances are
  returning the strayed Londoner back to his point of departure, and were it
  not for their activity, in a little while the whole population, so vast and
  incomprehensible is the intricate complexity of this great city, would be
  hopelessly lost for ever. At any rate, that is how the thing presented itself
  to Kipps, and I have heard much the same from visitors from America.</p>

  <p>His train was composed of corridor carriages, and he forgot his troubles
  for a time in the wonders of this modern substitute for railway compartments.
  He went from the non-smoking to the smoking carriage, and smoked a cigarette,
  and strayed from his second-class carriage to a first and back. But presently
  Black Care got aboard the train and came and sat beside him. The exhilaration
  of escape had evaporated now, and he was presented with a terrible picture of
  his aunt and uncle arriving at his lodgings and finding him fled. He had left
  a hasty message that he was called away suddenly on business, 'ver' important
  business,' and they were to be sumptuously entertained. His immediate motive
  had been his passionate dread of an encounter between these excellent but
  unrefined old people and the Walshinghams, but now that end was secured, he
  could see how thwarted and exasperated they would be.</p>

  <p>How to explain to them?</p>

  <p>He ought never to have written to tell them!</p>

  <p>He ought to have got married, and told them afterwards.</p>

  <p>He ought to have consulted Helen.</p>

  <p>'Promise me,' she had said.</p>

  <p>'Oh, desh!' said Kipps, and got up and walked back into the smoking car
  and began to consume cigarettes. Suppose after all, they found out the
  Walshinghams' address and went there!</p>

  <p>At Charing Cross, however, were distractions again. He took a cab in an
  entirely Walshingham manner, and was pleased to note the enhanced respect of
  the cabman when he mentioned the Royal Grand. He followed Walshingham's
  routine on their previous visit with perfect success. They were very nice in
  the office, and gave him an excellent room at fourteen shillings the
  night.</p>

  <p>He went up and spent a considerable time examining the furniture of his
  room, scrutinising himself in its various mirrors, and sitting on the edge of
  the bed whistling. It was a vast and splendid apartment, and cheap at
  fourteen shillings. But finding the figure of Ann inclined to resume
  possession of his mind, he roused himself and descended by the staircase,
  after a momentary hesitation before the lift. He had thought of lunch, but he
  drifted into the great drawing-room, and read a guide to the Hotels of Europe
  for a space, until a doubt whether he was entitled to use this palatial
  apartment without extra charge arose in his mind. He would have liked
  something to eat very much now, but his inbred terror of the table was
  strong. He did at last get by a porter in uniform towards the dining-room,
  but at the sight of a number of waiters and tables with remarkable
  complications of knives and glasses, terror seized him, and he backed out
  again with a mumbled remark to the waiter in the doorway about this not being
  the way.</p>

  <p>He hovered in the hall and lounge until he thought the presiding porter
  regarded him with suspicion, and then went up to his room again by the
  staircase, got his hat and umbrella, and struck out boldly across the
  courtyard. He would go to a restaurant instead.</p>

  <p>He had a moment of elation in the gateway. He felt all the Strand must
  notice him as he emerged through the great gate of the hotel. 'One of these
  here rich swells,' they would say. 'Don't they go it just!' A cabman touched
  his hat. 'No fear,' said Kipps pleasantly...</p>

  <p>Then he remembered he was hungry again.</p>

  <p>Yet he decided he was in no great hurry for lunch, in spite of an internal
  protest, and turned eastward along the Strand in a leisurely manner. He would
  find a place to suit him soon enough. He tried to remember the sort of things
  Walshingham had ordered. Before all things he didn't want to go into a place
  and look like a fool. Some of these places rook you dreadful, besides making
  fun of you. There was a place near Essex Street where there was a window
  brightly full of chops, tomatoes, and lettuce. He stopped at this and
  reflected for a time, and then it occurred to him that you were expected to
  buy these things raw and cook them at home. Anyhow, there was sufficient
  doubt in the matter to stop him. He drifted on to a neat window with
  champagne bottles, a dish of asparagus, and a framed menu of a two-shilling
  lunch. He was about to enter, when fortunately he perceived two waiters
  looking at him over the back screen of the window with a most ironical
  expression, and he sheered off at once. There was a wonderful smell of hot
  food half-way down Fleet Street, and a nice-looking tavern with several
  doors, but he could not decide which door. His nerve was going under the
  strain.</p>

  <p>He hesitated at Farringdon Street, and drifted up to St. Paul's and round
  the churchyard, full chiefly of dead bargains in the shop windows, to
  Cheapside. But now Kipps was getting demoralised, and each house of
  refreshment seemed to promise still more complicated obstacles to food. He
  didn't know how you went in, and what was the correct thing to do with your
  hat; he didn't know what you said to the waiter or what you called the
  different things: he was convinced absolutely he would 'fumble,' as Shalford
  would have said, and look like a fool. Somebody might laugh at him! The
  hungrier he got, the more unendurable was the thought that any one should
  laugh at him. For a time he considered an extraordinary expedient to account
  for his ignorance. He would go in and pretend to be a foreigner, and not know
  English. Then they might understand...Presently he had drifted into a part of
  London where there did not seem to be any refreshment places at all.</p>

  <p>'Oh, desh!' said Kipps, in a sort of agony of indecisiveness. 'The very
  nex' place I see, in I go.'</p>

  <p>The next place was a fried-fish shop in a little side street, where there
  were also sausages on a gas-lit grill.</p>

  <p>He would have gone in, but suddenly a new scruple came to him, that he was
  too well dressed for the company he could see dimly through the steam sitting
  at the counter and eating with a sort of nonchalant speed.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">He was half minded to resort to a hansom and brave the
terrors of the
  dining-room of the Royal Grand&mdash;they wouldn't know why he had gone out
  really&mdash;when the only person he knew in London appeared (as the only
  person one does know will do in London) and slapped him on the shoulder.
  Kipps was hovering at a window at a few yards from the fish shop pretending
  to examine some really strikingly cheap pink baby-linen, and trying to settle
  finally about those sausages. 'Hallo, Kipps!' cried Sid, 'spending the
  millions?'</p>

  <p>Kipps turned and was glad to perceive no lingering vestige of the chagrin
  that had been so painful at New Romney. Sid looked grave and important, and
  he wore a quite new silk hat that gave a commercial touch to a generally
  socialistic costume. For the moment the sight of Sid uplifted Kipps
  wonderfully. He saw him as a friend and helper, and only presently did it
  come clearly into his mind that this was the brother of Ann.</p>

  <p>He made amiable noises.</p>

  <p>'I've just been up this way,' Sid explained, 'buying a secondhand
  'namelling stove...I'm going to 'namel myself.'</p>

  <p>'Lor!' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Yes. Do me a lot of good. Let the customer choose his colour. See? What
  brings you up?' Kipps had a momentary vision of his foiled uncle and aunt.
  'Jest a bit of a change,' he said.</p>

  <p>Sid came to a swift decision. 'Come down to my little show. I got some one
  I'd like to see talking to you.' Even then Kipps did not think of Ann in this
  connection.</p>

  <p>'Well,' he said, trying to invent an excuse on the spur of the moment.
  'Fact is,' he explained, 'I was jest looking round to get a bit of
  lunch.'</p>

  <p>'Dinner we call it,' said Sid. 'But that's all right. You can't get
  anything to eat hereabout. If you're not too haughty to do a bit of slumming,
  there's some mutton spoiling for me now&mdash;'</p>

  <p>The word mutton affected Kipps greatly.</p>

  <p>'It won't take us 'arf an hour,' said Sid, and Kipps was carried.</p>

  <p>He discovered another means of London locomotion in the Underground
  Railway, and recovered his self-possession in that interest. 'You don't mind
  going third?' asked Sid; and Kipps said, 'Nort a bit of it.' They were silent
  in the train for a time, on account of strangers in the carriage, and then
  Sid began to explain who it was he wanted Kipps to meet. 'It's a chap named
  Masterman&mdash;do you no end of good.</p>

  <p>'He occupies our first-floor front room, you know. It isn't so much for
  gain I let as company. We don't want the whole 'ouse, that's one thing, and
  another is I knew the man before. Met him at our Sociological, and after a
  bit he said he wasn't comfortable where he was. That's how it came about.
  He's a first-class chap&mdash;first class. Science! You should see his
  books!</p>

  <p>'Properly he's a sort of journalist. He's written a lot of things, but
  he's been too ill lately to do very much. Poetry he's written, all sorts. He
  writes for the Commonweal sometimes, and sometimes he reviews books. 'E's got
  'eaps of books&mdash;'eaps. Besides selling a lot.</p>

  <p>'He knows a regular lot of people, and all sorts of things. He's been a
  dentist, and he's a qualified chemist, and I seen 'im often reading German
  and French. Taught 'imself. He was here&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Sid indicated South Kensington, which had come opportunely outside the
  carriage windows, with a nod of his head, '&mdash;three years. Studying
  science. But you'll see 'im. When he really gets to talking&mdash;he pours it
  out.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' said Kipps, nodding sympathetically, with his two hands on his
  umbrella knob.</p>

  <p>'He'll do big things some day,' said Sid. 'He's written a book on science
  already. Physiography, it's called. Elementary Physiography! Some day he'll
  write an advanced&mdash;when he gets time.'</p>

  <p>He let this soak into Kipps.</p>

  <p>'I can't introduce you to lords and swells,' he went on, 'but I can show
  you a Famous Man, that's going to be. I can do that.
  Leastways&mdash;Unless&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Sid hesitated.</p>

  <p>'He's got a frightful cough,' he said.</p>

  <p>'He won't care to talk to me,' weighed Kipps.</p>

  <p>'That's all right; he won't mind. He's fond of talking. He'd talk to any
  one,' said Sid reassuringly, and added a perplexing bit of Londonised
  Latin.</p>

  <p>'He doesn't pute anything, non alienum. You know.'</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Kipps intelligently, over his umbrella knob, though of
  course that was altogether untrue.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Kipps found Sid's shop a practical-looking establishment,
stocked with the
  most remarkable collection of bicycles and pieces of bicycle that he had ever
  beheld. 'My hiring stock,' said Sid, with a wave to this ironmongery; 'and
  there's the best machine at a democratic price in London, The Red Flag, built
  by me. See?'</p>

  <p>He indicated a graceful gray brown framework in the window. 'And there's
  my stock of accessories&mdash;store prices.</p>

  <p>'Go in for motors a bit,' added Sid.</p>

  <p>'Mutton?' said Kipps, not hearing him distinctly.</p>

  <p>'Motors, I said...'Owever, Mutton Department here;' and he opened a door
  that had a curtain-guarded window in its upper panel, to reveal a little room
  with red walls and green furniture, with a white-clothed table and the
  generous promise of a meal. 'Fanny!' he shouted. 'Here's Art Kipps.'</p>

  <p>A bright-eyed young woman of five or six-and-twenty in a pink print
  appeared, a little flushed from cooking, and wiped a hand on an apron and
  shook hands and smiled and said it would all be ready in a minute. She went
  on to say she had heard of Kipps and his luck, and meanwhile Sid vanished to
  draw the beer, and returned with two glasses for himself and Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Drink that,' said Sid; and Kipps felt all the better for it.</p>

  <p>'I give Mr. Masterman 'is upstairs a hour ago,' said Mrs. Sid. 'I didn't
  think 'e ought to wait.'</p>

  <p>A rapid succession of brisk movements on the part of every one and they
  were all four at dinner&mdash;the fourth person being Master Walt Whitman
  Pornick, a cheerful young gentleman of one and a half, who was given a spoon
  to hammer on the table with to keep him quiet, and who got 'Kipps' right at
  the first effort and kept it all through the meal, combining it first with
  this previous acquisition and then that. 'Peacock Kipps,' said Master Walt,
  at which there was great laughter, and also 'More Mutton Kipps.'</p>

  <p>'He's a regular oner,' said Mrs. Sid, 'for catching up words. You can't
  say a word but what 'e's on to it.'</p>

  <p>There were no serviettes and less ceremony, and Kipps thought he had never
  enjoyed a meal so much. Every one was a little excited by the meeting and
  chatting and disposed to laugh, and things went easily from the very
  beginning. If there was a pause, Master Walt filled it in. Mrs. Sid, who
  tempered her enormous admiration for Sid's intellect and his Socialism and
  his severe business methods by a motherly sense of her sex and seniority,
  spoke of them both as 'you boys,' and dilated&mdash;when she was not urging
  Kipps to have some more of this or that&mdash;on the disparity between
  herself and her husband.</p>

  <p>'Shouldn't ha' thought there was a year between you,' said Kipps; 'you
  seem jest a match.'</p>

  <p>'I'm his match anyhow,' said Mrs. Sid, and no epigram of young
  Walshingham's was ever better received. 'Match,' said young Walt, coming in
  on the tail of the joke and getting a round for himself.</p>

  <p>Any sense of superior fortune had long vanished from Kipps' mind, and he
  found himself looking at host and hostess with enormous respect. Really old
  Sid was a wonderful chap, here in his own house at two-and-twenty, carving
  his own mutton and lording it over wife and child. No legacies needed by him!
  And Mrs. Sid, so kind and bright and hearty! And the child, old Sid's child!
  Old Sid had jumped round a bit. It needed the sense of his fortune at the
  back of his mind to keep Kipps from feeling abject. He resolved he'd buy
  young Walt something tremendous in toys at the very first opportunity.</p>

  <p>'Drop more beer, Art?'</p>

  <p>'Right you are, old man.'</p>

  <p>'Cut Mr. Kipps a bit more bread, Sid.'</p>

  <p>'Can't I pass you a bit?'...</p>

  <p>Sid was all right, Sid was; there was no mistake about that.</p>

  <p>It was growing up in his mind that Sid was the brother of Ann, but he said
  nothing about her, for excellent reasons. After all, Sid's irritation at her
  name when they had met in New Romney seemed to show a certain separation.
  They didn't tell each other much...He didn't know how things might be between
  Ann and Mrs. Sid either.</p>

  <p>Still, for all that, Sid was Ann's brother.</p>

  <p>The furniture of the room did not assert itself very much above the
  cheerful business of the table, but Kipps was impressed with the idea that it
  was pretty. There was a dresser at the end with a number of gay plates and a
  mug or so, a Labour Day poster by Walter Crane on the wall, and through the
  glass and over the blind of the shop door one had a glimpse of the bright-
  colour advertisement cards of bicycle dealers, and a shelf-ful of boxes
  labelled The Paragon Bell, the Scarum Bell, and The Patent Omi!
  Horn&mdash;</p>

  <p>It seemed incredible that he had been in Folkestone that morning, that
  even now his aunt and uncle&mdash;! B-r-r-r. It didn't do to think of his
  Aunt and Uncle.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">When Sid repeated his invitation to come and see Masterman,
Kipps, now
  flushed with beer and Irish stew, said he didn't mind if he did, and after a
  preliminary shout from Sid that was answered by a voice and a cough, the two
  went upstairs.</p>

  <p>'Masterman's a rare one,' said Sid over his arm and in an undertone. 'You
  should hear him speak at a meeting...If he's in form, that is.'</p>

  <p>He rapped, and went into a large, untidy room.</p>

  <p>'This is Kipps,' he said. 'You know, the chap I told you of. With twelve
  'undred a year.'</p>

  <p>Masterman sat gnawing an empty pipe, and as close to the fire as though it
  was alight and the season midwinter. Kipps concentrated upon him for a space,
  and only later took in something of the frowsy furniture, the little bed half
  behind and evidently supposed to be wholly behind a careless screen, the
  spittoon by the fender, the remains of a dinner on the chest of drawers, and
  the scattered books and papers. Masterman's face showed him a man of forty or
  more, with curious hollows at the side of his forehead and about his eyes.
  His eyes were very bright, there was a spot of red in his cheeks, and the
  wiry black moustache under his short red nose had been trimmed with scissors
  into a sort of brush along his upper lip. His teeth were darkened ruins. His
  jacket collar was turned up about a knitted white neck-wrap, and his sleeves
  betrayed no cuffs. He did not rise to greet Kipps, but he held out a
  thin-wristed hand and pointed with the other to a bedroom arm-chair.</p>

  <p>'Glad to see you,' he said. 'Sit down and make yourself at home. Will you
  smoke?'</p>

  <p>Kipps said he would, and produced his store. He was about to take one, and
  then with a civil afterthought handed the packet first to Masterman and Sid.
  Masterman pretended surprise to find his pipe out before he took one. There
  was an interlude of matches. Sid pushed the end of the screen out of his way,
  sat down on the bed thus frankly admitted, and prepared, with a certain quiet
  satisfaction of manner, to witness Masterman's treatment of Kipps.</p>

  <p>'And how does it feel to have twelve hundred a year?' asked Masterman,
  holding his cigarette to his nose tip in a curious manner.</p>

  <p>'It's rum,' confided Kipps, after a reflective interval. 'It feels juiced
  rum.'</p>

  <p>'I've never felt it,' said Masterman.</p>

  <p>'It takes a bit of getting into,' said Kipps. 'I can tell you that.'
  Masterman smoked and regarded Kipps with curious eyes.</p>

  <p>'I expect it does,' he said presently.</p>

  <p>'And has it made you perfectly happy?' he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>'I couldn't 'ardly say that,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>Masterman smiled. 'No,' he said. 'Has it made you much happier?'</p>

  <p>'It did at first.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. But you got used to it. How long, for example, did the real
  delirious excitement last?'</p>

  <p>'Oo, that! Perhaps a week,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>Masterman nodded his head. 'That's what discourages me from amassing
  wealth,' he said to Sid. 'You adjust yourself. It doesn't last. I've always
  had an inkling of that, and it's interesting to get it confirmed. I shall go
  on sponging for a bit longer on you, I think.'</p>

  <p>'You don't,' said Sid. 'No fear.'</p>

  <p>'Twenty-four thousand pounds,' said Masterman, and blew a cloud of smoke.
  'Lord! Doesn't it worry you?'</p>

  <p>'It is a bit worrying at times...Things 'appen.'</p>

  <p>'Going to marry?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'H'm. Lady, I guess, of a superior social position?'</p>

  <p>'Rather,' said Kipps. 'Cousin to the Earl of Beaupr&Uacute;s.'</p>

  <p>Masterman readjusted his long body with an air of having accumulated all
  the facts he needed. He snuggled his shoulder-blades down into the chair and
  raised his angular knees. 'I doubt,' he said, flicking cigarette ash into the
  atmosphere, 'if any great gain or loss of money does&mdash;as things are at
  present&mdash;make more than the slightest difference in one's happiness. It
  ought to&mdash;if money was what it ought to be, the token given for service,
  one ought to get an increase in power and happiness for every pound one got.
  But the plain fact is, the times are out of joint, and money&mdash;money,
  like everything else&mdash;is a deception and a disappointment.'</p>

  <p>He turned his face to Kipps and enforced his next words with the index
  finger of his lean lank hand. 'If I thought other wise,' he said, 'I should
  exert myself to get some. But&mdash;if one sees things clearly one is so
  discouraged. So confoundedly discouraged...When you first got your money you
  thought that it meant you might buy just anything you fancied?'</p>

  <p>'It was a bit that way,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'And you found you couldn't. You found that for all sorts of things it was
  a question of where to buy and how to buy, and what you didn't know how to
  buy with your money, straight away this world planted something else upon
  you.'</p>

  <p>'I got rather done over a banjo first day,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Leastways, my uncle says so.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' said Masterman.</p>

  <p>Sid began to speak from the bed. That's all very well, Masterman,' he
  said, 'but after all, money is Power, you know. You can do all sorts of
  things&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I'm talking of happiness,' said Masterman. 'You can do all sorts of
  things with a loaded gun in the Hammersmith Broadway, but
  nothing&mdash;practically&mdash;that will make you or any one else very
  happy. Nothing. Power's a different matter altogether. As for happiness, you
  want a world in order before money or property or any of those things have
  any real value, and this world, I tell you, is hopelessly out of joint. Man
  is a social animal with a mind nowadays that goes round the globe, and a
  community cannot be happy in one part and unhappy in another. It's all or
  nothing, no patching any more for ever. It is the standing mistake of the
  world not to understand that. Consequently people think there is a class or
  order somewhere just above them or just below them, or a country or place
  somewhere that is really safe and happy...The fact is, Society is one body,
  and it is either well or ill. That's the law. This society we live in is ill.
  It's a fractious, feverish invalid, gouty, greedy, ill-nourished. You can't
  have a happy left leg with neuralgia, or a happy throat with a broken leg.
  That's my position, and that's the knowledge you'll come to. I'm so satisfied
  of it that I sit here and wait for my end quite calmly, sure that I can't
  better things by bothering&mdash;in my time and so far as I am concerned,
  that is. I'm not even greedy any more&mdash;my egotism's at the bottom of a
  pond with a philosophical brick round its neck. The world is ill, my time is
  short, and my strength is small. I'm as happy here as anywhere.'</p>

  <p>He coughed, was silent for a moment, then brought the index finger round
  to Kipps again. 'You've had the opportunity of sampling two grades of
  society, and you don't find the new people you're among much better or any
  happier than the old?'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Kipps reflectively. 'No. I 'aven't seen it quite like that
  before, but&mdash;No. They're not.'</p>

  <p>'And you might go all up the scale and down the scale and find the same
  thing. Man's a gregarious beast, a gregarious beast, and no money will buy
  you out of your own time&mdash;any more than out of your own skin. All the
  way up and all the way down the scale there's the same discontent. No one is
  quite sure where they stand, and every one's fretting. The herd's uneasy and
  feverish. All the old tradition goes or has gone, and there's no one to make
  a new tradition. Where are your nobles now? Where are your gentlemen? They
  vanished directly the peasant found out he wasn't happy and ceased to be a
  peasant. There's big men and little men mixed up together, and that's all.
  None of us know where we are. Your cads in a bank holiday train, and your
  cads on a two-thousand-pound motor, except for a difference in scale, there's
  not a pin to choose between them. Your smart society is as low and vulgar and
  uncomfortable for a balanced soul as a gin palace, no more and no less;
  there's no place or level of honour or fine living left in the world, so
  what's the good of climbing?'</p>

  <p>"Ear, 'ear,' said Sid.</p>

  <p>'It's true,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'I don't climb,' said Masterman, and accepted Kipps' silent offer of
  another cigarette.</p>

  <p>'No,' he said. 'This world is out of joint. It's broken up, and I doubt if
  it'll heal. I doubt very much if it'll heal. We're in the beginning of the
  Sickness of the World.'</p>

  <p>He rolled his cigarette in his lean fingers and repeated with
  satisfaction, 'The Sickness of the World.'</p>

  <p>'It's we've got to make it better,' said Sid, and looked at Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Ah, Sid's an optimist,' said Masterman.</p>

  <p>'So you are, most times,' said Sid.</p>

  <p>Kipps lit another cigarette with an air of intelligent participation.</p>

  <p>'Frankly,' said Masterman, recrossing his legs and expelling a jet of
  smoke luxuriously, 'frankly, I think this civilisation of ours is on the
  topple.'</p>

  <p>'There's Socialism,' said Sid.</p>

  <p>'There's no imagination to make use of it.'</p>

  <p>'We've got to make one,' said Sid.</p>

  <p>'In a couple of centuries, perhaps,' said Masterman. 'But meanwhile we're
  going to have a pretty acute attack of universal confusion. Universal
  confusion. Like one of those crushes when men are killed and maimed for no
  reason at all, going into a meeting or crowding for a train. Commercial and
  Industrial Stresses. Political Exploitation. Tariff Wars. Revolutions. All
  the bloodshed that will come of some fools calling half the white world
  yellow. These things alter the attitude of everybody to everybody.
  Everybody's going to feel 'em. Every fool in the world panting and shoving.
  We're all going to be as happy and comfortable as a household during a
  removal. What else can we expect?'</p>

  <p>Kipps was moved to speak, but not in answer to Masterman's inquiry. 'I've
  never rightly got the 'eng of this Socialism,' he said. 'What's it going to
  do, like?'</p>

  <p>They had been imagining that he had some elementary idea in the matter,
  but as soon as he had made it clear that he hadn't Sid plunged at exposition,
  and in a little while Masterman, abandoning his pose of the detached man
  ready to die, joined in. At first he joined in only to correct Sid's version,
  but afterwards he took control. His manner changed. He sat up and rested his
  elbow on his knees, and his cheek flushed a little. He expanded his case
  against property and the property class with such vigour that Kipps was
  completely carried away, and never thought of asking for a clear vision of
  the thing that would fill the void this abolition might create. For a time he
  quite forgot his own private opulence. And it was as if something had been
  lit in Masterman. His languor passed. He enforced his words by gestures of
  his long thin hands. And as he passed swiftly from point to point of his
  argument, it was evident he grew angry.</p>

  <p>'To-day,' he said, 'the world is ruled by rich men; they may do almost
  anything they like with the world. And what are they doing? Laying it
  waste!'</p>

  <p>'Hear, hear!' said Sid, very sternly.</p>

  <p>Masterman stood up, gaunt and long, thrust his hands in his pockets, and
  turned his back to the fire-place.</p>

  <p>'Collectively, the rich to-day have neither heart nor imagination. No!
  They own machinery, they have knowledge and instruments and powers beyond all
  previous dreaming, and what are they doing with them? Think what they are
  doing with them, Kipps, and think what they might do. God gives them a power
  like the motor-car, and all they can do with it is to go careering about the
  roads in goggled masks, killing children and making machinery hateful to the
  souls of men! ('True,' said Sid, 'true.') God gives them means of
  communication, power unparalleled of every sort, time, and absolute liberty!
  They waste it all in folly! Here under their feet (and Kipps' eyes followed
  the direction of a lean index finger to the hearthrug), under their accursed
  wheels, the great mass of men festers and breeds in darkness, darkness those
  others make by standing in the light. The darkness breeds and breeds. It
  knows no better...Unless you can crawl or pander or rob you must stay in the
  stew you are born in. And those rich beasts above claw and clutch as though
  they had nothing! They grudge us our schools, they grudge us a gleam of light
  and air, they cheat us, and then seek to forget us...There is no rule, no
  guidance, only accidents and happy flukes...Our multitudes of poverty
  increase, and this crew of rulers makes no provision, foresees nothing,
  anticipates nothing!'</p>

  <p>He paused, and made a step, and stood over Kipps in a white heat of anger.
  Kipps nodded in a non-committal manner, and looked hard and rather gloomily
  at his host's slipper as he talked.</p>

  <p>'It isn't as though they had something to show for the waste they make of
  us, Kipps. They haven't. They are ugly and cowardly and mean. Look at their
  women! Painted, dyed, and drugged, hiding their ugly shapes under a load of
  dress! There isn't a woman in the swim of society at the present time who
  wouldn't sell herself body and soul, who wouldn't lick the boots of a Jew or
  marry a nigger, rather than live decently on a hundred a year! On what would
  be wealth for you or me! They know it. They know we know it...No one believes
  in them. No one believes in nobility any more. Nobody believes in kingship
  any more. Nobody believes there is justice in the law...But people have
  habits, people go on in the old grooves, as long as there's work, as long as
  there's weekly money...It won't last, Kipps.'</p>

  <p>He coughed and paused. 'Wait for the lean years,' he cried. 'Wait for the
  lean years.' And suddenly he fell into a struggle with his cough, and spat a
  gout of blood. 'It's nothing,' he said to Kipps' note of startled horror.</p>

  <p>He went on talking, and the protests of his cough interlaced with his
  words, and Sid beamed in an ecstasy of painful admiration.</p>

  <p>'Look at the fraud they have let life become, the miserable mockery of the
  hope of one's youth. What have I had? I found myself at thirteen being forced
  into a factory like a rabbit into a chloroformed box. Thirteen!&mdash;when
  their children are babies. But even a child of that age could see what it
  meant, that Hell of a factory! Monotony and toil and contempt and dishonour!
  And then death. So I fought&mdash;at thirteen!'</p>

  <p>Minton's 'crawling up a drainpipe till you die' echoed in Kipps' mind, but
  Masterman, instead of Minton's growl, spoke in a high indignant tenor.</p>

  <p>'I got out at last&mdash;somehow,' he said quietly, suddenly plumping back
  in his chair. He went on after a pause. 'For a bit. Some of us get out by
  luck, some by cunning, and crawl on to the grass, exhausted and crippled, to
  die. That's a poor man's success, Kipps. Most of us don't get out at all. I
  worked all day, and studied half the night, and here I am with the common
  consequences. Beaten! And never once have I had a fair chance, never once!'
  His lean, clenched fist flew out in a gust of tremulous anger. 'These Skunks
  shut up all the university scholarships at nineteen for fear of men like me.
  And then&mdash;do nothing...We're wasted for nothing. By the time I'd learnt
  something the doors were locked. I thought knowledge would do it&mdash;I did
  think that! I've fought for knowledge as other men fight for bread. I've
  starved for knowledge. I've turned my back on women; I've done even that.
  I've burst my accursed lung...' His voice rose with impotent anger. 'I'm a
  better man than any ten princes alive. And I'm beaten and wasted. I've been
  crushed, trampled, and defiled by a drove of hogs. I'm no use to myself or
  the world. I've thrown my life away to make myself too good for use in this
  huckster's scramble. If I had gone in for business, if I had gone in for
  plotting to cheat my fellowmen...Ah, well! It's too late. It's too late for
  that, anyhow. It's too late for anything now! And I couldn't have done
  it...And over in New York now there's a pet of society making a corner in
  wheat!</p>

  <p>'By God!' he cried hoarsely, with a clutch of the lean hand. 'By God! if I
  had his throat! Even now! I might do something for the world.'</p>

  <p>He glared at Kipps, his face flushed deep, his sunken eyes glowing with
  passion, and then suddenly he changed altogether.</p>

  <p>There was a sound of tea-things rattling upon a tray outside the door, and
  Sid rose to open it.</p>

  <p>'All of which amounts to this,' said Masterman, suddenly quiet again and
  talking against time. 'The world is out of joint, and there isn't a soul
  alive who isn't half waste or more. You'll find it the same with you in the
  end, wherever your luck may take you...I suppose you won't mind my having
  another cigarette?'</p>

  <p>He took Kipps' cigarette with a hand that trembled so violently it almost
  missed its object, and stood up, with something of guilt in his manner, as
  Mrs. Sid came into the room.</p>

  <p>Her eye met his, and marked the flush upon his face. 'Been talking
  Socialism?' said Mrs. Sid, a little severely.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Six o'clock that day found Kipps drifting eastward along
the southward
  margin of Rotten Row. You figure him a small, respectably attired person
  going slowly through a sometimes immensely difficult and always immense
  world. At times he becomes pensive, and whistles softly; at times he looks
  about him. There are a few riders in the Row; a carriage flashes by every now
  and then along the roadway, and among the great rhododendrons and laurels and
  upon the green sward there are a few groups and isolated people
  dressed&mdash;in the style Kipps adopted to call upon the Walshinghams when
  first he was engaged. Amid the complicated confusion of Kipps' mind was a
  regret that he had not worn his other things...</p>

  <p>Presently he perceived that he would like to sit down; a green chair
  tempted him. He hesitated at it, took possession of it, and leant back and
  crossed one leg over the other. He rubbed his under lip with his umbrella
  handle, and reflected upon Masterman and his denunciation of the world.</p>

  <p>'Bit orf 'is 'ead, poor chap,' said Kipps; and added, 'I wonder&mdash;' He
  thought intently for a space.</p>

  <p>'I wonder what 'e meant by the lean years'...</p>

  <p>The world seemed a very solid and prosperous concern just here, and well
  out of reach of Masterman's dying clutch. And yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>It was curious he should have been reminded of Minton.</p>

  <p>His mind turned to a far more important matter. Just at the end Sid had
  said to him, 'Seen Ann?' and as he was about to answer, 'You'll see a bit
  more of her now. She's got a place in Folkestone.'</p>

  <p>It had brought him back from any concern about the world being out of
  joint or anything of that sort. Ann!</p>

  <p>One might run against her any day.</p>

  <p>He tugged at his little moustache.</p>

  <p>He would like to run against Ann very much...</p>

  <p>And it would be juiced awkward if he did!</p>

  <p>In Folkestone! It was a jolly sight too close...</p>

  <p>Then at the thought that he might run against Ann in his beautiful evening
  dress on the way to the band, he fluttered into a momentary dream, that
  jumped abruptly into a nightmare.</p>

  <p>Suppose he met her when he was out with Helen! 'Oh, Lor!' said Kipps. Life
  had developed a new complication that would go on and go on. For some time he
  wished with the utmost fervour that he had not kissed Ann, that he had not
  gone to New Romney the second time. He marvelled at his amazing forgetfulness
  of Helen on that occasion. He would have to write to Helen, an easy, off-hand
  letter to say he had come to London for a day or so. He tried to imagine her
  reading it. He would write just such another letter to the old people, and
  say he had had to come up on business. That might do for them all right, but
  Helen was different. She would insist on explanations.</p>

  <p>He wished he could never go back to Folkestone again. That would about
  settle the whole affair.</p>

  <p>A passing group attracted his attention, two faultlessly dressed gentlemen
  and a radiantly expensive lady. They were talking, no doubt, very
  brilliantly. His eyes followed them. The lady tapped the arm of the left-hand
  gentleman with a daintily tinted glove. Swells! No end...</p>

  <p>His soul looked out upon life in general as a very small nestling might
  peep out of its nest. What an extraordinary thing life was to be sure, and
  what a remarkable variety of people there were in it!</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette, and speculated upon that receding group of three, and
  blew smoke and watched them. They seemed to do it all right. Probably they
  all had incomes of very much over twelve hundred a year. Perhaps not.
  Probably they none of them suspected as they went past that he, too, was a
  gentleman of independent means, dressed as he was without distinction. Of
  course things were easier for them. They were brought up always to dress well
  and do the right thing from their very earliest years; they started clear of
  all his perplexities; they had never got mixed up with all sorts of different
  people who didn't go together. If, for example, that lady there got engaged
  to that gentleman, she would be quite safe from any encounter with a
  corpulent, osculatory uncle, or Chitterlow, or the dangerously significant
  eye of Pearce.</p>

  <p>His thoughts came round to Helen.</p>

  <p>When they were married and Cuyps, or Cuyp&mdash;Coote had failed to
  justify his 's'&mdash;and in that West-End flat, and shaken free of all these
  low-class associations, would he and she parade here of an afternoon dressed
  like that? It would be rather fine to do so. If one's dress was all
  right.</p>

  <p>Helen!</p>

  <p>She was difficult to understand at times.</p>

  <p>He blew extensive clouds of cigarette smoke.</p>

  <p>There would be teas, there would be dinners, there would be calls&mdash;Of
  course he would get into the way of it. But Anagrams were a bit stiff to
  begin with!</p>

  <p>It was beastly confusing at first to know when to use your fork at dinner,
  and all that. Still&mdash;</p>

  <p>He felt an extraordinary doubt whether he would get into the way of it. He
  was interested for a space by a girl and groom on horseback, and then he came
  back to his personal preoccupations.</p>

  <p>He would have to write to Helen. What could he say to explain his absence
  from the Anagram Tea? She had been pretty clear she wanted him to come. He
  recalled her resolute face without any great tenderness. He knew he would
  look like a silly ass at that confounded tea! Suppose he shirked it and went
  back in time for the dinner! Dinners were beastly difficult too, but not so
  bad as anagrams. The very first thing that might happen when he got back to
  Folkestone would be to run against Ann. Suppose, after all, he did meet Ann
  when he was with Helen!</p>

  <p>What queer encounters were possible in the world! Thank goodness they were
  going to live in London!</p>

  <p>But that brought him round to Chitterlow. The Chitterlows would be coming
  to London too. If they didn't get money they'd come after it; they weren't
  the sort of people to be choked off easily, and if they did, they'd come to
  London to produce their play. He tried to imagine some seemly social occasion
  invaded by Chitterlow and his rhetoric, by his torrential thunder of
  self-assertion, the whole company flattened thereunder like wheat under a
  hurricane.</p>

  <p>Confound and hang Chitterlow! Yet somehow, somewhen, one would have to
  settle accounts with him! And there was Sid! Sid was Ann's brother. He
  realised with sudden horror the social indiscretion of accepting Sid's
  invitation to dinner.</p>

  <p>Sid wasn't the sort of chap one could snub or cut, and besides&mdash;Ann's
  brother! He didn't want to cut him; it would be worse than cutting Buggins
  and Pearce&mdash;a sight worse. And after that lunch! It would be next thing
  to cutting Ann herself. And even as to Ann!</p>

  <p>Suppose he was with Helen or Coote!&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Oh, Blow!' he said at last, and then viciously, 'Blow!' and so rose and
  flung away his cigarette end and pursued his reluctant dubitating way towards
  the really quite uncongenial splendours of the Royal Grand...</p>

  <p>And it is vulgarly imagined that to have money is to have no troubles at
  all!</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Kipps endured splendour at the Royal Grand Hotel for three
nights and
  days, and then retreated in disorder. The Royal Grand defeated and overcame
  and routed Kipps not of intention, but by sheer royal grandeur, grandeur
  combined with an organisation for his comfort carried to excess. On his
  return he came upon a difficulty, he had lost his circular piece of
  card-board with the number of his room, and he drifted about the hall and
  passages in a state of perplexity for some time, until he thought all the
  porters and officials in gold lace caps must be watching him, and jesting to
  one another about him. Finally, in a quiet corner down below near the
  hairdresser's shop, he found a kindly-looking personage in bottle green to
  whom he broached his difficulty. 'I say,' he said, with a pleasant smile, 'I
  can't find my room nohow.' The personage in bottle green, instead of laughing
  in a nasty way, as he might well have done, became extremely helpful, showed
  Kipps what to do, got his key, and conducted him by lift and passage to his
  chamber. Kipps tipped him half a crown.</p>

  <p>Safe in his room, Kipps pulled himself together for dinner. He had learnt
  enough from young Walshingham to bring his dress clothes, and now he began to
  assume them. Unfortunately, in the excitement of his flight from his aunt and
  uncle, he had forgotten to put in his other boots, and he was some time
  deciding between his purple cloth slippers with a golden marigold and the
  prospect of cleaning the boots he was wearing with the towel, but finally,
  being a little footsore, he took the slippers.</p>

  <p>Afterwards, when he saw the porters and waiters and the other guests catch
  sight of the slippers, he was sorry he had not chosen the boots. However, to
  make up for any want of style at that end, he had his crush hat under his
  arm.</p>

  <p>He found the dining-room without excessive trouble. It was a vast and
  splendidly decorated place, and a number of people, evidently quite au fait,
  were dining there at little tables lit with electric red-shaded candles,
  gentlemen in evening dress, and ladies with dazzling, astonishing necks.
  Kipps had never seen evening dress in full vigour before, and he doubted his
  eyes. And there were also people not in evening dress, who no doubt wondered
  what noble family Kipps represented. There was a band in a decorated recess,
  and the band looked collectively at the purple slippers, and so lost any
  chance they may have had of a donation so far as Kipps was concerned. The
  chief drawback to this magnificent place was the excessive space of floor
  that had to be crossed before you got your purple slippers hidden under a
  table.</p>

  <p>He selected a little table&mdash;not the one where a rather impudent-
  looking waiter held a chair, but another&mdash;sat down, and, finding his
  gibus in his hand, decided after a moment of thought to rise slightly and sit
  on it. (It was discovered in his abandoned chair at a late hour by a
  supper-party and restored to him next day.)</p>

  <p>He put the napkin carefully on one side, selected his soup without
  difficulty, 'Clear, please,' but he was rather floored by the presentation of
  a quite splendidly bound wine-card. He turned it over, discovered a section
  devoted to whisky, and had a bright idea.</p>

  <p>"Ere,' he said to the waiter, with an encouraging movement of the head;
  and then in a confidential manner, 'You 'aven't any Old Methuselah Three
  Stars, 'ave you?'</p>

  <p>The waiter went away to inquire, and Kipps went on with his soup with an
  enhanced self-respect. Finally, Old Methuselah being unattainable, he ordered
  a claret from about the middle of the list. 'Let's 'ave some of this,' he
  said. He knew claret was a good sort of wine.</p>

  <p>'A half bottle?' said the waiter. 'Right you are,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>He felt he was getting on. He leant back after his soup, a man of the
  world, and then slowly brought his eyes round to the ladies in evening dress
  on his right...</p>

  <p>He couldn't have thought it!</p>

  <p>They were scorchers. Jest a bit of black velvet over the shoulders!</p>

  <p>He looked again. One of them was laughing, with a glass of wine half
  raised&mdash;wicked-looking woman she was; the other, the black velvet one,
  was eating bits of bread with nervous quickness and talking fast.</p>

  <p>He wished old Buggins could see them.</p>

  <p>He found a waiter regarding him and blushed deeply. He did not look again
  for some time, and became confused about his knife and fork over the fish.
  Presently he remarked a lady in pink to the left of him eating the fish with
  an entirely different implement.</p>

  <p>It was over the vol au vent that he began to go to pieces. He took a knife
  to it; then saw the lady in pink was using a fork only, and hastily put down
  his knife, with a considerable amount of rich creaminess on the blade, upon
  the cloth. Then he found that a fork in his inexperienced hand was an
  instrument of chase rather than capture. His ears became violently red, and
  then he looked up to discover the lady in pink glancing at him, and then
  smiling, as she spoke to the man beside her.</p>

  <p>He hated the lady in pink very much.</p>

  <p>He stabbed a large piece of the vol au vent at last, and was too glad of
  his luck not to make a mouthful of it. But it was an extensive fragment, and
  pieces escaped him. Shirtfront! 'Desh it!' he said, and had resort to his
  spoon. His waiter went and spoke to two other waiters, no doubt jeering at
  him. He became very fierce suddenly.'</p>

  <p>'Ere!' he said, gesticulating; and then, 'Clear this away!'</p>

  <p>The entire dinner-party on his right, the party of the ladies in advanced
  evening dress, looked at him...He felt that every one was watching him and
  making fun of him, and the injustice of this angered him. After all, they had
  had every advantage he hadn't. And then, when they got him there doing his
  best, what must they do but glance and sneer and nudge one another. He tried
  to catch them at it, and then took refuge in a second glass of wine.</p>

  <p>Suddenly and extraordinarily he found himself a Socialist. He did not care
  how close it was to the lean years when all these things would end.</p>

  <p>Mutton came with peas. He arrested the hand of the waiter. 'No peas,' he
  said. He knew something of the danger and difficulty of eating peas. Then,
  when the peas went away, he was embittered again...Echoes of Masterman's
  burning rhetoric began to reverberate in his mind. Nice lot of people these
  were to laugh at any one! Women half undressed&mdash;It was that made him so
  beastly uncomfortable. How could one eat one's dinner with people about him
  like that? Nice lot they were. He was glad he wasn't one of them anyhow. Yes,
  they might look. He resolved, if they looked at him again, he would ask one
  of the men who he was staring at. His perturbed and angry face would have
  concerned any one. The band, by an unfortunate accident, was playing
  truculent military music. The mental change Kipps underwent was, in its way,
  what psychologists call a conversion. In a few moments all Kipps' ideals were
  changed. He who had been 'practically a gentleman,' the sedulous pupil of
  Coote, the punctilious raiser of hats, was instantly a rebel, an outcast, the
  hater of everything 'stuck up,' the foe of Society and the social order of
  to-day. Here they were among the profits of their robbery, these people who
  might do anything with the world...</p>

  <p>'No, thenks,' he said to a dish.</p>

  <p>He addressed a scornful eye at the shoulders of the lady to his left.</p>

  <p>Presently he was refusing another dish. He didn't like it&mdash;fussed-up
  food! Probably cooked by some foreigner. He finished up his wine and his
  bread...</p>

  <p>'No, thenks.'</p>

  <p>'No, thenks'...</p>

  <p>He discovered the eye of a diner fixed curiously upon his flushed face. He
  responded with a glare. Couldn't he go without things if he liked?</p>

  <p>'What's this?' said Kipps, to a great green cone. 'Ice,' said the
  waiter.</p>

  <p>'I'll 'ave some,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>He seized fork and spoon and assailed the bombe. It cut rather stiffly.
  'Come up!' said Kipps, with concentrated bitterness, and the truncated summit
  of the bomb flew off suddenly, travelling eastward with remarkable velocity.
  Flop, it went upon the floor a yard away, and for a while time seemed
  empty.</p>

  <p>At the adjacent table they were laughing altogether. Shy the rest of the
  bombe at them?</p>

  <p>Flight?</p>

  <p>At any rate, a dignified withdrawal.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Kipps, 'no more,' arresting the polite attempt of the waiter to
  serve him with another piece. He had a vague idea he might carry off the
  affair as though he meant the ice to go on the floor&mdash;not liking ice,
  for example, and being annoyed at the badness of his dinner. He put both
  hands on the table, thrust back his chair, disengaged a purple slipper from
  his napkin, and rose. He stepped carefully over the prostrate ice, kicked the
  napkin under the table, thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and marched
  out&mdash;shaking the dust of the place, as it were, from his feet. He left
  behind him a melting fragment of ice upon the floor, his gibus hat, warm and
  compressed in his chair, and in addition, every social ambition he had ever
  entertained in the world.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">Kipps went back to Folkestone in time for the Anagram Tea.
But you must
  not imagine that the change of heart that came to him in the dining-room of
  the Royal Grand Hotel involved any change of attitude towards this promised
  social and intellectual treat. He went back because the Royal Grand was too
  much for him.</p>

  <p>Outwardly calm, or at most a little flushed and ruffled, inwardly Kipps
  was a horrible, tormented battleground of scruples, doubts, shames, and self-
  assertions during that three days of silent, desperate grappling with the big
  hotel. He did not intend the monstrosity should beat him without a struggle;
  but at last he had sullenly to admit himself overcome. The odds were
  terrific. On the one hand himself&mdash;with, among other things, only one
  pair of boots; on the other a vast wilderness of rooms, covering several
  acres, and with over a thousand people, staff and visitors, all chiefly
  occupied in looking queerly at Kipps, in laughing at him behind his back, in
  watching for difficult corners at which to confront and perplex him and
  inflict humiliations upon him. For example, the hotel scored over its
  electric light. After the dinner the chambermaid, a hard, unsympathetic young
  woman with a superior manner, was summoned by a bell Kipps had rung under the
  impression the button was the electric-light switch. 'Look 'ere,' said Kipps,
  rubbing a shin that had suffered during his search in the dark, 'why aren't
  there any candles or matches?' The hotel explained and scored heavily.</p>

  <p>'It isn't every one is up to these things,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'No, it isn't,' said the chambermaid, with ill-concealed scorn, and
  slammed the door at him. 'S'pose I ought to have tipped her,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>After that Kipps cleaned his boots with a pocket-handkerchief and went for
  a long walk, and got home in a hansom; but the hotel scored again by his not
  putting out his boots, and so having to clean them again in the morning. The
  hotel also snubbed him by bringing him hot water when he was fully dressed
  and looking surprised at his collar, but he got a breakfast, I must admit,
  with scarcely any difficulty.</p>

  <p>After that the hotel scored heavily by the fact that there are twenty-
  four hours in the day and Kipps had nothing to do in any of them. He was a
  little footsore from his previous day's pedestrianism, and he could make up
  his mind for no long excursions. He flitted in and out of the hotel several
  times, and it was the polite porter who touched his hat every time that first
  set Kipps tipping.</p>

  <p>'What 'e wants is a tip,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>So at the next opportunity he gave the man an unexpected shilling, and,
  having once put his hand in his pocket, there was no reason why he should not
  go on. He bought a newspaper at the bookstall and tipped the boy the rest of
  the shilling, and then went up by the lift and tipped the man sixpence,
  leaving his newspaper inadvertently in the lift. He met his chambermaid in
  the passage and gave her half a crown. He resolved to demonstrate his
  position to the entire establishment in this way. He didn't like the place;
  he disapproved of it politically, socially, morally, but he resolved no taint
  of meanness should disfigure his sojourn in its luxurious halls. He went down
  by the lift (tipping again), and, being accosted by a waiter with his gibus,
  tipped the finder half a crown. He had a vague sense that he was making a
  flank movement upon the hotel and buying over its staff. They would regard
  him as a 'character'; they would get to like him. He found his stock of small
  silver diminishing and replenished it at a desk in the hall. He tipped a man
  in bottle green who looked like the man who had shown him his room the day
  before; and then he saw a visitor eyeing him, and doubted whether he was in
  this instance doing right...Finally he went out and took chance buses to
  their destinations, and wandered a little in remote wonderful suburbs, and
  returned. He lunched at a chophouse in Islington, and found himself back in
  the Royal Grand, now unmistakably footsore and London-weary, about three. He
  was attracted to the drawing-room by a neat placard about afternoon tea.</p>

  <p>It occurred to him that the campaign of tipping upon which he had embarked
  was perhaps, after all, a mistake. He was confirmed in this by observing that
  the hotel officials were watching him, not respectfully, but with a sort of
  amused wonder, as if to see whom he would tip next. However, if he backed out
  now, they would think him an awful fool. Every one wasn't so rich as he was.
  It was his way to tip. Still&mdash;</p>

  <p>He grew more certain the hotel had scored again.</p>

  <p>He pretended to be lost in thought, and so drifted by, and having put hat
  and umbrella in the cloakroom, went into the drawing-room for afternoon
  tea.</p>

  <p>There he did get what for a time he held to be a point in his favour. The
  room was large and quiet at first, and he sat back restfully until it
  occurred to him that his attitude brought his extremely dusty boots too
  prominently into the light, so instead he sat up, and then people of the
  upper and upper middle classes began to come and group themselves about him
  and have tea likewise, and so revive the class animosities of the previous
  day.</p>

  <p>Presently a fluffy fair-haired lady came into prominent existence a few
  yards away. She was talking to a respectful low-voiced clergyman, whom she
  was possibly entertaining at tea. 'No,' she said; 'dear Lady Jane wouldn't do
  that!'</p>

  <p>'Mumble, mumble, mumble,' from the clergyman.</p>

  <p>'Poor dear Lady Jane was always so sensitive,' the voice of the lady sang
  out clear and emphatic.</p>

  <p>A fat, hairless, important-looking man joined this group, took a chair,
  and planted it firmly with its back in the face of Kipps, a thing that
  offended Kipps mightily. 'Are you telling him,' gurgled the fat, hairless
  man, 'about dear Lady Jane's affliction?' A young couple, lady brilliantly
  attired, and the man in a magnificently cut frock-coat, arranged themselves
  to the right, also with an air of exclusion towards Kipps. 'I've told him,'
  said the gentleman in a flat, abundant voice. 'My!' said the young lady with
  an American smile. No doubt they all thought Kipps was out of it. A great
  desire to assert himself in some way surged up in his heart. He felt he would
  like to cut in on the conversation in some dramatic way. A monologue,
  something in the manner of Masterman? At any rate, abandoning that as
  impossible, he would like to appear self-centred and at ease. His eye,
  wandering over the black surfaces of a noble architectural mass close by,
  discovered a slot and an enamelled plaque of directions.</p>

  <p>It occurred to Kipps that he would like some music, that to inaugurate
  some would show him a man of taste and at his ease at the same time. He rose,
  read over a list of tunes, selected one haphazard, pressed his
  sixpence&mdash;it was sixpence!&mdash;home, and prepared for a confidential
  refined little melody.</p>

  <p>Considering the high social tone of the Royal Grand, it was really a very
  loud instrument indeed. It gave vent to three deafening brays, and so burst
  the dam of silence that had long pent it in. It seemed to be chiefly full of
  the great-uncles of trumpets, megalo-trombones, and railway-brakes. It made
  sounds like shunting trains. It did not so much begin as blow up your
  counterscarp and rush forward to storm under cover of melodious shrapnel. It
  had not so much an air as a ricochet. The music had, in short, the inimitable
  quality of Sousa. It swept down upon the friend of Lady Jane and carried away
  something socially striking into the eternal night of the unheard; the
  American girl to the left of it was borne off shrieking. 'HIGH cockalorum
  Tootletootle tootle loo. HIGH cockalorum tootle lootle loo. BUMP, bump,
  bump&mdash;BUMP,'&mdash;Native American music, full of native American notes,
  full of the spirit of western college yells and election howls, joyous,
  exorbitant music from the gigantic nursery of the Future, bearing the hearer
  along upon its torrential succession of sounds, as if he was in a cask on
  Niagara. Whiroo! Yah! Have at you! The Strenuous Life! Yaha! Stop! A
  Reprieve! A Reprieve! No! Bang! Bump!</p>

  <p>Everybody looked round, conversation ceased and gave place to gestures.
  The friend of Lady Jane became terribly agitated.</p>

  <p>'Can't it be stopped?' she vociferated, pointing a gloved finger and
  saying something to the waiter about 'that dreadful young man.'</p>

  <p>'Ought not to be working,' said the clerical friend of Lady Jane.</p>

  <p>The waiter shook his head at the fat, hairless gentleman.</p>

  <p>People began to move away. Kipps leant back luxurious and then tapped with
  a half-crown to pay.</p>

  <p>He paid, tipped like a gentleman, rose with an easy gesture, and strolled
  towards the door. His retreat evidently completed the indignation of the
  friend of Lady Jane, and from the door he could still discern her gestures as
  asking, 'Can't it be stopped?' The music followed him into the passage and
  pursued him to the left, and only died away completely in the quiet of his
  own room, and afterwards from his window he saw the friend of Lady Jane and
  her party having their tea carried out to a little table in the Court.</p>

  <p>Certainly that was a point to him. But it was his only score; all the rest
  of the game lay in the hands of the upper classes and the big hotel. And
  presently he was doubting whether even this was really a point. It seemed a
  trifle vulgar, come to think it over, to interrupt people when they were
  talking.</p>

  <p>He saw a clerk peering at him from the office, and suddenly it occurred to
  him that the place might get back at him tremendously over the bill.</p>

  <p>They would probably take it out of him by charging pounds and pounds.</p>

  <p>Suppose they charged more than he had!</p>

  <p>The clerk had a particularly nasty face, just the face to take advantage
  of a vacillating Kipps. He became aware of a man in a cap touching it, and
  produced his shilling automatically, but the strain was beginning to tell. It
  was a deuce and all of an expense&mdash;this tipping.</p>

  <p>If the hotel chose to stick it on to the bill something tremendous, what
  was Kipps to do? Refuse to pay? Make a row?</p>

  <p>If he did he couldn't fight all these men in bottle green.</p>

  <p>He went out about seven and walked for a long time, and dined at last upon
  a chop in the Euston Road; then he walked along to the Edgware Road and sat
  and rested in the Metropolitan Music Hall for a time, until a trapeze
  performance unnerved him, and finally he came back to bed. He tipped the
  lift-man sixpence, and wished him goodnight. In the silent watches of the
  night he reviewed the tale of the day's tipping, went over the horrors of the
  previous night's dinner, and heard again the triumphant bray of the
  harmonicon devil released from its long imprisonment. Every one would be told
  about him tomorrow. He couldn't go on! He admitted his defeat. Never in their
  whole lives had any of these people seen such a Fool as he! Ugh!&mdash;</p>

  <p>His method of announcing his withdrawal to the clerk was touched with
  bitterness.</p>

  <p>'I'm going to get out of this,' said Kipps, blowing windily. 'Let's see
  what you got on my bill.'</p>

  <p>'One breakfast?' asked the clerk.</p>

  <p>'Do I look as if I'd ate two?'&mdash;</p>

  <p>At his departure, Kipps, with a hot face, convulsive gestures, and an
  embittered heart, tipped every one who did not promptly and actively resist,
  including an absentminded South African diamond merchant who was waiting in
  the hall for his wife. He paid his cabman a four-shilling piece at Charing
  Cross, having no smaller change, and wished he could burn him alive. Then in
  a sudden reaction of economy he refused the proffered help of a porter, and
  carried his bag quite violently to the train.</p>

<a id="chap28"
     name="chap28"></a>VIII. &mdash; KIPPS ENTERS SOCIETY</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Submission to Inexorable Fate took Kipps to the Anagram
Tea.</p>

  <p>At any rate he would meet Helen there in the presence of other people, and
  be able to carry off the worst of the difficulty of explaining his little
  jaunt to London. He had not seen her since his last portentous visit to New
  Romney. He was engaged to her, he would have to marry her, and the sooner he
  faced her again the better. Before wild plans of turning Socialist, defying
  the world and repudiating all calling for ever, his heart, on second
  thoughts, sank. He felt Helen would never permit anything of the sort. As for
  the Anagrams, he could do no more than his best, and that he was resolved to
  do. What had happened at the Royal Grand, what had happened at New Romney, he
  must bury in his memory and begin again at the reconstruction of his social
  position. Ann, Buggins, Chitterlow&mdash;all these, seen in the
  matter-of-fact light of the Folkestone corridor train, stood just as they
  stood before&mdash;people of an inferior social position, who had to be
  eliminated from his world. It was a bother about Ann, a bother and a pity.
  His mind rested so for a space on Ann until the memory of those Anagrams drew
  him away. If he could see Coote that evening he might, he thought, be able to
  arrange some sort of connivance about the anagrams, and his mind was chiefly
  busy sketching proposals for such an arrangement. It would not, of course, be
  ungentlemanly cheating, but only a little mystification. Coote, very probably
  might drop him a hint of the solution of one or two of the things&mdash;not
  enough to win a prize, but enough to cover his shame. Or failing that, he
  might take a humorous, quizzical line, and pretend he was pretending to be
  very stupid. There were plenty of ways out of it if one kept a sharp
  lookout...</p>

  <p>The costume Kipps wore to the Anagram Tea was designed as a compromise
  between the strict letter of high fashion and seaside laxity&mdash;a sort of
  easy semi-state for afternoon. Helen's first reproof had always lingered in
  his mind. He wore a frockcoat, but mitigated it by a Panama hat of romantic
  shape with a black band, gray gloves, but, for relaxation, brown button
  boots. The only other man besides the clergy present&mdash;a new doctor with
  an attractive wife&mdash;was in full afternoon dress. Coote was not there.</p>

  <p>Kipps was a little pale, but quite self-possessed, as he approached Mrs.
  Bindon Botting's door. He took a turn while some people went in, and then
  faced it manfully. The door opened and revealed&mdash;Ann!</p>

  <p>In the background, through a draped doorway, behind a big fern in a great
  art pot, the elder Miss Botting was visible talking to two guests; the
  auditory background was a froth of feminine voices...</p>

  <p>Our two young people were much too amazed to give one another any formula
  of greeting, though they had parted warmly enough. Each was already in a
  state of extreme tension to meet the demands of this great and unprecedented
  occasion&mdash;an Anagram Tea. 'Lor!' said Ann, her sole remark; and then the
  sense of Miss Botting's eye ruled her straight again. She became very pale,
  but she took his hat mechanically, and he was already removing his gloves.
  'Ann,' he said in a low tone, and then 'Fency!'</p>

  <p>The eldest Miss Botting knew Kipps was the sort of guest who requires
  nursing, and she came forward vocalising charm. She said it was 'awfully
  jolly of him to come&mdash;awfully jolly. It was awfully difficult to get any
  good men!'</p>

  <p>She handed Kipps forward, mumbling, and in a dazed condition, to the
  drawing-room, and there he encountered Helen, looking unfamiliar in an
  unfamiliar hat. It was as if he had not met her for years.</p>

  <p>She astonished him. She didn't seem to mind in the least his going to
  London. She held out a shapely hand, and smiled encouragingly. 'You've faced
  the anagrams?' she said.</p>

  <p>The second Miss Botting accosted them, a number of oblong pieces of paper
  in her hand, mysteriously inscribed. 'Take an anagram,' she said; 'take an
  anagram,' and boldly pinned one of these brief documents to Kipps' lapel. The
  letters were 'Cypshi,' and Kipps from the very beginning suspected this was
  an anagram for Cuyps. She also left a thing like a long dance programme, from
  which dangled a little pencil, in his hand. He found himself being introduced
  to people, and then he was in a corner with the short lady in a big bonnet,
  who was pelting him with gritty little bits of small talk, that were gone
  before you could take hold of them and reply.</p>

  <p>'Very hot,' said this lady. 'Very hot indeed&mdash;hot all the
  summer&mdash;remarkable year&mdash;all the years remarkable now&mdash;don't
  know what we're coming to. Don't you think so, Mr. Kipps?'</p>

  <p>'Oo, rather,' said Kipps, and wondered if Ann was still in that hall.
  Ann!</p>

  <p>He ought not to have stared at her like a stuck fish, and pretended not to
  know her. That couldn't be right. But what was right?</p>

  <p>The lady in the big bonnet proceeded to a second discharge. 'Hope you're
  fond of anagrams, Mr. Kipps&mdash;difficult exercise&mdash;still, one must do
  something to bring people together&mdash;better than Ludo, anyway. Don't you
  think so, Mr. Kipps?'</p>

  <p>Ann fluttered past the open door. Her eyes met his in amazed inquiry.
  Something had got dislocated in the world for both of them...</p>

  <p>He ought to have told her he was engaged. He ought to have explained
  things to her. Perhaps, even now, he might be able to drop her a hint.</p>

  <p>'Don't you think so, Mr. Kipps?'</p>

  <p>'O, rather,' said Kipps for the third time.</p>

  <p>A lady with a tired smile who was labelled conspicuously, 'Wogdelenk,'
  drifted towards Kipps' interlocutor, and the two fell into conversation.
  Kipps found himself socially aground. He looked about him. Helen was talking
  to a curate and laughing. Kipps was overcome by a vague desire to speak to
  Ann. He was for sidling doorward.</p>

  <p>'What are you, please?' said an extraordinarily bold, tall girl, and
  arrested him while she took down 'Cypshi.'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure I don't know what it means,' she explained 'I'm Sir Bubh. Don't
  you think anagrams are something chronic?'</p>

  <p>Kipps made stockish noises, and the young lady suddenly became the nucleus
  of a party of excited friends who were forming a syndicate to guess, and
  barred his escape. She took no further notice of him. He found himself jammed
  against an occasional table and listening to the conversation of Mrs.
  'Wogdelenk' and his lady with the big bonnet.</p>

  <p>'She packed her two beauties off together,' said the lady in the big
  bonnet. 'Time enough, too. Don't think much of this girl she's got as
  housemaid now. Pretty, of course, but there's no occasion for a housemaid to
  be pretty&mdash;none whatever. And she doesn't look particularly up to her
  work either. Kind of 'mazed expression.'</p>

  <p>'You never can tell,' said the lady labelled 'Wogdelenk'; 'you never can
  tell. My wretches are big enough, Heaven knows, and do they work? Not a bit
  of it!'</p>

  <p>Kipps felt dreadfully out of it with regard to all these people, and
  dreadfully in it with Ann.</p>

  <p>He scanned the back of the big bonnet, and concluded it was an extremely
  ugly bonnet indeed. It got jerking forward as each short, dry sentence was
  snapped off at the end, and a plume of osprey on it jerked excessively. 'She
  hasn't guessed even one!' followed by a shriek of girlish merriment, came
  from the group about the tall, bold girl. They'd shriek at him presently,
  perhaps! Beyond thinking his own anagram might be Cuyps, he hadn't a notion.
  What a chatter they were all making! It was just like a summer sale! Just the
  sort of people who'd give a lot of trouble and swap you! And suddenly the
  smouldering fires of rebellion leapt to flame again. These were a rotten lot
  of people, and the anagrams were rotten nonsense, and he (Kipps) had been a
  rotten fool to come. There was Helen away there still laughing with her
  curate. Pity she couldn't marry a curate, and leave him (Kipps) alone! Then
  he'd know what to do. He disliked the whole gathering, collectively and in
  detail. Why were they all trying to make him one of themselves? He perceived
  unexpected ugliness everywhere about him. There were two great pins jabbed
  through the tall girl's hat, and the swirls of her hair below the brim, with
  the minutest piece of tape tie-up showing, did not repay close examination.
  Mrs. 'Wogdelenk' wore a sort of mumps bandage of lace, and there was another
  lady perfectly dazzling with beads and jewels and bits of trimming. They were
  all flaps and angles and flounces, these women. Not one of them looked as
  neat and decent a shape as Ann's clean, trim little figure. Echoes of
  Masterman woke up in him again. Ladies indeed! Here were all these chattering
  people, with money, with leisure, with every chance in the world, and all
  they could do was to crowd like this into a couple of rooms and jabber
  nonsense about anagrams.</p>

  <p>'Could Cypshi really mean Cuyps?' floated like a dissolving wreath of mist
  across his mind. Abruptly resolution stood armed in his heart. He was going
  to get out of this! "Scuse me,' he said, and began to wade neck-deep through
  the bubbling tea-party. He was going to get out of it all!</p>

  <p>He found himself close by Helen. 'I'm orf,' he said, but she gave him the
  briefest glance. She did not appear to hear. 'Still, Mr. Spratlingdown, you
  must admit there's a limit even to conformity,' she was saying...</p>

  <p>He was in a curtained archway and Ann was before him carrying a tray
  supporting several small sugar-bowls.</p>

  <p>He was moved to speech. 'What a Lot!' he said and then mysteriously, 'I'm
  engaged to her.' He indicated Helen's new hat, and became aware of a skirt he
  had stepped upon.</p>

  <p>Ann stared at him helplessly, borne past in the grip of incomprehensive
  imperatives. Why shouldn't they talk together?</p>

  <p>He was in a small room, and then at the foot of the staircase in the hall.
  He heard the rustle of a dress, and what was conceivably his hostess was upon
  him.</p>

  <p>'But you're not going, Mr. Kipps?' she said. 'I must,' he said. 'I got
  to.'</p>

  <p>'But, Mr. Kipps!'</p>

  <p>'I must,' he said. 'I'm not well.'</p>

  <p>'But before the guessing! Without any tea!'</p>

  <p>Ann appeared and hovered behind him.</p>

  <p>'I got to go,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>If he parleyed with her Helen might awake to his desperate attempt.</p>

  <p>'Of course, if you must go.'</p>

  <p>'It's something I've forgotten,' said Kipps, beginning to feel regrets.
  'Reely, I must.'</p>

  <p>Mrs. Botting turned with a certain offended dignity, and Ann, in a state
  of flushed calm that evidently concealed much, came forward to open the
  door.</p>

  <p>'I'm very sorry,' he said. 'I'm very sorry,' half to his hostess and half
  to her, and was swept past her by superior social forces&mdash;like a
  drowning man in a mill-race&mdash;and into the Upper Sandgate Road. He half
  turned upon the step, and then slam went the door...</p>

  <p>He retreated along the Leas, a thing of shame and perplexity, Mrs.
  Botting's aggrieved astonishment uppermost in his mind...</p>

  <p>Something&mdash;reinforced by the glances of the people he was
  passing&mdash;pressed its way to his attention through the tumultuous
  disorder of his mind.</p>

  <p>He became aware that he was still wearing his little placard with the
  letters 'Cypshi.'</p>

  <p>'Desh it!' he said, clutching off this abomination. In another moment its
  several letters, their task accomplished, were scattering gleefully before
  the breeze down the front of the Leas.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Kipps was dressed for Mrs. Wace's dinner half an hour
before it was time
  to start, and he sat waiting until Coote should come to take him round.
  Manners and Rules of Good Society lay beside him neglected. He had read the
  polished prose of the Member of the Aristocracy on page 96 as far
  as,&mdash;</p>

  <p>'the acceptance of an invitation is, in the eyes of diners out, a binding
  obligation which only ill-health, family bereavement, or some all-important
  reason justifies its being set on one side or otherwise evaded'&mdash;and
  then he had lapsed into gloomy thoughts.</p>

  <p>That afternoon he had had a serious talk with Helen.</p>

  <p>He had tried to express something of the change of heart that had happened
  to him. But to broach the real state of the matter had been altogether too
  terrible for him. He had sought a minor issue. 'I don't like all this
  Society,' he had said.</p>

  <p>'But you must see people,' said Helen.</p>

  <p>'Yes, but&mdash;It's the sort of people you see.' He nerved himself. 'I
  didn't think much of that lot at the Enegram.'</p>

  <p>'You have to see all sorts of people if you want to see the world,' said
  Helen.</p>

  <p>Kipps was silent for a space, and a little short of breath.</p>

  <p>'My dear Arthur,' she began almost kindly, 'I shouldn't ask you to go to
  these affairs if I didn't think it good for you, should I?'</p>

  <p>Kipps acquiesced in silence.</p>

  <p>'You will find the benefit of it all when we get to London. You learn to
  swim in a tank before you go out into the sea. These people here are good
  enough to learn upon. They're stiff and rather silly, and dreadfully narrow,
  and not an idea in a dozen of them, but it really doesn't matter at all.
  You'll soon get Savoir Faire.'</p>

  <p>He made to speak again, and found his powers of verbal expression lacking.
  Instead he blew a sigh. 'You'll get used to it all very soon,' said Helen
  helpfully...</p>

  <p>As he sat meditating over that interview, and over the vistas of London
  that opened before him, on the little flat and teas and occasion, and the
  constant presence of Brudderkins and all the bright prospect of his new and
  better life, and how he would never see Ann any more, the housemaid entered
  with a little package, a small, square envelope for 'Arthur Kipps,
  Esquire.'</p>

  <p>'A young woman left this, Sir,' said the housemaid, a little severely.</p>

  <p>'Eh?' said Kipps. 'What young woman?' and then suddenly began to
  understand. 'She looked an ordinary young woman,' said the housemaid coldly.
  'Ah!' said Kipps. 'That's orlright.'</p>

  <p>He waited till the door had closed behind the girl, staring at the
  envelope in his hand, and then, with a curious feeling of increasing tension,
  tore it open. As he did so, some quicker sense than sight or touch told him
  its contents. It was Ann's half-sixpence. And besides, not a word!</p>

  <p>Then she must have heard him&mdash;!</p>

  <p>He was standing with the envelope in his hand when Coote became audible
  without.</p>

  <p>Coote appeared in evening dress, a clean and radiant Coote, with large
  greenish-white gloves, and a particularly large white tie edged with black.
  'For a third cousin,' he presently explained, 'Nace, isn't it?' He could see
  Kipps was pale and disturbed, and put this down to the approaching social
  trial. 'You keep your nerve up, Kipps, my dear chap, and you'll be all
  right,' said Coote, with a big brotherly glove on Kipps' sleeve.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">The dinner came to a crisis so far as Kipps' emotions were
concerned with
  Mrs. Bindon Botting's talk about servants, but before that there had been
  several things of greater or smaller magnitude to perturb and disarrange his
  social front. One little matter that was mildly insurgent throughout the
  entire meal was, if I may be permitted to mention so intimate a matter, the
  behaviour of his left brace. The webbing&mdash;which was of a cheerful
  scarlet silk&mdash;had slipped away from its buckle, fastened, no doubt, in
  agitation, and had developed a strong tendency to place itself obliquely, in
  the manner rather of an official decoration, athwart his spotless front. It
  first asserted itself before they went in to dinner. He replaced this
  ornament by a dexterous thrust when no one was looking, and there-after the
  suppression of this novel innovation upon the stereotyped sombreness of
  evening dress became a standing preoccupation. On the whole, he was inclined
  to think his first horror excessive; at any rate, no one remarked upon it.
  However, you imagine him constantly throughout the evening with one eye and
  one hand, whatever the rest of him might be doing, predominantly concerned
  with the weak corner.</p>

  <p>But this, I say, was a little matter. What exercised him much more was to
  discover Helen, quite terribly in evening dress.</p>

  <p>The young lady had let her imagination rove Londonward, and this costume
  was perhaps an anticipation of that clever little flat, not too far west,
  which was to become the centre of so delightful a literary and artistic set.
  It was, of all the feminine costumes present, most distinctly an evening
  dress. One was advised Miss Walshingham had arms and shoulders of a type by
  no means despicable; one was advised Miss Walshingham was capable not only of
  dignity but charm, even a certain glow of charm. It was, you know, her first
  evening dress, a tribute paid by Walshingham finance to her brightening
  future. Had she wanted keeping in countenance, she would have had to have
  fallen back upon her hostess, who was resplendent in black and steel. The
  other ladies had to a certain extent compromised. Mrs. Walshingham had
  dressed with just a refined little V, and Mrs. Bindon Botting, except for her
  dear mottled arms, confided scarcely more of her plump charm to the world.
  The elder Miss Botting stopped short of shoulders, and so did Miss Wace. But
  Helen didn't. She was&mdash;had Kipps had eyes to see it&mdash;a quite
  beautiful human figure; she knew it, and she met him with a radiant smile
  that had forgotten all the little difference of the afternoon. But to Kipps
  her appearance was the last release. With that she had become as remote, as
  foreign, as incredible as a wife and male, as though the Cnidian Venus
  herself, in all her simple elegance, was, before witnesses, declared to be
  his. If, indeed, she had ever been credible as a wife and mate!</p>

  <p>She ascribed his confusion to modest reverence, and, having blazed smiling
  upon him for a moment, turned a shapely shoulder towards him and exchanged a
  remark with Mrs. Bindon Botting. Ann's poor half-sixpence came against Kipps'
  fingers in his pocket, and he clutched at it suddenly as though it was a
  talisman. Then he abandoned it to suppress his Order of the Brace. He was
  affected by a cough. 'Miss Wace tells me Mr. Revel is coming,' Mrs. Botting
  was saying.</p>

  <p>'Isn't it delightful?' said Helen. 'We saw him last night. He's stopped on
  his way to Paris. He's going to meet his wife there.'</p>

  <p>Kipps' eyes rested for a moment on Helen's dazzling deltoid, and then went
  inquiringly, accusingly, almost, to Coote's face.</p>

  <p>Where in the presence of this terrible emergence was the gospel of
  suppression now? that Furtive treatment of Religion and Politics, and Birth
  and Death, and Bathing and Babies and 'all those things,' which constitute
  your True Gentleman? He had been too modest even to discuss this question
  with his Mentor, but surely, surely this quintessence of all that is good and
  nice could regard these unsolicited confidences only in one way. With
  something between relief and the confirmation of his worst fears he
  perceived, by a sort of twitching of the exceptionally abundant muscles about
  Coote's lower jaw, in a certain deliberate avoidance of one particular
  direction by those pale but resolute gray eyes, by the almost convulsive grip
  of the ample, greenish-white gloves behind him, a grip broken at times for
  controlling pats at the black-bordered tie and the back of that spacious
  head, and by a slight but increasing disposition to cough, that Coote did not
  approve!</p>

  <p>To Kipps Helen had once supplied a delicately beautiful dream, a thing of
  romance and unsubstantial mystery. But this was her final materialisation,
  and the last thin wreath of glamour about her was dispelled. In some way (he
  had forgotten how, and it was perfectly incomprehensible) he was bound to
  this dark, solid and determined young person, whose shadow and suggestion he
  had once loved. He had to go through with the thing as a gentleman should.
  Still&mdash;</p>

  <p>And then he was sacrificing Ann!</p>

  <p>He wouldn't stand this sort of thing, whatever else he stood...Should he
  say something about her dress to her&mdash;to-morrow?</p>

  <p>He could put his foot down firmly. He could say, 'Look 'ere. I don't care.
  I ain't going to stand it. See?' She'd say something unexpected, of course.
  She always did say something unexpected. Suppose, for once, he overrode what
  she said, and simply repeated his point.</p>

  <p>He found these thoughts battling with certain conversational aggressions
  from Mrs. Wace, and then Revel arrived and took the centre of the stage.</p>

  <p>The author of that brilliant romance, Red Hearts a-Beating, was a less
  imposing man than Kipps had anticipated, but he speedily effaced that
  disappointment by his predominating manners. Although he lived habitually in
  the vivid world of London, his collar and lie were in no way remarkable, and
  he was neither brilliantly handsome nor curly, nor long-haired. His personal
  appearance suggested arm-chairs rather than the equestrian exercises and
  amorous toyings and passionate intensities of his masterpiece; he was
  inclined to be fat, with whitish flesh, muddy-coloured straight hair; he had
  a rather shapeless and truncated nose, and his chin was asymmetrical. One eye
  was more inclined to stare than the other. He might have been esteemed a
  little undistinguished-looking were it not for his beeswaxed moustache, which
  came amidst his features with a pleasing note of incongruity, and the
  whimsical wrinkles above and about his greater eye. His regard sought and
  found Helen's as he entered the room, and they shook hands presently with an
  air of intimacy Kipps, for no clear reason, found objectionable. He saw them
  clasp their hands, heard Coote's characteristic cough&mdash;a sound rather
  more like a very, very old sheep a quarter of a mile away being blown to
  pieces by a small charge of gunpowder than anything else in the
  world&mdash;did some confused beginnings of a thought, and then they were all
  going in to dinner, and Helen's shining bare arm lay along his sleeve. Kipps
  was in no state for conversation. She glanced at him, and, though he did not
  know it, very slightly pressed his elbow. He struggled with strange
  respiratory dislocations. Before them went Coote, discoursing in amiable
  reverberations to Mrs. Walshingham, and at the head of the procession was
  Mrs. Bindon Botting, talking fast and brightly beside the erect military
  figure of little Mr. Wace (He was not a soldier really, but he had caught a
  martinet bearing by living so close to Shorncliffe.) Revel came at last, in
  charge of Mrs. Wace's queenly black and steel, politely admiring in a
  flute-like cultivated voice the mellow wall-paper of the staircase. Kipps
  marvelled at everybody's self-possession.</p>

  <p>From the earliest spoonful of soup it became evident that Revel considered
  himself responsible for the tabletalk. And before the soup was over it was
  almost as manifest that Mrs. Bindon Botting inclined to consider his sense of
  responsibility excessive. In her circle Mrs. Bindon Botting was esteemed an
  agreeable rattle, her manner and appearance were conspicuously vivacious for
  one so plump, and she had an almost Irish facility for humorous description.
  She would keep people amused all through an afternoon call with the story of
  how her jobbing gardener had got himself married and what his home was like,
  or how her favourite butt, Mr. Stigson Warder, had all his unfortunate
  children taught almost every conceivable instrument because they had the
  phrenological bump of music abnormally large. The family itself was also
  abnormally large. 'They got to trombones, my dear!' she would say, with her
  voice coming to a climax. Usually her friends conspired to draw her out, but
  on this occasion they neglected to do so, a thing that militated against her
  keen desire to shine in Revel's eyes. After a time she perceived that the
  only thing for her to do was to cut in on the talk, on her own account, and
  this she began to do. She made several ineffectual snatches at the general
  attention, and then Revel drifted towards a topic she regarded as
  particularly her own&mdash;the ordering of households.</p>

  <p>They came to the thing through talk about localities. 'We are leaving our
  house in the Boltons,' said Revel, 'and taking a little place at Wimbledon,
  and I think of having rooms in Dane's Inn. It will be more convenient in many
  ways. My wife is furiously addicted to golf and exercise of all sorts, and I
  like to sit about in clubs&mdash;I haven't the strength necessary for these
  hygienic proceedings&mdash;and the old arrangement suited neither of us. And
  besides, no one could imagine the demoralisation the domestics of West London
  have undergone during the last three years.'</p>

  <p>'It's the same everywhere,' said Mrs. Bindon Botting.</p>

  <p>'Very possibly it is. A friend of mine calls it the servile tradition in
  decay, and regards it all as a most hopeful phenomenon&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'He ought to have had my last two criminals,' said Mrs. Bindon
  Botting.</p>

  <p>She turned to Mrs. Wace, while Revel came again a little too late with a
  'Possibly&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And I haven't told you, my dear,' she said, speaking with voluble
  rapidity, 'I'm in trouble again.'</p>

  <p>'That last girl?'</p>

  <p>'The last girl. Before I can get a cook, my hard-won housemaid'&mdash;she
  paused&mdash;'chucks it.'</p>

  <p>'Panic?' asked young Walshingham.</p>

  <p>'Mysterious grief! Everything merry as a marriage bell until my Anagram
  Tea! Then in the evening a portentous rigour of bearing, a word or so from my
  aunt, and immediately&mdash;Floods of Tears and Notice!' For a moment her eye
  rested thoughtfully on Kipps as she said, 'Is there anything heartrending
  about Anagrams?'</p>

  <p>'I find them so,' said Revel. 'I&mdash;'</p>

  <p>But Mrs. Bindon Botting got away again. 'For a time it made me quite
  uneasy&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Kipps jabbed his lip with his fork rather painfully, and was recalled from
  a fascinated glare at Mrs. Botting to the immediate facts of dinner.</p>

  <p>'&mdash;whether anagrams might not have offended the good domestic's Moral
  Code&mdash;you never can tell. We made inquiries. No. No. No. She must go,
  and that's all!'</p>

  <p>'One perceives,' said Revel, 'in these disorders, dimly and distantly, the
  last dying glow of the age of Romance. Let us suppose, Mrs. Botting, let us
  at least try to suppose&mdash;it is Love.'</p>

  <p>Kipps clattered with his knife and fork.</p>

  <p>'It's love,' said Mrs. Botting; what else can it be? Beneath the orderly
  humdrum of our lives these romances are going on, until at last they bust up
  and give Notice and upset our humdrum altogether. Some fatal, wonderful
  soldier&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'The passions of the common or house-domestic&mdash;' began Revel, and
  recovered possession of the table.</p>

  <p>Upon the troubled disorder of Kipps' table manners, there had supervened a
  quietness, an unusual calm. For once in his life he had distinctly made up
  his mind on his own account. He listened no more to Revel. He put down his
  knife and fork and refused everything that followed. Coote regarded him with
  tactful concern and Helen flushed a little.</p>

  <p>About half-past nine that night there came a violent pull at the bell of
  Mrs. Bindon Botting, and a young man in a dress-suit and a gibus and other
  marks of exalted social position stood without. Athwart his white expanse of
  breast lay a ruddy bar of patterned silk that gave him a singular distinction
  and minimised the glow of a few small stains of Burgundy. His gibus was
  thrust back, and exposed a disorder of hair that suggested a reckless
  desperation. He had, in fact, burnt his boats and refused to join the ladies.
  Coote, in the subsequent conversation, had protested quietly, 'You're going
  on all right, you know,' to which Kipps had answered he didn't care a 'Eng'
  about that, and so, after a brief tussle with Walshingham's detaining arm,
  had got away. 'I got something to do,' he said. "Ome.' And here he
  was&mdash;panting an extraordinary resolve. The door opened, revealing the
  pleasantly furnished hall of Mrs. Bindon Botting, lit by rose-tinted lights,
  and in the centre of the picture, neat and pretty in black and white, stood
  Ann. At the sight of Kipps her colour vanished.</p>

  <p>'Ann,' said Kipps,' I want to speak to you. I got something to say to you
  right away. See? I'm&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'This ain't the door to speak to me at,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'But, Ann! It's something special.'</p>

  <p>'You spoke enough,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Ann!'</p>

  <p>'Besides, that's my door, down there. Basement. If I was caught talking at
  this door&mdash;!'</p>

  <p>'But, Ann, I'm&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Basement after nine. Them's my hours. I'm a servant, and likely to keep
  one. If you're calling here, what name, please? But you got your friends and
  I got mine, and you mustn't go talking to me.'</p>

  <p>'But, Ann, I want to ask you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Some one appeared in the hall behind Ann. 'Not here,' said Ann. 'Don't
  know any one of that name,' and incontinently slammed the door in his
  face.</p>

  <p>'What was that, Ann?' said Mrs. Bindon Botting's invalid aunt.</p>

  <p>'Ge'm a little intoxicated, Ma'am&mdash;asking for the wrong name,
  Ma'am.'</p>

  <p>'What name did he want?' asked the lady doubtfully.</p>

  <p>'No name that we know, Ma'am' said Ann, hustling along the hall towards
  the kitchen stairs. 'I hope you weren't too short with him, Ann.'</p>

  <p>'No shorter than he deserved, considering 'ow he be'aved,' said Ann, with
  her bosom heaving.</p>

  <p>And Mrs. Bindon Botting's invalid aunt, perceiving suddenly that this call
  had some relation to Ann's private and sentimental trouble, turned, after one
  moment of hesitating scrutiny, away.</p>

  <p>She was an extremely sympathetic lady was Mrs. Bindon Botting's invalid
  aunt; she look an interest in the servants, imposed piety, extorted
  confessions and followed human nature, blushing and lying defensively to its
  reluctantly revealed recesses; but Ann's sense of privacy was strong, and her
  manner, under drawing-out and encouragement, sometimes even alarming...</p>

  <p>So the poor old lady went upstairs again.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">The basement door opened, and Kipps came into the kitchen.
He was flushed
  and panting. He struggled for speech.</p>

  <p>"Ere,' he said, and held out two half-sixpences.</p>

  <p>Ann stood behind the kitchen table&mdash;face pale and eyes round, and
  now&mdash;and it simplified Kipps very much&mdash;he could see she had indeed
  been crying.</p>

  <p>'Well?' she said. 'Don't you see?'</p>

  <p>Ann moved her head slightly.</p>

  <p>'I kep' it all these years.'</p>

  <p>'You kep' it too long.'</p>

  <p>His mouth closed and his flush died away. He looked at her. The amulet, it
  seemed, had failed to work.</p>

  <p>'Ann!' he said. 'Well?'</p>

  <p>'Ann.'</p>

  <p>The conversation still hung fire.</p>

  <p>'Ann,' he said; made a movement with his hands that suggested appeal and
  advanced a step.</p>

  <p>Ann shook her head more definitely, and became defensive.</p>

  <p>'Look here, Ann,' said Kipps. 'I been a fool.'</p>

  <p>They stared into each other's miserable eyes.</p>

  <p>'Ann,' he said. 'I want to marry you.'</p>

  <p>Ann clutched the table edge. 'You can't,' she said faintly.</p>

  <p>He made as if to approach her round the table, and she took a step that
  restored their distance.</p>

  <p>'I must,' he said.</p>

  <p>'You can't.'</p>

  <p>'I must. You got to marry me, Ann.'</p>

  <p>'You can't go marrying everybody. You got to marry 'er.'</p>

  <p>'I shan't.'</p>

  <p>Ann shook her head. 'You're engaged to that girl. Lady, rather. You can't
  be engaged to me.'</p>

  <p>'I don't want to be engaged to you. I been engaged. I want to be married
  to you. See? Right away.' Ann turned a shade paler. 'But what d'you mean?'
  she asked.</p>

  <p>'Come right off to London and marry me. Now.'</p>

  <p>'What d'you mean?'</p>

  <p>Kipps became extremely lucid and earnest.</p>

  <p>'I mean, come right off and marry me now before any one else can.
  See?'</p>

  <p>'In London?'</p>

  <p>'In London.'</p>

  <p>They stared at one another again. They took things for granted in the most
  amazing way. 'I couldn't,' said Ann. 'For one thing, my month's not up for
  mor'n free weeks yet.' They hung before that for a moment as though it was
  insurmountable.</p>

  <p>'Look 'ere, Ann! Arst to go. Arst to go!"</p>

  <p>'She wouldn't,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Then come without arsting,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'She'd keep my box&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'She won't.'</p>

  <p>'She will.'</p>

  <p>'She won't.'</p>

  <p>'You don't know 'er.'</p>

  <p>'Well, desh 'er&mdash;let 'er! LET 'ER! Who cares? I'll buy you a 'undred
  boxes if you'll come.'</p>

  <p>'It wouldn't be right towards Her.'</p>

  <p>'It isn't Her you got to think about, Ann. It's me.'</p>

  <p>'And you 'aven't treated me properly,' she said. 'You 'aven't treated me
  properly, Artie. You didn't ought to 'ave&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I didn't say I 'ad,' he interrupted, 'did I? Ann,' he appealed, 'I didn't
  come to arguefy. I'm all wrong. I never said I wasn't. It's yes or no. Me or
  not...I been a fool. There! See? I been a fool. Ain't that enough? I got
  myself all tied up with every one and made a fool of myself all round...'</p>

  <p>He pleaded, 'It isn't as if we didn't care for one another, Ann.' She
  seemed impassive, and he resumed his discourse.</p>

  <p>'I thought I wasn't likely ever to see you again, Ann. I reely did. It
  isn't as though I was seein' you all the time. I didn't know what I wanted,
  and I went and be'aved like a fool&mdash;jest as any one might. I know what I
  want, and I know what I don't want now.</p>

  <p>'Ann!'</p>

  <p>'Well?'</p>

  <p>'Will you come?...Will you come?...' Silence.</p>

  <p>'If you don't answer me, Ann&mdash;I'm desprit&mdash;if you don't answer
  me now, if you don't say you'll come, I'll go right out now&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He turned doorward passionately as he spoke, with his threat
  incomplete.</p>

  <p>'I'll go,' he said. 'I 'aven't a friend in the world! I been and throwed
  everything away. I don't know why I done things and why I 'aven't. All I know
  is I can't stand nothing in the world any more.' He choked. 'The pier,' he
  said.</p>

  <p>He fumbled with the door-latch, grumbling some inarticulate self-pity, as
  if he sought a handle, and then he had it open.</p>

  <p>Clearly he was going.</p>

  <p>'Artie!'said Ann sharply.</p>

  <p>He turned about, and the two hung white and tense. 'I'll do it,' said
  Ann.</p>

  <p>His face began to work, he shut the door and came a step back to her,
  staring; his face became pitiful, and then suddenly they moved together.
  'Artie!' she cried, 'don't go!' and held out her arms, weeping. They clung
  close to one another...</p>

  <p>'Oh, I been so mis'bel!' cried Kipps, clinging to his lifebuoy; and
  suddenly his emotion, having no further serious work in hand, burst its way
  to a loud boohoo! His fashionable and expensive gibus flopped off, and fell
  and rolled and lay neglected on the floor.</p>

  <p>'I been so mis'bel,' said Kipps, giving himself vent, 'Oh, I been so
  mis'bel, Ann!'</p>

  <p>'Be quiet,' said Ann, holding his poor blubbering head tightly to her
  heaving shoulder, herself all a-quiver; 'be quiet. She's there! Listenin'.
  She'll 'ear you, Artie, on the stairs...'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">You imagine them fleeing through our complex and difficult
social system
  as it were for life, first on foot and severally to the Folkestone Central
  Station, then in a first-class carriage, with Kipps' bag as sole chaperon to
  Charing Cross, and then in a four-wheeler, a long, rumbling, palpitating,
  slow flight through the multitudinous swarming London streets to Sid. Kipps
  kept peeping out of the window. 'It's the next corner after this, I believe,'
  he would say. For he had a sort of feeling that at Sid's he would be immune
  from the hottest pursuit. He paid the cabman in a manner adequate to the
  occasion, and turned to his prospective brother-in-law. 'Me and Ann,' he
  said, 'we're going to marry.'</p>

  <p>'But I thought&mdash;' began Sid.</p>

  <p>Kipps motioned him towards explanations in the shop.</p>

  <p>'It's no good my arguing with you,' said Sid, smiling delightedly as the
  case unfolded. 'You done it now.' And Masterman, being apprised of the nature
  of the affair, descended slowly in a state of flushed congratulation.</p>

  <p>'I thought you might find the Higher Life a bit difficult,' said
  Masterman, projecting a bony hand. 'But I never thought you'd have the
  originality to clear out...Won't the young lady of the superior classes
  swear! Never mind&mdash;it doesn't matter anyhow.</p>

  <p>'You were starting a climb,' he said at dinner, 'that doesn't lead
  anywhere. You would have clambered from one refinement of vulgarity to
  another, and never got to any satisfactory top. There isn't a top. It's a
  squirrel's cage. Things are out of joint, and the only top there is in a lot
  of blazing card-playing women and betting men, seasoned with archbishops and
  officials and all that sort of glossy pandering Tosh...You'd have hung on, a
  disconsolate, dismal little figure somewhere up the ladder, far below even
  the motor-car class, while your wife larked about, or fretted because she
  wasn't a bit higher than she was...I found it all out long ago. I've seen
  women of that sort. And I don't climb any more.'</p>

  <p>'I often thought about what you said last time I saw you,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'I wonder what I said,' said Masterman, in parenthesis. 'Anyhow, you're
  doing the right and sane thing, and that's a rare spectacle. You're going to
  marry your equal, and you're going to take your own line, quite independently
  of what people up there, or people down there, think you ought or ought not
  to do. That's about the only course one can take nowadays, with everything
  getting more muddled and upside down every day. Make your own little world
  and your own house first of all; keep that right side up whatever you do, and
  marry your mate...That, I suppose, it what I should do&mdash;-if I had a
  mate...But people of my sort, luckily for the world, don't get made in pairs.
  No!</p>

  <p>'Besides&mdash;However&mdash;' And abruptly, taking advantage of an
  interruption by Master Walt, he lapsed into thought.</p>

  <p>Presently he came out of his musings. 'After all,' he said, 'there's
  Hope.'</p>

  <p>'What about?' said Sid.</p>

  <p>'Everything,' said Masterman.</p>

  <p>'Where there's life there's hope,' said Mrs. Sid. 'But none of you aren't
  eating anything like you ought to.' Masterman lifted his glass.</p>

  <p>'Here's to Hope!' he said, 'the Light of the World!'</p>

  <p>Sid beamed at Kipps, as who should say, 'You don't meet a character like
  this every dinner-time.'</p>

  <p>'Here's to Hope!' repeated Masterman. The best thing one can have. Hope of
  life&mdash;Yes.'</p>

  <p>He imposed his moment of magnificent self-pity on them all. Even young
  Walt was impressed.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">They spent the days before their marriage in a number of
agreeable
  excursions together. One day they went to Kew by steamboat, and admired the
  house full of paintings of flowers extremely; and one day they went early to
  have a good long day at the Crystal Palace, and enjoyed themselves very much
  indeed. They got there so early that nothing was open inside; all the stalls
  were wrappered up, and all the minor exhibitions locked and barred. They
  seemed the minutest creatures even to themselves in that enormous empty
  aisle, and their echoing footsteps indecently loud. They contemplated
  realistic groups of plaster savages, and Ann thought they'd be queer people
  to have about. She was glad there were none in this country. They meditated
  upon replicas of classical statuary without excessive comment. Kipps said, at
  large, it must have been a queer world then; but Ann very properly doubted if
  they really went about like that. But the place at that early hour was really
  lonely. One began to fancy things. So they went out into the October sunshine
  of the mighty terraces, and wandered amidst miles of stucco tanks, and about
  those quite Gargantuan grounds. A great gray emptiness it was, and it seemed
  marvellous to them, but not nearly so marvellous as it might have seemed. 'I
  never see a finer place, never,' said Kipps, turning to survey the entirety
  of the enormous glass front with Paxton's vast image in the centre.</p>

  <p>'What it must 'ave cost to build!' said Ann, and left her sentence
  eloquently incomplete.</p>

  <p>Presently they came to a region of caves and waterways, and amidst these
  waterways strange reminders of the possibilities of the Creator. They passed
  under an arch made of a whale's jaws, and discovered amidst herbage, browsing
  or standing unoccupied and staring as if amazed at themselves, huge effigies
  of iguanodons, and deinotheria, and mastodons and such-like cattle gloriously
  done in green and gold.</p>

  <p>'They got everything,' said Kipps. 'Earl's Court isn't a patch on it.'</p>

  <p>His mind was very greatly exercised by these monsters, and he hovered
  about them and returned to them. 'You'd wonder 'ow they ever got enough to
  eat,' he said several times.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">It was later in the day, and upon a seat in the presence of
the green and
  gold Labyrinthodon that looms so splendidly above the lake, that the Kippses
  fell into talk about their future. They had made a sufficient lunch in the
  palace, they had seen pictures and no end of remarkable things, and that and
  the amber sunlight made a mood for them, quiet and philosophical&mdash;a
  haven mood. Kipps broke a contemplative silence with an abrupt allusion to
  one principal preoccupation. 'I shall offer an 'pology, and I shall offer 'er
  brother damages. If she likes to bring an action for Breach after that,
  well&mdash;I done all I can...They can't get much out of reading my letters
  in court, because I didn't write none. I dessay a thousan' or two'll settle
  all that, anyhow. I ain't much worried about that. That don't worry me very
  much, Ann&mdash;No.'</p>

  <p>And then, 'It's a lark our marrying.</p>

  <p>'It's curious 'ow things come about. If I 'adn't run against you, where
  should I 'ave been now&mdash;eh?...Even after we met I didn't seem to see it
  like&mdash;not marrying you, I mean&mdash;until that night I came. I
  didn't&mdash;reely.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't neither,' said Ann, with thoughtful eyes on the water.</p>

  <p>For a time Kipps' mind was occupied by the prettiness of her thinking
  face. A faint tremulous network of lights, reflected, from the ripples of a
  passing duck, played subtly over her cheek and faded away.</p>

  <p>Ann reflected. 'I s'pose things 'ad to be,' she said.</p>

  <p>Kipps mused. 'It's curious 'ow over I got on to be engaged to 'er.'</p>

  <p>'She wasn't suited to you,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Suited? No fear! That's jest it. 'Ow did it come about?'</p>

  <p>'I expect she led you on,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>Kipps was half minded to assent. Then he had a twinge of conscience. 'It
  wasn't that, Ann,' he said. 'It's curious. I don't know what it was, but it
  wasn't that. I don't recollect...No...Life's jolly rum; that's one thing,
  any'ow. And I suppose I'm a rum sort of feller. I get excited sometimes, and
  then I don't seem to care what I do. That's about what it was reely.
  Still&mdash;'</p>

  <p>They meditated, Kipps with his arms folded and pulling at his scanty
  moustache. Presently a faint smile came over his face.</p>

  <p>'We'll get a nice little 'ouse out 'Ithe way.'</p>

  <p>'It's 'omelier than Folkestone,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Jest a nice little 'ouse,' said Kipps. 'There's Hughenden, of course. But
  that's let. Besides being miles too big. And I wouldn't live in Folkestone
  again some'ow&mdash;not for anything.'</p>

  <p>'I'd like to 'ave a 'ouse of my own,' said Ann. 'I've often thought, being
  in service, 'ow much I'd like to manage a 'ouse of my own.'</p>

  <p>'You'd know all about what the servants was up to, anyhow,' said Kipps,
  amused. 'Servants! We don't want no servants,' said Ann, startled.</p>

  <p>'You'll 'ave to 'ave a servant,' said Kipps. 'If it's only to do the 'eavy
  work of the 'ouse.'</p>

  <p>'What! and not be able 'ardly to go into my own kitchen?' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'You ought to 'ave a servant,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'One could easy 'ave a woman in for anything that's 'eavy,' said Ann.
  'Besides&mdash;If I 'ad one of the girls one sees about nowadays, I should
  want to be taking the broom out of er 'and and do it all over myself. I'd
  manage better without 'er.'</p>

  <p>'We ought to 'ave one servant, anyhow,' said Kipps, 'else 'ow should we
  manage if we wanted to go out together or anything like that?'</p>

  <p>'I might get a young girl,' said Ann, 'and bring 'er up in my own way.'
  Kipps left the matter at that and came back to the house.</p>

  <p>'There's little 'ouses going into Hythe just the sort we want, not too big
  and not too small. We'll 'ave a kitching and a dining-room and a little room
  to sit in of a night.'</p>

  <p>'I mustn't be a 'ouse with a basement,' said Ann. 'What's a basement?'</p>

  <p>'It's a downstairs, where there's not 'arf enough light and everything got
  to be carried&mdash;up and down, up and down, all day&mdash;coals and
  everything. And it's got to 'ave a water-tap and sink and things upstairs.
  You'd 'ardly believe, Artie, if you 'adn't been in service, 'ow cruel and
  silly some 'ouses are built&mdash;you'd think they 'ad a spite against
  servants the way the stairs are made.'</p>

  <p>'We won't 'ave one of that sort,' said Kipps...'We'll 'ave a quiet little
  life. Now go out a bit&mdash;now come 'ome again. Read a book, perhaps, if we
  got nothing else to do. 'Ave old Buggins in for an evening at times. 'Ave Sid
  down. There's bicycles&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I don't fancy myself on a bicycle,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>"Ave a trailer,' said Kipps, 'and sit like a lady. I'd take you out to
  New Romney easy as anything, jest to see the old people.'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't mind that,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'We'll jest 'ave a sensible little 'ouse, and sensible things. No art or
  anything of that sort, nothing stuck-up or anything, but jest sensible. We'll
  be as right as anything, Ann.'</p>

  <p>'No Socialism,' said Ann, starting a lurking doubt.</p>

  <p>'No Socialism,' said Kipps, 'just sensible&mdash;that's all.'</p>

  <p>'I dessay it's all right for them that understand it, Artie, but I don't
  agree with this Socialism.'</p>

  <p>'I don't neither, reely,' said Kipps. 'I can't argue about it, but it
  don't seem real like to me. All the same, Masterman's a clever fellow,
  Ann.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't like 'im at first, Artie, but I do now&mdash;in a way. You don't
  understand 'im all at once.'</p>

  <p>"E's so clever,' said Kipps. "Arf the time I can't make out what 'e's up
  to. 'E's the cleverest chap I ever met. I never 'eard such talking. 'E ought
  to write a book...It's rum world, Ann, when a chap like that isn't 'ardly
  able to earn a living.'</p>

  <p>'It's 'is 'ealth,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'I expect it is,' said Kipps, and ceased to talk for a little while. 'We
  shall be 'appy in that little 'ouse, Ann, don't y' think?' She met his eyes
  and nodded.</p>

  <p>'I seem to see it,' said Kipps, 'sort of cosy like. 'Bout tea-time and
  muffins, kettle on the 'ob, cat on the 'earthrug&mdash;we must 'ave a cat,
  Ann&mdash;and you there. Eh?'</p>

  <p>They regarded each other with appreciative eyes, and Kipps became
  irrelevant.</p>

  <p>'I don't believe, Ann,' he said, 'I 'aven't kissed you not for 'arf an
  hour. Leastways, not since we was in those caves.' For kissing had already
  ceased to be a matter of thrilling adventure for them.</p>

  <p>Ann shook her head. 'You be sensible and go on talking about Mr.
  Masterman,' she said...</p>

  <p>But Kipps had wandered to something else. 'I like the way your 'air turns
  back jest there,' he said, with an indicative finger. 'It was like that, I
  remember, when you was a girl. Sort of wavy. I've often thought of
  it...'Member when we raced that time&mdash;out be'ind the church?'</p>

  <p>Then for a time they sat idly, each following out agreeable meditations.
  'It's rum,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'What's rum?'</p>

  <p>"Ow everything's 'appened,' said Kipps. 'Who'd 'ave thought of our being
  'ere like this six weeks ago?...Who'd 'ave thought of my ever 'aving any
  money?'</p>

  <p>His eyes went to the big Labyrinthodon. He looked first carelessly and
  then suddenly with a growing interest in its vast face. 'I'm deshed,' he
  murmured. Ann became interested. He laid a hand on her arm and pointed. Ann
  scrutinised the Labyrinthodon, and then came round to Kipps' face in mute
  interrogation.</p>

  <p>'Don't you see it?' said Kipps. 'See what?'...</p>

  <p>"E's jest like old Coote.'</p>

  <p>'It's extinct,' said Ann, not clearly apprehending. 'I dessay 'e is. But
  'e's jest like Old Coote, all the same for that.'</p>

  <p>Kipps meditated on the monstrous shapes in sight. 'I wonder 'ow all these
  old antediluvium animals got extinct,' he asked. 'No one couldn't possibly
  'ave killed 'em.'</p>

  <p>'Why, I know that!' said Ann. 'They was overtook by the Flood...'</p>

  <p>Kipps meditated for a while. 'But I thought they had to take two of
  everything there was&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Within reason they 'ad,' said Ann...</p>

  <p>The Kippses left it at that.</p>

  <p>The great green and gold Labyrinthodon took no notice of their
  conversation. It gazed with its wonderful eyes over their heads into the
  infinite&mdash;inflexibly calm. It might, indeed, have been Coote himself
  there, Coote the unassuming, cutting them dead.</p>

  <p>There was something about its serenity that suggested patience, suggested
  the indifference of a power that waits. In the end this quality, dimly
  apprehended, made the Kippses uneasy, and after a while they got up, and
  glancing backward, went their way.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap31"
     name="chap31"></a>I. &mdash; THE HOUSING PROBLEM</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Honeymoons and all things come to an end, and you see at
last Mr. and Mrs.
  Arthur Kipps descending upon the Hythe platform&mdash;coming to Hythe to find
  that nice little house, to realise that bright dream of a home they had first
  talked about in the grounds of the Crystal Palace. They are a valiant couple,
  you perceive, but small, and the world is a large, incongruous system of
  complex and difficult things. Kipps wears a gray suit, with a wing poke
  collar and a neat, smart tie. Mrs. Kipps is the same bright and healthy
  little girl-woman you saw in the marsh, not an inch has been added to her
  stature in all my voluminous narrative. Only now she wears a hat.</p>

  <p>It is a hat very unlike the hats she used to wear on her Sundays
  out&mdash;a flourishing hat, with feathers and a buckle and bows and things.
  The price of that hat would take many people's breath away&mdash;it cost two
  guineas! Kipps chose it. Kipps paid for it. They left the shop with flushed
  cheeks and smarting eyes, glad to be out of range of the condescending sales-
  woman.</p>

  <p>'Artie,' said Ann, 'you didn't ought to 'ave&mdash;'</p>

  <p>That was all. And, you know, the hat didn't suit Ann a bit. Her clothes
  did not suit her at all. The simple, cheap, clean brightness of her former
  style had given place not only to this hat, but to several other things in
  the same key. And out from among these things looked her pretty face, the
  face of a wise little child&mdash;an artless wonder struggling through a
  preposterous dignity.</p>

  <p>They had bought that hat one day when they had gone to see the shops in
  Bond Street. Kipps had looked at the passers-by, and it had suddenly occurred
  to him that Ann was dowdy. He had noted the hat of a very proud-looking lady
  passing in an electric brougham, and had resolved to get Ann the nearest
  thing to that.</p>

  <p>The railway porters perceived some subtle incongruity in Ann, so did the
  knot of cabmen in the station doorway, the two golfers, and the lady with
  daughters, who had also got out of the train. And Kipps, a little pale,
  blowing a little, not in complete possession of himself, knew that they
  noticed her and him. And Ann&mdash;It is hard to say just what Ann observed
  of these things.</p>

  <p>"Ere!' said Kipps to a cabman, and regretted too late a vanished 'H.'</p>

  <p>'I got a trunk up there,' he said to a ticket-inspector, 'marked A.K.'</p>

  <p>'Ask a porter,' said the inspector, turning his back.</p>

  <p>'Demn!' said Kipps, not altogether inaudibly.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">It is all very well to sit in the sunshine and talk of the
house you will
  have, and another altogether to achieve it. We English&mdash;all the world,
  indeed, to-day&mdash;live in a strange atmosphere of neglected great issues,
  of insistent, triumphant petty things; we are given up to the fine
  littlenesses of intercourse; table manners and small correctitudes are the
  substance of our lives. You do not escape these things for long, even by so
  catastrophic a proceeding as flying to London with a young lady of no wealth
  and inferior social position. The mists of noble emotion swirl and pass, and
  there you are, divorced from all your deities, and grazing in the meadows
  under the Argus eyes of the social system, the innumerable mean judgments you
  feel raining upon you, upon your clothes and bearing, upon your pretensions
  and movements.</p>

  <p>Our world to-day is a meanly conceived one&mdash;it is only an added
  meanness to conceal that fact. For one consequence, it has very few nice
  little houses. Such things do not come for the asking; they are not to be
  bought with money during ignoble times. Its houses are built on the ground of
  monstrously rich, shabbily extortionate land-owners, by poor, parsimonious,
  greedy people in a mood of elbowing competition. What can you expect from
  such ridiculous conditions? To go house-hunting is to spy out the nakedness
  of this pretentious world, to see what our civilisation amounts to when you
  take away curtains and flounces and carpets, and all the fluster and
  distraction of people and fittings. It is to see mean plans meanly executed
  for mean ends, the conventions torn aside, the secrets stripped, the
  substance underlying all such Chester Cootery, soiled and worn and left.</p>

  <p>So you see our poor dear Kippses going to and fro, in Hythe, in Sandgate,
  in Ashford, and Canterbury and Deal and Dover&mdash;at last even in
  Folkestone&mdash;with 'orders to view,' pink and green and white and yellow
  orders to view, and labelled keys in Kipps' hand, and frowns and perplexity
  upon their faces...</p>

  <p>They did not clearly know what they wanted, but whatever it was they saw,
  they knew they did not want that. Always they found a confusing multitude of
  houses they could not take, and none they could. Their dreams began to turn
  mainly on empty, abandoned-looking rooms, with unfaded patches of paper to
  mark the place of vanished pictures, and doors that had lost their keys. They
  saw rooms floored with boards that yawned apart and were splintered,
  skirtings eloquent of the industrious mouse, kitchens with a dead
  black-beetle in the empty cupboard, and a hideous variety of coal-holes and
  dark cupboards under the stairs. They stuck their little heads through roof
  trapdoors, and gazed at disorganised ball-taps, at the black filthiness of
  unstopped roofs. There were occasions when it seemed to them that they must
  be the victims of an elaborate conspiracy of house agents, so bleak and
  cheerless is a second-hand empty house in comparison with the humblest of
  inhabited dwellings.</p>

  <p>Commonly the houses were too big. They had huge windows that demanded vast
  curtains in mitigation, countless bedrooms, acreage of stone steps to be
  cleaned, kitchens that made Ann protest. She had come so far towards a proper
  conception of Kipps' social position as to admit the prospect of one servant.
  'But lor!' she would say, 'you'd want a man-servant in this house.' When the
  houses were not too big, then they were almost always the product of
  speculative building, of that multitudinous, hasty building for the
  extravagant swarm of new births that was the essential disaster of the
  nineteenth century. The new houses Ann refused as damp, and even the youngest
  of those that had been in use showed remarkable signs of a sickly
  constitution&mdash;the plaster flaked away, the floors gaped, the paper
  moulded and peeled, the doors dropped, the bricks were scaled, and the
  railings rusted; Nature, in the form of spiders, earwigs, cockroaches, mice,
  rats, fungi, and remarkable smells, was already fighting her way back...</p>

  <p>And the plan was invariably inconvenient, invariably. All the houses they
  saw had a common quality for which she could find no word, but for which the
  proper word is 'incivility.'</p>

  <p>'They build these 'ouses,' she said, 'as though girls wasn't 'uman
  beings.' Sid's social democracy had got into her blood, perhaps, and, anyhow,
  they went about discovering the most remarkable inconsiderateness in the
  contemporary house.</p>

  <p>'There's kitching stairs to go up, Artie!' Ann would say. 'Some poor
  girl's got to go up and down, up and down, and be tired out, jest because
  they haven't the sense to leave enough space to give their steps a proper
  rise&mdash;and no water upstairs anywhere&mdash;every drop got to be carried!
  It's 'ouses like this wear girls out.</p>

  <p>'It's 'aving 'ouses built by men, I believe, makes all the work and
  trouble,' said Ann...</p>

  <p>The Kippses, you see, thought they were looking for a reasonably simple
  little contemporary house; but indeed they were looking either for dreamland
  or A.D. 1975, or thereabouts, and it hadn't come.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">But it was a foolish thing of Kipps to begin building a
house.</p>

  <p>He did that out of an extraordinary animosity for house-agents he had
  conceived.</p>

  <p>Everybody hates house-agents, just as everybody loves sailors. It is, no
  doubt, a very wicked and unjust hatred, but the business of a novelist is not
  ethical principle, but facts. Everybody hates house-agents because they have
  everybody at a disadvantage. All other callings have a certain amount of give
  and take, the house-agent simply takes. All other callings want you; your
  solicitor is afraid you may change him, your doctor cannot go too far, your
  novelist&mdash;if only you knew it&mdash;is mutely abject towards your
  unspoken wishes; and as for your tradespeople, milkmen will fight outside
  your front door for you, and greengrocers call in tears if you discard them
  suddenly; but who ever heard of a house-agent struggling to serve any one?
  You want a house; you go to him; you, dishevelled and angry from travel,
  anxious, inquiring; he calm, clean, inactive, reticent, quietly doing
  nothing. You beg him to reduce rents, whitewash ceilings, produce other
  houses, combine the summer-house of No. 6 with the conservatory of No.
  4&mdash;much he cares! You want to dispose of a house; then he is just the
  same&mdash;serene, indifferent. On one occasion I remember he was picking his
  teeth all the time he answered me. Competition is a mockery among
  house-agents; they are all alike; you cannot wound them by going to the
  opposite office, you cannot dismiss them, you can at most dismiss yourself.
  They are invulnerably placed behind mahogany and brass, too far usually even
  for a sudden swift lunge with an umbrella; to throw away the keys they lend
  you instead of returning them is larceny, and punishable as such...</p>

  <p>It was a house-agent in Dover who finally decided Kipps to build. Kipps,
  with a certain faltering in his voice, had delivered his ultimatum&mdash;no
  basement, not more than eight rooms, hot and cold water upstairs, coal-cellar
  in the house, but with intervening doors to keep dust from the scullery and
  so forth. He stood blowing. 'You'll have to build a house,' said the
  house-agent, sighing wearily, 'if you want all that.' It was rather for the
  sake of effective answer than with any intention at the time that Kipps
  mumbled, 'That's about what I shall do if this goes on.'</p>

  <p>Whereupon the house-agent smiled. He smiled!</p>

  <p>When Kipps came to turn the thing over his mind, he was surprised to find
  quite a considerable intention had germinated and was growing up in him.
  After all, lots of people have built houses. How could there be so many if
  they hadn't? Suppose he 'reely' did! Then he would go to the house-agent and
  say, "Ere, while you been getting me a sootable 'ouse, blowed if I 'aven't
  built one!' Go round to all of them&mdash;all the house-agents in Folkestone,
  in Dover, Ashford, Canterbury, Margate, Ramsgate, saying that&mdash;! Perhaps
  then they might be sorry.</p>

  <p>It was in the small hours that he awoke to a realisation that he had made
  up his mind in the matter. 'Ann,' he said, 'Ann', and also used the sharp of
  his elbow.</p>

  <p>Ann was at last awakened to the pitch of an indistinct inquiry what was
  the matter. 'I'm going to build a house, Ann.'</p>

  <p>'Eh?' said Ann, suddenly as if awake.</p>

  <p>'Build a house.'</p>

  <p>Ann said something incoherent about he'd better wait until the morning
  before he did anything of the sort, and immediately, with a fine
  trustfulness, went fast asleep again.</p>

  <p>But Kipps lay awake for a long while building his house, and in the
  morning at breakfast he made his meaning clear. He had smarted under the
  indignities of house-agents long enough, and this seemed to promise
  revenge&mdash;a fine revenge. 'And, you know, we might reely make rather a
  nice little 'ouse out of it&mdash;like we want.'</p>

  <p>So resolved, it became possible for them to take a house for a year, with
  a basement, no service lift, blackleading to do everywhere, no water
  upstairs, no bathroom, vast sash windows to be cleaned from the sill, stone
  steps with a twist and open to the rain into the coal-cellar, insufficient
  cupboards, unpaved path to the dustbin, no fireplace to the servant's
  bedroom, no end of splintery wood to scrub&mdash;in fact, a very typical
  English middle-class house. And having added to this house some furniture,
  and a languid young person with unauthentic golden hair named Gwendolen, who
  was engaged to a sergeant-major and had formerly been in an hotel, having
  'moved in' and spent some sleepless nights, varied by nocturnal explorations
  in search of burglars, because of the strangeness of being in a house for
  which they were personally responsible, Kipps settled down for a time and
  turned himself with considerable resolution to the project of building a
  home.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">At first Kipps gathered advice, finding an initial
difficulty in how to
  begin. He went into a builder's shop at Seabrook one day and told the lady in
  charge that he wanted a house built. He was breathless, but quite determined,
  and he was prepared to give his order there and then; but she temporised with
  him, and said her husband was out, and he left without giving his name. Also
  he went and talked to a man in a cart, who was pointed out to him by a
  workman as the builder of a new house near Saltwood, but he found him first
  sceptical and then overpoweringly sarcastic. 'I suppose you build a 'ouse
  every 'oliday,' he said, and turned from Kipps with every symptom of
  contempt.</p>

  <p>Afterwards Carshot told alarming stories about builders and shook Kipps'
  expressed resolution a good deal, and then Pearce raised the question whether
  one ought to go in the first instance to a builder at all, and not rather to
  an architect. Pearce knew a man at Ashford whose brother was an architect,
  and as it is always better in these matters to get some one you know, the
  Kippses decided, before Pearce had gone, and Carshot's warnings had resumed
  their sway, to apply to him. They did so&mdash;rather dubiously.</p>

  <p>The architect, who was brother of Pearce's friend, appeared as a small,
  alert individual with a black bag and a cylindrical silk hat, and he sat at
  the dining-room table, with his hat and his bag exactly equidistant right and
  left of him, and maintained a demeanour of impressive woodenness, while
  Kipps, on the hearthrug, with a quaking sense of gigantic enterprise,
  vacillated answers to his inquiries. Ann held a watching brief for herself,
  in a position she had chosen as suitable to the occasion, beside the corner
  of the carved oak sideboard. They felt, in a sense, at bay.</p>

  <p>The architect began by asking for the site, and seemed a little
  discomposed to discover this had still to be found. 'I thought of building
  just anywhere,' said Kipps. 'I 'aven't made up my mind about that yet.'</p>

  <p>The architect remarked that he would have preferred to see the site in
  order to know where to put what he called his 'ugly side,' but it was quite
  possible, of course, to plan a house 'in the air,' on the level, 'simply with
  back and front assumed'&mdash;if they would like to do that. Kipps flushed
  slightly, and secretly hoping it would make no great difference in the fees,
  said a little doubtfully that he thought that would be all right.</p>

  <p>The architect then marked off, as it were, the first section of his
  subject, with a single dry cough, opened his bag, took out a spring tape
  measure, some hard biscuits, a metal flask, a new pair of dogskin gloves, a
  clockwork motor-car partially wrapped in paper, a bunch of violets, a paper
  of small brass screws, and, finally, a large distended notebook; he replaced
  the other objects carefully, opened his notebook, put a pencil to his lips
  and said, 'And what accommodation will you require?' To which Ann, who had
  followed his every movement with the closest attention and a deepening dread,
  replied with the violent suddenness of one who has lain in wait,
  'Cubbuds!'</p>

  <p>'Anyhow,' she added, catching her husband's eye.</p>

  <p>The architect wrote it down.</p>

  <p>'And how many rooms?' he said, coming to secondary matters.</p>

  <p>The young people regarded one another. It was dreadfully like giving an
  order. 'How many bedrooms, for example?' asked the architect.</p>

  <p>'One?' suggested Kipps, inclined now to minimise at any cost.</p>

  <p>'There's Gwendolen!' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Visitors, perhaps,' said the architect; and temperately, 'You never
  know.'</p>

  <p>'Two, p'r'aps?' said Kipps. 'We don't want no more than a little 'ouse,
  you know.'</p>

  <p>'But the merest shooting-box&mdash;' said the architect...</p>

  <p>They got to six, he beat them steadily from bedroom to bedroom, the word
  'nursery' played across their imaginative skies&mdash;he mentioned it as the
  remotest possibility&mdash;and then six being reluctantly conceded, Ann came
  forward to the table, sat down, and delivered herself of one of her prepared
  conditions. "Ot and cold water,' she said, 'laid on to each
  room&mdash;any'ow.'</p>

  <p>It was an idea long since acquired from Sid.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Kipps, on the hearthrug, "ot and cold water laid on to each
  bedroom&mdash;we've settled on that.'</p>

  <p>It was the first intimation to the architect that he had to deal with a
  couple of exceptional originality, and as he had spent the previous afternoon
  in finding three large houses in The Builder, which he intended to combine
  into an original and copyright design of his own, he naturally struggled
  against these novel requirements. He enlarged on the extreme expensiveness of
  plumbing, on the extreme expensiveness of everything not already arranged for
  in his scheme, and only when Ann declared she'd as soon not have the house as
  not have her requirements, and Kipps, blenching the while, had said he didn't
  mind what a thing cost him so long as he got what he wanted, did he allow a
  kindred originality of his own to appear beneath the acquired professionalism
  of his methods. He dismissed their previous talk with his paragraphic cough.
  'Of course,' he said, 'if you don't mind being unconventional&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He explained that he had been thinking of a Queen Anne style of
  architecture (Ann, directly she heard her name, shook her head at Kipps in an
  aside) so far as the exterior went. For his own part, he said, he liked to
  have the exterior of a house in a style, not priggishly in a style, but
  mixed, with one style uppermost, and the gables and dormers and casements of
  the Queen Anne style, with a little roughcast and sham timbering here and
  there, and perhaps a bit of an overhang, diversified a house and made it
  interesting. The advantages of what he called a Queen Anne style was that it
  had such a variety of features...Still, if they were prepared to be
  unconventional it could be done. A number of houses were now built in the
  unconventional style, and were often very pretty. In the unconventional style
  one frequently had what perhaps he might call Internal Features&mdash;for
  example, an old English oak staircase and gallery. White roughcast and green
  paint were a good deal favoured in houses of this type.</p>

  <p>He indicated that this excursus on style was finished by a momentary use
  of his cough, and reopened his notebook, which he had closed to wave about in
  a moment of descriptive enthusiasm while expatiating on the unbridled wealth
  of External Features associated with Queen Anne. 'Six bedrooms,' he said,
  moistening his pencil. 'One with barred windows, suitable for a nursery if
  required.'</p>

  <p>Kipps endorsed this huskily and reluctantly.</p>

  <p>There followed a most interesting discussion upon housebuilding, in which
  Kipps played a minor part. They passed from bedrooms to the kitchen and
  scullery, and there Ann displayed an intelligent exactingness that won the
  expressed admiration of the architect. They were particularly novel upon the
  position of the coal-cellar, which Ann held to be altogether too low in the
  ordinary house, necessitating much heavy carrying. They dismissed as
  impracticable the idea of having coal-cellar and kitchen at the top of the
  house, because that would involve carrying all the coal through the house,
  and therewith much subsequent cleaning, and for a time they dealt with a
  conception of a coal-cellar on the ground floor with a light staircase
  running up outside to an exterior shoot. 'It might be made a Feature,' said
  the architect a little doubtfully, jotting down a note of it. 'It would be
  apt to get black, you know.'</p>

  <p>Thence they passed to the alternative of service lifts, and then, by an
  inspiration of the architect's, to the possibilities of gas-heating. Kipps
  did a complicated verbal fugue on the theme, 'gas-heating heats the air,'
  with variable aspirates; he became very red, and was lost to the discussion
  altogether for a time, though his lips kept silently moving.</p>

  <p>Subsequently the architect wrote to say that he found in his notebook very
  full and explicit directions for bow windows to all rooms, for bedrooms, for
  water supply, lift, height of stairs and absence of twists therein, for a
  well-ventilated kitchen twenty feet square, with two dressers and a large box
  window seat, for scullery and out-houses and offices, but nothing whatever
  about drawing room, dining-room, library, or study, or approximate cost, and
  he awaited further instructions. He presumed there would be a breakfast-room,
  dining-room, drawing-room, and study for Mr. Kipps&mdash;at least that was
  his conception&mdash;and the young couple discussed this matter long and
  ardently.</p>

  <p>Ann was distinctly restrictive in this direction. 'I don't see what you
  want a drawin'-room and a dinin' and a kitchen for. If we was going to let in
  summer&mdash;well and good. But we're not going to let. Consequently we don't
  want so many rooms. Then there's a 'all. What use is a 'all? It only makes
  work. And a study!'</p>

  <p>Kipps had been humming and stroking his moustache since he had read the
  architect's letter. 'I think I'd like a little bit of a study&mdash;not a big
  one, of course, but one with a desk and bookshelves, like there was in
  Hughenden. I'd like that.'</p>

  <p>It was only after they had talked to the architect again and seen how
  scandalised he was at the idea of not having a drawing-room, that they
  consented to that Internal Feature. They consented to please him. 'But we
  shan't never use it,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>Kipps had his way about a study. 'When I get that study,' said Kipps, 'I
  shall do a bit of reading I've long wanted to do. I shall make a habit of
  going in there and reading something an hour every day. There's Shakespeare
  and a lot of things a man like me ought to read. Besides, we got to 'ave
  somewhere to put the Encyclopaedia. I've always thought a study was about
  what I've wanted all along. You can't 'elp reading if you got a study. If you
  'aven't, there's nothing for it, so far's I can see, but treshy novels.'</p>

  <p>He looked down at Ann, and was surprised to see a joyless thoughtfulness
  upon her face.</p>

  <p>'Fency, Ann!' he said not too buoyantly, "aving a little 'ouse of our
  own!'</p>

  <p>'It won't be a little 'ouse,' said Ann, 'not with all them rooms.'</p>

  <p>Any lingering doubt in that matter was dispelled when it came to
  plans.</p>

  <p>The architect drew three sets of plans on a transparent bluish sort of
  paper that smelt abominably. He painted them very nicely; brick-red and
  ginger, and arsenic green and a leaden sort of blue, and brought them over to
  show our young people. The first set were very simple, with practically no
  External Features&mdash;'a plain style,' he said it was&mdash;but it looked a
  big sort of house, nevertheless; the second had such extras as a
  conservatory, bow windows of various sorts, one roughcast gable and one
  half-timbered ditto in plaster, and a sort of overhung veranda, and was much
  more imposing; and the third was quite fungoid with External Features, and
  honeycombed with Internal ones; it was, he said, 'practically a mansion,' and
  altogether a very noble fruit of the creative mind of man. It was, he
  admitted, perhaps almost too good for Hythe; his art had run away with him
  and produced a modern mansion in the 'best Folkestone style'; it had a
  central hall with a staircase, a Moorish gallery, and a Tudor stained-glass
  window, crenelated battlements to the leading over the portico, an octagonal
  bulge with octagonal bay windows, surmounted by an Oriental dome of metal,
  lines of yellow bricks to break up the red, and many other richnesses and
  attractions. It was the sort of house, ornate and in its dignified way
  voluptuous, that a city magnate might build, but it seemed excessive to the
  Kippses. The first plan had seven bedrooms, the second eight, the third
  eleven; they had, the architect explained, 'worked in' as if they were
  pebbles in a mountaineer's boot.</p>

  <p>They're big 'ouses,' said Ann, directly the elevations were unrolled.</p>

  <p>Kipps listened to the architect, with round eyes and an exuberant caution
  in his manner, anxious not to commit himself further than he had done to the
  enterprise, and the architect pointed out the Features and other objects of
  interest with the scalpel belonging to a pocket manicure set that he carried.
  Ann watched Kipps' face, and communicated with him furtively over the
  architect's head. 'Not so big,' said Ann's lips.</p>

  <p>'It's a bit big for what I meant,' said Kipps, with a reassuring eye on
  Ann.</p>

  <p>'You won't think it big when you see it up,' said the architect; 'you take
  my word for that.'</p>

  <p>'We don't want no more than six bedrooms,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Make this one a box-room, then,' said the architect.</p>

  <p>A feeling of impotence silenced Kipps for a time.</p>

  <p>'Now which,' said the architect, spreading them out, 'is it to be?'</p>

  <p>He flattened down the plans of the most ornate mansion to show it to
  better effect.</p>

  <p>Kipps wanted to know how much each would cost 'at the outside,' which led
  to much alarmed signalling from Ann. But the architect could estimate only in
  the most general way.</p>

  <p>They were not really committed to anything when the architect went away;
  Kipps had promised to think it over&mdash;that was all.</p>

  <p>'We can't 'ave that 'ouse,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'They're miles too big&mdash;all of them,' agreed Kipps.</p>

  <p>'You'd want&mdash;Four servants wouldn't be 'ardly enough,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>Kipps went to the hearthrug and spread himself. His tone was almost off-
  hand. 'Nex' time 'e comes,' said Kipps, 'I'll s'plain to him. It isn't at all
  the sort of thing we want. It's&mdash;it's a misunderstanding. You got no
  occasion to be anxious 'bout it, Ann.'</p>

  <p>'I don't see much good reely in building an 'ouse at all,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Oo, we got to build a 'ouse now we begun,' said Kipps. 'But now supposin'
  we 'ad&mdash;' He spread out the most modest of the three plans and scratched
  his cheek.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">It was unfortunate that old Kipps came over the next day.</p>

  <p>Old Kipps always produced peculiar states of mind in his nephew&mdash;a
  rash assertiveness, a disposition towards display unlike his usual self.
  There had been great difficulty in reconciling both these old people to the
  Pornick m&Uacute;salliance, and at times the controversy echoed in old Kipps'
  expressed thoughts. This, perhaps, it was, and no ignoble vanity, that set
  the note of florid successfulness going in Kipps' conversation whenever his
  uncle appeared. Mrs. Kipps was, as a matter of fact, not reconciled at all;
  she had declined all invitations to come over on the bus, and was a taciturn
  hostess on the one occasion when the young people called at the toy-shop en
  route for Mrs. Pornick. She displayed a tendency to sniff that was clearly
  due to pride rather than catarrh, and, except for telling Ann she hoped she
  would not feel too 'stuck up' about her marriage, confined her conversation
  to her nephew or the infinite. The call was a brief one, and made up chiefly
  of pauses, no refreshment was offered or asked for, and Ann departed with a
  singularly high colour. For some reason she would not call at the toy-shop a
  second time when they found themselves again in New Romney.</p>

  <p>But old Kipps, having adventured over and tried the table of the new
  m&Uacute;nage and found it to his taste, showed many signs of softening
  towards Ann. He came again, and then again. He would come over by the bus,
  and, except when his mouth was absolutely full, he would give his nephew one
  solid and continuous mass of advice of the most subtle and disturbing
  description until it was time to toddle back to the High Street for the
  afternoon bus. He would walk with him to the sea front, and commence
  pourparlers with boatmen for the purchase of one of their boats&mdash;'You
  ought to keep a boat of your own,' he said&mdash;though Kipps was a singularly
  poor sailor&mdash;or he would pursue a plan that was forming in his mind in
  which he should own and manage what he called 'weekly' property in the less
  conspicuous streets of Hythe. The cream of that was to be a weekly collection
  of rents in person, the nearest approach to feudal splendour left in this
  democratised country. He gave no hint of the source of the capital he
  designed for this investment, and at times it would appear he intended it as
  an occupation for his nephew rather than himself.</p>

  <p>But there remained something in his manner towards Ann&mdash;in the
  glances of scrutiny he gave her unawares, that kept Kipps alertly expansive
  whenever he was about; and in all sorts of ways. It was on account of old
  Kipps, for example, that our Kipps plunged one day&mdash;a golden
  plunge&mdash;and brought home a box of cummerbundy ninepenny cigars, and
  substituted blue label old Methuselah Four Stars for the common and generally
  satisfactory white brand.</p>

  <p>'Some of this is whisky, my boy,' said old Kipps, when he tasted it,
  smacking critical lips...</p>

  <p>'Saw a lot of young officery fellers coming along,' said old Kipps. 'You
  ought to join the volunteers, my boy, and get to know a few.'</p>

  <p>'I dessay I shall,' said Kipps. 'Later.'</p>

  <p>'They'd make you an officer, you know, 'n no time. They want officers,'
  said old Kipps. 'It isn't every one can afford it. They'd be regular glad to
  'ave you...Ain't bort a dog yet?'</p>

  <p>'Not yet, Uncle. 'Ave a segar?'</p>

  <p>'Nor a moty car?'</p>

  <p>'Not yet, Uncle.'</p>

  <p>'There's no 'urry about that. End don't get one of these 'ere trashy cheap
  ones when you do get it, my boy. Get one as'll last a lifetime...I'm
  surprised you don't 'ire a bit more.'</p>

  <p>'Ann don't seem to fency a moty car,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Ah,' said old Kipps, 'I expect not,' and glanced a comment at the door.
  'She ain't used to going out,' he said. 'More at 'ome indoors.'</p>

  <p>'Fact is,' said Kipps hastily, 'we're thinking of building a 'ouse.'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't do that, my boy,' began old Kipps; but his nephew was routing
  in the chiffonier drawer amidst the plans. He got them in time to check some
  further comment on Ann. 'Um,' said the old gentleman, a little impressed by
  the extraordinary odour and the unusual transparency of the tracing-paper
  Kipps put into his hands. 'Thinking of building a 'ouse, are you?'</p>

  <p>Kipps began with the most modest of the three projects.</p>

  <p>Old Kipps read slowly through his silver-rimmed spectacles, 'Plan a 'ouse
  for Arthur Kipps, Esquire. Um.'</p>

  <p>He didn't warm to the project all at once, and Ann drifted into the room
  to find him still scrutinising the architect's proposals a little
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>'We couldn't find a decent 'ouse anywhere,' said Kipps, leaning against
  the table and assuming an off-hand note.</p>

  <p>'I didn't see why we shouldn't run up one for ourselves.' Old Kipps could
  not help liking the tone of that. 'We thought we might see&mdash;' said
  Ann.</p>

  <p>'It's a spekerlation, of course,' said old Kipps, and held the plan at a
  distance of two feet or more from his glasses and frowned. This isn't exactly
  the 'ouse I should expect you to 'ave thought of though,' he said,
  'Practically, it's a villa. It's the sort of 'ouse a bank clerk might 'ave.
  T'isn't what I should call a gentleman's 'ouse, Artie.'</p>

  <p>'It's plain, of course,' said Kipps, standing beside his uncle and looking
  down at this plan, which certainly did seem a little less magnificent now
  than it had at the first encounter.</p>

  <p>'You mustn't 'ave it too plain,' said old Kipps. 'If it's
  comfortable&mdash;' Ann hazarded.</p>

  <p>Old Kipps glanced at her over his spectacles. 'You ain't comfortable, my
  gel, in this world, not if you don't live up to your position'&mdash;so
  putting compactly into contemporary English that fine old phrase noblesse
  oblige.</p>

  <p>'A 'ouse of this sort is what a retired tradesman might 'ave, or some
  little whipper-snapper of a s'licitor. But you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Course that isn't the on'y plan,' said Kipps, and tried the middle
  one.</p>

  <p>But it was the third one won over old Kipps. 'Now, that's a 'ouse, my
  boy,' he said at the sight of it.</p>

  <p>Ann came and stood just behind her husband's shoulder, while old Kipps
  expanded upon the desirability of the larger scheme. 'You ought to 'ave a
  billiard-room,' he said; 'I don't see that, but all the rest's about right! A
  lot of these 'ere officers 'ere 'ud be glad of a game of billiards...</p>

  <p>'What's all these pots? said old Kipps.</p>

  <p>'S'rubbery,' said Kipps. 'Flow'ing s'rubs.'</p>

  <p>'There's eleven bedrooms in that 'ouse,' said Ann. 'It's a bit of a lot,
  ain't it, Uncle?'</p>

  <p>'You'll want 'em, my girl. As you get on you'll be 'aving visitors.
  Friends of your 'usband's, p'r'aps, from the School of Musketry&mdash;what
  you want 'im to get on with. You can't never tell.'</p>

  <p>'If we 'ave a great s'rubbery,' Ann ventured, 'we shall 'ave to keep a
  gardener.'</p>

  <p>'If you don't 'ave a s'rubbery,' said old Kipps, with a note of patient
  reasoning, "ow are you to prevent every jackanapes that goes by starin' into
  your drorin'-room winder&mdash;p'r'aps when you get some one a bit special to
  entertain?'</p>

  <p>'We ain't used to a s'rubbery,' said Ann, mulishly; 'we get on very well
  'ere.'</p>

  <p>'It isn't what you're used to,' said old Kipps, 'it's what you ought to
  'ave now.' And with that Ann dropped out of the discussion.</p>

  <p>'Study and lib'ry,' old Kipps read. That's right. I see a Tantalus the
  other day over Brookland, the very thing for a gentleman's study. I'll try
  and get over and bid for it...'</p>

  <p>By bus time old Kipps was quite enthusiastic about the house-building, and
  it seemed to be definitely settled that the largest plan was the one decided
  upon.</p>

  <p>But Ann had said nothing further in the matter.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">When Kipps returned from seeing his uncle into the
bus&mdash;there always
  seemed a certain doubt whether that portly figure would go into the little
  red 'Tip-top' box&mdash;he found Ann still standing by the table, looking
  with an expression of comprehensive disapproval at the three plans.</p>

  <p>'There don't seem much the matter with Uncle,' said Kipps, assuming the
  hearthrug, 'spite of 'is 'eartburn. 'E 'opped up them steps like a bird.'</p>

  <p>Ann remained staring at the plans.</p>

  <p>'You don't like them plans?' hazarded Kipps.</p>

  <p>'No; I don't, Artie.'</p>

  <p>'We got to build somethin' now.'</p>

  <p>'But&mdash;It's a gentleman's 'ouse, Artie!'</p>

  <p>'It's&mdash;it's a decent size, o' course.'</p>

  <p>Kipps took a flirting look at the drawing and went to the window.</p>

  <p>'Look at the cleanin'. Free servants'll be lost in that 'ouse, Artie.'</p>

  <p>'We must 'ave servants,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>Ann looked despondently at her future residence.</p>

  <p>'We got to keep up our position any'ow,' said Kipps, turning towards her.
  'It stands to reason, Ann, we got a position. Very well! I can't 'ave you
  scrubbin' floors. You got to 'ave a servant, and you got to manage a 'ouse.
  You wouldn't 'ave me ashamed&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Ann opened her lips and did not speak.</p>

  <p>'What?' asked Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Nothing,' said Ann, 'only I did want it to be a little 'ouse, Artie. I
  wanted it to be a 'andy little 'ouse, jest for us.'</p>

  <p>Kipps' face was suddenly flushed and obstinate. He took up the curiously
  smelling tracings again. 'I'm not agoing to be looked down upon,' he said.
  'It's not only Uncle I'm thinking of!'</p>

  <p>Ann stared at him.</p>

  <p>Kipps went on. 'I won't 'ave that young Walshingham f'r instance, sneering
  and sniffing at me. Making out at if we was all wrong. I see 'im
  yesterday...Nor Coote neether. I'm as good&mdash;we're as
  good&mdash;whatever's 'appened.'</p>

  <p>Silence, and the rustle of plans.</p>

  <p>He looked up and saw Ann's eyes bright with tears. For a moment the two
  stared at one another. 'We'll 'ave the big 'ouse,' said Ann, with a gulp. 'I
  didn't think of that, Artie.'</p>

  <p>Her aspect was fierce and resolute, and she struggled with emotion. 'We'll
  'ave the big 'ouse,' she repeated. 'They shan't say I dragged you down wiv
  me&mdash;none of them shan't say that. I've thought&mdash;I've always been
  afraid of that.'</p>

  <p>Kipps looked again at the plan, and suddenly the grand house had become
  very grand indeed. He blew.</p>

  <p>'No, Artie. None of them shan't say that,' and, with something blind in
  her motions, Ann tried to turn the plan round to her...now he did not know
  how to say it.</p>

  <p>And so the plans went out to the builders, and in a little while Kipps was
  committed to two thousand five hundred pounds' worth of building. But then,
  you know, he had an income of twelve hundred a year.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">It is extraordinary what minor difficulties cluster about
  housebuilding.</p>

  <p>'I say, Ann,' remarked Kipps one day. 'We shall 'ave to call this little
  'ouse by a name. I was thinking of "Ome Cottage.' But I dunno whether 'Ome
  Cottage is quite the thing like. All these little fisherman's places are
  called Cottages.'</p>

  <p>'I like 'Cottage," said Ann.</p>

  <p>'It's got eleven bedrooms, y'see', said Kipps. 'I don't see 'ow you call
  it a cottage with more bedrooms than four. Prop'ly speaking, it's a Large
  Villa. Prop'ly it's almost a Big 'Ouse. Leastways a 'Ouse.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Ann, 'if you must call it Villa&mdash;Home Villa...I wish it
  wasn't.' Kipps meditated.</p>

  <p>"Ow about Eureka Villa?' he said, raising his voice.</p>

  <p>'What's Eureka?'</p>

  <p>'It's a name,' he said. 'There used to be Eureka Dress Fasteners. There's
  lots of names, come to think of it, to be got out of a shop. There's Pyjama
  Villa. I remember that in the hosiery. No, come to think, that wouldn't do.
  But Maraposa&mdash;sort of oatmeal cloth, that was...No! Eureka's
  better.'</p>

  <p>Ann meditated. 'It seems silly like to 'ave a name that don't mean
  much.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps it does,' said Kipps. 'Though it's what people 'ave to do.'</p>

  <p>He became meditative. 'I got it!' he cried.</p>

  <p>'Not Oreeka!' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'No! There used to be a 'ouse at Hastings opposite our school&mdash;quite
  a big 'ouse it was&mdash;St. Ann's. Now that&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Mrs. Kipps, with decision. 'Thanking you kindly, but I don't
  have no butcher boys making game of me...'</p>

  <p>They consulted Carshot, who suggested, after some days of reflection,
  Waddycombe, as a graceful reminder of Kipps' grandfather; old Kipps, who was
  for 'Upton Manor House,' where he had once been second footman; Buggins, who
  favoured either a stern, simple number, 'Number One'&mdash;if there were no
  other houses there, or something patriotic, as 'Empire Villa'; and Pearce,
  who inclined to 'Sandringham'; but in spite of all this help they were still
  undecided, when amidst violent perturbations of the soul and after the most
  complex and difficult haggling, wranglings, fears, muddles, and goings to and
  fro, Kipps became the joyless owner of a freehold plot of three-eighths of an
  acre, and saw the turf being wheeled away from the site that should one day
  be his home.</p>

  <h2>
<a id="chap32"
     name="chap32"></a>II. &mdash; THE CALLERS</h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">The Kippses sat at their midday dinner-table amidst the
vestiges of
  rhubarb pie, and discussed two post cards the one o'clock post had brought.
  It was a rare, bright moment of sunshine in a wet and windy day in the March
  that followed their marriage. Kipps was attired in a suit of brown, with a
  tie of fashionable green, while Ann wore one of those picturesque loose robes
  that are usually associated with sandals and advanced ideas. But there
  weren't any sandals on Ann or any advanced ideas, and the robe had come quite
  recently through the counsels of Mrs. Sid. Pornick. 'It's Art-like,' said
  Kipps, but giving way. 'It's more comfortable,' said Ann. The room looked out
  by French windows upon a little patch of green and the Hythe parade. The
  parade was all shiny wet with rain, and the green-gray sea tumbled and
  tumbled between parade and sky.</p>

  <p>The Kipps furniture, except for certain chromolithographs of Kipps'
  incidental choice, that struck a quiet note amidst the wall-paper, had been
  tactfully forced by an expert salesman, and it was in a style of mediocre
  elegance. There was a sideboard of carved oak that had only one
  fault&mdash;it reminded Kipps at times of woodcarving, and its panel of
  bevelled glass now reflected the back of his head. On its shelf were two
  books from Parsons' Library, each with a 'place' marked by a slip of paper;
  neither of the Kippses could have told you the title of either book they
  read, much less the author's name. There was an ebonised overmantel set with
  phials and pots of brilliant colour, each duplicated by looking-glass, and
  bearing also a pair of Japanese jars made in Birmingham, a wedding-present
  from Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Pornick, and several sumptuous Chinese fans. And
  there was a Turkey carpet of great richness. In addition to these modern
  exploits of Messrs. Bunt and Bubble, there were two inactive tall clocks,
  whose extreme dilapidation appeal to the connoisseur; a terrestrial and a
  celestial globe, the latter deeply indented; a number of good old
  iron-moulded and dusty books; and a stuffed owl, wanting one (easily
  replaceable) glass eye, obtained by the exertions of Uncle Kipps. The table
  equipage was as much as possible like Mrs. Bindon Botting's, only more
  costly, and in addition there were green and crimson
  wine-glasses&mdash;though the Kippses never drank wine...</p>

  <p>Kipps turned to the more legible of his two post cards again.</p>

  <p>"Unavoidably prevented from seein' me to-day,' 'e says. I like 'is cheek.
  After I give 'im 'is start and everything.'</p>

  <p>He blew.</p>

  <p>"E certainly treats you a bit orf and,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>Kipps gave vent to his dislike of young Walshingham.</p>

  <p>'He's getting too big for 'is britches,' he said. 'I'm beginning to wish
  she 'ad brought an action for breach. Ever since 'e said the wouldn't, 'e's
  seemed to think I've got no right to spend my own money.'</p>

  <p>"E's never liked your building the 'ouse,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>Kipps displayed wrath. 'What the goodness 'as it got to do wiv 'im?'</p>

  <p>'Overmantel, indeed!' he added; 'Overmantel!...'E tries that on with
  me&mdash;I'll tell 'im something 'e won't like.'</p>

  <p>He took up the second card. 'Dashed if I can read a word of it. I can just
  make out Chit'low at the end, and that's all.'</p>

  <p>He scrutinised it. 'It's like some one in a fit writing. This here might
  be W-H-A-T&mdash;what. P-R-I-C-E&mdash;I got it! What price Harry now? It was
  a sort of saying of 'is. I expect 'e's either done something or not done
  something towards starting that play, Ann.'</p>

  <p>'I expect that's about it,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>Kipps grunted with effort. 'I can't read the rest,' he said at last,
  'nohow.'</p>

  <p>A thoroughly annoying post. He pitched the card on the table, stood up and
  went to the window, where Ann, after a momentary reconnaissance at
  Chitterlow's hieroglyphics, came to join him.</p>

  <p>'Wonder what I shall do this afternoon,' said Kipps, with his hands deep
  in his pockets. He produced and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>'Go for a walk, I s'pose,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'I been for a walk this morning.'</p>

  <p>'S'pose I must go for another,' he added, after an interval.</p>

  <p>They regarded the windy waste of sea for a space.</p>

  <p>'Wonder why it is 'e won't see me,' said Kipps, returning to the problem
  of young Walshingham. 'It's all lies about 'is being too busy.'</p>

  <p>Ann offered no solution.</p>

  <p>'Rain again!' said Kipps&mdash;as the lash of the little drops stung the
  window.</p>

  <p>'Oo, bother!' said Kipps, 'you got to do something. Look 'ere, Ann! I'll
  go orf for a reg'lar tramp through the rain, up by Saltwood, round by
  Newington, over the camp, and so round and back, and see 'ow they're getting
  on about the 'ouse. See? And look 'ere!&mdash;you get Gwendolen to go out a
  bit before I come back. If it's still rainy, she can easy go round and see
  'er sister. Then we'll 'ave a bit of tea, with teacake&mdash;all
  buttery&mdash;see? Toce it ourselves, p'r'aps. Eh?'</p>

  <p>'I dessay I can find something to do in the 'ouse,' said Ann, considering.
  'You'll take your mackintosh and leggings, I s'pose? You'll get wet without
  your mackintosh over those roads.'</p>

  <p>'Right-o,' said Kipps; and went to ask Gwendolen for his brown leggings
  and his other pair of boots.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Things conspired to demoralise Kipps that afternoon.</p>

  <p>When he got outside the house everything looked so wet under the drive of
  the south-wester that he abandoned the prospect of the clay lanes towards
  Newington altogether, and turned east to Folkestone along the Seabrook digue.
  His mackintosh flapped about him, the rain stung his cheek; for a time he
  felt a hardy man. And then as abruptly the rain ceased and the wind fell, and
  before he was through Sandgate High Street it was a bright spring day. And
  there was Kipps in his mackintosh and squeaky leggings, looking like a
  fool!</p>

  <p>Inertia carried him another mile to the Leas, and there the whole world
  was pretending there had never been such a thing as rain&mdash;ever. There
  wasn't a cloud in the sky; except for an occasional puddle, the asphalte
  paths looked as dry as a bone. A smartly dressed man, in one of those
  overcoats that look like ordinary cloth, and are really most deceitfully and
  unfairly waterproof, passed him and glanced at the stiff folds of his
  mackintosh. 'Demn!' said Kipps. His mackintosh swished against his leggings,
  his leggings piped and whistled over his boot-tops.</p>

  <p>'Why do I never get anything right?' Kipps asked of a bright, implacable
  universe.</p>

  <p>Nice old ladies passed him, refined people with tidy umbrellas, bright,
  beautiful, supercilious-looking children. Of course, the right thing for such
  a day as this was a light overcoat and an umbrella. A child might have known
  that. He had them at home, but how could one explain that? He decided to turn
  down by the Harvey monument and escape through Clifton Gardens towards the
  hills. And thereby he came upon Coote.</p>

  <p>He already felt the most abject and propitiatory of social outcasts when
  he came upon Coote, and Coote finished him. He passed within a yard of Coote.
  Coote was coming along towards the Leas, and when Kipps saw him his legs
  hesitated about their office, and he seemed to himself to stagger about all
  over the footpath. At the sight of him Coote started visibly. Then a sort of
  rigor vitae passed through his frame, his jaw protruded and errant bubbles of
  air seemed to escape and run about beneath his loose skin. (Seemed, I
  say&mdash;I am perfectly well aware that there is really connective tissue in
  Coote, as in all of us, to prevent anything of the sort.) His eyes fixed
  themselves on the horizon and glazed. As he went by Kipps could hear his
  even, resolute breathing. He went by, and Kipps staggered on into a universe
  of dead cats and dust-heaps, rind and ashes&mdash;cut!</p>

  <p>It was part of the inexorable decrees of Providence that almost
  immediately afterwards the residuum of Kipps had to pass a very, very long
  and observant-looking girls' school.</p>

  <p>Kipps recovered consciousness again on the road between Shorncliffe
  station and Cheriton, though he cannot remember, indeed, to this day he has
  never attempted to remember, how he got there. And he was back at certain
  thoughts suggested by his last night's novel-reading, that linked up directly
  with the pariah-like emotions of these last encounters. The novel lay at home
  upon the chiffonier; it was one about society and politics&mdash;there is no
  need whatever to give the title or name the author&mdash;written with a
  heavy-handed thoroughness that overrode any possibility of resistance on the
  part of the Kipps' mind. It had crushed all his poor edifice of ideals, his
  dreams of a sensible, unassuming existence, of snugness, of not caring what
  people said, and all the rest of it, to dust; it had reinstated, squarely and
  strongly again, the only proper conception of English social life. There was
  a character in the book who trifled with Art, who was addicted to reading
  French novels, who dressed in a loose, careless way, who was a sorrow to his
  dignified, silvery haired, politico-religious mother, and met the admonitions
  of bishops with a front of brass. He treated a 'nice girl,' to whom they had
  got him engaged, badly; he married beneath him&mdash;some low thing or other.
  And sank...</p>

  <p>Kipps could not escape the application of the case. He was enabled to see
  how this sort of thing looked to decent people; he was enabled to gauge the
  measure of the penalties due. His mind went from that to the frozen marble of
  Coote's visage.</p>

  <p>He deserved it!</p>

  <p>That day of remorse! Later it found him upon the site of his building
  operations and surveying the disorder of preparation in a mood near to
  despair, his mackintosh over his arm.</p>

  <p>Hardly any one was at work that day&mdash;no doubt the builders were
  having him in some obscure manner&mdash;and the whole place seemed a dismal
  and depressing litter. The builder's shed, black lettered WILKINS, BUILDER,
  HYTHE, looked like a stranded thing amidst a cast-up disorder of wheelbarrows
  and wheeling planks, and earth, and sand, and bricks. The foundations of the
  walls were trenches full of damp concrete, drying in patches; the
  rooms&mdash;it was incredible they could ever be rooms&mdash;were shaped out
  as squares and oblongs of coarse wet grass and sorrel. They looked absurdly
  small&mdash;dishonestly small. What could you expect? Of course the builders
  were having him, building too small, building all wrong, using bad materials!
  Old Kipps had told him a wrinkle or two. The builders were having him, young
  Walshingham was having him, everybody was having him! They were having him
  and laughing at him because they didn't respect him. They didn't respect him
  because he couldn't do things right. Who could respect him?...</p>

  <p>He was an outcast, he had no place in the society of mankind. He had had
  his chance in the world and turned his back on it. He had 'behaved
  badly'&mdash;that was the phrase...</p>

  <p>Here a great house was presently to arise&mdash;a house to be paid for, a
  house neither he nor Ann could manage&mdash;with eleven bedrooms, and four
  disrespectful servants having them all the time!</p>

  <p>How had it all happened exactly?</p>

  <p>This was the end of his great fortune! What a chance he had had! If he had
  really carried out his first intentions and stuck to things, how much better
  everything might have been! If he had got a tutor&mdash;that had been in his
  mind originally&mdash;a special sort of tutor, to show him everything right.
  A tutor for gentlemen of neglected education. If he had read more and
  attended better to what Coote had said...</p>

  <p>Coote, who had just cut him!...</p>

  <p>Eleven bedrooms! What had possessed him? No one would ever come to see
  them; no one would ever have anything to do with them. Even his aunt cut him!
  His uncle treated him with a half-contemptuous sufferance. He had not a
  friend worth counting in the world! Buggins, Carshot, Pearce&mdash;shop
  assistants! The Pornicks&mdash;a low, Socialist lot! He stood among his
  foundations like a lonely figure among ruins; he stood among the ruins of his
  future, and owned himself a foolish and mistaken man. He saw himself and Ann
  living out their shameful lives in this great crazy place&mdash;as it would
  be&mdash;with everybody laughing secretly at them, and the eleven bedrooms
  and nobody approaching them&mdash;nobody nice and right, that is&mdash;for
  ever. And Ann!</p>

  <p>What was the matter with Ann? She'd given up going for walks lately, got
  touchy and tearful, been fitful with her food. Just when she didn't ought to.
  It was all a part of the judgment upon wrong-doing; it was all part of the
  social penalties that Juggernaut of a novel had brought home to his
  mind.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">He let himself in with his latch-key. He went moodily into
the dining-
  room and got out the plans to look at them. He had a vague hope that there
  would prove to be only ten bedrooms. But he found there were still eleven. He
  became aware of Ann standing over him. 'Look 'ere, Artie!' said Ann.</p>

  <p>He looked up and found her holding a number of white oblongs. His eyebrows
  rose.</p>

  <p>'It's Callers,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>He put his plans aside slowly, and took and read the cards in silence,
  with a sort of solemnity. Callers! then perhaps he wasn't to be left out of
  the world after all. Mrs. G. Porrett Smith; Miss Porrett Smith; Miss Mabel
  Porrett Smith; and two smaller cards of the Rev. G. Porrett Smith. 'Lor!' he
  said. 'Clergy!'</p>

  <p>'There was a lady,' said Ann, 'and two growed-up gels&mdash;all dressed
  up!'</p>

  <p>'And 'im?'</p>

  <p>There wasn't no 'im.'</p>

  <p>'Not&mdash;?' He held out the little card.</p>

  <p>'No. There was a lady and two young ladies.'</p>

  <p>'But&mdash;these cards! Whad they go and leave these two little cards with
  the Rev. G. Smith on for? Not if 'e wasn't with 'em.'</p>

  <p>"E wasn't with 'em.'</p>

  <p>'Not a little chap&mdash;dodgin' about be'ind the others? And didn't come
  in?'</p>

  <p>'I didn't see no gentleman with them at all,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Rum!' said Kipps. A half-forgotten experience came back to him. 'I know,'
  he said, waving the reverend gentleman's card, "e give 'em the slip; that's
  what he'd done. Gone off while they was rapping before you let 'em in. It's a
  fair call any'ow.' He felt a momentary base satisfaction at his absence.
  'What did they talk about, Ann?'</p>

  <p>There was a pause. 'I didn't let 'em in,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>He looked up suddenly and perceived that something unusual was the matter
  with Ann. Her face was flushed, her eyes were red and hard.</p>

  <p>'Didn't let 'em in?'</p>

  <p>'No! They didn't come in at all.' He was too astonished for words.</p>

  <p>'I answered the door,' said Ann. 'I'd been upstairs, 'namelling the floor.
  'Ow was I to think about Callers, Artie? We ain't never 'ad Callers, all the
  time we been 'ere. I'd sent Gwendolen out for a bref of fresh air, and there
  I was upstairs, 'namelling that floor she done so bad, so's to get it done
  before she came back. I thought I'd 'namel that floor and then get tea, and
  'ave it quiet with you, toce and all, before she came back. 'Ow was I to
  think about Callers?'</p>

  <p>She paused. 'Well,' said Kipps, 'what then?'</p>

  <p>'They came and rapped. 'Ow was I to know? I thought it was a tradesman or
  something. Never took my apron off, never wiped the 'namel off my
  'ands&mdash; nothin'. There they was!'</p>

  <p>She paused again. She was getting to the disagreeable part. 'Wad they
  say?' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'She says, 'Is Mrs. Kipps at home?' See? To me.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'And me all painty and no cap on and nothing, neither missis nor servant
  like. There, Artie, I could 'a sunk through the floor with shame, I really
  could. I could 'ardly get my voice. I couldn't think of nothing to say but
  just 'Not at 'Ome,' and out of 'abit like I 'eld the tray. And they give me
  the cards and went, and 'ow I shall ever look that lady in the face again I
  don't know...And that's all about it, Artie! They looked me up and down they
  did, and then I shut the door on 'em.'</p>

  <p>'Goo!' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>Ann went and poked the fire needlessly with a passion-quivering hand.</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't 'ave 'ad that 'appen for five pounds,' said Kipps. 'Clergyman
  and all!'</p>

  <p>Ann dropped the poker into the fender with some &Uacute;clat, and stood up
  and looked at her hot face in the glass. Kipps' disappointment grew. 'You did
  ought to 'ave known better than that, Ann! You reely did.'</p>

  <p>He sat forward, cards in hand, with a deepening sense of social disaster.
  The plates were laid upon the table, toast sheltered under a cover at mid-
  fender, the teapot warmed beside it, and the kettle, just lifted from the
  hob, sang amidst the coals. Ann glanced at him for a moment, then stooped
  with the kettle-holder to wet the tea.</p>

  <p>'Tcha!' said Kipps, with his mental state developing.</p>

  <p>'I don't see it's any use getting in a state about it now,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Don't you! I do. See? 'Ere's these peoples, good people, want to
  'ssociate with us, and 'ere you go and slap 'em in the face!'</p>

  <p>'I didn't slap 'em in the face.'</p>

  <p>'You do&mdash;practically. You slams the door in their face, and that's
  all we see of 'em ever! I wouldn't 'ave 'ad this 'appen not for a ten-pound
  note.'</p>

  <p>He rounded his regrets with a grunt. For a while there was silence, save
  for the little stir of Ann's few movements preparing tea.</p>

  <p>'Tea, Artie,' said Ann, handing him a cup. Kipps took it.</p>

  <p>'I put sugar once,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Oo, dash it! Oo cares?' said Kipps, taking an extraordinarily large
  additional lump with fury-quivering fingers, and putting his cup, with a
  slight excess of force on the recess cupboard. 'Oo cares?'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't 'ave 'ad that 'appen,' he said, bidding steadily against
  accomplished things, 'for twenty pounds.' He gloomed in silence through a
  long minute or so.</p>

  <p>Then Ann said the fatal thing that exploded him. 'Artie!' she said.</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'There's Buttud Toce down there! By your foot!'</p>

  <p>There was a pause, husband and wife regarded one another.</p>

  <p>'Buttud Toce, indeed!' he said. 'You go and mess up them callers, and then
  you try and stuff me up with Buttud Toce! Buttud Toce, indeed! 'Ere's our
  first chance of knowing anyone that's at all fit to 'sociate with&mdash;Look
  'ere, Ann! Tell you what it is&mdash;you got to return that call.'</p>

  <p>'Return that call!'</p>

  <p>'Yes&mdash;you got to return that call. That's what you got to do! I
  know&mdash;' He waved his arm vaguely towards the miscellany of books in the
  recess. 'It's in Manners and Rools of Good S'ity. You got to find jest 'ow
  many cards to leave, and you got to go and leave 'em. See?'</p>

  <p>Ann's face expressed terror. 'But, Artie!'</p>

  <p>"Ow can I?'</p>

  <p>"Ow can you?' 'Ow could you? You got to do it, any'ow. They won't know
  you&mdash;not in your Bond Street 'At! If they do, they won't say
  nothing.'</p>

  <p>His voice assumed a note of entreaty. 'You mus', Ann.'</p>

  <p>'I can't.'</p>

  <p>'You mus'.'</p>

  <p>'I can't, and I won't. Anything in reason I'll do, but face those people
  again I can't&mdash;after what 'as 'appened.'</p>

  <p>'You won't?'</p>

  <p>'No!'...</p>

  <p>'So there they go&mdash;orf! And we never see them again! And so it goes
  on! So it goes on! We don't know nobody, and we shan't know anybody! And you
  won't put yourself out not a little bit, or take the trouble to find out
  anything 'ow it ought to be done.'</p>

  <p>Terrible pause.</p>

  <p>'I never ought to 'ave merried you, Artie, that's the troof.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't go into that!'</p>

  <p>'I never ought to have merried you, Artie. I'm not equal to the position.
  If you 'adn't said you'd drown yourself&mdash;'</p>

  <p>She choked.</p>

  <p>'I don' see why you shouldn't try, Ann&mdash;I've improved.</p>

  <p>'Why don't you? 'Stead of which you go sending out the servant and
  'namelling floors, and then when visitors come&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"Ow was I to know about y'r old visitors?' cried Ann in a wail, and
  suddenly got up and fled from amidst their ruined tea, the tea of which
  'toce, all buttery,' was to be the crown and glory.</p>

  <p>Kipps watched her with a momentary consternation. Then he hardened his
  heart. 'Ought to 'ave known better,' he said, 'goin' on like that!' He
  remained for a space rubbing his knees and muttering. He emitted scornfully,
  'I carn't, an' I won't.' He saw her as the source of all his shames.</p>

  <p>Presently, quite mechanically, he stooped down and lifted the flowery
  china cover. 'Ter dash 'er Buttud Toce!' he shouted at the sight of it, and
  clapped the cover down again hard...</p>

  <p>When Gwendolen came back she perceived things were in a slightly unusual
  poise. Kipps sat by the fire in a rigid attitude, reading a casually selected
  volume of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and Ann was upstairs and
  inaccessible&mdash;to reappear at a later stage with reddened eyes. Before
  the fire, and still in a perfectly assimilable condition, was what was
  evidently an untouched supply of richly buttered toast under a cracked
  cover.</p>

  <p>'They've 'ad a bit of a tiff,' said Gwendolen, attending to her duties in
  the kitchen with her outdoor hat still on, and her mouth full. 'They're
  rummuns&mdash;if ever! My eye!'</p>

  <p>And she took another piece of Ann's generously buttered toast.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">The Kippses spoke no more that day to one another.</p>

  <p>The squabble about cards and buttered toast was as serious to them as the
  most rational of differences. It was all rational to them. Their sense of
  wrong burnt within them; their sense of what was owing to themselves, the
  duty of implacability, the obstinacy of pride. In the small hours Kipps lay
  awake at the nadir of unhappiness, and came near groaning. He saw life as an
  extraordinarily desolating muddle; his futile house, his social discredit,
  his bad behaviour to Helen, his low marriage with Ann...</p>

  <p>He became aware of something irregular in Ann's breathing...</p>

  <p>He listened. She was awake, and quietly and privately sobbing!...</p>

  <p>He hardened his heart, resolutely he hardened his heart. And presently Ann
  lay still.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">The stupid little tragedies of these clipped and limited
lives!</p>

  <p>As I think of them lying unhappily there in the darkness, my vision
  pierces the night. See what I can see! Above them, brooding over them, I tell
  you there is a monster, a lumpish monster, like some great, clumsy griffin
  thing, like the Crystal Palace labyrinthodon, like Coote, like the leaden
  goddess of the Dunciad, like some fat, proud flunkey, like pride, like
  indolence, like all that is darkening and heavy and obstructive in life. It
  is matter and darkness, it is the anti-soul, it is the ruling power of this
  land, Stupidity. My Kippses live in its shadow. Shalford and his
  apprenticeship system, the Hastings Academy, the ideas of Coote, the ideas of
  the old Kippses, all the ideas that have made Kipps what he is&mdash;all
  these are a part of its shadow. But for that monster they might not be
  groping among false ideas to hurt one another so sorely; but for that, the
  glowing promise of childhood and youth might have had a happier fruition;
  thought might have awakened in them to meet the thought of the world, the
  quickening sunshine of literature pierced to the substance of their souls;
  their lives might not have been divorced, as now they are divorced, from the
  apprehension of beauty that we favoured ones are given&mdash;the vision of
  the Grail that makes life fine for ever. I have laughed, and I laugh at these
  two people; I have sought to make you laugh...</p>

  <p>But I see through the darkness the souls of my Kippses as they are, as
  little pink strips of quivering, living stuff, as things like the bodies of
  little, ill-nourished, ailing, ignorant children&mdash;children who feel
  pain, who are naughty and muddled and suffer, and do not understand why. And
  the claw of this Beast rests upon them!</p>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">Next morning came a remarkable telegram from Folkestone.
'Please come at
  once&mdash;urgent&mdash;Walshinghams,' said the telegram, and Kipps, after an
  agitated but still ample breakfast, departed...</p>

  <p>When he returned his face was very white, and his countenance disordered.
  He let himself in with his latchkey and came into the dining-room, where Ann
  sat, affecting to work at a little thing she called a bib. She heard his hat
  fall in the hall before he entered, as though he had missed the peg. 'I got
  something to tell you, Ann,' he said, disregarding their overnight quarrel,
  and went to the hearthrug and took hold of the mantel and stared at Ann as
  though the sight of her was novel.</p>

  <p>'Well?' said Ann, not looking up, and working a little faster.</p>

  <p>"E's gone!'</p>

  <p>Ann looked up sharply, and her hands stopped. 'Who's gone?' For the first
  time she perceived Kipps' pallor. 'Young Walshingham&mdash;I saw 'er, and she
  tole me.'</p>

  <p>'Gone! What d'you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Cleared out! Gone off for good!'</p>

  <p>'What for?'</p>

  <p>'For 'is 'ealth,' said Kipps, with sudden bitterness. "E's been
  speckylating. He's speckylated our money, and 'e's speckylated their money,
  and now 'e's took 'is hook. That's all about it, Ann.'</p>

  <p>'You mean&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'I mean 'e's orf, and our twenty-four fousand's orf too! And 'ere we are!
  Smashed up! That's all about it, Ann.' He panted.</p>

  <p>Ann had no vocabulary for such an occasion. 'Oh, Lor!' she said, and sat
  still.</p>

  <p>Kipps came about and stuck his hands deeply in his trouser pockets.
  'Speckylated every penny&mdash;lorst it all&mdash;and gorn.'</p>

  <p>Even his lips were white.</p>

  <p>'You mean we ain't got nothing' left, Artie?'</p>

  <p>'Not a penny! Not a bloomin' penny, Ann. No!'</p>

  <p>A gust of passion whirled across the soul of Kipps. He flung out a knuckly
  fist. 'If I 'ad 'im 'ere,' he said, 'I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;I'd wring 'is neck
  for 'im. I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;' His voice rose to a shout. He thought of
  Gwendolen in the kitchen, and fell to, 'Ugh!'</p>

  <p>'But, Artie,' said Ann, trying to grasp it,'d'you mean to say he's took
  our money?'</p>

  <p>'Speckylated it!' said Kipps, with an illustrative flourish of the arm
  that failed to illustrate. 'Bort things dear and sold' em cheap, and played
  the 'ankeypankey jackass with everything we got. That's what I mean 'e's
  done, Ann.' He repeated this last sentence with the addition of violent
  adverbs.</p>

  <p>'D'you mean to say our money's gone, Artie?'</p>

  <p>'Ter-dash it, Yes, Ann!' swore Kipps, exploding in a shout. 'Ain't I
  tellin' you?'</p>

  <p>He was immediately sorry. 'I didn't mean to 'oller at you, Ann,' he said,
  'but I'm all shook up. I don't 'ardly know what I'm sayin'. Ev'ry
  penny...'</p>

  <p>'But, Artie&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Kipps grunted. He went to the window and stared for a moment at a sunlit
  sea. 'Gord!' he swore.</p>

  <p>'I mean,' he said coming back to Ann, and with an air of exasperation,
  'that he's 'bezzled and 'ooked it. That's what I mean, Ann.'</p>

  <p>Ann put down the bib. 'But wot are we going to do, Artie?'</p>

  <p>Kipps indicated ignorance, wrath, and despair with one comprehensive
  gesture of his hands. He caught an ornament from the mantel and replaced it.
  'I'm going to bang about,' he said, 'if I ain't precious careful.'</p>

  <p>'You saw 'er, you say?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'What did she say 'xactly?' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Told me to see a s'licitor&mdash;tole me to get some one to 'elp me at
  once. She was there in black&mdash;like she used to be, and speaking cool and
  careful like. 'Elen!...She's precious 'ard, is 'Elen. She looked at me
  straight. 'It's my fault,' she said. 'I ought to 'ave warned you...Only under
  the circumstances it was a little difficult.' Straight as anything. I didn't
  'ardly say anything to 'er. I didn't seem to begin to take it in until she
  was showing me out. I 'adn't anything to say. Jest as well, perhaps. She
  talked&mdash;like a Call a'most. She said&mdash;what was it she said about
  her mother?&mdash;'My mother's overcome with grief,' she said, 'so naturally
  everything comes on me."</p>

  <p>'And she told you to get some one to 'elp you?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I been to old Bean.'</p>

  <p>'O' Bean?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. What I took my business away from!'</p>

  <p>'What did he say?'</p>

  <p>'He was a bit off 'and at first, but then 'e come round. He couldn't tell
  me anything till 'e knew the facts. What I know of young Walshingham, there
  won't be much 'elp in the facts. No!'</p>

  <p>He reflected for a space. 'It's a Smash-up, Ann. More likely than not,
  Ann&mdash;'e's left us over'ead in debt. We got to get out of it just 'ow we
  can...</p>

  <p>'We got to begin again,' he went on. "Ow, I don't know. All the way 'ome-
  -my 'ead's been going. We got to get a living some'ow or other. 'Aving time
  to ourselves, and a bit of money to spend, and no hurry and worry; it's all
  over for ever, Ann. We was fools, Ann. We didn't know our benefits. We been
  caught. Gord!&mdash;Gord!'</p>

  <p>He was on the verge of 'banging about' again.</p>

  <p>They heard a jingle in the passage, the large, soft impact of a servant's
  indoor boots. As if she were a part, a mitigatory part of Fate, came
  Gwendolen to lay the midday meal. Kipps displayed self-control forthwith. Ann
  picked up the bib again and bent over it, and the Kippses bore themselves
  gloomily, perhaps, but not despairfully, while their dependent was in the
  room. She spread the cloth and put out the cutlery with a slow inaccuracy,
  and Kipps, after a whisper to himself, went again to the window. Ann got up
  and put away her work methodically in the chiffonier.</p>

  <p>'When I think,' said Kipps, as soon as the door closed again behind
  Gwendolen&mdash;'when I think of the 'ole people, and 'aving to tell 'em of
  it all, I want to smesh my 'ead against the nearest wall. Smesh my silly
  brains out! And Buggins&mdash;Buggins, what I'd arf promised to start in a
  lil' outfitting shop in Rendezvous Street...'</p>

  <p>Gwendolen returned, and restored dignity.</p>

  <p>The midday meal spread itself slowly before them. Gwendolen, after her
  custom, left the door open, and Kipps closed it carefully before sitting
  down.</p>

  <p>He stood for a moment, regarding the meal doubtfully. 'I don't feel as if
  I could swaller a moufful,' he said. 'You got to eat,' said Ann...</p>

  <p>For a time they said little, and once swallowing was achieved, ate on with
  a sort of melancholy appetite. Each was now busy thinking.</p>

  <p>'After all,' said Kipps, presently, 'whatever 'appens they can't turn us
  out or sell us up before nex' quarter day. I'm pretty sure about that.'</p>

  <p>'Sell us up!' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'I dessay we're bankrup',' said Kipps, trying to say it easily, and
  helping himself with a trembling hand to unnecessary potatoes.</p>

  <p>Then a long silence. Ann ceased to eat, and there were silent tears. 'More
  potatoes, Artie?' choked Ann.</p>

  <p>'I couldn't,' said Kipps. 'No.'</p>

  <p>He pushed back his plate, which was indeed replete with potatoes, got up
  and walked about the room. Even the dinner-table looked distraught and
  unusual.</p>

  <p>'What to do, I don't know,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Oh, Lord!' he ejaculated, and picked up and slapped down a book.</p>

  <p>Then his eye fell upon another post card that had come from Chitterlow by
  the morning's post, and which now lay by him on the mantelshelf. He took it
  up, glanced at its imperfectly legible message, and put it down.</p>

  <p>'Delayed!' he said scornfully. 'Not produced in the smalls. Or is it
  smells 'e says? 'Ow can one understand that? Any'ow, 'e's 'umbugging again.
  Somefing about the Strand. No!...Well, 'e's 'ad all the money 'e'll ever get
  out of me!...I'm done.'</p>

  <p>He seemed to find a momentary relief in the dramatic effect of his
  announcement. He came near to a swagger of despair upon the hearthrug, and
  then suddenly came and sat down next to Ann, and rested his chin on the
  knuckles of his two clenched hands.</p>

  <p>'I been a fool, Ann,' he said in a gloomy monotone. 'I been a brasted
  fool. But it's 'ard on us, all the same. It's 'ard.'</p>

  <p>"Ow was you to know?' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'I ought to 'ave known. I did in a sort of way know. And 'ere we are! I
  wouldn't care so much if it was myself, but it's you, Ann! 'Ere we are!
  Regular smashed up! And you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He checked at an unspeakable aggravation of their disaster. 'I knew 'e
  wasn't to be depended upon, and there I left it! And you got pay...What's to
  'appen to us all, I don't know.'</p>

  <p>He thrust out his chin and glared at fate.</p>

  <p>"Ow do you know 'e's specklated everything?' said Ann, after a silent
  survey of him. "E 'as,' said Kipps, irritably, holding firm to disaster.</p>

  <p>'She say so?'</p>

  <p>'She don't know, of course; but you depend upon it, that's it. She told me
  she knew something was on, and when she found 'im gone and a note lef for
  her, she knew it was up with 'im. 'E went by the night boat. She wrote that
  telegrarf off to me straight away.'</p>

  <p>Ann surveyed his features with tender, perplexed eyes; she had never seen
  him so white and drawn before, and her hand rested an inch or so away from
  his arm. The actual loss was still, as it were, afar from her. The immediate
  thing was his enormous distress.</p>

  <p>"Ow do you know&mdash;?' she said, and stopped. It would irritate him too
  much. Kipps' imagination was going headlong.</p>

  <p>'Sold up!' he emitted presently, and Ann flinched.</p>

  <p>'Going back to work, day after day. I can't stand it, Ann, I can't. And
  you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It don't do to think of it,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>Presently he came upon a resolve. 'I keep on thinking of it, and thinking
  of it, and what's to be done, and what's to be done. I shan't be any good
  'ome's'arfernoon. It keeps on going round and round in my 'ead, and round and
  round. I better go for a walk or something. I'd be no comfort to you, Ann. I
  should want to 'owl and 'ammer things if I 'ung about 'ome. My fingers 'r all
  atwitch. I shall keep on thinking 'ow I might 'ave stopped it, and callin'
  myself a fool...'</p>

  <p>He looked at her between pleading and shame. It seemed like deserting her.
  Ann regarded him with tear-dimmed eyes.</p>

  <p>'You'd better do what's good for you, Artie,' she said...'I'll be best
  cleaning. It's no use sending off Gwendolen before her month, and the top
  room wants turning out.' She added with a sort of grim humour, 'May as well
  turn it out now while I got it.'</p>

  <p>'I better go for a walk,' said Kipps...</p>

  <p>And presently our poor, exploded Kipps was marching out to bear his sudden
  misery. Habit turned him up the road towards his growing house, and then
  suddenly he perceived his direction&mdash;'Oh, Lor!'&mdash;and turned aside
  and went up the steep way to the hill-crest and the Sandling Road, and over
  the line by that tree-embowered Junction, and athwart the wide fields towards
  Postling&mdash;a little, black, marching figure&mdash;and so up the Downs and
  over the hills, whither he had never gone before...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">He came back long after dark, and Ann met him in the
passage. 'Where you
  been, Artie?' she asked, with a strained note in her voice.</p>

  <p>'I been walking and walking&mdash;trying to tire myself out. All the time
  I been thinking, what shall I do? Trying to fix something up, all out of
  nothing.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't know you meant to be out all this time.'</p>

  <p>Kipps was gripped by compunction...</p>

  <p>'I can't think what we ought to do,' he said presently.</p>

  <p>'You can't do anything much, Artie, not till you hear from Mr. Bean.'</p>

  <p>'No. I can't do anything much. That's jest it. And all this time I keep
  feelin' if I don't do something the top of my 'ead'll bust...Been trying to
  make up advertisements 'arf the time I been out&mdash;'bout finding a place;
  good salesman and stockkeeper, good Manchester dresses, window-
  dressing&mdash;Lor! Fancy that all beginning again!...If you went to stay
  with Sid a bit&mdash;If I sent every penny I got to you&mdash;I dunno! I
  dunno!'</p>

  <p>When they had gone to bed there was an elaborate attempt to get to
  sleep...In one of their great waking pauses Kipps remarked in a muffled tone,
  'I didn't mean to frighten you, Ann, being out so late. I kep' on walking and
  walking, and some 'ow it seemed to do me good. I went out to the 'ill-top
  ever so far beyond Stanford, and sat there ever so long, and it seemed to
  make me better. Jest looking over the marsh like, and seeing the
  sunset...'</p>

  <p>'Very likely,' said Ann, after a long interval, 'it isn't so bad as you
  think it is, Artie.'</p>

  <p>'It's bad,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>'Very likely, after all, it isn't quite so bad. If there's only a
  little&mdash;'</p>

  <p>There came another long silence.</p>

  <p>'Ann,' said Kipps, in the quiet darkness.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Ann,' said Kipps, and stopped as though he had hastily shut a door upon
  speech.</p>

  <p>'I kep' thinking,' he said, trying again&mdash;'kep' thinking, after all,
  I been cross to you and a fool about things&mdash;about them cards,
  Ann&mdash;but'&mdash;his voice shook to pieces&mdash;'we 'ave been 'appy,
  Ann...some'ow...togever.'</p>

  <p>And with that he and then she fell into a passion of weeping.</p>

  <p>They clung very tightly together&mdash;closer than they had been since
  ever the first brightness of their married days turned to the gray of common
  life again...</p>

  <p>All the disaster in the world could not prevent their going to sleep at
  last with their poor little troubled heads close together on one pillow.
  There was nothing more to be done; there was nothing more to be thought. Time
  might go on with his mischiefs, but for a little while at least they still
  had one another.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Kipps returned from his second interview with Mr. Bean in a
state of
  strange excitement. He let himself in with his latchkey and slammed the door.
  'Ann!' he shouted, in an unusual note; 'Ann!'</p>

  <p>Ann replied distantly.</p>

  <p>'Something to tell you,' said Kipps; 'something noo!' Ann appeared
  apprehensive from the kitchen.</p>

  <p>'Ann,' he said, going before her into the little dining-room, for his news
  was too dignified for the passage, 'very likely, Ann, o' Bean says, we shall
  'ave&mdash;' He decided to prolong the suspense. 'Guess!'</p>

  <p>'I can't, Artie.'</p>

  <p>'Think of a lot of money!'</p>

  <p>'A 'undred pounds p'r'aps?'</p>

  <p>He spoke with immense deliberation. 'Over a fousand pounds!' Ann stared
  and said nothing, only went a shade whiter. 'Over,' he said. 'A'most
  certainly over.'</p>

  <p>He shut the dining-room door and came forward hastily, for Ann, it was
  clear, meant to take this mitigation of their disaster with a complete
  abandonment of her self-control. She came near flopping; she fell into his
  arms.</p>

  <p>'Artie,' she got to at last, and began to weep, clinging tightly to him.
  'Pretty near certain,' said Kipps, holding her. 'A fousand pounds!'</p>

  <p>'I said, Artie,' she wailed on his shoulder with the note of accumulated
  wrongs, 'very likely it wasn't so bad&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'There's things,' he said, when presently he came to particulars, "e
  couldn't touch. The noo place! It's freehold and paid for, and with the bit
  of building on it, there's five or six 'undred pounds p'r'aps&mdash;say worf
  free 'undred for safety.</p>

  <p>We can't be sold up to finish it, like we thought. O' Bean says we can
  very likely sell it and get money. 'E says you often get a chance to sell a
  'ouse lessen 'arf done, specially free-old. Very likely, 'e says. Then
  there's Hughenden. Hughenden 'asn't been mortgaged not for more than 'arf its
  value. There's a 'undred or so to be got on that, and the furniture, and the
  rent for the summer still coming in. 'E says there's very likely other
  things. A fousand pounds; that's what 'e said. 'E said it might even be
  more...'</p>

  <p>They were sitting now at the table. 'It alters everything,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'I been thinking that, Ann, all the way 'ome. I came in the motor-car.
  First ride I've had since the Smash. We needn't send off Gwendolen;
  leastways, not till after. You know. We needn't turn out of 'ere&mdash;not
  for a long time. What we been doing for the o' people we can go on doing
  a'most as much. And your mother!...I wanted to 'oller, coming along. I pretty
  near run coming down the road by the Hotel.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I am glad we can stop 'ere and be comfortable a bit,' said Ann. 'I am
  glad for that.'</p>

  <p>'I pretty near told the driver on the motor&mdash;only 'e was the sort
  won't talk&mdash;You see, Ann, we'll be able to start a shop, we'll be able
  to get into something like. All about our 'aving to go back to places and
  that&mdash;all that doesn't matter any more.'</p>

  <p>For a while they abandoned themselves to ejaculating transports. Then they
  fell talking to shape an idea to themselves of the new prospect that opened
  before them.</p>

  <p>'We must start a sort of shop,' said Kipps, whose imagination had been
  working. 'It'll 'ave to be a shop.'</p>

  <p>'Drapery?' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'You want such a lot of capital for the drapery; mor'n a thousand pounds
  you want by a long way&mdash;to start it anything like proper.'</p>

  <p>'Well, outfitting. Like Buggins was going to do.'</p>

  <p>Kipps glanced at that for a moment, because the idea had not occurred to
  him. Then he came back to his prepossession.</p>

  <p>'Well, I thought of something else, Ann,' he said. 'You see, I've always
  thought a little bookshop&mdash;It isn't like drapery&mdash;'aving to be
  learnt. I thought even before this Smash Up, 'ow I'd like to 'ave something
  to do, instead of always 'aving 'olidays always like we 'ave been
  'aving.'</p>

  <p>She reflected.</p>

  <p>'You don't know much about books, do you, Artie?'</p>

  <p>'You don't want to.' He illustrated. 'I noticed when we used to go to that
  Lib'ry at Folkestone, ladies weren't anything like what they was in a
  draper's&mdash;if you 'aven't got just what they want, it's 'Oh, no!' and out
  they go.</p>

  <p>But in a bookshop it's different. One book's very like another&mdash;after
  all, what is it? Something to read and done with. It's not a thing that
  matters like print dresses or serviettes&mdash;where you either like 'em or
  don't, and people judge you by. They take what you give 'em in books and
  lib'ries, and glad to be told what to. See 'ow we was&mdash;up at that
  lib'ry...'</p>

  <p>He paused. 'You see, Ann&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Well, I read 'n 'dvertisement the other day&mdash;I been asking Mr. Bean.
  It said&mdash;five 'undred pounds.'</p>

  <p>'What did?'</p>

  <p>'Branches,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>Ann failed to understand. 'It's a sort of thing that gets up bookshops all
  over the country,' said Kipps. 'I didn't tell you, but I arst about it a bit.
  On'y I dropped it again. Before this Smash, I mean. I'd thought I'd like to
  keep a shop for a lark, on'y then I thought it silly. Besides, it 'ud 'ave
  been beneath me.'</p>

  <p>He blushed vividly. 'It was a sort of projek of mine, Ann. 'On'y it
  wouldn't 'ave done,' he added.</p>

  <p>It was a tortuous journey when the Kippses set out to explain anything to
  each other. But through a maze of fragmentary elucidations and questions,
  their minds did presently begin to approximate to a picture of a compact,
  bright little shop, as a framework for themselves.</p>

  <p>'I thought of it one day when I was in Folkestone. I thought of it one day
  when I was looking in at a window. I see a chap dressin' a window, and he was
  whistlin', reg'lar light-hearted...I thought&mdash;I'd like to keep a
  bookshop any'ow, jest for something to do. And when people weren't about,
  then you could sit and read the books. See? It wouldn't be arf bad...'</p>

  <p>They mused, each with elbows on table and knuckles to lips, looking with
  speculative eyes at each other. 'Very likely we'll be 'appier than we
  should've been with more money' said Kipps, presently. 'We wasn't 'ardly
  suited&mdash;' reflected Ann, and left her sentence incomplete.</p>

  <p>'Fish out of water like,' said Kipps&mdash;</p>

  <p>'You won't 'ave to return that call now,' said Kipps, opening a new branch
  of the question. 'That's one good thing.'</p>

  <p>'Lor!' said Ann, 'no more I shan't!'</p>

  <p>'I don't s'pose they'd want you to even if you did&mdash;with things as
  they are.'</p>

  <p>A certain added brightness came into Ann's face. 'Nobody won't be able to
  come leaving cards on us, Artie, now, any more. We are out of that!'</p>

  <p>There isn't no necessity for us to be Stuck Up,' said Kipps, 'any more for
  ever! 'Ere we are, Ann, common people, with jest no position at all, as you
  might say, to keep up. No se'v'nts, not if you don't like. No dressin' better
  than other people. If it wasn't we been robbed&mdash;dashed if I'd care a rap
  about losing that money. I b'lieve'&mdash;his face shone with the rare
  pleasure of paradox&mdash;'I reely b'lieve, Ann, it'll prove a savin' in the
  end.'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">The remarkable advertisement which had fired Kipps'
imagination with this
  dream of a bookshop opened out in the most alluring way. It was one little
  facet in a comprehensive scheme of transatlantic origin, which was to make
  our old-world methods of bookselling 'sit up,' and it displayed an
  imaginative briskness, a lucidity and promise, that aroused the profoundest
  scepticism in the mind of Mr. Bean. To Kipps' renewed investigations it
  presented itself in an expository illustrated pamphlet (far too well printed,
  Mr. Bean thought, for a reputable undertaking) of the most convincing sort.
  Mr. Bean would not let him sink his capital in shares in its projected
  company that was to make all things new in the world of books, but he could
  not prevent Kipps becoming one of their associated booksellers. And so, when
  presently it became apparent that an Epoch was not to be made, and the
  'Associated Booksellers' Trading Union (Limited)' receded and dissolved and
  liquidated (a few drops) and vanished and went away to talk about something
  else, Kipps remained floating undamaged in this interestingly uncertain
  universe as an independent bookseller.</p>

  <p>Except that it failed, the Associated Booksellers' Trading Union had all
  the stigmata of success. Its fault, perhaps, was that it had them all instead
  of only one or two. It was to buy wholesale for all its members and
  associates and exchange stock, having a common books-in-stock list and a
  common lending library, and it was to provide a uniform registered shop-front
  to signify these things to the intelligent passer-by. Except that it was
  controlled by buoyant young Overmen, with a touch of genius in their
  arithmetic, it was, I say, a most plausible and hopeful project. Kipps went
  several times to London, and an agent came to Hythe, Mr. Bean made some
  timely interventions, and then behind a veil of planks and an announcement in
  the High Street, the uniform registered shop-front came rapidly into being.
  'Associated Booksellers' Trading Union,' said this shop-front, in a refined
  artistic lettering that bookbuyers were going to value, as wise men over
  forty value the proper label for Berncasteler Doctor, and then, 'Arthur
  Kipps.'</p>

  <p>Next to starting a haberdasher's shop, I doubt if Kipps could have been
  more truly happy than during those weeks of preparation.</p>

  <p>There is, of course, nothing on earth, and I doubt at times if there is a
  joy in heaven, like starting a small haberdasher's shop. Imagine, for
  example, having a drawerful of tapes (one whole piece most exquisitely
  blocked) of every possible width of tape, or again, an army of neat, large
  packages, each displaying one sample of hooks and eyes. Think of your
  cottons, your drawer of coloured silks, the little, less, of the compartments
  and thin packets of your needle-drawer! Poor princes and wretched gentlefolk,
  mysteriously above retail trade, may taste only the faint unsatisfactory
  shadow of these delights with trays of stamps or butterflies. I write, of
  course, for those to whom these things appeal; there are clods alive who see
  nothing, or next to nothing, in spools of mercerised cotton and endless bands
  of paper-set pins. I write for the wise, and as I write I wonder that Kipps
  resisted haberdashery. He did. Yet even starting a bookshop is at least
  twenty times as interesting as building your own house to your own design in
  unlimited space and time, or any possible thing people with indisputable
  social position and sound securities can possibly find to do. Upon that I
  rest.</p>

  <p>You figure Kipps 'going to have a look to see how the little shop is
  getting on,' the shop that is not to be a loss and a spending of money, but a
  gain. He does not walk too fast towards it; as he comes into view of it his
  paces slacken and his head goes to one side. He crosses to the pavement
  opposite in order to inspect the fascia better; already his name is
  adumbrated in faint white lines; stops in the middle of the road and
  scrutinises imaginary details, for the benefit of his future next-door
  neighbour, the curiosity-shop man, and so at last, in...A smell of paint and
  of the shavings of imperfectly seasoned pinewood! The shop is already glazed,
  and a carpenter is busy over the fittings for adjustable shelves in the side
  windows. A painter is busy on the fixtures round about (shelving above and
  drawers below), which are to accommodate most of the stock, and the
  counter&mdash;the counter and desk are done. Kipps goes inside the desk, the
  desk which is to be the strategic centre of the shop, brushes away some
  sawdust, and draws out the marvellous till; here gold is to be, here silver,
  here copper&mdash;notes locked up in a cashbox in the well below. Then he
  leans his elbows on the desk, rests his chin on his fist and fills the
  shelves with imaginary stock; books beyond reading. Every day a man who cares
  to wash his hands and read uncut pages artfully may have his cake and eat it,
  among that stock. Under the counter to the right paper and string are to
  lurk, ready to leap up and embrace goods sold; on the table to the left, art
  publications&mdash;whatever they may prove to be. He maps it out, serves an
  imaginary customer, receives a dream seven-and-sixpence, packs, bows out. He
  wonders how it was he ever came to fancy a shop a disagreeable place.</p>

  <p>'It's different,' he says at last, after musing on that difficulty, 'being
  your own.' It is different...</p>

  <p>Or, again, you figure Kipps with something of the air of a young
  sacristan, handling his brightly virginal account books, and looking and
  looking again, and then still looking, at an unparalleled specimen of
  copperplate engraving, ruled money below, and above bearing the words, 'In
  Account with ARTHUR KIPPS (loud flourishes), The Booksellers' Trading Union'
  (temperate decoration). You figure Ann sitting and stitching at one point of
  the circumference of the light of the lamp, stitching queer little garments
  for some unknown stranger and over against her sits Kipps. Before him is one
  of those engraved memorandum forms, a moist pad, wet with some thick and
  greasy, greenish-purple ink, that is also spreading quietly but steadily over
  his fingers, a cross-nibbed pen for first-aid surgical assistance to the
  patient in his hand, a dating rubber stamp. At intervals he brings down this
  latter with great care and emphasis upon the paper, and when he lifts it
  there appears a beautiful oval design, of which 'Paid, Arthur Kipps. The
  Associated Booksellers' Trading Union,' and a date, are the essential
  ingredients, stamped in purple ink.</p>

  <p>Anon he turns his attention to a box of small, round, yellow labels,
  declaring. 'This book was bought from the Associated Booksellers' Trading
  Union.' He licks one with deliberate care, sticks it on the paper before him
  and defaces it with great solemnity. 'I can do it, Ann,' he says, looking up
  brightly. For the Associated Booksellers' Trading Union, among other
  brilliant notions and inspirations, devised an ingenious system of taking
  back its books again in part payment for new ones within a specified period.
  When it failed, all sorts of people were left with these unredeemed pledges
  in hand.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Amidst all this bustle and interest, all this going to and
fro before they
  'moved in' to the High Street, came the great crisis that hung over the
  Kippses, and one morning in the small hours Ann's child was born...</p>

  <p>Kipps was coming to manhood swiftly now. The once rabbit-like soul that
  had been so amazed by the discovery of 'chubes' in the human interior and so
  shocked by the sight of a woman's shoulder-blades, that had found shame and
  anguish in a mislaid Gibus and terror in an Anagram Tea, was at last facing
  the greater realities. He came suddenly upon the master thing in
  life&mdash;birth. He passed through hours of listening, hours of impotent
  fear in the night and in the dawn, and then there was put into his arms
  something most wonderful, a weak and wailing creature, incredibly,
  heart-stirringly soft and pitiful, with minute appealing hands that it wrung
  his heart to see. He held it in his arms and touched its tender cheek as if
  he feared his lips might injure it. And this marvel was his Son!</p>

  <p>And there was Ann, with a greater strangeness and a greater familiarity in
  her quality than he had ever found before. There were little beads of
  perspiration on her temples and her lips, and her face was flushed, not pale,
  as he had feared to see it. She had the look of one who emerges from some
  strenuous and invigorating act. He bent down and kissed her, and he had no
  words to say. She wasn't to speak much yet, but she stroked his arm with her
  hand and had to tell him one thing.</p>

  <p>'He's over nine pounds, Artie,' she whispered. 'Bessie's&mdash;Bessie's
  wasn't no more than eight.'</p>

  <p>To have given Kipps a pound of triumph over Sid seemed to her almost to
  justify Nunc Dimittis. She watched his face for a moment, then closed her
  eyes in a kind of blissful exhaustion as the nurse, with something motherly
  in her manner, pushed Kipps out of the room.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Kipps was far too much preoccupied with his own life to
worry about the
  further exploits of Chitterlow. The man had got his two thousand; on the
  whole, Kipps was glad he had it rather than young Walshingham, and there was
  an end to the matter. As for the complicated transactions he achieved and
  proclaimed by mainly illegible and always incomprehensible post cards, they
  were like passing voices heard in the street as one goes about one's urgent
  concerns. Kipps put them aside, and they got in between the pages of the
  stock and were lost for ever, and sold with the goods to customers, who
  puzzled over them mightily.</p>

  <p>Then one morning as our bookseller was dusting round before breakfast,
  Chitterlow returned, appeared suddenly in the shop doorway.</p>

  <p>It was the most unexpected thing in the world. The man was in evening
  dress, evening dress in that singularly crumpled state it assumes after the
  hour of dawn, and above his dishevelled red hair a smallish Gibus had tilted
  remarkably forward. He opened the door and stood tall and spread, with one
  vast white glove flung out, as if to display how burst a glove might be, his
  eyes bright, such wrinkling of brow and mouth as only an experienced actor
  can produce, and a singular radiance of emotion upon his whole being&mdash;an
  altogether astonishing spectacle.</p>

  <p>The bell jangled for a bit, and then gave it up and was silent. For a
  long, long second everything was quietly attentive. Kipps was amazed to his
  uttermost; had he had ten times the capacity, he would still have been fully
  amazed. 'It's Chit'low!' he said at last, standing duster in hand.</p>

  <p>But he doubted whether it was not a dream.</p>

  <p>'Tzit!' gasped that most extraordinary person, still in an incredibly
  expanded attitude, and then with a slight forward jerk of the starry split
  glove, 'Bif!'</p>

  <p>He could say no more. The tremendous speech he had had ready vanished from
  his mind. Kipps stared at his facial changes, vaguely conscious of the truth
  of the teachings of Nisbet and Lombroso concerning men of genius.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly Chitterlow's features were convulsed, the histrionic fell
  from him like a garment, and he was weeping. He said something indistinct
  about 'Old Kipps! Good old Kipps! Oh, old Kipps!' and somehow he managed to
  mix a chuckle and a sob in the most remarkable way. He emerged from somewhere
  near the middle of his original attitude, a merely lifesize creature. 'My
  play, boohoo!' he sobbed, clutching at his friend's arm. 'My play, Kipps!
  (sob). You know?'</p>

  <p>'Well?' cried Kipps, with his heart sinking in sympathy. 'It
  ain't&mdash;?'</p>

  <p>'No,' howled Chitterlow. 'No. It's a Success! My dear chap! my dear boy!
  Oh! It's a&mdash;Bu&mdash;boohoo!&mdash;a Big Success!' He turned away and
  wiped streaming tears with the back of his hand. He walked a pace or so and
  turned. He sat down on one of the specially designed artistic chairs of the
  Associated Booksellers' Trading Union and produced an exiguous lady's
  handkerchief, extraordinarily belaced. He choked. 'My play,' and covered his
  face here and there.</p>

  <p>He made an unsuccessful effort to control himself, and shrank for a space
  to the dimensions of a small and pathetic creature. His great nose suddenly
  came through a careless place in the handkerchief.</p>

  <p>I'm knocked,' he said in a muffled voice, and so remained for a
  space&mdash;wonderful&mdash;veiled.</p>

  <p>He made a gallant effort to wipe his tears away. 'I had to tell you,' he
  said, gulping.</p>

  <p>'Be all right in a minute,' he added, 'Calm!' and sat still&mdash;</p>

  <p>Kipps stared in commiseration of such success. Then he heard footsteps,
  and went quickly to the house doorway. 'Jest a minute,' he said. 'Don't go in
  the shop, Ann, for a minute. It's Chitterlow. He's a bit essited. But he'll
  be better in a minute. It's knocked him over a bit. You see'&mdash;his voice
  sank to a hushed note as one who announces death&mdash;"e's made a success
  with his play.'</p>

  <p>He pushed her back, lest she should see the scandal of another male's
  tears...</p>

  <p>Soon Chitterlow felt better, but for a little while his manner was even
  alarmingly subdued. 'I had to come and tell you,' he said. 'I had to astonish
  some one. Muriel&mdash;she'll be first-rate, of course. But she's over at
  Dymchurch.' He blew his nose with enormous noise, and emerged instantly, a
  merely garrulous optimist.</p>

  <p>'I expect she'll be precious glad.'</p>

  <p>'She doesn't know yet, my dear boy. She's at Dymchurch&mdash;with a
  friend. She's seen some of my first nights before...Better out of it...I'm
  going to her now. I've been up all night&mdash;talking to the Boys and all
  that. I'm a bit off it just for a bit. But&mdash;it Knocked 'em. It Knocked
  everybody.'</p>

  <p>He stared at the floor and went on in a monotone. 'They laughed a bit at
  the beginning&mdash;but nothing like a settled laugh&mdash;not until the
  second act&mdash;you know&mdash;the chap with the beetle down his neck.
  Little Chisholme did that bit to rights. Than they began&mdash;to rights.'
  His voice warmed and increased. 'Laughing! It made me laugh! We jumped 'em
  into the third act before they had time to cool. Everybody was on it. I never
  saw a first night go so fast. Laugh, laugh, laugh, LAUGH, LAUGH, LAUGH' (he
  howled the last repetition with stupendous violence). 'Everything they
  laughed at. They laughed at things that we hadn't meant to be funny&mdash;not
  for one moment. Bif! Bizz! Curtain. A Fair Knock Out!&mdash;I went
  on&mdash;but I didn't say a word. Chisholme did the patter. Shouting! It was
  like walking under Niagara&mdash;going across that stage. It was like never
  having seen an audience before&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Then afterwards&mdash;the Boys!'</p>

  <p>His emotion held him for a space. 'Dear old Boys!' he murmured.</p>

  <p>His words multiplied, his importance increased. In a little while he was
  restored to something of his old self. He was enormously excited. He seemed
  unable to sit down anywhere. He came into the breakfast-room so soon as Kipps
  was sure of him, shook hands with Mrs. Kipps parenthetically, sat down and
  immediately got up again. He went to the bassinet in the corner and looked
  absent-mindedly at Kipps junior, and said he was glad if only for the
  youngster's sake. He immediately resumed the thread of his discourse...He
  drank a cup of coffee noisily and walked up and down the room talking, while
  they attempted breakfast amidst the gale of his excitement. The infant slept
  marvellously through it all.</p>

  <p>'You won't mind my not sitting down, Mrs Kipps&mdash;I couldn't sit down
  for any one, or I'd do it for you. It's you I'm thinking of more than any
  one, you and Muriel, and all Old Pals and Good Friends. It means wealth, it
  means money&mdash;hundreds and thousands...If you'd heard 'em you'd
  know.'</p>

</div>

  <p>He was silent through a portentous moment, while topics battled for him,
  and finally he burst and talked of them all together. It was like the rush of
  water when a dam bursts and washes out a fair-sized provincial town; all
  sorts of things floated along on the swirl. For example, he was discussing
  his future behaviour. 'I'm glad it's come now. Not before. I've had my
  lesson. I shall be very discreet now, trust me. We've learnt the value of
  money.' He discussed the possibility of a country house, of taking a Martello
  tower as a swimming-box (as one might say a shooting-box), of living in
  Venice because of its artistic associations and scenic possibilities, of a
  flat in Westminster or a house in the West End. He also raised the question
  of giving up smoking and drinking, and what classes of drink were especially
  noxious to a man of his constitution. But discourses on all this did not
  prevent a parenthetical computation of the probable profits on the
  supposition of a thousand nights here and in America, nor did it ignore the
  share Kipps was to have, nor the gladness with which Chitterlow would pay
  that share, nor the surprise and regret with which he had learnt, through an
  indirect source which had awakened many associations, of the turpitude of
  young Walshingham, nor the distaste Chitterlow had always felt for young
  Walshingham, and men of his type. An excursus upon Napoleon had got into the
  torrent somehow, and kept bobbing up and down. The whole thing was thrown
  into the form of a single complex sentence, with parenthetical and
  subordinate clauses fitting one into the other like Chinese boxes, and from
  first to last it never even had an air of approaching anything in the
  remotest degree partaking of the nature of a full stop.</p>

  <p>Into this deluge came the Daily News, like the gleam of light in Watts'
  picture, the waters were assuaged while its sheet was opened, and it had a
  column, a whole column of praise. Chitterlow held the paper, and Kipps read
  over his left hand, and Ann under his right. It made the affair more real to
  Kipps; it seemed even to confirm Chitterlow against lurking doubts he had
  been concealing. But it took him away. He departed in a whirl, to secure a
  copy of every morning paper, every blessed rag there is, and take them all to
  Dymchurch and Muriel forthwith. It had been the send-off the Boys had given
  him that had prevented his doing as much at Charing Cross&mdash;let alone
  that he only caught it by the skin of his teeth...Besides which, the
  bookstall wasn't open. His white face, lit by a vast excitement, bid them a
  tremendous farewell, and he departed through the sunlight, with his buoyant
  walk, buoyant almost to the tottering pitch. His hair, as one got it sunlit
  in the street, seemed to have grown in the night.</p>

  <p>They saw him stop a newsboy.</p>

  <p>'Every blessed rag,' floated to them on the notes of that gorgeous
  voice.</p>

  <p>The newsboy, too, had happened on luck. Something like a faint cheer from
  the newsboy came down the air to terminate that transaction.</p>

  <p>Chitterlow went on his way swinging a great budget of papers, a figure of
  merited success. The newsboy recovered from his emotion with a jerk, examined
  something in his hand again, transferred it to his pocket, watched Chitterlow
  for a space, and then in a sort of hushed silence resumed his daily
  routine...</p>

  <p>Ann and Kipps regarded that receding happiness in silence, until it
  vanished round the bend of the road. 'I am glad,' said Ann at last, speaking
  with a little sigh.</p>

  <p>'So'm I,' said Kipps, with emphasis. 'For if ever a feller 'as worked and
  waited&mdash;it's 'im...'</p>

  <p>They went back through the shop rather thoughtfully and, after a peep at
  the sleeping baby, resumed their interrupted breakfast. 'If ever a feller 'as
  worked and waited, it's 'im,' said Kipps, cutting bread.</p>

  <p>'Very likely it's true,' said Ann, a little wistfully. 'What's true?'</p>

  <p>'About all that money coming.'</p>

  <p>Kipps meditated. 'I don't see why it shouldn't be,' he decided, and handed
  Ann a piece of bread on the tip of his knife.</p>

  <p>'But we'll keep on the shop,' he said, after an interval for further
  reflection, 'all the same...I 'aven't much trust in money after the things
  we've seen.'</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">That was two years ago, and, as the whole world knows, the
Pestered
  Butterfly is running still. It was true. It has made the fortune of a once
  declining little theatre in the Strand; night after night the great beetle
  scene draws happy tears from a house packed to repletion, and Kipps&mdash;for
  all that Chitterlow is not what one might call a business man&mdash;is almost
  as rich as he was in the beginning. People in Australia, people in
  Lancashire, Scotland, Ireland, in New Orleans, in Jamaica, in New York, and
  Montreal, have crowded through doorways to Kipps' enrichment, lured by the
  hitherto unsuspected humours of the entomological drama. Wealth rises like an
  exhalation all over our little planet, and condenses, or at least some of it
  does, in the pockets of Kipps.</p>

  <p>'It's rum,' said Kipps.</p>

  <p>He sat in the little kitchen out behind the bookshop and philosophised and
  smiled while Ann gave Arthur Waddy Kipps his evening tub before the fire.
  Kipps was always present at this ceremony, unless customers prevented; there
  was something in the mixture of the odours of tobacco, soap, and domesticity
  that charmed him unspeakably.</p>

  <p>'Chuckerdee, o' man,' he said affably, wagging his pipe at his son, and
  thought incidentally, after the manner of all parents, that very few children
  could have so straight and clean a body.</p>

  <p>'Dadda's got a cheque,' said Arthur Waddy Kipps, emerging for a moment
  from the towel. "E gets 'old of everything,' said Ann. 'You can't say a
  word&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Dadda got a cheque,' this marvellous child repeated.</p>

  <p>'Yes, o' man, I got a cheque. And it's got to go into a bank for you,
  against when you got to go to school. See? So's you'll grow up knowing your
  way about a bit.'</p>

  <p>'Dadda's got a cheque,' said the wonder son, and then gave his mind to
  making mighty splashes with his foot. Every time he splashed, laughter
  overcame him, and he had to be held up for fear he should tumble out of the
  tub in his merriment. Finally he was towelled to his toe-tips, wrapped up in
  warm flannel and kissed and carried off to bed by Ann's cousin and lady help,
  Emma. And then after Ann had carried away the bath into the scullery, she
  returned to find her husband with his pipe extinct and the cheque still in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>'Two fousand pounds,' he said. 'It's dashed rum. Wot 'ave I done to get
  two fousand pounds, Ann?'</p>

  <p>'What 'aven't you&mdash;not to?' said Ann.</p>

  <p>He reflected upon this view of the case.</p>

  <p>'I shan't never give up this shop,' he said at last.</p>

  <p>'We're very 'appy 'ere,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'Not if I 'ad fifty fousand pounds.'</p>

  <p>'No fear,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'You got a shop,' said Kipps, 'and you come along in a year's time and
  there it is. But money&mdash;look 'ow it comes and goes! There's no sense in
  money. You may kill yourself trying to get it, and then it comes when you
  aren't looking. There's my 'riginal money! Where is it now? Gone! And it's
  took young Walshingham with it, and 'e's gone, too. It's like playing
  skittles. 'Long comes the ball, right and left you fly, and there it is
  rolling away and not changed a bit. No sense in it. 'E's gone, and she's
  gone&mdash;gone off with that chap Revel, that sat with me at dinner. Merried
  man! And Chit'low rich! Lor!&mdash;what a fine place that Gerrik Club is to
  be sure! where I 'ad lunch wiv' 'im! Better'n any 'otel. Footmen in powder
  they got&mdash;not waiters, Ann&mdash;footmen! 'E's rich and me rich&mdash;in
  a sort of way...Don't seem much sense in it, Ann&mdash;'owever you look at
  it.' He shook his head.</p>

  <p>'I know one thing.' said Kipps. 'What?'</p>

  <p>'I'm going to put it in jest as many different banks as I can. See? Fifty
  'ere, fifty there. 'Posit. I'm not going to 'nvest it&mdash;no fear.'</p>

  <p>'It's only frowing money away,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>'I'm arf a mind to bury some of it under the shop. Only I expect one 'ud
  always be coming down at nights to make sure it was there...I don't seem to
  trust any one&mdash;not with money.' He put the cheque on the table corner
  and smiled and tapped his pipe on the grate, with his eyes on that wonderful
  document. 'S'pose old Bean started orf,' he reflected...'One thing&mdash;'e
  is a bit lame.'</p>

  <p>"E wouldn't,' said Ann; 'not 'im.'</p>

  <p>'I was only joking like.' He stood up, put his pipe among the candlesticks
  on the mantel, took up the cheque and began folding it carefully to put it
  back in his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>A little bell jangled.</p>

  <p>'Shop!' said Kipps. 'That's right. Keep a shop and the shop'll keep you.
  That's 'ow I look at it, Ann.' He drove his pocket-book securely into his
  breast-pocket before he opened the living-room door...</p>

  <p>But whether, indeed, it is the bookshop that keeps Kipps or whether it is
  Kipps who keeps the bookshop, is just one of those commercial mysteries
  people of my unarithmetical temperament are never able to solve. They do very
  well, the dears, anyhow, thank Heaven!</p>

  <p>The bookshop of Kipps is on the left-hand side of the Hythe High Street
  coming from Folkestone, between the yard of the livery stable and the shop
  window full of old silver and suchlike things&mdash;it is quite easy to
  find&mdash;and there you may see him for yourself, and speak to him and buy
  this book of him if you like. He has it in stock, I know. Very delicately
  I've seen to that. His name is not Kipps, of course, you must understand
  that; but everything else is exactly as I have told you. You can talk to him
  about books, about politics, about going to Boulogne, about life, and the ups
  and downs of life. Perhaps he will quote you Buggins&mdash;from whom, by the
  bye, one can now buy everything a gentleman's wardrobe should contain at the
  little shop in Rendezvous Street, Folkestone. If you are fortunate to find
  Kipps in a good mood, he may even let you know how he inherited a fortune
  'once.' 'Run froo it,' he'll say with a not unhappy smile. 'Got another
  afterwards&mdash;speckylating in plays. Needn't keep this shop if I didn't
  like. But it's something to do...'</p>

  <p>Or he may be even more intimate. 'I seen some things,' he said to me once.
  'Raver! Life! Why, once I&mdash;I loped! I did&mdash;reely!'</p>

  <p>(Of course, you will not tell Kipps that he is 'Kipps,' or that I have put
  him in this book. He hasn't the remotest suspicion of that. And, you know,
  you never can tell how people are going to take sort of thing. I am an old
  and trusted customer now, and for many amiable reasons I should prefer that
  things remained exactly on their present footing.)</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">One early-closing evening in July they left the baby to the
servant
  cousin, and Kipps took Ann for a row on the Hythe canal. The sun set in a
  mighty blaze, and left a world warm, and very still. The twilight came. And
  there was the water, shinning bright, and the sky a deepening blue, and the
  great trees that dipped their boughs towards the water, exactly as it had
  been when he paddled home with Helen, when her eyes had seemed to him like
  dusky stars. He had ceased from rowing and rested on his oars, and suddenly
  he was touched by the wonder of life&mdash;the strangeness that is a presence
  stood again by his side.</p>

  <p>Out of the darkness beneath the shallow, weedy stream of his being rose a
  question, a question that looked up dimly and never reached the surface. It
  was the question of the wonder of the beauty, the purposeless, inconsecutive
  beauty, that falls so strangely among the happenings and memories of life. It
  never reached the surface of his mind, it never took to itself substance or
  form; it looked up merely as the phantom of a face might look, out of deep
  waters, and sank again into nothingness.</p>

  <p>'Artie,' said Ann.</p>

  <p>He woke up and pulled a stroke. 'What?' he said.</p>

  <p>'Penny for your thoughts, Artie.'</p>

  <p>He considered.</p>

  <p>'I reely don't think I was thinking of anything,' he said at last, with a
  smile. 'No.'</p>

  <p>He still rested on his oars.</p>

  <p>'I expect,' he said, 'I was thinking jest what a Rum Go everything is. I
  expect it was something like that.'</p>

  <p>'Queer old Artie!'</p>

  <p>'Ain't I? I don't suppose there ever was a chap quite like me before.'</p>

  <p>He reflected for just another minute.</p>

  <p>'Oo!&mdash;I dunno,' he said at last, and roused himself to pull.</p>
