  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01">I.&mdash;THE FIRM OF OBERZOHN</a></h2>

  <p class="newspaper">"£520 p.a. Wanted at once, Laboratory Secretary (lady).
  Young; no previous experience required, but must have passed recognized
  examination which included physics and inorganic (elementary) chemistry.
  Preference will be given to one whose family has some record in the world of
  science. Apply by letter, Box 9754, <i>Daily Megaphone</i>. If applicant is
  asked to interview advertiser, fare will be paid from any station within a
  hundred and fifty miles of London."</p><br>

  <p class="first">A GOOD friend sent one of the issues containing this
  advertisement to Heavytree Farm and circled the announcement with a blue
  pencil. Mirabelle Leicester found the newspaper on the hall settee when she
  came in from feeding the chickens, and thought that it had been sent by the
  Alington land agent who was so constantly calling her attention to the
  advertisers who wished to buy cheap farms. It was a practice of his. She had
  the feeling that he resented her presence in the country, and was anxious to
  replace her with a proprietor less poverty-stricken. Splitting the wrapper
  with a dusty thumb, she turned naturally to the advertisement pages, having
  the agent in mind. Her eyes went rapidly down the "Wanted to Buy" column.
  There were several "gentlemen requiring small farm in good district," but
  none that made any appeal to her, and she was wondering why the parsimonious
  man had spent tuppence-ha'penny on postage and paper when the circled
  paragraph caught her eye. "Glory!" said Mirabelle, her red lips parted in
  excited wonder. Aunt Alma looked up from her press-cutting book, startled as
  Mirabelle dashed in. "Me!" she said dramatically, and pointed a finger at the
  advertisement. "I am young&mdash;I have no experience&mdash;I have my higher
  certificate&mdash;and daddy was something in the world of science. And, Alma,
  we are exactly a hundred and forty miles from London town!"</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Aunt Alma, a lady whose gaunt and terrifying appearance
  was the terror of tradesmen and farm hands, although a milder woman never
  knitted stockings.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it wonderful? This solves all our problems. We leave the farm to
  Mark, open the flat in Bloomsbury... we can afford one or even two theatres a
  week... "</p>

  <p>Alma read the announcement for the second time.</p>

  <p>"It seems good," she said with conventional caution, "though I don't like
  the idea of your working, my dear. Your dear father... "</p>

  <p>"Would have whisked me up to town and I should have had the job by
  to-night," said Mirabelle definitely.'</p>

  <p>But Alma wasn't sure. London was full of pitfalls and villainy untold
  lurked in its alleys and dark passages. She herself never went to London
  except under protest.</p>

  <p>"I was there years ago when those horrible Four Just Men were about, my
  dear," she said, and Mirabelle, who loved her, listened to the oft-told
  story. "They terrorized London. One couldn't go out at night with the
  certainty that one would come back again alive... and to think that they have
  had a free pardon! It is simply encouraging crime."</p>

  <p>"My dear," said Mirabelle (and this was her inevitable rejoinder), "they
  weren't criminals at all. They were very rich men who gave up their lives to
  punishing those whom the law let slip through its greasy old fingers. And
  they were pardoned for the intelligence work they did in the war&mdash;one
  worked for three months in the German War Office&mdash;and there aren't four
  at all: there are only three. I'd love to meet them&mdash;they must be
  dears!"</p>

  <p>When Aunt Alma made a grimace, she was hideous. Mirabelle averted her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, they are not in London now, darling," she said, "and you will be
  able to sleep soundly at nights."</p>

  <p>"What about the snake?" asked Miss Alma Goddard ominously.</p>

  <p>Now if there was one thing which no person contemplating a visit to London
  wished to be reminded about, it was the snake. Six million people rose from
  their beds every morning, opened their newspapers and looked for news of the
  snake. Eighteen daily newspapers never passed a day without telling their
  readers that the scare was childish and a shocking commentary on the neurotic
  tendencies of the age; they also published, at regular intervals, intimate
  particulars of the black mamba, its habits and its peculiar deadliness, and
  maintained quite a large staff of earnest reporters to "work on the
  story."</p>

  <p>The black mamba, most deadly of all the African snakes, had escaped from
  the Zoo one cold and foggy night in March. And there should have been the end
  of him&mdash;a three-line paragraph, followed the next day by another
  three-line paragraph detailing how the snake was found dead on the frozen
  ground&mdash;no mamba could live under a temperature of 75 Fahrenheit. But
  the second paragraph never appeared. On the 2nd of April a policeman found a
  man huddled up in a doorway in Orme Place. He proved to be a well-known and
  apparently wealthy stockbroker, named Emmett. He was dead. In his swollen
  face were found two tiny punctured wounds, and the eminent scientist who was
  called into consultation gave his opinion that the man had died from
  snake-bite: an especially deadly snake. The night was chilly; the man had
  been to a theatre alone. His chauffeur stated that he had left his master in
  the best of spirits on the doorstep. The key found in the dead man's hand
  showed that he was struck before the car had turned. When his affairs were
  investigated he was found to be hopelessly insolvent. Huge sums drawn from
  his bank six months before had disappeared.</p>

  <p>London had scarcely recovered from this shocking surprise when the snake
  struck again. This time in the crowded street, and choosing a humble victim,
  though by no means a blameless one. An ex-convict named Sirk, a homeless
  down-and-out, was seen to fall by a park-keeper near the Achilles statue in
  Hyde Park. By the time the keeper reached him he was dead. There was no sign
  of a snake&mdash;nobody was near him. This time the snake had made his mark
  on the wrist&mdash;two little punctured wounds near together.</p>

  <p>A month later the third man fell a victim. He was a clerk of the Bank of
  England, a reputable man who was seen to fall forward in a subway train, and,
  on being removed to hospital, was discovered to have died&mdash;again from
  snake-bite.</p>

  <p>So that the snake became a daily figure of fear, and its sinister fame
  spread even so far afield as Heavytree Farm.</p>

  <p>"Stuff!" said Mirabelle, yet with a shiver. "Alma, I wish you wouldn't
  keep these horrors in your scrapbook."</p>

  <p>"They are Life," said Alma soberly, and then: "When d'you take up your
  appointment?" she asked, and the girl laughed.</p>

  <p>"We will make a beginning right away&mdash;by applying for the job," she
  said practically. "And you needn't start packing your boxes for a very long
  time!"</p>

  <p>An hour later she intercepted the village postman and handed him a
  letter.</p>

  <p>And that was the beginning of the adventure which involved so many lives
  and fortunes, which brought the Three Just men to the verge of dissolution,
  and one day was to turn the heart of London into a battlefield.</p>

  <p>Two days after the letter was dispatched came the answer, typewritten,
  surprisingly personal, and in places curiously worded. There was an excuse
  for that, for the heading on the note-paper was</p>

  <p class="sign">OBERZOHN &amp; SMITTS, MERCHANTS AND EXPORTERS.</p>

  <p><br>
  On the third day Mirabelle Leicester stepped down from a 'bus in the City
  Road and entered the unimposing door of Romance, and an inquisitive chauffeur
  who saw her enter followed and overtook her in the lobby.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, madame&mdash;are you Mrs. Carter?"</p>

  <p>Mirabelle did not look like Mrs. Anybody.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, and gave her name.</p>

  <p>"But you're the lady from Hereford.. you live with your mother at Telford
  Park... ?"</p>

  <p>The man was so agitated that she was not annoyed by his insistence.
  Evidently he had instructions to meet a stranger and was fearful of missing
  her.</p>

  <p>"You have made a mistake&mdash;I live at Heavytree Farm,
  Daynham&mdash;with my aunt."</p>

  <p>"Is she called Carter?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Miss Alma Goddard&mdash;now are you satisfied?"</p>

  <p>"Then you're not the lady, miss; I'm waiting to pick her up."</p>

  <p>The chauffeur withdrew apologetically.</p>

  <p>The girl waited in the ornate ante-room for ten minutes before the pale
  youth with the stiff, upstanding hair and the huge rimless spectacles
  returned. His face was large, expressionless, unhealthy. Mirabelle had noted
  as a curious circumstance that every man she had seen in the office was of
  the same type. Big heavy men who gave the impression that they had been
  called away from some very urgent work to deal with the triviality of her
  inquiries. They were speechless men who glared solemnly at her through thick
  lenses and nodded or shook their heads according to the requirements of the
  moment. She expected to meet foreigners in the offices of Oberzohn &amp;
  Smitts; German, she imagined, and was surprised later to discover that both
  principals and staff were in the main Swedish.</p>

  <p>The pale youth, true to the traditions of the house, said nothing: he
  beckoned her with a little jerk of his head, and she went into a larger room,
  where half a dozen men were sitting at half a dozen desks and writing
  furiously, their noses glued short-sightedly to the books and papers which
  engaged their attention. Nobody looked up as she passed through the
  waist-high gate which separated the caller from the staff. Hanging upon the
  wall between two windows was a map of Africa with great green patches. In one
  corner of the room were stacked a dozen massive ivory tusks, each bearing a
  hanging label. There was the model of a steamship in a case on a
  window-ledge, and on another a crudely carved wooden idol of native
  origin.</p>

  <p>The youth stopped before a heavy rosewood door and knocked. When a deep
  voice answered, he pushed open the door and stood aside to let her pass. It
  was a gigantic room&mdash;that was the word which occurred to her as most
  fitting, and the vast space of it was emphasized by the almost complete lack
  of furniture. A very small ebony writing-table, two very small chairs and a
  long and narrow black cupboard fitted into a recess were all the furnishings
  she could see. The high walls were covered with a golden paper. Four
  bright-red rafters ran across the black ceiling&mdash;the floor was
  completely covered with a deep purple carpet. It seemed that there was a
  rolled map above the fireplace&mdash;a long thin cord came down from the
  cornice and ended in a tassel within reach.</p>

  <p>The room, with its lack of appointments, was so unexpected a vision that
  the girl stood staring from walls to roof, until she observed her guide
  making urgent signs, and then she advanced towards the man who stood with his
  back tiny fire that burnt in the silver fireplace.</p>

  <p>He was tall and grey; her first impression was of an enormously high
  forehead. The sallow face was long, and nearer at hand, she saw, covered by
  innumerable lines and furrows. She judged him to be about fifty until he
  spoke, and then she realized that he was much older.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mirabelle Leicester?"</p>

  <p>His English was not altogether perfect; the delivery was queerly
  deliberate and he lisped slightly.</p>

  <p>"Pray be seated. I am Dr. Eruc Oberzohn. I am not German. I admire the
  Germans, but I am Swedish. You are convinced?"</p>

  <p>She laughed, and when Mirabelle Leicester laughed, less susceptible men
  than Dr. Eruc Oberzohn had forgotten all other business. She was not very
  tall&mdash;her slimness and her symmetrical figure made her appear so. She
  had in her face and in her clear grey eyes something of the countryside; she
  belonged to the orchards where the apple-blossom lay like heavy snow upon the
  bare branches; to the cold brooks that ran noisily under hawthorn hedges. The
  April sunlight was in her eyes and the springy velvet of meadows
  everlastingly under her feet.</p>

  <p>To Dr. Oberzohn she was a girl in a blue tailor-made costume. He saw that
  she wore a little hat with a straight brim that framed her face just above
  the lift of her curved eyebrows. A German would have seen these things, being
  a hopeless sentimentalist. The doctor was not German; he loathed their
  sentimentality.</p>

  <p>"Will you be seated? You have a scientific training?"</p>

  <p>Mirabelle shook tier head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't," she confessed ruefully, "but I've passed in the subjects you
  mentioned in your advertisement."</p>

  <p>"But your father&mdash;he was a scientist?"</p>

  <p>She nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"But not a great scientist," he stated. "England and America do not
  produce such men. Ah, tell me not of your Kelvins, Edisons, and Newtons! They
  were incomplete, dull men, ponderous men&mdash;the fire was not there."</p>

  <p>She was somewhat taken aback, but she was amused as well. His calm
  dismissal of men who were honoured in the scientific world was so obviously
  sincere.</p>

  <p>"Now talk to me of yourself." He seated himself in the hard,
  straight-backed chair by the little desk.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid there is very little I can tell you, Dr. Oberzohn. I live with
  my aunt at Heavytree Farm in Gloucester, and we have a flat in Doughty Court.
  My aunt and I have a small income&mdash;and I think that is all."</p>

  <p>"Go on, please," he commanded. "Tell me of your sensations when you had my
  letter&mdash;I desire to know your mind. That is how I form all opinions;
  that is how I made my immense fortune. By the analysis of the mind."</p>

  <p>She had expected many tests; an examination in elementary science; a
  typewriting test possibly (she dreaded this most); but she never for one
  moment dreamt that the flowery letter asking her to call at the City Road
  offices of Oberzohn &amp; Smitts would lead to an experiment in
  psycho-analysis.</p>

  <p>"I can only tell you that I was surprised," she said, and the tightening
  line of her mouth would have told him a great deal if he were the student of
  human nature he claimed to be. "Naturally the salary appeals to me&mdash;ten
  pounds a week is such a high rate of pay that I cannot think I am
  qualified&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are qualified." His harsh voice grew more strident as he impressed
  this upon her. "I need a laboratory secretary. You are qualified"&mdash;he
  hesitated, and then went on&mdash;"by reason of distinguished parentage.
  Also"&mdash;he hesitated again for a fraction of a second&mdash;"also because
  of general education. Your duties shall commence soon!" He waved a long, thin
  hand to the door in the corner of the room. "You will take your position at
  once," he said.</p>

  <p>The long face, the grotesquely high forehead, the bulbous nose and wide,
  crooked mouth all seemed to work together when he spoke. At one moment the
  forehead was full of pleats and furrows&mdash;at the next, comparatively
  smooth. The point of his nose dipped up and down at every word, only his
  small, deep-set eyes remained steadfast, unwinking. She had seen eyes like
  those before, brown and pathetic. Of what did they remind her? His last words
  brought her to the verge of panic.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I could not possibly start to-day," she said in trepidation.</p>

  <p>"To-day, or it shall be never," he said with an air of finality.</p>

  <p>She had to face a crisis. The salary was more than desirable; it was
  necessary. The farm scarcely paid its way, for Alma was not the best of
  managers. And the income grew more and more attenuated. Last year the company
  in which her meagre fortune was invested had passed a dividend and she had to
  give up her Swiss holiday.</p>

  <p>"I'll start now." She had to set her teeth to make this resolve.</p>

  <p>"Very good; that is my wish."</p>

  <p>He was still addressing her as though she were a public meeting. Rising
  from his chair, he opened the little door and she went into a smaller room.
  She had seen laboratories, but none quite so beautifully fitted as
  this&mdash;shelf upon shelf of white porcelain jars, of cut-glass bottles,
  their contents engraved in frosted letters; a bench that ran the length of
  the room, on which apparatus of every kind was arranged in order. In the
  centre of the room ran a long, glass-topped table, and here, in dustproof
  glass, were delicate instruments, ranging from scales which she knew could be
  influenced by a grain of dust, to electrical machines, so complicated that
  her heart sank at the sight of them.</p>

  <p>"What must I do?" she asked dismally.</p>

  <p>Everything was so beautifully new; she was sure she would drop one of
  those lovely jars... all the science of the school laboratory had suddenly
  drained out of her mind, leaving it a blank.</p>

  <p>"You will do." Remarkably enough, the doctor for the moment seemed as much
  at a loss as the girl. "First&mdash;quantities. In every jar or bottle there
  is a quantity. How much? Who knows? The last secretary was careless, stupid.
  She kept no book. Sometimes I go for something&mdash;it is not there! All
  gone. That is very regrettable."</p>

  <p>"You wish me to take stock?" she asked, her hopes reviving at the
  simplicity of her task.</p>

  <p>There were measures and scales enough. The latter stood in a line like a
  platoon of soldiers ranged according to their size. Everything was very new,
  very neat. There was a smell of drying enamel in the room as though the place
  had been newly painted.</p>

  <p>"That is all," said the long-faced man. He put his hand in the pocket of
  his frock-coat and took out a large wallet. From this he withdrew two crisp
  notes.</p>

  <p>"Ten pounds," he said briefly. "We pay already in advance. There is one
  more thing I desire to know," he said. "It is of the aunt. She is in
  London?"</p>

  <p>Mirabelle shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, she is in the country. I expected to go back this afternoon, and if I
  was&mdash;successful, we were coming to town to-morrow."</p>

  <p>He pursed his thickish lips; she gazed fascinated at his long forehead
  rippled in thought.</p>

  <p>"It will be a nervous matter for her if you stay in London
  to-night&mdash;no?"</p>

  <p>She smiled and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No. I will stay at the flat; I have often stayed there alone, but even
  that will not be necessary. I will wire asking her to come up by the first
  train."</p>

  <p>"Wait." He raised a pompous hand and darted back to his room. He returned
  with a packet of telegraph forms. "Write your telegram," he commanded. "A
  clerk shall dispatch it at once."</p>

  <p>Gratefully she took the blanks and wrote her news and request.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Oberzohn bowed, went to the door, bowed again, and the door closed
  behind him.</p>

  <p>Fortunately for her peace of mind, Mirabelle Leicester had no occasion to
  consult her employer or attempt to open the door. Had she done so, she would
  have discovered that it was locked. As for the telegram she had written, that
  was a curl of black ash in his fire.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">II.&mdash;THE THREE MEN OF CURZON STREET</a></h2>

  <p class="first">No. 233, Curzon Street, was a small house. Even the most
  enthusiastic of agents would not, if he had any regard to his soul's
  salvation, describe its dimensions with any enthusiasm. He might enlarge upon
  its bijou beauties, refer reverently its historical association, speak
  truthfully of its central heating and electric installation, but he would,
  being an honest man, convey the impression that No. 233 was on the small
  aide.</p>

  <p>The house was flanked by two modern mansions, stone-fronted, with metal
  and glass doors that gave out a blur of light by night. Both overtopped the
  modest roof of their neighbour by many stories&mdash;No. 233 had the
  appearance of a little man crushed in a crowd and unable to escape, and there
  was in its mild frontage the illusion of patient resignation and
  humility.</p>

  <p>To that section of Curzon Street wherein it had its place, the house was
  an offence and was, in every but a legal sense, a nuisance. A learned
  Chancery judge to whom application had been made on behalf of neighbouring
  property owners, ground landlords and the like, had refused to grant the
  injunction for which they had pleaded, "prohibiting the said George Manfred
  from carrying on a business, to wit the Triangle Detective Agency, situate at
  the aforesaid number two hundred and thirty-three Curzon Street in the City
  of Westminster in the County of Middlesex."</p>

  <p>In a judgment which occupied a third of a column of The Times he laid down
  the dictum that a private detective might be a professional rather than a
  business man&mdash;a dictum which has been, and will be, disputed to the end
  of time.</p>

  <p>So the little silver triangle remained fixed to the door and he continued
  to interview his clients&mdash;few in number, for he was most careful to
  accept only those who offered scope for his genius.</p>

  <p>A tall, strikingly handsome man, with the face of a patrician and the
  shoulders of an athlete, Curzon Street&mdash;or such of the street as took
  the slightest notice of anything&mdash;observed him to be extremely well
  dressed on all occasions. He was a walking advertisement for a Hanover Street
  tailor who was so fashionable that he would have died with horror at the very
  thought of advertising at all. Car folk held up at busy crossings glanced
  into his limousine, saw the clean-cut profile and the tanned, virile face,
  and guessed him for a Harley Street specialist. Very few people knew him
  socially. Dr. Elver, the Scotland Yard surgeon, used to come up to Curzon
  Street at times and give his fantastic views on the snake and its
  appearances, George Manfred and his friends listening in silence and offering
  no help. But apart from Elver and an Assistant Commissioner of Police, a
  secretive man, who dropped in at odd moments to smoke a pipe and talk of old
  times, the social callers were few and far between.</p>

  <p>His chauffeur-footman was really better known than he. At the mews where
  he garaged his car, they called him "Lightning," and it was generally agreed
  that this thin-faced, eager-eyed man would sooner or later meet the end which
  inevitably awaits all chauffeurs who take sharp corners on two wheels at
  sixty miles an hour: some of the critics had met the big Spanz on the road
  and had reproached him afterwards, gently or violently, according to the
  degree of their scare.</p>

  <p>Few knew Mr. Manfred's butler, a dark-browed foreigner, rather stout and
  somewhat saturnine. He was a man who talked very little even to the cook and
  the two housemaids who came every morning at eight and left the house
  punctually at six, for Mr. Manfred dined out most nights.</p>

  <p>He advertised only in the more exclusive newspapers, and not in his own
  name; no interviews were granted except by appointment, so that the arrival
  of Mr. Sam Barberton was in every sense an irregularity.</p>

  <p>He knocked at the door just as the maids were leaving, and since they knew
  little about Manfred and his ways except that he liked poached eggs and
  spinach for breakfast, the stranger was allowed to drift into the hall, and
  here the taciturn butler, hastily summoned from his room, found him.</p>

  <p>The visitor was a stubby, thick-set man with a brick-red face and a head
  that was both grey and bald. His dress and his speech were equally rough. The
  butler saw that he was no ordinary artisan because his boots were of a kind
  known as veldtschoons. They were of undressed leather, patchily bleached by
  the sun.</p>

  <p>"I want to see the boss of this Triangle," he said in a loud voice, and,
  diving into his waistcoat pocket, brought out a soiled newspaper cutting.</p>

  <p>The butler took it from him without a word. It was the Cape Times&mdash;he
  would have known by the type and the spacing even if on the back there had
  not been printed the notice of a church bazaar at Wynberg. The butler studied
  such things.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that you cannot see Mr. Manfred without an appointment," he
  said. His voice and manner were most expectedly gentle in such a forbidding
  man.</p>

  <p>"I've got to see him, if I sit here all night," said the man stubbornly,
  and symbolized his immovability by squatting down in the hall chair.</p>

  <p>Not a muscle of the servant's face moved. It was impossible to tell
  whether he was angry or amused.</p>

  <p>"I got this cutting out of a paper I found on the Benguella&mdash;she
  docked at Tilbury this afternoon&mdash;and I came straight here. I should
  never have dreamt of coming at all, only I want fair play for all concerned.
  That Portuguese feller with a name like a cigar&mdash;Villa, that's
  it!&mdash;he said, 'What's the good of going to London when we can settle
  everything on board ship?' But half-breed Portuguese! My God, I'd rather deal
  with bushmen! Bushmen are civilized&mdash;look here."</p>

  <p>Before the butler realized what the man was doing, he had slipped off one
  of his ugly shoes. He wore no sock or stocking underneath, and he upturned
  the sole of his bare foot for inspection. The flesh was seamed and puckered
  into red weals, and the butler knew the cause.</p>

  <p>"Portuguese," said the visitor tersely as he resumed his shoe. "Not
  niggers&mdash;Portugooses&mdash;half-bred, I'll admit. They burnt me to make
  me talk, and they'd have killed me only one of those hell-fire American
  traders came along&mdash;full of fight and fire-water. He brought me into the
  town."</p>

  <p>"Where was this?" asked the butler.</p>

  <p>"Mosamades: I went ashore to look round, like a fool. I was on a Woerman
  boat that was going up to Boma. The skipper was a Hun, but white&mdash;he
  warned me."</p>

  <p>"And what did they want to know from you?"</p>

  <p>The caller shot a suspicious glance at his interrogator.</p>

  <p>"Are you the boss?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'm Mr. Manfred's butler. What name shall I tell him?"</p>

  <p>"Barberton&mdash;Mister Samuel Barberton. Tell him I want certain things
  found out. The address of a young lady by the name of Miss Mirabelle
  Leicester. And I'll tell your governor something too. This Portugoose got
  drunk one night, and spilled it about the fort they've got in England. Looks
  like a house but it's a fort: he went there... "</p>

  <p>No, he was not drunk; stooping to pick up an imaginary match-stalk, the
  butler's head had come near the visitor; there was a strong aroma of tobacco
  but not of drink.</p>

  <p>"Would you very kindly wait?" he asked, and disappeared up the stairs.</p>

  <p>He was not gone long before he returned to the first landing and beckoned
  Mr. Barberton to come. The visitor was ushered into a room at the front of
  the house, a small room, which was made smaller by the long grey velvet
  curtains that hung behind the empire desk where Manfred was standing.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Barberton, sir," said the butler, bowed, and went out,
  closing the door.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mr. Barberton." He indicated a chair and seated himself. "My
  butler tells me you have quite an exciting story to tell me&mdash;you are
  from the Cape?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not," said Mr. Barberton. "I've never been at the Cape in my
  life."</p>

  <p>The man behind the desk nodded.</p>

  <p>"Now, if you will tell me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to tell you much," was the surprisingly blunt reply. "It's
  not likely that I'm going to tell a stranger what I wouldn't even tell Elijah
  Washington&mdash;and he saved my life!"</p>

  <p>Manfred betrayed no resentment at this cautious attitude. In that room he
  had met many clients who had shown the same reluctance to accept him as their
  confidant. Yet he had at the back of his mind the feeling that this man,
  unlike the rest, might remain adamant to the end: he was curious to discover
  the real object of the visit.</p>

  <p>Barberton drew his chair nearer the writing-table and rested his elbows on
  the edge.</p>

  <p>"It's like this, Mr. What's-your-name. There's a certain secret which
  doesn't belong to me, and yet does in a way. It is worth a lot of money. Mr.
  Elijah Washington knew that and tried to pump me, and Villa got a gang of
  Kroomen to burn my feet, but I've not told yet. What I want you to do is to
  find Miss Mirabelle Leicester; and I want to get her quick, because there's
  only about two weeks, if you understand me, before this other crowd gets
  busy&mdash;Villa is certain to have cabled 'em, and according to him they're
  hot!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Manfred leant back in his padded chair, the glint of an amused smile
  in his grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"I take it that what you want us to find Miss Leicester?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded energetically.</p>

  <p>"Have you the slightest idea as to where she is to be found? Has she any
  relations in England?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," interrupted the man. "All I know is that she lives here
  somewhere, and that her father died three years ago, on the twenty-ninth of
  May&mdash;make a note of that: he died in England on the twenty-ninth of
  May."</p>

  <p>That was an important piece of information, and it made the search easy,
  thought Manfred.</p>

  <p>"And you're going to tell me about the fort, aren't you?" he said, as he
  looked up from his notes.</p>

  <p>Barberton hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I was," he admitted, "but I'm not so sure that I will now, until I've
  found this young lady. And don't forget,"&mdash;he rapped the table to
  emphasize his words&mdash;"that crowd is hot!"</p>

  <p>"Which crowd?" asked Manfred good-humouredly. He knew many "crowds," and
  wondered if it was about one which was in his mind that the caller was
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"The crowd I'm talking about," said Mr. Barberton, who spoke with great
  deliberation and was evidently weighing every word he uttered for fear that
  he should involuntarily betray his secret.</p>

  <p>That seemed to be an end of his requirements, for he rose and stood a
  little awkwardly, fumbling in his inside pocket.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to pay," said Manfred, guessing his intention. "Perhaps,
  when we have located your Miss Mirabelle Leicester, we shall ask you to
  refund our out-of-pocket expenses."</p>

  <p>"I can afford to pay&mdash;" began the man.</p>

  <p>"And we can afford to wait." Again the gleam of amusement in the deep
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Still Mr. Barberton did not move.</p>

  <p>"There's another thing I meant to ask you. You know all that's happening
  in this country?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite everything," said the other with perfect gravity.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of the Four Just Men?"</p>

  <p>It was a surprising question. Manfred bent forward as though he had not
  heard aright.</p>

  <p>"The Four&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"The Four Just Men&mdash;three, as a matter of fact. I'd like to get in
  touch with those birds."</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think I have heard of them," he said.</p>

  <p>"They're in England now somewhere. They've got a pardon: I saw that in the
  Cape Times&mdash;the bit I tore the advertisement from."</p>

  <p>"The last I heard of them, they were in Spain," said Manfred, and walked
  round the table and opened the door. "Why do you wish to get in touch with
  them?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said Mr. Barberton impressively, "the crowd are scared of
  'em&mdash;that's why."</p>

  <p>Manfred walked with his visitor to the landing.</p>

  <p>"You have omitted one important piece of information," he said with a
  smile, "but I did not intend your going until you told me. What is your
  address?"</p>

  <p>"Petworth Hotel, Norfolk Street."</p>

  <p>Barberton went down the stairs; the butler was waiting in the hall to show
  him out, and Mr. Barberton, having a vague idea that something of the sort
  was usual in the houses of the aristocracy, slipped a silver coin in his
  hand. The dark-faced man murmured his thanks: his bow was perhaps a little
  lower, his attitude just a trifle more deferential.</p>

  <p>He closed and locked the front door and went slowly up the stairs to the
  office room. Manfred was sitting on the empire table, lighting a cigarette.
  The chauffeur-valet had come through the grey curtains to take the chair
  which had been vacated by Mr. Barberton.</p>

  <p>"He gave me half a crown&mdash;generous fellow," said Poiccart, the
  butler. "I like him, George."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could have seen his feet," said the chauffeur, whose veritable
  name was Leon Gonsalez. He spoke with regret. "He comes from West Sussex, and
  there is insanity in his family. The left parietal is slightly recessed and
  the face is asymmetrical."</p>

  <p>"Poor soul!" murmured Manfred, blowing a cloud of smoke to the ceiling.
  "It's a great trial introducing one's friends to you, Leon."</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, you have no friends," said Leon, reaching out and taking a
  cigarette from the open gold case on the table. "Well, what do you think of
  our Mr. Barberton's mystery?"</p>

  <p>George Manfred shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He was vague, and, in his desire to be diplomatic, incoherent. What about
  your own mystery, Leon? You have been out all day... have you found a
  solution?"</p>

  <p>Gonsalez nodded.</p>

  <p>"Barberton is afraid of something," said Poiccart, a slow and sure
  analyst. "He carried a gun between his trousers and his waistcoat&mdash;you
  saw that?" George nodded.</p>

  <p>"The question is, who or which is the crowd? Question two is, where and
  who is Miss Mirabelle Leicester? Question three is, why did they burn
  Barberton's feet?... and I think that is all."</p>

  <p>The keen face of Gonsalez was thrust forward through a cloud of smoke.</p>

  <p>"I will answer most of them and propound two more," he said. "Mirabelle
  Leicester took a job to-day at Oberzohn's&mdash;laboratory secretary!"</p>

  <p>George Manfred frowned.</p>

  <p>"Laboratory? I didn't know that he had one."</p>

  <p>"He hadn't till three days ago&mdash;it was fitted in seventy-two hours by
  experts who worked day and night; the cost of its installation was sixteen
  hundred pounds&mdash;and it came into existence to give Oberzohn an excuse
  for engaging Mirabelle Leicester. You sent me out to clear up that queer
  advertisement which puzzled us all on Monday&mdash;I have cleared it up. It
  was designed to bring our Miss Leicester into the Oberzohn establishment. We
  all agreed when we discovered who was the advertiser, that Oberzohn was
  working for something&mdash;I watched his office for two days, and she was
  the only applicant for the job&mdash;hers the only letter they answered.
  Oberzohn lunched with her at the Ritz-Carlton&mdash;she sleeps to-night in
  Chester Square."</p>

  <p>There was a silence which was broken by Poiccart.</p>

  <p>"And what is the question you have to propound?" he asked mildly.</p>

  <p>"I think I know," said Manfred, and nodded. "The question is: how long has
  Mr. Samuel Barberton to live?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Gonsalez with satisfaction. "You are beginning to
  understand the mentality of Oberzohn!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap03"
     id="chap03">III.&mdash;THE VENDETTA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE man who that morning walked without announcement into
  Dr. Oberzohn's office might have stepped from the pages of a catalogue of
  men's fashions. He was, to the initiated eye, painfully new. His lemon
  gloves, his dazzling shoes, the splendour of his silk hat, the very
  correctness of his handkerchief display, would have been remarkable even in
  the Ascot paddock on Cup day. He was good-looking, smooth, if a trifle plump,
  of face, and he wore a tawny little moustache and a monocle. People who did
  not like Captain Monty Newton&mdash;and their names were many&mdash;said of
  him that he aimed at achieving the housemaid's conception of a guardsman.
  They did not say this openly, because he was a man to be propitiated rather
  than offended. He had money, a place in the country, a house in Chester
  Square, and an assortment of cars. He was a member of several good clubs, the
  committees of which never discussed him without offering the excuse of
  wartime courtesies for his election. Nobody knew how he made his money, or,
  if it were inherited, whose heir he was. He gave extravagant parties, played
  cards well, and enjoyed exceptional luck, especially when he was the host and
  held the bank after one of the splendid dinners he gave in his Chester Square
  mansion.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Oberzohn&mdash;how is Smitts?" It was his favourite jest,
  for there was no Smitts, and had been no Smitts in the firm since '96.</p>

  <p>The doctor, peering down at the telegram he was writing, looked up.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Captain Newton," he said precisely. Newton passed to the
  back of him and read the message he was writing. It was addressed to "Miss
  Alma Goddard, Heavytree Farm, Daynham, Gloucester," and the wire ran:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"HAVE GOT THE FINE SITUATION. CANNOT EXPEDITIOUSLY RETURN
  TO-NIGHT. I AM SLEEPING AT OUR PRETTY FLAT IN DOUGHTY COURT. DO NOT COME UP
  UNTIL I SEND FOR YOU.&mdash;MISS MIRABELLE LEICESTER."</p><br>

  <p>"She's here, is she?" Captain Newton glanced at the laboratory door.
  "You're not going to send that wire? 'Miss Mirabelle Leicester!'
  'Expeditiously return!' She'd tumble it in a minute. Who is Alma
  Goddard?"</p>

  <p>"The aunt," said Oberzohn. "I did not intend the dispatching until you had
  seen it. My English is too correct."</p>

  <p>He made way for Captain Newton, who, having taken a sheet of paper from
  the rack on which to deposit with great care his silk hat, and having
  stripped his gloves and deposited them in his hat, sat down in the chair from
  which the older man had risen, pulled up the knees of his immaculate
  trousers, tore off the top telegraph form, and wrote under the
  address:</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">"HAVE GOT THE JOB. HOORAY! DON'T BOTHER TO COME UP,
  DARLING, UNTIL I AM SETTLED. SHALL SLEEP AT THE FLAT AS USUAL. TOO BUSY TO
  WRITE. KEEP MY LETTERS.&mdash;MIRABELLE."</p><br>

  <p>"That's real," said Captain Newton, surveying his work with satisfaction.
  "Push it off."</p>

  <p>He got up and straddled his legs before the fire.</p>

  <p>"The hard part of the job may be to persuade the lady to come to Chester
  Square," he said.</p>

  <p>"My own little house&mdash;" began Oberzohn.</p>

  <p>"Would scare her to death," said Newton with a loud laugh. "That
  dog-kennel! No, it is Chester Square or nothing. I'll get Joan or one of the
  girls to drop in this afternoon and chum up with her. When does the Benguella
  arrive?"</p>

  <p>"This afternoon: the person has booked rooms by radio at the Petworth
  Hotel."</p>

  <p>"Norfolk Street... humph! One of your men can pick him up and keep an eye
  on him. Lisa? So much the better. That kind of trash will talk for a woman. I
  don't suppose he has seen a white woman in years. You ought to fire
  Villa&mdash;crude beast! Naturally the man is on his guard now."</p>

  <p>"Villa is the best of my men on the coast," barked Oberzohn fiercely.
  Nothing so quickly touched the raw places of his amazing vanity as a
  reflection upon his organizing qualities.</p>

  <p>"How is trade?" Captain Newton took a long ebony holder from his tail
  pocket, flicked out a thin platinum case and lit a cigarette in one
  uninterrupted motion.</p>

  <p>"Bat!" When Dr. Oberzohn was annoyed the purity of his pronunciation
  suffered. "There is nothing but expense!"</p>

  <p>Oberzohn &amp; Smitts had once made an enormous income from the sale of
  synthetic alcohol. They were, amongst other things, coast traders. They
  bought rubber and ivory, paving in cloth and liquor. They sold arms secretly,
  organized tribal wars for their greater profit, and had financed at least two
  Portuguese revolutions nearer at home. And with the growth of their fortune,
  the activities of the firm had extended. Guns and more guns went out of
  Belgian and French workshops. To Kurdish insurrectionaries, to ambitious
  Chinese generals, to South American politicians, planning, to carry their
  convictions into more active fields. There was no country in the world that
  did not act as host to an O.&amp;S. agent&mdash;and agents can be very
  expensive. Just now the world was alarmingly peaceful. A revolution had
  failed most dismally in Venezuela, and Oberzohn &amp; Smitts had not been
  paid for two ship-loads of lethal weapons ordered by a general who, two days
  after the armaments were landed, had been placed against an adobe wall and
  incontinently shot to rags by the soldiers of the Government against which he
  was in rebellion. "But that shall not matter." Oberzohn waved bad trade from
  the considerable factors of life. "This shall succeed: and then I shall be
  free to well punish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To punish well," corrected the purist, stroking his moustache. "Don't
  split your infinitives, Eruc&mdash;it's silly. You're thinking of Manfred and
  Gonsalez and Poiccart? Leave them alone. They are nothing!"</p>

  <p>"Nothing!" roared the doctor, his sallow face instantly distorted with
  fury. "To leave them alone, is it? Of my brother what? Of my brother in
  heaven, sainted martyr... !"</p>

  <p>He spun round, gripped the silken tassel of the cord above the fireplace,
  and pulled down, not a map, but a picture. It had been painted from a
  photograph by an artist who specialized in the gaudy banners which hang
  before every booth at every country fair. In this setting the daub was a
  shrieking incongruity; yet to Dr. Oberzohn it surpassed in beauty the
  masterpieces of the Prado. A full-length portrait of a man in a frock-coat.
  He leaned on a pedestal in the attitude which cheap photographers believe is
  the acme of grace. His big face, idealized as it was by the artist, was
  brutal and stupid. The carmine lips were parted in a simper. In one hand he
  held a scroll of paper, in the other a Derby hat which was considerably out
  of drawing.</p>

  <p>"My brother!" Dr. Oberzohn choked. "My sainted Adolph... murdered! By the
  so-called Three Just Men... my brother!"</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," murmured Captain Newton, who had not even troubled to
  look up. He flicked the ash from his cigarette into the fireplace and said no
  more. Adolph Oberzohn had certainly been shot dead by Leon Gonsalez: there
  was no disputing the fact. That Adolph, at the moment of his death, was
  attempting to earn the generous profits which come to those who engage in a
  certain obnoxious trade between Europe and the South American states, was
  less open to question. There was a girl in it: Leon followed his man to Porto
  Rico, and in the Café of the Seven Virtues they had met. Adolph was by
  training a gunman and drew first&mdash;and died first. That was the story of
  Adolph Oberzohn: the story of a girl whom Leon Gonsalez smuggled back to
  Europe belongs elsewhere. She fell in love with her rescuer and frightened
  him sick.</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn let the portrait roll up with a snap, blew his nose
  vigorously, and blinked the tears from his pale eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, very sad, very sad," said the captain cheerfully. "Now what about
  this girl? There is to be nothing rough or raw, you understand, Eruc? I want
  the thing done sweetly. Get that bug of the Just Men out of your
  mind&mdash;they are out of business. When a man lowers himself to run a
  detective agency he's a back number. If they start anything we'll deal with
  them scientifically, eh? Scientifically!"</p>

  <p>He chuckled with laughter at this good joke. It was obvious that Captain
  Newton was no dependant on the firm of Oberzohn &amp; Smitts. If he was not
  the dominant partner, he dominated that branch which he had once served in a
  minor capacity. He owed much to the death of Adolph&mdash;he never regretted
  the passing of that unsavoury man.</p>

  <p>"I'll get one of the girls to look her over this afternoon&mdash;where is
  your telephone pad&mdash;the one you write messages received?"</p>

  <p>The doctor opened a drawer of his desk and took out a little memo pad, and
  Newton found a pencil and wrote:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"To Mirabelle Leicester, care Oberzohn (Phone) London.
  Sorry I can't come up to-night. Don't sleep at flat alone. Have wired Joan
  Newton to put you up for night. She will call&mdash;<span class=
  "smcap">Alma</span>."</p><br>

  <p>"There you are," said the gallant captain, handing the pad to the other.
  "That message came this afternoon. All telegrams to Oberzohn come by
  'phone&mdash;never forget it!"</p>

  <p>"Ingenious creature!" Dr. Oberzohn's admiration was almost
  reverential.</p>

  <p>"Take her out to lunch... after lunch, the message. At four o'clock, Joan
  or one of the girls. A select dinner. To-morrow the office... gently, gently.
  Bull-rush these schemes and your plans die the death of a dog."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the door once more.</p>

  <p>"She won't come out, I suppose?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Deuced awkward if she came out and saw Miss Newton's brother!"</p>

  <p>"I have locked the door," said Dr. Oberzohn proudly.</p>

  <p>Captain Newton's attitude changed: his face went red with sudden fury.</p>

  <p>"Then you're a&mdash;you're a fool. Unlock the door when I've
  gone&mdash;and keep it unlocked! Want to frighten her?"</p>

  <p>"It was my idea to risk nothing," pleaded the long-faced Swede.</p>

  <p>"Do as I tell you."</p>

  <p>Captain Newton brushed his speckless coat with the tips of his fingers. He
  pulled on his gloves, fitted his hat with the aid of a small pocket-mirror he
  took from his inside pocket, took up his clouded cane and strolled from the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Ingenious creature," murmured Dr. Oberzohn again, and went in to offer
  the startled Mirabelle an invitation to lunch.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04">IV.&mdash;THE SNAKE STRIKES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE great restaurant, with its atmosphere of luxury and
  wealth, had been a little overpowering. The crowded tables, the soft lights,
  the very capability and nonchalance of the waiters, were impressive. When her
  new employer had told her that it was his practice to take the laboratory
  secretary to lunch, "for I have not other time to speak of business things,"
  she accepted uncomfortably. She knew little of office routine, but she felt
  that it was not customary for principals to drive their secretaries from the
  City Road to the Ritz-Carlton to lunch expensively at that resort of fashion
  and the epicure. It added nothing to her self-possession that her companion
  was an object of interest to all who saw him. The gay luncheon parties forgot
  their dishes and twisted round to stare at the extraordinary-looking man with
  the high forehead.</p>

  <p>At a little table alone she saw a man whose face was tantalizingly
  familiar. A keen, thin face with eager, amused eyes. Where had she seen him
  before? Then she remembered: the chauffeur had such a face&mdash;the man who
  had followed her into Oberzohn's when she arrived that morning. It was
  absurd, of course; this man was one of the leisured class, to whom lunching
  at the Ritz-Carlton was a normal event. And yet the likeness was
  extraordinary.</p>

  <p>She was glad when the meal was over. Dr. Oberzohn did not talk of
  "business things." He did not talk at all, but spent his time shovelling
  incredible quantities of food through his wide slit of a mouth. He ate
  intently, noisily&mdash;Mirabelle was glad the band was playing, and she went
  red with suppressed laughter at the whimsical thought; and after that she
  felt less embarrassed.</p>

  <p>No word was spoken as the big car sped citywards. The doctor had his
  thoughts and ignored her presence. The only reference he made to the lunch
  was as they were leaving the hotel, when he had condescended to grunt a
  bitter complaint about the quality of English-made coffee. He allowed her to
  go back to her weighing and measuring without displaying the slightest
  interest in her progress.</p>

  <p>And then came the crowning surprise of the afternoon&mdash;it followed the
  arrival of a puzzling telegram from her aunt. She was weighing an
  evil-smelling mass of powder when the door opened and there floated into the
  room a delicate-looking girl, beautifully dressed. A small face framed in a
  mass of little golden-brown curls smiled a greeting. "You're Mirabelle
  Leicester, aren't you? I'm Joan Newton&mdash;your aunt wired me to call on
  you."</p>

  <p>"Do you know my aunt?" asked Mirabelle in astonishment. She had never
  heard Alma speak of the Newtons, but then, Aunt Alma had queer reticences.
  Mirabelle had expected a middle-aged dowd&mdash;it was amazing that her
  unprepossessing relative could claim acquaintance with this society
  butterfly.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes&mdash;we know Alma very well," replied the visitor. "Of course, I
  haven't seen her since I was quite a little girl&mdash;she's a dear."</p>

  <p>She looked round the laboratory with curious interest.</p>

  <p>"What a nasty-smelling place!" she said, her nose up-turned. "And how do
  you like old&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Oberzohn?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?" asked Mirabelle, astounded at the possibility of this
  coincidence.</p>

  <p>"My brother knows him&mdash;we live together, my brother and I, and he
  knows everybody. A man about town has to, hasn't he, dear?"</p>

  <p>"Man about town" was an expression that grated a little; Mirabelle was not
  of the "dearing" kind. The combination of errors in taste made her scrutinize
  the caller more closely. Joan Newton was dressed beautifully but not well.
  There was something... Had Mirabelle a larger knowledge of life, she might
  have thought that the girl had been dressed to play the part of a lady by
  somebody who wasn't quite sure of the constituents of the part. Captain
  Newton she did not know at the time, or she would have guessed the dress
  authority.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take you back to Chester Square after Mr.
  Oberzohn&mdash;such a funny name, isn't it?&mdash;has done with you. Monty
  insisted upon my bringing the Rolls. Monty is my brother; he's rather
  classical."</p>

  <p>Mirabelle wondered whether this indicated a love of the Greek poets or a
  passion for the less tuneful operas. Joan (which was her real name) meant no
  more than classy: it was a favourite word of hers; another was "morbid."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later the inquisitive chauffeur put his foot on the starter
  and sent his car on the trail of the Rolls, wondering what Mirabelle
  Leicester had in common with Joan Alice Murphy, who had brought so many rich
  young men to the green board in Captain Newton's beautiful drawing-room,
  where stakes ran high and the captain played with such phenomenal luck,</p>

  <p>"And there you are," said Gonsalez complacently. "I've done a very good
  day's work. Oberzohn has gone back to his rabbit-hutch to think up new
  revolutions&mdash;Miss Mirabelle Leicester is to be found at 307, Chester
  Square. Now the point is, what do we do to save the valuable life of Mr. Sam
  Barberton?"</p>

  <p>Manfred looked grave. "I hardly like the thought of the girl spending the
  night in Newton's house," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why allow her to remain there?" asked Poiccart in his heavy way.</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>George Manfred looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Obviously the first person to see is friend Barberton," he said, "If we
  can prevail on him to spend the evening with us, the rest is a simple
  matter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The telephone bell rang shrilly and Leon Gonsalez monopolized the
  instrument.</p>

  <p>"Gloucester? Yes." He covered the receiver with his hand. "I took the
  liberty of asking Miss Alma Goddard to ring me up... her address I discovered
  very early in the day: Heavytree Farm, Daynham, near Gloucester... yes, yes,
  it is Mr. Johnson speaking. I wanted to ask you if you would take a message
  to Miss Leicester... oh, she isn't at home?" Leon listened attentively, and,
  after a few minutes: "Thank you very much. She is staying at Doughty Court?
  She wired you... oh, nothing very important. I&mdash;er&mdash;am her old
  science master and I saw an advertisement... oh, she has seen it, has
  she?"</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to go on," he said. "The girl has wired to say she is delighted
  with her job. The aunt is not to come up until she is settled, and Mirabelle
  is sleeping at Doughty Court."</p>

  <p>"And a very excellent place too," said Manfred. "When we've seen Mr.
  Barberton I shouldn't be surprised if she didn't sleep there after all."</p>

  <p>Petworth Hotel in Norfolk Street was a sedate residential hostel, greatly
  favoured by overseas visitors, especially South Africans. The reception clerk
  thought Mr. Barberton was out: the hall porter was sure.</p>

  <p>"He went down to the Embankment&mdash;he said he'd like to see the river
  before it was dark," said that confidant of so many visitors.</p>

  <p>Manfred stepped into the car by Leon's side&mdash;Poiccart seldom went
  abroad, but sat at home piecing together the little jigsaw puzzles of life
  that came to Curzon Street for solution. He was the greatest of all the
  strategists: even Scotland Yard brought some of its problems for his
  inspection.</p>

  <p>"On the Embankment?" Manfred looked up at the blue and pink sky. The sun
  had gone down, but the light of day remained. "If it were darker I should be
  worried... stop, there's Dr. Elver."</p>

  <p>The little police surgeon who had passed them with a cheery wave of his
  hand turned and walked back.</p>

  <p>"Well, Children of the Law"&mdash;he was inclined to be dramatic&mdash;"on
  what dread errand of vengeance are you bound?"</p>

  <p>"We are looking for a man named Barberton to ask him to dinner," said
  Manfred, shaking hands.</p>

  <p>"Sounds tame to me: has he any peculiarities which would appeal to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Burnt feet," said Leon promptly. "If you would like to learn how the
  coastal intelligence department extract information from unwilling victims,
  come along."</p>

  <p>Elver hesitated. He was a man burnt up by the Indian suns, wizened like a
  dried yellow apple, and he had no interest in the world beyond his work.</p>

  <p>"I'll go with you," he said, stepping into the car. "And if your Barberton
  man fails you, you can have me as a guest. I like to hear you talking. One
  cannot know too much of the criminal mind! And life is dull since the snake
  stopped biting!"</p>

  <p>The car made towards Blackfriars Bridge, and Manfred kept watch of the
  sidewalk. There was no sign of Barberton, and he signalled Leon to turn and
  come back. This brought the machine to the Embankment side of the broad
  boulevard. They had passed under Waterloo Bridge and were nearing Cleopatra's
  Needle when Gonsalez saw the man they were seeking.</p>

  <p>He was leaning against the parapet, his elbows on the coping and his head
  sunk forward as though he were studying the rush of the tide below. The car
  pulled up near a policeman who was observing the lounger thoughtfully. The
  officer recognized the police surgeon and saluted.</p>

  <p>"Can't understand that bird, sir," he said. "He's been standing there for
  ten minutes. I'm keepin' an eye on him, because he looks to me like a suicide
  who's thinkin' it over!"</p>

  <p>Manfred approached the man, and suddenly, with a shock, saw his face. It
  was set in a grin&mdash;the eyes were wide open, the skin a coppery red.</p>

  <p>"Elver! Leon!"</p>

  <p>As Leon sprang from the car, Manfred touched the man's shoulder and he
  fell limply to the ground. In a second the doctor was on his knees by the
  side of the still figure.</p>

  <p>"Dead," he said laconically, and then: "Good God!"</p>

  <p>He pointed to the neck, where a red patch showed.</p>

  <p>"What is that?" asked Manfred steadily.</p>

  <p>"The snake!" said the doctor.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">V.&mdash;THE GOLDEN WOMAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BARBERTON had been stricken down in the heart of London,
  under the very eyes of the policeman, it proved.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I've had him under observation for a quarter of an hour. I saw
  him walking along the Embankment, admiring the view, long before he stopped
  here."</p>

  <p>"Did anybody go near him to speak to him?" asked Dr. Elver, looking
  up.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he stood by himself. I'll swear that nobody was within two yards
  of him. Of course, people have been passing to and fro, but I have been
  looking at him all the time, and I've not seen man or woman within yards of
  him, and my eyes were never off him."</p>

  <p>A second policeman had appeared on the scene, and he was sent across to
  Scotland Yard in Manfred's car for the ambulance and the police reserves
  necessary to clear and keep in circulation the gathering crowd. These
  returned simultaneously, and the two friends watched the pitiable thing
  lifted into a stretcher, and waited until the white-bodied vehicle had
  disappeared with its sad load before they returned to their machine.</p>

  <p>Gonsalez took his place at the wheel; George got in by his side. No word
  was spoken until they were back at Curzon Street. Manfred went in alone,
  whilst his companion drove the machine to the garage. When he returned, he
  found Poiccart and George deep in discussion.</p>

  <p>"You were right, Raymond." Leon Gonsalez stripped his thin coat and threw
  it on a chair. "The accuracy of your forecasts is almost depressing. I am
  waiting all the time for the inevitable mistake, and I am irritated when this
  doesn't occur. You said the snake would reappear, and the snake has
  reappeared. Prophesy now for me, O seer!"</p>

  <p>Poiccart's heavy face was gloomy; his dark eyes almost hidden under the
  frown that brought his bushy eyebrows lower.</p>

  <p>"One hasn't to be a seer to know that our association with Barberton will
  send the snake wriggling towards Curzon Street," he said. "Was it Gurther or
  Pfeiffer?"</p>

  <p>Manfred considered.</p>

  <p>"Pfeiffer, I think. He is the steadier of the two. Gurther has
  brain-storms; he is on the neurotic side. And that nine-thonged whip of
  yours, Leon, cannot have added to his mental stability. No, it was Pfeiffer,
  I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"I suppose the whip unbalanced him a little," said Leon. He thought over
  this aspect as though it were one worth consideration. "Gurther is a sort of
  Jekyll and Hyde, except that there is no virtue to him at all. It is
  difficult to believe, seeing him dropping languidly into his seat at the
  opera, that this exquisite young man in his private moments would not change
  his linen more often than once a month, and would shudder at the sound of a
  running bath-tap! That almost sounds as though he were a morphia fiend. I
  remember a case in '99... but I am interrupting you?"</p>

  <p>"What precautions shall you take, Leon?" asked George Manfred.</p>

  <p>"Against the snake?" Leon shrugged his shoulders. "The old military
  precaution against Zeppelin raids; the precaution the farmer takes against a
  plague of wasps. You cannot kneel on the chest of the vespa vulgaris and
  extract his sting with an anaesthetic. You destroy his nest&mdash;you bomb
  his hangar. Personally, I have never feared dissolution in any form, but I
  have a childish objection to being bitten by a snake."</p>

  <p>Poiccart's saturnine face creased for a moment in a smile. "You've no
  objection to stealing my theories," he said drily, and the other doubled up
  in silent laughter.</p>

  <p>Manfred was pacing the little room, his hands behind him, a thick Egyptian
  cigarette between his lips.</p>

  <p>"There's a train leaves Paddington for Gloucester at ten forty-five," he
  said. "Will you telegraph to Miss Goddard, Heavytree Farm, and ask her to
  meet the train with a cab? After that I shall want two men to patrol the
  vicinity of the farm day and night."</p>

  <p>Poiccart pulled open a drawer of the desk, took out a small book and ran
  his finger down the index.</p>

  <p>"I can get this service in Gloucester," he said. "Gordon, Williams,
  Thompson and Elfred&mdash;they're reliable people and have worked for us
  before."</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>"Send them the usual instructions by letter. I wonder who will be in
  charge of this Barberton case? If it's Meadows, I can work with him. On the
  other hand, if it's Arbuthnot, we shall have to get our information by
  subterranean methods."</p>

  <p>"Call Elver," suggested Leon, and George pulled the telephone towards
  him.</p>

  <p>It was some time before he could get into touch with Dr. Elver, and then
  he learnt, to his relief, that the redoubtable Inspector Meadows had complete
  charge.</p>

  <p>"He's coming up to see you," said Elver. "As a matter of fact, the chief
  was here when I arrived at the Yard, and he particularly asked Meadows to
  consult with you. There's going to be an awful kick at the Home Secretary's
  office about this murder. We had practically assured the Home Office that
  there would be no repetition of the mysterious deaths and that the snake had
  gone dead for good."</p>

  <p>Manfred asked a few questions and then hung up.</p>

  <p>"They are worried about the public&mdash;you never know what masses will
  do in given circumstances. But you can gamble that the English mass does the
  same thing&mdash;Governments hate intelligent crowds. This may cost the Home
  Secretary his job, poor soul! And he's doing his best."</p>

  <p>A strident shout in the street made him turn his head with a smile.</p>

  <p>"The late editions have got it&mdash;naturally. It might have been
  committed on their doorstep."</p>

  <p>"But why?" asked Poiccart "What was Barberton's offence?"</p>

  <p>"His first offence," said Leon promptly, without waiting for Manfred to
  reply, "was to go in search of Miss Mirabelle Leicester. His second and
  greatest was to consult with us. He was a dead man when he left the
  house."</p>

  <p>The faint sound of a bell ringing sent Poiccart down to the hall to admit
  an unobtrusive, middle-aged man, who might have been anything but what he
  was: one of the cleverest trackers of criminals that Scotland Yard had known
  in thirty years. A sandy-haired, thin-faced man, who wore pince-nez and
  looked like an actor, he had been a visitor to Curzon Street before, and now
  received a warm welcome. With little preliminary he came to the object of his
  call, and Manfred told him briefly what had happened, and the gist of his
  conversation with Barberton.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mirabelle Leicester is&mdash;" began Manfred.</p>

  <p>"Employed by Oberzohn&mdash;I know," was the surprising reply. "She came
  up to London this morning and took a job as laboratory assistant. I had no
  idea that Oberzohn &amp; Smitts had a laboratory on the premises."</p>

  <p>"They hadn't until a couple of days ago," interrupted Leon. "The
  laboratory was staged especially for her."</p>

  <p>Meadows nodded, then turned to Manfred.</p>

  <p>"He didn't give you any idea at all why he wanted to meet Miss
  Leicester?"</p>

  <p>George shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, he was very mysterious indeed on that subject," he said.</p>

  <p>"He arrived by the Benguella, eh?" said Meadows, making a note. "We ought
  to get something from the ship before they pay off their stewards. If a man
  isn't communicative on board ship, he'll never talk at all! And we may find
  something in his belongings. Would you like to come along, Manfred?"</p>

  <p>"I'll come with pleasure," said George gravely. "I may help you a
  little&mdash;you will not object to my making my own interpretation of what
  we see?"</p>

  <p>Meadows smiled.</p>

  <p>"You will be allowed your private mystery," he said.</p>

  <p>A taxi set them down at the Petworth Hotel in Norfolk Street, and they
  were immediately shown up to the room which the dead man had hired but had
  not as yet occupied. His trunk, still strapped and locked, stood on a small
  wooden trestle, his overcoat was hanging behind the door; in one corner of
  the room was a thick hold-all, tightly strapped, and containing, as they
  subsequently discovered, a weather-stained mackintosh, two well-worn blankets
  and an air pillow, together with a collapsible canvas chair, also showing
  considerable signs of usage. This was the object of their preliminary
  search.</p>

  <p>The lock of the trunk yielded to the third key which the detective tried.
  Beyond changes of linen and two suits, one of which was practically new and
  bore the tab of a store in St. Paul de Loanda, there was very little to
  enlighten them. They found an envelope full of papers, and sorted them out
  one by one on the bed. Barberton was evidently a careful man; he had
  preserved his hotel bills, writing on their backs brief but pungent comments
  about the accommodation he had enjoyed or suffered. There was an hotel in
  Lobuo which was full of vermin; there was one at Mossamedes of which he had
  written: "Rats ate one boot. Landlord made no allowance. Took three towels
  and pillow-slip."</p>

  <p>"One of the Four Just Men in embryo," said Meadows dryly.</p>

  <p>Manfred smiled.</p>

  <p>On the back of one bill were closely written columns of figures: "126,
  1315, 107, 1712, about 24," etc. Against a number of these figures the word
  "about" appeared, and Manfred observed that invariably this qualification
  marked one of the higher numbers. Against the 107 was a thick pencil
  mark.</p>

  <p>There were amongst the papers several other receipts. In St. Paul he had
  bought a "pistol automatic of precision" and ammunition for the same. The
  "pistol automatic of precision" was not in the trunk.</p>

  <p>"We found it in his pocket," said Meadows briefly. "That fellow was
  expecting trouble, and was entitled to, if it is true that they tortured him
  at Mosamodes."</p>

  <p>"Moss-AM-o-dees," Manfred corrected the mispronunciation. It almost
  amounted to a fad in him that to hear a place miscalled gave him a little
  pain.</p>

  <p>Meadows was reading a letter, turning the pages slowly.</p>

  <p>"This is from his sister: she lives at Brightlingsea, and there's nothing
  in it except... " He read a portion of the letter aloud:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"... thank you for the books. The children will appreciate
  them. It must have been like old times writing them&mdash;but I can
  understand how it helped pass the time. Mr. Lee came over and asked if I had
  heard from you. He is wonderful."</p><br>

  <p>The letter was in an educated hand.</p>

  <p>"He didn't strike me as a man who wrote books," said Meadows, and
  continued his search.</p>

  <p>Presently he unfolded a dilapidated map, evidently of Angola. It was
  rather on the small scale, so much so that it took in a portion of the
  Kalahari Desert in the south, and showed in the north the undulations of the
  rolling Congo.</p>

  <p>"No marks of any kind," said Meadows, carrying the chart to the window to
  examine it more carefully. "And that, I think, is about all&mdash;unless this
  is something."</p>

  <p>"This" was wrapped in a piece of cloth, and was fastened to the bottom and
  the sides of the trunk by two improvised canvas straps. Meadows tried to pull
  it loose and whistled.</p>

  <p>"Gold," he said. "Nothing else can weigh quite as heavily as this."</p>

  <p>He lifted out the bundle eventually, unwrapped the covering, and gazed in
  amazement on the object that lay under his eyes. It was an African bete, a
  nude, squat idol, rudely shaped, the figure of a native woman.</p>

  <p>"Gold?" said Manfred incredulously, and tried to lift it with his finger
  and thumb. He took a firmer grip and examined the discovery closely.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt that it was gold, and fine gold. His thumb-nail made a
  deep scratch in the base of the statuette. He could see the marks where the
  knife of the inartistic sculptor had sliced and carved.</p>

  <p>Meadows knew the coast fairly well: he had made many trips to Africa and
  had stopped off at various ports en route.</p>

  <p>"I've never seen anything exactly like it before," he said, "and it isn't
  recent workmanship either. When you see this"&mdash;he pointed to a physical
  peculiarity of the figure&mdash;"you can bet that you've got something that's
  been made at least a couple of hundred years, and probably before then. The
  natives of West and Central Africa have not worn toe-rings, for example,
  since the days of the Caesars."</p>

  <p>He weighed the idol in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Roughly ten pounds," he said. "In other words, eight hundred pounds'
  worth of gold."</p>

  <p>He was examining the cloth in which the idol had been wrapped, and uttered
  an exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Look at this," he said.</p>

  <p>Written on one corner, in indelible pencil, were the words:</p>

  <p>"Second shelf up left Gods lobby sixth."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Manfred remembered.</p>

  <p>"Would you have this figure put on the scales right away?" he said. "I'm
  curious to know the exact weight."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Meadows in surprise, as he rang the bell.</p>

  <p>The proprietor himself, who was aware that a police search was in
  progress, answered the call, and, at the detective's request, hurried down to
  the kitchen and returned in a few minutes with a pair of scales, which he
  placed on the table. He was obviously curious to know the purpose for which
  they were intended, but Inspector Meadows did not enlighten him, standing
  pointedly by the door until the gentleman had gone.</p>

  <p>The figure was taken from under the cloth where it had been hidden whilst
  the scales were being placed, and put in one shallow pan on the machine.</p>

  <p>"Ten pounds seven ounces," nodded Manfred triumphantly. "I thought that
  was the one!"</p>

  <p>"One what?" asked the puzzled Meadows.</p>

  <p>"Look at this list."</p>

  <p>Manfred found the hotel bill with the rows of figures and pointed to the
  one which had a black cross against it.</p>

  <p>"107," he said. "That is our little fellow, and the explanation is fairly
  plain. Barberton found some treasure-house filled with these statues. He took
  away the lightest. Look at the figures! He weighed them with a spring
  balance, one of those which register up to 21 lb. Above that he had to
  guess&mdash;he puts 'about 24,' 'about 22.'"</p>

  <p>Meadows looked at his companion blankly, but Manfred was not deceived.
  That clever brain of the detective was working.</p>

  <p>"Not for robbery&mdash;the trunk is untouched. They did not even burn his
  feet to find the idol or the treasure house: they must have known nothing of
  that. It was easy to rob him&mdash;or, if they knew of his gold idol, they
  considered it too small loot to bother with."</p>

  <p>He looked slowly round the apartment. On the mantelshelf was a slip of
  brown paper like a pipe-spill. He picked it up, looked at both sides, and,
  finding the paper blank, put it back where he had found it. Manfred took it
  down and absently drew the strip between his sensitive finger-tips.</p>

  <p>"The thing to do," said Meadows, taking one final look round, "is to find
  Miss Leicester."</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is one of the things," he said slowly. "The other, of course, is to
  find Johnny."</p>

  <p>"Johnny?" Meadows frowned suspiciously. "Who is Johnny?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Johnny is my private mystery." George Manfred was smiling. "You promised
  me that I might have one!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">VI.&mdash;IN CHESTER SQUARE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Mirabelle Leicester went to Chester Square, her
  emotions were a curious discord of wonder, curiosity and embarrassment. The
  latter was founded on the extraordinary effusiveness of her companion, who
  had suddenly, and with no justification, assumed the position of dearest
  friend and lifelong acquaintance. Mirabelle thought the girl was an actress:
  a profession in which sudden and violent friendships are not a rare
  occurrence. She wondered why Aunt Alma had not made an effort to come to
  town, and wondered more that she had known of Alma's friendship with the
  Newtons. That the elder woman had her secrets was true, but there was no
  reason why she should have refrained from speaking of a family who were close
  enough friends to be asked to chaperon her in town.</p>

  <p>She had time for thought, for Joan Newton chattered away all the time, and
  if she asked a question, she either did not wait for approval, or the
  question was answered to her satisfaction before it was put.</p>

  <p>Chester Square, that dignified patch of Belgravia, is an imposing quarter.
  The big house into which the girl was admitted by a footman had that air of
  luxurious comfort which would have appealed to a character less responsive to
  refinement than Mirabelle Leicester's. She was ushered into a big
  drawing-room which ran from the front to the back of the house, and did not
  terminate even there, for a large, cool conservatory, bright with flowers,
  extended a considerable distance.</p>

  <p>"Monty isn't back from the City yet," Joan rattled on. "My dear! He's
  awfully busy just now, what with stocks and shares and things like that."</p>

  <p>She spoke as though "stocks and shares and things like that" were
  phenomena which had come into existence the day before yesterday for the
  occupation of Monty Newton.</p>

  <p>"Is there a boom?" asked Mirabelle with a smile, and the term seemed to
  puzzle the girl.</p>

  <p>"Ye-es, I suppose there is. You know what the Stock Exchange is, my dear?
  Everybody connected with it is wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice. The
  money they make is simply wicked! And they can give a girl an awfully good
  time&mdash;theatres, parties, dresses, pearls&mdash;why, Monty would think
  nothing of giving a string of pearls to a girl if he took a liking to
  her!"</p>

  <p>In truth Joan was walking on very uncertain ground. Her instructions had
  been simple and to the point. "Get her to Chester Gardens, make friends with
  her, and don't mention the fact that I know Oberzohn." What was the object of
  bringing Mirabelle Leicester to the house, what was behind this move of
  Monty's, she did not know. She was merely playing for safety, baiting the
  ground, as it were, with her talk of good times and vast riches, in case that
  was required of her. For she, no less than many of her friends, entertained a
  wholesome dread of Monty Newton's disapproval, which usually took a definite
  unpleasant shape.</p>

  <p>Mirabelle was laughing softly.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know that stockbrokers were so rich," she said dryly, "and I can
  assure you that some of them aren't!"</p>

  <p>She passed tactfully over the gaucherie of the pearls that Monty would
  give to any girl who took his fancy. By this time she had placed Joan: knew
  something of her upbringing, guessed pretty well the extent of her
  intelligence, and marvelled a little that a man of the unknown Mr. Newton's
  position should have allowed his sister to come through the world without the
  benefit of a reasonably good education.</p>

  <p>"Come up to your room, my dear," said Joan. "We've got a perfectly topping
  little suite for you, and I'm sure you'll be comfortable. It's at the front
  of the house, and if you can get used to the milkmen yowling about the
  streets before they're aired, you'll have a perfectly topping time."</p>

  <p>When Mirabelle inspected the apartment she was enchanted. It fulfilled
  Joan's vague description. Here was luxury beyond her wildest dreams. She
  admired the silver bed and the thick blue carpet, the silken panelled walls,
  the exquisite fittings, and stood in rapture before the entrance of a little
  bathroom, with its silver and glass, its shaded lights and marble walls.</p>

  <p>"I'll have a cup of tea sent up to you, my dear. You'll want to rest after
  your horrible day at that perfectly terrible factory, and I wonder you can
  stand Oberzohn, though they tell me he's quite a nice man... "</p>

  <p>She seemed anxious to go, and Mirabelle was no less desirous of being
  alone.</p>

  <p>"Come down when you feel like it," said Joan at parting, and ran down the
  stairs, reaching the hall in time to meet Mr. Newton, who was handing his hat
  and gloves to his valet.</p>

  <p>"Well, is she here?"</p>

  <p>"She's here all right," said Joan, who was not at all embarrassed by the
  presence of the footman. "Monty, isn't she a bit of a fool? She couldn't say
  boo to a goose. What is the general scheme?"</p>

  <p>He was brushing his hair delicately in the mirror above the
  hall-stand.</p>

  <p>"What's what scheme?" he asked, after the servant had gone, as he strolled
  into the drawing-room before her.</p>

  <p>"Bringing her here&mdash;is she sitting into a game?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be stupid," said Monty without heat, as he dropped wearily to a low
  divan and drew a silken cushion-behind him. "Nor inquisitive," he added. "You
  haven't scared her, have you?"</p>

  <p>"I like that!" she said indignantly.</p>

  <p>She was one of those ladies who speak more volubly and with the most
  assurance when there is a mirror in view, and she had her eyes fixed upon
  herself all the time she was talking, patting a strand of hair here and
  there, twisting her head this way and that to get a better effect, and never
  once looking at the man until he drew attention to himself.</p>

  <p>"Scared! I'll bet she's never been to such a beautiful house in her life!
  What is she, Monty? A typist or something? I don't understand her."</p>

  <p>"She's a lady," said Monty offensively. "That's the type that'll always
  seem like a foreign language to you."</p>

  <p>She lifted one shoulder delicately.</p>

  <p>"I don't pretend to be a lady, and what I am, you've made me," she said,
  and the reproach was mechanical. He had heard it before, not only from her,
  but from others similarly placed. "I don't think it's very kind to throw my
  education up in my face, considering the money I've made for you."</p>

  <p>"And for yourself." He yawned. "Get me some tea."</p>

  <p>"You might say 'please' now and again," she said resentfully, and he
  smiled as he took up the evening paper, paying her no more attention, until
  she had rung the bell with a vicious jerk and the silver tray came in and was
  deposited on a table near him.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going to-night?"</p>

  <p>His interest in her movements was unusual, and she was flattered.</p>

  <p>"You know very well, Monty, where I'm going to-night," she said
  reproachfully. "You promised to take me, too. I think you'd look wonderful as
  a Crusader&mdash;one of them&mdash;those old knights in armour."</p>

  <p>He nodded, but not to her comment.</p>

  <p>"I remember, of course&mdash;the Arts Ball."</p>

  <p>His surprise was so well simulated that she was deceived.</p>

  <p>"Fancy your forgetting! I'm going as Cinderella, and Minnie Gray is going
  as a pierrette&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Minnie Gray isn't going as anything," said Monty, sipping his tea. "I've
  already telephoned to her to say that the engagement is off. Miss Leicester
  is going with you."</p>

  <p>"But, Monty&mdash;" protested the girl.</p>

  <p>"Don't 'but Monty' me," he ordered. "I'm telling you! Go up and see this
  girl, and put it to her that you've got a ticket for the dance."</p>

  <p>"But her costume, Monty! The girl hasn't got a fancy dress. And
  Minnie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forget Minnie, will you? Mirabelle Leicester is going to the Arts Ball
  to-night." He tapped the tray before him to emphasize every word. "You have a
  ticket to spare, and you simply can't go alone because I have a very
  important business engagement and your friend has failed you. Her dress will
  be here in a few minutes: it is a bright green domino with a bright red
  hood."</p>

  <p>"How perfectly hideous!" She forgot for the moment her disappointment in
  this outrage. "Bright green! Nobody has a complexion to stand that!"</p>

  <p>Yet he ignored her.</p>

  <p>"You will explain to Miss Leicester that the dress came from a friend who,
  through illness or any cause you like to invent, is unable to go to the
  dance&mdash;she'll jump at the chance. It is one of the events of the year
  and tickets are selling at a premium."</p>

  <p>She asked him what that meant, and he explained patiently.</p>

  <p>"Maybe she'll want to spend a quiet evening&mdash;have one of those
  headaches," he went on. "If that is so, you can tell her that I've got a
  party coming to the house to-night, and they will be a little noisy. Did she
  want to know anything about me?"</p>

  <p>"No, she didn't," snapped Joan promptly. "She didn't want to know about
  anything. I couldn't get her to talk. She's like a dumb oyster."</p>

  <p>Mirabelle was sitting by the window, looking down into the square, when
  there was a gentle tap at the door and Joan came in.</p>

  <p>"I've got wonderful news for you," she said.</p>

  <p>"For me?" said Mirabelle in surprise.</p>

  <p>Joan ran across the room, giving what she deemed to be a surprisingly
  life-like representation of a young thing full of innocent joy.</p>

  <p>"I've got an extra ticket for the Arts Ball to-night. They're selling at
  a&mdash;they're very expensive. Aren't you a lucky girl!"</p>

  <p>"I?" said Mirabelle in surprise. "Why am I the lucky one?"</p>

  <p>Joan rose from the bed and drew back from her reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"You surely will come with me? If you don't, I shan't able to go at all.
  Lady Mary and I were going together... now she's sick!"</p>

  <p>Mirabelle opened her eyes wider.</p>

  <p>"But I can't go, surely. It is a fancy dress ball, isn't it? I read
  something about it in the papers. And I'm awfully tired to-night."</p>

  <p>Joan pouted prettily.</p>

  <p>"My dear, if you lay down for an hour you'd be fit. Besides, you couldn't
  sleep here early to-night: Monty's having one of his men parties, and they're
  a noisy lot of people&mdash;though thoroughly respectable," she added
  hastily.</p>

  <p>Poor Joan had a mission outside her usual range.</p>

  <p>"I'd love to go,"&mdash;Mirabelle was anxious not to be a
  kill-joy&mdash;"if I could get a dress."</p>

  <p>"I've got one," said the girl promptly, and ran out of the room.</p>

  <p>She returned very quickly, and threw the domino on the bed.</p>

  <p>"It's not pretty to look at, but it's got this advantage, that you can
  wear almost anything underneath."</p>

  <p>"What time does the ball start?" Mirabelle, examining her mind, found that
  she was not averse to going; she was very human, and a fancy dress ball would
  be a new experience.</p>

  <p>"Ten o'clock," said Joan. "We can have dinner before Monty's friends
  arrive. You'd like to see Monty, wouldn't you? He's downstairs&mdash;such a
  gentleman, my dear!"</p>

  <p>The girl could have laughed.</p>

  <p>A little later she was introduced to the redoubtable Monty, and found his
  suave and easy manner a relief after the jerky efforts of the girl to be
  entertaining. Monty had seen most parts of the world and could talk
  entertainingly about them all. Mirabelle rather liked him, though she thought
  he was something of a fop, yet was not sorry when she learned that, so far
  from having friends to dinner, he did not expect them to arrive until after
  she and Joan had left.</p>

  <p>The meal put her more at her ease. He was a polished man of the world,
  courteous to the point of pomposity; he neither said nor suggested one thing
  that could offend her; they were half-way through dinner when the cry of a
  newsboy was heard in the street. Through the dining-room window she saw the
  footman go down the steps and buy a newspaper. He glanced at the stop-press
  space and came back slowly up the stairs reading. A little later he came into
  the room, and must have signalled to her host, for Monty went out immediately
  and she heard their voices in the passage. Joan was uneasy.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what's the matter?" she asked, a little irritably. "It's very
  bad manners to leave ladies in the middle of dinner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At that moment Monty came back. Was it imagination on her part, or had he
  gone suddenly pale? Joan saw it, and her brows met, but she was too wise to
  make a comment upon his appearance.</p>

  <p>Mr. Newton seated himself in his place with a word of apology and poured
  out a glass of champagne. Only for a second did his hand tremble, and then,
  with a smile, he was his old self.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong, Monty?"</p>

  <p>"Wrong? Nothing," he said curtly, and took up the topic of conversation
  where he had laid it down before leaving the room.</p>

  <p>"It isn't that old snake, is it?" asked Joan with a shiver. "Lord! that
  unnerves me! I never go to bed at night without looking under, or turning the
  clothes right down to the foot! They ought to have found it months ago if the
  police&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this point she caught Monty Newton's eye, cold, menacing, malevolent,
  and the rest of her speech died on her lips.</p>

  <p>Mirabelle went upstairs to dress, and Joan would have followed but the man
  beckoned her.</p>

  <p>"You're a little too talkative, Joan," he said, more mildly than she had
  expected. "The snake is not a subject we wish to discuss at dinner. And
  listen!" He walked into the passage and looked round, then came back and
  closed the door. "Keep that girl near you."</p>

  <p>"Who is going to dance with me?" she asked petulantly. "I like having a
  hell of a lively night!"</p>

  <p>"Benton will be there to look after you, and one of the 'Old
  Guard'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw the frightened look in her face and chuckled. "What's the matter,
  you fool?" he asked good-humouredly. "He'll dance with the girl."</p>

  <p>"I wish those fellows weren't going to be there," she said uneasily, but
  he went on, without noticing her:</p>

  <p>"I shall arrive at half-past eleven. You had better meet me near the
  entrance to the American bar. My party didn't turn up, you understand. You'll
  get back here at midnight."</p>

  <p>"So soon?" she said in dismay. "Why, it doesn't end till&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll be back here at midnight," he said evenly. "Go into her room,
  clear up everything she may have left behind. You understand? Nothing is to
  be left."</p>

  <p>"But when she comes back she'll&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She'll not come back," said Monty Newton, and the girl's blood ran
  cold.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">VII.&mdash;"MORAL SUASION"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"THERE'S a man wants to see you, governor."</p>

  <p>It was a quarter-past nine. The girls had been gone ten minutes, and
  Montague Newton had settled himself down to pass the hours of waiting before
  he had to dress. He put down the patience cards he was shuffling.</p>

  <p>"A man to see me? Who is he, Fred?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know: I've never seen him before. Looks to me like a 'busy.'"</p>

  <p>A detective! Monty's eyebrows rose, but not in trepidation. He had met
  many detectives in the course of his chequered career and had long since lost
  his awe of them.</p>

  <p>"Show him in," he said with a nod.</p>

  <p>The slim man in evening dress who came softly into the room was a stranger
  to Monty, who knew most of the prominent figures in the world of criminal
  detection. And yet his face was in some way familiar.</p>

  <p>"Captain Newton?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That is my name." Newton rose with a smile.</p>

  <p>The visitor looked slowly round towards the door through which the footman
  had gone.</p>

  <p>"Do your servants always listen at the keyhole?" he asked, in a quiet,
  measured tone, and Newton's face went a dusky red. In two strides he was at
  the door and had flung it open, just in time to see the disappearing heels of
  the footman.</p>

  <p>"Here, you!" He called the man back, a scowl on his face. "If you want to
  know anything, will you come in and ask?" he roared. "If I catch you
  listening at my door, I'll murder you!"</p>

  <p>The man with a muttered excuse made a hurried escape.</p>

  <p>"How did you know?" growled Newton, as he came back into the room and
  slammed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"I have an instinct for espionage," said the stranger, and went on,
  without a break: "I have called for Miss Mirabelle Leicester."</p>

  <p>Newton's eyes narrowed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you have, have you?" he said softly. "Miss Leicester is not in the
  house. She left a quarter of an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"I did not see her come out of the house."</p>

  <p>"No, the fact is, she went out by way of the mews. My&mdash;er "&mdash;he
  was going to say "sister" but thought better of it&mdash;"my young
  friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Flash Jane Smith," said the stranger. "Yes?"</p>

  <p>Newton's colour deepened. He was rapidly reaching the point when his
  sang-froid, nine-tenths of his moral assets, was in danger of deserting
  him.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, anyway?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The stranger wetted his lips with the tip of his tongue, a curiously
  irritating action of his, for some inexplicable reason.</p>

  <p>"My name is Leon Gonsalez," he said simply.</p>

  <p>Instinctively the man drew back. Of course! Now he remembered, and the
  colour had left his cheeks, leaving him grey. With an effort he forced a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"One of the redoubtable Four Just Men? What extraordinary birds you are!"
  he said. "I remember ten-fifteen years ago, being scared out of my life by
  the very mention of your name&mdash;you came to punish where the law failed,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"You must put that in your reminiscences," said Leon gently. "For the
  moment I am not in an autobiographical mood."</p>

  <p>But Newton could not be silenced.</p>

  <p>"I know a man"&mdash;he was speaking slowly, with quiet
  vehemence&mdash;"who will one day cause you a great deal of inconvenience,
  Mr. Leon Gonsalez: a man who never forgets you in his prayers. I won't tell
  you who he is."</p>

  <p>"It is unnecessary. You are referring to the admirable Oberzohn. Did I not
  kill his brother... ? Yes, I thought I was right. He was the man with the
  oxycephalic head and the queerly prognathic jaw. An interesting case: I would
  like to have had his measurements, but I was in rather a hurry."</p>

  <p>He spoke almost apologetically for his haste.</p>

  <p>"But we're getting away from the subject, Mr. Newton. You say this young
  lady has left your house by the mews, and you were about to suggest she left
  in the care of Miss&mdash;I don't know what you call her. Why did she leave
  that way?"</p>

  <p>Leon Gonsalez had something more than an instinct for espionage: he had an
  instinct for truth, and he knew two things immediately: first, that Newton
  was not lying when he said the girl had left the house; secondly, that there
  was an excellent, but not necessarily a sinister, reason for the furtive
  departure.</p>

  <p>"Where has she gone?"</p>

  <p>"Home," said the other laconically. "Where else should she go?"</p>

  <p>"She came to dinner... intending to stay the night?"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Gonsalez," interrupted Monty Newton savagely. "You and your
  gang were wonderful people twenty years ago, but a lot has happened since
  then&mdash;and we don't shiver at the name of the Three Just Men. I'm not a
  child&mdash;do you get that? And you're not so very terrible at close range.
  If you want to complain to the police&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Meadows is outside. I persuaded him to let me see you first," said Leon,
  and Newton started.</p>

  <p>"Outside?" incredulously.</p>

  <p>In two strides he was at the window and had pulled aside the blind. On the
  other side of the street a man was standing on the edge of the sidewalk,
  intently surveying the gutter. He knew him at once.</p>

  <p>"Well, bring him in," he said.</p>

  <p>"Where has this young lady gone? That is ail I want to know."</p>

  <p>"She has gone home, I tell you."</p>

  <p>Leon went to the door and beckoned Meadows; they spoke together in low
  tones, and then Meadows entered the room and was greeted with a stiff nod
  from the owner of the house.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea of this, Meadows&mdash;sending this bird to cross-examine
  me?"</p>

  <p>"This bird came on his own," said Meadows coldly, "if you mean Mr.
  Gonsalez? I have no right to prevent any person from cross-examining you.
  Where is the young lady?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you, she has gone home. If you don't believe me, search the
  house&mdash;either of you."</p>

  <p>He was not bluffing: Leon was sure of that. He turned to the
  detective.</p>

  <p>"I personally have no wish to trouble this gentleman any more."</p>

  <p>He was leaving the room when, from over his shoulder: "That snake is busy
  again, Newton."</p>

  <p>"What snake are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>"He killed a man to-night on the Thames Embankment. I hope it will not
  spoil Lisa Marthon's evening."</p>

  <p>Meadows, watching the man, saw him change colour.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean," he said loudly.</p>

  <p>"You arranged with Lisa to pick up Barberton to-night and get him talking.
  And there she is, poor girl, all dressed to kill, and only a dead man to
  vamp&mdash;only a murdered man." He turned suddenly, and his voice grew hard.
  "That is a good word, isn't it, Newton&mdash;murder?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know anything about it."</p>

  <p>As Newton's hand came towards the bell: "We can show ourselves out," said
  Leon.</p>

  <p>He shut the door behind him, and presently there was a slam of the outer
  door, Monty got to the window too late to see his unwelcome guests depart,
  and went up to his room to change, more than a little perturbed in mind.</p>

  <p>The footman called him from the hall.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry about that affair, sir. I thought it was a 'busy'."</p>

  <p>"You think too much, Fred"&mdash;Newton threw the words down at his
  servitor with a snarl. "Go back to your place&mdash;which is the servants'
  hall. I'll ring you if I want you."</p>

  <p>He resumed his progress up the stairs and the man turned sullenly
  away.</p>

  <p>He opened the door of his room, switched on the light, had closed the door
  and was half-way to his dressing-table, when an arm like steel closed round
  his neck, he was jerked suddenly backward on to the floor, and looked up into
  the inscrutable face of Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>"Shout and you die!" whispered a voice in his ear.</p>

  <p>Newton lay quiet.</p>

  <p>"I'll fix you for this," he stammered.</p>

  <p>The other shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think not, if by 'fixing' me you mean you're going to complain to the
  police. You've been under my watchful eye for quite a long time, Monty
  Newton, and you'll be amazed to learn that I've made several visits to your
  house. There is a little wall safe behind that curtain"&mdash;he nodded
  towards the corner of the room&mdash;"would you be surprised to learn that
  I've had the door open and every one of its documentary contents
  photographed?"</p>

  <p>He saw the fear in the man's eyes as he snapped a pair of aluminium
  handcuffs of curious design about Monty's wrists. With hardly an effort he
  lifted him, heavy as he was, threw him on the bed, and, having locked the
  door, returned, and, sitting on the bed, proceeded first to strap his ankles
  and then leisurely to take off his prisoner's shoes.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" asked Monty in alarm.</p>

  <p>"I intend finding out where Miss Leicester has been taken," said Gonsalez,
  who had stripped one shoe and, pulling off the silken sock, was examining the
  man's bare foot critically. "Ordinary and strictly legal inquiries take time
  and fail at the end&mdash;unfortunately for you, I have not a minute to
  spare."</p>

  <p>"I tell you she's gone home."</p>

  <p>Leon did not reply. He pulled open a drawer of the bureau, searched for
  some time, and presently found what he sought: a thin silken scarf. This,
  despite the struggles of the man on the bed, he fastened about his mouth.</p>

  <p>"In Mosamodes," he said&mdash;"and if you ever say that before my friend
  George Manfred, be careful to give its correct pronunciation: he is rather
  touchy on the point&mdash;some friends of yours took a man named Barberton,
  whom they subsequently murdered, and tried to make him talk by burning his
  feet. He was a hero. I'm going to see how heroic you are."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake don't do it!" said the muffled voice of Newton.</p>

  <p>Gonsalez was holding a flat metal case which he had taken from his pocket,
  and the prisoner watched him, fascinated, as he removed the lid, and snapped
  a cigar-lighter close to its blackened surface. A blue flame rose and swayed
  in the draught.</p>

  <p>"The police force is a most excellent institution," said Leon. He had
  found a silver shoe-horn on the table and was calmly heating it in the light
  of the flame, holding the rapidly warming hook with a silk handkerchief. "But
  unfortunately, when you are dealing with crimes of violence, moral suasion
  and gentle treatment produce nothing more poignant in the bosom of your
  adversary than a sensation of amused and derisive contempt. The English, who
  make a god of the law, gave up imprisoning thugs and flogged them, and there
  are few thugs left. When the Russian gunmen came to London, the authorities
  did the only intelligent thing&mdash;they held back the police and brought up
  the artillery, having only one desire, which was to kill the gunmen at any
  expense. Violence fears violence. The gunman lives in the terror of the
  gun&mdash;by the way, I understand the old guard is back in full
  strength?"</p>

  <p>When Leon started in this strain he could continue for hours.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean," mumbled Monty.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't." The intruder lifted the blackened, smoking shoe-horn,
  brought it as near to his face as he dared.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think that will do," he said, and came slowly towards the bed.</p>

  <p>The man drew up his feet in anticipation of pain, but a long hand caught
  him by the ankles and drew them straight again.</p>

  <p>"They've gone to the Arts Ball." Even through the handkerchief the voice
  sounded hoarse.</p>

  <p>"The Arts Ball?" Gonsalez looked down at him, and then, throwing the hot
  shoe-horn into the fire-place, he removed the gag. "Why have they gone to the
  Arts Ball?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted them out of the way to-night."</p>

  <p>"Is Oberzohn likely to be at the Arts Ball?"</p>

  <p>"Oberzohn?" The man's laugh bordered on the hysteric.</p>

  <p>"Or Gurther?"</p>

  <p>This time Mr. Newton did not laugh.</p>

  <p>"I don't know who you mean," he said.</p>

  <p>"We'll go into that later," replied Leon lightly, pulling the knot of the
  handkerchief about the ankles. "You may get up now. What time do you expect
  them back?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I told Joan not to hurry, as I was meeting somebody here
  to-night."</p>

  <p>Which sounded plausible. Leon remembered that the Arts Ball was a fancy
  dress affair, and there was some reason for the departure from the mews
  instead of from the front of the house. As though he were reading his
  thoughts, Newton said:</p>

  <p>"It was Miss Leicester's idea, going through the back. She was rather
  shy... she was wearing a domino."</p>

  <p>"Colour?"</p>

  <p>"Green, with a reddish hood."</p>

  <p>Leon looked at him quickly.</p>

  <p>"Rather distinctive. Was that the idea?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what the idea was," growled Newton, sitting on the edge of
  the bed and pulling on a sock. "But I do know this, Gonsalez," he said, with
  an outburst of anger which was half fear; "that you'll be sorry you did this
  to me!"</p>

  <p>Leon walked to the door, turned the key and opened it.</p>

  <p>"I only hope that you will not be sorry I did not kill you," he said, and
  was gone.</p>

  <p>Monty Newton waited until from his raised window he saw the slim figure
  pass along the sidewalk and disappear round a corner, and then he hurried
  down, with one shoe on and one off, to call New Cross 93.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">VIII.&mdash;THE HOUSE OF OBERZOHN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN a triangle, two sides of which were expressed by the
  viaducts of converging railroads and the base by the dark and sluggish waters
  of the Grand Surrey Canal, stood the gaunt ruins of a store in which had once
  been housed the merchandise of the 0.&amp;S. Company. A Zeppelin in passing
  had dropped an incendiary bomb at random, and torn a great ugly gap in the
  roof. The fire that followed left the iron frames of the windows twisted and
  split; the roof by some miracle remained untouched except for the blackened
  edges about the hole through which the flames had rushed to the height of a
  hundred feet.</p>

  <p>The store was flush with the canal towing-path; barges had moored here,
  discharging rubber in bales, palm nut, nitrates even, and had restocked with
  Manchester cloth and case upon case of Birmingham-made geegaws of brass and
  lacquer.</p>

  <p>Mr. Oberzohn invariably shipped his spirituous cargoes from Hamburg, since
  Germany is the home of synthesis. In the centre of the triangle was a
  red-brick villa, more unlovely than the factory, missing as it did that
  ineffable grandeur, made up of tragedy and pathos, attaching to a burnt-out
  building, however ugly it may have been in its prime.</p>

  <p>The villa was built from a design in Mr. Oberzohn's possession, and was
  the exact replica of the house in Sweden where he was born. It had high,
  gabled ends at odd and unexpected places. The roof was shingled with grey
  tiles; there were glass panels in the curious-looking door, and iron
  ornaments in the shape of cranes and dogs flanking the narrow path through
  the rank nettle and dock which constituted his garden.</p>

  <p>Here he dwelt, in solitude, yet not in solitude, for two men lived in the
  house, and there was a stout Swedish cook and a very plain Danish maid, a
  girl of vacant countenance, who worked from sun-up to midnight without
  complaint, who seldom spoke and never smiled. The two men were somewhere in
  the region of thirty. They occupied the turret rooms at each end of the
  building, and had little community of interest. They sometimes played cards
  together with an old and greasy pack, but neither spoke more than was
  necessary. They were lean, hollow-faced men, with a certain physiognomical
  resemblance. Both had thin, straight lips; both had round, staring, dark eyes
  filled with a bright but terrifying curiosity.</p>

  <p>"They look," reported Leon Gonsalez, when he went to examine the ground,
  "as if they are watching pigs being killed and enjoying every minute of it.
  Iwan Pfeiffer is one, Sven Gurther is the other. Both have escaped the
  gallows or the axe in Germany; both have convictions against them. They are
  typical German-trained criminals, as pitiless as wolves. Dehumanized."</p>

  <p>The "Three," as was usual, set the machinery of the law in motion, and
  found that the hands of the police were tied. Only by stretching the law
  could the men be deported, and the law is difficult to stretch. To all
  appearance they offended in no respect. A woman, by no means the most
  desirable of citizens, laid a complaint against one. There was an
  investigation&mdash;proof was absent; the very character of the complainant
  precluded a conviction, and the matter was dropped&mdash;by the police.</p>

  <p>Somebody else moved swiftly.</p>

  <p>One morning, just before daybreak, a policeman patrolling the tow-path
  heard a savage snarl and looked round for the dog. He found instead, up one
  of those narrow entries leading to the canal bank, a man. He was tied to the
  stout sleeper fence, and his bare back showed marks of a whip. Somebody had
  held him up at night as he prowled the bank in search of amusement, had tied
  and flogged him. Twenty-five lashes: an expert thought the whip used was the
  official cat-o'-nine-tails.</p>

  <p>Scotland Yard, curious, suspicious, sought out the Three Just Men. They
  had alibis so complete as to be unbreakable. Sven Gurther went
  unavenged&mdash;but he kept from the tow-path thereafter.</p>

  <p>In this house of his there were rooms which only Dr. Oberzohn visited. The
  Danish maid complained to the cook that when she had passed the door of one
  as the doctor came out, a blast of warm, tainted air had rushed out and made
  her cough for an hour. There was another room in which from time to time the
  doctor had installed a hotchpotch of apparatus. Vulcanizing machines,
  electrical machines (older and more used than Mirabelle had seen in her brief
  stay in the City Road), a liquid air plant, not the most up-to-date but
  serviceable.</p>

  <p>He was not, curiously enough, a doctor in the medical sense. He was not
  even a doctor of chemistry. His doctorate was in Literature and Law. These
  experiments of his were hobbies&mdash;hobbies that he had pursued from his
  childhood.</p>

  <p>On this evening he was sitting in his stuffy parlour reading close-printed
  and closer-reasoned volume of German philosophy, and thinking of something
  else. Though the sun had only just set, the blinds and curtains were drawn; a
  wood fire crackled in the grate, and the bright lights of three half-watt
  lamps made glaring radiance.</p>

  <p>An interruption came in the shape of a telephone call. He listened,
  grunting replies.</p>

  <p>"So!" he said at last, and spoke a dozen words in his strange English.</p>

  <p>Putting aside his book, he hobbled in his velvet slippers across the room
  and pressed twice upon the bell-push by the side of the fire-place. Gurther
  came in noiselessly and stood waiting.</p>

  <p>He was grimy, unshaven. The pointed chin and short upper lip were blue.
  The V of his shirt visible above the waistcoat was soiled and almost black at
  the edges. He stood at attention, smiling vacantly, his eyes fixed at a point
  above the doctor's head.</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn lifted his eyes from his book.</p>

  <p>"I wish you to be a gentleman of club manner to-night," he said. He spoke
  in that hard North-German tongue which the Swede so readily acquires.</p>

  <p>"Ja, Herr Doktor!"</p>

  <p>The man melted from the room.</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn for some reason hated Germans. So, for the matter of that,
  did Gurther and Pfeiffer, the latter being Polish by extraction and Russian
  by birth. Gurther hated Germans because they stormed the little jail at
  Altostadt to kill him after the dogs found Frau Siedlitz's body. He would
  have died then but for the green police, who scented a Communist rising,
  scattered the crowd and sent Gurther by road to the nearest big town under
  escort. The two escorting policemen were never seen again. Gurther reappeared
  mysteriously in England two years after, bearing a veritable passport. There
  was no proof even that he was Gurther&mdash;Leon knew, Manfred knew, Poiccart
  knew.</p>

  <p>There had been an alternative to the whipping.</p>

  <p>"It would be a simple matter to hold his head under water until he was
  drowned," said Leon.</p>

  <p>They debated the matter, decided against this for no sentimental or moral
  reason&mdash;none save expediency. Gurther had his whipping and never knew
  how near to the black and greasy water of the canal he had been.</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn resumed his book&mdash;a fascinating book that was all about
  the human soul and immortality and time. He was in the very heart of an
  analysis of eternity when Gurther reappeared dressed in the "gentleman-club
  manner." The dress-coat fitted perfectly; shirt and waistcoat were exactly
  the right cut. The snowy shirt, the braided trousers, the butterfly bow, and
  winged collar...</p>

  <p>"That is good." Dr. Oberzohn went slowly over the figure. "But the studs
  should be pearl&mdash;not enamel. And the watch-chain is demode&mdash;it is
  not worn. The gentleman-club manner does not allow of visible ornament. Also
  I think a moustache... ?"</p>

  <p>"Ja, Herr Doktor!"</p>

  <p>Gurther, who was once an actor, disappeared again. When he returned the
  enamel studs had gone: there were small pearls in their place, and his white
  waistcoat had no chain across. And on his upper lip had sprouted a small
  brown moustache, so natural that even Oberzohn, scrutinizing closely, could
  find no fault with it. The doctor took a case from his pocket, fingered out
  three crisp notes.</p>

  <p>"Your hands, please?"</p>

  <p>Gurther took three paces to the old man, halted, clicked his heels and
  held out his hands for inspection.</p>

  <p>"Good! You know Leon Gonsalez? He will be at the Arts Ball. He wears no
  fancy dress. He was the man who whipped you."</p>

  <p>"He was the man who whipped me," said Gurther without heat.</p>

  <p>There was a silence, Dr. Oberzohn pursing his lips.</p>

  <p>"Also, he did that which brands him as an infamous assassin... I think...
  yes, I think my dear Gurther... there will be a girl also, but the men of my
  police will be there to arrange such matters. Benton will give you
  instructions. For you, only Gonsalez."</p>

  <p>Gurther bowed stiffly.</p>

  <p>"I have implored the order," he said, bowed again and withdrew. Later, Dr.
  Oberzohn heard the drone of the little car as it bumped and slithered across
  the grass to the road. He resumed his book: this matter of eternity was
  fascinating.</p>

  <p>The Arts Ball at the Corinthian Hall as one of the events of the season,
  and the tickets, issued exclusively to the members of three clubs, were
  eagerly sought by society people who could not be remotely associated with
  any but the art of living.</p>

  <p>When the girl came into the crowded hall, she looked around in wonder. The
  balconies, outlined in soft lights and half-hidden with flowers, had been
  converted into boxes; the roof had been draped with blue and gold tissue; at
  one end of the big hall was a veritable bower of roses, behind which one of
  the two bands was playing. Masks in every conceivable guise were swinging
  rhythmically across the polished floor. To the blase, there was little
  difference between the Indians, the pierrots and the cavaliers to be seen
  here and those they had seen a hundred times on a hundred different
  floors.</p>

  <p>As the girl gazed round in wonder and delight, forgetting all her
  misgivings, two men, one in evening dress, the other in the costume of a
  brigand, came from under the shadow of the balcony towards them.</p>

  <p>"Here are our partners," said Joan, with sudden vivacity. '"Mirabelle, I
  want you to know Lord Evington."</p>

  <p>The man in evening dress stroked his little moustache, clicked his heels
  and bent forward in a stiff bow. He was thin-faced, a little pallid,
  unsmiling. His round, dark eyes surveyed her for a second, and then:</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to meet you, Miss Leicester," he said, in a high, harsh voice,
  that had just the trace of a foreign accent.</p>

  <p>This struck the girl with as much surprise as the cold kiss he had
  implanted upon her hand, and, as if he read her thoughts, he went on
  quickly:</p>

  <p>"I have lived so long abroad that England and English manners are strange
  to me. Won't you dance? And had you not better mask? I must apologise to you
  for my costume." He shrugged his shoulders. "But there was no gala dress
  available."</p>

  <p>She fixed the red mask, and in another second she was gliding through the
  crowd and was presently lost to view.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand it all, Benton."</p>

  <p>Joan was worried and frightened. She had begun to realize that the game
  she played was something different... her part more sinister than any role
  she had yet filled. To jolly along the gilded youth to the green tables of
  Captain Monty Newton was one thing; but never before had she seen the gang
  working against a woman.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," grumbled the brigand, who was not inaptly arrayed.
  "There's been a hurry call for everybody." He glanced round uneasily as
  though he feared his words might be overheard. "All the guns are
  here&mdash;Defson, Cuccini, Jewy Stubbs... "</p>

  <p>"The guns?" she whispered in horror, paling under her rouge. "You mean...
  ?"</p>

  <p>"The guns are out: that's all I know," he said doggedly. "They started
  drifting in half an hour before you came."</p>

  <p>Joan was silent, her heart racing furiously. Then Monty had told her the
  truth. She knew that somewhere behind Oberzohn, behind Monty Newton, was a
  force perfectly dovetailed into the machine, only one cog of which she had
  seen working. These card parties of Monty's were profitable enough, but for a
  long time she had had a suspicion that they were the merest side-line. The
  organization maintained a regular corps of gunmen, recruited from every
  quarter of the globe. Monty Newton talked sometimes in his less sober moments
  of what he facetiously described as the "Old Guard." How they were employed,
  on what excuse, for what purpose, she had never troubled to think. They came
  and went from England in batches. Once Monty had told her that Oberzohn's
  people had gone to Smyrna, and he talked vaguely of unfair competition that
  had come to the traders of the 0.&amp;S. outfit. Afterwards she read in the
  paper of a "religious riot" which resulted in the destruction by fire of a
  great block of business premises. After that Monty spoke no more of
  competition. The Old Guard returned to England, minus one of its number, who
  had been shot in the stomach in the course of this "religious riot." What
  particular faith he possessed in such a degree as to induce him to take up
  arms for the cause, she never learned. She knew he was dead, because Monty
  had written to the widow, who lived in the Bronx.</p>

  <p>Joan knew a lot about Monty's business, for an excellent reason. She was
  with him most of the time; and whether she posed as his niece or daughter,
  his sister, or some closer relationship, she was undoubtedly the nearest to a
  confidante he possessed.</p>

  <p>"Who is that man with the moustache&mdash;is he one?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No; he's Oberzohn's man&mdash;for God's sake don't tell Monty I told you
  all this! I got orders to-night to put wise about the girl."</p>

  <p>"What about her... what are they doing with her?" she gasped in
  terror.</p>

  <p>"Let us dance," said Benton, and half guided, half carried her into the
  throng. They had reached the centre of the floor when, with no warning, every
  light in the hall went out.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">IX.&mdash;BEFORE THE LIGHTS WENT OUT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE band had stopped, a rustle of hand-clapping came from
  the hot dancers, and almost before the applause had started the second band
  struck up "Kulloo."</p>

  <p>Mirabelle was not especially happy. Her partner was the most correct of
  dancers, but they lacked just that unity of purpose, the oneness of interest
  which makes all the difference between the ill-and the well-matched.</p>

  <p>"May we sit down?" she begged. "I am rather hot."</p>

  <p>"Will the gracious lady come to the little hall?" he asked. "It is cooler
  there, and the chairs are comfortable."</p>

  <p>She looked at him oddly.</p>

  <p>"'Gracious lady' is a German expression&mdash;why do you use it, Lord
  Evington? I think it is very pretty," she hastened to assure him.</p>

  <p>"I lived for many years in Germany," said Mr. Gurther. "I do not like the
  German people&mdash;they are so stupid."</p>

  <p>If he had said "German police" he would have been nearer to the truth; and
  had he added that the dislike was mutual, he might have gained credit for his
  frankness.</p>

  <p>At the end of the room, concealed by the floral decorations of the
  bandstand, was a door which led to a smaller room, ordinarily separated from
  the main hall by folding doors which were seldom opened. To-night the annexe
  was to be used as a conservatory. Palms and banked flowers were everywhere.
  Arbours had been artificially created, and the cosy nooks, half-hidden by
  shrubs, secluded seats and tables, all that ingenuity could design to meet
  the wishes of sitters-out.</p>

  <p>He stood invitingly at the entrance of a little grotto, dimly illuminated
  by one Chinese lantern.</p>

  <p>"I think we will sit in the open," said Mirabelle, and pulled out a
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me."</p>

  <p>Instantly he was by her side, the chair arranged, a cushion found, and she
  sank down with a sigh of relief. It was early yet for the loungers: looking
  round, she saw that, but for a solitary waiter fastening his apron with one
  eye upon possible customers, they were alone.</p>

  <p>"You will drink wine... no? An orangeade? Good!" He beckoned the waiter
  and gave his order. "You must excuse me if I am a little strange. I have been
  in Germany for many years&mdash;except during the war, when I was in
  France."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gurther had certainly been in Germany for many years, but he had never
  been in France. Nor had he heard a shot fired in the war. It is true that an
  aerial bomb had exploded perilously near the prison at Mainz in which he was
  serving ten years for murder, but that represented his sole warlike
  experience.</p>

  <p>"You live in the country, of course?"</p>

  <p>"In London: I am working with Mr. Oberzohn."</p>

  <p>"So: he is a good fellow. A gentleman."</p>

  <p>She had not been very greatly impressed by the doctor's breeding, but it
  was satisfying to hear a stranger speak with such heartiness of her new
  employer. Her mind at the moment was on Heavytree Farm: the cool parlour with
  its chintzes&mdash;a room, at this hour, fragrant with the night scents of
  flowers which came stealing through the open casement. There was a
  fox-terrier, Jim by name, who would be wandering disconsolately from room to
  room, sniffing unhappily at the hall door. A lump came up into her throat.
  She felt very far from home and very lonely. She wanted to get up and run
  back to where she had left Joan and tell her that she had changed her mind
  and must go back to Gloucester that night... she looked impatiently for the
  waiter. Mr. Gurther was fiddling with some straws he had taken from the glass
  container in the centre of the table. One end of the straws showed above the
  edge of the table, the others were thrust deep in the wide-necked little
  bottle he had in the other hand. The hollow straws held half an inch of the
  red powder that filled the bottle.</p>

  <p>"Excuse!"</p>

  <p>The waiter put the orangeades on the table and went away to get change.
  Mirabelle's eyes were wistfully fixed on a little door at the end of the
  room. It gave to the street, and there were taxicabs which could get her to
  Paddington in ten minutes.</p>

  <p>When she looked round he was stirring the amber contents of her glass with
  a spoon. Two straws were invitingly protruding from the foaming orangeade.
  She smiled and lifted the glass as he fitted a cigarette into his black
  holder.</p>

  <p>"I may smoke&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>The first taste she had through the straws was one of extreme bitterness.
  She made a wry face and put down the glass.</p>

  <p>"How horrid!"</p>

  <p>"Did it taste badly... ?" he began, but she was pouring out water from a
  bottle.</p>

  <p>"It was most unpleasant&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you try mine, please?" He offered the glass to her and she drank.
  "It may have been something in the straw." Here he was telling her the
  fact.</p>

  <p>"It was... "</p>

  <p>The room was going round and round, the floor was rising up and down like
  the deck of a ship in a stormy sea. She rose, swayed, and caught him by the
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Open the little door, waiter, please&mdash;the lady is faint."</p>

  <p>The waiter turned to the door and threw it open. A man stood
  there&mdash;just outside the door. He wore over his dinner dress a long cloak
  in the Spanish style. Gurther stood staring, a picture of amused dismay, his
  cigarette still unlit. He did not move his hands. Gonsalez was waiting there,
  alert... death grinning at him... and then the room went inky black. Somebody
  had turned the main switch.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X.&mdash;WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FIVE, ten minutes passed before the hall-keeper tripped and
  stumbled and cursed his way to the smaller room and, smashing down the hired
  flowers, he passed through the wreckage of earthen pots and tumbled mould to
  the control. Another second and the rooms were brilliantly lit
  again&mdash;the band struck up a two-step and fainting ladies were escorted
  to the decent obscurity of their retiring rooms.</p>

  <p>The manager of the hall came flying into the annexe.</p>

  <p>"What happened&mdash;the main fuse gone?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the hall-keeper sourly, "some fool turned over the switch."</p>

  <p>The agitated waiter protested that nobody had been near the
  switch-box.</p>

  <p>"There was a lady and gentleman here, and another gentleman outside." He
  pointed to the open door.</p>

  <p>"Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. The lady was faint."</p>

  <p>The three had disappeared when the manager went out into a small courtyard
  that led round the corner of the building to a side street. Then he came back
  on a tour of inspection.</p>

  <p>"Somebody did it from the yard. There's a window open&mdash;you can reach
  the switch easily."</p>

  <p>The window was fastened and locked.</p>

  <p>"There is no lady or gentleman in the yard," he said. "Are you sure they
  did not go into the big hall?"</p>

  <p>"In the dark&mdash;maybe."</p>

  <p>The waiter's nervousness was understandable. Mr. Gurther had given him a
  five-pound note and the man had not as yet delivered the change. Never would
  he return to claim it if all that his keen ears heard was true.</p>

  <p>Four men had appeared in the annexe: one shut the door and stood by it.
  The three others were accompanied by the manager, who called Phillips, the
  waiter.</p>

  <p>"This man served them," he said, troubled. Even the most innocent do not
  like police visitations. "What was the gentleman like?"</p>

  <p>Phillips gave a brief and not inaccurate description.</p>

  <p>"That is your man, I think, Herr Fluen?"</p>

  <p>The third of the party was bearded and plump; he wore a Derby hat with
  evening dress.</p>

  <p>"That is Gurther," he nodded. "It will be a great pleasure to meet him.
  For eight months the Embassy has been striving for his extradition. But our
  people at home... !"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders. All properly constituted officials behave in
  such a manner when they talk of Governments.</p>

  <p>"The lady now"&mdash;Inspector Meadows was patently worried&mdash;"she was
  faint, you say. Had she drunk anything?"</p>

  <p>"Orangeade&mdash;there is the glass. She said there was something nasty in
  the straws. These."</p>

  <p>Phillips handed them to the detective. He wetted his fin from them,
  touched his tongue and spat out quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, and went out by the little door.</p>

  <p>Gonsalez, of course: but where had he gone, and how, with a drugged girl
  on his hands and the Child of the Snake? Gurther was immensely quick to
  strike, and an icy-hearted man: the presence of a woman would not save
  Leon.</p>

  <p>"When the light went out&mdash;" began the waiter, and the trouble cleared
  from Mr. Meadows's face.</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;I had forgotten that," he said softly. "The lights went
  out!"</p>

  <p>All the way back to the Yard he was trying to bring something from the
  back of his mind&mdash;something that was there, the smooth tip of it
  tantalizingly displayed, yet eluding every grasp. It had nothing to do with
  the lights&mdash;nor Gonsalez, nor yet the girl. Gurther? No. Nor Manfred?
  What was it? A name had been mentioned to him that day&mdash;it had a
  mysterious significance. A golden idol! He picked up the end of the
  thought... Johnny! Manfred's one mystery. That was the dust which lay on all
  thought. And now that he remembered he was disappointed. It was so
  ridiculously unimportant a matter to baffle him.</p>

  <p>He left his companions at the corner of Curzon Street and went alone to
  the house. There was a streak of light showing between the curtains in the
  upstairs room. The passage was illuminated&mdash;Poiccart answered his ring
  at once.</p>

  <p>"Yes, George and Leon were here a little time back&mdash;the girl? No,
  they said nothing about a girl. They looked rather worried, I thought. Miss
  Leicester, I suppose? Won't you come in?"</p>

  <p>"No, I can't wait. There's a light in Manfred's room."</p>

  <p>The ghost of a smile lit the heavy face and faded as instantly.</p>

  <p>"My room also," he said. "Butlers take vast liberties in the absence of
  their masters. Shall I give a message to George?"</p>

  <p>"Ask him to call me at the Yard."</p>

  <p>Poiccart closed the door on him; stopped in the passage to arrange a
  salver on the table and hung up a hat. All this Meadows saw through the
  fanlight and walking-stick periscope which is so easily fitted and can be of
  such value. And seeing, his doubts evaporated.</p>

  <p>Poiccart went slowly up the stairs into the little office room, pulled
  back the curtains and opened the window at the top. The next second, the
  watching detective saw the light go out and went away.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to keep you in the dark," said Poiccart.</p>

  <p>The men who were in the room waited until the shutters were fast and the
  curtains pulled across, and then the light flashed on. White of face, her
  eyes closed, her breast scarcely moving, Mirabelle Leicester lay on the long
  settee. Her domino was a heap of shimmering green and scarlet on the floor,
  and Leon was gently sponging her face, George Manfred watching from the back
  of the settee, his brows wrinkled.</p>

  <p>"Will she die?" he asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know: they sometimes die of that stuff," replied Leon
  cold-bloodedly. "She must have had it pretty raw. Gurther is a crude
  person."</p>

  <p>"What was it?" asked George.</p>

  <p>Gonsalez spread out his disengaged hand in a gesture of uncertainty.</p>

  <p>"If you can imagine morphia with a kick in it, it was that. I don't know.
  I hope she doesn't die: she is rather young&mdash;it would be the worst of
  bad luck."</p>

  <p>Poiccart stirred uneasily. He alone had within his soul what Leon would
  call "a trace" of sentiment.</p>

  <p>"Could we get Elver?" he asked anxiously, and Leon looked up with his
  boyish smile. "Growing onions in Seville has softened you, Raymondo mio!" He
  never failed in moments of great strain to taunt the heavy man with his two
  years of agricultural experiment, and they knew that the gibes were
  deliberately designed to steady his mind. "Onions are sentimental
  things&mdash;they make you cry: a vegetable muchos simpatico! This woman is
  alive!"</p>

  <p>Her eyelids had fluttered twice. Leon lifted the bare arm, inserted the
  needle of a tiny hypodermic and pressed home the plunger.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow she will feel exactly as if she had been drunk," he said
  calmly, "and in her mouth will be the taste of ten rank cigars. Oh,
  señorinetta, open thy beautiful eyes and look upon thy friends!"</p>

  <p>The last sentence was in Spanish. She heard: the lids fluttered and
  rose.</p>

  <p>"You're a long way from Heavytree Farm, Miss Leicester."</p>

  <p>She looked up wonderingly into the kindly face of George Manfred.</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" she asked faintly, and closed her eyes again with a grimace
  of pain.</p>

  <p>"They always ask that&mdash;just as they do in books," said Leon
  oracularly. "If they don't say 'Where am I?' they ask for their mothers.
  She's quite out of danger."</p>

  <p>One hand was on her wrist, another at the side of her neck.</p>

  <p>"Remarkably regular. She has a good head&mdash;mathematical probably."</p>

  <p>"She is very beautiful," said Poiccart in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>"All people are beautiful&mdash;just as all onions are beautiful. What is
  the difference between a lovely maid and the ugliest of duennas&mdash;what
  but a matter of pigmentation and activity of tissue? Beneath that, an
  astounding similarity of the circulatory, sustentacular,
  motorvascular&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How long have we got?" Manfred interrupted him, and Leon shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;not long, I should think. Of course, we could have
  told Meadows and he'd have turned out police reserves, but I should like to
  keep them out of it."</p>

  <p>"The Old Guard was there?"</p>

  <p>"Every man jack of them&mdash;those tough lads! They will be here just as
  soon as the Herr Doktor discovers what is going forward. Now, I think you can
  travel. I want her out of the way."</p>

  <p>Stooping, he put his hands under her and lifted her. The strength in his
  frail body was a never-ending source of wonder to his two friends.</p>

  <p>They followed him down the stairs and along the short passage, down
  another flight to the kitchen. Manfred opened a door and went out into the
  paved yard. There was a heavier door in the boundary wall. He opened this
  slowly and peeped out. Here was the inevitable mews. The sound of an engine
  running came from a garage near by. Evidently somebody was on the look out
  for them. A long-bodied car drew up noiselessly and a woman got out. Beside
  the driver at the wheel sat two men.</p>

  <p>"I think you'll just miss the real excitement," said Gonsalez, and then to
  the nurse he gave a few words of instruction and closed the door on her.</p>

  <p>"Take the direct road," he said to the driver. "Swindon&mdash;Gloucester.
  Good night."</p>

  <p>"Good night, sir."</p>

  <p>He watched anxiously as the machine swung into the main road. Still he
  waited, his head bent. Two minutes went by, and the faint sound of a
  motor-horn, a long blast and a short, and he sighed.</p>

  <p>"They're clear of the danger zone," he said.</p>

  <p>Plop!</p>

  <p>He saw the flash, heard the smack of the bullet as it struck the door, and
  his hand stiffened. There was a thudding sound&mdash;a scream of pain from a
  dark corner of the mews and the sound of voices. Leon drew back into the yard
  and bolted the door.</p>

  <p>"He had a new kind of silencer. Oberzohn is rather a clever old bird. But
  my air pistol against their gun for noiselessness."</p>

  <p>"I didn't expect the attack from that end of the mews." Manfred was
  slipping a Browning back to his pocket.</p>

  <p>"If they had come from the other end the car would not have
  passed&mdash;I'd like to get one of those silencers."</p>

  <p>They went into the house. Poiccart had already extinguished the passage
  light.</p>

  <p>"You hit your man&mdash;does that thing kill?"</p>

  <p>"By accident&mdash;it is possible. I aimed at his stomach: I fear that I
  hit him in the head. He would not have squealed for a stomach wound. I fear
  he is alive."</p>

  <p>He felt his way up the stairs and took up the telephone. Immediately a
  voice said, "Number?"</p>

  <p>"Give me 8877 Treasury."</p>

  <p>He waited, and then a different voice asked: "Yes&mdash;Scotland Yard
  speaking."</p>

  <p>"Can you give me Mr. Meadows?"</p>

  <p>Manfred was watching him frowningly.</p>

  <p>"That you, Meadows?... They have shot Leon Gonsalez&mdash;can you send
  police reserves and an ambulance?"</p>

  <p>"At once."</p>

  <p>Leon hung up the receiver, hugging himself. "The idea being&mdash;?" said
  Poiccart.</p>

  <p>"These people are clever." Leon's voice was charged with admiration. "They
  haven't cut the wires&mdash;they've simply tapped it at one end and thrown it
  out of order on the exchange side."</p>

  <p>"Phew!" Manfred whistled. "You deceived me&mdash;you were talking to
  Oberzohn?"</p>

  <p>"Captain Monty and Lew Cuccini. They may or may not be deceived, but if
  they aren't, we shall know all about it."</p>

  <p>He stopped dead. There was a knock on the front door, a single, heavy
  knock. Leon grinned delightedly.</p>

  <p>"One of us is now supposed to open an upper window cautiously and look
  out, whereupon he is instantly gunned. I'm going to give these fellows a
  scare."</p>

  <p>He ran up the stairs to the top floor, and on the landing, outside an
  attic door, pulled at a rope. A fire ladder lying flat against the ceiling
  came down, and at the same time a small skylight opened. Leon went into the
  room, and his pocket-lamp located what he needed: a small papier-mache
  cylinder, not unlike a seven-pound shell. With this on his arm, he climbed up
  the ladder on to the roof, fixed the cylinder on a flat surface, and,
  striking a match, lit a touch-paper. The paper sizzled and spluttered, there
  was a sudden flash and "boom!" a dull explosion, and a white ball shot up
  into the sky, described a graceful curve and burst into a shower of brilliant
  crimson stars. He waited till the last died out; then, with the hot cylinder
  under his arm, descended the ladder, released the rope that held it in place,
  and returned to his two friends.</p>

  <p>"They will imagine a secret arrangement of signals with the police," he
  said; "unless my knowledge of their psychology is at fault, we shall not be
  bothered again."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later there was another knock at the door, peremptory, almost
  official in its character.</p>

  <p>"This," said Leon, "is a policeman to summon us for discharging fireworks
  in the public street!"</p>

  <p>He ran lightly down into the hall and without hesitation pulled open the
  door. A tall, helmeted figure stood on the doorstep, notebook in hand.</p>

  <p>"Are you the gentleman that let off that rocket&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>Leon walked past him, and looked up and down Curzon Street. As he had
  expected, the Old Guard had vanished.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">XI.&mdash;GURTHER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MONTY NEWTON dragged himself home, a weary angry man, and
  let himself in with his key. He found the footman lying on the floor of the
  hall asleep, his greatcoat pulled over him, and stirred him to wakefulness
  with the toe of his boot.</p>

  <p>"Get up," he growled. "Anybody been here?"</p>

  <p>Fred rose, a little dazed, rubbing his eyes.</p>

  <p>"The old man's in the drawing-room," he said, and his employer passed on
  without another word.</p>

  <p>As he opened the door, he saw that all the lights in the drawing-room were
  lit. Dr. Oberzohn had pulled a small table near the fire, and before this he
  sat bolt upright, a tiny chess-board before him; immersed in a problem. He
  looked across to the new-corner for a second and then resumed his study of
  the board, made a move...</p>

  <p>"Ach!" he said in tones of satisfaction. "Leskina was wrong! It is
  possible to mate in five moves!"</p>

  <p>He pushed the chessmen into confusion and turned squarely to face
  Newton.</p>

  <p>"Well, have you concluded these matters satisfactorily?"</p>

  <p>"He brought up the reserves," said Monty, unlocking a tantalus on a side
  table and helping himself liberally to whisky. "They got Cuccini through the
  jaw. Nothing serious."</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn laid his bony hands on his knees.</p>

  <p>"Gurther must be disciplined," he said. "Obviously he has lost his nerve;
  and when a man loses his nerve also he loses his sense of time. And his
  timing&mdash;how deplorable! The car had not arrived; my excellent police had
  not taken position... deplorable!"</p>

  <p>"The police are after him: I suppose you know that?" Newton looked over
  his glass.</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn nodded.</p>

  <p>"The extradition so cleverly avoided is now accomplished. But Gurther is
  too good a man to be lost. I have arranged a hiding-place for him. He is of
  many uses."</p>

  <p>"Where did he go?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn's eyebrows wrinkled up and down.</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" he said. "He has the little machine. Maybe he has gone to the
  house&mdash;the green light in the top window will warn him and he will move
  carefully."</p>

  <p>Newton walked to the window and looked out Chester Square looked ghostly
  in the grey light of dawn. And then, out of the shadows, he saw a figure move
  and walk slowly towards the south side of the square. "They're watching this
  house," he said, and laughed.</p>

  <p>"Where is my young lady?" asked Oberzohn, who was staring glumly into the
  fire.</p>

  <p>"I don't know... there was a car pulled out of the mews as one of our men
  'closed' the entrance. She has probably gone back to Heavytree Farm, and you
  can sell that laboratory of yours. There is only one way now, and that's the
  rough way. We have time&mdash;we can do a lot in six weeks. Villa is coming
  this morning&mdash;I wish we'd taken that idol from the trunk. That may put
  the police on to the right track."</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn pursed his lips as though he were going to whistle, but he
  was guilty of no such frivolity.</p>

  <p>"I am glad they found him," he said precisely. "To them it will be a
  scent. What shall they think, but that the unfortunate Barberton had come
  upon an old native treasure-house? No, I do not fear that" He shook his head.
  "Mostly I fear Mr. Johnson Lee and the American, Elijah Washington."</p>

  <p>He put his hand into his jacket pocket and took out a thin pad of letters.
  "Johnson Lee is for me difficult to understand. For what should a gentleman
  have to do with this boor that he writes so friendly letters to him?"</p>

  <p>"How did you get these?"</p>

  <p>"Villa took them: it was one of the intelligent actions also to leave the
  statue."</p>

  <p>He passed one of the letters across to Newton. It was addressed "Await
  arrival, Paste Restante, Mosamedes." The letter was written in a curiously
  round, boyish hand. Another remarkable fact was that it was perforated across
  the page at regular intervals, and upon the lines formed by this perforation
  Mr. Johnson Lee wrote:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Dear B.," the letter ran, "I have instructed my bankers to
  cable you £500. I hope this will carry you through and leave enough to pay
  your fare home. You may be sure that I shall not breathe a word, and your
  letters, of course, nobody in the house can read but me. Your story is
  amazing and I advise you to come home at once and see Miss Leicester.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Your friend,</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Johnson Lee</span>."</p><br>

  <p>The note-paper was headed <i>"Rath Hall, January 13th."</i></p>

  <p>"They came to me to-day. If I had seen them before, there would have been
  no need for the regrettable happening."</p>

  <p>He looked thoughtfully at his friend. "They will be difficult: I had that
  expectation," he said; and Monty knew that he referred to the Three Just Men.
  "Yet they are mortal also&mdash;remember that, my Newton: they are mortal
  also."</p>

  <p>"As we are," said Newton gloomily</p>

  <p>"That is a question," said Oberzohn, "so far as I am concerned."</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn never jested; he spoke with the greatest calm and assurance.
  The other man could only stare at him.</p>

  <p>Although it was light, a green lamp showed clearly in the turret room of
  the doctor's house as he came within sight of the ugly place. And, seeing
  that warning, he did not expect to be met in the passage by Gurther. The man
  had changed from his resplendent kit and was again in the soiled and shabby
  garments he had discarded the night before.</p>

  <p>"You have come, Gurther?"</p>

  <p>"Ja, Herr Doktor."</p>

  <p>"To my parlour!" barked Dr. Oberzohn, and marched ahead.</p>

  <p>Gurther followed him and stood with his back to the door, erect, his chin
  raised, his bright, curious eyes fixed on a point a few inches above his
  master's head.</p>

  <p>"Tell me now." The doctor's ungainly face was working ludicrously.</p>

  <p>"I saw the man and struck, Herr Doktor, and then the lights went out and I
  went to the floor, expecting him to shoot... I think he must have taken the
  gracious lady. I did not see, for there was a palm between us. I returned at
  once to the greater hall, and walked through the people on the floor. They
  were very frightened."</p>

  <p>"You saw them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Herr Doktor," said Gurther. "It is not difficult for me to see in
  the dark. After that I ran to the other entrance, but they were gone."</p>

  <p>"Come here."</p>

  <p>The man took two stilted paces towards the doctor and Oberzohn struck him
  twice in the face with the flat of his hand. Not a muscle of the man's face
  moved: he stood erect, his lips framed in a half-grin, his curious eyes
  staring straight ahead.</p>

  <p>"That is for bad time, Gurther. Nobody saw you return?"</p>

  <p>"No, Herr Doktor, I came on foot."</p>

  <p>"You saw the light?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Herr Doktor, and I thought it best to be here."</p>

  <p>"You were right," said Oberzohn. "March!"</p>

  <p>He went into the forbidden room, turned the key, and passed into the
  super-heated atmosphere. Gurther stood attentively at the door. Presently the
  doctor came out, carrying a long case covered with baize under his arm. He
  handed it to the waiting man, went into the room, and, after a few minutes'
  absence, returned with a second case, a little larger.</p>

  <p>"March!" he said.</p>

  <p>Gurther followed him out of the house and across the rank, weed-grown
  "garden" towards the factory. A white mist had rolled up from the canal, and
  factory and grounds lay under the veil.</p>

  <p>He led the way through an oblong gap in the wall where once a door had
  stood, and followed a tortuous course through the blackened beams and twisted
  girders that littered the floor. Only a half-hearted attempt had been made to
  clear up the wreckage after the fire, and the floor was ankle-deep in charred
  shreds of burnt cloth. Near the far end of the building, Oberzohn stopped,
  put down his box and pushed aside the ashes with his foot until he had
  cleared a space about three feet square. Stooping, he grasped an iron ring
  and pulled, and a flagstone came up with scarcely an effort, for it was well
  counter-weighted. He took up the box again and descended the stone stairs,
  stopping only to turn on a light.</p>

  <p>The vaults of the store had been practically untouched by the fire. There
  were shelves that still carried dusty bales of cotton goods. Oberzohn was in
  a hurry. He crossed the stone floor in two strides, pulled down the bar of
  another door, and, walking into the darkness, deposited his box on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>The electric power of the factory had, in the old days, been carried on
  two distinct circuits, and the connection with the vaults was practically
  untouched by the explosion.</p>

  <p>They were in a smaller room now, fairly comfortably furnished. Gurther
  knew it well, for it was here that he had spent the greater part of his first
  six months in England. Ventilation came through three small gratings near the
  roof. There was a furnace, and, as Gurther knew, an ample supply of fuel in
  one of the three cellars that opened into the vault.</p>

  <p>"Here will you stay until I send for you," said Oberzohn. "To-night,
  perhaps, after they have searched. You have a pistol?"</p>

  <p>"Ja, Herr Doktor."</p>

  <p>"Food, water, bedding&mdash;all you need." Oberzohn jerked open another of
  the cellars and took stock of the larder. "To-night I may come for
  you&mdash;to-morrow night&mdash;who knows? You will light the fire at once."
  He pointed to the two baize-covered boxes. "Good morning, Gurther."</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Herr Doktor."</p>

  <p>Oberzohn went up to the factory level, dropped the trap and his foot
  pushed back the ashes which hid its presence, and with a cautious look round
  he crossed the field to his house. He was hardly in his study before the
  first police car came bumping along the lane.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">XII.&mdash;LEON THEORIZES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MAKING inquiries, Detective-Inspector Meadows discovered
  that, on the previous evening at eight o'clock, two men had called upon
  Barberton. The first of these was described as tall and rather aristocratic
  in appearance. He wore dark, horn-rimmed spectacles. The hotel manager
  thought he might have been an invalid, for he walked with a stick. The second
  man seemed to have been a servant of some kind, for he spoke respectfully to
  the visitor.</p>

  <p>"No, he gave no name, Mr. Meadows," said the manager. "I told him of the
  terrible thing which had happened to Mr. Barberton, and he was so upset that
  I didn't like to press the question."</p>

  <p>Meadows was on his circuitous way to Curzon Street when he heard this, and
  he arrived in time for breakfast. Manfred's servants regarded it as the one
  eccentricity of an otherwise normal gentleman that he invariably breakfasted
  with his butler and chauffeur. This matter had been discussed threadbare in
  the tiny servants' hall, and it no longer excited comment when Manfred
  telephoned down to the lower regions and asked for another plate.</p>

  <p>The Triangle were in cheerful mood. Leon Gonsalez was especially bright
  and amusing, as he invariably was after such a night as he had spent.</p>

  <p>"We searched Oberzohn's house from cellar to attic," said Meadows when the
  plate had been laid.</p>

  <p>"And of course you found nothing. The elegant Gurther?"</p>

  <p>"He wasn't there. That fellow will keep at a distance if he knows that
  there's a warrant out for him. I suspect some sort of signal. There was a
  very bright green light burning in one of those ridiculous Gothic turrets."
  Manfred stifled a yawn.</p>

  <p>"Gurther went back soon after midnight," he said, "and was there until
  Oberzohn's return."</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" asked the astonished detective.</p>

  <p>Leon nodded, his eyes twinkling.</p>

  <p>"After that, one of those infernal river mists blotted out observation,"
  he said, "but I should imagine Herr Gurther is not far away. Did you see his
  companion, Pfeiffer?"</p>

  <p>Meadows nodded. "Yes, he was cleaning boots when I arrived."</p>

  <p>"How picturesque!" said Gonzalez. "I think he will have a valet the next
  time be goes to prison, unless the system has altered since your days,
  George?"</p>

  <p>George Manfred, who had once occupied the condemned cell in Chelmsford
  Prison, smiled.</p>

  <p>"An interesting man, Gurther," mused Gonsalez. "I have a feeling that he
  will escape hanging. So you could not find him? I found him last night. But
  for the lady, who was both an impediment and an interest, we might have put a
  period to his activities." He caught Meadows' eye. "I should have handed him
  to you, of course."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said the detective dryly.</p>

  <p>"A remarkable man, but nervous. You are going to see Mr. Johnson Lee?"</p>

  <p>"What made you say that?" asked the detective in astonishment, for he had
  not as yet confided his intention to the three men.</p>

  <p>"He will surprise you," said Leon. "Tell me, Mr. Meadows: when you and
  George so thoroughly and carefully searched Barberton's box, did you find
  anything that was suggestive of his being a cobbler, let us say&mdash;or a
  bookbinder?"</p>

  <p>"I think in his sister's letter there was a reference to the books he had
  made. I found nothing particular except an awl and a long oblong of wood
  which was covered with pinpricks. As a matter of fact, when I saw it my first
  thought was that, living the kind of life he must have done in the
  wilderness, it was rather handy to be able to repair his own shoes. The idea
  of bookbinding is a new one."</p>

  <p>"I should say he never bound a book in his life, in the ordinary sense of
  the word," remarked Manfred; "and as Leon says, you will find Johnson Lee a
  very surprising man."</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"I have just been on the telephone to him," he said. "You'll have to be
  careful of Mr. Lee Meadows. Our friend the snake may be biting his way, and
  will, if he hears a breath of suspicion that he was in Barberton's
  confidence."</p>

  <p>The detective put down his knife and fork.</p>

  <p>"I wish you fellows would stop being mysterious," he said, half annoyed,
  half amused. "What is behind this business? You talk of the snake as though
  you could lay your hands on him."</p>

  <p>"And we could," they said in unison.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" challenged the detective.</p>

  <p>"The Herr Doktor," smiled Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>"Oberzohn?"</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>"I thought you would have discovered that by connecting the original three
  murders together&mdash;and murders they were. First"&mdash;he ticked the
  names off on his fingers&mdash;"we have a stockbroker. This gentleman was a
  wealthy speculator who occasionally financed highly questionable deals. Six
  months before his death he drew from the bank a very large sum of money in
  notes. By an odd coincidence the bank clerk, going out to luncheon, saw his
  client and Oberzohn driving past in a taxicab, and as they came abreast he
  saw a large blue envelope go into Oberzohn's pocket. The money had been put
  into a blue envelope when it was drawn. The broker had financed the doctor,
  and when the scheme failed and the money was lost, he not unnaturally asked
  for its return. He trusted Oberzohn not at all; carried his receipt about in
  his pocket, and never went anywhere unless he was armed&mdash;that fact did
  not emerge at the inquest, but you know it is true."</p>

  <p>Meadows nodded.</p>

  <p>"He threatened Oberzohn with exposure at a meeting they had in Winchester
  Street, on the day of his death. That night he returns from a theatre or from
  his club, and is found dead on the doorstep. No receipt is found. What
  follows?</p>

  <p>"A man, a notorious blackmailer, homeless and penniless, was walking along
  the Bayswater Road, probably looking for easy money, when he saw the broker's
  car going into Orme Place. He followed on the off-chance of begging a few
  coppers. The chauffeur saw him. The tramp, on the other hand, must have seen
  something else. He slept the next night at Rowton House, told a friend, who
  had been in prison with him, that he had a million pounds as good as in his
  hand... "</p>

  <p>Meadows laughed helplessly.</p>

  <p>"Your system of investigation is evidently more thorough than ours!"</p>

  <p>"It is complementary to yours," said George quietly. "Go on, Leon."</p>

  <p>"Now what happened to our friend the burglar? He evidently saw somebody in
  Orme Place whom he either recognized or trailed to his home. For the next day
  or two he was in and out of public telephone booths, though no number has
  been traced. He goes to Hyde Park, obviously by appointment&mdash;and the
  snake bites!</p>

  <p>"There was another danger to the confederacy. The bank clerk, learning of
  the death of the client, is troubled. I have proof that he called Oberzohn on
  the 'phone. If you remember, when the broker's affairs were gone into, it was
  found that he was almost insolvent. A large sum of money had been drawn out
  of the bank and paid to 'X.' The certainty that he knew who 'X' was worried
  this decent bank clerk, and he called Oberzohn, probably to ask him why he
  had not made a statement. On the day he telephoned the snake man, that day he
  died."</p>

  <p>The detective was listening in silent wonder. "It sounds like a page out
  of a sensational novel," he said, "yet it hangs together."</p>

  <p>"It hangs together because it is true." Poiccart's deep voice broke into
  the conversation. "This has been Oberzohn's method all his life. He is strong
  for logic, and there is no more logical action in the world than the
  destruction of those who threaten your safety and life."</p>

  <p>Meadows pushed away his plate, his breakfast half eaten. "Proof," he said
  briefly.</p>

  <p>"What proof can you have, my dear fellow?" scoffed Leon.</p>

  <p>"The proof is the snake," persisted Meadows. "Show me how he could educate
  a deadly snake to strike, as he did, when the victim was under close
  observation, as in the case of Barberton, and I will believe you."</p>

  <p>The Three looked at one another and smiled together. "One of these days I
  will show you," said Leon. "They have certainly tamed their snake! He can
  move so quickly that the human eye cannot follow him. Always he bites on the
  most vital part, and at the most favourable time. He struck at me last night,
  but missed me. The next time he strikes"&mdash;he was speaking slowly and
  looking at the detective through the veriest slits of his half-closed
  eyelids&mdash;"the next time he strikes, not all Scotland Yard on the one
  side, nor his agreeable company of gunmen on the other, will save him!"</p>

  <p>Poiccart rose suddenly. His keen ears had heard the ring of a bell, and he
  went noiselessly down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"The whole thing sounds like a romance to me." Meadows was rubbing his
  chin irritably. "I am staring at the covers of a book whilst you are reading
  the pages. I suppose you devils; have the A and Z of the story?" Leon nodded.
  "Why don't you tell me?"</p>

  <p>"Because I value your life," said Leon simply. "Because I wish&mdash;we
  all wish&mdash;to keep the snake's attention upon ourselves."</p>

  <p>Poiccart came back at that moment and put his head in the door.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to see Mr. Elijah Washington?" he asked, and they saw by
  the gleam in his eyes that Mr. Elijah Washington was well worth meeting.</p>

  <p>He arrived a second or two later, a tall, broad-shouldered man with a
  reddish face. He wore pince-nez, and behind the rimless glasses his eyes were
  alive and full of bubbling laughter. From head to foot he was dressed in
  white; the cravat which flowed over the soft silk shirt was a bright yellow;
  the belt about his waist as bright as scarlet.</p>

  <p>He stood beaming upon the company, his white panama crushed under his arm,
  both huge hands thrust into his trousers pockets.</p>

  <p>"Glad to know you folks," he greeted them in a deep boom of a voice. "I
  guess Mr. Barberton told you all about me. That poor little guy! Listen: he
  was a he-man all right, but kinder mysterious. They told me I'd find the
  police chief here&mdash;Captain Meadows?"</p>

  <p>"Mister," said the inspector, "I'm that man."</p>

  <p>Washington put out his huge paw and caught the detective's hand with a
  grip that would have been notable in a boa constrictor.</p>

  <p>"Glad to know you! My name is Elijah Washington&mdash;the Natural History
  Syndicate, Chicago."</p>

  <p>"Sit down Mr. Washington." Poiccart pushed forward a chair.</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you gentleman that this Barberton was murdered. Snake?
  Listen, I know snakes&mdash;brought up with 'um! Snakes are my hobby: I know
  'um from egg-eaters to 'tigers'&mdash;notechis sentatus, moccasins,
  copperheads, corals mamba, fer de lance&mdash;gosh! snakes are just common
  objects like flies. An' I tell you boys right here and now, that there ain't
  a snake in this or the next world that can climb up a parapet, bite a man and
  get away with it with a copper looking on."</p>

  <p>He beamed from one to the other: he was almost paternal.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have shown you folks a worse-than-mamba," he said
  regretfully, "but carrying round snakes in your pocket is just hot dog: it's
  like a millionaire wearin' diamond ear-rings just to show he can afford 'em.
  I liked that little fellow; I'm mighty sorry he's dead, but if any man tells
  you that a snake bit him, go right up to him, hit him on the nose, and say
  'Liar!'"</p>

  <p>"You will have some coffee?" Manfred had rung the bell.</p>

  <p>"Sure I will: never have got used to this tea-drinking habit. I'm on the
  wagon too: got scared up there in the back-lands of Angola&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What were you doing there?" asked Leon.</p>

  <p>"Snakes," said the other briefly. "I represent an organization that
  supplies specimens to zoos and museums. I was looking for a flying
  snake&mdash;there ain't such a thing, though the natives say there is. I got
  a new kinder cobra&mdash;viperidae crotalinae&mdash;and yet not!"</p>

  <p>He scratched his head, bringing his scientific perplexity into the room.
  Leon's heart went out to him.</p>

  <p>He had met Barberton by accident. Without shame he confessed that he had
  gone to a village in the interior for a real solitary jag, and returning to
  such degree of civilization as Mossamedes represented, he found a group of
  Portuguese breeds squatting about a fire at which the man's feet were
  toasting.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what he was&mdash;a prospector, I guess. He was one of those
  what-is-its you meet along that coast. I've met his kind most
  everywhere&mdash;as far south as Port Nottosh. In Angola there are scores:
  they go native at the end."</p>

  <p>"You can tell us nothing about Barberton?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Elijah Washington shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir: I know him same as I might know you. It got me curious when I
  found out the why of the torturing: he wouldn't tell where it was."</p>

  <p>"Where what was?" asked Manfred quickly, and Washington was surprised.</p>

  <p>"Why, the writing they wanted to get. I thought maybe he'd told you. He
  said he was coming right along to spill all that part of it. It was a letter
  he'd found in a tin box&mdash;that was all he'd say."</p>

  <p>They looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"I know no more about it than that," Mr. Washington added, when he saw
  Gonsalez' lips move. "It was just a letter. Who it was from, why, what it was
  about, he never told me. My first idea was that he'd been flirting round
  about here, but divorce laws are mighty generous and they wouldn't trouble to
  get evidence that way. A man doesn't want any documents to get rid of his
  wife. I dare say you folks wonder why I've come along." Mr. Washington raised
  his steaming cup of coffee, which must have been nearly boiling, and drank it
  at one gulp. "That's fine," he said, "the nearest to coffee I've had since I
  left home."</p>

  <p>He wiped his lips with a large and vivid silk handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"I've come along, gentleman, because I've got a pretty good idea that I'd
  be useful to anybody who's snake-hunting in this little dorp."</p>

  <p>"It's rather a dangerous occupation, isn't it?" said Manfred quietly.</p>

  <p>Washington nodded.</p>

  <p>"To you, but not to me," he said. "I am snake-proof."</p>

  <p>He pulled up his sleeve: the forearm was scarred and pitted with old
  wounds.</p>

  <p>"Snakes," he said briefly. "That's cobra." He pointed proudly. "When that
  snake struck, my boys didn't wait for anything, they started dividing my kit.
  Sort of appointed themselves a board of executors and joint heirs of the
  family estate."</p>

  <p>"But you were very ill?" said Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>Mr. Washington shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, not more than if a bee bit me, and not so much as if a wasp had
  got in first punch. Some people can eat arsenic, some people can make a meal
  of enough morphia to decimate a province. I'm snake-proof&mdash;been bitten
  ever since I was five."</p>

  <p>He bent over towards them, and his jolly face went suddenly serious. "I'm
  the man you want," he said.</p>

  <p>"I think you are," said Manfred slowly.</p>

  <p>"Because this old snake ain't finished biting. There's a graft in it
  somewhere, and I want to find it. But first I want to vindicate the snake.
  Anybody who says a snake's naturally vicious doesn't understand. Snakes are
  timid, quiet, respectful things, and don't want no trouble with nobody. If a
  snake sees you coming, he naturally lights out for home. When momma snake's
  running around with her family, she's naturally touchy for fear you'd tread
  on any of her boys and girls, but she's a lady, and if you give her time
  she'll Maggie 'um and get 'um into the parlour where the foot of white man
  never trod."</p>

  <p>Leon was looking at him with a speculative eye.</p>

  <p>"It is queer to think," he said, speaking half to himself, "that you may
  be the only one of us who will be alive this day week!"</p>

  <p>Meadows, not easily shocked, felt a cold shiver run down his spine.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">XIII.&mdash;MIRABELLE GOES HOME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE prediction that Leon Gonsalez had made was not wholly
  fulfilled, though he himself had helped to prevent the supreme distress he
  prophesied. When Mirabelle Leicester awoke in the morning, her head was thick
  and dull, and for a long time she lay between sleeping and waking, trying to
  bring order to the confusion of her thoughts, her eyes on the ceiling towards
  a gnarled oak beam which she had seen before somewhere; and when at last she
  summoned sufficient energy to raise herself on her elbow, she looked upon the
  very familiar surroundings of her own pretty little room.</p>

  <p>Heavytree Farm! What a curious dream she had had! A dream filled with
  fleeting visions of old men with elongated heads, of dance music and a
  crowded ball-room, of a slightly over-dressed man who had been very polite to
  her at dinner. Where did she dine? She sat up in bed, holding her throbbing
  head.</p>

  <p>Again she looked round the room and slowly, out of her dreams, emerged a
  few tangible facts. She was still in a state of bewilderment when the door
  opened and Aunt Alma came in, and the unprepossessing face of her relative
  was accentuated by her look of anxiety.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Alma!" said Mirabelle dully. "I've had such a queer dream."</p>

  <p>Alma pressed her lips tightly together as she placed a tray on a table by
  the side of the bed.</p>

  <p>"I think it was about that advertisement I saw." And then, with a gasp:
  "How did I come here?"</p>

  <p>"They brought you," said Alma. "The nurse is downstairs having her
  breakfast. She's a nice woman and keeps press-cuttings."</p>

  <p>"The nurse?" asked Mirabelle in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"You arrived here at three o'clock in the morning in a motor-car. You had
  a nurse with you." Alma enumerated the circumstances in chronological order.
  "And two men. First one of the men got out and knocked at the door. I was
  worried to death. In fact, I'd been worried all the afternoon, ever since I
  had your wire telling me not to come up to London."</p>

  <p>"But I didn't send any such wire," replied the girl.</p>

  <p>"After I came down, the man&mdash;he was really a gentleman and very
  pleasantly spoken&mdash;told me that you'd been taken ill and a nurse had
  brought you home. They then carried you, the two men and the nurse, upstairs
  and laid you on the bed, and nurse and I undressed you. I simply couldn't get
  you to wake up: all you did was to talk about the orangeade."</p>

  <p>"I remember! It was so bitter, and Lord Evington let me drink some of his.
  And then I... I don't know what happened after that," she said, with a little
  grimace.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gonsalez ordered the car, got the nurse from a nursing home,"
  explained Alma.</p>

  <p>"Gonsalez! Not my Gonsalez&mdash;the&mdash;the Four Just Men Gonsalez?"
  she asked in amazement.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it was Gonsalez: they made no secret about it. You can see the
  gentleman who brought you: he's about the house somewhere. I saw him in
  Heavytree Lane not five minutes ago, strolling up and down and smoking. A
  pipe.", added Alma.</p>

  <p>The girl got out of bed; her knees were curiously weak under her, but she
  managed to stagger to the window, and, pushing open the casement still
  farther, looked out across the patchwork quilt of colour. The summer flowers
  were in bloom; the delicate scents came up on the warm morning air, and she
  stood for a moment, drinking in great draughts of the exquisite perfume, and
  then, with a sigh, turned back to the waiting Alma.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how it all happened and what it's about, but my word, Alma,
  I'm glad to be back! That dreadful man... ! We lunched at the Ritz-Carlton...
  I never want to see another restaurant or a ball-room or Chester Square, or
  anything but old Heavytree!"</p>

  <p>She took the cup of tea from Alma's hand, drank greedily, and put it down
  with a little gasp.</p>

  <p>"That was wonderful! Yes, the tea was too, but I'm thinking about
  Gonsalez. If it should be he!"</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you should get excited over a man who's committed I don't
  know how many murders."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Alma!" scoffed the girl. "The Just Men have never
  murdered, any more than a judge and jury murder."</p>

  <p>The room was still inclined to go round, and it was with the greatest
  difficulty that she could condense the two Almas who stood before her into
  one tangible individual.</p>

  <p>"There's a gentleman downstairs: he's been waiting since twelve."</p>

  <p>And when she asked, she was to learn, to her dismay, that at was half-past
  one.</p>

  <p>"I'll be down in a quarter of an hour," she said recklessly. "Who is
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I've never heard of him before, but he's a gentleman," was the
  unsatisfactory reply. "They didn't want to let him come in."</p>

  <p>"Who didn't?"</p>

  <p>"The gentlemen who brought you here in the night."</p>

  <p>Mirabelle stared at her.</p>

  <p>"You mean... they're guarding the house?"</p>

  <p>"That's how it strikes me," said Alma bitterly. "Why they should interfere
  with us, I don't know. Anyway, they let him in. Mr. Johnson Lee."</p>

  <p>The girl frowned.</p>

  <p>"I don't know the name," she said.</p>

  <p>Alma walked to the window.</p>

  <p>"There's his car," she said, and pointed.</p>

  <p>It was just visible, standing at the side of the road beyond the box
  hedge, a long-bodied Rolls, white with dust. The chauffeur was talking to a
  strange man, and from the fact that he was smoking a pipe Mirabelle guessed
  that this was one of her self-appointed custodians.</p>

  <p>She had her bath, and with the assistance of the nurse, dressed and came
  shakily down the stairs. Alma was waiting in the brick-floored hall.</p>

  <p>"He wants to see you alone," she said in a stage whisper. "I don't know
  whether I ought to allow it, but there's evidently something wrong. These men
  prowling about the house have got thoroughly on my nerves."</p>

  <p>Mirabelle laughed softly as she opened the door and walked in. At the
  sound of the door closing, the man who was sitting stiffly on a deep settee
  in a window recess got up. He was tall and bent, and his dark face was lined.
  His eyes she could not see; they were hidden behind dark green glasses, which
  were turned in her direction as she came across the room to greet him.</p>

  <p>"Miss Mirabelle Leicester?" he asked, in the quiet, modulated voice of an
  educated man. He took her hand in his.</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down?" she said, for he remained standing after she had
  seated herself.</p>

  <p>"Thank you." He sat down gingerly, holding between his knees the handle of
  the umbrella he had brought into the drawing-room. "I'm afraid my visit may
  be inopportune, Miss Leicester," he said. "Have you by any chance heard about
  Mr. Barberton?"</p>

  <p>Her brows wrinkled in thought. "Barberton? I seem to have heard the
  name."</p>

  <p>"He was killed yesterday on the Thames Embankment."</p>

  <p>Then she recollected. "The man who was bitten by the snake?" she asked in
  horror.</p>

  <p>The visitor nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was a great shock to me, because I have been a friend of his for many
  years, and had arranged to call at his hotel on the night of his death." And
  then abruptly he turned the conversation in another and a surprising
  direction. "Your father was a scientist, Miss Leicester?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he was an astronomer, an authority upon meteors."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. I thought that was the gentleman. I have only recently had his
  book read to me. He was in Africa for some years?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said quietly, "he died there. He was studying meteors for three
  years in Angola. You probably know that a very large number of shooting stars
  fall in that country. My father's theory was that it was due to the ironstone
  mountains which attract them&mdash;so he set up a little observatory in the
  interior." Her lips trembled for a second. "He was killed in a native
  rising," she said.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the part of Angola where be had his observatory?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure. I have never been in Africa, but perhaps Aunt Alma may
  know."</p>

  <p>She went out to find Alma waiting in the passage, in conversation with the
  pipe-smoker. The man withdrew hastily at the sight of her.</p>

  <p>"Alma, do you remember what part of Angola father had his observatory?"
  she asked.</p>

  <p>Alma did not know off-hand, but one of her invaluable scrap-books
  contained all the information that the girl wanted, and she carried the book
  to Mr. Lee.</p>

  <p>"Here are the particulars," she said, and laid the book open before
  them.</p>

  <p>"Would you read it for me?" he requested gently, and she read to him the
  three short paragraphs which noted that Professor Leicester had taken up his
  residence in Bishaka.</p>

  <p>"That is the place," interrupted the visitor. "Bishaka! You are you sure
  that Mr. Barberton did not communicate with you?"</p>

  <p>"With me?" she said in amazement "No&mdash;why should he?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer, but sat for a long time, turning the matter over in his
  mind.</p>

  <p>"You're perfectly certain that nobody sent you a document, probably in the
  Portuguese language, concerning"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"Bishaka?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, and then, as though he had not seen the gesture, he
  asked the question again.</p>

  <p>"I'm certain," she said. "We have very little correspondence at the farm,
  and it isn't possible that I could overlook anything so remarkable."</p>

  <p>Again he turned the problem over in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Have you any documents in Portuguese or in English... any letters from
  your father about Angola?"</p>

  <p>"None," she said. "The only reference my father ever made to Bishaka was
  that he was getting a lot of information which he thought would be valuable,
  and that he was a little troubled because his cameras, which he had fixed in
  various parts of the country to cover every sector of the skies, were being
  disturbed by wandering prospectors."</p>

  <p>"He said that, did he?" asked Mr. Lee eagerly. "Come now, that explains a
  great deal!"</p>

  <p>In spite of herself she laughed. "It doesn't explain much to me, Mr. Lee,"
  she said frankly. And then, in a more serious tone: "Did Barberton come from
  Angola?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Barberton came from that country," he said in a lower voice. "I
  should like to tell you,"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"but I am rather
  afraid."</p>

  <p>"Afraid to tell me? Why?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"So many dreadful things have happened recently to poor Barberton and
  others, that knowledge seems a most dangerous thing. I wish I could believe
  that it would not be dangerous to you," he added kindly, "and then I could
  speak what is in my mind and relieve myself of a great deal of anxiety." He
  rose slowly. "I think the best thing I can do is to consult my lawyer. I was
  foolish to keep it from him so long. He is the only man I can trust to search
  my documents."</p>

  <p>She could only look at him in astonishment</p>

  <p>"But surely you can search your own documents?" she said good
  humouredly.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm afraid I can't. Because"&mdash;he spoke with the simplicity of a
  child&mdash;"I am blind."</p>

  <p>"Blind?" gasped Mirabelle, and the man laughed gently.</p>

  <p>"I am pretty capable for a blind man, am I not? I can walk across a room
  and avoid all the furniture. The only thing I cannot do is to read&mdash;at
  least, read the ordinary print. I can read Braille: poor Barberton taught me.
  He was a school-master," he explained, "at a blind school near Brightlingsea.
  Not a particularly well-educated man, but a marvellously quick writer of
  Braille. We have corresponded for years through that medium. He could write a
  Braille letter almost as quickly as you can with pen and ink."</p>

  <p>Her heart was full of pity for the man: he was so cheery, so confident,
  and withal so proud of his own accomplishments, that pity turned to
  admiration. He had the ineffable air of obstinacy which is the possession of
  so many men similarly stricken, and she began to realize that self-pity, that
  greatest of all afflictions which attends blindness, had been eliminated from
  his philosophy.</p>

  <p>"I should like to tell you more," he said, as he held out his hand.
  "Probably I will dictate a long letter to you to-morrow, or else my lawyer
  will do so, putting all the facts before you. For the moment, however, I must
  be sure of my ground. I have no desire to raise in your heart either fear
  or&mdash;hope. Do you know a Mr. Manfred?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know him personally," she said quickly. "George Manfred?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Have you met him?" she asked eagerly. "And Mr. Poiccart, the
  Frenchman?"</p>

  <p>"No, not Mr. Poiccart. Manfred was on the telephone to me very early this
  morning. He seemed to know all about my relationships with my poor friend. He
  knew also of my blindness. A remarkable man, very gentle and courteous. It
  was he who gave me your address. Perhaps," he roused, "it would be advisable
  if I first consulted him."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it would!" she said enthusiastically. "They are wonderful. You
  have heard of them, of course, Mr. Lee&mdash;the Four Just Men?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"That sounds as though you admire them," he said. "Yes, I have heard of
  them. They are the men who, many years ago, set out to regularize the
  inconsistencies of the English law, to punish where no punishment is provided
  by the code. Strange I never associated them... "</p>

  <p>He meditated upon the matter in silence for a long while, and then: "I
  wonder," he said, but did not tell her what he was wondering.</p>

  <p>She walked down the garden path with him into the road-way and stood
  chatting about the country and the flowers that he had never seen, and the
  weather and such trivialities as people talk about when their minds are
  occupied with more serious thoughts which they cannot share, until the big
  limousine pulled up and he stepped into its cool interior. He had the
  independence which comes to the educated blind and gently refused the offer
  of her guidance, an offer she did not attempt to repeat, sensing the
  satisfaction he must have had in making his way without help. She waved her
  hand to the car as it moved off, and so naturally did his hand go up in
  salute that for a moment she thought he had seen her.</p>

  <p>So he passed cut of her sight, and might well have passed out of her life,
  for Mr. Oberzohn had decreed that the remaining hours of blind Johnson Lee
  were to be few.</p>

  <p>But it happened that the Three Men had reached the same decision in regard
  to Mr. Oberzohn, only there was some indecision as to the manner of his
  passing. Leon Gonsalez had original views.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">XIV.&mdash;THE PEDLAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE man with the pipe was standing within half a dozen paces
  of her. She was going back through the gate, when she remembered Aunt Alma's
  views on the guardianship.</p>

  <p>"Are you waiting here all day?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Till this evening, miss. We're to be relieved by some men from
  Gloucester&mdash;we came from town, and we're going back with the nurse, if
  you can do without her?"</p>

  <p>"Who placed you here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gonsalez. He thought it would be wise to have somebody around."</p>

  <p>"But why?"</p>

  <p>The big man grinned.</p>

  <p>"I've known Mr. Gonsalez many years," he said. "I'm a police pensioner,
  and I can remember the time when I'd have given a lot of money to lay my
  hands on him&mdash;but I've never asked him why, miss. There is generally a
  good reason for everything he does."</p>

  <p>Mirabelle went back into the farmhouse, very thoughtful. Happily, Alma was
  not inquisitive; she was left alone in the drawing-room to reconstruct her
  exciting yesterday.</p>

  <p>Mirabelle harboured very few illusions. She had read much, guessed much,
  and in the days of her childhood had been in the habit of linking cause to
  effect. The advertisement was designed especially for her: that was her first
  conclusion. It was designed to bring her into the charge of Oberzohn. For now
  she recognized this significant circumstance: never once, since she had
  entered the offices of Oberzohn &amp; Smitts, until the episode of the
  orangeade, had she been free to come and go as she wished. He had taken her
  to lunch, he had brought her back; Joan Newton had been her companion in the
  drive from the house, and from the house to the hall; and from then on she
  did not doubt that Oberzohn's surveillance had continued, until...</p>

  <p>Dimly she remembered the man in the cloak who had stood in the rocking
  doorway. Was that Gonsalez? Somehow she thought it must have been. Gonsalez,
  watchful, alert&mdash;why? She had been in danger&mdash;was still in danger.
  Though why anybody should have picked unimportant her was the greatest of all
  mysteries.</p>

  <p>In some inexplicable way the death of Barberton had been associated with
  that advertisement and the attention she had received from Dr. Oberzohn and
  his creatures. Who was Lord Evington? She remembered his German accent and
  his "gracious lady," the curious click of his heels and his stiff bow. That
  was a clumsy subterfuge which she ought to have seen through from the first.
  He was another of her watchers. And the drugged orangeade was his work. She
  shuddered. Suppose Leon Gonsalez, or whoever it was, had not arrived so
  providentially, where would she be at this moment?</p>

  <p>Walking to the window, she looked out, and the sight of the two men just
  inside the gate gave her a sense of infinite relief and calm; and the
  knowledge that she, for some reason, was under the care and protection of
  this strange organization about which she had read, thrilled her.</p>

  <p>She walked into the vaulted kitchen, to find the kitchen table covered
  with fat volumes, and Aunt Alma explaining to the interested nurse her system
  of filing. Two subjects interested that hard-featured lady: crime and family
  records. She had two books filled with snippings from country newspapers
  relating to the family of a distant cousin who had been raised to a peerage
  during the war. She had another devoted to the social triumphs of a distant
  woman, Goddard, who had finally made a sensational appearance as petitioner
  in the most celebrated divorce suit of the age. But crime, generally
  speaking, was Aunt Alma's chief preoccupation. It was from these voluminous
  cuttings that Mirabelle had gained her complete knowledge of the Four Just
  Men and their operations. There were books packed with the story of the Ramon
  murder, arranged with loving care in order of time, for chronology was almost
  a vice in Alma Goddard. Only one public sensation was missing from her
  collection, and she was explaining the reason to the nurse as Mirabelle came
  into the kitchen.</p>

  <p>"No, my dear," she was saying, "there is nothing about The Snake. I won't
  have anything to do with that: it gives me the creeps. In fact, I haven't
  read anything that has the slightest reference to it."</p>

  <p>"I've got every line," said the nurse enthusiastically. "My brother is a
  reporter on the <i>Megaphone</i>, and he says this is the best story they've
  had for years&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mirabelle interrupted this somewhat gruesome conversation to make
  inquiries about luncheon. Her head was steady now and she had developed an
  appetite.</p>

  <p>The front door stood open, and as she turned to go into the dining-room to
  get her writing materials, she heard an altercation at the gate. A third man
  had appeared: a grimy-looking pedlar who carried a tray before him, packed
  with all manner of cheap buttons and laces. He was a middle-aged man with a
  ragged beard, and despite the warmth of the day, was wearing a long overcoat
  that almost reached to his heels.</p>

  <p>"You may or you may not be," the man with the pipe was saying, "but you're
  not going in here."</p>

  <p>"I've served this house for years," snarled the pedlar. "What do you mean
  by interfering with me? You're not a policeman."</p>

  <p>"Whether I'm a policeman or a dustman or a postman," said the patient
  guard, "you don't pass through this gate&mdash;do you understand that?"</p>

  <p>At this moment the pedlar caught sight of the girl at the door and raised
  his battered hat with a grin. He was unknown to the girl; she did not
  remember having seen him at the house before. Nor did Alma, who came out at
  that moment.</p>

  <p>"He's a stranger here, but we're always getting new people up from
  Gloucester," she said. "What does he want to sell?"</p>

  <p>She stalked out into the garden, and at the sight of her the grin left the
  pedlar's face.</p>

  <p>"I've got some things I'd like to sell to the young lady, ma'am," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so old, and I'm a lady," replied Alma sharply. "And how long is
  it since you started picking and choosing your customers?"</p>

  <p>The man grumbled something under his breath, and without waiting even to
  display his wares, shuffled off along the dusty road, and they watched him
  until he was out of sight.</p>

  <p>Heavytree Farm was rather grandly named for so small a property. The
  little estate followed the road to Heavytree Lane, which formed the southern
  boundary of the property. The lane itself ran at an angle to behind the
  house, where the third boundary was formed by a hedge dividing the farmland
  from the more pretentious estate of a local magnate. It was down the lane the
  pedlar turned.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, ma'am," said the companion of the man with the pipe.</p>

  <p>He opened the gate, walked in, and, making a circuit of the house, reached
  the orchard behind. Here a few outhouses were scattered, and, clearing these,
  he came to the meadow, where Mirabelle's one cow ruminated in the lazy manner
  of her kind. Half hidden by a thick-boled apple-tree, the watcher waited, and
  presently, as he expected, he saw a head appear through the boundary hedge.
  After an observation the pedlar sprang into the meadow and stood, taking
  stock of his ground. He had left his tray and his bag, and, running with
  surprising swiftness for a man of his age, he gained a little wooden barn,
  and, pulling open the door, disappeared into its interior. By this time the
  guard had been joined by his companion and they had a short consultation, the
  man with the pipe going back to his post before the house, whilst the other
  walked slowly across the meadow until he came to the closed door of the
  barn.</p>

  <p>Wise in his generation, he first made a circuit of the building, and
  discovered there were no exits through the blackened gates. Then, pulling
  both doors open wide:</p>

  <p>"Come out, bo'!" he said.</p>

  <p>The barn was empty, except for a heap of hay that lay in one corner and
  some old and wheel-less farm-wagons propped up on three trestles awaiting the
  wheelwright's attention.</p>

  <p>A ladder led to a loft, and the guard climbed slowly. His head was on a
  level with the dark opening, when: "Put up your hands!"</p>

  <p>He was looking into the adequate muzzle of an automatic pistol.</p>

  <p>"Come down, bo'!"</p>

  <p>"Put up your hands," hissed the voice in the darkness, "or you're a dead
  man!"</p>

  <p>The watcher obeyed, cursing his folly that he had come alone.</p>

  <p>"Now climb up."</p>

  <p>With some difficulty the guard brought himself up to the floor level.</p>

  <p>"Step this way, and step lively," said the pedlar. "Hold your hands
  out."</p>

  <p>He felt the touch of cold steel on his wrist, heard a click.</p>

  <p>"Now the other hand."</p>

  <p>The moment he was manacled, the pedlar began a rapid search.</p>

  <p>"Carry a gun, do you?" he sneered, as he drew a pistol from the man's hip
  pocket. "Now sit down."</p>

  <p>In a few seconds the discomfited guard was bound and gagged. The pedlar,
  crawling to the entrance of the loft, looked out between a crevice in the
  boards. He was watching, not the house, but the hedge through which he had
  climbed. Two other men had appeared there, and he grunted his satisfaction.
  Descending into the barn, he pulled away the ladder and let it fall on the
  floor, before he came out into the open and made a signal.</p>

  <p>The second guard had made his way back by the short cut to the front of
  the house, passing through the garden and in through the kitchen door. He
  stopped to shoot the bolt, and the girl, coming into the kitchen, saw
  him.</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, miss." He was looking at the kitchen windows: they were
  heavily barred. "My mate has just seen that pedlar go into the barn."</p>

  <p>She followed him to the front door. He had turned to go, but, changing his
  mind, came back, and she saw him put his hand into his hip pocket and was
  staggered to see him produce a long-barrelled Browning.</p>

  <p>"Can you use a pistol, miss?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, too surprised to speak, and watched him as he jerked back the
  jacket and put up the safety catch.</p>

  <p>"I want to be on the safe side, and I'd feel happier if you were
  armed."</p>

  <p>There was a gun hanging on the wall and he took it down.</p>

  <p>"Have you any shells for this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She pulled open the drawer of the hall-stand and took out a cardboard
  carton.</p>

  <p>"They may be useful," he said.</p>

  <p>"But surely, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Digby." He supplied his name.</p>

  <p>"Surely you're exaggerating? I don't mean that you're doing it with any
  intention of frightening me, but there isn't any danger to us?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I've got a queer feeling&mdash;had it all morning. How far
  is the nearest house from here?"</p>

  <p>"Not half a mile away," she said.</p>

  <p>"You're on the phone?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm scared, maybe. I'll just go out into the road and have a look round.
  I wish that fellow would come back," he added fretfully.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly up the garden path and stood for a moment leaning over
  the gate. As he did so, he heard the rattle and asthmatic wheezing of an
  ancient car, and saw a tradesman's trolley come round a corner of Heavytree
  Lane. Its pace grew slower as it got nearer to the house, and opposite the
  gate it stopped altogether. The driver, getting down with a curse, lifted up
  the battered tin bonnet, and, groping under the seat, brought out a long
  spanner. Then, swift as thought, he half turned and struck at Digby's head.
  The girl heard the sickening impact, saw the watcher drop limply to the path,
  and in another second she had slammed the door and thrust home the bolts.</p>

  <p>She was calm; the hand that took the revolver from the hall-table did not
  tremble.</p>

  <p>"Alma!" she called, and Alma came running downstairs.</p>

  <p>"What on earth&mdash;?" she began, and then saw the pistol in Mirabelle's
  hands.</p>

  <p>"They are attacking the house," said the girl quickly. "I don't know who
  'they' are, but they've just struck down one of the men who was protecting
  us. Take the gun, Alma."</p>

  <p>Alma's face was contorted, and might have expressed fear or anger or both.
  Mirabelle afterwards learnt that the dominant emotion was one of satisfaction
  to find herself in so war-like an environment.</p>

  <p>Running into the drawing-room, the girl pushed open the window, which
  commanded a view of the road. The gate was unfastened and two men, who had
  evidently been concealed inside the trolley, were lifting the unconscious
  man, and she watched, with a calm she could not understand in herself, as
  they threw him into the interior and fastened the tailboard. She counted four
  in all, including the driver, who was climbing back to his seat. One of the
  newcomers, evidently the leader, was pointing down the road towards the lane,
  and she guessed that he was giving directions as to where the car should
  wait, for it began to go backwards almost immediately and with surprising
  smoothness, remembering the exhibition it had given of decrepitude a few
  minutes before.</p>

  <p>The man who had given instructions came striding down the path towards the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>He looked round with a start into the levelled muzzle of a Browning, and
  his surprise would, in any other circumstances, have been comical.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, miss&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Put yourself outside that gate," said Mirabelle coolly.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to see you... very important&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bang!</p>

  <p>Mirabelle fired a shot, aimed above his head, towards the old poplar. The
  man ducked and ran. Clear of the gate he dropped to the cover of a hedge,
  where his men already were, and she heard the murmur of their voices
  distinctly, for the day was still, and the far-off chugging of the trolley's
  engine sounded close at hand. Presently she saw a head peep round the
  hedge.</p>

  <p>"Can I have five minutes' talk with you?" asked the leader loudly.</p>

  <p>He was a thick-set, bronzed man, with a patch of lint plastered to his
  face, and she noted unconsciously that he wore gold ear-rings.</p>

  <p>"There's no trouble coming to you," he said, opening the gate as he spoke.
  "You oughtn't to have fired, anyway. No-body's going to hurt you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He had advanced a yard into the garden as he spoke.</p>

  <p>Bang, bang!</p>

  <p>In her haste she had pressed butt and trigger just a fraction too long,
  and, startled by the knowledge that another shot was coming, her hand jerked
  round, and the second shot missed his head by the fraction of an inch. He
  disappeared in a flash, and a second later she saw their hats moving swiftly
  above the box. They were running towards the waiting car.</p>

  <p>"Stay here, Alma!"</p>

  <p>Alma Goddard nodded grimly, and the girl flew up the stairs to her room.
  From this elevation she commanded a better view. She saw them climb into the
  van, and in another second the limp body of the guard was thrown out into the
  hedge; then, after a brief space of time, the machine began moving and,
  gathering speed, disappeared in a cloud of dust on the Highcombe Road.</p>

  <p>Mirabelle came down the stairs at a run, pulled back the bolts and flew
  out and along the road towards the still figure of the detective. He was
  lying by the side of the ditch, his head a mass of blood, and she saw that he
  was still breathing. She tried to lift him, but it was too great a task. She
  ran back to the house. The telephone was in the hall: an old-fashioned
  instrument with a handle that had to be turned, and she had not made two
  revolutions before she realized that the wire had been cut.</p>

  <p>Alma was still in the parlour, the gun gripped tight in her hand, a look
  of fiendish resolution on her face.</p>

  <p>"You must help me to get Digby into the house," she said. "Where is
  he?"</p>

  <p>Mirabelle pointed, and the two women, returning to the man, half lifted,
  half dragged him back to the hall. Laying him down on the brick floor, the
  girl went in search of clean linen. The kitchen, which was also the drying
  place for Alma's more intimate laundry, supplied all that she needed. Whilst
  Alma watched unmoved the destruction of her wardrobe, the girl bathed the
  wound and the frightened nurse (who had disappeared at the first shot)
  applied a rough dressing. The wound was an ugly one, and the man showed no
  signs of recovering consciousness.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to send Mary into Gloucester for an ambulance," said
  Mirabelle. "We can't send nurse&mdash;she doesn't know the way."</p>

  <p>"Mary," said Alma calmly, "is at this moment having hysterics in the
  larder. I'll harness the dog-cart and go myself. But where is the other
  man?"</p>

  <p>Mirabelle shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't like to think what has happened to him," she said. "Now, Alma, do
  you think we can get him into the drawing-room?"</p>

  <p>Together they lifted the heavy figure and staggered with it into the
  pretty little room, laying him at last upon the settee under the window.</p>

  <p>"He can rest there till we get the ambulance," began Mirabelle, and a
  chuckle behind her made her turn with a gasp.</p>

  <p>It was the pedlar, and in his hand he held the pistol which she had
  discarded.</p>

  <p>"I only want you"&mdash;he nodded to the girl. "You other two women can
  come out here." He jerked his head to the passage. Under the stairs was a big
  cupboard and he pulled the door open invitingly. "Get in here. If you make a
  noise, you'll be sorry for yourselves."</p>

  <p>Alma's eyes wandered longingly to the gun she had left in the corner, but
  before she could make a move he had placed himself between her and the
  weapon.</p>

  <p>"Inside," said the pedlar, and Mirabelle was not much surprised when Aunt
  Alma meekly obeyed.</p>

  <p>He shut the door on the two women and fastened the latch.</p>

  <p>"Now, young lady, put on your hat and be lively!"</p>

  <p>He followed her up the stairs into her room and watched her while she
  found a hat and a cloak. She knew only that it was a waste of time even to
  temporize with him. He, for his part, was so exultant at his success that he
  grew almost loquacious.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you saw the boys driving away and you didn't remember that I
  was somewhere around. Was that you doing the shooting?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer.</p>

  <p>"It couldn't have been Lew, or you'd have been dead," he said. He was
  examining the muzzle of the pistol. "It was you all right." He chuckled.
  "Ain't you the game one! Sister, you ought to be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped dead, staring through the window. He was paralysed with
  amazement at the sight of a bare-headed Aunt Alma flying along the Gloucester
  Road. With an oath he turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"How did she get out? Have you got anybody here? Now speak up."</p>

  <p>"The cupboard under the stairs leads to the wine cellar," said Mirabelle
  coolly, "and there are two ways out of the wine cellar I think Aunt Alma
  found one of them."</p>

  <p>With an oath, he took a step towards her, gripped her by the arm and
  jerked her towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Lively!" he said, and dragged her down the stairs through the hall, into
  the kitchen.</p>

  <p>He shot back the bolts, but the lock of the kitchen door had been
  turned.</p>

  <p>"This way." He swore cold-bloodedly, and, her arm still in his powerful
  grip, he hurried along the passage and pulled open the door.</p>

  <p>It was an unpropitious moment. A man was walking down the path, a half
  smile on his face, as though he was thinking over a remembered jest. At the
  sight of him the pedlar dropped the girl's arm and his hand went like
  lightning to his pocket.</p>

  <p>"When will you die?" said Leon Gonsalez softly. "Make a choice, and make
  it quick!"</p>

  <p>And the gun in his hand seemed to quiver with homicidal eagerness.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">XV.&mdash;TWO "ACCIDENTS"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE pedlar, his face twitching, put up his shaking
  hands.</p>

  <p>Leon walked to him, took the Browning from his moist grip and dropped it
  into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Your friends are waiting, of course?" he said pleasantly.</p>

  <p>The pedlar did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Cuccini too? I thought I had incapacitated him for a long time."</p>

  <p>"They've gone," growled the pedlar.</p>

  <p>Gonsalez looked round in perplexity.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to take you into the house. At the same time, I don't want
  to leave you here," he said. "I almost wish you'd drawn that gun of yours,"
  he added regretfully. "It would have solved so many immediate problems."</p>

  <p>This particular problem was solved by the return of the dishevelled Alma
  and the restoration to her of her gun.</p>

  <p>"I would so much rather you shot him than I," said Leon earnestly. "The
  police are very suspicious of my shootings, and they never wholly believe
  that they are done in self-defence."</p>

  <p>With a rope he tied the man, and tied him uncomfortably, wrists to ankles.
  That done, he made a few inquiries and went swiftly out to the barn,
  returning in a few minutes with the unhappy guard.</p>

  <p>"It can't be helped," said Leon, cutting short the man's apologies. "The
  question is, where are the rest of the brethren?"</p>

  <p>Something zipped past him: it had the intensified hum of an angry wasp,
  and a second later he heard a muffled "Plop!" In a second he was lying flat
  on the ground, his Browning covering the hedge that hid Heavytree Lane.</p>

  <p>"Run to the house," he called urgently. "They won't bother about you." And
  the guard, nothing loth, sprinted for the cover of walls.</p>

  <p>Presently Leon located the enemy, and at a little distance off he saw the
  flat top of the covered trolley. A man walked invitingly across the gap in
  the hedge, but Gonsalez held his fire, and presently the manoeuvre was
  repeated. Obviously they were trying to concentrate his mind upon the gap
  whilst they were moving elsewhere. His eyes swept the meadow
  boundary&mdash;running parallel, he guessed, was a brook or ditch which would
  make excellent cover.</p>

  <p>Again the man passed leisurely across the gap. Leon steadied his elbow,
  and glanced along the sight. As he did so, the man reappeared.</p>

  <p>Crack!</p>

  <p>Gonsalez aimed a foot behind him. The man saw the flash and jumped back,
  as he had expected. In another second he was writhing on the ground with a
  bullet through his leg.</p>

  <p>Leon showed his teeth in a smile and switched his body round to face the
  new point of attack. It came from the spot that he had expected: a little
  rise of ground that commanded his position.</p>

  <p>The first bullet struck the turf to his right with an angry buzz, sent a
  divot flying heavenward, and ricocheted with a smack against a tree. Before
  the raised head could drop to cover, Gonsalez fired; fired another shot to
  left and right, then, rising, raced for the shelter of the tree, and reached
  it in time to see three heads bobbing back to the road. He waited, covering
  the gap, but the people who drew the wounded man out of sight did not show
  themselves, and a minute later he saw the trolley moving swiftly down the
  by-road, and knew that danger was past.</p>

  <p>The firing had attracted attention. He had not been back in the house a
  few minutes before a mounted policeman, his horse in a lather, came galloping
  up to the gate and dismounted. A neighbouring farm had heard the shots and
  telephoned to constabulary headquarters. For half an hour the mounted
  policeman took notes, and by this time half the farmers in the neighbourhood,
  their guns under their arms, had assembled in Mirabelle's parlour.</p>

  <p>She had not seen as much of the redoubtable Leon as she could have wished,
  and when they had a few moments to themselves she seized the opportunity to
  tell him of the call which Lee had made that morning. Apparently he knew all
  about it, for he expressed no surprise, and was only embarrassed when she
  showed a personal interest in himself and his friends.</p>

  <p>It was not a very usual experience for him, and he was rather annoyed with
  himself at this unexpected glimpse of enthusiasm and hero-worship, sane as it
  was, and based, as he realized, upon her keen sense of justice.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure that we've been very admirable really," he said. "But the
  difficulty is to produce at the moment a judgement which would be given from
  a distance of years. We have sacrificed everything which to most men would
  make life worth living, in our desire to see the scales held fairly."</p>

  <p>"You are not married, Mr. Gonsalez?"</p>

  <p>He stared into the frank eyes. "Married! Why, no," he said, and she
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"You talk as though that were a possibility that had never occurred to
  you."</p>

  <p>"It hasn't," he admitted. "By the very nature of our work we are debarred
  from that experience. And is it an offensive thing to say that I have never
  felt my singleness to be a deprivation?"</p>

  <p>"It is very rude," she said severely, and Leon was laughing to himself all
  the way back to town as at a great joke that improved upon repetition.</p>

  <p>"I think we can safely leave her for a week," he reported, on his return
  to Curzon Street. "No, nothing happened. I was held up in a police trap near
  Newbury for exceeding the speed limit. They said I was doing fifty, but I
  should imagine it was nearer eighty. Meadows will get me out of that.
  Otherwise, I must send the inevitable letter to the magistrate and pay the
  inevitable fine. Have you done anything about Johnson Lee?"</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded. "Meadows and the enthusiastic Mr. Washington have gone
  round to see him. I have asked Washington to go because"&mdash;he
  hesitated&mdash;"the snake is a real danger, so far as he is concerned.
  Elijah Washington promises to be a very real help. He is afraid of nothing,
  and has undertaken to stay with Lee and to apply such remedies for
  snake-bites as he knows."</p>

  <p>He was putting on his gloves as he spoke, and Leon Gonsalez looked at him
  with a critical admiration.</p>

  <p>"Are you being presented at Court, or are you taking tea with a
  duchess?"</p>

  <p>"Neither. I'm calling upon friend Oberzohn."</p>

  <p>"The devil you are!" said Leon, his eyebrows rising.</p>

  <p>"I have taken the precaution of sending him a note, asking him to keep his
  snakes locked up," said Manfred, "and as I have pointedly forwarded the
  carbon copy of the letter, to impress the fact that another exists and may be
  brought in evidence against him, I think I shall leave Oberzohn &amp; Smitts'
  main office without hurt. If you are not too tired, Leon, I would rather
  prefer the Buick to the Spanz."</p>

  <p>"Give me a quarter of an hour," said Leon, and went up to his room to make
  himself tidy.</p>

  <p>It was fifteen minutes exactly when the Buick stopped at the door, and
  Manfred got into the saloon. There was no partition between driver and
  passenger, and conversation was possible.</p>

  <p>"It would have been as well if you'd had Brother Newton there," he
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Brother Newton will be on the spot: I took the precaution of sending him
  a similar note," said Manfred. "I shouldn't imagine they'll bring out their
  gunmen."</p>

  <p>"I know two, and possibly three, they won't bring out." Gonsalez grinned
  at the traffic policeman who waved him into Oxford Street. "That Browning of
  mine throws high, Manfred: I've always had a suspicion it did. Pistols are
  queer things, but this may wear into my hand." He talked arms and ammunition
  until the square block of Oberzohn &amp; Smitts came into sight. "Good
  hunting!" he said, as he got out, opened the saloon door and touched his hat
  to Manfred as he alighted.</p>

  <p>He got back into his seat, swung the little car round in a circle, and sat
  on the opposite side of the road, his eyes alternately on the entrance and on
  the mirror which gave him a view of the traffic approaching him from the
  rear.</p>

  <p>Manfred was not kept in the waiting-room for more than two minutes. At the
  end of that time, a solemn youth in spectacles, with a little bow, led him
  across the incurious office into the presence of the illustrious doctor.</p>

  <p>The old man was at his desk. Behind him, his debonair self, Monty Newton,
  a large yellow flower in his buttonhole, a smile on his face. Oberzohn got up
  like a man standing to attention.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Manfred, this is a great honour," he said, and held at his hand
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>An additional chair had been placed for the visitor: a rich-looking
  tapestried chair, to which the doctor waved the hand which Manfred did not
  take.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Manfred." Newton removed his cigar and nodded genially.
  "Were you at the dance last night?"</p>

  <p>"I was there, but I didn't come in," said Manfred, seating himself. "You
  did not turn up till late, they tell me?"</p>

  <p>"It was of all occurrences the most unfortunate," said Dr. Oberzohn, and
  Newton laughed.</p>

  <p>"I've lost his laboratory secretary and he hasn't forgiven me," he said
  almost jovially. "The girl he took on yesterday. Rather a stunner in the way
  of looks. She didn't wish to go back to the country where she came from, so
  my sister offered to put her up for the night in Chester Square. I'm blessed
  if she didn't lose herself at the dance, and we haven't seen her since!"</p>

  <p>"It was a terrible thing," said Oberzohn sadly. "I regard her as in my
  charge. For her safety I am responsible. You, I trust, Mr. Newton&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think I should have another uneasy moment if I were you, doctor,"
  said Manfred easily. "The young lady is back at Heavytree Farm. I thought
  that would surprise you. And she is still there: that will surprise you more,
  if you have not already heard by telephone that your Old Guard failed
  dismally to&mdash;er&mdash;bring her back to work. I presume that was their
  object?"</p>

  <p>"My old guard, Mr. Manfred?" Oberzohn shook his head in bewilderment.
  "This is beyond my comprehension."</p>

  <p>"Is your sister well?" asked Manfred blandly. Newton shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>"She is naturally upset. And who wouldn't be? Joan is a very
  tender-hearted girl."</p>

  <p>"She has been that way for years," said Manfred offensively. "May I
  smoke?"</p>

  <p>"Will you have one of my cigarettes?" Manfred's grave eyes fixed the
  doctor in a stare that held the older man against his will.</p>

  <p>"I have had just one too many of your cigarettes," he said. His words came
  like a cold wind. "I do not want any more, Herr Doktor, or there will be
  vacancies in your family circle. Who knows that, long before you compound
  your wonderful elixir, you may be called to normal immortality?"</p>

  <p>The yellow face of Oberzohn had turned to a dull red.</p>

  <p>"You seem to know so much about me, Mr. Manfred, as myself," he said in a
  husky whisper.</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>"More. For whilst you are racing against time to avoid the end of a life
  which does not seem especially worthy of preservation, and whilst you know
  not what day or hour that end may come, I can tell you to the minute," The
  finger of his gloved hand pointed the threat.</p>

  <p>All trace of a smile had vanished from Monty Newton's face. His eyes did
  not leave the caller's.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you shall tell me." Oberzohn found a difficulty in speaking. Rage
  possessed him, and only his iron will choked down the flames from view.</p>

  <p>"The day that injury comes to Mirabelle Leicester, that day you go
  out&mdash;you and those who are with you!"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Manfred, there's a law in this country&mdash;" began Monty
  Newton hotly.</p>

  <p>"I am the law." The words rang like a knell of fate. "In this matter I am
  judge, jury, hangman. Old or young, I will not spare," he said evenly.</p>

  <p>"Are you immortal too?" sneered Monty.</p>

  <p>Only for a second did Manfred's eyes leave the old man's face.</p>

  <p>"The law is immortal," he said. "If you dream that, by some cleverly
  concerted coup, you can sweep me from your path before I grow dangerous, be
  sure that your sweep is clean."</p>

  <p>"You haven't asked me to come here to listen to this stuff, have you?"
  asked Newton, and though his words were bold, his manner aggressive, there
  were shadows on his face which were not there when Manfred had come into the
  room&mdash;shadows under his eyes and in his cheeks where plumpness had
  been.</p>

  <p>"I've come here to tell you to let up on Miss Leicester. You're after
  something that you cannot get, and nobody is in a position to give you. I
  don't know what it is&mdash;I will make you a present of that piece of
  information. But it's big&mdash;bigger than any prize you've ever gone after
  in your wicked lives. And to get that, you're prepared to sacrifice innocent
  lives with the recklessness of spendthrifts who think there is no bottom to
  their purse. The end is near!"</p>

  <p>He rose slowly and stood by the table, towering over the stiff-backed
  doctor.</p>

  <p>"I cannot say what action the police will take over this providential
  snake-bite, Oberzohn, but I'll make you this offer: I and my friends will
  stand out of the game and leave Meadows to get you in his own way. You think
  that means you'll go scot-free? But it doesn't. These police are like
  bull-dogs: once they've got a grip of you, they'll never let go."</p>

  <p>"What is the price you ask for this interesting service?" Newton was
  puffing steadily at his cigar, his hands clasped behind him, his feet apart,
  a picture of comfort and well-being.</p>

  <p>"Leave Miss Leicester alone. Find a new way of getting the money you need
  so badly."</p>

  <p>Newton laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, that's a stupid thing to say. Neither Oberzohn nor I are
  exactly poor."</p>

  <p>"You're bankrupt, both of you," said Manfred quietly. "You are in the
  position of gamblers when the cards have run against you for a long time. You
  have no reserve, and your expenses are enormous. Find another way,
  Newton&mdash;and tell your sister"&mdash;he paused by the door, looking down
  into the white lining of his silk hat&mdash;"I'd like to see her at Curzon
  Street to-morrow morning at ten o'clock."</p>

  <p>"Is that an order?" asked Newton sarcastically.</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>"Then let me tell you," roared the man, white with passion, "that I take
  no orders for her or for me. Got swollen heads since you've had your pardon,
  haven't you? You look out for me, Manfred. I'm not exactly harmless."</p>

  <p>He felt the pressure of the doctor's foot upon his and curbed his
  temper.</p>

  <p>"All right," he growled, "but don't expect to see Joan."</p>

  <p>He added a coarse jest, and Manfred raised his eyes slowly and met
  his.</p>

  <p>"You will be hanged by the State or murdered by Oberzohn&mdash;I am not
  sure which," he said simply, and he spoke with such perfect confidence that
  the heart of Monty Newton turned to water.</p>

  <p>Manfred stood in the sidewalk and signalled, and the little car came
  swiftly and noiselessly across. Leon's eyes were on the entrance. A tall man
  standing in the shadow of the hall was watching. He was leaning against the
  wall in a negligent attitude, and for a second Leon was startled.</p>

  <p>"Get in quickly!"</p>

  <p>Leon almost shouted the words back, and Manfred jumped into the machine,
  as the chauffeur sent the car forward, with a jerk that strained every
  gear.</p>

  <p>"What on&mdash;?" began Manfred, but the rest of his words were lost in
  the terrific crash which followed.</p>

  <p>The leather hood of the machine was ripped down at the back, a splinter of
  glass struck Leon's cap and sliced a half-moon neatly. He jammed on the
  brakes, threw open the door of the saloon and leaped out. Behind the car was
  a mass of wreckage; a great iron casting lay split into three pieces amidst a
  tangle of broken packing-case. Leon looked up; immediately above the entrance
  to Oberzohn &amp; Smitts' was a crane, which had swung out with a heavy load
  just before Manfred came out. The steel wire hung loosely from the derrick.
  He heard excited voices speaking from the open doorway three floors above,
  and two men in large glasses were looking down and gabbling in a language he
  did not understand.</p>

  <p>"A very pretty accident. We might have filled half a column in the evening
  newspapers if we had not moved."</p>

  <p>"And the gentleman in the hall&mdash;what was he doing?"</p>

  <p>Leon walked back through the entrance: the man had disappeared, but near
  where he had been standing was a small bell-push which, it was obvious, had
  recently been fixed, for the wires ran loosely on the surface of the wall and
  were new.</p>

  <p>He came back in time to see a policeman crossing the road.</p>

  <p>"I wish to find out how this accident occurred, constable," he said. "My
  master was nearly killed."</p>

  <p>The policeman looked at the ton of debris lying half on the sidewalk, half
  on the road, then up at the slackened hawser.</p>

  <p>"The cable has run off the drum, I should think."</p>

  <p>"I should think so," said Leon gravely.</p>

  <p>He did not wait for the policeman to finish his investigations, but went
  home at a steady pace, and made no reference to the "accident" until he had
  put away his car and had returned to Curzon Street.</p>

  <p>"The man in the hall was put there to signal when you were under the
  load&mdash;certain things must not happen," he said. "I am going out to make
  a few inquiries."</p>

  <p>Gonsalez knew one of Oberzohn's staff: a clean young Swede, with that
  knowledge of English which is normal in Scandinavian countries; and at nine
  o'clock that night he drifted into a Swedish restaurant in Dean Street and
  found the young man at the end of his meal. It was an acquaintance&mdash;one
  of many&mdash;that Leon had assiduously cultivated. The young man, who knew
  him as Mr. Heinz&mdash;Leon spoke German remarkably well&mdash;was glad to
  have a companion with whom he could discuss the inexplicable accident of the
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>"The cable was not fixed to the drum," he said. "It might have been
  terrible: there was a gentleman in a motor-car outside, and he had only moved
  away a few inches when the case fell. There is bad luck in that house. I am
  glad that I am leaving at the end of the week."</p>

  <p>Leon had some important questions to put, but he did not hurry, having the
  gift of patience to a marked degree. It was nearly ten when they parted, and
  Gonsalez went back to his garage, where he spent a quarter of an hour.</p>

  <p>At midnight, Manfred had just finished a long conversation with the
  Scotland Yard man who was still at Brightlingsea, when Leon came in, looking
  very pleased with himself. Poiccart had gone to bed, and Manfred had switched
  out one circuit of lights when his friend arrived.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, my dear George," said Gonsalez briskly. "It was very good of
  you, and I did not like troubling you, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was a small thing," said Manfred with a smile, "and involved merely
  the changing of my shoes. But why? I am not curious, but why did you wish me
  to telephone the night watchman at Oberzohn's to be waiting at the door at
  eleven o'clock for a message from the doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Because," said Leon cheerfully, rubbing his hands, "the night watchman is
  an honest man; he has a wife and six children, and I was particularly wishful
  not to hurt anybody. The building doesn't matter: it stands, or stood,
  isolated from all others. The only worry in my mind was the night watchman.
  He was at the door&mdash;I saw him."</p>

  <p>Manfred asked no further questions. Early the next morning he took up the
  paper and turned to the middle page, read the account of the "Big Fire in
  City Road" which completely gutted the premises of Messrs. Oberzohn &amp;
  Smitts; and, what is more, he expected to read it before he had seen the
  paper.</p>

  <p>"Accidents are accidents," said Leon the philosopher that morning at
  breakfast. "And that talk I had with the clerk last night told me a lot:
  Oberzohn has allowed his fire insurance to lapse!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16">XVI.&mdash;RATH HALL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN one of the forbidden rooms that was filled with the
  apparatus which Dr. Oberzohn had accumulated for his pleasure and benefit,
  was a small electrical furnace which was the centre of many of his most
  interesting experiments. There were, in certain known drugs, constituents
  which it was his desire to eliminate. Dr. Oberzohn believed absolutely in
  many things that the modern chemist would dismiss as fantastical.</p>

  <p>He believed in the philosopher's stone, in the transmutation of base
  metals to rare; he had made diamonds, of no great commercial value, it is
  true; but his supreme faith was that somewhere in the materia medica was an
  infallible elixir which would prolong life far beyond the normal span. It was
  to all other known properties as radium is to pitchblende. It was something
  that only the metaphysician could discover, only the patient chemist could
  materialize. Every hour he could spare he devoted himself to his obsession;
  and he was in the midst of one of his experiments when the telephone bell
  called him back to his study. He listened, every muscle of his face moving,
  to the tale of disaster that Monty Newton wailed. "It is burning still? Have
  you no fire-extinguishing machinery in London?"</p>

  <p>"Is the place insured or is it not?" asked Monty for the second time.</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn considered. "It is not," he said. "But this matter is of such
  small importance compared with the great thing which is coming, that I shall
  not give it a thought."</p>

  <p>"It was incendiary," said Newton angrily. "The fire brigade people are
  certain of it. That cursed crowd are getting back on us for what happened
  this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"I know of nothing that happened this afternoon," said Dr. Oberzohn
  coldly. "You know of nothing either. It was an accident which we all
  deplored. As to this man... we shall see."</p>

  <p>He hung up the telephone receiver very carefully, went along the passage,
  down a steep flight of dark stairs, and into a basement kitchen. Before he
  opened the door he heard the sound of furious voices, and he stood for a
  moment surveying the scene with every feeling of satisfaction. Except for two
  men, the room was empty. The servants used the actual kitchen at the front of
  the house, and this place was little better than a scullery. On one side of
  the deal table stood Gurther, white as death, his round eyes red with rage.
  On the other, the short, stout Russian Pole, with his heavy pasty face and
  baggy eyes; his little moustache and beard bristling with anger. The cards
  scattered on the table and the floor told the Herr Doktor that this was a
  repetition of the quarrel which was so frequent between them.</p>

  <p>"Schweinhund!" hissed Gurther. "I saw you palm the King as you dealt.
  Thief and robber of the blind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You German dog! You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They were both speaking in German. Then the doctor saw the hand of Gurther
  steal down and back.</p>

  <p>"Gurther!" he called, and the man spun round. "To my
  parlour&mdash;march!"</p>

  <p>Without a word, the man strode past him, and the doctor was left with the
  panting Russian.</p>

  <p>"Herr Doktor, this Gurther is beyond endurance!" His voice trembled with
  rage. "I would sooner live with a pig than this man, who is never normal
  unless he is drugged."</p>

  <p>"Silence!" shouted Oberzohn, and pointed to the chair. "You shall wait
  till I come," he said.</p>

  <p>When he came back to his room, he found Gurther standing stiffly to
  attention.</p>

  <p>"Now, Gurther," he said&mdash;he was almost benevolent as he patted the
  man on the shoulder&mdash;"this matter of Gonsalez must end. Can I have my
  Gurther hiding like a worm in the ground? No, that cannot be. To-night I will
  send you to this man, and you are so clever that you cannot fail. He whipped
  you, Gurther&mdash;tied you up and cruelly beat you&mdash;always remember
  that, my brave fellow&mdash;he beat you till you bled. Now you shall see the
  man again. You will go in a dress for-every-occasion," he said. "The
  city-clerk manner. You will watch him in your so clever way, and you shall
  strike&mdash;it is permitted."</p>

  <p>"Ja, Herr Doktor."</p>

  <p>He turned on his heels and disappeared through the door. The doctor waited
  till he heard him going up the stairs, and then he rang for Pfeiffer. The man
  came in sullenly. He lacked all the precision of the military Gurther; yet,
  as Oberzohn knew, of the two he was the more alert, the more cunning.</p>

  <p>"Pfeiffer, it has come to me that you are in some danger. The police wish
  to take you back to Warsaw, where certain unpleasant things happened, as you
  well know. And I am told"&mdash;he lowered his voice&mdash;"that a friend of
  ours would be glad to see you go, hein?"</p>

  <p>The man did not raise his sulky eyes from the floor, did not answer, or by
  any gesture or movement of body suggest that he had heard what the older man
  had said.</p>

  <p>"Gurther goes to-morrow, perhaps on our good work, perhaps to speak
  secretly to his friends in the police&mdash;who knows? He has work to do: let
  him do it, Pfeiffer. All my men will be there&mdash;at a place called
  Brightlingsea. You also shall go. Gurther would rob a blind man? Good! You
  shall rob one also. As for Gurther, I do not wish him back. I am tired of
  him: he is a madman. All men are mad who sniff that white snuff up their
  foolish noses&mdash;eh, Pfeiffer?"</p>

  <p>Still the awkward-looking man made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Let him do his work: you shall not interfere, until&mdash;it is
  done."</p>

  <p>Pfeiffer was looking at him now, a cold sneer on his face.</p>

  <p>"If he comes back, I do not," he said. "This man is frightening me. Twice
  the police have been here&mdash;three times... you remember the woman. The
  man is a danger, Herr Doktor. I told you he was the day you brought him
  here."</p>

  <p>"He can dress in the gentleman-club manner," said the doctor gently.</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" said the other scornfully. "Is he not an actor who has postured
  and painted his face and thrown about his legs for so many marks a week?"</p>

  <p>"If he does not come back I shall be relieved," murmured the doctor.
  "Though it would be a mistake to leave him so that these cunning men could
  pry into our affairs."</p>

  <p>Pfeiffer said nothing: he understood his instructions; there was nothing
  to be said. "When does he go?"</p>

  <p>"Early to-morrow, before daylight. You will see him, of course."</p>

  <p>He said something in a low tone, that only Pfeiffer heard. The shadow who
  stood in stockinged feet listening at the door only heard two words. Gurther
  grinned in the darkness; his bright eyes grew luminous. He heard his
  companion move towards the door and sped up the stairs without a sound.</p>

  <p>Rath Hall was a rambling white building of two stories, set in the midst
  of a little park, so thickly wooded that the house was invisible from the
  road; and since the main entrance to the estate was a very commonplace gate,
  without lodge or visible drive beyond, Gonsalez would have missed the place
  had he not recognized the man who was sitting on the moss-grown and broken
  wall who jumped down as Leon stopped his car.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Meadows is at the house, sir. He said he expected you."</p>

  <p>"And where on earth is the house?" asked Leon Gonsalez, as he went into
  reverse.</p>

  <p>For answer the detective opened the gate wide and Leon sent his car
  winding between the trees, for close at hand he recognized where a gravel
  drive had once been, and, moreover, he saw the tracks of cars in the soft
  earth. He arrived just as Mr. Johnson Lee was taking his two guests in to
  dinner; and Meadows was obviously glad to see him. He excused himself, and
  took Leon aside into the hall, where they could not be overheard.</p>

  <p>"I have had your message," he said. "The only thing that happened out of
  the ordinary is that the servants have an invitation to a big concert at
  Brightlingsea. You expected that?"</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes: I hope Lee will let them go. I prefer that they should be out of the
  way. A crude scheme&mdash;but Oberzohn does these things. Has anything else
  happened?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. There have been one or two queer people around."</p>

  <p>"Has he showed you the letters he had from Barberton?"</p>

  <p>To his surprise the inspector answered in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but they are worse than Greek to me. A series of tiny protuberances
  on thick brown paper. He keeps them in his safe. He read some of the letters
  to me: they were not very illuminating."</p>

  <p>"But the letter of letters?" asked Leon anxiously. "That which Lee
  answered&mdash;by the way, you know that Mr. Lee wrote all his letters
  between perforated lines?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen the paper," nodded the detective. "No, I asked him about that,
  but apparently he is not anxious to talk until he has seen his lawyer, who is
  coming down to-night. He should have been here, in fact, in time for
  dinner."</p>

  <p>They passed into the dining-room together. The blind man was waiting
  patiently at the head of the table, and with an apology Leon took the place
  that had been reserved for him. He sat with his back to the wall, facing one
  of the three long windows that looked out upon the park. It was a warm night
  and the blinds were up, as also was the middle window that faced him. He made
  a motion to Mr. Washington, who sat opposite him, to draw a little aside, and
  the American realized that he wished an uninterrupted view of the park.</p>

  <p>"Would you like the window closed?" asked Mr. Lee, leaning forward and
  addressing the table in general. "I know it is open," he said with a little
  laugh, "because I opened it! I am a lover of fresh air."</p>

  <p>They murmured their agreement and the meal went on without any
  extraordinary incident. Mr. Washington was one of those adaptable people who
  dovetail into any environment in which they find themselves. He was as much
  at home at Rath Hall as though he had been born and bred in the
  neighbourhood. Moreover, he had a special reason for jubilation: he had found
  a rare adder when walking in the woods that morning, and spent ten minutes
  explaining in what respect it differed from every other English adder.</p>

  <p>"Is it dead?" asked Meadows nervously.</p>

  <p>"Kill it?" said the indignant Mr. Washington. "Why' should I kill it? I
  saw a whole lot of doves out on the lawn this morning&mdash;should I kill
  'em? No, sir! I've got none of those mean feelings towards snakes. I guess
  the Lord sent snakes into this world for some other purpose than to be chased
  and killed every time they're seen. I sent him up to London to-day by train
  to a friend of mine at the Zoological Gardens. He'll keep him until I'm ready
  to take him back home."</p>

  <p>Meadows drew a long sigh.</p>

  <p>"As long as he's not in your pocket," he said.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind?"</p>

  <p>Leon's voice was urgent as he signalled Washington to move yet farther to
  the left, and when the big man moved his chair, Leon nodded his thanks. His
  eyes were on the window and the darkening lawn. Not once did he remove his
  gaze.</p>

  <p>"It's an extraordinary thing about Poole, my lawyer," Mr. Lee was saying.
  "He promised faithfully he'd be at Rath by seven o'clock. What is the
  time?"</p>

  <p>Meadows looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Half-past eight," he said. He saw the cloud that came over the face of
  the blind owner of Rath Hall.</p>

  <p>"It is extraordinary! I wonder if you would mind&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His foot touched a bell beneath the table and his butler came in.</p>

  <p>"Will you telephone to Mr. Poole's house and ask if he has left?"</p>

  <p>The butler returned in a short time.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, Mr. Poole left the house by car at half-past six."</p>

  <p>Johnson Lee sat back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Half-past six? He should have been here by now."</p>

  <p>"How far away does he live?"</p>

  <p>"About fifteen miles. I thought he might have come down from London rather
  late. That is extraordinary."</p>

  <p>"He may have had tyre trouble," said Leon, not shifting his fixed
  stare."</p>

  <p>"He could have telephoned."</p>

  <p>"Did anyone know he was coming&mdash;anybody outside your own household?"
  asked Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>The blind man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I mentioned the fact to the post office this morning. I went in to
  get my letters, and found that one I had written to Mr. Poole had been
  returned through a mistake on my part. I told the postmaster that he was
  coming this evening and that there was no need to forward it."</p>

  <p>"You were in the public part of the post office?"</p>

  <p>"I believe I was."</p>

  <p>"You said nothing else, Mr. Lee&mdash;nothing that would give any idea of
  the object of this visit?"</p>

  <p>Again his host hesitated. "I don't know. I'm almost afraid that I did," he
  confessed. "I remember telling the postmaster that I was going to talk to Mr.
  Poole about poor Barberton&mdash;Mr. Barberton was very well known in this
  neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"That is extremely unfortunate," said Leon.</p>

  <p>He was thinking of two things at the same time: the whereabouts of the
  missing lawyer, and the wonderful cover that the wall between the window and
  the floor gave to any man who might creep along out of sight until he got
  back suddenly to send the snake on its errand of death.</p>

  <p>"How many men have you got in the grounds, by the way, Meadows?"</p>

  <p>"One, and he's not in the grounds but outside on the road. I pull him in
  at night, or rather in the evening, to patrol the grounds, and he is armed."
  He said this with a certain importance. An armed English policeman is a
  tremendous phenomenon that few have seen.</p>

  <p>"Which means that he has a revolver that he hasn't fired except at target
  practice," said Leon. "Excuse me&mdash;I thought I heard a car."</p>

  <p>He got up noiselessly from the table, went round the back of Mr. Lee, and,
  darting to the window, looked out. A flower-bed ran close to the wall, and
  beyond that was a broad gravel drive. Between gravel and flowers was a wide
  strip of turf. The drive continued some fifty feet to the right before it
  turned under an aich of rambler roses. To the left it extended for less than
  a dozen feet, and from this point a path parallel the side of the house ran
  into the drive.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear it?" asked Lee.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I was mistaken."</p>

  <p>Leon dipped his hand into his side pocket, took out a handful of something
  that looked like tiny candles wrapped in coloured paper. Only Meadows saw him
  scatter them left and right, and he was too discreet to ask why, Leon saw the
  inquiring lift of his eyebrows as he came back to his seat, but was wilfully
  dense. Thereafter, he ate his dinner with only an occasional glance towards
  the window.</p>

  <p>"I'm not relying entirely upon my own lawyer's advice," I said Mr. Lee. "I
  have telegraphed to Lisbon to ask Dr. Pinto Caillao to come to England, and
  he may be of greater service even than Poole, though where&mdash;" The butler
  came in at this moment.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Poole has just telephoned, sir. Her husband has had a bad accident:
  his car ran into a tree trunk which was lying across the road near Lawley. It
  was on the other side of the bend, and he did not see it until too late."</p>

  <p>"Is he very badly hurt?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, but he is in the Cottage Hospital. Mrs. Poole says he is fit to
  travel home."</p>

  <p>The blind man sat open-mouthed. "What a terrible thing to have happened!"
  he began. "A very lucky thing for Mr. Poole," said Leon cheerfully. "I feared
  worse than that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>From somewhere outside the window came a "snap!"&mdash;the sound that a
  Christmas cracker makes when it is exploded. Leon got up from the table,
  walked swiftly to the side of the window and jumped out. As he struck the
  earth, he trod on one of the little bon-bons he had scattered and it cracked
  viciously under his foot.</p>

  <p>There was nobody in sight. He ran swiftly along the grass-plot, slowing
  his pace as came to the end of the wall, and then jerked round, gun extended
  stiffly. Still nobody. Before him was a close-growing box hedge, in which had
  been cut an opening. He heard the crack of a signal behind him, guessed that
  it was Meadows, and presently the detective joined him. Leon put his fingers
  to his lips, leapt the path to the grass on the other side, and dodged behind
  a tree until he could see straight through the opening in the box hedge.
  Beyond was a rose-garden, a mass of pink and red and golden blooms.</p>

  <p>Leon put his hand in his pocket and took out a black cylinder, fitting it,
  without taking his eyes from the hedge opening, to the muzzle of his pistol.
  Meadows heard the dull thud of the explosion before he saw the pistol go up.
  There was a scatter of leaves and twigs and the sound of hurrying feet. Leon
  dashed through the opening in time to see a man plunge into a plantation.</p>

  <p>"Plop!"</p>

  <p>The bullet struck a tree not a foot from the fugitive.</p>

  <p>"That's that!" said Leon, and took off his silencer. "I hope none of the
  servants heard it, and most of all that Lee, whose hearing is unfortunately
  most acute, mistook the shot for something else."</p>

  <p>He went back to the window, stopping to pick up such of his crackers as
  had not exploded.</p>

  <p>"They are useful things to put on the floor of your room when you're
  expecting to have your throat cut in the middle of the night," he said
  pleasantly. "They cost exactly two dollars a hundred, and they've saved my
  life more often than I can count. Have you ever waited in the dark to have
  your throat cut?" he asked. "It happened to me three times, and I will admit
  that it is not an experience that I am anxious to repeat. Once in Bohemia, in
  the city of Prague; once in New Orleans, and once in Ortona."</p>

  <p>"What happened to the assassins?" asked Meadows with a shiver.</p>

  <p>"That is a question for the theologian, if you will forgive the well-worn
  jest," said Leon. "I think they are in hell, but then I'm prejudiced."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lee had left the dining-table and was standing at the front door,
  leaning on his stick; and with him an interested Mr. Washington.</p>

  <p>"What was the trouble?" asked the old man in a worried voice. "It is a
  great handicap not being able to see things. But I thought I heard a shot
  fired."</p>

  <p>"Two," said Leon promptly. "I hoped you hadn't heard them. I don't know
  who the man was, Mr. Lee, but he certainly had no right in the grounds, and I
  scared him off."</p>

  <p>"You must have used a silencer: I did not hear the shots fully. Did you
  catch a view of the man's face?"</p>

  <p>"No, I saw his back," he said. Leon thought it was unnecessary to add that
  a man's back was as familiar to him as his face. For when he studied his
  enemies, his study was a very thorough and complete one. Moreover, Gurther
  ran with a peculiar swing of his shoulder.</p>

  <p>He turned suddenly to the master of Rath Hall. "May I speak with you
  privately for a few minutes, Mr. Lee?" he asked. He had taken a sudden
  resolution.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said the other courteously, and tapped his way into the hall
  and into his private study.</p>

  <p>For ten minutes Leon was closeted with him. When he came out, Meadows had
  gone down to his man at the gate, and Washington was standing disconsolately
  alone. Leon took him by the arm and led him on to the lawn.</p>

  <p>"There's going to be real trouble here to-night," he said, and told him
  the arrangement he had made with Mr. Johnson Lee. "I've tried to persuade him
  to let me see the letter which is in his safe, but he is like rock on that
  matter, and I'd hate to burgle the safe of a friend. Listen."</p>

  <p>Elijah Washington listened and whistled.</p>

  <p>"They stopped the lawyer coming," Gonsalez went on, "and now they're
  mortally scared if, in his absence, the old man tells us what he intended
  keeping for his lawyer."</p>

  <p>"Meadows is going to London, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>Leon nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is going to London&mdash;by car. Did you know all the servants
  were going out to-night?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Washington stared at him.</p>

  <p>"The women, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"The women and the men," said Leon calmly. "There is an excellent concert
  at Brightlingsea to-night, and though they will be late for the first half of
  the performance, they will thoroughly enjoy the latter portion of the
  programme. The invitation is not mine, but it is one I thoroughly
  approve."</p>

  <p>"But does Meadows want to go away when the fun is starting?"</p>

  <p>Apparently Inspector Meadows was not averse from leaving at this critical
  moment. He was, in fact, quite happy to go. Mr. Washington's views on police
  intelligence underwent a change for the worse.</p>

  <p>"But surely he had better stay?" said the American. "If you're expecting
  an attack... they are certain to marshal the whole of their forces?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely certain," said the calm Gonsalez "Here is the car."</p>

  <p>The Rolls came out from the back of the house at that moment and drew up
  before the door.</p>

  <p>"I don't like leaving you," said Meadows, as he swung himself up by the
  driver's side and put his bag on the seat.</p>

  <p>"Tell the driver to avoid Lawley like the plague," said Leon. "There's a
  tree down, unless the local authorities have removed it&mdash;which is very
  unlikely."</p>

  <p>He waited until the tail lights of the machine had disappeared into the
  gloom, then he went back to the hall.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir," said the butler, struggling into his great-coat as he
  spoke. "Will you be all right&mdash;there is nobody left in the house to look
  after Mr. Lee. I could stay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was Mr. Lee's suggestion you should all go," said Gonsalez briefly.
  "Just go outside and tell me when the lights of the char-a-banc come into
  view. I want to speak to Mr. Lee before you go."</p>

  <p>He went into the library and shut the door behind him. The waiting butler
  heard the murmur of his voice and had some qualms of conscience. The tickets
  had come from a local agency; he had never dreamt that, with guests in the
  house, his employer would allow the staff to go in its entirety.</p>

  <p>It was not a char-a-banc but a big closed bus that came lumbering up the
  apology for a drive, and swept round to the back of the house, to the
  annoyance of the servants, who were gathered in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother, I will tell him," said Leon. He seemed to have taken full
  charge of the house, an unpardonable offence in the eyes of well-regulated
  servants.</p>

  <p>He disappeared through a long passage leading into the mysterious domestic
  regions, and returned to announce that the driver had rectified his error and
  was coming to the front entrance: an unnecessary explanation, since the big
  vehicle drew up as he was telling the company.</p>

  <p>"There goes the most uneasy bunch of festive souls it has ever been my
  misfortune to see," he said, as the bus, its brakes squeaking, went down the
  declivity towards the unimposing gate. "And yet they'll have the time of
  their lives. I've arranged supper for them at the Beech Hotel, and although
  they are not aware of it, I am removing them to a place where they'd give a
  lot of money to be&mdash;if they hadn't gone!"</p>

  <p>"That leaves you and me alone," said Mr. Washington glumly, but brightened
  up almost at once. "I can't say that I mind a rough house, with or without
  gun-play," he said. He looked round the dark hall a little apprehensively.
  "What about fastening the doors behind?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They're all right," said Leon. "It isn't from the back that danger will
  come. Come out and enjoy the night air... it is a little too soon for the
  real trouble."</p>

  <p>But here, for once, he was mistaken.</p>

  <p>Elijah Washington followed him into the park, took two paces, and suddenly
  Leon saw him stagger. In a second he was by the man's side, bent and peering,
  his glasses discarded on the grass.</p>

  <p>"Get me inside," said Washington's voice. He was leaning heavily upon his
  companion.</p>

  <p>With his arm round his waist, taking half his weight, Leon pushed the man
  into the hall but did not close the door. Instead, as the American sat down
  with a thud upon a hall seat, Leon fell to the ground, and peered along the
  artificial sky-line he had created. There was no movement, no sign of any
  attacker. Then and only then did he shut the door and drop the bar, and
  pushing the study door wide, carried the man into the room and switched on
  the lights.</p>

  <p>"I guess something got me then," muttered Washington.</p>

  <p>His right cheek was red and swollen, and Leon saw the tell-tale bite; saw
  something else. He put his hand to the cheek and examined his
  finger-tips.</p>

  <p>"Get me some whisky, will you?&mdash;about a gallon of it."</p>

  <p>He was obviously in great pain and sat rocking himself to and fro.</p>

  <p>"Gosh! This is awful!" he groaned. "Never had any snake that bit like
  this!"</p>

  <p>"You're alive, my friend, and I didn't believe you when you said you were
  snake-proof."</p>

  <p>Leon poured out a tumbler of neat whisky and held it to the American's
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Down with Prohibition!" murmured Washington, and did not take the glass
  from his lips until it was empty. "You can give me another dose of
  that&mdash;I shan't get pickled," he said.</p>

  <p>He put his hand up to his face and touched the tiny wound
  gingerly&mdash;"It is wet," he said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"What did it feel like?"</p>

  <p>"Like nothing so much as a snake-bite," confessed the expert.</p>

  <p>Already his face was puffed beneath the eyes, and the skin was discoloured
  black and blue.</p>

  <p>Leon crossed to the fire-place and pushed the bell, and Washington watched
  him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Say, what's the good of ringing? The servants have gone."</p>

  <p>There was a patter of feet in the hall, the door was flung open and George
  Manfred came in, and behind him the startled visitor saw Meadows and a dozen
  men.</p>

  <p>"For the Lord's sake!" he said sleepily.</p>

  <p>"They came in the char-a-banc, lying on the floor," explained Leon, "and
  the only excuse for bringing a char-a-banc here was to send the servants to
  that concert."</p>

  <p>"You got Lee away?" asked Manfred.</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>"He was in the car that took friend Meadows, who transferred to the
  char-a-banc somewhere out of sight of the house."</p>

  <p>Washington had taken a small cardboard box from his pocket and was rubbing
  a red powder gingerly upon the two white-edged marks, groaning the while.</p>

  <p>"This is certainly a snake that's got the cobra skinned to death and a
  rattlesnake's bite ain't worse than a dog nip," he said. "Mamba nothing! I
  know the mamba; he is pretty fatal, but not so bad as this."</p>

  <p>Manfred looked across to Leon.</p>

  <p>"Gurther?" he asked simply, and Gonsalez nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was intended for me obviously, but, as I've said before, Gurther is
  nervous. And it didn't help him any to be shot up."</p>

  <p>"Do you fellows mind not talking so loud?" He glanced at the heavy
  curtains that covered the windows. Behind these the shutters had been
  fastened, and Dr. Oberzohn was an ingenious man.</p>

  <p>Leon took a swift survey of the visitor's feet; they wore felt
  slippers.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I can improve upon the tactics of the admirable Miss
  Leicester," he said, and went up to Mr. Lee's bedroom, which was in the
  centre of the house and had a small balcony, the floor of which was formed by
  the top of the porch.</p>

  <p>The long French windows were open and Leon crawled out into the darkness
  and took observation through the pillars of the balustrade. They were in the
  open now, making no attempt to conceal their presence. He counted seven,
  until he saw the cigarette of another near the end of the drive. What were
  they waiting for? he wondered. None of them moved; they were not even closing
  on the house. And this inactivity puzzled him. They were awaiting a signal.
  What was it to be? Whence would it come?</p>

  <p>He saw a man come stealthily across the lawn... one or two? His eyes were
  playing tricks. If there were two, one was Gurther. There was no mistaking
  him. For a second he passed out of view behind a pillar of the balcony. Leon
  moved his head... Gurther had fallen! He saw him stumble to his knees and
  tumble flat upon the ground. What did that mean?</p>

  <p>He was still wondering when he heard a soft scraping, and a deep-drawn
  breath, and tried to locate the noise. Suddenly, within a few inches of his
  face, a hand came up out of the darkness and gripped the lower edge of the
  balcony.</p>

  <p>Swiftly, noiselessly, Gonsalez wriggled back to the room, drew erect in
  the cover of the curtains and waited. His hand touched something: it was a
  long silken cord by which the curtains were drawn. Leon grinned in the
  darkness and made a scientific loop.</p>

  <p>The intruder drew himself up on to the parapet, stepped quietly across,
  then tiptoed to the open window. He was not even suspicious, for the French
  windows had been open all the evening. Without a sound, he stepped into the
  room and was momentarily silhouetted against the starlight reflected in the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Hatless," thought Leon. That made things easier. As the man took another
  stealthy step, the noose dropped over his neck, jerked tight and strangled
  the cry in his throat. In an instant he was lying flat on the ground with a
  knee in his back. He struggled to rise, but Leon's fist came down with the
  precision of a piston-rod, and he went suddenly quiet.</p>

  <p>Gonsalez loosened the slip-knot, and, flinging the man over his shoulder,
  carried him out of the room and down the stairs. He could only guess that
  this would be the only intruder, but left nothing to chance, and after he had
  handed his prisoner to the men who were waiting in the hall, he ran back to
  the room, to find, as he had expected, that no other adventurer had followed
  the lead. They were still standing at irregular intervals where he had seen
  them last. The signal was to come from the house. What was it to be? he
  wondered.</p>

  <p>He left one of his men on guard in the room and went back to the study, to
  find that the startled burglar was an old friend. Lew Cuccini was looking
  from one of his captors to the other, a picture of dumbfounded chagrin. But
  the most extraordinary discovery that Leon made on his return to the study
  was that the American snake-charmer was his old cheerful self, and, except
  for his unsightly appearance, seemed to be none the worse for an ordeal which
  would have promptly ended the lives of ninety-nine men out of a hundred.
  "Snake-proof&mdash;that's me. Is this the guy that did it?" He pointed to
  Cuccini.</p>

  <p>"Where is Gurther?" asked Manfred,</p>

  <p>Cuccini grinned up into his face.</p>

  <p>"You'd better find out, boss," he said. "He'll fix you. As soon as I
  shout&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cuccini&mdash;" Leon's voice was gentle. The point of the long-bladed
  knife that he held to the man's neck was indubitably sharp. Cuccini shrank
  back. "You will not shout. If you do, I shall cut your throat and spoil all
  these beautiful carpets&mdash;that is a genuine silken Bokhara, George. I
  haven't seen one in ten years." He nodded to the soft-hued rug on which
  George Manfred was standing. "What is the signal, Cuccini?" turning his
  attention again to the prisoner. "And what happens when you give the
  signal?"</p>

  <p>"Listen," said Cuccini, "that throat-cutting stuff don't mean anything to
  me. There's no third degree in this country, and don't forget it."</p>

  <p>"You have never seen my ninety-ninth degree." Leon smiled like a delighted
  boy. "Put something in his mouth, will you?"</p>

  <p>One of the men tied a woollen scarf round Cuccini's head.</p>

  <p>"Lay him on the sofa."</p>

  <p>He was already bound hand and foot and helpless.</p>

  <p>"Have you any wax matches? Yes, here are some." Leon emptied a cut-glass
  container into the palm of his hand and looked round at the curious company.
  "Now, gentlemen, if you will leave me alone for exactly five minutes, I will
  give Mr. Cuccini an excellent imitation of the persuasive methods of Gian
  Visconti, an excellent countryman of his, and the inventor of the system I am
  about to apply."</p>

  <p>Cuccini was shaking his head furiously. A mumble of unintelligible sounds
  came from behind the scarf.</p>

  <p>"Our friend is not unintelligent. Any of you who say that Signer Cuccini
  is unintelligent will incur my severest displeasure," said Leon.</p>

  <p>They sat the man up and he talked brokenly, hesitatingly. "Splendid," said
  Leon, when he had finished. "Take him into the kitchen and give him a
  drink&mdash;you'll find a tap above the kitchen sink."</p>

  <p>"I've often wondered, Leon," said George, when they were alone together,
  "whether you would ever carry out those horrific threats of yours of torture
  and malignant savagery?"</p>

  <p>"Half the torture of torture is anticipation," said Leon easily, lighting
  a cigarette with one of the matches he had taken from the table, and
  carefully guiding the rest back into the glass bowl. "Any man versed in the
  art of suggestive descriptions can dispense with thumbscrews and branding
  irons, little maidens and all the ghastly apparatus of criminal justice ever
  employed by our ancestors. I, too, wonder," he mused, blowing a ring of smoke
  to the ceiling, "whether I could carry my threats into execution&mdash;I must
  try one day." He nodded pleasantly, as though he were promising himself a
  great treat.</p>

  <p>Manfred looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"What do you intend doing&mdash;giving the signal?" Gonsalez nodded. "And
  then?"</p>

  <p>"Letting them come in. We may take refuge in the kitchen. I think it would
  be wiser."</p>

  <p>George Manfred nodded. "You're going to allow them to open the safe?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Leon. "I particularly wish that safe to be opened, and
  since Mr. Lee demurs, I think this is the best method. I had that in my mind
  all the time. Have you seen the safe, George? I have. Nobody but an expert
  could smash it. I have no tools. I did not provide against such a
  contingency, and I have scruples. Our friends have tools&mdash;and no
  scruples!"</p>

  <p>"And the snake&mdash;is there any danger?"</p>

  <p>Leon snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>"The snake has struck for the night, and will strike no more! As for
  Gurther&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He owes you something."</p>

  <p>Leon sent another ring up and did not speak until it broke on the
  ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Gurther is dead," he said simply. "He has been lying on the lawn in front
  of the house for the past ten minutes."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">XVII.&mdash;WRITTEN IN BRAILLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LEON briefly related the scene he had witnessed from the
  balcony.</p>

  <p>"It was undoubtedly Gurther," he said. "I could not mistake him. He passed
  out of view for a second behind one of the pillars, and when I looked round
  he was lying flat on the ground."</p>

  <p>He threw his cigarette into the fire-place.</p>

  <p>"I think it is nearly time," he said. He waited until Manfred had gone,
  and, going to the door, moved the bar and pulled it open wide.</p>

  <p>Stooping down, he saw that the opening of the door had been observed, for
  one of the men was moving across the lawn in the direction of the house. From
  his pocket he took a small electric lamp and sent three flickering beams into
  the darkness. To his surprise, only two men walked forward to the house.
  Evidently Cuccini was expected to deal with any resistance before the raid
  occurred.</p>

  <p>The house had been built in the fifteenth century, and the entrance hall
  was a broad, high barn of a place. Some Georgian architect, in the peculiar
  manner of his kind, had built a small minstrel gallery over the dining-room
  entrance and immediately facing the study. Leon had already explored the
  house and had found the tiny staircase that led to this architectural
  monstrosity. He had no sooner given the signal than he dived into the
  dining-room, through the tall door, and was behind the thick curtains at the
  back of the narrow gallery when the first two men came in. He saw them go
  straight into the study and push open the door. At the same time a third man
  appeared under the porch, though he made no attempt to enter the hall.</p>

  <p>Presently one of those who had gone into the study came out and called
  Cuccini by name. When no answer came, he went grumbling back to his task.
  What that task was, Leon could guess, before the peculiarly acrid smell of
  hot steel was wafted to his sensitive nostrils.</p>

  <p>By crouching down he could see the legs of the men who were working at the
  safe. They had turned on all the lights, and apparently expected no
  interruption. The man at the door was joined by another man.</p>

  <p>"Where is Lew?"</p>

  <p>In the stillness of the house the words, though spoken in a low tone, were
  audible.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;inside somewhere. He had to fix that dago."</p>

  <p>Leon grinned. This description of himself never failed to tickle him.</p>

  <p>One of the workers in the library came out at this point.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Cuccini?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the man at the door.</p>

  <p>"Go in and find him. He ought to be here."</p>

  <p>Cuccini's absence evidently made him uneasy, for though he returned to the
  room he was out again in a minute, asking if the messenger had come back.
  Then, from the back of the passage, came the searcher's voice: "The kitchen's
  locked."</p>

  <p>The safe-cutter uttered an expression of amazement.</p>

  <p>"Locked? What's the idea?"</p>

  <p>He came to the foot of the stairs and bellowed up: "Cuccini!"</p>

  <p>Only the echo answered him.</p>

  <p>"That's queer." He poked his head in the door of the study. "Rush that
  job, Mike. There's some funny business here." And over his shoulder, "Tell
  the boys to get ready to jump."</p>

  <p>The man went out into the night and was absent some minutes, to return
  with an alarming piece of news.</p>

  <p>"They've gone, boss. I can't see one of them."</p>

  <p>The "boss" cursed him, and himself went into the grounds on a visit of
  inspection. He came back in a hurry, ran into the study, and Leon heard his
  voice: "Stand ready to clear."</p>

  <p>"What about Cuccini?"</p>

  <p>"Cuccini will have to look after himself... got it, Mike?"</p>

  <p>The deep voice said something. There followed the sound of a crack, as
  though something of iron had broken. It was the psychological moment. Leon
  parted the curtains and dropped lightly to the floor.</p>

  <p>The man at the door turned in a flash at the sound.</p>

  <p>"Put 'em up!" he said sharply.</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot." Leon's voice was almost conversational in its calmness.
  "The house is surrounded by police."</p>

  <p>With an oath the man darted out of the door, and at that instant came the
  sound of the first shot, followed by desultory firing from the direction of
  the road. The second guard had been the first to go. Leon ran to the door,
  slammed it tight and switched on the lights as the two men came from the
  study. Under the arm of one was a thick pad of square brown sheets. He
  dropped his load and put up his hands at the sight of the gun; but his
  companion was made of harder material, and, with a yell, he leapt at the man
  who stood between him and freedom. Leon twisted aside, advanced his shoulder
  to meet the furious drive of the man's fist; then, dropping his pistol, he
  stooped swiftly and tackled him below the knees. The man swayed, sought to
  recover his balance and fell with a crash on the stone floor. All the time
  his companion stood dazed and staring, his hands waving in the air.</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the outer door. Without turning his back upon his
  prisoners, Leon reached for the bar and pulled it up. Manfred came in.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman who shouted 'Cuccini' scared them. I think they've got
  away. There were two cars parked on the road."</p>

  <p>His eyes fell upon the brown sheets scattered on the floor and he
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think you have all you want, Leon," he said.</p>

  <p>The detectives came crowding in at that moment and secured their prisoners
  whilst Leon Gonsalez and his friend went out on to the lawn to search for
  Gurther.</p>

  <p>The man lay as he had fallen, on his face, and as Leon flashed his lamp
  upon the figure, he saw that the snake had struck behind the ear.</p>

  <p>"Gurther?" frowned Leon.</p>

  <p>He turned the figure on its back and gave a little gasp of surprise, for
  there looked up to the starry skies the heavy face of Pfeiffer.</p>

  <p>"Pfeiffer! I could have sworn it was the other! There has been some
  double-crossing here. Let me think." He stood for fully a minute, his chin on
  his hand. "I could have understood Gurther; he was becoming a nuisance and a
  danger to the old man. Pfeiffer, the more reliable of the two, hated him. My
  first theory was that Gurther had been put out by order of Oberzohn."</p>

  <p>"Suppose Gurther heard that order, or came to know of it?" asked Manfred
  quietly.</p>

  <p>Leon snapped his fingers.</p>

  <p>"That is it! We had a similar case a few years ago, you will remember,
  George? The old man gave the 'out' order to Pfeiffer&mdash;and Gurther got
  his blow in first. Shrewd fellow!"</p>

  <p>When they returned to the house, the three were seated in a row in Johnson
  Lee's Library. Cuccini, of course, was an old acquaintance. Of the other two
  men, Leon recognized one, a notorious gunman whose photograph had embellished
  the pages of Hue and Cry for months.</p>

  <p>The third, and evidently the skilled workman of the party, for he it was
  whom they had addressed as "Mike" and who had burnt out the lock of Lee's
  safe, was identified by Meadows as Mike Selwyn, a skilful burglar and
  bank-smasher, who had, according to his statement, only arrived from the
  Continent that afternoon in answer to a flattering invitation which promised
  considerable profit to himself.</p>

  <p>"And why I left Milan," he said bitterly, "where the graft is easy and the
  money's good, I'd like you to tell me!"</p>

  <p>The prisoners were removed to the nearest secure lock-up, and by the time
  Lee's servants returned from their dance, all evidence of an exciting hour
  had disappeared, except that the blackened and twisted door of the safe
  testified to the sinister character of the visitation.</p>

  <p>Meadows returned as they were gathering together the scattered sheets.
  There were hundreds of them, all written in Braille characters, and Manfred's
  sensitive fingers were skimming their surface.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," he said, in answer to a question that was put to him, "I knew
  Lee was blind, the day we searched Barberton's effects. That was my mystery."
  He laughed. "Barberton expected a call from his old friend and had left a
  message for him on the mantelpiece. Do you remember that strip of paper? It
  ran: 'Dear Johnny, I will be back in an hour.' These are letters,"&mdash;he
  indicated the papers.</p>

  <p>"The folds tell me that," said Meadows. "You may not get a conviction
  against Cuccini; the two burglars will come up before a judge, but to charge
  Cuccini means the whole story of the snake coming out, and that means a
  bigger kick than I'm prepared to laugh away&mdash;I am inclined to let
  Cuccini go for the moment."</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded. He sat with the embossed sheets on his knee.</p>

  <p>"Written from various places," he went on.</p>

  <p>It was curious to see him, his fingers running swiftly along the embossed
  lines, his eyes fixed on vacancy.</p>

  <p>"So far I've learnt nothing, except that in his spare time Barberton
  amused himself by translating native fairy stories into English and putting
  them into Braille for use in the blind school. I knew, of course, that he did
  that, because I'd already interviewed his sister, who is the mistress of the
  girls' section."</p>

  <p>He had gone through half a dozen letters when he rose from the table and
  walked across to the safe.</p>

  <p>"I have a notion that the thing we're seeking is not here," he said. "It
  is hardly likely that he would allow a communication of that character to be
  jumbled up with the rest of the correspondence."</p>

  <p>The safe door was open and the steel drawer at the back had been pulled
  out. Evidently it was from this receptacle that the letters had been taken.
  Now the drawer was empty. Manfred took it out and measured the depth of it
  with his finger.</p>

  <p>"Let me see," said Gonsalez suddenly.</p>

  <p>He groped along the floor of the safe, and presently he began to feel
  carefully along the sides.</p>

  <p>"Nothing here," he said. He drew out half a dozen account books and a
  bundle of documents which at first glance Manfred had put aside as being
  personal to the owner of Rath Hall. These were lying on the floor amidst the
  mass of molten metal that had burnt deep holes in the carpet. Leon examined
  the books one by one, opening them and running his nail along the edge of the
  pages. The fourth, a weighty ledger, did not open so easily&mdash;did not,
  indeed, open at all. He carried it to the table and tried to pull back the
  cover. "Now, how does this open?"</p>

  <p>The ledger covers were of leather; to all appearance a very ordinary book,
  and Leon was anxious not to disturb so artistic a camouflage. Examining the
  edge carefully, he saw a place where the edges had been forced apart. Taking
  out a knife, he slipped the thin blade into the aperture. There was a click
  and the cover sprang up like the lid of a box.</p>

  <p>"And this, I think, is what we are looking for," said Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>The interior of the book had been hollowed out, the edges being left were
  gummed tight, and the receptacle thus formed was packed close with brown
  papers; brown, except for one, which was written on a large sheet of
  foolscap, headed:</p>

  <p>"Bureau of the Ministry of Colonies, Lisbon."</p>

  <p>Barberton had superimposed upon this long document his Braille writing,
  and now one of the mysteries was cleared up.</p>

  <p>"Lee said he had never received any important documents," said Manfred,
  "and, of course, he hadn't, so far as he knew. To him this was merely a sheet
  of paper on which Braille characters were inscribed. Read this, Leon."</p>

  <p>Leon scanned the letter. It was dated "July 21st, 1912," and bore, in the
  lower left-hand corner, the seal of the Portuguese Colonial Office. He read
  it through rapidly and at the end looked up with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"And this settles Oberzohn and Co., and robs them of a fortune, the extent
  of which I think we shall discover when we read Barberton's letter."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette and scanned the writing again, whilst Meadows, who did
  not understand Leon's passion for drama, waited with proving impatience.</p>

  <p>"Illustrious Senhor," began Leon, reading. "I have this day had the honour
  of placing before His Excellency the President, and the Ministers of the
  Cabinet, your letter dated May 15th, 1912. By a letter dated January 8th,
  1911, the lands marked Ex. 275 on the Survey Map of the Biskara district were
  conceded to you, Illustrious Senhor, in order to further the cause of
  science&mdash;a cause which is very dear to the heart of His Excellency the
  President. Your further letter, in which you complain, Illustrious Senhor,
  that the incursion of prospectors upon our land is hampering your scientific
  work, and your request that an end may be put to these annoyances by the
  granting to you of an extension of the concession, so as to give you title to
  all mineral found in the aforesaid area, Ex. 275 on the Survey Map of
  Biskara, and thus making the intrusion of prospectors illegal, has been
  considered by the Council, and the extending concession is hereby granted, on
  the following conditions: The term of the concession shall be for twelve
  years, as from the 14th day of June, 1912, and shall be renewable by you,
  your heirs or nominees, every twelfth year, on payment of a nominal sum of
  1,000 milreis. In the event of the concessionaire, his heirs or nominees,
  failing to apply for a renewal on the 14th day of June, 1924, the mineral
  rights of the said area, Ex. 275 on the Survey Map of Biskara, shall be open
  to claim in accordance with the laws of Angola&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Leon sat back.</p>

  <p>"Fourteenth of June?" he said, and looked up. "Why, that is next
  week&mdash;five days! We've cut it rather fine, George."</p>

  <p>"Barberton said there were six weeks," said Manfred. "Obviously he made
  the mistake of timing the concession from July 21st&mdash;the date of the
  letter. He must have been the most honest man in the world; there was no
  other reason why he should have communicated with Miss Leicester. He could
  have kept quiet and claimed the rights for himself. Go on Leon."</p>

  <p>"That is about all," said Leon, glancing at the tail of the letter. "The
  rest is more or less flowery and complimentary and has reference to the
  scientific work in which Professor Leicester was engaged. Five
  days&mdash;phew!" he whistled.</p>

  <p>"We may now find something in Barberton's long narrative to give us an
  idea of the value of this property." Manfred turned the numerous pages. "Do
  any of you gentlemen write shorthand?"</p>

  <p>Meadows went out into the hall and brought back an officer. Waiting until
  he had found pencil and paper, Leon began the extraordinary story of William
  Barberton&mdash;most extraordinary because every word had been patiently and
  industrially punched in the Braille characters.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap18"
     id="chap18">XVIII. THE STORY OF MONT D'OR</a></h2>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Friend Johnny,</p>

  <p class="letter">"I have such a lot to tell you that I hardly know where to
  begin. I've struck rich at last, and the dream I've often talked over with
  you has come true. First of all, let me tell you that I have come upon nearly
  £50,000 worth of wrought gold. We've been troubled round here with lions, one
  of which took away a carrier of mine, and at last I decided to go out and
  settle accounts with this fellow. I found him six miles from the camp and
  planted a couple of bullets into him without killing him, and decided to
  follow up his spoor. It was a mad thing to do, trailing a wounded lion in the
  jungle, and I didn't realize how mad until we got out of the bush into the
  hills and I found Mrs. Lion waiting for me. She nearly got me too. More by
  accident than anything else, I managed to shoot her dead at the first shot,
  and got another pot at her husband as he was slinking into a cave which was
  near our tent.</p>

  <p class="letter">"As I had gone so far, I thought I might as well go the
  whole hog, especially as I'd seen two lion cubs playing around the mouth of
  the cave, and bringing up my boys, who were scared to death, I crawled in, to
  find, as I expected, that the old lion was nearly gone, and a shot finished
  him. I had to kill the cubs: they were too young to be left alone, and too
  much of a nuisance to bring back to camp. This cave had been used as a lair
  years; it was full of bones, human amongst them.</p>

  <p class="letter">"But what struck me was the appearance of the roof, which,
  I was almost certain, had been cut out by hand. It was like a house, and
  there was a cut door in the rock at the back. I made a torch and went through
  on a tour of inspection, and you can imagine my surprise when I found myself
  in a little room with a line of stone niches or shelves. There were three
  lines on each side. Standing on these at intervals there were little
  statuettes. They were so covered with dust that I thought they were stone,
  until I tried to take one down to examine it; then I knew by its weight that
  it was gold, as they all were.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I didn't want my boys to know about my find, because they
  are a treacherous lot, so I took the lightest, after weighing them all with a
  spring balance, and made a note where I'd taken it from. You might think that
  was enough of a find for one man in a lifetime, but my luck had set in. I
  sent the boys back and ordered them to break camp and join me on top of the
  Thaba. I called it the Thaba, because it is rather like a hill I know in
  Basutoland, and is one of two.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The camp was moved up that night; it was a better pitch
  than any we had had. There was water, plenty of small game, and no
  mosquitoes. The worst part of it was the terrific thunderstorms which come up
  from nowhere, and until you've seen one in this ironstone country you don't
  know what a thunderstorm is like! The hill opposite vas slightly smaller than
  the one I had taken as a camp, and between was a shallow valley, through
  which ran a small shallow river&mdash;rapids would be a better word.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Early the next morning I was looking round through my
  glasses, and saw what I thought was a house on the opposite hill. I asked my
  head-man who lived there, and he told me that it was once the house of the
  Star Chief; and I remembered that somebody told me, down in Mossamedes, that
  an astronomer had settled in this neighbourhood and had been murdered by the
  natives. I thought I would go over and have a look at the place. The day
  being cloudy and not too hot, I took my gun and a couple of boys and we
  crossed the river and began climbing the hill. The house was, of course, in
  ruins; it had only been a wattle hut at the best of times. Part of it was
  covered with vegetation, but out of curiosity I searched round, hoping to
  pick up a few things that might be useful to me, more particularly kettles,
  for my boys had burnt holes in every one I had. I found a kettle, and then,
  turning over a heap of rubbish which I think must have been his bed, I found
  a little rusty tin box and broke it open with my stick. There were a few
  letters which were so faded that I could only read a word here and there, and
  in a green oilskin, a long letter from the Portuguese Government."</p>

  <p>(It was at this point, either by coincidence or design, that the narrative
  continued on the actual paper to which he referred.)</p>

  <p class="letter">"I speak Portuguese and can read it as easily as English,
  and the only thing that worried me about it was that the concession gave
  Professor Leicester all rights to my cave. My first idea was to burn it, but
  then I began to realize what a scoundrelly business that would be, and I took
  the letters out into the sun and tried to find if he had any relations,
  hoping that I'd be able to fix it up with them to take at any rate 50 per
  cent. of my find. There was only one letter that helped me. It was written in
  a child's hand and was evidently from his daughter. It had no address, but
  there was the name&mdash;'Mirabelle Leicester.'</p>

  <p class="letter">"I put it in my pocket with the concession and went on
  searching, but found nothing more. I was going down the hill towards the
  valley when it struck me that perhaps this man had found gold, and the excuse
  for getting the concession was a bit of artfulness. I sent a boy back to the
  camp for a pick, a hammer and a spade, and when he returned I began to make a
  cutting in the side of the hill. There was nothing to guide me&mdash;no
  outcrop, such as you usually find near a true reef&mdash;but I hadn't been
  digging for an hour before I struck the richest bed of conglomerate I've ever
  seen. I was either dreaming, or my good angel had at last led me to the one
  place in the hill where gold could be found. I had previously sent the boys
  back to camp and told them to wait for me, because, if I did strike metal, I
  did not want the fact advertised all over Angola, where they've been looking
  for gold for years.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Understand, it was not a reef in the ordinary sense of the
  word, it was all conglomerate, and the wider I made my cutting, the wider the
  bed appeared, I took the pick to another part of the hill and dug again, with
  the same result&mdash;conglomerate. It was as though nature had thrown up a
  huge golden hump in the earth. I covered both cuttings late that night and
  went back to camp. (I was stalked by a leopard in the low bush, but managed
  to get him.)</p>

  <p class="letter">"Early next morning, I started off and tried another spot,
  and with the same result; first three feet of earth, then about six inches of
  shale, and then conglomerate. I tried to work through the bed, thinking that
  it might be just a skin, but I was saved much exertion by coming upon a deep
  rift in the hill about twenty feet wide at the top and tapering down to about
  fifty feet below the ground level. This gave me a section to work on, and as
  near as I can judge, the conglomerate bed is something over fifty feet thick
  and I'm not so sure that it doesn't occur again after an interval of twenty
  feet or more, for I dug more shale and had a showing of conglomerate at the
  very bottom of the ravine.</p>

  <p class="letter">"What does this mean, Johnny? It means that we have found a
  hill of gold; not solid gold, as in the storybooks, but gold that pays ounces
  and probably pounds to the ton. How the prospectors have missed it all these
  years I can't understand, unless it is that they've made their cuttings on
  the north side of the hill, where they have found nothing but slate and
  sandstone. The little river in the valley must be feet deep in alluvial, for
  I panned the bed and got eight ounces of pure gold in an hour&mdash;and that
  was by rough-and-ready methods. I had to be careful not to make the boys too
  curious, and I am breaking camp to-morrow, and I want you to cable or send me
  £500 to Mossamedes. The statuette I'm bringing home is worth all that. I
  would bring more, only I can't trust these Angola boys; a lot of them are
  mission boys and can read Portuguese, and they're too friendly with a
  half-breed called Villa, who is an agent of Oberzohn &amp; Smitts; the
  traders and I know these people to be the most unscrupulous scoundrels on the
  coast.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I shall be at Mossamedes about three weeks after you get
  this letter, but I don't want to get back to the coast in a hurry, otherwise
  people are going to suspect I have made a strike."</p>

  <p>Leon put the letter down.</p>

  <p>"There is the story in a nutshell, gentlemen," he said. "I don't, for one
  moment, believe that Mr. Barberton showed Villa the letter. It is more likely
  that one of the educated natives he speaks about saw it and reported it to
  Oberzohn's agent. Portuguese is the lingua franca of that part of the coast.
  Barberton was killed to prevent his meeting the girl and telling her of his
  find&mdash;incidentally, of warning her to apply for a renewal of the
  concession. It wasn't even necessary that they should search his belongings
  to recover the letter, because once they knew of its existence and the date
  which Barberton had apparently confounded with the date the letter was
  written, their work was simply to present an application to the Colonial
  Office at Lisbon. It was quite different after Barberton was killed, when
  they learnt or guessed that the letter was in Mr. Lee's possession."</p>

  <p>Meadows agreed.</p>

  <p>"That was the idea behind Oberzohn's engagement of Mirabelle
  Leicester?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly, and it was also behind the attack upon Heavytree Farm. To secure
  this property they must get her away and keep her hidden either until it is
  too late for her to apply for a renewal, or until she has been bullied or
  forced into appointing a nominee."</p>

  <p>"Or married," said Leon briskly. "Did that idea occur to you? Our
  tailor-made friend, Monty Newton, may have had matrimonial intentions. It
  would have been quite a good stroke of business to secure a wife and a large
  and auriferous hill at the same time. This, I think, puts a period to the
  ambitions of Herr Doktor Oberzohn."</p>

  <p>He got up from the table and handed the papers to the custody of the
  detective, and turned with a quizzical smile to his friend.</p>

  <p>"George, do you look forward with any pleasure to a two hundred and fifty
  miles' drive?"</p>

  <p>"Are you the chauffeur?" asked George.</p>

  <p>"I am the chauffeur," said Leon cheerfully. "I have driven a car for many
  years and I have not been killed yet. It is unlikely that I shall risk my
  precious life and yours to-night. Come with me and I promise never to hit her
  up above sixty except on the real speedways."</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>"We will stop at Oxley and try to get a 'phone call through to
  Gloucester," said Leon. "This line is, of course, out of order. They would do
  nothing so stupid as to neglect the elementary precaution of disconnecting
  Rath Hall."</p>

  <p>At Oxley the big Spanz pulled up before the dark and silent exterior of
  the inn, and Leon, getting down, brought the half-clad landlord to the door
  and explained his mission, and also learned that two big cars had passed
  through half an hour before, going in the direction of London.</p>

  <p>"That was the gang. I wonder how they'll explain to their paymaster their
  second failure?"</p>

  <p>His first call was to the house in Curzon Street, but there was no reply.
  "Ring them again," said Leon. "You left Poiccart there?"</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>They waited for five minutes; still there was no reply.</p>

  <p>"How queer!" said Manfred. "It isn't like Poiccart to leave the house. Get
  Gloucester."</p>

  <p>At this hour of the night the lines are comparatively clear, and in a very
  short time he heard the Gloucester operator's voice, and a few seconds later
  the click that told them they were connected with Heavytree Farm. Here there
  was some delay before the call was answered.</p>

  <p>It was not Mirabelle Leicester nor her aunt who spoke. Nor did he
  recognize the voice of Digby, who had recovered sufficiently to return to
  duty.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" asked the voice sharply. "Is that you, sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"No, it is Mr. Meadows," said Leon mendaciously.</p>

  <p>"The Scotland Yard gentleman?" It was an eager inquiry.</p>

  <p>"I'm Constable Kirk, of the Gloucester Police. My sergeant's been trying
  to get in touch with you, sir."</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" asked Leon, a cold feeling at his heart.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir. About half an hour ago, I was riding past
  here&mdash;I'm one of the mounted men&mdash;and I saw the door wide open and
  all the lights on, and when I came in there was nobody up. I woke Miss
  Goddard and Mr. Digby, but the young lady was not in the house."</p>

  <p>"Lights everywhere?" asked Leon quickly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;in the parlour at any rate."</p>

  <p>"No sign of a struggle?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; but a car passed me three miles from the house and it was going
  at a tremendous rate. I think she may have been in that. Mr. Digby and Miss
  Goddard have just gone into Gloucester."</p>

  <p>"All right, officer. I am sending Mr. Gonsalez down to see you," said
  Leon, and hung up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked George Manfred, who knew that something was wrong by
  his friend's face.</p>

  <p>"They've got Mirabelle Leicester after all," said Leon. "I'm afraid I
  shall have to break my promise to you, George. That machine of mine is going
  to travel before daybreak!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap19"
     id="chap19">XIX.&mdash;AT HEAVYTREE FARM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT had been agreed that, having failed in their attack, and
  their energies for the moment being directed to Rath Hall, an immediate
  return of the Old Guard to Heavytree Farm was unlikely. This had been
  Meadows' view, and Leon and his friend were of the same mind. Only Poiccart,
  that master strategist, working surely with a queer knowledge of his enemies'
  psychology, had demurred from this reasoning; but as he had not insisted upon
  his point of view, Heavytree Farm and its occupants had been left to the care
  of the local police and the shaken Digby.</p>

  <p>Aunt Alma offered to give up her room to the wounded man, but he would not
  hear of this, and took the spare bedroom, an excellent position for a
  defender, since it separated Mirabelle's apartment from the pretty little
  room which Aunt Alma used as a study and sleeping-place.</p>

  <p>The staff of Heavytree Farm consisted of an ancient cowman, a cook and a
  maid, the latter of whom had already given notice and left on the afternoon
  of the attack. She had, as she told Mirabelle in all seriousness, a weak
  heart.</p>

  <p>"And a weak head too!" snapped Alma. "I should not worry about your heart,
  my girl, if I were you."</p>

  <p>"I was top of my class at school," bridled the maid, touched to the raw by
  this reflection upon her intelligence.</p>

  <p>"It must have been a pretty small class," retorted Alma.</p>

  <p>A new maid had been found, a girl who had been thrilled by the likelihood
  that the humdrum of daily labour would be relieved by exciting events out of
  the ordinary, and before evening the household had settled down to normality.
  Mirabelle was feeling the reaction and went to bed early that night, waking
  as the first slant of sunlight poured through her window. She got up,
  feeling, she told herself, as well as she had felt in her life. Pulling back
  the chintz curtains, she looked out upon a still world with a sense of
  happiness and relief beyond measure. There was nobody in sight. Pools of mist
  lay in the hollows, and from one white farmstead, far away on the slope of
  the hill, she saw the blue smoke was rising. It was a morning to remember,
  and, to catch its spirit the better, she dressed hastily and went down into
  the garden. As she walked along the path she heard a window pulled open and
  the bandaged head of Mr. Digby appeared.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you, is it, miss?" he said with relief, and she laughed.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing more terrible in sight than a big spider," she said, and
  pointed to a big flat fellow, who was already spinning his web between the
  tall hollyhocks. And the first of the bees was abroad.</p>

  <p>"If anybody had come last night I shouldn't have heard them," he
  confessed. "I slept like a dead man." He touched his head gingerly. "It
  smarts, but the ache is gone," he said, not loth to discuss his infirmities.
  "The doctor said I had a narrow escape; he thought there was a fracture.
  Would you like me to make some tea, miss, or shall I call the servant?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, but he had already disappeared, and came seeking her
  in the garden ten minutes later, with a cup of tea in his hand. He told her
  for the second time that he was a police pensioner and had been in the employ
  of Gonsalez for three years. The Three paid well, and had, she learned to her
  surprise, considerable private resources.</p>

  <p>"Does it pay them&mdash;this private detective business?"</p>

  <p>"Lord bless your heart, no, miss!" He scoffed at the idea. "They are very
  rich men. I thought everybody knew that. They say Mr. Gonsalez was worth a
  million even before the war."</p>

  <p>This was astonishing news.</p>

  <p>"But why do they do this"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"this sort of
  thing?"</p>

  <p>"It is a hobby, miss," said the man vaguely. "Some people run race-horses,
  some own yachts&mdash;these gentlemen get a lot of pleasure out of their work
  and they pay well," he added.</p>

  <p>Men in the regular employ of the Three Just Men not only received a good
  wage, but frequently a bonus which could only be described as colossal. Once,
  after they had rounded up and destroyed a gang of Spanish bank robbers, they
  had distributed £1,000 to every man who was actively employed. He hinted
  rather than stated that this money had formed part of the loot which the
  Three had recovered, and did not seem to think that there was anything
  improper in this distribution of illicit gains.</p>

  <p>"After all, miss," he said philosophically, "when you collect money like
  that, it's impossible to give it back to the people it came from. This Diego
  had been holding up banks for years, and banks are not like people&mdash;they
  don't feel the loss of money."</p>

  <p>"That's a thoroughly immoral view," said Mirabelle, intent upon her
  flower-picking.</p>

  <p>"It may be, miss," agreed Digby, who had evidently been one of the
  recipients of bounty, and took a complacent and a tolerant view. "But a
  thousand pounds is a lot of money."</p>

  <p>The day passed without event. From the early evening papers that came from
  Gloucester she learned of the fire at Oberzohn's, and did not connect the
  disaster with anything but an accident. She was not sorry. The fire had
  licked out one ugly from the past. Incidentally it had destroyed a crude
  painting which was to Dr. Oberzohn more precious than any that Leonardo had
  painted or Raphael conceived, but this she did not know.</p>

  <p>It was just before the dinner hour that there came the first unusual
  incident of the day. Mirabelle was standing by the garden gate, intent upon
  the glories of the evening sky, which was piled high with red and
  slate-coloured cumuli. The glass was falling and a wet night was promised.
  But the loveliness of that lavish colouring held her. And then she became
  dimly aware that a man was coming towards the house from the direction of
  Gloucester. He walked in the middle of the road slowly, as though he, too,
  were admiring the view and there was no need to hurry. His hands were behind
  him, his soft felt hat at the back of his head. A stocky-looking man, but his
  face was curiously familiar. He turned his unsmiling eyes in her direction,
  and, looking again at his strong features, at the tiny grey-black moustache
  under his aquiline nose, she was certain she had seen him before. Perhaps she
  had passed him in the street, and had retained a subconscious mental picture
  of him.</p>

  <p>He slowed his step until, when he came abreast of her, he stopped.</p>

  <p>"This is Heavytree Lane?" he asked, in a deep musical voice.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;the lane is the first break in the hedge," she smiled. "I'm
  afraid it isn't much of a road&mdash;generally it is ankle-deep in mud."</p>

  <p>He looked past her to the house; his eyes ranged the windows, dropped for
  a moment upon a climbing clematis, and came back to her.</p>

  <p>"I don't know Gloucestershire very well," he said, and added: "You have a
  very nice house."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said in surprise.</p>

  <p>"And a garden." And then, innocently: "Do you grow onions?"</p>

  <p>She stared at him and laughed.</p>

  <p>"I think we do&mdash;I am not sure. My aunt looks after the kitchen
  garden."</p>

  <p>His sad eyes wandered over the house again.</p>

  <p>"It is a very nice place," he said, and, lifting his hat, went on.</p>

  <p>Digby was out: he had gone for a gentle walk, and, looking up the road
  after the stranger, she saw the guard appear round a bend in the road, and
  saw him stop and speak to the stranger. Apparently they knew one another, for
  they shook hands at meeting, and after a while Digby pointed down the road to
  where she was standing, and she saw the man nod. Soon after the stranger went
  out of view. Who could he be? Was it an additional guard that the three men
  had put to protect her? When Digby came up to her, she asked him. "That
  gentleman, miss? He is Mr. Poiccart."</p>

  <p>"Poiccart?" she said, delighted. "Oh, I wish I had known!"</p>

  <p>"I was surprised to see him," said the guard. "As a matter of fact, he's
  the one of the three gentlemen I've met the most. He's generally in Curzon
  Street, even when the others are away."</p>

  <p>Digby had nothing to say about Poiccart except that he was a very quiet
  gentleman and took no active part in the operations of the Three Just
  Men.</p>

  <p>"I wonder why he wanted to know about onions?" asked the girl
  thoughtfully. "That sounded awfully mysterious."</p>

  <p>It would not have been so mysterious to Leon.</p>

  <p>The house retired to bed soon after ten, Alma going the rounds, and
  examining the new bolts and locks which had been attached that morning to
  every door which gave ingress to the house.</p>

  <p>Mirabelle was unaccountably tired, and was asleep almost as soon as her
  head touched the pillow.</p>

  <p>She heard in her dreams the swish of the rain beating against her window,
  lay for a long time trying to energise herself to rise and shut the one open
  window where the curtains were blowing in. Then came the heavier patter
  against a closed pane, and something rattled on the floor of her room. She
  sat up. It could not be hail, although there was a rumble of thunder in the
  distance.</p>

  <p>She got out of bed, pulled on her dressing-gown, went to the window, and
  had all her work to stifle a scream. Somebody was standing on the path
  below... a woman! She leaned out.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is me&mdash;I&mdash;Joan!" There was a sob in the voice of the girl.
  Even in that light Mirabelle could see that the girl was drenched. "Don't
  wake anybody. Come down&mdash;I want you."</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?" asked Mirabelle in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Everything... everything!"</p>

  <p>She was on the verge of hysteria. Mirabelle lit a candle and crossed the
  room, went downstairs softly, so that Alma should not be disturbed. Putting
  the candle on the table, she unbarred and unbolted the door, opened it, and
  as she did so, a man slipped through the half-opened door, his big hands
  smothering the scream that rose to her lips.</p>

  <p>Another man followed and, lifting the struggling girl, carried her into
  the drawing-room. One of the men took a small iron bottle from his pocket, to
  which ran a flexible rubber tube ending in a large red cap. Her captor
  removed his hands just as long as it took to fix the cap over her face. A
  tiny faucet was turned. Mirabelle felt a puff on her face, a strangely sweet
  taste, and then her heart began to beat thunderously. She thought she was
  dying, and writhed desperately to free herself.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>"She's all right," said Monty Newton, lifting an eyelid for a second. "Get
  a blanket." He turned fiercely to the whimpering girl behind him. "Shut up,
  you!" he said savagely. "Do you want to rouse the whole house?"</p>

  <p>A woebegone Joan was whimpering softly, tears running down her face, her
  hands clasping and unclasping in the agony of her mind.</p>

  <p>"You told me you weren't going to hurt her!" she sobbed.</p>

  <p>"Get out," he hissed, and pointed to the door. She went meekly.</p>

  <p>A heavy blanket was wrapped round the unconscious girl, and, lifting her
  between them, the two men went out into the rain, where the old trolley was
  waiting, and slid her along the straw-covered floor. In another second the
  trolley moved off, gathering speed.</p>

  <p>By this time the effect of the gas had worn off and Mirabelle had regained
  consciousness. She put out a hand and touched a woman's knee. "Who is
  that&mdash;Alma?"</p>

  <p>"No," said a miserable voice, "it's Joan."</p>

  <p>"Joan? Oh, yes, of course... why did you do it?&mdash;how wicked!"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" Monty snarled. "Wait until you get to&mdash;where you're going
  before you start these 'whys' and 'wherefores.'"</p>

  <p>Mirabelle was deathly sick and bemused, and for the next hour she was too
  ill to feel even alarmed. Her head was going round and round, and ached
  terribly, and the jolting of the truck did not improve matters in this
  respect.</p>

  <p>Monty, who was sitting with his back to the truck's side, was smoking. He
  cursed now and then, as some unusually heavy jolt flung him forward. They
  passed through the heart of the storm: the flicker of lightning was almost
  incessant and the thunder was deafening. Rain was streaming down the hood of
  the trolley, rendering it like a drum.</p>

  <p>Mirabelle fell into a sleep and woke feeling better. It was still dark,
  and she would not have known the direction they were taking, only the driver
  took the wrong turning coming through a country town, and by the help of the
  lightning she saw what was indubitably the stand of a race-track, and a
  little later saw the word "Newbury." They were going towards London, she
  realized.</p>

  <p>At this hour of the morning there was little or no traffic, and when they
  turned on to the new Great West Road a big car went whizzing past at seventy
  miles an hour and the roar of it woke the girl. Now she could feel the
  trolley wheels skidding on tram-lines. Lights appeared with greater
  frequency. She saw a store window brilliantly illuminated, the night watchman
  having evidently forgotten to turn off the lights at the appointed hour.</p>

  <p>Soon they were crossing the Thames. She saw the red and green lights of a
  tug, and black upon near black a string of barges in mid-stream. She dozed
  again and was jerked wide awake when the trolley swayed and skidded over a
  surface more uneven than any. Once its wheels went into a pothole and she was
  flung violently against the side. Another time it skidded and was brought up
  with a crash against some obstacle. The bumping grew more gentle, and then
  the machine stopped, and Monty jumped down and called to her sharply.</p>

  <p>Her head was clear now, despite its throbbing. She saw a queer-shaped
  house, all gables and turrets, extraordinarily narrow for its height. It
  seemed to stand in the middle of a field. And yet it was in London: she could
  see the glow of furnace fires and hear the deep boom of a ship's siren as it
  made its way down the river on the tide.</p>

  <p>She had not time to take observations, for Monty fastened to her arm and
  she squelched through the mud up a flight of stone steps into a dimly lit
  hall. She had a confused idea that she had seen little dogs standing on the
  side of the steps, and a big bird with a long bill, but these probably
  belonged to the smoke dreams which the gas had left.</p>

  <p>Monty opened a door and pushed her in before him, and she stared into the
  face of Dr. Oberzohn.</p>

  <p>He wore a black velvet dressing-gown that had once been a regal garment
  but was now greasy and stained. On his egg-shaped head he had an embroidered
  smoking-cap. His feet were encased in warm velvet slippers. He put down the
  book he had been reading, rubbed his glasses on one velvet sleeve, and
  then:</p>

  <p>"So!" he said.</p>

  <p>He pointed to the remains of a fire.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mirabelle Leicester, and warm yourself. You have come quickly,
  my friend."&mdash;he addressed Monty.</p>

  <p>"I'm black and blue all over," growled Newton. "Why couldn't we have a
  car?"</p>

  <p>"Because the cars were engaged, as I told you."</p>

  <p>"Did you&mdash;" began Newton quickly, but the old man glanced
  significantly at the girl, shivering before the fire and warming her hands
  mechanically.</p>

  <p>"I will answer, but you need not ask, in good time. This is not of all
  moments the most propitious. Where is your woman?"</p>

  <p>He had forgotten Joan, and went out to find her shivering in the
  passage.</p>

  <p>"Do you want her?" he asked, poking his head in the door.</p>

  <p>"She shall go with this girl. You will explain."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going to put her?"</p>

  <p>Oberzohn pointed to the floor.</p>

  <p>"Here? But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no. My friend, you are too quick to see what is not meant. The
  gracious lady shall live in a palace&mdash;I have a certain friend who will
  no longer need it."</p>

  <p>His face twitched in the nearest he ever approached to a smile. Groping
  under the table, he produced a pair of muddy Wellingtons, kicked off his
  slippers and pulled on the boots with many gasps and jerks.</p>

  <p>"All that they need is there: I have seen to it. March!"</p>

  <p>He led the way out of the room, pulling the girl to her feet, and Newton
  followed, Joan bringing up the rear. Inside the factory, Oberzohn produced a
  small hand torch from his pocket and guided them through the debris till he
  came to that part of the floor where the trap was. With his foot he moved the
  covering of rubbish, pulled up the trap and went down.</p>

  <p>"I can't go down there, Monty, I can't!" said Joan's agitated voice. "What
  are you going to do with us? My God! if I'd known&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," said Newton roughly. "What have you got to be afraid
  of? There's nothing here. We want you to look after her for a day or two. You
  don't want her to go down by herself: she'd be frightened to death."</p>

  <p>Her teeth chattering, Joan stumbled down the steps behind him. Certainly
  the first view of her new quarters was reassuring. Two little trestle beds
  had been made; the underground room had been swept clean, and a new carpet
  laid on the floor. Moreover, the apartment was brilliantly lit, and a furnace
  gave almost an uncomfortable warmth which was nevertheless very welcome, for
  the temperature had dropped 20° since noon.</p>

  <p>"In this box there are clothes of all varieties, and expensive to
  purchase," said Oberzohn, pointing to a brand-new trunk at the foot of one of
  the beds. "Food you will have in plenty&mdash;bread and milk newly every day.
  By night you shall keep the curtain over the ventilator." On the wall was a
  small black curtain about ten inches square.</p>

  <p>Monty took her into the next apartment and showed her the wash-place.
  There was even a bath, a compulsory fixture under the English Factory Act in
  a store of this description, where, in the old days, men had to handle
  certain insanitary products of the Coast.</p>

  <p>"But how do we get out, Monty? Where do we get exercise?"</p>

  <p>"You'll come out to-morrow night: I'll see to that," he said, dropping his
  voice. "Now listen, Joan: you've got to be a sensible girl and help me.
  There's money in this&mdash;bigger money than you've ever dreamed of. And
  when we've got this unpleasant business over, I'm taking you away for a trip
  round the world."</p>

  <p>It was the old promise, given before, never fulfilled, always hoped for.
  But this time it did not wholly remove her uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"But what are you going to do with the girl?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing; she will be kept here for a week. I'll swear to you that nothing
  will happen to her. At the end of a week she's to be released without a hair
  of her head being harmed."</p>

  <p>She looked at him searchingly. As far as she was able to judge, he was
  speaking the truth. And yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it"&mdash;she shook her head, and for once Monty
  Newton was patient with her.</p>

  <p>"She's the owner of a big property in Africa, and that we shall get, if
  things work out right," he said. "The point is that she must claim within a
  few days. If she doesn't, the property is ours."</p>

  <p>Her face cleared.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" She believed him, knew him well enough to detect his rare
  sincerity. "That's taken a load off my mind, Monty. Of course I'll stay and
  look after her for you&mdash;it makes it easier to know that nothing will
  happen. What are those baize things behind the furnace&mdash;they look like
  boxes?"</p>

  <p>He turned on her quickly.</p>

  <p>"I was going to tell you about those," he said. "You're not to touch them
  under any circumstances. They belong to the old man and he's very stuffy
  about such things. Leave them just as they are. Let him touch them and nobody
  else. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and, to his surprise, pecked his cheek with her cold lips.</p>

  <p>"I'll help you, boy," she said tremulously. "Maybe that trip will come off
  after all, if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If what?"</p>

  <p>"Those men&mdash;the men you were talking about&mdash;the Four Just Men,
  don't they call themselves? They scare me sick, Monty! They were the people
  who took her away before, and they'll kill us&mdash;even Oberzohn says that.
  They're after him. Has he"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"has he killed anybody?
  That snake stuff... you're not in it, are you, Monty?"</p>

  <p>She looked more like a child than a sophisticated woman, clinging to his
  arm, her blue eyes looking pleadingly into his.</p>

  <p>"Stuff! What do I know about snakes?" He disengaged himself and came back
  to where Oberzohn was waiting, a figure of patience.</p>

  <p>The girl was lying on the bed, her face in the crook of her arm, and he
  was gazing at her, his expression inscrutable.</p>

  <p>"That is all, then. Good night, gracious ladies."</p>

  <p>He turned and marched back towards the step and waved his hand. Monty
  followed. The girl heard the thud of the trap fall, the scrape of the old
  man's boots, and then a rumbling sound, which she did not immediately
  understand. Later, when in a panic she tried the trap, she found that a heavy
  barrel had been put on top, and that it was immovable.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap20"
     id="chap20">XX.&mdash;GURTHER REPORTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DR. OBERZOHN had not been to bed for thirty-five years. It
  was his practice to sleep in a chair, and alternate his dozes with copious
  draughts from his favourite authors. Mostly the books were about the soul,
  and free will, and predestination, with an occasional dip into Nietzsche by
  way of light recreation. In ordinary circumstances he would have had need for
  all the philosophy he could master; for ruin had come. The destruction of his
  store, which, to all intents and purposes, was uninsured, would have been the
  crowning stroke of fate but for the golden vision ahead.</p>

  <p>Villa, that handsome half-breed, had arrived in England and had been with
  the doctor all the evening. At that moment he was on his way to Liverpool to
  catch the Coast boat, and he had left with his master a record of the claims
  that had already been pegged out on Monto Doro, as he so picturesquely
  renamed the new mountain. There were millions there; uncountable wealth. And
  between the Herr Doktor and the achievement of this colossal fortune was a
  life which he had no immediate desire to take. The doctor was a bachelor;
  women bored him. Yet he was prepared to take the extreme step if by so doing
  he could doubly ensure his fortune. Mirabelle dead gave him one chance;
  Mirabelle alive and persuaded, multiplied that chance by a hundred.</p>

  <p>He opened the book he was reading at the last page and took out the folded
  paper. It was a special licence to marry, and had been duly registered at the
  Greenwich Registrar's Office since the day before the girl had entered his
  employment. This was his second and most powerful weapon. He could have been
  legally married on this nearly a week ago. It was effective for two months at
  least, and only five days separated him from the necessity of a decision. If
  the time expired, Mirabelle could live. It was quite a different matter,
  killing in cold blood a woman for whom the police would be searching, and
  with whose disappearance his name would be connected, from that other form of
  slaying he favoured: the striking down of strange men in crowded
  thoroughfares. She was not for the snake&mdash;as yet.</p>

  <p>He folded the paper carefully, put it back in the book and turned the
  page, when there was a gentle tap at the door and he sat up.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Pfeiffer. March!"</p>

  <p>The door opened slowly and a man sidled into the room, and at the sight of
  him Dr. Oberzohn gasped.</p>

  <p>"Gurther!" he stammered, for once thrown out of his stride.</p>

  <p>Gurther smiled and nodded, his round eyes fixed on the tassel of the Herr
  Doktor's smoking-cap.</p>

  <p>"You have returned&mdash;and failed?"</p>

  <p>"The American, I think, is dead, Herr Doktor," said the man in staccato
  tone. "The so excellent Pfeiffer is also&mdash;dead!"</p>

  <p>The doctor blinked twice.</p>

  <p>"Dead?" he said gratingly. "Who told you this?"</p>

  <p>"I saw him. Something happened... to the snake. Pfeiffer was bitten."</p>

  <p>The old man's hard eyes fixed him.</p>

  <p>"So!" he said softly.</p>

  <p>"He died very quickly&mdash;in the usual manner," jerked Gurther, still
  with that stupid smile.</p>

  <p>"So!" said the doctor again. "All then was failure, and out of it comes an
  American, who is nothing, and Pfeiffer, who is much&mdash;dead!"</p>

  <p>"God have him in His keeping!" said Gurther, not lowering or raising his
  eyes. "And all the way back I thought this, Herr Doktor&mdash;how much better
  that it should be Pfeiffer and not me. Though my nerves are so bad."</p>

  <p>"So!" said the doctor for the fourth time, and held out his hand.</p>

  <p>Gurther slipped his fingers into his waistcoat pocket and took out a gold
  cigarette-case. The doctor opened it and looked at the five cigarettes that
  reposed, at the two halves of the long holder neatly lying in their proper
  place, closed the case with a snap and laid it on the table.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do with you, Gurther? To-morrow the police will come and
  search this house."</p>

  <p>"There is the cellar, Herr Doktor: it is very comfortable there. I would
  prefer it."</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn made a gesture like a boy wiping something from a slate.</p>

  <p>"That is not possible: it is in occupation," he said. "I must find a new
  place for you." He stared and mused. "There is the boat," he said.</p>

  <p>Gurther's smile did not fade.</p>

  <p>The boat was a small barge, which had been drawn up into the private dock
  of the O.&amp;S. factory, and had been rotting there for years, the
  playing-ground of rats, the doss-house of the homeless. The doctor saw what
  was in the man's mind.</p>

  <p>"It may be comfortable. I will give you some gas to kill the rats, and it
  will only be for five-six days."</p>

  <p>"Ja, Herr Doktor."</p>

  <p>"For to-night you may sleep in the kitchen. One does not
  expect&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a thunderous knock on the outer door. The two men looked at one
  another, but still Gurther grinned.</p>

  <p>"I think it is the police," said the doctor calmly.</p>

  <p>He got to his feet, lifted the seat of a long hard-looking sofa,
  disclosing a deep cavity, and Gurther slipped in, and the seat was replaced.
  This done, the doctor waddled to the door and turned the key.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Inspector Meadows,"</p>

  <p>"May I come in?" said Meadows.</p>

  <p>Behind him were two police officers, one in uniform.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to see me? Certainly." He held the door cautiously open and
  only Meadows came in, and preceded the doctor into his study.</p>

  <p>"I want Mirabelle Leicester," said Meadows curtly. "She was abducted from
  her home in the early hours of this morning, and I have information that the
  car which took her away came to this house. There are tracks of wheels in the
  mud outside."</p>

  <p>"If there are car tracks, they are mine," said the doctor calmly. He
  enumerated the makes of machines he possessed. "There is another matter: as
  to cars having come here in the night, I have a sense of hearing, Mr.
  Inspector Meadows, and I have heard many cars in Hangman's Lane&mdash;but not
  in my ground. Also, I'm sure you have not come to tell me of abducted girls,
  but to disclose to me the miscreant who burnt my store. That is what I
  expected of you."</p>

  <p>"What you expect of me and what you will get will be entirely different
  propositions," said Meadows unpleasantly. "Now come across, Oberzohn! We know
  why you want this girl&mdash;the whole plot has been blown. You think you'll
  prevent her from making a claim on the Portuguese Government for the renewal
  of a concession granted in June, 1912, to her father."</p>

  <p>If Dr. Oberzohn was shocked to learn that his secret was out, he did not
  show it by his face. Not a muscle moved.</p>

  <p>"Of such matters I know nothing. It is a fantasy, a story of fairies. Yet
  it must be true, Mr. Inspector Meadows, if you say it. No: I think you are
  deceived by the criminals of Curzon Street, W. Men of blood and murder, with
  records that are infamous. You desire to search my house? It is your
  privilege." He waved his hand. "I do not ask you for the ticket of search.
  From basement to attic the house is yours."</p>

  <p>He was not surprised when Meadows took him at his word, and, going out
  into the hall, summoned his assistants. They visited each room separately,
  the old cook and the half-witted Danish girl accepting this visitation as a
  normal occurrence: they had every excuse to do so, for this was the second
  time in a fortnight that the house had been visited by the police.</p>

  <p>"Now I'll take a look at your room, if you don't mind," said Meadows.</p>

  <p>His quick eyes caught sight of the box ottoman against the wall, and the
  fact that the doctor was sitting thereon added to his suspicions.</p>

  <p>"I will look in here, if you please," he said.</p>

  <p>Oberzohn rose and the detective lifted the lid. It was empty. The ottoman
  had been placed against the wall, at the bottom of which was a deep recess.
  Gurther had long since rolled through the false back.</p>

  <p>"You see&mdash;nothing," said Oberzohn. "Now perhaps you would like to
  search my factory? Perhaps amongst the rafters and the burnt girders I may
  conceal a something. Or the barge in my slipway? Who knows what I may place
  amongst the rats?"</p>

  <p>"You're almost clever," said Meadows, "and I don't profess to be a match
  for you. But there are three men in this town who are! I'll be frank with
  you, Oberzohn. I want to put you where I can give you a fair trial, in
  accordance with the law of this country, and I shall resist, to the best of
  my ability, any man taking the law into his own hands. But whether you're
  innocent or guilty, I wouldn't stand in your shoes for all the money in
  Angola!"</p>

  <p>"So?" said the doctor politely.</p>

  <p>"Give up this girl, and I rather fancy that half your danger will be at an
  end. I tell you, you're too clever for me. It's a stupid thing for a police
  officer to say, but I can't get at the bottom of your snake. They have."</p>

  <p>The old man's brows worked up and down.</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" he said blandly. "And of which snake do you speak?"</p>

  <p>Meadows said nothing more. He had given his warning: if Oberzohn did not
  profit thereby, he would be the loser.</p>

  <p>Nobody doubted, least of all he, that, in defiance of all laws that man
  had made, independent of all the machinery of justice that human ingenuity
  had devised, inevitable punishment awaited Oberzohn and was near at hand.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap21"
     id="chap21">XXI.&mdash;THE ACCOUNT BOOK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was five o'clock in the morning when the mud-spattered
  Spanz dropped down through the mist and driving rain of the Chiltern Hills
  and struck the main Gloucester Road, pulling up with a jerk before Heavytree
  Farm. Manfred sprang out, but before he could reach the door, Aunt Alma had
  opened it, and by the look of her face he saw that she had not slept that
  night.</p>

  <p>"Where is Digby?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He's gone to interview the Chief Constable," said Alma. "Come in, Mr.
  Gonsalez."</p>

  <p>Leon was wet from head to foot: there was not a dry square centimetre upon
  him. But he was his old cheerful self as he stamped into the hall, shaking
  himself free of his heavy mackintosh.</p>

  <p>"Digby, of course, heard nothing, George."</p>

  <p>"I'm the lightest sleeper in the world," said Aunt Alma, "but I heard not
  a sound. The first thing I knew was when a policeman came up and knocked at
  my door and told me that he'd found the front door open."</p>

  <p>"No clue was left at all?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Aunt Alma. They went into the drawing-room and she took up
  from the table a small black bottle with a tube and cap attached. "I found
  this behind the sofa. She'd been lying on the sofa; the cushions were thrown
  on the floor and she tore the tapestry in her struggle."</p>

  <p>Leon turned the faucet, and, as the gas hissed out, sniffed.</p>

  <p>"The new dental gas," he said. "But how did they get in? No window was
  open or forced?"</p>

  <p>"They came in at the door: I'm sure of that. And they had a woman with
  them," said Aunt Alma proudly.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"There must have been a woman," said Aunt Alma. "Mirabelle would not have
  opened the door except to a woman, without waking either myself or Mr.
  Digby."</p>

  <p>Leon nodded, his eyes gleaming.</p>

  <p>"Obviously," he said.</p>

  <p>"And I found the marks of a woman's foot in the passage. It is dried now,
  but you can still see it."</p>

  <p>"I have already seen it," said Leon. "It is to the left of the door: a
  small pointed shoe and a rubber heel. Miss Leicester opened the door to the
  woman, the men came in, and the rest was easy. You can't blame Digby," he
  said appealingly to George.</p>

  <p>He was the friend at court of every agent, but this time Manfred did not
  argue with him.</p>

  <p>"I blame myself," he said. "Poiccart told me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He was here," said Aunt Alma.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;Poiccart? asked Manfred, surprised, and Gonsalez slapped his
  knee.</p>

  <p>"That's it, of course! What fools we are! We ought to have known why this
  wily old fox had left his post. What time was he here?"</p>

  <p>Alma told him all the circumstances of the visit.</p>

  <p>"He must have left the house immediately after us," said Leon, with a wide
  grin of amusement, "caught the five o'clock train for Gloucester, taxied
  across."</p>

  <p>"And after that?" suggested Manfred.</p>

  <p>Leon scratched his chin.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he's back?" He took up the telephone and put a trunk call
  through to London. "Somehow I don't think he is. Here's Digby, looking as if
  he expected to be summarily executed."</p>

  <p>The police pensioner was indeed in a mournful and pathetic mood.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you'll think of me, Mr. Manfred&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"I've already expressed a view on that subject." George smiled faintly.
  "I'm not blaming you, Digby. To leave a man who has been knocked about as you
  have been without an opposite number was the height of folly. I didn't expect
  them back so soon. As a matter of fact, I intended putting four men on from
  to-day. You've been making inquiries?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. The car went through Gloucester very early in the morning and
  took the Swindon road. It was seen by a cyclist policeman; he said there was
  a fat roll of tarpaulin lying on the tent of the trolley."</p>

  <p>"No sign of anybody chasing it in a car, or on a motor-bicycle?" asked
  Manfred anxiously.</p>

  <p>Poiccart had recently taken to motor-cycling.</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"You saw Mr. Poiccart?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he was just going back to London. He said he wanted to see the place
  with his own eyes."</p>

  <p>George was disappointed. If it had been a visit of curiosity, Poiccart's
  absence from town was understandable. He would not have returned at the hour
  he was rung up.</p>

  <p>Aunt Alma was cooking a hasty breakfast, and they had accepted her
  offering gratefully, for both men were famished; and they were in the midst
  of the meal when the London call came through.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Poiccart?"</p>

  <p>"That is I," said Poiccart's voice. "Where are you speaking from?"</p>

  <p>"Heavytree Farm. Did you see anything of Miss Leicester?"</p>

  <p>There was a pause.</p>

  <p>"Has she gone?"</p>

  <p>"You didn't know?"</p>

  <p>Another pause.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I knew; in fact, I accompanied her part of the way to London,
  and was bumped off when the trolley struck a refuge on the Great West Road.
  Meadows is here: he has just come from Oberzohn's. He says he has found
  nothing."</p>

  <p>Manfred thought for a while.</p>

  <p>"We will be back soon after nine," he said.</p>

  <p>"Leon driving you?" was the dry response.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;in spite of which we shall be back at nine."</p>

  <p>"That man has got a grudge against my driving," said Leon, when Manfred
  reported the conversation. "I knew it was he when Digby described the car and
  said there was a fat roll of mackintosh on the top. 'Fat roll' is not a bad
  description. Do you know whether Poiccart spoke to Miss Leicester?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he asked her if she grew onions."&mdash;a reply which sent Leon into
  fits of silent laughter.</p>

  <p>Breakfast was over and they were making their preparations for departure,
  when Leon asked unexpectedly: "Has Miss Leicester a writing-table of her
  own?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, in her room," said Alma, and took him up to show him the old
  bureau.</p>

  <p>He opened the drawers without apology, took out some old letters, turned
  them over, reading them shamelessly. Then he opened the blotter. There were
  several sheets of blank paper headed "Heavytree Farm," and two which bore her
  signature at the bottom. Alma explained that the bank account of the
  establishment was in Mirabelle's name, and, when it was necessary to draw
  cash, it was a rule of the bank that it should be accompanied by a covering
  letter&mdash;a practice which still exists in some of the old West-country
  banking establishments. She unlocked a drawer that he had not been able to
  open and showed him a cheque-book with three blank cheques signed with her
  name.</p>

  <p>"That banker has known me since I was so high," said Alma scornfully. "You
  wouldn't think there'd be so much red-tape."</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you keep any account books?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do," said Alma in surprise. "The household accounts, you
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"Could I see one?"</p>

  <p>She went out and returned with a thin ledger, and he made a brief
  examination of its contents. Wholly inadequate, thought Alma, considering the
  trouble she had taken and the interest he had shown.</p>

  <p>"That's that," he said. "Now, George, en voiture!"</p>

  <p>"Why did you want to see the account book?" asked Manfred as they bowled
  up the road.</p>

  <p>"I am naturally commercial-minded," was the unsatisfactory reply. "And,
  George, we're short of juice. Pray like a knight in armour that we sight a
  filling station in the next ten minutes."</p>

  <p>If George had prayed, the prayer would have been answered: just as the
  cylinders started to miss they pulled up the car before a garage, and took in
  a supply which was more than sufficient to carry them to their destination.
  It was nine o'clock exactly when the car stopped before the house. Poiccart,
  watching the arrival from George's room, smiled grimly at the impertinent
  gesture of the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>Behind locked doors the three sat in conference.</p>

  <p>"This has upset all my plans," said Leon at last. "If the girl was safe, I
  should settle with Oberzohn to-night."</p>

  <p>George Manfred stroked his chin thoughtfully. He had once worn a trim
  little beard, and had never got out of that beard-stroking habit of his.</p>

  <p>"We think exactly alike. I intended suggesting that course," he said
  gravely.</p>

  <p>"The trouble is Meadows. I should like the case to have been settled one
  way or the other, and for Meadows to be out of it altogether. One doesn't
  wish to embarrass him. But the urgency is very obvious. It would have been
  very easy," said Leon, a note of regret in his gentle voice. "Now of course
  it is impossible until the girl is safe. But for that"&mdash;he shrugged his
  shoulders&mdash;"to-morrow friend Oberzohn would have experienced a sense of
  lassitude. No pain... just a little tiredness. Sleep, coma&mdash;death on the
  third day. He is an old man, and one has no desire to hurt the aged. There is
  no hurt like fear. As for Gurther, we will try a more violent method, unless
  Oberzohn gets him first. I sincerely hope he does."</p>

  <p>"This is news to me. What is this about Gurther?" asked Poiccart.</p>

  <p>Manfred told him.</p>

  <p>"Leon is right now," Poiccart nodded. He rose from the table and unlocked
  the door. "If any of you men wish to sleep, your rooms are ready; the
  curtains are drawn, and I will wake you at such and such an hour."</p>

  <p>But neither was inclined for sleep. George had to see a client that
  morning: a man with a curious story to tell. Leon wanted a carburettor
  adjusted. They would both sleep in the afternoon, they said.</p>

  <p>The client arrived soon after. Poiccart admitted him and put him in the
  dining-room to wait before he reported his presence.</p>

  <p>"I think this is your harem man," he said, and went downstairs to show up
  the caller.</p>

  <p>He was a commonplace-looking man with a straggling, fair moustache and a
  weak chin.</p>

  <p>"Debilitated or degenerate," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Probably a little of both," assented Manfred, when the butler had
  announced him.</p>

  <p>He came nervously into the room and sat down opposite to Manfred.</p>

  <p>"I tried to get you on the 'phone last night," he complained, "but I got
  no answer."</p>

  <p>"My office hours are from ten till two!" said George good-humouredly. "Now
  will you tell me again this story of your sister?"</p>

  <p>The man leaned back in the chair and clasped his knees, and began in a
  sing-song voice, as though he were reciting something that he had learned by
  heart.</p>

  <p>"We used to live in Turkey. My father was a merchant of Constantinople,
  and my sister, who went to school in England, got extraordinary ideas, and
  came back a most violent pro-Turk. She is a very pretty girl and she came to
  know some of the best Turkish families, although my father and I were dead
  against her going about with these people. One day she went to call on Hymer
  Pasha, and that night she didn't come back. We went to the Pasha's house and
  asked for her, but he told us she had left at four o'clock. We then consulted
  the police, and they told us, after they had made investigations, that she
  had been seen going on board a ship which left for Odessa the same night. I
  hadn't seen her for ten years, until I went down to the Gringo Club, which is
  a little place in the East End&mdash;not high class, you understand, but very
  well conducted. There was a cabaret show after midnight, and whilst I was
  sitting there, thinking about going home&mdash;very bored, you understand,
  because that sort of thing doesn't appeal to me&mdash;I saw a girl come out
  from behind a curtain dressed like a Turkish woman, and begin a dance. She
  was in the middle of the dance when her veil slipped off. It was Marie! She
  recognized me at once, and darted through the curtains. I tried to follow
  her, but they held me back."</p>

  <p>"Did you go to the police?" asked Manfred.</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, what is the use of the police?" he went on in a monotonous tone. "I
  had enough of them in Constantinople, and I made up my mind that I would get
  outside help. And then somebody told me of you, and I came along. Mr.
  Manfred, is it impossible for you to rescue my sister? I'm perfectly sure
  that she is being detained forcibly and against her will."</p>

  <p>"At the Gringo Club?" asked Manfred.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'll see what I can do," said George. "Perhaps my friends and I will come
  down and take a look round some evening. In the meantime will you go back to
  your friend Dr. Oberzohn and tell him that you have done your part and I will
  do mine? Your little story will go into my collection of Unplausible
  Inventions!"</p>

  <p>He touched a bell and Poiccart came in.</p>

  <p>"Show Mr. Liggins out, please. Don't hurt him&mdash;he may have a wife and
  children, though it is extremely unlikely."</p>

  <p>The visitor slunk from the room as though he had been whipped.</p>

  <p>The door had scarcely closed upon him when Poiccart called Leon down from
  his room.</p>

  <p>"Son," he said, "George wants that man trailed."</p>

  <p>Leon peeped out after the retiring victim of Turkish tyranny.</p>

  <p>"Not a hard job," he said. "He has flat feet!"</p>

  <p>Poiccart returned to the consulting-room. "Who is he?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He's been sent here either by Oberzohn or by friend Newton,
  the general idea being to bring us all together at the Gringo
  Club&mdash;which is fairly well known to me&mdash;on some agreeable evening.
  A bad actor! He has no tone. I shouldn't be surprised if Leon finds something
  very interesting about him."</p>

  <p>"He's been before, hasn't he?" Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he was here the day after Barberton came. At least, I had his letter
  the next morning and saw him for a few moments in the day. Queer devil,
  Oberzohn! And an industrious devil," he added. "He sets everybody moving at
  once, and of course he's right. A good general doesn't attack with a platoon,
  but with an army, with all his strength, knowing that if he fails to pierce
  the line at one point he may succeed at another. It's an interesting thought,
  Raymond, that at this moment there are probably some twenty separate and
  independent agencies working for our undoing. Most of them ignorant that
  their efforts are being duplicated. That is Oberzohn's way&mdash;always has
  been his way. It's the way he has started revolutions, the way he has
  organized religious riots."</p>

  <p>After he had had his bath and changed, he announced his intention of
  calling at Chester Square.</p>

  <p>"I'm rather keen on meeting Joan Newton again, even if she has returned to
  her normal state of Jane Smith."</p>

  <p>Miss Newton was not at home, the maid told him when he called. Would he
  see Mr. Montague Newton, who was not only at home, but anxious for him to
  call, if the truth be told, for he had seen his enemy approaching.</p>

  <p>"I shall be pleased," murmured Manfred, and was ushered into the splendour
  of Mr. Newton's drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"Too bad about Joan," said Mr. Newton easily. "She left for the Continent
  this morning."</p>

  <p>"Without a passport?" smiled Manfred.</p>

  <p>A little slip on the part of Monty, but how was Manfred to know that the
  authorities had, only a week before, refused the renewal of her passport
  pending an inquiry into certain irregularities? The suggestion had been that
  other people than she had travelled to and from the Continent armed with this
  individual document.</p>

  <p>"You don't need a passport for Belgium," he lied readily. "Anyway, this
  passport stuff's a bit overdone. We're not at war now."</p>

  <p>"All the time we're at war," said Manfred. "May I sit down?"</p>

  <p>"Do. Have a cigarette?"</p>

  <p>"Let me see the brand before I accept," said Manfred cautiously, and the
  man guffawed as at a great joke.</p>

  <p>The visitor declined the offer of the cigarette-case and took one from a
  box on the table.</p>

  <p>"And is Jane making the grand tour?" he asked blandly.</p>

  <p>"Jane's run down and wants a rest."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with Aylesbury?"</p>

  <p>He saw the man flinch at the mention of the women's convict establishment,
  but he recovered instantly. "It is not far enough out, and I'm told that
  there are all sorts of queer people living round there. No, she's going to
  Brussels and then on to Aix-la-Chapelle, then probably to Spa&mdash;I don't
  suppose I shall see her again for a month or two."</p>

  <p>"She was at Heavytree Farm in the early hours of this morning," said
  Manfred, "and so were you. You were seen and recognized by a friend of
  mine&mdash;Mr. Raymond Poiccart. You travelled from Heavytree Farm to
  Oberzohn's house in a Ford trolley."</p>

  <p>Not by a flicker of an eyelid did Monty Newton betray his dismay.</p>

  <p>"That is bluff," he said. "I didn't leave this house last night. What
  happened at Heavytree Farm?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Leicester was abducted. You are surprised, almost agitated, I
  notice."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I had anything to do with it?" asked Monty steadily.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and the police share my view. A provisional warrant was issued for
  your arrest this morning. I thought you ought to know."</p>

  <p>Now the man drew back, his face went from red to white, and then to a
  deeper red again. Manfred laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"You've got a guilty conscience, Newton," he said, "and that's half-way to
  being arrested. Where is Jane?"</p>

  <p>"Gone abroad, I tell you."</p>

  <p>He was thrown off his balance by this all too successful bluff and had
  lost some of his self-possession.</p>

  <p>"She is with Mirabelle Leicester: of that I'm sure," said Manfred. "I've
  warned you twice, and it is not necessary to warn you a third time. I don't
  know how far deep you're in these snake murders: a jury will decide that
  sooner or later. But you're dead within six hours of my learning that Miss
  Leicester has been badly treated. You know that is true, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Manfred was speaking very earnestly.</p>

  <p>"You're more scared of us than you are of the law, and you're right,
  because we do not put our men to the hazard of a jury's intelligence. You get
  the same trial from us as you get from a judge who knows all the facts. You
  can't beat an English judge, Newton."</p>

  <p>The smile returned and he left the room. Fred, near at hand, waiting in
  the passage but at a respectful distance from the door, let him out with some
  alacrity.</p>

  <p>Monty Newton turned his head sideways, caught a fleeting glimpse of the
  man he hated&mdash;hated worse than he hated Leon Gonsalez&mdash;and then
  called harshly for his servant.</p>

  <p>"Come here," he said, and Fred obeyed. "They'll be sending round to make
  inquiries, and I want you to know what to tell them," he said. "Miss Joan
  went away this morning to the Continent by the eight-fifteen. She's either in
  Brussels or Aix-la-Chapelle. You're not sure of the hotel, but you'll find
  out. Is that clear to you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>Fred was looking aimlessly about the room.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>"I was wondering where the clock is."</p>

  <p>"Clock?" Now Monty Newton heard it himself. The tick-tick-tick of a cheap
  clock, and he went livid. "Find it," he said hoarsely, and even as he spoke
  his eyes fell upon the little black box that had been pushed beneath the
  desk, and he groped for the door with a scream of terror.</p>

  <p>Passers-by in Chester Square saw the door flung open and two men rush
  headlong into the street. And the little American clock, which Manfred had
  purchased a few days before, went on ticking out the time, and was still
  ticking merrily when the police experts went in and opened the box. It was
  Manfred's oldest jest, and never failed.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap22"
     id="chap22">XXII.&mdash;IN THE STORE CELLAR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was impossible that Mirabelle Leicester could fail to
  realize the serious danger in which she stood. Why she had incurred the
  enmity of Oberzohn, for what purpose this man was anxious to keep her under
  his eye, she could not even guess. It was a relief to wake up in the early
  morning, as she did, and find Joan sleeping in the same room; for though she
  had many reasons for mistrusting her, there was something about this
  doll-faced girl that made an appeal to her.</p>

  <p>Joan was lying on the bed fully dressed, and at the sound of the creaking
  bed she turned and got up, fastening her skirt.</p>

  <p>"Well, how do you like your new home?" she asked, with an attempt at
  joviality, which she was far from feeling, in spite of Monty's
  assurances.</p>

  <p>"I've seen better," said Mirabelle coolly.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you have!" Joan stretched and yawned; then, opening one of the
  cupboards, took a shovelful of coal and threw it into the furnace, clanging
  the iron door. "That's my job," she said humorously, "to keep you warm."</p>

  <p>"How long am I going to be kept here?"</p>

  <p>"Five days," was the surprising answer.</p>

  <p>"Why five?" asked Mirabelle curiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Maybe they'll tell you," said Joan.</p>

  <p>She fixed a plug in the wall and turned on the small electric fire.
  Disappearing, she came back with a kettle which she placed on top of the
  ring.</p>

  <p>"The view's not grand, but the food's good," she said, with a gaiety that
  Mirabelle was now sure was forced.</p>

  <p>"You're with these people, of course&mdash;Dr. Oberzohn and Newton?"</p>

  <p>"Mister Newton," corrected Joan. "Yes, I'm his fiancee. We're going to be
  married when things get a little better," she said vaguely, "and there's no
  use in your getting sore with me because I helped to bring you here. Monty's
  told me all about it. They're going to do you no harm at all."</p>

  <p>"Then why&mdash;" began Mirabelle.</p>

  <p>"He'll tell you," interrupted Joan, "sooner or later. The old man,
  or&mdash;or&mdash;well, Monty isn't in this: he's only obliging
  Oberzohn."</p>

  <p>With one thing Mirabelle agreed: it was a waste of time to indulge in
  recriminations or to reproach the girl for her supreme treachery. After all,
  Joan owed nothing to her, and had been from the first a tool employed for her
  detention. It would have been as logical for a convict to reproach the prison
  guard.</p>

  <p>"How do you come to be doing this sort of thing?" she asked, watching the
  girl making tea.</p>

  <p>"Where do you get 'this sort of thing' from?" demanded Joan. "If you
  suppose that I spend my life chaperoning females, you've got another guess
  coming. Scared, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>She looked across at Mirabelle and the girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not really."</p>

  <p>"I should be," confessed Joan. "Do you mind condensed milk? There's no
  other. Yes, I should be writhing under the table, knowing something about
  Oberzohn."</p>

  <p>"If I were Oberzohn," said Mirabelle with spirit, "I should be hiding in a
  deep hole where the Four Just Men would not find me."</p>

  <p>"Four Just Men!" sneered the girl, and then her face changed. "Were they
  the people who whipped Gurther?"</p>

  <p>Mirabelle had not heard of this exploit, but she gave them credit with a
  nod.</p>

  <p>"Is that so? Does Gurther know they're friends of yours?" she asked
  significantly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know Gurther."</p>

  <p>"He's the man who danced with you the other night&mdash;Lord&mdash;I
  forget what name we gave him. Because, if he does know, my dear," she said
  slowly, "you've got two people to be extremely careful with. Gurther's half
  mad. Monty has always said so. He dopes too, and there are times when he's
  not a man at all but a low-down wolf. I'm scared of him&mdash;I'll admit it.
  There aren't Four Just Men, anyway," she went off at a tangent. "There
  haven't been more than three for years. One of them was killed in Bordeaux,
  That's a town I'd hate to be killed in," said Joan irreverently.</p>

  <p>An interval of silence followed whilst she opened an airtight tin and took
  out a small cake, and, putting it on the table, cut it into slices.</p>

  <p>"What are they like?" she asked. Evidently the interval had been filled
  with thoughts of the men from Curzon Street. "Monty says they're just bluff,
  but I'm not so sure that Monty tells me all he thinks. He's so scared that he
  told me to call and see them, just because they gave him an order&mdash;which
  isn't like Monty. They've killed people, haven't they?"</p>

  <p>Mirabelle nodded.</p>

  <p>"And got away with it? They must be clever." Joan's admiration was dragged
  from her. "Where do they get their money?"</p>

  <p>That was always an interesting matter to Joan.</p>

  <p>When the girl explained, she was really impressed. That they could kill
  and get away with it was wonderful; that they were men of millions placed
  them in a category apart.</p>

  <p>"They'll never find you here," said Joan. "There's nobody living knows
  about this vault. There used to be eight men working here, sorting monkey
  hides, and every one of them's dead. Monty told me. He said this place is
  below the canal level, and Oberzohn can flood it in five minutes. Monty
  thinks the old man had an idea of running a slush factory here."</p>

  <p>"What is a slush factory?" asked Mirabelle, open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Phoney&mdash;snide&mdash;counterfeit. Not English, but Continental work.
  He was going to do that if things had gone really bad, but of course you make
  all the difference."</p>

  <p>Mirabelle put down her cup.</p>

  <p>"Does he expect to make money out of me?" she said, trying hard not to
  laugh.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Does he think I have a great deal of money?"</p>

  <p>"He's sure."</p>

  <p>Joan was sure too. Her tone said that plainly enough.</p>

  <p>Mirabelle sat down on the bed, for the moment too astonished to speak. Her
  own financial position was no mystery. She had been left sufficient to bring
  her in a small sum yearly, and with the produce of the farm had managed to
  make both ends meet. It was the failure of the farm as a source of profit
  which had brought her to her new job in London. Alma had also a small
  annuity; the farm was the girl's property, but beyond these revenues she had
  nothing. There was not even a possibility that she was an heiress. Her father
  had been a comparatively poor man, and had been supported in his numerous
  excursions to various parts of the world in search of knowledge by the
  scientific societies to which he was attached; his literary earnings were
  negligible; his books enjoyed only a very limited sale. She could trace her
  ancestry back for seven generations; knew of her uncles and aunts, and they
  did not include a single man or woman who, in the best traditions of the
  story-books, had gone to America and made an immense fortune.</p>

  <p>"It is absurd," she said. "I have no money. If Mr. Oberzohn puts me up to
  ransom, it will have to be something under a hundred!"</p>

  <p>"Put you up to ransom?" said Joan. "I don't get you there. But you're rich
  all right&mdash;I can tell you that. Monty says so, and Monty wouldn't lie to
  me."</p>

  <p>Mirabelle was bewildered. It seemed almost impossible that a man of
  Oberzohn's intelligence and sources of information could make such a mistake.
  And yet Joan was earnest.</p>

  <p>"They must have mistaken me for somebody else," she said, but Joan did not
  answer. She was sitting up in a listening attitude, and her eyes were
  directed towards the iron door which separated their sleeping apartment from
  the larger vault. She had heard the creak of the trap turning and the sound
  of feet coming down the stairs.</p>

  <p>Mirabelle rose as Oberzohn came in. He wore his black dressing-gown, his
  smoking-cap was at the back of his head, and the muddy Wellington boots which
  he had pulled over his feet looked incongruous, and would at any other time
  have provoked her to laughter.. He favoured her with a stiff nod.</p>

  <p>"You have slept well, gracious lady?" he said, and to her amazement took
  her cold hand in his and kissed it.</p>

  <p>She felt the same feeling of revulsion and unreality as had overcome her
  that night at the dance when Gurther had similarly saluted her.</p>

  <p>"It is a nice place, for young people and for old." He looked round the
  apartment with satisfaction. "Here I should be content to spend my life
  reading my books, and giving my mind to thought, but"&mdash;he spread his
  hands and shrugged&mdash;"what would you? I am a business man, with immense
  interests in every part of the world. I am rich, too, beyond your dreams! I
  have stores in every part of the world, and thousands of men and women on my
  pay-roll."</p>

  <p>Why was he telling her all this, she wondered, reciting the facts in a
  monotonous voice. Surely he had not come down to emphasize the soundness of
  his financial position?</p>

  <p>"I am not very much interested in your business, Mr. Oberzohn," she said;
  "but I want to know why I am being detained here. Surely, if you're so rich,
  you do not want to hold me to ransom?"</p>

  <p>"To ransom?" His forehead went up and down. "That is foolish talk. Did she
  tell you?" He pointed at the girl, and his face went as black as thunder.</p>

  <p>"No, I guessed," said Mirabelle quickly, not wishing to get her companion
  into bad odour.</p>

  <p>"I do not hold you to ransom. I hold you, lovely lady, because you are
  good for my eyes. Did not Heine say, 'The beauty of women is a sedative to
  the soul'? You should read Heine: he is frivolous, but in his stupidity there
  are many clever thoughts. Now tell me, lovely lady, have you all you
  desire?"</p>

  <p>"I want to go out," she said. "I can't stay in this underground room
  without danger to my health."</p>

  <p>"Soon you shall go." He bowed stiffly again, and shuffled across the floor
  to the furnace. Behind this were the two baize covered boxes, and one he
  lifted tenderly. "Here are secrets such as you should not pry into," he said
  in his awkward English. "The most potent of chemicals, colossal in power. The
  ignorant would touch them and they would explode&mdash;you understand?"</p>

  <p>He addressed Mirabelle, who did not understand but made no answer.</p>

  <p>"They must be kept warm for that reason. One I take, the other I leave.
  You shall not touch it&mdash;that is understood? My good friend has told
  you?" He brought his eyes to Joan.</p>

  <p>"I understand all right," she said. "Listen, Oberzohn: when am I going out
  for a walk? This place is getting on my nerves already."</p>

  <p>"To-night you shall exercise with the lovely lady. I myself will accompany
  you."</p>

  <p>"Why am I here, Mr. Oberzohn?" Mirabelle asked again.</p>

  <p>"You are here because you are in danger," said Oberzohn, holding the green
  box under his arm. "You are in very great danger." He nodded with every word.
  "There are certain men, of all the most infamous, who have a design upon your
  life. They are criminal, cunning and wise&mdash;but not so cunning or wise as
  Dr. Oberzohn. Because I will not let you fall into their hands I keep you
  here, young miss. Good morning."</p>

  <p>Again he bowed stiffly and went out, the iron door clanging behind him.
  They heard him climbing the stairs, the thud of the trap as it fell, and the
  rumble which Joan, at any rate, knew was made by the cement barrel being
  rolled to the top of the trap.</p>

  <p>"Pleasant little fellow, isn't he?" said Joan bitterly. "Him and his
  chemicals!" She glared down at the remaining box. "If I were sure it wouldn't
  explode, I should smash it to smithereens!" she said.</p>

  <p>Later she told the prisoner of Oberzohn's obsession; of how he spent time
  and money in his search for the vital elixir.</p>

  <p>"Monty thinks he'll find it," she said seriously. "Do you know, that old
  man has had an ox stewed down to a pint? There used to be a king in
  Europe&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;who had the same stuff, but not so
  strong. Monty says that Oberzohn hardly ever takes a meal&mdash;just a
  teaspoonful of this dope and he's right for the day. And Monty says... "</p>

  <p>For the rest of that dreary morning the girl listened without hearing to
  the wise sayings and clever acts of Monty; and every now and again her eyes
  strayed to the baize-covered box which contained "the most potent chemicals,"
  and she wondered whether, in the direst extremity, she would be justified in
  employing these dread forces for her soul's salvation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap23"
     id="chap23">XXIII.&mdash;THE COURIER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ELIJAH WASHINGTON came up to London for a consultation. With
  the exception of a blue contusion beneath his right eye, he was none the
  worse for his alarming experience.</p>

  <p>Leon Gonsalez had driven him to town, and on the way up the big man had
  expressed views about snake-bite which were immensely interesting to the man
  at the wheel. "I've figured it out this way: there is no snake at all. What
  happens is that these guys have extracted snake venom&mdash;and that's easy,
  by making a poison-snake bite on something soft&mdash;and have poisoned a
  dart or a burr with the venom. I've seen that done in Africa, particularly up
  in the Ituri country, and it's pretty common in South America. The fellow
  just throws or shoots it, and just where the dart hits, he gets
  snake-poisoning right away."</p>

  <p>"That is an excellent theory," said Leon, "only&mdash;no dart or burr has
  ever been found. It was the first thing the police looked for in the case of
  the stockbroker. They had the ground searched for days. And it was just the
  same in the case of the tramp and the bank clerk, just the same in the case
  of Barberton. A dart would stick some time and would be found in the man's
  clothing or near the spot where he was struck down. How do you account for
  that?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Washington very frankly admitted that he couldn't account for it at
  all, and Leon chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I can," he said. "In fact, I know just how it's done."</p>

  <p>"Great snakes!" gasped Washington in amazement. "Then why don't you tell
  the police?"</p>

  <p>"The police know&mdash;now," said Leon. "It isn't snake-bite&mdash;it is
  nicotine poisoning."</p>

  <p>"How's that?" asked the startled man, but Leon had his joke to
  himself.</p>

  <p>After a consultation which had lasted most of the night they had brought
  Washington from Rath Hall, and on the way Leon hinted gently that the Three
  had a mission for him and hoped he would accept.</p>

  <p>"You're much too good a fellow to be put into an unnecessarily dangerous
  position," he said; "and even if you weren't, we wouldn't lightly risk your
  blessed life; but the job we should ask you to do isn't exactly a
  picnic."</p>

  <p>"Listen!" said Mr. Washington with sudden energy. "I don't want any more
  snakes&mdash;not that kind of snake! I've felt pain in my time, but nothing
  like this! I know it must have been snake venom, but I'd like to meet the
  little wriggler who brews the brand that was handed to me, and maybe I'd
  change my mind about collecting him&mdash;alive!"</p>

  <p>Leon agreed silently, and for the next few moments was avoiding a street
  car on one side, a baker's cart on another, and a blah woman who was walking
  aimlessly in the road, apparently with no other intention than of courting an
  early death, this being the way of blah women.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" said Mr. Washington, as the car skidded on the greasy road. "I
  don't know whether you're a good driver or just naturally under the
  protection of Providence."</p>

  <p>"Both," said Leon, when he had straightened the machine. "All good drivers
  are that."</p>

  <p>Presently he continued:</p>

  <p>"It is snake venom all right, Mr. Washington; only snake venom that has
  been most carefully treated by a man who knows the art of concentration of
  its bad and the extraction of its harmless constituents. My theory is that
  certain alkaloids are added, and it is possible that there has been a
  blending of two different kinds of poison. But you're right when you say that
  no one animal carries in his poison sac that particular variety of
  death-juice. If it is any value to you, we are prepared to give you a
  snake-proof certificate!"</p>

  <p>"I don't want another experience of that kind," Elijah Washington warned
  him; but Leon turned the conversation to the state of the road and the
  problems of traffic control.</p>

  <p>There had been nothing seen or heard of Mirabelle, and Meadows' activities
  had for the moment been directed to the forthcoming inquest on Barberton.
  Nowadays, whenever he reached Scotland Yard, he moved in a crowd of
  reporters, all anxious for news of further developments. The Barberton death
  was still the livest topic in the newspapers: the old scare of the snake had
  been revived and in some degree intensified. There was not a journal which
  did not carry columns of letters to the editor denouncing the inactivity of
  the police. Were they, asked one sarcastic correspondent, under the hypnotic
  influence of the snake's eyes? Could they not, demanded another, give up
  trapping speeders on the Lingfield road and bring their mighty brains to the
  elucidation of a mystery that was to cause every household in London the
  gravest concern? The Barberton murder was the peg on which every
  letter-writing faddist had a novel view to hang, and Mr. Meadows was not at
  that time the happiest officer in the force.</p>

  <p>"Where is Lee?" asked Washington as they came into Curzon Street.</p>

  <p>"He's in town for the moment, but we are moving him to the North of
  England, though I don't think there is any danger to him, now that
  Barberton's letters are in our possession. They would have killed him
  yesterday to prevent our handling the correspondence. To-day I should imagine
  he has no special importance in the eyes of Oberzohn and Company. And here we
  are!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Washington got out stiffly and was immediately admitted by the butler.
  The three men went upstairs to where George Manfred was wrestling with a
  phase of the problem. He was not alone; Digby, his head swathed in bandages,
  sat, an unhappy man, on the edge of a chair and answered Leon's cheery
  greeting with a mournful smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm sending Digby to keep observation on Oberzohn's house; and especially
  do I wish him to search that old boat of his."</p>

  <p>He was referring to an ancient barge which lay on the mud at the bottom of
  Mr. Oberzohn's private dock. From the canal there was a narrow waterway into
  the little factory grounds. It was so long since the small cantilever bridge
  which covered the entrance had been raised, that locals regarded the bridge
  floor as part of the normal bank of the canal. But behind the green
  water-gates was a concrete dock large enough to hold one barge, and here for
  years a decrepit vessel had wallowed, the hunting-ground of rats and the
  sleeping-place of the desperately homeless.</p>

  <p>"The barge is practically immovable: I've already reported on that," said
  Leon.</p>

  <p>"It certainly has that appearance, and yet I would like a search," replied
  Manfred. "You understand that this is night duty, and I have asked Meadows to
  notify the local inspector that you will be on duty&mdash;I don't want to be
  pulled out of my bed to identify you at the Peckham police station. It isn't
  a cheerful job, but you might be able to make it interesting by finding your
  way into his grounds. I don't think the factory will yield much, but the
  house will certainly be a profitable study to an observer of human
  nature."</p>

  <p>"I hope I do better this time, Mr. Manfred," said Digby, turning to go.
  "And, if you don't mind, I'll go by day and take a look at the place. I don't
  want to fall down this time!"</p>

  <p>George smiled as he rose and shook the man's hand at parting. "Even Mr.
  Gonsalez makes mistakes," he said maliciously, and Leon looked hurt.</p>

  <p>Manfred tidied some papers on his desk and put them into a drawer, waiting
  for Poiccart's return. When he had come: "Now, Mr. Washington, we will tell
  you what we wish you to do. We wish you to take a letter to Lisbon. Leon has
  probably hinted something to that effect, and it is now my duty to tell you
  that the errand is pretty certain to be an exceedingly dangerous one, but you
  are the only man I know to whom I could entrust this important document. I
  feel I cannot allow you to undertake this mission without telling you that
  the chances are heavily against your reaching Portugal."</p>

  <p>"Bless you for those cheerful words," said Washington blankly. "The only
  thing I want to be certain about is, am I likely to meet Mr. Snake?"</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded, and the American's face lengthened.</p>

  <p>"I don't know that even that scares me," he said at last, "especially now
  that I know that the dope they use isn't honest snake-spit at all but a
  synthesized poison. It was having my confidence shaken in snakes that rattled
  me. When do you want me to go?"</p>

  <p>"To-night."</p>

  <p>Mr. Washington for the moment was perplexed, and Manfred continued: "Not
  by the Dover-Calais route. We would prefer that you travelled by
  Newhaven-Dieppe. Our friends are less liable to be on the alert, though I
  can't even guarantee that. Oberzohn spends a lot of money in espionage. This
  house has been under observation for days. I will show you."</p>

  <p>He walked to the window and drew aside the curtain.</p>

  <p>"Do you see a spy?" he asked, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

  <p>Mr. Washington looked up and down the street.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" he said. "That man at the corner smoking a cigar&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is a detective officer from Scotland Yard," said Manfred. "Do you see
  anybody else?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Washington after a while, "there's a man cleaning windows on
  the opposite side of the road: he keeps looking across here."</p>

  <p>"A perfectly innocent citizen," said Manfred.</p>

  <p>"Well, he can't be in any of those taxis, because they're empty." Mr.
  Washington nodded to a line of taxis drawn up on the rank in the centre of
  the road.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, he is in the first taxi on the rank&mdash;he is the
  driver! If you went out and called a cab, he would come to you. If anybody
  else called him, he would be engaged. His name is Clarke, he lives at 43,
  Portlington Mews; he is an ex-convict living apart from his wife, and he
  receives seven pounds a week for his services, ten pounds every time he
  drives Oberzohn's car, and all the money he makes out of his cab."</p>

  <p>He smiled at the other's astonishment.</p>

  <p>"So the chances are that your movements will be known; even though you do
  not call the cab, he will follow you. You must be prepared for that. I'm
  putting all my cards on the table, Mr. Washington, and asking you to do
  something which, if you cannot bring yourself to agree, must be done by
  either myself, Poiccart or Gonsalez. Frankly, none of us can be spared."</p>

  <p>"I'll go," said the American. "Snake or no snake, I'm for Lisbon. What is
  my route?"</p>

  <p>Poiccart took a folded paper from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Newhaven, Dieppe, Paris. You have a reserved compartment on the Sud
  Express; you reach Valladolid late tomorrow night, and change to the
  Portuguese mail. Unless I can fix an aeroplane to meet you at Irun. We are
  trying now. Otherwise, you should be in Lisbon at two o'clock on the
  following afternoon. He had better take the letter now, George."</p>

  <p>Manfred unlocked the wall safe and took out a long envelope. It was
  addressed to "Senhor Alvaz Manuel y Cintra, Minister of Colonies," and was
  heavily sealed.</p>

  <p>"I want you to place this in Senhor Cintra's hands. You'll have no
  difficulty there because you will be expected," he said. "Will you travel in
  that suit?"</p>

  <p>The American thought.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's as good as any," he said.</p>

  <p>"Will you take off your jacket?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Washington obeyed, and with a small pair of scissors Manfred cut a
  slit in the lining and slipped the letter in. Then, to the American's
  astonishment, Leon produced a rolled housewife, threaded a needle with
  extraordinary dexterity, and for the next five minutes the snake-hunter
  watched the deft fingers stitching through paper and lining. So skilfully was
  the slit sewed that Elijah Washington had to look twice to make sure where
  the lining had been cut.</p>

  <p>"Well, that beats the band!" he said. "Mr. Gonsalez, I'll send you my
  shirts for repair!"</p>

  <p>"And here is something for you to carry." It was a black leather
  portfolio, well worn. To one end was attached a steel chain terminating in a
  leather belt. "I want you to put this round your waist, and from now on to
  carry this wallet. It contains nothing more important than a few envelopes
  imposingly sealed, and if you lose it no great harm will come."</p>

  <p>"You think they'll go for the wallet?" Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>"One cannot tell, of course, what Oberzohn will do, and he's as wily as
  one of his snakes. But my experience has been," he said, "that the cleverer
  the criminal, the bigger the fool and the more outrageous his mistakes. You
  will want money."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not short of that," said the other with a smile. "Snakes are a
  mighty profitable proposition. Still, I'm a business man... "</p>

  <p>For the next five minutes they discussed financial details, and he was
  more than surprised to discover the recklessness with which money was
  disbursed.</p>

  <p>He went out, with a glance from the corner of his eye at the taximan,
  whose hand was raised inquiringly, but, ignoring the driver, he turned and
  walked towards Regent Street, and presently found a wandering taxi of an
  innocuous character, and ordered the man to drive to the Ritz-Carlton, where
  rooms had been taken for him.</p>

  <p>He was in Regent Street before he looked round through the peep-hole, and,
  as Manfred had promised him, the taxi was following, its flag down to prevent
  chance hiring. Mr. Washington went up to his room, opened the window and
  looked out: the taxi had joined a near-by rank. The driver had left his
  box.</p>

  <p>"He's on the 'phone," muttered Mr. Washington, and would have given a lot
  of money to have known the nature of the message.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap24"
     id="chap24">XXIV.&mdash;ON THE NIGHT MAIL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A MAN of habit, Mr. Oberzohn missed his daily journey to the
  City Road. In ordinary circumstances the loss would have been a paralysing
  one, but of late he had grown more and more wedded to his deep arm-chair and
  his ponderous volumes; and though the City Road had been a very useful
  establishment in many ways, and was ill replaced by the temporary building
  which his manager had secured, he felt he could almost dispense with that
  branch of his business altogether.</p>

  <p>Oberzohn &amp; Smitts was an institution which had grown out of nothing.
  The energy of the partners, and especially the knowledge of African trading
  conditions which the departed Smitts possessed, had produced a nourishing
  business which ten years before could have been floated for half a million
  pounds.</p>

  <p>Orders still came in. There were up-country stores to be restocked; new,
  if unimportant, contracts to be fulfilled; there was even a tentative offer
  under consideration from one of the South American States for the armaments
  of a political faction. But Mr. Oberzohn was content to mark time, in the
  faith that the next week would see him superior to these minor considerations
  and in a position, if he so wished, to liquidate his business and sell his
  stores and his trade. There were purchasers ready, but the half million
  pounds had dwindled to a tenth of that sum, which outstanding bills would
  more than absorb. As Manfred had said, his running expenses were enormous. He
  had agents in every central Government office in Europe, and though they did
  not earn their salt, they certainly drew more than condiment for their
  services.</p>

  <p>He had spent a busy morning in his little workshop-laboratory, and had
  settled himself down in his chair, when a telegraph messenger came trundling
  his bicycle across the rough ground, stopped to admire for a second the iron
  dogs which littered the untidy strip of lawn, and woke the echoes of this
  gaunt house with a thunderous knock. Mr. Oberzohn hurried to the door. A
  telegram to this address must necessarily be important. He took the telegram,
  slammed the door in the messenger's face and hurried back to his room,
  tearing open the envelope as he went.</p>

  <p>There were three sheets of misspelt writing, for the wire was in
  Portuguese and telegraph operators are bad guessers. He read it through
  carefully, his lips moving silently, until he came to the end, then he
  started reading all over again, and, for a better understanding of its
  purport, he took a pencil and paper and translated the message into Swedish.
  He laid the telegram face downwards on the table and took up his book, but he
  was not reading. His busy mind slipped from Lisbon to London, from Curzon
  Street to the factory, and at last he shut his book with a bang, got up, and
  opening the door, barked Gurther's name. That strange man came downstairs in
  his stockinged feet, his hair hanging over his eyes, an unpleasant sight. Dr.
  Oberzohn pointed to the room and the man entered.</p>

  <p>For an hour they talked behind locked doors, and then Gurther came out,
  still showing his teeth in a mechanical smile, and went up the stairs two at
  a time. The half-witted Danish maid, passing the door of the doctor's room,
  heard his gruff voice booming into the telephone, but since he spoke a
  language which, whilst it had some relation to her own, was subtly different,
  she could not have heard the instructions, admonitions, orders and
  suggestions which he fired in half a dozen different directions, even if she
  had heard him clearly.</p>

  <p>This done, Dr. Oberzohn returned to his book and a midday refreshment,
  spooning his lunch from a small cup at his side containing a few fluid ounces
  of dark red liquid. One half of his mind was pursuing his well-read
  philosophers; the other worked at feverish speed, conjecturing and guessing,
  forestalling and baffling the minds that were working against him. He played
  a game of mental chess, all the time seeking for a check, and when at last he
  had discovered one that was adequate, he put down his book and went out into
  his garden, strolling up and down inside the wire fence, stopping now and
  again to pick a flower from a weed, or pausing to examine a rain-filled
  pothole as though it were the star object in a prize landscape.</p>

  <p>He loved this ugly house, knew every brick of it, as a feudal lord might
  have known the castle he had built, the turret, the flat roof with its high
  parapet, that commanded a view of the canal bank on the one side and the
  railway arches left and right. They were railway arches which had a value to
  him. Most of them were blocked up, having been converted into lock-up garages
  and sheds, and through only a few could ingress be had. One, under which ran
  the muddy lane&mdash;why it was called Hangman's Lane nobody knew; another
  that gave to some allotments on the edge of his property; and a third through
  which he also could see daylight, but which spanned no road at all.</p>

  <p>An express train roared past in a cloud of steam, and he scanned the
  viaduct with benignant interest. And then he performed his daily tour of
  inspection. Turning back into the house, he climbed the stairs to the third
  floor, opened a little door that revealed an extra flight of steps, and
  emerged on to the roof. At each corner was a square black shed, about the
  height of a man's chest. The doors were heavily padlocked, and near by each
  was a stout black box, equally weatherproof. There were other things here:
  great, clumsy wall-plugs at regular intervals. Seeing them, it might be
  thought that Mr. Oberzohn contemplated a night when, in the exultation of
  achievement, he would illuminate his ungainly premises. But up till now that
  night had not arrived, and in truth the only light usable was one which at
  the moment was dismantled in the larger of the four sheds.</p>

  <p>From here he could look down upon the water cutting into the factory
  grounds; and the black bulk of the barge, which filled the entire width of
  the wharf, seemed so near that he could have thrown a stone upon it. His idle
  interest was in the sluggish black water that oozed through the gates. A
  slight mist lay upon the canal; a barge was passing down towards Deptford,
  and he contemplated the straining horse that tugged the barge rope with a
  mind set upon the time when he, too, might use the waterway in a swifter
  craft.</p>

  <p>London lay around him, its spires and chimneys looming through the thin
  haze of smoke. Far away the sun caught the golden ball of St. Paul's and
  added a new star to the firmament. Mr. Oberzohn hated London&mdash;only this
  little patch of his had beauty in his eyes. Not the broad green parks and the
  flowering rhododendrons; not the majestic aisles of pleasure which the rich
  lounger rode or walked, nor the streets of stone-fronted stores, nor the
  pleasant green of suburban roads&mdash;he loved only these God-forgotten
  acres, this slimy wilderness in which he had set up his habitation.</p>

  <p>He went downstairs, locking the roof door behind him, and, passing
  Gurther's room, knocked and was asked to enter. The man sat in his singlet;
  he had shaved once, but now the keen razor was going across his skin for the
  second time. He turned his face, shining with cream, and grinned round at the
  intruder, and with a grunt the doctor shut the door and went downstairs,
  knowing that the man was for the moment happy; for nothing pleased Gurther
  quite so much as "dressing up."</p>

  <p>The doctor stood at the entrance of his own room, hesitating between books
  and laboratory, decided upon the latter, and was busy for the next two hours.
  Only once he came out, and that was to bring from the warm room the green
  baize box which contained "the most potent of chemicals, colossal in
  power."</p>

  <p>The Newhaven-Dieppe route is spasmodically popular. There are nights when
  the trains to Paris are crowded; other nights when it is possible to obtain a
  carriage to yourself; and it happened that this evening, when Elijah
  Washington booked his seat, he might, if it had been physically possible,
  have sat in one compartment and put his feet on the seat in another.</p>

  <p>Between the two great branches of the Anglo-Saxon race there is one
  notable difference. The Englishman prefers to travel in solitude and silence.
  His ideal journey is one from London to Constantinople in a compartment that
  is not invaded except by the ticket collector; and if it is humanly possible
  that he can reach his destination without having given utterance to anything
  more sensational than an agreement with some other passenger's comment on the
  weather, he is indeed a happy man. The American loves company; he has the
  acquisitiveness of the Latin, combined with the rhetorical virtues of the
  Teuton. Solitude makes him miserable; silence irritates him. He wants to talk
  about large and important things, such as the future of the country, the
  prospects of agriculture and the fluctuations of trade, about which the
  average Englishman knows nothing, and is less interested. The American has a
  town pride, can talk almost emotionally about a new drainage system and grow
  eloquent upon a municipal balance sheet. The Englishman does not cultivate
  his town pride until he reaches middle age, and then only in sufficient
  quantities to feel disappointed with the place of his birth after he has
  renewed its acquaintance.</p>

  <p>Mr. Washington found himself in an empty compartment, and, grunting his
  dissatisfaction, walked along the corridor, peeping into one cell after
  another in the hope of discovering a fellow-countryman in a similar unhappy
  plight. His search was fruitless and he returned to the carriage in which his
  bag and overcoat were deposited, and settled down to the study of an English
  humorous newspaper and a vain search for something at which any intelligent
  man could laugh.</p>

  <p>The doors of the coach were at either end, and most passengers entering
  had to pass the open entrance of Mr. Washington's compartment. At every click
  of the door he looked up, hoping to find a congenial soul. But disappointment
  awaited him, until a lady hesitated by the door. It was a smoking carriage,
  but Washington, who was a man of gallant character, would gladly have
  sacrificed his cigar for the pleasure of her society. Young, he guessed, and
  a widow. She was in black, an attractive face showed through a heavy
  veil.</p>

  <p>"Is this compartment engaged?" she asked in a low voice that was almost a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>"No, madam." Washington rose, hat in hand.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind?" she asked in a soft voice.</p>

  <p>"Why, surely! Sit down, ma'am," said the gallant American. "Would you like
  the corner seat by the window?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, and sat down near the door, turning her face from
  him.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind my smoking?" asked Washington, after a while.</p>

  <p>"Please smoke," she said, and again turned her face away.</p>

  <p>"English," thought Mr. Washington in disgust, and hunched himself for an
  hour and a half of unrelieved silence.</p>

  <p>A whistle blew, the train moved slowly from the platform, and Elijah
  Washington's adventurous journey had begun.</p>

  <p>They were passing through Croydon when the girl rose, and, leaning out,
  closed the little glass-panelled door.</p>

  <p>"You should let me do that," said Elijah reproachfully, and she murmured
  something about not wishing to trouble him, and he relapsed into his
  seat.</p>

  <p>One or two of the men who passed looked in, and evidently this annoyed
  her, for she reached and pulled down the spring blind which partially hid her
  from outside observation, and after the ticket collector had been and punched
  the slips, she lowered the second of the three blinds.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Sure not, ma'am," said Elijah, without any great heartiness. He had no
  desire to travel alone with a lady in a carriage so discreetly curtained. He
  had heard of cases... and by nature he was an extremely cautious man.</p>

  <p>The speed of the train increased; the wandering passengers had settled
  down. The second of the ticket inspections came as they were rushing through
  Redhill, and Mr. Washington thought uncomfortably that there was a
  significant look in the inspector's face as he glanced first at the drawn
  blinds, then from the lady to himself.</p>

  <p>She affected a perfume of a peculiarly pleasing kind. The carriage was
  filled with this subtle fragrance. Mr. Washington smelt it above the scent of
  his cigar. Her face was still averted; he wondered if she had gone to sleep,
  and, growing weary of his search for humour, he put down the paper, folded
  his hands and closed his eyes, and found himself gently drifting to that
  medley of the real and unreal which is the overture of dreams.</p>

  <p>The lady moved; he looked at her out of the corner of his half-closed
  eyes. She had moved round so as to half face him. Her veil was still down,
  her white gloves were reflectively clasped on her knees. He shut his eyes
  again, until another movement brought him awake. She was feeling in her
  bag.</p>

  <p>Mr. Washington was awake now&mdash;as wide awake as he had ever been in
  his life. In stretching out her hand, the lady had pulled short her sleeve,
  and there was a gap of flesh between the glove and the wrist of her blouse,
  and on her wrist was hair!</p>

  <p>He shifted his position slightly, grunted as in his sleep, and dropped his
  hand to his pocket, and all the time those cold eyes were watching him
  through the veil.</p>

  <p>Lifting the bottom of the veil, she put the ebony holder between her teeth
  and searched the bag for a match. Then she turned appealingly to him as
  though she had sensed his wakefulness. As she rose, Washington rose too, and
  suddenly he sprang at her and flung her back against the door. For a moment
  the veiled lady was taken by surprise, and then there was a flash of
  steel.</p>

  <p>From nowhere a knife had come into her hand and Washington gripped the
  wrist and levered it over, pushing the palm of his hand under the chin. Even
  through the veil he could feel the bristles, and knew now, if he had not
  known before, that he had to deal with a man. A live, active man, rendered
  doubly strong by the knowledge of his danger. Gurther butted forward with his
  head, but Washington saw the attack coming, shortened his arm and jabbed full
  at the face behind the veil. The blow stopped the man only for an instant,
  and again he came on, and this time the point of the knife caught the
  American's shoulder, and ripped the coat to the elbow. It needed this to
  bring forth Elijah Washington's mental and physical reserves. With a roar he
  gripped the throat of his assailant and threw him with such violence against
  the door that it gave, and the "widow in mourning" crashed against the panel
  of the outer corridor. Before he could reach the attacker, Gurther had turned
  and sped along the corridor to the door of the coach. In a second he had
  flung it open and had dropped to the footboard. The train was slowing to take
  Horsham Junction, and the cat eyes waited until he saw a good fall, and let
  go. Staring back into the darkness, Washington saw nothing, and then the
  train inspector came along.</p>

  <p>"It was a man in woman's clothes," he said, a little breathlessly, and
  they went back to search the compartment, but Mr. Gurther had taken bag and
  everything with him, and the only souvenir of his presence was the heel of a
  shoe that had been torn off in the struggle.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap25"
     id="chap25">XXV.&mdash;GURTHER RETURNS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE train was going at thirty miles an hour when Gurther
  dropped on to a ridge of sand by the side of the track, and in the next
  second he was sliding forward on his face. Fortunately for him the veil,
  though torn, kept his eyes free. Stumbling to his feet, he looked round. The
  level-crossing gates should be somewhere here. He had intended jumping the
  train at this point, and Oberzohn had made arrangements accordingly. A
  signalman, perched high above the track, saw the figure and challenged.</p>

  <p>"I've lost my way," said Gurther. "Where is the level-crossing?"</p>

  <p>"A hundred yards farther on. Keep clear of those metals&mdash;the
  Eastbourne express is coming behind."</p>

  <p>If Gurther had had his way, he would have stopped long enough to remove a
  rail for the sheer joy of watching a few hundred of the hated people plunged
  to destruction. But he guessed that the car was waiting, went sideways
  through the safety gates into a road which was fairly populous. There were
  people about who turned their heads and looked in amazement at the bedraggled
  woman in black, but he had got beyond worrying about his appearance.</p>

  <p>He saw the car with the little green light which Oberzohn invariably used
  to mark his machines from others, and, climbing into the cab (as it was), sat
  down to recover his breath. The driver he knew as one of the three men
  employed by Oberzohn, one of whom Mr. Washington had seen that morning.</p>

  <p>The journey back to town was a long one, though the machine, for a public
  vehicle, was faster than most. Gurther welcomed the ride. Once more he had
  failed, and he reasoned that this last failure was the most serious of all.
  The question of Oberzohn's displeasure did not really arise. He had travelled
  far beyond the point when the Swede's disapproval meant very much to him. But
  there might be a consequence more serious than any. He knew well with what
  instructions Pfeiffer had been primed on the night of the attack at Rath
  House&mdash;only Gurther had been quicker, and his snake had bitten first.
  Dr. Oberzohn had no illusions as to what happened, and if he had tactfully
  refrained from making reference to the matter, he had his purpose and
  reasons. And this night journey with Elijah Washington was one of them.</p>

  <p>There was no excuse; he had none to offer. His hand wandered beneath the
  dress to the long knife that was strapped to his side, and the touch of the
  worn handle was very reassuring. For the time being he was safe; until
  another man was found to take Pfeiffer's place Oberzohn was working
  single-handed and could not afford to dispense with the services of this, the
  last of his assassins.</p>

  <p>It was past eleven when he dismissed the taxi at the end of the long lane,
  and, following the only safe path, came to the unpainted door that gave
  admission to Oberzohn's property. And the first words of his master told him
  that there was no necessity for explanation.</p>

  <p>"So you did not get him, Gurther?"</p>

  <p>"No, Herr Doktor.'</p>

  <p>"I should not have sent you." Oberzohn's voice was extraordinarily mild in
  all the circumstances. "That man you cannot kill&mdash;with the snake. I have
  learned since you went that he was bitten at the blind man's house, yet
  lives! That is extraordinary. I would give a lot of money to test his blood.
  You tried the knife?"</p>

  <p>"Ja, Herr Doktor." He lifted his veil, stripped off hat and wig in one
  motion. The rouged and powdered face was bruised; from under the brown wig
  was a trickle of dried blood.</p>

  <p>"Good! You have done as well as you could. Go to your room,
  Gurther&mdash;march!"</p>

  <p>Gurther went upstairs, and for a quarter of an hour was staring at his
  grinning face in the glass, as with cream and soiled towel he removed his
  make-up.</p>

  <p>Oberzohn's very gentleness was a menace. What did it portend? Until that
  evening neither Gurther nor his dead companion had been taken into the
  confidence of the two men who directed their activities. He knew there were
  certain papers to be recovered; he knew there were men to be killed; but what
  value were the papers, or why death should be directed to this unfortunate or
  that, he neither knew nor cared. His duty had been to obey, and he had served
  a liberal paymaster well and loyally. That girl in the underground room?
  Gurther had many natural explanations for her imprisonment. And yet none of
  them fitted the conditions. His cogitations were wasted time. That night, for
  the first time, the doctor took him into his confidence.</p>

  <p>He had finished dressing and was on his way to his kitchen when the doctor
  stood at the doorway and called him in.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Gurther." He was almost kind. "You will have a cigar? These are
  excellent."</p>

  <p>He threw a long, thin, black cheroot, and Gurther caught it between his
  teeth and seemed absurdly pleased with his trick.</p>

  <p>"The time has come when you must know something, Gurther," said the
  doctor. He took a fellow to the weed the man was smoking, and puffed huge
  clouds of rank smoke into the room. "I have for a friend&mdash;who? Herr
  Newton?" He shrugged his shoulders. "He is a very charming man, but he has no
  brains. He is the kind of man, Gurther, who would live in comfort, take all
  we gave him by our cleverness and industry, and never say thank you! And in
  trouble what will he do, Gurther? He will go to the police&mdash;yes, my dear
  friend, he will go to the police!"</p>

  <p>He nodded. Gurther had heard the same story that night when he had crept
  soft-footed to the door and had heard the doctor discuss certain matters with
  the late Mr. Pfeiffer.</p>

  <p>"He would, without a wink of his eyelash, without a snap of his hand, send
  you and me to death, and would read about our execution with a smile, and
  then go forth and eat his plum-pudding and roast beef! That is our friend
  Herr Newton! You have seen this with your own eyes?"</p>

  <p>"Ja, Herr Doktor!" exclaimed the obedient Gurther.</p>

  <p>"He is a danger for many reasons," Oberzohn proceeded deliberately.
  "Because of these three men who have so infamously set themselves out to ruin
  me, who burnt down my house, and who whipped you, Gurther&mdash;they tied you
  up to a post and whipped you with a whip of nine tails. You have not
  forgotten, Gurther?"</p>

  <p>"Nein, Herr Doktor!" Indeed, Gurther had not forgotten, though the vacant
  smirk on his face might suggest that he had a pleasant memory of the
  happening.</p>

  <p>"A fool in an organization," continued the doctor oracularly, "is like a
  bad plate on a ship, or a weak link in a chain. Let it snap, and what
  happens? You and I die, my dear Gurther. We go up before a stupid man in a
  white wig and a red cloak, and he hands us to another man who puts a rope
  around our necks, drops us through a hole in the ground&mdash;all because we
  have a stupid man like Herr Montague Newton to deal with."</p>

  <p>"Ja, Herr Doktor," said Gurther as his master stopped. He felt that this
  comment was required of him.</p>

  <p>"Now, I will tell you the whole truth." The doctor carefully knocked off
  the ash of his cigar into the saucer of his cup. "There is a fortune for you
  and for me, and this girl that we have in the quiet place can give it to us.
  I can marry her, or I can wipe her out, so! If I marry her, it would be
  better, I think, and this I have arranged."</p>

  <p>And then, in his own way, he told the story of the hill of gold,
  concealing nothing, reserving nothing&mdash;all that he knew, all that Villa
  had told him.</p>

  <p>"For three-four days now she must be here. At the end of that time nothing
  matters. The letter to Lisbon&mdash;of what value is it? I was foolish when I
  tried to stop it. She has made no nominee, she has no heirs, she has known
  nothing of her fortune, and therefore is in no position to claim the renewal
  of the concession."</p>

  <p>"Herr Doktor, will you graciously permit me to speak?" The doctor nodded.
  "Does the Newton know this?"</p>

  <p>"The Newton knows all this," said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Will you graciously permit me to speak again, Herr Doktor? What was this
  letter I was to have taken, had I not been overcome by misfortune?"</p>

  <p>Oberzohn examined the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"I have thought this matter from every angle," he said, "and I have
  decided thus. It was a letter written by Gonsalez to the Secretary or the
  Minister of the Colonies, asking that the renewal of the concession should be
  postponed. The telegram from my friend at the Colonial Office in Lisbon was
  to this effect." He fixed his glasses, fumbled in his waistcoat and took out
  the three-page telegram. "I will read it to you in your own
  language&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Application has been received from Leon Gonsalez, asking His Excellency
  to receive a very special letter which arrives in two days. The telegram does
  not state the contents of the letter, but the Minister has given orders for
  the messenger to be received. The present Minister is not favourable to
  concessions granted to England or Englishmen.'"</p>

  <p>He folded the paper.</p>

  <p>"Which means that there will be no postponement, my dear Gurther, and this
  enormous fortune will be ours."</p>

  <p>Gurther considered this point and for a moment forgot to smile, and looked
  what he was in consequence: a hungry, discontented wolf of a man.</p>

  <p>"Herr Doktor, graciously permit me to ask you a question?"</p>

  <p>"Ask," said Oberzohn magnanimously.</p>

  <p>"What share does Herr Newton get? And if you so graciously honoured me
  with a portion of your so justly deserved gains, to what extent would be that
  share?"</p>

  <p>The other considered this, puffing away until the room was a mist of
  smoke.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand English pounds," he said at last.</p>

  <p>"Gracious and learned doctor, that is a very small proportion of many
  millions," said Gurther gently.</p>

  <p>"Newton will receive one half," said the doctor, his face working
  nervously, "if he is alive. If misfortune came to him, that share would be
  yours, Gurther, my brave fellow! And with so much money a man would not be
  hunted. The rich and the noble would fawn upon him; he would have his lovely
  yacht and steam about the summer seas everlastingly, huh?"</p>

  <p>Gurther rose and clicked his heels.</p>

  <p>"Do you desire me again this evening?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, Gurther." The old man shook his head. "And pray remember that
  there is another day to-morrow, and yet another day after. We shall wait and
  hear what our friend has to say. Good night, Gurther."</p>

  <p>"Good night, Herr Doktor."</p>

  <p>The doctor looked at the door for a long time after his man had gone and
  took up his book. He was deep in the chapter which was headed, in the German
  tongue: "The Subconscious Activity of the Human Intellect in Relation to the
  Esoteric Emotions." To Dr. Oberzohn this was more thrilling than the most
  exciting novel.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap26"
     id="chap26">XXVI.&mdash;IN CAPTIVITY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE second day of captivity dawned unseen, in a world that
  lay outside the brick roof and glazed white walls of Mirabelle Leicester's
  prison-house. She had grown in strength and courage, but not so her
  companion, Joan, who had started her weary vigil with an almost cheerful
  gaiety, had sunk deeper and deeper into depression as the hours progressed,
  and Mirabelle woke to the sound of a woman's sobs, to find the girl sitting
  on the side of her bed, her head in her wet hands.</p>

  <p>"I hate this place!" she sobbed. "Why does he keep me here? God! If I
  thought the hound was double-crossing me... ! I'll go mad if they keep me
  here any longer. I will, Leicester!" she screamed.</p>

  <p>"I'll make some tea," said Mirabelle, getting out of bed and finding her
  slippers.</p>

  <p>The girl sat throughout the operation huddled in a miserable heap, and by
  and by her whimpering got on Mirabelle's nerves.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why you should be wretched," she said. "They're not after
  your money!"</p>

  <p>"You can laugh&mdash;and how you can, I don't know," sobbed the girl, as
  she took the cup in her shaking hands. "I know I'm a fool, but I've never
  been locked up&mdash;like this before. I didn't dream he'd break his word. He
  swore he'd come yesterday. What time is it?"</p>

  <p>"Six o'clock," said Mirabelle.</p>

  <p>It might as well have been eight or midday, for all she knew to the
  contrary.</p>

  <p>"This is a filthy place," said the hysterical girl. "I think they're going
  to drown us all... or that thing will explode"&mdash;she pointed to the green
  baize box&mdash;"I know it! I feel it in my blood. That beast Gurther is here
  somewhere, ugh? He's like a slimy snake. Have you ever seen him?"</p>

  <p>"Gurther? You mean the man who danced with me?"</p>

  <p>"That's he. I keep telling you who he is," said Joan impatiently. "I wish
  we could get out of here."</p>

  <p>She jumped up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Come and see if you can help me lift the trap."</p>

  <p>Mirabelle knew it was useless before she set forth on the quest for
  freedom. Their united efforts failed to move the stone, and Joan was on the
  point of collapse when they came back to their sleeping-room.</p>

  <p>"I hope Gurther doesn't know that those men are friends of yours," she
  said, when she became calmer.</p>

  <p>"You told me that yesterday. Would that make any difference?"</p>

  <p>"A whole lot," said Joan vehemently. "He's got the blood of a fish, that
  man! There's nothing he wouldn't do. Monty ought to be flogged for leaving us
  here at his mercy. I'm not scared of Oberzohn&mdash;he's old. But the other
  fellow dopes, and goes stark, staring mad at times. Monty told me one night
  that he was"&mdash;she choked&mdash;"a killer. He said that these German
  criminals who kill people are never satisfied with one murder, they go on and
  on until they've got twenty or thirty! He says that the German prisons are
  filled with men who have the murder habit."</p>

  <p>"He was probably trying to frighten you."</p>

  <p>"Why should he?" said the girl, with unreasonable anger. "And leave him
  alone! Monty is the best in the world. I adore the ground he walks on!"</p>

  <p>Very wisely, Mirabelle did not attempt to traverse this view.</p>

  <p>It was only when her companion had these hysterical fits that fear was
  communicated to her. Her faith was completely and whole-heartedly centred on
  the three men&mdash;upon Gonsalez. She wondered how old he was. Sometimes he
  looked quite young, at others an elderly man. It was difficult to remember
  his face; he owed so much to his expression, the smile in his eyes, to the
  strange, boyish eagerness of gesture and action which accompanied his speech.
  She could not quite understand herself; why was she always thinking of
  Gonsalez, as a maid might think of a lover? She went red at the thought. He
  seemed so apart, so aloof from the ordinary influences of women. Suppose she
  had committed some great crime and had escaped the vigilance of the law,
  would he hunt her down in the same remorseless, eager way, planning to cut
  off every avenue of her escape until he shepherded her into a prison cell? It
  was a horrible thought, and she screwed up her eyes tight to blot out the
  mental picture she had made.</p>

  <p>It would have given her no ordinary satisfaction to have known how often
  Gonsalez's thoughts strayed to the girl who had so strangely come into his
  life. He spent a portion of his time that morning in his bedroom, fixing to
  the wall a large railway map which took in the south of England and the
  greater part of the Continent. A red-ink line marked the route from London to
  Lisbon, and he was fixing a little green flag on the line just south of Paris
  when Manfred strolled into the room and surveyed his work.</p>

  <p>"The Sud Express is about there," he said, pointing to the last of the
  green flags, "and I think our friend will have a fairly pleasant and
  uneventful journey as far as Valladolid&mdash;where I have arranged for
  Miguel Garcia, an old friend of mine, to pick him up and shadow him on the
  westward journey&mdash;unless we get the 'plane. I'm expecting a wire any
  minute. By the way, the Dieppe police have arrested the gentleman who tried
  to bump him overboard in mid-Channel, but the man who snatched at his
  portfolio at the Gare St. Lazare is still at liberty."</p>

  <p>"He must be getting quite used to it now," said Manfred coolly, and
  laughed to himself.</p>

  <p>Leon turned. "He's a good fellow," he said with quick earnestness. "We
  couldn't have chosen a better man. The woman on the train, of course, was
  Gurther. He is the only criminal I've ever known who is really efficient at
  disguising himself."</p>

  <p>Manfred lit his pipe; he had lately taken to this form of smoking. "The
  case grows more and more difficult every day. Do you realize that?"</p>

  <p>Leon nodded. "And more dangerous," he said. "By the laws of average,
  Gurther should get one of us the next time he makes an attempt. Have you seen
  the papers?"</p>

  <p>Manfred smiled.</p>

  <p>"They're crying for Meadows' blood, poor fellow! Which shows the
  extraordinary inconsistency of the public. Meadows has only been in one snake
  case. They credit him with having fallen down on the lot."</p>

  <p>"They seem to be in remarkable agreement that the snake deaths come into
  the category of wilful murder," said Gonsalez as they went down the stairs
  together.</p>

  <p>Meadows had been talking to the reporters. Indeed, that was his chief
  offence from the viewpoint of the official mind. For the first article in the
  code of every well-constituted policeman is, "Thou shalt not communicate to
  the Press."</p>

  <p>Leon strolled aimlessly about the room. He was wearing his chauffeur's
  uniform, and his hands were thrust into the breeches pockets. Manfred,
  recognizing the symptoms, rang the bell for Poiccart, and that quiet man came
  from the lower regions.</p>

  <p>"Leon is going to be mysterious," said Manfred dryly.</p>

  <p>"I'm not really," protested Leon, but he went red. It was one of his most
  charming peculiarities that he had never forgotten how to blush. "I was
  merely going to suggest that there's a play running in London that we ought
  to see. I didn't know that 'The Ringer' was a play until this morning, when I
  saw one of Oberzohn's more genteel clerks go into the theatre, and, being
  naturally of an inquisitive turn of mind, followed him. A play that interests
  Oberzohn will interest me, and should interest you, George," he said
  severely, "and certainly should interest Meadows&mdash;it is full of
  thrilling situations! It is about a criminal who escapes from Dartmoor and
  comes back to murder his betrayer. There is one scene which is played in the
  dark, that ought to thrill you&mdash;I've been looking up the reviews of the
  dramatic critics, and as they are unanimous that it is not an artistic
  success, and is, moreover, wildly improbable, it ought to be worth seeing. I
  always choose an artistic success when I am suffering from insomnia," he
  added cruelly.</p>

  <p>"Oberzohn is entitled to his amusements, however vulgar they may be."</p>

  <p>"But this play isn't vulgar," protested Leon, "except in so far as it is
  popular. I found it most difficult to buy a seat. Even actors go to see the
  audience act."</p>

  <p>"What seat did he buy?"</p>

  <p>"Box A," said Leon promptly, "and paid for it with real money. It is the
  end box on the prompt side&mdash;and before you ask me whence I gained my
  amazing knowledge of theatrical technique, I will answer that even a child in
  arms knows that the prompt side is the left-hand side facing the
  audience."</p>

  <p>"For to-night?"</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have three stalls," he said and produced them from his pocket. "If you
  cannot go, will you give them to the cook? She looks like a woman who would
  enjoy a good cry over the sufferings of the tortured heroine. The seats are
  in the front row, which means that you can get in and out between the acts
  without walking on other people's knees."</p>

  <p>"Must I go?" asked Poiccart plaintively. "I do not like detective plays,
  and I hate mystery plays. I know who the real murderer is before the curtain
  has been up ten minutes, and that naturally spoils my evening."</p>

  <p>"Could you not take a girl?" asked Leon outrageously. "Do you know any who
  would go?"</p>

  <p>"Why not take Aunt Alma?" suggested Manfred, and Leon accepted the name
  joyously.</p>

  <p>Aunt Alma had come to town at the suggestion of the Three, and had opened
  up the Doughty Court flat.</p>

  <p>"And really she is a remarkable woman, and shows a steadiness and a
  courage in face of the terrible position of our poor little friend, which is
  altogether praiseworthy. I don't think Mirabelle Leicester is in any
  immediate danger. I think I've said that before. Oberzohn merely wishes to
  keep her until the period of renewal has expired. How he will escape the
  consequences of imprisoning her, I cannot guess. He may not attempt to escape
  them, may accept the term of imprisonment which will certainly be handed out
  to him, as part of the payment he must pay for his millions."</p>

  <p>"Suppose he kills her?" asked Poiccart.</p>

  <p>For a second Leon's face twitched.</p>

  <p>"He won't kill her," he said quietly. "Why should he? We know that he has
  got her&mdash;the police know. She is a different proposition from Barberton,
  an unknown man killed nobody knew how, in a public place. No, I don't think
  we need cross that bridge, only... " He rubbed his hands together irritably.
  "However, we shall see. And in the meantime I'm placing a lot of faith in
  Digby, a shrewd man with a sense of his previous shortcomings. You were wise
  there, George."</p>

  <p>He was looking at the street through the curtains.</p>

  <p>"Tittlemouse is at his post, the faithful hound!" he said, nodding towards
  the solitary taxicab that stood on the rank. "I wonder whether he
  expects&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Manfred saw a light creep into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Will you want me for the next two hours?" Leon asked quickly, and was out
  of the room in a flash.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later, Poiccart and George were talking together when they
  heard the street door close, and saw Leon stroll to the edge of the pavement
  and wave his umbrella. The taxi-driver was suddenly a thing of quivering
  excitement. He leaned down, cranked his engine, climbed back into his seat
  and brought the car up quicker than any taxicab driver had ever moved
  before.</p>

  <p>"New Scotland Yard," said Leon, and got into the machine.</p>

  <p>The cab passed through the forbidding gates of the Yard and dropped him at
  the staff entrance.</p>

  <p>"Wait here," said Leon, and the man shifted uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"I've got to be back at my garage&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"I shall not be five minutes," said Leon.</p>

  <p>Meadows was in his room, fortunately.</p>

  <p>"I want you to pull in this man and give him a dose of the third degree
  you keep in this country," said Leon. "He carries a gun; I saw that when he
  had to get down to crank up his cab in Piccadilly Circus. The engine
  stopped."</p>

  <p>"What do you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"All that there is to be known about Oberzohn. I may have missed one or
  two things. I've seen him outside the house. Oberzohn employs him for odd
  jobs and occasionally he acts as the old man's chauffeur. In fact, he drove
  the machine the day Miss Leicester lunched with Oberzohn at the Ritz-Carlton.
  He may not have a cabman's licence, and that will make it all the easier for
  you."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, a very surprised and wrathful man was marched into
  Cannon Row and scientifically searched. Leon had been right about the
  revolver; it was produced and found to be loaded, and his excuse that he
  carried the weapon as a protection following upon a recent murder of a
  cab-driver had not the backing of the necessary permit. In addition&mdash;and
  this was a more serious offence&mdash;he held no permit from Scotland Yard to
  ply for hire on the streets, and his badge was the property of another
  man.</p>

  <p>"Put him inside," said Meadows, and went back to report to the waiting
  Leon. "You've hit the bull's-eye first time. I don't know whether he will be
  of any use to us, but I don't despise even the smallest fish."</p>

  <p>Whilst he was waiting, Leon had been engaged in some quick thinking.</p>

  <p>"The man has been at Greenwich lately. One of my men saw him there twice,
  and I needn't say that he was driving Oberzohn."</p>

  <p>"I'll talk to him later and telephone you," said Meadows, and Leon
  Gonsalez went back to Curzon Street, one large smile.</p>

  <p>"You have merely exchanged a spy you know for a spy you don't know," said
  George Manfred, "though I never question these freakish acts of yours, Leon.
  So often they have a trick of turning up trumps. By the way, the police are
  raiding the Gringo Club in the Victoria Dock Road to-night, and they may be
  able to pick up a few of Mr. Oberzohn's young gentlemen who are certain to be
  regular users of the place."</p>

  <p>The telephone bell rang shrilly, and Leon took up the receiver, and
  recognized Meadows' voice.</p>

  <p>"I've got a queer story for you," said the inspector immediately.</p>

  <p>"Did he talk?" asked the interested Leon.</p>

  <p>"After a while. We took a finger-print impression, and found that he was
  on the register. More than that, he is a ticket-of-leave man. As an
  ex-convict we can send him back to finish his unexpired time. I promised to
  say a few words for him, and he spilt everything. The most interesting item
  is that Oberzohn is planning to be married."</p>

  <p>"To be married? Who is this?" asked Manfred, in surprise. "Oberzohn?"</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>"Who is the unfortunate lady?" asked Leon.</p>

  <p>There was a pause, and then:</p>

  <p>"Miss Leicester."</p>

  <p>Manfred saw the face of his friend change colour, and guessed.</p>

  <p>"Does he know when?" asked Leon in a different voice.</p>

  <p>"No. The licence was issued over a week ago, which means that Oberzohn can
  marry any morning he likes to bring along his bride. What's the idea, do you
  think?"</p>

  <p>"Drop in this evening and either I or George will tell you," said
  Leon.</p>

  <p>He put the telephone on the hook very carefully.</p>

  <p>"That is a danger I had not foreseen, although it was obviously the only
  course Oberzohn could take. If he marries her, she cannot be called in
  evidence against him. May I see the book, George?"</p>

  <p>Manfred unlocked the wall safe and brought back a small ledger. Leo
  Gonsalez turned the pages thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Dennis&mdash;he has done good work for us, hasn't he?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's a very reliable man. He owes us, amongst other things, his
  life. Do you remember, his wife was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I remember." Leon scribbled the address of a man who had proved to be one
  of the most trustworthy of his agents.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" asked Manfred.</p>

  <p>"I've put Dennis on the doorstep of the Greenwich registrar's office from
  nine o'clock in the morning until half-past three in the afternoon, and he
  will have instructions from me that, the moment he sees Oberzohn walk out of
  a cab with a lady, he must push him firmly but gently under the wheels of the
  cab and ask the driver politely to move up a yard."</p>

  <p>Leon in his more extravagantly humorous moods was very often in deadly
  earnest.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap27"
     id="chap27">XXVII.&mdash;MR. NEWTON'S DILEMMA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE most carefully guided streaks of luck may, in spite of
  all precautions, overflow into the wrong channel, and this had happened to
  Mr. Montague Newton, producing an evening that was financially disastrous and
  a night from which sleep was almost banished. He had had one of his little
  card parties; but whether it was the absence of Joan, and the inadequacy of
  her fluffy-haired substitute, or whether the wine had disagreed with one of
  the most promising victims, the result was the same. They had played chemin
  de fer, and the gilded pigeon, whose feathers seemed already to be
  ornamenting the headdress of Monty Newton, had been successful, and when he
  should have been signing cheques for large amounts, he was cashing his
  counters with a reluctant host.</p>

  <p>The night started wrong with Joan's substitute, whose name was Lisa. She
  had guided to the establishment, via an excellent dinner at Mero's, the son
  of an African millionaire. Joan, of course, would have brought him alone, but
  Lisa, less experienced, had allowed a young-looking friend of the victim to
  attach himself to the party, and she had even expected praise for her
  perspicacity and enterprise in producing two birds for the stone which Mr.
  Newton so effectively wielded, instead of one.</p>

  <p>Monty did not resent the presence of the new-corner, and rather took the
  girl's view, until he learnt that Lisa's "find" was not, as she had believed,
  an officer of the Guards, but a sporting young lawyer with a large criminal
  practice, and one who had already, as a junior, conducted several
  prosecutions for the Crown. The moment his name was mentioned, Monty groaned
  in spirit. He was, moreover, painfully sober. His friend was not so
  favourably situated.</p>

  <p>That was the first of the awkward things to happen. The second was the bad
  temper of the player, who, when the bank was considerably over £3,000, had
  first of all insisted upon the cards being reshuffled, and then he had gone
  banquo&mdash;the game being baccarat. Even this contretemps might have been
  overcome, but after he had expressed his willingness to "give it," the card
  which Monty had so industriously palmed slipped from his hand to the table,
  and though the fact was unnoticed by the players, the lawyer's attention
  being diverted at the moment, it was impossible to recover that very valuable
  piece of pasteboard. And Monty had done a silly thing. Instead of staging an
  artistic exhibition of annoyance at remarks which the millionaire's son had
  made, he decided to take a chance on the natural run of the cards. And he had
  lost. On top of that, the slightly inebriated player had decided that when a
  man had won a coup of £3,000 it was time to stop playing. So Monty
  experienced the mortification of paying out money, and accompanying his
  visitor to the door with a smile that was so genial and so full of
  good-fellowship that the young gentleman was compelled to apologize for his
  boorish-ness.</p>

  <p>"Come along some other night and give me my revenge," said Monty.</p>

  <p>"You bet I will! I'm going to South Africa to-morrow, but I shall be back
  early next year, and I'll look you up."</p>

  <p>Monty watched him going down the steps and hoped he would break his
  neck.</p>

  <p>He was worried about Joan&mdash;more worried than he thought it was
  possible for him to be about so light a girl. She was necessary to him in
  many ways. Lisa was a bungling fool, he decided, though he sent her home
  without hurting her feelings. She was a useful girl in many ways, and nothing
  spoils a tout quicker than constant nagging.</p>

  <p>He felt very lonely in the house, and wandered from room to room,
  irritated with himself that the absence of this featherbrained girl, who had
  neither the education nor the breed of his own class, should make such a big
  difference. And it did; he had to admit as much to himself. He hated the
  thought of that underground room. He knew something of her temperament, and
  how soon her experience would get on her nerves. In many respects he wished
  he did not feel that way about her, because she had a big shock coming, and
  it was probably because he foresaw this hurt that he was anxious to make the
  present as happy as he could for her.</p>

  <p>After he had done what he was to do, there was no reason in the world why
  they should be bad friends, and he would give her a big present. Girls of
  that class soon forget their miseries if the present is large enough. Thus he
  argued, tossing from side to side in his bed, and all the time his thoughts
  playing about that infernal cellar. What she must be feeling! He did not
  worry at all about Mirabelle, because&mdash;well, she was a principal in the
  case. To him, Joan was the real victim.</p>

  <p>Sleep did not come until daybreak, and he woke in his most irritable frame
  of mind. He had promised the girl he would call and see her, though he had
  privately arranged with Oberzohn not to go to the house until the expiry of
  the five days.</p>

  <p>By lunch-time he could stand the worry no longer, and, ordering his car,
  drove to a point between New Cross and Bermondsey, walking on foot the
  remainder of the distance. Mr. Oberzohn expected the visit. He had a shrewd
  knowledge of his confederate's mental outfit, and when he saw this
  well-dressed man picking a dainty way across the littered ground, he strolled
  out on the steps to meet him.</p>

  <p>"It is curious you should have come," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you telephone?" growled Newton. This was his excuse for the
  visit.</p>

  <p>"Because there are human machines at the end of every wire," said
  Oberzohn. "If they were automatic and none could listen, but you and I, we
  would talk and talk and then talk! All day long would I speak with you and
  find it a pleasure. But not with Miss This and Miss That saying, 'One moment,
  if you please,' and saying to the Scotland Yard man, 'Now you cut in'!"</p>

  <p>"Is Gurther back?"</p>

  <p>"Gurther is back," said the doctor soberly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing happened to that bird? At least, I saw nothing in the evening
  papers."</p>

  <p>"He has gone to Lisbon," replied the doctor indifferently. "Perhaps he
  will get there, perhaps he will not&mdash;what does it matter? I should like
  to see the letter, because it is data, and data has an irresistible charm for
  a poor old scientist. You will have a drink?"</p>

  <p>Monty hesitated, as he always did when Oberzohn offered him refreshment.
  You could never be sure with Oberzohn.</p>

  <p>"I'll have a whisky," he said at last, "a full bottle&mdash;one that
  hasn't been opened. I'll open it myself."</p>

  <p>The doctor chuckled unevenly.</p>

  <p>"You do not trust?" he said. "I think you are wise. For who is there in
  this world of whom a man can say, 'He is my friend. To the very end of my
  life I will have confidence in him'?"</p>

  <p>Monty did not feel that the question called for an answer.</p>

  <p>He took the whisky bottle to the light, examined the cork and drove in the
  corkscrew.</p>

  <p>"The soda water&mdash;that also might be poisoned," said Dr. Oberzohn
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>At any other time he would not have made that observation. That he said it
  at all betrayed a subtle but ominous change in their relationship. If Monty
  noticed this, he did not say a word, but filled his glass and sat down on the
  sofa to drink. And all the time the doctor was watching him interestedly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Gurther is back. He failed, but you must excuse failure in a good
  man. The perfect agent has yet to be found, and the perfect principal also.
  The American, Washington, had left Paris when I last heard of him. He is to
  be congratulated. If I myself lived in Paris I should always be leaving. It
  is a frivolous city."</p>

  <p>Monty lit a cigar, and decided to arrive at the object of his visit by
  stages. For he had come to perform two important duties. He accounted as a
  duty a call upon Joan. No less was it a duty, and something of a relief also,
  to make his plan known to his partner.</p>

  <p>"How are the girls?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They are very happy," said Dr. Oberzohn, who had not resumed his seat,
  but stood in an attitude somewhat reminiscent of Gurther, erect, staring,
  motionless. "Always my guests are happy."</p>

  <p>"In that dog-hole?" said the other contemptuously. "I don't want Joan to
  be here."</p>

  <p>The Herr Doktor shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Then take her away, my friend," he said. "Why should she stay, if you are
  unhappy because this woman is not with you? She serves no purpose. Possibly
  she is fretting. By all means&mdash;I will bring her to you." He moved to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," said Monty. "I'll see her later and take her out perhaps,
  but I don't want her to be away permanently. Somebody ought to stay with that
  girl."</p>

  <p>"Why? Am I not here?" asked Oberzohn blandly.</p>

  <p>"You're here, and Gurther's here." Monty was looking out of the window and
  did not meet the doctor's eyes. "Especially Gurther. That's why I think that
  Mirabelle Leicester should have somebody to look after her. Has it ever
  struck you that the best way out of this little trouble
  is&mdash;marriage?"</p>

  <p>"I have thought that," said the doctor. "You also have thought it? This is
  wonderful! You are beginning to think."</p>

  <p>The change of tone was noticeable enough now. Monty snapped round at the
  man who had hitherto stood in apparent awe of him and his judgments.</p>

  <p>"You can cut that sarcasm right out, Oberzohn," he said, and, without
  preamble: "I'm going to marry that girl." Oberzohn said nothing to this.
  "She's not engaged; she's got no love affairs at all. Joan told me, and Joan
  is a pretty shrewd girl. I don't know how I'm going to fix it, but I guess
  the best thing I can do is to pretend that I am a real friend and get her out
  of your cellar. She'll be so grateful that maybe she will agree to almost
  anything. Besides, I think I made an impression the first time I saw her. And
  I've got a position to offer her, Oberzohn: a house in the best part of
  London&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My house," interrupted Oberzohn's metallic voice.</p>

  <p>"Your house? Well, our house, let us say. We're not going to quarrel about
  terms,"</p>

  <p>"I also have a position to offer her, and I do not offer her any other
  man's."</p>

  <p>Oberzohn was looking at him wide-eyed, a comical figure; his elongated
  face seemed to stand out in the gloom like a pantomime mask.</p>

  <p>"You?" Monty could hardly believe his ears.</p>

  <p>"I, Baron Eruc Oberzohn."</p>

  <p>"A baron, are you?" The room shook with Monty's laughter. "Why, you damned
  old fool, you don't imagine she'd marry you, do you?"</p>

  <p>Oberzohn nodded.</p>

  <p>"She would do anythings what I felt her." In his agitation his English was
  getting a little ragged. "A girl may not like a mans, but she might hate
  something worse&mdash;you understand? A woman says death is nothing, but a
  woman is afeard of death, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"You're crazy," said Monty scornfully.</p>

  <p>"I am crazy, am I? And a damned old fool also&mdash;yes? Yet I shall marry
  her."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence, and then Oberzohn continued the conversation,
  but on a much calmer note.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am what you call me, but it is not a thing worthy for two
  friends to quarrel. To-morrow you shall come here, and we will discuss this
  matter like a business proposition, hein?"</p>

  <p>Monty examined him as though he were a strange insect that had wandered
  into his ken.</p>

  <p>"You're not a Swede, you're German," he said. "That baron stuff gave you
  away."</p>

  <p>"I am from the Baltic, but I have lived many years in Sweden," said
  Oberzohn shortly. "I am not German: I do not like them."</p>

  <p>More than this he would not say. Possibly he shared Gurther's repugnance
  towards his sometime neighbours.</p>

  <p>"We shall not quarrel, anyway," he continued. "I am a fool, you are a
  fool, we are all fools. You wish to see your woman?"</p>

  <p>"I wish to see Joan," said Monty gruffly. "I don't like that 'your woman'
  line of yours."</p>

  <p>"I will go get her. You wait."</p>

  <p>Again the long boots came from under the table, were dragged on to the
  doctor's awkward feet, and Monty watched him from the window as he crossed to
  the factory and disappeared.</p>

  <p>He was gone five minutes before he came out again, alone. Monty frowned.
  What was the reason for this?</p>

  <p>"My friend," panted Oberzohn, to whom these exertions were becoming more
  and more irksome, "it is not wise."</p>

  <p>"I want to see her&mdash;" began Monty.</p>

  <p>"Gently, gently; you shall see her. But on the canal bank Gurther has also
  seen a stranger, who has been walking up and down, pretending to fish. Who
  can fish in a canal, I ask you?"</p>

  <p>"What is he to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Would it be wise to bring her in daylight, I ask you again? Do not the
  men think that your&mdash;that this girl is in Brussels?"</p>

  <p>This had not occurred to Monty.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea for you. It is a good idea. The brain of old fool Oberzohn
  sometimes works remarkably. This morning a friend sent to me a ticket for a
  theatre. Now you shall take her to-night. There is always a little fog when
  the sun is setting and you can leave the house in a car. Presently I will
  send a man to attract this watcher's attention, and then I will bring her to
  the house and you can call for her."</p>

  <p>"I will wait for her." Monty was dogged on this point.</p>

  <p>And wait he did, until an hour later a half-crazy girl came flying into
  the room and into his arms.</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn witnessed the reunion unmoved.</p>

  <p>"That is a pretty scene for me," he said, "for one to be so soon married,"
  and he left them alone.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>"Monty, I can't possibly go back to that beastly place tonight. She'll
  have to stay by herself. And she's not a bad kid Monty, but she doesn't know
  she's worth a lot of money."</p>

  <p>"Have you been talking to her?" he asked angrily. "I told you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I've only just asked her a few questions. You can't be in a poky hole
  like that, thrown together day and night, without talking, can you? Monty,
  you're absolutely sure nothing can happen to her?"</p>

  <p>Monty cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"The worst thing that can happen to her," he said, "is to get
  married."</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes at this.</p>

  <p>"Does somebody want to marry her?"</p>

  <p>"Oberzohn," he said.</p>

  <p>"That old thing!" she scoffed.</p>

  <p>Again he found a difficulty in speaking.</p>

  <p>"I have been thinking it over, honey," he said. "Marriage doesn't mean a
  whole lot to anybody."</p>

  <p>"It'll mean a lot to me," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I married her?" he blurted.</p>

  <p>"You!" She stepped back from him in horror.</p>

  <p>"Only just a... well, this is the truth, Joan. It may be the only way to
  get her money. Now you're in on this graft, and you know what you are to me.
  A marriage&mdash;a formal marriage&mdash;for a year or two, and then a
  divorce, and we could go away together, man and wife."</p>

  <p>"Is that what he meant?" She jerked her head to the door. "About 'married
  so soon'?"</p>

  <p>"He wants to marry her himself."</p>

  <p>"Let him," she said viciously. "Do you think I care about money? Isn't
  there any other way of getting it?"</p>

  <p>He was silent. There were too many other ways of getting it for him to
  advance a direct negative.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Monty, you're not going to do that?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I'm going to do yet," he said.</p>

  <p>"But not that?" she insisted, clinging to him by his coat.</p>

  <p>"We'll talk about it to-night. The old man's got us tickets for the
  theatre. We'll have a bit of dinner up West and go on, and it really doesn't
  matter if anybody sees us, because they know very well you're not in
  Brussels. What is that queer scent you've got?"</p>

  <p>Joan laughed, forgetting for the moment the serious problem which faced
  her.</p>

  <p>"Joss-sticks," she said. "The place got so close and stuffy, and I found
  them in the pantry with the provisions. As a matter of fact, it was a silly
  thing to do, because we had the place full of smoke. It's gone now, though.
  Monty, you do these crazy things when you're locked up," she said seriously.
  "I don't think I can go back again."</p>

  <p>"Go back to-morrow," he almost pleaded. "It's only for two or three days,
  and it means a lot to me. Especially now that Oberzohn has ideas."</p>

  <p>"You're not going to think any more about&mdash;about marrying her, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"We'll talk of it to-night at dinner. I thought you'd like the idea of the
  graft," he added untruthfully.</p>

  <p>Joan had to return to her prison to collect some of her belongings. She
  found the girl lying on the bed, reading, and Mirabelle greeted her with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, is your term of imprisonment ended?"</p>

  <p>Joan hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly. Do you mind if I'm not here to-night?"</p>

  <p>Mirabelle shook her head. If the truth be told, she was glad to be alone.
  All that day she had been forced to listen to the plaints and weepings of
  this transfigured girl, and she felt that she could not well stand another
  twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>"You're sure you won't mind being alone?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course not. I shall miss you," added Mirabelle, more in truth than
  in compliment. "When will you return?"</p>

  <p>The girl made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow."</p>

  <p>"You don't want to come back, naturally? Have you succeeded in persuading
  your&mdash;your friend to let me out too?"</p>

  <p>Joan shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He'll never do that, my dear, not till... " She looked at the girl.
  "You're not engaged, are you?"</p>

  <p>"I? No. Is that another story they've heard?" Mirabelle got up from the
  bed, laughing. "An heiress, and engaged?"</p>

  <p>"No, they don't say you were engaged." Joan hastened to correct the wrong
  impression. There was genuine admiration in her voice when she said: "You're
  wonderful, kid! If I were in your shoes I'd be quaking. You're just as
  cheerful as though you were going to the funeral of a rich aunt!"</p>

  <p>She did not know how near to a breakdown her companion had been that day,
  and Mirabelle, who felt stronger and saner now, had no desire to tell
  her.</p>

  <p>"You're rather splendid," Joan nodded. "I wish I had your pluck."</p>

  <p>And then, impulsively, she came forward and kissed the girl.</p>

  <p>"Don't feel too sore at me," she said, and was gone before Mirabelle could
  make a reply.</p>

  <p>The doctor was waiting for her in the factory.</p>

  <p>"The spy has walked up to the canal bridge. We can go forward," he said.
  "Besides"&mdash;he had satisfaction out of this&mdash;"he cannot see over
  high walls."</p>

  <p>"What is this story about marrying Mirabelle Leicester?"</p>

  <p>"So he has told you? Also did he tell you that&mdash;that he is going to
  marry her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I'll tell you something, doctor. I'd rather he married her than
  you."</p>

  <p>"So!" said the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather anybody else married her, except that snake of yours."</p>

  <p>Oberzohn looked round sharply. She had used the word quite innocently,
  without any thought of its application, and uttered an "Oh!" of dismay when
  she realized her mistake.</p>

  <p>"I meant Gurther," she said.</p>

  <p>"Well, I know you meant Gurther, young miss," he said stiffly.</p>

  <p>To get back to the house they had to make a half-circle of the factory and
  pass between the canal wall and the building itself. The direct route would
  have taken them into a deep hollow into which the debris of years had been
  thrown, and which now Nature, in her kindness, had hidden under a green
  mantle of wild convolvulus. It was typical of the place that the only
  beautiful picture in the grounds was out of sight.</p>

  <p>They were just turning the corner of the factory when the doctor stopped
  and looked up at the high wall, which was protected by a cheval de frise of
  broken glass. All except in one spot, about two feet wide, where not only the
  glass but the mortar which held it in place had been chipped off. There were
  fragments of the glass, and, on the inside of the wall, marks of some
  implement on the hard surface of the mortar.</p>

  <p>"So!" said the doctor.</p>

  <p>He was examining the scratches on the wall.</p>

  <p>"Wait," he ordered, and hurried back into the factory, to return, carrying
  in each hand two large rusty contraptions which he put on the ground.</p>

  <p>One by one he forced open the jagged rusty teeth until they were wide
  apart and held by a spring catch. She had seen things like that in a museum.
  They were man-traps&mdash;relics of the barbarous days when trespass was not
  only a sin but a crime.</p>

  <p>He fixed the second of the traps on the path between the factory and the
  wall.</p>

  <p>"Now we shall see," he said. "Forward!"</p>

  <p>Monty was waiting for her impatiently. The Rolls had been turned out in
  her honour, and the sulky-looking driver was already in his place at the
  wheel.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with that chauffeur?" she asked, as they bumped up the
  lane towards easier going. "He looks so happy that I shouldn't be surprised
  to hear that his mother was hanged this morning."</p>

  <p>"He's sore with the old man," explained Monty. "Oberzohn has two drivers.
  They do a little looking round in the morning. The other fellow was supposed
  to come back to take over duty at three o'clock, and he hasn't turned up. He
  was the better driver of the two."</p>

  <p>The chauffeur was apparently seeking every pothole in the ground, and in
  the next five minutes she was alternately clutching the support of the
  arm-strap and Monty. They were relieved when at last the car found a metal
  road and began its noiseless way towards the lights. And then her hand sought
  his, and for a moment this beautiful flower which had grown in such foul
  soil, bloomed in the radiance of a love common to every woman, high and low,
  good and bad.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap28"
     id="chap28">XXVIII.&mdash;AT PRATER'S</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MANFRED suggested an early dinner at the Lasky, where the
  soup was to his fastidious taste. Leon, who had eaten many crumpets for
  tea&mdash;he had a weakness for this indigestible article of diet&mdash;was
  prepared to dispense with the dinner, and Poiccart had views, being a man of
  steady habits. They dined at the Lasky, and Leon ordered a baked onion, and
  expatiated upon the two wasted years of Poiccart's life, employing a wealth
  of imagery and a beauty of diction worthy of a better subject.</p>

  <p>Manfred looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Where are they dining?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know yet," said Leon. "Our friend will be here in a few minutes:
  when we go out he will tell us. You don't want to see her?"</p>

  <p>Manfred shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to be bored," complained Poiccart.</p>

  <p>"Then you should have let me bring Alma," said Leon promptly.</p>

  <p>"Exactly." Raymond nodded his sober head. "I have the feeling that I am
  saving a lady from an unutterably dreary evening."</p>

  <p>There was a man waiting for them when they came out of the
  restaurant&mdash;a very uninteresting-looking man who had three sentences to
  say sotto voce as they stood near him, but apparently in ignorance of his
  presence.</p>

  <p>"I did not wish to go to Mero's," said Manfred, "but as we have the time,
  I think it would be advisable to stroll in that direction. I am curious to
  discover whether this is really Oberzohn's little treat, or whether the idea
  emanated from the unadmirable Mr. Newton."</p>

  <p>"And how will you know, George?" asked Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>"By the car. If Oberzohn is master of the ceremonies, we shall find his
  machine parked somewhere in the neighbourhood. If it is Newton's idea, then
  Oberzohn's limousine, which brought them from South London, will have
  returned, and Newton's car will be in its place."</p>

  <p>Mero's was one of the most fashionable of dining clubs, patronized not
  only by the elite of society, but having on its books the cream of the
  theatrical world. It was situated in one of those quiet, old-world squares
  which are to be found in the very heart of London, enjoying, for some
  mysterious reason, immunity from the hands of the speculative property owner.
  The square retained the appearance it had in the days of the Georges; and
  though some of the fine mansions had been given over to commerce and the
  professions, and the lawyer and the manufacturer's agent occupied the
  drawing-rooms and bedrooms sacred to the bucks and beauties of other days,
  quite a large number of the houses remained in private occupation.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in the fascia of Mero's to advertise its character. The
  club premises consisted of three of these fine old dwellings. The uninitiated
  might not even suspect that there was communication between the three houses,
  for the old doorways and doorsteps remained untouched, though only one was
  used.</p>

  <p>They strolled along two sides of the square before, amidst the phalanx of
  cars that stood wheel to wheel, their backs to the railings of the centre
  gardens, they saw Oberzohn's car. The driver sat with his arms folded on the
  wheel, in earnest conversation with a pale-faced man, slightly and neatly
  bearded, and dressed in faultless evening dress. He was evidently a cripple:
  one shoulder was higher than the other; and when he moved, he walked
  painfully with the aid of a stick.</p>

  <p>Manfred saw the driver point up the line of cars, and the lame gentleman
  limped in the direction the chauffeur had indicated and stopped to speak to
  another man in livery. As they came abreast of him, they saw that one of his
  boots had a thick sole, and the limp was explained.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman has lost his car," said Manfred, for now he was peering
  short-sightedly at the number-plates.</p>

  <p>The theft of cars was a daily occurrence. Leon had something to say on the
  potentialities of that branch of crime. He owned to an encyclopaedic
  knowledge of the current fashions in wrongdoing, and in a few brief sentences
  indicated the extent of these thefts.</p>

  <p>"Fifty a week are shipped to India and the Colonies, after their numbers
  are erased and another substituted. In some cases the 'knockers off,' as they
  call the thieves, drive them straightway into the packing-cases which are
  prepared for every make of car; the ends are nailed up, and they are waiting
  shipment at the docks before the owner is certain of his loss. There are
  almost as many stolen cars in India, South Africa and Australia as there are
  honest ones!"</p>

  <p>They walked slowly past the decorous portals of Mero's, and caught a
  glimpse, through the curtained windows, of soft table lamps burning, of
  bare-armed women and white-shirted men, and heard faintly the strains of an
  orchestra playing a Viennese waltz.</p>

  <p>"I should like to see our Jane," said Gonsalez. "She never came to you,
  did she?"</p>

  <p>"She came, but I didn't see her," said Manfred. "From the moment she
  leaves the theatre she must not be left."</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have already made that arrangement," he said. "Digby&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Digby takes up his duty at midnight," said Manfred. "He has been down to
  Oberzohn's place to get the lie of the land: he thought it advisable that he
  should study the topography in daylight, and I agreed. He might get himself
  into an awkward tangle if he started exploring the canal bank in the dark
  hours. Summer or winter, there is usually a mist on the water."</p>

  <p>They reached Prater's theatre so early that the queues at the pit door
  were still unadmitted, and Leon suggested that they make a circuit of this
  rambling house of entertainment. It stood in Shaftesbury Avenue and occupied
  an island site. On either side two narrow streets flanked the building,
  whilst the rear formed the third side of a small square, one of which was
  taken up by a County Council dwelling, mainly occupied by artisans. From the
  square a long passageway led to Cranbourn Street; whilst, in addition to the
  alley which opened just at the back of the theatre, a street ran parallel to
  Shaftesbury Avenue from Charing Cross Road to Rupert Street.</p>

  <p>The theatre itself was one of the best in London, and although it had had
  a succession of failures, its luck had turned, and the new mystery play was
  drawing all London.</p>

  <p>"That is the stage door," said Leon&mdash;they had reached the
  square&mdash;"and those are emergency exits"&mdash;he pointed back the way
  they had come&mdash;"which are utilized at the end of a performance to empty
  the theatre."</p>

  <p>"Why are you taking such an interest in the theatre itself?" asked
  Poiccart.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Gonsalez slowly, "I am in agreement with George. We should
  have found Newton's car parked in Fitzreeve Gardens&mdash;not Oberzohn's. And
  the circumstances are a little suspicious."</p>

  <p>The doors of the pit and gallery were open now; the queues were moving
  slowly to the entrances; and they watched the great building swallow up the
  devotees of the drama, before they returned to the front of the house.</p>

  <p>Cars were beginning to arrive, at first at intervals, but, as the hour of
  the play's beginning approached, in a ceaseless line that made a congestion
  and rendered the traffic police articulate and occasionally unkind. It was
  short of the half-hour after eight when Manfred saw Oberzohn's glistening car
  in the block, and presently it pulled up before the entrance of the theatre.
  First Joan and then Monty Newton alighted and passed out of view.</p>

  <p>Gonsalez thought he had never seen the girl looking quite as radiantly
  pretty. She had the colouring and the shape of youth, and though the more
  fastidious might object to her daring toilette, the most cantankerous could
  not cavil at the pleasing effect.</p>

  <p>"It is a great pity"&mdash;Leon spoke in Spanish&mdash;"a thousand pities!
  I have the same feeling when I see a perfect block of marble placed in the
  hands of a tombstone-maker to be mangled into ugliness!"</p>

  <p>Manfred put out his hand and drew him back into the shadow. A cab was
  dropping the lame man. He got out with the aid of a linkman, paid the driver,
  and limped into the vestibule. It was not a remarkable coincidence: the
  gentleman had evidently come from Mero's, and as all London was flocking to
  the drama, there was little that was odd in finding him here. They saw that
  he went up into the dress circle, and later, when they took their places in
  the stalls, Leon, glancing up, saw the pale, bearded face and noted that he
  occupied the end seat of the front row.</p>

  <p>"I've met that man somewhere," he said, irritated. "Nothing annoys me
  worse than to forget, not a face, but where I have seen it!"</p>

  <p>Did Gurther but know, he had achieved the height of his ambition: he had
  twice passed under the keen scrutiny of the cleverest detectives in the
  world, and had remained unrecognized.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap29"
     id="chap29">XXIX.&mdash;WORK FOR GURTHER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">GURTHER was sleeping when he was called for duty, but
  presented himself before his director as bright and alert as though he had
  not spent a sleepless night, nor yet had endured the strain of a midnight
  train jump.</p>

  <p>"Once more, my Gurther, I send you forth." Dr. Oberzohn was almost gay.
  "This time to save us all from the Judas treachery of one we thought was our
  friend. To-night the snake must bite, and bite hard, Gurther. And out into
  the dark goes the so-called Trusted! And after that, my brave boy, there
  shall be nothing to fear."</p>

  <p>He paused for approval, and got it in a snapped agreement.</p>

  <p>"To-night we desire from you a chef d'oeuvre, the supreme employment of
  your great art, Gurther; the highest expression of genius! The gentleman-club
  manner will not do. They may look for you and find you. Better it should be,
  this time, that you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Herr Doktor, will you graciously permit me to offer a humble suggestion?"
  said Gurther eagerly.</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"You may speak, Gurther," he said. "You are a man of intelligence; I would
  not presume to dictate to an artist."</p>

  <p>"Let me go for an hour, perhaps two hours, and I will return to you with a
  manner that is unique. Is it graciously permitted, Herr Doktor?"</p>

  <p>"March!" said the doctor graciously, waving his hand to the door.</p>

  <p>Nearly an hour and a half passed before the door opened and a gentleman
  came in who for a moment even the doctor thought was a stranger. The face had
  an unearthly ivory pallor; the black brows, the faint shadows beneath the
  eyes that suggested a recent illness, the close-cropped black beard in which
  grey showed&mdash;these might not have deceived him. But the man was
  obviously the victim of some appalling accident of the past. One shoulder was
  hunched, the hand that held the stick was distorted out of shape, and as he
  moved, the clump of his club foot advertised his lameness.</p>

  <p>"Sir, you desire to see me&mdash;?" began the doctor, and then stared
  open-mouthed. "It is not... !"</p>

  <p>Gurther smiled.</p>

  <p>"Herr Doktor, are you condescendingly pleased?"</p>

  <p>"Colossal!" murmured Oberzohn, gazing in amazement. "Of all
  accomplishments this is supreme! Gurther, you are an artist. Some day we
  shall buy a theatre for you in Unter den Linden, and you shall thrill large
  audiences."</p>

  <p>"Herr Doktor, this is my own idea; this I have planned for many months.
  The boots I made myself; even the coat I altered"&mdash;he patted his
  deformed shoulder proudly.</p>

  <p>"An eyeglass?"</p>

  <p>"I have it," said Gurther promptly.</p>

  <p>"The cravat&mdash;is it not too proper?"</p>

  <p>Gurther fingered his tie.</p>

  <p>"For the grand habit I respectfully claim that the proper tie is
  desirable, if you will graciously permit."</p>

  <p>The Herr Doktor nodded.</p>

  <p>"You shall go with God, Gurther," he said piously, took a golden
  cigarette-case from his pocket and handed it to the man. "Sit down, my dear
  friend."</p>

  <p>He rose and pointed to the chair he had vacated.</p>

  <p>"In my own chair, Gurther. Nothing is too good for you. Now here is the
  arrangement... "</p>

  <p>Step by step he unfolded the time-table, for chronology was almost as
  great a passion with this strange and wicked man as it was with Aunt
  Alma.</p>

  <p>So confident was Gurther of his disguise that he had gone in the open to
  speak to Oberzohn's chauffeur, and out of the tail of his eye he had seen
  Manfred and Gonsalez approaching. It was the supreme test and was passed with
  credit to himself.</p>

  <p>He did not dine at Mero's; Gurther never ate or drank when he was wearing
  a disguise, knowing just how fatal that occupation could be. Instead, he had
  called a taxi, and had killed time by being driven slowly round and round the
  Outer Circle of Regent's Park.</p>

  <p>Gurther was doing a great deal of thinking in these days, and at the cost
  of much physical discomfort had curtailed his pernicious practices, that his
  head might be clear all the time. For if he were to live, that clear head of
  his was necessary.</p>

  <p>The prisoner in the cellar occupied his thoughts. She had an importance
  for two reasons: she was a friend of the men whom he hated with a cold and
  deadly malignity beyond description; she represented wealth untold, and the
  Herr Doktor had even gone to the length of planning a marriage with her. She
  was not to be killed, not to be hurt; she was so important that the old man
  would take the risks attendant upon a marriage. There must be an excellent
  reason for that, because Dr. Oberzohn had not a very delicate mind.</p>

  <p>He seemed to remember that, by the English law, a wife could not give
  evidence against her husband. He was not sure, but he had a dim notion that
  Pfeiffer had told him this: Pfeiffer was an educated man and had taken high
  honours at the gymnasium.</p>

  <p>Gurther was not well read. His education had been of a scrappy character,
  and once upon a time he had been refused a leading part because of his
  provincial accent. That fault he had corrected in prison, under the tuition
  of a professor who was serving a life sentence for killing two women; but by
  the time Gurther had been released, he was a marked man, and the stage was a
  career lost to him for ever.</p>

  <p>Oberzohn possessed advantages which were not his. He was the master;
  Gurther was the servant. Oberzohn could determine events by reason of his
  vast authority, and the strings which he pulled in every part of the world.
  Even Gurther had accepted this position of blind, obedient servant, but now
  his angle had shifted, even as Oberzohn's had moved in relation to Montague
  Newton. Perhaps because of this. The doctor, in curtailing one confidence,
  was enlarging another, and in the enlargement his prestige suffered.</p>

  <p>Gurther was now the confidant, therefore the equal, and logically, the
  equal can always become the superior. He had dreamed dreams of a life of
  ease, a gratification of his sense of luxury without the sobering thought
  that somewhere round the corner was waiting a man ready to tap him on the
  shoulder... a white palace in a flowery land, with blue swimming pools, and
  supple girls who called him Master. Gurther began to see the light.</p>

  <p>Until he had taken his seat in the theatre, he had not so much as glimpsed
  the man and the woman in the end box.</p>

  <p>Joan was happy&mdash;happier than she remembered having been. Perhaps it
  was the reaction from her voluntary imprisonment. Certainly it was Monty's
  reluctant agreement to a change of plans which so exalted her. Monty had
  dropped the thin pretence of an accommodation marriage; and once he was
  persuaded to this, the last hindrance to enjoyment was dissipated. Let
  Oberzohn take the girl if he wanted her; take, too, such heavy responsibility
  as followed. Monty Newton would get all that he wanted without the risk.
  Having arrived at this decision, he had ordered another bottle of champagne
  to seal the bargain, and they left Mero's club a much happier couple than
  they had been when they entered.</p>

  <p>"As soon as we've carved up this money, we'll get away out of England," he
  told her as they were driving to the theatre. "What about Buenos Ayres for
  the winter, old girl?"</p>

  <p>She did not know where Buenos Ayres was, but she gurgled her delight at
  the suggestion, and Monty expatiated upon the joys of the South American
  summer, the beauties of B.A., its gaieties and amusements.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose there'll be any kick coming," he said, "but it wouldn't
  be a bad scheme if we took a trip round the world, and came back in about
  eighteen months' time to settle down in London. My hectic past would have
  been forgotten by then&mdash;why, I might even get into Parliament."</p>

  <p>"How wonderful!" she breathed, and then: "What is this play about,
  Monty?"</p>

  <p>"It's a bit of a thrill, the very play for you&mdash;a detective story
  that will make your hair stand on end."</p>

  <p>She had all the gamin's morbid interest in murder and crime, and she
  settled down in the box with a pleasant feeling of anticipation, and watched
  the development of the first act.</p>

  <p>The scene was laid in a club, a low-down resort where the least desirable
  members of society met, and she drank in every word, because she knew the
  life, had seen that type of expensively dressed woman who swaggered on to the
  stage and was addressed familiarly by the club proprietor. She knew that
  steady-eyed detective when he made his embarrassing appearance. The woman was
  herself. She even knew the cadaverous wanderer who approached stealthily at
  the door: a human wolf that fled at the sight of the police officer.</p>

  <p>The three who sat in the front row of the stalls&mdash;how Leon Gonsalez
  secured these tickets was one of the minor mysteries of the day&mdash;saw
  her, and one at least felt his heart ache.</p>

  <p>Monty beamed his geniality. He had taken sufficient wine to give him a
  rosy view of the world, and he was even mildly interested in the play, though
  his chief pleasure was in the girl's enchantment. He ordered ices for her
  after the first interval.</p>

  <p>"You're getting quite a theatre fan, kiddie," he said. "I must take you to
  some other shows. I had no idea you liked this sort of thing."</p>

  <p>She drew a long breath and smiled at him.</p>

  <p>"I like anything when I'm with you," she said, and they held hands
  foolishly, till the house lights dimmed and the curtain rose upon a lawyer's
  office.</p>

  <p>The lawyer was of the underworld: a man everlastingly on the verge of
  being struck off the rolls. He had betrayed a client with whom he had had
  dealings, and the man had gone to prison for a long term, but had escaped.
  Now the news had come that he had left Australia and was in London, waiting
  his opportunity to destroy the man whose treachery was responsible for his
  capture.</p>

  <p>Here was a note to which the heart of the girl responded. Even Monty found
  himself leaning forward, as the old familiar cant terms of his trade came
  across the footlights.</p>

  <p>"It is quite all right," he said, at the second interval, "only"&mdash;he
  hesitated&mdash;"isn't it a bit too near the real thing? After all, one
  doesn't come to the theatre to see... "</p>

  <p>He stopped, realizing that conditions and situations familiar to him were
  novel enough to a fashionable audience which was learning for the first time
  that a "busy" was a detective, and that a police informer went by the title
  of "nose."</p>

  <p>The lights up, he glanced round the house, and suddenly he started and
  caught her arm.</p>

  <p>"Don't look for a moment," he said, averting his eyes, "then take a glance
  at the front row. Do you see anybody you know?"</p>

  <p>Presently she looked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is the fellow you hate so much, isn't it&mdash;Gonsalez?"</p>

  <p>"They're all there&mdash;the three of them," said Monty. "I
  wonder"&mdash;he was troubled at the thought&mdash;"I wonder if they're
  looking for you?"</p>

  <p>"For me? They've nothing on me, Monty."</p>

  <p>He was silent.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you're not going back to that place to-night. They'll trail you
  sure&mdash;sure!"</p>

  <p>He thought later that it was probably a coincidence that they were there
  at all. They seemed to show no interest in the box, but were chattering and
  talking and laughing to one another. Not once did their eyes come up to his
  level, and after a while he gained in confidence, though he was glad enough
  when the play was resumed.</p>

  <p>There were two scenes in the act: the first was a police station, the
  second the lawyer's room. The man was drunk, and the detective had come to
  warn him that The Ringer was after him. And then suddenly the lights on the
  stage were extinguished and the whole house was in the dark. It was part of
  the plot. In this darkness, and in the very presence of the police, the
  threatened man was to be murdered. They listened in tense silence, the girl
  craning her head forward, trying to pierce the dark, listening to the lines
  of intense dialogue that were coming from the blackness of the stage.
  Somebody was in the room&mdash;a woman, and they had found her. She slipped
  from the stage detective's grasp and vanished, and when the lights went up
  she was gone.</p>

  <p>"What has happened, Monty?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Do you think&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>She looked round at him. His head was resting on the plush-covered ledge
  of the box. His face, turned towards her, was grey; the eyes were closed, and
  his teeth showed in a hideous grin.</p>

  <p>She screamed.</p>

  <p>"Monty! Monty!"</p>

  <p>She shook him. Again her scream rang through the house. At first the
  audience thought that it was a woman driven hysterical by the tenseness of
  the stage situation, and then one or two people rose from their stalls and
  looked up.</p>

  <p>"Monty! Speak to me! He's dead, he's dead!"</p>

  <p>Three seats in the front row had emptied. The screams of the hysterical
  girl made it impossible for the scene to proceed, and the curtain came down
  quickly.</p>

  <p>The house was seething with excitement. Every face was turned towards the
  box where she knelt by the side of the dead man, clasping him in her arms,
  and the shrill agony in her voice was unnerving.</p>

  <p>The door of the box swung open, and Manfred dashed in. One glance he gave
  at Monty Newton, and he needed no other.</p>

  <p>"Get the girl out," he said curtly.</p>

  <p>Leon tried to draw her from the box, but she was a shrieking fury.</p>

  <p>"You did it, you did it!... Let me go to him!"</p>

  <p>Leon lifted her from her feet, and, clawing wildly at his face, she was
  carried from the box.</p>

  <p>The manager was running along the passage, and Leon sent him on with a
  jerk of his head. And then a woman in evening dress came from somewhere.</p>

  <p>"May I take her?" she said, and the exhausted girl collapsed into her
  arms.</p>

  <p>Gonsalez flew back to the box. The man was lying on the floor, and the
  manager, standing at the edge of the box, was addressing the audience.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman has fainted, and I'm afraid his friend has become a little
  hysterical. I must apologize to you, ladies and gentlemen, for this
  interruption. If you will allow us a minute to clear the box, the play will
  be resumed. If there is a doctor in the house, I should be glad if he would
  come."</p>

  <p>There were two doctors within reach, and in the passage, which was now
  guarded by a commissionaire, a hasty examination was made. They examined the
  punctured wound at the back of the neck and then looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"This is The Snake," said one.</p>

  <p>"The house musn't know," said Manfred. "He's dead, of course?"</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded.</p>

  <p>Out in the passage was a big emergency exit door, and this the manager
  pushed open, and, running out into the street, found a cab, into which all
  that was mortal of Monty Newton was lifted.</p>

  <p>Whilst this was being done, Poiccart returned.</p>

  <p>"His car has just driven off," he said. "I saw the number-plate as it
  turned into Lisle Street."</p>

  <p>"How long ago?" asked Gonsalez quickly.</p>

  <p>"At this very moment."</p>

  <p>Leon pinched his lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't he wait, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>He went back through the emergency door, which was being closed, and
  passed up the passage towards the entrance. The box was on the dress-circle
  level, and the end of a short passage brought him into the circle itself.</p>

  <p>And then the thought of the lame man occurred to him, and his eyes sought
  the first seat in the front row, which was also the seat nearest to the
  boxes. The man had gone.</p>

  <p>As he made this discovery, George emerged from the passage.</p>

  <p>"Gurther!" said Leon. "What a fool I am! But how clever!"</p>

  <p>"Gurther?" said Manfred in amazement. "Do you mean the man with the club
  foot?"</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>"He was not alone, of course," said Gonsalez. "There must have been two or
  three of the gang here, men and women&mdash;Oberzohn works these schemes out
  with the care and thoroughness of a general. I wonder where the management
  have taken the girl?"</p>

  <p>He found the manager discussing the tragedy with two other men, one of
  whom was obviously associated with the production, and he signalled him
  aside.</p>

  <p>"The lady? I suppose she's gone home. She's left the theatre."</p>

  <p>"Which way did she go?" asked Gonsalez, in a sudden panic.</p>

  <p>The manager called a linkman, who had seen a middle-aged woman come out of
  the theatre with a weeping girl, and they had gone down the side-street
  towards the little square at the back of the playhouse.</p>

  <p>"She may have taken her home to Chester Square," said Manfred. His voice
  belied the assumption of confidence.</p>

  <p>Leon had not brought his own machine, and they drove to Chester Square in
  a taxi. Fred, the footman, had neither heard nor seen the girl, and nearly
  fainted when he learned of the tragic ending to his master's career.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" he groaned. "And he only left here this afternoon... dead,
  you say?"</p>

  <p>Gonsalez nodded.</p>

  <p>"Not&mdash;not The Snake?" faltered the man.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about the snake?" demanded Manfred sternly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except&mdash;well, the snake made him nervous, I know. He told
  me to-day that he hoped he'd get through the week without a snake-bite."</p>

  <p>He was questioned closely, but although it was clear that he knew
  something of his master's illicit transactions, and that he was connected in
  business with Oberzohn, the footman had no connection with the doctor's gang.
  He drew a large wage and a percentage of profits from the gaming side of the
  business, and confessed that it was part of his duties to prepare stacks of
  cards and pass them to his master under cover of bringing in the drinks. But
  of anything more sinister he knew nothing.</p>

  <p>"The woman, of course, was a confederate, who had been planted to take
  charge of the girl the moment the snake struck. I was in such a state of
  mind," confessed Leon, "that I do not even remember what she looked like. I
  am a fool&mdash;a double-distilled idiot! I think I must be getting old.
  There's only one thing for us to do, and that is to get back to Curzon
  Street&mdash;something may have turned up."</p>

  <p>"Did you leave anybody in the house?"</p>

  <p>Leon nodded. "Yes, I left one of our men, to take any 'phone messages that
  came through."</p>

  <p>They paid off the taxi before the house, and Leon sprinted to the garage
  to get the car. The man who opened the door to them was he who had been tied
  up by the pedlar at Heavy-tree Farm, and his first words came as a shock to
  Manfred: "Digby's here, sir."</p>

  <p>"Digby?" said the other in surprise. "I thought he was on duty?"</p>

  <p>"He's been here since just after you left, sir. If I'd known where you had
  gone, I'd have sent him to you."</p>

  <p>Digby came out of the waiting-room at that moment, ready to apologize.</p>

  <p>"I had to see you, sir, and I'm sorry I'm away from my post."</p>

  <p>"You may not be missing much," said Manfred unsmilingly. "Come upstairs
  and tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>Digby's story was a strange one. He had gone down that afternoon to the
  canal bank to make a reconnaissance of ground which was new to him.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I did too, because the walls have got broken glass on top. I
  went up into the Old Kent Road and bought a garden hoe, and prised the mortar
  loose, so that if I wanted, I could get over. And then I climbed round the
  water-gate and had a look at that barge of his. There was nobody about,
  though I think they spotted me afterwards. It is a fairly big barge, and, of
  course, in a terrible state, but the hold is full of cargo&mdash;you know
  that, sir?"</p>

  <p>"You mean there is something in the barge?"</p>

  <p>Digby nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it has a load of some kind. The after part, where the bargee's
  sleeping quarters are, is full of rats and water, but the fore part of the
  vessel is water-tight, and it holds something heavy too. That is why the
  barge is down by its head in the mud. I was in the Thames police and I know a
  lot about river craft."</p>

  <p>"Is that what you came to tell me?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, it was something queerer than that. After I'd given the barge a
  look over and tried to pull up some of the boards&mdash;which I didn't manage
  to do&mdash;I went along and had a look at the factory. It's not so easy to
  get in, because the entrance faces the house, but to get to it you have to go
  half round the building, and that gives you a certain amount of cover. There
  was nothing I could see in the factory itself. It was in a terrible mess,
  full of old iron and burnt-out boxes. I was coming round the back of the
  building," he went on impressively, "when I smelt a peculiar scent."</p>

  <p>"A perfume?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, it was perfume, but stronger&mdash;more like incense. I thought
  at first it might be an old bale of stuff that had been thrown out, or else I
  was deceiving myself. I began poking about in the rubbish heaps&mdash;but
  they didn't smell of scent! Then I went back into the building again, but
  there was no smell at all. It was very strong when I returned to the back of
  the factory, and then I saw a little waft of smoke come out of a ventilator
  close to the ground. My first idea was that the place was on fire, but when I
  knelt down, it was this scent."</p>

  <p>"Joss-sticks?" said Poiccart quickly.</p>

  <p>"That's what it was!" said the detective. "Like incense, yet not like it.
  I knelt down and listened at the grating, and I'll swear that I heard voices.
  They were very faint."</p>

  <p>"Men's?"</p>

  <p>"No, women's."</p>

  <p>"Could you see anything?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, it was a blind ventilator there was probably a shaft
  there&mdash;in fact, I'm sure there was, because I pushed a stone through one
  of the holes and heard it drop some distance down."</p>

  <p>"There may be an underground room there," said Poiccart, "and somebody's
  burnt joss-sticks to sweeten the atmosphere."</p>

  <p>"Under the factory? It's not in the plans of the building. I've had them
  from the surveyor's office and examined them," said George, "although
  surveyors' plans aren't infallible. A man like Oberzohn would not hesitate to
  break so unimportant a thing as a building law!"</p>

  <p>Leon came in at that moment, heard the story and was in complete agreement
  with Poiccart's theory.</p>

  <p>"I wondered at the time we saw the plans whether we ought to accept that
  as conclusive," he said. "The store was built at the end of 1914, when
  architects and builders took great liberties and pleaded the exigencies of
  the war."</p>

  <p>Digby went on with his story.</p>

  <p>"I was going back to the barge to get past the water-gate, but I saw the
  old man coming down the steps of the house, so I climbed the wall, and very
  glad I was that I'd shifted that broken glass, or I should never have got
  over."</p>

  <p>Manfred pulled his watch from his pocket with a frown. They had lost
  nearly an hour of precious time with their inquiries in Chester Square.</p>

  <p>"I hope we're not too late," he said ominously. "Now Leon... "</p>

  <p>But Leon had gone down the stairs in three strides.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap30"
     id="chap30">XXX.&mdash;JOAN A PRISONER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DAZED with grief, not knowing, not seeing, not caring, not
  daring to think, Joan suffered herself to be led quickly into the obscurity
  of the side-street, and did not even realize that Oberzohn's big limousine
  had drawn up by the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"Get in," said the woman harshly.</p>

  <p>Joan was pushed through the door and guided to a seat by somebody who was
  already in the machine.</p>

  <p>She collapsed in a corner moaning as the door slammed and the car began to
  move.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going? Let me get back to him!"</p>

  <p>"The gracious lady will please restrain her grief," said a hateful voice,
  and she swung round and stared unseeingly to the place whence the voice had
  come.</p>

  <p>The curtains of the car had been drawn; the interior was as black as
  pitch.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you beast!" she gasped. "It's you, is it?... Gurther! You
  murdering beast!"</p>

  <p>She struck at him feebly, but he caught her wrist.</p>

  <p>"The gracious lady will most kindly restrain her grief," he said suavely.
  "The Herr Newton is not dead. It was a little trick in order to baffle
  certain interferers."</p>

  <p>"You're lying, you're lying!" she screamed, struggling to escape from
  those hands of steel. "He's dead! You know he's dead, and you killed him! You
  snake-man!"</p>

  <p>"The gracious lady must believe me," said Gurther earnestly. They were
  passing through a public part of the town and at any moment a policeman might
  hear her shrieks. "If Herr Newton had not pretended to be hurt, he would have
  been arrested... he follows in the next car."</p>

  <p>"You're trying to quieten me," she said, "but I won't be quiet."</p>

  <p>And then a hand came over her mouth and pressed her head back against the
  cushions. She struggled desperately, but two fingers slid up her face and
  compressed her nostrils. She was being suffocated. She struggled to free
  herself from the tentacle hold of him, and then slipped into
  unconsciousness.</p>

  <p>Gurther felt the straining figure go limp and removed his hands. She did
  not feel the prick of the needle on her wrist, though the drugging was
  clumsily performed in the darkness and in a car that was swaying from side to
  side. He felt her pulse, his long fingers pressed her throat and felt the
  throb of the carotid artery; propping her so that she could not fall, Herr
  Gurther sank back luxuriously into a corner of the limousine and lit a
  cigar.</p>

  <p>The journey was soon over. In a very short time they were bumping down
  Hangman's Lane and turned so abruptly into the factory grounds that one of
  the mudguards buckled to the impact of the gate-post.</p>

  <p>It must have been two hours after the departure of her companion, when
  Mirabelle, lying on her bed, half dozing, was wakened by her book slipping to
  the floor, and sat up quickly to meet the apprising stare of the man whom, of
  all men in the world, she disliked most cordially. Dr. Oberzohn had come
  noiselessly into the room and under his arm was a pile of books.</p>

  <p>"I have brought these for you," he said, in his booming voice, and stacked
  them neatly on the table.</p>

  <p>She did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Novels of a frivolous kind, such as you will enjoy," he said, unconscious
  of offence. "I desired the seller of the books to pick them for me. Fiction
  stories of adventure and of amorous exchanges. These will occupy your mind,
  though to me they would be the merest rubbish and nonsense."</p>

  <p>She stood silently, her hands clasped behind her, watching him. He was
  neater than usual, had resumed the frock-coat he wore the day she had first
  met him&mdash;how long ago that seemed!&mdash;his collar was stiffly white,
  and if his cravat was more gorgeous than is usually seen in a man correctly
  arrayed, it had the complementary value of being new.</p>

  <p>He held in his hands a small bouquet of flowers tightly packed, their
  stems enclosed in silver foil, a white paper frill supplying an additional
  expression of gentility.</p>

  <p>"These are for you." He jerked out his hand towards her.</p>

  <p>Mirabelle looked at the flowers, but did not take them. He seemed in no
  way disconcerted, either by her silence, or by the antagonism which her
  attitude implied, but, laying the flowers on top of the books, he clasped his
  hands before him and addressed her. He was nervous, for some reason; the skin
  of his forehead was furrowing and smoothing with grotesque rapidity. She
  watched the contortions, fascinated.</p>

  <p>"To every man," he began, "there comes a moment of domestic allurement.
  Even to the scientific mind, absorbed in its colossal problems, there is this
  desire for family life and for the haven of rest which is called
  marriage."</p>

  <p>He paused, as though he expected her to offer some comment upon his
  platitude.</p>

  <p>"Man alone," he went on, when she did not speak, "has established an
  artificial and unnatural convention that, at a certain age, a man should
  marry a woman of that same age. Yet it has been proved by history that happy
  marriages are often between a man who is in the eyes of the world old, and a
  lady who is youthful."</p>

  <p>She was gazing at him in dismay. Was he proposing to her? The idea was
  incredible, almost revolting. He must have read in her face the thoughts that
  were uppermost in her mind, the loathing, the sense of repulsion which filled
  her, yet he went on, unabashed: "I am a man of great riches. You are a girl
  of considerable poverty. But because I saw you one day in your poor house,
  looking, gracious lady, like a lily growing amidst foul weeds, my heart went
  out to you, and for this reason I brought you to London, spending many
  thousands of pounds in order to give myself the pleasure of your
  company."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you need go any farther, Dr. Oberzohn," she said quietly,
  "if you're proposing marriage, as I think you are."</p>

  <p>He nodded emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Such is my honourable intention," he said.</p>

  <p>"I would never marry you in any circumstances," she said. "Not even if I
  had met you under the happiest conditions. The question of your
  age"&mdash;she nearly added "and of your appearance," but her natural
  kindness prevented that cruel thrust, though it would not have hurt him in
  the slightest degree&mdash;"has nothing whatever to do with my decision. I do
  not even like you, and have never liked you, Mr. Oberzohn."</p>

  <p>"Doctor," he corrected, and in spite of her woeful plight she could have
  laughed at this insistence upon the ceremonial title.</p>

  <p>"Young miss, I cannot woo you in the way of my dear and sainted brother,
  who was all for ladies and had a beautiful manner."</p>

  <p>She was amazed to hear that he had a brother at all&mdash;and it was
  almost a relief to know that he was dead.</p>

  <p>"Martyred, at the hands of wicked and cunning murderers, slain in his
  prime by the assassin's pistol... " His voice trembled and broke. "For that
  sainted life I will some day take vengeance."</p>

  <p>It was not wholly curiosity that impelled her to ask who killed him.</p>

  <p>"Leon Gonsalez." The words in his lips became the grating of a file.
  "Killed... murdered! And even his beautiful picture destroyed in that
  terrible fire. Had he saved that, my heart would have been soft towards him."
  He checked himself, evidently realizing that he was getting away from the
  object of his call. "Think over this matter, young lady. Read the romantic
  books and the amorous books, and then perhaps you will not think it so
  terrible a fate to drift at moonlight through the canals of Venice, with the
  moon above and the gondoliers."</p>

  <p>He wagged his head sentimentally.</p>

  <p>"There is no book which will change my view, doctor," she said. "I cannot
  understand why you propose such an extraordinary course, but I would rather
  die than marry you."</p>

  <p>His cold eyes filled her with a quick terror.</p>

  <p>"There are worse things than death, which is but sleep&mdash;many worse
  things, young miss. To-morrow I shall come for you, and we will go into the
  country, where you will say 'yes' and 'no' according to my desire. I have
  many&mdash;what is the word?&mdash;certificates for marriage, for I am too
  clever a man to leave myself without alternatives."</p>

  <p>(This was true; he had residential qualifications in at least four
  counties, and at each he had given legal notice of his intended
  marriage.)</p>

  <p>"Not to-morrow or any other day. Nothing would induce me."</p>

  <p>His eyebrows went almost to the top of his head.</p>

  <p>"So!" he said, with such significance that her blood ran cold. "There are
  worse men than the Herr Doktor"&mdash;he raised a long finger
  warningly&mdash;"terrible, men with terrible minds. You have met
  Gurther?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer this.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, you danced with him. A nice man, is he not, to ladies? Yet this
  same Gurther... I will tell you something."</p>

  <p>He seated himself on a corner of the table and began talking, until she
  covered her ears with her hands and hid her white face from him.</p>

  <p>"They would have killed him for that," he said, when her hands came down,
  "but Gurther was too clever, and the poor German peasants too stupid. You
  shall remember that, shall you not?"</p>

  <p>He did not wait for her answer. With a stiff bow he strutted out of the
  room and up the stairs. There came the thud of the trap falling and the
  inevitable rumble of the concrete barrel.</p>

  <p>He had some work to do, heavy work for a man who found himself panting
  when he climbed stairs. And though four of his best and most desperate men
  were waiting in his parlour drinking his whisky and filling the little room
  with their rank cigar smoke, he preferred to tackle this task which he had
  already begun as soon as night fell, without their assistance or
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>On the edge of the deep hole in his grounds, where the wild convolvulus
  grew amidst the rusty corners of discarded tins and oil barrels, was a patch
  of earth that yielded easily to the spade. When the factory had been built,
  the depression had been bigger, but the builders had filled in half the hole
  with the light soil that they had dug out of the factory's foundations.</p>

  <p>He took his spade, which he had left in the factory, and, skirting the
  saucer-shaped depression, he reached a spot where a long trench had already
  been dug. Taking off his fine coat and waistcoat, unfastening cravat and
  collar and carefully depositing them upon the folded coat, he continued his
  work, stopping now and again to wipe his streaming brow.</p>

  <p>He had to labour in the dark, but this was no disadvantage; he could feel
  the edges of the pit. In an hour the top of the trench was level with his
  chin, and, stooping to clear the bottom of loose soil, he climbed up with
  greater difficulty than he had anticipated, and it was only after the third
  attempt that he managed to reach the top, out of breath and short of
  temper.</p>

  <p>He dressed again, and with his electric torch surveyed the pit he had made
  and grunted his satisfaction.</p>

  <p>He was keenly sensitive to certain atmospheres, and needed no information
  about the change which had come over his subordinates. In their last
  consultation Gurther had been less obsequious, had even smoked in his
  presence without permission&mdash;absent-mindedly, perhaps, but the offence
  was there. And Dr. Oberzohn, on the point of smacking his face for his
  insolence, heard a warning voice within himself which had made his hand drop
  back at his side. Or was it the look he saw on Gurther's face? The man was
  beyond the point where he could discipline him in the old Junker way. For
  although Dr. Oberzohn condemned all things Teutonic, he had a sneaking
  reverence for the military caste of that nation.</p>

  <p>He left the spade sticking in a heap of turned earth. He would need that
  again, and shortly. Unless Gurther failed. Somehow he did not anticipate a
  failure in this instance. Mr. Monty Newton had not yet grown suspicious,
  would not be on his guard. His easy acceptance of the theatre tickets showed
  his mind in this respect.</p>

  <p>The four men in his room rose respectfully as he came in. The air was blue
  with smoke, and Lew Cuccini offered a rough apology. He had been released
  that morning from detention, for Meadows had found it difficult to frame a
  charge which did not expose the full activities of the police, and the part
  they were playing in relation to Mirabelle Leicester. Evidently Cuccini had
  been reproaching, in his own peculiar way and in his own unprincipled
  language, the cowardice of his three companions, for the atmosphere seemed
  tense when the doctor returned. Yet, as was subsequently proved, the
  appearance of discord was deceptive; might indeed have been staged for their
  host's benefit.</p>

  <p>"I've just been telling these birds&mdash;" began Cuccini.</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up, Lew!" growled one of his friends. "If that crazy man hadn't
  been shouting your name, we should not have gone back! He'd have wakened the
  dead. And our orders were to retire at the first serious sign of an alarm.
  That's right, doctor, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Sure it's right," said the doctor blandly. "Never be caught&mdash;that is
  a good motto. Cuccini was caught."</p>

  <p>"And I'd give a year of my life to meet that Dago again," said Cuccini,
  between his teeth.</p>

  <p>He was delightfully inconsistent, for he came into the category, having
  been born in Milan, and had had his early education in the Italian quarter of
  Hartford, Connecticut.</p>

  <p>"He'd have tortured me too... he was going to put lighted wax matches
  between my fingers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And then you spilled it!" accused one of the three hotly. "You talk about
  us bolting!"</p>

  <p>"Silence!" roared the doctor. "This is unseemly! I have forgiven
  everything. That shall be enough for you all. I will hear no other word."</p>

  <p>"Where is Gurther?" Cuccini asked the question.</p>

  <p>"He has gone away. To-night he leaves for America. He may return&mdash;who
  knows? But that is the intention."</p>

  <p>"Snaking?" asked somebody, and there was a little titter of laughter.</p>

  <p>"Say, doctor, how do you work that stunt?" Cuccini leaned forward, his
  cigar between his fingers, greatly intrigued. "I saw no snakes down at Rath
  Hall, and yet he was bitten, just as that Yankee was
  bitten&mdash;Washington."</p>

  <p>"He will die," said the doctor complacently. He was absurdly jealous for
  the efficacy of his method.</p>

  <p>"He was alive yesterday, anyway. We shadowed him to the station."</p>

  <p>"Then he was not bitten&mdash;no, that is impossible. When the snake
  bites"&mdash;Oberzohn raised his palms and gazed piously at the
  ceiling&mdash;"after that there is nothing. No, no, my friend, you are
  mistaken."</p>

  <p>"I tell you I'm not making any mistake," said the other doggedly. "I was
  in the room, I tell you, soon after they brought him in, and I heard one of
  the busies say that his face was all wet."</p>

  <p>"So!" said Oberzohn dully. "That is very bad."</p>

  <p>"But how do you do it, doctor? Do you shoot or sump'n?"</p>

  <p>"Let us talk about eventual wealth and happiness," said the doctor.
  "To-night is a night of great joy for me. I will sing you a song."</p>

  <p>Then, to the amazement of the men and to their great unhappiness, he sang,
  in a thin reedy old voice, the story of a young peasant who had been thwarted
  in love and had thrown himself from a cliff into a seething waterfall. It was
  a lengthy song, intensely sentimental, and his voice held few of the
  qualities of music. The gang had never been set a more difficult job than to
  keep straight faces until he had finished.</p>

  <p>"Gee! You're some artist, doctor!" said the sycophantic Cuccini, and
  managed to get a simulation of envy into his voice.</p>

  <p>"In my student days I was a great singer," said the doctor modestly.</p>

  <p>Over the mantelpiece was a big, old clock, with a face so faded that only
  a portion of the letters remained. Its noisy ticking had usually a sedative
  effect on the doctor. But its main purpose and value was its accuracy. Every
  day it was corrected by a message from Greenwich, and as Oberzohn's success
  as an organizer depended upon exact timing, it was one of his most valuable
  assets.</p>

  <p>He glanced up at the clock now, and that gave Cuccini his excuse.</p>

  <p>"We'll be getting along, doctor," he said. "You don't want anything
  to-night? I'd like to get a cut at that Gonsalez man. You won't leave me out
  if there's anything doing?"</p>

  <p>Oberzohn rose and went out of the room without another word, for he knew
  that the rising of Cuccini was a signal that not only was the business of the
  day finished, but also that the gang needed its pay.</p>

  <p>Every gang-leader attended upon Mr. Oberzohn once a week with his
  pay-roll, and it was usually the custom for the Herr Doktor to bring his
  cash-box into the room and extract sufficient to liquidate his indebtedness
  to the leader. It was a big box, and on pay-day, as this was, filled to the
  top with bank-notes and Treasury bills. He brought it back now, put it on the
  table, consulted the little slip that Cuccini offered to him, and, taking out
  a pad of notes, fastened about by a rubber band, he wetted his finger and
  thumb.</p>

  <p>"You needn't count them," said Cuccini. "We'll take the lot."</p>

  <p>The doctor turned to see that Cuccini was carelessly holding a gun in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, doctor," said Cuccini coolly, "we've seen the red light, and
  if we don't skip now, while the skipping's good, there's going to be no place
  we can stay comfortable in this little island, and I guess we'll follow
  Gurther."</p>

  <p>One glance the doctor gave at the pistol and then he resumed his counting,
  as though nothing had happened.</p>

  <p>"Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty... "</p>

  <p>"Now quit that," said Cuccini roughly. "I tell you, you needn't
  count."</p>

  <p>"My friend, I prefer to know what I am going to lose. It is a pardonable
  piece of curiosity."</p>

  <p>He raised his hand to the wall, where a length of cord hung, and pulled it
  gently, without taking his eyes from the bank-notes.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing? Put up your hands!" hissed Cuccini.</p>

  <p>"Shoot, I beg." Oberzohn threw a pad of notes on the table. "There is your
  pay." He slammed down the lid of the box. "Now you shall go, if you can go!
  Do you hear them?" He raised his hand, and to the strained ears of the men
  came a gentle rustling sound from the passage outside as though somebody were
  dragging a piece of parchment along the floor. "Do you hear? You shall go if
  you can," said the doctor again, with amazing calmness.</p>

  <p>"The snakes!" breathed Cuccini, going white, and the hand that held the
  pistol shook.</p>

  <p>"Shoot them, my friend," sneered Oberzohn. "If you see them, shoot them.
  But you will not see them, my brave man. They will be&mdash;where? No eyes
  shall see them come or go. They may lie behind a picture, they may wait until
  the door is opened, and then... !"</p>

  <p>Cuccini's mouth was dry.</p>

  <p>"Call 'em off, doctor," he said tremulously.</p>

  <p>"Your gun&mdash;on the table."</p>

  <p>Still the rustling was audible. Cuccini hesitated for a second, then
  obeyed, and took up the notes.</p>

  <p>The other three men were huddled together by the fireplace, the picture of
  fear.</p>

  <p>"Don't open the door, doc," said Cuccini, but Oberzohn had already gripped
  the handle and turned it.</p>

  <p>They heard another door open and the click of the passage light as it had
  come on. Then he returned.</p>

  <p>"If you go now, I shall not wish to see you again. Am I not a man to whom
  all secrets are known? You are well aware!"</p>

  <p>Cuccini looked from the doctor to the door.</p>

  <p>"Want us to go?" he asked, troubled.</p>

  <p>Oberzohn shrugged.</p>

  <p>"As you wish! It was my desire that you should stay with me
  to-night&mdash;there is big work and big money for all of you."</p>

  <p>The men were looking at one another uneasily.</p>

  <p>"How long do you want us to stay?" asked Cuccini.</p>

  <p>"To-night only; if you would not prefer... "</p>

  <p>To-night would come the crisis. Oberzohn had realized this since the day
  dawned for him.</p>

  <p>"We'll stay&mdash;where do we sleep?"</p>

  <p>For answer Oberzohn beckoned them from the room and they followed him into
  the laboratory. In the wall that faced them was a heavy iron door that opened
  into a concrete storehouse, where he kept various odds and ends of equipment,
  oil and spirit for his cars, and the little gas engine that worked a small
  dynamo in the laboratory and gave him, if necessary a lighting plant
  independent of outside current.</p>

  <p>There were three long windows heavily barred and placed just under the
  ceiling.</p>

  <p>"Looks like the condemned cell to me," grumbled Cuccini suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Are the bolts on the inside of a condemned cell?" asked Oberzohn. "Does
  the good warden give you the key as I give you?"&mdash;</p>

  <p>Cuccini took the key.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said ungraciously, "there are plenty of blankets here,
  boys&mdash;I guess you want us where the police won't look, eh?"</p>

  <p>"That is my intention," replied the doctor.</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn closed the door on them and re-entered his study, his big
  mouth twitching with amusement. He pulled the cord again and closed the
  ventilator he had opened. It was only a few days before that he had
  discovered that there were dried leaves in the ventilator shaft, and that the
  opening of the inlet made them rustle, disturbingly for a man who was engaged
  in a profound study of the lesser known, and therefore the more highly
  cultured, philosophers.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap31"
     id="chap31">XXXI.&mdash;THE THINGS IN THE BOX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HE heard the soft purr of engines, and, looking through the
  hall window, saw the dim lights of the car approaching the house, and turned
  out the hall lamp. There he waited in the darkness, till the door of the
  limousine opened and Gurther jumped out. "I respectfully report that it is
  done, Herr Doktor," he said.</p>

  <p>Oberzohn nodded.</p>

  <p>"The woman of Newton&mdash;where is she?"</p>

  <p>"She is inside. Is it your wish that I should bring her? She was very
  troublesome, Herr Doktor, and I had to use the needle."</p>

  <p>"Bring her in&mdash;you!" He barked to the chauffeur. "Help our
  friend."</p>

  <p>Together they lifted the unconscious girl, but carried her no farther than
  the steps. At this point Oberzohn decided that she must return to the prison.
  First they sent the chauffeur away; the car was garaged at New Cross (it was
  one of Oberzohn's three London depots), where the man also lived. After he
  had gone, they carried Joan between them to the factory, taking what, to
  Gurther, seemed an unnecessarily circuitous route. If it was necessary, it
  was at least expedient, for the nearest way to the factory led past the
  yawning hole that the doctor had dug with such labour.</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking Oberzohn's arrival this time. The trap went up with
  a thud, and Mirabelle listened, with a quickly beating heart, to the sound of
  feet coming down the stone stairs. There were two people, and they were
  walking heavily. Somehow she knew before she saw their burden that it was
  Joan. She was in evening dress, her face as white as chalk and her eyes
  closed; the girl thought she was dead when she saw them lay her on the
  bed.</p>

  <p>"You have given her too much, Gurther," said Oberzohn.</p>

  <p>Gurther? She had not recognized him. It was almost impossible to believe
  that this was the dapper young man who had danced with her at the Arts
  Ball.</p>

  <p>"I had to guess in the dark, Herr Doktor," said Gurther.</p>

  <p>They were talking in German, and Mirabelle's acquaintance with that
  language was very slight. She saw Gurther produce a small flat case from his
  pocket, take out a little phial, and shake into the palm of his hand a small
  brown capsule. This he dissolved in a tiny tube which, with the water he
  used, was also extracted from the case. Half filling a minute syringe, he
  sent the needle into Joan's arm. A pause, and then: "Soon she will wake, with
  your kind permission, Herr Doktor," said Gurther.</p>

  <p>Mirabelle was not looking at him, but she knew that his hot eyes were
  fixed on her, that all the time except the second he was operating, he was
  looking at her; and now she knew that this was the man to be feared. A cold
  hand seemed to grip at her heart.</p>

  <p>"That will do, Gurther." Oberzohn's voice was sharp. He, too, had
  interpreted the stare. "You need not wait."</p>

  <p>Gurther obediently stalked from the room, and the doctor followed. Almost
  before the trap had fastened down she was by the girl's side, with a basin of
  water and a wet towel. The second the water touched her face, Joan opened her
  eyes and gazed wildly up at the vaulted ceiling, then rolling over from the
  bed to her knees, she struggled to her feet, swayed and would have fallen,
  had not Mirabelle steadied her.</p>

  <p>"They've got him! They've got my boy... killed him like a dog!"</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Mr. Newton?" gasped Mirabelle, horrified.</p>

  <p>"Killed him&mdash;Monty&mdash;Monty!"</p>

  <p>And then she began to scream and run up and down the room like a thing
  demented. Mirabelle, sick at heart, almost physically sick at the sight,
  caught her and tried to calm her, but she was distracted, half mad. The drug
  and its antidote seemed to have combined to take away the last vestige of
  restraint. It was not until she fell, exhausted, that Mirabelle was able to
  drag her again to the bed and lay her upon it.</p>

  <p>Montague Newton was dead! Who had killed him? Who were the "they"? Then
  she thought of Gurther in his strange attire; white dress-front crumpled,
  even his beard disarranged in the struggle he had had with the overwrought
  woman.</p>

  <p>In sheer desperation she ran up the steps and tried the trap, but it was
  fast. She must get away from here&mdash;must get away at once. Joan was
  moaning pitiably, and the girl sat by her side, striving to calm her. She
  seemed to have passed into a state of semi-consciousness; except for her
  sobs, she made no sound and uttered no intelligible word. Half an hour
  passed&mdash;the longest and most dreadful half-hour in Mirabelle Leicester's
  life. And then she heard a sound. It had penetrated even to the brain of this
  half-mad girl, for she opened her eyes wide, and, gripping Mirabelle, drew
  herself up.</p>

  <p>"He's coming," she said, white to the lips, "coming... the Killer is
  coming!"</p>

  <p>"For God's sake don't talk like that!" said Mirabelle, beside herself with
  fear.</p>

  <p>There it was, in the outer room; a stealthy shuffle of feet. She stared at
  the closed door, and the strain of the suspense almost made her faint. And
  then she saw the steel door move slowly, and first a hand came through, the
  edge of a face... Gurther was leering at her. His beard was gone, and his
  wig; he was collarless, and had over his white shirt the stained jacket that
  was his everyday wear.</p>

  <p>"I want you." He was talking to Mirabelle. Her tongue clave to the roof of
  her mouth, but she did not speak.</p>

  <p>"My pretty little lady&mdash;" he began, and then, with a shriek, Joan
  leapt at him.</p>

  <p>"Murderer, murderer... ! Beast!" she cried, striking wildly at his face.
  With a curse, he tried to throw her off, but she was clinging to him; a
  bestial lunatic thing, hardly human.</p>

  <p>He flung her aside at last, and then he put up his hand to guard his face
  as she leapt at him again. This time she went under his arm and was through
  the door in a flash. He heard the swift patter of her feet on the stairs, and
  turned in pursuit. The trap was open. He stumbled and tripped in the dark
  across the floor of the gaunt factory. Just as she reached the open, he
  grabbed at her and missed. Like a deer she sped, but he was fleeter-footed
  behind her; and suddenly his hand closed about her throat.</p>

  <p>"You had better go out, my friend," he said, and tightened his grip.</p>

  <p>As she twisted to avoid him, he put out his foot. There was a grating
  snap, something gripped his legs, and the excruciating pain of it was
  agonizing. He loosened his hold of her throat, but held her arm tightly. With
  all his strength he threw her against the wall and she fell in a heap. Then,
  leaning down, he forced apart the cruel jagged teeth of the mantrap on to
  which he had put his foot, and drew his leg clear. He was bleeding; his
  trouser leg was torn to ribbons. He stopped only long enough to drag the girl
  to her feet, and, throwing her across his shoulder as though she were a sack,
  he went back into the factory, down the stairs, and threw her on to the bed
  with such violence that the spring supports broke. It had a strange effect
  upon the dazed woman, but this he did not see, for he had turned to
  Mirabelle.</p>

  <p>"My little lady, I want you!" he breathed.</p>

  <p>Blood was trickling down from his wounded calf, but he did not feel the
  pain any more; felt nothing, save the desire to hurt those who hunted him;
  wanted nothing but the materialization of crude and horrid dreams.</p>

  <p>She stood, frozen, paralysed, incapable of movement. And then his hand
  came under her chin and he lifted her face; and she saw the bright, hungry
  eyes devouring her, saw the thin lips come closer and closer, could not move;
  had lost all sentient impressions, and could only stare into the eyes of this
  man-snake, hypnotized by the horror of the moment.</p>

  <p>And then a raging fury descended upon him. Narrow fingers tore at his
  face, almost blinding him. He turned with a howl of rage, but the white-faced
  Joan had flown to the furnace and taken up a short iron bar that had been
  used to rake the burning coals together. She struck at him and missed. He
  dodged past her and she flung the bar at him, and again missed him. The iron
  struck the green box, behind the furnace, there was a sound of smashing
  glass. He did not notice this, intent only upon the girl, and Mirabelle
  closed her eyes and heard only the blow as he struck her.</p>

  <p>When she looked again, Joan was lying on the bed and he was tying one of
  her hands to the bed-rail with a strap which he had taken from his waist.
  Then Mirabelle saw a sight that released her pent speech. He heard her scream
  and grinned round at her... saw where she was looking and looked too.</p>

  <p>Something was coming from the broken green box! A black, spade-shaped
  head, with bright, hard eyes that seemed to survey the scene in a malignant
  stare. And then, inch by inch, a thick shining thing, like a rubber rope,
  wriggled slowly to the floor, coiled about upon itself, and raised its flat
  head. "Oh, God, look!"</p>

  <p>He turned about at the sight, that immovable grin of his upon his face,
  and said something in a guttural tongue. The snake was motionless, its
  baleful gaze first upon the sinking girl, then upon the man.</p>

  <p>Gurther's surprise was tragic; it was as though he had been confronted
  with some apparition from another world. And then his hand went to his hip
  pocket; there was a flash of light and a deafening explosion that stunned
  her. The pistol dropped from his hand and fell with a clatter to the floor,
  and she saw his arm was stiffly extended, and protruding from the cuff of his
  coat a black tail that wound round and round his wrist. It had struck up his
  sleeve. The cloth about his biceps was bumping up and down erratically.</p>

  <p>He stood straightly erect, grinning, the arm still outflung, his
  astonished eyes upon the coil about his wrist. And then, slowly his other
  hand came round, gripped the tail and pulled it savagely forth. The snake
  turned with an angry hiss and tried to bite back at him; but raising his
  hand, he brought the head crashing down against the furnace. There was a
  convulsive wriggle as the reptile fell among the ashes.</p>

  <p>"Gott in himmel!" whispered Gurther, and his free hand went up to his arm
  and felt gingerly. "He is dead, gracious lady. Perhaps there is another?"</p>

  <p>He went, swaying as he walked, to the green box, and put in his hand
  without hesitation. There was another&mdash;a bigger snake, roused from its
  sleep and angry. He bit twice at the man's wrist, but Gurther laughed, a
  gurgling laugh of pure enjoyment. For already he was a dead man; that he
  knew. And it had come to him, at the moment and second of his dissolution,
  when the dread gates of judgment were already ajar, that he should go to his
  Maker with this clean space in the smudge of his life.</p>

  <p>"Go, little one," he said, grinning into the spade-face. "You have no more
  poison; that is finished!"</p>

  <p>He put the writhing head under his heel, and Mirabelle shut her eyes and
  put her hands to her ears. When she looked again, the man was standing by the
  door, clinging to the post and slipping with every frantic effort to keep
  himself erect. He grinned at her again; this man of murder, who had made his
  last kill.</p>

  <p>"Pardon, gracious lady," he said thickly, and went down on his knees, his
  head against the door, his body swaying slowly from side to side, and finally
  tumbled over.</p>

  <p>She heard Oberzohn's harsh voice from the floor above. He was calling
  Gurther, and presently he appeared in the doorway, and there was a pistol in
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"So!" he said, looking down at the dying man.</p>

  <p>And then he saw the snake, and his face wrinkled. He looked from Mirabelle
  to the girl on the bed, went over and examined her, but did not attempt to
  release the strap. It was Mirabelle who did that; Mirabelle who sponged the
  bruised face and loosened the dress.</p>

  <p>So doing, she felt a hand on her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Oberzohn.</p>

  <p>"I'm staying here with Joan, until&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You come at once, or I will give you to my pretty little friends." He
  pointed to the two snakes on the floor who still moved spasmodically.</p>

  <p>She had to step past Gurther, but that seemed easier than passing those
  wriggling, shining black ropes; and, her hand in his, she stumbled up the
  dark steps and eventually into the clean, sweet air of the night.</p>

  <p>He was dressed for a journey; she had noticed that when he appeared. A
  heavy cloth cap was on his curious-shaped head, and he looked less repulsive
  with so much of his forehead hidden. Though the night was warm, he wore an
  overcoat.</p>

  <p>They were passing between the wall and the factory when he stopped and put
  his hand before her mouth. He had heard voices, low voices on the other side
  of the wall, and presently the scrape of something. Without removing his hand
  from her face, he half dragged, half pushed her until they were clear of the
  factory.</p>

  <p>She thought they were going back to the house, which was in darkness, but
  instead, he led her straight along the wall, and presently she saw the bulk
  of the barge.</p>

  <p>"Stay, and do not speak," he said, and began to turn a rusty wheel. With a
  squeak and a groan the water-gates opened inwards. What did he intend doing?
  There was no sign of a boat, only this old dilapidated barge. She was
  presently to know.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said again. She was on the deck of the barge, moving forward to
  its bow, which pointed towards the open gate and the canal beyond.</p>

  <p>She heard him puff and groan as he strained at a rope he had found, and
  then, looking down, she saw the front of the barge open, like the two
  water-gates of a lock. Displaying remarkable agility, he lowered himself over
  the edge; he seemed to be standing on something solid, for again he ordered
  her to join him.</p>

  <p>"I will not go," she said breathlessly, and turning, would have fled, but
  his hand caught her dress and dragged at her.</p>

  <p>"I will drown you here, woman," he, said, and she knew that the threat
  would have a sequel.</p>

  <p>Tremblingly she lowered herself over the edge until her foot touched
  something hard and yet yielding. He was pushing at the barge with all his
  might, and the platform beneath her grew in space. First the sharp nose and
  then the covered half-deck of the fastest motor-boat that Mr. Oberzohn's
  money could buy, or the ingenuity of builders could devise. The old barge was
  a boat-house, and this means of escape had always been to his hand. It was
  for this reason that he lived in a seemingly inaccessible spot.</p>

  <p>The men who had been on the canal bank were gone. The propellers revolving
  slowly, the boat stole down the dark waters, after a short time slipped under
  a bridge over which street-cars were passing, and headed for Deptford and the
  river.</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn took off his overcoat and laid it tenderly inside the shelter
  of the open cabin, tenderly because every pocket was packed tight with
  money.</p>

  <p>To Mirabelle Leicester, crouching in the darkness of that sheltered space,
  the time that passed had no dimension. Once an authoritative voice hailed
  them from the bank. It was a policeman; she saw him after the boat had
  passed. A gas-lamp showed the glitter of his metal buttons. But soon he was
  far behind.</p>

  <p>Deptford was near when they reached a barrier which neither ingenuity nor
  money could pass; a ragged night-bird peered down curiously at the
  motor-boat. "You can't get through here, guv'nor," he said simply. "The lock
  doesn't open until high tide."</p>

  <p>"When is this high tide?" asked Oberzohn breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Six o'clock to-morrow morning," said the voice.</p>

  <p>For a long time he was stricken to inactivity by the news, and then he
  sent his engines into reverse and began circling round.</p>

  <p>"There is one refuge for us, young miss," he said. "Soon we shall see it.
  Now I will tell you something. I desire so much to live. Do you also?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer.</p>

  <p>"If you cry out, if you will make noises, I will kill you&mdash;that is
  all," he said; and the very simplicity of his words, the lack of all emphasis
  behind the deadly earnestness, told her that he would keep his word.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap32"
     id="chap32">XXXII.&mdash;THE SEARCH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"'WARE man-traps," said Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>The white beam of his lamp had detected the ugly thing. He struck at it
  with his stick, and with a vicious snap it closed.</p>

  <p>"Here's one that's been sprung," he said, and examined the teeth. "And,
  what's more, it has made a catch! There's blood here."</p>

  <p>Manfred and Digby were searching the ground cautiously. Then Manfred heard
  the quick intake of his breath, and he stooped again, picked up a strip of
  braided cloth.</p>

  <p>"A man's," he said, and his relief betrayed his fear. "Somebody in evening
  dress, and quite recent." He looked at his finger. "The blood is still
  wet."</p>

  <p>Digby showed him the ventilator grating through which he had smelt the
  incense, and when Leon stooped, the faint aroma still remained.</p>

  <p>"We will try the factory first. If that draws blank, we'll ask Dr.
  Oberzohn's guidance, and if it is not willingly given I shall persuade him."
  And in the reflected light of the lamp George Manfred saw the hard Leon he
  knew of old. "This time I shall not promise: my threat will be infinitely
  milder than my performance."</p>

  <p>They came to the dark entry of the factory, and Manfred splashed his light
  inside.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to walk warily here," he said,</p>

  <p>Progress was slow, for they did not know that a definite path existed
  between the jagged ends of broken iron and debris. Once or twice Leon stopped
  to stamp on the floor; it gave back a hollow sound.</p>

  <p>The search was long and painfully slow: a quarter of an hour passed before
  Leon's lamp focussed on the upturned flagstone and the yawning entrance of
  the vault. He was the first to descend, and, as he reached the floor, he saw
  silhouetted in the light that flowed from the inner room, a man, as he
  thought, crouching in the doorway, and covered him.</p>

  <p>"Put up your hands!" he said.</p>

  <p>The figure made no response, and Manfred ran to the shape. The face was in
  the shadow, but he brought his own lamp down and recognized the set grin of
  the dead man.</p>

  <p>Gurther!</p>

  <p>So thus he had died, in a last effort to climb out for help.</p>

  <p>"The Snake," said Manfred briefly. "There are no marks on his face, so far
  as I can see."</p>

  <p>"Do you notice his wrist, George?"</p>

  <p>Then, looking past the figure, Gonsalez saw the girl lying on the bed, and
  recognized Joan before he saw her face. Halfway across the room he slipped on
  something. Instinctively he knew it was a snake and leapt around, his pistol
  balanced.</p>

  <p>"Merciful heaven! Look at this!"</p>

  <p>He stared from the one reptile to the other.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" he said. "That explains Gurther."</p>

  <p>Quickly he unstrapped Joan's wrists and lifted up her head, listening, his
  ear pressed to the faintly fluttering heart. The basin and the sponge told
  its own story. Where was Mirabelle?</p>

  <p>There was another room, and a row of big cupboards, but the girl was in no
  place that he searched.</p>

  <p>"She's gone, of course," said Manfred quietly. "Otherwise, the trap would
  not have been open. We'd better get this poor girl out of the way and search
  the grounds. Digby, go to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped.</p>

  <p>If Oberzohn were in the house, they must not take the risk of alarming
  him.</p>

  <p>But the girl's needs were urgent. Manfred picked her up and carried her
  out into the open, and, with Leon guiding them, they came, after a trek which
  almost ended in a broken neck for Leon, to within a few yards of the
  house.</p>

  <p>"I presume," said Gonsalez, "that the hole into which I nearly dived was
  dug for a purpose, and I shouldn't be surprised to learn it was intended that
  the late Mr. Gurther should find a permanent home there. Shall I take
  her?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," said Manfred, "go on into the lane. Poiccart should be there
  with the car by now."</p>

  <p>"Poiccart knows more about growing onions than driving motor-cars." The
  gibe was mechanical; the man's heart and mind were on Mirabelle
  Leicester.</p>

  <p>They had to make a circuit of the stiff copper-wire fence which surrounded
  the house, and eventually reached Hangman's Lane just as the headlamps of the
  Spanz came into view.</p>

  <p>"I will take her to the hospital and get in touch with the police," said
  Manfred. "I suppose there isn't a near-by telephone?"</p>

  <p>"I shall probably telephone from the house," said Leon gravely.</p>

  <p>From where he stood he could not tell whether the door was open or closed.
  There was no transom above the door, so that it was impossible to tell
  whether there were lights in the passage or not. The house was in complete
  darkness.</p>

  <p>He was so depressed that he did not even give instructions to Poiccart,
  who was frankly embarrassed by the duty which had been imposed upon him, and
  gladly surrendered the wheel to George.</p>

  <p>They lifted the girl into the tonneau, and, backing into the gate, went
  cautiously up the lane&mdash;Leon did not wait to see their departure, but
  returned to the front of the house.</p>

  <p>The place was in darkness. He opened the wire gate and went silently up
  the steps. He had not reached the top before he saw that the door was wide
  open. Was it a trap? His lamp showed him the switch: he turned on the light
  and closed the door behind him, and, bending his head, listened.</p>

  <p>The first door on the right was Oberzohn's room. The door was ajar, but
  the lamps were burning inside. He pushed it open with the toe of his boot,
  but the room was empty.</p>

  <p>The next two doors he tried on that floor were locked. He went carefully
  down to the kitchens and searched them both. They were tenantless. He knew
  there was a servant or two on the premises, but one thing he did not know,
  and this he discovered in the course of his tour, was that Oberzohn had no
  bedroom. One of the two rooms above had evidently been occupied by the
  servants. The door was open, the room was empty and in some confusion; a
  coarse night-dress had been hastily discarded and left on the tumbled
  bedclothes. Oberzohn had sent his servants away in a hurry&mdash;why?</p>

  <p>There was a half-smoked cigarette on the edge of a deal wash-stand. The
  ash lay on the floor. In a bureau every drawer was open and empty, except
  one, a half-drawer filled with odd scraps of cloth. Probably the cook or the
  maid smoked. He found a packet of cigarettes under one pillow to confirm this
  view, and guessed they had gone to bed leisurely with no idea that they would
  be turned into the night.</p>

  <p>He learned later that Oberzohn had bundled off his servants at ten
  minutes' notice, paying them six months' salary as some salve for the
  indignity.</p>

  <p>Pfeiffer's room was locked; but now, satisfied that the house was empty,
  he broke the flimsy catch, made a search but found nothing. Gurther's
  apartment was in indescribable disorder. He had evidently changed in a hurry.
  His powder puffs and beards, crepe hair and spirit bottles, littered the
  dressing-table. He remembered, with a pang of contrition, that he had
  promised to telephone the police, but when he tried to get the exchange he
  found the line was dead: a strange circumstance, till he discovered that late
  that evening Meadows had decided to cut the house from all telephonic
  communication, and had given orders accordingly.</p>

  <p>It was a queerly built house: he had never realized its remarkable
  character until he had examined it at these close quarters. The walls were of
  immense thickness: that fact was brought home to him when he had opened the
  window of the maid's room to see if Digby was in sight. The stairs were of
  concrete, the shutters which covered the windows of Oberzohn's study were
  steel-faced. He decided, pending the arrival of the police, to make an
  examination of the two locked rooms. The first of these he had no difficulty
  in opening. It was a large room on the actual ground level, and was reached
  by going down six steps. A rough bench ran round three sides of this bare
  apartment, except where its continuity broke to allow entrance to a further
  room. The door was of steel and was fastened.</p>

  <p>The room was dusty but not untidy. Everything was in order. The various
  apparatus was separated by a clear space. In one corner he saw a gas engine
  and dynamo covered with dust. There was nothing to be gained here. The
  machine which interested him most was one he knew all about, only he had not
  guessed the graphite moulds. The contents of a small blue bottle, tightly
  corked, and seemingly filled with discoloured swabs of cotton-wool, however,
  revived his interest. With a glance round the laboratory, he went out and
  tried the second of the locked doors.</p>

  <p>This room, however, was well protected, both in the matter of stoutness of
  door and complication of locks. Leon tried all his keys, and then used his
  final argument. This he carried in a small leather pouch in his hip pocket;
  three steel pieces that screwed together and ended in a bright claw.
  Hammering the end of the jemmy with his fist, he forced the claw between door
  and lintel, and in less than a minute the lock had broken, and he was in the
  presence of the strangest company that had ever been housed.</p>

  <p>Four electric radiators were burning. The room was hot and heavy, and the
  taint of it caught his throat, as it had caught the throat of the Danish
  servant. He put on all the lights&mdash;and they were many&mdash;and then
  began his tour.</p>

  <p>There were two lines of shelves, wide apart, and each supporting a number
  of boxes, some of which were wrapped in baize, some of which, however, were
  open to view. All had glass fronts, all had steel tops with tiny air-holes,
  and in each there coiled, in its bed of wool or straw, according to its
  requirements, one or two snakes. There were cobras, puff-adders, two
  rattlesnakes, seemingly dead, but, as he guessed, asleep; there was a South
  American fer-de-lance, that most unpleasant representative of his species;
  there were little coral snakes, and, in one long box, a whole nest of queer
  little things that looked like tiny yellow lobsters, but which he knew as
  scorpions.</p>

  <p>He was lifting a baize cover when:</p>

  <p>"Don't move, my friend! I think I can promise you more intimate knowledge
  of our little family."</p>

  <p>Leon turned slowly, his hands extended. Death was behind him, remorseless,
  unhesitating. To drop his hand to his pocket would have been the end for
  him&mdash;he had that peculiar instinct which senses sincerity, and when Dr.
  Oberzohn gave him his instructions he had no doubt whatever that his threat
  was backed by the will to execute.</p>

  <p>Oberzohn stood there, and a little behind him, white-faced, open-eyed with
  fear, Mirabelle Leicester.</p>

  <p>Digby&mdash;where was he? He had left him in the grounds.</p>

  <p>The doctor was examining the broken door and grunted his annoyance.</p>

  <p>"I fear my plan will not be good," he said, "which was to lock you in this
  room and break all those glasses, so that you might become better acquainted
  with the Quiet People. That is not to be. Instead, march!"</p>

  <p>What did he intend? Leon strolled out nonchalantly, but Oberzohn kept his
  distance, his eyes glued upon those sensitive hands that could move so
  quickly and jerk and fire a gun in one motion.</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Leon halted, facing the open front door and the steps.</p>

  <p>"You will remember my sainted brother, Señor Gonsalez, and of the great
  loss which the world suffered when he was so vilely murdered?"</p>

  <p>Leon stood without a quiver. Presently the man would shoot. At any second
  a bullet might come crashing on its fatal errand. This was a queer way to
  finish so full a life. He knew it was coming, had only one regret; that this
  shaken girl should be called upon to witness such a brutal thing. He wanted
  to say good-bye to her, but was afraid of frightening her.</p>

  <p>"You remember that so sainted brother?" Oberzohn's voice was raucous with
  fury. Ahead of him the light fell upon a face.</p>

  <p>"Digby! Stay where you are!" shouted Leon.</p>

  <p>The sound of the explosion made him jump. He saw the brickwork above the
  doorway splinter, heard a little scuffle, and turned, gun in hand. Oberzohn
  had pulled the girl in front of him so that she afforded a complete cover:
  under her arm he held his pistol.</p>

  <p>"Run!" she screamed.</p>

  <p>He hesitated a second. Again the pistol exploded and a bullet ricochetted
  from the door. Leon could not fire. Oberzohn so crouched that nothing but a
  trick shot could miss the girl and hit him. And then, as the doctor shook
  free the hand that gripped his wrist, he leapt down the steps and into the
  darkness. Another second and the door slammed. He heard the thrust of the
  bolts and a clang as the great iron bar fell into its place. Somehow he had a
  feeling as of a citadel door being closed against him.</p>

  <p>Dr. Oberzohn had returned unobserved, though the night was clear. Passing
  through the open water-gate he had tied up to the little quay and landed his
  unwilling passenger. Digby, according to instructions, had been making a
  careful circuit of the property, and at the moment was as far away from the
  barge as it was humanly possible to be. Unchallenged, the doctor had worked
  his way back to the house. The light in the hall warned him that somebody was
  there. How many? He could not guess.</p>

  <p>"Take off your shoes," he growled in Mirabelle's ear, and she obeyed.</p>

  <p>Whatever happened, he must not lose touch of her, or give her an
  opportunity to escape. Still grasping her arm with one hand and his long
  Mauser pistol in the other, he went softly up the steps, got into the hall
  and listened, locating the intruder instantly.</p>

  <p>It all happened so quickly that Mirabelle could remember nothing except
  the desperate lunge she made to knock up the pistol that had covered the
  spine of Leon Gonsalez. She stood dumbly by, watching this horrible old man
  fasten the heavy door, and obediently preceded him from room to room. She saw
  the long cases in the hot room and shrank back. And then began a complete
  tour of the house. There were still shutters to be fastened, peep-holes to be
  opened up. He screwed up the shutters of the servants' room, and then, with a
  hammer, broke the thumb-piece short.</p>

  <p>"You will stay here," he said. "I do not know what they will do. Perhaps
  they will shoot. I also am a shooter!"</p>

  <p>Not satisfied with the lock that fastened her door, he went into his
  workshop, found a staple, hook and padlock, and spent the greater part of an
  hour fixing this additional security. At last he had finished, and could put
  the situation in front of four very interested men.</p>

  <p>He unlocked the door of the concrete annexe and called the crestfallen
  gunmen forth, and in a very few words explained the situation and their
  danger.</p>

  <p>"For every one of you the English police hold warrants," he said. "I do
  not bluff, I know. This afternoon I was visited by the police. I tell you I
  do not bluff you&mdash;me they cannot touch, because they know nothing, can
  prove nothing. At most I shall go to prison for a few years, but with you it
  is different."</p>

  <p>"Are they waiting outside?" asked one suspiciously. "Because, if they are,
  we'd better move quick."</p>

  <p>"You do not move, quick or slow," said Oberzohn. "To go out from here
  means certain imprisonment for you all. To stay, if you follow my plan, means
  that every one of you may go free and with money."</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" asked Cuccini. "Are you going to fight them?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I am going to fight them," nodded Oberzohn. "That is my scheme. I
  have the young miss upstairs; they will not wish to do her any harm. I intend
  to defend this house."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean you're going to hold it?" asked one of the staggered men.</p>

  <p>"I will hold it until they are tired, and make terms."</p>

  <p>Cuccini was biting his nails nervously.</p>

  <p>"Might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, boss," he growled. "I've got
  an idea you've roped us into this."</p>

  <p>"You may rope yourself out of it!" snapped Oberzohn. "There is the
  door&mdash;go if you wish. There are police there; make terms with them. A
  few days ago you were in trouble, my friend. Who saved you? The doctor
  Oberzohn. There is life imprisonment for every one of you, and I can hold
  this house myself. Stay with me, and I will give you a fortune greater than
  any you have dreamt about. And, more than this, at the end you shall be
  free."</p>

  <p>"Where's Gurther?"</p>

  <p>"He has been killed&mdash;by accident." Oberzohn's face was working
  furiously. "By accident he died," he said, and told the truth unconvincingly.
  "There is nothing now to do but to make a decision."</p>

  <p>Cuccini and his friends consulted in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"What do we get for our share?" he asked, and Oberzohn mentioned a sum
  which staggered them.</p>

  <p>"I speak the truth," he said. "In two days I shall have a gold-mine worth
  millions."</p>

  <p>The habit of frankness was on him, and he told them the story of the
  golden hill without reservations. His agents at Lisbon had already obtained
  from the Ministry an option upon the land and its mineral rights. As the
  clock struck twelve on June 14, the goldfield of Biskara automatically passed
  into his possession.</p>

  <p>"On one side you have certain imprisonment, on the other you have great
  moneys and happiness."</p>

  <p>"How long will we have to stay here?" asked Cuccini.</p>

  <p>"I have food for a month, even milk. They will not cut the water because
  of the girl. For the same reason they will not blow in the door."</p>

  <p>Again they had a hasty consultation and made their decision.</p>

  <p>"All right, boss, we'll stay. But we want that share-out put into
  writing."</p>

  <p>"To my study," said Oberzohn promptly, "march!"</p>

  <p>He was half-way through writing the document when there came a thunderous
  knock on the door and he got up, signalling for silence. Tiptoeing along the
  passage, he came to the door.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;who is that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Open, in the name of the law!" said a voice, and he recognized Meadows.
  "I have a warrant for your arrest, and if necessary the door will be broken
  in."</p>

  <p>"So!" said Oberzohn, dropped the muzzle of his pistol until it rested on
  the edge of the little letter-slit and fired twice.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap33"
     id="chap33">XXXIII.&mdash;THE SIEGE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">But Meadows had already been warned to keep clear of the
  letter-box, and the bullets eventually reached one of the railway viaducts,
  to the embarrassment of a road ganger who happened to be almost in the line
  of fire.</p>

  <p>Meadows slipped down the steps to cover. Inside the wire fence a dozen
  policemen were waiting. "Sergeant, go back to the station in the police car
  and bring arms," he said. "This is going to be a long job."</p>

  <p>Gonsalez had made a very careful reconnaissance of the ground, and from
  the first had recognized the difficulties which lay ahead of the attacking
  party. The wall rose sheer without any break; such windows as were within
  reach were heavily shuttered; and even the higher windows, he guessed, had
  been covered. The important problem in his mind was to locate the room in
  which the girl was imprisoned, and making a mental review of the house, he
  decided that she was either in the servants' apartment or in that which had
  held Gurther. By the light of the lantern he made a rapid sketch plan of the
  floors he had visited.</p>

  <p>Meadows had gone away to telephone to police headquarters. He had decided
  to re-establish telephone connection with the doctor, and when this was done,
  he called the house and Oberzohn's voice answered him.</p>

  <p>The colloquy was short and unsatisfactory. The terms which the doctor
  offered were such as no self-respecting Government could accept. Immunity for
  himself and his companions (he insisted so strongly upon this latter offer
  that Meadows guessed, accurately, that the gang were standing around the
  instrument).</p>

  <p>"I don't want your men at all. So far as I am concerned, they can go
  free," said Meadows. "Ask one of them to speak on the 'phone."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed, no," said Oberzohn. "It is ridiculous to ask me that."</p>

  <p>He hung up at this point and explained to the listening men that the
  police had offered him freedom if he would surrender the gang.</p>

  <p>"As I already told you," he said in conclusion, "that is not the way of
  Dr. Oberzohn. I will gain nothing at the expense of my friends."</p>

  <p>A little later, when Cuccini crept into the room to call police
  head-quarters and confirm this story of the doctor, he found that not only
  had the wire been cut, but a yard of the flex had been removed. Dr. Oberzohn
  was taking no risks.</p>

  <p>The night passed without any further incident. Police reserves were
  pouring into the neighbourhood; the grounds had been isolated, and even the
  traffic of barges up and down the canal prohibited. The late editions of the
  morning newspapers had a heavily head-lined paragraph about the siege of a
  house in the New Cross area, and when the first reporters arrived a fringe of
  sightseers had already gathered at every police barrier. Later, special
  editions, with fuller details, begun to roll out of Fleet Street; the crowd
  grew in density, and a high official from Scotland Yard, arriving soon after
  nine, ordered a further area to be cleared, and with some difficulty the
  solid wedge of humanity at the end of Hangman's Lane was slowly pushed back
  until the house was invisible to them. Even here, a passageway was kept for
  police cars and only holders of passes were allowed to come within the
  prohibited area.</p>

  <p>The three men, with the police chief, had taken up their head-quarters in
  the factory, from which the body of Gurther had been removed in the night.
  The Deputy Commissioner, who came on the spot at nine and examined the dead
  snakes, was something of a herpetologist, and pronounced them to be veritable
  <i>fers-de-lance</i>, a view from which Poiccart differed.</p>

  <p>"They are a species of African tree snakes that the natives call mamba.
  There are two, a black and a green. Both of these are the black type."</p>

  <p>"The Zoo mamba?" said the official, remembering the sensational
  disappearance of a deadly snake which had preceded the first of the snake
  mysteries.</p>

  <p>"You will probably find the bones of the Zoo mamba in some mole run in
  Regent's Park&mdash;he must have been frozen to death the night of his
  escape," said Poiccart. "It was absolutely impossible that at that
  temperature he could live. I have made a very careful inspection of the land,
  and adjacent to the Zoological Gardens is a big stretch of earth which is
  honeycombed by moles. No, this was imported, and the rest of his menagerie
  was imported."</p>

  <p>The police chief shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Still, I'm not convinced that a snake could have been responsible for
  these deaths," he said, and went over the ground so often covered.</p>

  <p>The three listened in polite silence, and offered no suggestion.</p>

  <p>The morning brought news of Washington's arrival in Lisbon. He had left
  the train at Irun, Leon's agent in Madrid having secured a relay of
  aeroplanes, and the journey from Irun to Lisbon had been completed in a few
  hours. He was now on his way back.</p>

  <p>"If he makes the connections he will be here to-night," he told Manfred.
  "I rather think he will be a very useful recruit to our forces."</p>

  <p>"You're thinking of the snakes in the house?"</p>

  <p>Leon nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know Oberzohn," he said simply, and George Manfred thought of the girl,
  and knew the unspoken fears of his friend were justified.</p>

  <p>The night had not been an idle one for Oberzohn and his companions. With
  the first light of dawn they had mounted to the roof, and, under his
  direction, the gunmen had dismantled the four sheds which stood at each
  corner of the parapet. Unused to the handling of such heavy metal, the
  remnants of the Old Guard gazed in awe upon the tarnished jackets of the
  Maxim guns that were revealed.</p>

  <p>Oberzohn understood the mechanism of the machines so thoroughly that in
  half an hour he had taught his crew the method of handling and sighting. In
  the larger shed was a collapsible tripod, which was put together, and on this
  he mounted a small but powerful searchlight and connected it up with one of
  the plugs in the roof.</p>

  <p>He pointed to them the three approaches to the house: the open railway
  arches and the long lane, at the end of which the crowd at that moment was
  beginning to gather.</p>

  <p>"From only these places can the ground be approached," he said, "and my
  little quick-firers cover them!"</p>

  <p>Just before eleven there came down Hangman's Lane, drawn by a motor
  tractor, a long tree-trunk, suspended about the middle by chains, and
  Oberzohn, examining it carefully through his field-glasses, realized that no
  door in the world could stand against the attack of that battering-ram. He
  took up one of the dozen rifles that lay on the floor, sighted it carefully,
  resting his elbow on the parapet, and fired.</p>

  <p>He saw the helmet of a policeman shoot away from the head of the
  astonished man, and fired again. This time he was more successful, for a
  policeman who was directing the course of the tractor crumpled up and fell in
  a heap.</p>

  <p>A shrill whistle blew; the policemen ran to cover, leaving the machine
  unattended. Again he fired, this time at the driver of the tractor. He saw
  the man scramble down from his seat and run for the shelter of the fence.</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour passed without any sign of activity on the part of
  his enemies, and then eight men, armed with rifles, came racing across the
  ground towards the wire barrier. Oberzohn dropped his rifle, and, taking a
  grip of the first machine-gun in his hand, sighted it quickly. The staccato
  patter of the Maxim awakened the echoes. One man dropped; the line wavered.
  Again the shrill whistle, and they broke for cover, dragging their wounded
  companion with them.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid of that," said Leon, biting his knuckles&mdash;sure evidence
  of his perturbation.</p>

  <p>He had put a ladder against the wall of the factory, and now he climbed up
  on to the shaky roof and focussed his glasses.</p>

  <p>"There's another Maxim on this side," he shouted down. And then, as he saw
  a man's head moving above the parapet, he jerked up his pistol and fired. He
  saw the stone splinters fly up and knew that it was not bad practice at four
  hundred yards. The shot had a double effect; it made the defenders cautious
  and aroused in them the necessary quantity of resentment.</p>

  <p>He was hardly down before there was a splutter from the roof, and the
  whine and snap of machine-gun bullets; one slate tile shivered and its
  splinters leapt high in the air and dropped beside his hand.</p>

  <p>The presence of the girl was the only complication. Without her, the end
  of Oberzohn and his companions was inevitable. Nobody realized this better
  than the doctor, eating a huge ham sandwich in the shelter of the
  parapet&mdash;an unusual luxury, for he ate few solids.</p>

  <p>"This will be very shocking for our friends of Curzon Street," he said.
  "At this moment they bite their hands in despair." (He was nearly right
  here.)</p>

  <p>He peeped over the parapet. There was no policeman in sight. Even the
  trains that had roared at regular intervals along the viaduct had ceased to
  run, traffic being diverted to another route.</p>

  <p>At half-past twelve, looking through a peep-hole, he saw a long yellow
  line of men coming down Hangman's Lane, keeping to the shelter of the
  fence.</p>

  <p>"Soldiers," he said, and for a second his voice quavered.</p>

  <p>Soldiers they were. Presently they began to trickle into the grounds, one
  by one, each man finding his own cover. Simultaneously there came a flash and
  a crack from the nearest viaduct. A bullet smacked against the parapet and
  the sound of the ricochet was like the hum of a bee.</p>

  <p>Another menace had appeared simultaneously; a great, lumbering, awkward
  vehicle, that kept to the middle of the lane and turned its ungainly nose
  into the field. It was a tank, and Oberzohn knew that only the girl's safety
  stood between him and the dangling noose.</p>

  <p>He went down to see her, unlocked the door, and found her, to his
  amazement, fast asleep. She got up at the sound of the key in the lock, and
  accepted the bread and meat and water he brought her without a word.</p>

  <p>"What time is it?"</p>

  <p>Oberzohn stared at her.</p>

  <p>"That you should ask the time at such a moment!" he said.</p>

  <p>The room was in darkness but for the light he had switched on.</p>

  <p>"It is noon, and our friends have brought soldiers. Ach! how important a
  woman you are, that the whole army should come out for you!"</p>

  <p>Sarcasm was wasted on Mirabelle.</p>

  <p>"What is going to happen&mdash;now?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know." He shrugged his shoulders. "They have brought a
  diabolical instrument into the grounds. They may use it, to give them cover,
  so that the door may be blown in. At that moment I place you in the
  snake-room. This I shall tell our friends very quickly."</p>

  <p>She gazed at him in horror.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't do anything so wicked, Mr. Oberzohn!"</p>

  <p>Up and down went the skin of his forehead.</p>

  <p>"That I shall tell them and that I shall do," he said, and locked her in
  with this comfortless assurance.</p>

  <p>He went into his study and, fastening the door, took two strands of wire
  from his pocket and repaired the broken telephone connections.</p>

  <p>"I wish to speak to Meadows," he said to the man who answered him&mdash;a
  police officer who had been stationed at the exchange to answer any call from
  this connection.</p>

  <p>"I will put you through to him," was the reply.</p>

  <p>For a moment the doctor was surprised that Meadows was not at the
  exchange. He did not know then that a field telephone line had been
  organized, and that the factory headquarters of the directing staff was in
  communication with the world.</p>

  <p>It was not Meadows, but another man who answered him, and by his tone of
  authority Oberzohn guessed that some higher police official than Meadows was
  on the spot.</p>

  <p>"I am the doctor Oberzohn," he barked. "You have brought a tank machine to
  attack me. If this approaches beyond the wire fence, I shall place the woman
  Leicester in the home of the snakes, and there I will bind her and release my
  little friends to avenge me."</p>

  <p>"Look here&mdash;" began the officer, but Oberzohn hung up on him.</p>

  <p>He went out and locked the door, putting the key in his pocket. His one
  doubt was of the loyalty of his companions. But here, strangely enough, he
  underrated their faith in him. The very mildness of the attack, the seeming
  reluctance of the soldiers to fire, had raised their hopes and spirits; and
  when, a quarter of an hour later, they saw the tank turn and go out into
  Hangman's Lane, they were almost jubilant.</p>

  <p>"You're sure that he will carry out his threat?" asked the police
  chief.</p>

  <p>"Certain," said Leon emphatically. "There is nothing on earth that will
  stop Oberzohn. You will force the house to find a man who has died by his own
  hand, and&mdash;" He shuddered at the thought. "The only thing to be done is
  to wait for the night. If Washington arrives on time, I think we can save
  Miss Leicester."</p>

  <p>From the roof Dr. Oberzohn saw that the soldiers were digging a line of
  trenches, and sent a spatter of machine-gun bullets in their direction. They
  stopped their work for a moment to look round, and then went on digging, as
  though nothing had happened.</p>

  <p>The supply of ammunition was not inexhaustible, and he determined to
  reserve any further fire until the attack grew more active. Looking over the
  top of the parapet to examine the ground immediately below, something hot and
  vicious snicked his ear. He saw the brickwork of the chimney behind him
  crumble and scatter, and, putting up his hand, felt blood.</p>

  <p>"You'd better keep down, Oberzohn," said Cuccini, crouching in the shelter
  of the parapet. "They nearly got you then. They're firing from that railway
  embankment. Have you had a talk with the boss of these birds?"</p>

  <p>"They are weakening," said Oberzohn promptly. "Always they are asking me
  if I will surrender the men; always I reply, 'Never will I do anything so
  dishonourable.'"</p>

  <p>Cuccini grunted, having his own views of the doctor's altruism.</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon, a flight of aeroplanes appeared in, the west: five
  machines flying in V formation. None of the men on the roof recognized the
  danger, standing rather in the attitude and spirit of sightseers. The
  machines were flying low; with the naked eye Cuccini could read their numbers
  long before they came within a hundred yards of the house. Suddenly the roof
  began to spout little fountains of asphalt. Oberzohn screamed a warning and
  darted to the stairway, and three men followed him out. Cuccini lay
  spread-eagled where he fell, two machine-gun bullets through his head.</p>

  <p>The fighting machines mounted, turned and came back. Standing on the floor
  below, Oberzohn heard the roar of their engines as they passed, and went
  incautiously to the roof, to discover that the guns of flying machines fire
  equally well from the tail. He was nearer to death then than he had ever
  been. One bullet hit the tip of his finger and sliced it off neatly. With a
  scream of pain he half fell, half staggered to safety, spluttering strange
  oaths in German.</p>

  <p>The aeroplanes did not return. He waited until their noise had died away
  before he again ventured to the roof, to find the sky clear. Cuccini was
  dead, and it was characteristic of his three friends that they should make a
  thorough search of his pockets before they heaved the body over the
  parapet.</p>

  <p>Oberzohn left the three on the roof, with strict instructions that they
  were to dive to cover at the first glint of white wings, and went down into
  his study. The death of Cuccini was in some ways a blessing. The man was full
  of suspicion; his heart was not in the fight, and the aeroplane gunner had
  merely anticipated the doctor's own plan.</p>

  <p>Cuccini was a Latin, who spoke English well and wrote it badly. He had a
  characteristic hand, which it amused Oberzohn to copy, for the doctor was
  skilful with his pen. All through the next three hours he wrote, breaking off
  his labours at intervals to visit the guard on the roof. At last he had
  finished, and Cuccini's sprawling signature was affixed to the bottom of the
  third page. Oberzohn called down one of the men.</p>

  <p>"This is the statement of Cuccini which he left. Will you put your name to
  his signature?"</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked the man surlily.</p>

  <p>"It is a letter which the good Cuccini made&mdash;what generosity! In this
  he says that he alone was to blame for bringing you here, and nobody else.
  Also that he kept you by threats."</p>

  <p>"And you?" asked the man.</p>

  <p>"Also me," said Oberzohn, unabashed. "What does it matter? Cuccini is
  dead. May he not in his death save us all? Come, come, my good friend, you
  are a fool if you do not sign. After that, send down our friends that they
  may also sign."</p>

  <p>A reluctant signature was fixed, and the other men came one by one, and
  one by one signed their names, content to stand by the graft which the doctor
  indicated, exculpating themselves from all responsibility in the defence.</p>

  <p>Dusk fell and night came blackly, with clouds sweeping up from the west
  and a chill rain falling. Gonsalez, moodily apart from his companions,
  watched the dark bulk of the house fade into the background with an
  ever-increasing misery. What these men did after did not matter&mdash;to
  them. A policeman had been killed, and they stood equally guilty of murder in
  the eyes of the law. They could now pile horror upon horror, for the worst
  had happened. His only hope was that they did not know the inevitability of
  their punishment.</p>

  <p>No orders for attack had been given. The soldiers were standing by, and
  even the attack by the aeroplanes had been due to a misapprehension of
  orders. He had seen Cuccini's body fall, and as soon as night came he
  determined to approach the house to discover if there was any other way in
  than the entrance by the front door.</p>

  <p>The aeroplanes had done something more than sweep the roof with their
  guns. Late in the evening there arrived by special messenger telescopic
  photographs of the building, which the military commander and the police
  chief examined with interest.</p>

  <p>Leon was watching the house when he saw a white beam of light shoot out
  and begin a circular sweep of the grounds. He expected this; the meaning of
  the connections in the wall was clear. He knew, too, how long that experiment
  would last. A quarter of an hour after the searchlight began its erratic
  survey of the ground, the lamp went out, the police having disconnected the
  current. But it was only for a little while, and in less than an hour the
  light was showing again.</p>

  <p>"He has power in the house&mdash;a dynamo and a gas engine," explained
  Gonsalez.</p>

  <p>Poiccart had been to town and had returned with a long and heavy steel
  cylinder, which Leon and Manfred carried between them into the open and left.
  They were sniped vigorously from the roof, and although the firing was rather
  wild, the officer in charge of the operations forbade any further movement in
  daylight.</p>

  <p>At midnight came the blessed Washington. They had been waiting for him
  with eagerness, for he, of all men, knew something that they did not know.
  Briefly, Leon described the snake-room and its contents. He was not
  absolutely certain of some of the species, but his description was near
  enough to give the snake expert an idea of the species.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, they're all deadly," said Washington, shaking his head. "I
  guess there isn't a thing there, bar the scorps, who wouldn't put a grown man
  to sleep in five minutes&mdash;ten minutes at the most."</p>

  <p>They showed him the remains of the dead snake and he instantly recognized
  the kind, as the zoological expert had done in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"That's mamba. He's nearly the deadliest of all. You didn't see a fellow
  with a long bill-shaped head? You did? Well that's fer-de-lance, and he's
  almost as bad. The little red fellows were corals... "</p>

  <p>Leon questioned him more closely.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, they don't leap&mdash;that's not their way. A tree snake will
  hang on to something overhead and get you as you pass, and they'll swing from
  the floor, but their head's got to touch the floor first. The poor little
  fellow that killed Gurther was scared, and when they're scared they'll lash
  up at you&mdash;I've known a man to be bitten in the throat by a snake that
  whipped up from the ground. But usually they're satisfied to get your
  leg."</p>

  <p>Leon told him his plan.</p>

  <p>"I'll come along with you," said Washington without hesitation.</p>

  <p>But this offer neither of the three would accept. Leon had only wanted the
  expert's opinion. There were scores of scientists in London, curators of
  museums and keepers of snakes, who could have told him everything there was
  to be known about the habits of the reptile in captivity. He needed somebody
  who had met the snake in his native environment.</p>

  <p>An hour before daylight showed in the sky, there was a council of war,
  Leon put his scheme before the authorities, and the plan was approved. He did
  not wait for the necessary orders to be given, but, with Poiccart and
  Manfred, went to the place where they had left the cylinder, and, lifting it,
  made their slow way towards the house. In addition, Leon carried a light
  ladder and a small bag full of tools.</p>

  <p>The rays of the searchlight were moving erratically, and for a long time
  did not come in their direction. Suddenly they found themselves in a circle
  of dazzling light and fell flat on their faces. The machine-gun spat
  viciously, the earth was churned up under the torrent of bullets, but none of
  the men was hit; and, more important, the cylinder was not touched.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, from every part of the ground, firing started. The target
  was the searchlight, and the shooting had not gone on for more than a minute
  before the light went out, so jerkily that it was obvious that one bullet at
  least had got home.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Manfred, and, lifting up the cylinder, they ran. Poiccart put
  his hand on the fence wire and was hurled back. The top wire was alive, but
  evidently the doctor's dynamo was not capable of generating a current that
  would be fatal. Leon produced an insulated wire cutter and snipped off a
  six-foot length, earthing the broken ends of the wire. They were now under
  the shadow of the wall of the house, and out of danger so far as bullets were
  concerned.</p>

  <p>Leon planted his ladder against the window under which they stopped, and
  in a second had broken the glass, turned the catch and sent up the sash. From
  his bag he produced a small diamond drill and began to work through the thick
  steel plate. It was a terribly arduous job, and after ten minutes' labour he
  handed over the work to Manfred, who mounted in his place.</p>

  <p>Whatever damage had been done to the searchlight had now been repaired,
  and its beam had concentrated on the spot where they had been last seen. This
  time no fusillade greeted its appearance, and Oberzohn was surprised and
  troubled by the inaction.</p>

  <p>The light came into the sky, the walls grew grey and all objects sharply
  visible, when he saw the tank move out of the lane where it had been standing
  all the previous day, turn into the field, and slowly move towards the house.
  He set his teeth in a grin and, darting down the stairs, flung himself
  against the door of the girl's room, and his agitation was such that for a
  time he could not find the keyhole of the two locks that held the door
  secure.</p>

  <p>It opened with a crash, and he almost fell into the room in his eagerness.
  Mirabelle Leicester was standing by the bed, her face white as death. Yet her
  voice was steady, almost unconcerned, when she asked:</p>

  <p>"What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"You!" he hissed. "You, my fine little lady&mdash;you are for the
  snakes!"</p>

  <p>He flung himself upon her, though she offered no resistance, threw her
  back on the bed and snapped a pair of rusty handcuffs on her wrists. Pulling
  her to her feet, he dragged her from the room and down the stairs. He had
  some difficulty in opening the door of the snake-room, for he had wedged it
  close. The door was pushed open at last: the radiators were no longer
  burning. He could not afford the power. But the room was stiflingly hot, and
  when he turned on the lights, and she saw the long line of boxes, her knees
  gave way under her, and she would have fallen had he not put his arm about
  her waist. Dragging a heavy chair to the centre of the room, he pushed her
  down into it.</p>

  <p>"Here you wait, my friend!" he yelled. "You shall wait... but not
  long!"</p>

  <p>On the wall there were three long straps which were used for fastening the
  boxes when it was necessary to travel with them. In a second one thong was
  about her and buckled tight to the back of the chair. The second he put under
  the seat and fastened across her knee.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, gracious lady!"</p>

  <p>The rumble of the tank came to him in that room. But he had work to do.
  There was no time to open the boxes. The glass fronts might easily be broken.
  He ran along the line, hitting the glass with the barrel of his Mauser. The
  girl, staring in horror, saw a green head come into view through one opening;
  saw a sinuous shape slide gently to the floor. And then he turned out the
  lights, the door was slammed, and she was left alone in the room of
  terror.</p>

  <p>Oberzohn was no sooner in the passage than the first bomb exploded at the
  door. Splinters of wood flew past him, as he turned and raced up the stairs,
  feeling in his pocket as he went for the precious document which might yet
  clear him.</p>

  <p>Boom!</p>

  <p>He had not locked the door of the snake-room; Leon had broken the hasp.
  Let them go in, if they wished. The front door was not down yet. From the
  landing above he listened over the balustrade. And then a greater explosion
  than ever shook the house, and after an interval of silence he heard somebody
  running along the passage and shake at the snake-room door.</p>

  <p>Too late now! He grinned his joy, went up the last flight to the roof, to
  find his three men in a state of mutiny, the quelling of which was not left
  to him. The glitter of a bayonet came through the door opening, a khaki
  figure slipped en to the roof, finger on trigger.</p>

  <p>"Hands up, you!" he said, in a raucous Cockney voice.</p>

  <p>Four pairs of hands went upward.</p>

  <p>Manfred followed the second soldier and caught the doctor by the arm.</p>

  <p>"I want you, my friend," he said, and Oberzohn went obediently down the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>They had to pass Gurther's room: the door was open, and Manfred pushed his
  prisoner inside, as Poiccart and Leon ran up the stairs.</p>

  <p>"The girl's all right. The gas killed the snakes the moment they touched
  the floor, and Brother Washington is dealing with the live ones," said Leon
  rapidly.</p>

  <p>He shut the door quickly. The doctor was alone for the first time in his
  life with the three men he hated and feared.</p>

  <p>"Oberzohn, this is the end," said Manfred.</p>

  <p>That queer grimace that passed for a smile flitted across the puckered
  face of the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I think not, my friends," he said. "Here is a statement by Cuccini. I am
  but the innocent victim, as you will see. Cuccini has confessed to all and
  has implicated his friends. I would not resist&mdash;why should I? I am an
  honest, respectable man, and a citizen of a great and friendly country.
  Behold!"</p>

  <p>He showed the paper. Manfred took it from his hand but did not read
  it.</p>

  <p>"Also, whatever happens, your lady loses her beautiful hill of gold." He
  found joy in this reflection. "For to-morrow is the last day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stand over there, Oberzohn," said Manfred, and pushed him against the
  wall. "You are judged. Though your confession may cheat the law, you will not
  cheat us."</p>

  <p>And then the doctor saw something and he screamed his fear. Leon Gonsalez
  was fixing a cigarette to the long black holder he had found in Gurther's
  room.</p>

  <p>"You hold it thus," said Leon, "do you not?" He dipped the cigarette down
  and pressed the small spring that was concealed in the black ebonite. "The
  holder is an insulated chamber that holds two small icy splinters&mdash;I
  found the mould in your laboratory, Herr Doktor. They drop into the
  cigarette, which is a metal one, and then... "</p>

  <p>He lifted it to his lips and blew. None saw the two tiny icicles fly. Only
  Oberzohn put his hand to his cheek with a strangled scream, glared for a
  second, and then went down like a heap of rags.</p>

  <p>Leon met Inspector Meadows on his way up.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid our friend has gone," he said. "He has cheated the hangman of
  ten pounds."</p>

  <p>"Dead?" said Meadows. "Suicide?"</p>

  <p>"It looks like a snake-bite to me," said Leon carelessly, as he went down
  to find Mirabelle Leicester, half laughing, half crying, whilst an earnest
  Elijah Washington was explaining to her the admirable domestic qualities of
  snakes.</p>

  <p>"There's five thousand dollars' worth dead," he said, in despair, "but
  there's enough left to start a circus!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap34"
     id="chap34">XXXIV.&mdash;THE DEATH TUBE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">LATER Manfred explained to an interested police chief.</p>

  <p>"Oberzohn secured the poison by taking a snake and extracting his
  venom&mdash;a simple process: you have but to make him angry, and he will
  bite on anything. The doctor discovered a way of blending these venoms to
  bring out the most deadly qualities of them all&mdash;it sounds fantastic,
  and, from the scientists' point of view, unlikely. But it is nevertheless the
  fact. The venom was slightly diluted with water and enough to kill a dozen
  people was poured into a tiny mould and frozen."</p>

  <p>"Frozen?" said the chief, in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Manfred nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt about it," he said. "Snake venom does not lose its
  potency by being frozen, and this method of moulding their darts was a very
  sane one, from their point of view. It was only necessary for a microscopic
  portion of the splinter to pierce the flesh. Sufficient instantly melted to
  cause death, and if the victim rubbed the place where he had been struck, it
  was more certain that he would rub some of the venom, which had melted on his
  cheek, into the wound. Usually they died instantly. The cigarette holders
  that were carried by Gurther and the other assassin, Pfeiffer, were
  blowpipes, the cigarette a hollow metal fake. By the time they blew their
  little ice darts, it was in a half-molten condition and carried sufficient
  liquid poison to kill, even if the skin was only punctured. And, of course,
  all that did not enter the skin melted before there could be any examination
  by the police. That is why you never found darts such as the bush-men use,
  slithers of bamboo, thorns from trees. Oberzohn had the simplest method of
  dealing with all opposition: he sent out his snake-men to intercept them, and
  only once did they fail&mdash;when they aimed at Leon and caught that
  snake-proof man, Elijah Washington!"</p>

  <p>"What about Miss Leicester's claim to the goldfields of Biskara?"</p>

  <p>Manfred smiled.</p>

  <p>"The renewal has already been applied for and granted. Leon found at
  Heavytree Farm some blank sheets of note-paper signed with the girl's name.
  He stole one during the aunt's absence and filled up the blank with a formal
  request for renewal. I have just had a wire to say that the lease is
  extended."</p>

  <p>He and Poiccart had to walk the best part of the way to New Cross before
  they could find a taxicab. Leon had gone on with the girl. Poiccart was
  worried about something, and did not speak his mind until the providential
  cab appeared on the scene and they were trundling along the New Cross
  Road.</p>

  <p>"My dear George, I am a little troubled about Leon," he said at last. "It
  seems almost impossible to believe, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what?" asked Manfred good-humouredly, and knowing what was
  coming.</p>

  <p>"You don't believe," said Poiccart in a hushed voice, as though he were
  discussing the advent of some world cataclysm&mdash;"you don't believe that
  Leon is in love, do you?"</p>

  <p>Manfred considered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Such things happen, even to just men," he said, and Poiccart shook his
  head sadly.</p>

  <p>"I have never contemplated such an unhappy contingency," he said, and
  Manfred was laughing to himself all the way back to town.</p>
