  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE story of the alleged disappearance of Evelyn Cross was
  too fantastic for credence. According to the available evidence, she melted
  into thin air shortly after four o'clock on a foggy afternoon in late
  October. One minute, she was visible in the flesh&mdash;a fashionable blonde,
  nineteen years of age and weighing about eight and a half stone.</p>

  <p>The next minute, she was gone.</p>

  <p>The scene of this incredible fade-out was an eighteenth-century mansion in
  Mayfair. The Square was formerly a residential area of fashion and dignity.
  It had escaped a doom of complete reconstruction, but some of the houses were
  divided up into high-class offices and flats.</p>

  <p>This particular residence had been renamed "Pomerania House" by its owner,
  Major Pomeroy. He speculated in building property and had his estate office,
  as well as his private flat, on the premises.</p>

  <p>The ex-officer might be described as a business gentleman. Besides being
  correctly documented&mdash;Winchester, Oxford and the essential
  clubs&mdash;he had not blotted his financial or moral credit. In appearance
  he conformed to military type, being erect, spare and well dressed, with a
  small dark tooth-brush moustache. His voice was brisk and his eyes keen. He
  walked with a nonchalant manner. He had two affectations&mdash;a monocle and
  a fresh flower daily in his buttonhole.</p>

  <p>Shortly after four o'clock on the afternoon of Evelyn Cross' alleged
  disappearance, he was in the hall of Pomerania House, leaning against the
  door of his flat, when a large car stopped in the road outside. The porter
  recognized it as belonging to a prospective client who had called previously
  at the estate office to inquire about office accommodation. With the
  recollection of a generous tip, he hurried outside to open the door.</p>

  <p>Before he could reach it, Raphael Cross had sprung out and was standing on
  the pavement. He was a striking figure, with the muscular development of a
  pugilist and a face expressive of a powerful personality. Its ruthless
  force&mdash;combined with very fair curling hair and ice-blue eyes&mdash;made
  him resemble a conception of some old Nordic god, although the comparison
  flattered him in view of his heavy chin and bull-neck.</p>

  <p>He crashed an entrance into the hall, but his daughter, Evelyn, lingered
  to take a cigarette from her case. She was very young, with a streamlined
  figure, shoulder-length blonde hair and a round small-featured face. With a
  total lack of convention she chatted freely to the porter as he struck a
  match to light her cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Confidentiality, we shouldn't have brought our dumb-bell of a chauffeur
  over from the States. He's put us on the spot with a traffic cop."</p>

  <p>"Can't get used to our rule of the road," suggested the porter who
  instinctively sided with Labour.</p>

  <p>"It is a cockeyed rule to keep to the left," admitted Evelyn. "We took a
  terrible bump in one jam. I'm sure I heard our number plate rattle. You might
  inspect the damage."</p>

  <p>To humour her, the porter strolled to the rear of the car and made a
  pretence of examining the casualty before he beckoned the chauffeur to the
  rescue. When he returned to the hall, the major had already met his visitors
  and was escorting them up the stairs.</p>

  <p>The porter gazed speculatively after them, watching the drifting smoke of
  the girl's cigarette and the silver-gold blur of her hair in the dusk. The
  skirt of her tight black suit was unusually short so that he had an
  unrestricted view of her shapely legs and of perilously high-heeled
  shoes.</p>

  <p>As he stood there, he was joined by an attractive young lady with ginger
  hair and a discriminating eye. Her official title was "Miss Simpson," but she
  was generally known in the building by her adopted name of "Marlene." She was
  nominally private secretary to a company promoter who had his office on the
  second floor; but as the post was a sinecure she spent much of her time in
  the ladies' cloakroom on the ground floor, improving her appearance for
  conquest.</p>

  <p>"Admiring the golden calf?" she asked, appraising the quality of the
  silken legs herself before they disappeared around the bend of the
  staircase.</p>

  <p>"She's got nothing on you there, Marlene," declared the porter.</p>

  <p>He had a daughter who was a student at a commercial school and was biased
  in favour of typists.</p>

  <p>"Except her stockings, Daddy. Where's the boss taking them?"</p>

  <p>"I was asking myself that. The gent's a party after an office. There's
  only a small let vacant, right at the top and that's not in his class."</p>

  <p>"Maybe the girl's going to Goya to get her fortune told," suggested the
  ornamental typist, tapping her teeth to suppress a yawn.</p>

  <p>For nearly ten minutes she lingered at the foot of the stairs, chatting to
  the porter and on the outlook to intercept any drifting male. The place,
  however, was practically deserted, so presently she mounted the flight on her
  way back to her office. She paused when she reached the landing of the first
  floor, where there were three mahogany doors in line, each embellished with a
  chromium numeral.</p>

  <p>Just outside the middle door&mdash;No. 16&mdash;the major stood talking to
  Raphael Cross. Impressed by the striking appearance of the fair stranger, she
  patted the wave of her ginger hair and lingered in the hope of making a fresh
  contact.</p>

  <p>Consequently she became a witness to the beginning of the amazing drama
  which was later entered in Alan Foam's case book as "Disappearance of Evelyn
  Cross."</p>

  <p>Although she was friendly with the major, on this occasion he was neither
  responsive nor helpful. He merely returned her smile mechanically. Only a
  keen observer might have noticed a flicker of satisfaction in his hawk-like
  eye, as though he had been expecting her.</p>

  <p>Then he started the show, like the White Rabbit in Alice in Wonderland, by
  pulling out his watch.</p>

  <p>"Your daughter's keeping you a dickens of a time," he remarked to Cross.
  "I thought she said she'd be only a minute. You're a patient man."</p>

  <p>"Used to it." Cross grimaced in continental fashion. "I'll give her a
  ring."</p>

  <p>He prodded the electric bell of No. 16 with a powerful forefinger. After a
  short interval it was opened by the tenant of the apartment&mdash;Madame
  Goya.</p>

  <p>She was stout, shortish and middle-aged. Her blued-white permanently waved
  hair did not harmonize with an incongruous dusky make-up and orange lipstick.
  Her eyes were dark, treacly and protruding, in spite of being set in deep
  pouches. She wore an expensive black gown which flattered her figure and a
  beautiful emerald ring.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell my daughter I'm ready to go,' said Cross.</p>

  <p>"Pardon?" asked the woman aggressively. "Your daughter?"</p>

  <p>When Cross amplified his request, she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Miss Cross was here only to make an appointment. She left some time
  ago."</p>

  <p>"Left?" echoed Cross. "Which way?"</p>

  <p>"Through this door, of course."</p>

  <p>He stared at her as though bewildered.</p>

  <p>"But the major and I have been standing outside," he said, "and I'll swear
  she never came out."</p>

  <p>"Definitely not," agreed Major Pomeroy. "Are you sure she's not still
  inside, madame?"</p>

  <p>"If you don't believe me, come in and see for yourself," invited Madame
  Goya.</p>

  <p>Throbbing with curiosity, the ornamental typist crept to the closed door
  of No. 16, after the men had gone inside. She heard voices raised in angry
  excitement and the sound of furniture being bumped about. Presently the major
  came out alone. His face wore a dazed expression as he took hold of her
  elbow.</p>

  <p>"You've just come upstairs. Beautiful, haven't you?" he asked. "I suppose
  you did not notice a blonde in black coming down?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "I didn't meet a pink elephant either. It's not my day
  for seeing things. What's all the blinking mystery?"</p>

  <p>"Hanged if I know," said the major helplessly. "Boss out, isn't he? Be a
  good girl and nip round to every office and flat in the place. Ask if
  anyone's seen her. They haven't. I know that. But I've got to satisfy her
  father."</p>

  <p>The ornamental typist made no objection to being useful, for a change. She
  spun out her inquiries to a series of social calls throughout Pomerania
  House. True to the major's forecast, no one had seen a loose blonde, so
  presently she returned to the first floor.</p>

  <p>Raphael Cross, the fair stranger who had attracted her fancy, had come out
  of No. 16 and was pacing the landing as though on the verge of distraction.
  Her first glance at him told her that it was no time for overtures. His
  features were locked in rigid lines and his eyes looked both fierce and
  baffled. He glared after the figure of the porter as the man returned to his
  station in the hall. The major spoke to him in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"You heard what the fellow said. I've known him for years before I
  employed him. He's definitely reliable."</p>

  <p>"The hell he is," growled Cross. "Someone's lying. Where's my girl?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we'll find her. I admit it's an extraordinary affair. Almost uncanny.
  I'm at a loss to account for it, myself. But you may be sure there's some
  simple explanation."</p>

  <p>"I know that. This is a put-up job. There's someone behind all of this.
  It's an infernal conspiracy."</p>

  <p>Major Pomeroy stiffened perceptibly, while the sympathy died from his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Who do you suspect?' he asked coldly.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you when I've got my girl back. I don't leave this ruddy place
  without her. Order that porter to see to it that no one goes out of this
  building until there's been a systematic search through."</p>

  <p>"Certainly... Shall I ring up the police?"</p>

  <p>The question checked Cross' hysteria like a snowball thrown in his face.
  He hesitated and gnawed his lip for some seconds before he made his
  decision.</p>

  <p>"No, Pomeroy." His voice was low. "This may be kidnapping. If it is, the
  police are best kept out."</p>

  <p>The major's hostility melted instantly.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said in a feeling voice. "Come down to my office and
  I'll ring up a reliable private detective agency."</p>

  <p>Halfway down the stairs, he returned to caution Marlene.</p>

  <p>"Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut&mdash;there's a good girl."</p>

  <p>"Cross my heart."</p>

  <p>Within two minutes after the men had entered the major's office, she was
  telling the whole story to the tenant of the flatlet, No, 15. This
  lady&mdash;according to her visiting card inserted in the slot of the
  door&mdash;was named "Viola Green," while her occupation was supposed to be
  that of a mannequin.</p>

  <p>She limped out onto the landing, her hands in her pockets and a cigarette
  between her lips; yet, in spite of her pose of nonchalance, there was no hint
  of stereotyped boredom in her face. Her expression in its vivid expectancy
  was a challenge to the future, as though she claimed the maximum from life
  and refused to admit to compromise.</p>

  <p>She was distinctly attractive, although both face and figure were somewhat
  too thin. Her short black hair had bright brown gleams and her eyes were
  hazel-green. She wore black slacks, a purple-blue pullover and rubbed silver
  sandals.</p>

  <p>Although the majority of males in Pomerania House were on friendly terms
  with Marlene Simpson, the women avoided speaking to her. Viola Green was the
  exception. She was not only unhampered by snobbery or moral criticism, but
  she was responsive to a psychic bond between them.</p>

  <p>Both girls were held in allegiance to the lure of the profession. Viola
  had studied at an academy of dramatic art, while Marlene had toured the
  provinces as a glamour girl in a cheap revue. Total lack of success had
  forced them into uncongenial jobs, but their thwarted instincts drew them
  together to discuss the stars of stage and screen with passionate
  interest.</p>

  <p>On this occasion, Viola only wanted to hear the scenario of the drama on
  the first-floor landing.</p>

  <p>"So what?" she asked, with an economy of language familiar to Marlene.</p>

  <p>She listened to the story with wide-eyed open-mouthed interest, but at its
  end she made the requisite ribald comment.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've heard of people wanting to reduce quickly, but that's
  overdoing it... Was she kidnapped?"</p>

  <p>"That's what it looks like to me," replied the ornamental typist. "I saw
  her go up and I was mucking about in the hall all the time afterwards. But
  she never came down, unless she's the Invisible Man."</p>

  <p>"What's your guess?" asked Viola.</p>

  <p>"I believe Goya stunned and gagged her. She'd about ten minutes to play
  with. Then she hid her in a cubby-hole behind the panelling. There might be
  one behind the mirror or at the back of the clothes closet. But the blonde's
  father swears he won't go until she is found, so he'll soon scoop her out...
  Oh boy, you should see father&mdash;hundred per cent Aryan and like an
  earthquake. He's got that look in his eye that tells you he knows all the
  answers."</p>

  <p>Viola, who was growing bored, distracted her attention.</p>

  <p>"Your telephone's been ringing for ages," she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard it," commented Marlene. "Sounds quite profane. I seem to
  recognize my master's voice. Perhaps I'd better listen to his little trouble.
  See you later. Bye-bye."</p>

  <p>She mounted the stairs in a leisurely fashion while Viola stood and gazed
  down into the hall. About this time, when dusk blurred its modern
  improvements, the old mansion had power to fascinate her. She did not recall
  the patched and powdered ghosts of Berkeley Square but only the lately
  receded tide of the last century, as she thought of the families who had
  lived private lives within those walls.</p>

  <p>In those spacious days, the offices had been double drawing rooms where
  parties were held. Girls in white tulle frocks had sat on the stairs and
  flirted with their partners behind feather fans. Children had peeped down
  enviously from between the banisters.</p>

  <p>But now the clocks were stopped and the music stilled. Sighing at the
  thought, she limped across to the tall windows at the end of the landing.
  Outside, the Square Garden was spectral with misted shadows and tremulous
  with tattered leaves shaking from the plane trees. In the distance a sports
  car hooted through the darkness.</p>

  <p>It was driven by Alan Foam, who was on his way to investigate the alleged
  disappearance of Evelyn Cross.</p>

  <p>Viola was still gripped by the story, although her common sense rejected
  it as nonsense. At that time she was yearning after her old gods and
  suffering from histrionic starvation. Unable to resist the chance of
  dramatizing herself, she stretched out her hands and groped in the air. "Lost
  girl," she whispered. "Where are you?"</p>

  <p>As she waited, the lights were turned on throughout the building. She
  heard the faint tapping of typewriters and the distant ringing of telephone
  bells. The atmosphere of Pomerania House was entirely normal&mdash;commercial
  and financial.</p>

  <p>There was no warning wave from the future to tell her that this was a
  prelude to a moment charged with horror, when she would cry out in anguish to
  someone who was not there and get no answer from the empty air.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash;NUMBER SIXTEEN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Alan Foam was asked why he had become a private
  detective he explained that he liked solving riddles and wanted an occupation
  which would take him out-of-doors. His original ambition had been the secret
  service, but circumstances forced him to accept his father's compromise of a
  share in the firm of Girdlestone &amp; Gribble.</p>

  <p>On the whole he was disappointed with the work. Instead of adventures, his
  main activities were protecting people from blackmail and aiding them to
  procure divorce. In the course of a few years he became tough and cynical,
  with no illusions as to the fragrance of hotel bedrooms and with a conviction
  that the human species had evolved the most deadly type of blood-sucking
  parasite.</p>

  <p>At times when his mind rebelled against its storage of gross details, he
  considered the antidote suggested by his mother.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you marry, Alan?"</p>

  <p>"Waiting for the right girl," he told her. 'I've checked too many hotel
  registers."</p>

  <p>"Well, hurry up and find her." She added inconsequently, "You used to be
  such a dear little boy." There were times, however, when he was keenly
  interested in his work, especially when his enterprise had been recognized by
  his superiors. It was after one of these rare occasions that he leaped to the
  telephone and tried to disentangle the statement from Major Pomeroy's
  secretary.</p>

  <p>It appeared so unlike the routine case of disappearance that he was afraid
  it was too good to be true.</p>

  <p>"You say she's gone&mdash;but she never left the building?" he
  queried.</p>

  <p>"Well, it sounded like that when they were both shouting at me," replied
  the girl doubtfully. "But it doesn't make sense. I suppose I got it
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"Never mind. I'm on my way."</p>

  <p>As Foam scorched through the dun shadows of the Square, he was struck by
  its derelict appearance. It seemed darkened by a pall of antiquity and decay.
  The old houses might have been barnacled hulks of vessels stranded in a
  dry-dock by the receded tide of fashion.</p>

  <p>When he approached Pomerania House, it suddenly glowed with lighted
  windows. A large and powerful car was parked outside, while the porter stood
  on the pavement, fraternally scanning the stop press in the chauffeur's
  paper.</p>

  <p>Following his custom, Foam looked keenly at both men. The chauffeur was a
  clumsy Hercules, showing a section of standardized glum face below his
  goggles. The porter appealed more to Foam as a type of labour. He was
  elderly, with a square, sensible face and steady blue eyes.</p>

  <p>He did not return Foam's approval, for he looked at him sourly. The
  detective understood the reason for his instinctive antipathy. He knew that
  he was regarded as a by-product of the police force and consequently to be
  avoided like a mild form of plague.</p>

  <p>The porter stiffened as he spoke to the chauffeur in his official
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Your guv'nor says not to wait for him. He may be kept here till
  midnight."</p>

  <p>"Am I to come back and fetch Miss Evelyn?" asked the chauffeur.</p>

  <p>His voice was tinctured with curiosity, but the porter was not to be
  drawn.</p>

  <p>"I've given you the message," he said. After the car had driven on, he
  spoke to Foam. "From the agency? You're expected. This way." Foam followed
  him through the lobby and into the hall of Pomerania House. As he looked
  around him he had partly the sensation of being in a museum. Its proportions
  were fine, although some of its space had been encroached on by offices. Most
  of the panelling on the walls had been preserved and also a large oval
  portrait in a tarnished gilt frame, which hung over the original carved
  mantelpiece. This was a painting of a former owner of the house by Sir Joshua
  Reynolds and depicted a Georgian buck with full ripe cheeks and a powdered
  wig.</p>

  <p>The old crystal chandelier&mdash;long disused&mdash;was still suspended
  from the ceiling. The statue of a nymph, posed on a pedestal, gazed
  reproachfully at all who used the telephone booth, as though it were the
  bathing hut where she had left her clothes and to which they denied her
  re-entry.</p>

  <p>He with these relics of the eighteenth century, the flagged marble floor,
  as well as the shallow treads of the curving mahogany staircase, was covered
  with the thick rubber flooring of commerce. The radiators were not concealed
  and the panel lighting was modern, to correspond with the low painted doors
  leading to the reconstructed portions. The porter jerked his thumb towards
  the staircase.</p>

  <p>"Up there," he said. "First floor. I can't take you up. My orders are not
  to leave this door."</p>

  <p>"No lift?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"No. The boss did as little conversion as possible... One never
  knows."</p>

  <p>Foam nodded to show he understood the threat&mdash;the shadowy pick of the
  house breaker swinging over the old mansion. He hurried across the hall and
  ran up the stairs, covering three steps in each stride.</p>

  <p>Three persons&mdash;two men and a stout woman&mdash;stood on the first
  landing, while a ginger-haired girl loitered on the flight of stairs leading
  up to the next floor. Foam recognized Major Pomeroy, whom he knew by sight,
  but in any case it would have been easy to pick out the father of the missing
  girl. Cross was plainly gripped by violent emotion, for his large hands were
  clenched and his jaws set in an effort to control his facial muscles.</p>

  <p>The major came forward to meet him and introduce him to his client; but
  Foam cut out the preliminaries. Ignoring the others, he telescoped the
  incoherent explanations he had received over the telephone into a concise
  statement as he spoke to Cross.</p>

  <p>"Your daughter has disappeared and there is no time to lose. Give me the
  facts."</p>

  <p>Braced by the curt voice, Cross recovered his self-control.</p>

  <p>"We came here together just about four," he said. "My daughter went into
  that room." He nodded towards No. 16. "She never came out."</p>

  <p>"Then she must be inside still," said Foam.</p>

  <p>"No. She has disappeared."</p>

  <p>Foam stared at him, wondering whether he were knave or fool. He might be
  the instigator of some cunning trick&mdash;as yet unidentified&mdash;or
  himself the victim of a confidence trick.</p>

  <p>"Who is the tenant of No, 16?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am," declared the stout woman, surging forward. "I am Goya. Madame came
  to see me about placing an order for hand-made gloves."</p>

  <p>Although he was repulsed by her huge painted frog-mouth, her meretricious
  appearance, Foam spoke pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Let me have your story, please."</p>

  <p>"It's a pleasure," said Goya grandly. "Madame stood just inside the door.
  I looked up and asked, 'Appointment?' You must understand my time is too
  valuable to waste on chance callers. She shook her head, so I said, 'Kindly
  write for one. Good afternoon.' She left at once. In fact, she was in and out
  again without opening and shutting the door a second time."</p>

  <p>Foam turned to Cross.</p>

  <p>"While you were waiting, I suppose you and the major were talking? Can you
  remember what it was about?"</p>

  <p>Cross looked blankly at the major who answered for him. "We started by
  discussing business&mdash;I was trying to interest Mr. Cross in some office
  accommodation, but he was unable to make an immediate decision. So we began
  to argue about Danzig."</p>

  <p>"Then I suggest that you were too engrossed to notice when your daughter
  slipped past you&mdash;especially as you were not expecting her to come out
  so soon."</p>

  <p>"No, it's a pack of lies," declared Cross. "The major and I stood here,
  facing the door. It was shut. We can both of us swear she never came
  out."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's not so simple as that," agreed the major. "The porter was
  in the hall and he states positively that she never came downstairs or left
  the building. One of the typists was there with him&mdash;and her story is
  the same as his... Miss Simpson. Would you mind coming down for a
  minute?"</p>

  <p>The ginger-haired girl came down the stairs with the assurance of an
  ex-"Lovely". Rolling her eyes at Cross, she smiled at Foam.</p>

  <p>"The major's got one of his facts wrong," she said. "I'm a private
  secretary&mdash;not a typist. But I'll sign on the dotted line for the
  rest."</p>

  <p>"That brings us back to No. 16," admitted Foam. "Is there any other way
  out of it? No door of communication between it and one of the adjoining
  rooms?"</p>

  <p>"Definitely not," declared the major.</p>

  <p>Foam glanced at the doors to the right and left of No. 16. "Who rent
  these?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Two girls on their own," replied Major Pomeroy. "Miss Power is in No. 57
  and Miss Green in No. 15. Neither of them saw Miss Cross. We have also
  inquired at all the flats and offices in the building. Every effort has been
  made to find her."</p>

  <p>Foam continued to gaze reflectively at the doors. "I suppose you have the
  customary references with your tenants?" he asked, as he considered the
  dubious personality of Madame Goya.</p>

  <p>"I do not," replied the major. "To my mind, that rule penalizes strangers.
  I prefer a gentleman's agreement. I can trust to my judgment to size up
  anyone. Besides an unsatisfactory tenant gets spot-notice."</p>

  <p>He laughed as he added, "I've discovered that references are not
  infallible. For instance, I don't know a thing about Miss Power except that
  she is a student. But she's an ideal tenant&mdash;quiet and regular with her
  payments. On the other hand, Miss Green is a bishop's granddaughter and she's
  a little scamp."</p>

  <p>"Quite. I'll have a look at No. 16. But I want a word with the porter
  first."</p>

  <p>Feeling a need to clarify the situation, Foam hurried downstairs. He was
  not satisfied by what he had already heard. Although three persons had given
  him the same facts, he could not ignore the factor of mass suggestion. But he
  instinctively trusted the porter, who reminded him of a gardener he had known
  in boyhood.</p>

  <p>When he reached the hall, the man was at his post, watching the door.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?' asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"Higgins," replied the porter.</p>

  <p>"Well, Higgins, can you be sure that it was Mr. Cross' daughter that you
  saw go upstairs? The lights were not turned on."</p>

  <p>"I saw her face when I lit her fag," replied the porter positively. "She
  came here once before with her father, so I knew her by sight."</p>

  <p>"Did you actually see her go into No. 16?"</p>

  <p>"No. You can't see the landing from the hall because of the bend of the
  stairs. But I saw the three of them go up, and so did Marlene Simpson."</p>

  <p>"Is there a back entrance to Pomerania House?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the door's over there. But she'd have to come down the stairs and
  cross the hall to reach it&mdash;and she didn't. It's a blinking mystery to
  me."</p>

  <p>Foam was on the point of turning away when he asked another question on
  impulse.</p>

  <p>"Higgins, you see a good many people. In confidence, can you place Mr.
  Cross?"</p>

  <p>"I'd say he was a gentleman," replied the porter. "Not Haw-haw, like the
  boss, but a bit colonial."</p>

  <p>"And Miss Cross?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, there you have me. I know a lady and I know a tart; but when they try
  to behave like each other, I get flummoxed."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;Miss Cross was lively?"</p>

  <p>"That's right."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Higgins. That's all."</p>

  <p>Foam was on the point of going upstairs when he stopped to peep through
  the open door of an office which had Major Pomeroy's name painted on the
  frosted glass panels. A little girl with a pale, intelligent face and large
  horn-rimmed glasses stopped typing and looked up at him expectantly.</p>

  <p>"I'm from the agency," he explained. "Do you happen to know Mr. Cross'
  private telephone number?"</p>

  <p>He blessed her for her instant grasp of his meaning.</p>

  <p>"That's been attended to," she said. "The major told me to ring up the
  apartment hotel where Mr. Cross is staying before I got on to you. They had
  no news of her, but the major said it was too soon."</p>

  <p>"Nice work," approved Foam. "Keep ringing the number."</p>

  <p>Running upstairs to the landing where Cross and the major were still
  waiting, he opened the door of No. 16.</p>

  <p>It was a typical example of the architecture of its period&mdash;large and
  lofty, with an ornate ceiling and cornice decorated with plaster mouldings of
  birds, flowers and fruit. The walls were panelled with cream-painted-wood,
  much of which was hidden by fixtures&mdash;a cupboard wardrobe, a tall
  erection of book shelves and a full-length mirror in a tarnished gilt frame.
  A huge oil painting of a classical subject&mdash;a goddess supported by
  super-clouds and surrounded by a covey of cupids&mdash;took up much
  space.</p>

  <p>It was furnished in modern style, with a conventional suite of a divan and
  two large easy chairs which might have come from any window of a furnishing
  store. The colouring of the upholstery was neutral and toned with the buff
  Axminster carpet. Madame Goya's personal taste was indicated by cushions of
  scarlet and peacock blue and by a couple of sheepskin rugs dyed in
  distinctive tints of jade and orange. The open grate had also been modernised
  with built-in tiles and an electric fire.</p>

  <p>Such was No. 16&mdash;the room in which, according to the inference of the
  evidence, a girl had faded into air.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; PROTECTION OF PROPERTY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOAM did not need the aid of Euclid to reject the vanishing
  theory as absurd. If the girl were actually lost inside Pomerania House, it
  stood to reason that she must be still there&mdash;in the flesh. It seemed to
  him that the mystery admitted one of two explanations.</p>

  <p>The first was that Evelyn Cross had slipped away voluntarily out of the
  house. Unfortunately, the chances of this were remote, since it involved
  choosing the identical blind moment of four witnesses, all endowed with
  normal senses.</p>

  <p>The second was that she had been kidnapped&mdash;in which case Goya must
  be the agent. This, too, was not a watertight theory. Apart from the
  necessity of co-operation with another person&mdash;or persons&mdash;in
  Pomerania House, Goya would have to devise as ingenious and foolproof hiding
  place for her victim, in view of the inevitable search of her premises.</p>

  <p>Foam considered that such a crime would be highly hazardous, but he had no
  choice in the matter he had either to find the girl&mdash;dead or
  alive&mdash;or to disprove her father's suspicions. Cross was in no mental
  state to wait patiently for proof that Evelyn had merely slipped away.
  Besides, delay was dangerous because, in the worst case, the girl would be
  gagged and trussed-up in a restricted space, with a shortage of air.</p>

  <p>At the far end of her room, Madame Goya sat at a small table near the
  radiator, stitching gloves. An adjustable lamp threw a cone of light upon her
  work, but left her face in shadow. Behind her were closely drawn window
  curtains of lined brown velvet.</p>

  <p>Foam looked around for the evidence of a bed other than the inadequate
  divan, before he asked a question.</p>

  <p>"Do you sleep here, madame?"</p>

  <p>"I?" repeated the lady incredulously. "What a grim idea. I have a flat in
  St. John's Wood&mdash;This is merely a lock-up place of business."</p>

  <p>It did not suggest a workshop to Foam's suspicious eye. It was so tidy and
  free from snippets or threads that he suspected the glove-making to be a
  blind to some dingier profession. At the same time he remembered the major's
  statement about objectionable tenants, so concluded that the line could not
  be too obvious.</p>

  <p>He turned to the major.</p>

  <p>"You searched the room thoroughly, of course?" he asked, "What about the
  window?"</p>

  <p>"It was closed and the shutters bolted," replied Major Pomeroy. "This room
  is nearly hermetically sealed&mdash;Madame prefers to work by artificial
  light."</p>

  <p>Foam's nose confirmed the statement. The temperature was that of a forcing
  frame, while the air smelt of burnt pastilles, rotten apples and fog. He
  glanced at the open door of the cupboard wardrobe which revealed a fur coat
  on a stretcher, and then crossed to the long mirror.</p>

  <p>"Sure there is no door hidden behind this?" he asked as he tried to shake
  the frame.</p>

  <p>"Look for yourself," invited the major. "The rawl-plugs are fixed as tight
  as a vice and there are no signs of tampering. You can take it from me that
  I've examined and tested every fixture personally."</p>

  <p>"Not enough," declared Foam. "They must all come down."</p>

  <p>He was surprised by the relief in Cross' eyes.</p>

  <p>"I'll say this for you. Major," he said. "You know how to pick them. This
  young man seems to understand." Holding Foam's arm in a powerful clutch, as
  though to enforce his sympathy, he went on speaking. "You understand, don't
  you? I'm a stranger over here in a strange city and my daughter disappears in
  a strange house; not a friend near. No one I can trust or count on. It's like
  banging at a locked door. I can't get in."</p>

  <p>"Everything is being done," said the major in a soothing voice, "I've rung
  up my builder and asked him to come over. He should be here soon."</p>

  <p>"Soon?" repeated Cross with savage scorn. "Stop spoon-feeding me with dill
  water. While we're wasting time, what's happening to her? It's easy for you
  to be calm, but it's my girl that's gone. I'll break up the place if I have
  to do it myself."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he gripped the mirror and tried to tear it from the wall.</p>

  <p>In spite of his acquired crust and his ingrained suspicion of emotion,
  Foam felt a certain sympathy with his client. He had recently lost a
  favourite dog while he was exercising it in one of the parks. He soon
  regained it since his profession gave him a pull in dealing with dog thieves;
  but he still remembered the sharp thud of his heart when no cocker spaniel
  answered to his whistle and the horrible emptiness of the expanse of
  grass.</p>

  <p>In order to give Cross time to recover, he turned to Major Pomeroy. "Who
  is this builder you've sent for?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He's the man who does all my conversion work," explained the major. "He's
  only in a small way of business, but he's honest and capable. His name's
  Morgan. To save time"&mdash;he stressed the words for Cross' benefit&mdash;"I
  told him to bring along a couple of men with picks, just in case it may be
  necessary."</p>

  <p>"Good. I'll see if he's come."</p>

  <p>Glad of an excuse to leave the torrid room, Foam went outside onto the
  landing and looked down into the hall. As he waited, he took note of his
  surroundings. The upper portion of the mansion had been redecorated recently,
  for the rough parchment-tinted paper was clean; but there were a number of
  scratches on the enamel paint of the staircase wall, evidently caused by the
  arrival and removal of furniture.</p>

  <p>The damage seemed to point to the conclusion that, in spite of his system,
  the major's tenancies were short-lived. He was beginning to wonder the cause
  when the major gave him a practical proof of his consideration. He came out
  of No. 16 and stood beside Foam.</p>

  <p>"It's fair to put you wise," he said in a rapid whisper. "I can't vouch
  for Cross. I know nothing about him. Better watch your interests and ask for
  a cheque in advance."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. That's&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Foam broke off as Cross appeared. Biting on a cigarette and blowing it up
  into continuous smoke he began to tramp the landing as though unable to keep
  still. As he passed No. 15, the door was opened and a dark girl, wearing
  slacks, limped outside.</p>

  <p>With her arrival, a new element entered into Foam's life. He was one of
  those men who invest the past with glamour and whose boyhood was his happiest
  memory. Although he still lived in the same house&mdash;and liked it very
  much&mdash;it had shrunk and changed for the worse. The meals were not so
  good as they used to be. His parents had aged regrettably. The rest of the
  family had grown into uncongenial adults with families of their own. And the
  weather&mdash;which used to be perpetual summer&mdash;had gone to blazes.</p>

  <p>Among the friends of his boyhood was the gardener who had borne a
  resemblance to the porter of Pomerania House; but his most treasured
  recollection was of a black-haired schoolgirl who had spent one holiday at
  the house next door. She was from the country and she introduced him to new
  adventures of her own invention.</p>

  <p>He never forgot that enchanted summer or the girl who taught him to play.
  He never saw her again, but the instant he caught sight of the tenant of No.
  15, he felt a rush of welcome as though he were recapturing the companion of
  his youth. Even while he knew that the lady in trousers must be Miss Green
  and "a little scamp," according to the major's description, he fell under the
  old spell.</p>

  <p>She was certainly not shy, for she challenged attention by making an
  entrance as though she were on the stage. Her gaze flashed over the men like
  the sweep of a searchlight. Foam thought he had never seen so arresting a
  face as her eyes met his as though in unconscious greeting. Even when she
  spoke to Raphael Cross in a voice which was trained in elocution, he
  acquitted her of any charge of boldness. He felt instinctively that she was
  snatching a rare opportunity to test her personality and to hold the
  attention of an audience. "Have you found your daughter yet?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Cross shook his head without speaking. As the girl looked compassionately
  at him, Foam felt absurdly jealous of the fine build and fair curly hair of
  his client.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," the girl told him. "You've set about it entirely the
  wrong way. Why didn't you tell that young man"&mdash;her glance indicated
  Foam&mdash;"that you've lost an exclusive model gown? Leave out all mention
  of the girl who was wearing it. She'll only weaken the case... don't you
  realize that no one cares about the human element? All the laws are framed to
  protect property."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that rather sweeping?" asked Major Pomeroy.</p>

  <p>"I call it an understatement," declared the girl. "The law imprisons for
  theft but they only fine for cruelty. If I murdered you, the press would make
  me into a public heroine. I should be called a beautiful young brunette. But
  if I pinched a stamp off you, I should be put into quod and the papers would
  describe me as a young person. That's because stamps are property&mdash;and
  property is sacred."</p>

  <p>"But why pick on me?" asked the major indulgently. "Oh, by the way, this
  is Mr. Foam. He will probably want to interview you about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He bit off the end of his sentence&mdash;in deference to Cross'
  feelings&mdash;and mentioned the girl's name.</p>

  <p>"This is Miss Green, the tenant of No. 15."</p>

  <p>"Viola Green," supplemented the girl. "I'm called 'Greeny' on the set.
  Nice cool little name, does it make you think of tender young lettuce?"</p>

  <p>"No." said Foam. "Unripe apples."</p>

  <p>He was determined not to be biased by Viola's attraction. In order to
  escape, he turned to the major with a suggestion: "While we are waiting for
  the builder, suppose I have a few words with Miss Power? Merely routine."</p>

  <p>"You'll find her at home," said Viola, who seemed uncrushable. "Power's a
  lady. She peeks behind curtains while I run out into the street to see the
  accident. And she's incredibly rich. She has all the proper pots and pans. I
  know, for I borrow them."</p>

  <p>When Miss Power opened the door of No. 17 in response to the major's ring,
  Foam summed her up in his first glance.</p>

  <p>"Country rectory."</p>

  <p>She was about twenty-seven&mdash;probably younger&mdash;with short blunt
  features and a set expression which suggested strength of character. She was
  not perceptibly powdered and used no lipstick. Her thick fair hair was
  brushed back and worn in a small knot at her neck. She wore a tailor-built
  suit of blue-and-green speckled tweed&mdash;the skirt of which was calf
  length and revealed sports stockings and stout brogues.</p>

  <p>"Will you come in?" she asked formally, after the major had explained
  Foam's standing.</p>

  <p>As he looked round him, Foam noticed that the room was smaller than Madame
  Goya's and bore signs of being a living-place. It had evidently been
  converted into a flatlet by the expedient of chopping off a strip at one end,
  for part of it was concealed by a cream-painted wooden partition.</p>

  <p>There was the same standardized suite and buff Axminster carpet as in
  Goya's apartment, with the addition of a cheap wardrobe and an oak bureau.
  The central table was piled with books and papers, besides a portable
  typewriter and two framed photographs. One was a cabinet portrait of a
  clergyman&mdash;the other a hockey team of schoolgirls, wearing tunics and
  long black stockings.</p>

  <p>The faces were too small for recognition at that distance, but Foam was
  certain that Miss Power was among the players&mdash;probably as captain. Miss
  Power apologized for the disorder.</p>

  <p>"Rather a mess&mdash;but I'm studying at high pressure for an advanced
  exam. I've been working here all day. I've already told Major Pomeroy that
  I've seen no strange girl. No one, in fact."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear her voice?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Are these walls thick?"</p>

  <p>Miss Power glanced interrogatively at the major, who answered the
  question.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, the dividing wall between No. 16 and No. 17 is
  merely lath and plaster. The original wall was removed during the conversion.
  I had to take in some of Madame Goya's apartment to make the flatlet."</p>

  <p>"Rather a risk of disturbance in the case of a noisy tenant," commented
  Foam.</p>

  <p>"I hear nothing of the next-door tenant," remarked Miss Power coldly.</p>

  <p>Foam realized that it was characteristic of her type to profess ignorance
  of her neighbour's name, although she must see it daily on Goya's door. He
  also concluded that the glove maker's mysterious occupation was discreet, for
  Miss Power would not hesitate to lodge complaints.</p>

  <p>"Does the second door lead to your bedroom?" he asked, glancing at the
  partition.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Miss Power, "I sleep here on the divan. Kitchen, bath and
  the rest are down that end. Slum conditions&mdash;but one has to pay for an
  address... You can look inside."</p>

  <p>Foam inspected the premises alone, for the major took the opportunity to
  go outside. There was the anticipated clutter of cramped domestic fixtures,
  but no sign of an extra exit. Unless, however, the builder revealed a secret
  egress from No. 16, the adjoining flatlets were free from suspicion.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said. "I hope I shall not have to disturb your work again.
  If you should learn of anything unusual about this building or the tenants,
  will you let me hear. This is my number."</p>

  <p>Her swift glance at the photograph of the hockey team made him aware of
  his blunder. He had outraged her code of playing the game. Ignoring his card,
  she opened the door.</p>

  <p>"I'm too busy working to notice anyone or anything," she told him
  coldly.</p>

  <p>It was a relief to return to the landing and into a friendlier atmosphere.
  His heart felt absurdly light when Viola limped to meet him, as though she,
  too, recognized a bond between them. She might have been the playmate of his
  childhood inviting him to play, when she whispered to him from a corner of
  her mouth:</p>

  <p>"The major's in the hall, giving the builder the lowdown... Isn't this a
  thrill? Aren't you loving it?"</p>

  <p>"I should," replied Foam. "I'm getting paid for it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course. I forgot you're a cop. You look just a nice boy, with no
  brains and rather tough... Well, from the criminal angle, how does Power
  strike you? She reminds me of an underdeveloped 'still.' Too true to type...
  do you suspect her&mdash;or anyone?"</p>

  <p>With a rare wish to humour her, he compromised. "I'll tell you someone
  whom I trust. It's Higgins."</p>

  <p>"Who's 'Higgins'?" asked Viola.</p>

  <p>"The hall porter, of course."</p>

  <p>Viola began to laugh heartlessly. "You poor sap, don't you know the first
  rule is never tell your real name to a policeman? The porter is 'Pearce.' He
  double-crossed you all right."</p>

  <p>And then&mdash;swiftly and sweetly&mdash;just as his childish playmate
  used to relent after she made fun of him&mdash;Viola changed her mood.</p>

  <p>"You win," she said. "Pearce really is honest. He's hopeless at telephone
  lies. The time I've wasted, trying to corrupt him... Not dishonest lies. Just
  professional swank. You've got to swank in the profession... look, here's the
  builder."</p>

  <p>She stopped talking to gaze with frank interest at the builder. He was a
  burly Esau, with shaggy hair and bushy eyebrows. His face was hollowed by
  elongated pits&mdash;the graves of original dimples&mdash;and his brown eyes
  were a challenge to humbug. He gave an impression of bluff honesty, plus
  intelligence, but minus any scruples with regard to personal feelings.</p>

  <p>Foam liked him on sight, from his bowler hat to his square-toed boots. He
  commended him, too, for the brisk manner with which he came to the point.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; GIFT FROM CINDERELLA</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HAVING made his protest, the builder was now officially on
  the job. Calling his men from the hall, he clumped into No. 16 and gave a
  quick look around it.</p>

  <p>"Everyone outside, please," he ordered. As the only inmate of the room,
  Madame Goya recognized the personal note. She surged forward, her fat arms
  outstretched like the wings of a guardian angel, resisting pollution of her
  premises.</p>

  <p>"Pardon," she contradicted, "I shall stay. This is my flat. I am within my
  legal rights to see what goes on here."</p>

  <p>The builder, who was married, knew when he was outclassed he turned
  instinctively to the major for protection.</p>

  <p>"Can we run out the furniture, chief?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Afraid not," replied the major nonchalantly. "It would block the
  landing."</p>

  <p>"All right, you're the boss. But I warn you we'll waste time shifting all
  this junk about... Madame, I am sure you would prefer to remove your
  valuables yourself?"</p>

  <p>The workmen exchanged grins when Goya, with slow and measured movements,
  cleared from the book shelves a collection of odd china, dead flowers,
  cigarettes, packs of cards, cosmetics, a crystal, cactus plants and a tea
  outfit, besides a few novels which bore the labels of a twopenny lending
  library. She piled them up dangerously on the chairs and also upon the marble
  mantelpiece which had been retained when the grate was modernized.</p>

  <p>"Now then, get a move on," ordered the builder impatiently. "Start and
  shift the glass."</p>

  <p>Following his instructions, the men unscrewed the long mirror and propped
  it against an armchair. Its removal revealed no outline of a concealed door
  through which Evelyn Cross might have been whisked. There was nothing more
  incriminating than long drooping moustaches of cobwebs on the wall. The
  cupboard wardrobe was next wrenched from its position&mdash;not without
  damage to the panelling. Then the huge goddess came down to earth with a bump
  when her frame was swung off its nails.</p>

  <p>Soon the room was cluttered with fixtures, but Goya persisted in
  remaining, although the builder chased her from one refuge to another as he
  examined and sounded the woodwork. The major also stayed, apparently to
  protect his interests. Foam and Viola could only get an occasional glimpse of
  the proceedings, for Raphael Cross blocked the doorway.</p>

  <p>At first he watched every movement with concentrated eagerness; but with
  lack of results, his keenness staled and he could not control his impatience.
  As he paced the landing again, Viola drew Foam's attention to the fact he
  kept lighting cigarettes, only to throw them away after a few puffs.</p>

  <p>"He's like a planet," she whispered, "No rest for him... It makes me boil.
  You can see he's in hell&mdash;but the major is only worried about the damage
  to his precious property... Oh, come along&mdash;I want a front stall for the
  show."</p>

  <p>She plucked Foam's arm and dragged him across to the doorway. He noticed
  that she seemed actually to thrive on excitement, for her colour grew deeper
  under her rouge. Although he felt a curious pleasure in sharing the
  experience, he considered it his duty to warn her of a possible shock.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to say something you may not like," he told her.</p>

  <p>"Sounds like an overture," she remarked. "But I'm a modern girl. I can
  take it."</p>

  <p>"Just this. That girl's father is nearly off his rocker. Now I suspect he
  has grounds for his guess&mdash;whatever it is. That's why I want you to go
  back to your flat while the going's good.'</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because they may find her&mdash;and a murdered body is not a pleasant
  sight."</p>

  <p>Although her eyes expressed horror at the prospect, she was not
  convinced.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," she assured him. "I can't be sick for lack of raw
  material."</p>

  <p>At that moment, as though he were following Foam's train of thought, the
  builder spoke to Major Pomeroy.</p>

  <p>"The panelling is O.K., chief. We'll try the floor next for loose
  boards."</p>

  <p>He gave the order to the men.</p>

  <p>"Roll up the carpet. Shift the stuff as you go along."</p>

  <p>Wedged into a corner by a displaced divan, Madame Goya made an angry
  protest. "Am I included in the 'stuff'? Let me out, you idiots."</p>

  <p>Then she turned to jeer at the builder.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you think you're doing. If there was a trapdoor in the
  floor, the girl would have dropped through the ceiling of the room below.
  Very clever of you."</p>

  <p>Her eyes bulged at the builder's blunt explanation.</p>

  <p>"A body could be wedged in the space between the floor and the ceiling
  boards," he told her.</p>

  <p>"A body?" she repeated, in the rising note of hysteria. "Ah, now I'm
  beginning to understand. I've been very dense. I've only just realized that I
  am under suspicion."</p>

  <p>As the builder retreated before her threatening advance Major Pomeroy
  tried to soothe her.</p>

  <p>"No one is suspected," he said. "The idea is farcical. We are simply doing
  our best to satisfy Mr. Cross that his daughter is not on the premises."</p>

  <p>"Indeed? That doesn't fool me. Now it's my turn to give orders. I insist
  on this room being hacked to bits, to clear my character."</p>

  <p>"That's not necessary," explained the builder. "I've tested every inch of
  the walls and there's not the smell of a hollow ring."</p>

  <p>"What are you holding up the work for?" demanded Cross, pushing his way
  into the room. His ice-blue eyes glittered angrily at the major's
  explanation. "Haven't I made myself plain?" he asked. "Strip the
  walls&mdash;and to hell with the expense."</p>

  <p>"Finish the floor first," said the builder.</p>

  <p>His examination proved a lengthy business, owing to the accumulation of
  furniture. There were constant checks and displacements while the men rolled
  back yard after yard of carpet to expose dirty, stained boards. Foam was
  growing bored when a diversion was created by the major's secretary whom he
  had met in the office. She entered the room quietly and slipped a typewritten
  paper into her employer's hand. He glanced at it and then strolled across to
  Cross.</p>

  <p>"Mind signing this?" he asked casually. "It's merely to indemnity me for
  damage. Better read it first."</p>

  <p>Ignoring the advice, Cross scrawled his signature with a force which drove
  the pen into the paper. The major shrugged as he placed it inside his note
  case. "Not too satisfactory for me," he explained to Foam in a whisper
  "Merely a gentleman's agreement, it doesn't cover the ground, but I could not
  worry the poor chap with details." As he spoke, there was evidence of an
  increasing bill. With a crash, followed by the splintering of glass, the long
  mirror fell forward against the marble mantelpiece.</p>

  <p>Madame Goya screamed like a steam siren before she began to blame the
  nearest workman.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't me, mum." he declared firmly. "You moved the chair it was
  laying against."</p>

  <p>"But it shouldn't have been on the floor at all," she wailed. "It was safe
  on the wall. Who's going to buy me a new mirror?"</p>

  <p>"That will be taken care of," promised the major quickly as the builder
  rose from his knees. He dusted the knees of his trousers and shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Floor's not been tampered with," he said. "The window's screwed and the
  grate sealed. That only leaves the panelling."</p>

  <p>The men began the work of demolition in a gingerly manner, first loosening
  the panels before removing them carefully. Instead of commending their
  caution, however, their slow progress only exasperated Cross to fury.</p>

  <p>"Smash it up," he commanded.</p>

  <p>The builder caught the major's eye and nodded.</p>

  <p>"It's only cheap wood," he said. "It's not genuine old stuff."</p>

  <p>The men seemed to enjoy their job after they had received license to
  wreck. They hacked at the wood and tore it down in jagged sections while
  Viola gasped with rapture.</p>

  <p>"Gorgeous," she said. "I'm just in a mood to appreciate a nice spot of
  destruction."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"Because property can't feel. No nerves."</p>

  <p>"Any connection with the I.R.A.?"</p>

  <p>"No, no initials by request."</p>

  <p>"Then why have you got this extraordinary grudge against property?"</p>

  <p>"Because I am one of the unemployed," Viola told him. "Yesterday, I was a
  mannequin. I was showing a dress when I slipped on the polished floor and did
  a nose dive. I passed out cold&mdash;but no one bothered about a little thing
  like that. They reserved their sympathy for the model gown. I'd split it when
  I fell and it was ruined. So I was sacked."</p>

  <p>She stopped her story and caught hold of his hand.</p>

  <p>"I've got to clutch someone," she said. "I've been mopping it up&mdash;but
  now I'm growing afraid. There's only one panel left. It will be
  there&mdash;behind the last bit."</p>

  <p>She infected Foam with some of her apprehension. In spite of his common
  sense he could feel the electric quality of her suspense vibrating in her
  fingers as he watched the swinging picks of the men. He heard the heavy
  breathing of Raphael Cross, while Madame Goya stood motionless like an
  idol.</p>

  <p>Then the last section of panelling was removed&mdash;to reveal only a
  blank plaster surface...</p>

  <p>Foam was conscious of deep relief&mdash;and unconscious of a stifled
  flicker of disappointment. This case had promised to be something out of the
  ordinary. In spite of sordid eavesdropping and vigils, his sense of romance
  was not extinct. The secret service was still the poster of a thrilling
  film&mdash;plastered with foreign travel labels and drilled with bullet
  holes.</p>

  <p>But now the alleged disappearance of Evelyn Cross was revealed as the wild
  guesswork of hysteria. A man had lost his head and played the fool. Probably
  a drink too many over the odds.</p>

  <p>The time was still to come when he would envisage the case as a newspaper
  poster of a crime, with blood-stained corners flapping in the wintry
  rain&mdash;a record hideous with gruesome details of cold-blooded
  murder...</p>

  <p>At first, no one dared to look at Raphael Cross. The workmen began to grin
  but quickly composed their faces in recognition of an awkward situation. Then
  the builder spoke to Major Pomeroy.</p>

  <p>"The way out," he said, "is through this door. It's close on six. I'll be
  seeing you in the morning, chief."</p>

  <p>He hurried away as though to avoid any further argument, while the others
  straggled after him. As he reached the landing, the decorative
  typist&mdash;Marlene&mdash;began to descend the flight of stairs leading to
  the second floor. She was dressed for her homeward journey, for she wore a
  fur coat and a comedian's hat; but she had been waiting for her chance to see
  the mysterious Evelyn Cross again.</p>

  <p>The sound of six notes striking from a church tower in the Square made the
  builder glance at the tall grandfather's clock which stood out from the wall
  in one corner of the landing.</p>

  <p>"Stopped," he commented. "That's the worst of these antiques."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Grandpa still toddles more or less," explained Viola. "At his age, he
  likes a rest now and again&mdash;but he was going strong this afternoon."</p>

  <p>Her words made Foam glance casually at the clock, when he noticed that the
  hands were stationary at seven minutes past four. This was about the time
  when Evelyn Cross had visited Pomerania House.</p>

  <p>He could never explain the impulse which made him suddenly open the back
  of the case. As he groped in the interior, he could feel two foreign bodies
  which had interfered with the mechanism of the works. Drawing them out, he
  held them for inspection.</p>

  <p>A pair of fashionable ladies' shoes with very high heels.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; POTTED PERSONALITIES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no doubt in Foam's mind as to their ownership, He
  turned instinctively to Raphael Cross who was staring at them as though
  stunned.</p>

  <p>"Are these your daughter's shoes?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Cross dully.</p>

  <p>"Can you identify them positively?"</p>

  <p>Cross twisted his mouth in doubt before he shook his blonde head.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," she said. "But it's the kind she always wears."</p>

  <p>"You're sure there are no distinctive marks?" insisted Foam, thrusting the
  shoes into his hand.</p>

  <p>"Hell, how should I know? Her shoes all look alike to me."</p>

  <p>Although he himself hardly knew pink from blue, Foam was annoyed by this
  lack of paternal perception. Before he could connect the shoes positively
  with the missing girl, he would have to establish her claim by the tedious
  process of elimination.</p>

  <p>Fortunately Viola came to his rescue.</p>

  <p>"They aren't mine, worse luck," she said. "And they aren't Power's. She
  always wears the sensible sort, with low heels. Perhaps they belong to Madame
  Goya&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pardon," broke in a confident voice. "Those shoes are mine."</p>

  <p>Foam did not need Viola's gasp to realize that the claimant was a
  courageous opportunist. The decorative typist&mdash;Marlene&mdash;stepped
  forward and took the shoes from Cross' limp hands.</p>

  <p>"I bought them last week, in my lunch hour, at the Dolcis in Shaftesbury
  Avenue," she explained glibly. "They had a sale on. You can see the soles
  aren't marked. I've not worn them yet."</p>

  <p>"Last week?" commented Foam. "Why didn't you take them home?"</p>

  <p>"Because I've been out to dinner and pictures every evening. I couldn't
  lug a parcel round with me."</p>

  <p>"But how did they get inside the clock case?"</p>

  <p>"I can't even guess," replied the girl lightly. "Someone's idea of clean
  fun, I suppose... Well, thanks frightfully for finding them. Bye-bye."</p>

  <p>"And try checking up on that tale," muttered Viola ironically, as she
  watched Marlene's triumphant descent. "A sale and the lunch-hour rush. Nice
  little combination... Well, she's got them now for keeps&mdash;and good luck
  to her."</p>

  <p>"Am I right in concluding that young lady has a successful technique?"
  asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"Positively stunning," Viola told him. "She eats on the house. Everyone
  takes her out, from the boss to the office boy. Fair play to her; she treats
  them all alike... Now I'd be nice to the boy and snub the director. That's
  snob complex, really."</p>

  <p>She stopped talking as Madame Goya came on to the landing&mdash;her draped
  figure looking massive and majestic as the Statue of Liberty.</p>

  <p>"Don't let the men go," she commanded Major Pomeroy. "They'll have to move
  my things at once. It's up to you to find me good temporary quarters in this
  house... Impress on the builder to make a rush job of renovating No. 16. I
  can't risk losing my connection."</p>

  <p>"You shall have preferential treatment," the major assured her with dreary
  patience. "If you will go down to my office, I'll join you as soon as I
  possibly can."</p>

  <p>He glanced uneasily at Cross, who still stood staring into
  vacancy&mdash;and then basely shifted his responsibility to Foam.</p>

  <p>"You'll want to discuss this business with Mr. Cross," he said. "What
  about my flat? It's next to my office. You'll find drinks there."</p>

  <p>"Nothing for me," broke in Cross. "I've got to get this clear. Where's
  Evelyn? Where's my girl?"</p>

  <p>He staggered slightly and stared helplessly around him, as though trying
  to find a chair.</p>

  <p>Instantly Viola slipped her thin arm through his and marched him into No.
  15. She pushed him down onto the divan and then ducked behind the partition
  at the end of the room. When she came back, she was holding a small tumbler.
  "Drink this, darling, and you'll feel better," she invited Cross.</p>

  <p>When he made no attempt to take it&mdash;but sat and rubbed his
  eyeballs&mdash;she changed her tactics and gave him a smart slap on the
  cheek.</p>

  <p>"Snap out of it," she commanded.</p>

  <p>His response to treatment was immediate. His eyes lost their daze of
  apathy and the muscles of his face ceased twitching. For one moment, he
  glared at her as though he would attack her; then his fury gave way to
  surprise and he swallowed the brandy.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he said. "You understand."</p>

  <p>His self-control restored, he turned to Foam.</p>

  <p>"Now, young man," he said briskly, "I want to hear your opinion."</p>

  <p>"Suppose we consider the facts," suggested Foam. "Will you admit that your
  daughter could not have been kidnapped inside this house? It takes a
  complicated conjuring apparatus to work the 'Vanishing Lady
  Illusion'&mdash;and the builder proved the room had not been tampered with.
  Do you accept his report&mdash;and the evidence of your own eyes?"</p>

  <p>"I must," said Cross.</p>

  <p>"Good. The alternative theory is that she faded into air... Do you believe
  in the supernatural?"</p>

  <p>"Hell, no."</p>

  <p>"Then the only explanation is this. Your daughter slipped past you when
  all of you were too engrossed to notice her. This sort of thing has happened
  before. Famous pictures have been stolen from galleries when they've been
  crowded with tourists. The thief has contrived to choose the psychological
  moment when his confederate distracted their attention... Of course, in your
  daughter's case, it was unintentional and not deliberate. I feel sure she'll
  soon be back at your hotel."</p>

  <p>Foam stressed his words for he wanted to convince not only his client but
  himself. While common sense forced him to accept his own explanation, he knew
  that he had not flattened out every snarl in the tangle. It was true that
  five persons had declared that Evelyn Cross had gone upstairs and had not
  returned; but four of these witnesses were not entirely reliable. Cross was
  neurotic and the major influenced by his own interests, while neither Madame
  Goya nor Marlene inspired complete confidence.</p>

  <p>There remained the porter. Foam believed that his testimony was both
  honest and truthful; but he could not acquit the man of a natural
  self-deception. He was sure that Pearce did not remain at his post with the
  fidelity of the lava-submerged sentry at Herculaneum, because when he arrived
  at Pomerania House the porter was outside the house and fraternizing with
  Raphael Cross' chauffeur.</p>

  <p>Up to this point, therefore, the inference was that Evelyn Cross had made
  a voluntary disappearance&mdash;which was a rational deduction.
  Unfortunately, Foam's complete confidence had been flawed by the discovery of
  the shoes. Since it was obvious that they belonged to her&mdash;in spite of
  the typist's claim&mdash;they introduced an element of mystery into the
  case.</p>

  <p>Foam could not understand why Evelyn should have removed them as a
  preliminary to walking upon fog-slimed pavements, while her choice of a boot
  closet was even more perplexing. The mere act of opening and shutting the
  clock case would advertise her presence on the landing and shatter any
  alternative idea that she wished to creep away noiselessly upon stockinged
  soles.</p>

  <p>He was relieved when Cross sprang from his chair with restored vigour. "I
  am sure you are right," he said to Foam. "There's no need to worry."</p>

  <p>As he looked around him, his keen eyes' remarked the poverty of Viola's
  apartment. The familiar suite and buff Axminster carpet seemed to indicate
  that Major Pomeroy had semi-furnished these three rooms in order to exact an
  increased rental. There was little else besides a cretonne curtain&mdash;with
  pierrots printed on a black ground&mdash;which concealed a row of pegs and
  served as a substitute for a wardrobe.</p>

  <p>Instead of a mirror, a large bill of a stage performance by the London
  Repertory players was pinned over the mantelpiece. Cross picked out the name
  of "VIOLA GREEN" printed in small type.</p>

  <p>"Professional?" he asked, looking at her with new interest.</p>

  <p>"I'm trying to be one," she confessed. "It's funny. Power looks like a
  vicar's daughter and probably comes from a brothel. Now I am a scallywag, but
  I really am a parson's daughter. We're a tragic family. We're all in the
  church, and we want to go on the stage."</p>

  <p>"What happens then?" asked Cross.</p>

  <p>"We have to stick in the church. The tragedy is we have no talent. But
  fate's most ironic blow is this: My grandfather really is a born comedian,
  yet he will persist in being a bishop. No ambition."</p>

  <p>"Never mind. Perhaps I can help you. I've some influence in a film
  company... No strings to the offer, my dear. You've been good to me and I
  don't forget. I have a daughter of my own." The light gleamed on his fair,
  curling hair as he expanded his broad shoulders and drew himself up to his
  full height. His head was thrown back so that his heavy chin was merged into
  the powerful muscles of his neck. At that moment, he presented such a
  splendid type of self-assertive manhood that Foam&mdash;who was glad to be
  ordinary&mdash;felt a twinge of jealousy.</p>

  <p>"Here's my card," said Cross. "Send in your bill and you shall have a
  cheque. You stood by, and that helped... Good evening."</p>

  <p>"I'll come down with you," offered Viola.</p>

  <p>Foam did not attempt to accompany them, for he wanted to snatch the chance
  of making a few notes. Whenever he took up a new case, it was his custom to
  jot down his first impression of every person. It was essential to capture
  these mental snapshots without conscious thought, so that it could not be a
  reasoned opinion but merely an instinctive recognition of personality.</p>

  <p>The second step was to put the results in his office drawer and forget
  about them until the time came to compare them with his up-to-date knowledge
  of a client.</p>

  <p>On this occasion, he was afraid that he might be unable to trap an
  unbiased impression of Viola. Trying to make his mind a blank, he scrawled
  rapidly across the small pages of his notebook, as though his fingers were
  the medium of automatic writing.</p>

  <p>He snapped the elastic band over his book as Viola limped back into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," she invited. "I've still chairs left. If you'd come last week,
  you'd have seen me in all my glory with a gorgeous meretricious suite of
  veneered walnut. All the wrong people admired it. But the plain van took it
  away... Sorry I have no booze. Your client had the last drop."</p>

  <p>"What do you think of him?" asked Foam curiously.</p>

  <p>"Good looking in that way," commented Viola casually. "Gosh, he registered
  enough emotion for twenty fathers. I've got a hunch he is a sugar daddy. It
  would be enough to make him all steamed up if his girl walked out on him and
  he couldn't produce her to her lawful parents."</p>

  <p>Foam had too expert a knowledge of faked relationships to reject Viola's
  theory. As he was not concerned with the morality of a case, he even welcomed
  it because it helped to explain his own instinctive distrust of Cross. He had
  attributed it to unworthy prejudice, based on a dislike of spectacular good
  looks. But now he realized that the root of his suspicion was his inability
  to credit Cross with the ordinary feeling of a father. He could not imagine
  him tossing a baby up in the air or running a small daughter to school in his
  car. On the other hand, he could picture him at the races, cigar in the
  corner of his mouth, hat tilted over one eye and accompanied by a flash lady
  friend.</p>

  <p>He realized that Viola had curled herself in a big chair and was looking
  up at him with inquiring eyes.</p>

  <p>"He made rather a nasty crack when he told you to send in your bill." she
  said.</p>

  <p>"I shall charge him for my time," explained Foam.</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about your work."</p>

  <p>He slew the impulse to magnify his job.</p>

  <p>"I do hole-and-corner jobs for people who don't want police limelight," he
  said. "It's a sordid life. My mother thinks it has made me a rough and common
  person."</p>

  <p>"It's made you real. I've no use for fakes... have you got a fag?"</p>

  <p>As he lit her cigarette, he asked her a question. "Have you any idea of
  Goya's real business?"</p>

  <p>"I should say it's crystal gazing and a spot of blackmail," she replied.
  "Crowds of society people steal up to consult her. My guess is she's in with
  a bunch of business crooks and gets tips from tainted sources. I mean she
  bets on certainties and sometimes sells the dope to her clients. She knows
  which horse is going to be pulled and which round the heavyweight is going to
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"Have you heard of any trouble with the police?"</p>

  <p>"No. She'd be too cautious. When I asked her to tell me my fortune, you
  should have seen the dirty look she gave me."</p>

  <p>Although he believed the case was finished, Foam continued to tap her
  feminine intuition for the pleasure of watching each change of expression
  which swept over her vivid face. "Have you any slant on Miss Power?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No. If she's what she looks like, you know as much about her as I."</p>

  <p>"The major, then?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's a gentleman&mdash;even when I'm late with my rent. But he's like
  a gull after money. He sees it miles away and swoops."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. Thanks for everything. I've got to get back to the office."</p>

  <p>She looked after him wistfully when he reached the door. "It's been fun,
  hasn't it?" she said. "Come in again and tell me the end of the story."</p>

  <p>"I'll do that... But this is the end of the case." Foam spoke confidently
  and with conviction.</p>

  <p>On his return to the office, he outlined the affair to his
  senior&mdash;Mr. Gribble&mdash;who agreed that Cross had been fooled, not so
  much by his daughter as by his own conscience. Such a fury of suspicion and
  fear indicated a murky past when it was based on the certainty of enemy
  action.</p>

  <p>"That's his own affair," was the cynical official opinion. "Find out if
  his cheque is good."</p>

  <p>Another case had broken, so Foam worked late. Just as he was about to
  leave, he rang up Cross' hotel, merely for confirmation.</p>

  <p>"Is that the bureau?" he asked. "Can you tell me whether Miss Evelyn Cross
  is in?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied the clerk. "She went out this afternoon and she's not come
  back yet."</p>

  <p>Foam had lived that moment before... For an instant, he felt a sense of
  frustration and loss, as though he were staring again at a stretch of empty
  grass and whistling to a dog which was already far in the distance.</p>

  <p>He shook off the impression. Opening his notebook, he reread the
  high-pressure jottings he had made in No. 15 on the characters in the
  case.</p>

  <p>"Raphael Cross. Volcanic. Too good looking. Unfatherly, dark horse."</p>

  <p>"Major Pomeroy lean, long faced, well dressed. Old school tie, decent
  instincts. God save the King."</p>

  <p>"Madame Goya. White hair, dirty face. Fishy business. Wouldn't play cards
  with her."</p>

  <p>"Miss Power. Blonde, solid, tweedy hard voice. Been to right school."</p>

  <p>"Viola Green. Brunette. Too thin. Wears trousers. Anti-property bias.
  Stimulating."</p>

  <p>It seemed to him a pitiably poor collection of drivel. Such a pallid crop
  of potted personalities was not worth, pencil or paper.</p>

  <p>Yet there&mdash;under his eyes&mdash;were two separate clues which, later,
  were to help him towards a solution of the mystery.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOAM was fortunate in the possession of a pleasant home
  background. His parents lived in a large house in Highgate, which&mdash;in
  spite of family prosperity&mdash;resisted change and clung to its shabby
  old-fashioned comfort. The furniture and carpets had grown to be such old
  friends that renovation was out of the question. Usually, pets had to be
  ejected from the best chairs when they left their fur behind them in token of
  ownership.</p>

  <p>In spite of these shortcomings, the atmosphere was genial and the standard
  of living lavish. In winter, huge fires leaped up the wide chimneys and often
  set them afire; while Foam Senior was as discriminating over his cellar as
  his wife was generous in her housekeeping.</p>

  <p>The father was an officially retired doctor who retained a few favoured
  patients for the sake of occupation. He took a keen interest in his son's
  work, regarding the agency's sordid cases as a substitute for lurid fiction.
  Alan pandered to his weakness, for he knew that he could trust in his
  professional reputation for keeping secrets.</p>

  <p>That night, after he had reported his day's work, the doctor looked at him
  severely over his glasses.</p>

  <p>"Are you satisfied with the findings?" he asked. "If it were my case I
  should want a post-mortem... To take one point, how do you account for the
  complication of the discarded shoes?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" asked Foam. "There is no more definite proof that they
  belong to the Cross girl than to the typist. My own guess isn't
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"Then mark my words, my boy, there's another guess coming to you."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Foam, who was excluded from official confidences, overheard the last
  sentence.</p>

  <p>"Alan doesn't guess," she contradicted. "He deduces&mdash;in the same way
  that you diagnose."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish," chuckled the doctor, "I may ask my patients questions and
  observe their symptoms, but I have to guess what double-crossing is going on
  inside them. We all guess. Even you have to guess what time to put
  dinner."</p>

  <p>He winked at Alan, inviting him to share his amusement over his wife's
  wrath. Long experience of meals all around the clock had made her expert in
  dealing with the eternal conspiracy of a doctor's household against the cook.
  For the rest, she was a kindly, capable woman, who sat on boards and knew as
  much about drains as a plumber.</p>

  <p>"I organize," she cried indignantly.</p>

  <p>The subject of meals reminded Alan of a girl who had claimed immunity to
  sickness from a basic cause. He wondered whether she were hungry. It was true
  that she had been unemployed for a very short time; but he could imagine her
  spurning her final wage envelope as a grand gesture of compensation for the
  damaged gown.</p>

  <p>"How does a girl make out when she is sacked?" he asked his mother.</p>

  <p>"She goes to her exchange and claims insurance while she is unemployed,"
  explained Mrs, Foam.</p>

  <p>"But this girl's not organized. She's a fathead and too film crazy to keep
  a decent job."</p>

  <p>"Can she act?"</p>

  <p>"She thinks she's rotten, but off the stage she puts on a very good
  show."</p>

  <p>"Then I should ask her out to dinner as often as possible."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Foam's eyes gleamed with pleasure behind her glasses, although she
  preserved her poker face. This was the first time Alan had expressed interest
  in a girl.</p>

  <p>The following morning, directly he reached the office, Foam had a call put
  through to Cross' hotel. At first he did not recognize the voice which
  replied when he asked for his client. It was no longer roughened by emotion,
  but confident and even jaunty.</p>

  <p>"I suppose your daughter is back?" he asked with stressed heartiness.</p>

  <p>"No," replied the voice casually. "But I heard from her this morning."</p>

  <p>Although it was not the news he had predicted. Foam drew a deep breath of
  relief.</p>

  <p>"Good," he said. "I was sure you would hear. Where was the letter
  posted?"</p>

  <p>"Oxford," replied Cross. "It was just a picture post card of some college.
  The time stamped on it is ten-thirty p.m., last night."</p>

  <p>"Does it clear up the mystery?"</p>

  <p>"Practically. Hold on a minute and I'll read it to you."</p>

  <p>After a short wait, Cross' voice boomed down the wire.</p>

  <p>"I've found it. It says, 'Sorry to walk out on you, but I had a date for a
  week-end in the country. I'm still a hick and my friend is swell. And did I
  fool you! All your fault for butting in. Back on Monday.'"</p>

  <p>"Is it her handwriting?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"I'd say it was."</p>

  <p>"Did she take your car?"</p>

  <p>"No. She says she's with a friend... Well, this takes care of everything.
  Send in your bill. I want to get clear of the whole affair."</p>

  <p>"Thanks." Foam spoke absently, for he was still chewing an undigested
  chunk of the post card. "What does she mean when she says it was your fault
  that she had to fool you?"</p>

  <p>"I think I know," chuckled Cross. "When she goes out, she always comes in
  the car with me and I drop her somewhere. She told me to put her down at
  Pomerania House, but really she was going to meet this friend of hers in the
  Square. I threw a spanner in the works when I said I'd come in with her and
  see Major Pomeroy. Her appointment with the Madame was only fake... Anyway,
  that's my guess."</p>

  <p>"Sounds plausible," agreed Foam. He was about to ring off when Cross spoke
  to him again.</p>

  <p>"Will you be seeing little Greeny soon?" he asked.</p>

  <p>As he listened to the familiar title, Foam's ears began to burn. He felt
  the impotent anger of an outclassed rival as he remembered his last vivid
  impression of Raphael Cross&mdash;flamboyant and forceful&mdash;his blonde
  hair gleaming under the electric light. In the space of a few minutes he had
  cloven an entrance into Viola's life, compelling her confidence.</p>

  <p>"I shall be seeing her tonight," he said quickly.</p>

  <p>"Good," commented Cross. "Will you tell her I may be able to pull off a
  good job for her? Something in her line... That girl would never stand behind
  a counter or tap a machine. She warns a bit of the spice of life. I should
  know something about girls, with one of my own."</p>

  <p>"What is the nature of the job?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"Companion to William Stirling's daughter. I met them in the Queen Mary,
  coming across."'</p>

  <p>"'You mean Stirling, the millionaire?"</p>

  <p>"Millionaire, my foot. The chap's a multi-millionaire who gave his wife
  diamonds to the value of a quarter of a million, British currency, just as
  you and I give our wives a diamond bracelet."</p>

  <p>Foam was beginning to realize that Cross' use of the plural was typical of
  an extravagant standard. Apparently the man had to exaggerate values as well
  as emotions.</p>

  <p>"How can you recommend Miss Green?" he asked. "You know nothing about
  her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mrs. Stirling will take up her social references. But she will rely
  on me to give her the personal slant. I'm a judge of character. That girl has
  guts. I was going over the edge when she blacked my eye."</p>

  <p>"She only flicked your face," corrected Foam.</p>

  <p>"Same thing. She saved me... I shall be seeing Mrs, Stirling this
  afternoon. Tell Greeny to ring her up this evening and mention my name. Mrs.
  Stirling won't go after her. She'd better clinch it while the going's good.
  Tomorrow there'll be a queue of applicants after the job, a mile long."</p>

  <p>"I'll try to impress her with the importance," promised Foam, who was
  beginning to discount the face value of Cross' statements. In order to prove
  to himself that he was not jealous of such a comedian, he added casually,
  "Why don't you go and see her yourself?"</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. When Cross broke it, he had ceased to bellow
  like a stag in the mating season.</p>

  <p>"I can't bring myself to enter that house again," he said in a husky
  voice. "It will stir up the mud in my brain. That's something I must
  forget."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Foam.</p>

  <p>"Then it's more than I do. I can't make out if that bunch is on the level.
  The major seemed a gentleman. When Greeny went back upstairs, he told me she
  often stings him for her rent, but he doesn't like to turn her out. The fact
  is, his sort shouldn't be in business. Too soft... Now just take down Mrs.
  Stirling's number and see to it that Greeny rings her."</p>

  <p>When Foam rang off, he gave the bookkeeper instructions to send in the
  bill of Messrs. Girdlestone &amp; Gribble. Since the case was officially
  ended, he tried to forget it; but at the back of his mind was a vague unrest,
  probably a symptom of a grumbling curiosity.</p>

  <p>He wanted to see the elusive Evelyn Cross in the flesh and hear the exact
  details of how she had managed to slip away from Pomerania House. Further, he
  wanted to appease his vague distrust of Raphael Cross, which persisted in
  spite of the fact that Viola's new patron had entrusted him with a welcome
  commission.</p>

  <p>He switched on to a new case where his client&mdash;a retired
  schoolmistress&mdash;was being blackmailed through the indiscretion of a
  talking parrot; and he worked at it with savage energy, mainly because the
  blood-sucker was a youth with blonde curling hair.</p>

  <p>It was fairly late in the evening when he was free to visit Pomerania
  House, directly he entered the hall, he smelt the acrid odour of distemper.
  There was further evidence that the house decorator was in action, in
  lightish smudged footsteps on the red rubber flooring of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Have they started work on No. 16 already?" he asked Pearce.</p>

  <p>"Started and finished," replied the porter. "They made a rush job of it
  because Madame carried on so about being turned out of her room. The builder
  had to put on all his men. It was only papering. It's the painting as takes
  the time. Do you want to see the major?"</p>

  <p>"No. Miss Green."</p>

  <p>"She's in. Go right up."</p>

  <p>On his way upstairs, Foam passed a man who carried rolls of paper, and
  when he reached the landing, the builder was just coming out of No. 16. He
  recognized the detective and stopped to chat.</p>

  <p>"We're well up on time," he said, with a satisfied glance at his watch.
  "The men have made a nice job of it. Like to see it before it is covered up
  with fixtures?"</p>

  <p>Foam's first glance around No. 16 told him that expense had not been
  spared, although the effect was too ornate for his taste. The white walls
  were divided by gilded mouldings into panels which were decorated with golden
  <i>fleur-de-lys</i>, while the paper shimmered in the light as though it were
  brocade.</p>

  <p>"The old girl chose the best paper in the book," confided the builder.
  "The major tipped her that it would have to last her lease. The gentleman who
  was here yesterday will have to pay stiff for his nerves. I'd have tried to
  reason with him, but the major was in command. Can't think what had bitten
  him. He certainly wasn't lit."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's hope that this paper will be allowed to stick on," commented
  Foam.</p>

  <p>"It ought to last a lifetime at the price," agreed the builder.</p>

  <p>When Foam tapped at the door of No. 15, an angry voice shouted to him to
  come in. He surprised Viola in the act of kicking a stool around the room.
  She was not dressed for football, for she wore her tightest suit and a
  ridiculous little bun of a hat perched at a perilous slant.</p>

  <p>When she recognized her visitor, her glare changed to a beam of
  welcome.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you. I thought it was the major. I'm furious with him, I'm bubbling
  like a camel."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"I can't stand seeing people being imposed on, especially when they're out
  of luck. Those blue-pencil skunks are taking advantage of poor Rafe's trouble
  to bleed him. Goya's had her room done up regardless. The major egged her on.
  I never want to speak to him again. I'd leave tonight, only I'm owing rent...
  What are you grinning at?"</p>

  <p>"Cross' idea that the major is too delicate for business,"</p>

  <p>"The poor pathetic lamb. He'll find out. Why, the major fights to the last
  ditch if a tenant wants a new washer on a tap... Oh, has Evelyn come
  back?"</p>

  <p>"She's coming. I've got a message from Cross."</p>

  <p>As he delivered it, Foam watched the changes of expression which swept
  over Viola's vivid face. Her first excited interest deepened into hope and
  then dulled into incredulity. When he had finished speaking, she gave a
  skeptical laugh.</p>

  <p>"He's overdone it again. A millionaire? Nothing less? It sounds phoney to
  me. D'you think it's white slave traffic? They've not wanted me before.
  Suppose I'm not white enough... Pity. Goodness knows I could do with a
  job."</p>

  <p>She flopped bonelessly down on a chair, kicked off a high-heeled shoe and
  massaged her instep tenderly.</p>

  <p>"I've been the round of the west-end dress shops today," she told him. "No
  luck."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go home?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"Because I want to live. You don't know what it is like at home. Four
  thick meals a day&mdash;and trudging muddy lanes to deliver the Parish
  Magazine. I'd sooner go hungry and not know just what's round the corner.
  It's far better to be able to feel."</p>

  <p>"If I were Cross, I'd say I had heard all that a million times. Won't your
  father make you a small allowance?"</p>

  <p>"No he says there's a good home waiting for me. It's a case of
  mutiny."</p>

  <p>"Well, what about a spot of dinner? We can discuss Cross' offer better
  over food."</p>

  <p>They had their meal at an old-fashioned restaurant, where the food made up
  for the lack of display. The tables were set in alcoves, the lights had dark
  red shades, and there was no orchestra. Sitting together in the warmth and
  privacy of the most secluded nook, Foam told Viola about the message from
  Evelyn Cross.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see her," she said. "She's only a kind of wraith to me."</p>

  <p>"You are bound to see her if you get the Stirling job," Foam told her. "I
  gather the two families were friendly on the voyage."</p>

  <p>"Then you think I ought to ring the number?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? There is a millionaire called 'William Stirling.' I'll make
  private inquiries about the family for you. I won't let you go to any bogus
  job."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll phone directly I get back. It may give me a laugh. What is life
  without its comic strip?"</p>

  <p>Foam accompanied Viola back to Pomerania House on the pretext of hearing
  the result of the telephone call. As they entered the hall, Foam noticed that
  Pearce was not on duty while the major was acting as his deputy. Trained to
  observe, he got the impression that they were not entirely welcome, although
  the major's manner was suave when he came to meet them.</p>

  <p>"Would you like an honest-sweat-of-your-brow job, Foam, for a change?" he
  asked, ignoring Viola's scowl. "I can use any full-sized man. My tenant,
  Madame Goya, has just put me on the spot. She insists on going back to her
  room first thing tomorrow morning, even if we have to work all night. The
  builder says he's through and I've had to get in a couple of men to put the
  fixtures back."</p>

  <p>Taking no notice of the major's humorous effort, Viola held out a couple
  of coppers.</p>

  <p>"My twopence," she said icily. "I want to telephone."</p>

  <p>The major watched her as she shut herself in the booth; and the marble
  statue of the bathing nymph also stared at her through the glass, as though
  in envy of her suit.</p>

  <p>"Miss Green's a sport," remarked the major. "She won't complain if there's
  a spot of knocking. Miss Power's different and she works late&mdash;worse
  luck. Hello, here's the new mirror."</p>

  <p>In the absence of the porter, he went forward himself to meet the man.</p>

  <p>Because he knew that Cross would have to pay for it, Foam looked at the
  new fixture with a certain interest. It seemed a poor exchange for the
  original antique, for both frame and glass were modern and ornate. In
  compensation, however, it was exceptionally massive. Its weight completely
  bowed down the man who carried it upon his back, although he appeared to be
  strongly built and muscular.</p>

  <p>The bill was evidently mounting up for Raphael Cross. Viola commented on
  the fact when she came out of the telephone booth.</p>

  <p>"It was only the glass that was broken," she said. "Why didn't they use
  the old frame? It had that lovely mellow look and must have been worth pots.
  I wonder if the major sold it. Bet you there's been dirty work at the
  crossroads."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it's a case of a fool must pay for his folly," Foam told her
  as he went upstairs to smoke a last cigarette.</p>

  <p>He stayed a little time to listen to her account of her telephone
  interview. Although she had only spoken to Mrs. Stirling's
  secretary&mdash;who had granted non-committal permission to call the
  following morning&mdash;she had built a pyramid of future plans on the
  invitation.</p>

  <p>"Gosh, imagine a country parson's daughter living with millionaires," she
  cried. "But I hate rich girls. I've come up against them when I was doing
  crowd work in the studio. They expected all the breaks and they got them,
  just because they didn't need the pay envelope... I used to fight them like
  hell&mdash;tread on their toes and jog their elbows when they were blacking
  their lashes. Merely overtures to the battle... Good night, and bless you for
  bringing that message."</p>

  <p>After he had closed her door, Foam lingered for a minute on the landing,
  as though unconsciously absorbing the atmosphere of the old house. It was
  dimly lit and almost absolutely quiet. The hum of commerce and high finance
  had died down and there were no convivial sounds of social life.</p>

  <p>The work had not yet been begun on No. 16, for Foam could see into it
  through the half-open door. The men had evidently gone to bring more
  fixtures, for the room was bare except for the book shelves and the mirror
  which were propped against the wall.</p>

  <p>Acting on impulse, he stepped inside and gripped the frame of the mirror
  to test its weight. He expected that it would need extra effort to move it,
  so he exerted his full strength.</p>

  <p>To his astonishment, he lifted it with almost ridiculous ease. The frame
  was nothing but a gilded sham&mdash;light and hollow as a clay pipe stem.</p>

  <p>It seemed a glaring example of the major's cupidity and deceit. He had
  bought a gimcrack affair for which he meant to overcharge Cross grossly. To
  prevent Foam from detecting the fraud, he had gone to meet the man and had
  instructed him to walk with bent back, as though he were bearing a heavy
  load.</p>

  <p>In every particular, Foam had guessed right. It was only for lack of
  special knowledge that he missed the real explanation of the incident.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; MONEY TALKS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Viola called at the Stirling's hotel the following
  morning to keep her appointment, she was in a state of acute nervous tension
  which she tried vainly to overpower. To nerve herself for the ordeal, she
  wore her smartest suit and her most sophisticated veiled hat; but in spite of
  her pose of nonchalance her heart hammered as a diminutive page conducted her
  up in the lift and along carpeted corridors.</p>

  <p>She was left to wait in a sitting room of the suite usually reserved for
  visiting royalty. To her surprise, however, she was not neglected
  indefinitely. Mrs. Stirling evidently knew the value of time for, punctual to
  the minute of her appointment, the page appeared to escort her to the
  boudoir.</p>

  <p>At first, Viola thought that the small dark woman seated at the bureau
  must be the private secretary. She had foolishly expected Mrs. Stirling to be
  the traditional millionaire's wife of the screen&mdash;with a permanent wave,
  a large powdered face and ropes of pearls. To be true to type, she would
  retain evidence of her rapid growth to social eminence through the forcing
  bed of wealth, in specks of earth and manure&mdash;the grating accent and
  ill-bred mannerisms of her low origin.</p>

  <p>In direct contradiction to this mental picture, Mrs. Stirling created an
  impression of insignificance which was misleading, She suggested flat tones
  by her plain gown, her absence of jewellery and her low voice. Greeting the
  girl gravely, she began to chat to her, apparently to put her at her
  ease.</p>

  <p>It was not until then that Viola grew gradually conscious of the beauty of
  her tapering fingers&mdash;the delicate arch of her instep&mdash;the artistry
  of her dress which was as faintly grey-green as a weathered stone wall. Soon
  she realized that Mrs. Stirling had a strong personality and that her
  questions were not aimless, but contrived to make her reveal unconsciously
  her character. After she had been subjected to a painless, but searching
  elimination, the millionaire's wife began to explain the situation. She
  talked so frankly and simply that she put a slur of reality on an unnatural
  state of affairs.</p>

  <p>"It will seem strange to you," she said, "because kidnapping is not a
  British crime. You do not know what you are spared. With us, it is the
  constant dread of the octopus."</p>

  <p>Her involuntary shudder as she paused showed that she was deeply moved;
  but her voice was calm when next she spoke.</p>

  <p>"At home, Beatrice is always guarded by detectives. They are present at
  any important social function and also when she goes out; but when she visits
  her friends privately, the situation is more delicate. That is why she has a
  personal companion who never leaves her."</p>

  <p>"You really mean she is never alone?" exclaimed Viola thoughtlessly. "How
  revolting."</p>

  <p>"Beatrice would love to hear you say that." Mrs. Stirling smiled faintly.
  "Sometimes she likes to consider herself a victim of fate, although she would
  hate to change places with any other girl. Besides, she is so used to
  constant company that if she were left, she would be as terrified as a child
  in the dark... To understand the position, you must realize that she is not
  an ordinary girl, and ordinary standards cannot apply. She will control great
  wealth and must accept very heavy responsibility. If you were to take her out
  of her specialized atmosphere of wealth, she would suffer like a fish gasping
  in the air."</p>

  <p>"I understand," Viola told her. "I've never been rich&mdash;but I do
  possess imagination. But you said Beatrice had a companion already. Is she
  here in London?"</p>

  <p>"No, we had to leave her behind at home. It is a real loss, for Cassandra
  Thomas is a very marvellous person. Of course, she was coming over with us;
  but the night before sailing, she met with a traffic accident and broke three
  ribs. When we saw her in the hospital, she insisted that someone had tripped
  her up. The doctor said she was light-headed, but we thought it wiser to take
  no risks. There was no time to find a substitute in New York, so we brought
  over two detectives with us. You see, we had previously decided to come for a
  holiday with only Cass, as all our friends assured us we should be perfectly
  safe over here."</p>

  <p>Again Viola led back to the subject of the companion.</p>

  <p>"What would be the duties?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not so much duties as qualities," replied Mrs. Stirling. "You would go
  everywhere with Beatrice&mdash;shops, theatres, social functions. But whoever
  accepts the responsibility must be quick willed, courageous, loyal and never
  off guard. Above all, she must be tactful."</p>

  <p>Viola looked around her at the luxurious room, with its silver-birch
  furniture, thick pale grey carpet and curtains of ice-blue brocade. For a
  short time she could live in such opulent surroundings&mdash;drive in luxury
  cars and sit in a box at opera and theatre. Although the temptation to swim
  with the current was strong, she took a perverse pleasure at the prospect of
  turning down the offer. She told herself that there were too many girls out
  of work for her to feel sympathy with the Beatrice Stirlings of the
  world.</p>

  <p>"Anything more?" she asked sweetly.</p>

  <p>"You world have to keep her interested. In some ways she's a high-spirited
  child; but she is serious minded as well, and she has a craving for social
  experiment. That is Cass' special subject, so she is able to hold her. But
  even that has a certain danger. Sometimes she threatens to run away and live
  in a slum to find out for herself what it is to be poor."</p>

  <p>"She never would," said Viola scornfully. "She'd be just a rich girl
  playing at being poor."</p>

  <p>"Then I think you could teach her something, if that is your view."</p>

  <p>Viola shook her head as she sprang from her chair.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to have wasted your time," she said, "but I wouldn't dare to
  take it on. Your daughter is altogether too precious for me to accept her
  responsibility. If anything happened to her, I could never forgive myself. I
  should want to make a hole in the Thames."</p>

  <p>"That shows you have real loyalty," said Mrs. Stirling; "Please sit down
  again. I believe you are the person we are hoping to find."</p>

  <p>Looking back on the incident that night, when she was in her own room,
  Viola could neither understand nor explain why she allowed herself to be
  persuaded to remain. Quiet little Mrs. Stirling seemed to possess some
  hypnotic force through the power of her wealth, as though she had the
  Stirling millions behind her, exerting pressure upon Viola.</p>

  <p>All the same, she made an effort to escape from the suckers of the octopus
  which&mdash;according to Mrs. Stirling&mdash;continually menaced their
  household and which might grip her in its tentacles while ii was feeling its
  way towards its prey.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you understand the real position," she said. "How can Mr.
  Cross recommend me as companion for your daughter when he only met me two
  days ago for the first time? He knows nothing at all about me. Besides you
  only met him on the voyage."</p>

  <p>"Do you imagine I should take such risks?" asked Mrs. Stirling calmly. "It
  is true that Raphael Cross is only a casual acquaintance&mdash;but he
  appealed strongly to both my husband and myself. We are judges of character
  and can trust our intuition. He told us that he was very impressed by the way
  you behaved when he&mdash;he had that fright about his daughter. But I should
  not dream of considering you without immaculate personal references. I warn
  you these will be tested most thoroughly through personal interviews with
  your sponsors. Is it true that your grandfather is a bishop?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. But what did Rafe Cross tell you about me?"</p>

  <p>"He said he was worked up to the verge of a mental crash when you began to
  beat him up."</p>

  <p>"Trust him to overcall," declared Viola. "I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You did the right thing at the right moment," cut in Mrs. Stirling. "That
  is what matters to me. I don't care what it was. Of course, we shall only
  require you for two or three weeks; but I hope the terms will compensate for
  such a short engagement."</p>

  <p>When she mentioned the figure, Viola experienced the thrill of a miner who
  has found a gold nugget. From that moment, she was desperately anxious to be
  engaged. She calculated that she could save enough to keep her while she made
  another round of the studios, chasing her special will-o'-the-wisp.</p>

  <p>"I don't want a permanent post," she said quickly. "I'm hitch-hiking to
  the moon."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Stirling looked reflective.</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes," she said, "I remember R. C. told me you were a film actress.
  You must promise not to rush off if Hollywood wants you to make a
  picture."</p>

  <p>Viola duly promised that Beatrice should have first claim on her services,
  although she was guiltily aware of a dormant spasm of disloyalty when she
  considered the strength of such a temptation.</p>

  <p>"Pray it will never happen," she thought.</p>

  <p>"And now," went on Mrs. Stirling; stretching out her hand for a writing
  tablet, "will you give me at least six names and addresses, so that my
  secretary can take up your references without delay."</p>

  <p>Viola reeled off a list of clerical titles and then paused effectively,
  like a conjurer with a reserve hidden in his hat.</p>

  <p>"These are all on the moral side," she remarked. "Would you like some
  socialites?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear," protested Mrs. Stirling. "I do hope you won't teach my
  daughter American."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she'll teach me English," said Viola, colouring faintly at the
  thrust.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Stirling laughed as she pressed a bell button.</p>

  <p>"I feel hopeful," she declared, "I won't interview any more applicants at
  present. Suppose you wait and see Beatrice? She's out shopping with Mack.
  He's one of the detectives we have over here. He's been with us so long that
  she regards him as a sort of radio uncle. The other guard&mdash;Don&mdash;is
  as amateur who came for the vacation. He's a college boy and a young giant.
  His father is an overseer in one of our factories. My husband is very
  insistent on the personal element between employer and employee, and Don
  worships Beatrice. She's a sort of fairy princess to him... Now what would
  you like to drink?"</p>

  <p>In support of her character as perfect companion, Viola's choice was
  non-alcoholic. Presently, over coffee and cigarettes, Mrs. Stirling began to
  gossip as she asked Viola for details of the Pomerania House incident.</p>

  <p>"It seems strange to you," she said at the end of the girl's
  ultra-dramatic recital. "But it's poignant to me. If Beatrice seemed to
  disappear like that when we were in some store, I should be frantic... My
  only criticism is that R. C, did not take it seriously enough. He ran a risk
  in not sending at once for the police."</p>

  <p>"What's his daughter like?" asked Viola curiously "Pretty?"</p>

  <p>"She certainly appealed to the men on board," replied Mrs. Stirling after
  a pause. "We saw nothing of her. She refused all my boring invitations to
  cabin parties. Of course, she and Beatrice had nothing in common... But her
  father was the most popular man on the ship. We were bridge partners nearly
  all the time coming across. He's a marvellous player."</p>

  <p>She broke off as the door was flung open and a girl burst into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Here is Beatrice," she announced with fond pride.</p>

  <p>With a sudden revival of her antipathy to Miss Dives, Viola looked at her
  critically. She decided instantly that Beatrice had neither beauty nor
  glamour. She was tall and strongly built, with a round face which only
  escaped the reproach of "pudding" by the perfection of her complexion and the
  intelligence of her expression. Her hair was dark, thick and so determinedly
  straight that it was merely slightly shaped.</p>

  <p>As she stood there, she was not only a faultless type of glowing health
  and youth, but she actually managed to impart some suggestion of royalty. At
  the time, Viola attributed this to her dress. On that morning of fog and
  mud-slimed pavement, her flared white coat with its wide collar and cuffs of
  fox, her white fur cap and the huge bunch of lilies-of-the-valley she had
  pinned to her muff made her appear too exotic and costly to be a
  commoner.</p>

  <p>It was a whim of her father's that she should not wear colours until she
  was twenty-one. Unaware of the reason for this extravagant costume, Viola
  gave her best imitation of a society girl in response to Mrs. Stirling's
  introduction. Too shy to be her usual simple self, Beatrice tried to imitate
  her poise.</p>

  <p>"Going to join the jolly old chain gang?" she asked. "Definitely morbid
  idea, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Stirling smiled as she caught Viola's eye. "You'll soon be
  'tu-toi'-ing each other," she prophesied. "By the way, Beatrice, Miss Green
  acts for the pictures."</p>

  <p>"Oh, do you?" cried Beatrice, forgetting her pose, "Do you really? How
  enchanting! Have you contracts and stand-ins and things?"</p>

  <p>"I've things," Viola assured her. "Have you been shopping?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I've had the time of my life exploring Selfridge's&mdash;entirely
  alone. It was marvellous. No cameras. No one knew me. I felt as free as a
  bird. I gave poor old elephant Mack the slip."</p>

  <p>Viola noticed the panic which flickered into Mrs. Stirling's eyes, but her
  face and voice remained serene.</p>

  <p>"Did Mack come back with you?" she asked her daughter.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I picked him up again outside, by the car."</p>

  <p>"Just send him to me, will you? You can say 'Good-bye' to Miss Green
  now."</p>

  <p>Viola hoped to slip away before she was forced to witness a painful scene;
  but the detective came into the boudoir almost as Beatrice went out. He was a
  burly Scot, with high cheek bones and a thatch of sandy hair.</p>

  <p>"What happened, Mack?" asked Mrs. Stirling. "Two store detectives trailed
  her all the time," replied Mack. "I tipped them off to give the lassie a wee
  treat."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Stirling smiled and then held out her hand to Viola in dismissal.</p>

  <p>"If I come, I'll see your daughter changes her adjectives twice a week,"
  the girl promised.</p>

  <p>Directly she was outside the hotel, she hurried to the nearest telephone
  call box and rang up Foam's number. In her state of triumphant excitement,
  she felt she must share the news of her brilliant prospects. It was a
  disappointment when a clerk at the office of Girdlestone and Gribble told her
  that Alan had gone to the north on business.</p>

  <p>By the time she reached No. 15, she was sober and subdued. As she looked
  around her, in spite of its shabby bareness, it represented an oasis of
  safety. Doubts of the wisdom of accepting the responsibility of the Stirling
  post began to depress her. The Selfridge incident seemed to point to two
  facts; firstly, that in spite of her mother's belief, Beatrice resented
  constant companionship and, secondly, a certainty that she would try to
  repeat the escapade.</p>

  <p>"If she were kidnapped," she thought, "I might be held as an accessory
  after the fact. Things can look black against innocent people."</p>

  <p>Within the course of the next few days, events moved too quickly for her
  to resist them. Her friends and relatives rallied to the cause of her
  references with such enthusiasm that she found herself officially engaged and
  installed at the hotel as a member of the Stirling household. When she rang
  up Foam on his return to London, she was in a position to give him the latest
  news of Evelyn Cross.</p>

  <p>"She's not come back. Raphael Cross came here last night to tell us so.
  We've misjudged him terribly. Imagine it. His hair has turned white from the
  shock."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; POSTE RESTANTE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE following morning, Foam received a telephone message
  from Raphael Cross, asking him to call at once at his hotel.</p>

  <p>It was a large modern building with a number of service flats in addition
  to the usual bedrooms. The most expensive were at the top of the building,
  where a fine view of London could be obtained from the covered veranda. In
  one of these apartments, Cross had made his temporary home.</p>

  <p>Foam knew the hotel intimately because it had been the scene of his first
  sleuthing adventure to get material for divorce. At the time, he had disliked
  the sordid business intensely; but since those early days, he had acquired
  the accessory protective rind. Yet, apparently, his first impression
  persisted, for as he went up in the lift, he was conscious of a heaviness of
  spirit which was almost like a foreboding of evil.</p>

  <p>A chambermaid opened the outer door and showed him to the sitting room.
  Cross was using it as an office, for he was seated before a bureau littered
  with papers while he telephoned. As Foam entered, he was jotting down figures
  on a pad, but at the sight of his visitor, he finished his business abruptly
  and rang off.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Foam," he said. "Glad you've lost no time."</p>

  <p>Although Viola's message had prepared him, Foam was startled by the change
  in Raphael Cross. A week of strain had altered him so completely that it was
  impossible to connect him with the blonde and compelling stranger. He was
  wearing horn-rimmed glasses, through which his ice-blue eyes looked merely
  keen and business-like. His white hair added years to his age, while his
  powerful shoulders were heavily humped and lines struck down from nostril to
  lip, like the rays of the setting sun.</p>

  <p>As he looked at him, Foam realized that he had no longer any cause for
  jealousy. This grief-blasted parent could hold no possible challenge to
  youth. With a violent swing-over of his sympathies, he was shocked by the
  force of an emotion evident in so drastic a physical change.</p>

  <p>"Have you been ill?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You mean this?" said Cross, touching his hair. "It practically turned in
  a night. I had been lying awake as usual&mdash;thinking&mdash;and in the
  morning when I looked in the glass, I could hardly believe my eyes. I'd heard
  of such a thing happening, but I never believed in it. The joke's on me."</p>

  <p>He laughed mirthlessly before he changed the subject.</p>

  <p>"When you went to Pomerania House to give Greeny my message," he said,
  "did you hear about the redecoration of Madame Goya's flat?"</p>

  <p>"I saw it," remarked Foam significantly.</p>

  <p>"Then you know all about it... Well, I got the account for it&mdash;and I
  raised hell. The builder's a decent chap. I didn't squawk about his charges
  for the demolition. It was the ruddy rest... I could have bought a new mirror
  for one-third of the price and the bill for doing-over the room was nothing
  less than a hold-up... It's not the money I mind, but I won't be exploited,
  do you get me?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. What have you done about it?"</p>

  <p>"Mailed him my cheque and told him to sue me for the difference. I got a
  receipt in full, by return, with a gentle wail that I was incapable of
  understanding 'a gentleman's agreement.' That's your officer and gentleman...
  But you're not here to talk of that."</p>

  <p>Cross removed his glasses to rub his eyeballs.</p>

  <p>"My daughter has not come back. Foam," he said. "I've not had another line
  from her. I'm beginning to think that post card was a fake to throw me off
  the scent. Anyone could imitate her writing."</p>

  <p>"Officially speaking, I was paid off the job," Foam reminded him. "Have
  you done anything about it?"</p>

  <p>"No. You were so sure it was a normal escapade. But I suppose eight days'
  absence constitutes an official disappearance?"</p>

  <p>Ignoring the thrust, Foam asked a question.</p>

  <p>"Have you had any demand for ransom?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Cross.</p>

  <p>"Good. The lapse of time is against kidnapping. As a rule, you are not
  left long in the dark about the money end. But, of course, it is impossible
  for me to form an opinion, when I know nothing of the real facts... All the
  same, I think you've given her enough rope. It may be either accident or loss
  of memory. You should consult Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>With a throwback to his former restlessness, Cross got up from his chair
  and began to prowl around the room.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to let the police in on my affairs," he confessed. "That
  doesn't sound too good&mdash;but I have my reasons. I want you to find her
  privately."</p>

  <p>Apart from the question of future fees for the firm, Foam welcomed the
  request. He was not only annoyed by any unfinished work, but the case of the
  alleged disappearance of Evelyn Cross seemed linked up with Viola.</p>

  <p>"I'll be glad to do my utmost," he promised. "But it's only fair to warn
  you that our agency can't be as effective as the Yard. They have a
  specialized organization for dealing with missing persons."</p>

  <p>"How do they work?"</p>

  <p>"They'd keep a tab on every blonde who figures in accidents, police-court
  incidents, inquests and cases of losses of memory. The airports, seaports,
  railway stations and coach stations would all be notified. And they'd ensure
  wide publicity through the press, the B.B.C., posters and so on."</p>

  <p>"Just what I was getting at." Cross struck the bureau. "I'd sooner cut off
  my right hand than have her photograph published."</p>

  <p>"But we shall want one to send to our agents," Foam warned him. "I promise
  you it shall not be reproduced in the press&mdash;and I'll guarantee
  secrecy."</p>

  <p>"No. Besides I haven't got one."</p>

  <p>"There's her passport photograph."</p>

  <p>"She's got that. She always carries her passport in her bag."</p>

  <p>Although Foam did not believe him, he reminded himself that his client's
  obstinacy originated in his instinct to protect his daughter.</p>

  <p>"If we are going to find her, we shall want your cooperation," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"I know that," said Cross. "I'm not going to hold out on you. Smoke?"</p>

  <p>He gave Foam a small cigar and lit one himself.</p>

  <p>"This is the low-down," he declared. "I'm British&mdash;but I've spent
  most of my life in Australia, Canada and the U.S. I've been comparatively
  poor until recently. Then I got a mining concession which promised to make me
  a millionaire. I wasn't able to wait for it to mature so I sold out. Directly
  after, the ore petered out. I give you my word there was nothing
  crooked&mdash;just a hunch&mdash;but I got a shoal of threatening letters.
  They figured the mine was salted&mdash;and I figured it was a good time to
  take a trip to Europe."</p>

  <p>Foam made no comment on the confidence which was&mdash;more or
  less&mdash;what he had expected to hear. It did not matter to his client
  whether he believed him or not. The important point was to work on the case
  without blinkers.</p>

  <p>"It boils down to this," he remarked. "You don't want any publicity, lest
  you should put any of these disillusioned people on your track?"</p>

  <p>Cross nodded vigorously before he added, "You see, if one of these suckers
  got Evelyn, he'd be out for revenge more than ransom. That is why I can't
  rule out kidnapping."</p>

  <p>"In that case, she must have been seized after she left Pomerania House.
  You know she could not have been kidnapped inside the premises right under
  your eye. Why didn't your chauffeur notice her when she came out?"</p>

  <p>"Because he was driving round most of the time. When we came there before,
  the policeman told him off for parking too long in the Square."</p>

  <p>"She left her hat in the car. Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, her fur coat. She was carrying her bag."</p>

  <p>"I see... Will you describe her?"</p>

  <p>"She's about nineteen. Say five feet seven inches in her heels. I don't
  know her weight, but she's slim. Blonde hair. She wears it in a long bob and
  rolled up in curls in front. Blue eyes. Round face. A goodish bit made-up.
  She's got to cover a small red patch near her left eye."</p>

  <p>"That birthmark is a bit of luck for you," said Foam bluntly. "It will
  save dragging you all over the country to identify casualties. Was she
  wearing distinctive clothes?"</p>

  <p>"No, the usual smart west-end rig. Black suit, very short skirt, tan
  stockings, string of pearls and a white camellia."</p>

  <p>As he jotted down the particulars, Foam cursed modern standardization. He
  felt he would have had a better chance had the missing girl been black haired
  and green eyed, with a thin, vivid face.</p>

  <p>"Had she any love affair?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," replied Cross. "She's always had a bunch hanging round
  her. I'm too used to them to take special notice."</p>

  <p>"Do you know how she spent her time over here?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'm out all day on business. She comes with me in the car and I
  usually drop her somewhere. She plays round on her own&mdash;makes her own
  plans and tells me what show we're going to at night."</p>

  <p>"Does she pick up strangers?"</p>

  <p>Foam expected an explosion to follow his question but, to his relief,
  Cross accepted it as a matter of course.</p>

  <p>"Sure she does," he said. "She gets that from me. I always talk to
  everyone. It's all right at home, but it seems it's all wrong here. Mrs.
  Stirling blames me for letting Evelyn off the chain. But I'd sooner let her
  take a chance in the open than put her in a cage like that poor Stirling kid.
  It's degrading to her and it's dangerous as well. Every machine breaks down
  in time. She's got a good brain, but her judgment and intuition must be so
  much pulp. What could she do if she found herself in a spot, with no one
  round? I call it criminal to take away anyone's liberty."</p>

  <p>The outburst made Foam realize that his client was a man of natural strong
  passions in general, rather than a distracted parent, in particular. His eyes
  blazed and he shouted as though he were personally concerned about any menace
  to Beatrice Stirling.</p>

  <p>"I still think this is a girl's freak," said Foam. "You would, be
  surprised at the number of voluntary disappearances which are investigated by
  the Yard. Young people don't confide in their parents."</p>

  <p>"I don't want Evelyn's confidence," said Cross. "But I can't understand
  why she should want to walk out on me."</p>

  <p>As he glanced around him, Foam had a glimmer of understanding. The
  apartment was nothing but an amalgamation of expensive material&mdash;plate
  glass, chromium, carpet and upholstery. There was no personal touch&mdash;no
  attraction to keep a girl at home and no welcome when she returned. While he
  made allowance for the fact that it was a hired flat, he remembered the
  seaside apartments of his boyhood on which his mother left her stamp after an
  hour's tenancy.</p>

  <p>"She'll soon walk in," he prophesied. "We'll spare no efforts, but I must
  point out we've practically nothing to go on. Now you have doubts of the
  handwriting on the post card, we can't be sure whether your daughter went to
  Oxford. Assuming she did, we don't know whether she travelled by train, car
  or plane. We don't know whether she was alone or whether she had a companion.
  We don't know whether the companion was male or female. But, of course, we
  shall make inquiries at all the hotels in Oxford as to whether any blonde
  girl slept or ate there."</p>

  <p>"Let me hear from you every day, news or no news," said Cross. "I'm too
  impatient to sit and knit... have a drink before you go."</p>

  <p>Over a whisky-and-soda, he switched from the subject of Evelyn to Viola
  Green.</p>

  <p>"I hear little Greeny got the Stirling job."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were going to exert your influence in films." said
  Foam.</p>

  <p>"Not on your life. How the devil do I know she can act? That girl ought to
  be staked by someone, but not by me. I've no interest in girls. If I make up
  to a woman, it's only because want to get in with her husband."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. Never mix friendship with finance. While we are on the subject,
  has anyone any interest in your daughter's death? I
  mean&mdash;insurance?"</p>

  <p>Cross looked fierce at the question, but he answered quietly.</p>

  <p>"No one. I carry a goodish bit of insurance, myself, but I've not insured
  Evelyn for a cent. Besides, you have to produce your corpse before you can
  collect."</p>

  <p>When he returned home that evening, Foam told his father about the
  case.</p>

  <p>"You were right about the 'guess'," he said. "I haven't one fact to work
  from."</p>

  <p>"What about the shoes?" asked the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Just another complication. But we can neglect no chance. We shall have to
  make inquiries at every boot shop in Oxford, as well as the towns on the way,
  to find out if anyone remembers a blonde who bought a pair of shoes... In my
  opinion they did not belong to her at all. There's no earthly reason why she
  should have removed them and left them behind."</p>

  <p>He would have been more perplexed had he known of a certain parcel which
  was lying in a Sunderland post office. The postmark was London, W.C.2, and it
  was addressed to a mythical inhabitant who was to call for it.</p>

  <p>Apparently the mysterious Evelyn had shed more of her belongings on the
  day she disappeared. For inside the wrappings was the identical black suit
  which the porter had noticed when he watched a blonde girl ascend the stairs
  at Pomerania House.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; A LADY CALLED "NELL"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WITHIN the course of a few days, Viola had adapted herself
  to her new surroundings and taken the measure of the Stirling family. She was
  allotted a suite which was close to their apartment and which appeared a type
  of super-luxury to her after the deficiencies of No. 15, Pomerania House.
  Whenever she turned on the softly glowing concealed lighting, or tubbed in
  the green glass bathroom, she felt the resilience of a seahorse riding the
  crested surge.</p>

  <p>On the debit side, there were pitfalls and disadvantages, particularly
  when Beatrice was testing her new companion with the merciless severity of
  youth. She was not only a natural athlete herself but had been coached in
  every game by experts, while Viola's skill was below the average. When they
  played golf, however, she managed to stay the course in the bitterest wind;
  and although she did not actually swim stroke for stroke with Beatrice, she
  remained in the water for the same length of time.</p>

  <p>At first, Beatrice was inclined to be critical and contrast her with the
  inimitable Cassie. The American companion was older, besides being
  ultra-intelligent and steady as a rock. She could discuss economics and
  social conditions, while Viola&mdash;according to Beatrice's
  standard&mdash;was not educated. She only read thrillers and saw British and
  American pictures in preference to continental films.</p>

  <p>Soon, however, she began to recognize an exciting quality in Viola which
  stimulated her to emulation, even while it baffled her to define it. She
  seemed possessed of a lightness of heart and spirits which was independent of
  circumstances and free from the control of others. It aroused not only her
  admiration but also a secret envy.</p>

  <p>"What do you get out of life, Greeny?' she asked.</p>

  <p>"Moments," replied Viola.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean exactly?"</p>

  <p>"I can't pin it down 'exactly.' Darling, you've the sort of mind that
  would crucify a butterfly. That's a compliment, of course. I have no brains,
  myself."</p>

  <p>"But what special sort of moment?" persisted Beatrice.</p>

  <p>Because Viola had been trained in elocution, but denied the chance to
  exercise her accomplishment, she loved the sound of her voice.</p>

  <p>"A moment of flutter and dazzle," she replied. "Like foam in your eyes
  when you swim in the sea. There&mdash;and gone. Big things let you down. You
  expect too much of them, or you are too nervous and excited to realize them.
  It's only afterwards that you can enjoy them. I don't think anyone can be
  happy unless they can grasp the moment."</p>

  <p>"And what happens then?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. Nothing at all... It's just being alive&mdash;and knowing
  it."</p>

  <p>In her turn, Viola found Beatrice a curious mixture. Besides reading
  widely, she had travelled and remembered the places she saw. In some respects
  she was an intelligent and gracious adult with a genuine sympathy for
  poverty; in others, she was undeveloped as a child. Unfortunately, she had
  inherited some of her father's astuteness and delighted to display her
  sharpness at the expense of duller wits.</p>

  <p>On the whole, however, she helped to redeem the race of rich girls in
  Viola's eyes. The situation was often delicate, especially as Viola had to be
  a shadow in the background whenever the heiress entertained young men; but if
  one of these dared to resent her presence, Beatrice snapped at him as
  fiercely as a crocodile with multiple toothache.</p>

  <p>Viola saw little of the millionaire. He was a small, lean, grey man,
  devoted to his women, but otherwise so negligible that she was comfortably
  unaware of him as a power in the financial world. Her private name for him
  was "Billy goat," and she conceived the altogether false idea that he was
  controlled by his own wealth. In her imagination, she saw him as a puppet
  dragged through the market at the heels of his unruly millions, amid a chaos
  of stampeding bulls and bears. She soon lost her awe of Mrs. Stirling also,
  whom she had credited solely with devotion to ideals. The great little lady
  was a genuine philanthropist and was both simple and kind. She was entirely
  free from snobbery, which was partly due to the fad that the family felt
  itself set too high above social values to recognize them.</p>

  <p>When it came down to bed rock, the real passion of her life was bridge.
  Although in consideration to others, she insisted on low stakes, she always
  wanted to win and was a bad loser. It was chiefly because of her devotion to
  the game that Raphael Cross was such a frequent visitor at the hotel.</p>

  <p>In spite of the absence of news about his daughter, he was always
  excellent company. He had a fund of anecdotes about his
  experiences&mdash;most of which bore the stamp of a fertile imagination; but
  he was also a good listener, even if he could not resist the temptation to
  cap a story.</p>

  <p>It was only when he was off his guard that his friends could detect the
  signs of strain in a sudden sag of his facial muscles and a blank stare, as
  though he were searching for someone who was not there.</p>

  <p>"Whenever he's dummy, he's miles away," Mrs. Stirling confided to Viola.
  "And have you noticed the way he watches Beatrice?"</p>

  <p>"I have." agreed Viola, who could always do justice to emotions. "There's
  wistful hunger in his eyes. Tragic."</p>

  <p>Apart from her natural sympathy for him, he had given her further cause
  for gratitude. The first time they met in the hotel lounge, he drew her apart
  and spoke in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Are you keeping on your apartment?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to," she replied. "It's L.S.D. I rang up the major to ask if he
  would reduce the rent while I was away, but his telephone went out of action
  suddenly... I believe he trains telephones instead of seals."</p>

  <p>"Leave it to me. I'll fix it for you."</p>

  <p>Later when they were at dinner, he asked her a question.</p>

  <p>"Who's paying the rent of your flat, Greeny, to keep it for you?"</p>

  <p>"I am." said the millionaire. "Thank you for bringing it to my notice,
  Cross."</p>

  <p>Viola divided her smile of gratitude between the men, for she did not want
  the trouble of moving from Pomeranian House.</p>

  <p>No one liked to ask Cross for news of Evelyn, since he avoided the subject
  himself. Once however, Viola overheard a low-toned question from William
  Stirling.</p>

  <p>"Any demand note yet, Cross?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank Heaven," replied Cross. "It's not the worst yet. That's about
  all that keeps me going."</p>

  <p>Then he raised his voice. "What's this I hear about a Baby Austin,
  Beatrice? Is it serious this time?"</p>

  <p>"Mighty serious for him." Stirling replied for his daughter. "He'll be
  shot as my final hint."</p>

  <p>Viola saw the pucker of Beatrice's brow and gave the girl's hand an
  impulsive squeeze. Although she knew that young Austin was far below
  Beatrice's standard in every way, she also guessed at a perverse passion
  which the heiress concealed for the young rip.</p>

  <p>"Then I mustn't ask him to my lunch tomorrow," went on Cross.</p>

  <p>Although the Stirlings preferred to entertain him at their hotel, he was
  their host sometimes when they went out at night. This was the first occasion
  that he had succeeded in collecting them for lunch and Viola was included in
  the party.</p>

  <p>She could not force any enthusiasm for the invitation, for she was
  beginning to want the stimulus of real companionship. Here, she had either to
  provide entertainment for Beatrice or to act as audience to Cross, while a
  wide gulf divided her from Mr. and Mrs. Stirling. Her own pang of longing at
  the thought of Foam had inspired her gush of sympathy towards Beatrice.</p>

  <p>She introduced his name hopefully into the conversation while she asked
  Cross a question.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Alan Foam lately?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "He rings me every day, of course."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to meet him again. He bought me a dinner when I was hungry."</p>

  <p>"Greeny," cried Beatrice in horror. "You can't mean that."</p>

  <p>"Can't I? Then look at my figure... don't you wish you were poor,
  too?"</p>

  <p>"Who is this Alan Foam?" asked Mrs. Stirling.</p>

  <p>"He's the young chap who's trying to find Evelyn," explained Cross. "As a
  matter of fact, I'd like another opinion on him. You know how much I respect
  your judgment. I'm an unconventional bloke&mdash;so may I ask him to our
  lunch?"</p>

  <p>"Do," said Mrs. Stirling graciously. "I will give you my impression of him
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>Foam was not impressed by any condescension on the part of his client when
  he received the invitation. He had seen too many rich men writhing on the
  gridiron to be a respecter of wealth. It was only in the hope of meeting
  Viola again that he promised to be present.</p>

  <p>It was a fine morning when he walked along the Embankment, with a cold
  blue winter sky and a windy river. As he climbed the hill up to the Strand he
  felt in holiday mood, and this was increased by the sight of Viola at the
  entrance to the Savoy Hotel.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd never come," she told him. "I've been waiting to get you
  alone. Confidentially, it's lonely to be rich. And now, we belong to the same
  profession. I'm a detective, too."</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about the job," urged Foam.</p>

  <p>"Not now. Later. Here's R. C."</p>

  <p>Bearing down upon them like a torpedo, Cross grabbed Foam and took him
  over to the Stirling family. While he was drinking sherry, he had not the
  least idea that Mrs. Stirling was studying his reaction to her remarks. In
  his turn, he summed her up as a nice, quiet little woman, without any
  side.</p>

  <p>When he was placed between the girls at lunch, he turned first to Beatrice
  in order to do his duty and get it over. Just as he was trying vainly to
  remember the name of Robert Taylor's new picture, she saved the situation by
  discussing politics. He soon discovered that she knew more about the subject
  than himself and that he could not satisfy her with platitudes when she
  demanded the basis of his statements.</p>

  <p>It was a relief when Raphael Cross suddenly decided to assert his
  personality. Swooping down on his guests, he controlled the conversation and
  kept it spinning around himself. As their host, he was the central figure and
  he made them revolve around his axis. He was at the top of his form and gave
  an excellent imitation of a carefree man as he fired off his best cracks and
  led the laughter.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stopped dead in the middle of a sentence, arrested by the
  sound of his name uttered in a high-pitched voice.</p>

  <p>"Well, I declare. If it isn't Raff Cross."</p>

  <p>His guests all turned and looked in the same direction. A big, raw-boned
  woman&mdash;middle-aged and grizzled&mdash;was advancing towards their table.
  She was dressed like the average smart American tourist. Her suit was well
  cut&mdash;her hat was fashionable and worn at the correct angle on well-waved
  hair. Her veil was crisply new&mdash;her shoes and bag matched her colour
  scheme. Her sophistication, however, was superimposed on a primitive
  structure, for her skin was tanned and her eyes puckered from the sun and
  wind of the prairie.</p>

  <p>Cross' face shone with welcome. Springing from his chair, he threw his
  arms around her wide shoulders and kissed her as impulsively as a boy.</p>

  <p>"Nell," he shouted&mdash;"Nell Gaynor. Not a day older. You haven't
  changed a bit."</p>

  <p>"Nor you," beamed the woman. "My word, it's good to see you again."</p>

  <p>"He's a masterpiece;" whispered Viola. "That's life. You'd call it
  overacting on the boards."</p>

  <p>With a guilty memory of ducking from his own maiden aunt, Foam watched the
  reunion. There was no doubt of the genuine warmth of Cross' greeting. He
  seemed to have forgotten that he was entertaining a multi-millionaire as he
  asked an eager question:</p>

  <p>"How did you come, Nell? Fly?"</p>

  <p>"No, ship. The same class all through. I've come on a tour of Europe.
  We've a dandy schedule. France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavia
  and then home. I've only three days to do London."</p>

  <p>"With me. I'm showing you the sights."</p>

  <p>"I know, Raff Cross, drinking dives and strip-tease acts. No thanks, I'll
  stick to my schedule... And now I'd like to meet your friends."</p>

  <p>Recalled to the presence of his guests, Cross introduced her.</p>

  <p>"This is Miss Nell Gaynor&mdash;one of my oldest friends and the greatest
  lady in the U.S.A. We used to fish and hike together when we were kids."</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe him," declared Nell, beaming at Mrs. Stirling. "We are
  friends, but we weren't playmates. He's a good ten years older than
  me&mdash;and I'm no chicken. He's the same old liar in spite of his British
  clothes. They look all wrong to me."</p>

  <p>Cross shouted with laughter.</p>

  <p>"It's great to hear Nell on the warpath again," he said. "You always get
  the truth from Nell."</p>

  <p>"Where are you staying?" asked Mrs. Stirling.</p>

  <p>"At the English Speaking Union," replied Miss Gaynor.</p>

  <p>"How interesting! A former secretary of mine is staying there at present.
  Her name is Miss Hereford. I'm hoping to see her soon. You must get in touch
  with her, for I am sure you will like her and she could probably be helpful
  to you. She knows the best ways of going to places. I will ring her up and
  tell her that anything she can do for you will be a personal favour to
  me."</p>

  <p>"Thanks for the introduction. I'll look her up for certain. That reminds
  me. I've all the latest news about your folks, Raff."</p>

  <p>As Nell spoke, the glow left Cross' face as suddenly as though a shutter
  had been slammed down over a fire.</p>

  <p>"Not here." he said quickly. "One minute, Nell. I've something to tell
  you."</p>

  <p>They watched him as he thrust his arm within hers and walked with her a
  short distance from the table. As he whispered to her, her pleasant face grew
  grave and she nodded several times, apparently in assent to a request. Then
  he raised his voice again.</p>

  <p>"Won't you join us, Nell?" he invited.</p>

  <p>"Can't," she replied. "I'm only here to pick up an Australian who's been
  lunching here. We're going to a show together, and she is coming back to the
  English Speaking Union afterwards for tea with me."</p>

  <p>"Then I'll see you out."</p>

  <p>When Cross returned to his table a few minutes later, he apologized to his
  guests.</p>

  <p>"I was arranging to see Nell again," he explained. "That's a splendid
  woman."</p>

  <p>By that time, Foam had given up hope of any private talk with Viola. She
  was now definitely part of the Stirling outfit, and he had to stand by and
  see her drive off with them at the end of the luncheon.</p>

  <p>He was about to go when Cross spoke to him:</p>

  <p>"I'm worried, Foam. I should have made Nell stay. But my throwing a party
  and her meeting a friend mucked things up. I've a deal to put through
  besides, this afternoon. All the same, I've a hunch I've slipped up... When
  she was talking to me, there were strangers sitting all around, listening.
  There was quite enough to link her with me."</p>

  <p>"Does she know that your daughter has disappeared?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. I was scared she'd blurt out a question about Evelyn and I
  couldn't bring myself to explain in cold blood, before other people. When I
  was whispering to her, I warned her there was bad news and asked her not to
  mention my family or my affairs until she'd seen me again."</p>

  <p>"When will that be?"</p>

  <p>"This evening. She's coming to dinner. Now there's something I want you to
  do about that... hold on a minute. I've got to telephone first about some
  stock."</p>

  <p>"Right," said Foam. "I want to ring the office, too, to put off an
  appointment. I'm too late for it."</p>

  <p>Apparently everyone seemed to have the same idea, for he had to wait his
  turn to get a box. By chance the first to become vacant was adjacent to the
  one where Cross was conducting a heated conversation. Even through the glass,
  Foam could hear his raised voice although he could not distinguish the words.
  His client was evidently having trouble in making his meaning clear, for
  suddenly he shouted in anger:</p>

  <p>"I said 'Hereford,' you fool."</p>

  <p>As he got his own number, Foam vaguely wondered where he had heard the
  name before. It was not until he was back at the office that he remembered
  that Mrs. Stirling's late secretary was a Miss Hereford.</p>

  <p>At the time it was merely an unimportant coincidence. It was not until the
  end of a blood-stained case that he realized its importance.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10">X. &mdash; A LADY'S PRIVILEGE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Foam came out of the telephone box, Cross was waiting
  for him.</p>

  <p>"Glad to have had this chance of meeting you socially, Foam," he said.
  "Now it's over, I have a commission for you. It's outside your professional
  line, but you must charge up our time in the usual way."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"It's Nell&mdash;I told you she was coming to dinner with me tonight. I
  offered to send the car for her but she shouted me down. She wants to walk
  and see all she can of London. I'd feel easier if she had company on the way,
  because she's a stranger. I've an important deal pending and I have to stay
  close to the phone all day. So I'd be glad if you would call for her at the
  English Speaking Union, and bring her to my hotel."</p>

  <p>Foam was about to recommend the services of a district messenger when a
  glance at Cross' furrowed brow made him change his mind. He reminded himself
  that this man had been recently a generous host and that it was more worth
  while to preserve his peace of mind than his own petty professional
  pride.</p>

  <p>"What time?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"She said she couldn't start before six. Nell's always great on a
  schedule. Show up in good time even if she's got to keep you waiting. It's a
  lady's privilege, you know."</p>

  <p>Foam consulted his engagement book.</p>

  <p>"This side six," he commented. "Yes. I can make it."</p>

  <p>He returned to the office in an irritable mood and was sharp with the new
  typist when she assured him that the grammatical errors in his letters were
  due to his dictation. He was satiated and&mdash;at the same
  time&mdash;starved, since he had eaten a heavy lunch and scarcely exchanged a
  dozen sentences with Viola. At the time, it was enough to sit beside her, but
  now that it was too late, he cursed himself for a missed opportunity.</p>

  <p>It was a relief to leave the office and start for Nell's club. He felt
  that a good walk would calm his nerves, besides giving him a chance to learn
  something of Cross' early history. Although Nell had been warned not to speak
  of his private affairs, the woman was so blunt and simple that she would
  probably talk freely when she gossiped about old times.</p>

  <p>He reached the English Speaking Union at five minutes to six, only to be
  told that Miss Gaynor had left about ten minutes previously. With so much
  start, and with no knowledge of her route, he felt that any attempt to
  overtake her would be a hopeless proposition, so he returned to the office.
  His day's work had been shot to bits, but now that his chiefs and the staff
  had left, he pottered about for some time, picking up the threads of an
  interrupted case.</p>

  <p>Presently he felt justified in starting for home. When he got outside the
  building, however, he discovered that his mind was not at rest. Raphael Cross
  had been insistent that Miss Gaynor should have an escort. Although it was
  not his fault that he had missed her, he decided it would make a better
  impression if he assured himself of her safe arrival.</p>

  <p>He did not want to return to the office to telephone, and the only public
  call box he passed was occupied, so he resolved to go slightly out of his way
  and call at Cross' hotel. It had turned foggy again, and as he walked through
  the dim Mayfair streets he seemed to have wandered back to the timeless
  atmosphere of Berkeley Square. The air was laden with raw vapour, and the
  moist pavements were speckled with bone-dry patches which marked the spots
  where fallen plane leaves had lain. In the circle of light from each street
  lamp, they looked weirdly bleached and brittle like dead butterflies stamped
  into the stone.</p>

  <p>Spectral pedestrians bumped into him with material force. Buses rolled by
  with windows steamed by the breath of passengers. It was a relief to reach
  Cross' hotel and get out of the chill damp.</p>

  <p>The entrance hall, with its thick rose-pink carpet and its brilliant strip
  lighting, was a pleasant contrast to the outside fog; but in spite of the
  warmth and comfort he was again vaguely conscious that he disliked the place.
  This impression persisted while he mounted in the lift to the top floor and
  remained with him until he reached Cross' flat, so that he was reluctant to
  ring the bell.</p>

  <p>The door was opened instantly by Cross. His blue eyes were heavily ringed,
  as though the skin around the sockets had been artificially darkened&mdash;an
  effect which combined with his velvet smoking jacket to give him a theatrical
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"Where's Nell?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"I imagined she was here," replied Foam. "She left her club at a quarter
  to six, so I missed her. Sorry."</p>

  <p>Cross began to gnaw his lip.</p>

  <p>"Queer," he said. "It's not like Nell to let me down."</p>

  <p>"She's on the way," Foam reminded him. "Remember it's a lady's privilege
  to be late."</p>

  <p>"Yes that might be it. I'll ring up her club. Maybe she went back or
  something and then stayed talking. Nell would be chatty with a corpse...
  don't go, Foam. Just hang around until I'm through."</p>

  <p>Nodding casually, Foam picked up an evening paper which lay on a table. He
  wanted his own dinner and could not understand such anxiety about the safety
  of a mature woman. Expectant of good news, he barely looked up when Cross
  returned to the hall.</p>

  <p>"She's not there," he said, breathing heavily. "What can be keeping
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Lost her way," suggested Foam.</p>

  <p>"She speaks English. Besides, she could take a taxi."</p>

  <p>"Probably she got tired and dropped into a news theatre on the way."</p>

  <p>"That's more likely." Cross spoke more confidently. "Don't go, Foam."</p>

  <p>"But I've got to get some dinner."</p>

  <p>"You can eat here. I'll have a snack sent up for her when she comes. But
  if she doesn't come, I may want advice or help."</p>

  <p>They went down to the restaurant for a most uncomfortable meal. Cross
  drank heavily but ate practically nothing, while he rushed the waiters
  ruthlessly through the courses. Throughout the dinner, he talked exclusively
  of Nell Gaynor.</p>

  <p>"It was mighty queer to me to see her all dolled up," he said. "When she's
  at home on the farm she wears slops and an old broken hat. She does the work
  of two men and earns nothing but wrinkles and her keep."</p>

  <p>"Then how did she manage to come on such an expensive holiday?" asked Foam
  skeptically.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you... Ever since her teens, she's been saving up for a trip to
  Europe. After her work was done&mdash;and she worked early and
  late&mdash;she'd slave at any odd job she could persuade the neighbours to
  give her. She'd hike miles to pick berries and then boil them into jelly to
  sell. She'd raise seeds and sell them for a dime a packet. She'd nurse and
  cook and sew. No one could get born or laid out without Nell. It's taken
  years of her life to scrape the cents together... But she's made the grade.
  When I saw her come in, in her smart new clothes, I wanted to stand up and
  cheer."</p>

  <p>He added hastily, "You don't want cheese, do you? Then we'll go back to
  the flat. The coffee's filthy."</p>

  <p>Foam accepted his fate and allowed himself to be propelled towards the
  lift. When they reached the hall. Cross turned to him.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't spoil your dinner for you. Foam," he said, "but I won't hide
  it from you. I'm worried stiff about Nell. It's foggy and she is not used to
  traffic on the wrong side of the road. I counted three ambulances going by
  before we went down to the restaurant."</p>

  <p>"She's not triplets," Foam reminded him lightly. "Two of those were
  someone else&mdash;so why not the third?"</p>

  <p>"But I feel something's gone wrong. That call's never come through."</p>

  <p>"What call?"</p>

  <p>Cross started at the question. Then the sudden flicker of alarm in his
  eyes died out and he compressed his lips, as though his agitation had
  betrayed him to the verge of some indiscreet admission.</p>

  <p>"The call from the Overseas," he replied after a pause. "I'm having Nell
  paged there, in case she went back with her Australian friend. I'll give them
  another ring... have a drink, Foam. Help yourself."</p>

  <p>Foam wished he could break away, but he did not like to desert his client.
  He mixed himself a whisky and splash and turned on the radio, keeping the
  pitch muted. Although he was of tough fibre, he realized that his own nerves
  were on edge for he felt a qualm of apprehension when Cross returned from the
  telephone.</p>

  <p>"No news," he said thickly. "It's this waiting gets me down. But I'm sure
  something's happened to her. We must ring the hospitals and police
  stations."</p>

  <p>Foam noticed that his brow was thickly beaded with sweat. He seemed so
  shaken that the detective offered to make the necessary inquiries.</p>

  <p>"Try this district first," said Cross.</p>

  <p>As he waited to get his number, Foam glanced around him with unreasonable
  dislike. The room was not repulsive but merely sterile and conventional.
  Carpet, curtains and upholstery were all of faint shades of brown and fawn,
  with blurred stripes and blotches which blended into the main pattern like a
  tiger in the jungle. Modern art was presented in a pale green statuette of a
  woman which resembled a deformed and lopped tree trunk. The only flowers were
  glass orchids in a beaten-brass bowl.</p>

  <p>He could not understand his instinctive recoil because his imagination had
  been calloused by harsh facts later on&mdash;when he met a lady in the
  apartment, in circumstances of extreme horror&mdash;he remembered his
  shrinking and wondered if he had felt the first shiver in the air.</p>

  <p>Even then, a shock was on its way. Contrary to his expectation, his first
  inquiry yielded a grim result. Steeling his voice, he spoke to Cross:</p>

  <p>"Stand by for bad news."</p>

  <p>After asking more questions and noting the details, he rang off.</p>

  <p>"The local police station reports a middle-aged woman was knocked down by
  a car in the Square this evening, about six-thirty her passport was in her
  bag&mdash;I'm afraid there's no doubt it's your friend."</p>

  <p>"What hospital?" asked Cross.</p>

  <p>"Police mortuary."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;she's dead?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I'll go right over. You wait here."</p>

  <p>Foam was relieved that he had not to share the ordeal of identification.
  He mixed himself another drink and began to pace the room. Presently he
  realized that he kept lighting fresh cigarettes which only survived a few
  puffs. As he remembered that Cross had done the same while waiting for the
  result of the builders' demolition of Goya's flat, he had some glimmer of his
  client's state of suspense.</p>

  <p>"There's no mistake he's been put through it," he reflected.</p>

  <p>Presently he heard the outer door bang to as a sign of Cross' return. When
  he came into the room, he walked directly to the table&mdash;splashed brandy
  into a glass&mdash;and swallowed it in a gulp. Then he slumped down into a
  chair as though every muscle were nicked.</p>

  <p>"It's Nell," he said, covering his face with his hands.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, to Foam's surprise, tears trickled through his fingers while his
  shoulders shook with sobs.</p>

  <p>"I never thought I could feel like this." he said. "I'm hard&mdash;Nell's
  got me beat... It's her poor face&mdash;all bloody where the car ran over
  it."</p>

  <p>Foam tried to steady him with a practical question.</p>

  <p>"Were there witnesses of the accident?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Did the police reconstruct it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the marks were on the road. They couldn't miss it. The swine never
  stopped. It was murder. Foul and deliberate murder."</p>

  <p>Foam paid little attention to the charge. Cross had been drinking all the
  evening and was strung up to a pitch of hysteria when his vision was
  distorted.</p>

  <p>"Let yourself out, Foam," commanded his client. "Bring me the brandy. I'm
  drunk&mdash;but I've got to pass out. I've got to forget her face."</p>

  <p>Convinced that he could be of no further service, Foam was only too
  grateful to return to his Highgate home. He was unusually appreciative of its
  old-fashioned comfort as he entered the drawing room. There was a red caked
  fire, a dog snoring on the rug, and two sane and vigorous parents. Outside
  the window was a belt of laurels&mdash;inside were thick grass-green
  curtains, excluding every draught. Mrs. Foam, who liked a warm atmosphere,
  always referred to them guiltily as, her "crime against hygiene."</p>

  <p>When Alan told them the story of Nell's tragedy, she was chiefly concerned
  by the fact that her precious son had practically eaten no dinner.</p>

  <p>"God rest her soul," she said briskly. "What did you have for lunch,
  Alan?"</p>

  <p>After she had dragged from him the entire menu, she seemed to resent it as
  a challenge to her own housekeeping.</p>

  <p>"Nothing I couldn't give you, myself," she snorted. "Cook's in
  bed&mdash;praise be&mdash;so I can raid the larder and find you some real
  food."</p>

  <p>After she had gone, her husband displayed his usual interest in his son's
  case. His shrewd eyes were grey slits in his red face as he made a
  suggestion:</p>

  <p>"I appreciate the fact that you can only tell me snippets, Alan. At the
  risk of being youthful, it seems to me that the poor woman knew something
  which had to be suppressed,"</p>

  <p>"No, Doc," said Foam. "It was an accident. But there is one queer point.
  My client seemed to believe she was doomed because he didn't receive a
  telephone call."</p>

  <p>When Cross rang up his office the following morning for news of Evelyn,
  his voice sounded normal. It held the usual eager pitch which slurred down to
  dull acceptance when he heard there was nothing to report.</p>

  <p>Later in the week he called at Girdlestone &amp; Gribble's and asked to
  see Foam, His composure was absolute as he explained the reason.</p>

  <p>"I've been busy over this bad business of poor Nell's death," he said.
  "She's only got a married brother with no family he's a heel. Nell worked the
  farm. All the same, I had to ascertain his wishes about the body. And, of
  course, I had to attend the inquest. Lucky break for the police I was able to
  identify the body."</p>

  <p>"What's being done?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"I'm to have her cremated. That's why I'm here. I want to book you in for
  the funeral... Poor Nell always wanted a slap-up burial. She used to joke
  about it. 'None of your coffee-and-cake beanos for me. Bury me with
  sherry-and-ham.'... I don't want to be the only one there. I'll pay for your
  time and I'll bring your flowers. Nell loved lots of flowers at
  funerals."</p>

  <p>Foam conquered his first impulse to refuse.</p>

  <p>"I'll come," he promised, "but only as a matter of sentiment. Cut out the
  payment." He added in a casual voice, "What was the verdict of the
  inquest?"</p>

  <p>"Death from misadventure," replied Cross.</p>

  <p>"You accepted it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course. What the hell are you getting at?"</p>

  <p>As Foam remained pointedly silent, he laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"You mean I talked about murder when I was plastered. But things are best
  left as they are. I can't afford to stir up any mud as long as my girl is
  missing. Besides, what's the good? I can prove nothing. It would only give
  her brother useless pain."</p>

  <p>Foam scribbled on his pad as he mentioned a new possibility.</p>

  <p>"I know you cautioned Miss Gaynor not to gossip about our business," he
  remarked. "But she struck me as having a frank and expansive nature. Do you
  think she mentioned anything about your daughter or yourself to her
  Australian friend during the afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"She did not," replied Cross. "I had the same idea, so I called at the
  Overseas Club and asked the woman to repeat everything&mdash;however
  trivial&mdash;that Nell said about me. I was too cautious. If only she had
  talked before she died."</p>

  <p>When Foam promised to attend Nell's funeral, he had no idea of the length
  of the journey. He stifled base regret for wasted time as the motor hearse
  turned off at the Horns, Kennington, to proceed on the long trail up Brixton
  Hill, past blocks of new flats at Streatham, downhill and skirting the Common
  to Norbury.</p>

  <p>They were not the only mourners at the chapel. The Australian was there,
  out of sympathy for a fellow tourist who had been cheated out of her holiday.
  She was accompanied by an American lady&mdash;a complete stranger to
  Nell&mdash;who wanted to pay respect to a compatriot and also to witness an
  English ceremony.</p>

  <p>Foam felt unusually responsive to the pathos of the occasion. When the
  short dramatic service was over and the coffin sank from sight, he had a
  sudden clear vision of Nell's, beaming face.</p>

  <p>As he thought of their brief meeting at the Savoy Hotel, he was teased by
  a clouded memory which worried him like a hair against his cheek. Unlike the
  perfect witness at a murder trial, he could not remember distinctly
  everything which had been said; yet he was vaguely conscious of a
  discrepancy&mdash;insignificant in itself&mdash;which might acquire
  importance when placed in conjunction with another forgotten trifle.</p>

  <p>It was as though Nell were trying to tell him that she had spoken before
  she died, and that her words would be the last link in the solution of the
  mystery of Evelyn Cross.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; LEAKAGE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHILE Foam's agents chased elusive blondes across the map of
  the west country, the horror was limping on its way to Raphael Cross'
  flat...</p>

  <p>Apparently he had no instinctive warning of its approach. His recovery
  from the shock of Nell Gaynor's death appeared as complete as the stoicism
  with which he accepted his daughter's continued absence. But, although he
  seemed to be in excellent spirits, the intelligent Beatrice was not
  deceived.</p>

  <p>"He's black and bitter inside&mdash;and he makes the air black and bitter
  too," she confided to Viola. "I can feel it whenever he's near. Have you
  noticed that he laughs only with his teeth? I don't believe he ever
  forgets."</p>

  <p>"Then he's putting on a good show," approved Viola.</p>

  <p>As though to justify her compliment, Cross further vindicated his
  detachment by giving a small party in the flat which had no hostess. His
  hospitality was not entirely voluntary, for Mrs. Stirling expressed a wish to
  see his hotel.</p>

  <p>"I'm curious about people's backgrounds&mdash;when I like them," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Mine's a very simple affair after yours," Cross warned her. "Just rooms
  with service. I only wanted some quiet place where I could relax and where
  Evelyn could ask her friends for a drink."</p>

  <p>"But I'd like to see it."</p>

  <p>"I'll be honoured. Shall we say tomorrow evening?"</p>

  <p>Viola was rather annoyed to be included in the party. On similar social
  occasions&mdash;when Beatrice accompanied her parents&mdash;she was not
  supposed to require official protection, so that Viola, as well as the
  detectives, was off duty.</p>

  <p>When the Stirling party reached the hotel. Cross escorted them directly to
  the restaurant. He had chosen a meal with discrimination and supplemented the
  wines, while the manager had made himself responsible for the arrangements.
  At the end of the dinner, the millionaire and his wife insisted on his
  presentation, that he might receive their congratulations and the ladies
  might accept his sprays of orchids.</p>

  <p>Viola, who was left out of the floral decorations, looked on with a
  somewhat thin smile during the little ceremony; but the social atmosphere
  remained warm, and the Stirlings were in a gracious mood when they mounted to
  the top of the building for their inspection of Cross' flat.</p>

  <p>According to his custom, the millionaire made no comments, but he accepted
  his host's cigar as a sign of his approval. While he smoked it, he
  alternately watched his wife and daughter with a tight-lipped half smile.
  Mrs. Stirling was in a rarely expansive frame of mind when she insisted upon
  being charmed with everything. She might have been a bride, exploring her
  future home as she fluttered around, calling her daughter's attention to
  features which had no novelty and asking eager questions about the fixtures.
  "I'm enchanted," she declared. "It's perfect."</p>

  <p>Cross stopped in the act of pouring out coffee.</p>

  <p>"Not perfect," he said. "There's no hostess. I shouldn't be doing
  this."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you poor man. Let me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No. I'm keeping her place warm for her to carry on again."</p>

  <p>Then, to reward her enthusiasm, he answered her unspoken question and told
  her the only thing she wanted to know&mdash;the rental of the flat.</p>

  <p>She was indignantly impressed by the figure.</p>

  <p>"Only that? William, did you hear? Think of what we have to pay for
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"It's called 'The Royal Suite,'" her husband reminded her.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing in a name. It's atrocious how we are always exploited. I
  often wonder what we pay for?"</p>

  <p>"Indiscretion." Stirling chuckled as he added, "When a woman confides to
  the press that she had soaked her old man for a small fortune in diamonds
  alone, it stands to reason she's not shown the bargain basement."</p>

  <p>"Besides, my sweet," broke in Beatrice, "you'd hate it really. You'd miss
  all the extras on your bill. You like to think you are simple&mdash;but we
  all know that you're terribly complex."</p>

  <p>As Mrs. Stirling's delicate face began to acquire the pained expression
  which was her substitute for sulking, Cross saved the situation.</p>

  <p>"Simple or complex," he said, "women are all alike in one thing. They are
  superstitious... And so are most business men."</p>

  <p>"Are you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes... Sometimes I feel tempted to go to a clairvoyant about Evelyn. But
  the only one I have any confidence in is Goya. I could never go near her now,
  after the way I was stung over her room. Yet she seems to be psychic. A chap
  in the city told me she gave him a winner."</p>

  <p>Beatrice's eyes lit up with excitement. "I've simply got to consult her,"
  she declared. "Greeny, we'll make it tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"No," said Cross sharply. "Don't let her go to that joint, Stirling."</p>

  <p>"There's no need for her to go," remarked the millionaire with grim
  humour. "I'm psychic too. My spirit guide tells me I shall never have a
  son-in-law named 'Austin.'"</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Cross. "Beatrice must wear a coronet. Nothing short of the
  best is good enough for her."</p>

  <p>Beatrice laughed and tossed her head as though in rejection of homage
  which was her right. As usual, she wore white, and her frock of sprigged silk
  accentuated her youth. That night, as a privilege, she had been allowed to
  wear colour&mdash;a string of corals&mdash;which matched her lips. But
  although she was a charming picture, she lacked the beauty which alone could
  justify her parents' idolatrous admiration.</p>

  <p>As she watched the group, Viola felt suddenly impatient with the
  conditions of her new life and critical of her companions. Mrs, Stirling
  looked delicate and expensive as porcelain in peach brocade, while the men
  both appeared more distinctive in evening dress. They made her think of a
  young man who often wore the same suit all round the clock&mdash;a man with
  resolute eyes who called himself "rough and common."</p>

  <p>Foam belonged to the things which were real; the shifts of her
  flatlet&mdash;the scraping and subterfuge&mdash;the heart-breaking pursuit of
  the Gleam. At that moment, she felt both homesick and very lonely.</p>

  <p>She started at the sound of a loud double knock.</p>

  <p>"I expect that's my mail," remarked Cross. "I never get a chance to
  collect at the bureau. It's always brought up. These young rascals know I'm
  good for a tip."</p>

  <p>He went into the hall and opened the outer door.</p>

  <p>"Only one, sir," announced a boy's hopeful treble, "but it's 'urgent.'...
  Thank you, sir,"</p>

  <p>Cross returned, whistling an air from The Beggar's Opera. He was about to
  flick the letter down on the bureau when he glanced at it. Instantly his tune
  stopped in the middle of a bar.</p>

  <p>"The address is printed," he said.</p>

  <p>"Open it," commanded the millionaire sharply.</p>

  <p>"Yes... of course."</p>

  <p>As Cross made no attempt to rip the envelope, but stood staring at it like
  a man hypnotized by a snake, Mrs. Stirling took it from his limp fingers.
  Slitting it open, she read it aloud in a low voice...</p>

  <p>"You can have your daughter back for the sum of five thousand dollars in
  one-pound British treasury notes. Bring parcel to Victoria station yard
  Friday night at 11.30. Leave it in telephone booth marked with chalk cross.
  Clear off at once and do not look round. Remember you will be under
  observation. If you play fair, your daughter will return&mdash;same night.
  Don't inform police. If you do, it will be too bad for her."</p>

  <p>Cross showed no sign of emotion as he listened.</p>

  <p>"I've been expecting this," he said in a flat voice. "I knew they were
  holding her."</p>

  <p>Viola was ashamed of her excitement at the invasion of drama. The dead
  atmosphere of the steam-heated room had suddenly become quickened with
  seething emotions&mdash;fear, pity, suspicion, anger. She noticed that the
  millionaire's face had grown grey, while his wife appeared to have shrunk as
  they both gazed fearfully at Beatrice.</p>

  <p>"They are only thinking of their precious Beatrice," she thought. "She's
  safe enough with her bushel of hand-picked detectives. The other poor girl
  may be in terrible danger. But it's nothing to them."</p>

  <p>The millionaire broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"You know what you have to do, Cross," he said harshly. "You must ring up
  the police at once."</p>

  <p>"No," protested Cross. "I dare not risk it."</p>

  <p>"You must. It's tough, but you've got to face up to it. It's your only
  chance. If you don't call their bluff, these vermin have got you on the spot.
  To start with, their price is too low. That's phoney in itself. It means they
  will keep on raising it on you. Then again, you've no guarantee they'll stick
  to their part of the bargain."</p>

  <p>"It's easy for you to talk," Cross reminded him, "It's not your daughter.
  You wouldn't risk it, yourself."</p>

  <p>"I would."</p>

  <p>As Stirling protruded his lower lip stubbornly, Viola caught his wife's
  instinctive movement of protection as she stepped in front of her daughter.
  Although her small face remained composed, her eyes held both fear and
  defiance as she listened to her husband.</p>

  <p>"If it were Beatrice, I'd notify the police at once. Kidnapping is the
  vilest crime of cowards who work in the dark. But my policy is always to come
  out into the open and start a fight. Mark my words&mdash;these skunks will
  take your cash and keep your girl."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Viola wanted a cool professional opinion to clear the air of the
  conflicting currents of emotions. While she admitted that she was biased in
  favour of Alan Foam, it was also common sense for Cross to avail himself of
  paid service.</p>

  <p>"Your detective should have a chance to earn his money," she dared to
  suggest. "Couldn't he trace this person by the letter?"</p>

  <p>"Not a hope," said the millionaire. "The postmark is 'E.C.4.' That proves
  the letter was written elsewhere. The paper is on any standard block and
  there won't be incriminating fingerprints. Even the police could make nothing
  of it."</p>

  <p>"It's spelt correctly," commented Beatrice. "Perhaps this letter is a
  hoax."</p>

  <p>Stirling smiled with pride.</p>

  <p>"I believe Beatrice has got something there," he declared. "It could be an
  attempt to touch you by someone who's not got your girl. One of the
  complications of every kidnapping case is the horde of money-sucking
  scoundrels on the make."</p>

  <p>"Then you still don't think she is kidnapped?" asked Cross. "Not even
  after this letter?"</p>

  <p>"No. I think it got us rattled so that we forgot the facts. Your own
  detective sticks to it that it's a case of voluntary disappearance. But the
  chief point against it is the length of time which has elapsed before a
  demand for ransom. There's no sense in that."</p>

  <p>"Who knows of Evelyn's disappearance besides ourselves?" asked Mrs.
  Stirling.</p>

  <p>"Quite a bunch," replied Cross. "Of course, I've told them at the hotel
  she's away visiting. But there were plenty at Pomerania House that day. Major
  Pomeroy, the girl who was studying, Goya, a bunch of typists and Greeny."</p>

  <p>Viola felt an unpleasant sensation of spurious guilt as they all looked at
  her at the mention of her name. Although her conscience was clear, the
  millionaire's searching eyes made her realize not only her responsibility
  regarding his daughter but also the shrivelling effect of being under
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>"You can cut out the girls," declared Cross. "The major's only prune
  juice. He's incapable of a criminal act... Still, any one of them might have
  talked. It could have come round to some unprincipled person."</p>

  <p>"I am sure it is leakage," said Mrs. Stirling. "R.C., you really must ring
  up the police."</p>

  <p>"What can they do?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Leave it to them. They know the ropes. But these wretches who are trying
  to make capital out of someone's trouble deserve to be punished."</p>

  <p>"You're right. I believe the letter is a hoax. Ring up the Yard."</p>

  <p>Cross walked to the telephone. His resolution lasted until the end of the
  official interview. "If we are wrong," he said, "I have just killed my
  girl."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12">XII. &mdash; COURTESY OF THE POLICE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE following morning, Cross called at the office of
  Girdlestone &amp; Gribble to tell Foam about the anonymous letter. He
  appeared to be depressed and convinced that he had made a mistake as he
  explained the situation.</p>

  <p>"The Stirlings filibustered," he declared. "Father, mother and daughter
  talked and talked until I gave way against my own judgment. It's out of my
  hands now. The police are taking action tonight."</p>

  <p>If Foam considered that he had received shabby treatment, he showed no
  sign of personal feeling.</p>

  <p>"If the letter is genuine," he said, "it is a case of kidnapping, and I
  would prefer the police to deal with it. If it is phoney, then your daughter
  is still missing and I must continue on the job as long as I am retained...
  By the way, do the police know about your affairs?"</p>

  <p>"No. I told them my daughter walked out on me and that I put a dick on her
  trail. Like you, they think it is an escapade. Their idea is there's been
  some exaggerated gossip about the affair and some smart Aleck is trying to
  cash in on it."</p>

  <p>"Do you know what line they are taking tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. They've arranged an ambush and a dummy ransom," explained Cross.
  "Their note said I was to deliver it in person. But I told the police I was
  bound to see red and smash in someone's face. So one of their men of my
  height and build will act as stooge,"</p>

  <p>"I take it they will ring you at once to let you know exactly what
  breaks?"</p>

  <p>"Of course." Cross mopped his forehead as he added, "It's this waiting
  gets me down. That letter was a direct threat to Evelyn."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you need take it too seriously," said Foam. "According to
  you, this unknown enemy of yours is one of your dupes. That in itself proves
  he is not so sharp as yourself. Why should you credit him with extra cunning
  and resource? For one thing, he's short of cash, if you cleaned him out."</p>

  <p>As Foam expected, Cross' mercurial spirits bounded up at the reminder.</p>

  <p>"That makes sense," he remarked. "D'you know. Foam, you're the only decent
  chap I've struck in this business. Everyone else seems out to hurt... That's
  why I gave the police your office number and told them to ring me up here
  tonight. But if I've crashed the lights, I can cancel the order."</p>

  <p>"Why here?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"Because there's nowhere else. I don't want to inflict myself on the
  Stirlings and I don't want the message to go to my hotel. The night clerk
  will be bored, and when he hears it's from Scotland Yard, he'll listen in to
  my private affairs. I've had to leave a hotel before this because the
  management didn't want any connection with the police. They are sensitive on
  the subject. And I want to stay put."</p>

  <p>"I understand," Foam assured him. "Certainly you can come here to take the
  call. I'll make it right with my chiefs."</p>

  <p>"Thanks... But there's something else. I want you to be here, standing by.
  I might need advice or action. Of course, you'll be paid for your time."</p>

  <p>Foam was too used to night work to raise any objection, so he promised to
  return to the office at eleven o'clock. To his annoyance, however, he could
  not forget the appointment. Its memory persisted through the day's routine,
  as a vaguely unpleasant ordeal. He surprised his mother by arriving home at
  Highgate in time for dinner, but he paid for his punctuality by a restless
  evening, prowling from room to room.</p>

  <p>It was an actual relief when he wished his parents "Good night" and went
  from the warm comfort of the house to the outside chill and gloom. As he had
  time to spare, he walked the short distance from the tube station, so he was
  surprised to find Raphael Cross waiting for him outside the office.</p>

  <p>He wore a cape over evening dress and an opera hat tilted to one side of
  his head, while under his arm was tucked a bottle of whisky. As he stood
  there in the shadow of the doorway, he reminded Foam of some tipsy masher
  from the nineteenth century&mdash;an illusion fostered by the dark Hogarthian
  buildings and the gibbous moon which was just crawling above the roof
  line.</p>

  <p>He explained his festive attire&mdash;"Loaned the copper my hat and coat."
  Then he pointed to the whisky. "Got to fortify," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good idea," agreed Foam.</p>

  <p>He steered his client into Mr. Girdlestone's private room which, for no
  reason at all, was called the board room. It was a vast Victorian apartment,
  furnished with massive chairs arranged around a central table. The wallpaper
  was brown and covered with gilt ferns, while the new Axminster carpet
  combined crude colours&mdash;red and green&mdash;with an uneasy sprawling
  pattern.</p>

  <p>Over the marble mantelpiece was an oil painting of Girdlestone's father,
  as though to suggest the founder of the firm; but, as a matter of fact, the
  gentleman had been painted to celebrate freemasonic promotion. There was also
  an attractive framed portrait of Mrs. Gribble, who photographed well. At one
  time, there had been one of Mrs. Girdlestone also, but it had been mislaid by
  the cleaner. Fortunately, the men were too used to it to notice its loss, and
  both of them referred impartially to the survivor as "The Missus."</p>

  <p>Cross noticed it immediately. "Pretty woman," he remarked. "Edwardian.
  She's not like that now. Are those her own teeth?"</p>

  <p>"Hanged if I know," replied Foam.</p>

  <p>"Isn't she your missus?"</p>

  <p>"Good night, no. Old enough to be my mother."</p>

  <p>"Of course... Got any soda?"</p>

  <p>"No. We'll have to hitch up to the tap."</p>

  <p>Foam knew that Cross was talking in order to control his nerves. He
  invited him to take Mr. Girdlestone's deep leather chair while he hunted for
  a corkscrew and glasses.</p>

  <p>"Not long to go," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Cross looked at the clock and groaned.</p>

  <p>"An eternity. Foam, I am in hell. I'm doomed to spend my life waiting.
  Remember Nell? She never came. And all the time, she was lying out there in
  the road. And now this. Waiting."</p>

  <p>"You did the right thing to let in the police," Foam assured him.</p>

  <p>"If I've not, it's Evelyn takes the rap."</p>

  <p>The two men drank and smoked in silence broken only by the hoots of
  traffic. They watched the dock continuously and, from time to time, consulted
  their watches. It was plain that Cross was in a torment of suspense which
  presently affected the case-hardened Foam.</p>

  <p>His thoughts were concentrated on the drama which was being enacted at
  Victoria. He wondered if it was running according to schedule, or whether
  there were unexpected complications supplied by members of the public. The
  whisky he had drunk began to flaw his imagination; so that the station did
  not seem the familiar terminus where he had often stalked quarry. It was dark
  and filled with shadows, where watchers awaited the approach of the
  blackmailer. The telephone box marked with a cross acquired a sinister
  significance. Even at that moment, a stealthy form might be stealing
  inside.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the telephone bell began to ring with a shrill clamour. Foam
  leaped to answer it, but before he could reach it, Cross had snatched it up
  from the table. As he listened to the message, he stared before him with
  incredulous joy and wonder.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he mumbled. "I'll be right over."</p>

  <p>His hand was shaking as he rang off.</p>

  <p>"She's back," he said hoarsely. "I can't believe it. Eve's back."</p>

  <p>The news was so unexpected that Foam could not credit it.</p>

  <p>"How d'you know?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They've just rung up from the hotel. I left this number at the desk in
  case anything broke. I never dreamed of this. We must go over there at
  once."</p>

  <p>Foam was curious to see the girl of whom he had heard so much. Even then,
  it was difficult to believe that she was actually at the apartment where he
  would see her in the flesh. It was a triumph of duty over inclination when he
  reminded Cross of the expected message from the police.</p>

  <p>"That doesn't matter now," declared Cross. "Besides, I don't want the line
  blocked. I've got to ring Evelyn. I must hear her voice again."</p>

  <p>It was a natural wish, yet Foam felt impatient at the delay. After the
  call was put through to the hotel. Cross had to wait for the porter to
  connect him with his flat. Presently, however, a fatuous smile spread over
  his face.</p>

  <p>"That you, honey?" he shouted. "Where've you been?... Bad girl... You bet
  I'll hear all about it.. listen, I've got a young chap here who's been
  trailing you for me. Just say something to him."</p>

  <p>Foam took the receiver which was moist from his heavy breathing. The next
  second he heard the faint tinny notes of a light soprano voice.</p>

  <p>"Hallo. Are you the sleuth?"</p>

  <p>"I am," replied Foam. "You've been very elusive. I suppose I am speaking
  to Miss Cross?"</p>

  <p>"Evelyn to you. You've been looking for me in the wrong places. I'll let
  you in on a secret. The right place is here. Come over and check up...
  Bye-bye."</p>

  <p>She rang off with a tinkling laugh. Directly the wire was dead. Foam had
  the strange feeling that he had been talking to a ghost. In his impatience to
  meet her, he experienced the irritated frustration of a film patron when the
  heroine procrastinates on the verge of rescue. While they were wasting time,
  Evelyn might disappear again. It seemed as impossible to capture her as to
  pin down a flicker with the point of a knife.</p>

  <p>"Shall we start?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>Cross nodded, but stopped to refill his glass.</p>

  <p>"She's been away with a boy friend," he explained. "Well, that's youth.
  Suppose I shall have to put her over my knee... Come on."</p>

  <p>When they were outside the office, Foam looked around in vain for a taxi.
  Although the hotel was not far away, he felt it would take too long to walk,
  as Cross seemed inclined to stagger. His own legs were not entirely reliable,
  while the old buildings showed an ominous tendency to rock in the light of
  the misshapen moon.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be trapped in a nightmare where it was impossible to make
  progress. At the same time, he was plagued by a realization of urgency. His
  brain worked remorselessly to reassemble morbid possibilities. He reasoned
  that if Cross were really being followed by an enemy, that person would watch
  his hotel. Therefore, the girl's absence would be no secret to him. He would
  assume naturally that she was away on a visit&mdash;but he would be waiting
  for her to return.</p>

  <p>Up to this point, she had been under masculine protection. Here was the
  psychological moment when she was vulnerable to attack&mdash;after she had
  left her lover but had still to make contact with her father.</p>

  <p>It was a great relief when a taxi stopped to drop its fares a few yards
  away. He hailed it although the hotel was only the other side of Piccadilly.
  After he had given the address and climbed inside, Cross shouted a direction
  to the driver.</p>

  <p>"Stop at the first chemist."</p>

  <p>He explained the reason for the delay as, instead of merely crossing the
  lighted thoroughfare, they began to cruise slowly along in the wake of a
  string of traffic.</p>

  <p>"I'm tight. Foam. I can't meet Evelyn in this state."</p>

  <p>After they had stopped at a chemist's he appeared sober enough to display
  expert knowledge on the subject of a draught. Foam chafed at the delay,
  although it was justified by the result. Soon they were back in the taxi and
  turned from the rushing river of lights into the dark canal of a side street.
  As the floodlit front of the hotel came in sight, Cross gripped Foam's
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Evelyn's up there," he said. "Or did I dream it?"</p>

  <p>"We talked to her over the phone," Foam reminded him.</p>

  <p>They pushed their way through the revolving door and interviewed a sleepy
  porter in a mulberry uniform.</p>

  <p>"Did my daughter go up to the flat?" asked Cross.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," replied the man casually. "She took the key. She said she'd
  let you in."</p>

  <p>A drowsy page&mdash;who was still awake to the possibility of a
  tip&mdash;rushed to take them up in the lift. As they mounted, Foam
  remembered his repugnance when last he had made the ascent. The bleak and
  stereotyped room had been the scene of a vigil for a dead woman. It was a
  happy thought that even now it was transformed by the atmosphere of a
  light-hearted girl. Probably Evelyn had strewn her possessions around
  it&mdash;her hat on a chair, her lipstick on the table, her cigarette ends on
  the floor.</p>

  <p>He felt both excited and expectant as he followed Cross down the corridors
  to the flat lights were turned on in the hall and a glow streamed through the
  open door of the sitting room. With a jubilant "Cooee," Cross burst
  inside...</p>

  <p>Foam waited in the vestibule so as not to intrude on their meeting. Within
  the first few seconds, however, the silence told him that something was
  wrong. There was no squeal of delight from the girl&mdash;no eager rush of
  feet.</p>

  <p>Instead, he heard a dull thud as though someone had fallen to the ground.
  Rushing into the room, he stood in the doorway, while his heart seemed to
  turn over.</p>

  <p>At first, he could not credit what he saw. A blonde girl was seated in one
  of the big chairs. She wore a tight black suit, the skirt of which was
  wrinkled above her knees to display slim legs in tan silk stockings. All the
  marks of identification were present, including a string of pearls and a tiny
  red triangular scar. Her hair was attractively fair&mdash;her eyes round and
  blue.</p>

  <p>But they were dead and staring&mdash;her face was darkly
  cyanosed&mdash;and a string was knotted around her throat.</p>

  <p>At last Foam had met Evelyn Cross in the flesh&mdash;for only the flesh
  remained. Her hands were folded on her lap and supported a card which bore a
  roughly printed message:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">This Comes To You Through The Courtesy Of The Police.</p><br>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13">XIII. &mdash; STANDING BY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Stirlings did not hear of the tragedy until the next
  morning. Mrs. Stirling enjoyed the importance of announcing news, so Beatrice
  pandered to her weakness by never looking at the papers until they
  were&mdash;so to speak&mdash;formally declared open. As the embargo did not
  touch the financial press, the millionaire also kept to the tacit family
  agreement.</p>

  <p>It was a shock to them all when&mdash;after she had read out the headlines
  of national importance&mdash;Mrs. Stirling gave a faint scream.</p>

  <p>"Evelyn Cross has been murdered!"</p>

  <p>Although her sensitive nature abhorred horror, she conscientiously gave
  them the details of the crime in a low controlled voice. As she listened,
  Viola vibrated with the same terrible excitement that had possessed her when
  the ransom note arrived. Every nerve tingled as though a wire of high voltage
  had released its current.</p>

  <p>When she looked around her, she could hardly credit the fact that the
  other listeners were continuing breakfast. While she shuddered at the picture
  of a blonde girl&mdash;contorted in the agony of her struggles, with slim
  twisted legs and laddered stockings&mdash;Beatrice ate cereal and her father
  manipulated grapefruit.</p>

  <p>Again she accused them of lack of sympathy and felt hotly resentful; for
  she was unable to realize that the family was egocentric on the subject of
  kidnapping. It was the shadow which overhung their lives and held a poignant
  interest. Because of its menace, they were putting up a brave show to
  disprove its reality&mdash;the parents acting to reassure Beatrice, while
  she&mdash;for their sakes&mdash;also played her part in a debunking
  drama.</p>

  <p>"Look at us," they seemed to say. "Our detachment proves that we know we
  are immune."</p>

  <p>The truth was they were severely shaken by the tragedy. It was impossible
  to ignore the existence of the octopus when its tentacles had just closed
  upon a victim&mdash;useless to reason that Raphael Cross and his daughter
  attracted sensationalism and that Evelyn had received no protection.</p>

  <p>As though she suddenly remembered that Viola was an extra guard to her
  daughter, Mrs. Stirling looked at her with unconscious appeal.</p>

  <p>The girl missed the message, for she was enthralled by the account of how
  Evelyn Cross came home for the last time. Her vivid imagination reconstructed
  each detail until she almost felt that she had assumed the personality of the
  victim. She knew exactly how Evelyn had thrilled when&mdash;as the night
  porter at the hotel testified&mdash;she had called out a gay "Good night" to
  her unknown escort.</p>

  <p>The man had only heard a car drive on before she entered through the
  revolving door. Viola was sure that it was a triumphant entrance&mdash;brazen
  to the point of swagger. She had enjoyed an episode&mdash;so no regrets,
  thanks&mdash;and she was ready to receive the jolly old parental slipper.</p>

  <p>Viola came with her every inch of the way, longing, yet impotent to drag
  her back. She mounted with her in the lift, which as it rose, foot by foot,
  took her nearer to what awaited her inside the flat. She accompanied her down
  the length of carpeted passages&mdash;unlocked the front door&mdash;and then
  stepped inside the hall.</p>

  <p>Someone stood inside. Waiting for her...</p>

  <p>A black mist passed before Viola's eyes&mdash;a roaring in her ears
  deadened the sound of Mrs. Stirling's low, rapid tones. The next second she
  shook off her morbid obsession. With a welcome return to normality, she
  became aware of hand-painted china-marigolds on the breakfast table and a
  copper-red sun shining through the fog.</p>

  <p>With a fastidious shudder, Mrs. Stirling threw the paper aside.</p>

  <p>"It's too revolting&mdash;too terrible," she declared. "I can't read any
  more."</p>

  <p>Feeling convinced of unhealthy curiosity, Viola picked up the sheet to
  discover the horror which had conquered Mrs. Stirling's stoicism. It was
  there in a single line at the end of the account, stating the date of the
  inquest.</p>

  <p>No one ever laughed at Mrs. Stirling since, in spite of her sweet nature,
  she had an acute sense of personal dignity. To atone for a lack of humour,
  her recognition of any call to service was unfailing. Although the repugnance
  in her dark eyes showed how she shrank from an unpleasant duty, she spoke
  firmly to her husband.</p>

  <p>"Will, we must go to that poor man at once."</p>

  <p>The millionaire chewed his lip as he mumbled a protest.</p>

  <p>'I'm not sure we would be welcome. He may resent us."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, we did advise him to call in the police. This may be the
  unfortunate result."</p>

  <p>"Then I shall go alone."</p>

  <p>"No, no. Of course, I'll stand by the poor chap."</p>

  <p>As she was leaving the room, Mrs. Stirling turned back to speak to
  Viola.</p>

  <p>"We are all going to the Ritz for lunch with some very old friends from
  Boston. You will be free for that time. Miss Green, if you care to make any
  private arrangements."</p>

  <p>Unaware that Beatrice was watching her, Viola did not hide her relief. She
  felt thoroughly out of sympathy with the Stirlings that morning because they
  seemed to claim a right to preferential treatment over smaller incomes.
  Directly the millionaire and his wife had started for Raphael Cross' hotel,
  she rushed to her room and telephoned to Alan Foam.</p>

  <p>It was a disappointment when his secretary told her that he had not yet
  come to the office. Too impatient to leave a message, she rang on and hunted
  up his home address. She did not realize the extent of her daring until a
  discouraging feminine voice admitted grudgingly that she was connected with
  Highgate.</p>

  <p>"Can I speak to Mr. Alan Foam?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You can not," said the voice. "Are you the office again? What I told you
  before stands. My son is asleep and I am not going to wake him. He's been out
  all night on the firm's business."</p>

  <p>"It's not the office," Viola told her. "It's just&mdash;a friend. Will you
  ask him to ring me up?"</p>

  <p>"Ring whom?"</p>

  <p>"Greeny."</p>

  <p>When it was too late to recall it, she regretted that she had not said
  "Miss Green," instead of blurting out her playful nickname. As the ferocious
  voice was identified as Alan's mother, she almost expected to hear her bite
  the wire in baffled fury. She was the more surprised, therefore, when Mrs.
  Foam spoke to her in friendly tones.</p>

  <p>"I'll give him your message on condition you do something for me. Make him
  take you out to lunch&mdash;and see to it that he eats something. He is not
  as tough as he thinks. He's been standing by that poor man whose daughter's
  been murdered and he didn't come home until the small hours. The case is in
  the papers, so I'm not revealing secrets."'</p>

  <p>"I'll stuff him," promised Viola before she commented on what had
  interested her most in Mrs. Foam's explanation. "He's got too much
  imagination to be tough," she declared.</p>

  <p>"I'm surprised to hear you say so. You're the only one who's noticed it
  besides myself. You know, his heart is in the secret service, only he could
  never get the hang of German construction. Unless you hear to the contrary,
  the luncheon appointment will stand. We'll say one sharp, for he'll only bolt
  a cup of coffee for breakfast, as he is so late. What place shall I tell
  him?"</p>

  <p>When Viola mentioned the modest restaurant where they had previously dined
  together, Mrs. Foam rang off with a satisfied smile. 'No gold digger,' she
  reflected.</p>

  <p>Beatrice greeted Viola with a strained smile when she came into her
  sitting room. She knew that her companion would use her brief spell of
  liberty to resume her private life, which she only revealed in rare and
  exciting flashes. Although Viola told her nothing about her engagement, her
  face hinted that a mysterious entertainment was scheduled for the near
  future. "Lunching out?" she asked casually.</p>

  <p>"Out," replied Viola. "What's your show like?"</p>

  <p>"You mean the Boston friends? Oh, congenial. They'd probably bore
  you."</p>

  <p>Viola did not notice the resentful note in Beatrice's voice, as her own
  thoughts slipped back to the crime. "I can't get poor Evelyn out of my head,"
  she said. "I keep thinking about her. What was she like exactly?"</p>

  <p>"Ask someone else. There's a convention about speaking no ill of the
  dead."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be stuffy. I can always take the truth."</p>

  <p>"But this is brutal truth. Honestly, she was inferior in every way. Her
  voice was common, and she had no conversation and no ideas. Of course, it was
  not her fault that she was uneducated. She attracted a crowd of men, and her
  taste was anything but discriminating."</p>

  <p>Knowing that Beatrice's standard was exacting, Viola discounted much of
  the criticism. She told herself that Evelyn had been the average
  light-hearted, light-headed girl whom she had met while doing crowd work for
  the screen. If she had catholic tastes and would kiss a baker's boy as
  readily as a peer, then good luck to her. Probably the baker's boy had nicer
  lips.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad she had her fling," she said softly. "Everyone should live."</p>

  <p>"Everyone except a millionaire's daughter," amended Beatrice.</p>

  <p>In her anxiety not to be late for her appointment, Viola was dressed and
  waiting for the Stirlings' return, so that she could discharge her
  responsibility in regard to Beatrice. They did not come until she was growing
  impatient to start. Unable to rush away immediately, she asked for news of
  Raphael Cross.</p>

  <p>"He's a sight calmer than I am," said the millionaire, with a touch of
  resentment. "You'd think he didn't feel it."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't," explained his wife gently. "His nerves are frozen by shock
  later on, I'm afraid he will suffer all the more."</p>

  <p>In spite of her harassing mission, she had lost her shrivelled appearance
  and the light had returned to her eyes. When she began to talk eagerly, Viola
  believed she understood the secret of her relief.</p>

  <p>"The police are sure it wasn't a kidnapping crime," she said. "The
  appearance of the body rules out any idea that she had been kidnapped when
  she disappeared."</p>

  <p>"How?" asked Beatrice.</p>

  <p>Although Mrs. Stirling contracted her delicate brows in token of a
  distasteful subject, she did not shirk the explanation.</p>

  <p>"The body of a kidnapped person would bear signs of starvation, or
  ill-treatment, or personal neglect," she Sold her daughter. "Victims lose
  heart over their appearance and refuse to eat, even when they are fed.
  Besides they usually have no facilities, for taking care of themselves. But
  Evelyn was in perfect condition. She might have come straight from a toilet
  club. She had had a recent pedicure-enamelled hearts on her
  toenails&mdash;and she wore bridal lingerie."</p>

  <p>"According to Greeny, she'd been living," explained Beatrice.</p>

  <p>"That seems to be the police angle," agreed Mrs. Stirling. "They think she
  went off with a young man."</p>

  <p>Viola waited for no more news of the crime. Hailing a taxi, she soon
  reached the small restaurant where Foam was waiting for her. He looked worn,
  but his face lit up at the sight of her while her own eyes glowed with
  welcome.</p>

  <p>"This is a shabby dump after your present splendour," he remarked. "But
  you chose it."</p>

  <p>She looked around her appreciatively as she seated herself opposite to him
  in a mahogany pew and inhaled the warm sauce-laden atmosphere. It was exactly
  as she remembered it during moments of depression; the same coarse, white
  tablecloth, dingy French mustard, thick crimson and green glasses and floral
  decorations&mdash;artificial daffodils with maidenhair fern.</p>

  <p>"It's enchanting," she said, "all of it. You can count yourself in. You
  look so adorably rough. I'm sick of stuffed boiled shirts. Gosh, your eyes
  are red."</p>

  <p>"I've been on the job all night," he explained. "Poor old Cross wasn't up
  to cope with police procedure."</p>

  <p>"Did they really take photographs and measurements and fingerprints and
  statements and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And everything they could take?" finished Foam. "Yes, they did."</p>

  <p>She noticed the flatness of his tone and remembered her promise to his
  mother. "Don't let me hear another squeak, from you until you've had lunch,"
  she commanded.</p>

  <p>When he had finished his meal, he told her the main facts of the murder.
  She was thankful to hear that Evelyn could not have suffered, according to
  the medical evidence, as she had been stunned before being strangled. Her
  assailant had entered the room from the fire escape and through an open
  window; but he had been seen by no one and had left no clues to his
  identity.</p>

  <p>"Cross told the police nothing about his private affairs," said Foam. "He
  admitted under pressure that his daughter picked up strangers and had been
  absent from the hotel, presumably living with a young man. In the
  circumstances, they conclude it is a <i>crime passionel</i>. The ransom
  demand proved a hoax. No one showed up at Victoria, so it looks like a device
  to lure the father from the flat. Cross kept the revenge angle to himself.
  But it's no odds. The police have a better chance, working on this line than
  I did when he confused the issues with a lot of dope about mysterious
  enemies."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean he was just pulling your leg over them?"</p>

  <p>"I know no more than you do. He kept me in blinkers. I ought to feel
  sore&mdash;but I'm only sorry for the poor devil. My hunch is, he found
  himself caught up in a delicate and complicated situation&mdash;owing to
  special circumstances&mdash;and he tried to lie his way out of it, thinking
  he acted for the best. Of course, he's a natural liar. He gave his Christian
  name to the police as 'Richard.' Admitted that he had snaffled 'Raphael' as
  more striking for business purposes."</p>

  <p>"That's common sense," approved Viola. "I shall adopt another name when
  I've crashed the posters like the other film stars."</p>

  <p>Her eyes grew dreamy as she watched the fading spiral of her cigarette
  smoke.</p>

  <p>"Remember the first time we met?" she asked. "All the suspense and
  excitement, like the mistletoe bough. One expected to find&mdash;anything.
  And Raphael Cross was terrific. I can see him now, with his huge shoulders
  flung back and his fair hair glittering. He was all force and
  passion&mdash;like Thor hammering down the door."</p>

  <p>"The builder's men did the wrecking," Foam reminded her. "All Thor did was
  chew cigarettes and curse."</p>

  <p>It was strange that the old jealousy could persist even after Cross had
  lost his title to a rival. Watching his glum expression. Viola asked a
  question: "Worried about the case?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "It's not my headache. The police are working on it and
  I'm on the job. I was called in to find a missing girl. I didn't find her and
  she's no longer missing. My firm will send in their bill, so I score either
  way. And that's that."</p>

  <p>"Then what?"</p>

  <p>Foam raked his rough hair with his fingers.</p>

  <p>"The trouble is," he confessed, "I've a bit of my father in me. The old
  man's a doctor, and when a patient dies on him and he's not satisfied that
  he's killed him himself, he makes a post-mortem to find cause of death... I
  want to know too. I want to know exactly how and when Evelyn Cross got out of
  Pomerania House without attracting the attention of anyone there&mdash;and
  what happened to her afterwards. I abominate unfinished cases&mdash;all bits
  and pieces."</p>

  <p>As Viola remained silent, he changed the subject with a question. "How
  many detectives are keeping tab on Beatrice Stirling?"</p>

  <p>"Two," replied Viola. "One is always off duty."</p>

  <p>"So if the detective were nobbled, there'd only be you. Is the girl likely
  to double-cross you?"</p>

  <p>"No, there are no rules, but she keeps them all."</p>

  <p>"All the same, be careful. Especially of yourself."</p>

  <p>She tried to assure him that that lack of sleep could account for his
  sudden apprehension. At that moment, his latent prejudice against Raphael
  Cross flared up into a threat to Viola. It was through his agency that she
  had become attached to the Stirling household. A multi-millionaire's daughter
  was such glittering bait to a kidnapper, that he flinched at the possibility
  of a grand scale reproduction of the recent tragedy.</p>

  <p>As he thought of poor, dead Nell Gaynor and then of a murdered blonde
  girl, it seemed to him that Raphael Cross was dogged by evil fortune which
  spent its force on others.</p>

  <p>He repeated his caution.</p>

  <p>"Be careful for yourself."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14">XIV. &mdash; PHOTOGRAPHS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE following day, Raphael Cross drifted into the Stirlings'
  hotel. He appeared to be as pathetically aimless as a lost dog, but he
  refused to refer to the tragedy.</p>

  <p>"It's all behind me," he said. "Nothing can bring her back. Any bridge
  this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>Although Mrs. Stirling and the girls were impressed by his courage, he
  antagonized the millionaire by his lack of emotion.</p>

  <p>"No bridge for me," he said. "Not in the mood. I want to go somewhere
  quiet with Beatrice."</p>

  <p>As he looked at his daughter with slavish devotion, Cross spoke
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>"You're right, Stirling. Enjoy her company while you have her. I let
  Evelyn come and go. It seems now I was wrong, but I wanted her to have her
  freedom... I never go to the zoo. I hate to see caged animals."</p>

  <p>"I wonder which caged animal I resemble," said Beatrice.</p>

  <p>The silence which followed her recognition of the personal element was so
  strained, that Viola tried to introduce some comic relief.</p>

  <p>"Darling," she said, "you are like me&mdash;perfect simian type. We must
  go to the monkey house and pick out our doubles."</p>

  <p>The rebellion faded from Beatrice's intelligent brown eyes, which appeared
  smaller than they were because of her youthful plumpness.</p>

  <p>"Too near the bone. Greeny," she said gaily. "It's on record that the
  first time I saw a monkey, I said 'Hallo, Daddy.'"</p>

  <p>Bending down, she kissed the foci of Raphael Cross' head with a complete
  lack of self-consciousness.</p>

  <p>"We don't really forget," she whispered, as though in apology for the
  frivolity.</p>

  <p>Her father&mdash;who was minus her scruples&mdash;began to ask questions
  as to the progress made by the police towards detection of the criminal.</p>

  <p>"Nothing new," explained Cross. "There's been a police message on the air
  from the B.B.C. asking for information from&mdash;or about&mdash;any person
  or persons in whose company she had been last."</p>

  <p>"I heard it," said Stirling. "No one come forward?"</p>

  <p>"Crowds. People who saw her in different cars, with different men, in
  different places&mdash;all at the same time."</p>

  <p>"What about the fellow she went off with? Is he lying low, too?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally. She's been murdered since she left him. Only a fool would let
  himself in for certain trouble."</p>

  <p>The millionaire's lips tightened to a thin line. "I don't understand you.
  Cross," he said coldly, "Anyone would think you had no interest in avenging
  your daughter's death."</p>

  <p>Raphael Cross' blue eyes blazed with sudden passion. For a moment he
  seemed to recapture his old electric quality, so that&mdash;in spite of
  Foam's ridicule&mdash;Viola thought again of Thor.</p>

  <p>"You're right," he shouted. "I don't care a damn one way or the other.
  Only one thing matters. Evelyn is dead. I've got to forget. I can blow out my
  brains&mdash;or I can keep on with bridge and business as usual. I may try
  out both ways before I'm through."</p>

  <p>"I still can't see it," said Stirling, plugging his point. "If it were my
  child, I'd hunt down her murderer if it took my last cent and the last day of
  my life. But I'd find him&mdash;and when I did, I'd tear him limb from
  limb."</p>

  <p>This time it was her father whom Beatrice kissed, rubbing her petal-smooth
  cheek against his parchment skin.</p>

  <p>"You've got a lynch complex, my sweet," she told him, "and you can't
  expect civilized people to agree with you. To punish you, I'm going to ring
  up Billy Austin and ask him if he'd like you as a father-in-law. Coming,
  Greeny?"</p>

  <p>As the girls walked off, arm in arm, Stirling spoke with appreciation.
  "We're grateful to you, Cross, for finding us that girl. Beatrice is never
  bored with her. All the same, I'm glad they've gone. I want to talk to you
  with the gloves off." He turned to his wife&mdash;a question in his
  eyes&mdash;but she shook her head as a sign she intended to stay. "The papers
  make out," began Stirling bluntly, "that Evelyn's murder is a common or
  garden crime of passion. Now that doesn't show your daughter in too good a
  light. Of course, I don't know what really happened and I'm not
  asking&mdash;It's not my affair."</p>

  <p>"I'll be frank with you." said Cross, speaking with an obvious effort. "It
  was an escapade. There have been other week-ends I could not check up on,
  although she never went off for as long as this before. I've forced myself to
  look upon it as youth&mdash;and the natural thing&mdash;and to take a broad
  view. I hope you can be broad too."</p>

  <p>"But the story is in the press," persisted Stirling. "In your place, I'd
  have lied to the last ditch to protect my girl's honour. Why didn't you hand
  out your revenge theory about the mining claim to the police?"</p>

  <p>"Tell them my private business?" asked Cross derisively. "The last thing
  I'd do is give them a break. But they won't make an arrest working from the
  'passion' angle. All they got from me is mud in their eye."</p>

  <p>"You seem very prejudiced," remarked Mrs. Stirling. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because, if I hadn't called in the police, Evelyn would be alive."</p>

  <p>The apprehensive look that flickered between Mrs. Stirling and her husband
  betrayed that they expected the reproach. Her small figure seemed to shrivel
  as she shrank back into a corner of the grey-blue divan, while the
  millionaire's lean face appeared to have acquired extra lines. At that moment
  the richest guests in the hotel looked pitiful and deflated&mdash;a tonic
  example of the non-staying power of wealth to any complacent moralist with
  inexpensive tastes.</p>

  <p>"I'm not blaming you," went on Cross. "You gave me advice but I was not
  forced to take it. I'm a free agent and I went to the Yard under my own
  steam. There is no doubt about it&mdash;I was watched... They knew I'd
  gone."</p>

  <p>"What is your own idea of what happened?" asked Mrs. Stirling anxiously.
  "Keep quiet, Will, and don't interrupt."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you, more or less," said Cross, "and I don't think I'm far
  out. Certain parties wanted to get even with me over a business score. Their
  idea was to kidnap Evelyn and stick me up for ransom. Make me sweat both
  ends. But when they came to action, they found out that murder is a nice,
  simple proposition compared with kidnapping."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Stirling's eyes dilated and her lips parted as she listened with
  enthralled interest.</p>

  <p>"I've figured it out," went on Cross. "Kidnapping is a question of getting
  the victim in exactly the right place at exactly the right moment. It needs a
  perfect decoy, plus perfect timing... Now that's almost impossible. You might
  work it in a special set of circumstances, like a girl taking a country walk
  alone. But in our cases, with people always around, you can call it off right
  away. You couldn't make a strong lively girl into a paper parcel and walk off
  with her without questions asked."</p>

  <p>In her relief, Mrs. Stirling forgot her own ban on interruption. "I see
  your point," she cried. "It's true&mdash;society is its own protection
  against an anti-social crime. Of course, Beatrice is never alone. And your
  Evelyn was so popular. That was her protection."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I figured she was safe in a crowd of boy friends. Besides,
  kidnapping is a fifty-fifty proposition. You pay a ransom, but you can't bank
  on getting your girl back. On the other hand, the kidnapper may get your
  girl, but he can't bank on the father coming across with the cash. And of
  course, if the police are notified, his hope is dead as frozen mutton."</p>

  <p>"And that is why I advised the police," broke in Stirling, eager to
  justify his judgment.</p>

  <p>Cross looked at him with cold, hostile eyes, as&mdash;ignoring his
  interruption&mdash;he went on speaking. "These parties found they'd taken on
  a tricky job. Of course, they watched my hotel and kept a tab on our
  movements. They must have seen Evelyn meet her chap outside Pomerania House
  and knew where they went&mdash;but still they couldn't get her, with him
  always around. So they grew impatient and sent that ransom letter to find out
  where they stood... When I went to the Yard, they knew I wasn't going to play
  ball with them."</p>

  <p>His voice thickened and stumbled to a pause. "They took their revenge
  instead," he said, after a pause. "It was just mean spite work... The hoax
  letter they sent was a two-way stunt. It showed them where they stood over
  the ransom&mdash;and it took me out of the flat."</p>

  <p>"But how could they possibly know that she was coming back that night?"
  asked Mrs. Stirling.</p>

  <p>"They probably sent her a fake message from me. I shall never know the
  whole. I'm in the dark about so much. There was a crowd of suckers, so I
  don't know who stabbed me in the back... But I am sure of one thing. It's
  this. Never bring the police into a case of kidnapping. Keep them out, and
  you still have a chance."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Stirling rose impulsively and, taking Cross' large hand pressed it in
  silent sympathy. Her husband looked on as he first swallowed vigorously and
  then cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"There's something more that's got to be said, Cross," he was beginning,
  when his wife stopped him.</p>

  <p>"No, let me say it. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do and that's
  the reason why I must do it. R, C. knows how much I feel for him and that I
  wouldn't hurt him any more if I could possibly help it."</p>

  <p>Cross looked down on her and smiled bleakly. "That's told me," he said.
  "Shall I say it for you? You don't want me to go round with Beatrice any
  more. That it?"</p>

  <p>She nodded&mdash;her eyes full of concern for his wounded feelings.</p>

  <p>"Not in public," she explained. "Of course, we are not afraid of her being
  kidnapped over here. It's not a British crime. But your trouble proves that
  you are marked in a certain quarter&mdash;and we don't want to attract any
  attention to Beatrice, or have her linked up in any way to that."</p>

  <p>"That's O.K. with me."</p>

  <p>"Then you do understand? You don't blame us? Thank you, R. C. But
  remember, we shall want to see all the more of you in private, or Beatrice
  will start a mutiny. Come here whenever you can. And now, what about some
  bridge? I can fix up a game."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Stirling was crossing to the telephone when Cross called her
  back.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you would like to see something first?" he said. "I have some
  photographs of Evelyn. She looks so peaceful."</p>

  <p>Drawing from his pocket a small pile of shiny unmounted photographs, he
  handed them to Mrs. Stirling.</p>

  <p>Tears started to her eyes as she gazed at the top copy. It showed a girl
  apparently asleep in bed. Only a little of her face was visible as it was
  concealed&mdash;partly by the sheet and partly by her thick waving hair which
  was spread out over the pillow.</p>

  <p>"Beautiful," she murmured. "Will, isn't she sweet? No one would
  guess&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She broke off with a scream&mdash;her face stiff with horror and her hand
  rigidly extended. While passing the first photograph to her husband, she had
  seen the second portrait her action had exposed.</p>

  <p>There was nothing beautiful or peaceful about it. A blonde girl in a
  contorted pose with staring eyes.</p>

  <p>Cross sprang forward and snatched it from her. "How the hell did that get
  in?" he muttered. "It's one of the police snaps. I'm sorry you saw it."</p>

  <p>"You should be more careful. Cross," remarked the millionaire. "That's not
  the sort of thing to show to women. Suppose Beatrice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hold your tongue." In her anger, the delicate Mrs. Stirling snapped as
  fiercely as any fishwife. "You make me sick and ashamed of your drivel about
  my feelings. Surely I can bear just to look at a photograph when her
  father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her voice broke and she burst into tears.</p>

  <p>"We mustn't let Beatrice hear about this," said her husband.</p>

  <p>While her peace of mind was being safeguarded, Beatrice was engaged in a
  telephone conversation with young Austin. She showed to least advantage on
  these occasions as she shed her dignified adult personality and lapsed into
  silly school-girl sentiment.</p>

  <p>Viola stood beside her to keep her company and act as her inspiration.
  Bored with preparing verbal bullets for the other girl to fire, she was
  gazing idly around the room, when the sight of a bowl of blue forced
  hyacinths aroused a memory.</p>

  <p>"I've got to ring up someone at once," she told Beatrice. "It's my only
  chance to avert a tragedy."</p>

  <p>"You make everything sound dramatic, Greeny," remarked Beatrice enviously.
  "Use this line. I've finished."</p>

  <p>Although she went into her bedroom where Viola's words were inaudible, she
  could hear a bubbling undercurrent of laughter. It suggested
  excitement&mdash;intrigue&mdash;and made her sullenly resentful of the
  special circumstances which had denied her her freedom.</p>

  <p>The millionaire had been premature in his gratitude to Raphael Cross. The
  perfect companion was in danger of wrecking the Stirling machine by the
  introduction of the personal element, against which all the devotion of
  parents and service of hirelings could not prevail.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15">XV. &mdash; THE FIRST CLUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE bowl of hyacinths in Beatrice's room had reminded Viola
  of her own bulbs. She had left behind her, at the bottom of the kitchen
  cupboard in her flatlet at Pomerania House, an orange bowl of purple
  crocuses. They were just beginning to show pallid spikes when she had rushed
  off to her new job, without giving a thought to their welfare. Unless she
  could ask someone to water them at once, by her return they would be
  shrivelled beyond hope of recovery.</p>

  <p>At first, she did not know to whom to appeal. Major Pomeroy would make
  promises and purposely forget to ask his own secretary or the porter to do
  the job. It was not his policy to let the staff wait on tenants and waste the
  time for which he had paid. On the same principle, he discouraged incoming
  calls on the public telephone in the hall.</p>

  <p>There remained Madame Goya and Miss Power. Madame had a telephone
  installed in her flat, so she could contact her without trouble; but as she
  remembered the woman's bulging eyes and inquisitive stare, Viola shrank from
  the idea of letting her loose among her secrets. She had visited the
  universal "Uncle" frequently in her lean periods and the corresponding gaps
  in her apartment were tactlessly revealing.</p>

  <p>Miss Power was the ideal person for the commission. Although her manner
  was coldly grudging, she had never refused to loan her possessions. Moreover,
  she was not only conscientious, but her code would not allow her to notice
  either deficiency or makeshift.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately she was not a telephone subscriber, Viola knew it was
  hopeless to count on delivery of any message she sent to the office while she
  dared not make Madame Goya the medium, lest she should offer her own
  services. Suddenly she realized that it was her chance to get in touch with
  Alan Foam and ask him to act as her messenger.</p>

  <p>"Take the message when you go home," she told him. "It's only a little out
  of your way. You'll find Power in because she always swots all day. She's a
  grim virgin but she's the only person I can rely on."</p>

  <p>It was a strange experience for Foam to renew his association with
  Pomerania House. When he had first entered it he was summoned to explore a
  baffling mystery which had fizzled out into wind; but, to atone for his
  disappointment, he had drawn from the air the intangible spirit of romance.
  His youth had returned to him in a meeting with a black-haired girl, and some
  shreds of enchantment still lingered.</p>

  <p>The porter, who reminded him of the old gardener, stopped reading his
  evening paper to admit him.</p>

  <p>"Remember me, Pearce?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I remember your business," replied the man grimly, "The boss told me it
  was that gentleman's daughter what was murdered. Explains why he carried on
  like he did. He knew she was going to be done in. It was a close shave for us
  you didn't find what you were looking for then."</p>

  <p>As Foam did not respond, he added with a change of manner, "The boss is in
  his office."</p>

  <p>Directly Foam entered the hall, he realized that without the dramatic and
  emotional circumstances of his first visit it had lost its fascination. Its
  eighteenth-century atmosphere had receded into the past, leaving behind it
  only some stranded museum pieces.</p>

  <p>A sound of rapid typing issued from the office where Major Pomeroy stood
  in the doorway. As he caught sight of Foam, he stepped back instinctively, as
  though in retreat. Thinking better of it, he stopped to light a cigarette
  with a shade too much deliberation before he sauntered forward.</p>

  <p>"Want to see anyone?" he asked nonchalantly. He looked as
  usual&mdash;thin, disillusioned and immaculate&mdash;but Foam received the
  impression that he was an unwelcome visitor.</p>

  <p>"Miss Power," he replied.</p>

  <p>The major's eyes filled with keen inquiry, but he said nothing. Directly
  Foam had explained that he had come to deliver a message from Viola, he
  thawed to geniality. "Charming girl. Too casual to be an ideal tenant, but at
  least she is loyal. I'm keeping her apartment vacant for her&mdash;had to
  turn down an attractive offer. By the way, the Cross murder has done me no
  good. I'm losing a tenant over it&mdash;Miss Power."</p>

  <p>"How could it affect her?" asked Foam.</p>

  <p>"You've said it. How? But you made some inquiries at her flat the day Miss
  Cross was missing and that would be enough to scare our Miss Power. She
  probably feels that Pomerania House was indirectly connected with a crime,
  since the father was so suspicious of these premises. Seen anything of Cross
  lately?"</p>

  <p>"Now and again," replied Foam vaguely. "Have you?"</p>

  <p>"No. To be frank, I don't want to after he left me with the baby to hold.
  I was put to inconvenience and expense through his panic and I'm still
  getting the repercussions. Miss Power is a good tenant. But, of course, this
  murder shows he was really up against something. In fact&mdash;apart from
  business&mdash;I feel sorry for the poor devil."</p>

  <p>As the men stood and talked, several people passed them on their way out
  to the street. Foam recognized Marlene, the ginger-haired
  typist&mdash;attractive in a coat of white fur fabric&mdash;before he became
  aware that Madame Goya was coming down the stairs.</p>

  <p>She wore a sable cape and a tiny hat with a cloud of floating veiling. The
  furs made her appear unusually bulky, but in spite of her overweight she
  balanced herself perfectly on high Spanish heels. As she recognized Foam, her
  darkly pouched eyes began to bolt while her painted frog-mouth gaped
  open.</p>

  <p>"You again?" she cried shrilly. "It's no use asking me questions, I know
  nothing. Nothing."</p>

  <p>The major suddenly gripped her arm, but his voice was suave as he
  hurriedly explained Foam's errand. She recovered her composure immediately
  and gave an apologetic laugh.</p>

  <p>"Silly of me. But your other visit was a calamity. You upset me
  terribly&mdash;turning me out of my flat and making me lose business. Can you
  wonder that directly I saw you I said to myself, 'More trouble.'"</p>

  <p>"That's the sort of reputation you have here, Foam," remarked the major.
  "I'll see if Miss Power is in."</p>

  <p>In contrast with his usually leisurely movements, he bounded up the
  stairs. His haste and also his offer to act as a messenger struck Foam as
  being so out of character that he became curious.</p>

  <p>"I seem to be putting the wind up this outfit," he reflected. "Why? Does
  he want to prepare Miss Power for the shock of seeing me?"</p>

  <p>He was about to sprint after the major so that he could witness her
  reaction when Madame Goya stopped him.</p>

  <p>"You acted for Mr. Cross, didn't you? What was his daughter like? There
  were no photographs in my paper, but they said she was a blonde. Was she fair
  like her father? Did she have blue eyes?"</p>

  <p>"I only saw her once," replied Foam. "That was&mdash;afterwards. Then her
  face was purple-black and her eyes were like something on a fishmonger's
  slab. I didn't want to look at them twice&mdash;so I cannot tell you their
  colour."</p>

  <p>He deliberately wanted to horrify the woman as he both disliked and
  distrusted her; but now that she was on her guard, she merely clicked with
  conventional horror. He noticed, however, the signs of shock in her scared
  eyes and wobbling chin.</p>

  <p>"Might be Anno Domini&mdash;or an accident&mdash;or gin," he decided.
  "There can be nothing against the old ruin. Her flat looked like the walls of
  Jericho after the men had done their little bit."</p>

  <p>Her innocence in connection with the Cross affair had been proved in too
  drastic a fashion for him to question. Yet he had an uneasy impression that
  she had been holding him back from following the major. All the while she had
  asked for information her eyes watched the landing, and the moment Miss Power
  appeared at the top of the stairs she hurried away.</p>

  <p>He had only a vague recollection of Miss Power, apart from the fact that
  she was fair and wore tweeds. Looking at her more closely, he realized that
  she might be considered attractive, although she did not appeal to him. She
  was blonde and slim, with excellent complexion and teeth; but her face was a
  shade too narrow and her eyes were hard.</p>

  <p>He told himself that she was typed&mdash;the conventional vicar's eldest
  daughter. She was dressed in the same blue-green speckled suit and wore
  similar stout stockings and shoes. And yet he was conscious of some change in
  her appearance.</p>

  <p>As he stared at her, trying vainly to discover the point of difference,
  she gave him a hint not to waste her time.</p>

  <p>"I understand you have a message for me from Miss Green."</p>

  <p>When Foam explained Viola's request, her reception was characteristic.</p>

  <p>"I am giving up my rooms here," she said. "But you can tell Miss Green
  that I will water her bulbs before I go. They should keep moist until she
  comes back. Of course, I shall have to ask Major Pomeroy for the key of her
  apartment. Before he gives it to me Miss Green must give him the authority.
  Otherwise I may place myself in a false position."</p>

  <p>"I will give Major Pomeroy her telephone number," promised Foam.</p>

  <p>When he was in the tube, travelling home to Highgate, he turned over in
  his mind his recent visit.</p>

  <p>"The case of the missing girl is over," he thought. "It's lumber now, and
  the sooner I clear it out of my mind, the better."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he remembered the notebook in which he jotted down his first
  impressions of the persons in each new case. It was on occasions such as this
  that he had proved its value. It had recorded a significant loss of weight
  which pointed to worry and also revealed an altered
  personality&mdash;indicative of a deliberate attempt to create a false
  impression.</p>

  <p>It was only to satisfy his curiosity that he searched his pockets. When he
  found that he had left the record behind him at the office, he dismissed the
  trifle from his mind.</p>

  <p>When he reviewed the matter later he acquitted himself of blame. The
  missing girl had been found, and it was the business of the police to follow
  up any clues.</p>

  <p>Yet the fact remained that had he been able to freshen his memory at that
  moment, he might have started a train of suspicions and thus averted a second
  crime.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16">XVI. &mdash; HAND-MADE GLOVES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EVENTS were moving swiftly towards catastrophe. Like a
  procession of shadows sweeping over a lighted wall&mdash;a speech or contact
  was a forecast of future developments. Spinning in a whirl of infatuation,
  Viola's head was not sufficiently clear to register emotions or to notice
  when Beatrice withdrew her confidence.</p>

  <p>The younger girl's clear brown eyes lost their candour and narrowed with
  jealousy when, on entering Viola's room that evening, she surprised her at
  the telephone. Her companion was engrossed with her conversation while she
  had managed to create her special atmosphere of excitement.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "I've heard nothing. But I know the man. He's waiting for
  me to move. It's nothing to him that he's wasting precious time... Yes, I'll
  get in touch with him and authorize the loan of my key."</p>

  <p>Feeling excluded from a mystery, Beatrice went to her own room and waited
  there for her companion. Unconscious of helping to create an emotional
  crisis, Viola spun out her call. As a matter of fact, what sounded like
  melodrama in Mayfair became a casual matter when it was linked up with the
  Highgate end of the wire. Foam had merely rung her up to give her Miss
  Power's message when he learned that Major Pomeroy had not yet telephoned for
  her instructions.</p>

  <p>The thrill was localized in the sound of Alan's voice. Viola did not
  realize how the time had passed until she glanced at her watch. After putting
  through a brief call to Major Pomeroy, she hurried into Beatrice's room.</p>

  <p>"I was just ringing up Pomerania House," she explained.</p>

  <p>It cost Beatrice an effort to respond naturally, since her intelligence
  accused her of sulking. While she had been reared as a fairy princess and
  accustomed equally to homage and restrictions, her schoolgirl instincts had
  been suppressed. She was now in the grip of her first adolescent passion
  and&mdash;instead of spending it normally on a youth or a series of
  "raves"&mdash;she idealized Viola with the force of an affectionate and
  generous nature.</p>

  <p>"Pomerania House," she repeated with affected vagueness. "Isn't that the
  address of your flat?"</p>

  <p>"Flatlet." corrected Viola, beginning to gurgle like one of her faulty
  taps. "I'd love to show it to you. Especially the bathroom."</p>

  <p>"Is the shower very old fashioned?"</p>

  <p>Viola grinned at a memory of the wooden partition which enclosed the
  composite kitchen-scullery-larder-bath.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you must see it," she declared. "It would show you how the poor live.
  Listen, Princess, the bath has a cover and I keep my dishes on top."</p>

  <p>Without making any comment, Beatrice turned away and lit a cigarette. As
  she rarely smoked or drank, Viola glanced at her in some surprise. It changed
  to concern when she noticed that the girl's hands were shaking.</p>

  <p>"Anything the matter?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing." replied Beatrice in a strained voice. "Only I rather resent the
  way some people&mdash;exciting people like yourself&mdash;despise the people
  who have money. You don't seem to realize that it takes brains&mdash;and
  vision&mdash;and courage to make a large fortune. You only know Daddy's
  private life. I know he is unimpressive and that you sneer at him because
  everything he thinks, or says, or does is based on his love for Mother and
  me&mdash;But in the financial world, he is a force."</p>

  <p>"Of course, he is. As if I didn't know it, don't be silly."</p>

  <p>"Silly? But I am not exactly unintelligent. Apart from my education, I've
  read widely and studied social problems. I mean to do something definitely
  constructive with my wealth... So it does not amuse me to be regarded by R.
  C.&mdash;and yourself&mdash;as a pedigree Peke which has to be kept on a
  lead."</p>

  <p>Beatrice spoke with stiff lips while she rigidly controlled her facial
  muscles; but in spite of the lack of emotion, Viola surrendered herself to
  the drama of the situation.</p>

  <p>"Cut," she commanded, with instinctive imitation of a film director. "You
  have it all wrong. Completely out of focus. Why you are the only girl I've
  ever put on a pedestal. I think the world of you. If you were in danger, I'd
  risk my own life to save you."</p>

  <p>Beatrice gave an ungirlish laugh. "Really," she said, "I feel I ought to
  applaud. But I wish you could break away from this guarding complex. I'm a
  free agent. I may yet prove to all of you that I am not a cipher."</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you want to be snooty, I can't help it."</p>

  <p>Beatrice was only waiting to be laughed out of her mood but Viola
  neglected the chance of reconciliation. She felt she had made one good
  gesture and had been definitely snubbed. So she talked in her best social
  manner as the girls walked towards the sitting room of the suite.</p>

  <p>The millionaire and his wife were drinking cocktails before dinner while
  they waited for Raphael Cross. He joined them a few minutes later, making a
  tempestuous entrance. There was suppressed exultation in his face and voice
  and a boisterous excitement, suggestive of a schoolboy who had saved his side
  at cricket. He had changed into evening dress, but had evidently dressed away
  from the mirror, for his bow was tied crooked.</p>

  <p>"What's happened?" cried Mrs. Stirling impulsively. "Have
  they&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>She stopped, expecting to hear news of the arrest of Evelyn's
  murderer.</p>

  <p>"Marvellous news," he shouted. "I know my future."</p>

  <p>His announcement stunned his audience with a shock of surprise.</p>

  <p>"Fortune telling?" asked the millionaire incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Amazing. I'm still staggered. The fact is, all my life I've had a
  secret ambition to fill a certain exalted position. It's all so
  fantastic&mdash;so impossible&mdash;that I've never opened my mouth to a
  single soul. The only chance of fulfillment could come through a series of
  extraordinary repercussions. But each one of these would be a miracle in
  itself. As each event broke, instead of fizzling out, it would have to
  contact; and set in motion the next sequence."</p>

  <p>"It just couldn't happen," declared Stirling. "You might have a series of
  lucky reactions, but they couldn't continue to operate indefinitely."</p>

  <p>"My own point of view exactly. But Goya not only told me I should attain
  this&mdash;prominence&mdash;but she knew the first link in the chain of
  events. She looked into the crystal. The whole thing was like
  witchcraft."</p>

  <p>"You'd better have a drink," suggested Mrs. Stirling.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Christina. You too, drink to my future."</p>

  <p>Viola noticed the use of Mrs. Stirling's Christian name. She knew it was
  authorized since no one would attempt to take a liberty with the great little
  lady. "All one big family," she reflected. "I'm the outsider." She failed to
  notice the eager flame in Beatrice's eyes which betrayed the fact that she
  also wanted to dip into the future. Unable to bear the prospect of parting
  from Viola, she was hoping to lure her to America. But the way was stopped by
  the faithful companion&mdash;Cassie&mdash;and Beatrice could not contemplate
  the prospect of disloyalty.</p>

  <p>Torn between two impulses, she wanted guidance. This wonderful clairvoyant
  could warn her if she courted disaster, or reassure her if she were too
  scrupulous. Cassie's interest in the family might be mainly financial, in
  which case matters could be arranged.</p>

  <p>During dinner she was unusually silent. At the end of the meal, she took
  possession of Raphael Cross.</p>

  <p>"Come into a huddle," she invited. "I want you to tell me of tight corners
  and how to get out of them."</p>

  <p>"You'll never be in a tight corner," her father reassured her. "If I
  didn't think Mack and Don were equal to the job, I'd sack them,"</p>

  <p>"But I might strike the unguarded moment when I'd only myself to depend
  on. I want to be prepared."</p>

  <p>Raphael Cross laughed indulgently.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid she remembers my gangster yarns," he said. "Well, Beatrice,
  the big thing is&mdash;never give yourself away. No matter what is sprung on
  you, register no surprise. That gives you the vital time to think a jump
  ahead&mdash;and it jolts your opponent because it's unexpected."</p>

  <p>"How, exactly?" probed Beatrice with characteristic thoroughness.</p>

  <p>"How? I'll give you the angle. Suppose when we were together, I pointed a
  revolver at you. If you screamed or started to run, I'd be bound to plug you.
  Instinctive action, you know. But if you sat tight and smiled at me, you'd
  have me guessing."</p>

  <p>"Guessing what?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I might say to myself, 'She's not scared. Why? Does she know
  something that's in the bag?' And while I was trying to figure out what that
  might be, it would be your chance to plan your next move... It boils down to
  this. Never be taken off guard."</p>

  <p>"I could do that," declared Beatrice. "I've a natural poker face, haven't
  I, Mother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Christina regretfully. "A barbarous game&mdash;but
  Beatrice plays it perfectly.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to spring a surprise on you and see how you react," said
  Cross.</p>

  <p>"I'll hold you to that."</p>

  <p>Beatrice's wish to shine was rooted in humility as she felt some special
  quality was necessary to acquire interest in Viola's eyes. She looked eagerly
  at her companion to see the effect of her boast, but Viola stood aloof from
  the circle of admiration.</p>

  <p>"I hope my experience won't set Beatrice going," said Cross. "Christina,
  don't let her go near that dump. I still smell the stink of fish."</p>

  <p>"She shall not," promised Mrs, Stirling serenely. "Miss Green will
  remember it's verboten."</p>

  <p>Beatrice made no protest as, taking Cross' arm, she led him to the door.
  "Come down to the lounge," she said.</p>

  <p>Viola welcomed the decision, since the lounge offered more entertainment
  value than the privacy of the royal suite. Sitting in a corner, where she
  would be available if Beatrice claimed her services, she was able to watch
  the movement of social life around her. Raphael Cross and Beatrice sat in an
  alcove, veiled in a faint smoky haze, as Cross waved his cigar to illustrate
  his points.</p>

  <p>Don&mdash;the college boy&mdash;was also in a position where he could keep
  an eye on the heiress. He was a young giant, with curling hair growing low on
  his forehead and a resolute chin.</p>

  <p>When the millionaire and his wife entered the lounge they stopped to speak
  to Viola.</p>

  <p>"Bea's putting on a show to distract poor old Cross," explained her father
  proudly. "She must get her unselfishness from her mother."</p>

  <p>"We are going out, but I know she will be safe with you and Don," remarked
  Christina Stirling, ignoring the compliment.</p>

  <p>As she smiled down at her, Viola was captivated by the delicate austerity
  of her beauty. Accustomed to view people as photographic material, she
  appreciated the slight hollows and sharp angles of her bone structure.
  Christina wore a chinchilla wrap over draperies of faint blue and mauve, and
  the soft collar&mdash;framing the perfect oval of her face&mdash;seemed
  symbolic of the encircling warmth and protection provided by their favoured
  circumstances. No draught could chill the mother as she stepped into her car,
  while the daughter was guarded doubly&mdash;like a card queen.</p>

  <p>"Nothing can touch them," thought Viola, with a shade of resentment.</p>

  <p>She accompanied the parents when they crossed the lounge to wish their
  daughter "good night."</p>

  <p>"Any good market tips, Bea?" asked her father.</p>

  <p>"Not too practical," she replied. "An explosive cigar is nice and showy,
  but you can't offer a stranger a cigar without some encouragement. And I
  couldn't throw pepper in anyone's eyes."</p>

  <p>"I could," declared Viola ruthlessly. "If anyone made a pass at you, I
  would."</p>

  <p>"While we are on the subject of tips," broke in Christina, "I hope Will
  has been helpful to you, Raphael. A hint costs him nothing&mdash;but you
  might appreciate it."</p>

  <p>Cross shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said vehemently. "I appreciate the thought, but I hope William
  will do nothing of the kind. I admit that when I play round with boys who are
  in the money, I usually keep my ears buttoned back... But this is different.
  I've got to know Christina and Beatrice. I value that friendship too much to
  let money spoil it."</p>

  <p>Christina's pale cheek flushed deeper than her taint touch of rouge.
  "That's the loveliest compliment I've ever received," she said.</p>

  <p>When they had gone, Beatrice decided to go early to bed. Viola accompanied
  her dutifully as far as the door of her own room, when Beatrice spoke in a
  mysterious whisper.</p>

  <p>"I want to make a very private call. I must be certain no one listens in.
  I dare not use my line because of Don&mdash;Do you mind if I use your
  phone?"</p>

  <p>"Why ask?" inquired Viola. "I used yours."</p>

  <p>Unconcerned by the slavish copy of her own technique, she lit a cigarette
  and leaned against the wall of the corridor.</p>

  <p>In the hope of arousing curiosity, Beatrice waited before she turned over
  the pages of the telephone directory. Eventually she rang up a number in St.
  John's Wood. It was a speculative call, based upon an uncommon name; but it
  was justified when a deep voice boomed over the wire like an imprisoned
  bumble bee.</p>

  <p>"Madame Goya speaking."</p>

  <p>"Do you carry on your business at Pomerania House?" asked Beatrice.</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Goya.</p>

  <p>"Then please listen carefully. I have to consult you on a very important
  matter. I want you to look in the crystal for me. Tomorrow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'You must make an appointment."</p>

  <p>"I can't. You must keep the afternoon free for me. There's no question of
  your losing money. I will pay for any appointments you have to cancel."</p>

  <p>There was a slight pause before Goya gave proof of having swallowed the
  hook.</p>

  <p>"It must be understood that you come to order hand made gloves," she
  stipulated.</p>

  <p>"As many as the machine can turn out," declared Beatrice, who welcomed a
  chance to display the paternal shrewdness.</p>

  <p>"Then I will book the appointment," said Goya. "What name?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you that. You can call me Madame X."</p>

  <p>"But cannot you give me some reference to prove you are not of the
  police?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Miss Viola Green."</p>

  <p>"That will do. I know the name. I will wait all the afternoon for you. You
  have only to open the door and walk in. No. Sixteen."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17">XVII. &mdash; ACCIDENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE following morning, after the girls had finished lunch,
  Viola made a cheerful reference to their parting.</p>

  <p>"Golly, how the time flies. This time next week, you'll be in state on the
  Queen Mary and the flag will be flying over Pomerania House to show I'm in
  residence again."</p>

  <p>Beatrice bit her lip at the reminder. As she thought of grey foam-flecked
  rollers rushing past her stateroom window sweeping them apart, she set her
  jaw with determination to keep her appointment with Goya. Although she knew
  there would be strong opposition to it, she was desperate to find out whether
  Viola was enclosed in the crystal which mirrored her future.</p>

  <p>"I want to see your apartment this afternoon. Greeny," she said.</p>

  <p>"Your mother will have to O.K. that," remarked Viola, playing for
  safety.</p>

  <p>"Leave it to me and stand by."</p>

  <p>In spite of her special gifts, Beatrice had rather elementary mentality as
  regarded the truth. She looked upon it as an accommodating quality
  which&mdash;like a sharp lawyer's contract&mdash;was satisfied by adherence
  to the text of the agreement. Bursting into her mother's boudoir, she
  interrupted Christina's study of a bridge problem.</p>

  <p>"We're going to see the Academy of Dramatic Art where Greeny studied
  elocution," she announced. Then she raised her voice. "Greeny, I've just told
  Mother we propose to visit your old dump."</p>

  <p>"Objection?" asked Viola, appearing in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Of course not," murmured Christina. "But rather dull. I hope you'll enjoy
  it."</p>

  <p>"Come on, Greeny," commanded Beatrice. Nervous lest the success of her
  strategy should be spoiled by a fatal chance remark, she almost dragged Viola
  from the room...</p>

  <p>Looking back later, Christina remembered that Beatrice had forgotten to
  give her mother her customary farewell kiss.</p>

  <p>When the girls were back in Beatrice's room, the heiress asked a
  question.</p>

  <p>"Like to come to America, Greeny?"</p>

  <p>"My wings are always fluttering. When Hollywood calls me, I shall fly over
  on the Clipper."</p>

  <p>"And then you'll forget me? I know you want to go back to your own flat.
  I've seen you look around this room as if it were a padded cell."</p>

  <p>Viola glanced involuntarily at the peach brocade curtains, the deep,
  padded chairs&mdash;where she lost her gloves&mdash;and the snowy sheepskin
  rugs, while she cursed her own too-expressive face. "Don't be fatuous," she
  said. "It's been an enchanting experience. Of course, all this is
  rather&mdash;fat. But that's because I like plenty of room to circulate."</p>

  <p>"So do I. Strange but true."</p>

  <p>Viola felt suddenly convicted of selfishness as she looked at Beatrice.
  She had heavy circles beneath her eyes, suggestive of secret tears.</p>

  <p>"She's been doing the pillow act over young Austin," she reflected. "It's
  barbarous to keep her nobbled... I wonder if I could let her off her chain.
  I'll have a shot at it."</p>

  <p>Although the car was waiting outside the hotel, she rushed back to the
  boudoir. Mrs. Stirling's delicately pencilled brows puckered at the
  interruption.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I've a hunch Beatrice is fretting," explained Viola. "This holiday should
  have been a real break for her, but the Cross affair and all the suspicion
  has balled it up. Oh, don't you remember how happy she was that day at
  Selfridge's? Couldn't we leave the detective at home this afternoon? Just for
  once. I'll take marvellous care of her."</p>

  <p>Christina's face wore the set expression which showed that she was deeply
  moved.</p>

  <p>"Mack's on duty," she said, after a pause. "He has watched over Beatrice
  since she was a baby. He'd refuse. You couldn't break down his loyalty."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't we pretend to shake him off?"</p>

  <p>"I'll see what he has to say about it."</p>

  <p>When the Scot appeared he listened to the proposal with a grim face, but
  his keen eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>"I'll trail them in a taxi," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good show," approved Viola. "This is where I begin to run."</p>

  <p>Dashing from the room, she gripped Beatrice's arm and rushed her towards
  the lift.</p>

  <p>"Let's get off the mark before Mack," she panted.</p>

  <p>When the girls&mdash;breathless with laughter&mdash;collapsed in the car,
  Viola felt that her stratagem was justified. It was not only the scamper
  which made Beatrice's cheeks glow with colour; she seemed revitalized by the
  escapade.</p>

  <p>"I hope he'll chase us," she said. "It's like Chicago."</p>

  <p>The day was exceptionally dark, and the fog had thickened so that they
  seemed to be driving through the dun water of an ancient dock. Tiny yellow
  globes loomed murkily from vague buildings in the underworld. The conflict of
  light with shadow striped the misted windows with a confusion of nebulous
  patterns, so that Viola almost expected to see a strand of seaweed wavering
  outside the glass, or the gaping mouth of a fish.</p>

  <p>Enclosed in comfort, she wished that they could go on floating, with no
  port of call. The car was warm and she had eaten a heavy lunch; for, faced
  with the prospect of lean times ahead, she was developing camel technique and
  eating for the morrow.</p>

  <p>Presently Beatrice called through the tube and told the chauffeur to stop
  at a jeweller's shop in Bond Street, "I want you to choose a souvenir,
  Greeny," she said.</p>

  <p>Viola protested in a half-hearted fashion, for she liked the idea. "If you
  really want me to remember you," she suggested, "what about a string of
  cultured pearls? Whenever I wore it, I should think, 'If she wasn't a real
  princess, she was a damn good imitation.'... Cor lumme, that's my first swear
  for ages. But I don't suppose I can do you much harm now. The time's too
  short."</p>

  <p>When they were inside the shop and she discovered that Beatrice intended
  to buy her some real jewellery, she put up a strong opposition.</p>

  <p>"Sweet of you. Princess, but no and no; I'm not a cadge, definitely."</p>

  <p>"But I only want you to remember me," wailed Beatrice.</p>

  <p>As she refused to look at any substitute while Viola spurned the jewels
  with the contempt of the mother of the Gracchi, they left without buying
  anything, to Beatrice's disappointment.</p>

  <p>"Suppose we just dither and then go home," suggested Viola when they were
  back in the car.</p>

  <p>"No, I've got to see the academy," said Beatrice.</p>

  <p>When they arrived at the semi-visible Victorian building, Viola tried to
  sidetrack Beatrice by proposing a diversion.</p>

  <p>"Let's go into the office and pretend we want to enrol as students. I want
  to see if anyone remembers me. While I was there, I was always changing the
  colour of my hair. I was grooming myself for stardom."</p>

  <p>Unfortunately Beatrice considered that her obligation to the truth was
  covered by a view of the exterior of the academy.</p>

  <p>"There, I've seen it," she remarked. "Now we'll go to your flat."</p>

  <p>Viola could not understand her own reluctance to visit Pomerania House. It
  was as though she had a presentiment, of disaster. At first, she thought she
  was missing the broad back of the detective, seated beside the chauffeur.
  Although the taxi was following them as faithfully as a trained meal-hound,
  she had lost her usual sense of security.</p>

  <p>It made her realize that the shock of Evelyn Cross' murder&mdash;combined
  with the responsibility of the job&mdash;was beginning to wear her down. Foam
  had warned her to be very careful in view of the fact that she would be
  thrown on her own resources, should the human element fail. Yet she had
  deliberately shunted the detective at a time when Beatrice was showing signs
  of rebellion.</p>

  <p>As the car turned into the darkness and comparative solitude of Pomerania
  Square, the fog grew more baffling in its density. It floated between the
  leafless trees in spirals of misty vapour and piled itself up in shifting
  columns. Viewed in the shrouded light from the lamps, the central garden
  might have been a churchyard and the drifting shapes a company of straying
  ghosts which had forgotten the exact locations of their graves. Viola began
  to shiver with apprehension.</p>

  <p>She was not the only one to suffer from nerves. The afternoon had dragged
  with Madame Goya. She remained in a state of tension, as she did not know the
  time when Beatrice Stirling would arrive and she had to be in readiness. She
  was also keenly elated at the prospect of money coming to her, since the
  identity of the heiress was no secret to her.</p>

  <p>"My palm is itching," she murmured. "A good omen." She paced the long
  room, her high heels pitting the pile of the carpet, while she smoked
  continuously. Occasionally she went to the door to listen. There were many
  false alarms&mdash;footsteps on the stairs and girls' laughter&mdash;when the
  typists went down to the cloakroom to wash. Each sound sent her waddling back
  to her table to take up her pose. Seated under a blue-shaded lamp, she placed
  her stumpy fingertips together while she stared at the crystal.</p>

  <p>Presently she grew nervous under the strain of continuous inaction. Her
  palms were clammy and her heart knocked with suspense, Ever since she had
  glanced at her morning paper and read about the murder of a blonde girl, she
  had been in a state of suppressed fear. Although she was void of financial
  honesty, her code rejected crime. One cheated ladies in the way of business
  but one did not murder them.</p>

  <p>As she was overweight and had a weak heart, the shock appeared to have
  slowed her circulation. The entire sordid business was a mystery which
  frightened her the more because she had not been able to discuss it. Whenever
  she mentioned the subject, she received only a blank stare or a shake of the
  head.</p>

  <p>Her treacherous heart leaped at the sound of a loud bump from the other
  side of the thin partition wall. Eager for company, she hurried out on the
  landing just as Miss Power was pushing a box of books through the open door
  of her flat. She wore a matching topcoat over her greeny-blue tweed outfit
  and a stitched hat of the same material was pulled down over her eyes.</p>

  <p>As Goya appeared, she looked at her as though she resented her
  presence.</p>

  <p>"Has the van come?" asked Goya.</p>

  <p>"No," snapped Miss Power, turning back to her room.</p>

  <p>"But you are dressed."</p>

  <p>"I believe in being ready."</p>

  <p>"You're telling me. I've been kept hanging about all the afternoon. And
  I'm not the thing. That murder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Goya broke off as Miss Power slammed the door of No. 17 behind her. Unable
  to unburden herself in gossip, she crossed the broad landing and peeped over
  the balustrade. She saw only the white gleam of the bathing nymph in the
  hall. Heaving a deep sigh, she returned to No. 16.</p>

  <p>Presently she decided that a dash of spirit in a hot drink would warm her
  up. As she had lunch and tea on the premises, she always brought vacuum
  flasks with her and a thermos&mdash;still unopened&mdash;stood on one of the
  bookshelves.</p>

  <p>Uncorking it clumsily, she poured out some coffee with nervous haste, so
  that some of it slopped into the saucer. Then she dropped down on the divan
  and began to drink lustily with deep gulps.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she clucked with annoyance as she realized that she had been
  holding her cup and saucer crooked. The overflow had drained down on one arm
  of the divan, where it spread out in a blotch as large as a misshapen vine
  leaf.</p>

  <p>As she stared at it, the mishap was magnified to a disaster. Its special
  significance began to dawn on Madame's slow brain, stiffening her features in
  a grimace of horror. Rushing from the room and down the stairs, she flung
  open the door of Major Pomeroy's office.</p>

  <p>She stood in the doorway, making mouths at him until she recovered breath
  to speak.</p>

  <p>"I've had an accident," she gasped. "I've spilt coffee over the
  divan."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; "WHERE ARE YOU?"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">TO the surprise of his secretary, the major stopped in the
  middle of his dictation.</p>

  <p>"I'll finish later," he told her.</p>

  <p>Although the matter only concerned the familiar careless tenant, he was
  obviously anxious to inspect the damage to his property.</p>

  <p>"If you'll go on up," he said to Goya, "I'll join you in a minute."</p>

  <p>Putting on a dangerous spurt, Madame hurried up the stairs. The major
  followed her at his usual leisurely pace; but when he had closed the door of
  No. 16 behind him, his expression lost its nonchalance.</p>

  <p>"Look," she cried, pointing to the stain. "It shows."</p>

  <p>"Like hell," he agreed. "You fool."</p>

  <p>"It was an accident. Help me push the divan back against the other
  wall."</p>

  <p>"No. There's no time for a general shift round. She may be here any
  moment. Find something to cover it."</p>

  <p>"What?" she quavered, her painted frog-mouth beginning to gape.</p>

  <p>"A scarf&mdash;or large handkerchief. Quick."</p>

  <p>Galvanized into motion, Goya rushed to the wardrobe cupboard and scraped
  in the deep pockets in the lining of her fur coat. Scooping up a large silken
  square of blended shades of purple and fuschia, she threw it negligently over
  the stain.</p>

  <p>"There," she said. "Everything's all right again."</p>

  <p>The major looked at her with cold contempt. Taking up her largest pair of
  scissors, he deliberately cut the scarf into halves.</p>

  <p>"How dare you?" she protested. "You've ruined it."</p>

  <p>"And you might have ruined everything else," the major reminded her.</p>

  <p>Slipping one half of the scarf into his pocket, he arranged the other half
  over the stain and then stood looking at it as though to study the
  effect.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch it," he commanded. "Keep away from the divan. You'll be safer
  over at your table."</p>

  <p>Madame Goya obeyed meekly. When she had seated herself with difficulty in
  the narrow space, she clapped one hand to her heart.</p>

  <p>"That was a close shave," she said. "I'm glad I called you. I should never
  have noticed I'd slipped up until it was too late."</p>

  <p>"It is dangerous to forget. Later on, it will be dangerous to
  remember."</p>

  <p>"But you can't blame me for feeling nervous. I'm a woman, Major, and I've
  had a terrible shock. I keep asking myself who murdered that girl. And
  why?"</p>

  <p>Major Pomeroy moistened his lips.</p>

  <p>"No good asking me," he said. "All I know is, we've got to go through with
  it."</p>

  <p>"Suppose I backed out?" asked Madame in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you could&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>There was menace as well as doom in the major's voice. Then shaking off
  his heavy mood, he glanced at his watch and walked briskly to the door.</p>

  <p>"I must hustle," he said, "or I shan't have time for the finishing
  touch."</p>

  <p>The major was right when he mentioned the time factor, for Goya's client
  had just reached Pomerania House. As the car stopped before the beautiful and
  familiar door, Viola felt a pang of spurious guilt. Although the visit had
  been authorized by Mrs. Stirling, she knew that it was her exaggerated
  description which had made Beatrice anxious to see her room.</p>

  <p>The porter welcomed Viola as an old friend.</p>

  <p>"Cor lumme, I'm glad to see you again."</p>

  <p>"Cor lumme, I'm glad to see you," responded Viola. "I want my key, please
  I'm going up to my flat."</p>

  <p>While she waited for Pearce to return from the office, she began to point
  out the special features of the hall to Beatrice.</p>

  <p>"I'm enchanted," the girl assured her. "What a marvellous sweep of
  staircase. All this is history living here must make you feel uplifted. No
  wonder you despise luxury hotels."</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, with a swift change of expression, her lips curved in a
  smile of superior amusement. At that moment she might have been older than
  her mother. "Are you going to keep poor old Mack outside in the fog?" she
  asked. "It's all right, he knows I'm wise to him. The last time we got out of
  the car, I waved to his taxi&mdash;and he waved back."</p>

  <p>"Well," gasped Viola, forcing a laugh; "You make me feel a wart."</p>

  <p>"I was practising my poker face so as to be ready for. R. C... But suppose
  you fetch Mack?"</p>

  <p>When Viola had gone outside the hall, Beatrice intercepted the porter and
  took from him the key of No. 15.</p>

  <p>"Where abouts is No. 16?" she asked casually.</p>

  <p>"Next to fifteen,"' replied Pearce. "It's the middle door."</p>

  <p>Viola met Mack as he was mounting the steps of Pomerania House, without
  waiting for an invitation. He grinned at her to express his appreciation of
  the acumen of the Stirling brain.</p>

  <p>"You can't fool the lassie," he said proudly.</p>

  <p>"I've an inkling of something of the sort," remarked Viola. "For your
  information, we are going up to my flatlet. First landing, No. 15."</p>

  <p>"No. 15," chanted the Scot. "Under observation. O.K."</p>

  <p>Beatrice stood at the foot of the staircase, still gazing around her. Her
  face was flushed&mdash;her voice low and husky&mdash;as she placed her hand
  impulsively on Viola's arm.</p>

  <p>"I want to tell you something. I've loved this afternoon&mdash;and I'll
  tell you why. It's because you tried to give me a thrill. That counts
  terribly&mdash;because it shows me you were thinking of me. Yours was like
  Browning&mdash;high failure. Oh, Greeny, wouldn't it be wonderful if you and
  I could go together on a real adventure! Just the two of us&mdash;and both of
  us free."</p>

  <p>The unexpected outburst made Viola feel embarrassed and vaguely guilty. It
  was disconcerting to realize that Beatrice was slipping beyond her mental
  control, while the glow in her eyes suggested banked-up fires of affection
  which only needed a breath of encouragement to shoot up in a blaze.</p>

  <p>In spite of her instinctive urge always to play up to a dramatic
  situation, she felt it was healthier to sustain the character of a cool and
  capable companion.</p>

  <p>"It will be an adventure for you to walk upstairs," she remarked. "There's
  no lift."</p>

  <p>To create a diversion, she called out to Pearce: "There's a furniture van
  outside. Who's shooting the moon?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Power," replied the porter.</p>

  <p>"Power? Then it's my mistake. No shooting. Beatrice, come up quickly.
  You're going to see a real type. Perfect lady."</p>

  <p>As they mounted the shallow treads, a shout warned them to stand clear of
  the bend. A man was rolling a packing case down the stairs, while Miss Power
  stood on the landing to direct him.</p>

  <p>She nodded to Viola as she turned back into No. 17. "I watered your
  bulbs," she said.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," called Viola. "And thanks for all the loans."</p>

  <p>"What did you borrow?" asked Beatrice curiously.</p>

  <p>"Husbands. She has three of everything. And now for No. 15. Good old No.
  15."</p>

  <p>First pressing it to her lips, Viola inserted the key in the lock. It was
  stiff from disuse and she had to use some force to turn it. While she was
  wrestling with it, Mack lumbered up the stairs. With his deceptive
  elephantine speed he took up a position outside No. 17, from whence he
  commanded a general view of the landing.</p>

  <p>Miss Power did not leave him long in possession of his post.</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly stand on one side?" asked a cold voice behind him. "You
  are blocking the door. The men are bringing out a wardrobe."</p>

  <p>Mack glanced into the dismantled room and then sidestepped to avoid the
  thrust of a determined piece of furniture which seemed to be acting in
  co-operation with the removers. It came forward with a rush, but apparently
  misjudged the width of the doorway for it filled it up completely like a
  wall.</p>

  <p>"You've got her flush. Try her sideways," advised Mack.</p>

  <p>Still busy with the key, Viola looked up just as Major Pomeroy sauntered
  up the stairs. He was holding a slip of paper, at the sight of which she had
  a pang of premonition. She felt certain that he was bringing her some
  important news, and she prayed that her loyalty would not be put to the test.
  Then she noticed that Beatrice had opened the door of No. 16, so that Madame
  Goya's apartment was visible from the landing. Compared with its former
  appearance when it was under suspicion of concealing a girl, it looked
  comparatively bare. The white and gold walls presented plain surfaces in the
  place of wooden panels. The velvet window curtains had been removed,
  revealing closed white shutters. Even the wardrobe had been left open and
  contained only a fur coat on a hanger.</p>

  <p>The place was dimly illuminated by a single lamp on the table at the far
  end of the room. Behind it, Goya sat hunched over her crystal like an ugly
  idol. The light showed the buff carpet, the conventional suite and a huge
  picture which hung on one wall. On the other side, the mirror in its new gilt
  frame reflected an orange and jade rug and part of the divan with brilliant
  cushions. The stain on its arm was covered by a purplish silk scarf thrown
  over it with apparent carelessness.</p>

  <p>Viola had seen the room since its redecoration, so its altered appearance
  was not a novelty. At the same time, she was aware of a slight change. It was
  not any addition to the furniture, for her impression was of an eclipse or
  loss.</p>

  <p>While the thought flashed across her mind, to her dismay Beatrice walked
  into No. 16.</p>

  <p>"I have an appointment with Goya," she said imperiously. "Naturally I wish
  it to be private. Please stay outside, Greeny, or wait in your apartment.
  I'll join you there."</p>

  <p>Viola bit her lip as she realized that she was up against a complication
  she had hoped would never arise. The situation was delicate, for she had no
  authority to coerce the girl. She had to rely on her command of the personal
  element, and if this broke down, she was powerless.</p>

  <p>"I'll get it in the neck when your people hear of this," she appealed.
  "Have a heart and cut it out."</p>

  <p>"But I've got to go," explained Beatrice. "I must know the future because
  it's connected with you."</p>

  <p>"With me? If you let me down now, I've got no future. I shall never get
  another job."</p>

  <p>Beatrice had already walked halfway towards the table when she turned
  round to face Viola. She laughed with triumph because the positions were
  reversed and she was now on top. In spite of her own annoyance, Viola was
  forced to admire her. At that moment she looked beautiful&mdash;a perfect
  picture of youthful charm. Her dark eyes gleamed with mischief and her cheeks
  flamed with excitement. In her snowy ermine coat and cap, she might have been
  a princess strayed from a Hans Andersen fairy tale.</p>

  <p>"Darling," she said, "you do sob stuff marvelously. But I'm immune to it.
  It is time you realized that I am a free agent&mdash;not a pedigree
  Peke."</p>

  <p>"Miss Green."</p>

  <p>Viola spun round at the sound of Major Pomeroy's voice. He was standing in
  the open door of No, 16 and he still fingered the slip of paper.</p>

  <p>"Some studio or other rang up this morning," he drawled. "They wanted your
  number. I told them I'd have it looked up and we'd ring them later. I'm
  afraid my secretary has been too rushed to attend to it&mdash;I wonder if you
  would care to speak to them yourself. It might be more satisfactory. The
  booth in the hall is free."</p>

  <p>As she listened, Viola felt almost suffocated by excitement. A miracle had
  happened, for the studio actually remembered her. Probably they were casting
  for a new picture and needed girls of her type. There might even be a chance
  of a small part, and if this did not materialize nothing could alter the fact
  she would be once more acting for the screen.</p>

  <p>Having delivered his message, the major transferred his attention to Miss
  Power's blocked wardrobe. Thrilled and elated, Viola was on the point of
  dashing downstairs to the hall, when she remembered Beatrice.</p>

  <p>She had accepted her responsibility. It was impossible to leave her alone
  in a strange house. Even if Mack were left on guard, it would not justify her
  absence, since the terms of her engagement had stipulated for personal
  attendance.</p>

  <p>"Thanks, Major," she called through the open door. "I'll call at your
  office for the number when I'm leaving. Since they have been kept waiting
  already, they can wait a few minutes longer."</p>

  <p>Even as she spoke, she told herself bitterly that her chance was lost. For
  a moment she felt bitter and rebellious; then, with a sudden change of mood,
  regret was wiped out by gratitude that she had not yielded to the treachery
  of her impulse. It was a moral victory which she must consolidate by making a
  more vigorous attempt to influence the mutinous heiress.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," she said.</p>

  <p>As she turned her head, she stared around her in utter incredulity. There
  was no sign of Beatrice anywhere in the room.</p>

  <p>Within the space of a few seconds, she had disappeared is completely as
  though she had faded into air.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19">XIX. &mdash; AN OPENED WINDOW</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT first, Viola felt she was the victim of a monstrous
  practical joke.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," she called, "where are you?" There was no reply and she cried
  out again. As she waited, the silence appalled her. The sound of her own
  voice&mdash;sharp and thin as a twanged wire&mdash;was also alarming. It was
  a reminder that one half of her mind had a perception of some horror which
  was mercifully blurred to the other.</p>

  <p>She looked around her with a dim sense that the situation was familiar.
  This had happened once before in the fading light of just such another foggy
  evening. She remembered how Marlene, the ornamental typist, had spun her a
  preposterous yarn about a girl who had faded out&mdash;and that afterwards,
  she had stretched out her arms in groping gestures, trying to touch someone
  who was not there.</p>

  <p>That had been a piece of foolish acting, yet the present was equally
  unreal. She had a sudden vivid vision of Beatrice, flushed and laughing, in
  her ermine coat&mdash;red and white as a rose thrown upon snow. She was a
  blooming flesh-and-blood reality. It was impossible for her to be reduced to
  an element and imprisoned in the air.</p>

  <p>As she stood and stared out at the landing, her brain seemed to grow
  duller every moment. She heard the ticking of the grandfather's-clock in
  uneven beats, like a heart about to stop, as Miss Power's wardrobe was forced
  from its wedged position. She saw it hoisted and carried down the stairs,
  while the major preceded it as he cautioned the men not to scratch the paint
  on the walls.</p>

  <p>Then Miss Power&mdash;wearing gloves and carrying a suitcase&mdash;came
  out of No. 17, and Mack, who had learned his lesson, jumped clear of the
  door...</p>

  <p>She watched them as though she were the spectator at a drama. Although
  every action seemed to be performed in slow motion, she timed them
  subconsciously as she mechanically counted the ticks of the clock. Within the
  compass of a couple of minutes, something had happened&mdash;something which
  she was still too stunned by shock to comprehend.</p>

  <p>For the present, her sensations were chiefly physical. They frightened her
  because they conveyed a threat. She felt dizzy from the gallop of imprisoned
  blood in her temples and the increasing pressure around her head, as though
  the brain were being locked in quick-setting plaster.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to have a stroke," she thought.</p>

  <p>The terror of the idea stabbed her back to reality and she ran out to the
  landing, screaming for the detective. "Mack, Mack!"</p>

  <p>The Scot, who was leaning against the wall, hastened to meet her.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"She's gone," gasped Viola.</p>

  <p>"Gone? Beatrice?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;disappeared. She's in there somewhere. We must find her."</p>

  <p>Mack&mdash;his eyes like chips of broken glass&mdash;looked through the
  open door into Goya's flat and then rushed heavily towards No. 15.</p>

  <p>"Not there," cried Viola, following him and clinging to his arm in a vain
  effort to wrench him round.</p>

  <p>"Get out, you liar."</p>

  <p>He shook her off with a force which sent her staggering backward as he
  burst open the door.</p>

  <p>As she looked into her flatlet, she felt that she must be dreaming. It was
  rather a dark room as it looked out onto a narrow side street and involved a
  heavy bill for electric light. When she had packed to go to the Stirlings'
  hotel, she had bolted and shuttered her window as a matter of course. She
  expected, therefore, to find the place in darkness... Instead&mdash;the light
  was switched on and the window was wide open.</p>

  <p>Outside was an iron stair which the major had added as a precaution
  against fire. It was wider and easier than the average escape, so the staff
  of the offices sometimes used it as a back way down to the street. Mack was
  on the point of climbing out onto the narrow balcony outside the window when
  Viola made another attempt to stop him.</p>

  <p>"Mack, come back," she screamed. "You must believe me. It's her only
  chance. She is in Goya's flat. There's some terrible trickery."</p>

  <p>"Ring the Stirlings," cut in Mack, his foot on the first rung of the
  stair.</p>

  <p>She had never before seen such cold anger in any face, and she shrank back
  although her conscience was clear. The sensation of being imprisoned in an
  evil dream was so strong that she looked around her, expecting to see
  Beatrice laughing at her bewilderment. Then, suddenly, the, explanation of
  the mystery burst&mdash;like a bomb&mdash;inside her head. Beatrice had been
  kidnapped.</p>

  <p>She tried to reject the hideous thought on the score of impossibility.
  There could be no panel trap where a girl might be hidden, since No. 16 had
  recently been renovated by a builder of proven honesty. But even assuming
  some place of concealment, there remained the problem of forcibly removing a
  strong and active girl without attracting attention.</p>

  <p>While she was talking to Major Pomeroy, she had heard no sound of a cry or
  struggle and no other person had been present except Madame Goya. The fortune
  teller&mdash;who was stout&mdash;was wedged tightly in her armchair and was
  imprisoned there by the barrier of the table. She would have needed the
  collective characteristics of a contortionist, a strong woman and a gymnast
  to have leaped on her victim, disposed of her and returned to her place in
  complete silence.</p>

  <p>"Goya," thought Viola, with a spurt of hope. "She was there. She must have
  seen what happened!"</p>

  <p>When she rushed inside No. 16, Goya was still posed at the table before
  her crystal. As she drew nearer to her, Viola's heart sank, for the woman's
  lids were closed and her chin rested on her chest.</p>

  <p>"Madame."</p>

  <p>At Viola's cry, she nodded violently like a china mandarin and blinked her
  eyes open.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't asleep," she gabbled, with the instinctive defence of one caught
  napping. "I was only resting my eyes while I waited for a client. Crystal
  gazing puts a great strain on them. I don't suppose I am betraying a
  confidence when I say I am expecting your Miss Stirling. You would be sure to
  know... But where is she? Didn't, she come with you? I've not seen her."</p>

  <p>Viola's unspoken question was answered both in words and by Goya's eyes
  which looked blank and dazed. It was unimportant whether she were
  sleep-sodden or obstructive. The fact remained that she was tongue-tied.</p>

  <p>"Do you want anything here?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The question recalled Viola's wandering wits.</p>

  <p>"Your telephone," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Use it by all means."</p>

  <p>Seizing the receiver, Viola heard the operator inquire, "Number,
  please?"</p>

  <p>The request was repeated while she tried desperately to think clearly. But
  her mind remained a blank, so that she was forced to ring off again to her
  dismay.</p>

  <p>"Can't you remember your number?" asked Madame Goya.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Viola. "My brain seems jammed." As she spoke dully, her eyes
  were fixed on the box divan. It was larger and more luxurious than her own,
  so the receptacle underneath&mdash;which held her own bedclothes&mdash;would
  be correspondingly spacious. Too distraught to realize what she was doing,
  she rushed to it, swept off the cushions and raised the lid. Inside was
  stacked a collection of empty stout bottles. "Only 'dead men,'" she murmured.
  Becoming conscious of Goya's protruding eyes, she tried to explain. "I'm
  sorry. But I know she is here." A swarm of bees seemed to be buzzing inside
  her head, but above the maddening humming and the beating of a myriad wings
  she heard Goya speaking slowly and clearly, as though she were trying to
  instruct a mental patient.</p>

  <p>"You came in here to telephone, my dear. But you couldn't remember the
  number. Now suppose you go down to the office? The major will be able to help
  you."</p>

  <p>At the reminder that priceless time was slipping away in ghastly
  misunderstanding and confusion, Viola rushed from the room and tore down the
  stairs. Her ankle was still weak from her accident and&mdash;while still some
  distance from the bottom&mdash;it gave way, so that she fell down the last
  steps. Hearing the crash, Pearce hurried to help her. Unconscious of any
  injury, she limped across the hall to the major's office.</p>

  <p>"Ring the Stirlings," she gasped. "I've forgotten their number. Tell them
  their daughter has disappeared."</p>

  <p>Major Pomeroy's nonchalance was equal to the shock. Without showing
  surprise, he spoke to his secretary. "'Get the Colosseum Hotel, please. Ask
  for either Mr. or Mrs. William Stirling."</p>

  <p>Miss Taylor stopped tapping her noiseless machine and took up her
  telephone. As she watched her, Viola became oppressed with a sense of guilt.
  Her loyalty had stood the test, for the studio call had not made her desert
  her post. Yet, as she waited to speak to Mrs. Stirling, she felt under the
  ban of universal condemnation.</p>

  <p>The office was familiar to her with its red-and-blue Turkey
  carpet&mdash;its deep comfortable chairs and the handsome desk. It connected
  with the major's flat&mdash;which was somewhat cramped&mdash;and he often
  used it in the evening after business-hours. Many a time Viola had sauntered
  inside, her hands stuck negligently in the pockets of her slacks, to make a
  complaint or offer some casual excuse for non-payment of her rent.</p>

  <p>On such occasions, Miss Taylor always dealt with her in order to save the
  major from being worried by his tenants. She was a competent secretary and
  remained coldly impersonal, even when Viola tried to introduce the human
  element. Viola knew that she disliked her and, as she attributed the fact to
  jealousy of her more glamorous profession, she ignored her hostility with
  contemptuous pity.</p>

  <p>The situation was now reversed as, for the first time, she wanted the
  reassurance of Miss Taylor's approval. She started nervously when the
  secretary looked up from her desk and spoke to her:</p>

  <p>"You're through. Will you take the call, please?"</p>

  <p>"No," declared Viola desperately. "No, I can't tell them."</p>

  <p>After a slight pause, the major picked up the receiver. "Is that Mrs.
  Stirling speaking?'" His deferential voice contrasted with a cigarette stuck
  in the corner of his mouth. "This is Major Pomeroy speaking from Pomerania
  House. Will you come over at once? I'm afraid there's bad news about your
  daughter... Thanks."</p>

  <p>He rang off and spoke to his secretary. "More trouble for poor old
  Goya."</p>

  <p>"And for us," Miss Taylor reminded him, with a grimace. They seemed to
  have forgotten Viola's presence. She swayed as she stood, suddenly overcome
  by the delayed effect of her crash down the stairs. Then the walls of the
  room whirled around her and she dropped to the floor in utter collapse...</p>

  <p>Presently intermittent rushes of consciousness returned. She felt that she
  had been away on a long journey, groping in darkness. As she struggled to get
  back, she welcomed faint sounds that were familiar&mdash;a distant telephone
  bell and the hum of voices. At last, with an effort, she managed to open her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>The room seemed to be full of people for she was ringed around with a
  circle of staring faces. In an instinctive attempt to hide from them, she
  closed her lids again.</p>

  <p>"She's shamming," said a voice, vibrant with cold fury.</p>

  <p>"No," declared a kinder tone. "She really took an awful crash. Probably a
  slight touch of concussion. She'd have come out of a faint sooner."</p>

  <p>Viola began to wonder numbly who was the unpopular victim of the casualty
  before she realized that they were talking about her. Head throbbed so
  painfully that it was difficult to control her eyesight, but gradually she
  recognized the Stirlings. The millionaire looked grey as a leaden statue,
  with frozen features and merciless lips. Christina's soft brown eyes were
  glazed with anguish, but when she spoke to Viola her voice was controlled and
  even gentle.</p>

  <p>"Miss Green, can't you make an effort? Try to tell us where Beatrice is.
  Please"</p>

  <p>Beatrice. As Viola remembered what had happened, she was overwhelmed by
  the horror of the moment. Highly emotional and sensitised to impressions, she
  was always swift to snatch at each perception and drain the rapture from a
  sound or a scent. Now this complex nervous machinery was jammed by shock and
  taking its revenge in dislocated nerves.</p>

  <p>While she was trying frantically to answer the appeal of Mrs. Stirling's
  eyes, she felt her faculties begin to slip away again. It was an agony to
  realize that vital time was passing. Beatrice was somewhere in No. 16, and
  they must find her before it was too late. As she struggled to speak, she was
  conscious of a weight inside her mouth as though her tongue were leaden.
  There was failure to concentrate&mdash;a sense of fading away&mdash;and then
  a block of darkness...</p>

  <p>When she recovered consciousness for the second time, a satin cushion was
  placed under her head; a handkerchief soaked in <i>eau de Cologne</i> lay on
  her forehead, and a pungent whiff was in her nostrils. Madame Goya bent over
  her, holding smelling salts to her nose; but instead of being repelled by the
  ugly frog-face&mdash;so close to her own that it looked like a painted
  mask&mdash;she felt grateful for kindness.</p>

  <p>The room was no longer blurred by a quivering mist. She saw every face
  distinctly while her mind had grown clear. The absence of Miss Taylor, and
  the comparative silence in the hall, told her of further leakage of the
  precious time which might yet save Beatrice. The Stirlings, Major Pomeroy and
  Goya were present, while even as she stared around her the door opened and
  Raphael Cross entered.</p>

  <p>"I've only just got your message." he said.</p>

  <p>At the sight of him Viola felt a revival of courage and also of hope. His
  vitality and personal magnetism were so strong that he inspired an atmosphere
  of confidence. Going straight to Christina, he pressed her hands.</p>

  <p>"You know what I feel," he said.</p>

  <p>Her lips quivered, but when she spoke to him her voice was calm.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know, Raphael. Oh, the comfort to have you. But you mustn't be too
  sweet, or I may give way. I've got to concentrate on Beatrice." She added in
  a lower voice, "and I must be strong for two."</p>

  <p>Glancing involuntarily at the stricken millionaire, he nodded in
  understanding.</p>

  <p>"I'm here to help you," he told her.</p>

  <p>Crossing to the divan on which Viola had been placed, he gave her a
  friendly smack.</p>

  <p>"Poor little Greeny." His voice was kind but firm. "You look as if you'd
  taken an awful beating. But don't think of yourself. Think of her... What
  happened?"</p>

  <p>Fortified by his compelling eye, she blurted out her story. It sounded so
  fantastic that she gazed hopelessly at the skeptical faces. "Beatrice ran
  into No. 16 to get her fortune told. I followed. I turned to speak to the
  major, and in that minute she disappeared."</p>

  <p>Chilled by the silence, she appealed to Raphael Cross. "It's true. You've
  got to believe me. For it happened to you. It's the same room. There's some
  horrible trickery about it. You must break it up. Pull everything down."</p>

  <p>Cross' shrug was a disclaimer of responsibility.</p>

  <p>"History repeats itself," he remarked. "I'm afraid this young lady seems
  to have too good a memory. Well, Major, there may be something in it for
  you&mdash;again. Shall we send for the break-up squad?"</p>

  <p>Major Pomeroy ignored the thrust.</p>

  <p>"I should certainly not authorize the destruction of my property a second
  time on a frivolous charge," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>"That goes for me too," declared Madame Goya. "'Once bitten, twice shy.'
  No one shall destroy my beautiful new decorations."</p>

  <p>"The question does not arise," broke in Stirling. "The girl's lying. She
  has been helping my daughter to elope."</p>

  <p>"Whatever's happened," said Cross, "Beatrice is gone and we have to get
  her back. You know what you must do, Stirling. Ring up the police."</p>

  <p>Stirling and his wife stared at each other, their faces drawn with fear.
  Then Christina spoke.</p>

  <p>"No. That terrible photograph... I cannot forget her eyes."</p>

  <p>"But you advised me," Raphael Cross reminded them.</p>

  <p>"And you want me to take my own medicine?" asked Stirling.</p>

  <p>The glint died from Cross' eye.</p>

  <p>"No," he told them. "I want no one to go through the hell I suffered,
  least of all you. It's because of my feeling for you, I want to steer you in
  the right direction. The cases are different. I feared the worst from the
  beginning because of my private knowledge of motives. But if this is a common
  or garden kidnapping&mdash;and not an elopement&mdash;all your own arguments
  stand good. You must call in the police."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20">XX. &mdash; "BY HAND"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RESENTFUL of the injustice which blamed her for the
  catastrophe, Viola made another effort to protest. She was struggling to sit
  up, when stumpy fingers pressed her head down on the cushion again.</p>

  <p>"Lie still," whispered Goya. "What's the good? They won't believe
  you."</p>

  <p>Viola recognized the sound sense of the advice. If she rested, there was
  less chance of her remaining a casualty and, as such, in no condition to
  defend herself. Although she had always distrusted Goya, she felt grateful to
  her because she alone showed any sign of friendly feeling.</p>

  <p>In spite of her innocence, her sense of guilt grew almost unbearable as
  she watched the stricken parents. While they tried to hope that Beatrice's
  absence would prove an escapade, she felt certain that they sensed the menace
  of the dreaded octopus. The millionaire appeared shattered by the blow, but
  his anguish hurt her less than his wife's courage.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't keep up like that," she thought. "I was nearly haywire when I
  lost Peter, and he was only a dog. But she's trying to smile at her husband.
  I played her too low. It wasn't only fur coats&mdash;and orchids&mdash;and
  bridge&mdash;that kept her going. It's real character... I've laughed at all
  of them just because they had too much money. Oh, how cruel the poor are to
  the rich!"</p>

  <p>She was trying to swallow the lump which rose persistently in her throat
  when the door was pushed open and the detective&mdash;Mack&mdash;walked
  inside. His face was damp and greyish&mdash;his movements heavy with the lag
  of a defeated man. Christina ran towards him, but he answered her unspoken
  question with a shake of his head.</p>

  <p>"I've lost the trail," he confessed, running his finger inside his collar
  as though unable to bear its pressure. "She was nowhere in the street. Cars
  were passing all the time through the Square, but the traffic cops spotted
  nothing... But she came down the escape. I checked up on that at one of the
  offices opposite. A clerk went to the window to pull down the blind and he
  saw a girl in a white coat coming down the stairs. It was nearly dark and he
  didn't wait to see where she was going."</p>

  <p>Viola listened with utter bewilderment. She was asking herself by what
  miraculous feat of levitation Beatrice could have moved through solid walls
  to the outer stair, when the detective continued his account.</p>

  <p>"I got on to Don at once and phoned him to contact Austin, himself. He
  seemed our best bet. No good ringing him up to ask and be told lies. If she's
  with him, Don will find her. He's fighting mad."</p>

  <p>"Will he ring up the hotel?" asked Stirling.</p>

  <p>"No, I gave him this number as I reckoned you'd be here... We ought to
  hear any minute now."</p>

  <p>Instinctively&mdash;everyone turned towards the telephone as though
  beseeching it to speak.</p>

  <p>"What happened, Mack?" asked the millionaire.</p>

  <p>"Didn't she tell you?" inquired the detective, jerking his thumb towards
  Viola.</p>

  <p>"I've only heard lies. I want your account."</p>

  <p>"Well, when we got here, we went right up to the landing. Green told me
  they were going to her apartment. I parked outside another door where the
  tenant was moving out, so that I could keep my eye on No. 15. Green began to
  unlock the door and Beatrice stood by her, waiting to go inside. Then my
  attention was taken off by a wardrobe which stuck while they were taking it
  out and I helped to shove it. I saw Beatrice just before I turned
  round&mdash;and the next minute Green screamed out that she had gone. I
  dashed straight into fifteen and found the light on and the window open. I
  went down after her, but I had to climb out onto the balcony to reach the
  stair. All the time, Green was trying to drag me back and make out she was
  somewhere else. She was putting up an act to help Beatrice make her
  getaway."</p>

  <p>Viola listened with a recognition of his personal hostility towards
  herself. When she had first gone to live at the hotel, she had been surprised
  at his use of Beatrice's Christian name. She soon discovered that he was
  privileged on account of his years of loyal service, and that the Stirlings
  were too simple by nature to expect him to give a title to a girl whom he
  still regarded as a baby. Knowing this, she was pleased by the compliment
  when he began to call her "Vi." Now she was "Green," in evidence of her drop
  from favour.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the telephone bell began to ring. Mack was first to answer the
  call&mdash;waving back the parents who pressed around him. His eyes glinted
  with excitement, but as he listened his eagerness died and his mouth sagged
  with disappointment.</p>

  <p>"No," he said&mdash;hanging up the receiver&mdash;"she didn't go to meet
  Austin. Don traced him to a Turkish bath, where he'd been all the afternoon.
  The chap didn't know anything. Don said he was sure he wasn't stalling. He
  went round to Austin's apartment to find out if she was there, but the porter
  said she'd not been seen."</p>

  <p>"Where is Don speaking from?" asked Stirling.</p>

  <p>"From the hotel. He's been checking up on telephone calls. The switchboard
  girl told him Green made a date to have her fortune told by Madame Goya this
  afternoon. She wasn't really listening in, but she heard a bit and she took
  the call from Green's line."</p>

  <p>"This doesn't look too good to me," said Raphael Cross sternly. "I warned
  you on Goya because I know girls can get their heads stuffed with
  suggestions."</p>

  <p>"I never made an appointment," declared Viola.</p>

  <p>"That's right," said Goya. "It wasn't her voice. I'd know hers
  anywhere."</p>

  <p>"She's an actress," the millionaire reminded her. "Surely she could
  imitate any voice."</p>

  <p>"But I didn't," protested Viola. "Besides, Mrs. Stirling gave us
  permission to come here."</p>

  <p>"I gave permission to visit your dramatic school," said Christina wearily.
  "But what's the good of going into this? It doesn't matter if we've been
  deceived and let down. All that matters is to find Beatrice."</p>

  <p>Shaken by her fall and confused by the circumstantial evidence which was
  piling up against her, Viola was beginning to wonder what had actually
  happened when the porter entered the office.</p>

  <p>He held an envelope which he gave to William Stirling. "I've just noticed
  this in the letter box," he explained. "It must have come by hand. I took the
  mail from the postman myself. It's marked 'Urgent,' so the messenger should
  have delivered it personally."</p>

  <p>"That's right, Pearce," said Major Pomeroy quickly. "Mr. Stirling is
  expecting it."</p>

  <p>Almost before the door closed, Cross snatched the letter. "The address is
  printed," he said. "Remember mine?"</p>

  <p>The millionaire's face was frozen with fear&mdash;his lips too stiff to
  speak. Although she was also cold with foreboding, Viola had a vivid
  recollection of the evening when Cross had received his anonymous threat. The
  Stirlings had been genuinely shocked and sympathetic, yet they had viewed the
  situation from an isolationist angle.</p>

  <p>She wondered whether Raphael had a similar memory as he slit open the
  envelope.</p>

  <p>"'My very dears,'" he read. "'Tell Greeny I'm having my adventure. I'm
  kidnapped. Soon you will be told my price. Please pay it if you think I'm
  worth it, and even if you don't. I'm fit and in good spirits, don't worry.
  Back soon.'"</p>

  <p>The silence was broken by Cross. "Do you recognize her handwriting?" he
  asked Christina.</p>

  <p>"It's hers," she said, speaking with an effort.</p>

  <p>"Is it what she would say?"</p>

  <p>"No. She used to tell us never to pay out a dime in ransom for her... We
  hated her talking of it, even in joke. She declared it was unintelligent to
  ignore any subject&mdash;and she used to say a kidnapper rarely kept his
  share of the bargain."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," said Raphael gently, "that she was obliged to write what
  they told her&mdash;only they'd have the sense to let her say it her own way,
  for the sake of the genuine touch."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Christina lost her calm as she pressed the letter to her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Her hand touched it," she said. "It's a sort of link with my precious
  baby."</p>

  <p>Her husband put his arm around her.</p>

  <p>"No object in staying here now," he remarked. "Better get back to the
  hotel and wait."</p>

  <p>His voice held such hopeless grief that Viola felt almost grateful to
  Madame Goya when she created a diversion.</p>

  <p>"One moment, please, all of you. I said I wouldn't have my room broken up
  for a second time... I've changed my mind. If a kidnapping case is going to
  be connected with Pomerania House, then the sooner I'm outside, the better.
  My business won't stand dirt... Major, I give you formal notice that I shall
  leave tomorrow."</p>

  <p>Major Pomeroy raised his brows and shrugged wearily.</p>

  <p>"I need not remind a business woman that you would break your lease," he
  said. "Suppose we talk it over quietly tomorrow morning?"</p>

  <p>"We certainly will&mdash;but I shall not change my mind."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Stirling moved towards the door but turned back to speak to Major
  Pomeroy.</p>

  <p>"We've been a terrible nuisance. I'm so sorry. Thanks&mdash;for
  everything."</p>

  <p>While Viola was admiring a code in which the personal element was subject
  to a sense of consideration of others, Christina asked her a question.</p>

  <p>"Will you return to the hotel with us, Miss Green? Or do you prefer to
  remain here?"</p>

  <p>Her voice&mdash;though toneless&mdash;was kind, but Viola shrank guiltily
  before the pain in her eyes. "Here, please," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"You will come back to the hotel," commanded the millionaire. "How do we
  know you have not been acting in collusion with the gang?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," cried his wife. "I'll never believe that. She knows Beatrice was
  fond of her."</p>

  <p>"She's not cleared of suspicion. Why did she try to stop Mack going after
  Beatrice? Why has she told us a pack of lies?"</p>

  <p>Viola did not feel capable of making another effort to clear herself. As
  she wondered if anyone would believe her preposterous story, she suddenly
  thought of a young man with resolute eyes and a stubborn chin. Alan Foam was
  a fighter, not to be browbeaten by millionaires. The mere idea of getting in
  contact with him revived her courage. He would be able to advise her if he
  could not give her actual help.</p>

  <p>At this juncture, however, she doubted whether she would be allowed to
  make a private telephone call. Someone was certain to listen in,
  when&mdash;in view of the general suspicion&mdash;her appeal to him might be
  construed as evidence of his indirect complicity. She was looking around the
  hall helplessly while she wondered whether she could possibly creep into the
  telephone booth unseen, when the sight of Madame Goya suggested another
  expedient.</p>

  <p>The woman stood at the foot of the staircase, mechanically making up her
  face without the aid of a mirror. She stopped, clubbing on dusky, powder when
  Viola spoke to her in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Madame, I want to telephone privately."</p>

  <p>Goya opened her bag and handed a key to the girl. "Use mine," she
  muttered, smearing her lips with an orange lipstick to conceal their
  movement. "Be sure to lock the door after you."</p>

  <p>"Thanks. You're a real sport, I'm sorry you are going. Good-bye, if we
  don't meet again."</p>

  <p>After a furtive glance at the group in the hall, Goya held out her hand.
  Her heavy over-painted lips quivered and her eyes were mazed with fear. She
  looked like a woman who expected a blow but did not know who would strike
  it.</p>

  <p>"We're neighbours," she said thickly. "We're both in a jam. I hope we both
  of us come out of it all right. Good-bye," Throwing her furs around her and
  drawing down her veil, she walked towards the street door. Moved by an
  impulse she could not understand, Viola stood and watched her until she was
  out of sight...</p>

  <p>The Stirlings were still talking to Major Pomeroy when she drew near the
  group. Her wits sharpened by her need, she framed her request in a cunning
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"May I go up to my flat? I want to find an important letter." She noticed
  that the detective caught Stirling's eye and gave an almost imperceptible
  nod. "That's all right," he said. "Will you give me a light?"</p>

  <p>When Viola handed him her matches, he put the box in his pocket. "I'll be
  smoking a fag at the bottom of the fire escape," he told her. "I want some
  fresh air too."</p>

  <p>Hiding her jubilation with a grimace of annoyance, Viola walked upstairs
  with the lagging step of defeat. When she reached the bend, she hurried as
  quickly as her injured ankle would allow her until she reached No. 16. As she
  had hoped, Mack thought she meant to burn an incriminating paper and then
  give them the slip. Outwitted by his strategy, she was now merely trying to
  save her face. Stepping inside the darkened room, she fumbled for a switch
  and succeeded in lighting one small pendant in the centre of the ceiling. It
  threw only a pencil of illumination on the long room and made it appear eerie
  and unfamiliar.</p>

  <p>As she looked around her nervously, Viola recalled that she was standing
  on the exact spot where Beatrice had stood just before she, disappeared. A
  cloud of questions surged around her&mdash;Where had she gone? How? The
  letter in her handwriting seemed proof that she had contrived some magical
  method of transportation.</p>

  <p>At the thought of the dark laughing eyes, Viola began to gulp.</p>

  <p>"She could have been spoilt and horrid," she reminded herself. "But she
  was sweet and unselfish and generous. I was a damned prig not to take that
  ring. I hurt her... Oh, darling dear, I'd give my life to get you back."</p>

  <p>She was crying bitterly when she reached Madame's work table. Brushing
  away her tears, she memorized Alan's number before she took up the
  telephone.</p>

  <p>The exchange did not reply and took no notice of her repeated rings. She
  listened to intermittent hums and snaps until her impatience mounted to
  fever. It was not only the knowledge that she was keeping the Stirlings
  waiting for her which set her fingers rapping; even more than their
  displeasure she dreaded the risk of interruption before she got in touch with
  Alan.</p>

  <p>As she looked down the length of the large room, it appeared dim and
  strange. Only its centre was illuminated by the thin shaft of light which was
  bluish as daylight streaming through a hole drilled in the ceiling. Walls and
  floor were darkish and seemed to be peopled with shadows which shifted
  vaguely as though one were stalking another.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she discovered that she had grown nervous of her surroundings.
  This submerged fear had been increasing steadily until she realized that she
  dared not linger there alone. The place held a horror. A few hours ago it had
  swallowed a girl.</p>

  <p>She was afraid of what had happened there&mdash;afraid of what might
  happen again. Slamming down the receiver, she began to rush towards the door
  before she stopped&mdash;to stare with incredulous horror. In that second,
  she believed that her imagination was playing an evil trick.</p>

  <p>As she glanced into the clouded confusion of the darkened mirror, she
  thought she saw&mdash;instead of her own reflection&mdash;the face and figure
  of Raphael Cross.</p>

  <p>Even as she recognized him, she remembered that there had been no sounds
  of opening door or footsteps. Turning to look behind her, she saw only the
  empty room. If he had ever stood there, he had faded into air.</p>

  <p>She forced herself to look again into the mirror... The old greyish glass
  reflected only her white face and scared eyes. They held such terror that she
  was frightened of them her nerve crashed utterly and she rushed&mdash;like a
  mad creature&mdash;from the place.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21">XXI. &mdash; MADAME VACATES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was a terrible awakening for Viola the following
  morning. After hours of heavy sleep, she opened her gummed eyes and stared at
  the familiar luxury of her room her head thumped and her throat was parched,
  while the taste in her mouth reminded her of the aftermath of an occasional
  wild party.</p>

  <p>"Was I tight?" Even as she asked herself the question, she suddenly
  remembered that Beatrice was missing.</p>

  <p>After the shock of realization was dulled, her mind began to grope back to
  the events of yesterday. Although the drive from Pomerania House remained a
  blank, she was sure that she had been on the point of collapse when she
  entered the hotel. Some kind and masterful person had insisted that she
  swallowed a drink which was dynamite. After that, she had retained
  consciousness only long enough to flop into bed.</p>

  <p>As her memory continued to unwind further, she had a vague recollection of
  being in Madame Goya's apartment in order to telephone secretly to Alan. It
  was then that something frightened her, but the cause of her alarm was mixed
  up with an incredible looking-glass illusion which must have been a
  dream.</p>

  <p>Weary of straining her mind, she began to wonder whether there had been
  any fresh developments and if the kidnappers had got in touch with their
  victim's parents. Although she shrank from the ordeal of meeting the
  Stirlings, she got out of bed and began to dress. Instead of bracing her, the
  shower only revived her to a pitch of apprehension when she dreaded all news.
  She stood for some time outside the royal suite, listening to the muted sound
  of voices and trying to summon courage to enter. In the end, a chambermaid
  who was busy about the rooms officiously opened the door of the boudoir for
  her before she could protest.</p>

  <p>Her first glance at the Stirlings gave her the impression that they had
  sloughed their personalities, so that nothing remained but hollow externals.
  The millionaire looked shrivelled as a mummy as he slumped in his padded
  chair; only his eyes were alive and glittering with resentful anguish.</p>

  <p>Christina wore a charming housecoat of stiff hydrangea-blue brocade. Her
  complexion was restored, her hair reset; yet she reminded Viola of something
  dumped upon a refuse heap.</p>

  <p>It was a relief to turn to Raphael Cross, who had made an early call.
  Although his intensely blue eyes betrayed a certain strain, his vitality made
  him appear doubly real and refreshing in contrast with the others.</p>

  <p>Viola moistened her lips and tried to speak but the words died in her
  throat. Cross nodded a greeting while the millionaire glared at her.
  Christina was first to answer the appeal of her eyes.</p>

  <p>"No," she said. "Nothing... Still waiting."</p>

  <p>Cross bit savagely on his cigar.</p>

  <p>"Part of the system to put you through the hoop," he said. "You should
  know. You've got to stay put. The demand will come&mdash;as it came for
  me."</p>

  <p>The millionaire clenched and unclenched his fingers. "If I could only
  contact them," he growled. "I'd let them know there's no limit. No limit. We
  only want her back,"</p>

  <p>Viola noticed the steely glint in Cross' eyes and she wondered if the
  memory of Evelyn still rankled.</p>

  <p>"No limit might suit the interested parties," he remarked harshly. "But
  you've got to face up to this. Beatrice might know too much to be turned
  loose again. She's not an infant that can't tell its story to the press.
  She's far too intelligent to be fooled."</p>

  <p>"But they could keep her from knowing where she was taken," said
  Christina&mdash;her eyes piteous as though she were pleading with Cross for
  hope. "They could blindfold her and never let her see their faces. They could
  disguise their voices. Remember, they are strangers to her."</p>

  <p>"If they are strangers, there's a chance," Cross told her. "But we can't
  rule out the possibility that she knows them&mdash;or one of them. The thing
  was worked too easily... I've a hunch it is someone she had accepted but not
  really noticed&mdash;like a servant. Or it might be someone she knew and
  trusted too well to suspect."</p>

  <p>As Christina stared at him blankly, he took her hand.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, "you must call in the police. They could get some line
  on her. Someone, besides that clerk, must have seen a girl in an ermine coat.
  It might give some indication of whereabouts she was snatched."</p>

  <p>A quiver passed over her face. "No," she declared, "I dare not."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Stirling raised his head and looked at Viola. "Someone she
  trusted," he repeated.</p>

  <p>The implied accusation goaded Viola to explode.</p>

  <p>"If you mean me," she cried, "it's a monstrous lie. I loved Beatrice. But
  it's no good telling you. I demand justice. I must talk to someone outside
  all this, just to clear my mind. I'm telling a tale I can't believe myself.
  Yet it's true... I want to see Alan Foam."</p>

  <p>"You've met him," explained Cross, to freshen the Stirlings' memories,
  "The private dick I put on to find Evelyn. No good at all."</p>

  <p>"But I must see him," insisted Viola.</p>

  <p>"You can see him here," conceded Stirling. "Don will put through your
  call."</p>

  <p>As Viola was turning to go, Christina spoke to her in a gentle voice.</p>

  <p>"Have you had breakfast, Miss Green?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Viola.</p>

  <p>"Then go down to the restaurant at once."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't."</p>

  <p>"She has," interposed Cross, nodding towards Christina.</p>

  <p>His curt tone checked her rising hysteria.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," she muttered. "I didn't mean to dramatize myself. Of course, I'll
  go."</p>

  <p>A little later when she was trying to eat grapefruit, Don brought her a
  message from Foam. The young man's eyes were sunken from loss of sleep and
  his voice was surly.</p>

  <p>"Your chap can give you ten minutes. Coming over now. I warn you, don't
  talk secrets. I may be snooping round."</p>

  <p>The change in the friendly college boy made Viola uneasy lest Foam should
  regard her with the epidemic suspicion. Unable to finish her breakfast, she
  went up to her sitting room. When she heard his step outside the door, she
  tried to assume a pose of jaunty unconcern, but she was handicapped by the
  fact that she had no trouser pockets. She was stuffing a cigarette into her
  holder when he came into the room.</p>

  <p>She puckered up her lips to whistle&mdash;only to forget her gesture as
  she met his gaze his eyes gave her reassurance of her hope that he would be
  on her side, trusting her and caring for her. To her dismay, her defiance
  broke down as, flinging her arms around his neck, she began to sob upon his
  shoulder. Then, just as he was exulting in the knowledge that he held her in
  his arms, she pushed him away.</p>

  <p>"Fool," she said. "I never thought I'd play ivy to your oak. I hate ivy.
  Filthy clinging stuff... Oh, daring dear, I'm in a fearful mess. But you'll
  never believe my tale."</p>

  <p>"Spit it out."</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a dentist&mdash;and an honest man. Well, here goes."</p>

  <p>As she rushed into her story, she watched Foam's face closely his eyes
  glinted with sudden excitement when he heard of Beatrice's disappearance, but
  otherwise they remained remote and thoughtful. When she stopped, she
  challenged him fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe me?"</p>

  <p>"I should," he replied. "That stuff is too thin and snarled for your
  imagination. You could put over a better line... honestly, I'm desperately
  sick about Beatrice. Nice kid. No side."</p>

  <p>As he recalled the lunch at the Savoy, he forgot the beating he had taken
  over politics while he remembered the heiress youthful freshness&mdash;her
  open appreciation of ice pudding and her shy adoration of Viola.</p>

  <p>"Is there any hope of getting her back?" asked Viola.</p>

  <p>'"Depends," he replied. "If she's been grabbed by a professional gang,
  it's not too good, especially as her people won't call in the police. They're
  playing a mug's game. But it's natural that Cross' experience should shake
  them up... On the other hand, if there's a conspiracy connected with
  Pomerania House&mdash;where the show started&mdash;the parties concerned will
  have to stay put and carry on as usual&mdash;If they bolted, they would give
  away the show. In such a case, her people might get her back."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"If they could prove suspicious conduct on the part of anyone, that person
  is bound to link up with others. This can't be a one-man job, and they must
  all hang together. As a matter of fact, I've never been quite satisfied with
  that first affair."</p>

  <p>"You mean the shoes in the clock-case?"</p>

  <p>"Intelligent girl... Yes, those and some other points. Wait for me to
  throw them into shape."</p>

  <p>Foam alternatively frowned and scrawled in his notebook. When the list of
  his findings was complete, he read it out to Viola.</p>

  <p>"First, Evelyn Cross asked Pearce to light her fag. An old dodge to ensure
  recognition. Why?</p>

  <p>"Second, the carpet and suite in No. 16 and No. 17 were exactly alike.
  Those in your flat were of inferior quality. Why?</p>

  <p>"Third, you told me you noticed a difference in No. 16, and you think it
  was a lack of colour. That might mean that you were subconsciously missing a
  few of Goya's brilliant rugs and cushions. Why?</p>

  <p>"Fourth, a girl in a white coat was noticed on the outside stair. Not
  conclusive evidence because one of the typists&mdash;Marlene&mdash;has a
  white coat."</p>

  <p>Foam stopped to ask a question. "Sure you're keeping nothing back?"</p>

  <p>"Just one thing," confessed Viola. "I had a fright last night when I went
  into No. 16 to ring you up. For one horrible second I thought I saw Raphael
  Cross in the mirror."</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Foam did not hoot with derision.</p>

  <p>"Looking glass," he muttered, "That's rather suggestive. Two rooms that
  are identical in certain respects. It gives the idea of duplication... I wish
  this were my case. It might be interesting. But I must go."</p>

  <p>After glancing at his watch, he turned to Viola and tilted her chin.</p>

  <p>"That's the way to wear it," he said, "And tell Cross, from me, to
  persuade the Stirlings not to pay any ransom. That would prove fatal for
  Beatrice."</p>

  <p>Viola clutched him in a stranglehold before he reached the door.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you going to help us?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"What can I do?" he asked. "I'm on the outside."</p>

  <p>"But I'm in it up to the neck. Beatrice was in my care when she vanished.
  I can never be happy again&mdash;never. Well, I must snoop round alone. I've
  heard danger is sweet."</p>

  <p>As she expected, Foam collapsed at the threat. "You win," he said. "Since
  you've hired me, I'll go to Pomerania House and nose round for any alteration
  in the landscape."</p>

  <p>"At once, my precious?"</p>

  <p>"No, my priceless. I'm on an important case&mdash;and the firm's interests
  must come first&mdash;I'll pay that visit when I out to lunch."</p>

  <p>"It may be too late."</p>

  <p>In spite of her former eagerness to speed him on his way he had to wrench
  his oak from the clinging embrace of the ivy. Once he was back in the office,
  his legitimate business occupied him until nearly two o'clock he rammed on
  his hat, ready to start, when he remembered his memory trap&mdash;the
  notebook in which he had entered his first impressions of those connected
  with the alleged disappearance of Evelyn Cross.</p>

  <p>As he glanced at the pages, he grimaced and muttered "Lousy." It looked
  barren of promise until he noticed that a comment he had made on Viola might
  bear indirectly on a psychological aspect of the mystery. Then, as he checked
  his latest memory of Miss Power with the written description, he found the
  comparison inaccurate because he had used the adjective "solid."</p>

  <p>Forcing his memory backwards, he saw again the perfectly moulded tweed
  suit with rounded hips and padded shoulders. Yet the last time he had met
  Power in Pomerania House, her lines had been spare and her costume had not
  defined her figure.</p>

  <p>"Diet?" he queried. "Worry? Illness? Or&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Acting on impulse, he rang up Viola.</p>

  <p>"Has Power lost weight recently?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No." Viola's voice was puzzled. "She's always been the same build. One of
  Pharaoh's lean kine."</p>

  <p>"Then would you call her tweed outfit a perfect fit?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be silly. It bags and sags. Evidently cut to allow for
  shrinking,"</p>

  <p>Suddenly it struck Foam as significant that Power had remained in her room
  during the excitement on the landing, so that Viola had not seen her on that
  occasion.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said. "The first time I met Miss Power, her suit fitted her
  like a sausage skin. Does that suggest anything?"</p>

  <p>"Is this an intelligence test? Was she wearing one suit over another?"</p>

  <p>"Bright girl. And the inference?"</p>

  <p>"I'm stumped this time. What?"</p>

  <p>"It might be impersonation."</p>

  <p>Foam could almost feel the vibration of Viola's excitement across the
  wire.</p>

  <p>"Are you telling me that the clerical Power is a crook?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"No, we mustn't jump to conclusions. Perhaps she feels the cold. All the
  same, I'm going over to Pomerania House before I eat. I've a hunch I shall
  find something there&mdash;and if I do&mdash;an explanation will be
  indicated. One person should be forced to incriminate another from
  self-interest, and we may learn the truth about Beatrice."</p>

  <p>"Oh,&mdash;hurry&mdash;hurry."</p>

  <p>Her tone was so vehement that she imparted her own sense of urgency to
  Foam. Taking a taxi, he drove to Pomerania House. Directly he entered the
  hall, he noticed signs of removal&mdash;footmarks smudged on the rubber
  flooring and wads of packing paper on the stairs. Pearce was clearing up the
  litter, so the major&mdash;immaculate as usual&mdash;came to meet him.</p>

  <p>"Anything I can do for you?" he inquired nonchalantly.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I might have a look at No. 16," asked Foam. "If Madame Goya
  has no objection, of course."</p>

  <p>"Madame will not object because Madame has evacuated herself. Broken her
  lease and cleared out her stuff this morning. Lucky break for me. I've been
  snowed under with inquiries for office accommodation of late. Now I intend to
  gut those three flats and convert them into business premises. Two are empty
  and I can shift little Miss Green."</p>

  <p>His confident air in conjunction with the word "gut" made Foam plug his
  request.</p>

  <p>"Might I see what is proposed? I'm always egging my firm to move to more
  convenient offices."</p>

  <p>"Pleasure, my dear chap. I'm always ready to explain my plans to
  prospective clients. Conversion is my hobby as well as my business. Morgan is
  up there already, getting the first rough idea."</p>

  <p>When they reached the landing, the builder stamped to meet them. His
  bowler hat was pushed back, revealing a bushy forelock which was whitened
  with coarse powder. His coat was also covered with grit, but in spite of his
  untidy appearance he beamed with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"I reckon this house will be my O.A.P., chief," he said. "Cor lumme,
  there's a chronic fall of plaster. I warned you that the division wall was
  too thin to bear any weight."</p>

  <p>"Which wall?" asked Foam, with a premonition of defeat.</p>

  <p>"One between 16 and 17," replied the builder. "Come and see."</p>

  <p>They followed him into No. 16, where a jagged oblong hole gaped in the
  division wall. The pile of fragments on the floor told Foam that the job had
  been well and truly done.</p>

  <p>"How did it happen?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Taking down the mirror," explained the major. "I warned Madame against
  fixing it there. It was twice the weight of her old one."</p>

  <p>Foam grinned sourly as he remembered the ease with which he had lifted the
  gilded fraud. Although the major could not know they shared a secret, it was
  a barren victory in the absence of proof.</p>

  <p>"Was the mirror smashed too?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, luckily it escaped damage."</p>

  <p>As Foam stared at the gap, his disappointment was heavy. He had believed
  he was about to make an exposure of villainy, but he was too late.</p>

  <p>With the destruction of the evidence, it was impossible to prove his
  suspicion that Beatrice&mdash;like "Alice"&mdash;had stepped through the
  looking glass.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22">XXII. &mdash; DRIVE TO SAFETY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MADAME GOYA was afraid.</p>

  <p>That in itself was strange&mdash;for she did not lack courage. Stranger
  still was the fact that she was afraid of a man. Strangest of all was the
  origin of her fear&mdash;a reference to herself as "the old girl."</p>

  <p>During a sordid career of blackmail and bucket-shop activity, her life had
  been threatened more than once, but she had never found herself up against a
  situation she could not control. She prided herself on the possession of a
  masculine brain plus an expert knowledge of crooked finance with which to
  floor heckling shareholders. Added to this consciousness of power was a lack
  of moral scruple and a supreme contempt of greedy suckers. Now, for the first
  time, she was afraid of her own business associate whom she had formerly
  despised. The murder of Evelyn Cross had revealed his cruel and ruthless
  purpose, and from that time onward she had conceived an increasing terror of
  his muscular hands.</p>

  <p>She had gone into the scheme with some misgiving. Kidnapping was not her
  line of country, besides being highly speculative, as it was impossible to
  count upon pulling in the ransom. It promised, however, such a swollen return
  for her outlay that in the end her cupidity won.</p>

  <p>Because it was her money that financed the venture, she had been arrogant
  and confident. She looked upon it as one more shady transaction until,
  suddenly, it ramified into crime. The murder had not been included in the
  original schedule and made her wonder whether she were being treated as a
  guinea pig who paid her own fees.</p>

  <p>When she overheard the contemptuous allusion to herself, she told herself
  that her foreboding was justified. Instead of sitting in her usual place at
  the top of the board table, she was merely one of the suckers&mdash;"the old
  girl" who had found the money. Her function was fulfilled.</p>

  <p>On the evening when Beatrice disappeared from Pomerania House, she was too
  overwrought to wait for her hired car to bring her back to her apartment in
  St. John's Wood. As she shivered in a taxi, she kept her eyes fixed on the
  meter, hailing each advance in fare as another stage of her journey farther
  from danger. It was with a sense of reaching the safety of port that she
  entered the cheerful entrance hall of the mansion flats.</p>

  <p>When she reached her apartment, her faithful slave had been listening for
  her step and was waiting to open the door.</p>

  <p>Maudie was an elderly wizened blonde, with sharp, peering eyes and
  triangular patches of rouge on her cheek bones. In defiance of her age, she
  wore the short-skirted uniform of a chambermaid in a French farce.</p>

  <p>She took charge of her agitated mistress, fussing over the huge woman like
  a mother cat tending her half-drowned kitten. She fortified her with brandy
  and listened to the outpouring of her suspicions and fears, as she peeled off
  her outdoor clothes. Soon Goya lay stretched on a divan, her feet in
  feathered mules and a cigar between her lips.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to stay put, Maudie," she remarked, looking around at the stuffy
  luxury of her flat. "I'm safe here."</p>

  <p>Maudie perched herself on a table and crossed her bony silken knees as she
  lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"You've got the rats," she said. "That's right, Maudie. It doesn't make
  sense not to finish the job. If it breaks all right, and if I don't get
  pulled in, I'll retire and we'll go and live in Paris."</p>

  <p>"See me dance the can-can," chanted Maudie. As she displayed her lingerie
  in a dance calculated to cheer her mistress, Madame laughed shrilly. She
  changed into a smart dinner gown and had an expensive meal in the restaurant.
  Afterwards she sat in the entrance lounge, listening to the wireless music
  and watching the television.</p>

  <p>When she went up to her flat, she was her normal self. She looked on and
  jeered when Maudie insisted on searching the flat before locking the windows
  and doors.</p>

  <p>"You'd better be armed," she advised, when she tucked up Goya in her bed.
  "You'll dream sweeter if you know your little friend-in-need is just under
  your head."</p>

  <p>"You silly faggot."</p>

  <p>It was not a pistol that Maudie slipped under the large frilled pillow,
  but a bottle. Madame's eyesight was not good enough for her to use a gun
  while Maudie had been raised in a razor-slashing district&mdash;in order to
  compromise with social values, she had introduced her mistress to the refined
  weapon of vitriol.</p>

  <p>In spite of the precaution, Madame passed a miserable night. When she lay
  awake, she imagined that someone was trying to get in at the window&mdash;and
  when she slept, she dreamed that he had got inside. There followed
  developments which awoke her in a sweat of terror and made her heart inflate
  and tug like a captive balloon.</p>

  <p>When Maudie brought in her morning chocolate, she was in a state bordering
  on nervous prostration.</p>

  <p>"Maudie," she whispered, "this flat's not safe."</p>

  <p>"Safe as clink," declared the woman. "People all around."</p>

  <p>"And there are verandas all round too. They join up. Anyone could get
  in."</p>

  <p>"Well, anyone can get out, if it comes to that. 'We'll move to a hotel
  today."</p>

  <p>"No. Hotels aren't safe. People coming and going a the time."</p>

  <p>"Do you fancy the country?" asked Maudie patiently.</p>

  <p>"The country?" Madame screamed faintly. "Fields and trees. They'd give me
  the jitters... No, I'll have to stay put."</p>

  <p>As the morning advanced, she regained control over her nerves by the tonic
  of routine. When her hired car called at the usual time, she was cheered by
  the sight of the chauffeur&mdash;Cromer&mdash;who was detailed to drive her.
  He was a burly man, and his broad back always inspired her with confidence
  while it advertised the fact that his coat was tight to bursting point.</p>

  <p>"Call back for me in an hour," she told him when the car reached Pomerania
  House.</p>

  <p>Despite her leaping heart, she sailed into the hall in her usual grand
  manner; but, instead of going upstairs, she went into the office. The little
  secretary, who was opening the mail, looked up&mdash;expectant of
  trouble.</p>

  <p>"Kindly tell Major Pomeroy I am leaving this morning,"' announced
  Madame.</p>

  <p>"Won't you reconsider your decision?" asked the secretary. "There's
  nothing in the papers about what&mdash;what happened yesterday. Even Pearce
  knows nothing about it. I'm sure there will be no publicity."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, my arrangements are made. The van is due to remove my furniture.
  Where is Pearce?"</p>

  <p>The major, who stood outside listening for his cue, sauntered into the
  office he explained that the porter was in the basement, looking for a fault
  in the electric light plant, and then expressed regret at losing a
  satisfactory tenant.</p>

  <p>Within half an hour the farce was finished. The removal van arrived
  punctually, and the men were directed to No. 16 by the major. After the
  furniture had been run outside in record time&mdash;and a crash had been duly
  recorded for the benefit of inquisitive ears&mdash;Goya walked into the
  office and laid down her key.</p>

  <p>As she did so, she felt a lightening of her spirit.</p>

  <p>"Will you leave a forwarding address?" asked the secretary.</p>

  <p>"You have it. St. John's Wood."</p>

  <p>Goya waited outside the house for her car with a sense of relief.
  Anticipating her freedom, she stared arrogantly at the major when he rejoined
  her.</p>

  <p>"Let me know any change of address," he whispered.</p>

  <p>"If any&mdash;you will be informed," she told him. "If you think I shall
  fade out of the directory just when I'm expecting my dividends, you're
  sanguinary sanguine."</p>

  <p>Her good spirits were soon flawed. When she entered the hall of the
  mansion flats, the tenants were discussing a recent tragedy. For some
  reason&mdash;as yet obscure&mdash;the lift had crashed from the third floor
  to the bottom of the shaft and an elderly lady had been killed.</p>

  <p>When she heard of the accident, Madame was chiefly curious to obtain any
  gruesome details. Her sympathy for the victim was expressed in conventional
  eye-rolling and lip-pursing. It was not until the daylight was fading that it
  suddenly assumed a sinister significance.</p>

  <p>Major Pomeroy's secretary rang up Madame's number. Maudie answered the
  call and returned to Madame, giggling with excitement.</p>

  <p>"Heard the latest comic?" she asked. "You're a stiff, did I laugh?"</p>

  <p>She was explaining that the news of the lift accident had reached
  Pomerania House through a porter who knew Pearce and that it was assumed that
  Madame was the victim on account of her age and foreign name, when she
  noticed that her mistress' lower jaw was wobbling.</p>

  <p>"Maudie," she said hoarsely, "they thought it was me because it was meant
  for me. That lift was fixed,"</p>

  <p>"Don't act silly," argued Maudie. "They can't try no tricks with me
  standing by with me razor. I haven't lost me slice."</p>

  <p>"You're a fool. I daren't stay here. That girl was bumped off in a flat.
  She knew too much. I know more."</p>

  <p>"If you aren't a good girl, I'll put you across me knee. Lie down and get
  some shut-eye."</p>

  <p>After the devoted shrimp had tugged and hoisted the big woman up on the
  ornate bed, Madame began gradually to relax under the influence of warmth and
  comfort. Released from rubber confinement, she wore a wrapper while her
  stockinged feet rested against a hot-water bag. Around her was the assurance
  of her familiar luxury&mdash;her thick carpet and brocade hangings.</p>

  <p>She had begun to doze when she was awakened by a sound at the window.
  Starting up, she was in time to see a man's head duck below the sill. Her
  shriek brought Maudie scampering to her bedside.</p>

  <p>"My goodness, my Guinness, what's wrong now? Got foot-and-mouth
  disease?"</p>

  <p>"A man outside," panted Goya. "On the veranda."</p>

  <p>"Only the window cleaner."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;him. I thought it was a man."</p>

  <p>As though the shock had jolted her brain, she suddenly smote her head in
  dramatic fashion.</p>

  <p>"Maudie, I've just thought of a hide-out. Honeysuckle lodge. I'll ring up
  Abe and Elsa. Get their number."</p>

  <p>After some animated conversation over the telephone, she told Maudie to
  pack a suitcase. Already she felt a foretaste of security. Honeysuckle Lodge
  was not a country cottage but an ultra-modern residence. During a sensational
  career, the master of the house had acquired too many enemies to sleep
  soundly at night without the protection of every burglar-proof device.
  Combined with high encircling walls, electric wires and savage dogs, the
  place was impregnable as a fortress.</p>

  <p>"Good old Abe said 'Come at once,'" she beamed. "He knows what it is to be
  on the spot. There's no room for you because Elsa's got a lot of
  company."</p>

  <p>Maudie did not share her enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," she hinted darkly. "You're safe so long as you stay in
  your hole. They know you're safe so they scare you into thinking they've got
  you trapped. They're only waiting for you to bolt, to get you."</p>

  <p>Madame only laughed at the philosophy of threat and ordered Maudie to ring
  up the garage.</p>

  <p>"Say it must be my usual driver."</p>

  <p>While she waited for the car she rang up Pomerania House and gave her
  change of address to the office. She had sunk too much money not to keep in
  touch with her associates, while she knew she would be invulnerable to attack
  once she had driven through the gates of Honeysuckle Lodge.</p>

  <p>Darkness had fallen when she started on her journey. As the car began to
  move, she looked back. Maudie's little pitted eyes were screwed tightly,
  while tears roiled down the shrivelled, rouged cheeks. It struck her
  unpleasantly as a bad start.</p>

  <p>She felt in a fever of impatience now that she was actually on her way to
  safety. Although she suffered from dromophobia&mdash;the dread of travelling
  at high speed&mdash;she wanted to scorch through built-in areas and crash
  light signals. She shut her eyes and sat rigidly upright, only glancing
  occasionally through the window to check her progress.</p>

  <p>Kensington slipped behind, Hammersmith blended into Chiswick and the car
  swung round the bend into the Great West Road. The coloured illuminations of
  the modern factories quivered through her lids whenever she blinked; but
  presently the avenues of electric globes were sliced by alternate groves of
  darkness. The alternations of glare and shadow were a welcome indication that
  they were gradually working towards open country where they could increase
  the pace.</p>

  <p>Presently the chauffeur stopped the car before a garage. '"Won't keep you
  a minute, mum," he said.</p>

  <p>As she waited, Madame began to grow drowsy after her broken night. She
  drew the rug higher and relaxed her stiff limbs. Feeling safe for the first
  time, she tried to sleep when the car restarted her head drooped lower and
  her thoughts were clouded. Some undercurrent of blurred consciousness made
  her aware of acceleration, and she rejoiced at the knowledge that she was
  rolling nearer to her fortress.</p>

  <p>Presently they passed through Slough when she opened her eyes, responsive
  to the flicker of the bright lights in the street. Refreshed by her nap, she
  began to take an interest in the shop windows and the people passing on the
  pavement. Then&mdash;suddenly&mdash;as she glanced at the chauffeur, she felt
  a chill.</p>

  <p>This was not the familiar back behind which she had sat so often. The
  livery was the same colour&mdash;bottle green-but the coat had no strained
  seams. It fitted its wearer and appeared to be new.</p>

  <p>Instantly her mind began to race with terror as she remembered the stop at
  the garage. She had not opened her eyes when the chauffeur returned, so had
  not seen his face. It was possible for her loyal driver to be detained by a
  trick while someone else took his place... The powerful back, the bull-neck
  and the massive shoulders in front reminded her of the associate from whom
  she was fleeing. At the thought of him, her imagination flared up to remind
  her of Maudie's foreboding that she was being lured from the safety of her
  hole.</p>

  <p>She opened her lips instinctively&mdash;only to realize that she was too
  numbed with shock to scream, A yell like a steam siren was essential to make
  herself audible above the din of the traffic, while she could only splutter
  and gasp. The car was travelling too fast for her to jump out without injury,
  and she dared not attract the mystery driver's attention by hammering on the
  windowpane.</p>

  <p>"Keep calm, you mug," she told herself. "It's Cromer in new livery. I must
  think back&mdash;remember what he wore when he called for me."</p>

  <p>But, although she strained her memory, all she could recapture was a
  mental picture of the tearful Maudie.</p>

  <p>"The old girl knew. Never seen her sloppy before... Well, better get it
  over. Speak to him. Make him turn round."</p>

  <p>But what then? If she saw the face she dreaded, the man could be there for
  one purpose only. The substitution was proof of deliberate design. By forcing
  his hand, she would only precipitate her own fate.</p>

  <p>The lights grew infrequent as they began to run clear of the town. The
  need for action reminded her that she must use her best weapon&mdash;her
  woman's craft. Accustomed to lying her way out of tight corners, her tricky
  brain swiftly suggested a ruse.</p>

  <p>She opened her bag and drew out a picture post card she had received as
  she was leaving. She had retained it for the sake of the address. Trusting
  that the darkness would hide the fact that it had been through the post
  before, she nerved herself to lean forward.</p>

  <p>"Cromer," she said, dropping the card on the seat beside him, "just pop
  this into the next pillar box."</p>

  <p>"Yes, mum."</p>

  <p>The hoot of a passing lorry almost drowned his voice, but she had expected
  it to be disguised. Again she stared at the groomed grey hair visible under
  the cap and the powerful neck. They revealed nothing of the identity of the
  driver. Cromer&mdash;or the other? It might be either.</p>

  <p>As their headlights picked up the scarlet gleam of a pillar box upon the
  semi-country path, she felt breathless with suspense, although she
  anticipated that he would stop, so as not to arouse her suspicion. This road
  was not propitious for his purpose. He would need a quieter place&mdash;off
  the main road&mdash;to carry out his program effectively.</p>

  <p>Opening the door, he leaped from the car and began to walk towards the
  pillar box. Instantly she clambered over to his vacant seat&mdash;her flabby
  muscles galvanized by the driving force of fear. Gripping the wheel, she
  extended the car to sixty miles an hour.</p>

  <p>Her inhibition forgotten, a sense of power filled her as the hedges flew
  past. Fortunately, the road was straight and free from traffic, for her
  myopia did not permit her a driver's license, and she steered by luck only.
  She knew she was near the turning down to the river, where it was spanned by
  a private wooden bridge which led up to the lodge gates of Honeysuckle
  Lodge.</p>

  <p>Feeling herself already within the fortress, she recognized the white
  finger post pointing down the lane. As she plunged into the darkness she saw
  the lights over the bridge shining through seasonal vapour. Their reflections
  quivered in the river and guided her through the final yards of her
  descent.</p>

  <p>Suddenly she felt a tremendous jar, as though the car were an armoured
  tank crushing over an obstacle. It reared forward&mdash;and then dived
  steeply downward. In a moment of incredulous horror, she saw a sheet of water
  spreading over the glass. In the light of the lamp it appeared the colour of
  clear ale, but as she watched it, it swiftly deepened through shades of dun
  and brown to blackness...</p>

  <p>Before the car was entirely submerged, a motorist who had scorched along
  the route earlier in the evening&mdash;removed the decoy lamps and threw the
  posts into the river before he re-lit the lamps on the bridge&mdash;a dozen
  yards farther on.</p>

  <p>At the same time, Cromer&mdash;wearing his new uniform&mdash;was trying to
  hitch-hike back to town, after being stranded&mdash;the prank of an eccentric
  woman.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23">XXIII. &mdash; RANSOM</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE tragedy was reported in the second editions of the
  morning papers under the heading "RIVER FATALITY.". As the identity of the
  victim was established by her car, Foam pounced upon the paragraph. While he
  was reading it, he pondered its significance.</p>

  <p>"Goya blotted out. Seems to suggest a methodical organization. Consumes
  its own smoke as it operates, and no use for spare parts."</p>

  <p>He had no time for further speculation. His firm was collecting material
  for a divorce action which, owing to complications&mdash;plus the exalted
  rank of their client&mdash;exacted the utmost delicacy of approach. Moreover,
  in the absence of any official status, he regarded his promise to Viola as a
  sentimental surrender rather than a practical offer of help.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Viola had read the account of the accident with a shock of
  horror. She tried to feel compassion for the drowned woman, but her honesty
  would not let sentiment cloud her final judgment.</p>

  <p>"Wonder what made her drive by night," she thought. "She always had a
  chauffeur. Perhaps it was a secret blackmailing visit. Well, she was decent
  to me, but only once. No use blinking the fact she put on a stinking
  show."</p>

  <p>Her interest was dulled by suspense as the hours crawled by without
  further communication from Beatrice. She had the sense of being gagged and
  ear-plugged, drifting in a blinding fog through an iceberg zone. With the
  exception of Christina, everyone looked at her with cold hostility and
  avoided speaking to her. Although she agonized to join in their discussions,
  she was kept outside the Stirling circle.</p>

  <p>She was lingering near the royal suite a little after three o'clock, when
  Don came charging down the corridor. She caught a glimpse of something white
  in his hand and dashed after him to the apartment. As she paused in the
  doorway, she saw the millionaire swoop down on the letter like a famished
  gull.</p>

  <p>"It's her writing," he said in a high, cracked voice.</p>

  <p>He jagged the envelope open in a nervous zig-zag, but even in that moment
  of stress, he resected his wife's reserved occupation of official news
  announcer. Mechanically he handed her the letter.</p>

  <p>She read it aloud in a low, rapid voice.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Precious people, they want Mummy's diamonds. The entire
  collection. Take them out of their cases and put them in a bag. At five
  o'clock today, order a taxi to be called from the rank. Your messenger must
  tell the taximan to take the Great West Road, turning off at the first
  by-road after Staines. He must then drive very slowly until he sees a car
  coming towards him. If it dips its lights twice as a signal, he must stop.
  The messenger must get out and hand the bag through the window of the car,
  which will slacken speed.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The next part is very important. The taxi must wait ten
  minutes before returning to London, don't take the number of the car for its
  plate will be changed at once. The messenger must not be connected with the
  police or any detective agency. Neither Don nor Mack must come, don't make
  any attempt at an ambush or follow the car, for the taxi will be under
  constant observation. The gang is large and powerful and will cover any move
  you make. The taxi must be chosen haphazard from the rank, and there must be
  no collusion between the messenger and the driver.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Darlings, keep cool heads and follow these directions
  implicitly. It's deadly important to me. I want to come back to you so very
  much. Make no mistake&mdash;these people mean business. They want the
  diamonds. They tell me to write this. Remember Evelyn Cross.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Till we meet&mdash;all my love. <span class=
  "smcap">Beatrice</span>."</p><br>

  <p>In the silence that followed, Stirling picked up the letter.</p>

  <p>"Her handwriting is steady," he said proudly. "They've not broken her
  courage."</p>

  <p>As Viola looked at the bold characteristic strokes, she was suddenly
  reminded of Mrs. Stirling's statement that kidnapped persons often looked
  thin and neglected. It was treason to connect a fairy princess with a lapse
  of standard; yet she had a horrible vision of Beatrice as she might be at
  that moment&mdash;sitting in sordid surroundings, her white fur grimed her
  hands dirty, and with strands of hair falling across unfamiliar pale
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Ring up Raphael," said Christina suddenly. "He will tell us what to
  do."</p>

  <p>Ignored in the crisis, Viola went back to her own room. Presently she rang
  up Foam's number and was fortunate in finding him still in his office. He
  stopped checking reports and switched his mind off his case while she told
  him the contents of Beatrice's letter.</p>

  <p>"Any hope?" she asked, licking her dry lips nervously when he made no
  comment.</p>

  <p>He did not reply at once, as though he were considering Viola's capacity
  to take punishment. In the end, he gave her the truth.</p>

  <p>"It's not too good. This seems a jewel robbery rather than a kidnapping
  case. As the girl is the means of getting the goods, my hunch is she'll be
  bumped off directly they handle the diamonds. They want her to write the
  letters while they are still bargaining. So long as her people recognize her
  handwriting, they know she is alive and they will keep the deal open."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't they imitate her writing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but a forgery can be spotted."</p>

  <p>"They might force her to write several letters and then murder her."</p>

  <p>"That girl would refuse to write a bunch, even with a gun poked in her
  ribs. She is too intelligent not to guess the inference, and she would argue
  that if she had to go out, either way, she'd be damned if she would deliver
  the goods."</p>

  <p>"You forget something. They could threaten her with torture."</p>

  <p>"Cut it out," advised Foam. "Listen, you. Ill treatment would make her
  handwriting shaky and give away the game. They've got to sell the idea that
  she'll be returned intact and without one hair out of place directly they
  receive the ransom."</p>

  <p>"And won't they?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But that's terrible." Viola's voice thickened in a sob. "Can't you
  suggest something? You must. Alan. You must."</p>

  <p>"My child, it's not my case... If I had to carry on at this point, I
  should stall them with imitations while I pounced on Major Pomeroy and clawed
  the truth out of him about the monkey business at Pomerania House. I'd give
  him the works now, while he's still shaken by Goya's death. If there is a
  conspiracy about that vanishing, he must be working in with her... Now could
  you sell the idea lo Beatrice's parents?"</p>

  <p>Whipping up her courage, Viola rushed into the sitting room of the
  Stirling suite. Raphael Cross was talking to Christina in a low voice. She
  noticed that his face was pale and lined as she drew a deep breath&mdash;to
  steady her nerves&mdash;before she began to plead for the substitution of
  duplicate imitation jewels.</p>

  <p>As though stunned by her daring, no one attempted to silence her. When she
  stopped, Christina questioned Raphael Cross with her eyes.</p>

  <p>He shook his head and grimaced.</p>

  <p>"Theatrical stuff," he remarked. "Fakes would get you nowhere. This gang
  would test the jewels before they released Beatrice."</p>

  <p>"But it's only a gag to give you time to grill the major," explained
  Viola.</p>

  <p>"I'd doubt if he'd squeal. My experience of Pomeroy convinces me he is a
  deep and slippery customer. I don't forget how he stung me... By the way,
  William, have you imitation duplicates of the diamonds?"</p>

  <p>The millionaire merely tightened his lips as a hint that he did not reveal
  secrets. His puckered eyes glared at Viola as he suddenly pounced on her.</p>

  <p>"Who gave you this advice?" he asked. "Have you been blabbing to that
  detective?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she admitted, "but he won't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get out. And stay out! Haven't you done enough mischief? Didn't it occur
  to you that if one whisper of this leaks out now&mdash;at this critical
  stage&mdash;this gang would think we'd double-crossed them?... Ah."</p>

  <p>He broke off as the door opened and the detectives entered the room. Don
  carried a large case which he placed upon a substantial card table. The
  millionaire produced the key&mdash;which he kept upon a ring&mdash;and
  unlocked it, revealing smaller cases closely packed together in the
  interior.</p>

  <p>He and Mack pressed their catches open and shook out each glittering
  content onto the green cloth-ring, brooch, bracelet, necklace, tiara. It was
  rather like shelling peas on an overpowering and magnificent scale, as they
  piled up the jewels and threw aside the empty receptacles.</p>

  <p>Viola gazed with enthralled eyes at the multi-hued gleams which flashed
  from the diamonds, but Christina scooped up a handful contemptuously as
  though they were pebbles.</p>

  <p>"Just mineral ore," she said bitterly, dropping them through her fingers.
  "To think my Beatrice is only worth a few chips."</p>

  <p>The millionaire snapped his jaws like a pike.</p>

  <p>"We've still to settle on our messenger," he said. "What I said about
  Christina stands. I refuse to risk her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I won't let you go, Will," declared Mrs. Stirling. "I cannot lose my
  man too."</p>

  <p>Her words made Viola glance at the millionaire in wonder. Since Beatrice's
  disappearance, she had regarded him somewhat as a shrivelled sheath or a
  stuffed bundle of clothes. Now the need for swift decision had restored his
  dominant personality. Like a recharged magneto it galvanized his nervous
  machinery, changing him from a cipher to a dominant figure.</p>

  <p>"She's right, Will," approved Cross. "You are too rich a prize. I'm glad
  of it for it leaves me in&mdash;They would accept me&mdash;I have no official
  status."</p>

  <p>He did not disguise his disappointment when the millionaire shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"You're not a safe medium, Raphael. You'd flare up, Remember you wouldn't
  trust yourself&mdash;before."</p>

  <p>"That was different. Evelyn was my own."</p>

  <p>Cross continued to argue the point but Stirling would not weaken. Just as
  the men appeared to have reached a deadlock, Cross made a suggestion.</p>

  <p>"My chauffeur. Bergman. He's a thick-headed chump with no curiosity. He'll
  carry out orders like a machine."</p>

  <p>"Have him over," ordered the millionaire.</p>

  <p>Viola blundered from the room, lost in a maze of misery. Her faith in Foam
  made her believe that Beatrice's life was, about to be sacrificed to a
  preconception based upon fear. Evelyn Cross' terrible death overshadowed the
  situation&mdash;clouding the parents' judgment. They were hypnotized by the
  horror of a photograph&mdash;a snapshot of a blonde with blackened face and
  protruding eyes.</p>

  <p>When she rang up Foam and told him of her failure, she was unfairly
  furious with him because he would not linger to talk.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to say," he said. "They've turned down my suggestion."</p>

  <p>The hands of the clock seemed paralyzed between the hours of four and
  five. As the daylight faded, Viola grew desperate at the feeling of the slow
  drift towards certain disaster.</p>

  <p>"Waiting," she told herself, "always waiting. If this was a picture, there
  would be action. Things would begin to rip right up to the punch. Even Alan
  has let me down to shadow some mystery dame."</p>

  <p>She did Foam an injustice, for he was neglecting his own work in an effort
  to recapture an impression. During a breathing space over a snatched lunch,
  he followed up each implication in the alleged disappearance of Evelyn
  Cross.</p>

  <p>He started from his theory that Madeline Power was wearing two suits. But
  while he had a glimmer of the workings of a conspiracy, he was baffled by the
  necessity for co-operation on the part of one person whom he could not
  logically include. It was here that his deductions were not only wrecked by
  lack of motive but by a counterblast of overwhelming contrary evidence. It
  was as though he reached an indicated direction&mdash;only to find a finger
  post pointing the opposite way.</p>

  <p>"Snakes biting each other's tail," he muttered. "Only, in this case, the
  weakest members are being devoured. Sooner or later, by the process of
  elimination, I shall know who is tops... When it is too late."</p>

  <p>As he recalled his meeting with Nell Gaynor, he was particularly conscious
  of a discrepancy. The woman was perfectly natural and genuine, yet she had
  contrived to strike a false note. It was something she had said&mdash;or
  failed to say...</p>

  <p>When five o'clock drew near, Viola felt she could not endure to stay in
  the hotel. Although her fright in No. 16 had made her shrink from the
  prospect of returning to Pomerania House, she decided to go back to her own
  apartment. The Stirlings had no legal power to keep her against her will.
  "They can send my luggage or keep it," she thought recklessly, as she dragged
  on a coat and hat and snatched up her handbag.</p>

  <p>When she reached the entrance hall, a page rushed forward to swing her
  through the revolving doors. He was a precocious youth who cherished a secret
  passion for her because of her likeness to his favourite film star.</p>

  <p>She smiled at him&mdash;causing him to blink with rapture&mdash;before she
  went out into the electric glare of Piccadilly. As she stood, she saw a taxi
  leave the rank and drive to the entrance of the hotel. Then Bergman
  appeared&mdash;a vast stolid figure, negligently swinging a black bag.</p>

  <p>"He's carrying Beatrice's life," she told herself...</p>

  <p>For several minutes, the telephone bell had been ringing in her deserted
  room at the hotel. After a while, the switch-board girl spoke to Foam as he
  tried vainly to get in touch with Viola.</p>

  <p>"She's not in her room. Shall I have her paged?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "At once, please. It's too urgent to waste time calling
  her to the phone. Take this message and see she gets it as soon as
  possible."</p>

  <p>The hotel staff took a specialized interest in the members of the
  millionaire's party. The girl wrote down Foam's dictation, reread it rapidly,
  and called for a page. Out of several applicants, the precocious youth had
  special information.</p>

  <p>"Eight-one-eight," he repeated. "She's just gone out. I'll catch her
  up."</p>

  <p>He had not far to go as Viola still stood and watched the taxi. As it
  began to move, a youth in a buff-and-chocolate livery gave her a slip of
  paper.</p>

  <p>"Just come through," he said breathlessly. "Very urgent."</p>

  <p>She read the lines at a glance.</p>

  <p>"Foam speaking. R. C. is 'X.' Don't let him or his chauffeur handle any
  goods."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24">XXIV. &mdash; CHIVALRY LIVES ON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">VIOLA stared after the receding taxi with a feeling of utter
  helplessness. The situation had passed beyond her control. To attempt to stop
  the march of events was like trying to clutch at giant machinery which
  wrenched itself from her hold her knees weakened and the lights of Piccadilly
  grew blurred.</p>

  <p>It was too late... Yet&mdash;even as she accepted defeat&mdash;her
  dominant instinct flickered to life. Struggling for recognition beneath the
  clogged cells of her brain was a sense of familiarity with the
  situation&mdash;a feeling that she had been there before. Suddenly she
  realized that she knew how to act in such a crisis because it was a stock
  development of drama.</p>

  <p>At the suggestion, her mind cleared and her quivering nerves were stilled.
  While the traffic shrieked past her, she might have been in a soundproof
  room, writing a scenario, as she reviewed the problem.</p>

  <p>The first step was elementary. She had to follow Bergman. The keen
  eyesight of youth enabled her to read the number of the distant taxi just
  before it was obscured by a van. As though she were a witch mumbling a spell,
  she repeated the figures until she had scribbled them in her engagement book.
  Rushing towards the cab rank, she thrust the paper almost in the eyes of the
  first driver.</p>

  <p>"Trail that number," she cried. "Don't let them see us follow them. It's
  desperately urgent."</p>

  <p>The man's hard-bitten face remained expressionless.</p>

  <p>"What's your limit?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None. You're wasting time. Oh, hurry, man!"</p>

  <p>The only sign he gave of having heard her was to lower his flag with a
  leisurely movement. Maddened by his deliberation, she took a pound note from
  her bag.</p>

  <p>"That will carry you on," she said.</p>

  <p>Payment on account proved a better stimulus than emotion. Within a minute
  she was seated in the taxi and rattling on her chase.</p>

  <p>The man drove past the shops, the hotels and the clubs of Piccadilly to
  Hyde Park Corner. Instead of continuing in a straight line, heading for the
  Great West Road, he turned downwards in a southerly direction.</p>

  <p>Viola's heart began to pump with excitement as she realized that Alan's
  suspicion justified her own melodrama. He had deduced that the directions
  given in 'Beatrice's letter were subterfuge to cover its real purpose. The
  object was to enable a member of the gang to act as messenger and thus get
  possession of the diamonds.</p>

  <p>The stratagem had proved successful, for Bergman was taking the jewels to
  the safety of their hide-out, where&mdash;by the ethics of
  crime&mdash;Beatrice would be held a prisoner. Viola's heart throbbed
  exultantly as she reminded herself that she was the heroine&mdash;playing
  lead for the first time in a real-life drama.</p>

  <p>Held in a dreamlike state of elation, she seemed to remain static while an
  unfamiliar city spun past her. Although she knew every stage of the way, this
  was not the London she had seen before she entered the taxi. She was in a
  different medium, where each exterior was but a painted plaster shell
  faithfully reproduced by the scenic artist.</p>

  <p>Past stalely, darkened town-mansions, between brilliantly lit shops and
  offices, across the river, through an area of factories, gasworks and public
  houses, climbing up to the vast blocks of flats and the super-cinemas of the
  suburbs. Farther out still&mdash;leaving the Commons behind&mdash;following
  the gleaming trail of tram lines out into the Green Belt, where miles of
  small houses and gardens unwound on the ribbon system. Then the long lines
  were succeeded by semi-detached villas which in their turn yielded to larger
  and more widely spaced residences, standing in ambitious grounds.</p>

  <p>As she looked through the windows, Viola resolutely kept her nerve keyed
  high, but beneath her jubilation flowed a sub-current of apprehension. A
  warning voice whispered that she could not remain enclosed indefinitely in
  the security of a film. Nothing but a transparency shielded her from the
  peril of reality.</p>

  <p>She was trying to cling to her illusion of safety when the driver
  shattered her confidence by whistling down the tube.</p>

  <p>"We're getting well out," he warned her. "They'll be bound to spot we're
  following them soon. If they beckon me to overtake them, what will I do?"</p>

  <p>With a sickening recoil to defeatism, she admitted that the man was
  voicing her dormant fears as she realized the flaw in her scheme. She was the
  opposite number of the heroine who complicates a rescue by searching a
  racketeer's flat in his absence&mdash;on a tacit understanding with the
  audience that she will be trapped.</p>

  <p>"Idiot," she thought. "When he notices the taxi, he'll string me along
  just to shake me off. He won't lead me to Beatrice. And if he did, what can I
  do&mdash;alone? What can I do?"</p>

  <p>She was distracted by the waste of vital time. Besides Foam, she was the
  only person who knew that Bergman was the link connecting Beatrice with her
  people. While he was carrying her death warrant in the diamonds, Raphael
  Cross was also at liberty&mdash;an unchecked lethal force. Even if Alan could
  prove the conspiracy, what was the good of vengeance after Beatrice was
  dead?</p>

  <p>As she hesitated, the driver called again down the tube.</p>

  <p>"Road straightens out just after Foxley," he said. "Are you game for a
  race?"</p>

  <p>"No. Wait. I'll think of something." As she rejected the idea of an open
  chase as suicidal policy, a flash of intuition suggested a desperate
  chance.</p>

  <p>She must stop trailing the taxi and let it get clean away&mdash;while she
  waited on the road for its problematic return.</p>

  <p>The expedient was bold and crafty but the risks were heavy her idea was to
  bribe the driver of Bergman's taxi to tell her the address of the hide-out.
  But he might refuse the information&mdash;or he might lie. Bergman might
  leave the taxi before he reached his destination. In the worst case, she
  might miss the taxi altogether if it returned to London by a different
  route.</p>

  <p>"How far to Foxley?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Just round the bend," replied the driver.</p>

  <p>"Please stop. I'm getting out here."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the meter.</p>

  <p>"You've still some mileage," he told her. "I could take you back to the
  tram terminus."</p>

  <p>When she shook her head, he lost interest and drove off, leaving her
  stranded in the darkness.</p>

  <p>As she walked towards Foxley, the polished surface of the arterial road
  flowed like a black river between countrified banks, topped with naked thorn
  hedges. It was proof that she had nearly left the region of bricks and
  mortar. As she recalled the open landscape ahead, she assured herself that if
  Bergman had any doubts, they must disappear when milestone succeeded
  milestone without any persistent taxi rattling in his rear.</p>

  <p>She argued that he had no special reason to suspect pursuit, since he
  could not know of Foam's telephone message. In addition, the plot was reared
  on a foundation of security. Through his personal magnetism and the bond that
  he himself was a victim, Raphael Cross had created a privileged position both
  for himself and his associates.</p>

  <p>Although she was acting on Foam's information, Viola was like the historic
  lady who did not believe in ghosts but was afraid of them. She feared Cross
  because of a monstrous memory&mdash;now faded to a smoky smudge&mdash;when
  she believed that his reflection had looked at her from a darkened mirror;
  yet the idea of him in a criminal capacity was too great a strain on her
  credulity.</p>

  <p>As she remembered his disappointment at Stirling's refusal to appoint him
  messenger, it seemed to indicate that he had counted on being chosen as
  medium and of handling the diamonds. This wound account for his decision to
  take an anonymous taxi. He was too wily to risk the infinitesimal chance that
  his own car might be recognized when far away from the radius of the Great
  West Road.</p>

  <p>Not far from Foxley she stopped under a railway arch to write a note in
  the light of its lamp. Holding a leaf from her engagement book against the
  rough grey stone wall, she licked her pencil and pressed upon the paper. She
  wrote with the distinctness of printed characters and left one line
  blank.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice is held at... Counting on you for immediate action. Too late to
  stop goods. Greeny."</p>

  <p>After adding Foam's name and his home telephone number, she continued to
  plod along the slimed camber of the road in order to avoid passing motorists.
  A spit of moisture in the air made the surface perilous to high heels, but
  she persevered until she reached a point where the road forked. She had
  forgotten this by-pass which interfered with her plans. Uncertain of the
  direction from which the taxi might come, she had to stand and check the
  stream of intermittent vehicles.</p>

  <p>After a while the strain of inaction began to undermine her resistance.
  She could not restrain her imagination from hovering around dark horrors or
  wrench her mind from the passage of vital time. Doubts thickened&mdash;as she
  wondered whether she would fail to see the taxi, should the traffic increase
  at the critical moment.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it will refuse to stop," she thought. "Or I might forget the
  number. That happened that awful time I tried to ring up Alan. Everything
  began to buzz and then went blank."</p>

  <p>She was repeating the number in a frantic monotone when suddenly it
  flashed&mdash;in illumined numerals&mdash;through the gloom. Its appearance
  was so unexpected that at first she stared at it in stunned surprise. She
  felt as though she had materialized her own desire from the very urgency of
  her call... It was on the point of passing by when she realized the danger
  and waved to it to stop.</p>

  <p>To her great relief, the driver saw her, for he slammed on his brake and
  skidded across to her side of the road.</p>

  <p>She studied his face with deep anxiety. He was young, with pale hollow
  cheeks, bad teeth and sunken eyes. He suggested vaguely a permanent member of
  the minority and a champion of lost causes, on the shaky evidence of a
  visionary expression and a red tie.</p>

  <p>Viola determined to blast a response from any buried chivalry.</p>

  <p>"I'm in terrible trouble," she said. "I want someone to help
  me&mdash;someone who's brave and intelligent. Please. Will you? It's only to
  drive to the nearest telephone box and ring up this number. Ask for Alan Foam
  and tell him exactly what's written here. If he's out, tell whoever answers
  the call to write down the message. You must insist that every effort is made
  to locate him... Say it means life or death, do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, lady," replied the young man, as he read the paper. Then he pointed
  to the vacant space. "You've left out the address," he said.</p>

  <p>"I know." Feeling it time to work a financial spell, Viola produced her
  remaining pound note. "I've been waiting here for you to tell me that. I'm
  cold and scared... Where did you drive that man you picked up outside the
  Colosseum Hotel? I know I can trust you and you'll tell me the truth. You're
  my very last hope."</p>

  <p>He hesitated as he glanced from the money to her attractive face. Suddenly
  the note won, for he pocketed it with a smile. "I'm for you, mate," he told
  her. "The bloke paid me off at Starfish Avenue, Asterwood. It's a new housing
  estate they're building for stinking millionaires just off the main road
  four&mdash;five mile farther on. He made me get there by the loop road and
  then work back to it through a chronic lot of lanes. But I'm used to driving
  lunatics."</p>

  <p>"Which house?" asked Viola.</p>

  <p>'I didn't wait to see. But there won't be many took."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you, mate." Viola clasped the driver's hand. "You will never
  know what this means to me."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I go to this address for you instead of the other bloke?"</p>

  <p>"No, it's too delicate and too dangerous. It needs trained handling. But
  it's noble of you to offer. Please go quickly."</p>

  <p>Inspired by her pleading voice, he drove off into the darkness.</p>

  <p>She looked after the cab with shining eyes because the young driver was
  her link with Alan. At this crisis, she realized the need of his practical
  experience; but he was too remote and the time element too pressing to depend
  on his help. While he was on his way out to Asterwood Beatrice might be
  murdered. She had to keep him in reserve in case of her own failure, but her
  hopes of success were high. She was close to Foxley constabulary where she
  could enlist the power of the law. She began to run, exulting in the thought
  that within a few minutes a police car would be speeding to the rescue.</p>

  <p>Foxley was a straggling top-heavy village&mdash;two lines of mean brick
  houses perched on the summit of high banks. Flights of perilous steps led up
  to their doors. When she saw the blue lamp of the police station, she
  literally stormed her way inside. A fresh-faced young constable tried to
  detain her by the authority of the law, but he was unfairly outclassed by
  shock tactics.</p>

  <p>When she was inside the inner office, she was further reassured by the
  familiarity of her surroundings. She had seen this bare official room on many
  a set. Before a knee table was seated a middle-aged man in uniform his cleft
  chin, moustache and spectacles reminded her of a photograph of Rudyard
  Kipling. Because she had loved his jungle folk in her childhood&mdash;and
  stimulated by her recent success&mdash;she burst into her story.</p>

  <p>"A girl has been kidnapped. She&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He interrupted her with a question.</p>

  <p>"Name and address of the father?"</p>

  <p>"William Stirling. He's the famous millionaire. He is staying at the
  Colosseum Hotel, Piccadilly."</p>

  <p>"And now your own name and address?"</p>

  <p>As she supplied the details, she was vaguely chilled to notice that he
  nodded to the young constable who went into the outer office.</p>

  <p>"Now what were you going to tell me?" invited the official.</p>

  <p>Eager to convince him, Viola began a dramatic recital of Beatrice's peril.
  In her own vocabulary, she "gave it all she had." She was getting near the
  end of her story when the young constable returned.</p>

  <p>"You're through, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>Putting up his hand for silence, the official spoke into the telephone
  upon his desk.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant Barker speaking from Foxley constabulary. I have just received a
  report that your daughter is missing... What's that? She's at home?... Yes...
  Yes... A young woman of the name of 'Green'... Yes, I'll speak to him. Put
  him on the line."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25">XXV. &mdash; STARFISH AVENUE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WITH a landslide of her hopes, Viola listened to the barking
  and spluttering of the wire. The air seemed to vibrate as though she were
  still standing under the railway arch while a train thundered overhead. She
  knew exactly when Raphael Cross succeeded the millionaire by the
  man-of-the-world smile which spread over the sergeant's face.</p>

  <p>"My own impression," he remarked&mdash;"Ha-ha. Yes, we learn how to sum
  them up... Is that so? I'll ask her... Thanks very much."</p>

  <p>As he rang on, he sprang a question on Viola.</p>

  <p>"Been on the stage?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, "but I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen, young woman. I've just been advised that this is not the first
  time you've made yourself a public nuisance. Take my advice. Control your
  temperament and keep out of the limelight&mdash;or you may find yourself let
  in for a nasty spot of trouble."</p>

  <p>As she gazed at him, she wondered that she had ever thought he looked
  kind.</p>

  <p>"I swear I've told you the truth," she declared.</p>

  <p>'"You've told me a pack of lies," contradicted the official. "The girl's
  father denies she is missing."</p>

  <p>"That's because he dare not admit it. The kidnappers have threatened him
  that if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know all about that... That's the way out."</p>

  <p>When she continued to plead, he nodded to the young constable who tried to
  escort her to the door. Losing her temper, she was guilty of resisting the
  police and had to take the consequences. After a brief scuffle, she found
  herself out in the road&mdash;her face flaming with humiliation.</p>

  <p>"Thrown out on my ear," she muttered wrathfully.</p>

  <p>In that zero moment, she longed for a double support&mdash;for the mental
  stimulus of Foam's practical mind and the physical pressure of his arm. Her
  disappointment was the more crushing because she believed she had worked out
  a simple and sensible scheme of rescue, instead of attempting a solo
  demonstration.</p>

  <p>"Wish I was doing the good old ivy stunt now," she thought.</p>

  <p>Her defeat made her anxious to get in touch with Foam in case the taxi
  driver had failed to deliver her message. If he dashed off immediately to
  Starfish Avenue, even then it might not be too late. There was a chance that
  Bergman would wait for Cross' arrival before testing the diamonds.</p>

  <p>As she trudged along, she looked in vain for a public telephone booth.
  Presently she reached the gate of a modern rough-cast house built in Tudor
  style with a steep roof and black painted beams. After climbing through an
  ambitious rock garden by crazy-paving, rustic steps and a hump-backed
  bridge&mdash;all slippery with moisture&mdash;she met with
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>An elderly and immaculate maid barely listened to her request before she
  shut the door in her face.</p>

  <p>"Sorry. We're not on the phone," she snapped, although Viola could see the
  wire glistening in the light of the porch lamp.</p>

  <p>Evidently the residents in a lonely district were taking no risks with
  strangers. When she had toiled up to the front entrance of the next
  house&mdash;also built upon rising ground&mdash;her peals and knocks were
  disregarded, although lights were streaming through the windows.</p>

  <p>It seemed hopeless to climb up to other elevated residences while
  priceless time was oozing to waste. Smitten with sudden hysteria, she began
  to run madly, with no sense of direction and no idea of future action. She
  only knew that Beatrice was in danger and that she must reach her before it
  was too late.</p>

  <p>She was lost to any fear of danger from traffic, although cars flashed
  towards her in a glare of headlights and streaked past with the blast of
  horns. Sometimes she was alone in a clear, cool darkness like brook water
  when she saw only stars and trees, but almost before she was conscious of
  relief the peace was shattered by another explosive snarl.</p>

  <p>As she rushed downhill, she had the sense that she too was a piece of
  mechanism, wound up to continuous motion her limbs seemed controlled by
  springs, and her feet beat the ground with the regularity of pistons. She
  felt neither strain nor effort, as though she were running on a limitless
  reserve of power.</p>

  <p>Filled with exultation, she increased her pace to a spurt and lengthened
  her stride. She was geared to top speed&mdash;unconsciously flogging her
  nerves in a furious drive beyond the pitch of her endurance, when she
  literally leaped to disaster. One moment she was a tireless automaton, the
  next, the machine was wrecked by the human element.</p>

  <p>Her collapse was sudden as an actual crash. She stopped fighting for
  breath, while the stars were blotted out. At first she was terrified, but
  after a struggle her lungs began to function as the pounding of her heart
  diminished to a more normal beat.</p>

  <p>"Just winded," she muttered scornfully "Run myself clean out. Got to walk
  if I can't hitch-hike. No, not clever."</p>

  <p>As she began to plod along the road she realized that she was in poor
  shape for further sustained effort. Her legs were weak, her ankles ached and
  her chest remained tight; yet, while she was compelled to reduce her pace,
  every nerve and fibre protested against the check. "Hurry, hurry, or you'll
  be too late," they threatened.</p>

  <p>She dared not look at her watch lest she lost heart altogether, but she
  could not help recalling the taxi driver's estimate of the distance.</p>

  <p>"Five miles. Even if I've run one mile, that leaves me an hour away at
  four miles an hour. And I'm doing about two. Swell hope."</p>

  <p>All the luck seemed to be against her. The occasional motorists who shot
  past, travelling in her direction, were blind to her signals. Either she was
  invisible in the darkness, or they were taking advantage of the level stretch
  to let their cars out.</p>

  <p>After a while the journey became a test of endurance when she stumbled
  along in a dazed dream. She had no idea of how many milestones she had passed
  or how long she had been walking. Before her stretched an endless black
  track, split by a white dividing line. Whenever her head cleared, she thought
  of the dangers and difficulties which lay before her. She wondered what
  awaited her at Starfish Avenue and how she could help Beatrice&mdash;if she
  found her. But she could not keep her mind focussed on her problem. After a
  few seconds, it slipped back into a muddle of disconnected phrases.</p>

  <p>"Keep going. Remember the tortoise. Good old tortoise, good old Waft
  Disney... Beatrice... Cut. Take it on the chin. Knees up, Mother Brown...
  Beatrice, Beatrice... Doing the Lambeth Walk."</p>

  <p>Her shuffle had lapsed to a crawl when suddenly she stopped babbling at
  the sight of a tangle of lights which sprawled over the darkness rather like
  the constellation of Hercules. A board identified the estate as "Starfish
  Avenue," and advertised it as the speculation of a building society. Her
  weariness forgotten, Viola turned off from the road and entered the meadow
  through a deeply rutted gap in the hedge. As she toiled on a tour of
  exploration, she realized that the apparent confusion of the houses was due
  to the lack of a road to connect them in any sequence. There were indications
  of pavements, however, where she picked her way over muddy patches and
  dangerous loose bricks.</p>

  <p>The residences were all of one type&mdash;small, compact and well
  built&mdash;with two living rooms and a kitchen on the ground floor and three
  bedrooms and a bathroom above. They were planned for young people to begin
  their married life, and for old people to end theirs in retirement. Some were
  still in process of erection for she distinguished scaffolding reared against
  the starry sky. Others were finished but either unlet or unoccupied.</p>

  <p>A few were tenanted, and it was upon those that Viola concentrated her
  search. She argued that the windows of the hide-out would be screened to
  prevent anyone catching sight of Beatrice from outside and that,
  consequently, she might not see its lights; therefore, in order not to risk
  passing it in the darkness, she had to plough across soggy pasture from house
  to house.</p>

  <p>Flashing her torch in at bare windows, she revealed either the clean
  plaster walls of unlet property or finished decorations chosen by future
  owners. Amid these blind shells, the lighted casements of happy homes gleamed
  like oases. As the tenants were free from the annoyance of being overlooked,
  no blinds were drawn and she had a clear view of each interior.</p>

  <p>In "Mon Abri," a young couple posed sentimentally in the firelight. An
  elderly pair listened to the wireless in "Locarno." Romping children turned
  "Peace Haven" into a merry hell.</p>

  <p>Viola began to feel sick from repeated disappointment. The acid of failure
  was corroding her courage so that she lost all faith in the taxi driver's
  word. She was turning back to the road when she noticed the dark outline of a
  house built on the highest part of the meadow. It was situated in a far
  corner, and to reach it she had to cross a patch of waste ground.</p>

  <p>Thistles pricked her ankles, and she had to crunch over the broken crocks
  and empty tins of a refuse dump; but as each step brought her nearer, her
  conviction grew that this was the house she sought. When she was flush with
  its windows, there was ominous proof of a temporary prison, for the glass was
  covered completely with net in addition to drawn, dark curtains.</p>

  <p>This was the moment she had been dreading. She was outside&mdash;without
  plan or resource&mdash;helpless as a timid forest creature that had blundered
  near a den of tigers. Yet, as she waited, personal peril was swamped by a
  more insidious fear&mdash;the threat of annihilation&mdash;when the emptiness
  of the house seemed to reach out and touch her with the chill of dead
  fingers.</p>

  <p>Filled with foreboding, she wandered around the building, seeking a chink
  of light or a whisper from within, but the darkness and silence remained
  unbroken. When she reached the back door, she had scaled a peak of
  desperation when she was reckless of consequences. Stooping over the cinder
  path, she picked up a brick and smashed a glass panel.</p>

  <p>After she had slipped her hand through the jagged aperture, she had to
  strain dangerously to reach the bolt, but she managed to press it back and
  enter the house. For several seconds she stood in the darkness, not daring to
  move or betray her presence. As she grew bolder, she groped around to find a
  wall switch.</p>

  <p>The glow of electric light proved that the premises were served by a
  borough corporation and, therefore, were formally occupied. She gazed around
  at a white-tiled kitchen, equipped with cabinet and frigidaire as builder's
  fixtures. It bore signs of recent use and also of neglect. There was a litter
  of tea leaves, egg shells and cigarette stubs soaked in the sink. A kettle
  stood drunkenly on the gas stove and water dripped from a primrose porcelain
  tap.</p>

  <p>Viola craned her neck and strained her ears&mdash;listening.</p>

  <p>"Empty," she whispered. "They've gone."</p>

  <p>It was no longer an ambushed attack that she dreaded&mdash;but desolation.
  In deep heaviness of spirit, she made a thorough search of the
  house&mdash;forcing herself to examine any cupboard or recess which might
  conceal a body.</p>

  <p>The top floor was as bare as when the builder had departed, with the
  exception of the bathroom. There, crumpled towels and soap lying in the
  water, showed that it had been put to its legitimate use. But the
  ground-floor rooms were most revealing. Someone had lived in one of these,
  for there was a bed with creased linen and a cheap suite. In the other was
  stacked a collection of odd furniture. Books were heaped untidily on the
  floor beside a broken microscope and a typewriter.</p>

  <p>The elaborately upholstered windows were plainly a sop to allay the
  suspicions of passers-by, for all the floors were bare with the exception of
  a few rugs. Viola's temples tightened as she recognized their jade and orange
  colouring. There were also brilliant-hued cushions from Goya's flat, and her
  mirror leaned against the wall in two parts&mdash;the glass separate from its
  frame.</p>

  <p>The photograph of a clergyman, placed upside down on a mantelshelf, gave
  her the clue to the ownership of the student's library and the odd table and
  chairs. All these had belonged to Miss Power&mdash;thus linking the two women
  in an ominous partnership.</p>

  <p>But there was no trace of Beatrice&mdash;no personal belonging left
  behind; not even a breath of her special faint perfume&mdash;apple bloom. It
  was not until Viola was leaving the house that her heel slipped on something
  lying in the passage.</p>

  <p>She picked it up&mdash;a brown orchid which once had been white.</p>

  <p>As she placed it tenderly inside her bag, she fought another brain storm.
  It was agony to know that Beatrice had actually been there only a short time
  before, and that she had probably missed her by minutes. She felt aimless and
  helpless as a rudder-boat drifting before a gale. All that was left of
  purpose was a blind instinct to get back to London.</p>

  <p>She lurched with weariness as she walked along the main road her head swam
  and her feet felt weighted with lead. She knew that she was physically
  incapable of reaching even Foxley, but the knowledge did not trouble her. She
  could walk until she dropped. After that, there was nothing to be done.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the headlights of a powerful car picked up her staggering figure.
  After it had passed her, it stopped and a chauffeur came to meet her with a
  message.</p>

  <p>"My mistress wishes to know whether you would like a lift."</p>

  <p>She was too exhausted to do more than gasp her thanks and her destination
  to the elderly couple who sat in the saloon. She noted vaguely that both were
  elderly, with big pink faces, white hair and horn-rimmed glasses. They
  appeared prosperous and kindly. After the wife, had firmly checked her
  husband's curiosity, he asked no further questions and Viola was left to lie
  back, with closed eyes, in healing peace.</p>

  <p>Soothed by the warmth and swift motion, she fell asleep until she was
  awakened by flashing lights and traffic hoots. As she vaguely realized that
  she was back in Piccadilly, the chauffeur stopped the car.</p>

  <p>"Colosseum Hotel," he announced.</p>

  <p>The same page who had brought her Foam's telephone message rushed forward
  to assist her through the revolving doors. She looked at him in slight wonder
  to find him unchanged. It seemed to her that a very long time had passed
  since she had last seen him.</p>

  <p>Her feet, dragged on her way to the lift, as though weighed down by the
  heaviness of her heart; but even while she shrank from the ordeal of being
  the herald of Beatrice's fate, she fanned the fury of her anger with the
  millionaire.</p>

  <p>"If he hadn't let me down, Beatrice would be back," she reminded herself.
  "He shall have the truth from me."</p>

  <p>When she reached the Stirling apartment, she flung open the door before
  her courage cooled... Then she stood&mdash;staring in incredulous joy, as
  though unable to believe what she saw.</p>

  <p>There were lights, laughter and voices raised in happy excitement, with
  everyone talking at once. The room seemed full of people. Mack and Don were
  there, besides the Stirlings and Foam. All were paying homage to the central
  figure. Radiant as a fairy princess, Beatrice wore spotless white her cheeks
  flamed with colour and her hair shone&mdash;as though in mockery of Viola's
  nightmare vision.</p>

  <p>Viola was about to rush forward and hug her in frantic welcome, when her
  instinct restrained her.</p>

  <p>"Back again?" she asked casually. "Good show."</p>

  <p>"Not bad," agreed Beatrice, with equal nonchalance. "Been mucking
  about?"</p>

  <p>The gratitude in her eyes spoke to Viola, thanking her for her
  understanding. She had been living at high pressure, surfeited with emotion,
  and appalled by the threat of extinction. She wanted only to forget her
  hideous experience, of which this prolonged rapture of reunion was too
  poignant a reminder.</p>

  <p>It was the blessed balm of British understatement which restored her to a
  normal world.</p>

  <p>Unable to resist one touch of drama, Viola drew the browned orchid from
  her bag.</p>

  <p>"Yours?" she asked. "I picked it up in Starfish Avenue." Then suddenly she
  dropped her pose. "What happened?" she cried. "Won't someone explain?"</p>

  <p>Before anyone could speak, Foam began to give her a brief outline of
  events. While the others concentrated on Beatrice, Viola was the central
  figure for him. He noticed the weariness and strain of her pale, vivid face,
  and knew that she was only sustained by her unquenchable spirit. "After your
  taxi driver rang me up, I got in touch with Mr. Stirling. He contacted the
  Foxley crowd as the nearest police. In the shortest possible time they
  collected Beatrice and arrested Bergman and Power. Soon afterwards, we pulled
  in Pomeroy and Cross... In fact, the only delayed action was my difficulty in
  persuading Mr. Stirling of the truth."</p>

  <p>The rasp in his voice was pointed by Viola's accusing eye as she glared at
  the millionaire.</p>

  <p>"You must forgive me," he faltered. "I nearly made the most terrible
  mistake of my life. The mere thought of it makes me cold... I can never thank
  you. Of course, there would have been a reward for Beatrice."</p>

  <p>When he produced his cheque book, Foam did not discourage him. The
  practical young man knew that no time was more propitious for payment than
  the peak moment of gratitude. He pocketed the cheque, thanked the
  millionaire, and put his arm around Viola.</p>

  <p>"I'm taking her to spend the night with my people," he announced. "We're
  going to get married."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26"
     name="ch26">XXVI. &mdash; LOOKING-GLASS PLOT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE following night, at his Highgate home, Foam explained
  the conspiracy to Viola. They sat before the drawing room fire in opposite
  chairs. She nursed a dog while he suffered an opportunist cat to stay on his
  knee, merely to preserve the domestic atmosphere. As Mrs. Foam reported to
  the doctor in the library, "They were settled in."</p>

  <p>This was his story&mdash;pruned of Viola's questions and comments.</p>

  <p>"To start with, an Anglo-American bunch of crooks got into a huddle to
  steal Mrs. Stirling's diamonds. They were Raphael Cross, Bergman and
  Bergman's wife, whom you know as 'Miss Power'. I'll continue to call her
  that. By the way, 'Raphael' is Cross' real name. He adopted 'Richard' at the
  time of Evelyn's murder, in case his newspaper publicity should cross the
  Atlantic.</p>

  <p>"When they were unsuccessful, they switched to the idea of kidnapping the
  daughter and demanding the diamonds as ransom to cut out the risk of hot
  money. They planned to try their luck during the London visit when they
  counted on relaxed vigilance. But they were a bit too smart in arranging an
  accident to the companion, because the Stirlings brought over two detectives
  in her place.</p>

  <p>"Their plot was to lure Beatrice into a room from which there was a secret
  exit. To carry it out, they formed a small syndicate, with Goya to finance
  the scheme and Major Pomeroy to provide the essential house property. Goya
  was a real business shark; but the major was caught on the hop. The poor
  devil was proud of his financial record when he played the market and faced
  bankruptcy.</p>

  <p>"These two persons had no idea that they were to be involved in anything
  but a dirty deal. Evelyn's murder shook them up badly. As a matter of fact,
  they were scheduled to be bumped off later to avoid the risk of leakage, but
  chiefly to save the gang from sharing the loot. Some of the value of the
  diamonds was bound to be lost in breaking them up and reselling them; but
  split among three, it was a rich haul.</p>

  <p>"There were two things essential to success. One was to establish
  confidence. Cross was ideal for this job he had enough personal magnetism to
  charm a bird from the bough. He was also an expert card player, which got him
  in solid with Mrs. Stirling on the voyage he was sufficiently clever, too, to
  overact, with his tall stories and his exaggerated emotions. The touch of
  comedian was to blind them to any sinister slant in his character.</p>

  <p>"Now I'll come to the plot. Cross was supposed to have a
  daughter&mdash;Evelyn. In reality he is unmarried. The blonde was a girl he
  picked off the street in New York. He promised her a share in the
  ransom&mdash;knowing all she would get would be a sticky finish... To keep
  myself tough over her, I have to remind myself that she knew exactly what
  kidnapping would mean for Beatrice when she callously agreed to join the
  gang.</p>

  <p>"Well, Evelyn Cross was supposed to vanish from No. 16, Pomerania House.
  The major timed the act when he could count upon a witness. She was the
  flighty typist&mdash;'Marlene'&mdash;and she was habitually on the prowl.
  They waited until she appeared on the scene, and then Cross raised Cain and
  insisted on the room being gutted to expose a hidden place of concealment.
  Goya did her stuff, and an honest builder was called in to give the place the
  necessary O.K.</p>

  <p>"No. 16 was cleared of all suspicion. That was the whole aim of the act.
  But so as not to saddle it with even a slur of mystery, Cross gave it out
  that his daughter had written to him&mdash;in proof positive, she was not
  lingering in Pomerania House in a state of chemical dissolution.</p>

  <p>"The next step was to redecorate No. 16, when Cross and the major staged a
  quarrel over the cost. This was to allay suspicion of any alliance between
  them. The builder did the papering, but the same night&mdash;under pretence
  of restoring the fixtures&mdash;Cross and Bergman did the real job of
  reconstruction.</p>

  <p>"The major got the porter out of the way and admitted them in the disguise
  of workmen. Incidentally, you and I turned up at an awkward moment. Cross was
  just carrying in the mirror, but he pretended to stoop under its weight so
  that I could not see his face.</p>

  <p>"That same night the two men cut a doorway in the dividing wall between
  No. 16 and 17. The major had made his original division of the premises
  expressly for the kidnapping; so he ordered the builder to put up a thin
  division, on the ground that it would be only temporary. Of course, this was
  a dodge to give them an easy job.</p>

  <p>"This doorway was then inset in the frame of the mirror which was firmly
  screwed to the wall of No. 16; but the glass was loose and hinged like a door
  so that it could swing inwards at a touch. It was secured at the
  back&mdash;in Power's room&mdash;and the bolt was concealed by a curtain. On
  Goya's side, it looked like an ordinary long mirror.</p>

  <p>"The police, however, would have discovered the subterfuge, for they would
  have made a thorough examination of the premises if they had been called in
  after Beatrice's disappearance. And this brings me to the second essential to
  success.</p>

  <p>"The police had to be kept out.</p>

  <p>"To do this, the wretched Evelyn was murdered to serve as an awful warning
  to the Stirlings. Of course, Cross attributed this to his own appeal to the
  police. It did not square with his original revenge motive, but his aim was
  to present himself as a father too crazed with fury and grief to be
  logical.</p>

  <p>"The murder was committed by one of the Bergmans, who got into Cross' flat
  by the fire escape. Cross arranged to be at my office for the sake of an
  alibi, in case he should be suspected of bumping off his daughter. It still
  sticks in my throat how he spun out the time so that he could be sure or her
  being dead before he returned to his flat.</p>

  <p>"Meantime, you were roped into the plot. Cross could not introduce a
  female gangster as Beatrice's companion, so he chanced his luck. He summed
  you up, found out you could furnish the correct social references, and then
  counted on his personality to control the situation. He must have found you a
  gift from the fairies with your imagination and dramatic temperament.</p>

  <p>"Before long, he got both you girls where he wanted you. He made Beatrice
  rebellious and determined to assert her independence by a visit to the
  crystal gazer. And this brings me to the actual kidnapping.</p>

  <p>"Its success hung on perfect timing. The gang worked to a schedule and saw
  to it that their watches agreed&mdash;for one second's hesitation would have
  ruined the show. The mirror door was opened between 16 and 17, and their
  furniture arranged so that one room would appear to be the reflection of the
  other. In accordance with plan, the major had furnished all three flatlets
  alike, although yours was inferior quality, as it was only eyewash. To
  complete the illusion, Madame divided her bright rugs and cushions between
  her room and Power's.</p>

  <p>"When you stood and looked down into 16, you actually saw a section of 17
  with part of a divan and a rug on the floor. The duplication was so perfect
  that you accepted it for the usual mirror.</p>

  <p>"So did Beatrice, until she was close enough to it to realize that she was
  not reflected in the glass. At that second, according to the timing, the
  major distracted your attention by telling you about a studio call. Well,
  Beatrice has told us what happened next. Suddenly Cross appeared inside the
  frame he smiled at her and put his finger to his lip&mdash;when she realized
  that he was springing a surprise on her to test her self-control.</p>

  <p>"As she said, everything after that happened so quickly that she could not
  remember things clearly. According to her 'A mountain fell on her' and she
  passed out. Her first experience of being sandbagged.</p>

  <p>"The rest was smart teamwork by the gang. All three of them were now in
  17. Cross had been hiding behind the kitchen partition when the front door
  was left open for Mack's inspection. The wardrobe was then blocking the
  entrance, so Beatrice and the incriminating rug and cushion were locked
  inside it and the mirror was bolted in its original position.</p>

  <p>"As the girl was stunned, she was spared the anguish of knowing that only
  the back of the wardrobe divided her from her faithful Mack, and that he
  actually helped to shove it clear. Between them. Cross and Bergman ran it
  down the stairs and got it on the van. They drove it out to Starfish Avenue,
  and Power followed to take charge of their prisoner.</p>

  <p>"They ran negligible risk of being recognized as fake removal men, for the
  major had sent the porter on an errand. The main lights in the building were
  not turned on, so both stairs and landing were on the dark side. Cross butted
  the wardrobe with his head as he shoved it, hiding his face. That dodge gave
  Mack no chance of spotting him&mdash;and when you came out of 16, you were
  too steamed up over Beatrice disappearing to notice anything. As for Bergman,
  you all knew him as a chauffeur and had no idea what he looked like without
  his goggles and peaked cap.</p>

  <p>"Now you understand why you had not a chance to convince anyone when you
  gave your version of what happened in No. 16. Cross had already pulled that
  tall story and it had been proved false. On top of the builder's evidence,
  the major played up with a natural reluctance to be stung twice.</p>

  <p>"There was another factor&mdash;a prejudice against smashing up new and
  costly decorations. Then&mdash;as a climax&mdash;someone saw a girl in a
  white coat leaving by the outside stairs.</p>

  <p>"When the Stirlings arrived on the scene, they fell into Cross' trap and
  refused to call in the police. Their nerve had been completely shattered by
  Evelyn's murder. Cross contrived to let Mrs. Stirling see an exceptionally
  ghastly snap he had taken of the dead girl. Naturally, no mother would risk
  that fate for her child.</p>

  <p>"The gang were sitting pretty&mdash;but there was one bad moment. Just
  before Beatrice arrived at Pomerania House, Goya spilled coffee on the arm of
  her divan&mdash;spoiling the 'reflection.' They hadn't time to rearrange the
  rooms&mdash;as angles and effects had to be studied&mdash;so Goya cut a scarf
  in two to cover up her arm and the opposite number.</p>

  <p>"Well, when the show was over, Cross wondered whether Power had remembered
  to remove her half. If someone found it, it might have started the first
  awkward question. He stole up to 17 when he heard someone in 16. Making sure
  it was Goya, he opened the connecting mirror door&mdash;and saw you.</p>

  <p>"Praise be you cut and ran... If you'd been curious&mdash;but I won't go
  into that... Cross gave you a drink to make you pass out and counted on your
  thinking you had dreamed the whole thing.</p>

  <p>"There remained the stiff fence of collecting the ransom, when Cross
  banked on being chosen as go-between. Then the gang could cache the diamonds
  while arranging to smuggle them across to the Continent. They could take
  their time and realize their fortune gradually, as they still had funds in
  hand from Goya.</p>

  <p>"From then on, they had chiefly to avoid being suspected. The major has
  confessed to his share of the plot, so we know the connecting links. As a
  matter of fact, his nerve had crashed, and he was about to bale out. He will
  get off with a term of imprisonment, but the other three will swing.</p>

  <p>"Now for the tidying up of the plot. Goya was bumped off by the removal of
  the lamp on the bridge&mdash;and her chauffeur was lucky not to share her
  fate. Beatrice was to join the legion of 'Lost Girls.' They had worked out a
  neat method to obliterate her, while the parents were to hope on. By the time
  they called the police in, any trail would be stone cold.</p>

  <p>"The major had to destroy the evidence of the door cut in the wall between
  16 and 17. He did this that night by jagging the straight outline to simulate
  a hole torn in the plaster. The original chunks they had hacked from the wall
  had been carefully kept, and when these were piled on the floor they bore out
  his story of a too-heavy mirror.</p>

  <p>"Directly afterwards, the builder was to convert the three rooms into
  office accommodation and thus remove the last shred of evidence.</p>

  <p>"Now I must explain how they worked the first 'disappearance' on which the
  success of the kidnapping depended. Pearce swore he saw Evelyn go upstairs
  and declared that she never came down. Why?</p>

  <p>"The reason was this. She never came in. And since I've got to sell you
  the idea you are marrying a smart detective, that was the first point I tried
  to establish. I was suspicious because of Evelyn asking for a light&mdash;but
  Pearce was so convinced that he had watched her go up the stairs, that I had
  to accept his story.</p>

  <p>"The major has told me of an incident which slipped the porter's memory.
  After the cigarette was lit, Evelyn asked him to investigate the rear of the
  car. That was her signal to nip back in the car and hide under the seat. At
  the same moment, Power slipped out of the major's flat into the entrance
  hall. Pearce could see her back through the glass panes of the door, as she
  stood talking to the two men&mdash;Cross and the major. He was completely
  taken in because she wore the same black outfit as Evelyn. Her blonde hair
  was now hanging down her back and she was smoking a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"When she reached the landing, she was out of his range of vision. So she
  was able to slip into her own flat, pull a tweed suit over the black costume
  and thick stockings over her silk ones, knot up her hair and put on stout
  shoes. Her smart high-heeled shoes were the only thing which might connect
  her with the incident&mdash;in case the detective who was called in insisted
  on searching her apartment. That was why she slipped them inside the clock
  case, where&mdash;if found&mdash;they could not be traced to her.</p>

  <p>"The major tells me he posted the black suit to an imaginary address that
  night. Then Evelyn lay low at Starfish Avenue. She must have been thrilled
  when they phoned her to return to Cross' flat the night of her murder...
  Well, she got a grand time on the voyage...</p>

  <p>"Now about my part&mdash;From the first, I felt something was fishy. But
  while the story of a vanishing girl was preposterous, I could see no ulterior
  motive. Fortunately, I jotted down my first impressions of the people in the
  case.</p>

  <p>"This memory trap first put me on the trail. I had written down Power as
  'solid,' while she was slender. You suggested she was wearing one suit over
  another, confirming my own guess. My second comment was that you had a
  'property bias.' Now, in view of the admitted national respect for property,
  it struck me that No. 16 might have been deliberately redecorated on an
  expensive scale&mdash;to save it from being broken up again.</p>

  <p>"By now, other things were beginning to stick out, but I told you about
  those before. Power was leading me to suspect a general conspiracy. I lumped
  together the major, Goya, Power, Pearce and the typist&mdash;'Marlene.' If I
  hadn't fallen for you, I should have included Viola Green.</p>

  <p>"Pearce, of course, had a clean sheet and Marlene was only the major's
  stooge. He gave her a white coat and invited her to tea on the afternoon
  Beatrice vanished. As he was boss, they had to be careful not to advertise
  their flirtation, and he told her to come down the back stair and wait for
  him at the basement lobby. There were some crowded offices opposite, and he
  banked on someone getting a glimpse of a white coat.</p>

  <p>"Well, my general suspicions got me nowhere. A conspiracy had to include
  Cross, and I could not see where he could fit in. I was up against the fact
  that his own daughter had been murdered. I remembered, too, that the shock of
  her disappearance had turned his hair white. It was logical for me to accept
  his grief as genuine because I had been with him when his friend&mdash;Nell
  Gaynor&mdash;was killed. He broke down completely and shed real tears.</p>

  <p>"In the end, Nell opened my eyes. When she blundered into the plot at the
  time, she helped to whitewash him further. You could see her genuine
  affection for him which he returned... Criminals are often soft over their
  mothers or their old flames, while sensible women are fools over criminals. I
  expect, when Nell was a small girl, she invested the big bad boy with
  glamour.</p>

  <p>"Cross was worried lest she should gossip about him and his private
  affairs to Mrs. Stirling's former secretary at the American Club. To stop all
  danger of leakage, he phoned Bergman to fix up an 'accident' to the
  secretary. But Bergman decided to stop gossip at the source&mdash;Nell. He
  probably identified her by bringing her a fictitious message from Cross.</p>

  <p>"By a stroke of justice, Nell avenged her murder. If you remember, she was
  blunt to rudeness. When they met he remarked that she had not changed, which
  I suspect was masculine flattery. Now what was her own comment? She did not
  say, 'Well, you have. What's happened to your hair?' or something like that.
  That sort of remark would have been in character. Instead she said, 'Neither
  have you.' And then she went on to criticize his clothes and expose his
  age.</p>

  <p>"I realized then that when she had last seen him, his hair was white, and
  that he had dyed it for his London visit. It could not have been done to
  acquire glamour for, in that case, he would not have washed it out again.
  That didn't make sense.</p>

  <p>"No, it was deliberately planned so that his sham grief over his
  daughter's loss should carry conviction and stamp him as a genuine distracted
  parent. But what he counted on as a master stroke of strategy proved the
  actual link which connected him with the conspiracy.</p>

  <p>"It was Nell who upset his apple cart, when she practically told me that
  his hair had not turned white from shock. Such calculated cunning to register
  emotion suddenly revealed him in a new light&mdash;I saw him not as a
  splendid figure, with warm and generous impulses, but as a cold-blooded
  criminal. The Raphael Cross I knew had faded into air."</p>
