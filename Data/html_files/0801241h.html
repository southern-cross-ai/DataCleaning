<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">OUTSIDE, where dawn was just dispelling the
fog-wisps from the South Pacific waters, the sea was calm, but a
typhoon was raging in the cabin of the <i>Saucy Wench</i>. Most of
the thunder was supplied by Captain Harrigan&mdash;vociferous
oratory, charged with brimstone and sulphur, punctuated with
resounding bangs of a hairy fist on the table across which he was
bellowing damnation and destruction at Raquel O'Shane, who screamed
back at him. Between them they were making so much noise they did
not hear the sudden shouting that burst forth on deck.</p>

<p>"<i>Shut up!</i>" bawled the captain. He was broad as a door and
his undershirt revealed a chest and arms muscled and hairy as an
ape's. A growth of whiskers bristled his jaws, and his eyes blazed.
He was a spectacle to daunt any woman, even if she had not known
him as Bully Harrigan, smuggler, blackbirder, pearl-thief and
pirate, when opportunity offered itself.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" he repeated. "One more yap out of you, you
Spanish-Irish gutter-snipe, and I'll bend one on your jaw!"</p>

<p>Being a man of primal impulses, he demonstrated his meaning by a
fervent swipe of a mallet-like fist, which Raquel dodged with the
agility of much practice. She was slim and supple, with foamy black
hair, dark eyes that blazed with deviltry, and an ivory-tinted
skin, heritage of her mixed Celtic-Latin blood, that made men's
heads swim at first sight. Her figure agitated by her movements,
was a poem of breath-taking grace.</p>

<p>"Pig!" she screamed. "Don't you dare lay a finger on me!" This
was purely rhetorical; Harrigan had laid a finger on her more than
once during the past weeks, to say nothing of whole fists, belaying
pins, and rope's ends. But she was still untamed.</p>

<p>She too banged the table and cursed in three languages.</p>

<p>"You've treated me like a dog all the way from Brisbane!" she
raged. "Getting tired of me, are you, after taking me away from a
good job in San Francisco&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> took you&mdash;" The enormity of the accusation choked
the captain. "Why, you Barbary Coast hussy, the first time I ever
saw you was that night you climbed aboard as we were pullin' out
and begged me on your blasted knees to take you to sea and save you
from the cops, account of your knifin' a Wop in that Water Street
honky-tonk where you were workin', you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you call me that!" she shrieked, doing a war-dance. "All
I did in that joint was dance! And I've played square with you, and
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now I'm sick of your tantrums," quoth Harrigan, downing a
horse-sized snort from a square-faced bottle. "They're too much
even for a good-hearted swab like me. As soon as we raise a
civilized port, I'm goin' to kick you off onto the docks. And you
give me any more lip, and I'll sell you to the first Kanaka chief I
meet, you blasted hell-cat!"</p>

<p>That set her off again, like a match to the fuse of a
sky-rocket. She hit the roof, and for a few moments the cabin was
so full of impassioned feminine profanity it even drowned out
Harrigan's roars.</p>

<p>"And where are we heading?" she demanded, remembering another
grievance. "I want to know! The crew wants to know! You've told us
nothing since we left Brisbane! We've picked up no cargo, and now
we've gotten into these God-forsaken seas where none of us knows
where we are, except you, and all you do is guzzle booze and study
the blasted chart!"</p>

<p>She snatched it from the table and brandished it accusingly.</p>

<p>"Gimme that!" he bellowed, grabbing wildly. She jumped back
agilely, sensing it was precious to him, and woman-like seizing the
advantage.</p>

<p>"I won't! Not till you promise to quit knocking me around! Get
back! I'll throw it out the port-hole if you come any closer!" Her
rapid breathing, her agitation, made her loveliness devastating,
but for the moment, he had no eyes for that.</p>

<p>With a frantic roar Harrigan lunged, upsetting the table with a
crash. Raquel had raised a bigger hurricane than she had expected
or intended. She squealed in alarm and leaped back, the chart
waving wildly in her hand.</p>

<p>"Gimme that!" It was the howl of a lost soul. Harrigan's hair
stood straight up and his eyes bulged. Raquel yelped with terror,
too confused to make her peace by delivering the article requested.
She sprang backward, tripped over a chair and fell on her back,
with a shriek and an involuntary abandon that tossed her bare
ivory-tinted legs revealingly skyward. But Harrigan was blind to
this entrancing display. For as she fell, her arm, thrown out
wildly, propelled the chart through the air; and as the Devil
always controls such things, it sailed through the open
port-hole.</p>

<p>Harrigan tore his hair and rushed for the port-hole. On deck an
ear-splitting racket had burst suddenly forth but the occupants of
the cabin ignored it. Harrigan, glaring pop-eyed from the
port-hole, was just in time to see the chart vanish on its way to
Davy Jones's locker, and his agonized howl paled all his previous
efforts&mdash;so much so that out in the passageway the bos'n, who
had just reached the cabin door in breathless haste, turned tail,
and fled back the way he had come. Raquel had risen, in
apprehensive silence, and was making some necessary adjustments in
her garments. Her lovely eyes dilated at the red glare in
Harrigan's eyes as he wheeled toward her.</p>

<p>"You threw that away on purpose!" he choked. "A million dollars
right through the damn port-hole! I'll fix you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lunged and she skipped back with a squeal, but not quickly
enough. His huge paw closed on a shoulder-strap. There was a
shriek, a ripping sound, and Raquel fled toward the door minus the
dress which remained in Harrigan's hand. He was after her
instantly, but panic winged her small feet. She beat him to the
door and slammed it in his face, and even tried to hold it against
him until convinced of her folly by a big fist which, crashing
through the panels, grazed her dainty nose, filling her eyes with
stars and tears. She yipped pitifully, abandoned the door, and fled
up the companion-way, a startling figure in slippers and pink
chemise.</p>

<p>After her came Captain Harrigan, a bellowing, red-eyed, hairy
monstrosity whose only passion was to sweep the deck from poop to
forecastle with that supple, half-naked body.</p>

<p>In their different emotions of fright and fury they were not,
even then, aware of the clamor going on upon the deck, until they
came full on a scene so unique it even checked Harrigan short in
his tracks.</p>

<p>Not so Raquel; she scampered across the deck, unnoticed by the
mob milling in the waist, and sprang into the main shrouds before
she turned and stared at the spectacle which had halted
Harrigan.</p>

<p>Hemmed in by a ring of blaspheming seamen the mate, Buck
Richardson, was locked in combat with a stranger whose breeches
(his only garment) dripped sea-water. That Mr. Richardson should be
battling a stranger was not unique; what was unique was that Mr.
Richardson, the terror of a thousand ports, bucko deluxe and hazer
extraordinary, was getting the prime essence of hell beaten out of
him. His opponent was as big as he&mdash;a broad-shouldered,
clean-waisted, heavy-armed man with wetly plastered black hair,
blue eyes that blazed with the joy of mayhem, and lips that grinned
savagely even when, as now, they were smeared with blood.</p>

<p>He fought with gusto that horrified even his hard-boiled
audience. Continually he plunged in, head down, not blindly like a
bull, but with his eyes open&mdash;except the one the mate had
closed&mdash;hammering the luckless bucko like a blacksmith
pounding an anvil. Richardson was bleeding like a stuck pig, and
spitting pieces of broken teeth. He was blowing like a porpoise and
in his one good eye there was a desperate gleam.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" demanded Harrigan aghast. "Where'd he come
from?"</p>

<p>"We sighted him just as the fog lifted," said the bos'n,
spitting carefully to leeward. "He was driftin' along in a open
boat, balin' and cussin' somethin' fierce. His boat sunk under him
before he could get it to the ship, and he swum for it. A shark
tried to scoff him on the way, but he kicked its brains out or bit
it in the neck, or done somethin' atrocious to it. That's Wild Bill
Clanton!"</p>

<p>"The hell it is!" grunted the captain, staring with new
interest. Then he swore as Clanton bashed Mr. Richardson on the
snout with appalling results. "They're bleedin' all over my clean
deck!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the bos'n, "as soon as he clumb over the rail he
seen the mate and went for him. From the remarks they passed before
they was too winded to cuss, I gathered that Buck stole a gal from
Clanton once. I went after you, but you seemed busy, so I just let
'em fight."</p>

<p>Bam! Mr. Clanton's left mauler met Mr. Richardson's midriff with
an impact that sounded like the smack of a loose boom against a wet
sail. Bam! A mallet-like right-hander to the jaw and Mr. Richardson
went reeling backward and brought up against the rail with a crack
that would have fractured the skull of anybody except a bucko mate
on a trading schooner.</p>

<p>Clanton went for him with a blood-thirsty yell&mdash;then his
eyes encountered Raquel, poised in the ratlines. He stopped short,
batted his eyes, his mouth wide open as he glared wildly at the
ivory-tinted vision posed against the blue, in a sheer wisp of pink
silk that tempted even as it concealed little.</p>

<p>"Holy saints of Hell!" breathed Clanton in awe&mdash;and at this
instant Mr. Richardson, a bloody ruin, lurched away from the rail
with a belaying pin. Bam! It crashed on Clanton's head and that
warrior bit the deck. Mr. Richardson croaked gratefully and
bestowed himself lovingly on his victim's bosom, naively intent on
beating his brains out with his trusty belaying pin. But Clanton
anticipated his design by drawing up his legs, after the manner of
a panther fighting on its back, and, receiving the hurtling mate on
his feet and knees, he catapulted Mr. Richardson over his head.</p>

<p>The mate smote the deck headfirst and reverberantly, and this
time the impact was too much even for his adamantine skull. But
Clanton, bounding up, observed some faint signs of life still, and
sought to correct this oversight by leaping ardently and with both
feet on the mate's bosom.</p>

<p>"Grab him!" yelled Harrigan. "He's killin' the mate!"</p>

<p>As no spectacle could have pleased the crew better than Mr.
Richardson's violent demise, they made no move to obey. Harrigan
ran forward blasphemously and tugging forth an enormous revolver
thrust it under the nose of Mr. Clanton who eyed it and its owner
without favor.</p>

<p>"Are you the cap'n of this mud-scow?" Clanton demanded.</p>

<p>"I am, by God!" gnashed Mr. Harrigan. "I'm Bully Harrigan! What
are you doin' on board my ship?"</p>

<p>"I've been keepin' a damned sieve of a boat afloat for a day and
a night," retorted the other. "I was mate aboard the
<i>Damnation</i>, out of Bristol. The cap'n didn't like Americans.
After I won his share of the cargo at draw poker, he welshed and
put me afloat&mdash;with the aid of the crew."</p>

<p>Harrigan broodingly visualized the battle that must have
required!</p>

<p>"Carry the mate to his bunk and bring him to," he ordered the
men. "And for you, Clanton, you'll work for your passage! Get
for'ard!"</p>

<p>Clanton ignored the command. He was again staring at the vision
clinging to the ratlines. Raquel peeped at him approvingly, noting
the clean-cut muscular symmetry that was his.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" he inquired, and all turned to stare. Harrigan
roared like a sea-lion with awakened memory.</p>

<p>"Drag her down!" he yelled. "Tie her to the mast!
I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't touch me!" shrieked Raquel. "I'll jump and drown
myself!"</p>

<p>She didn't mean that, but she sounded as though she did. Clanton
reached the rail with a tigerish bound, caught her wrist, and
whipped her down onto the deck before she knew what was
happening.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she gasped, staring at him with dilated eyes. He was
bronzed by the sun of the Seven Seas, and his torso was ridged with
clean hard cords of muscles. In fierce admiration his gaze devoured
her from her trim ankles to the foamy burnished mass of her
hair.</p>

<p>"Good work, Clanton!" roared Harrigan, striding forward. "Hold
her!" Raquel wailed despairfully, but Harrigan, reaching for her,
had his hand knocked aside, and he paused and goggled stupidly at
Clanton.</p>

<p>"Avast!" roared Clanton gustily. "That's no way to treat a
lady!"</p>

<p>"Lady, hell!" bleated Harrigan. "Do you know what she just did?
Threw away my chart! The only dash-blank chart in the world that
could show me how to find the island of Aragoa!"</p>

<p>"Was we goin' there, cap'n?" asked the bos'n.</p>

<p>"Yes, we was!" yelled Harrigan. "And what for? I'll tell you!
Ambegis. A barrel full! At thirty-two dollars an ounce! You
bilge-rats been grousin' to know where we were sailin' to&mdash;all
right, I'll tell you! And then I'm goin' to tie that wench up and
skin her stern with a rope's end!</p>

<p>"A few months ago a blackbirder bound for Australia went on a
reef in a storm, off a desert island, and nobody but the mate got
ashore alive. They'd found a mess of the stuff floatin' on the
water, and filled a big barrel with it&mdash;and it floated ashore
with him. The mate stood the solitude of the island as long as he
could, and then took to sea in the ship's boat he'd patched up.
He'd salvaged a chart and marked the island's position. He'd been
weeks at sea when I picked him up, on my last voyage from Honolulu
to Brisbane. He was ravin' and let slip about the ambergris&mdash;I
mean he was that grateful to me for savin' him he told me all about
it, and gimme the chart for safekeepin', and right after that he
got delirious and fell overboard and drowned&mdash;"</p>

<p>Somebody laughed sardonically and Harrigan glared murderously
around.</p>

<p>"He called the island Aragoa," he growled. "It ain't on no other
chart. And now that the daughter of Jezebel has fed that chart to
the sharks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, hell!" quoth Clanton. "Is that all? Why, I can steer you
to Aragoa without any blasted chart! I've been there a dozen
times!"</p>

<p>Harrigan started and looked at him searchingly.</p>

<p>"Are you lyin'?"</p>

<p>"Belay with those insults!" said Clanton heatedly. "I won't take
you anywhere unless you promise not to punish the girl."</p>

<p>"All right," snarled Harrigan, and Raquel sighed in relief.
"But!" brandishing his gun in Clanton's face, "if you're lyin',
I'll feed you to the sharks! Take the wheel and lay a course for
Aragoa. You don't leave the poop till we raise land!"</p>

<p>"I've got to have food," growled Clanton.</p>

<p>"Tell it to the cook. Then get hold of that wheel." Reminded
suddenly of Raquel's lightly-clad condition he roared: "Get below
and get some clothes on, you shameless slut!"</p>

<p>A heavy toe emphasized the command by a direct hit astern, and
she fled squeaking for the companion.</p>

<p>Clanton scowled, descended into the galley, and bullied the
Chinese cook into setting out a feed that would have taxed the
capacity of a horse. Having disposed of this, he swaggered up the
poop ladder and took the wheel. The men watched him with interest,
which was shared by Raquel, peeping from the companion. She had
heard of him: who in the South Seas had not? A wild adventurer
roaring on a turbulent career that included everything from
pearl-diving to piracy, he was a man at least, not a beast like
Harrigan.</p>

<p>Her flesh tingled deliciously with the feel of his strong grasp
on her rounded arm; she was consumed with eagerness for more
intimate contact with him, but the opportunity did not come until
night had fallen and the powerful figure stood in solitary grandeur
at the wheel.</p>

<p>His shoulders bulked against the South Sea stars as he held the
schooner to her course; he might have posed for the image of
intrepid exploration until a slender figure glided up the poop
ladder.</p>

<p>"Does Harrigan know you're out here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"He sleeps like a pig," she answered, her great dark eyes sad
and wistful in the starlight. "He <i>is</i> a pig." She whimpered a
little and leaned against him as if seeking pity and
protection.</p>

<p>"Poor kid," he said with grand compassion, slipping a protecting
arm about her waist&mdash;the paternal effect of which was somewhat
marred by his patting of the swelling slope of a firm hip. A
luxurious shudder ran through her supple body and she snuggled
closer within the bend of his muscular arm and pressed her cheek
against his shoulder.</p>

<p>"What did Harrigan say was the name of that island?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Aragoa!" she jerked her head back and stared at him, startled.
"I thought you said you knew about it!"</p>

<p>"Never heard of it!" he declared. "I just said that to save
you!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" she stood aghast. "What will we do when he finds out you
lied?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," he answered. "We're in a jam that requires thought
and concentration. Sneak down and steal me a few bottles of
Harrigan's booze."</p>

<p>She cast him an uncertain glance, but moved away down the
ladder, softly as an ivory-hued shadow, to return presently with an
arm-ful of darkly gleaming bottles that made Clanton's eyes
glisten. He lashed the wheel, casually sighting at a star on the
horizon, and sat down by the rail.</p>

<p>"Set 'em down here," he requested, and when she complied, he
grabbed her before she could straighten and pulled her down on his
lap. For convention's sake she struggled faintly for a moment, and
then her arms went convulsively around his corded neck, and she
gave him her full red lips in a kiss that he felt clear to the tips
of his toes.</p>

<p>"Judas!" During the entire course of a roving life he had never
encountered a human volcano like this before. He shook his head to
clear the swimming brain, took a deep breath and dived. When he
came up for air, she was gasping too, quivering from the dynamic
impact of his kisses.</p>

<p>Contentedly he knocked the neck off the bottle, took a deep swig
and held it to her lips. She merely sipped; the night was still
young, and she needed no alcoholic stimulant to drive the hot blood
racing through her veins. It was already breaking all speed
records.</p>

<p>Clanton did not need any stimulants either; but drank because he
was thirsty; because liquor was to him what moonlight and perfume
are to some men. At each swig he gulped as though he were trying to
see the bottom.</p>

<p>By the time he had tossed an empty overboard he was saying: "To
hell with Harrigan! If he gets gay with me, I'll kick his teeth
out! I don't believe there's any such damn' place as Aragoa,
anyway!"</p>

<p>"Who cares?" she breathed, leaning her supple back against his
breast, and lifting her arms up and back to encircle his brawny
neck. He ran an appreciative hand over a warm, rounded shoulder,
and let his other hand rest on a knee.</p>

<p class="cpb">* * *</p>

<p>Just as grey dawn stole over the sea, a terrific shock ran
through the <i>Saucy Wench</i>. There was a crash in the galley,
blasphemy in the forecastle, as men fell out of their bunks. The
schooner lurched drunkenly&mdash;and remained motionless, with a
list to starboard. Preceded by a blue-streaked haze of profanity
Harrigan came hurtling from the companion and pranced up the poop
ladder in his drawers.</p>

<p>"What the blitherin' hell?" he screamed. "My God, we're
aground!"</p>

<p>From a litter of empty bottles Clanton rose unsteadily,
stretched, yawned, spat and stared appreciatively at the
jungle-fringed beach which&mdash;with only a narrow strip of
shallow water between&mdash;stretched away from under the port
bow.</p>

<p>"There's your island, Bully!" he announced with a magnificent
gesture.</p>

<p>Harrigan tore his hair and howled like a wolf. "Did you have to
run her onto the beach, you son of a slut?"</p>

<p>"That could have happened to anybody," asserted Clanton, and
added reprovingly: "Where's your pants?"</p>

<p>But the captain had seen the broken bottles, and his howl had
all the poignancy of a stricken soul. Then he saw something else.
Raquel, awakened by the noise, rose uncertainly, rubbing her eyes
childishly. She made a face, tasting again all the square-face she
had guzzled the night before.</p>

<p>Harrigan turned purple; his arm windmilled, to the fascination
of the crew who watched from the deck below. He found words, lurid
and frenetic.</p>

<p>"You stole my liquor!" he roared. "You had my girl here all
night! You've run my ship aground, and by God, I'm goin' to kill
you, ambergris or no ambergris!"</p>

<p>He reached for his gun, only to discover that he wore neither
gun nor belt. Bellowing he snatched a belaying pin from the rail
and made at Clanton who smote him with such effect that the
captain's head fractured the binnacle as his whole body performed a
parabola backward.</p>

<p>At this moment a frightful figure appeared at the head of the
starboard ladder&mdash;Mr. Richardson, bedecked in bandages, and
with one good eye gleaming eerily. Not even such a beating as he'd
received yesterday could long keep a true bucko in his bunk. In his
hand was a revolver, and this he fired point-blank. But Mr.
Richardson's one good eye was bleared, and his aim was not good.
His bullet merely burned a welt across Clanton's ribs, and before
he could fire again, Clanton's foot, striking his breastbone with
great violence, catapulted him headlong down the ladder at the foot
of which his head again met the deck with a force that rendered him
temporarily <i>hors-de-combat</i>.</p>

<p>But Captain Harrigan had seized the opportunity to flee down the
port ladder yelling: "Gimme my gun! I'll shoot 'em both!"</p>

<p>"Overboard!" yelled Clanton to Raquel, and then as she
hesitated, he grabbed her around the waist, tossed her over the
rail, and leaped after her.</p>

<p>The plunge into the water snapped her out of her hangover; she
screamed, gasped, and then struck out for the beach, followed by
Clanton. They reached it just as Harrigan appeared on the poop with
a triumphant howl and a Winchester, with which he opened up on them
as they raced across the sands and dived into the trees.</p>

<p>Under cover Clanton paused and looked back. The antics of
Harrigan on the poop moved him to hearty guffaws, smiting his
dripping thigh. Raquel glared at him, wringing out her skirt, and
raking back a wet strand of hair.</p>

<p>"What's so funny about being marooned?" she demanded
angrily.</p>

<p>He spanked her jocosely and replied: "Don't worry, kid. When the
schooner sails, we'll be on her. You stay here and watch 'em while
I go inland and look for fruit and fresh water. She's not stuck
bad; they can warp her off."</p>

<p>"All right." She shucked her wet dress and hung it up to dry,
while she lay down on her stomach on the soft dry sand to peer
through the bushes at the ship. She made an alluring picture thus,
her pink chemise dripping from their submersion, fitting her
tighter than a glove. Clanton admired the view for a moment, and
then departed through the trees, striding lightly and softly for so
big a man.</p>

<p>Raquel lay there, watching the men piling into boats, with
hawsers, where presently they were employed in yanking the schooner
loose, stern-first, by main strength and profanity. But it was slow
work. The sun rose, and Raquel got impatient. She was hungry and
very, very thirsty.</p>

<p>She donned her dress, now dry, and started out to look for
Clanton. The trees were denser than she had thought, and she soon
lost sight of the beach. Presently she had to climb over a big log,
and when she leaped down on the other side, a bramble bush caught
up her skirt, twisting it high about her ivory thighs. She twisted
about in vain, unable to reach the clinging branch or to free her
skirt.</p>

<p>As she squirmed and swore, a light step sounded behind her, and
without looking around she commanded, "Bill, untangle me!"</p>

<p>Obligingly a firm masculine hand grasped her skirt and freed it
from the branch, by the simple process of raising it several
inches. But her rescuer did not then lower the garment; indeed
Raquel felt him pull it up even higher&mdash;much higher!</p>

<p>"Quit clowning," she requested, turning her head&mdash;and then
she opened her lovely mouth to its widest extent and emitted a yell
that startled the birds in the trees. The man who was holding her
skirt in such an indelicate position was not Clanton. He was a big
Kanaka in breech-clout. Raquel made a convulsive effort to escape,
but a big brown arm encircled her supple waist. In an instant the
peaceful glade was a hurricane-center, punctuated by lusty shrieks
that a big hand clapped over red-lipped mouth could not altogether
stifle.</p>

<p>Clanton heard those screams as he glided like a big bronzed
tiger toward the beach. They acted on him like a jolt of
electricity. The next instant he was in full career through the
jungle, leaving behind him a sizzling wake of profanity. Crashing
through the bushes, he burst full onto a scene, striking in its
primitive simplicity.</p>

<p>Raquel was defending her virtue as vigorously as civilized
nations defend mythical possessions. Her dress had been torn half
off and her white body and limbs contrasted vividly with the brown
skin of her captor. He wasn't all brown, though; he was red in
spots, for she had bitten him freely. So much so that irritation
entered into his ardor, and, momentarily abandoning his efforts to
subdue her by more pleasant means, he drew back an enormous fist
for a clout calculated to waft her into dreamland.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Clanton arrived on the scene and his
bare foot, describing a terrific arc, caught the Kanaka under his
haunches and somersaulted him clear over his captive, who scurried
to her protector on her all-fours.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you to stay on the beach?" <i>Wham</i>! In his
irritation Clanton emphasized his reproof with a resounding,
open-handed slap where he could reach her easiest. Raquel's shriek
was drowned in a vengeful roar. The Kanaka had regained his feet
and was bounding toward them, swinging a knotty-headed war club he
had leaned against a tree when he stole up on Raquel.</p>

<p>He lunged with a yell and a swing that would have spattered
Clanton's brains all over the glade if it had landed. But it
flailed empty air as Clanton left his feet in a headlong dive that
carried him under the swipe and crashed his shoulders against the
Kanaka's legs. Bam! They hit the earth together and the club flew
out of the native's hand.</p>

<p>The next instant they were rolling all over the glade in a
desperate dog-fight, gouging and slugging. Then Clanton, in the
midst of their frantic revolutions, perceived that Raquel had
secured the club and was dancing about, trying to get a swipe at
his antagonist. Clanton, knowing the average accuracy of a woman's
aim, was horrified. The Kanaka had him by the throat, trying to
drive thumbs and fingers through the thick cords of muscle that
protected the white man's wind-pipe and jugular, but it was the
risk of being accidentally brained by a wild swipe of Raquel's club
that galvanized Clanton to more desperate energy.</p>

<p>Fighting for an instant's purchase, he drove his knee into the
Kanaka's groin, and the man gasped and doubled convulsively.
Clanton broke away, kicking him heavily in the belly. Surprisingly
the warrior gave a maddened yell, grabbed the foot and twisted it
savagely. Clanton whirled to save himself a broken leg, and fell to
his all-fours. At the same moment Raquel swung the too-heavy club.
She missed as the Kanaka ducked, and she sprawled on her belly in
the sand. Both men gained their feet simultaneously, but the Kanaka
reached for the club. As he bent over Clanton swung his right
over-hand like a hammer and with about the same effect. It crashed
behind the Kanaka's ear with the impact of a caulking maul. The
Kanaka stretched out in the sand without a quiver.</p>

<p>Raquel leaped up and threw herself hysterically in Clanton's
arms. He shook her loose, with lurid language.</p>

<p>"No time for a pettin' party! There's a whole village of the
illegitimates over toward the other side of the island. I saw it!
Come on!" He grabbed her wrist and fled toward the beach with her,
panting: "Thick brush, men cussin' on the ship. They wouldn't hear
the racket we've made&mdash;I hope." She didn't ask why. She
clutched her tattered dress about her as she ran.</p>

<p>They burst onto the beach, and saw that the <i>Saucy Wench</i>
was afloat; she was anchored in clear water off the shore, and
Harrigan was oiling his rifle on the poop, with the be-bandaged
Richardson beside him.</p>

<p>"Ahoy!" yelled Clanton from behind a tree. "Harrigan! I've found
your ambergris!"</p>

<p>Harrigan started violently and glared, head-down like a surly
bear.</p>

<p>"What's that? Where are you? Show yourself!"</p>

<p>"And get shot? Like hell! But I'll make a trade with you. I've
hidden the stuff where you'll never find it. But I'll lead you to
it if you'll promise to take us aboard and put us ashore at some
civilized port!"</p>

<p>"You fool!" whispered Raquel, kicking his shins. "He'll promise
anything, and then shoot us when he's got the loot!"</p>

<p>But Harrigan was bellowing back across the strip of blue
water.</p>

<p>"All right! Let bygones be bygones! I'm comin' ashore!"</p>

<p>A few moments later a boat was making for the beach. Raquel
danced in her nervousness; her torn dress revealed flashing
expanses of ivory flesh.</p>

<p>"Are you crazy? They'll kill us! And that native you knocked out
will come to and get his tribe and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He grinned and stepped out on the beach, pulling her with
him.</p>

<p>"They won't shoot us till I show them the ambergris! I'll take
Harrigan inland; you wait here at the boat. And let me do the
talkin'!"</p>

<p>She was not in the habit of meekly taking orders, but she lapsed
into sulky and bewildered silence. She was badly scared.</p>

<p>Harrigan and Richardson piled out before the boat grounded. The
captain had a Winchester, the mate a shotgun. They covered Clanton
instantly.</p>

<p>"Stay here!" the captain told the half dozen men who had rowed
him ashore. "Now then, Clanton, lead us to that ambergris, and no
tricks!"</p>

<p>"Follow me!" Clanton led them into the jungle while behind at
the boat, Raquel watched with dilated eyes and crawling flesh.</p>

<p>Clanton swung wide of the glade where&mdash;he hoped&mdash;the
Kanaka still lay senseless. Hardly out of sight of the beach he
stumbled over a root and fell. Sitting up he groaned, cursed and
tenderly felt of his ankle.</p>

<p>"Blast the luck! It's broken! You'll have to rig a stretcher and
carry me!"</p>

<p>"Carry you, hell!!" snorted Harrigan. "Tell us where the loot
is, and we'll go on and find it ourselves."</p>

<p>"Go straight on about three hundred yards." groaned Clanton.
"Till you come to a clump of sago-palms. Then turn to the left and
go on till you come to a pool of fresh water. I rolled the barrel
in there."</p>

<p>"All right," grunted Harrigan. "And if we don't find it, we'll
shoot you when we get back."</p>

<p>"And we're goin' to shoot you whether we find it or not!"
snarled Richardson. "That's why we left the men on the
beach&mdash;didn't want no witnesses! And we're goin' to leave that
wench to starve here with your skeleton when we sail. How you like
<i>that</i>, huh?"</p>

<p>Clanton registered horrified despair, and both men chortled
brutally as they strode away. They vanished among the trees, and
Clanton waited a minute&mdash;five&mdash;ten&mdash;then he sprang
up and sprinted for the beach.</p>

<p>He burst onto the beach so suddenly the bos'n nearly shot
him.</p>

<p>"Pile in and row for the ship, Quick!" he yelled. "Cannibals!
They've got Harrigan and the mate! Listen!"</p>

<p>Back in the jungle rose a sudden bedlam of shots and
blood-freezing yells. It was enough. No heroic soul proposed a
rescuing sortie. In another instant the boat was scudding for the
schooner. Its occupants swarmed up the side, spurred by the rising
clamor that was approaching through the jungle. Clanton stood on
the poop and yelled orders, and they were obeyed without
question.</p>

<p>The anchor came up with a rush, and the <i>Saucy Wench</i> was
standing out to sea by the time the tribesman danced out on the
beach. They swarmed to the water's edge, three or four hundred of
them, yelling vengefully. One waved a blood-splashed shotgun,
another a broken Winchester.</p>

<p>Clanton grinned; the directions he had given his enemies had led
them accurately&mdash;straight into the native village! He thumbed
his nose at the baffled barbarians on the beach, and turned and
addressed the crew.</p>

<p>"As the only man aboard who can navigate, and owner of the ship,
I'm assuming the position of cap'n! Do I hear any objections?"</p>

<p>The bos'n demanded: "What you mean, owner of ship?"</p>

<p>"Me and Harrigan matched pennies," asserted Clanton. "My share
of the ambergris against the ship. I won."</p>

<p>"What about the ambergris?" demanded a hardy soul.</p>

<p>Clanton nodded back toward the receding beach. "Anybody that
wants to swim back there and fight those boys for it, is welcome to
try!"</p>

<p>In the self-conscious silence that followed, he barked suddenly:
"All right, get to work! Tail onto those lines! There's a breeze
makin' and we're headin' for the Solomons for a load of niggers for
Queensland!"</p>

<p>As the crew jumped briskly, Raquel nudged him.</p>

<p>"You didn't find that ambergris," she said, her eyes ablaze with
admiration. "That wasn't even the right island. That was all a
lie!"</p>

<p>"I doubt if there ever was any ambergris," quoth he. "The fellow
that made that chart was probably crazy. To hell with it!" He
patted her plump hip possessively and added: "I reckon you go with
the ship; that bein' the case I want to see you down in the cap'n's
cabin, right away!"</p>
