  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"But you are going to marry him, Margaret?" There was an
  agitation in the voice of Rex Leferre that almost startled his sister: it
  certainly diverted for the moment the resentment that was growing towards her
  unpunctual fiancé.</p>

  <p>"What makes you say that?" she asked. "Does it mean that I am breaking off
  my engagement because Luke is a bad host and has kept us waiting ten
  minutes?" They were in the Palm Court of the Ritz-Carlton, and the remainder
  of the guests were mercifully occupied with their cocktails and gossip and
  were apparently unaware of Luke's bad manners.</p>

  <p>She stood apart with the young man who was her only relation, and no
  stranger seeing them would imagine them to be brother and sister. Rex was
  red-haired, weak-chinned, a fretful young man with a nervous trick of
  adjusting his dress tie every few minutes.</p>

  <p>Margaret Leferre had the carriage and poise of the great lady. She was
  fair skinned, faultless of feature, grey-eyed&mdash;a model of cold dignity.
  She had never succumbed to the fashion in short hair: her own was braided
  about her head so that she seemed to be wearing a coronet of dull gold.</p>

  <p>"I don't know..." Rex was nibbling at his nails&mdash;he could not be
  cured of this ugly habit. "Only Luke is a good fellow&mdash;in a way. Rather
  a tight-wad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is a tight-wad?" she asked, her steady eyes on his.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I mean&mdash;he's not terribly generous with his own money. He
  gives tips and things, but somehow I've never been able to get into the
  market in time to benefit...my own fault, of course."</p>

  <p>He tried to avoid her gaze, but she was the stronger character. "Have you
  been borrowing money&mdash;again?" she asked, and he wiggled
  uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;what rot! Only Danty and I had a scheme..." She looked round at
  that moment. Somehow she knew that the dark-eyed Danton Morell was watching
  them. Danton was rather a dear, and she had come to rely upon him. He seemed
  to sense her trouble now, and, detaching himself from the group of which he
  was a silent member, made his way towards her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up, Margaret&mdash;don't talk to Morell about it&mdash;if you're
  going to make a scene..." With a shrug he turned and left her as Danty came
  up.</p>

  <p>Danty, that splendid man of the world, was amused at her fears. He was on
  the border-line of forty, a handsome, entertaining bachelor, and she had come
  to know him through Rex.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think he has been borrowing&mdash;Rex is an improvident devil
  who will be broke for the next ten years. Then he will settle down and be
  terribly successful. Your young man is rather late."</p>

  <p>She knew instinctively that he did not like Luke Maddison: she had always
  known this. Luke (she told herself) was rather a prig in his way. He was
  "county"&mdash;was related to or friendly with almost every great family in
  England. Only once had he spoken disparagingly of Danton.</p>

  <p>"Where did he spring from? I've never heard of him before," he asked.</p>

  <p>She might have told him that Danton had spent the greater part of his life
  in the Argentine, but she had stiffened at the disparagement of her brother's
  friend&mdash;and hers. And then Luke had made it worse.</p>

  <p>"He's a rum bird. I shouldn't be surprised if he wasn't one of those
  light-fingered fellows who are known to the police&mdash;if one only made
  enquiries."</p>

  <p>"You had better make enquiries," she said icily.</p>

  <p>This was before she had taken the plunge and had sent an ecstatic Luke
  Maddison back to his house walking on air.</p>

  <p>As she listened to Danton she was looking absently at the solitaire
  diamond ring which was the outward and visible sign of her engagement.</p>

  <p>"...Rex is volatile and a bit unstable&mdash;sometimes there is nothing
  too bad he can say about Maddison. Sometimes nothing too good...hullo, here's
  our blessed host!"</p>

  <p>Luke Maddison came through the vestibule with long strides. He paused to
  strip his overcoat and take off his silk hat, which he almost threw at an
  attendant, and took one step towards the door. As he did so, his foot slipped
  sideways on the marble floor, and he would have fallen unpleasantly but for
  the hand that suddenly gripped his arm.</p>

  <p>The man who held him must have been unusually strong, for he literally,
  and in the most effortless fashion, lifted Luke Maddison bodily and placed
  him on his feet.</p>

  <p>Luke turned with a half-smile of dismay and found himself looking into a
  hard, lined face, the colour of teak&mdash;into two unsmiling eyes,
  expressionless.</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;awfully!" The stranger nodded. "It might have been a very
  nasty fall. I'm greatly obliged to you!"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said the unknown.</p>

  <p>He was in evening kit, a perfectly fitted man: you saw the ghost of an
  efficient valet behind him. Maddison saw lines in the face which were not
  entirely nature's handiwork. He could not know that the two scars which
  disfigured the right cheek of his helper were souvenirs of an encounter with
  the late Lew Selinski of New York City. Lew used a knife when he was annoyed,
  and he had been very annoyed with the well-dressed man when he had left his
  mark upon his enemy's face.</p>

  <p>"I am glad I was here. Fortunately, I always wait in the lobby when I am
  expecting people to dinner. Good night." He half turned away as though he
  objected to the attention he had called to himself, and Luke went in to his
  party full of apologies.</p>

  <p>Two lives touched at the Ritz-Carlton that January night&mdash;touched and
  went looping away one from the other, to touch again in a moment of crisis.
  Rough roads they were: a bitter, heart-aching road for one, a methodical hell
  for the less favoured, to be tramped with that cynical smile with which
  "Gunner" Haynes met every misfortune.</p>

  <p>Luke Maddison saw life like that&mdash;a bewildering mass of crossing and
  parallel paths. If he fell into error it was in believing that his own was
  the straight-as-a-ruler highway to which and from which all others inclined
  or diverged.</p>

  <p>Eight generations of gentlemen bankers, all gently bred and belonging to
  the class which produces statesmen and commanders by divine right of
  appointment, were responsible for his wealth and his six feet of goodly
  looking humanity. He was fair, blue-eyed, straight of back, in his happier
  moments irresponsible. He was extravagant, a free spender of money and an
  idealist, which means that he was spendthrift of the material which keeps men
  in the City solid and comfortable.</p>

  <p>Something of a gambler, he took chances at which his more conservative
  friends might shudder. Yet, as somebody said, "with half a million of
  gilt-edged securities on deposit, who could not gamble to a ten per cent
  margin?"</p>

  <p>"Gunner" Haynes, whose strong arm had saved him from a fractured wrist or
  worse, had no collateral worth speaking about. His principal assets were an
  immaculate dress suit, a cultured voice, perfect manners, which more than
  overcame the handicap represented by his lean, dark, sinister face. He lived
  God knew where, but was to be seen at such of the best hotels as did not know
  him for an expert jewel thief.</p>

  <p>They called him "Gunner" because of certain happenings in New York City.
  It was said, but never proved, that he was the man who bumped off Lew
  Selinski, that notorious gang leader, and shot his way through Lew's gunmen
  to the safety represented by a cattle boat which sailed from the Hudson River
  an hour after the police reserves answered a riot call.</p>

  <p>Nobody had ever seen him with a pistol in England; but the detectives who
  arrested him a year after his return to his native land fully expected gun
  play and came armed.</p>

  <p>When he came up for trial, nobody came near him: not his pretty wife or
  his best friend, Larry Vinman. Larry was a prince of confidence men, young,
  good-looking, plausible. There might be excellent reason why Larry should not
  wish to draw attention to himself by appearing in court; no reason why Lila
  should not write or do something.</p>

  <p>She had a thousand pounds in hard cash; a good lawyer could have been
  briefed; but when the Gunner sent for her, she had left the lodging they had
  occupied. He never saw her again. A few months before his release from prison
  he heard that she had died in a workhouse infirmary.</p>

  <p>The Gunner's smile when he heard this was a grim one. He always smiled
  when he was hurt&mdash;and as he smiled now, his heart was one great
  throbbing wound.</p>

  <p>So he came from prison, and in due course to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, where
  Mr Luke Maddison was celebrating his engagement. Of Luke he knew
  nothing&mdash;what had brought him there was a jewel box which a rich
  American lady kept in the hotel safe all day and in her bedroom between 9
  p.m. and 1 a.m. Gunner Haynes had taken a room on the same floor...</p>

  <p>"I really am at your feet and prostrate," said Luke, not for the first
  time in the course of the dinner. "The truth is, my car hit a taxicab
  sideways&mdash;it was the cabby's fault&mdash;and up came an officious Robert
  and must take down all particulars very laboriously in his little book! Why
  don't they teach policemen to write shorthand?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, it doesn't matter&mdash;really." Margaret's voice was a little
  weary. Everything and everybody was going wrong tonight. Even Danty was
  distressed about something and was not his usual self.</p>

  <p>Luke was late; he had made an acrobatic entrance, performing wild
  gyrations in the arms of a strange gentleman. What had upset Danty? She had
  seen his face turn a sickly white when Luke came in. Rex was grumpy and
  silent, scarcely speaking to Lady Revellson on his left. And Luke had
  insisted on sitting next to her, after she arranged the table, with the
  result that everybody at the table was in his or her wrong place.</p>

  <p>"If that fellow hadn't been on the spot I should certainly have broken
  something&mdash;I couldn't possibly have saved myself...it has been trying to
  snow and I must have got some caked on the sole of my shoe&mdash;I walked the
  last hundred yards or so. The car was caught in a traffic jam in Piccadilly
  Circus..."</p>

  <p>"What was he like&mdash;in appearance?" Danton's voice sounded a little
  hoarse, as though he were speaking from a dry throat.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;the man who held me up?" And, when the other nodded, Luke went
  on: "A dark-looking fellow&mdash;I thought he might be a German...two scars
  across his right cheek&mdash;the sort of wound that duelling students love to
  acquire. I remember when I was at school in Bonn..."</p>

  <p>Danton was not listening now. Two scars across the right cheek! Then he
  had not been mistaken. The question was, had the Gunner recognized him? It
  was seven years since they had met&mdash;Danton had been clean-shaven and
  rather tow-headed in those days. Millie Haynes used to call him 'the
  gold-hair boy' in the days of her fascination. He had grown a moustache and
  darkened his hair down since then&mdash;he no longer filled the police
  description of Larry Vinman. He made the change long after he had thrown over
  Millie and left her to drift to a workhouse infirmary. It had been rendered
  necessary by the success of a trick which had left an Australian squatter
  poorer by eight thousand pounds, and the subsequent activities of Scotland
  Yard's confidence squad.</p>

  <p>Gunner Haynes! He breathed a little faster. Down his back ran a cold
  shiver of apprehension. Suppose he had recognized his old friend...suppose he
  packed a gun...suppose he was waiting out there in the lobby...</p>

  <p>Danty wiped his moist forehead, caught the eye of his hostess, and, with
  an appealing glance for permission, left his seat.</p>

  <p>"Just remembered I had to telephone..." he mumbled as he passed her.</p>

  <p>He went down the broad steps into the palm court. The Gunner was not
  there.</p>

  <p>He crossed the court into the lobby&mdash;empty. There were two lobbies,
  one in Haymarket, the other in Pall Mall. They were connected by a passage,
  and down this he went silently.</p>

  <p>As he came to the second vestibule he saw his man and drew back. Gunner
  was stepping into the elevator and his back was half turned to the watcher.
  It was he...there was no question of it. Gunner Haynes! The lift door closed
  on him. Danton looked round. He recognized the quiet-looking gentleman who
  was lounging by the revolving door.</p>

  <p>"You're the hotel detective, aren't you?" he asked. (When Danty Morell was
  plain Larry Vinman he knew most hotel detectives by sight and could guess the
  others.)</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"That gentleman who went up in the lift&mdash;who is he?" The detective
  told him. It was one of the assumed names that the Gunner invariably used,
  and the heart of Mr Morell leapt.</p>

  <p>"Like hell he is! No. 986 is his room, eh? He's Gunner Haynes and he's
  after jewellery. Get Scotland Yard&mdash;they'll check him up in a second.
  But my name doesn't come into this, do you understand?" He left the man busy
  at the telephone exchange and went back to the party, exulting.</p>

  <p>It was too good a secret to be kept. Moreover, he loved an audience; he
  had the table's breathless attention for five minutes.</p>

  <p>"He's got a room here, No. 986. I know the fellow rather well&mdash;I was
  very friendly with the District Attorney in New York and he showed me his
  portrait. One of the most dangerous men in New York&mdash;a gunman...I hope
  there is no trouble...I recognized him as soon as I saw him, but I had to go
  out and make sure."</p>

  <p>"What have you done?" Luke's face was troubled. He was on the soft side,
  as Danty knew.</p>

  <p>"Naturally I put the hotel detective on his track&mdash;I left him
  'phoning the Yard."</p>

  <p>Luke Maddison fetched a long sigh. "Poor devil!" he said.</p>

  <p>Margaret shook her head at Danty helplessly. "You've spoilt Luke's
  evening," she said, and her fiancé winced at the mild sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit, only&mdash;will you excuse me?" He was gone before the
  astonished girl could protest.</p>

  <p>"How like Luke&mdash;and how everything fits into the scheme of this
  wretched evening!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Where has he gone?" Danty was momentarily alarmed.</p>

  <p>She shrugged milky shoulders. "What does one do? Bail him out? Give him
  money for his breakfast&mdash;something horribly philanthropic," she
  said.</p>

  <p>Luke went straight to the second vestibule and into the elevator.</p>

  <p>"Where is No. 986?" he asked, as the lift went up.</p>

  <p>The attendant stopped the lift on the fourth floor and pointed to the
  door. For a second only did Luke Maddison hesitate, the door handle in his
  grasp, and then he turned and walked into the room.</p>

  <p>The occupant of the room was standing by the window, his back to the
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir?" He did not look round, and Luke realized that he was being
  viewed through the medium of a mirror which was sited on a bureau in an angle
  of the wall.</p>

  <p>Luke closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"If you're Gunner Haynes, I advise you to clear out." he said in a low
  voice. "If you're not, I owe you an apology."</p>

  <p>Haynes swung round at the mention of his name. "Oh..." he said. A pause,
  and then: "I am greatly obliged to you."</p>

  <p>"Have you any money?" Another pause.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I have all the money I want. Thank you." The Gunner was
  smiling, his underlip pouted. Something had amused him in his secretive way.
  "Thank you&mdash;I think I understand. I wasn't quite sure if it was Larry.
  After big pickings, eh?"</p>

  <p>All this was Greek to Maddison. He saw the Gunner pick up an overcoat from
  the foot-rail of the bed, and then the door was thrown open and a big man
  strode in, followed by two others. There was authority in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Gunner!" The Gunner nodded.</p>

  <p>"Lo, Sparrow&mdash;you carry your age very well!"</p>

  <p>The big man chuckled. "Don't I?" His hands passed quickly round the hips
  of his prisoner. "Got a gat?" he asked, in the friendliest way.</p>

  <p>"No, sir." The Gunner was still smiling. "The legend that I carry a lethal
  weapon dies very hard. My condition of disarmament would earn three hearty
  cheers from the League of Nations."</p>

  <p>The big detective snapped handcuffs on his quarry; then he looked shrewdly
  at Luke. "This man hasn't anything belonging to you, Mr Maddison?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Luke was staggered to discover that he was known. "No&mdash;I am sorry to
  say." he said.</p>

  <p>"Mr Maddison&mdash;I'll remember that name," said the Gunner, and gave a
  friendly nod to Luke as they hustled him from the room.</p>

  <p>"Poor devil!" said Luke Maddison for the second time that night, and went
  back to his party.</p>

  <p>This time Margaret Leferre did not accept his apologies, and when he told
  her where he had been, her face grew as white as Danty Morell's.</p>

  <p>It was fully three weeks before that little rift was closed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The storm that swept down on London found at least two
  people unprepared. Luke Maddison was cheery. He had been formally
  forgiven&mdash;the marriage was to be quiet, and only a few guests were to be
  invited. He had only a few minutes before arranged his train
  reservations&mdash;no secretary should perform that sacred duty!</p>

  <p>His heart would have sung a gay song even if every thick flake of snow
  burnt as it touched his face. The flower-girl shifted the strap of her basket
  from one shoulder to another and gazed with dismay upon the tumbling white
  fog that descended upon St James's Street, blotting out every landmark. You
  could not see from one side of the street to the other. Almost instantly the
  ground was thick where the white flakes lay. But for their asthmatic engines
  one would not have known that such things as motor buses were passing.</p>

  <p>Snow covered the violets in her basket, soaked into the thin shawl about
  her shoulders, and, even when she sought shelter in the doorway of a bank,
  followed her in gusty showers.</p>

  <p>Two men brushed past her into the bank. She offered a bunch of flowers
  automatically. The younger of the two did not notice her; the middle-aged man
  with the trim moustache gave her a quick, appraising glance and stopped.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, honey&mdash;busy?" She did not reply. He hesitated a moment, and
  then the door swung open and the impatient voice of the young man called him
  inside.</p>

  <p>At that moment Luke Maddison came striding down the street, swinging a
  light cane. He wore no overcoat and his shoulders already carried a white
  blanketing.</p>

  <p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw the girl shivering in the doorway,
  checked his stride and came up to her.</p>

  <p>"My dear, you look cold! My heart keeps me terribly warm&mdash;and if you
  think I am making love to you, I'm not! I want a flower, and you shall have a
  present, and then you and I will drift away and we shall be dead to one
  another&mdash;born and dead in this freezy moment! Buy a wreath!" He took a
  banknote out of his pocket and dangled it before her eyes laughingly.</p>

  <p>And then he had a slight shock.</p>

  <p>She was pretty&mdash;which flower girls, outside of musical comedy, are
  not; her figure was frail, her skin flawless. Yet she was poorly dressed;
  bore in her person all the evidence of penury. "Here's a better one." He put
  the note in his pocket and produced another, scribbled a line or two on the
  back of it.</p>

  <p>"That's the name and address of my company&mdash;if, when you try to
  change it, the police say that it is stolen, refer them to me." She did not
  answer, but looked from the note in her cold hands to its giver. It was for a
  hundred pounds! When she looked up he was gone.</p>

  <p>The swing doors of the bank opened again and the two men came out. She
  crumpled the note in her hand, dismayed, exhilarated, and, in one respect,
  disappointed. It was then she saw the young man's face. It was deathly pale
  and he was breathing quickly&mdash;this was noticeable, for the weather was
  cold.</p>

  <p>"By God...that was a horrible coincidence, Danty&mdash;suppose he'd come
  in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you fool!" The elder of the two shot a glance at the flower
  girl. She was arranging her violets.</p>

  <p>"But if he had...he said he was going out of town before the settlement."
  He was trembling violently: the flower girl might have seen that if she were
  observant. Danty's dark eyes roved the street for a taxi; they rested
  momentarily on the flower girl. She was pretty, but at the moment her face
  was vacant. More interested in her flowers than in unintelligible scraps of
  conversation, he supposed.</p>

  <p>"Now, see here, Rex&mdash;there's nothing to worry about. You could easily
  explain that Margaret..." His voice sank to an indistinguishable mutter of
  sound. The girl heard the word "settlement" used several times, and
  "carryover" and "account". Also "Margaret" was mentioned twice, and
  "Luke".</p>

  <p>"...fix it, don't worry!" Danty patted the other on the back. She decided
  that she did not like "Danty". "Here's a cab!"</p>

  <p>The younger man signalled and sprinted out to the taxi. The other went at
  a more leisurely pace. He dropped something on to her flowers&mdash;a
  visiting card. "Come along about nine and have a drink," he murmured.</p>

  <p>She took the card before his eyes, glanced at the name and deliberately
  tore it up. He was rather annoyed when he joined his companion.</p>

  <p>"Mr Danton Morell, 907 Half Moon Street." she read. It was a name to
  remember. And then she saw a huge figure loom out of the mist of swirling
  flakes, and instinctively knew that he was going to speak to her. Why she
  should think this she did not know&mdash;he might very well be going into the
  bank.</p>

  <p>He was big in every way. Until he ranged alongside her, his height did not
  seem extraordinary. Till his length was gauged, the breadth of his shoulders
  was not remarkable. He stood six feet four in his stockinged feet. His face
  was dark and broad and unattractive; he had a short, bull neck and a deep,
  rich, husky voice.</p>

  <p>He walked slowly, almost lethargically, through the snow, his hands behind
  him, his hard felt hat on the back of his head, the ragged cigar, that was
  burning unevenly, gripped in his teeth.</p>

  <p>The flower girl thought he was going to turn into the bank after all:
  instead, he stood squarely before her and looked down at her. The expression
  in those slits of eyes was blank. He might have his attention entirely
  absorbed by her; he might be trying to remember something.</p>

  <p>And then he spoke huskily.</p>

  <p>"You're no Child of the Poor!" There was something so friendly, so
  good-humoured in his voice, that she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Nor a wrongdoer, either," she said demurely, and his big face folded into
  a delighted smile.</p>

  <p>"You're nearly the first that ever gave me the right answer," he said.
  "Now I'll ask you another&mdash;where in the City of London is that text
  carved in stone?"</p>

  <p>The flower girl was almost scornful. "Why, over the entrance of the Old
  Bailey&mdash;'Protect the Children of the Poor and Punish the
  Wrongdoer.'"</p>

  <p>He nodded. "You've won a butter-cooler, but you can have your pick of the
  board. Keepin' to the general knowledge paper, who and what am I? For the
  correct answer you get a pint of peanuts and free admission to the Zoo."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a certain demure solemnity that delighted him. "You
  are Detective Inspector Horace Bird&mdash;you are called The Sparrow."</p>

  <p>He doubled forward and his face went purple with silent laughter. "You're
  free of the fair! Now let me do a little bit of classy detective work, like
  the well-known Mr What's-his-name of Baker Street. Your name is Mary Bolford,
  you're a reporter on the staff of the Daily Post Herald, and you're doing a
  stunt called 'A day in the life of a flower girl'. Don't deny it! Your editor
  pointed you out an hour ago an' asked me to keep an eye on you. How's that
  for deduction? Come and have some tea and I'll tell you the story of my
  life." He shifted his cigar to the off-side of his face, lifted the strap of
  the basket from her shoulder, and together they tramped through the slush
  down St James's Street.</p>

  <p>Even in the midst of their own discomforts, pedestrians turned their heads
  to look back after the enormous man with a basket of violets under his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"I bet you'll suffer for this," he rumbled. "Wet through&mdash;no? I hope
  you are wearing warm undies. Why are undies indelicate and sable coats
  ladylike? Ask me. It's one of the mysteries. Good afternoon, Tom." He stopped
  a man who was trying to pass him quickly, his head bent as though to avoid
  the drift of wind-borne snow.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr Bird&mdash;cold, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It's colder waitin' outside the staff entrance of Hoyce &amp; Drake, Tom.
  Pretty girl, eh, Tom? I'll bet your wife wouldn't think so. Don't do it, Tom,
  or I'll come along and blind you!&mdash;So long!"</p>

  <p>"Horrific!" she murmured as the man hurried away.</p>

  <p>"I have to be," he said complacently. "It's the only language they
  understand. What's that word again&mdash;horrific? That's a good one. Go
  straight in, Miss Bolford." They turned into the tea shop and Mary Bolford
  smelt the warmth and hotcakeness of the place and sighed luxuriously.</p>

  <p>"Order anything you like up to fourpence," said The Sparrow. "I've only
  just had lunch, so you'll excuse me if I stop at the tenth mince pie." He
  seemed to pay no attention to the rest of the people in the long tea room,
  and yet&mdash;"That feller over there in the corner is Sam Larber, the con.
  man. Times are bad and suckers are scarce. There ought to be a cold weather
  fund for confidence men. It takes sunshine to bring out human foolishness.
  That girl who's with him is Lisa Keane&mdash;she's no Sister of Mercy! See
  that bald young feller who's hidin' behind the newspaper? I got him nine
  months at the London Sessions for knockin' off motorcars&mdash;'knockin' off'
  means pinchin'&mdash;excuse my French."</p>

  <p>"What do you think of this?" She unfolded a piece of crinkly paper and
  spread it on the marble top of the tea table.</p>

  <p>"I don't think of hundred pound notes&mdash;I dream of 'em," he said, and
  added, in his inconsequential way: "That's because he's goin' to be married.
  I saw him holdin' it up before your eyes and thought he was tryin' to create
  a good impression. I was a bit hurt. Mr Maddison never struck me as bein' a
  vamp. And then I suddenly knew what it was all about."</p>

  <p>She might be a reporter, but she was feminine. "Whom is he marrying?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"A lady. That was her brother who was talkin' to another gentleman in the
  doorway. Danty!&mdash;he's no lady! What Rex loses on the swings he borrows
  from the roundabouts. The bookmakers have an insurance on his life&mdash;they
  hate the idea of anything happenin' to their annuity. And when he goes into
  the City all the sharks file their teeth. He's easy money&mdash;somebody
  else's money. Is that libel or slander?"</p>

  <p>"Both&mdash;if I printed it," she smiled.</p>

  <p>The waitress came&mdash;she drank the hot tea gratefully. Mr Bird sat
  munching cakes with great earnestness. A big plate of confectionery steadily
  vanished.</p>

  <p>"I'm a big man and have to keep my spirits up," he explained. "Mince pies
  are a kind of dope to me. After I've had a dozen I get sort of intoxicated
  and all my troubles disappear. After I've had twenty I go mad and tear up the
  pavement." Mercifully he stopped at the seventh.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do with this hundred pounds?" she asked. "I feel that I have
  obtained money by false pretences!"</p>

  <p>"I saw a couple of good evenin' dresses at Cecilia et Cie's," he said.
  "It's a Modes et Robes shop in Bond Street&mdash;and if you ask me why modes
  ate robes I'll say 'desist!" There was one dress with spangles on
  it&mdash;wear that an' you'd get a reputation for fastness that'd get you the
  first prize at Brooklands..."</p>

  <p>"Who is Danty?" She was in a new world; had been in it exactly a quarter
  of an hour. She went on quickly. "I know his name&mdash;Danton Morell: he
  gave me his card."</p>

  <p>Mr Bird nodded.</p>

  <p>"He would: he's that kind of philanthropist. 'Call round any evenin' when
  the servants have gone to the pictures.' Danty is clever. I'm one of the few
  people who know how clever he is. Some day I'll take a stick to him and he'll
  be in the market for a new head." And then he began to talk about
  people&mdash;the shifting population of the West End. The men and women who
  came and went; the mild old gentleman who had a suite at the Cercle Hotel all
  the year round but spent his time travelling to and from New York playing
  cards with the light-hearted and gullible. Of strange men who did nothing for
  a living and had no visible means of support, yet stayed at the best hotels.
  He called them the Once-a-Year Men.</p>

  <p>"They go after one coup and that keeps 'em. They're the highest-paid
  tale-tellers in the world. Kiplin' and what's-his-name Shaw? They never get
  the price that's paid to these fellers."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are always getting new experiences?" she said.</p>

  <p>Mr Bird sighed. "I think I know all that is to be known about the dirty
  ways of crooks," he said.</p>

  <p>But he was wrong.</p>

  <p>That night he was called to No. 342 Brook Street. Assisted by the
  white-faced Mr Danton Morell, he burst open the door of a bedroom, and there
  he found Rex Leferre, dead by his own hand. He lay on the floor, a revolver
  by his side: the quickeyed Danty saw the note scribbled in pencil on small
  sheets of paper torn from a telephone message block, and his hand closed over
  the paper. An hour later Margaret Leferre, pale and lovely in her silken
  negligee, read the message the detective had not seen.</p>

  <p>"Margaret, darling, I have lost. For months I have been gambling. Today I
  took a desperate step on the advice of Luke Maddison. He has led me to
  ruin&mdash;money is his god. I beg of you not to trust him. He has led me
  from cine act of folly to another. God bless you. REX."</p>

  <p>She read the pitiful message again and again. Luke Maddison: the man she
  was to marry in a week!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">For two days Margaret Leferre moved in a world of hideous
  unreality. Strange people interviewed her: a tall, big-framed man, who was
  strangely sympathetic in his heavy way, a bank manager who talked wildly and
  incomprehensibly until Danty appeared and whisked him off.</p>

  <p>One thunderous fact hammered night and day at her weary brain&mdash;Rex
  was dead by his own hand, and the man she was to marry, the man who, frantic
  with anxiety, was calling three times a day and being refused admission to
  her, was the cause.</p>

  <p>Money was his god!</p>

  <p>It was hard to adjust her views of him, harder still to comprehend the
  callous brutality that had sent a young soul wandering into the eternal
  night.</p>

  <p>This engagement of hers had been a thing of natural growth: the families
  had been friends for years; she had known Luke Maddison since she was a
  child. There had been no sudden meeting, no violent kindling of a consuming
  flame&mdash;she hardly remembered the time she did not like him&mdash;but
  could not place her finger upon the month and the year when liking was
  love.</p>

  <p>This was the real calamity of her situation if only she could realize it.
  She remembered now all that Rex had said of him&mdash;he was a 'tight
  wad'...She had always thought Luke was generous to a point of imbecility. But
  that was the facet he presented to her&mdash;men knew better. She set her
  teeth and brought herself to asking a question of Danty, who had come
  strangely near to her in these ugly days.</p>

  <p>Danty shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it is a fact&mdash;Maddison thinks too much about money. I
  saw him the other day, and the only thing he said about Rex was how lucky for
  everybody it was that Rex was insured." (Here he spoke the truth, for Luke
  had referred to the insurance as a protection against the girl being saddled
  with her brother's debts.) "He is fanatical on the point. Naturally he
  doesn't appear that way to you. You are his second obsession." He saw her
  wince and went on quickly: "That is a horrible thing to say, but it is
  true&mdash;except that I am not so sure that at the moment you aren't the
  first." It was after this that her cold hatred of the man whose name she was
  to bear began to take definite shape. She could not know how much this almost
  insane resentment owed its growth to the ingenuity of her new counsellor.</p>

  <p>Danty was clever&mdash;diabolically ingenious. He thought quickly, planned
  quickly, acted as he planned. The idea came to him on the night of Rex's
  death. It seemed too fantastic for accomplishment. He allowed the whirling
  nebula of it to retain its shapelessness until he had sounded her. If she
  loved Maddison in the proper way, she would take a view charitable to his
  intentions; she would endorse, however halfheartedly, the conventional mercy
  of a coroner's jury and put Rex's letter in the category of his minor
  derangements. This would have dissolved the nebula of Mr Morell's plan to
  nothingness. But he found Margaret in a mood to believe the worst, receptive,
  indeed eager. And then the nebula solidified into form.</p>

  <p>"Money is his god," was his text; he worked harder on that theme than he
  had ever worked in the days when he lived on the credulity of chance-found
  strangers.</p>

  <p>All the tricks of his profession, all the eloquent persuasions which can
  be best exercised by innuendo rather than bald statement, all the craft of
  suggestion&mdash;they were exercised.</p>

  <p>"At the moment, I should imagine he is so keen to marry you that he would
  sacrifice every penny he has. I honestly believe that if you asked him to
  assign you his fortune&mdash;as of course you could in your ante-nuptial
  contract...I mean, it is frequently done&mdash;he would sign without
  hesitation. He would hate it afterwards, and I dare say the honeymoon
  wouldn't be over before he induced you to reassign every penny to him. I
  often wonder what some of these over-generous lovers would feel like if their
  wives refused to be so accommodating..."</p>

  <p>She stared past him through the window. She was lovely; it was not the
  bold loveliness of Millie Haynes, who died in an infirmary, but something so
  delicate and unblemished that it caught his breath. He allowed his eyes to
  rove the field of her physical perfections. He was gambling on her strength
  of character&mdash;on Luke Maddison's weakness. There was something of the
  weakling in Luke, or he was greatly mistaken&mdash;and Mr Danton Morell was
  seldom wrong in his appraisement of men.</p>

  <p>"It is almost incredible," she said slowly. "If I thought..." The nebula
  had not only solidified, it was shaped.</p>

  <p>"About money being Maddison's god?" His tone was one of surprise: he was
  almost hurt that this characteristic of her fiancé was not as patent to her
  as to himself. "Good Lord! I could give you a dozen proofs..." He supplied,
  not a dozen, but sufficient. Danty's inventive power needed the least
  stimulation.</p>

  <p>"I know a man in Norfolk&mdash;one of Maddison's best friends...Maddison
  was landed with a block of shares in an oil field that had practically run
  dry. One night he asked this fellow to dinner, and before the night was over
  had transferred nearly a hundred thousand perfectly worthless shares to a man
  who trusted him as...well, as you trust him! Another case&mdash;and this was
  common property in the City&mdash;was a man who..." The second lie came as
  glibly as the first. It was all very crude, and on a balanced mind must have
  produced no effect but scornful unbelief. A week before, had he dared presume
  upon the mushroom friendship, he would have found himself on the wrong side
  of the door. But Rex lay shrouded in a mortuary chamber, and a coroner's
  officer was already gathering twelve good men and true to pass judgment on
  the mind that had willed a revolver to explode.</p>

  <p>Danty saw the red lips grow straighter...</p>

  <p>He had a servant who was a sometime confederate. Pi Coles had been a
  cardsharper until providence smote his hands with rheumatoid. He was an
  undersized little man, completely bald, with a face wrinkled with pain and
  age. To him Danty confided most of this thoughts&mdash;but obliquely, for he
  never mentioned names.</p>

  <p>"It's queer, Pi, how the mugs fall for any good story! Do you remember
  when you and I were on the same landing in Strangeways Gaol? Doesn't seem
  eight years ago, and here am I in society, giving advice to people with
  hundreds of thousands&mdash;people who know the top-notchers!"</p>

  <p>"You always was a gentleman, Larry&mdash;I've never known you when you
  didn't dress for dinner," said the sycophantic Pi.</p>

  <p>"Not so much of the 'Larry'," warned Mr Morell.</p>

  <p>He could sit in his comfortable room and muse on the favours which fate
  had shown to him. His position was not altogether unique&mdash;had not a
  famous confidence man once been the guest of an Illustrious Foreign Personage
  and been presented at one of the few European courts as a friend of
  Royalty?</p>

  <p>It was the third day following the tragedy. The twelve good men and true
  were to be assembled that afternoon. It was not the happiest day in Danty's
  life. A message came to him the night before from Luke Maddison, and there
  was something peremptory, almost unfriendly, in the summons; and what it was
  all about Danty knew too well, only he had hoped that his presence at the
  bank one snowy afternoon had been unobserved by the cashier.</p>

  <p>Luke had his office in Pall Mall, an out-of-the-way place for a man
  engaged in financial transactions; but Maddison's Bank had owned the site on
  which the modern building stood for two hundred years, and that modest room
  overlooking Waterloo Place had been the "master office" from those far-off
  days when they overlooked a country vista.</p>

  <p>Luke had been at his office since eight o'clock, an hour before the
  arrival of the staff, and here his bearded manager found him, sitting at his
  table, his head in his hands, his personal letters unopened.</p>

  <p>Maddison looked up with a start as the manager entered.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he said awkwardly. "Is there anything wrong?" There were many
  things wrong from the point of view of Mr Stiles, that shrewd man of affairs.
  He laid a small sheaf of papers on the table and detailed the contents of the
  documents briefly.</p>

  <p>"Here are four or five transactions that ought to be closed today, Mr
  Maddison. I am rather worried about them. The Gulanga Oil account should be
  settled. We made a very considerable loss there."</p>

  <p>Luke nodded impatiently. "Settle it," he said. "No message from&mdash;from
  Miss Leferre?" It was a stupid question to ask, for he had a private 'phone
  and he knew that any message that came from Margaret would be put through to
  him direct.</p>

  <p>The manager shook his head gloomily. "A bad business, sir. I have not
  spoken to you about it because I realize how badly you must be feeling. The
  Northern and Southern have been on the 'phone again this morning about that
  cheque&mdash;you remember they queried the signature yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes." Luke's usually gentle voice was harsh. "Tell the manager it is
  all right."</p>

  <p>"I told him yesterday, as a matter of fact." Mr Stiles was inclined to
  linger on a subject which was hateful to the other. In desperation Luke
  reverted to the question of the Gulanga Oil Concession, and for once Mr
  Stiles' fatherly interest in the business irritated him.</p>

  <p>"Of course, sir, I know that Maddisons is as sound as a bell of brass, but
  there is no getting away from the fact that we have been making rather heavy
  losses during the past six months, and I am afraid I shall have to call upon
  your reserves. Personally," he went on, oblivious of Luke's growing
  resentment, "I have always believed we made a mistake in not selling out to a
  joint stock concern. In private banking businesses the personal security
  plays too big a part for my liking&mdash;" Mercifully the house 'phone rang
  at that moment.</p>

  <p>Luke snatched up the receiver and listened with a frown. "Yes, show him
  in, please." And, as he replaced the receiver: "I am seeing Mr Morell and I
  do not wish to be interrupted," he said.</p>

  <p>Mr Stiles made a little grimace. He had been all his life in the firm of
  Maddison &amp; Sons, and he did not feel called upon to disguise his dislike
  of the caller. "There is something about that fellow that I dislike very
  much, Mr Maddison. I hope we are not going to carry his account?"</p>

  <p>Luke shook his head and nodded towards the door.</p>

  <p>Mr Danton Morell came into an atmosphere which he, sensitive to such
  matters, realized was charged with hostility. Nevertheless he was his smiling
  self, and laid his carefully brushed silk hat upon the table. Luke did not
  fail to notice that he wore a mourning tie, and that, for some reason, was a
  further strain upon his jangled nerves.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, will you?" His manner and voice were brusque. "You were a
  friend of poor Rex?"</p>

  <p>Danty inclined his head sorrowfully. "Yes, I was completely in his
  confidence," he said. "I think I told you the day following his
  unfortunate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Luke cut short the recollection. "Were you so much in his confidence that
  you accompanied him to the Northern and Southern Bank three days ago when he
  cashed a cheque for eighteen thousand five hundred pounds?"</p>

  <p>Danty opened his eyes wide in well-simulated surprise. "Why, of course,"
  he said. "Rex had made very heavy losses in the City, and advised him to see
  you. I understood you gave him a cheque for that amount&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did he tell you that?" Luke's blue eyes did not leave the man's face.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. Why, what was wrong? I saw the cheque myself."</p>

  <p>There was an uncomfortable pause, and then: "Did you see him sign it?"
  asked Luke deliberately.</p>

  <p>Danty's gaze did not falter. "I am afraid I do not understand you," he
  said evenly. "I saw him endorse it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My name was forged to it. I did not give Rex a cheque for that amount. I
  have been making enquiries. I find that he was heavily involved in a derelict
  West African gold-mining syndicate, most of the shares in which you bought
  for a song less than a year ago. He has been buying these shares on margin
  and they have been steadily dropping in value. On the day he paid you
  eighteen thousand five hundred pounds there came another demand for a larger
  amount."</p>

  <p>Danty's heart sank, though he gave no visible evidence of his
  perturbation. This man knew more than he had dreamed could be known. Here was
  a crisis in Mr Morell's affairs which might easily lead him to ruin and bring
  undone all those fine schemes of his.</p>

  <p>"I do not exactly know what you are suggesting," he said. "My interest in
  the company is a very slight one, and I was horrified when I learnt that Rex
  had been gambling in the shares. I give you the fullest permission to make
  any investigation you wish."</p>

  <p>Luke opened the drawer of his desk and took out a cheque. From where he
  sat Danty thought the signature was a tolerably good forgery. He had thought
  so when Rex had brought the cheque to him. It is the simplest thing in the
  world to forge a name, and so far as he had been able to judge there were no
  flaws in Rex Leferre's essay in that dangerous game.</p>

  <p>"You realize what is wrong with this cheque?" asked Luke.</p>

  <p>The other shook his head. "Are you suggesting that I knew that cheque was
  forged?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Before he could reply there was a tap at the door and Luke looked up
  angrily.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he said.</p>

  <p>It was the apologetic manager. "I am sorry to interrupt you, Mr Maddison,
  but will you see Mr Bird of Scotland Yard?" In spite of his self-possession
  Danty half-rose from his seat. The Sparrow was the last man in the world he
  wanted to meet that morning.</p>

  <p>Luke thought for a while.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He rose and opened the door leading to the corridor.</p>

  <p>"I shall want to see you again about this cheque, Mr Morell," he said.</p>

  <p>"Why not see me now?" It was a challenge, but Luke Maddison could sense
  its insincerity.</p>

  <p>"Mr Bird has come to see me on quite another matter," he said. "In due
  course we will interview him together." He closed the door on his visitor as
  The Sparrow was shown in through the other door. Mr Bird came heavily into
  the room and favoured every corner with a long scrutiny. He seemed
  disappointed&mdash;as though he expected to find something or somebody who
  was not present.</p>

  <p>"Havin' a visitor, Mr Maddison? I thought I saw somebody come in whilst I
  was waiting in the street outside."</p>

  <p>Luke nodded curtly. "Mr Danton Morell," he said. "Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>The Sparrow smiled. "As one knows the Lord Mayor&mdash;from a distance.
  I'm humble. You never find me bargin' in on society. I've had one dress suit
  seventeen years an' wear it twice a year&mdash;once for the Police Dinner and
  once to give the moths a cold."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything about him?"</p>

  <p>The Sparrow's wide smile grew wider. "His name an' address&mdash;an'
  that's as much as any policeman wants to know about anybody. Bad business,
  this young Leferre case, Mr Maddison. You don't want to appear in it, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>Luke looked at him, startled. "I? How on earth do I come into it?"</p>

  <p>Mr Bird coughed. "Well, you do and you don't," he said. "I happened to
  search the body an' the room. I found three loose cheques on the Northern and
  Southern Bank&mdash;that's where you keep your private account, ain't it? An'
  this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Very leisurely he took out a fat and worn leather case from his pocket,
  laid it flat on the desk and rummaged in the inside. After a while he found
  what he was looking for&mdash;two folded sheets of paper, evidently torn from
  a school exercise book.</p>

  <p>He smoothed these flat and Luke saw a succession of signatures, one under
  the other&mdash;"Luke Maddison&mdash;Luke Maddison."</p>

  <p>"Looks almost as though you'd been scribblin' absent-mindedly." The
  detective's shrewd eyes were on the young banker. "But at the same time I
  couldn't imagine a business man like you doin' anything so silly! If you'll
  excuse the liberty. I called at the Northern and Southern Bank yesterday
  afternoon, but they were reticent&mdash;'reticent' is a good word&mdash;an'
  referred me to you. But by an underhanded an' despicable trick I found that
  young Mr Leferre cashed a cheque the other day for eighteen thousand."</p>

  <p>Luke broke in here. "Yes&mdash;I gave him a cheque for that amount."</p>

  <p>The Sparrow was frankly sceptical. "Did you now? Maybe you'd like to show
  me the counterfoil of that cheque?" For a second Luke was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"If there were any reason for doing so, I could," he said coldly, "but I
  see no reason."</p>

  <p>Mr Bird was not abashed; he leaned his huge arms on the table, and when he
  spoke his voice was very serious.</p>

  <p>"I've no right to ask&mdash;I'm not the sort of man who would attempt to
  pull a bluff on a gentleman like you. I'll put my cards on the table. That
  cheque was met in notes and I want to know where those notes went. There's a
  bird in London I want to catch. I've got one of the best little cages for him
  that was ever built, an' whilst it's empty so is my heart. If that cheque was
  a forgery it might get the deceased a bad name, but it would make it very
  easy for me to pull in a certain man for 'uttering'&mdash;I'll tell you the
  truth, Mr Maddison: I want that man's finger-prints so much that I wonder I
  don't knock him down in the street an' take 'em!"</p>

  <p>Luke's eyes were averted: he gave no sign until the detective had
  finished. "I'm sorry I can't help you," he said. "The cheque was drawn by me
  and signed by me,"</p>

  <p>Mr Bird rose with a sigh.</p>

  <p>"You're too kind to the criminal classes, Mr Maddison," he said. "No
  wonder Gunner Haynes thinks you're a good feller&mdash;six months he got
  yesterday for bein' a suspected person. What a man! When I tried to pump him
  about your friend he wouldn't let on that he knew him even."</p>

  <p>"Morell?" Luke was thrown off his guard, as he saw by The Sparrow's
  grin.</p>

  <p>"That's the name. What's the use of talkin' at cross-purposes? He's
  the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about Morell." Luke was emphatic. "He was a friend of
  Rex&mdash;of Mr Leferre's. I'd rather not discuss him."</p>

  <p>The Sparrow sighed again, gathered up the papers on which the unfortunate
  Rex had practised the signature, and stuffed them back in his pocket
  book.</p>

  <p>"Nobody helps the police," he said dolefully. "All hands are against the
  natural guardians of the Children of the Poor...I'll be getting along." He
  offered a limp hand and went heavily out of the room. The door had hardly
  closed upon him before the telephone bell rang, and for the first time since
  the tragedy Luke heard the voice of the woman he loved.</p>

  <p>"Will you see me tomorrow, Luke?" Her voice was very low.</p>

  <p>"Now, if I may&mdash;darling, let me come to you now!" But her level voice
  denied him.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow&mdash;after this ghastly business. Luke, did Rex owe you any
  money?" The unexpectedness of the question threw him off his balance, and
  when Luke Maddison was flurried he was invariably incoherent, for the same
  reason as others are incoherent in the circumstances&mdash;he thought too
  quickly for speech.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but it isn't worth discussing...he was heavily insured, you
  know, and I don't think the policy is invalidated..." He heard the quick
  breath and grew panic-stricken.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of you...that there was no need to worry about his
  affairs...he owes me nothing practically."</p>

  <p>"Will you see me tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>Before he could reply, he heard the click of the hook being depressed.</p>

  <p class="first">"I see no reason in the world why the wedding should be
  postponed, Luke." The hideous business of coroner's inquisition was only a
  day old, and an accountant's statement that the dead boy's affairs were
  "involved" was accepted and no details were asked.</p>

  <p>Margaret Leferre could not understand herself; her own calm astonished
  her.</p>

  <p>Had she ever loved this suave man who stood before her, apparently
  agreeing, as though Rex were his dearest friend? Sometimes she was afraid
  that he would read her loathing of him in her eyes&mdash;she was amazed to
  find herself telling him now, with the greatest calmness and in a tone that
  was sadly sweet, that she saw no reason why the ceremony should be
  postponed.</p>

  <p>"My poor darling!" He took her in his arms, and she did not resist.
  Rather, she raised her cold lips to his, and hated herself. But the Judas
  kiss was his, not hers that was a tattered comfort.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing in the world I would not do to make life a little more
  smooth for you," he was saying. "If money could buy you happiness I would
  beggar myself!"</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly at this. Here was a man ready to betray his gods. He
  had ruined Rex; he had always hated him. She remembered half-forgotten
  phrases of his, little irritated comments upon Rex's carelessness in
  financial matters.</p>

  <p>He put her at arm's length and scrutinized her a little sadly. The pallor
  and the soft shadows beneath her eyes gave her an unearthly loveliness.</p>

  <p>"Naturally I've been worried sick...what a fool I was on the 'phone to
  talk of insurances&mdash;it was indecent...I just didn't know what to
  say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Luke, are you awfully rich?" She was always staggering him with questions
  like that.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;yes, I suppose I am. The bank isn't doing terribly
  well&mdash;on the trading side...we are merchants as well, you know&mdash;but
  I have over half a million private fortune. I thought you knew."</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly. "I have never asked you. I'm worried
  about&mdash;poverty. We have been poor&mdash;desperately. My father left us
  nothing, poor dear...it must be wonderful to be so rich&mdash;to have command
  of money&mdash;never to be bothered about bills, never to feel the frantic
  urge to go out and earn something."</p>

  <p>He was regarding her in open-eyed astonishment.</p>

  <p>"But I never knew...my dear, how awful! I thought you had an income?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. This time she was not acting.</p>

  <p>"If money will give you a sense of security, and of course it will,
  I'll...why, I'd give you control of every cent I have in the
  world&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He saw her incredulous smile and was angry with himself, as though in that
  gesture of unbelief he detected some reservations, some gesture of
  insincerity in his offer. "Why not? Thousands of men put all their property
  in their wives' names. It is a sane thing to do&mdash;it keeps a man steady
  and it will make us really partners. Wait."</p>

  <p>He was at the 'phone&mdash;as eager, as enthusiastic as a boy pursuing
  some new and delightful idea.</p>

  <p>"Luke...is that your lawyer you're calling?" Conscience overwhelmed her
  with a sudden fear; she realized for the first time the enormity of her
  treachery and was terrified.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Hilton&mdash;it is Luke Maddison speaking...you had the draft of the
  antenuptial contract? Well, include everything! You have the list of my
  securities?...Yes, all. And the cash in bank&mdash;everything...my interest
  in Maddison's...no, I'm not mad!"</p>

  <p>"You are!" She was standing by him now, her face white as death. The words
  came tremulously. "You're mad, Luke&mdash;I didn't mean it..." He smiled and
  kissed her, and there was something in his eyes that made her shrink
  back&mdash;something that recalled the words of Danton Morell.</p>

  <p>"You are his first obsession at the moment!" She stood there, her hands
  gripped, her breath coming quickly and more quickly, and heard him override
  the protests which came from the other end of the wire.</p>

  <p>Presently he hung up the 'phone and turned to her, a smile of triumph on
  his flushed face.</p>

  <p>"You are Maddison's!" he said grandly. "Lock, stock and barrel,
  darling&mdash;and I am what old Bird calls a Child of the Poor."</p>

  <p>Even she could not realize that he was speaking prophetically.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">To what end was life moving for Luke Maddison? In his rosy
  dreams he saw nothing but the smooth path of it. For him there must come, in
  a cycle of pleasant inevitability, years that were to be made up of amusing
  house parties, Ascots, Deauvilles, Lidos. He would wander at will from St
  Moritz to Cannes, from Cannes to town; there would be a make-believe of
  business, with the indispensable Mr Steele mumbling his forebodings, but the
  bank would go on whether Luke was there or not.</p>

  <p>He had trodden these ways before&mdash;but alone. Now he was to have his
  heart's desire. It was almost unthinkable that she would be with
  him&mdash;all the time, in all the places, in all the seasons. Margaret
  Leferre stood for womanhood in excelsis. Not the weakling woman that had been
  so favoured of the poets: she was to be something more than a wife. Here was
  a comrade to be trusted. Towards her he felt a tenderness more poignant
  because of the shadow of sorrow in which she lay. She was definitely a charge
  now, some one to be protected, to be shielded.</p>

  <p>On the morning of her marriage he went to his office at the earnest
  solicitation of his manager. There were certain documents which demanded his
  personal attention. He went with the greater alacrity since his lawyer had
  called at his flat that morning to protest hopelessly (since the deed was
  signed the day before) against the ante-nuptial agreement.</p>

  <p>"Luke, I'm beginning to think that you're the biggest kind of fool that
  I've met in my professional career...Yes, yes, I know that Margaret is the
  sweetest girl in the world and the most trustworthy&mdash;all the decency of
  the Leferres seems to have run to her side&mdash;but don't you realize what
  an awful mess you may be making of things? Suppose she died without making a
  will&mdash;I know it's a ghastly suggestion! I tell you I know it
  is&mdash;but suppose..."</p>

  <p>"I'll suppose nothing so horrible, Jack!" said Luke hotly. They were
  boyhood friends, he and the keen-faced young lawyer who overlooked his
  affairs. "I believe that a wife should have a share in her husband's
  fortune&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A share!" snarled Jack Hulbert. "You dam' fool, she's got it all!" They
  came as near to quarrelling as ever they had done.</p>

  <p>It did not soothe Luke's irritation that Mr Steele was in his most
  pessimistic mood.</p>

  <p>"We can cut our losses, but it is going to cost you a lot of money," he
  said gloomily; "and after this, Mr Maddison, I hope you're going to leave
  well alone. Speculation is all very well for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know!" Luke's nerves were a little on edge. "I quite agree to
  cut out speculation&mdash;the truth is, I was led rather against my will to
  take up these options." He could not confess that his amazing lapse had been
  due directly to poor Rex. Mr Steele would hardly have believed that his
  shrewd young employer could have been led into dealings so remote from the
  normal business of the firm by a youth with no particular experience in the
  markets. Yet this had been the truth.</p>

  <p>"What are our losses?" asked Luke.</p>

  <p>Mr Steele had the exact amount. "Ninety-seven thousand six hundred and
  forty pounds," he said impressively, and Luke smiled.</p>

  <p>"I happen to know that I am worth considerably more than that," he
  laughed. "In fact, Steele, I am a much richer man than I thought." He
  'happened to know' because, for the purpose of the ante-marriage bond, it had
  been necessary to make an equally exact schedule of his holdings.</p>

  <p>"All right&mdash;send a cheque, I will sign it." Mr Steele went out, and
  Luke made a rapid examination of the papers that remained to be signed.</p>

  <p>He was meeting Margaret at the Registrar's Office at two o'clock. Danty
  was to be there&mdash;he frowned at the thought, but had not objected. Danty,
  in some mysterious way, had ingratiated himself into Margaret's confidence;
  perhaps, thought Luke, it was his close friendship with Rex which had made
  this not only possible, but almost inevitable. There was to be no bridesmaid;
  the second witness was to be Mr Steele. His hand was on the bell push to
  summon the manager to remind him of his duty, when the bearded man came
  in.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to see a man named Lewing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Lewing? Who is he?" From Mr Steele's expression of disparagement he
  gathered that Lewing was not of any great account.</p>

  <p>"He's a queer customer," said Steele. "I'd have sent him off, only he said
  that he came from Gunner somebody who evidently knows you." For a moment Luke
  was puzzled. Gunner? He knew a man who was in the artillery...</p>

  <p>Then in a flash he remembered Gunner Haynes. He had forgotten all about
  the unfortunate hotel thief whom he had tried to save&mdash;had not even read
  in the newspapers what had been his fate.</p>

  <p>"Show him in." The man who followed Steele into the room was tall and
  spare of build. His deep-set eyes had in them a furtiveness that was almost
  animal. He glanced quickly round the room, and it almost seemed to Luke that
  he was pricing every article within view against the night when he might
  enter and take away such movables as would show him a profit.</p>

  <p>"Mornin', sir." He held his head downwards and sideways, looking up from
  under his heavy and untidy eyebrows. "Like to speak to you private, sir," he
  said in his husky voice.</p>

  <p>Luke glanced at the manager and signalled him to leave the room. Mr Steele
  left with the greatest reluctance.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, will you?" Not taking his eyes from Luke's face, the visitor
  stretched out a hand and drew a chair to him. "Well?" The visitor sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"Gunner's got three moon for bein' a suspected," he said in a low, hoarse
  voice. "The Sparrer spoke up for him, but the beak handed out the three moon.
  The Gunner's appealin' to the Sessions." Luke nodded.</p>

  <p>"He has got three months hard labour and is appealing? I hope he gets off.
  Did he send you to me?"</p>

  <p>Lewing nodded slowly. He had the appearance of a man who was lying and
  expected to be found out at any moment. "Yes. A few quid would do him a bit
  of good. He wants a mouthpiece. The Sparrer says he'll get off&mdash;an' the
  Sparrer knows."</p>

  <p>"Who is the Sparrow?"</p>

  <p>A slow smile dawned on Mr Lewing's face. "He's a 'busy'&mdash;a detective.
  Bird by name&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Luke nodded. He remembered Mr Sparrow, whose activities were apparently
  not wholly confined to inquests.</p>

  <p>"I was inside meself&mdash;for breakin' an' enterin'," confided Lewing,
  "but they couldn't prove nothin' so I got out. But me an' the Gunner's like
  brothers. He was in the next cell to me at Brixton an' he told me to pop up
  an' have a talk with you&mdash;a few quid would help him."</p>

  <p>Luke was puzzled. His acquaintance with the redoubtable gunman who called
  himself Haynes was a slight one, but it had struck him during their brief
  interview in the Ritz-Carlton, that the Gunner had the manners and certainly
  the vocabulary of a gentleman, and that this mean sneak-thief who was looking
  at him stealthily from the other side of the table was hardly the type of man
  in whom the Gunner would confide his commissions.</p>

  <p>Luke felt in his pocket and took out a few pound notes. "I suppose you
  know Mr Bird very well?" he asked as he counted the money.</p>

  <p>The man grinned. "The Sparrer? I should say so! He's always goin' on about
  the Children of the Poor&mdash;but he's always laggin' 'em! He pretends
  there's a lot of poor people who are sufferin' because of the likes
  of&mdash;" He was about to say 'me' but changed his mind&mdash;"of fellers
  who go on the crook. That's silly. If you can't do work you've got to do
  something: you can't starve. The last time the Sparrer started talkin' to me
  about it I says: 'Look here, Mr Bird, why don't you go after the children of
  the rich an' make 'em pay their whack to these children of the poor?' He
  couldn't answer me. He was dumbfounded. I'm always beatin' people in
  arguments." He seemed rather proud of this accomplishment; he was not without
  his vanities, even if he had to lie about his triumphs.</p>

  <p>"Here is ten pounds. Give that to your friend. I can't help him much more.
  I'd like to know what happens to him, and he can write to me here." A dirty
  hand like the talon of a bird shot out and clutched the money into a
  ball.</p>

  <p>"If you see the Dicky, don't tell him I called&mdash;The Sparrer, I mean.
  Some calls him one thing an' some another. An', governor, if you ever want to
  see life or bring any other swells to see it, you might pop down to
  Rotherhithe one night. Ask for Harry Sidler&mdash;I got it writ down
  somewhere." He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and produced a dirty-looking
  card.</p>

  <p>Amused, Luke took it and read: "HARRY SlDLER, next door 'The Cap and
  Bells.'" Beneath was the inscription: 'Best prices given for old iron.'</p>

  <p>Lewing was staring at him, his teeth showing in a mirthless grin.</p>

  <p>"Old iron!" he chuckled hoarsely. "That's not bad! If you want to see the
  children of the poor&mdash;that's the place to see 'em!" He rose from his
  chair and with a nod stole across the room and vanished through the
  half-opened doorway. Vanished from life, thought Luke, but in this he was
  mistaken.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">That morning had been one of great mental distress to
  Margaret Leferre. Three times she had taken up the telephone to call Luke;
  three times she had put down the instrument. And then Mr Danty Morell had
  called. Almost she did not receive him.</p>

  <p>She was in that state of mind when his appearance gave an ugliness to
  reality of which she would rather have remained unconscious.</p>

  <p>Daybreak came to her after a night of dreams; horrid dreams of the dead
  Rex, of Luke, of lawyers gabbling through the esoteric terms of a marriage
  deed. And out of all these disturbing dreams one fact had emerged: she hated
  Luke&mdash;hated him with an intensity that overbalanced all reason. She
  tried to recall the time when he had meant everything in the world to her,
  when her pulse quickened at the sound of his voice and the day seemed a
  little brighter for his presence. Desperately, and for the sake of her own
  dwindling self-respect, she endeavoured to recapture those hours when he was
  as a very god to her. She tried to find excuses for him, and in doing so she
  was unconsciously fanning the flame of her resentment. She had grown to hate
  herself for the tremendous treachery she contemplated. It made matters no
  easier that she found herself committed to a conspiracy with a man who a few
  months before had been a stranger.</p>

  <p>In this mood Danton found her. He was soberly attired: even in his black
  silk hat there was rather a suggestion of memorial service than wedding.</p>

  <p>She began without preliminary: she was so far involved that there was no
  need for pretence.</p>

  <p>"I can't go through with this, Danton," she said&mdash;she had never taken
  kindly to 'Danty', and after a few embarrassed attempts to carry off the
  familiarity she compromised with the more stately Christian name. "I have
  made up my mind to call up Luke end tell him. It is horrible&mdash;I can't do
  it." He was too clever to attempt a contest. Moreover, he had expected an
  eleventh hour penitence.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what is horrible?" he asked. "There are certain horrible aspects
  of the affair which have rather depressed me. Naturally I cannot discuss
  those with you, but...well, it is rather horrible that you hate him and must
  sacrifice yourself. When Luke told me that the honeymoon was to be spent in
  Paris...I didn't like it. Though why you should go on a honeymoon at all I
  don't know. You remember the Fletcher girl who broke her leg as she was
  stepping into the carriage...naturally one hates suggesting things,
  but&mdash;I know a doctor who would certify a sprained ankle..."</p>

  <p>She shook her head, but obviously she was thinking over this suggestion.
  She must have the climax of the drama at once. Must at the very door of the
  Registrar's office tell Luke the truth about the marriage&mdash;or there must
  be no marriage. With the ink still fresh on the ante-nuptial contract she
  must tell him that she had deliberately set herself to ruin him. There must
  be no lingering&mdash;a quick finale whilst the hatred was hot within her,
  before some sentimental spirit of mercy undid the work and left her tied to a
  man she secretly loathed.</p>

  <p>Danty saw her weakening. There was need to flog her animosities to fullest
  activity. He had a weapon to his hand: he had most carefully reserved this to
  the last.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you wonder why I am so bitter about Maddison," he said.</p>

  <p>There was no reason in the world why he should suppose anything of the
  sort. He had left her with no doubt in her mind that he hated Luke for more
  reasons than she could remember. He was too skilful a strategist to have
  suggested that he regarded Luke Maddison as a rival. That would have removed
  him from the sphere of disinterested friendship and discounted every move he
  made, every argument he employed. And yet, with every day that passed, he
  found it more and more difficult to conceal his growing passion for her. She
  was so different from the women he had known, so far removed from the Millie
  Haynes type...a lady...one of the class against which he had warred
  incessantly. He had to school himself to maintain the role of platonic
  friend. A single false move would have brought him to disaster.</p>

  <p>"I hate him because I loved Rex&mdash;and he will never leave Rex alone.
  The poor boy is not beneath the earth before he makes the most shocking
  accusation against him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?" She was on fire again.</p>

  <p>"Forgery! You wouldn't believe it possible, but Luke told me
  confidentially that a few days before Rex's death he had forged a cheque for
  eighteen thousand. A stupid accusation, as I told him&mdash;for I was with
  Rex when the cheque was given to him by Luke Maddison."</p>

  <p>She sat motionless, her chin held up, a new light in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"He said that?" She spoke in so low a voice that she was almost inaudible.
  "That Rex forged...but he couldn't have! How beastly!" He saw her lip quiver
  and knew that it was his moment. Bending towards her, he began to speak,
  quickly, eagerly. He spoke of things which in other moments she would have
  instantly resented, and she listened unmoved: in her cold fury she became
  elemental...somewhere within her a weak, protesting voice told her that she
  should not listen, but it grew weaker and subsided into a murmur of
  unease.</p>

  <p>At two o'clock she stepped from her car at the door of the Marylebone
  Registrar's office, and Luke, waiting in the room of that official, turned to
  greet the palest bride that had ever entered those commonplace portals.</p>

  <p>She spoke not at all, only answered the questions that were put to her.
  With a shudder she felt the ring slip upon her finger...</p>

  <p>It was all over so quickly that she could not believe that the first act
  of her vengeance was played. Somebody put a pen into her hand, and a squat
  forefinger showed her the place where she must sign her name. For a long time
  she held the pen, and when she wrote it wavered in her fingers and the
  scrawled signature looked like nothing she had ever seen.</p>

  <p>Leaving for Paris that night...the Meurice, or was it the Bristol? There
  was some confusion in her mind about these details...anyway, they did not
  matter if she kept her courage. The two o'clock wedding had been an
  inspiration. She went back to her house&mdash;Luke was coming to
  dinner&mdash;they left immediately after to catch the night boat from
  Southampton.</p>

  <p>"Wife! It's wonderful&mdash;unbelievable!" Luke's voice was tremulous.
  They were alone in her pretty little drawing-room, and he was sitting by her
  side, his arm around her. She was very still and unyielding, but he thought
  that he understood this. Luke was bubbling over with excitement&mdash;he was
  like a boy who had received a new and wonderful present.</p>

  <p>"I say, did you see that queer-looking man standing on the pavement as we
  came out? A fellow named Lewing&mdash;a thief of some kind. I wonder if he
  came to pick pockets? I'll bet he did...touched his hat to me as I came
  out..." She was not listening, and, after he had gone, could remember nothing
  that he had said except something about Rex. It was indecent of him to
  mention the boy.</p>

  <p>Danty rang her up, but she would not see or receive him. She must go
  through now without help. Luke was coming at seven. At six she called him on
  the telephone, and had one panic moment when she feared he had already left
  his flat and could not be found. When she heard his voice.</p>

  <p>"Darling...isn't it odd? I can't believe it&mdash;I still think of myself
  as a crusty old bachelor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Luke, I want you to do something for me." She found her voice at last.
  "No&mdash;no, don't interrupt...It's a big thing. I don't want to go away
  tonight...not for a day or two. I want to be alone...not to see you. My
  nerves are in a terrible state; I think I am on the verge of a breakdown." As
  she went on, he listened with a growing sense of alarm and dismay. And yet he
  was not thinking of himself.</p>

  <p>"I've been a selfish brute. Of course, darling, I quite understand."</p>

  <p>The conversation did not occupy five minutes of time; he could hardly
  realize what was happening, to what he was agreeing, before he was sitting at
  his writing table staring blankly at the telegraph forms by which he was to
  cancel so many pleasant arrangements.</p>

  <p>Danty, waiting at Waterloo Station with a full view of the barrier,
  watched the mail-boat passengers filter through to the platform. He saw the
  barrier close and the red tail-lights of the train disappear into the
  darkness, and went home humming a little song, for Mr and Mrs Luke Maddison
  were not amongst the passengers.</p>

  <p class="first">The General Manager of Maddison's Bank was not a man who
  could easily be taken by surprise. He had the fatalistic qualities which are
  peculiar to all men engaged in the business of finance. The vagaries of
  markets, the incidence of bank rates and the fluctuations of trade left him
  unmoved. He had once been held up by an armed robber and did not so much as
  change colour.</p>

  <p>Yet he stared with amazement and was physically incapable of coherent
  speech when he saw Luke Maddison walk through the outer office towards his
  private room.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Steele," smiled Luke. "You're not seeing a ghost."</p>

  <p>Mr Steele recovered his speech. "I thought&mdash;um&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You thought I was on my honeymoon, but I'm not," said Luke as he preceded
  the manager to his room. He stopped on the threshold at the sight of a burly
  figure disposed in the easiest arm-chair.</p>

  <p>"Mr Bird called, and I was&mdash;er&mdash;I thought you wouldn't mind if I
  saw him in your office."</p>

  <p>Luke Maddison was already shaking hands with his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Thought you might turn up," said The Sparrow cheerfully. "I noticed you
  weren't on the honeymoon express."</p>

  <p>Luke laughed. "You were at Waterloo, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Me and about fourteen crooks various," said the detective, "but only two
  of us interested in the boat-train. All the rest were low, common
  luggage-pinchers, but they didn't stay long. Me and him held on to the Paris
  Limited till it went out."</p>

  <p>"Who was the 'him'?" asked Luke, but Mr Sparrow was not informative.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong, Mr Maddison? Yes, know that your good lady is far from
  well, but nothing serious?" It was queer to hear Margaret referred to as a
  'good lady', and Luke found himself laughing quietly.</p>

  <p>"I've come up to see you about a cheap little lobcrawlin' roustabout,"
  explained The Sparrow. "If it's not asking you to betray a criminal's
  confidence, I'd like to know what brought Lewing to you yesterday?"</p>

  <p>Luke hesitated: he was loth to say anything which might get the man or his
  principal into trouble.</p>

  <p>"He didn't come for money perhaps&mdash;on behalf of the Gunner?" Mr Bird
  was watching him keenly. "I thought so. The Gunner's appealin', that's true,
  an' I think he'll get away with it. I was discussin' it in the exercise yard
  at Brixton Prison, and this Lewing must have been walking round and
  overheard. What did you give him?"</p>

  <p>As nearly as he could recall Luke gave him the gist of the interview. The
  Sparrow was amused. "The Gunner wouldn't talk to a man like Lewing. Haynes
  belongs to what the newspaper writers call the aristocracy of crime. If
  you'll prosecute I'll pull him in." But Luke was in no sense agreeable to
  such a course. "All right&mdash;leave him. He'll go around workin' against
  the children of the poor till one day he'll fall an' I shall be on top of
  him."</p>

  <p>The phrase again attracted Luke's attention, and he asked a question. The
  Sparrow pursed his thick lips. "People like you, Mr Maddison, don't
  understand. Look out of your window now"&mdash;he pointed, and Luke walked to
  the window. "See that girl-typist or somep'n. Two pound a week. She's one of
  a family of six (I'm makin' all this up) an' lives in Bermondsey. Every
  hand's against her. You don't think so? I'm tellin' you. They rob her, they
  lay in wait for her. They crowd round buses an' pinch her purse. Maybe some
  smart-lookin' lad asks her to go to the pictures&mdash;then one evenin'
  she'll go to supper in a flash night club. See that man? Old feller? Brought
  up a family on nothin'&mdash;he's a workin' carpenter by his bag. Do you know
  what they'll do to him? They'll get him tight, pinch his tools and turn out
  his pockets. That's why I'm drawin' so much a week: for protectin' the
  children of the poor. Do you get that?"</p>

  <p>"But I thought that thieves only went after the rich?" said Luke.</p>

  <p>Mr Bird guffawed. "What have the rich got? Their money's in safes. They've
  servants and telephones, and the law's on their side. A thief would rather
  rob the poor than rob anybody. They're helpless. I'll tell you, Mr Maddison,
  you've no idea what the poor are like, and you've no idea of what the rats
  are like. I could take you to a place in South London where they live in
  herds&mdash;little wicked thieves&mdash;just like in books. Livin' together
  in cellars and old warehouses. They'd hold you face down in the river mud
  till you were dead&mdash;that's if they had twenty pounds to split between
  four of 'em."</p>

  <p>Luke shivered. "It doesn't seem possible."</p>

  <p>Mr Bird smiled broadly. "I hope you'll never know how possible it
  is&mdash;what about that Lewing?" Luke shook his head, and The Sparrow,
  heaving himself from the chair, grunted his disapproval of such mercy. "He's
  one of the worst. Breakin' an' enterin', did he tell you? He's got the heart
  of a worm&mdash;he wouldn't break or enter anything more dangerous than a
  veal an' ham pie! He's a shore thief&mdash;I'll tell you all about it one
  day."</p>

  <p>During the talk Steele had appeared in the doorway twice. He was obviously
  worried; frowned at Bird, and by such signs as Luke understood signified his
  desire for an early interview. The detective was hardly out of the office
  before Steele came in. "That cheque you signed yesterday for ninety-seven
  thousand&mdash;the bank manager says he wants to see you urgently. He
  wouldn't tell me what it was about, after I had told him you were still in
  town."</p>

  <p>Luke frowned. "But it was on my private account," he said.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I told him. I explained that you were transferring
  that amount to the bank account, but he says he must see you."</p>

  <p>The bank was not very far distant, and ten minutes later Luke was in the
  manager's office. He had first to receive the congratulations of that
  official and to explain his presence in town. Margaret was feeling
  better&mdash;he had telephoned to her early that morning, and her message was
  reassuring. "Now about this cheque, Mr Maddison." The manager became suddenly
  businesslike. "You realize, of course, that it cannot be honoured?"</p>

  <p>"What?" Luke looked at him incredulously and the manager laughed.</p>

  <p>"Sounds queer, doesn't it? Especially queer to me when I realize that I am
  talking to the head of Maddison's Bank; but it is a fact. It is the merest
  formality, of course, but you as a banker will realize that banking is based
  upon formalities&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Will you please tell me what you mean?" said Luke impatiently. "I have
  six hundred thousand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You had," smiled the manager; "but you seem to forget, Mr Maddison, that
  you settled all your money and your securities on your wife!"</p>

  <p>And then it dawned upon Luke Maddison that he was a penniless man. His
  smile grew broader, his chuckle became a roar of laughter in which the
  manager joined.</p>

  <p>"That is the best joke I've heard." Luke wiped his eyes. "Of course, I had
  forgotten. I will see Mrs Maddison"&mdash;he lingered on the words&mdash;"and
  ask her to oblige me with a cheque for the amount."</p>

  <p>"Early," warned the manager. "You know, of course, that I must return this
  cheque unless I have her authority to pay?"</p>

  <p>If Luke Maddison's smile was a little contemptuous, he was justified by
  his own standards. He did not even trouble to see Margaret at once. Before
  lunch he remembered and telephoned. "I want to see you, darling," he
  began.</p>

  <p>"Why?" It was difficult to disguise the suspicion she felt.</p>

  <p>"I want you to sign a little document," he said gaily.</p>

  <p>So that was it! Danty had warned her. Only she had never dreamed that she
  would be asked to renounce her marriage portion so soon.</p>

  <p>"A document?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to transfer some money to me," he said. "It is the merest
  formality&mdash;I've discovered that I have rather less than I need."</p>

  <p>She thought quickly. "Very well, come to the house at three o'clock."</p>

  <p>He forgot that the bank closed at three-thirty and agreed. After all, it
  did not greatly matter if the cheque was returned. It was merely a
  transference from his personal account to the bank's.</p>

  <p>He was, true to his methods, five minutes late, and was shown into her
  little sitting-room. The first thing that struck him was that she was
  dressed. He had pictured her resting in her negligee&mdash;in bed even. She
  was not as pale as she had been. It was when he went to take her in his arms
  that he had his first shock.</p>

  <p>"Don't kiss me&mdash;please!" It was not a request: it was a peremptory
  command.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;what is wrong, darling?" She shook her head impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Please tell me what you want." Her tone turned him cold. It was hard,
  almost antagonistic. He could hardly believe the evidence of his senses.</p>

  <p>Stammering like a schoolboy, he told her in disjointed sentences of the
  situation which had arisen, and she listened and did not speak until he
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"Ninety-seven thousand pounds," she said. "A tenth of that would have
  saved Rex."</p>

  <p>He could only stare at her uncomprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"It was rather dreadful to see a man make a god of money, Luke, and to
  know that for its sake he is willing to sacrifice even a young life..." To
  him her voice sounded like the clang of a bell; to herself it hardly seemed
  that it was she who was speaking. "And to accuse this poor dead boy of
  forgery&mdash;to add that infamy to the other!"</p>

  <p>"I...you are speaking of me?" he said in a whisper.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Of you. I knew that you were coming to get your money
  back&mdash;that is why I did not go with you to France. I wanted it to happen
  here. Here, where I have friends and can meet you on even terms." A pause,
  and then: "Luke...I am giving you no money. You gave it to me&mdash;it is
  mine. Not a penny can you have&mdash;not a penny!" She wished he would speak
  during the silence that followed. She wished he would rave, curse her, do all
  the things that were consistent with her picture of him.</p>

  <p>But he said nothing. He was not even looking at her, but was studying the
  pattern of the carpet. Presently he jerked up his head.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye," he said, and turned on his heel.</p>

  <p>She heard the door close on him, and then there came to her a realization
  that made her brain reel. She loved him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Luke Maddison walked into his office so calmly that Steele,
  who from his glass partitioned office saw him pass, did not dream of the
  devastating catastrophe which had shattered the life of his young employer.
  Steele glanced up at the clock and grunted his satisfaction. Evidently the
  matter of the cheque had been satisfactorily adjusted.</p>

  <p>The house 'phone rang and he took up the instrument.</p>

  <p>"Will you come in?" Luke's voice was even; not by so much as a tremor did
  he betray his emotion.</p>

  <p>There was nothing remarkable to betray. He was astounded at his own
  amazing calm, and it was some time before he had discovered a reason for his
  abnormal serenity. He was living entirely in the present, not daring to look
  backward, indifferent to what waited on the morrow.</p>

  <p>Steele, who had known him from a child, saw something in his face that he
  had never seen before, and was alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong, sir?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>Luke Maddison pursed his lips as though he were going to whistle.</p>

  <p>"I don't know...I haven't quite got things into perspective. Sit down,
  Steele." Again he pursed his lips, staring past his manager; and then, in
  measured, deliberate tones, he told the man just what had happened. It was
  not a moment for reticence, nor did he feel the necessity for covering up or
  excusing Margaret's action. He was dealing with definite and final facts, and
  he set them forth with a sort of cold-blooded precision, as he would have set
  forth the values in a prospectus.</p>

  <p>Steele heard but at first could not comprehend the magnitude of the
  disaster. At last he made a little moaning sound, and this seemed to appeal
  to some latent sense of humour in Luke Maddison, for he smiled.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to do the best you can, Steele. I suppose one has friends in
  the City who would help, but I haven't the faith to go to them&mdash;faith in
  anything...No, I'm not stunned, I'm destroyed. But I'm not feeling sorry for
  myself&mdash;I wish I could. That at least would bring me back to
  realities."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Steele's voice was little above a whisper.</p>

  <p>Luke Maddison shook his head. "I don't know exactly," he frowned. "What
  does one do in these circumstances? Go away and shoot lions! Isn't that the
  usual course for broken-hearted men to take? I don't know."</p>

  <p>Steele glanced at his watch and got up from the table. "I'm going to see
  the bank," he said, with remarkable energy. "I think we can lodge those
  Artificial Silk shares against an overdraft."</p>

  <p>Luke made no comment. He heard the staccato explosion of Steele's
  voice&mdash;the old man invariably got that way when he was excited. He was
  conscious that Steele had gone and shut the door behind him. For ten minutes
  he sat at the desk, looking straight ahead, trying hard to reestablish touch
  with life. Then he rose, took his hat from the stand, mechanically drew on
  his gloves and went down the private staircase into the street.</p>

  <p>As he opened the door of his flat he heard the telephone bell ringing, and
  had time to stop the butler as he was going to it to answer.</p>

  <p>"Leave it, will you, please?" he said.</p>

  <p>The 'phone was in his own little study leading from his bedroom. He lifted
  the receiver and put it on the table. Then, locking the door, he changed his
  clothes. He took the first garments that came to him; was unaware, till he
  was dressed, that trousers and coat were a bad match. Counting the money in
  his pockets, he found he had a little over fifty pounds. He grew thoughtful
  at this. Was that his or hers? It was a ridiculous problem, yet he battled it
  out for a long while; but all the time realities avoided him. He could only
  think of Margaret as A, himself as B. There was C, which stood for
  money&mdash;did this belong to A or B?</p>

  <p>He threw the notes on the table, retaining the silver, and went out into
  the hall. He was taking down a light overcoat when the butler appeared at his
  elbow to ask the inevitable question.</p>

  <p>"No, no, I'm dining out tonight." And then, with the open door in his
  hand, he remembered. "I left some money on the table in my study. Take half
  for yourself and half for the cook&mdash;I shall not want you after this
  week." He left the man petrified with amazement and dismay.</p>

  <p>Why he gravitated to the Embankment he could never tell; it seemed a
  natural objective. He had no thought of suicide, no intention of finding that
  gross way to forgetfulness. Walking slowly by the parapet, he came to a halt
  before Scotland Yard and eyed that Gothic building incuriously. That big
  detective was there, The Sparrow&mdash;The Sparrow, who righted so many
  wrongs, could hardly disentangle the problem which deadened the mind of Luke
  Maddison. The children of the poor...he smiled mirthlessly. He was one of the
  children of the poor, the natural charge of that big man. To protect the
  children of the poor and punish the wrongdoer. Who had done wrong? Margaret?
  He tried hard to apportion all blame to her, to hate her...He shook his head
  and walked slowly back towards Blackfriars.</p>

  <p>Opposite the Temple Station he rested again. There was a narrow street
  running up to the Strand&mdash;Norfolk Street, wasn't it? And his lawyer had
  his office there. Why not see him and tell him all that had happened? It was
  the sane thing to do. But then Luke Maddison realized that he was not sane.
  He was the maddest being in the maddest world.</p>

  <p>He went on towards Blackfriars and came to a halt before the tram station.
  There was a long queue of people waiting to board the cars which arrived
  empty and went rolling along the Embankment crowded with humanity. Husbands
  and wives, possibly; young men going back to sweethearts who loved them;
  girls who had faith in some men or other and were ready to make every
  sacrifice for them. To Luke Maddison every car that drew away was laden with
  happy people, their day's work ended, the recreations and pleasures of the
  night before them. Old men, young men; girls looking trim and smart; young
  men smoking big pipes, with a newspaper under their arms; bespectacled
  students...they hypnotized him, these great, blazing tramcars. He watched men
  and women mounting to the top, tried to identify them through the glazed
  windows.</p>

  <p>He was standing with his back to and his elbows on the parapet.</p>

  <p>"Are you waiting for anybody?" The voice had authority, though it was
  quite kind. He looked up to meet the suspicious scrutiny of a City policeman.
  The City police do not like to see men lingering indecisively, one hand on
  the parapet, the swirling black river below&mdash;especially white-faced men,
  with a tense face and an almost horrified stare.</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;no," stammered Luke, "I'm&mdash;just watching."</p>

  <p>The policeman was looking at him curiously, as though he was trying to
  remember his face. "I've seen you before somewhere, haven't I?"</p>

  <p>"I dare say," said Luke, and turned away abruptly.</p>

  <p>He followed the homeward-wending crowd across Blackfriars Bridge. It was
  dark and cold, and he struggled into the overcoat which he had been carrying
  on his arm. He remembered somewhere in the Borough that he entered a little
  coffeehouse, redolent of burning lard.</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock it began to rain, a fine drizzle that very soon soaked
  through the light coat. He was walking aimlessly along York Road in the
  direction of Westminster. A man ahead of him was walking more slowly, a
  slouching man with his hands in his pockets and his coat collar turned up.
  Luke was wearing rubber soled shoes, and came up to the walker before he was
  aware of his presence. He saw the night wanderer lurch sideways with a snarl,
  stoop forwards as though he were going to run, and then something in Luke's
  face or appearance checked his flight.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he said huskily. "Thought you was a busy."</p>

  <p>Luke recognized him. "You're Lewing, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>The man peered into his face. "Blimey, if it ain' t Mr
  What's-your-name?&mdash;Maddison! What you doing down here? You should have
  come and seen me down Tooley Street: this ain' t my pitch." Twice he looked
  back furtively over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You thought I was a detective?"</p>

  <p>The thin lips of the man twisted in a leer. "That's what I said. No, I
  thought you was one of Connor's lot. They chased me out of Rotherhithe
  tonight...said I'd been 'nosing' on 'em. That's why I'm round here. Connor's
  crowd always thinks that someone's been nosing if one of his gang's
  dragged."</p>

  <p>"Nosing? You mean spying?"</p>

  <p>"Giving 'em away to the police," explained Mr Lewing. "Connor's brother
  got caught the other night and they got a yarn down Tooley Street that I'd
  done it."</p>

  <p>Luke began dimly to understand.</p>

  <p>"Come down here." The claw-like hands of Lewing caught him and dragged him
  down a narrow, ill-lit street.</p>

  <p>"I'm nervous tonight," he said, and here he was speaking the truth, for
  his voice became a little whimpering gasp. "You're a gentleman, Mr Maddison.
  You'd help a pore feller to get away. You know what Connor is&mdash;he'd
  knife you for twopence. Bumping off, he calls it&mdash;he's an American; at
  least, he's been in Sing Song...Sing Sing, is it? Anyway, it's a stir." [Stir
  = Prison&mdash;EW] A couple of quid'd get me out of London."</p>

  <p>"I haven't got a couple of pounds with me." said Luke. He was already
  weary of the companionship, and, but for being in his present condition,
  would never have submitted to being dragged into this foul little street.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can call at your office in the morning?" Lewing's voice
  betrayed his anxiety. And then, as he remembered: "I give that ten pounds to
  the Gunner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You gave nothing to the Gunner." said Luke coldly. "Mr Bird told me all
  about you."</p>

  <p>There was an embarrassed silence. "Anyway, I'd like you to stay with me,
  sir." said the man. "I called you a busy just now, and you look like a busy.
  If any of them Connors see me with a busy they'll&mdash;" They had just
  turned the corner into an even narrower street, and Lewing stopped suddenly.
  Four dark shapes, two on the pavement, two in the roadway, confronted them.
  Luke surveyed them curiously. They all seemed to have caps down over their
  eyes; each man had both hands in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Here, what's the idea, Joe?" Lewing's voice was a whine. "This gentleman
  is taking me round&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The leader of the four laughed harshly.</p>

  <p>"You've got to have a busy with you, have you?" he said with an oath. "You
  ain't satisfied with nosing on us Connors, but you got to carry Scotland Yard
  strapped under your arm. That's yours, Lewing!" To Luke it only seemed that
  the man had edged a little closer to Lewing as he spoke. Lewing coughed and
  fell groggily against Luke...</p>

  <p>"Get the 'busy'!" said a snarling voice.</p>

  <p>Luke swung back, but not quite in time. He saw the glitter of steel and
  felt as though a hot iron had been drawn across his breast; and then a
  curious weakness came on him, and he leaned back against the wall and
  gradually slipped into a sitting position...His last conscious impression was
  the clattering feet of running men; four dark shapes vanished into a greater
  darkness, and he was left alone, with something that sprawled across the
  pavement, staring with unseeing eyes at the flickering light of the street
  lamps.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At noon the next day Mr Danton Morell called with all the
  news procurable&mdash;and that was not much.</p>

  <p>"He seems to have disappeared from London, but I shouldn't be very much
  alarmed about that," he said.</p>

  <p>Margaret Maddison sat white-faced by her writing-table, playing with a
  pen.</p>

  <p>She had not slept at all since Luke's butler had wakened her at midnight
  to ask for information about his master. Early that morning she had weakened
  sufficiently to ring up Luke's office, only to find that she had communicated
  her own alarm to Mr Steele.</p>

  <p>"Naturally he wants to worry you." said Danty with a little smile. "That's
  part of his scheme. I dare say if you told old Steele that you were ready to
  give a cheque for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I told Mr Steele that I'd give him a cheque for any money he wanted," she
  said. Her voice was a little cold and hard. Danty grew alarmed. He was
  evidently on the wrong track; it was not easy to find the right one.</p>

  <p>"Then, if I may say so, you were extremely foolish. After all, you know
  the man; you know exactly what poor Rex thought of him; you went into this
  with your eyes open&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know." She was impatient. "I would do it again, I think&mdash;perhaps
  in another way. I was rather&mdash;brutal." She rose from the table and
  walked slowly across to the fireplace, took a cigarette from an enamelled box
  on the mantelpiece, lit it, only to throw it into the fire.</p>

  <p>"I am worried, Danton," she admitted. "I haven't the stamina for hate. I
  haven't even the illusion that I've done right."</p>

  <p>"Steele took your cheque, of course?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No," he said it wouldn't be necessary. I think Luke
  must have told him about everything. He was very sharp with me, almost
  rude."</p>

  <p>"Fire him," said Danty promptly. "Don't forget that you own the
  bank&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do not own the bank," she interrupted. "My lawyer rang me up this
  morning to say that by an omission the bank property was not included in the
  contract&mdash;and I am glad. Of course I shall transfer back to Luke every
  penny I have taken from him."</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" He almost shouted the words.</p>

  <p>She had not seen this Danton before, and she stared at him in amazement.
  He realized his mistake instantly.</p>

  <p>"I'm terribly sorry," he said, almost humbly. "I'm thinking of you; I'm
  thinking of how easily his disappearance may be a trick, as I'm perfectly
  sure it is. It is like you to want to give him back his money. But suppose
  you do, what then? You're married to him; he's hardly likely to give you
  grounds for divorce, and the net result of your generosity would be that you
  would be penniless, dependent on his charity for every farthing." She thought
  for a long time on this, looking down into the fire. It was difficult to know
  what Margaret was thinking about: her face was set; the side view he had of
  her eyes told him nothing.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to hurt him, and yet I was very frightened. If he had only said
  something, if he had only abused me...it was awful!" She closed her eyes as
  though to shut out the memory of Luke's face.</p>

  <p>"He'll be back tonight," said Danty cheerfully, "and then you'd better
  settle it amongst yourselves. I'm almost beginning to regret that I gave you
  any advice, and yet God knows I did not act from self-interest."</p>

  <p>"Why, of course not." She held out her hand impulsively and he took it. He
  was now mastering the situation.</p>

  <p>Yet he was puzzled, and all the way home he was trying to find a likely
  explanation for Luke's disappearance. He had formed an estimate of Luke
  Maddison's character, and his own prognosis of what would follow Margaret's
  revelation was, frankly, that the man he hated would take one of two courses;
  he would either display an immense sanity and consult his solicitors, or he
  would go the way of Rex Leferre.</p>

  <p>A newspaper placard attracted his attention; he tapped on the glass and
  stopped the cab to buy a copy of the journal. "Race Gang Murder", said the
  contents bill, and Danty was interested in gang fights. The scene of the
  tragedy was unknown to him.</p>

  <p>In his more humble days he had worked North London. The Borough and
  Lambeth were terra incognita.</p>

  <p>"As a result of a stabbing affray, arising, it is believed, from a quarrel
  between members of rival race gangs, a man named Lewing was killed, and his
  companion, whose identity the police are anxious to establish, is now lying
  in a dangerous condition at St Thomas's Hospital, suffering from a knife
  wound in the breast. The Flying Squad is combing South London to find the
  assailants, who are believed to be members of a dangerous criminal gang
  operating in the Borough."</p>

  <p>Danty tossed the paper on to the floor of the cab. It was one of those
  commonplace crimes which have no especial interest for the well-to-do
  classes, and just now he was on the verge of becoming one of that exclusive
  set.</p>

  <p>It may be said that he had no exact plan as to what part he would play in
  the present situation. He could make money more easily with Luke out of the
  way, and with this fool girl Margaret controlling a fortune, than he could if
  he were working under the cold blue eyes of Luke, who hated him. He had not
  disguised the fact, when he discussed Rex and the forgery, that he believed
  Rex was more victim than instigator of the crime.</p>

  <p>His disappearance was really a sensible relief. It was hardly likely that
  his relationship with Margaret could have continued if she were in love with
  her husband and were guided by him. All that Danty planned was that Luke
  should cease to be a factor; and he had planned well. Whether he took his
  profits in one shape or another was a matter of indifference,
  except&mdash;the growing fascination that Margaret was exercising over him.
  He never saw her, but there grew a stronger desire for another relationship
  than confidential friend. Once he had touched her hand by a well-timed
  accident. She had let her hand rest against his long enough to encourage the
  hope that he might go farther; but when he had followed up this opening she
  had left him in no doubt about her feelings. Margaret had the disconcerting
  habit of candour.</p>

  <p>"I hope you aren't going to be very silly, Danton, and imagine that you're
  in love with me," she said.</p>

  <p>This was in the days when Rex was alive, and when her pulse beat a little
  quicker at the sound of Luke Maddison's footstep.</p>

  <p>Danty shrugged his shoulders. Women change; their charm is their
  inconsistency.</p>

  <p>He stepped out of the taxi and turned to pay the driver.</p>

  <p>"Morning, Mr Morell." Danty brought his head round slowly. Where had The
  Sparrow come from? He had a most alarming trick of appearing from nowhere. As
  a matter of fact, Mr Bird had been standing in the roadway but had been
  momentarily screened by the taxi.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd like to have a little chat with you," he beamed. "Seen
  anything of Mr Maddison?"</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of Danty's tongue to disclaim any acquaintance with Luke
  Maddison's movements. "Not since the marriage," he said.</p>

  <p>"Maybe he's gone away alone on his honeymoon," said The Sparrow, smiling
  broadly. "I can't keep track of these modern ways of going on. I suppose you
  haven't been on a honeymoon for a long time, Mr Morell?" His keen, bright
  eyes, half hidden behind the puffy eyelids, fixed Danton Morell like a
  gimlet. Danty did not flinch.</p>

  <p>"I've never been married," he said.</p>

  <p>He could easily have ended the interview by brushing past the detective
  and walking into the vestibule of the building&mdash;it was his error that he
  submitted to the cross-examination.</p>

  <p>"A pleasure to come," said The Sparrow brightly. "I was having a little
  talk with Gunner Haynes about you."</p>

  <p>In spite of his self-control, Danton Morell felt the colour leave his
  face. "Oh, were you?" he said defiantly. "And who is Gunner Haynes?"</p>

  <p>"A low criminal," said The Sparrow in melancholy tones. "I meet
  'em&mdash;It's my job. There's a lot of things I like about the Gunner. First
  of all I like him because he never carries a gun, and secondly I do admire
  his memory! Got the memory of a horse, that old Gunner! He's the sort of
  fellow that remembers the colour of the socks he was wearing the day the
  Armistice was signed. I shouldn't be surprised if they were khaki. What
  colour socks did you wear that day, Mr Morell?"</p>

  <p>There was something so deadly in that question that Danton held his
  breath. On Armistice Day he had been serving a sentence of eighteen months in
  Peterhead Gaol. Had the Gunner recognized and betrayed him? He had only to
  consider this possibility to find a reason for its rejection. If Gunner
  Haynes knew he was alive and get-at-able, he would tell no police officer.
  Very surely and expeditiously he would settle his own account.</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you what kind of socks I was wearing," he drawled. "Are you
  interested in the hosiery business?"</p>

  <p>Mr Bird nodded solemnly. "Especially grey socks," he said; "grey woollen
  socks with a little broad arrow on the ankle." It was in perfect good humour,
  and could not, by any effort of the imagination, be described as offensive.
  Before Danton could speak he went on: "I suppose you can't oblige me with
  information? I'd like to know why Mr Maddison went away yesterday, and where
  he's gone. I'm thinking of sending him a birthday present. How long are you
  staying in London, Mr Morell?" The question was asked abruptly; the eyes
  behind the heavy lids seemed to brighten when Danty answered.</p>

  <p>"About a month."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking perhaps you'd be going next week." With a little nod he
  turned and went off in his heavy, ponderous fashion. Danty looked after him,
  biting his lip. He had received a warning. Though he would rather have the
  warning from the police than the more ungentle warning which Gunner Haynes
  would have delivered.</p>

  <p>He was still pondering the detective's words when he was dressing for
  dinner that night. It couldn't have been the Gunner&mdash;Bird was guessing,
  hoping to surprise a confirmation of his suspicions.</p>

  <p>Margaret and he were dining together that night, and when she 'phoned to
  him that afternoon he thought that she was cancelling the engagement, and had
  two convincing arguments to make her reconsider her decision. But she had
  merely 'phoned to ask him if he had any further news.</p>

  <p>She was infinitely more cheerful when he saw her that night; was
  reaffirmed in her old determination.</p>

  <p>"You'll hear from him tomorrow," smiled Danty over the coffee. "He's not
  the sort of man who gets very far away from the City of London, where the
  money is made!"</p>

  <p>She sighed. "I'm afraid you're right," she said.</p>

  <p>At that moment two eminent surgeons stood, one on each side of a bed in St
  Thomas's Hospital. One of them folded his stethoscope and looked down at the
  unconscious patient with a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"You haven't found this man's name, constable?"</p>

  <p>The detective officer who sat by the bed shook his head. "No, sir."</p>

  <p>The surgeon turned to his colleague. "Pneumonia, undoubtedly, Sir John,"
  he said briskly. "The lung was badly pierced&mdash;the pneumonia symptoms
  were to be expected, don't you think?" He beckoned to the third of the party,
  the house surgeon, who was attending another patient on the other side of the
  ward.</p>

  <p>"This fellow will probably die tonight," he said, almost brightly. "I
  don't see what you can do except to make him as comfortable as you can.
  Rather a superior looking fellow to be a member of a gang."</p>

  <p>The unconscious man smiled and muttered a word.</p>

  <p>"Sounded like 'Margaret' to me," said the interested surgeon. "Pity you
  don't know who he is, you might have notified his wife&mdash;I hardly think
  there's time now."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was the thirteenth day after the disappearance of Luke
  Maddison, and a day of fate for his wife, since it put a period to the long
  and agonizing hours of doubt and uncertainty, of self-reproach that at times
  approached self-loathing. Twice she had been on the point of acquainting the
  police, and twice had Danty stopped her.</p>

  <p>It was a time of worry for Danty also, but from quite another cause.</p>

  <p>What had puzzled, and, to some degree, comforted her, was the fact that Mr
  Steele, the manager of Maddison's Bank, had shown no particular anxiety. She
  guessed, or knew, that Luke had told him of her act, for when she had offered
  her cheque it had been almost peremptorily refused. What she did not realize
  was that in the days before she became a factor in Luke Maddison's life, and
  largely determined his actions, Luke was in the habit of disappearing into
  the blue.</p>

  <p>Invariably it was from Spain that Steele had received a postcard notifying
  him of the imminent return of his employer. The country had a fascination for
  Luke Maddison. He spoke the language like a native. He was one of the few
  Englishmen who understood and enjoyed the punctillo of bull-fighting, and he
  loved nothing better than to retire to some lodging in Cordoba or Ronda, and,
  making that his headquarters, rove the countryside for weeks on end.</p>

  <p>Steele was uneasy, but he had that hope left, that in this great crisis of
  his affairs Luke Maddison had gone back to the scenes of his happy
  holidays.</p>

  <p>During all this period of waiting Margaret Maddison had kept to her house.
  She was not seen in the fashionable restaurants she usually patronized, and
  her few friends never doubted that she was on her honeymoon. Danty had
  advised that she should take the car and go by night to a remote Cornish
  village and stay there till what he described as the 'scandal' had blown
  over; but she was too worried about Luke to follow this counsel.</p>

  <p>A telegram had come to her on this twelfth morning, and she had just
  'phoned to Danton Morell asking him to call, when her butler came in with a
  card upon a salver. Margaret read the name and frowned. Miss Mary Bolford?
  Who was she? "Tell her I'm not at home."</p>

  <p>"I told her that, madam," said the man, "but she was rather cool about it.
  She said she knew you were in, and that she insisted upon seeing you."
  Margaret looked at the card again. In the left-hand corner where the address
  is usually inscribed were the words: Daily Post-Herald. She realized the
  futility of denying the interview; was in some terror, being wholly
  unacquainted with the ethics of journalism, that if she refused to see Miss
  Mary Bolford that interesting reporter (as she guessed her to be) might
  invent an interview, with painful consequences.</p>

  <p>"Show her up, please." she said.</p>

  <p>She expected something mannish rather, or at best a girl who had developed
  her intellectual side at the expense of her appearance, and she was not
  prepared for the pretty girl in the neatly-tailored costume who walked into
  the drawing-room, displaying none of the nervousness nor showing the
  apologetic manner which Margaret expected.</p>

  <p>"Are you Miss Bolford?" asked Margaret in surprise.</p>

  <p>The girl nodded her head and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm a reporter: I suppose you gathered that from my card, Mrs Maddison?"
  Mrs Maddison! It was the first time she had been called by that name, and
  somehow it seemed to bring home to her the tragedy of those past twelve
  days.</p>

  <p>"I told the butler to say I was out to everybody. I am not feeling very
  well, and I'm staying in town&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's what I've come about&mdash;may I sit down?" Margaret pointed to a
  chair, and the girl reporter settled herself comfortably. "I realize that you
  think we're being terrible, prying into your private affairs, but that is our
  business," she said, with almost offensive brusqueness. "Newspaper readers
  love a romance, whether it is happy or unhappy, and we have news that your
  honeymoon was interrupted and that your husband had to go abroad&mdash;or has
  he gone abroad? Mr Steele&mdash;that's the manager of the
  bank&mdash;suggested that he had, without saying as much."</p>

  <p>Margaret did not speak for a second, and then: "My husband is abroad,
  yes."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where he is?"</p>

  <p>Margaret was not prepared for so open an attack and for a second was
  nonplussed. "Yes, I think I do," she said at last; "but I am not aware that
  that is a matter of public interest." Mary Bolford looked at Margaret
  straightly and searchingly. She had rather nice grey eyes, and they were not
  at all hostile. The girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, Mrs Maddison, but I think I can best help you, as well as help
  myself, if I am perfectly frank with you. We have a story that you quarrelled
  with your husband on your wedding day and that he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ran away?" suggested Margaret, coldly.</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly that. The truth is, I've a very good friend at Scotland
  Yard, and he came to me today to ask if we on the newspaper had any
  information as to Mr Maddison's whereabouts. And of course we haven't. Mr
  Bird was not terribly communicative&mdash;Mr Bird is Inspector Bird of the
  C.I.D.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What is the C.I.D.?" asked Margaret, mechanically. She was fighting for
  time. The mere mention of the detective frightened her&mdash;if she stood in
  terror of anything, it was that kind of loose talk which is as loosely
  described as scandal.</p>

  <p>The girl reporter explained. Again Margaret thought quickly. "Suppose I
  were to tell you that we quarrelled? Is that a matter of public interest,
  too?" To her surprise, she discovered that accidentally she had produced an
  explanation for Luke's disappearance which might be accepted without
  question.</p>

  <p>"Of course not! You must think I've an awful cheek to come at all. The
  last thing we want to do is to pry into a purely personal matter. If that is
  the explanation I can only apologize and make a graceful exit!" She rose
  briskly, but in those laughing brown eyes Margaret read sympathy.</p>

  <p>"You see," she went on, "if Mr Maddison had been called away on his
  wedding day to conduct some big financial deal, or from almost any cause
  other than&mdash;well, the cause you've given, it would have been a really
  interesting story. I'm terribly sorry, Mrs Maddison." She held out her hand
  impulsively and Margaret took it.</p>

  <p>"I think I'm rather sorry, too," she said, and sighed.</p>

  <p>And then Mary Bolford saw her face grow hard.</p>

  <p>"I was sorry yesterday&mdash;perhaps I'm not as sorry today. That's rather
  cryptic, and I hope you won't attempt to interpret it." She walked with the
  girl to the landing, and waited till she heard the door close upon her.</p>

  <p>Danty had arrived during the interview; she had heard the butler show him
  into the small ante-room that adjoined the drawing-room. She opened the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Come in," she said.</p>

  <p>"Who was that?" asked Danton Morell, a little anxiously. "Fenning said
  that it was a reporter. What has she come about?"</p>

  <p>Margaret smiled wryly. "She was trying to find something romantic in my
  marriage," she said. "I'm afraid even she'll never find it&mdash;read this."
  She opened a drawer of the desk, took out a folded sheet of paper and handed
  it to him. It was a telegram addressed to Margaret Maddison: "You can hardly
  expect me to come back to you. In a few months I will furnish you with
  sufficient evidence to enable you to secure a divorce. I am not entirely
  without money, therefore I am not entirely without pleasant consolations." It
  was signed 'Luke' and had been handed in at Paris at eight-thirty that
  morning.</p>

  <p>"That's that," she said. Her tone was light, but there was an agitation in
  her heart which she had not imagined possible. Consolations! And this was
  Luke Maddison, the idealist&mdash;a vulgar philanderer, who had fled
  to&mdash;consolations!</p>

  <p>"I'm rather surprised that you got this," said Danton gravely. "I
  shouldn't have thought he would have troubled to wire."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders. "Steele probably knows his address, and may
  have telegraphed to him that the police were making enquiries&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The police?" Danty's voice was sharp. "Who told you the police were
  enquiring?" She related all that Mary Bolford had told her, and saw his face
  grow troubled.</p>

  <p>"The Sparrow&mdash;that's the name they've given Bird. He hasn't been
  here?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. He was very thoughtful; stood for the space of a
  moment rather tense, his eyes narrowed, his mind very far away. "What are you
  going to do?" he asked at last.</p>

  <p>"Immediately? I'm leaving for Madeira on Saturday. The sea voyage will be
  good for me, and I shall be spared the experience of passing
  through&mdash;Paris." Her lips curled at the word.</p>

  <p>She saw he was perturbed, and instantly he blurted the reason. "I don't
  think I could get away on Saturday&mdash;" he began, and she smiled.</p>

  <p>"There's no need for you to get away, Danton. I am going alone. I want to
  think things out, and an island's a wonderful place for thought."</p>

  <p>He was dismayed, though he did not show his feelings. "How long will you
  be away?"</p>

  <p>"A month perhaps," she said. "I'm going to ask you to be an angel and to
  look after things for me&mdash;I will probably give you a power of attorney;
  you'll make much better use of it than I made of Luke's!" Had she been
  looking for it, she would have seen relief in his face. Danton was rather
  obvious beyond a certain point.</p>

  <p>"I'll do anything, of course," he said.</p>

  <p>The rest of their conversation was general, and he left very soon after.
  When he had gone, she opened the morning newspaper, more interested in the
  weather prospects than anything else. On the centre page of the Post-Herald
  she saw the photograph of a haggard and unshaven man. It had evidently been
  taken in a hospital bed. His eyes were closed; the photograph just showed the
  edge of the sheet a few inches under his chin.</p>

  <p>"Do You Know This Man?" demanded the headline.</p>

  <p>She glanced at the letterpress, and saw that it had reference to a murder
  that had been committed in South London, and that he whose picture was shown
  had been present, and had only escaped death by the narrowest of margins. Not
  even his dearest friend would have recognized Luke Maddison, for the
  photograph had not been taken until the eleventh day of his detention in
  hospital, and it had been taken in a very poor light.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr Bird was discussing in a casual way the gang murder which
  had scarcely agitated Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"I saw the photograph of that other bird in this morning's paper," he
  said. "Looks like the leadin' man in 'Saved from the Sea'&mdash;that's a
  great film, Superintendent: you ought to see it. Brought tears to my eyes,
  and I'm no light crier." He knitted his brows. "Maybe it wasn't that picture
  at all. Have you got the feller?"</p>

  <p>Superintendent Kalley shook his head. "No, nor are we likely to. If we
  roused Lewing from the dead he'd swear he didn't recognize the man who knifed
  him. This other fellow will be the same."</p>

  <p>The Sparrow pursed his lips. "I'd like to go over and take a look at this
  invalid&mdash;is he going to die?"</p>

  <p>Kalley spread out his hands, thereby expressing his complete indifference.
  "God knows! But I wouldn't advise you to break in on Gennett's
  'manor'&mdash;he's rather touchy, and he's got charge of the case."
  Professional etiquette, therefore, kept Mr Bird from the casualty ward of St
  Thomas's Hospital. He found, however, a copy of the statement that the dying
  man had made. It was brief and unilluminative.</p>

  <p>"I do not know who killed Lewing. I was with him when he was stabbed, but
  I only know him slightly. I should not recognize any of the men; they were
  strangers to me and I did not see their faces." Beneath this was a note in
  brackets: "This man refuses to give his name."</p>

  <p>The Sparrow read and was slightly amused. He did not like the inspector in
  charge of the case. "Gennett's going to tie himself into knots over
  this&mdash;good luck to him!" Later that afternoon he met by arrangement Miss
  Mary Bolford, and they had tea together. For The Sparrow was of an age when
  he could with impunity meet the prettiest and the youngest of girls without
  exciting any other comment than the one he employed himself.</p>

  <p>"We're a regular Beauty and Beast show, me and you, Miss Bolford. How did
  you get on?"</p>

  <p>"With Mrs Maddison?" Mary sighed, and shook her head. "I don't know...it
  made me feel quite unpleasant. They quarrelled on the day of their marriage.
  Of course, I don't know why."</p>

  <p>"Maybe the brother," said the inspector. "You know what relations
  are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But he's dead."</p>

  <p>The Sparrow nodded solemnly, They were in one of the busiest teashops in
  the Charing Cross area, and all the time customers were coming and going. Mr
  Bird had secured for himself a small table in an alcove, and from here he
  commanded a view of the shop door. There was no special reason why he should
  take this trouble, for he neither expected friends nor enemies. He was,
  however, intensely interested in his fellow humans, and, moreover, he
  cherished a dream that some day a man badly wanted by the police&mdash;any
  man would do&mdash;and for whom they had searched in vain, would walk into
  his view. He was something of an optimist.</p>

  <p>"Quarrelled, eh? That's a warning to you, young Mary Bolford&mdash;never
  get married. I was only saying today&mdash;" She saw his mouth and eyes open
  in astonishment. He was staring at the door, and, turning her head, she
  looked.</p>

  <p>A man had strolled into the cafe, his felt hat at the back of his head,
  his hands in his pockets. He was rather dour-looking, and yet his face was
  strikingly attractive.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, well!" muttered Mr Bird. "This is where justice falls off the
  top of the Old Bailey and hits the man they couldn't hang."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"A bad lad," replied The Sparrow, under his breath. "Want to meet him?"
  She nodded, and at that moment the eyes of the stranger and the detective
  met.</p>

  <p>A slow smile dawned in the saturnine face, and at the request of Mr Bird's
  beckoning finger he came slowly across, took off his hat when he saw the
  girl, and, after a moment's hesitation, sat down.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Gunner!" said The Sparrow, mildly reproachful. "Have you broke
  gaol?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly have," smiled Gunner Haynes, and, calling a waitress to him,
  ordered coffee.</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine&mdash;a newspaper lady," introduced The Sparrow. "Being
  a member of that unlawful profession, she can meet the best jewel thief in
  England without blushing!" She met the Gunner's amused eyes, and smiled.</p>

  <p>"In case you don't know who I am," said Haynes, ironically.</p>

  <p>"They quashed that conviction?" And when the Gunner nodded, Mr Bird
  emitted a long and extravagant groan. "I've lost my faith in the Court of
  Appeal," he said, despairingly. "I know exactly why you were in the hotel,
  whose sparklers you were after&mdash;there's no justice in the world,
  Gunner."</p>

  <p>The Gunner stirred the coffee the waitress had brought, and laughed. It
  was a soft, musical laugh, altogether out of character with the man she saw.
  "You had a poor case, Mr Bird, and you'll be the first to admit it. I'd like
  to meet that man that tried to do me a turn."</p>

  <p>"You were going to say 'warn you'." The Sparrow looked at him keenly.
  "Well, you can't, because he's on his honeymoon."</p>

  <p>"Maddison, wasn't it? I remember the name. Is he the banker? You can
  answer freely, Mr Bird: I'm not going to touch him. He's got a good mark in
  my book."</p>

  <p>"That'll get him to heaven," said Bird, sardonically, and then became his
  businesslike self. "What's the game now, Gunner? Are you a reformed
  character? If you are, I'll give you a ticket for the Prisoners' Home of
  Rest." But Gunner Haynes was not listening.</p>

  <p>"Who did he marry&mdash;that pretty girl that was at the dinner that
  night, sitting at the head of the table? Gosh! she was lovely! Reminded me
  of&mdash;" He stopped dead, and she saw his face twitch, "&mdash;somebody I
  knew. Good luck to them!"</p>

  <p>"Wish them luck separately," said Mary Bolford; "they parted on their
  wedding day."</p>

  <p>He looked at her quickly. "What did she do to him?" he asked, and in spite
  of herself Mary Bolford laughed.</p>

  <p>"You're assuming a lot, aren't you? Doesn't it strike you that he may have
  done something pretty awful?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "That kind of man couldn't do anything pretty
  awful&mdash;I'm telling you, young lady! I know men; I understand the good in
  them and the bad in them&mdash;I've lived on men all my life; my knowledge of
  their weaknesses and their strengths has been my only asset. I don't
  understand women. And that's where you're wrong, Bird&mdash;I'm telling you
  this over the table&mdash;I wasn't after that woman's stuff, though I admit I
  was curious to see it. I was after a diamond bracelet as big as a leg-iron.
  There was an old fool staying there who was mad about an actress&mdash;or at
  least she called herself an actress, but I've seen her! He must have been a
  hundred&mdash;maybe a hundred and twenty. No, I've got money enough to live
  on." He glanced slyly at The Sparrow. "Money enough to buy a machine-gun and
  justify my title. Where's this man Maddison?" He addressed Mary Bolford.</p>

  <p>"Ask me," snapped The Sparrow, his cold eyes upon the crook. "I'm the
  information bureau round here! If you want to tell the story of your life, I
  dare say Miss Bolford will fix it for you, but I didn't bring you in here to
  make light conversation, Gunner."</p>

  <p>Haynes saw the little look of pain that came to the girl's eyes, and
  laughed. "He's right&mdash;of course he's right," he said. "Let me give you a
  word of advice, Miss Bolford." His voice was strangely gentle; even The
  Sparrow looked at him a little astonished. "Never be afraid of hurting a
  crook's feelings, because you can't. A man who's had ten minutes'
  conversation with the police after his arrest, when they're not certain where
  the stuff is hidden, has been insulted by experts!"</p>

  <p>The Sparrow nodded gravely. "Before you get sympathetic with an
  ex-convict," the Gunner went on, "find out what he's been in for&mdash;and,
  what's more important, how many times he's been in. It doesn't matter what
  his crime is; if he's been in twice you can cut him out as an object of
  pity&mdash;I've been in three times." The eyes were smiling, but the mouth
  was strangely hard. He was looking at the girl all the time, drinking in her
  fresh, unspoiled beauty. He turned with a sudden jerk, raised his finger to
  the waitress and took the check. Then he rose, offering his hand to The
  Sparrow.</p>

  <p>"Bird and I are in the same war." He was talking to the girl. "Only we're
  on different sides. My side always loses, but has most of the fun." With a
  little jerk of his head he turned, walked slowly across the shop, and
  disappeared into the street.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They put Luke Maddison in a private ward, and one morning
  they left a little temperature chart within his view, and he saw that his
  name was Smith.</p>

  <p>"How long have I been Smith?" His voice was extraordinarily strong,
  remembering that only a few days before he had not been able to speak above a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>The good-natured nurse grinned cheerfully. "If we don't know people's
  names we call them Smith&mdash;preferably Bill," she said. "But you're going
  to be good, aren't you, and tell us yours?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "No, I don't think so. Smith is a very good name, borne
  by some very nice people. If my name had been Smith I might have been a
  better man," he added, whimsically.</p>

  <p>Since they had moved him into the private ward the burly-looking policeman
  who had loomed out of his dreams, and seemed part of them, had been taken
  away.</p>

  <p>That day they thought he was dying, a police magistrate had been summoned
  to take his deposition; but he had told nothing which was of the slightest
  consequence or value. Moreover, he had heard one detective say to another
  that he would not be of the slightest value as a witness at the inquest. So
  he could afford to lie and watch the hours pass, and the pale light of the
  sun move across the green wall, and night come and the lights.</p>

  <p>From where he lay he could hear the distant jangle of the trams; came to
  know the bell of one, and marked its comings and goings. He did not think of
  Margaret for longer than a few seconds. Resolutely he put her out of his
  mind. Once he had an idea of sending for Steele, but the appearance of the
  manager would have betrayed his identity, and he was anxious to save the name
  of the bank&mdash;or was it Margaret?</p>

  <p>Again and again he told himself that he would not raise his hand to save
  Margaret&mdash;but he knew that he was lying. It was for Margaret's sake that
  he was content to remain Bill Smith.</p>

  <p>They brought him newspapers, but he refused to read them. That was another
  reason why Bill Smith was so acceptable. If Maddison's Bank had suspended
  payment, there was an extra good reason why he should never be Luke Maddison
  again.</p>

  <p>He was curiously apathetic as to the state of the bank, curiously
  apathetic about almost everything and everybody. There was a time when he
  believed and hoped he was dying, and that in the final oblivion of things he
  would find the complete and absolute forgetfulness which his aching heart
  craved. But his heart was no longer aching. Presently the time would come
  when he would leave hospital, and then&mdash;?</p>

  <p>He was apathetic as to the prospect, too. What did anything matter?
  Perhaps he would sell flowers, like that jolly girl he had seen in St James's
  Street one snowy day.</p>

  <p>Or he might become a soldier; he was not too old, and he had been a member
  of the O.T.C. when he was at Eton. Or go abroad...he smiled faintly. "And
  shoot lions?" asked his own sarcastic voice.</p>

  <p>He did not care really what happened after. It was his sixteenth or
  seventeenth day in bed&mdash;he was not sure which&mdash;when the sister came
  in.</p>

  <p>"A friend of yours wishes to see you," she said. "He says he knows
  you."</p>

  <p>Luke frowned. "A friend?" he repeated. "I'm sure he's mistaken me for
  somebody else."</p>

  <p>"No, he particularly asked for you. He said the man who was stabbed; of
  course, I didn't tell him your name was Smith, because it isn't."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, it is, sister&mdash;I'm profoundly curious; let him come in."
  Who was it? For one moment of lunacy he had pictured a penitent Margaret. He
  would have instantly laughed at the thought, except that laughing hurt his
  chest.</p>

  <p>The man who came in he had never seen before. His shabbiness was relieved
  by a collar of such surprising whiteness that Luke guessed it had been bought
  for the occasion, as also had the violent necktie. He was a man with a very
  small face, sharp-featured; his heavily lidded eyes glanced furtively left
  and right before he came stealthily to the bed.</p>

  <p>"All right, sister." His voice was high and husky (Luke remembered that
  Lewing's voice was that way, and wondered if this was a relative.)</p>

  <p>"Is this your friend?" asked the nurse.</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's him all right, miss." The nurse disappeared, and the man bent over
  the bed. He smelt musty and unsavoury, as though his clothes had been stored
  in a damp place.</p>

  <p>"Joe says that as you didn't squeak he's going to make things right for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Didn't what?" asked Luke.</p>

  <p>"Squeak. Don't be funny! When you come out, see him." He slipped a dirty
  piece of paper under the pillow, and Luke heard a well-remembered rustle,
  "There's a fiver there for you. Joe says he'll look after you."</p>

  <p>"God bless him!" said Luke, soberly, "for if ever there was a man who
  wanted looking after, it's me!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The day before his discharge from hospital the sister asked
  Luke Maddison if he would like to see a barber. He fingered his bristly face,
  and his smile was almost one of boyish amusement.</p>

  <p>"No, I rather like myself," he said. "Can I indulge in the vanity of a
  mirror?" She brought a small hand-glass, and he saw reflected in the polished
  oval a strange, untidy-looking man with long hair and a shapeless beard. The
  face was still pale, the nose pinched, but the eyes shone as brightly as
  ever.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he murmured, and whistled.</p>

  <p>"You're not very pretty, are you?" said the good-humoured sister.</p>

  <p>"I never was," answered Luke, cheerfully. Then suddenly he frowned. "Is
  that infernal policeman coming back again?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No, he has given you up as a bad job. The inquest on
  that poor man was finished last week. Didn't you read the newspaper?"</p>

  <p>Luke hadn't read the newspaper. "I can't read," he said; but she laughed
  at this.</p>

  <p>So the inquest on 'that poor man' was concluded, and presumably the
  coroner had accepted his statement that he met Lewing by accident, and was
  walking with him when the assault occurred. A long time later he read the
  newspaper account, and saw himself described as "William Smith, of no fixed
  abode."</p>

  <p>"The man" (ran the paragraph) "is still in a critical condition, and
  witness said that it was unlikely that he could give evidence for a month, or
  that he could throw any light upon the murder." That afternoon Luke spent,
  sitting in a chintz-covered armchair, looking out across the river. Opposite
  were the Houses of Parliament. It was curious that he knew personally at
  least fifty men whose presence in that building was indicated by the Union
  flag on the clock tower&mdash;fifty men, anyone of whom would come flying
  across Westminster Bridge to help him. But he did not require help.</p>

  <p>He reviewed his position with the calm detachment of a third party. All
  the objectives in life had been wiped out by a terrific gunfire. He was
  homeless in the truest sense, for there was no place or being that stood for
  comfort or happiness. He was in the centre of horizons that showed no beacon
  light to indicate a destination.</p>

  <p>In the acid bath of his experience ambition had been burnt out; the very
  desire for life had gone. He would have cheerfully and gratefully died.</p>

  <p>It was curious that he seldom thought of Lewing's death or of the
  knife-thrust that had brought him, on the point of dissolution, to an
  operating-room stinking of disinfectants. He had no grievance against the man
  who knifed him; was rather amused than otherwise to find himself
  unconsciously the victim of a vendetta in which he had no part.</p>

  <p>He read again the slip of paper that the mysterious man had left with
  him.</p>

  <p>"Go to Mrs Fraser, 339 Ginnett Street, Lambeth. She will look after you."
  He chuckled faintly at this. So there was somebody in the world who wanted to
  look after him. It was rather funny.</p>

  <p>The first time he had read this short message he had all but torn up the
  paper and thrown it away; until his last day in hospital he had not the
  slightest intention of interviewing the lady&mdash;she only came into
  consideration after he had exhausted all the possibilities of conduct. To go
  back to the office was impossible. He had a country house somewhere, but he
  dimly remembered having made this over to Margaret in the deed.</p>

  <p>He could go abroad, of course, but that would cost money. He had not the
  slightest intention of touching again any of the strings which would lead him
  back to the old life. That episode had finished. There was interest and
  adventure somewhere in the world&mdash;who knew if it might not begin in the
  shabby purlieus of Ginnett Street?</p>

  <p>He left the hospital on a sunny afternoon, and could walk out without
  assistance, for he had carried no baggage. He was strong enough to walk, for
  he had taken an appreciable amount of exercise on the terrace of the
  hospital; but he had lost weight, and his clothes hung loosely upon him.</p>

  <p>Ginnett Street was not discovered without difficulty, but he found it at
  length: an unsavoury thoroughfare in the Borough. 339 was a greengrocer's
  shop that stood at the corner of a narrower street, in which was a gateway
  leading evidently to a small yard at the back of the premises. The shop was
  not particularly inviting; faded bills pasted on the window announced that
  the best household coal and firewood were procurable. The interior was dirty
  and dingy. Behind the counter was a shelf where, in sloping compartments,
  were a number of dyspeptic-looking potatoes, whilst a few weary and rusty
  cauliflowers were displayed for sale in the window. In one corner of the shop
  was a heap of coal and a weighing machine&mdash;evidently the people of
  Ginnett Street purchased their coal by the pound.</p>

  <p>He pushed open the door: a cracked bell clanged, and after a while there
  emerged through a door leading to the shop parlour a sharp-featured woman
  with brassy hair, who greeted him with all the superficial unfriendliness
  which he discovered was the normal attitude of the small tradesman in this
  neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>"I am Mrs Fraser," she said.</p>

  <p>"I was told to call and see you&mdash;" he began, when she interrupted him
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"Are you the man from the hospital&mdash;Smith?" Luke smiled and nodded.
  She lifted the flap of the counter. "Come in, will you?" Her tone was
  respectful, almost fawning. "I thought you wasn't coming out till tomorrow."
  She led the way into a frowsy little parlour and closed the door
  communicating with the shop carefully.</p>

  <p>"It's lucky I had the room done up for you today," she said. "I'm a rare
  one for getting things done in time. Will you come this way, Mr
  What's-your-name?" Curiosity impelled him to follow her. At the first sight
  of that dingy shop he had been tempted to turn back, to find a new foothold
  to life; but now he went after the woman almost gaily. For that was the
  ineradicable weakness of Luke Maddison: a consuming curiosity as to what
  would happen next.</p>

  <p>At sometime or other there had been built a small annexe to the house; the
  floors were firmer, the doors seemed heavier. She opened one of these and
  showed him into a room, the comfort of which was rather staggering. He
  expected to see something particularly uninviting, and it is possible that,
  had this been the case, he would have declined the lodging and gone
  elsewhere. But the bed was neat, the sheets spotless; the furniture, though
  plain, was ample, and a small fire burnt in the grate. "To air the room," she
  explained, almost apologetically, and led him to understand that this luxury
  was impermanent.</p>

  <p>On the table were a few sheets of writing paper and a pen and ink. Their
  presence puzzled him, till the woman explained. "A Certain Person thought
  you'd like to write to your friends, especially as you didn't write any
  letters from the hospital."</p>

  <p>"How the devil do they know that?" he asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>Mrs Fraser smiled cryptically. "He knows everything," she said. Evidently
  He was a person to be reverenced. "You don't want to have anything to do with
  that Lewing lot any more," she said, and all the time she was speaking her
  pale eyes were fixed on his searchingly. "The police broke up that crowd last
  week, and good luck to 'em! That Lewing would have twisted his own mother out
  of her insurance money!"</p>

  <p>"A bad lad, eh?"</p>

  <p>"If you'd done any jobs with him, as sure as death he would have shopped
  you&mdash;especially you being a gentleman born."</p>

  <p>"Let me put you right, Mrs Fraser," said Luke. "I was not a member of Mr
  Lewing's gang or any other gang&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know. He knew that. But Lewing was always boasting about the people he
  could get hold of, and he was shouting the odds about you and how you could
  drive. Are you a driver?"</p>

  <p>"A motor-car driver? Yes, I am a pretty good driver," smiled Luke.</p>

  <p>"Won races, haven't you?" she asked, in her monotonous tone.</p>

  <p>As it happened, Luke had won a private owner's race at Brooklands, though
  he could not by any stretch of imagination be described as a racing
  motorist.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," she nodded. "Boasting, that was Lewing's downfall..." Luke
  remembered a little conversation he had had with the dead man.</p>

  <p>"He's a friend of Gunner Haynes, isn't he?" An extraordinary change came
  over the woman. She made a little grimace and blinked quickly, as though she
  had been confronted by a bright light.</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about Mr Haynes," she said, obviously on the
  defensive. "The least said, soonest mended. We've never had any trouble with
  Mr Haynes and we don't want none." There was something in her tone that told
  him beyond doubt that fear was the basis of her respect for the Gunner. He
  was "Mr" Haynes to her; she was obviously anxious to say nothing that might
  be construed as disrespectful. Luke wondered why.</p>

  <p>She bustled off soon after to get him a cup of tea, and he pulled up a
  chair to the table. The writing paper was a great temptation; yet to whom
  could he write? He did not think of Margaret.</p>

  <p>When a mouse gets into a beehive and is killed by the outraged occupants,
  they find him too heavy to move, and so they cover him with wax, and he
  becomes part of their dwelling: a great lump that once lived but now has no
  significance. He had embalmed and covered Margaret in the same way. She was
  just an obstruction, to the circumvention of which he had grown
  accustomed.</p>

  <p>But Steele&mdash;? What would Steele be thinking? And then for the first
  time there occurred a dreadful thought. Suppose Steele thought he had
  committed suicide?</p>

  <p>Suppose the newspapers were full of stories of a "millionaire"&mdash;all
  people in his position were millionaires for newspaper purposes&mdash;and
  rivers were being dragged and descriptions being circulated? He turned cold
  at the thought.</p>

  <p>Mrs Fraser came back with a cup of tea, which proved to be drinkable. He
  made a desperate effort to obtain the information he could have had by
  searching a newspaper file. She listened to his questions and shook her
  head.</p>

  <p>"No, there's no news. There was a murder up in Finsbury, and that fellow
  was hung who killed the old woman."</p>

  <p>"I seem to remember," said Luke, carelessly, "when I was in hospital,
  hearing the nurses talk about a rich man who disappeared&mdash;his bank went
  broke or something...there was a talk of suicide."</p>

  <p>She pursed her lips and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I never heard of it; and I should have noticed that, because my poor
  mother lost all her money when the Webbick Bank went broke..."</p>

  <p>He breathed more freely when she had gone. Possibly Steele had refrained
  from communicating with the police, except as a last expedient...</p>

  <p>He drew a sheet of paper to him and dipped the pen into the ink.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The last person in the world that Danty Morell wished to see
  was Inspector Bird.</p>

  <p>If there was any compensation for that meeting in Green Park, it was that
  Mr Bird was accompanied by a very pretty girl, whose face was curiously
  familiar to the connoisseur of beauty.</p>

  <p>Danton was strolling aimlessly along the marge of the pond, watching the
  ducks, his mind intent upon a scheme which he had formulated that morning.
  When he saw that The Sparrow had a companion, he hoped that the detective
  would have sufficient sense of decency to pass him; but apparently Mr Bird
  was deficient in this quality. He stood, a stout, stolid figure, his eyes
  twinkling through his puffed eyelids, a smirk of satisfaction on his face, as
  though he were meeting a long-lost friend.</p>

  <p>"Morning, Morell&mdash;I'd like you to meet this gentleman, Miss
  Bolford."</p>

  <p>His tone was so friendly that Danty was momentarily taken off his guard.
  He smiled ingratiatingly.</p>

  <p>"I think I've met you before&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"And you'll meet her again;" boomed The Sparrow. "This young lady's a
  reporter&mdash;ever been to the Old Bailey, Miss Bolford?"</p>

  <p>She laughed. "Twice. I don't want to go again."</p>

  <p>"You can go there too often," admitted The Sparrow. "Once is too often
  with some people, eh, Morell?" Before the wrathful man could reply: "Any news
  of Mr Maddison?"</p>

  <p>"He's in Paris," said Danty, shortly.</p>

  <p>"Thought he was." The Sparrow nodded. "When I see that servant of yours
  getting off the boat train I said to myself, 'I'll bet Maddison's in Paris.
  I'll bet he's sendin' lovin' wires to his wife all the time that servant of
  yours is there.'"</p>

  <p>"Do you know Mr Steele?" His head dropped on one side so ludicrously like
  a sparrow's that Mary Bolford had to make an effort to keep her face
  straight. "Manager of Maddison's Bank?"</p>

  <p>"I've heard of him; I've met him, I think," said the other curtly.</p>

  <p>"Good fellow, but not talkative," said Bird. The more you talk to him the
  less he says. He's just like ten oysters singing the Hallelujah
  Chorus&mdash;maybe eleven. What he doesn't know about the whereabouts of Mr
  Maddison he doesn't say."</p>

  <p>"So far as I know," said Danty in a loud voice, "Maddison is in Paris,
  having a very good time."</p>

  <p>"Not before the child," murmured The Sparrow, closing his eyes in anguish.
  "I suppose he said so in his wire? I'm betting ten million pounds it wasn't a
  letter."</p>

  <p>"You'd better ask Mrs Maddison," said Danty, and would have walked on had
  not the detective's hand detained him.</p>

  <p>"There's one thing I'd like to know&mdash;have you met the Gunner?"</p>

  <p>He saw the man start.</p>

  <p>"The Gunner?" he stammered. "Do you mean Haynes&mdash;the fellow who was
  charged the other day? He's in prison, I understand."</p>

  <p>"You don't read your newspapers." The Sparrow shook his head sorrowfully.
  "Here's Fleet Street spendin' millions of pounds a year, thousands of honest
  industrious reporters workin' like hell to get as much of the truth as makes
  good readin', and you don't read 'em! The Gunner's conviction was
  quashed&mdash;he's floating around London somewhere."</p>

  <p>Danty had regained control over his features now, and his face was like a
  mask. "I'm really not interested in the criminal classes," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you're not!" said Mr Bird, admiringly. "I'll give you a tip,
  Morell&mdash;avoid the wide, open spaces where men are men in the daytime and
  frequently dead at night. I never found the Gunner's well-known gun, but
  maybe he knows just where to lay his hand on it. So long!" He watched Danton
  walking furiously along the path, and turned with a broad grin to his
  companion. "That man's nearer to being a crook than I am to being a
  detective," he said.</p>

  <p>"He's the man who asked me to call at his house after dinner and have
  coffee with him," smiled Mary.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet he is! Why, of course!" said Bird. "I'd forgotten that little
  episode, outside the bank." He scratched his chin. "Who was with him then?"
  he asked with sudden interest.</p>

  <p>"A young man; I'd never seen him before, but you said he was a speculator
  or a gambler or something."</p>

  <p>The Sparrow's lips pursed in a whistle. "They were in that bank together,"
  he said softly, "at about three in the afternoon, when a cheque was cashed
  for umpteen thousand pounds! Everything is very curious and mysterious." But
  when she endeavoured to satisfy her own curiosity and solve the mystery, he
  was as uncommunicative as Mr Steele.</p>

  <p>Danty strode on furiously, his smooth complacency disturbed. He had
  counted on the fact that the Gunner would be in prison for at least three
  months. And in three months much could be done. His big coup could be
  projected and brought to fruition, and he could be well out of the country,
  with enough money to last him for years, before Gunner Haynes started forth
  on his quest.</p>

  <p>As he reached the Mall he stopped suddenly with a blank sense of dismay.
  Why had The Sparrow warned him? There was nothing to connect him with the
  arrest of the Gunner, unless&mdash;the police had betrayed him! So the Gunner
  knew...it was strange that Haynes had made no attempt to see him during all
  the weeks he had been at liberty. Danton Morell took comfort from that
  thought, and went on to keep his appointment.</p>

  <p>Margaret was out when he arrived; he had to wait for an hour in her
  drawing room before she returned. That in itself was a bad sign. He had made
  the appointment, and did not dream that she would fail to keep it. He hinted
  as much when she came in, and recognized his mistake.</p>

  <p>In these days Margaret was never in the same mood for ten minutes
  together.</p>

  <p>She who had been so tractable and so easily influenced, who was ready to
  accept the most deadly charges against the man she had loved, without any
  attempt at independent investigation, was now particularly difficult to
  convince at all. He was constantly meeting new barriers, new reservations;
  had to combat, as it were, another nature which he had not even suspected.
  She was in her most austere mood this morning.</p>

  <p>"You must have mistaken the time," he suggested. "I said eleven
  o'clock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know you said eleven o'clock, but I was detained."</p>

  <p>He swallowed something. "Been shopping?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. She seemed to be more intent upon the book, the leaves
  of which she was turning, than upon Danton and his appointment. He saw it was
  a Continental Bradshaw. "I thought you were bored with Madeira? You're not
  going away again?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer. She had found the place she wanted, and her finger
  went down a column of figures. "I'm not going away," she said; "I am sending
  a man into Spain&mdash;Mr Steele thinks that if Luke went anywhere it would
  be to Ronda, though of course he wouldn't have had time to reach there
  yet."</p>

  <p>He stared at her in amazement. "Steele? Have you seen him?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Yes."</p>

  <p>"But I thought he was rather rude to you the last time you spoke to
  him?"</p>

  <p>A faint smile curled the finely moulded lips. "He was inclined to be rude
  to me today&mdash;but I persevered," she said, quietly.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Margaret! You surely aren't going to do anything as
  undignified as to run after Luke? After his wire and his barefaced admission
  of consolations&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Luke has not been in Paris," she said evenly, "Mr Steele had a note from
  him this morning, saying that he had been in London, but would probably go
  off to Spain for a little time. He asked Mr Steele to send his Spanish
  cheque-book to the Carlton in Madrid. Luke has an account at the Spanish
  National Bank which, apparently, he has only just remembered."</p>

  <p>There was a long silence. Danty was too wise to insist upon the
  authenticity of the Paris telegram. "You're sending a man to Ronda?" She
  nodded. "But what can he do?"</p>

  <p>"He can tell me when Luke arrives&mdash;then I shall go out to him."</p>

  <p>The man stared at her open-mouthed. "You'll go out to him?" he repeated
  incredulously. "Do you really mean that you've forgotten...Rex, and Rex's
  letter?"</p>

  <p>She was standing by her little writing-table, looking down at the pad,
  very lovely, very thoughtful, a slim, gracious figure of a girl.</p>

  <p>"When Rex.." she hesitated, "shot himself...he could not have been in his
  right mind. He must have been mistaken. It wasn't possible that Luke could
  have done this thing. I've been thinking it over day and night."</p>

  <p>Danty could adapt himself to circumstances; but when those circumstances
  were centred in a woman's caprice he found his task an almost super-human
  one. "You disbelieve your brother, then?"</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes slowly to his. "I even disbelieve myself," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"And me?" he challenged.</p>

  <p>She hesitated. "I think you were very zealous for me," she said, "and I
  probably led you into my way of thinking; and Rex was very fond of you."</p>

  <p>He smiled bitterly. "Is that all?"</p>

  <p>"What did you expect?" There was genuine surprise in her voice. Danton
  Morell knew that it was not the moment to put his fortune to the test. He
  threw out his hands and smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry&mdash;one is human; has human ambitions, human thoughts, human
  hopes." Before she could check this, he went on: "I supposed I was prejudiced
  against Maddison. I always thought he was a weakling. I have still suspicions
  that he is. If one of us has prejudiced the other, it is I who have
  prejudiced you." Instinct told him that he was saying the right thing, and
  that now for the first time he was attuned to her mood. But he had his own
  business to settle. "I was talking to you the other day about this Argentine
  Power Scheme I was organizing&mdash;you remember I showed you the report and
  the figures. You said you would like to take a few thousand shares."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "I wanted to talk to you about that&mdash;" she began, but he
  interrupted her.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've had a cable this morning. I have been trying to persuade one
  of the biggest supporters of the scheme to stand out&mdash;I was virtually
  pledged to give him a big holding&mdash;and he has agreed. I can now let you
  invest a hundred thousand pounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry"&mdash;her tone was so definite that he turned cold&mdash;"but
  I can't even take the few thousand. I have handed to the custody of Mr Steele
  and Luke's lawyer every penny I had from him&mdash;that is why I went to see
  Mr Steele."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Danty looked at the girl in horrified amazement. His
  consternation was almost comic.</p>

  <p>"You've given back all the money he gave you?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>She nodded, her steady eyes on his.</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't I? I have enough to live on," she said. "Mr Steele, as
  trustee of the fund, is making me a sufficient allowance."</p>

  <p>He could only gaze at her, dumbfounded. All his fine schemes had been
  blown away as a feather of steam is blown by a gale. She saved him the
  trouble of speaking and gave him time to recover himself, for she went on:
  "Luke has never been in Paris since he went away&mdash;some interested person
  must have sent that wire. I almost feel as though I willed it to be sent, to
  give me some excuse for the terrible way I treated Luke." She smiled. "I
  should be awfully uncomfortable if I thought my money made any difference to
  you in your scheme, Danton. Happily, you're a rich man."</p>

  <p>Danty nodded slowly. He had that morning received a warning letter from
  his banker, for he had been spending money and losing large sums at his
  favourite gaming-house in the faith that his financial position would soon be
  unassailable. With an effort he recovered his balance, and forced his voice
  into a tone of indifference. "I'm not sure that you're wise. Did you consult
  your lawyer?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "In matters of conscience one does not consult
  lawyers," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>It was difficult enough even to make intelligent conversation. Her
  attitude was a dead wall built across his easy path, and at the moment it
  seemed unscalable. He had to play for time now; his native cunning told him
  that, so long as he had her on his side, there was no reason why he should
  lose hope. He had dreamed of hundreds of thousands; he had been certain of
  tens of thousands; there was still an odd thousand or two for the picking,
  and possibly a greater haul if he played the game shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"When do you expect to leave for Ronda?"</p>

  <p>"In two days' time," she said, quickly&mdash;so quickly that he realized
  she had worked it out to the hour. "As soon as I am certain that Luke is in
  Ronda I shall go to him."</p>

  <p>"Exactly what will you say to him?" He could not resist asking this
  question, though he realized, even as he spoke the words, that he was guilty
  of a tactical error.</p>

  <p>He saw her stiffen; that cold look came back to the beautiful eyes. "That
  is entirely a matter between Luke and me," she said. "I have made this mess,
  I am afraid, and I must get out of it."</p>

  <p>In his desperation he blundered again. "You owe something to Rex's
  memory," he said. "I don't know what you're feeling about Luke, but there's a
  fact that can't be blinked. Luke could have saved your brother's life;
  instead, when he found he was ruined, he hounded him still further into the
  mire. His god is money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yet he gave me everything," she said, quietly; "and when I refused him
  money, he went away without a word. Don't you realize, Danton, that had he
  gone to his lawyer, had he gone to the courts&mdash;had he done
  anything&mdash;I must have given him the money back, not because he had any
  legal right to it, but because I would not have dared to face a public
  enquiry. He may have been mean, he may have been terribly cruel, but I cannot
  right one wrong with another. That is the consideration which made me give
  back the money to Mr Steele," she went on in a voice less tense, more
  agreeable, almost friendly. "We shall have to thresh out this business of
  Rex&mdash;It's very ugly and hurtful, and I can't think of it calmly even
  now. Luke may have some explanation; there may be a very excellent reason why
  he refused any further help to poor Rex. At any rate, it's my job to find the
  truth."</p>

  <p>He was almost livid with a fury he could hardly disguise. His lips curled
  in a sneer. "It seems to me that the result of your reconciliation&mdash;I
  suppose that's what it is coming to&mdash;will be to leave me in the lurch
  and put me wrong with everybody. Financially it may ruin me. Luke had a big
  influence in the City, and even now the mere suggestion that I was
  antagonistic to him is making a big difference."</p>

  <p>To his surprise she laughed. "Danton," she said, almost gaily, "you're
  making me feel a pig! You don't imagine I would allow a friend of Rex's to
  suffer because of the help he tried to give me?" Danton Morell was puzzled.
  Why was she so cheerful? And then he remembered&mdash;she would be in Ronda
  in a few days, would be united with her husband. The thought made him wince;
  he was beginning to understand how big a place this girl had made for herself
  in his life. It was not like Danton Morell to allow any woman a foothold in
  the cold thing he called a heart; but insensibly, and for some reason which
  he could not understand, she whom he had intended as a dupe had become a
  factor. It was almost unbelievable.</p>

  <p>And with this came another realization that momentarily left him aghast.
  She was in love with her husband!</p>

  <p>He had opened his lips to speak when there came a discreet knock at the
  door and the maid entered.</p>

  <p>"There's a gentleman wishes to see you, madam&mdash;a Mr Haynes."</p>

  <p>Had Margaret been looking at him, she would have seen Danty's face go
  pale.</p>

  <p>"He says he knows Mr Maddison slightly," the girl went on, "and he wants
  particularly to see you."</p>

  <p>Danty gaped at her. "You didn't tell him I was here, did you&mdash;" he
  began and saw the look of astonishment in Margaret's face.</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?" He nodded, and glanced significantly at the girl. "Just
  wait a moment outside, will you?" said Margaret, and, when the maid had gone
  and the door was closed: "Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"He's a man I don't wish to see, and a man I don't think you ought to see.
  He's a criminal, the fellow who was arrested that night at the Ritz-Carlton.
  If you take my advice you'll send him away."</p>

  <p>She hesitated. "If he knows Luke&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't&mdash;that's just a trick to see you. He'll probably want
  money, and he's a pretty dangerous man."</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better be here when he comes," she said, and saw by his
  consternation that this was not an acceptable suggestion. "I'd better see
  him," she said. "Will you wait in the little drawing-room?" Margaret in that
  mood he could not combat; he agreed sulkily to her suggestion, and was in the
  little drawing-room when he heard the quick step of the Gunner pass the
  closed door.</p>

  <p>Margaret was unprepared for the type that came into the drawing-room. The
  tanned, hawk face had a strength and certain refinement which she had not
  expected.</p>

  <p>"Are you Mrs Maddison?" drawled the visitor, and she inclined her head
  slightly. "My name's Haynes&mdash;the police know me as Gunner Haynes. I am a
  jewel thief amongst other things," he said. His tone was as calm as though he
  were announcing himself the member of an honourable guild. "I met your
  husband once; he tried to do me a service&mdash;I should like to do him one,
  Mrs Maddison." Again she nodded. "Mr Danton Morell is a friend of yours,
  isn't he?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said coldly. "Why?"</p>

  <p>She saw his lips twitch. "I was wondering...Mrs Maddison, would you think
  I was impertinent if I asked you why your husband left you?"</p>

  <p>Her steady eyes met his. "Do you think you would be?" she asked, quietly,
  and saw that faint smile of his.</p>

  <p>"I should be a little worse than impertinent. And yet, Mrs Maddison, I
  have a very deep interest in your husband's affairs. I have many bad
  qualities, but disloyalty is not one of them. Your husband went out of his
  way to warn me, at a moment when he knew the police were coming to arrest me.
  If ever there was a white and wholesome man, that man is Luke Maddison. I
  ought not to have asked you the question, and I could not very well expect a
  satisfactory answer. The only thing I am anxious to know is this: have you
  any idea where your husband is?"</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to find him?" she challenged.</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "No, but I'd like to know exactly where he is. I have a
  very special reason for asking this. Is he in London?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "He's in Spain at the moment, but I'm afraid I cannot
  give you the address."</p>

  <p>"Mr Morell&mdash;is he in Spain? Pardon me, Mrs Maddison, but if I have a
  reason for asking you the one question, I have a doubly important reason for
  asking the other. Morell is the kind of man that no decent woman should
  know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She walked to the table and pressed the little onyx bell-push. This time
  he smiled. "That means you're going to turn me out, and I don't blame you.
  I'm afraid I've blundered this interview, which I intended should be very
  discreet and diplomatic. I particularly wished to know where Mr Maddison
  was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have told you," she said, as the maid appeared in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"As far as Danty Morell is concerned&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>Her hand pointed to the door.</p>

  <p>"I am not prepared to discuss my friends&mdash;even with the criminal
  acquaintances of my husband," she said, and she heard him chuckling as he
  went down the stairs as though at a very good joke.</p>

  <p>She waited till she heard the street door close, and went in search of
  Danty, but he was not in the small drawing-room. The maid told her he had
  left within a few seconds of Gunner Haynes' arrival. Danty was not a man who
  took unnecessary risks.</p>

  <p>She had some business to do in the West End of London, and as the
  afternoon progressed she ordered the car to drive her into the park. Near the
  Marble Arch she signalled to the driver to stop, and got out. She wanted the
  walk and the solitude that the park gave her. Here she could think more
  clearly.</p>

  <p>She walked slowly along the asphalt path that runs parallel with the
  roadway. As she did so, she saw a car coming slowly along on the other side
  of the road.</p>

  <p>It was an electric brougham containing two people: a beautiful-looking
  girl, fashionably dressed; by her side, his face half hidden under a
  broad-brimmed Stetson hat, a bearded man of striking appearance. Ahead of her
  was walking a stout-looking man, and by his side a rather pretty girl. As she
  overtook them she heard the stout man say: "Take a look at that swell woman!
  That's Jean Gurlay&mdash;the biggest crook in London, my dear." She
  recognized The Sparrow and his companion, and, not wishing to be seen by
  them, sat down on a garden seat, her eyes following curiously the electric
  brougham.</p>

  <p>She saw the machine turn at Marble Arch and come slowly along by the side
  of the kerb, and she watched with a detached interest the beautiful girl and
  the bearded man, whose head was turned towards his companion. As they passed
  she heard the man say: "This is all very mysterious. What does it mean?" In
  an instant she was on her feet, pale and shaking; for she had recognized the
  voice of the bearded man. It was her husband!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Life in Ginnett Street might be rather amusing, thought Luke
  Maddison.</p>

  <p>It was his third day in his lodging, and he was not averse from his new
  life. He had discovered unsuspected physical weaknesses as he had made his
  way from the hospital, and was glad of a rest, the freedom from worry, the
  utter irresponsibility of this queer life into which he had obtruded.</p>

  <p>Mrs Fraser did not bother him with her presence. She brought in a
  surprisingly interesting collection of books to read, supplied him with plain
  but very wholesome meals, and gave him the freedom of the house, though she
  suggested that he had better only go out at nights. He was mystified by the
  attention she was paying him, though he realized that she was acting on
  behalf of the unknown Connor.</p>

  <p>Some of the mystery was cleared up on the third day, when she asked him a
  number of questions about Australia, a country to which he had never been.
  When he said as much she smiled cryptically.</p>

  <p>"If that Lewing had had as much sense as you, and had kept his mouth shut,
  he might have been alive and well today. If he'd had the sense to keep his
  mouth shut, nobody would have known anything about you. But he was a rare one
  to boast, was Lewing, God rest him, always boasting what his crowd could do
  against our crowd, though he must have known that we had all the money."
  Gradually it came out. Lewing had boasted of a man who was coming from
  Australia to work with his 'crowd.' Luke gathered that the new man had a
  fairly hectic reputation in the Dominion, but that he had never been
  convicted. "The moment Connor heard you were coming, he said: 'That's the man
  for us&mdash;get him.' He reckons that Sydney bank affair was the cleverest
  job that's ever been done."</p>

  <p>Now Luke discovered his identity, and began to piece together the little
  scraps of information he had had from time to time. If Lewing was not the
  brains, or the leader of the Borough gang, he was at least a person of
  considerable importance. It was he who had arranged for the Australian's
  services, and apparently had recruited him by correspondence.</p>

  <p>Luke learned that the gang warfare in South London had a special
  significance. The Borough gang were mainly river thieves, and several of the
  members had grown rich out of the cargoes they had broached.</p>

  <p>"Now let us get this straight, Mrs Fraser. You're under the impression
  that I'm an Australian criminal&mdash;when I say 'you' I mean your
  principals."</p>

  <p>"My how much?" asked Mrs Fraser, puzzled. Luke explained.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not the man you were expecting," he insisted. "The fact that I
  happened to be with Lewing the night he was killed means nothing&mdash;it was
  the purest fluke. I can certainly drive a car, but I'm afraid I can be of
  very little use to your friends, who, I gather, are on the wrong side of the
  law."</p>

  <p>She smiled cryptically at this. "What I like about you, Mr Smith," she
  said, "is that you know how to keep yourself to yourself."</p>

  <p>It was late that night that he saw the redoubtable Connor. As he shook
  hands with the stranger he shuddered, for he had heard that deep voice before
  on the night when Lewing met his end.</p>

  <p>"I shan't want you for a day or two, Smith," said Connor, brusquely.
  "Everything being done for you? That's right." His tone was commanding; it
  was the same voice that had challenged Lewing, but more cultured. Before Luke
  could explain who he was, or at any rate explain who he was not, the man had
  taken his departure. A day or two later came another surprise. There walked
  into his room as he was sitting at the table, a book before him, his head
  upon his hands&mdash;a pretty, fair-haired girl, who eyed him with a certain
  amount of amused interest.</p>

  <p>"Connor sent me down to see you. Did your new clothes arrive?"</p>

  <p>Luke shook his head and smiled. "No," he said. "Am I getting an
  outfit?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him critically. "And you want a barber. I'll have one sent
  up to you tonight. That beard of yours wants trimming. Could you bear taking
  a little drive with me tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>He laughed again. "I could bear worse things than that," he said,
  wondering who she was or whence she had come.</p>

  <p>She was well but not too smartly dressed, and he guessed that her attire
  was designed so that she should not attract too much attention.</p>

  <p>"This is a hole you're in!" she said, contemptuously, looking out on to
  the street. "It must be hell here. How these people manage to exist I don't
  know."</p>

  <p>He said nothing to this; he had gained a working knowledge of these
  children of the poor; had watched in the earlier hours of the dawn the street
  doors open and discharge the workers; had seen the brave, drab wives battling
  to make sixpence do the work of a shilling. At eight-thirty their daughters,
  neatly attired, in flesh coloured stockings and cheaply smart coats, went
  forth to the City, to add theirs to the meagre family resources. The children
  of the poor! The victims of a thousand preying vultures! For the poor are
  robbed as the rich are never robbed. There existed a dozen gangs of little
  sneak-thieves, who would pick their pockets in omnibuses, snatch their bags,
  sneak into their houses when they were out, to collect a few pence worth of
  their poor belongings. He had seen one night a gang of three young ruffians
  attack a middle-aged workman, knock him down, and empty his pockets. He had
  heard of glib men who had come down this street, pretending they had been
  sent by some absent husband to fetch tools he had left behind; and once, to
  his great joy, he had seen a swift car rush through the street and discharge
  half a dozen detectives to the arrest of a bully who had lived on the waves
  of infamy.</p>

  <p>The police gave them what protection they could. He had seen a wife-beater
  lying stark and unconscious on the pavement after a detective had used his
  rubber truncheon on him. But as a rule these human parasites that preyed upon
  the poor escaped unharmed.</p>

  <p>The girl turned from the contemplation of misery.</p>

  <p>"Meet me near the Guards' Memorial in Green Park. I shall be in a car and
  will pick you up," she said. She looked him up and down, admiration in her
  eyes. "You've got a good voice," she said. "You'd pass for a swell."</p>

  <p>The clothes came that night; they fitted him remarkably well, and when the
  promised barber had finished his work, and Luke was arrayed in his new
  clothes, he was almost reconciled to the beard.</p>

  <p>In the interest of his new, strange life he found it fairly easy to
  forget. The spirit of adventure was on him. Margaret belonged to a dim,
  almost unbelievable past. She was of the substance of dreams.</p>

  <p>He went gaily to the rendezvous on the following afternoon, and was
  delighted to find how springy was his step. He had hardly taken his place in
  front of the Guards' Memorial when he saw an electric brougham approach, and,
  catching the girl's signal, stepped to the side of the road as the car
  stopped.</p>

  <p>She was in excellent spirits. "It's a great idea to let yourself be seen
  in a certain kind of car," she said. "You don't know what I mean? I'll bet
  you don't!" They crossed into Hyde Park, made a slow progress near the edge
  of the sidewalk, and he found himself enjoying the novel experience. She was
  very pretty, though older than he had thought. "Do you see that fat man over
  there? That's The Sparrow. You want to keep away from him." He started at the
  name.</p>

  <p>"You mean Bird?" he stammered, and looked guiltily in the direction she
  indicated. He saw Mr Bird. He was walking with a very pretty girl, but the
  woman who was at that moment seating herself on one of the park benches he
  did not recognize.</p>

  <p>As the brougham turned and came back on the other side of the road, she
  said suddenly: There will be a car waiting near the Cavalry Barracks. I hope
  you can drive?"</p>

  <p>"Another car?" he asked in astonishment.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "I want to try you out."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "All this is very mysterious," he said.</p>

  <p>The car was waiting for them, a closed light car of English make. There
  was nobody in attendance, but without hesitation she stopped the brougham and
  gave the driver instructions.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," she said. "Get in." Luke sank into the driver's seat and put
  his foot on the self-starter, and she came in after him, slamming the little
  door behind her. "Grafton Street," she said, in a business-like tone. "Pull
  up opposite the Kean Club." He thought she was testing his driving ability,
  for he had to pass through three traffic blocks before he brought the machine
  to a standstill at the place she indicated.</p>

  <p>"Now you understand," she said, dropping her voice and speaking rapidly,
  "I'm going in to see my husband." She looked him straight in the eyes. "If he
  makes a fuss I shall expect you to help me. If he doesn't make a fuss, we'll
  drive quietly away down Albemarle Street, make for Vauxhall Bridge and
  Tooting Common."</p>

  <p>"Your husband?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>She gave him one quick look of suspicion. "That is what you tell the
  flattie if there is any fuss." What a flattie was she did not explain, and
  was gone before he could ask her. He kept the engine running according to her
  instructions. She was gone some twenty minutes. Presently, looking out, he
  saw her turn the corner from Bond Street and walk with apparent unconcern
  towards him. As she stepped into the car, a man in his shirt-sleeves darted
  round the corner, flew at her and gripped her by the arm.</p>

  <p>She tried to wrench herself free, and before Luke realized what he was
  doing he had struck her assailant and sent him tumbling to the pavement.</p>

  <p>"Drive!" she snapped, and mechanically Luke Maddison sent the machine
  leaping forward.</p>

  <p>They crossed Oxford Street, down St James's Street, through the park, and
  were over Vauxhall Bridge before he partly realized what had happened. "Why
  did that fellow grab you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My husband&mdash;I had a row with him," she said, calmly. And then: "I
  knew Connor was wrong," she said, and whistled. "If I hadn't had my wits
  about me and started that husband story, I'd have been half-way to Holloway!"
  He saw her look at every policeman they passed out of the corner of her eye,
  and his heart was beating faster as they came to the edge of Tooting Common,
  and at her command he stopped the car.</p>

  <p>"We'll get out here," she said. "You can go back by bus, I'll take a taxi.
  If Connor comes tonight, tell him I've got the stuff."</p>

  <p>She turned to go, but he caught her by the arm. "What stuff?" he asked,
  sternly. And then he saw the flat case she carried under her leather coat.
  "My God!" gasped Luke Maddison. "You stole that!"</p>

  <p>There was amusement in her fine eyes as she nodded. "Of course I did, you
  poor simp!" A taxicab was passing and she hailed it.</p>

  <p>Slowly his grip on her arm relaxed. He watched the taxi recede like a man
  in a dream, too stunned even to think. He could never remember that journey
  back to Lambeth. He had crossed Westminster Bridge when he saw a newsboy with
  a placard: "Daring West End Robbery." He stood dead still, gazing
  open-mouthed at the contents bill, and then he felt in his pocket and dropped
  a penny from his trembling hand into the newsboy's palm...</p>

  <p>He dared not look inside the newspaper until he was in a quiet
  street...</p>

  <p>"DARING WEST END ROBBERY Bearded Man and Pretty Girl Rob Taffanny's of
  £20,000 Diamond Necklace</p>

  <p>"A daring robbery was committed this afternoon at Messrs. Taffanny's jewel
  shop in Bond Street. At about 3.50 a well-dressed woman walked into the shop
  and asked to be shown some plain gold rings. Whilst the assistant's back was
  turned, she must have broken a glass case with a rubber-headed hammer.</p>

  <p>"When he came back, he found not only the woman but a valuable diamond
  necklace had disappeared. He flew out into the street and overtook the woman
  as she was entering a motor-car. He was immediately struck down by her
  companion, who is described as a man of great height, with a fair, well
  trimmed beard, dressed in a grey tweed suit..."</p>

  <p>"That's me!" groaned Luke Maddison, and almost swooned.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Luke Maddison sat in his little room in Ginnett Street, his
  head upon his hands, his mind a great confusion. Mrs Fraser had not been in
  the shop parlour when he passed through, and was apparently unconscious of
  his return. But this was not the fact, he discovered, when, a quarter of an
  hour afterwards, she came in with a cup of tea.</p>

  <p>He had the feeling that she was well aware of what had happened that
  afternoon, although she made no reference to his terrifying adventure until
  she seemed at the point of departure. "Connor says that the only danger is
  that some of the Lewing mob may put up a squeak."</p>

  <p>"What is a squeak?" asked Luke, and she smiled amiably and admiringly.</p>

  <p>"What a one you are! But perhaps in Australia they don't have these
  expressions."</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair. "Do you know what strikes me, Mrs Fraser?" he
  said, calmly. "That every person in this street who reads the description
  will recognize me? About a hundred people must have seen me walking down
  Ginnett Street&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I know everybody in the neighbourhood and what
  they're doing," she said, calmly. "The only man who saw you is old Joe who
  runs errands for me. Connor says you ought to cut that beard of yours and get
  another suit. I'll take away the one you're wearing, if you'll change."</p>

  <p>"Into what?" he demanded, with some asperity.</p>

  <p>"There's a blue suit in the drawer; it came when you were out this
  afternoon," she said, and went away.</p>

  <p>For a quarter of an hour he sat and watched his tea growing cold, his mind
  vacillating between horror and amusement. He, Luke Maddison, was a thief, a
  gangster, an active member of an organization which had robbed Taffanny's! He
  knew Taffanny's rather well; he had bought Margaret's engagement ring over
  the very glass counter that had been smashed. He was helpless&mdash;the idea
  of going to the police and betraying his associates never occurred to him.
  There was only one thing to be done and that was to steal away at the first
  opportunity. He had written for his cheque-book to be sent to Ronda, and it
  was a simple matter to reach Spain. Was it, though?</p>

  <p>With a gasp he realized that he had no passport. And without a passport it
  was impossible to reach Spain, of all countries, where every man and woman
  who passed across the frontier was closely scrutinized. If he had not
  dismissed his servant, it would be easy to creep back to his flat one night,
  pack a bag, and fade away into a continental limbo. But probably his
  solicitor had the key of the flat. A new hope awakened. Hulbert had an
  apartment in St James's Street. He was a bachelor and accessible.</p>

  <p>Luke dismissed from his mind his experience of the afternoon. That was
  something not to be thought of without a shudder&mdash;he was whistling
  cheerfully when Mrs Fraser came with a pair of bright, new scissors, to
  collect the grey tweed suit he had discarded, and to bring him a pair of
  brown shoes, so hideously bright that they dazzled him.</p>

  <p>"Connor says you'd better leave your moustache," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Where is Connor? Is he on the premises?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No, he 'phoned me."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you had a 'phone," he said, in surprise.</p>

  <p>Mrs Fraser smiled cryptically. "We've got lots of things here that people
  don't know anything about," she said.</p>

  <p>She came back a little later with a tube of shaving paste, a brand new
  lather brush, and a razor which had evidently been purchased recently, for
  when he opened the case he found it still enclosed in oil paper. Shaving was
  a painful process in spite of this, but apparently the results were
  satisfactory, for when the woman brought him some food later she stood in the
  doorway and gaped her approval.</p>

  <p>"Well, I should never have known you, Mr Smith," she said, "and I'll bet
  your best friend wouldn't know you!" As to this Luke was perfectly convinced.
  What an extraordinary change a moustache made in a man's appearance! To him
  it lent a touch of the sinister&mdash;he stood gazing, fascinated, at his
  reflection in the mirror.</p>

  <p>Mrs Fraser seemed more inclined to be conversational than she had been
  before; asked him if he was married, and before he could answer, announced
  herself as a widow.</p>

  <p>"At least, practically," she amended the statement. "My husband got a
  lifer two years ago." She was quite cheerful about this calamity, and Luke
  gathered that life had not run any too smoothly for the woman.</p>

  <p>"He asked for it," she said. "Shot a copper and nearly killed him; and
  naturally, Connor wouldn't stand for that. Connor says a gun's all right for
  the heads, but not for the unders. Fraser was that kind&mdash;flash! He tried
  everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Had he been in prison before?"</p>

  <p>She smiled amusedly. "Why, of course! He did two stretches." Luke did not
  ask what a stretch might be: he had a vague idea that it meant penal
  servitude.</p>

  <p>"He did one stretch," said the communicative Mrs Fraser, "for a swindle up
  in Manchester&mdash;he and Danty were in it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Luke's jaw dropped. "Danty?" he said, incredulously. "Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"He's a con man&mdash;you must have heard of him. I think he's straight
  now, but you can never tell. He lives up west, knows all the swells, and has
  got a flat in Jermyn Street. He and Gunner Haynes used to work
  together&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gunner Haynes&mdash;you know him?" asked Luke, quickly. From her
  expression and tone he gathered that Haynes was a person of some importance
  in the hierarchy of the underworld.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't know him, I've only heard of him. But what do they call Danty
  now?" She frowned in an effort of memory. "I had it on the tip of my
  tongue&mdash;a swell name. Danton Morell&mdash;that's it! Connor told me only
  the other day about him."</p>

  <p>The room seemed to swim before Luke Maddison's eyes. Danton Morell&mdash;a
  confidence man, an ex-convict? It was incredible! And then suddenly he had
  the stunning realization that Danty Morell was his wife's best friend!</p>

  <p>"What is he like in appearance?"</p>

  <p>"Danty? I've seen him two or three times..." She described Morell in her
  homely language. There was no doubt at all that this was the man! More
  vitally necessary was it that he should escape from this environment and
  reappear as Luke Maddison. His vague plans became definite. He would leave
  the house that night, seek out Hulbert, and tell him the truth.</p>

  <p>At nine o'clock that night he was preparing to leave when an unexpected
  difficulty arose. He was just about to turn out the light when Mrs Fraser
  appeared.</p>

  <p>She closed the door behind her, and from her manner he gathered that
  something serious had happened.</p>

  <p>"Two of the Lewing crowd are down below," she said, in a low voice. "I
  haven't had a chance to call up Connor; the 'phone is in the parlour, and
  they came in before I knew what was happening." She had something hidden
  under her apron, and when she withdrew her hand he saw that it was a small
  Browning pistol.</p>

  <p>"Put that in your sky," she said, urgently. "You don't know what these
  fellows are after."</p>

  <p>"In my&mdash;?" he began, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"In your pocket," she said, impatiently. "Do as you're told." Mechanically
  he took the pistol from her hand and slipped it into his hip pocket.</p>

  <p>The one thing he did not wish to challenge was a scene with two members of
  the rival gang. It was vital that he should get away from Ginnett Street with
  the least possible delay, and if this pistol helped him it was welcome.</p>

  <p>"They want to see you&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>And than a voice from the foot of the narrow stairs.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Smith!" There was menace in the tone. Mrs Fraser flung open the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" she said, sharply. "Who do you think you are?" Luke heard a
  grumbling voice, and the slam of the door which separated the foot of the
  stairs from the parlour. And then, at the beckoning jerk of the woman's head,
  he followed her down the stairs.</p>

  <p>There were two men in the parlour. One stood with his back to the fire,
  the other significantly near the door that gave egress to the shop. They were
  respectably dressed, and Luke thought that, if he had seen them in the
  street, he would have thought they were decent artisans. There was certainly
  nothing sinister in either face. One was tall and rather stout, the other a
  slightly built man, who wore as his necktie the colours of a cavalry
  regiment.</p>

  <p>The big man, who stood with his back to the fire, lowered his chin to his
  breast, and looked at Luke from under his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Is this Smith?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That is Mr Smith," said Mrs Fraser, primly.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea of your coming here and pretending you're somebody you're
  not?" asked the little man by the door with extraordinary rapidity.</p>

  <p>His big companion silenced him.</p>

  <p>"You shut up. I'll do all the talking, Curly," he said. "You did that job
  today, didn't you, Smith?"</p>

  <p>"I've done many jobs," said Luke, coolly.</p>

  <p>"You're pretending you're a fellow named Smith, whom our governor brought
  over from Australia&mdash;no, I'm not talking about Lewing; he was nobody.
  Swank killed him, and he's well dead. But you're not Smith." He pointed a
  finger to the man at the door. "That's Curly Smith."</p>

  <p>"I'll say I am!" The little man was quivering with anger; he spoke with a
  shrill Cockney whine. "You've been using my name"&mdash;he qualified the name
  with a violent adjective.</p>

  <p>The stout man by the fire rebuked him.</p>

  <p>"There are ladies present." he said, with such solemnity that Luke almost
  laughed at the incongruity of the reproach.</p>

  <p>"The point is," said the big man, who, Luke discovered, was named Verdi,
  "you was picked up when Lewing was chived, and you got yours, too, and
  naturally Connor thought you were the man that Lewing was supposed to meet
  off the boat in the London Docks. And instead of going to meet him, Lewing
  got cold feet, because he thought the Connor lot were after him for a squeak.
  But you're not Smith, and I'll take my oath you've never been to
  Australia."</p>

  <p>"Him!" Curly Smith was quivering with contempt. "That feller couldn't get
  a living in Australia!" He suddenly tugged a newspaper from his side pocket.
  "Do you see what you've done for me?" he hissed, and thrust the paper under
  Luke's nose.</p>

  <p>Luke Maddison read the paragraph which the grimy thumb of the man
  stabbed.</p>

  <p>"In connection with this robbery the police are seeking information
  concerning a man named Smith, who landed a few weeks ago from the Orient
  liner Pontiac."</p>

  <p>"Do you see what you've done?" repeated Smith, savagely. "You've got the
  dicks after me!" His hand strayed to his trousers pocket.</p>

  <p>"Steady your mitt!" growled Verdi. "This bird's got a gat&mdash;what do
  you think the old woman went up to see him about?"</p>

  <p>Mrs Fraser flamed at the insult. "Old, am I, you fat snail! We'll see what
  Connor says to that! He'll be here in five minutes."</p>

  <p>Verdi glanced uneasily at the door. "Bluff," he said. "Anyway, Connor
  can't complain if we come round to make a few enquiries. We're entitled to a
  bit of information."</p>

  <p>"Do you want to see me any more?" said Luke, and moved towards the door.
  Curly Smith stood squarely in his way.</p>

  <p>"We want to know&mdash;" began Verdi.</p>

  <p>"You know all you're likely to know," said Luke, curtly.</p>

  <p>He took another step forward, but Smith did not move. Suddenly Luke's hand
  shot out, gripped the little man and swung him across the room. It was not a
  moment to compromise or to argue; instinctively he knew he was taking the
  right line as he pulled the door wide open.</p>

  <p>"Get outside, both of you!" he said.</p>

  <p>Verdi shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," he said. "We don't want any unpleasantness." He was
  smiling when he came abreast of Luke; but Mrs Fraser had slipped to the other
  side of the table, and saw the life-preserver he carried in his right
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Look out!" she cried shrilly.</p>

  <p>As the deadly little stick rose, Luke struck for the man's jaw, and he
  went over with a crash against the wooden partition which separated the shop
  from the parlour.</p>

  <p>For a moment he was stunned, and in that time Luke had jerked the life
  preserver from the man's hand (a leather cord attached to it was twisted
  round his wrist), and dropped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Come on, you." He beckoned Curly Smith, and the little man sidled nimbly
  past him.</p>

  <p>Verdi was on his feet by now, a little dazed, blinking with his pale blue
  eyes at the man who had knocked him down.</p>

  <p>"All right," he said, and went heavily after his companion.</p>

  <p>Luke closed the door with some difficulty, for the fall of the man against
  the partition had thrown the door out of true. Mrs Fraser was very pale and
  her breath was coming quickly.</p>

  <p>"I've never known them Lewings to do that before," she said. "I wouldn't
  be surprised if they didn't start a fire." They had taken this course once
  before, Luke learned to his horror and amazement&mdash;that explained the new
  annexe to the house. 339 Ginnett Street was obviously Connor's headquarters.
  The place had never been raided&mdash;for the matter of that, it had never
  held a pennyworth of stolen property.</p>

  <p>He learned now, in the burst of confidence which apprehension inspired,
  that although the rival gang was called Lewing's, the dead man had had very
  little to do with its organization. There had been a coterie of irresponsible
  larrikins and shop thieves, and this had been the nucleus of a more important
  gang, of which Lewing, at the moment of his death, was the merest
  servant.</p>

  <p>"He was just a little thief and a nose." (this was an informer, Luke
  learned), said Mrs Fraser. "Why, he was in stir a few days before he was
  killed."</p>

  <p>Luke nodded. He remembered the occasion of Lewing's first visit to him. He
  had been in Brixton Prison with Gunner Haynes, and had come in a fraudulent
  spirit to collect money on behalf of the Gunner.</p>

  <p>"There's going to be some trouble&mdash;the Lewings have never done this
  before," repeated Mrs Fraser. "I must let Connor know about it&mdash;you
  going out?" Luke was going out, and never intended returning. This latter
  piece of information he did not pass to his hostess.</p>

  <p>"Have you got any money? Oh, that reminds me." The woman searched in a
  leather bag which she carried beneath her apron and produced a small package
  of notes. "Connor sent this&mdash;It's fifty," she said. "It's only on
  account. That stuff has got to be cut four ways, and you'll get your share.
  Connor's always straight about money. You could trust him with a million
  pounds."</p>

  <p>"I don't want this."</p>

  <p>"Put it in your pocket," she commanded, and as he did not wish to prolong
  the conversation he obeyed. "Have you got any small money?"</p>

  <p>"I have plenty," he said, almost impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Small money," she insisted, and he had reason to be thankful for her
  insistence. He had not, and again she dived her hand under the apron and
  produced some silver and coppers. "If you try to pass fivers in this country
  you'll get yourself into trouble," she said. And then: "Are you
  Australian?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Luke.</p>

  <p>She was troubled at this, but her face cleared up. "I expect Connor knows
  all about it." Evidently the word of Connor was something more than law.</p>

  <p>She accompanied him to the door of the shop. When she found it was raining
  she went back herself to get his mackintosh.</p>

  <p>"Watch out for the Lewings," she warned him, "and keep that gat in your
  pocket where you can reach it." She fussed over him like a family nurse
  might; was not satisfied till he had taken the automatic from his hip and
  dropped it into the slip pocket of his waterproof.</p>

  <p>Why was a pistol called a gat, he wondered. Probably it was an
  abbreviation of gatling, and was obviously an Americanism.</p>

  <p>There was nobody in the street, but he took the precaution, on Mrs
  Fraser's advice, of making a wide detour, and ten minutes later he was
  walking across Westminster Bridge. Parliament was sitting; the clock in the
  big tower pointed to twenty minutes to ten.</p>

  <p>First he must see Jack Hulbert, that sane young solicitor of his. It
  struck him that there was a possibility that Jack might not be alone...The
  telephone of course! He stopped at the first public booth and put through a
  call. And here it was he was thankful to Mrs Fraser for her coppers.</p>

  <p>The voice of Mr Hulbert's servant answered him.</p>

  <p>"I want to speak to Mr Hulbert," he said, and to his horror the reply
  came: "Mr Hulbert is not in England, sir; he has gone to Berlin on a holiday
  and will not be back till next week. Who is it speaking?"</p>

  <p>Luke for a moment was speechless; when the question was repeated he had an
  inspiration. "Can you tell me if Mr Luke Maddison's flat is occupied&mdash;is
  his servant there?"</p>

  <p>The tone of the man changed. "Who are you, and why do you want to know
  that?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Luke rang off without explanation. He might have told the man who he was,
  but he was chary of confiding in servants, and it was particularly
  undesirable that he should betray his presence in London to anybody except
  Jack.</p>

  <p>And then a thought struck him and he called the number of his own flat. He
  waited for fully five minutes listening to the faint buzz of the call, and
  then the operator said: "I'm sorry, sir, there's no reply from that number."
  Luke made a slow way to the Mall, and walked slowly towards Buckingham
  Palace, oblivious of the rain, which was now falling in earnest. There was
  only one thing to be done, and by the time he reached the end of the Mall he
  had made his plans. He had often remarked jokingly how easy it was to burgle
  his flat. Recently there had been erected a new fire-escape at the back of
  the block in which he had his residence, and access to the yard where the
  escape touched earth was by no means difficult. He could climb the wall from
  the mews which ran at the back of the flat; he knew exactly how the window
  could be forced.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Margaret Maddison was preparing for bed when the street bell
  rang. She opened the door of her room and listened: somebody was talking in
  the hall below; she heard her footman's and a deeper voice, and then somebody
  said: "You'd better go up and tell the lady. I must see her...Scotland Yard."
  She sent her maid down to find out what was the matter, and in a few minutes
  the girl came back.</p>

  <p>"It's an Inspector from Scotland Yard, madam. He wants to see you on a
  matter of importance."</p>

  <p>"Is it Mr Bird?" she asked, anxiously. Why she should be anxious at all
  she could not for the moment understand. Later she realized that it was the
  knowledge that Scotland Yard was a carrier of unpleasant news, and that
  possibly something might have happened to Luke, which sent her down to the
  drawing-room so quickly.</p>

  <p>It was not Bird, but a stranger, who introduced himself as Divisional
  Inspector Gorton. "I'm sorry to bother you at this time of night, Mrs
  Maddison," he said, "but we've had a report sent to us by the servant of Mr
  Hulbert, the solicitor&mdash;I believe he is your husband's solicitor?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, and drew a quick breath. "Is anything wrong&mdash;I mean, with
  Mr Maddison?"</p>

  <p>"No, ma'am, It's not serious&mdash;in fact, it may be nothing at all. But
  this valet of Mr Hulbert's says that he had an enquiry from a strange man
  tonight as to whether your husband's flat was occupied&mdash;he also said
  that you had the key of the flat."</p>

  <p>Margaret nodded. The key had been in her possession since a few days after
  Luke's departure. His man had brought it; it was at that moment in her
  desk.</p>

  <p>"I understand Mr Maddison's abroad?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, he is in Ronda," she said, quickly. "You can have the key."</p>

  <p>Inspector Gorton hesitated. "I'd rather like you to come along with us,
  madam," he said. "I promise you there's not the slightest danger, but we do
  not like searching houses until there is a representative of the owner
  present."</p>

  <p>"What do you expect to find?&mdash;I'll come with pleasure," she said.</p>

  <p>"You can wait outside in your car, madam...What do we expect to find?
  Well, there is a possibility that the man who called up intended burgling the
  flat, and we want to be on the safe side."</p>

  <p>She went upstairs and finished dressing, put on a raincoat, and
  accompanied the policeman into the street. A car was drawn up, with two or
  three men sitting in the back, and she was invited to take her place by the
  side of the driver. They came very quickly to the entrance of Luke's
  flat.</p>

  <p>"No, no, I'll come up with you," she said. "I've only been in it twice,
  but I'll probably be able to help your find you way about."</p>

  <p>It was not a pleasant experience, walking into that familiar hall, looking
  at the dusty furnishings. The place was peculiarly Luke's, had something of
  his aura, and it gave her a little pang to realize that Luke might never come
  here again.</p>

  <p>"There's a fire-escape here, isn't there? Where does it touch?"</p>

  <p>"The kitchen," she said.</p>

  <p>The inspector sent one of his men to search that apartment; then suddenly
  he sniffed.</p>

  <p>"Somebody's been smoking a cigar here, and smoking it recently," he
  said.</p>

  <p>Margaret, too, had smelt the faint fragrance. At that moment the detective
  sent to look at the kitchen came running back.</p>

  <p>"The window's been forced!" he said.</p>

  <p>Again Gorton nodded. Evidently he expected to hear this. "Which is Mr
  Maddison's room?" She pointed. A key was already inserted in the lock. The
  detective turned the handle. The door did not move: it was bolted on the
  inside.</p>

  <p>"Out you come, son!" he said in a loud voice as he rapped on the panel.
  "It's a cop!" He turned to the girl.</p>

  <p>"You'd better go downstairs, Mrs Maddison&mdash;we're going to break in
  this door!" Luke Maddison, standing on the other side of the door, listening,
  heard the words and gasped. His wife was there&mdash;the one person in the
  world who must not see him!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">With her heart beating a little faster, Margaret passed down
  the stairs. When she reached the street she found that the driver of the
  police car had summoned a taxi, which was drawn up behind the tender.</p>

  <p>"Is anybody there, madam?" asked a police officer.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think there is," she said, breathlessly. "At least, the inspector
  thinks so."</p>

  <p>"You'd better get into the cab, madam," said the police officer. "I
  suppose Mr Gorton expects a bit of a fight."</p>

  <p>"Do you often have cases like this?"</p>

  <p>"About every other day," he said, cheerfully. "We're one of the Flying
  Squads." Apparently it was quite usual for the Squad to be called to
  buildings where suspected burglars were. They moved with the celerity of a
  fire-engine and were as alert.</p>

  <p>Inspector Gorton waited until Margaret had left the building, and then he
  rapped again on the panel. "Open this door, my son." The bolt was slipped
  back, the door flung open. The inspector saw a man with grimy face and
  disordered clothing standing in the doorway, and instantly he was seized.</p>

  <p>Luke was taken aback. He had expected an opportunity of parleying, even of
  taking the detective into his confidence. Resenting the sudden seizure, he
  tried to shake off the detaining hands, and in the next instant was flung
  violently to the ground. Somebody passed their hands scientifically behind
  his coat.</p>

  <p>"He's got a gat," said a voice.</p>

  <p>The pistol was passed to Inspector Gorton.</p>

  <p>"I can explain the gun," said Luke.</p>

  <p>"I dare say you can." Gorton snapped back the jacket of the automatic and
  detached the magazine. "Loaded&mdash;you'll get a ten stretch for this, my
  lad. Fan him, one of you: he may have another." In two minutes Luke was
  searched.</p>

  <p>"Where did you get this money?" asked the inspector.</p>

  <p>"It was given to me&mdash;" began Luke, and there was a roar of
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"What is this?" said Gorton, examining something in his hand.</p>

  <p>That morning, before he had left on his fatal expedition, Mrs Fraser had
  handed him a little blue-covered book.</p>

  <p>"A driving licence, eh? You weren't by any chance driving a car today
  round about Bond Street, were you?"</p>

  <p>Luke's heart sank within him. And then he heard one of the detectives say:
  "That's the fellow! He had a beard this afternoon. I saw him driving with a
  woman in the park." He whispered something to Gorton and the inspector
  nodded. All the time Luke was thinking rapidly. That simple explanation of
  his was no longer possible. If he declared himself to be Luke Maddison, he
  must also explain what he had been doing since he disappeared. The
  realization of that came with shocking emphasis.</p>

  <p>And he knew that below, Margaret was waiting and would recognize him
  instantly in spite of his moustache.</p>

  <p>Ahead of him was the open door leading to the hall. To the right the
  little room he had used as a dressing-room. The window was right above the
  first landing of the fire-escape. Luke had a horror of fires, and it was his
  favourite amusement to plan out how he would escape from a burning building.
  If he could get to that room...</p>

  <p>It did not seem possible.</p>

  <p>Somebody spoke from the landing outside. It was the hall porter, who had
  called to discover what the commotion was about. The two detectives who were
  guarding the door turned their backs for a moment, and in that instant Luke
  Maddison leapt.</p>

  <p>He was something of an athlete; he had played for his fifteen at college,
  and had nothing to learn about the art of avoiding a tackle. He dashed
  through the door of the dressing-room, banged it tight and shot in the bolt
  as the weight of the two men was flung against it.</p>

  <p>This was no moment for caution. He flung up the window and his legs went
  almost ill the same motion. In another second he dropped into the darkness.
  He had calculated well. The steel platform of the fire-escape clanged under
  his feet. In another instant he was flying down the steps and was over the
  wall before the first of the detectives reached the head of the escape.</p>

  <p>A man was lounging in the mews: he turned with a shout as Luke dropped.
  But Luke was off like the wind. His long stay in hospital had thrown him out
  of condition, but he had all the technique of a runner. As he emerged from
  the narrow entrance of the mews he saw a cab passing, and leapt on the
  running-board.</p>

  <p>"Paddington." he said, and swung himself deftly inside.</p>

  <p>Evidently the driver was in some doubt as to whether he should continue.
  He went about two blocks and them pulled the car up by the side of the
  kerb.</p>

  <p>"Where have you come from?" he asked. "I can't take you, guv'nor. You look
  as if you were running away from somebody."</p>

  <p>"I was," said Luke.</p>

  <p>It was not a moment to argue. He threw a two-shilling piece into the man's
  hand, turned down a narrow street conveniently near, and, doubling back,
  reached the main road. Here he found a taxi moving at leisure, and a driver
  who did not question his bona fides.</p>

  <p>"Scotland Yard," he said.</p>

  <p>He had made a sudden resolution. He would go to The Sparrow, tell him the
  truth, and trust to that shrewd man to see him through his troubles.</p>

  <p>The cab drew up at the entrance of Scotland Yard and Luke went swiftly
  down the declivity and into the gloomy entrance hall. A police officer on
  duty challenged him, and he stated his requirements.</p>

  <p>"Mr Bird's been gone for two hours, sir. I think he's gone into the
  country. Would you like to see anybody else?"</p>

  <p>Groaning inwardly, Luke shook his head. "No, I don't think anybody else
  would be of much use to me," he said.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't like to see Mr Gorton? He'll be back soon," said the police
  officer, quite ignorant of the fact that the one person in the world whom
  Luke did not wish to see was that same Gorton.</p>

  <p>He came out on to the Thames Embankment at one end of the yard as Gorton
  and his Flying Squad came in at the other. Turning left, he walked towards
  Waterloo Bridge. At Charing Cross Underground he made another attempt to get
  into touch with The Sparrow. There was a chance that the policeman was wrong
  and that Bird was still in town. He went to the telephone directory, but
  there were so many Birds that it was impossible to tell which was which. And
  then he remembered one of his initials&mdash;an unusual "Z" (Mr Bird's middle
  name was Zachariah). He scanned the list again, and, going into the telephone
  booth, gave a number.</p>

  <p>At first he thought his luck was in. "Yes, this is Mr Bird's house," said
  a voice, "but he's out of town. Who is it speaking?"</p>

  <p>"It is vitally necessary that I should get in touch with him as soon as
  possible," said Luke urgently. "Can you tell me where I can find him?"</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"Will you tell him it's Mr Maddison speaking? I have been to Scotland
  Yard..."</p>

  <p>He felt a sudden draught. The door of the telephone booth was ajar; an
  unconcerned man was standing near-by, and apparently had no interest either
  in him or his conversation. Luke shut the door again, and then, to his
  annoyance, found that whoever had spoken for Mr Bird had hung up her
  receiver. Still, that was a start. He almost felt a sense of relief as he
  came out on to the cold Embankment and pursued his way towards Waterloo.</p>

  <p>He had not gone twenty yards before two men, walking quickly, overtook him
  and fell in one at each side. "Hullo, Smith! Connor wants to see you." He had
  never seen the man before. His tone was offensive and peremptory.</p>

  <p>"And who may Mr Connor be?" asked Luke coolly. "My name is not Smith, it
  is Maddison."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, sir," said the other more respectfully, "but Mr Connor
  does want to see you pretty badly."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" asked Luke, after a moment's thought.</p>

  <p>"At the top of Savoy Hill&mdash;there goes the Squad." A car flashed past
  at that moment; the red light disappeared along the Embankment.</p>

  <p>"They call 'em busies, and they are busy," said the second man,
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>They did not go up Savoy Hill, but turned aside, passed one entrance of
  the Savoy Hotel and up a steep and narrow street. They turned again to the
  right.</p>

  <p>"Where is Connor?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you in a minute, when I've got a light for my fag," said the
  smaller of the two.</p>

  <p>He struck a match, and Luke's eyes instinctively went to it. That is all
  he remembered. He did not feel the pain of any blow, but dropped limply to
  the pavement under the impact of a rubber cosh.</p>

  <p>His head was splitting when he came to his senses. He was lying on the
  hard floor of a jolting motor car...he discovered afterwards it was a tilting
  Ford wagon that bore innocuously enough the name of a respectable firm of
  greengrocers. The two men were squatting by his side; one was smoking, and
  they were carrying on a conversation in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"...That's what Connor told me," said one. "But then, Connor thought this
  nut would put up a squeak." Luke lay motionless; his head was throbbing, but
  he felt no other discomfort. Apparently, although he could guess there was a
  bump as big as an egg on his skull, it had not drawn blood.</p>

  <p>The car stopped. There was the creak of a gate being opened, and it went
  forward again, jolting over uneven ground; presently it stopped, and the
  engine was shut off.</p>

  <p>"Are you awake?" asked a voice.</p>

  <p>"I'm awake all right," said Luke.</p>

  <p>"Then get out of this. Why was you so foolish, Smith?" A mild question
  from a man who, only ten minutes before, had stunned him.</p>

  <p>He slithered out of the back of the car and came to his feet on soft,
  muddy ground. The cold night air made him reel; one of the men caught him by
  the arm and guided him into what looked to be a small cottage. To the right
  he saw the gleam of the river. A tug was moving, her green starboard light
  reflected in the water. So quickly was she moving that he guessed she was
  going downstream. He must therefore be on the Surrey side of the Thames.</p>

  <p>He could see nothing but a high wall to his right, and far away a
  blood-red advertisement sign. The door banged on him. There was a smell of
  dampness, but apparently the cottage had some sort of furnishing, for he
  walked upon something that might have been a carpet, when a door was opened
  on his right and he was pushed in; he found himself in a room, not only
  furnished, but over-furnished.</p>

  <p>Connor was sitting at a table shuffling a pack of cards. He looked up as
  Luke entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Did you have to cosh him?" he asked, pleasantly.</p>

  <p>The man who held Luke's arm grinned. "He wouldn't be sensible," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Sit down." Connor pointed to a horsehair sofa against the wall, and Luke
  was glad to accept the invitation. "Tried to put up a squeak, did you,
  Smith?" There was nothing unfriendly in Connor's tone, but he did not cease
  shuffling the cards as he spoke. "I thought you were a man when you did that
  bust&mdash;yes, one of my lads saw you get into that flat, and saw you when
  you bolted. But you're nothing better than a dirty squeaker. Went into the
  Yard and asked for The Sparrow, did you? Is he a pal of yours?"</p>

  <p>"I know him," said Luke.</p>

  <p>Mr Connor nodded pleasantly. "And then you tried to get him on the
  'phone&mdash;what was the squeak about? Don't trouble to tell me: I know. I
  never trusted you from the first, Smith&mdash;I don't trust Australians."</p>

  <p>Despite his aching head, Luke could not but smile at this libel. "I
  shouldn't think they trust you a great deal, do they?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not much," said Connor. He cut the pack into two, shuffled them
  scientifically, and all the time his eyes were on Luke. "So you know The
  Sparrow? That's good. I'll bet you know Danty, too."</p>

  <p>Luke started. "Danty Morell?" he asked. Why had Danty gone out of his
  mind? Why had he forgotten that Danty was the confidant of his
  wife&mdash;that his one desire, in seeking freedom from the sinister
  environment in which he found himself, had been to expose that confidence
  man?</p>

  <p>"Know Danty, too!" Connor's voice was almost admiring. "And Pi Coles?"</p>

  <p>Luke nodded. "Yes, Coles&mdash;that's his servant."</p>

  <p>Connor smiled broadly, and there were grins on the faces of the other two
  men. "Pi is his servant all right. You seem to know the whole darned shoot!
  I'm telling you, Smith, that a man that knows Danty and the Lewing gang, and
  calls at Scotland Yard to see his friend The Sparrow, isn't a healthy fellow
  to have around the house." There was a long pause, and then he added: "That's
  why you're not going to be around the house." He looked up at one of the men
  thoughtfully. "When is high tide?"</p>

  <p>"Four o'clock."</p>

  <p>Connor nodded. Again his dark eyes fell on Luke. "You a good swimmer?"</p>

  <p>"Fair," said Luke, coolly.</p>

  <p>"We'll give you a little dip tonight." said Connor. "Put him in the
  cooler, Harry."</p>

  <p>The man who had struck him gripped Luke by the arm and pulled him to his
  feet. The throbbing was easier now; he did not reel, had recovered something
  of his strength; but this was not a moment for its exhibition.</p>

  <p>Evidently the building was not an extensive one. It had been the
  weighing-room of a company that had once owned the wharf and small warehouse
  which Connor used as a headquarters.</p>

  <p>Connor carried on a legitimate if unprofitable business. He was a dealer
  in certain building material, and barges came regularly, but at rare
  intervals, to this wharf and were unloaded. He bought and sold scrap-iron,
  cement, any commodity which offered an immediate profit. The wharf could be,
  and was, hired for a fee.</p>

  <p>A few paces from the door of the sitting-room they came to another. Luke
  could not help wondering whether the little chamber into which he was thrust
  had been used before for the same purpose. It had no windows, but in other
  respects was curiously like a prison cell. It might have been employed for
  the storage of coal, but there was nothing in it now, not even a bed or a
  stool. In the light of the man's electric torch he saw that the walls were of
  brick and whitewashed. Then the door slammed on him; he heard a bolt shot,
  and he was left alone with the unpleasant knowledge that it would be high
  tide in five hours, and that Mr Connor, in his amiable way, had planned "a
  dip" for him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Margaret had waited a long time for Mr Gorton to come out,
  and when he appeared he was in so great a hurry that he could only tell her
  the bare fact that he had found a man in the room and that he had escaped. It
  was the hall porter who supplied her with greater, and in some respects, less
  accurate, information.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam, the police found a man in Mr Maddison's room...I caught a
  glimpse of him just before he got away. Good-looking fellow with a moustache,
  and, according to the police, a pretty desperate burglar&mdash;they found a
  revolver on him. Perhaps you'd like to go up and see the flat, madam?"</p>

  <p>Margaret hesitated. "Yes, I will," she said, and the man took her up in
  the lift.</p>

  <p>A detective had been left in charge of the disordered room; apparently she
  was expected, for he displayed some relief on her arrival.</p>

  <p>"You don't want me to stay, madam? Inspector Gorton told me that he'd like
  a list of anything missing, and he'll come and see you in the morning." He
  showed her the room where the "burglar" had been. Drawers had been pulled
  out, a desk had been broken open (Luke had lost the key), papers littered the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"Mr Gorton doesn't know even now what he was looking for," said the
  detective. "There was a gold watch in one of the drawers, but he didn't touch
  that. We know he was after the clothes." He showed her a big suit-case into
  which clothing had been thrown pell-mell. There was a dress suit, half a
  dozen shirts and collars, a wad of pocket handkerchiefs, and a suit of
  pyjamas.</p>

  <p>"But he must have spent a lot of time over the desk," said the officer.
  "One of my mates said that he had something like a book between his shirt and
  his skin. He'd just felt it when he broke away and made his escape."</p>

  <p>"A book?" said Margaret, quickly. "How very odd!" And then her eyes fell
  upon an envelope on the floor, and she recognized it immediately. It bore the
  official stamp of the Passport Office, and Luke had had it in his pocket the
  day before the wedding, and had shown it to her in that half-shy and
  half-amused way of his that sometimes irritated her. It was his new passport,
  decorated, rather prematurely, with a portrait of his wife. He had opened it
  in her presence, and she had been rather annoyed because he had
  light-heartedly forged her name in order to present her with the document on
  her wedding day.</p>

  <p>She picked up the envelope; there was nothing inside it&mdash;this, then,
  was the book which the burglar had stolen&mdash;why?</p>

  <p>There were several sheets of notepaper on the floor. She picked up one,
  read it, and gasped. The date had been scrawled in on the top line, and it
  began: "My dear Hulbert, I am in a most terrible&mdash;" It was Luke's
  writing! It was Luke who had been there that night. She found another sheet
  covered with smudged writing; this also was addressed to the solicitor, but
  the three scrawled lines were undecipherable. He had deliberately crossed
  them out. Evidently he had sat down to write a letter to Hulbert, had made
  two attempts, and then had changed his mind.</p>

  <p>It was so like Luke: he could never resist the temptation offered by a
  sheet of notepaper&mdash;he must write to somebody, he had often told her.
  Luke had been here; Luke was the burglar. But why?</p>

  <p>She turned to the detective, and it was on the tip of her tongue to make
  the revelation when he said something that struck speech from her lips.</p>

  <p>"He must have been a pretty bad man, that fellow&mdash;one of our men
  recognized him as the chap who was driving a car this afternoon when
  Taffanny's was robbed. He gave one of the shop assistants a punch in the
  jaw&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But that's impossible!" she said, indignantly. "This man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, you've read about it in the papers&mdash;a bearded man. That's right,
  madam, he's taken his beard off this afternoon. Johnson&mdash;that's the
  officer&mdash;saw him driving with a girl round the park."</p>

  <p>Again speech died on her lips. She remembered the bearded man; there had
  been something familiar in the back view of his head, and he had been driving
  with a notorious woman&mdash;a woman known to the police.</p>

  <p>"They got her tonight," said the communicative detective. "Mr Gorton's
  pretty certain she'll put up a squeak&mdash;I mean to say, she'll tell who
  her companion was. From all accounts he's a man who's been seen about with
  her a great deal in the past year or two."</p>

  <p>She was stunned, bewildered; she could only shake her head in feeble
  protest. "It couldn't have been the same man," she said at last.</p>

  <p>"Do you know him&mdash;the fellow who was here?" The detective looked at
  her keenly.</p>

  <p>"No, no," she said, hastily. "I only thought...it would be such an
  extraordinary coincidence."</p>

  <p>"I've got an idea Mr Gorton knows him." The detective shut the door behind
  her as she walked out of the room. "I heard him telling the sergeant that he
  might be the fellow who was knifed the night a man named Lewing was killed.
  If that's the case, he's only been out of hospital a few days."</p>

  <p>She offered the officer some money: he refused it with great firmness, and
  escorted her to her taxi. She was reminded by the fare, when she reached her
  house, that she had been two hours absent.</p>

  <p>Her maid was waiting up for her, and she sent her down to make some
  coffee.</p>

  <p>Turning on all the lights in the drawing-room, she opened her desk and
  presently found a bundle of Luke's letters; compared their beginnings with
  the two scraps of paper she had brought from the flat. There was no question
  at all: it was Luke's writing. The "My dear" began characteristically in the
  middle of the page in every case.</p>

  <p>It was Luke. And it had been Luke that afternoon in a car with that
  impossible woman! Luke who had assisted at the robbery of Taffanny's!</p>

  <p>She was not shocked; it was too tremendous a discovery to produce
  emotional phenomena of the commonplace kind. She accepted Luke Maddison,
  banker, burglar, hold-up man, companion of questionable ladies, with the
  calmness of a scientist who had happened upon a new and interesting
  discovery.</p>

  <p>Here was an immense happening. To display anger or humiliation would be
  absurd. One has no regard for a sense of decency when fleeing from an
  earthquake and its tumbling walls.</p>

  <p>She went to bed; and such is the serenity of a resolute mind that she
  slept dreamlessly. In the morning, while she was sitting at breakfast, came
  Inspector Gorton, and she listened calmly to his confession of failure.</p>

  <p>"The fellow ran like a hare. He must have been a trained athlete," he
  said. "I'm pretty sure now that he is the fellow who was knifed in a gang
  fight in South London. Lewing was killed."</p>

  <p>"Who was Lewing?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Gorton shrugged his broad shoulders. "Nobody in particular, although he
  gave his name to a gang. The real leader of that crowd is a gentleman named
  Danty Morell&mdash;though he hasn't taken any very active..."</p>

  <p>She had put down her cup. He saw how white her face was. "Danty Morell?
  You don't mean Mr Danton Morell who lives in Half Moon Street?"</p>

  <p>Gorton smiled. "Perhaps I oughtn't to have said that, but I thought Mr
  Bird had told you. You know Mr Bird? I hope you don't know Mr Morell!"</p>

  <p>"I know him very well." she said; her voice was steady and she was
  smiling. "But you may rely on my discretion, Inspector&mdash;I feel almost
  like a Scotland Yard officer myself." She had her hands folded in her lap so
  that he could not see how they were trembling.</p>

  <p>"He may, of course, have turned over a new leaf," said Gorton, uneasily
  conscious that he had said the wrong thing. "Some of these fellows do. I know
  there's been no complaint against him at the Yard for a very long time.
  Morell isn't his name, of course&mdash;I forget what it was, but The
  Sparrow&mdash;I mean Mr Bird&mdash;knows. Wonderful fellow, Danty! He can
  talk the hind leg off a donkey...they say he's the cleverest confidence man
  that ever operated in Europe. Perhaps he's made enough money to retire."</p>

  <p>Danton Morell! How had she come to know him? She tried to trace back the
  friendship. Of course, it was her brother&mdash;her poor brother, who had
  introduced him. Rex knew so many queer people. She trusted him&mdash;she had
  trusted Danty. She had believed him implicitly, believed him when he told her
  that Luke had hounded her brother to his death, believed him when he had
  produced that pitiable note written on two small sheets of
  notepaper&mdash;that at least was genuine, for she knew her brother's
  writing.</p>

  <p>She was viewing a new world, or viewing it from a new angle; and somehow
  she was able to cope with problems which the day before would have terrified
  her. Of that new gift she was unconscious&mdash;she could only feel the
  effect.</p>

  <p>Gorton, who had had very little sleep on the previous night, accepted her
  invitation to join her at breakfast, though he confined himself to a cup of
  coffee and a roll. "You found nothing missing, I suppose? The officer I left
  in charge told me you'd been there looking round. Where is your good husband
  now, Mrs Maddison?"</p>

  <p>She swallowed something. "In Spain, I think. I am going to join him in a
  day or two."</p>

  <p>"None of the wedding presents was at the flat?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "We had no wedding presents," she smiled.</p>

  <p>He finished his coffee, folded his serviette and got up from the table.
  "Now I've got a very unpleasant job which I wish somebody else was going to
  do," he said.</p>

  <p>"You're going to arrest somebody?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "No, that wouldn't be unpleasant&mdash;I enjoy putting
  these fellows behind bars; and the day I catch that enterprising gentleman
  who came to your flat last night will be one of the happiest I have known for
  years! No, this is something gruesome which would shock you, so I shan't tell
  you."</p>

  <p>"I'm beyond being shocked," she smiled.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing really," said Gorton. "Only there was a very high tide last
  night, and the river police found the body of a man who had evidently been
  drowned in the night. I'm going down to see if I know him. From the
  description I had I shouldn't be surprised if it was our burglar."</p>

  <p>She had said she could not be shocked. She was shocked now, and clasped
  her hands together so tightly that they hurt&mdash;it was only the pain that
  prevented her from fainting.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">During the hours which Luke Maddison had spent in his prison
  house, it was curious that he should think so little on serious topics. He
  was face to face with death in its most hideous aspect&mdash;it was
  impossible to mistake Connor's intention&mdash;and yet for the main part his
  mind was occupied by the veriest trivialities. If he thought of Margaret at
  all, it was only in a detached and impersonal way, and to find an explanation
  for her presence with the police at his flat that night. She must have had
  the key; the police went to her&mdash;but why?</p>

  <p>Then he remembered his conversation with Hulbert's servant, who had
  obviously been suspicious, and must have communicated at once with the
  nearest police station.</p>

  <p>He thought of the drive across London in that uncomfortable van, and spent
  quite an hour trying to locate exactly the building in which he was confined.
  Driving along the Embankment on his way to the City, he must have often seen
  the very wharf, the very building. He went to the City twice a week, to
  directors' meetings, and he loved the Embankment in the early days of spring,
  when the green was bursting from the trees, and sunlight dappled the
  pavements with moving arabesques of shadow.</p>

  <p>In such circumstances as his all a man's past life should come before him.
  Luke made an effort to satisfy the convention, but grew bored after five
  minutes.</p>

  <p>He wandered round and round his cell, feeling the walls in a grim spirit
  of humour, seeking for those loose bricks which inevitably occur in the
  prison houses of heroes. Not that he was any hero, he decided. He was a
  smash-and-grab man&mdash;liable to three years penal servitude, certainly to
  disgrace. He decided that it was not in any spirit of altruism that he wished
  to save Margaret's name from being dragged into this sordid affair. It was
  because it would intensify his own sense of foolishness.</p>

  <p>Exactly what would Connor do? He was almost curious to know.</p>

  <p>There was a church clock close by; he heard it striking the quarters and
  the hours, and the last notes of three were still quivering on the air when
  he heard the sound of a key in the lock, the door was opened, and the two men
  who had been his captors invited him forth. Their tone was friendly, almost
  courteous.</p>

  <p>He followed the first, and was followed by the second, into the room.
  Connor had evidently been sleeping on a folding bed. He sat on the edge of
  his untidy couch, rubbing his fingers through his hair and yawning
  prodigiously. On the table were four cups of steaming coffee and some
  sandwiches.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Smith. We've got to think out what we're going to do with you,"
  said Connor, coming to his feet with a yawn. He drew up a chair to the table
  and fell into it; pulled a cup of coffee towards him and took a sandwich.</p>

  <p>"Help yourself to milk and sugar." He pushed a cup towards the prisoner.
  Luke was looking round the room interestedly. Stacked on a chair were four
  great bars of something white and crystalline, which he guessed was salt, and
  on the floor was a long length of heavy chain.</p>

  <p>Connor followed the direction of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Want to buy a bit of salt?" he asked, good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>His question seemed to tickle his two companions, for they chuckled
  deeply.</p>

  <p>"I am not in the salt business," said Luke with a smile. He sipped at the
  coffee; it was raw stuff, but the warmth of it was grateful, for the night
  was cold, and he had grown chilly in the brick-lined room.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do with you, Smith, eh?"</p>

  <p>Luke took a big gulp of coffee and leaned back in his chair with a laugh.
  "You can listen to a very interesting story," he said, "and also you can earn
  yourself a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>He saw a faint ghost of a smile come to Connor's face. "Go on," said that
  tousled man.</p>

  <p>Then Luke told everything, but without referring to Margaret. He gave his
  name, his address, told how he came to meet Lewing, related the story of
  Lewing's little fraud and of his meeting him on that night&mdash;"But what
  were you running away from?" asked Connor.</p>

  <p>This was difficult to explain, for Luke had perforce to leave out the
  motive for his strange action. He could neither tell of his marriage nor of
  Margaret's staggering conduct; and without these facts he felt he was being
  unconvincing. Nevertheless, with this handicap, he struggled on to a finish.
  Connor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've heard all about you, Smith&mdash;there never was a con. man who
  couldn't tell a tale. But if you're a specimen of the Australian man I wonder
  you're not starving! Drink up your coffee and have some more. I want to find
  a way of settling this business without unpleasantness."</p>

  <p>Luke finished the coffee and put down the cup.</p>

  <p>"Now I'll tell one," said Connor, and his voice was no longer pleasant or
  amiable. "You've been to the police and you've tried to double-cross me. And
  now you think you'll get out of it with a silly story!...Squeaker...police
  find you..." Luke heard only scraps of the talk: he was desperately sleepy.
  His head sank forward on his breast, and though he strove with all his will
  power to rouse himself, he could not so much as open his eyes. He did not
  even realize that he had been drinking laudanum.</p>

  <p>"Hold him up," said Connor.</p>

  <p>One of the men caught Luke as he swayed sideways and lowered him to the
  floor. Connor pushed back the table and jerked his thumb in the direction of
  the salt. Two blocks were put on the floor under Luke's legs, and with a
  knife one of the men scooped a deep depression in two of the corners. The
  other blocks were laid on top. Connor lifted the heavy chain, wound it
  carefully round and round the salt, fastening the last two links with a piece
  of wire.</p>

  <p>They discussed their grisly work without emotion.</p>

  <p>"...You want to be careful it doesn't slip over his feet, Harry," said
  Connor. "Tighten that chain a bit&mdash;not too tight, or you'll break the
  salt." At last it was finished, and Connor straightened his back.</p>

  <p>"Get that old plank to lay him on," he commanded, and the bigger of the
  two walked to the door and pulled it open. Connor saw him start back and his
  face wrinkle. "Who's that?" he asked, sharply.</p>

  <p>The man who was in the passage walked into the room at his leisure. Connor
  saw him, and showed his teeth like an angry dog.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Gunner! What the hell are you doing round here?"</p>

  <p>Gunner Haynes looked from Connor to the unconscious man on the floor.
  "Ingenious, but not original," he drawled, his thin lips curling in contempt.
  "You're dropping him in the river, of course, and the water will dissolve the
  salt, the chains will drop off, and the verdict will be 'Death from
  misadventure'. What a pity!"</p>

  <p>"What's the pity, Gunner?" asked Connor.</p>

  <p>"That I happened to butt in," said Haynes. "Who's the victim?"</p>

  <p>"There's no victim," said Connor, loudly. "This poor fellow is ill, and
  we're taking him off to the hospital."</p>

  <p>The Gunner nodded. "I thought you might be pickling him," he said, shook
  his head and repeated: "Ingenious, but not original. No marks of violence on
  the body, nothing to show that he didn't drown, as people do drown, by
  accident. I'm sorry to have spoilt your amusement, but you'll have to let him
  go."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Connor.</p>

  <p>"Because," said the Gunner, deliberately, "I'm in it! You don't catch me
  as accessory before, after, or in the fact of murder. It's not my graft,
  Connor. Remove that interesting apparatus."</p>

  <p>Connor smiled. His hand dropped quite naturally out of sight below the
  level of the table. "If you pull a gun on me," said the Gunner, not a muscle
  of his lean body moving, "I shall shoot you through the stomach. It'll take
  you five days to die, and it's a very painful death by all accounts. I shall
  then go out and explain to the police why I shot you, and there will be no
  flowers from Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>One of Connor's assistants moved a step towards him. "Look here,
  Gunner&mdash;" he began, mildly enough.</p>

  <p>Haynes' fist shot out so swiftly that the man could not counter the blow.
  He went down with a crash. The Gunner stood motionless, watching.</p>

  <p>"Both hands in sight," said Haynes. "Lay 'em on the table, Connor." He had
  no weapon in his hand, but none knew better than the livid man on the other
  side of the table how quickly the Gunner could draw, with what devilish
  accuracy he could shoot.</p>

  <p>"What's the fuss?" he growled. "This bird doesn't mean a thing to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Unlace him," smiled the Gunner. "I'm sorry to butt in, as I said
  before."</p>

  <p>"What did you come here for, anyway?" asked the other, savagely.</p>

  <p>The Gunner looked up at the ceiling. "I forget exactly," he said,
  untruthfully. And then: "Who is this man?"</p>

  <p>"Man named Smith. He squeaked on me tonight, and then tried to carry it
  off with a tale about being a banker&mdash;he's got a nerve! Luke something
  or other." Gunner Haynes bent down and peered into Luke's face. He recognized
  the sleeping man instantly. "Luke something or other, eh? Where did you pick
  him up?" As he spoke he beckoned one of the men. "Take that chain off," he
  said.</p>

  <p>The man glanced uneasily at his chief, but Connor nodded. "The trouble
  with you, Gunner, is that you will interfere with other people's graft. If
  you want to know who he is, he did that job today in Bond Street." He related
  "Smith's" biography; Gunner Haynes knew that he was speaking the truth. He
  was puzzled, but not greatly. He had lived too long on the seamy and shadowy
  side of life to be surprised at anything. Men had lived double lives before;
  but this was the kind of double life which Haynes thought belonged to the
  realm of imaginative novelists. A banker who amused himself in smash-and-grab
  raids was wildly fictional&mdash;but possible.</p>

  <p>There might be, he thought, a woman somewhere in the background. Where
  women touched life, the inexplicable became almost daylight-clear.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with him?" asked Connor, as the man stooped and,
  with scarcely an effort, lifted the unconscious Luke on to the chair.</p>

  <p>The Gunner did not answer the question. Instead, he propounded one of his
  own.</p>

  <p>"Have you any slush in this place?" he asked, and saw a look of alarm come
  into the imperturbable face of the other. "Slush?" said Connor, quickly.
  "No&mdash;why should we? I don't deal in that kind of stuff."</p>

  <p>"No forged French banknotes?" The Gunner shook his head in anticipation of
  the answer.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Gunner?" A smile lit up the saturnine face.</p>

  <p>"You asked me why I came here, and I'm telling you. They're raiding your
  place tonight. I only got to know about it an hour ago. I thought I'd come
  along and tell you. I don't know why, but that's my nature&mdash;helping poor
  crooks!" He saw the three men glance at one another, and the alarm in
  Connor's face was patent.</p>

  <p>"We had a parcel over from Paris the other day," he said, uneasily.
  "Harry, get it up." He looked at the huddled figure of Luke.</p>

  <p>"You're making a big mistake about this bird," he said. "You let him get
  into the hands of the police, and he'll put up a squeak that'll make you
  deaf!"</p>

  <p>Stooping, the Gunner put his arm about Luke Maddison and lifted him
  bodily. He turned and strode through the door, down the narrow passage, and
  into the untidy yard. He had already located Connor's van, and he was on the
  point of hoisting his burden into its interior when he heard a stealthy
  scraping against wood: It was the sound that a man makes when he is
  climbing...somebody was getting over the gate.</p>

  <p>He sat Luke on the ground, propped him against a wall, and went
  noiselessly towards the entrance of the yard. Stooping to get a skyline, he
  saw the head and shoulders of two men above the gate. It was enough; he need
  see no more.</p>

  <p>Returning as quickly as he came to the place where he had left Luke, he
  lifted him and went cautiously and gingerly down the slope towards the water.
  There would be a boat here. Presently his keen eyes discerned the dim shape
  of it, as it moved uneasily on the rising tide.</p>

  <p>He had considered the possibility of leaving Luke to be discovered by the
  police, and had rejected that plan. He owed a debt to this man&mdash;he could
  not leave him to discovery and disgrace. If what Connor had said was true,
  Maddison, in his capacity of brigand, was as much wanted by the police as
  Connor himself.</p>

  <p>He drew the boat to the broken stone causeway with the heel of his boot,
  and put Luke aboard by the simple process of laying him level with the edge
  of the wharf and rolling him on to the boat. It took a few minutes to balance
  him. As he himself stepped astride of the man, he heard the sound of voices
  in the yard, saw the flicker of electric lamps. Untying the painter, he
  pushed off with his hand, dragged an oar from under the reclining figure and
  paddled his way to midstream, keeping a sharp look-out for the river
  police.</p>

  <p>He saw the launch coming downstream at full speed, and drove his boat into
  the shelter of two moored barges as the tiny steamer swung in a
  semi-circle.</p>

  <p>"A bit late," muttered the Gunner.</p>

  <p>He was free from detection now, unless he met another patrol, and, finding
  the second oar, he pushed Luke down between the two seats, and, sitting,
  rowed steadily downstream.</p>

  <p>In an hour there would be daylight; already the eastern sky was whitening.
  The Gunner knew a safe landing near Rotherhithe; the tide was turning, and
  would, he judged, carry him to safety.</p>

  <p>He judged wrong, and saw, before he had reached London Bridge, that he
  could not make his destination in the darkness. He took his decision quickly.
  Stooping over the side of the boat, he filled his hat with water and dashed
  it in the face of the slumbering man. Luke shivered and groaned, and the
  Gunner repeated his experiment. He heard the moaning voice of the man at the
  bottom of the boat.</p>

  <p>"...My head..."</p>

  <p>"Keep quiet!" hissed Haynes. "I'm taking you to London Bridge Stairs."
  There was no answer, and the Gunner prodded with his heel at his uneasily
  moving 'cargo'. "Do you hear me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I hear you. What has happened?" Haynes did not reply, but pulled at
  his oars, and in a minute Luke heard the jolt of the boat striking against
  the stone.</p>

  <p>"Can you get up?" The Gunner's hand gripped Luke's wrist and drew him to a
  sitting position. With the boat-hook he drew the little skiff against the
  steps and came to land.</p>

  <p>It took five minutes before Luke could follow him. His knees gave under
  him, and he wanted all the support that his companion could give him. "Sit on
  the steps," commanded the Gunner, and Luke obeyed. "Now try to stand." For
  five minutes Luke sat crouched up, his face in his hands, and then the
  Gunner's voice aroused him.</p>

  <p>"There are too many people passing over the bridge to please me," he said.
  "We had better get up before it's light." He assisted the half-unconscious
  man to rise to his feet. The Gunner's grip was firm as they climbed the steep
  flight until they emerged flush with the footpath. The people who were
  hurrying across the bridge took little notice of them, and, gripping his
  companion by the arm, the Gunner led him down towards Tooley Street. And then
  he saw a slowly moving cab, and, hailing the driver, bundled Luke inside.</p>

  <p>"My friend's a bit under the weather," he explained to the cabman with a
  smile. "Drive me to Lennox Street, Clerkenwell."</p>

  <p>There was a large block of model buildings in Lennox Street, and for years
  the Gunner had had his secret headquarters in a fairly large flat, as flats
  went, on the ground floor. It was a place to which he very seldom came, and
  of the existence of which the police were ignorant. Relatively, it was his
  pied-a-terre, jealously preserved for emergencies. He had slept there two
  nights before, and the woman who came in daily had made the bed. Upon this he
  laid Luke Maddison.</p>

  <p>"They must have given you a pretty large dose." he said. "I'll make you
  some coffee."</p>

  <p>Luke shuddered. "Coffee&mdash;ugh!"</p>

  <p>"Gave it you in that, did they? That's probably why you're not dead." He
  pulled down the blinds before he lit the gas, and, going out into the little
  kitchen, he made coffee as only a man who had fended for himself on the
  Continent, and who had kept house in places as wide apart as Biarritz is from
  Munich, could brew that delicious beverage. When he came back Luke was
  sitting on the side of the bed, his head in his hands.</p>

  <p>"A couple of aspirins ought to put you right," said the Gunner, and went
  in search of the little white pellets.</p>

  <p>Luke gulped down the medicine, and then for the first time became
  conscious of his benefactor.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you Gunner Haynes?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Haynes smiled. "That is my name."</p>

  <p>"Where is Connor?" Again that cryptic smile.</p>

  <p>"In gaol, I hope." said the Gunner. "Now, Mr Maddison, are you well enough
  to talk?"</p>

  <p>Luke looked up eagerly. "You know me, then?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded. "I knew you the first time I saw you. There's one thing I
  want to ask you&mdash;is it true, the story that Connor told? That you were
  in that smash-and-grab raid at Taffanny's?"</p>

  <p>Luke nodded. "I drove the car. I hadn't the slightest idea what they
  wanted me to do or what it was all about until it was too late."</p>

  <p>"So you're the bearded man?" mused the Gunner. "That certainly is amazing.
  I'm not asking you to explain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll explain as soon as my head stops splitting." groaned Luke.</p>

  <p>It was after two that afternoon when he woke from an uneasy sleep. His
  head was still thick, his mouth tasted like a lime-kiln, but after a cold
  wash at the kitchen sink he was near to his normal self; and over a cigarette
  and a cup of tea he told the story from start to finish, and this time
  reserved nothing.</p>

  <p>The Gunner listened in silence, made no comment until he had finished.</p>

  <p>"Did you tell Connor this story?"</p>

  <p>Luke nodded. "Yes, except that naturally enough I didn't speak about my
  wife and the money. Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>Gunner Haynes pursed his lips. "I don't know. Connor is a pretty bad man.
  Your only hope is that he's sent down for a stretch&mdash;by which inelegant
  word I mean a term of penal servitude. If he gets away with this police raid,
  supposing they find nothing on the premises&mdash;and like a fool I gave him
  plenty of warning&mdash;Connor is the sort of man who would investigate the
  most unlikely story if he thought there was a chance of money in it. And that
  is going to make your reappearance a rather difficult matter."</p>

  <p>He lit another cigarette and stared past his guest. "Tell me why your wife
  hated you&mdash;you rather glossed over that part of your yarn."</p>

  <p>Luke was silent for a long time. "I don't think it's very difficult to
  understand," he said. "She thought I was responsible for the death of her
  brother. He shot himself."</p>

  <p>"But why did she understand that?" persisted the Gunner. "Allowing that
  Danty Morell is a very plausible gentleman, she would hardly take his bare
  word." He thought for a moment, then asked suddenly: "When that boy shot
  himself did he leave any message behind?"</p>

  <p>Luke shook his head. "I heard of none&mdash;nor was anything mentioned at
  the inquest."</p>

  <p>"Who found his body?" Luke considered.</p>

  <p>"Morell was in the room and made the discovery."</p>

  <p>The Gunner nodded. "And immediately after that Mrs Maddison's manner
  changed. Of course, you weren't married then, but that is a fact, isn't it?
  If that is a fact, it means that Danty carried some evidence to the young
  lady that was quite sufficient to make her play this trick&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not blaming her," began Luke. He saw a flicker of amusement in the
  man's eyes. "You are?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly," drawled the Gunner. "I've given up blaming people.
  There's no profit in it." He flicked off the ash of his cigarette carefully
  into his saucer. "You can't make a sudden reappearance; you can't even get to
  Ronda and be sure you'll get away with it," he said. "You've got yourself
  mixed up with two bad gangsters&mdash;Connor and Morell." He rose and paced
  up and down the small room, his eyes narrowed, his brow corrugated in
  thought. "It's Connor that's worrying me. If he's held for trial, that
  problem is settled. By the time he gets out you'll be able to laugh at him.
  If he isn't, and suppose you come back from Ronda, he'll be able to trace all
  your movements. Have you got your passport?" He saw Luke thrust his hand
  inside his shirt, and a look of blank dismay come to his face.</p>

  <p>"I've lost it somewhere."</p>

  <p>Gunner Haynes' lips clicked impatiently. "If you lost it at Keel's Wharf,
  then you're in the soup!" he said. "There's only one thing to do, and that is
  to get your passport back. There's another thing: I want to see the letter
  that that boy wrote before he shot himself."</p>

  <p>Luke shook his head. "I don't believe he wrote a letter, and if he did it
  was certainly destroyed."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later the Gunner left the house on his quest. His first call
  was at a police station near to Keel's Wharf. He knew the inspector in
  charge, and between them was that curious camaraderie which it is so
  difficult for the 'layman' to appreciate&mdash;the understanding between the
  criminal and his ruthless enemy.</p>

  <p>In point of fact, the Gunner met the divisional inspector as he was coming
  out of the station. "I hear you've had trouble at Keel's Wharf," he said.</p>

  <p>The inspector looked at him with a smile in his keen eyes. "Is this
  hearsay or information, Gunner, or direct observation?"</p>

  <p>"Come again," said the Gunner, with elaborate innocence.</p>

  <p>"Connor says you were on the wharf a few minutes before, and that if
  anybody was touting slush it was you. He said you came with a parcel, that he
  refused to entertain the deal, and that you got away by boat." Now the police
  do not always speak the truth. It is a lamentable statement to make. They
  have to deal with liars and cunning men. But the Gunner trusted the man to
  whom he was speaking.</p>

  <p>"I was on the wharf, yes," he said. "As a matter of fact I came to see him
  about another matter altogether&mdash;you know that forgeries are not in my
  line. I heard the raid and got away by boat. I gather that you did not pull
  him?"</p>

  <p>The inspector shook his head. "No; there was nothing there. Connor and his
  friends seem to be doing an extensive trade in salt. Do you know anything
  about that, Gunner?"</p>

  <p>"If I did I shouldn't tell you," said Haynes, coolly. "So you didn't drag
  Connor, eh? That's a pity."</p>

  <p>The detective looked left and right and lowered his voice. "If you
  particularly want him dragged, you'll tell me what I can drag him
  on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Again the Gunner shook his head. "You want me to give you a little
  information? I'm not that kind of bureau! Is Connor still at the wharf?"</p>

  <p>The inspector nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll call on him. I haven't seen you, Pullman."</p>

  <p>He came to the wharf and found Connor in a very cheerful frame of mind. If
  he was at all disconcerted to see Gunner Haynes, he did not reveal the fact.
  "You owe me four pounds," said Connor. "That's the price I paid for that boat
  which you pinched. You're not staying long, are you? Because I'm expecting a
  lady visitor."</p>

  <p>"Who amongst your friends has this courtesy title?" asked the Gunner
  offensively.</p>

  <p>"Nobody you know," said Connor carelessly. "A lady named Mrs
  Maddison&mdash;who has recently lost her husband."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Gunner Haynes Looked At His Companion Oddly.</p>

  <p>"You're expecting Mrs Maddison, are you? Who is she?"</p>

  <p>Connor took up a half-smoked cigar from an ashtray on the table and lit
  it. "A friend of mine," he said. "What have you done with your pal?"</p>

  <p>"Who is Mrs Maddison?" asked the Gunner again.</p>

  <p>Connor tried to appear unconcerned. He had heard that steely tone before,
  and it was rather disconcerting. "She's the wife of a friend of mine," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said the Gunner, "and let's talk."</p>

  <p>Reluctantly Connor pulled up a chair and sat. As he did so, Gunner Haynes
  walked to the door, closed and locked it. "Let's talk," he said again, and
  sat opposite the gangster.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Gunner, I don't want any trouble with you," suggested Connor.
  "If there's anything coming, you can take your corner. I don't know whether
  Maddison was telling the truth, but if he was, then there's big money in
  this. Naturally, I didn't take any notice of the yarn he told when we were
  readying him; but after you got him away, Billy&mdash;that's the man who's
  working with me&mdash;said he'd seen something in the paper about Maddison's
  wedding. I had a chat with one of the busies who came to fan this place, and
  he told me that Maddison's flat was broken into last night by the man who
  drove the car. That tallied with all Maddison told me&mdash;and all I knew.
  This isn't the first time I've seen a swell playing crook, but I've never had
  the luck to catch one before. This man will be money for jam."</p>

  <p>"You're sure it is he, eh?" asked the Gunner, and, deceived by the mild
  enquiry, Connor went on with greater confidence.</p>

  <p>"Sure! I sent a flash fellow up to Maddison's office to see his
  manager&mdash;Steele, I think his name is. There's a portrait of Maddison
  hanging up in the private room, which my fellow saw. He got the name of the
  photographer and tried to buy a copy. He couldn't get that, but he was told
  where the picture had appeared in one of these illustrated weeklies, and he
  got a copy of that."</p>

  <p>Connor pulled open a drawer of the table and took out a periodical which
  had been folded over at a page. He pushed the paper to Gunner Haynes. "That's
  him all right," said Connor, with a confident smile. "I'd have known him with
  or without his moustache. Maddison went away the day after he was married.
  There's a woman in it somewhere&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What a brain you've got!" interrupted the Gunner with mock admiration,
  and Connor scowled. Any reflection on his mentality infuriated him. It was
  his weakness that he believed himself to be the cleverest of his kind.</p>

  <p>"Brain or no brain," he growled, 'there's the picture, and that's the man.
  I could shop him today, and he knows it. Naturally, if I have ten minutes'
  talk to him I shall make him see sense, but if I can't get him I thought I'd
  send a note to his wife. She's got a bit of money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What sort of a note?" asked the Gunner, and the man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Billy writes a better hand than me&mdash;I read in the paper the other
  day that all clever people write bad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And some of the unclever ones, too," said the Gunner.</p>

  <p>He watched the man groping in the drawer, and presently his hand came out
  with two or three sheets of paper covered with pencilled writing. "I wrote it
  down, and Billy copied it and did the spelling," said Connor. "As you're in
  on this, Gunner, you'd better see what I've said."</p>

  <p>He pushed the note across, one hand still in the drawer, a fact which the
  Gunner did not fail to notice; as he stretched out and took the paper, his
  own hand came up and an automatic lay flat on the table, the barrel pointing
  to Connor's diaphragm.</p>

  <p>"Take your hand out of the drawer. If there's any murder to be committed,
  I'd prefer to commit it myself," he said.</p>

  <p>Connor's hand came up with great alacrity. "I'm surprised at you,
  Gunner&mdash;you wouldn't trust your best friend."</p>

  <p>"You're no friend of mine," said the Gunner.</p>

  <p>He found some difficulty in reading the scrawled words "Dear Mrs Maddison
  (the note ran), I should like to give you some information about your
  husband. I am afraid he has got into serious trouble, but I can get him out
  of it. He has fallen into bad hands through no fault of his own&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Gunner read the last sentence aloud and looked up, "That's a bit of a
  snoodge," said Connor coolly. "Naturally I want to wrap it up for him so that
  it looks as though I'm trying to help him."</p>

  <p>"Strategist!" murmured the Gunner, and went on with his reading, "It will
  be very serious if the police know what I know re robbery at Taffanny's, but
  I think I can get him out of it, though it may cost a bit of money, which I'm
  sure you will not mind paying." Haynes smiled sardonically as he came to this
  line. "Don't take this note to the police, but bring it with you. If you go
  to the police, your husband will be in trouble. Come and see me after
  dark..." Here followed elaborate directions as to how the wharf was to be
  reached.</p>

  <p>"That's the letter, is it?" The Gunner pushed the paper across the table,
  "I thought you were a specialist, Connor? I've never known you put the black
  before."</p>

  <p>"This isn't blackmail," said Connor indignantly, "this is compensation for
  money wasted. Besides, he pretended he was an Australian fellow called
  Smith&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He pretended nothing of the kind. You jumped at the conclusion that he
  was Smith because he was in Lewing's company the night your crowd knifed
  him," said the Gunner quietly, "It'll interest you to know that Smith never
  arrived in England&mdash;he was turned back at Plymouth; he is now on his way
  to Australia." He took a cigar from his pocket, bit off the end and lit the
  long brown smoke. "Suppose Mrs Maddison goes to the police&mdash;they'll
  catch you for ten years, Connor."</p>

  <p>Connor smiled uneasily. "Is that likely&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door.</p>

  <p>"Open it," ordered Haynes.</p>

  <p>Connor unlocked the door. One of his men was standing outside, and by his
  agitation he knew something was wrong. "The Sparrow's here, with a lady," he
  whispered hoarsely, and, watching him, the Gunner saw Connor's face go
  grey.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear that?" asked Connor breathlessly. "The Sparrow...she's
  brought him." He snatched the letter up from the table, made a ball of it,
  and threw it into the little fire. At that moment they heard the heavy
  footsteps of Inspector Bird in the passage.</p>

  <p>The big man came in, a benevolent smile upon his large face, and behind
  him a pretty girl, whom the Gunner had met before.</p>

  <p>"Why, Gunner, this is an unexpected pleasure!" rumbled The Sparrow.
  "Thirty-eight more of you, and you'd have a regular Ali Baba's cave!" Haynes
  saw that the girl recognized him. He was already on his feet, and gave her a
  friendly little nod.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Miss Bolford?" he said, and the sharp-eared Connor heard, as
  he intended he should hear. The last thing in the world he wanted was for the
  blackmailer to reveal the fact that he was expecting Margaret Maddison. He
  saw the look of bewilderment and relief that came into Connor's face, and
  knew that he had taken the hint.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you were running with this crowd, Gunner," said The
  Sparrow. "Old friend of yours, Miss Bolford." His finger shot out. "That's
  Connor. You ought to know Connor, Miss Bolford." And then, to the discomfited
  man: "This lady is on a newspaper, and she wants to get acquainted with all
  the bad and nearly-bad men in London. Raided last night, weren't you?"</p>

  <p>"They're always raiding me," grinned Connor, "and never finding anything,
  Mr Bird."</p>

  <p>The Sparrow's eyes roved from one to the other. "How long have the crow
  and the hawk been living in the same nest? That's puzzling me," he asked.
  "Coming down in the world, aren't you, Gunner? What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Slumming," said Gunner Haynes coolly. "I like now and again to establish
  contact with the underworld."</p>

  <p>The detective's face was wreathed in a sudden smile. "Hear him?" he asked
  admiringly. "Quite a classy line of conversation. There's nobody like him."
  This was the Gunner's opportunity. He knew that Bird would keep occupied the
  discomfited owner of the wharf. He put on his hat carefully and moved toward
  the door.</p>

  <p>"I'll be getting along, Mr Bird. I presume you don't wish to see me?" And
  then he saw a malignant gleam in Connor's eye.</p>

  <p>"So long, Gunner!" said the man loudly. "If you take my advice, give up
  carrying a gat: it will do you no good, and get you a lagging if you're ever
  caught."</p>

  <p>"Carrying a gat, is he?" The Sparrow became instantly alert. "That's a
  silly thing to do, Gunner. Got a licence?"</p>

  <p>Haynes smiled. "I don't carry a licence and you can search my clothing for
  a gat. You've no right to, but you can." He spread out his arms and Bird's
  hands passed over him quickly. Mary Bolford watched the deadly by-play and
  was fascinated.</p>

  <p>"No gat there," said The Sparrow. Then, to Connor: "What's the idea?"</p>

  <p>"I can tell you what the idea is." The Gunner was at the door. "Our friend
  was anxious to do a trade in lethal fire-arms, and I wasn't buying any. The
  only gun you're likely to see today, Mr Bird, is in that table drawer." The
  detective pulled open the drawer near where the man had sat, and Mary Bolford
  saw Connor's face go green, for there at the bottom of the drawer was a
  silver-plated revolver. "I'll leave you to it," said the Gunner easily, and
  strolled out.</p>

  <p>Before he passed through the little wicket gate leading to the street he
  took off his hat as carefully as he had put it on, and removed from its
  interior the automatic he had cached, and slipped it into his pocket.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Margaret Maddison had spent a torturing two hours before the
  shabby messenger had brought her the note which told her at least that Luke
  was alive. At the bottom of the letter there was scrawled in a different
  hand&mdash;Connor's own&mdash;"Come round about eight."&mdash;this postscript
  he had not communicated to the Gunner.</p>

  <p>The letter confirmed all she had feared. She sat motionless at her desk
  for half an hour with the copperplate communication before her, trying to
  formulate a working theory. Luke was in trouble&mdash;bad trouble. She
  accepted this fact as a starting point. In her mind she did not reproach him
  for the monstrous eccentricity which had brought him to his present
  position&mdash;rather she hated herself that in a moment of crisis she had
  deserted him and urged him into deeper folly.</p>

  <p>A servant came into the room and spoke to her, but she was so absorbed
  that she did not notice his presence, and he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Mr Morell?" She came to reality with a start. She had not seen Danty for
  days, and her first inclination was to send a message that she was not well
  enough to be seen. And then a thought occurred to her, and she nodded.</p>

  <p>"Ask him to come up, please."</p>

  <p>Danty came in, a sprucely dressed man about town, and bore in his smiling
  face no evidence of his embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Any news of Luke!" he asked, almost jovially. "I was on my way to the
  City and I thought I'd call in." She was regarding him curiously. Danton the
  friend, and Danton the gang leader, were indistinguishable. It came almost as
  a shock to her to realize that her confidence in him had already evaporated
  before Gorton had told her the truth about this adventurer. In that moment
  she realized how complete had been his duplicity, yet in her desk was that
  fatal message from Rex. That at least must have been true. It was Danty who
  had arranged to send her the message from Paris which bore Luke's
  signature.</p>

  <p>Yet she felt no indignation, no resentment&mdash;Danton was an ugly fact,
  no less or more a fact because of its ugliness.</p>

  <p>"I heard from a friend of mine that Luke's flat was burgled last night.
  Did they get anything?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of any great consequence," she said.</p>

  <p>He saw her fold in some haste a letter that was in front of her, and put
  it in a little hand-bag that lay on the table, and he wondered what there was
  in that epistle which brought the colour into her cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I expect Luke's having the time of his life. Have you heard from
  him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No, I haven't heard from him." And then, a little
  awkwardly: "Did you see that curious case in the paper this morning?" He
  thought she was trying to turn the conversation into other channels. It
  seemed a little gauche, but he did not suspect her object in asking the
  question&mdash;her embarrassment saved her from suspicion.</p>

  <p>"There are hundreds of cases in the paper: which is the one?"</p>

  <p>"About the man who was living a double life: a respectable merchant by day
  and a&mdash;a burglar by night."</p>

  <p>Danty smiled. He lived too near the criminal world to harbour any
  illusions about its romantic character. "That's the sort of stuff you read in
  stories," he said, "but I have known such cases. I've read about them, of
  course," he added hastily. "There was a man in Liverpool who preached in a
  local chapel on Sundays and ran a forgery plant the rest of the week. I know
  another man&mdash;by hearsay, of course&mdash;who was the head of a
  prosperous shoe company in the Midlands, and one of the cleverest jewel
  thieves the police have ever had through their hands."</p>

  <p>She was looking out of the window, apparently uninterested. "Why do men do
  that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>Danty shrugged. "I don't know. It's a sort of field of
  adventure&mdash;there are precious few fields left. I wanted to talk to you
  about my South American Company, Margaret. I'm in rather serious trouble. I
  want seventy thousand pounds to finish the deal, to be exact seventy-six
  thousand pounds, and I've raised sixty-nine. I was thinking this morning that
  if Luke was here I could get all I wanted. He didn't like me, but he was a
  very good business man."</p>

  <p>She was neither amused nor indignant at the cool request. For a moment she
  had a wild idea of supplying him with the money he required. He might prove a
  useful ally, if all Gorton had said was true. Then the danger of making a
  confidant of this unscrupulous creature became apparent. Danty was a parasite
  living on society: he would not fail to exact the fullest advantage from his
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>She was confronted with the alternatives of seeking the aid of the society
  in which Luke had found a discreditable place, or of going to the police,
  who, she knew, were not respecters of persons, and would as lief send Luke to
  penal servitude as they would the gaol birds with whom he was in
  association.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that is impossible, Danton," she said quietly. "Why don't you
  see Mr Steele? He is a business man."</p>

  <p>Danton shrugged his shoulders. "Steele! A servant&mdash;the man is without
  any initiative, and a word from you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "That I can't give," she said.</p>

  <p>There was a silence after this; then Danton Morell began to speak easily
  about trivialities, and in a short time took his leave. At least, he thought,
  as he went down the stairs, he had satisfied himself that she was not
  definitely antagonistic to him.</p>

  <p>That he was on his way to the City was true. There was a little City
  office where he occasionally met his humble associates. Since Lewing's death,
  the gang which bore his name had lain very quiet. It comprised a not
  inconsiderable number of men, old and young, who lived on the river and its
  cargoes. Though Danty took no part in their operations, he had organized
  their work and reduced their methods to a system. His "corner" was a small
  one, for receivers paid badly. The work was dangerous and difficult, and
  sometimes weeks would pass before the gang could make a good clean-up. Bales
  of silk, chests of tea, pockets of rubber&mdash;nothing came amiss to the
  thieves; but the commodities they stole were hard to dispose of, and Danty's
  share hardly paid the rent of his fiat.</p>

  <p>A proposal put up to him that morning that he should take a more active
  part in the work was negatived by him.</p>

  <p>"It is not my graft," he said. "I'm not a Connor. You don't imagine that
  I'll come and live in Bermondsey, do you?"</p>

  <p>The active leader of the gang, a short, thick-set man who bore the name of
  Dick and apparently nothing else, did not receive the refusal without
  protest. "The boys say that Connor's crowd are making big money, and that
  they ought to be making the same, Even if you didn't stay in Bermondsey, and
  only came down occasionally, you might help."</p>

  <p>"You're having all the help you'll get from me," said Danty impatiently.
  "What's the sense of comparing Connor's crowd with ours? Connor does land
  work, and that's different. If your people hadn't had my advice they'd spend
  their time in stir. Who was it made you buy an electric boat&mdash;it was I!
  Who arranged to supply you with lists of cargoes and the lightering
  contracts? You're doing a small business because it's the only kind of
  business you know. Do you think Connor would take anyone of your crowd and
  use him?"</p>

  <p>"We could go into Connor's trade and make good pickings," insisted Dick
  doggedly. "Lewing would have been more use to us than you are."</p>

  <p>Danty was not easily cowed. He showed his teeth in a mirthless smile. "And
  Lewing's dead! Do you know why! It wasn't because he put up a squeak, but
  because he poached on Connor's territory." He sent the man away dissatisfied,
  folded the notes which Dick had brought as his share of a recent haul, and
  went to a respectable City club to lunch.</p>

  <p>Every thief has his failings, and Danty was a gambler. He loved that part
  of the City which immediately surrounds the Stock Exchange; he would spend
  hours poring over the rise and fall of prices; he speculated heavily in every
  kind of share, and had seen the considerable fortune he had achieved by the
  crooked practice of his profession melt like snow in the sun. Rex Leferre had
  been a useful lieutenant. He had been the money-getter at a period when money
  was tight. He had served other purposes&mdash;paid with real money for blocks
  of unsaleable shares with which Danty was saddled. The time had come when
  Danton Morell must find a new source of revenue, or vanish for ever from his
  usual haunts.</p>

  <p>It was his boast that he was the best confidence man in England; yet he
  was made to look a child in that place that has been the ruin of so many
  confidence men&mdash;the London Stock Exchange.</p>

  <p>He stopped long enough in the City to discover many unpleasant truths.
  Shares which he held in considerable quantities were sliding steadily down
  the list. He met his broker, a cold-blooded man, who laid before him a
  statement of account which made Danton Morell go cold.</p>

  <p>Danty left the City in a state of desperation, and arrived at his flat at
  the same time as the lawyer's clerk who served him with a writ for £140 from
  his tailor&mdash;the tenth writ Danty had received in the past month. Pi
  Coles, his "valet", took his coat and hat.</p>

  <p>"Any luck?" asked the little man, with the ease and familiarity of one who
  was addressing a friend.</p>

  <p>"No luck, Pi," said Danty, with a twisted smile. "But every cloud has its
  silver lining." He did not realize that the silver lining in this case
  radiated from one called Connor. To do him justice, Mr Connor was unaware of
  the fact that he was destined to assist the head of a rival gang.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Gunner Haynes and his guest sat in conference. Luke was
  still feeling the effect of the drug: his head throbbed at the slightest
  noise, and during the day he had consumed uncountable quantities of tea.</p>

  <p>"There's the situation," said Haynes. "Connor knows who you are.
  Naturally, I am not blaming you for telling him, though you could not have
  expected him to believe you were a man of substance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not so very substantial," smiled Luke. "You wired to my wife, you
  say?"</p>

  <p>The Gunner nodded. "I sent a telegram in Connor's name, putting off the
  appointment," he said. "I should imagine it was not till night, because
  Connor would not risk detectives seeing Mrs Maddison go into his wharf. If
  she doesn't tum up, Connor will naturally make a call on her tomorrow; but a
  lot of things might happen before then."</p>

  <p>"Suppose I saw Bird&mdash;" began Luke.</p>

  <p>The Gunner shook his head. "I've no great love for the police, although
  I've a mighty respect for The Sparrow," he said. "But I can tell you this,
  that if you were the Duke of Oojah they would have to pinch you for that raid
  on Taffanny's. You see, your fatal mistake was to give the shop assistant a
  punch on the jaw. That made you a willing agent in the matter. If you'd
  stepped out of the car and given the lady into custody, and then explained
  your position, there would have been no harm except a few flaring headlines
  in the evening newspapers. But you didn't. You became an accessory the moment
  you gave the shop assistant a punch and assisted your lady friend to escape.
  Anyway, whatever happens, you couldn't escape a lot of unpleasant
  publicity&mdash;or your wife either. That seems to me the one thing you do
  not wish. No, I've got to find another way of getting you back into society."
  His lips curled at the word; he was evidently secretly amused.</p>

  <p>"But if Connor sees my wife tomorrow, what then?" asked Luke.</p>

  <p>The Gunner considered this question for a little time. "He mustn't see
  her. I think that can be managed. It is a pity The Sparrow arrived when he
  did&mdash;otherwise I should have had the solution in both hands. As it is, I
  don't think we shall have a great deal of difficulty." He knelt down at the
  side of Luke's bed, groped beneath and pulled out the case of a portable
  typewriter, This he unfastened, and, putting the little machine on the table,
  he took a sheet of paper and began to type laboriously...</p>

  <p>Connor, striding impatiently up and down his room, looking from time to
  time at his watch, heard a knock at the gate and ran eagerly to open the
  wicket. It was a small boy with a letter. Connor snatched it from the boy,
  slammed the wicket in his face, and went back to his room.</p>

  <p>The letter was typewritten, and began without preamble.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't come to see you tonight. The neighbourhood is so
  dreadfully squalid that I fear my presence would be noticed by the police.
  Can you meet me by the edge of the Serpentine at ten o'clock tonight (about a
  hundred paces from the bridge: there will be nobody there at that time). But
  you must supply me proof that my husband is the man about whom you are
  speaking." It bore no signature, but there was a postscript.</p>

  <p>"P.S. I do hope you have not told a man named Haynes this story about Mr
  Maddison. He called today, but I would not see him."</p>

  <p>Connor smiled. The Gunner was certainly a quick worker.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Margaret was dressing in preparation for her interview when
  the telegram came.</p>

  <p>It was brief.</p>

  <p>"Cannot see you tonight. Same time tomorrow night. Connor." In a sense she
  was relieved, though she would have been glad to have ended the state of
  suspense in which she was living. She had a wild idea of taking with her a
  large sum of money, and with that intention had drawn a thousand pounds from
  the bank. She had revised this plan, however, and the money was now in her
  safe. If it was blackmail, and these people wanted paying, they could wait
  for a few hours. She did not know the neighbourhood into which she was going,
  but she guessed from its locality that it was not the place where an
  unprotected woman could carry a large sum of money with impunity.</p>

  <p>As she put the money away she caught a glimpse of an envelope which gave
  her a little heartache. It contained poor Rex's last scrawled message.
  Several times she had been on the point of putting that envelope into the
  fire, but something had prevented her. There was a time when she needed the
  simulation to her hatred which that pitiable note supplied. But that time had
  passed. The boy's dead hand still lay on her, had wrecked Luke's life, and
  might yet bring her to disaster. Now she must wait another twenty-four hours
  before she resolved her doubts.</p>

  <p>She heard the door-bell ring, and presently came a tap on the door and her
  footman came in.</p>

  <p>"A man wishes to see you, madam. I think he's been here before&mdash;a Mr
  Haynes." At first she did not grasp who was meant, and then in a flash she
  recalled the earlier visit. Here, at any rate, was a man who was friendly
  disposed towards Luke.</p>

  <p>"Bring him up, please," she said.</p>

  <p>Now she recalled more vividly the previous interview she had had with him.
  He had told her that Danty Morell was a man whom no decent woman should know,
  and she had rung for the servant and had him shown out. But he was friendly
  to Luke, had spoken of some service which he had rendered to him, and here
  she would find an ally.</p>

  <p>Haynes was not prepared for the kindness of the welcome. In a sense it was
  a little embarrassing. He had come not to give but to seek information. It
  was vitally necessary that he should not betray the fact that he had any
  communication with Luke.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I was very rude to you the last time you came, Mr Haynes," she
  said, as she sat down behind her little desk and signalled to him to sit.
  "You rather hurt my feelings about a&mdash;" she hesitated "&mdash;a friend
  of mine, who isn't so much of a friend as he was," she smiled.</p>

  <p>"That's the best news I've heard for a long time," he said. "I was a
  little impertinent. I remember I asked you why your husband had left you. I
  wonder you didn't send for the police."</p>

  <p>She laughed at this. "Do you know where my husband is now?" she asked, and
  when he shook his head her heart sank. She had had a vague idea that this man
  might have come into touch with his benefactor.</p>

  <p>"I can tell you where Mr Morell is now," he said, with a twinkle in his
  eyes, "but that's not going to help you very much. I've come to repeat my
  impertinence, Mrs Maddison. At the back of my mind I've got a notion I can
  help you and help your husband, who, I have reason to believe is in Spain."
  He said this deliberately, his eyes challenging hers.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"I believe he's in Spain. If a man's in Spain he can't be in London, can
  he? And if he's a gentleman at large in Spain, taking long hikes through the
  country he can't be burgling Taffanny's or getting himself mixed up with
  Connor."</p>

  <p>"You know, then?" she interrupted quickly. "I was seeing that man tonight,
  but he sent me a wire&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I sent you the wire," said Gunner Haynes coolly. "That engagement of
  yours has got to be put off indefinitely."</p>

  <p>"How did you know?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>The Gunner smiled cryptically. "I've got a whole lot of sources of
  information that I'm not making public," he said. "The point I want to make
  with you is this&mdash;your husband is in Spain. You've had letters from him,
  which unfortunately you've destroyed." She understood now. Did he come from
  Luke? There could be no other explanation for his knowledge, and she put the
  question bluntly.</p>

  <p>"I haven't been to Ronda for years," said the Gunner calmly. "And if I
  had, and met your husband, he wouldn't know that I was coming to see you.
  Now, Mrs Maddison, I'm going to ask you that impertinent question all over
  again: exactly why did your husband leave you?&mdash;No, no, I don't mean
  that. I know why he left you. But why did you suddenly leave him flat? I
  don't know that; I'll bet your husband doesn't know that. Only you
  know&mdash;and Danty. I guess Danty knows."</p>

  <p>She was silent; but she realized at that moment just why she had not
  destroyed Rex's last note. She had kept it to show Luke some day, and demand
  from him the explanation she should have asked for when it came to her. It
  was her justification&mdash;the only one she could have for her conduct.</p>

  <p>"That is an extraordinary request for a stranger to make, Mr Haynes, and I
  don't know whether to enlighten you or not." She stood for a moment silent,
  and then, turning abruptly, walked out of the room. Haynes picked up his hat
  from the floor and rose, thinking the interview was at an end. But in three
  minutes she was back again with a little envelope in her hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm telling you something that nobody knows but me and Mr Morell," she
  said. "When my poor brother shot himself, this note was found in his
  room."</p>

  <p>She took from the envelope two telephone slips and passed them to him.
  Gunner Haynes read: "Margaret, darling, I have lost. For months I have been
  gambling. Today I took a desperate step on the advice of Luke Maddison. He
  has led me to ruin. Money is his god. I beg of you not to trust him. He has
  led me from one act of folly to another. God bless you! REX." He read it
  twice, and then looked up. "Is this your brother's handwriting?" She nodded.
  "Could you swear to it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm sure it's his. I've had hundreds of pencilled notes from him,
  and I couldn't possibly be mistaken."</p>

  <p>"Who found it?"</p>

  <p>"Mr Morell found it in Rex's room. Poor dear Rex had a servant, a very
  trustworthy man, and he saw the note before Mr Morell put it in his
  pocket&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He didn't read it, of course?" suggested the Gunner. "The servant, I
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. He only saw the note, and Mr Morell hide it."</p>

  <p>The Gunner had an amazing memory. He could from that moment have repeated
  every word in the letter&mdash;there was no need for him to take a copy, and
  he handed it back to the girl. "Naturally, you thought that your husband was
  responsible for the death of your brother, and that was why you&mdash;acted
  as you did."</p>

  <p>"He told you?" she challenged.</p>

  <p>The Gunner neither denied nor agreed. He stood frowning down at the
  carpet, his hands pushed into his pockets, his underlip out-thrust. "Queer
  bird, Danty," he said after a while, and she realized that he was speaking as
  much to himself as to her. "He used to be a great hoarder of trifles&mdash;I
  wonder if he's got over it. There's something of a miser about Danty, though
  he could never keep money and never will. All crooks die poor."</p>

  <p>"Will&mdash;" she began, and stopped in natural confusion.</p>

  <p>She saw a smile dawn slowly in his face.</p>

  <p>"You were going to ask me, shall I? No, Mrs Maddison, I shall not die
  poor, unless I go mad. I'll never have to work again&mdash;I'm a reformed
  character. That doesn't mean," he said quickly, "that I've got any notions
  that I have been following the wrong track. I've known that all my life. Five
  years ago a brother swindler traded me a block of shares in a copper mine.
  They looked to be worth about the value of the paper they were printed on,
  but luckily I didn't throw them into the fire. Copper was found on the
  property whilst I was on remand the other day, and I've sold at a big profit.
  I shall only commit one more crime." She would have smiled at this, but she
  saw something in his eyes which froze the smile on her lips. "Danty Morell
  has got to be punished one of these days&mdash;when I find proof," he said
  slowly.</p>

  <p>He took his watch from his pocket. "I've got rather an important
  engagement, so, if you don't mind, Mrs Maddison, I'll go. Don't ask me to
  give any messages to your husband, because I don't know where he is. If I
  did, I shouldn't tell you."</p>

  <p>"Is he well?" she asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Pretty well," said the Gunner. He made no attempt to move, but stood
  twiddling his watch-guard.</p>

  <p>"He'll want money," he said suddenly, "and this sounds like the beginning
  of the confidence trick. I can let him have all he wants if there's any need,
  but I think you'd better provide it, just to show your confidence in me." He
  chuckled at this. "Sounds almost like Danty at his worst! If you have any
  hesitation, Mrs Maddison, don't give it to me. I shall want about two hundred
  pounds, but three hundred would be better."</p>

  <p>She went out of the room and returned with a small pad of notes. "Four
  hundred will be better still," she said, and he thrust the money into his
  pocket without counting it.</p>

  <p>"Seems a pretty easy game. Pity I didn't start earlier," he said. "Danty's
  the lad! There isn't a finer tale-teller in the world." He jerked out his
  hand, and she took it.</p>

  <p>"I'll be seeing you again, Mrs Maddison&mdash;perhaps some day when you're
  going to Ronda you'll let me travel on the same train, in case some of the
  real con men get hold of you!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">At the appointed hour Mr Connor arrived, paid off his taxi
  short of the bridge across the Serpentine, and strolled down towards the
  water. The night was inclined to be rainy; a high, chill wind was
  blowing&mdash;it was not a night even for the most romantic of couples to
  spend on the brim of the Serpentine.</p>

  <p>Mr Connor was not romantic: he was very much a realist. He could well
  understand Margaret Maddison's reluctance to come to his wharf, and he blamed
  himself for the stupidity of such a suggestion. She might have come
  accompanied by the police, as the Gunner suggested she would; and that was
  exactly the way she would have arrived had she intended making a fuss.</p>

  <p>He found a wooden chair leaning over upon another, and, straightening it,
  sat down. Here was the promise of an income for life. He could even bless the
  Gunner that he had interfered in his affairs at the most critical moment in
  the life of Luke Maddison. He looked right and left: there was nobody in
  sight. The police, he knew, did not patrol this path except at rare
  intervals.</p>

  <p>Behind him was a stretch of grass which was separated from the pathway by
  a railing less than a foot from the ground. He was meditating upon all the
  prospects which his discovery had opened up, when a hand dropped on his
  shoulder and something cold touched the back of his neck.</p>

  <p>"Shouting means shooting," said a muffled voice behind him. "Don't look
  round, kid!"</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" growled Connor, who, to do him justice, was not so much
  frightened as annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Stick 'em up, and let's have a look at you," said the stranger,
  laconically. "Now turn," he said, and Connor obeyed.</p>

  <p>His eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness, and, had his assailant's
  face been uncovered, he could have been distinguished; but where the face
  should be was a black patch.</p>

  <p>"Outrage by masked highwayman," murmured the new-comer, as his disengaged
  hand passed quickly across the outside of Connor's pockets.</p>

  <p>"You needn't have covered up your face," Gunner; growled Connor. "I'd know
  you anywhere."</p>

  <p>The other said nothing; his hand went into the inside pocket of Connor's
  coat and he jerked something free. Connor gripped at his wrist, but the
  barrel of the automatic hit him gently under the chin&mdash;not so gently
  that his teeth did not rattle.</p>

  <p>"You came after the passport, did you? I was a can to fall for your
  letter. But it's going to make no difference, Gunner, and you can tell the
  woman who sent you here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You talk too much," said the mask.</p>

  <p>He put his hand in Connor's hip pocket, took out the pistol it contained,
  and flung it into the dark pond. Connor heard the splash of the revolver as
  it hit the surface of the water.</p>

  <p>"Probably saved you ten years," said the hold-up man, cheerfully. "If
  there's one thing I like, it is saving people from penal servitude." He
  pushed his hand down into the trousers pocket of his victim and pulled out a
  handful of notes.</p>

  <p>"Richness beyond the dreams of avarice," he said, as he transferred the
  money to his own pocket. "Saving up to buy a car or something?"</p>

  <p>"You'll know all about this!" threatened Connor. "You don't think I'm
  going to take it lying down, do you?" He heard a faint laugh, but so far
  removed from amusement did it sound that he shuddered.</p>

  <p>"What's to stop me finishing you?" asked the man in the mask. "The answer
  is nothing! I'm telling you, Connor, for your own good, not to raise a squeak
  about this little affair."</p>

  <p>"Maddison put you up to this, I suppose&mdash;but I'll get him!" said
  Connor, between his teeth. "I'm not kidding you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You talk too much," said the other again, and, gripping his victim by the
  shoulder, he spun him round, so rapidly that Connor staggered.</p>

  <p>Before he could recover his balance the stranger gave him a violent push
  that sent him sprawling into the water. By the time Connor had recovered, his
  man had disappeared.</p>

  <p>It was not the kind of night to wander about in wet clothes, but they were
  nearly dry by the time Connor had made his plans. Too well he knew now why
  the Gunner had called that day&mdash;he had come for the passport, but the
  arrival of Inspector Bird and the girl reporter had made it impossible to
  secure the document he wanted.</p>

  <p>Connor had half a dozen plans but rejected them all. And then he
  remembered the one man in London who could be of assistance to him. The fact
  that he was head of a rival gang made little or no difference to this
  opportunity. The idea had no sooner settled in his mind than he took up the
  'phone and called Danty Morell's flat.</p>

  <p>Here was one of the widest men in the world, with a brain even more
  cunning than his own&mdash;a man who had mixed with real swells, and had
  reputedly made enough money to retire from the crooked game, though he still
  maintained nominal direction of the Borough crowd.</p>

  <p>Danty was in bed when the call came through, and, cursing all telephones,
  went into the passage in his bare feet to take the message. He was not
  sufficiently well acquainted with the gangster to recognize his voice, and
  Connor lost no time in introducing himself.</p>

  <p>"What's the game?" asked Danty suspiciously.</p>

  <p>He knew there was bad blood between the two gangs, but so far had kept
  clear of offending either by the lukewarmness of his championship or the
  vehemence of his enmity.</p>

  <p>"It's a big thing, with big money in it. Can you see me right away?" asked
  Connor.</p>

  <p>For fully a minute Danty considered the possibilities. "All right, come
  up," he said, "but if you start a rough house here, you'll be pinched."</p>

  <p>"Don't make me laugh," smiled Connor. "Why should I call you up to start a
  rough house&mdash;what's the matter with the streets? You go on 'em, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"All right, come along," said Danty at last.</p>

  <p>He was not particularly enthusiastic for a meeting, especially as he was
  aware that his house from time to time was under observation. He woke Pi
  Coles, and revealed the identity of the caller. The dumpy little man shook
  his head.</p>

  <p>"Connor's mustard," he said. "I shouldn't have much to do with him if I
  were you, guv'nor." From time to time there had been red war between the two
  gangs, but Danty was so aloof from their operations that he could afford to
  take a disinterested view.</p>

  <p>He never went south of the river until the feuds had died down, and it was
  perfectly understood that he was not to be the object of reprisals.</p>

  <p>Danty had dreamed dreams of shaking loose all his old associations and
  forgetting that he had ever organized river thefts and drawn a small but
  steady income from the proceeds.</p>

  <p>He was dressed by the time Connor called. Pi, his servant, who had spent a
  quarter of an hour looking out of the window, reported the man's arrival in
  Half Moon Street.</p>

  <p>"He's alone, guv'nor," he said, and most of Danty's uneasiness was removed
  by this information.</p>

  <p>Connor was in a friendly mood&mdash;which meant nothing. Friendliness of
  mood was part of his stock-in-trade. "I've got a nerve to call you up, Mr
  Morell," he said, "but something has happened and I think you're going to
  help me. When I say 'help me'," he added carefully, "I mean help yourself. My
  crowd and yours are not always matey, but I hope that's going to make no
  difference."</p>

  <p>Danty informed him with the greatest politeness that he was superior to
  the antagonisms of crowds. With his own hand he pushed forward a box of
  cigars, and Mr Connor lit one carefully and thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I happen to know a lot about you, Morell,&mdash;everybody agrees you're
  the widest fellow in London. You know Mr Maddison too, don't you&mdash;he
  mentioned your name?"</p>

  <p>Danty's eyes opened. "Maddison?" he said slowly. "Why, do you know
  him?"</p>

  <p>Connor grinned. "I'm not going to tell you any lies. I didn't know him
  till last night." Then, abruptly: "How much money has he got?"</p>

  <p>The question took Morell's breath away. "What am I, an enquiry agent?" he
  asked sarcastically. "He's a rich man, that's all I can tell you, and you
  probably know that yourself." He might have added that Luke's wealth was a
  genuine source of grievance at that moment.</p>

  <p>He was curious to know why the gangster was interested in Luke, and how he
  had come to meet him, but for the moment Connor was not prepared to enlighten
  him. "The point is this, Morell: if this fellow's rich, and we can get big
  stuff out of him, are you ready to split two ways?"</p>

  <p>Danty did not answer. He certainly had no intention of committing himself
  to this man, who might be really friendly but as likely as not was preparing
  a trap for him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to tell you," said Connor, "because you've got to come
  in, whether you like it or not. If you're in, there's only one way the
  makings can be split, and that's two ways." He chuckled at his own joke.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you'll be kind enough to tell me just what the graft is?" said
  Morell.</p>

  <p>The other nodded. "That's fair." he said. "Do you remember Lewing being
  killed, and a fellow being knifed?"</p>

  <p>"I remember." said Morell.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Taffanny's was robbed two days ago, a man with a beard got
  away with a lot of stuff?" Danty nodded again. "Do you know that was the same
  man&mdash;the chap who was in hospital and the fellow who drove the car? And
  do you know that man was Mr Luke Maddison?"</p>

  <p>Danty stared at him, his mouth wide open. "Forget it!" he said scornfully.
  "Maddison's in Spain."</p>

  <p>The other chuckled. "In Spain, is he? I'll tell you where he is. He's
  hiding up with Gunner Haynes. And what's more, his wife knows he's on the run
  with the police after him." Luke Maddison a thief, a man badly wanted by the
  police? The idea was so fantastical that Danty could not grasp it. And then
  Connor began to tell his story.</p>

  <p>He did not explain the circumstances in which Luke had revealed his
  identity; but after his host had heard of the seeming treachery of Connor's
  confederate, he had no difficulty in bridging over the gap.</p>

  <p>"We were holding him to give him a towelling: when Gunner Haynes butted in
  and got him away. Naturally I didn't take any notice of the yarn he told,
  until one of my men found a passport."</p>

  <p>"You wrote to Mrs Maddison, did you?"</p>

  <p>Connor nodded. "We got a faked letter&mdash;I ought to be kicked for not
  knowing it was a fake. Anyway, the Gunner caught me in the park and got the
  passport away from me."</p>

  <p>Danty began to think quickly. He knew that this story was true, and that
  in some amazing way Luke had got himself mixed up in a gang war, and was now
  hiding from the police. The reason why the passport was so vital to him he
  could realize&mdash;that had been the real object of his burglarious entrance
  into his own flat. Once the passport was in his possession, it was a simple
  matter for him to melt away to the Continent, and with his disappearance from
  London vanished also every hope of bringing home to him his association with
  the Taffanny robbery. And Margaret knew&mdash;if not all, at least the vital
  part, of Connor's story.</p>

  <p>Here in his hand was the lever. To think, with Danton, was to act. He went
  out into the corridor to the telephone and rang up Margaret. She was certain
  to be in bed, but he would insist that she answered him. To his surprise it
  was her voice which replied.</p>

  <p>"Is that Margaret?"</p>

  <p>"Who is it speaking?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"It's Danton." he said. "Listen, Margaret, this is very
  important&mdash;did a man called Haynes call on you tonight?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated. "Yes," she said, "but I don't think that is any
  business&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen, please," he pleaded. "Did you give him any money? This is very
  important." Again the hesitation. "Did you?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "I gave him some money&mdash;not for himself&mdash;" She
  realized her error too late.</p>

  <p>"For somebody else?" asked Danty eagerly.</p>

  <p>He waited, and then heard the click of the instrument as she hung up the
  receiver. He came quickly back to Connor.</p>

  <p>"He's got the passport, and he's got money, and that means he'll leave for
  the Continent by tomorrow morning's train. I want you to get a couple of your
  gang down at the station tomorrow morning; they're to watch at the barrier
  and head back Maddison if he tries to leave England." He shouted for Pi
  Coles, "Bring me my shoes," he said; and, when the man had gone: "I'm going
  to see Mrs Maddison and get the first instalment of our pension, How much did
  you think you'd get from her if she had come over to your wharf?"</p>

  <p>"I reckoned on a thousand," said Connor, and Morell laughed
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"If this job is not worth a hundred thousand, it's worth nothing," he
  said,</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Somehow Margaret knew that the telephone message she had had
  from Danton would be followed up by a personal call, and she was not
  surprised when she heard the bell ring. She went to the landing.</p>

  <p>"If that is Mr Danton Morell, will you please bring him up?" she said to
  the footman, who was hurrying to the door.</p>

  <p>The first thing she noticed about Danty was a certain unkemptness which
  she had never observed before. Usually he was a most painfully tidy man;
  every hair of his glossy head was in place; his clothes were immaculate. But
  now his hair was unbrushed, he wore an odd coat and vest, and she formed the
  impression that he had risen hurriedly from his bed.</p>

  <p>She sensed his hostility, and the new attitude he had taken to her, within
  a second of his entering the room, "Margaret, I am afraid I've got a very
  unpleasant duty to perform," he said, almost jauntily. "It concerns this
  lunatic husband of yours. He seems to have got himself into a mess. What on
  earth made him do it?"</p>

  <p>"Do what?" she asked innocently.</p>

  <p>He smiled. "It's no use pretending you don't know, my dear girl. Luke has
  got himself mixed up with a gang. I don't know what is the pull they have or
  who is the woman in it." He added this maliciously, and was disappointed when
  she smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your mind runs on women, Danton. Perhaps it was the same lady whom you
  discovered in Paris&mdash;you remember, your man telegraphed me about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I swear to you&mdash;" he began, but she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It isn't worth while discussing that at all. What do you want now?"</p>

  <p>Danton shrugged his shoulders. "Well, there's a man called Connor, who
  seems to be pretty sore with you for not turning up tonight after you'd made
  an appointment. He said you'd promised him a thousand pounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I promised nothing of the sort, and I shouldn't dream of giving him a
  thousand pounds," said Margaret, and something made her add: "Or you either."
  She saw him wince. She had not known until then how important a part money
  played in Danton Morell's life.</p>

  <p>"There's no sense in getting up in the air about this," he said. "It won't
  help you or Luke to fight Connor. He's one of the most powerful gangsters in
  London, and unfortunately he knows that the man who robbed Taffanny's the
  other day was Luke. What are you going to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"I have still no proposal," she said.</p>

  <p>"Connor wants money&mdash;a couple of thousand pounds. I'm very naturally
  anxious to save you from the disgrace, and as the man came to me to ask my
  advice, I thought the best thing I could do would be to act as intermediary.
  You've been paying the wrong man, Margaret. Haynes cannot help you&mdash;by
  the way, you don't imagine the money you gave him tonight will ever get to
  Luke, do you?" When she did not answer, he went on: "It is nothing to do with
  me, and if you like to fight Connor that's your business entirely.
  But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him. "Do you suggest I should pay this two thousand pounds
  blackmail to your friend?"</p>

  <p>"He is not my friend," said the man testily, "and it is not blackmail.
  Apparently Luke borrowed the money from Connor."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly at this, her amused eyes on his. "How terribly
  unconvincing you can be, Mr Morell! Well, I'm going to tell you now that I'm
  not paying either you or Mr Connor. It will save us a lot of unnecessary
  argument."</p>

  <p>"Haynes advised you not to pay, eh?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No," she said quietly, "Inspector Bird. I got on to
  him after you telephoned, and put a hypothetical case to him&mdash;he is
  coming here." There was a sharp rat-tat on the door below. "I think that is
  he," she said, and had all the satisfaction she required out of the pallor
  that came to the face of Danton Morell.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to tell him?" he asked agitatedly. "I mean, about my
  asking for this money...about Connor? It will all come out&mdash;you realize
  that? About Luke, I mean. His name will be plastered all over London as a
  friend of murderers and a jewel thief..." He tailed off incoherently, and she
  went out of the room to meet The Sparrow.</p>

  <p>In the early hours of the morning Mr Bird was always in his most jovial
  mood. He had been at Scotland Yard engaged upon a case when Margaret had
  called him, and he seemed in no degree surprised, when he was shown into the
  drawing-room, to find the discomfited Danton Morell, standing guiltily and
  nervously with his back to the little fire that burnt on the hearth.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, wonders will never cease. I haven't been asked out to a party
  for years. Fancy meeting you, Danty!" he chuckled.</p>

  <p>His heavy eyes surveyed Margaret. "If you think I'm going to lecture you
  about keeping bad company, you've got another guess coming, Mrs Maddison. I
  realize you're a social leader, and naturally you do charitable work amongst
  the criminal classes. What's the trouble, Danty&mdash;lost your uncle and
  want your train fare out of London? This isn't your hypo&mdash;what's the
  word, Mrs Maddison, hypothetical case? 'What should you do if people asked
  you for money to keep a secret?' that was the question, wasn't it? Danty
  wouldn't do such a low thing as that, would you, Danty? He's never done
  anything except con work, and he's a reformed character now. He's given up
  thieving and gone into the Stock Exchange."</p>

  <p>"I'm not on the Stock Exchange," snapped Danty, stung to an answer.</p>

  <p>"Thought you'd gone on today," said The Sparrow amiably. "I saw the flags
  out in the City. Must have been the King of Baluchistan getting the Freedom."
  He looked enquiringly at Margaret, and understood the signal in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, Danty, we'll not be keeping you much longer. Mrs Maddison and I
  have got a few private thoughts to exchange on the subject of blackmail.
  How's Connor?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen Connor for months," said Danton loudly.</p>

  <p>The detective rubbed his big chin.</p>

  <p>"That's queer, Here am I thinking he called at your house tonight and that
  he's waiting for you to come back. Getting old, I guess&mdash;we have these
  illusions at my time of life&mdash;always fancy we're seeing crooks when
  they're only stockbrokers, and not even that."</p>

  <p>It was a very uncomfortable Danton Morell that went down the stairs, too
  terrified to be angry. There was no cab in sight, but a car that looked
  suspiciously like a police tender was drawn up near the kerb a few houses
  away, and he hurried past this and was glad when he turned the corner out of
  the still bright glare of its headlamps.</p>

  <p>Connor was playing euchre with Pi Coles when he came in. "Well, did you
  have any luck?" The man was too cheerful for Danty's liking: he would have
  preferred a more despondent and unhoping note in his tone.</p>

  <p>"I've got no money, if that's what you mean&mdash;The Sparrow was
  there."</p>

  <p>Connor sat up, his narrowed eyes fixed upon his host. "That sounds like a
  damned lie to me," he said, but Danty took no offence.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't at the house when I got there, but I'd hardly started talking
  before he turned up. She had sent for him." This time Connor was convinced.
  His lips pursed as though he were whistling some inaudible tune.</p>

  <p>"Did my name come into it?" he asked, after a moment's thought.</p>

  <p>"Yes, The Sparrow brought it in. He said he knew you came to this flat
  tonight and that you were waiting for me."</p>

  <p>Connor leaned back in the chair, frowning thoughtfully. "I wonder if
  that's a lie too?" he said, speaking to himself. "It mightn't be&mdash;he's
  been trailing me for a week&mdash;not he but one of his bloodhounds. Did she
  squeak?"</p>

  <p>Danty did not reply till he had hung up his coat.</p>

  <p>"She didn't and she won't. I know her! She's got a bug in her head that
  he's an ill-used man, and she's going to try to save him without letting the
  police know."</p>

  <p>Connor took a cigar from his pocket, bit off the end and lit it. He puffed
  slowly, his eyes on the ceiling, and then he said: "I'm out of this. I don't
  go after women who've got the brains to call in the police. You go ahead,
  Danty, and I'll take my corner. Twenty-five per cent is good enough for any
  man."</p>

  <p>Danty glared down at him. "I'm to do the work and you'll take the profit,
  eh? Is that the idea? When did we float this company?"</p>

  <p>Connor smiled broadly. "I brought the business: that's my answer to you. I
  can't afford to be mixed up in it now my name's known and they've brought in
  The Sparrow. You can handle these swells, Danty, and you're wide enough to
  keep yourself out of trouble." He rose, reached for his coat and hat and
  moved to the door. In the doorway he stood for a little while surveying the
  other man. "Twenty-five per cent," he said. "You'll split that way or I'll do
  a bit of splitting myself."</p>

  <p>Danty followed him to the landing. "Where does the Gunner live?"</p>

  <p>Connor shook his head. "I'll tail him up and let you know in the morning,"
  he said. "He's got a quiet pitch somewhere."</p>

  <p>Danty went back to his flat and closed the door. Usually he did not
  discuss matters with Pi Coles, but this little man was shrewd and
  understanding. He had touched most illicit occupations, from larceny to
  felony, and was a surprisingly well educated man. He was one of those men, so
  infrequently met with, who had occupied his many visitations to prison in
  reading and study; for though he spoke with the vilest Cockney accent and his
  English was more or less negligible, he could speak French and Spanish
  fluently&mdash;the former accomplishment had served him remarkably well, for
  he had served a year in a French prison.</p>

  <p>For the first time Danton showed his hand. He had not before been very
  communicative on the subject of Luke Maddison and his wife, but now he opened
  up. Pi Coles listened with the puckered face which was evidence of his close
  application. It was when Danton mentioned Gunner Haynes that he shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"I'd keep clear of him if I were you, guv'nor," he said. "You know what
  happened?" He nodded significantly.</p>

  <p>Danton knew all that had happened; but he flattered himself that he
  understood the psychology of the criminal mind. Such men as the Gunner
  forgave even the stealing of their wives. Probably Gunner Haynes, with his
  philosophical outlook, bore him little or no malice for that incident.
  Anyway, the girl was dead, and could never tell the story that might bring
  the Gunner at his throat. Wasn't there anything he knew about
  him&mdash;something that he could hang over the Gunner's head, some old crime
  in which they had both participated?</p>

  <p>Danty was a miser of trifles; he was the sort of man who hoarded even
  unwanted souvenirs. In his bedroom was a safe where he kept the most precious
  of these. Letters tied together with bootlaces; old scraps of press cuttings
  relative to previous exploits; and, in an oblong blotting book, a little
  square of paper covered with scrawled writing, which he should have destroyed
  the night it came into his hands.</p>

  <p>But he hated burning anything, or those mad letters of the girl whose
  heart he had broken would have been ashes years ago.</p>

  <p>He found certain records, letters that the Gunner had written to him in
  the days when they were partners, but nothing that would incriminate him,
  nothing that he could use today. He closed the safe with a bang, and, locking
  it, returned to Pi, who in his absence had formulated a brand-new idea.</p>

  <p>"You can leave the Gunner alone and get away with it, guv'nor," he said.
  "Suppose this man Maddison is staying with Haynes, what's to stop you getting
  at Maddison and leaving out Haynes altogether? And what's the use of his wife
  to you, anyway? You've only to get Maddison away to the Continent with a
  cheque-book, and you're on easy street for the rest of your life."</p>

  <p>Danty listened and frowned. That possibility had not occurred to him. He
  went to bed at three o'clock that morning and did not fall asleep until
  seven. When he awoke, at midday, he found that Connor had sent a messenger
  with a letter. It was unaddressed, for that was Connor's way, and, tearing
  open the envelope, Danty took out a slip of paper torn from a cheap notebook.
  It ran: "L. M. staying with G. H. at 974 Pennybody Buildings,
  Clerkenwell."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch29"
     id="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Margaret woke that morning with a fixed determination. She
  had fenced with the detective and once or twice had been badly pinked. He was
  too shrewd a man, too wise in the artless guile which passes in criminal
  circles for clever evasion, to be deceived by her. Her hypothetical case he
  demolished, and revealed with alarming clearness the figure and deeds of
  Luke. He did not say as much; he did not even connect the missing banker with
  the Taffanny robbery. All that he knew was that Luke Maddison had made a fool
  of himself, that somebody had got hold of the fact and was trying to
  blackmail his wife; but what shape that folly took, he regarded as being
  indelicate to enquire.</p>

  <p>In sheer desperation, when she found herself cornered, and the facts which
  she was trying to conceal coming to light, Margaret had been forced to accept
  the suggestion of a woman, though she loathed herself for her new disloyalty.
  She spoke vaguely of an earlier attachment, but, since she was a bad liar,
  she carried no conviction. The very fact that she was not speaking the truth
  in reality saved her from closer questioning. The Sparrow jumped to a
  conclusion which was wrong.</p>

  <p>"The only thing I can tell you, Mrs Maddison, is that, whatever happens,
  you're not to pay anybody anything. If it's Danty or Connor, or whoever it is
  putting the black on you, you've only to ring me up to stop 'em!" He left
  with the definite assurance that she would take this step.</p>

  <p>She had to force herself to go to bed that night, and will herself to
  sleep. She had a heavy day ahead of her and no plans definitely fixed. The
  Gunner had told her nothing except that he was in touch with Luke. Had he
  told her that he was trying to get him out of England? If he hadn't, she had
  in some occult way received that impression.</p>

  <p>Luke would make for Ronda, whither his cheque-book had been sent. She must
  follow him&mdash;accompany him if possible. She went early to the bank and
  saw Steele.</p>

  <p>He was&mdash;for Steele&mdash;in an optimistic frame of mind. Two or three
  undertakings in which the bank was interested had become flourishing. "One I
  had written down as a bad debt, and it looks like bringing in eighteen
  thousand a year," he almost chortled the news. "I wish you'd let Mr Maddison
  know that: he'll be delighted. I'd have sent him a wire to Spain, only I
  don't know his address." And then, realizing that her appearance at this hour
  was unusual: "Is there anything you want, Mrs Maddison?"</p>

  <p>"I want to see my husband's private account. You had it transferred to the
  bank."</p>

  <p>He took her into his private room, brought the pass-book to her, and she
  ran her finger down the column. The last cheque drawn was a few days before
  his wedding. Since then, Steele told her, no cheque had come in. "I've been
  expecting some in. Mr Maddison is rather extravagant at times, and I'm
  surprised that he hasn't cashed a cheque&mdash;although of course he's got
  his Spanish account&mdash;but I should have thought he would wish to
  replenish that."</p>

  <p>"That is what I've come to see you about, Mr Steele," she said. "I want
  you not to honour any cheque drawn by my husband for any amount over a
  thousand pounds." Steele stared at her over his glasses.</p>

  <p>This was the resolution she had reached as she lay in bed on the previous
  night. She had gone over every possibility step by step, had seen the
  likelihood of the blackmailers transferring their attention from her to Luke.
  At present Luke was safe, under the protection of the Gunner; but something
  might happen to remove him from this watchful, hawk-faced man. Somehow, for a
  reason which she could not understand, she trusted the Gunner implicitly, was
  sure that, whatever his record might be, he would do no harm to Luke.</p>

  <p>"That's an extraordinary request you're making, Mrs Maddison," said
  Steele, troubled. "It's quite likely that Mr Maddison may want to make a big
  purchase&mdash;the last time he was in Spain he bought some property in
  Seville that showed a profit of fifty per cent the first year."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "I realize that, but I still make this request&mdash;in his
  name."</p>

  <p>"Very good, Mrs Maddison." Steele scribbled some instructions on a slip of
  paper and pinned it to the ledger he had bought in. "I don't know what's in
  your mind, but I understood that you had transferred everything back to Mr
  Maddison&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It isn't that," she explained hastily. "It's the possibility of&mdash;"
  But here she was at a loss; she could not offer any explanation which an
  intelligent man would accept, unless the whole story were revealed.</p>

  <p>Her car was parked in Waterloo Place, and she was waiting whilst the
  commissionaire brought it, when, turning her head, she saw a man standing at
  the corner, and something about his attitude was familiar. He was still there
  when the commissionaire returned with the car, and she had to pass the
  loiterer. It was then that she saw his face and tapped at the window. He saw
  her too, and for once Gunner Haynes' sang-froid deserted him and he looked
  uncomfortable. The car pulled up with a jerk; she beckoned the man toward her
  and he came reluctantly. "Will you drive with me, please?" she asked, a
  little breathlessly. "There are one or two questions I want to settle."</p>

  <p>He hesitated. "It won't do you very much good, Mrs Maddison, to be seen
  driving with me."</p>

  <p>"Come in, please," she ordered imperiously, and he stepped in and sat down
  by her side.</p>

  <p>Through the microphone she gave an order to the driver.</p>

  <p>"I want to see my husband," she said, when this was done.</p>

  <p>The Gunner shook his head. "I don't think that's going to be very useful
  to you. Too many people have seen him already."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she demanded, and she saw Haynes' face harden.</p>

  <p>"I tried to get him away this morning by the early mail. Two of Connor's
  men were there to head him off; I don't know how they did it, but they'd
  persuaded a couple of dicks&mdash;detectives&mdash;to watch the barriers, and
  I didn't dare chance it. I tried again at eleven o'clock and I didn't have
  any better luck. Of course, Connor guessed, when I took the passport, what I
  was going to do."</p>

  <p>"When you took the passport?" she said in surprise. "When did you take the
  passport?"</p>

  <p>The Gunner deftly slid round the question. "Your husband's getting a bit
  on my mind and is interfering with my unlawful occasions." There was a faint
  smile in his eyes as he said this.</p>

  <p>"Were you waiting at the bank to see me?" He smiled again.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, Mrs Maddison, I didn't even know you were there, and
  didn't realize it was the bank. The truth is"&mdash;he seemed more
  uncomfortable still&mdash;"there's a young lady who comes to this part of the
  world, and I occasionally take tea with her. I think she's more interested in
  me as a criminal and a source of copy than in anything else." He smiled
  wryly. "But I'm very grateful to have the opportunity of meeting a decent
  girl. She's a newspaper woman, as they call 'em in America, and she covers
  some of these West End functions."</p>

  <p>Margaret laughed softly. It was the first time she had laughed for a very
  long while. "Poor Mr Haynes! I'm terribly sorry if I've robbed you of a
  tete-a-tete."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "No, there was no possibility of her coming&mdash;It's
  too late. And of course, there's always the chance that that obese Sparrow
  might be with her."</p>

  <p>"You're talking of Mr Bird&mdash;and the girl's name is Bolford."</p>

  <p>He started. "Did you know?" he gasped, and then: "Oh, of course, she has
  met you. She told me once. No, there's no romance in it, Mrs Maddison, just a
  congenial"&mdash;he shrugged&mdash;"friendship. I am thankful for small
  mercies."</p>

  <p>"Are you married?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I was," was the short reply, and she did not feel encouraged to pursue
  her enquiries.</p>

  <p>"Can I see my husband? I think I should, don't you?"</p>

  <p>He looked at her oddly. "Does it strike you as a possibility that he might
  not want to see you?" he asked bluntly, and saw the red come into her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I have blinded myself wilfully to that possibility," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"But he is in trouble, and a wife's place is by her husband's side," he
  mocked, and for a moment she hated him. Then her sense of humour overcame her
  annoyance.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we'll put it like that. It sounds terribly trite, but most trite
  things are true."</p>

  <p>The Gunner was silent for a long time, but presently he sighed. "I've got
  an idea that whatever I'm doing is quite wrong, and that I ought to let you
  help him. Mrs Maddison, It's going to be a very difficult thing to get this
  husband of yours away out of England. You're going to say 'aeroplane'&mdash;I
  can see it in your eyes&mdash;but you can bet that Connor has got his people
  at Croydon, too. The only thing to do is to smuggle him away in a motor-car
  to a seaside place, hire a yacht and push him across the Channel. It's not
  going to be easy, especially as he's not terribly keen on your giving him any
  help at all."</p>

  <p>She pondered this as the car went slowly round the park. "I'll take the
  risk of a snub," she said, "if you'll take the risk of offending him. Will
  you let me see him?"</p>

  <p>Haynes nodded. "Yes, but you're not going to take this expensive car, Mrs
  Maddison&mdash;into my neighbourhood, I mean. We'll stop the car at Hyde Park
  Corner and get a taxi." This they did. "The only thing that's troubling me,"
  he said, as they were driving along Piccadilly, "is whether Connor has tailed
  me to my home. 'Tail' is slang for 'trail'."</p>

  <p>"You think they followed you there? Didn't they know where you live?"</p>

  <p>"They know many places I live," explained the Gunner whimsically, "but
  this is one they don't know, or didn't until this morning." They paid off the
  cab two hundred yards from the model dwelling where Haynes had his home, and
  at that hour fortunately there were few people about, and certainly none who
  seemed to evince the slightest curiosity in the presence of this well-dressed
  woman. They had to pass through a little gateway to reach the asphalt square
  that formed the quadrangle of the huge block, and she saw the Gunner look
  back, and there was trouble in his face.</p>

  <p>"They've tailed me all right," he said grimly. "Did you see that motor-van
  on the street outside? The man at the wheel was one of Connor's little
  friends. You won't see him now&mdash;he's gone. Connor uses motor-vans a
  lot." As he was mounting the few steps which led to the landing from which
  his flat opened, a slatternly woman came out of a door opposite.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's all right taking your wardrobe away, Mr What's-your-name?"
  she said.</p>

  <p>The Gunner spun round. "Took my wardrobe? What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"The men from the furniture place came about an hour ago&mdash;two chaps
  in green aprons. They had the key, so I thought it was all right."</p>

  <p>The Gunner asked no further questions: he opened the door and ran into the
  passage. The door of Luke's room was open. He looked at the disorder, saw the
  bloodstained sheets, and turned to meet the white face of Margaret Maddison.
  "I'm afraid your husband's gone," he said, in such a matter-of-fact tone that
  she was deceived.</p>

  <p>He closed the door behind him and led her into the little sitting-room.
  "He won't be back till late, so I don't think it's worth while your
  staying."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" she asked. "Why were you so worried when they talked
  about the wardrobe being taken away?"</p>

  <p>"An old wardrobe that I sold," said the Gunner. "It's not worth while
  keeping stuff that isn't much use to you." He chatted with her pleasantly
  before he took her away, and, finding another cab, sent her home. She could
  not guess that he knew in his heart that the wardrobe had contained the body
  of Luke Maddison. Whether he was alive or dead he must find out. After he had
  left the girl Gunner Haynes went back to his room, rolled up the carpet, took
  up a floor-board, and, groping, found a box containing two small automatics.
  One of these he slipped in a specially constructed inside pocket of his coat;
  the other went into a small holster which buckled to his braces.</p>

  <p>"I think there is going to be some trouble tonight," said Gunner Haynes,
  addressing nobody in particular.</p>

  <p class="first">Luke Maddison had only the most confused memory of what
  followed his incautious opening of the door. He had been sitting reading when
  he heard a knock, and saw nothing suspicious in the appearance of two men in
  green baize aprons and shirt-sleeves.</p>

  <p>"Is this Mr Haynes' flat?" asked one. "We've come to take the wardrobe
  away."</p>

  <p>"You'd better return when Mr Haynes is here," said Luke, thinking
  naturally that the Gunner had given instructions for the removal of a piece
  of furniture.</p>

  <p>"If we can't take it away we'd like to measure it," said the man, who
  carried a notebook ostentatiously in his hand.</p>

  <p>Luke Maddison hesitated. He knew nothing about wardrobes, or indeed of any
  of the domestic arrangements of the flat. But there could be no harm in
  acceding to this request. He turned his back upon the men for a second, and
  after that he remembered nothing distinctly.</p>

  <p>His first conscious impression was of having his face roughly cleaned by a
  cold, wet sponge. There was a rank smell of tar in the air, and the room in
  which he was sitting seemed to be in motion. He thought at first that this
  was one of the many illusions he was experiencing, but when his eyes wandered
  round the apartment and saw the heavily timbered ribs of the room, the low
  wooden ceiling and the black, tar-painted floor, he realized that he was not
  dreaming.</p>

  <p>"Am I on a ship?" he asked huskily, and heard a laugh.</p>

  <p>He recognized the man who had the sponge in his hand as the artist who had
  once before wielded a cosh.</p>

  <p>"Was it you...in the baize apron? I didn't recognize you."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't me this time, guv'nor," said the man, who seemed chronically
  hoarse. "I wouldn't have drawn blood&mdash;you ain't hurt. Drink this."</p>

  <p>Luke drank the weak brandy and water that was offered to him, but would
  have preferred plain water.</p>

  <p>"You're a regular nuisance to us, you are, guv'nor," said the man,
  dropping the sponge into a pail of water and wiping his hands on a
  grimy-looking handkerchief. "Now you take my advice and keep quiet. There's a
  proper bed for you here, and you'll find a pail of water in the stern.
  Nobody's going to hurt you if you behave yourself."</p>

  <p>"Am I on a ship?" asked Luke again.</p>

  <p>"Barge," was the reply. "There's nothing to be afraid of. The Gunner's
  looking for you, but he won't find you." He turned to his silent companion,
  and only then was Luke aware that there was a second man in the cabin, if
  such a foul place could be dignified by such a name.</p>

  <p>"We oughtn't to have laid him on the bed. That was the give-away, Harry,"
  he said. "It was my fault, but we had to put him somewhere. You're stronger
  than I thought, Maddison."</p>

  <p>Luke chuckled feebly. "I don't remember that I put up a fight, Did I?"</p>

  <p>"Put up a fight?" said the other. "I should say you did! It was when we
  got you in the bedroom that you started scrapping. Don't you remember?" Luke
  remembered nothing. "The guv'nor's coming aboard in a minute&mdash;we're
  moored very near the wharf. If you're a sensible man, Mr Maddison, you'll do
  what he asks. There'll be no funny business, now we know who you are." He
  looked curiously at Luke. "A pal of Lewing's, wasn't you? That's a funny
  game, mixing with a crowd like that. I'm surprised that a gentleman like you
  should have got yourself into that kind of trouble." Luke did not reply. The
  two men went soon after, leaving the smoky lamp to illuminate the gloom.</p>

  <p>A short flight of steps led to a heavy hatchway, which was closed. There
  was a kind of washing-place in the stern of the craft. There was no porthole
  through which he could see daylight, and a system of ventilation did not
  exist, Such air as came was admitted through three circular holes cut in the
  hatchway, and he suspected that over this was a canvas cover, for he could
  see no light.</p>

  <p>Everything of value had been taken from him. His clothes were soiled with
  blood&mdash;he found his sodden collar in a corner of the cabin; and his head
  ached all the time. Nevertheless, he was beginning to feel hungry when the
  hatchway was pulled back and the legs of a man appeared on the first step of
  the ladder.</p>

  <p>He discovered now why he had seen no light: there was evidently a small
  deckhouse above the hatchway, and he caught a glimpse of this as his visitor
  was descending. It was Connor, who greeted him with the air of a friend who
  had been badly treated.</p>

  <p>"You've given us a lot of trouble, Mr Maddison," he said, unconscious of
  repeating the words of his lieutenant; "and when people give me trouble they
  have to pay for it. I've come to have a little talk with you. You want to get
  away to the Continent, don't you?" Luke did not answer. "Don't be obstinate,"
  begged Connor, with a friendly grin. "I'm trying to help you. I've fixed up
  with a boat&mdash;the skipper's a friend of mine&mdash;to take you to
  Rotterdam in the morning." He took something out of his pocket which Luke
  recognized.</p>

  <p>"Here's your passport&mdash;my boys found that when they were rummaging
  round at the Gunner's house. You take it from me, Mr Maddison, I am the best
  friend you ever had."</p>

  <p>Luke smiled wryly. "I gather that this is the trouble I'm going to pay
  for, isn't it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a sensible man." said Connor. "Yes, It's going to cost you a
  bit, but you can afford it." From his inside pocket he brought out a long
  envelope, and from this extracted three blank cheques.</p>

  <p>"I want you to make these out yourself: one for two, one for three, and
  one for five thousand. It'll look better that way, and look much better if
  the cheques are in your handwriting."</p>

  <p>"May I see them?"</p>

  <p>The man passed the cheques to him and Luke chuckled again. "My poor
  conspirator!" he said mockingly. "I haven't more than a hundred pounds in
  that account&mdash;or any other."</p>

  <p>Connor's eyes narrowed. "Are you pulling one on me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm telling you the truth," said Luke, 'though I can quite understand it
  sounds so strange to you that it seems a lie. This is on my private account,
  which is down to nothing&mdash;one of the last things I did before
  I&mdash;before I went away, was to transfer most of the money I had in this
  account to my own bank."</p>

  <p>"But you always used the Northern and Southern?" insisted Connor.</p>

  <p>He was obviously perturbed by the discovery, as well he might be, for he
  had spent the afternoon searching London for the right 'kites'. There is
  quite a brisk trade in blank cheque forms, and certain sources from which
  they can be obtained.</p>

  <p>It had taken him some time to track Luke's bank, a longer time to get the
  necessary forms, and his discomfiture was pardonable.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I've got no money," said Luke, "so your labours are all
  wasted."</p>

  <p>"Yes, you have," interrupted Connor. "Your missus transferred all your
  money back to you after you'd left."</p>

  <p>This was news to Luke, but obviously the man was not talking at random.
  "Who told you this?"</p>

  <p>"A pal of yours," said the other coolly.</p>

  <p>"Danton Morell?"</p>

  <p>Connor nodded.</p>

  <p>"It would not have gone back to this account, anyway," said Luke after a
  moment's thought: "it would be in my own bank." Connor understood humanity
  sufficiently well to realize that his prisoner was speaking the truth.</p>

  <p>"But you'll sign the cheques when I get them, won't you, Mr Maddison?"</p>

  <p>Luke shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to threaten you: I want this thing done in a gentlemanly
  way," said Connor earnestly. "You're a rich man, and a few hundreds more or
  less isn't going to hurt you. Somebody's got to get you out of the country,
  and the Gunner can't. If you trust me, I'll see you right, and I'll never
  come to you for another penny&mdash;you know that I can't put the black on
  you once you get away from England: that's why I'm asking big money now.
  You're a business man, Mr Maddison, and you've got enough sense to see that
  if I 'blacked' you after this I should be cutting my own throat. I've had a
  cabin made up for you forrard, and I'll take your word that you won't try to
  escape&mdash;and I don't see why you should either, with the police looking
  for you. Is it a deal?"</p>

  <p>"You'll get not a bean out of me," said Luke defiantly.</p>

  <p>Connor looked at him long and thoughtfully. "All right," he said; "you can
  stay here and starve till you change your mind." For a second Luke was
  tempted to rush at him as he ascended the steps. A low tackle would bring him
  down; but Luke was still very weak: he sat passively till the hatch was
  pulled tight. It was dark on deck&mdash;but not too dark for Mr Connor, as he
  dropped to the little row-boat which was alongside the barge.</p>

  <p>He did not go to his wharf, but made for some narrow steps opposite to
  where the barge was moored, and, making his way to the City, he hailed a taxi
  and was driven to Half Moon Street.</p>

  <p>Danty was just going out when his visitor arrived, and Mr Danton Morell
  was not in a good mood.</p>

  <p>"What was the idea of sending me that address?" he said. "I went down
  there this afternoon, and nearly ran into Gunner Haynes."</p>

  <p>"Then why the hell did you go?" demanded Connor.</p>

  <p>"To see Maddison. I could have persuaded him to part. Maddison isn't
  there. A woman in the buildings told me that the Gunner had locked up his
  flat and gone away. Where is Maddison?"</p>

  <p>Connor lit a cigar before he replied. "I've got him&mdash;I think I was in
  a quarter here, wasn't I, Danty? Well, I'm in three-quarters now, and I'm
  being generous. You've had your chance and you've missed it. What is he
  worth?"</p>

  <p>Danty stifled his rising anger which was provoked by the tone of the man.
  There was no sense in getting on the wrong side of Connor, and the question
  of distribution might very well wait over for another and more propitious
  moment. "Half a million, I should think. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Half a million, eh?" Connor ignored the question. "Would he stand a
  hundred thousand?"</p>

  <p>The other man thought a moment. "Yes, he'd stand a hundred thousand if he
  could get it," he said.</p>

  <p>"He said he hadn't got a bean."</p>

  <p>"He's got money all right," said Danty savagely. "It's all in his own
  bank."</p>

  <p>Connor pondered this for a long time. "That'll mean ten kites. Can you get
  them?"</p>

  <p>Danty frowned. "What do you want cheques for?"</p>

  <p>Connor closed his eyes wearily. "You've been so long out of the con game
  that you've forgotten your business," he said offensively. "I want the
  cheques for him to sign, that's all. Can you get them?"</p>

  <p>Danty thought for a moment. "I've got a cheque-book on that bank," he
  said. "I had a small account there. But they won't be any good: they'll be
  able to trace the cheques to me. But I can get them." He went to the
  telephone and called Margaret's number. The servant who replied told him that
  she was out, which was just the news he wanted.</p>

  <p>"When will she be back? It is Mr Morell speaking." He half expected a
  message to the effect that Mrs Maddison would not be in to him at any
  time.</p>

  <p>"Not till after lunch, sir."</p>

  <p>Danty hung up the 'phone. "Wait here." he said. "I think I know where I
  can get all the kites you want." He knew a great deal about Margaret and her
  domestic habits&mdash;he had been deeper in her confidence than any other
  man. The butler was surprised to see him, but took him up to Margaret's
  sitting-room without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I didn't make myself clear, sir. Madam will not be back for another
  hour." Danty smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think you will find she returns a little sooner than that." he said,
  almost gaily, "Anyway, I'll wait for her." The door had hardly closed upon
  the servant before he was at Margaret's desk.</p>

  <p>It was unlocked, and in one of the side drawers he knew she invariably
  kept two cheque-books. They were there, as he had expected: one half empty,
  one unused.</p>

  <p>From the end of the latter he tore a dozen cheques, slipped them in his
  pocket and closed the desk, before he rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I will wait: I'll call back in an hour. My business isn't
  so pressing, and I've just thought of some call I had to make." Within half
  an hour of leaving he was back with Connor and laid the cheques before him.
  Mr Connor asked no questions, nor was there any necessity.</p>

  <p>"You're going to make him sign these? Shall I come along with you?"</p>

  <p>Connor grinned. "I don't think that's a clever idea." he said. "You'll get
  your corner, Danty."</p>

  <p>He could not approach the barge in broad daylight, for he knew that he was
  under police observation. As soon as it was dark he slipped down the stream
  and clambered aboard the craft, carrying with him a basket of food and a
  vacuum flask full of hot tea. The light which he had left had burnt itself
  out. Luke was half sleeping on the bed that had been prepared for him, but
  the rush of cold, fresh air awakened him.</p>

  <p>Connor switched on an electric lamp he was carrying, and put it on the
  floor, with one or two refills. "Here's your food," he said, "I'm sorry to
  have kept you so long, but I hope you've got more intelligence now than you
  had when I left you. And here are the kites: I'd like you to fill them in in
  your own hand." Luke reached for the food and ate it ravenously. He was
  feeling hungry, and his vitality was at its lowest ebb. The hot tea probably
  revived him more than the food, and he was almost cheerful when he swept the
  last crumbs from his knees.</p>

  <p>"Now, what are your kites?" he said. "Oh, cheques! You want me to fill
  them up and sign them&mdash;for what fabulous amount? You can make it a
  million if you like, but I can assure you that they will not be honoured. I
  think I told you before that all my money is in my wife's name."</p>

  <p>"In that case we'll have a little joke," said Connor, not taking his eyes
  from his prisoner. "You'll make each of these cheques out for ten thousand,
  and date 'em a week apart. If you want to stay longer than ten weeks you can
  date 'em a month apart; or, if you'd like to get away in a few days, you can
  sign one cheque for a hundred thousand pounds and you can write a letter to
  your bank manager telling him the kite's got to be honoured."</p>

  <p>Before he had finished, Luke was laughing. "I've got a very keen sense of
  humour," he said, "but it doesn't strike me as being a joke for a banker to
  draw cheques on a debit account."</p>

  <p>Connor pulled up a stool and sat down. "Let's have this thing right," he
  said. "You know me, you know my name; I've put myself in for a ten years'
  sentence, probably longer. I'd as soon hang as spend my life in Broadmoor,
  and that's just the risk I'm taking, Mr Maddison. I'll plug you and drop you
  over the side, or you'll do as I ask. You're a sensible man and I'm putting
  the case to you. I can't let you go without the money." He drew the stool a
  little closer. "I've been battling for years at this river work and gang
  work, and what do you think I've got to show for it? The lease of an old
  wharf that's not worth a monkey; about a couple of thousand planted away in
  country banks, and the certainty that sooner or later one of my rats will
  squeak on me. I've got a chance now of getting away with big
  money&mdash;you've got a chance of clearing yourself. I'll make a signed
  statement, giving the facts about the Taffanny smash&mdash;is it a bet?"</p>

  <p>It was not the moment for heroics. Luke realized this very definitely. He
  had no doubt in his mind that, in the last extremity, Connor would keep his
  word, and there would be the end of all things. It was not a moment to snap
  fingers in the face of fate. Connor had put the situation on a business
  basis, and this was not the time to consider the niceties of business
  etiquette. If he drew a cheque and it were presented, he had no doubt in his
  mind that the cheque would not be met; enquiries would be set afoot, and
  possibly he would be traced.</p>

  <p>"I think it is foolish to attempt to put in a cheque for ten thousand," he
  said. "The amount is so big that, even if I had the money, Steele would be
  suspicious. I'm willing to make a compromise: I'll give you a cheque for five
  thousand pounds. If that is honoured&mdash;which it will not be&mdash;your
  luck is in, and you had better clear before there are enquiries. Obviously no
  bank manager in his senses would payout a hundred thousand pounds without
  communicating with the man who drew the cheques."</p>

  <p>He saw Connor smile. "That's the stuff I like to hear," said the man.
  "That's intelligent. Where are you supposed to be&mdash;in Spain, aren't
  you?"</p>

  <p>Luke frowned. "I suppose I am. Why?"</p>

  <p>"We'll draw this five thousand, and then you and me will go to Spain
  together. I'll get you away tonight."</p>

  <p>The scheme did not even seem feasible to Luke, but he made no comment. He
  wrote and signed the cheque and handed it to the other. "And now," said Luke,
  "I'd like a little fresh air. This place is stifling me."</p>

  <p>Connor hesitated. "Come up on deck, but if there's any monkey business I
  may have to do something I shall be sorry for." A few seconds later Luke sat
  on the edge of the hatchway, sucking in the cool, sweet air. The hatch was on
  the well of the barge, and this was covered with tarpaulin. He could see this
  by the light of a flashing electric sign erected on one of the towers that
  fringed the river. Opposite was a line of lights which stood for the Thames
  Embankment. A fussy little tug was moving slowly against the tide upstream;
  he heard the hoot and shriek of a train as it passed across one of the
  bridges. The lights of the West End painted the low-lying clouds a dull
  orange. The tide was on the turn; he heard the lap of it against the flat bow
  of the barge.</p>

  <p>For ten minutes he sat in silence, then rose on to the deck and stretched
  his cramped limbs.</p>

  <p>"If I promised not to leave the barge, or attempt to attract attention,
  would you leave the hatch open, Mr Connor?"</p>

  <p>Connor's laugh was his answer. "Don't be silly! That word of honour stuff
  doesn't mean anything to me."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad," said Luke. "If you had accepted my word it might have been
  very embarrassing." As he spoke, his hand shot out, and Connor went sprawling
  on to the hatch.</p>

  <p>Before he could recover, Luke had reached the edge of the barge, and,
  without a glance, had plunged in and was striking out for mid-stream.</p>

  <p>He heard no sound but the patter of footsteps on the hollow hatches, and
  then a voice giving urgent instructions. Connor must have a row-boat moored
  alongside, he decided. The tide had already swept him clear of the barge; it
  was running strongly, and there was nothing nearer to him than a line of
  moored lighters in the centre of the river. To make for these, however, would
  be to invite discovery. He struck back towards the shore.</p>

  <p>As he did so, he saw a shape come round the bow of the barge. Connor had
  come in a motor-launch. It moved too quickly to be anything else. There was
  only one thing to do. He drew a lungful of air and dived towards the launch,
  swimming hard against the tide. He seemed to be under the water for an
  eternity; his lungs and head were bursting when he came to the surface,
  coming up just under the stern of the launch, so close that the whirling
  little propeller seemed to touch his hair.</p>

  <p>Neither of the two men in the launch had seen him. He just caught the
  silhouette of their heads and shoulders peering over the side, and then he
  sank again.</p>

  <p>He was lamentably weak; his effort could not be long sustained. He had to
  come again to the surface, and was relieved to see no sign of the launch. As
  he trod water he saw it, making for the lighters in mid-stream. He was now
  twenty yards from a barge moored to a wharf, and, striking out, he caught the
  mooring chain and recovered his breath before he attempted to reach land.</p>

  <p>He was too weak to climb up to the barge; the only thing he could do was
  to complete his journey to the shore, and with infinite labour he succeeded
  at last, wading through mud up to his knees until he came to the blank face
  of a warehouse.</p>

  <p>There seemed no escape here. Looking back over his shoulder, he saw the
  launch returning. Somebody was fanning the water with an electric torch, and
  escape seemed impossible.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment he heard a hoarse voice hail him from the barge.</p>

  <p>"Give us your hand." He reached up and found it gripped. "Catch hold of
  the top of the pile," whispered the voice cheerfully, and, groping upward,
  Luke found a hold, and, with a superhuman effort and the assistance of his
  unknown friend, dragged himself up on to a narrow strip of wharfage running
  before the warehouse and scarcely wide enough for two people to walk
  abreast.</p>

  <p>"They didn't see you, did they?" whispered the unknown, and, before Luke
  could reply: "Push round to the left. Follow me&mdash;there's a watchman
  here; he's asleep, but don't make a row!" Luke Maddison found himself picking
  a way across a yard littered with paving stones and granite setts. He saw a
  long shed and the projecting shafts of vans. Somewhere near at hand were
  horses, for he heard one kicking in his stall.</p>

  <p>He followed stealthily, past a little lighted hut, wherein the night
  watchman (as he hoped) was sleeping. After a while they came to a heavy black
  gate; the wicket door was unfastened, and through this they slipped, Luke's
  rescuer closing the door softly behind him&mdash;apparently he had a key.</p>

  <p>"I saw 'em looking for you, but I thought they was out for Connor's lot."
  He swore most foully for a few seconds. "These river busies are worse than
  the land busies." By the light of a street lamp Luke took stock of his
  companion: a sharp, lantern-jawed man of thirty, with a Jewish nose and
  furtive eyes that never kept still. "You're wet, ain' t you? Come into
  Connor's yard: he'll give you a change."</p>

  <p>"No thank you," said Luke hastily. "I don't want anything to do with
  Connor."</p>

  <p>"You don't want anything to do with Connor, eh? Well, you're wise. Got any
  money?"</p>

  <p>Luke felt in his pockets. "No," he said.</p>

  <p>The man uttered a grunt of disgust. "I thought at least I'd get a quid out
  of it. Where do you live?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know where the devil I do live," said Luke irritably, and he
  heard the thin, whistling laugh of his companion.</p>

  <p>"You're a swell&mdash;I thought you was when I first heard you speak. Ever
  busted a safe? There's one in that warehouse and nothing else. They told me
  there was a lot of stuff there. I've been three days getting in and out. The
  only way you can do it is to go through the stone yard. But I'll bet there's
  some stuff in the safe. Have you ever busted one?"</p>

  <p>"Never," said Luke, and added: "It's one of the few things I haven't
  done."</p>

  <p>"What were the busies after you for? Was you doing the lighter?" The man
  was under the impression that Luke was a fugitive from the river police, and
  he did not undeceive him. "It's a pretty hard life," said the other
  agreeably.</p>

  <p>They were reaching now a more populous centre, and the little man, who
  said his name was Curly, stopped.</p>

  <p>"You can't go into the street like this: they'd pinch you in a minute.
  You'd better come home with me. But I can't afford to keep you." Luke was led
  through divers byways to the meanest street he had ever struck.</p>

  <p>Although the hour was late, children were playing and screaming, women
  stood at the doors gossiping. Nobody took any notice of Luke and his
  companion, and presently they passed through a door, which Curly unlocked,
  along an evil-smelling passage and up an uncarpeted flight of stairs.</p>

  <p>"Go in there and get your wet clothes off." Curly opened a door, and,
  striking a match, lit a candle.</p>

  <p>The windows were heavily screened with an old piece of horse-blanket, and
  the furniture of the room consisted of a bed with horrible-looking bedding,
  and precious little else.</p>

  <p>Curly said he was going to see the landlord. He was gone some time, and
  when he returned Luke had overcome his repugnance to the soiled linen, and,
  having stripped and dried himself as well as he could on the one grimy towel
  that the room possessed, had crawled into the bed.</p>

  <p>Curly threw down on a chair a pair of trousers and an old shirt, which had
  the advantage of being clean.</p>

  <p>"That's all can get for you," he said, and picked up Luke's sodden suit,
  eyeing it with approval. The boots also came under his scrutiny. "Silk shirt,
  eh? I thought you was a swell. I'll get these dried for you." He disappeared
  and did not return. Ten minutes later, in spite of his unsavoury
  surroundings, Luke was fast asleep. When he woke the sun was shining through
  the holes in the blanket. Rising, he put on the shirt and trousers, feeling
  uncommonly chilly.</p>

  <p>There was noise enough downstairs; the howl of a crying child, a woman's
  strident voice, and the deeper, bullying tone of a man. He opened the door,
  went out on to the landing and called. Presently the owner of the deep voice
  appeared.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Are my clothes dried?" asked Luke politely.</p>

  <p>"What clothes?" The man was interested, and came heavily up the stairs: a
  big, unshaven brute, puffy-faced.</p>

  <p>"Gave Curly your clothes?" He kissed his hand loudly. "Say good-bye to
  'em, old man." Luke stared at him aghast.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean he's gone away with them?" That apparently was what he did
  mean. He also informed his guest that he needed half a crown for the night's
  lodging.</p>

  <p>"And then there's my trousers and shirt," he said. "What do I get for
  'em?" He took a long time before he consented to add to the loan an old
  jacket and a pair of worn shoes that were two sizes too small. He could, he
  thought, "get a bit out of Curly," from which Luke gathered he was going to
  share the proceeds of the stolen clothing. He added to his other beneficences
  a cup of tea and a thick slice of bread and margarine, and with this
  equipment the banker was turned out into the street.</p>

  <p>Rain was falling heavily. By the time he had reached Lambeth Bridge he was
  soaked through. He made for the park, and, finding a chair, drew it into the
  shelter of a big, overhanging tree. For a long time he sat there, and then he
  reached a decision. Disgrace and prison seemed a little less unpleasant
  prospect than cold and hunger. He decided to go to the bank.</p>

  <p>He did not know the time and asked a man who was hurrying past, without,
  however, eliciting the slightest response. He asked another man, who gruffly
  told him it was nearly twelve. He would find Steele in the office, and Steele
  meant comfort and food and decent clothing.</p>

  <p>As he came out of the park gates somebody caught him by the arm and swung
  him round, and he looked into the unsympathetic face of a man who was
  obviously a detective.</p>

  <p>"Begging, eh? I saw you speak to those two gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"I asked them the time," said Luke.</p>

  <p>"I dare say," said the detective, tightening his lips. "Come a little walk
  with me." Ten minutes later a door closed on Luke Maddison, and he found
  himself alone in a clean but very uncomfortable cell of a police station. In
  this experience he was not entirely unfortunate, for Connor had been trailing
  him, hoping that he might go to some part of the park where persuasion,
  peaceful or otherwise, could be attempted.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch31"
     id="ch31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">No man wasted less time or effort than Gunner Haynes. His
  method represented the very economy of labour. He was satisfied that Connor
  had carried away his victim, but was wrong when he associated Danty Morell
  with the abduction.</p>

  <p>He called upon Connor, but was told vaguely that the man had gone into the
  country. He did not attempt to seek an interview with Danty Morell, but after
  a day spent in a vain search of Connor's wharf, made his way to Half Moon
  Street, watched the house until he saw first Danty and then Pi Coles leave.
  To get into Danty's flat was a very simple matter&mdash;a key-blank, a piece
  of lamp-black, a quarter of an hour spent in Green Park filing the soft
  metal, procured him an entrance.</p>

  <p>Once inside the flat, he proceeded at his leisure. He was not at all
  anxious at the thought of Danty's return. His hatred of Morell was in one
  sense illogical. They had been friends and partners, though he had lost sight
  of the man and the partnership had broken off. He had no direct proof of the
  duplicity he suspected. Gunner Haynes had loved that feather-headed little
  wife of his, and when she had disappeared, never to become more to him than a
  record in a workhouse register, a tremendous part of his life had been cut
  away from him. He might suspect Danty as the cause of his agony: he had no
  clear evidence that the story the man had told was untrue.</p>

  <p>Danty had said the girl had disappeared, and that he was as ignorant of
  her whereabouts as her husband. Yet, for all this, the suspicion in Gunner
  Haynes' mind amounted to a certainty. He was a just man, and so long as that
  proof were missing, Danty Morell would come to no harm.</p>

  <p>He made a quick but thorough examination of the two rooms. There were
  letters which had to be scanned, pocket-books to investigate, drawers to be
  opened and searched, but in none of these did Haynes find the slightest clue
  to Luke Maddison's present place of imprisonment. He did find the note which
  Connor had scribbled, giving the address where Luke was staying, but no more.
  There remained only the safe, which was not so much a safe as a steel
  cupboard fastened with a spring lock&mdash;the type that is found in most
  business offices. To open this was a matter of five minutes' patient
  work.</p>

  <p>There were four shelves, and each was crowded with letters, bills, and
  curious souvenirs which Danty had collected&mdash;the cupboard was in such
  disorder as only a man without method could create. On the third shelf he
  found a wooden box, the lock of which he forced. There were papers
  here&mdash;bundles of letters tied up with shoe-laces, bits of old
  string&mdash;there was nothing romantic in Danty's disposition.</p>

  <p>The first bundle did not interest him. At the sight of the writing on the
  second his face went grey. He brought the box into the dining-room and sat
  down, read three of the letters, glanced at the others, and very slowly and
  deliberately tied them up again and put them back in the box. As he did so he
  caught sight of a scrap of paper exactly the size of that on which Rex had
  written his last message. He took it out...yes, it was scrawled in the same
  handwriting. But the message was unintelligible. It ran: "Danty Morell. The
  man is a common swindler. I was warned against him by&mdash;" And then in a
  flash he realized. He had an extraordinary memory, and could repeat almost
  word for word the complete message as Rex had left it.</p>

  <p>"Margaret darling. I have lost. For months I have been gambling. Today I
  took a desperate step on the advice of Danty Morell. The man is a common
  swindler. I was warned against him by Luke Maddison. He has led me to ruin.
  Money is his god. I beg of you not to trust him. He has led me from one act
  of folly to the other..." That was it! Danty had found that the first and
  last of those scraps made a complete message; he had put the second in his
  pocket (it still bore marks of being screwed up).</p>

  <p>It took him quite a long time to realize all this. His mind was numbed
  from reading the letters; he was almost stupid in his horror and hate.
  Mechanically he put the tell-tale slip of paper into his pocket-book, closed
  the lid...His wife's letters must be burnt. He opened the box again, took
  them out, threw them into the fireplace and put a match to them. He stood
  watching and stirring them until they were black ashes, then he put the box
  back where he had found it and closed the steel cupboard.</p>

  <p>For the moment Luke Maddison and his safety were subsidiary
  considerations. The only thing that mattered was Danty. The agony and appeal
  in those letters! Gunner Haynes caught a glimpse of his face in a mirror over
  the mantelpiece and for a moment was shocked. He had become suddenly old.</p>

  <p>Danty did not return&mdash;he was glad. He turned out all the lights,
  closed the door behind him and went out into the street. He had hardly
  crossed to the other sidewalk before a cab drew up to the pavement and a man
  alighted. It was Danty. The gunman watched, but made no effort to intercept
  him. That would come later...there would be a great accounting.</p>

  <p>He strolled into Piccadilly, moving like a man in a dream, and heard his
  name spoken twice before he turned with a start to look into the pretty face
  of Mary Bolford.</p>

  <p>"I wondered if it was you," she said, "and if you were contemplating some
  nefarious act. Of course you're not!"</p>

  <p>The Gunner drew a long breath. "To tell you the truth, I was," he said
  gently. "I haven't had the good fortune to meet you in this last week, Miss
  Bolford."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I've been very busy. I've accepted a job on an
  Australian newspaper, and I'm leaving London next week." Her tone was jaunty,
  but he could detect a strain in the voice that was very flattering to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I've given you enough to write about," he said. "Enough material, I
  mean."</p>

  <p>She sighed.&mdash;"Yes." A little pause. "I shall miss you: I suppose if I
  told Mr Bird that he would be annoyed."</p>

  <p>"He'd be furious," said the Gunner, a slow smile displacing the pained
  look she had seen in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You won't come to Australia, of course, ever? I shall be there for seven
  years."</p>

  <p>"By what boat do you travel?" he asked, and, when she had told him:
  "There's another mail leaving a week or so after. Do you sail from
  London?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "They wanted me to pick up the boat at Naples&mdash;we call
  there; but I rather want the sea journey. I've got what is called a
  lung&mdash;not a bad one: that is why I have taken work in Australia." They
  had coffee together and in that flying time he thought neither of Luke
  Maddison nor of Danty Morell nor of the letters which were ash in the grate.
  When&mdash;he left her at eleven o'clock, he said: "If I can get my business
  through I may join your ship at Naples."</p>

  <p>She looked at him very gravely. "Do you really mean that?" she said. "And
  is Australia to be the scene of your next&mdash;?" She hesitated for a word,
  but he anticipated her.</p>

  <p>"I am going to be the rarest of phenomena&mdash;the reformed crook," he
  said.</p>

  <p>She sipped her coffee in silence. "Would anything help you to that end?"
  she asked, and Haynes nodded.</p>

  <p>He did not put into words the thought that was in his mind and hers, but
  she understood. It was then that he gave her his first confidence, and she
  listened open-eyed, stricken dumb with amazement, to the true story of Luke
  Maddison.</p>

  <p>"I've been searching for him all day," he said, "and I haven't even got a
  thread of a clue."</p>

  <p>"He isn't dead?"</p>

  <p>Haynes shook his head. "That is most unlikely," he said. "The trouble is
  that the police cannot be told. I suppose the press shouldn't be, either," he
  smiled, "but things are&mdash;different&mdash;now, aren't they?"</p>

  <p>"Have you got the little piece of paper you found in Morell's flat?" (He
  had omitted nothing from his narrative.) He passed it across the table to
  her. She read and nodded. "What was the rest of it?" He recited the full
  message almost word for word.</p>

  <p>"I have seen Rex&mdash;in fact, I know a great deal about him," she said.
  "Mr Bird was very confidential and told me about the forgery. I could have
  given him a lot of information, because I was standing in the doorway of the
  bank the day the forged cheque was cashed. It was the day Mr Maddison gave me
  a hundred pounds&mdash;I've still got it."</p>

  <p>They were talking of The Sparrow as they came out of the restaurant, and
  at the corner of Bury Street they met him. He looked disapprovingly at Gunner
  Haynes and frowned at the girl. "Getting a first-hand crime story? What's
  doing, Gunner? Are you giving evidence before the Select Commission?" he
  asked with a sneer.</p>

  <p>Gunner Haynes chuckled. There had been one of those periodical police
  scandals; somebody had been arrested who ought not to have been arrested, and
  there was the inevitable enquiry on foot into police methods.</p>

  <p>"We've got to go so carefully nowadays that I wouldn't arrest a man if I
  found him cutting his wife's throat, without making a few enquiries," said
  The Sparrow. "I'll tell you how bad it is: they've just turned a tramp out of
  a police station, charged with begging, but only one witness&mdash;a
  policeman. So they hoofed him out. When we've got to consider the feelings of
  tramps you might as well turn Scotland Yard into a home for lost dogs. I
  mention the tramp because I was down at the police station just after they
  pushed him out. I suppose it's happening all over London. You're going to
  Australia, they tell me, Miss Bolford?" His keen eyes searched the Gunner's
  face. "You're not going too, are you, Gunner? You'll miss those little
  tea-table talks, won't you?" Mary Bolford turned red. She had never dreamed
  that those unrehearsed and informal meetings with Gunner Haynes had attracted
  the attention of this stout man.</p>

  <p>"Both of you ought to be warned," said The Sparrow soberly, "and I'm
  warning you! There never was a crook who could be anything but a crook. There
  never was a girl who married a man to reform him who didn't finish by bolting
  with somebody better."</p>

  <p>"You're in your most prophetic mood tonight, Mr Bird," said the Gunner
  coolly. "Now tell us what's going to win the Derby?"</p>

  <p>The Sparrow grunted and went on with a little chuck of his head&mdash;a
  gesture of farewell. Haynes and the girl walked along Piccadilly till they
  came within sight of the Circus, and here they parted. As they lingered, he
  hand in his, he said: "You've saved a man's life tonight, Mary," and wisely
  she did not question him.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ch32"
     id="ch32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It came as something in the nature of a shock to Margaret
  Maddison to discover how completely changed were her feelings towards the man
  with whom she had passed through stages of toleration to liking, and from
  liking to a sort of passive affection, and from that again, in the
  cataclysmic revolution of feeling that her brother's death had brought about,
  to the bitterest loathing.</p>

  <p>For the first time in her life Margaret was in love, and in love with
  something which was neither a memory nor an idea, but something which was to
  her as real as her own hand. She had gained that sense of possession which is
  the wife's own sense, an understanding of her obligations. She could not
  afford to waste time in regrets at the amazing follies and wicked errors of
  the past: in the days that followed her mind was occupied with schemes for
  helping him out of the morass in which he struggled.</p>

  <p>She did not hear from Gunner Haynes, although she stayed up until nearly
  two o'clock the next morning, having the telephone switched through to her
  bedside. Nor did the next day bring news. She was out when Danty called, and,
  having no occasion to go to her cheque-book, she did not discover his
  theft.</p>

  <p>The following morning brought The Sparrow&mdash;professionally. "Did you
  give orders that none of your husband's cheques over a thousand pounds was to
  be cashed at the bank?" he asked. She nodded. "A young man brought in one for
  two thousand this morning. Very foolishly, Mr Steele didn't call me up, and
  he got away before I arrived."</p>

  <p>"Was it in Luke's handwriting?" she asked eagerly. "Where is he?"</p>

  <p>The Sparrow could not supply information. "I thought he was
  abroad&mdash;is it usual for your husband to send people to the bank with
  cheques to cash? It seems queer to me."</p>

  <p>"The money was not paid?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;Steele said if it had been for a thousand he'd have cashed it."
  She was purposely evasive, and after the detective had gone she telephoned
  through to Steele. He had little to add.</p>

  <p>"The man who brought the cheque seemed very respectable."</p>

  <p>"But did you ask him where he got the cheque?" she demanded impatiently.
  "Surely, Mr Steele, you weren't satisfied&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought that you expected him to send cheques," said Mr Steele.</p>

  <p>She never realized how dense a man this middle-aged manager was.</p>

  <p>After she had rung off she sat down to think. Luke had broken into his
  fiat to secure his passport and clothes. The passport was now in the Gunner's
  possession&mdash;she must see that he had a change in case he arrived
  unexpectedly. She went herself to his flat, made a careful collection, packed
  such toilet articles as she thought he might require, including a case of
  razors, and had them taken down to her car.</p>

  <p>It was the first wifely duty she had performed, and it brought her a
  pleasing sense of novelty. Even that faint pleasure brought to her a
  realization of the strain under which she was living, and the ever-increasing
  anxiety concerning Luke's fate.</p>

  <p>If she could have got into touch with Gunner Haynes she would have done
  so.</p>

  <p>She would almost have welcomed the arrival of Danty Morell. She had a
  reminder of his earlier visit when she went to her bureau to make out
  household cheques. She took out the wrong cheque-book and saw that some were
  missing. Putting through a call to the bank, she learned that the cheque
  presented that day was one of these.</p>

  <p>Then Danton Morell was in the conspiracy!</p>

  <p>Her first inclination was to send for Inspector Bird. But at all costs the
  police must not be called in. She turned the leaves of the telephone
  directory and searched for Danton's number, was on the point of calling him
  when she came to a decision to see him herself.</p>

  <p>She did not wait for her car, but, hailing a taxi, and leaving certain
  very definite instructions behind her, drove to Half Moon Street, and Pi
  Coles, who opened the door to her, stared in amazement at this unexpected
  vision.</p>

  <p>"Come in, miss," he said awkwardly. "The guv'nor's inside."</p>

  <p>Danton heard her voice and was coming across the hall to meet her before
  the door was closed. "This is an unexpected pleasure, Margaret," he said. "Is
  anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer until she was in his room. "Before I tell you why I've
  come," she said, "I think it is only fair that you should know that I have
  left instructions that unless I am back in my house in three quarters of an
  hour my butler will ring up Mr Bird and tell him where I have gone."</p>

  <p>He frowned at this. "What's the idea?" he asked harshly. "That's an
  extraordinary way to behave&mdash;why the dickens shouldn't you be back in
  three-quarters of an hour?"</p>

  <p>"Where are the remainder of those cheques that you stole from my
  cheque-book when you called the other day?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She saw his face go red. "I don't know what you mean," he said loudly. "I
  stole cheques? What nonsense you're talking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You came into my house and you were in my sitting-room long enough to
  extract ten cheques. One of them was brought to the bank today, made out in
  Luke's name and signed by him. On my instructions the cheque was not
  honoured."</p>

  <p>The colour left his face. "Not honoured..." he stammered, and in his
  embarrassment he betrayed his share of the guilt.</p>

  <p>"I'm less interested in the cheques than in my husband," she said quietly.
  "Where is he?"</p>

  <p>He strove vainly to recover his self-possession and forced a smile.
  "Really, my dear girl&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"You'll address me as Mrs Maddison, if you have to address me as
  anything," she said. "I want you to return those cheques; I want you also to
  tell me exactly where Luke is."</p>

  <p>"As far as I know, he's staying with a convicted thief named Haynes," the
  man answered roughly, and to his surprise she nodded.</p>

  <p>"I thought so, too. I went down to see him&mdash;but he had gone. I think
  Mr Haynes was surprised to find that he had gone, and I'm only now
  understanding that Luke did not go of his own free will. Then I thought he
  may have wandered out by himself in order to escape association with Mr
  Haynes. But the cheque explains a great deal. Where is Luke?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "I don't know."</p>

  <p>"In that case I am going to do what I was trying to avoid," she said. "I
  am going to the police, and I shall charge you with stealing the blank
  cheques, and leave it to Mr Bird to connect you with Luke's disappearance."
  She half-turned to the door, but he caught her by the arm.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, Margaret, consider what you're doing!" She saw he was
  really alarmed; his voice was tremulous, his whole air suggested panic.</p>

  <p>"I swear to you I don't know where Luke is&mdash;he was on a barge, where
  Connor was keeping him. The swine didn't tell me that Maddison had signed a
  cheque. All he told me was that he jumped into the river and got away or was
  drowned&mdash;I don't know which. That's the truth. I knew nothing about it
  till Connor had found him. I swear to you this is the truth!"</p>

  <p>"Where is Connor?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. He was here this morning, and told me about Luke getting
  away. That is all the information I have. I didn't believe him, and probably
  it's a lie he told me." He saw she was undecided and eagerly sought to turn
  her from her intention. He had no doubt that she meant what she had said.</p>

  <p>She did not know what to do. "Could you find Haynes for me?"</p>

  <p>"Find Haynes?" he almost shouted. "You don't imagine I would communicate
  with that fellow, do you? He's a dangerous man, Margaret&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mrs Maddison," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>"He's dangerous&mdash;you oughtn't to have any dealings with him." He did
  not attempt to deny the theft of the cheques.</p>

  <p>"You don't know where Mr Maddison is at all?"</p>

  <p>He accepted the corrected relationship without demur. "No, Mrs Maddison,
  I've no idea. Connor's been looking for him all night."</p>

  <p>When she returned home she found The Sparrow waiting for her on the
  doorstep. The sight of a large kit-bag at his feet surprised her, and when he
  carried it into the house and into the little study on the ground floor, she
  was to have a shock. She did not recognize the crumpled clothes he took from
  the bag.</p>

  <p>"These clothes were found in the possession of a river thief, who was
  trying to sell them this morning," he said. "He didn't know that your
  husband's name was stitched in the inside pocket."</p>

  <p>"My husband's name?" she gasped, turning pale. "Where did he get
  them?"</p>

  <p>"That's what I want to know. The yarn he tells is that last night he
  picked up a man who was wet through and who had come out of the river, and
  took him to a house. We've since verified that, though from the description
  I've had it couldn't possibly be Mr Maddison, who is still abroad, I
  presume?" Was there a note of sarcasm in his voice? She thought she detected
  it, and very wisely did not answer.</p>

  <p>"The man said the clothes were given to him, but that, of course, is the
  usual yarn. I have reason to believe that they were stolen whilst the owner
  was in bed. Can you throw any light upon them?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. It was a pitiable confession, but she knew she could
  not even recognize an old suit of clothes worn by her husband. It was the
  suit into which he had changed when he broke into his flat.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of that, Mrs Maddison?" She shook her head helplessly.
  "It couldn't be a suit your husband gave away, because the date it was
  delivered is written on the tab, and it must have been new a month ago."</p>

  <p>He looked at her keenly. "There's a lot of mystery about this husband of
  yours, Mrs Maddison, and I think you're in some kind of trouble. I'd like to
  help you if I could." She was going to speak, but he held up his hand to stop
  her. "Don't tell me anything until I have told you just how much I know." He
  ticked off the facts on the fingers of his hand. "I know your husband
  disappeared the day after your marriage. I know that there was a burglary at
  his flat, and that when the police arrived they recognized the man who had
  been concerned in a robbery that afternoon. I know that amongst the things
  stolen from his flat was a passport&mdash;I interviewed his servant
  subsequently, and he told me there was a passport in one of the drawers of
  the desk. Now, if there were any chance&mdash;and it seems one of those
  fantastic theories that writers make a lot of money from&mdash;that this man
  is Mr Maddison, the best people to help him are the police. I know him well
  enough to be sure he wouldn't hold up Taffanny's. If it's a question of
  impersonation&mdash;we can be more than useful. Won't you tell me, Mrs
  Maddison?"</p>

  <p>She was silent. With a shake of his head the detective took his departure,
  carrying with him the suit of clothes and a deep-seated conviction.</p>

  <p>It was a curious coincidence that he should have brought those crumpled
  garments to the house, when, neatly packed away in a new suitcase in her
  bedroom, was the change of garments she had arranged for Luke. She was
  puzzled as to the arrangements she could make that would be most convenient.
  She decided ultimately upon leaving the suitcase at a railway cloakroom. The
  ticket could be sent to Luke as soon as he was discovered. She waited for
  night to come to carry this plan into effect.</p>

  <p>The night brought its problems for Danty Morell. That afternoon, after
  Margaret Maddison had left him, he made a discovery which turned him sick
  with apprehension. He had lost his hold on Margaret; at any moment she might
  go to the police, and just then he was most anxious not to renew acquaintance
  with Scotland Yard. Things had gone badly with him; he owed a very large sum
  of money which had to be paid in the City on the following day; and now, with
  the added possibility of police intervention, his position was perilous.</p>

  <p>Danton Morell was in some ways a careful man. However extravagant he might
  be, he had reserved for himself a fat nest-egg in cash which, in spite of all
  temptation, he had never touched. He had collected the money that day from
  two or three accounts which he ran in an assumed name. Nothing was needed now
  but to follow the line of retreat he had planned. There was a small aerodrome
  on the outskirts of London, from which exhibition flights were given. Danty
  had found it expedient to finance the small company which owned the
  airplanes, and by telephone he arranged his flight. This was facilitated by
  the fact that the company had recently acquired a big rebuilt monoplane which
  was capable of a long flight. Danty, who had decided upon Switzerland for his
  first hop, gave orders for the storage of petrol and necessities for the
  journey. He certainly did not anticipate taking a companion with him, but he
  was not the only panic-stricken man in London.</p>

  <p>Danty made a very quick search for papers which, left behind, might have
  awkward consequences, and his first attention was directed to the little box
  in which he kept the most dangerous of his correspondence. He brought this
  into the dining room before he discovered that the lock had been forced. With
  an exclamation he threw up the lid, shook out the contents...The one packet
  of letters that he had been mad to keep was gone! And the little telephone
  slip, that also had disappeared.</p>

  <p>His hands were shaking so that he could hardly hold the papers he was
  examining.</p>

  <p>There was no need to speculate upon the identity of the man who had forced
  that box. The Gunner had been seen in the neighbourhood: Pi Coles had told
  him that, and it had been the Gunner who had made this search and found the
  documents.</p>

  <p>Danty Morell saw death grinning at him; was hypnotized into sheer
  inaction; and, when there came a knock at the outer door, he leaped up from
  his chair, a shivering wreck of a man, not daring to open to the visitor. He
  calmed himself sufficiently to go to the door and demand who was there, and
  when he heard Connor's voice he could have cried aloud for joy.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" asked Connor, when they were back in the
  room.</p>

  <p>"I've had a bit of a shock, and I'm not particularly well. You know
  they're after those kites?"</p>

  <p>Connor himself was not particularly happy-looking. "I know. They've
  stopped a cheque I sent to the bank, and half the busies in London are
  looking for him. They know who it is, too&mdash;that's the worst of it.
  You're in this, Danty."</p>

  <p>"We're both in it, aren't we?" snarled the other. "I'm getting out of
  London tonight."</p>

  <p>Connor laughed raucously. "You've got a fine chance of getting out of
  London, unless you take a rattler." And then, suddenly: "How are you going?"
  It was on the tip of Danty's tongue to invent a method of escape, but just
  now he needed the association of Connor. Connor was not above using a gun at
  a pinch, and, moreover, hated Gunner Haynes.</p>

  <p>"I'm going by aeroplane from Elford," he said. "We've got the Gunner to
  thank for this. He squeaked."</p>

  <p>"He's never stopped squeaking," said Connor without heat. "Where do you
  land in your flying machine?" Danty told him his destination. "That'll do for
  me," said Connor. He looked at the papers on the table.</p>

  <p>"Having a burn up?" he asked pleasantly. And then: "How much stuff have
  you got?" Here Danty lied. He could not tell the truth about money.</p>

  <p>The conference was a brief one. They agreed to visit the aerodrome that
  evening and make final preparations for their journey. The journey through
  the suburbs into Outer London was a silent one; now and again Danty lifted
  the flap at the back of the hired car in which they were travelling, and
  peered along the darkening road.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" growled Connor.</p>

  <p>"There's a car, a two-seater, following us."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't it?" demanded the other sarcastically. "Do you want the
  road to yourself?" A few minutes later, when Danty looked back, the little
  car had disappeared.</p>

  <p>The preparations for the night's journey were not easily made. The pilot
  had only just been communicated with. He was on a holiday in the
  Midlands.</p>

  <p>"It's a good job we came, or we might have been in Queer Street." said
  Connor as they were driving back. "What time did you say you'd be here?"</p>

  <p>"About midnight."</p>

  <p>"What are you looking for?" asked Connor ten minutes later. "The little
  car?" He pushed his companion aside and peered.</p>

  <p>"There's a motor lorry; has that got anything on us?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Danty said nothing. No man could know the terror that was in his heart.
  Behind him stalked the grim shadow of vengeance, and every second he expected
  to see the hawk-like face of the Gunner peering into his from the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>Danty did not go near his flat. He telephoned to Pi Coles and they met in
  the park, Pi bringing with him an overcoat and wrap which were to be Danty's
  sole luggage. His servitor he rewarded liberally. There was nothing to do now
  but to pass the few hours which intervened before he left England for
  ever.</p>

  <p>He telephoned to the hangar and learned to his satisfaction that the pilot
  had arrived. He would have liked to advance the hour of his departure, but he
  knew that for once he must keep faith&mdash;Connor was a dangerous man, and
  he had no desire to let two enemies grow in the place of one.</p>

  <p>Once or twice, as he loafed about the less frequented streets of Pimlico,
  he had the impression that he was being shadowed; but when once he walked
  back in desperate boldness to interview the man who was following him, he
  found it was a perfectly inoffensive stranger to the neighbourhood who was
  trying to find a street and a number.</p>

  <p>He had work to do&mdash;vengeful work&mdash;and he completed this in a
  teashop near Vauxhall Bridge. Making a wide detour, he reached the central
  post office and handed in the telegram addressed to Inspector Bird. It ran:
  "The man who was concerned in the Taffanny robbery was Luke Maddison. He is
  attempting to leave London tonight. His wife and Gunner Haynes are aware of
  the double life he has been living." He signed it with his own name.</p>

  <p>Late as was the hour, he knew that the telegram would be delivered. He
  went back to meet his companion in misfortune, feeling more cheerful than he
  had felt all day.</p>

     id="ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was nearly eleven o'clock that night when Margaret had
  the car brought to the door and Luke's suitcase deposited. Her intention was
  to drive the car to the lower part of Villiers Street and send the chauffeur
  with the suitcase to the cloakroom. She came into the south end of the
  Strand, and the car had some difficulty in making its way through the
  returning theatre traffic, but after a long wait it turned down the steep
  street towards the Embankment, and at a signal from Margaret the chauffeur
  stopped the machine.</p>

  <p>It was raining heavily; there were few pedestrians in sight, and those
  were hurrying to reach the shelter of the underground station. She pulled at
  the catch of the door to open it, that the chauffeur might more easily take
  the suitcase at her feet, when, out of the shadows, came a shabby-looking
  figure. He must have seen her difficulty, for he turned the handle and pulled
  open the door before the chauffeur could descend.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Margaret, and handed him the piece of silver she had
  ready to pay for the luggage-room attendant. As she did so she switched on
  the light. For a second she stared into the unshaven face and the grimy
  figure. "Luke!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>He was stricken dumb with amazement, was unable to speak or move.</p>

  <p>"Luke!" she said again. Then, as he shrank back, her hand shot out and
  gripped him by the coat. "Come in, for God's sake!" she said breathlessly,
  and half-dragged him to her side.</p>

  <p>At that moment the chauffeur arrived.</p>

  <p>"Drive on," she said hurriedly. "This is a&mdash;a friend of mine." She
  only hoped that the man could not see the scarecrow who was seated at her
  side.</p>

  <p>"Where shall I go, madam?"</p>

  <p>"To&mdash;to the house," she said.</p>

  <p>As the chauffeur climbed back into his seat, a third figure appeared. He
  came running down the street like a man pursued, and, gripping the handle of
  the door, leaped on to the running-board as the car moved. She thought at
  first it was a policeman, but then passing a street lamp revealed the dark
  face of Gunner Haynes.</p>

  <p>"Don't make a fuss," he said, as he blundered in, slamming the door behind
  him.</p>

  <p>"I've chased your car from the Haymarket. Who's this?" He peered forward
  and she heard him whistle. "Is that Mr Maddison?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, It's me," said Luke, speaking for the first time.</p>

  <p>His voice sounded pitiably weak. He had been turned out of the police
  station in the early part of the afternoon, and had not eaten since the
  morning. He made no attempt to explain his need, was too tired and weary to
  care very much. The soft luxury of the padded seats dulled him into lethargy:
  he was nodding almost before the car reached the Embankment.</p>

  <p>"All right, don't wake him," said Gunner Haynes in a low voice. "He was
  arrested this morning; I've only just found out&mdash;one of my friends told
  me. The police are looking for him. Somebody sent a wire to The
  Sparrow&mdash;I suspect it was friend Danty."</p>

  <p>"Where are you taking him?"</p>

  <p>"Home," she said. She was wrapping a rug about the chilled figure in the
  corner of the car.</p>

  <p>"You'll have a policeman waiting on the mat. No, you'll take him to
  Elford. What's this?" He kicked against the suitcase and she explained, and
  heard him chuckle.</p>

  <p>"You must be a thought-reader. That's the very thing he'll
  require&mdash;not tonight perhaps, but in the morning. We're going to Elford.
  Do you know it? It's three quarters of an hour's run, and if we're lucky
  we'll reach there before two of the biggest rats that ever climbed out of
  Thames mud." She leaned out of the window and gave directions to the
  chauffeur.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't we drive on to Dover and get on board the boat?" she asked
  urgently.</p>

  <p>Gunner Haynes shook his head. "No, that won't work. The Sparrow's a good
  fellow, but he'd shop his own mother. And if, as I believe, Mr Morell, or
  whatever his present name is, has blown&mdash;has told the story of
  Taffanny's, every boat will be watched. Besides, there isn't one till
  daylight that we could possibly catch. There's only one chance, and that is
  for Mr Maddison to appear in Spain, where he is supposed to be. I think that
  can be worked&mdash;unless Mr Danty Morell has got too far ahead of us." He
  peered forward again. "You've got a fur coat on&mdash;that's good. You can
  lend it to your husband. It'll look rather silly, but nobody will see
  him."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm going an airplane ride tonight, and he's going with me," he said. "As
  for you, Mrs Maddison, your work is very simple. You'll return to London;
  you'll lie a little&mdash;I hope it won't hurt you very much&mdash;and leave
  for Spain tomorrow. If I can't get him there after I've landed him in France,
  I'm a Dutchman."</p>

  <p>There was a silence, and then: "I know a better way," she said quietly. "I
  can go with him." To her surprise, the Gunner did not combat that
  suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're wise," was his comment.</p>

  <p>They came at last to a dark and bumpy road, and here the car was stopped
  by the Gunner's instructions. He got down and pointed into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Pull your car over there and shut off all your lights," he said, and,
  when this was done and, with great trouble, the car had been manoeuvred over
  the rough ground and the engine had been shut off, he came back to the girl.
  "We're here first," he said. "I'm banking on Danty being
  cautious&mdash;look!" Lights were coming along the road from the direction of
  London. It was a car, which stopped a hundred yards away, and then after a
  while turned round.</p>

  <p>"They're walking the rest of the journey," murmured the Gunner with grim
  satisfaction. "Wait here." He walked back to the entrance of the untidy
  little aerodrome and slipped something from his pocket. He had not long to
  wait: Danty and Connor turned out of the road again.</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Higgins?" asked Danty. "Is the pilot here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Everybody's here including me," said the Gunner. "Don't try any funny
  business, Connor: I've got you covered, and there's a silencer on my gun.
  You'll hear no more than a 'plop' and you'll be in hell!" Danty said nothing.
  Haynes could almost hear him shivering with fear.</p>

  <p>"Well, what next?" asked Connor.</p>

  <p>"The next is a long walk back to the nearest town, unless you've had the
  intelligence to keep your car. If you're clever you'll run&mdash;I'm afraid
  you haven't a chance," he added, as he saw the red tail-light of the car
  moving rapidly away. "The police are controlling this aerodrome, and you've a
  snowflake's chance of getting away."</p>

  <p>"You're being a friendly little fellow and helping us: is that what you're
  telling us to believe?" sneered Connor.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk&mdash;walk," said the Gunner sternly. "I'm not in my best
  temper tonight. I've practically promised I wouldn't kill you, but it won't
  take a hell of a lot to make me change my mind."</p>

  <p>"All right, Gunner, we'll go." Danty found his quaking voice. "Come on,
  Connor. The Gunner wouldn't put us in bad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I found the letters, Danty," said Haynes softly. "You know just how near
  you are to eternal rest, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Danty said nothing: he grabbed the arm of his reluctant friend and almost
  dragged him back to the roadway. They walked back rapidly the way they had
  come, and must have gone a hundred yards before Connor stopped.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to stand for this bird&mdash;" he began, when a voice
  behind him said: "Walk!" and he obeyed.</p>

  <p>When he had seen them well on their way, the Gunner sped back to the
  car.</p>

  <p>Luke was awake; they were talking together in a low tone, he and this
  strange bride of his, and Gunner Haynes thought it delicate to leave them and
  interview the pilot.</p>

  <p>He found the machine waiting, with two weary mechanics and an impatient
  pilot, and to the latter he gave new instructions. The other argument he
  employed was a very effective one, for the airman agreed cheerfully to all
  conditions.</p>

  <p>"I can carry three or ten," he said. "There'll be no difficulty about
  getting up. I've done this night trip hundreds of times."</p>

  <p>Satisfied on this score, Gunner Haynes went back to the car and
  interrupted the more than usually intimate conversation, "I've a little scrap
  of paper to give you when it's light enough to read it, Mrs Maddison. It
  concerns the death of your brother&mdash;I'm sorry to be so brutal, but I
  think you ought to know that the man who ruined him was Danty,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I guessed that," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>It was still drizzling and the clouds were low, but neither of the three
  passengers evinced the slightest anxiety as, with a roar of engines, the big
  monoplane swept into the darkness, up and up, through the thick mist of
  clouds, until they emerged with the moon riding in a clear sky above them and
  billowing white clouds beneath.</p>

  <p>Less than a week later, three people dined at the Cafe Ritz, in Madrid,
  and the dinner was in the nature of a farewell banquet to Gunner Haynes, who
  was going to Naples to join the Australian mail-boat.</p>

  <p>"I shan't be comfortable till I get on board the Barcelona express," he
  said. "I've done many things in my life, but this is the first time I've
  played third to a honeymoon couple."</p>
