<h2>1 - CORASMIN AND THE PARROTS</h2>
<p>One says Mexico: one means, after all, one little town away South in the
Republic: and in this little town, one rather crumbly adobe house built round
two sides of a garden <i>patio</i>: and of this house, one spot on the deep,
shady veranda facing inwards to the trees, where there are an onyx table and
three rocking-chairs and one little wooden chair, a pot with carnations, and a
person with a pen. We talk so grandly, in capital letters, about Morning in
Mexico. All it amounts to is one little individual looking at a bit of sky and
trees, then looking down at the page of his exercise book.</p>
<p>It is a pity we don't always remember this. When books come out with grand
titles, like <i>The Future of America</i>, or <i>The European Situation</i>,
it's a pity we don't immediately visualize a thin or a fat person, in a chair
or in bed, dictating to a bob-haired stenographer or making little marks on
paper with a fountain pen.</p>
<p>Still, it is morning, and it is Mexico. The sun shines. But then, during the
winter, it always shines. It is pleasant to sit out of doors and write, just
fresh enough and just warm enough. But then it is Christmas next week, so it
ought to be just right.</p>
<p>There is a little smell of carnations, because they are the nearest thing.
And there is a resinous smell of ocote wood, and a smell of coffee, and a faint
smell of leaves, and of Morning, and even of Mexico. Because when all is said
and done, Mexico has a faint, physical scent of her own, as each human being
has. And this is a curious, inexplicable scent, in which there are resin and
perspiration and sunburned earth and urine among other things.</p>
<p>And cocks are still crowing. The little mill where the natives have their
own corn ground is puffing rather languidly. And because some women are talking
in the entrance-way, the two tame parrots in the trees have started to
whistle.</p>
<p>The parrots, even when I don't listen to them, have an extraordinary effect
on me. They make my diaphragm convulse with little laughs, almost mechanically.
They are a quite commonplace pair of green birds, with bits of bluey red, and
round, disillusioned eyes, and heavy, overhanging noses. But they listen
intently. And they reproduce. The pair whistle now like Rosalino, who is
sweeping the <i>patio</i> with a twig broom; and yet it is so unlike him, to be
whistling full vent, when any of us is around, that one looks at him to see.
And the moment one sees him, with his black head bent rather drooping and
hidden as he sweeps, one laughs.</p>
<p>The parrots whistle exactly like Rosalino, only a little more so. And this
little-more-so is extremely sardonically funny. With their sad old long-jowled
faces and their flat disillusioned eyes, they reproduce Rosalino and a
little-more-so without moving a muscle. And Rosalino, sweeping the <i>patio</i>
with his twig broom, scraping and tittering leaves into little heaps, covers
himself more and more with the cloud of his own obscurity. He doesn't rebel. He
is powerless. Up goes the wild, sliding Indian whistle into the morning, very
powerful, with an immense energy seeming to drive behind it. And always, always
a little more than life-like.</p>
<p>Then they break off into a cackling chatter, and one knows they are shifting
their clumsy legs, perhaps hanging on with their beaks and clutching with their
cold, slow claws, to climb to a higher bough, like rather raggedy green buds
climbing to the sun. And suddenly the penetrating, demonish mocking voices:</p>
<p>'Perro! Oh, Perro! Perr-rro! Oh, Perr-rro! Perro!'</p>
<p>They are imitating somebody calling the dog. <i>Perro</i> means dog. But
that any creature should be able to pour such a suave, prussic-acid sarcasm
over the voice of a human being calling a dog, is incredible. One's diaphragm
chuckles involuntarily. And one thinks: <i>Is it possible</i>? Is it possible
that we are so absolutely, so innocently, so <i>ab ovo</i> ridiculous?</p>
<p>And not only is it possible, it is patent. We cover our heads in
confusion.</p>
<p>Now they are yapping like a dog: exactly like Corasmin. Corasmin is a little
fat, curly white dog who was lying in the sun a minute ago, and has now come
into the veranda shade, walking with slow resignation, to lie against the wall
near-by my chair. 'Yap-yap-yap! Wouf! Wouf! Yapyapyapyap!' go the parrots,
exactly like Corasmin when some stranger comes into the <i>zagu&aacute;n</i>,
Corasmin and a little-more-so.</p>
<p>With a grin on my face I look down at Corasmin. And with a silent, abashed
resignation in his yellow eyes, Corasmin looks up at me, with a touch of
reproach. His little white nose is sharp, and under his eyes there are dark
marks, as under the eyes of one who has known much trouble. All day he does
nothing but walk resignedly out of the sun, when the sun gets too hot, and out
of the shade, when the shade gets too cool. And bite ineffectually in the
region of his fleas.</p>
<p>Poor old Corasmin: he is only about six, but resigned, unspeakably resigned.
Only not humble. He does not kiss the rod. He rises in spirit above it, letting
his body lie.</p>
<p>'Perro! Oh, Perr-rro! Perr-rro! Perr-rr-rro!!' shriek the parrots, with that
strange penetrating, antediluvian malevolence that seems to make even the trees
prick their ears. It is a sound that penetrates one straight at the diaphragm,
belonging to the ages before brains were invented. And Corasmin pushes his
sharp little nose into his bushy tail, closes his eyes because I am grinning,
feigns to sleep and then, in an orgasm of self-consciousness, starts up to bite
in the region of his fleas.</p>
<p>'Perr-rro! Perr-rro!' And then a restrained, withheld sort of yapping. The
fiendish rolling of the Spanish 'r', malevolence rippling out of all the
vanished spiteful aeons. And following it, the small, little-curly-dog sort of
yapping. They can make their voices so devilishly small and futile, like a
little curly dog. And follow it up with that ringing malevolence that swoops up
the ladders of the sunbeams right to the stars, rolling the Spanish 'r'.</p>
<p>Corasmin slowly walks away from the veranda, his head drooped, and flings
himself down in the sun. No! He gets up again, in an agony of self-control, and
scratches the earth loose a little, to soften his lie. Then flings himself down
again.</p>
<p>Invictus! The still-unconquered Corasmin! The sad little white curly
pendulum oscillating ever slower between the shadow and the sun.</p>
<p>In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud, Under
the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed.</p>
<p>But that is human bombast, and a little too ridiculous even for Corasmin.
Poor old Corasmin's clear yellow eyes! He is going to be master of his own
soul, under all the vitriol those parrots pour over him. But he's not going to
throw out his chest in a real lust of self-pity. That belongs to the next cycle
of evolution.</p>
<p>I wait for the day when the parrots will start throwing English at us, in
the pit of our stomachs. They cock their heads and listen to our gabble. But so
far they haven't got it. It puzzles them. Castilian, and Corasmin, and Rosalino
come more natural.</p>
<p>Myself, I don't believe in evolution, like a long string hooked on to a
First Cause, and being slowly twisted in unbroken continuity through the ages.
I prefer to believe in what the Aztecs called Suns: that is, Worlds
successively created and destroyed. The sun itself convulses, and the worlds go
out like so many candles when somebody coughs in the middle of them. Then
subtly, mysteriously, the sun convulses again, and a new set of worlds begins
to flicker alight.</p>
<p>This pleases my fancy better than the long and weary twisting of the rope of
Time and Evolution, hitched on to the revolving hook of a First Cause. I like
to think of the whole show going bust, <i>bang!</i>--and nothing but bits of
chaos flying about. Then out of the dark, new little twinklings reviving from
nowhere, nohow.</p>
<p>I like to think of the world going pop! when the lizards had grown too
unwieldy, and it was time they were taken down a peg or two. Then the little
humming birds beginning to spark in the darkness, and a whole succession of
birds shaking themselves clean of the dark matrix, flamingoes rising upon one
leg like dawn commencing, parrots shrieking about at midday, <i>almost</i> able
to talk, then peacocks unfolding at evening like the night with stars. And
apart from these little pure birds, a lot of unwieldy skinny-necked monsters
bigger than crocodiles, barging through the mosses; till it was time to put a
stop to them. When someone mysteriously touched the button, and the sun went
bang, with smithereens of birds bursting in all directions. On a few parrots'
eggs and peacocks' eggs and eggs of flamingoes smuggling in some safe nook, to
hatch on the next Day, when the animals arose.</p>
<p>Up reared the elephant, and shook the mud off his back. The birds watched
him in sheer stupefaction. What? <i>What in heaven's name is this wingless,
beakless old perambulator</i>?</p>
<p>No good, oh birds! Curly, little white Corasmin ran yapping out of the
undergrowth, the new undergrowth, till parrots, going white at the gills, flew
off into the ancientest recesses. Then the terrific neighing of the wild horse
was heard in the twilight for the first time, and the bellowing of lions
through the night.</p>
<p>And the birds were sad. What is this? they said. A whole vast gamut of new
noises. A universe of new voices.</p>
<p>Then the birds under the leaves hung their heads and were dumb. No good our
making a sound, they said. We are superseded.</p>
<p>The great big, booming, half-naked birds were blown to smithereens. Only the
real little feathery individuals hatched out again and remained. This was a
consolation. The larks and warblers cheered up, and began to say their little
say, out of the old 'Sun', to the new sun. But the peacock, and the turkey, and
the raven, and the parrot above all, they could not get over it. Because, in
the old days of the Sun of Birds, they had been the big guns. The parrot had
been the old boss of the flock. He was so clever.</p>
<p>Now he was, so to speak, up a tree. Nor dare he come down, because of the
toddling little curly white Corasmin, and such-like, down below. He felt
absolutely bitter. That wingless, beakless, featherless, curly, misshapen
bird's nest of a Corasmin had usurped the face of the earth, waddling about,
whereas his Grace, the heavy-nosed old Duke of a parrot, was forced to sit out
of reach up a tree, dispossessed.</p>
<p>So, like the riff-raff up in the gallery at the theatre, aloft in the
Paradiso of the vanished Sun, he began to whistle and jeer. <i>'Yap-yap!'</i>
said his new little lordship of a Corasmin. 'Ye Gods!' cried the parrot. 'Hear
him forsooth! <i>Yap-yap!</i> he says! Could anything be more imbecile?
Yap-yap! Oh, Sun of the Birds, hark at that! <i>Yap-yap-yap!</i> Perro!
<i>Perro! Perr-rro!</i> Oh, <i>Perr-rr-rro!</i>'</p>
<p>The parrot had found his cue. Stiff-nosed, heavy-nosed old duke of the
birds, he wasn't going to give in and sing a new song, like those fool brown
thrushes and nightingales. Let, them twitter and warble. The parrot was a
gentleman of the old school. He was going to jeer now! Like an ineffectual old
aristocrat.</p>
<p>'<i>Oh, Perr-rro! Perr-rro-o-o-!</i>'</p>
<p>The Aztecs say there have been four Suns and ours is the fifth. The first
Sun, a tiger, or a jaguar, a night-spotted monster of rage, rose out of nowhere
and swallowed it, with all its huge, mercifully forgotten insects along with
it. The second Sun blew up in a great wind: that was when the big lizards must
have collapsed. The third Sun burst in water, and drowned all the animals that
were considered unnecessary, together with the first attempts at animal
men.</p>
<p>Out of the floods rose our own Sun, and little naked man. 'Hello!' said the
old elephant. 'What's that noise?' And he pricked his ears, listening to a new
voice on the face of the earth. The sound of man, and <i>words</i> for the
first time. Terrible, unheard-of sound. The elephant dropped his tail and ran
into the deep jungle, and there stood looking down his nose.</p>
<p>But little white curly Corasmin was fascinated. '<i>Come on! Perro!
Perro!</i>' called the naked two-legged one. And Corasmin, fascinated, said to
himself: 'Can't stand out against that name. Shall have to go!' so off he
trotted, at the heels of the naked one. Then came the horse, then the elephant,
spell-bound at being given a name. The other animals ran for their lives and
stood quaking.</p>
<p>In the dust, however, the snake, the oldest dethroned king of all, bit his
tail once more and said to himself: '<i>Here's another! No end to these new
lords of creation! But I'll bruise his heel! Just as I swallow the eggs of the
parrot, and lick to the little Corasmin pups.</i>'</p>
<p>And in the branches, the parrot said to himself: <i>'Hello! What's this new
sort of half-bird? Why, he's got Corasmin trotting at his heels! Must be a new
sort of boss! Let's listen to him, and see if I can't take him off.'</i></p>
<p>Perr-rro! Perr-rr-rro-oo! Oh, Perro!</p>
<p>The parrot had hit it.</p>
<p>And the monkey, cleverest of creatures, cried with rage when he heard men
speaking. <i>'Oh, why couldn't I do it!'</i> he chattered. But no good, he
belonged to the old Sun. So he sat and gibbered across the invisible gulf in
time, which is the 'other dimension' that clever people gas about: calling it
'fourth dimension', as if you could measure it with a foot-rule, the same as
the obedient other three dimensions.</p>
<p>If you come to think of it, when you look at the monkey, you are looking
straight into the other dimension. He's got length and breadth and height all
right, and he's in the same universe of Space and Time as you are. But there's
another dimension. He's different, There's no rope of evolution linking him to
you, like a navel string. No! Between you and him there's a cataclysm and
another dimension. It's no good. You can't link him up. Never will. It's the
other dimension.</p>
<p>He mocks at you and gibes at you and imitates you.</p>
<p>Sometimes he is even more <i>like</i> you than you are yourself. It's funny,
and you laugh just a bit on wrong your face. It's the other dimension.</p>
<p>He stands in one Sun, you in another. He whisks his tail in one Day, you
scratch your head in another. He jeers at you, and is afraid of you. You laugh
at him and are frightened of him.</p>
<p>What's the length and the breadth, what's the height and the depths between
you and me? says monkey.</p>
<p>You get out a tape-measure, and he flies into an obscene mockery of you.</p>
<p>It's the other dimension, put the tape-measure away, it won't serve.</p>
<p>'Perro! Oh, Perr-rro!' shrieks the parrot.</p>
<p>Corasmin looks up at me, as much as to say:</p>
<p>'It's the other dimension. There's no help for it. Let us agree about
it.'</p>
<p>And I look down into his yellow eyes, and say:</p>
<p>'You're quite right, Corasmin, it's the other dimension. You and I, we admit
it. But the parrot won't, and the monkey won't, and the crocodile won't,
neither the earwig. They all wind themselves up and wriggle inside the cage of
the other dimension, hating it. And those that have voices jeer, and those that
have mouths bite, and the insects that haven't even mouths, they turn up their
tails and nip with them, or sting, Just behaving according to their own
dimension: which, for me, is the other dimension.'</p>
<p>And Corasmin wags his tail mildly, and looks at me with real wisdom in his
eyes. He and I, we understand each other in the wisdom of the other
dimension.</p>
<p>But the flat, saucer-eyed parrot won't have it. Just won't have it.</p>
<p>'Oh, Perro! Perr-rro! Perr-rro-o-o-o! Yap-yap-yap!'</p>
<p>And Rosalino, the Indian <i>mozo</i>, looks up at me with his eyes veiled by
their own blackness. We won't have it either: he is hiding and repudiating.
Between us also is the gulf of the other dimension, and he wants to bridge it
with the foot-rule of the three-dimensional space. He knows it can't be done.
So do I. Each of us knows the other knows.</p>
<p>But he can imitate me, even more than life-like. As the parrot can him. And
I have to laugh at his <i>me</i>, a bit on the wrong side of my face, as he has
to grin on the wrong side of his face when I catch his eye as the parrot is
whistling <i>him</i>, With a grin, with a laugh we pay tribute to the other
dimension. But Corasmin is wiser. In his clear, yellow eyes is the
self-possession of full admission.</p>
<p>The Aztecs said this world, our Sun, would blow up from inside, in
earthquakes. Then what will come, in the other dimension, when we are
superseded?</p>

<h2>2 - WALK TO HUAYAPA</h2>
<p>Curious is the psychology of Sunday. Humanity enjoying itself is on the
whole a dreary spectacle, and holidays are more disheartening than drudgery.
One makes up one's mind: On Sundays and on <i>fiestas</i> I will stay at home,
in the hermitage of the <i>patio</i>, with the parrots and Corasmin and the
reddening coffee-berries. I will avoid the sight of people enjoying
themselves'--or try to, without much success.</p>
<p>Then comes Sunday morning, with the peculiar looseness of its sunshine. And
even if you keep mum, the better-half says: Let's go somewhere.</p>
<p>But, thank God, in Mexico at least one can't set off in the 'machine'. It is
a question of a meagre horse and a wooden saddle; on a donkey; or what we
called, as children, 'Shanks' pony'--the shanks referring discourteously to
one's own legs.</p>
<p>We will go out of the town. Rosalino, we are going for a walk to San Felipe
de las Aguas. Do you want to go, and carry the basket?'</p>
<p><i>'C&oacute;mo no, Se&ntilde;or?'</i></p>
<p>It is Rosalino's inevitable answer, as inevitable as the parrot's 'Perro?'
'<i>Cone no, Se&ntilde;or?</i>'--'How not, Se&ntilde;or?'</p>
<p>The <i>Norte</i>, the north-wind, was blowing last night, rattling the
worm-chewed window-frames.</p>
<p>'Rosalino, I am afraid you will be cold in the night.'</p>
<p>'<i>C&oacute;mo no, Se&ntilde;or?</i>'</p>
<p>'Would you like a blanket?'</p>
<p>'<i>C&oacute;mo no, Se&ntilde;or?</i>'</p>
<p>'With this you will be warm?'</p>
<p>'<i>C&oacute;mo no, Se&ntilde;or?</i>'</p>
<p>But the morning is perfect; in a moment we are clear out of the town. Most
towns in Mexico, saving the capital, end in themselves, at once. As if they had
been lowered from heaven in a napkin, and deposited, rather foreign, upon the
wild plain. So we walk round the wall of the church and the huge old monastery
enclosure that is now barracks for the scrap-heap soldiery, and at once there
are the hills.</p>
<p>'I will lift up my eyes unto the hills, whence cometh my strength.' At least
one can always do <i>that</i>, in Mexico. In a stride, the town passes away.
Before us lies the gleaming, pinkish-ochre of the valley flat, wild and exalted
with sunshine. On the left, quite near, bank the stiffly pleated mountains, all
the foot-hills, that press savannah-coloured into the savannah of the valley.
The mountains are clothed smokily with pine, <i>ocote</i>, and, like a woman in
a gauze <i>rebozo</i>, they rear in a rich blue fume that is almost
cornflower-blue in the clefts. It is their characteristic that they are darkest
blue at the top. Like some splendid lizard with a wavering, royal-blue crest
down the ridge of his back, and pale belly, and soft, pinky-fawn claws, no the
plain.</p>
<p>Between the pallor of the claws, a dark spot of trees, and white dots of a
church with twin towers. Further away, along the foot-hills, a few scattered
trees, white dot and stroke of .a hacienda, and a green, green square of
sugar-cane. Further off still, at the mouth of a cleft of a canyon, a dense
little green patch of trees, and two spots of proud church.</p>
<p>'Rosalino, which is San Felipe?'</p>
<p>'<i>Quien sabe, Se&ntilde;or?</i>' says Rosalino, looking at the villages;
beyond the sun of the savannah with black, visionless eyes. In his voice is the
inevitable flat resonance of aloofness, touched with resignation, as if to say:
It is not becoming to a man to know these things.--Among the Indians it is not
becoming to know anything, not even one's own name.</p>
<p>Rosalino is a mountain boy, an Indian from a village two days' walk away.
But he has been two years in the little city, and has learnt his modicum of
Spanish.</p>
<p>'Have you never been to any of these villages?'</p>
<p>'No, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, I never went.'</p>
<p>'Didn't you want to?'</p>
<p>'<i>C&oacute;mo no, Se&ntilde;or?</i>'</p>
<p>The Americans would call him a dumb-bell.</p>
<p>We decide for the farthest speck of a village in a dark spot of trees. It
lies so magical, alone, tilted in the fawn-pink slope, again as if the
dark-green napkin with a few white tiny buildings had been lowered from heaven
and left, there at the foot of the mountains, with the deep groove of a canyon
slanting in behind. So alone and, as it were, detached from the world in which
it lies, a spot.</p>
<p>Nowhere more than in Mexico does human life become isolated, external to its
surroundings, and cut off tinily from the environment. Even as you come across
the plain to a big city like Guadalajara, and see the twin towers of the
cathedral peering around in loneliness like two lost birds side by side on a
moor, lifting their white heads to look around in the wilderness, your heart
gives a clutch, feeling the pathos, the isolated tininess of human effort. As
for building a church with one tower only, it is unthinkable. There must be two
towers, to keep each other company in this wilderness world.</p>
<p>The morning is still early, the brilliant sun does not burn too much.
Tomorrow is the shortest day. The savannah valley is shadeless, spotted only
with the thorny ravel of mesquite bushes. Down the trail that has worn grooves
in the turf--the rock is near the surface--occasional donkeys with a
blue-hooded woman perched on top come tripping in silence, twinkling, a shadow.
Just occasional women taking a few vegetables to market. Practically no men. It
is Sunday.</p>
<p>Rosalino, prancing behind with the basket, plucks up his courage to speak to
one of the women passing on a donkey. 'Is that San Felipe where we are
going?'--'No, that is not San Felipe.'--'What, then, is it called?'--'It is
called Huayapa.'--'Which, then, is San Felipe?'--That one'--and she points to
her right.</p>
<p>They have spoken to each other in half-audible, crushed tones, as they
always do, the woman on the donkey and the woman with her on foot swerving away
from the basket-carrying Rosalino. They all swerve away from us, as if we were
potential bold brigands. It really gets one's pecker up. The presence of the
<i>Se&ntilde;ora</i> only half reassures them. For the <i>Se&ntilde;ora</i>, in
a plain hat of bluey-green woven grass, and a dress of white cotton with black
squares on it, is almost a monster of unusualness. <i>Prophet art thou, bird,
or devil?</i> the women seem to say, as they look at her with keen black eyes.
I think they choose to decide she is more of the last.</p>
<p>The women look at the woman, the men look at the man. And always with that
same suspicious, inquiring, wondering look, the same with which Edgar Allan Poe
must have looked at his momentous raven:</p>
<p>'<i>Prophet art thou, bird, or devil?</i>'</p>
<p><i>Devil, then, to please you!</i> one longs to answer, in a tone of
<i>Nevermore</i>.</p>
<p>Ten o'clock, and the sun getting hot. Not a spot of shade, apparently, from
here to Huayapa. The blue getting thinner on the mountains, and an
indiscernible vagueness, of too much light, descending on the plain.</p>
<p>The road suddenly dips into a little crack, where runs a creek. This again
is characteristic of these parts of America. Water keeps out of sight. Even the
biggest rivers, even the tiny brooks. You look across a plain on which the
light sinks down, and you think: Dry! Dry! Absolutely dry! You travel along,
and suddenly come to a crack in the earth, and a little stream is running in a
little walled-in valley bed, where is a half-yard of green turf, and bushes,
the <i>palo-blanco</i> with leaves, and with big white flowers like pure white,
crumpled cambric. Or you may come to a river a thousand feet below, sheer below
you. But not in this valley. Only the stream.</p>
<p>'Shade!' says the <i>Se&ntilde;ora</i>, subsiding under a steep bank.</p>
<p>'<i>Mucho calor!</i>' says Rosalino, taking off his extra-jaunty straw hat,
and subsiding with the basket.</p>
<p>Down the slope are coming two women on donkeys. Seeing the terrible array of
three people sitting under a bank, they pull up.</p>
<p>'<i>Adios!</i>' I say, with firm resonance.</p>
<p>'<i>Adios!</i>' says the <i>Se&ntilde;ora</i>, with diffidence.</p>
<p>'<i>Adios!</i>' says the reticent Rosalino, his voice the shadow of
ours.</p>
<p>'<i>Adios! Adios! Adios!</i>' say the women, in suppressed voices, swerving,
neutral, past us on their self-contained, sway-eared asses.</p>
<p>When they have passed, Rosalino looks at me to see if I shall laugh. I give
a little grin, and he gives me back a great explosive grin, throwing back his
head in silence, opening his wide mouth and showing his soft pink tongue,
looking along his cheeks with his saurian black eyes, in an access of
<i>farouche</i> derision.</p>
<p>A great hawk, like an eagle, with white bars at the end of its wings, sweeps
low over us, looking for snakes. One can hear the hiss of its pinions.</p>
<p>'<i>Gabil&aacute;n</i>,' says Rosalino.</p>
<p>'What is it called in the <i>idioma</i>?'</p>
<p>'<i>Psia!</i>'--He makes the consonants explode and hiss.</p>
<p>'Ah!' says the <i>Se&ntilde;ora</i>. 'One hears it in the wings.
<i>Psia</i>!'</p>
<p>'Yes,' says Rosalino, with black eyes of incomprehension.</p>
<p>Down the creek, two native boys, little herdsmen, are bathing, stooping with
knees together and throwing water over themselves, rising, gleaming dark
coffee-red in the sun, wetly. They are very dark, and their wet heads are so
black, they seem to give off a bluish light, like dark electricity.</p>
<p>The great cattle they are tending slowly plunge through the bushes, coming
up-stream. At the place where the path fords the stream, a great ox stoops to
drink. Comes a cow after him, and a calf, and a young bull. They all drink a
little at the stream, their noses delicately touching the water. And then the
young bull, horns abranch, stares fixedly, with some f the same Indian
wonder-and-suspicion stare, at us sitting under the bank.</p>
<p>Up jumps the <i>Se&ntilde;ora</i>, proceeds uphill, trying to save her
dignity. The bull, slowly leaning into motion, moves across-stream like a ship
unmoored. The bathing lad on the bank is hastily fastening his calico
pantaloons round his ruddy-dark waist. The Indians have a certain rich
physique, even this lad. He comes running short-step down the bank, uttering a
birdlike whoop, his dark hair gleaming bluish. Stooping for a moment to select
a stone, he runs athwart the hull, and aims the stone sideways at him. There is
a thud, the ponderous, adventurous young animal swerves docilely round towards
the stream. '<i>Becerro!</i>' cries the boy, in his bird-like, piping tone,
selecting a stone to throw at the calf.</p>
<p>We proceed in the blazing sun up the slope. There is a white line at the
foot of the trees. It looks like water running white over a weir. The supply of
the town water comes this way. Perhaps this is a reservoir. A sheet of water I
How lovely it would be, in this country, if there was a sheet of water with a
stream running out of it! And those dense trees of Huayapa behind.</p>
<p>'What is that white, Rosalino? Is it water?'</p>
<p>'<i>El Blanco? Si, aqua, Se&ntilde;ora</i>,' says that dumb-bell.</p>
<p>Probably, if the <i>Se&ntilde;ora</i> had said: Is it milk? he would have
replied in exactly the same way: <i>Si es leche, Se&ntilde;ora!</i>--Yes, it's
milk.</p>
<p>Hot, silent, walking only amidst a weight of light, out of which one hardly
sees, we climb the spurs towards the dark trees. And as we draw nearer, the
white slowly resolves into a broken, whitewashed wall.</p>
<p>'Oh!' exclaims the <i>Se&ntilde;ora</i>, in real disappointment. 'It isn't
water! it's a wall!'</p>
<p>'<i>Si, Se&ntilde;ora. Es pante&oacute;n.</i>' (They call a cemetery a
<i>pante&oacute;n</i>, down here.)</p>
<p>'It is a cemetery,' announces Rosalino, with a certain ponderous, pleased
assurance, and without afterthought. But when I suddenly laugh at the
absurdity, he also gives a sudden broken yelp of laughter.--They laugh as if it
were against their will, as if it hurt them, giving themselves away.</p>
<p>It was nearing midday. At last we got into a shady lane, in which were
puddles of escaped irrigation-water. The ragged semi-squalor of a half-tropical
lane, with naked trees sprouting into spiky scarlet flowers, and bushes with
biggish yellow flowers, sitting rather wearily on their stems, led to the
village.</p>
<p>We were entering Huayapa. <i>Ia Calle de las Minas</i>, said an old notice.
<i>Ia Calle de las Minas</i>, said a new, brand-new notice, as if in
confirmation. <i>First Street of the Mines</i>. And every street had the same
old and brand-new notice: 1st Street of the Magnolia: 4th Street of Enriquez
Gonzalez: very fine!</p>
<p>But the First Street of the Mines was just a track between the stiff living
fence of organ cactus, with poinsettia trees holding up scarlet mops of
flowers, and mango trees, tall and black, stonily drooping the strings of
unripe fruit. The Street of the Magnolia was a rocky stream-gutter,
disappearing to nowhere from nowhere, between cactus and bushes. The Street of
the Vasquez was a stony stream-bed, emerging out of tall, wildly tall
reeds.</p>
<p>Not a soul anywhere. Through the fences, half deserted gardens of trees and
banana plants, each enclosure with a half-hidden hut of black adobe bricks
crowned with a few old tiles for a roof, and perhaps a new wing made of twigs.
Everything hidden, secret, silent. A sense of darkness among the silent mango
trees, a sense of lurking, of unwillingness. Then actually some half-bold curs
barking at us across the stile of one garden, a forked bough over which one
must step to enter the chicken-bitten enclosure. And actually a man crossing
the proudly labelled: Fifth Street of the Independence.</p>
<p>If there were no churches to mark a point in these villages, there would be
nowhere at all to make for. The sense of nowhere is intense, between the dumb
and repellent living fence of cactus. But the Spaniards, in the midst of these
black, mud-brick huts, have inevitably reared the white twin-towered
magnificence of a big and lonely, hopeless church; and where there is a church
there will be a <i>plaza</i>. And a <i>plaza</i> is a <i>z&oacute;calo</i>, a
hub. Even though the wheel does not go round, a hub is still a hub. Like the
old Forum.</p>
<p>So we stray diffidently on, in the maze of streets which are only straight
tracks between cactuses, till we see Reforma, and at the end of <i>Reforma</i>,
the great church.</p>
<p>In front of the church is a rocky <i>plaza</i> leaking with grass, with
water rushing into two big, oblong stone basins. The great church stands rather
ragged, in a dense forlornness, for all the world like some big white human
being, in rags, held captive in a world of ants.</p>
<p>On the uphill side of the <i>plaza</i>, a long low white building with a
shed in front, and under the shed crowding, all the short-statured men of the
<i>pueblo</i>, in their white cotton clothes and big hats. They are listening
to something: but the silence is heavy, furtive, secretive. They stir like
white-clad insects.</p>
<p>Rosalino looks sideways at them, and sheers away. Even we lower our voices
to ask what is going on. Rosalino replies, <i>sotto voce</i>, that they are
making <i>asuntos</i>. But what business? we insist. The dark faces of the
little men under the big hats look round at us suspiciously, like dark gaps in
the atmosphere. Our alien presence in this vacuous village, is like the sound
of a drum in a churchyard. Rosalino mumbles unintelligibly. We stray across the
forlorn yard into the church.</p>
<p>Thursday was the day of the Virgin of the Soledad, so the church is littered
with flowers, sprays of wild yellow flowers trailing on the floor. There is a
great Gulliver's Travels fresco picture of an angel having a joy-ride on the
back of a Goliath. On the left, near the altar steps, is seated a life-size
Christ--undersized; seated upon a little table, wearing a pair of woman's
frilled knickers, a little mantle of purple silk dangling from His back, and
His face bent forward gazing fatuously at His naked knee, which emerges from
the needlework frill of the drawers. Across from Him a living woman is
half-hidden behind a buttress, mending something, sewing.</p>
<p>We sit silent, motionless, in the whitewashed church ornamented with royal
blue and bits of gilt. A barefoot Indian with a high-domed head comes in and
kneels with his legs close together, his back stiff, at once very humble and
resistant. His cotton jacket and trousers are long-unwashed rag, the colour of
dry earth, and torn, so that one sees smooth pieces of brown thigh, and brown
back. He kneels in a sort of intense fervour for a minute, then gets up and
childishly, almost idiotically, begins to take the pieces of candle from the
candlesticks. He is the Verger.</p>
<p>Outside, the gang of men is still pressing under the shed. We insist on
knowing what is going on. Rosalino, looking sideways at them, plucks up courage
to say plainly that the two men at the table are canvassing for votes: for the
Government, for the State, for a new governor, whatever it may be. Votes!
Votes! Votes! The farce of it! Already on the wall of the low building, on
which one sees, in blue letters, the word <i>Justizia</i>, there are pasted the
late political posters, with the loud announcement: Vote For This Mark (+). Or
another: Vote For This Mark (-).</p>
<p>My dear fellow, this is when democracy becomes real fun. You vote for one
red ring inside another red ring and you get a Julio Echegaray. You vote for a
blue dot inside a blue ring, and you get a Socrate Ezequiel Tos. Heaven knows
what you get for the two little red circles on top of one another Suppose we
vote, and try. There's all sorts in the lucky bag. There might come a name like
Peregrino Zenon Cocotilla.</p>
<p>Independence I Government by the People, of the People, for the People! We
all live in the Calle de la Reforma, in Mexico.</p>
<p>On the bottom of the <i>plaza</i> is a shop. We want some fruit. '<i>Hay
frutas?</i> Oranges or bananas?'--'<i>No, Se&ntilde;or</i>.'--'No
fruits?'--'<i>No hay</i>!'--'Can I buy a cup?'--'<i>No hay</i>.'--'Can I buy a
<i>jicara</i>, a gourd-shell that we might drink from?' '<i>No hay</i>.'.</p>
<p><i>No hay</i> means <i>there isn't any</i>, and it's the most regular sound
made by the dumb-bells of the land.</p>
<p>'What is there, then?' A sickly grin. There are, as a matter of fact,
candles, soap, dead and withered chiles, a few dried grasshoppers, dust, and
stark, bare wooden pigeon-holes. Nothing, nothing, nothing. Next-door is
another little hole of a shop. <i>Hay frutas?--No hay.--Qu&eacute; hay?--Hay
tepache!</i></p>
<p>'<i>Para borracharse</i>,' says Rosalino, with a great grin.</p>
<p><i>Tepache</i> is a fermented drink of pineapple rinds and brown sugar: to
get drunk on, as Rosalino says. But mildly drunk. There is probably
<i>mescal</i> too, to get brutally drunk on.</p>
<p>The village is exhausted in resource. But we insist on fruit. Where,
<i>where</i> can I buy oranges and bananas? I see oranges on the trees, I see
banana plants.</p>
<p>'Up there!' The woman waves with her hand as if she were cutting the air
upwards.</p>
<p>'That way?'</p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p>We go up the Street of Independence. They have got rid of us from the
<i>plaza</i>.</p>
<p>Another black hut with a yard, and orange-trees beyond.</p>
<p>'<i>Hay frutas?</i>'</p>
<p>'<i>No hay.</i>'</p>
<p>'Not an orange, nor a banana?'</p>
<p>'<i>No hay.</i>'</p>
<p>We go on. <i>She</i> has got rid of us. We descend the black rocky steps to
the stream, and up the other side, past the high reeds. There is a yard with
heaps of maize in a shed, and tethered bullocks: and a bare-bosom, black-browed
girl.</p>
<p>'<i>Hay frutas?</i>'</p>
<p>'<i>No hay.</i>'</p>
<p>'But Yes I There are oranges--there!'</p>
<p>She turns and looks at the oranges on the trees at the back, and imbecilely
answers:</p>
<p>'<i>No hay.</i>'</p>
<p>It is a choice between killing her and hurrying away.</p>
<p>We hear a drum and a whistle. It is down a rocky black track that calls
itself The Street of Benito Juarez: the same old gent who stands for all this
obvious Reform, and Vote for (o).</p>
<p>A yard with shade round. Women kneading the maize dough, <i>masa</i>, for
<i>tortillas</i>. A man lounging. And a little boy beating a kettledrum
sideways, and a big man playing a little reedy wooden whistle, rapidly,
endlessly, disguising the tune of <i>La Cucuracha</i>. They won't play a tune
unless they can render it almost unrecognizable.</p>
<p>'<i>Hay frutas?</i>'</p>
<p>'<i>No hay.</i>'</p>
<p>'Then what is happening here?'</p>
<p>A sheepish look, and no answer.</p>
<p>'Why are you playing music?'</p>
<p>'It is a <i>fiesta</i>.'</p>
<p>My God, a feast! That weary <i>masa</i>, a millstone in the belly. And for
the rest, the blank, heavy, dark-grey barrenness, like an adobe brick. The
drum-boy rolls his big Indian eyes at us, and beats on, though filled with
consternation. The flute man glances, is half appalled and half resentful, so
he blows harder. The lounging man comes and mutters to Rosalino, and Rosalino
mutters back, four words.</p>
<p>Four words in the <i>idioma</i>, the Zapotec language. We retire, pushed
silently away.</p>
<p>'What language do they speak here, Rosalino?'</p>
<p>'<i>The idioma.</i>'</p>
<p>'You understand them? It is Zapoteca, same as your language ?'</p>
<p>'Yes, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>.'</p>
<p>'Then why do you always speak in Spanish to them?'</p>
<p>'Because they don't speak the <i>idioma</i> of my village.'</p>
<p>He means, presumably, that there are dialect differences. Anyhow, he asserts
his bit of Spanish, and says <i>Hay frutas</i>?</p>
<p>It was like a <i>posada</i>. It was like the Holy Virgin on Christmas Eve,
wandering from door to door looking for a lodging in which to bear her child:
Is there a room here? <i>No hay</i>!</p>
<p>The same with us. <i>Hay frutas? No hay!</i> We went down every straight
ant-run of that blessed village. But at last we pinned a good-natured woman.
'Now tell us, <i>where</i> can we buy oranges? We see them on the trees. We
want them to eat.</p>
<p>'Go,' she said, to Valentino Ruiz. He has oranges. Yes, he has oranges, and
he sells them.' And she cut the air upwards with her hand.</p>
<p>From black hut to black hut went we, till at last we got to the house of
Valentino Ruiz. And to I it was the yard with the <i>fiesta</i>. The lounging
man was peeping out of the gateless gateway, as we came, at us.</p>
<p>It is the same place!' cried Rosalino, with a laugh of bashful agony.</p>
<p>But we don't belong to the ruling race for nothing. Into the yard we
march.</p>
<p>'Is this the house of Valentino Ruiz? <i>Hay naranjas</i>? Are there
oranges?'</p>
<p>We had wandered so long, and asked so often, that the <i>masa</i> was made
into <i>tortillas</i>, the <i>tortillas</i> were baked, and a group of people
were sitting in a ring on the ground, eating them. It was the
<i>fiesta</i>.</p>
<p>At my question up jumped a youngish man, and a woman as if they had been
sitting on a scorpion each.</p>
<p>'Oh, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>,' said the woman, there are few oranges, and they
are not ripe, as the <i>Se&ntilde;or</i> would want them. But pass this
way.'</p>
<p>We pass up to the garden, past the pink roses, to a little orange-tree, with
a few yellowish-green oranges.</p>
<p>You see; they are not ripe as you will want them,' says the youngish
man.</p>
<p>'They will do.' Tropical oranges are always green. These, we found later,
were almost insipidly sweet.</p>
<p>Even then, I can only get three of the big, thick-skinned, greenish oranges.
But I spy sweet limes, and insist on having five or six of these.</p>
<p>He charges me three cents apiece for the oranges: the market price is two
for five cents: and one cent each for the <i>limas</i>.</p>
<p>'In my village,' mutters Rosalino when we get away, 'oranges are five for
one cent.'</p>
<p>Never mind! It is one o'clock. Let us get out of the village, where the
water will be safe, and eat lunch.</p>
<p>In the <i>plaza</i>, the men are just dispersing, one gang coming down the
hill. They watch us as if we were a coyote, a <i>zopilote</i>, and a white
she-bear walking together in the street.</p>
<p>'<i>Adios!</i>'</p>
<p>'<i>Adios!</i>' comes the low roll of reply, like a roll of cannon shot.</p>
<p>The water rushes downhill in a stone gutter beside the road. We climb up the
hill, up the Street of the Camomile, alongside the rushing water. At one point
it crosses the road unchannelled, and we wade through it. It is the village
drinking supply.</p>
<p>At the juncture of the roads, where the water crosses, another silent white
gang of men. Again: <i>Adios!</i> and again the low, musical, deep volley of
<i>Adios!</i></p>
<p>Up, up wearily. We must get above the village to be able to drink the water
without developing typhoid.</p>
<p>At last, the last house, the naked hills. We follow the water across a dry
maize-field, then up along a bank. Below is a quite deep gully. Across is an
orchard, and some women with baskets of fruit.</p>
<p>'<i>Hay frutas?</i>' calls Rosalino, in a half-voice. He is getting
bold.</p>
<p>'<i>Hay</i>,' says an old woman, in the curious half-voice. 'But not
ripe.'</p>
<p>Shall we go clown into the gully into the shade? No; someone is bathing
among the reeds below, and the aqueduct water rushes along in the gutter here
above. On, on, till we spy a wild guava tree over the channel of water. At last
we can sit down and eat and drink, on a bank of dry grass, under the wild guava
tree.</p>
<p>We put the bottle of lemonade in the aqueduct to cool. I scoop out a big
half-orange, the thick rind of which makes a cup.</p>
<p>'Look, Rosalino! The cup!'</p>
<p>'<i>La taza!</i>' he cries, soft-tongued, with a bark of laughter and
delight.</p>
<p>And one drinks the soft, rather lifeless, warmish Mexican water. But it is
pure.</p>
<p>Over the brink of the water-channel is the gully, and a noise--chock, chock!
I go to look. It is a woman, naked to the hips, standing washing her other
garments upon a stone. She has a beautiful full back, of a deep orange colour,
and her wet hair is divided and piled. In the water a few yards up-stream two
men are sitting naked, their brown-orange giving off a glow in the shadow, also
washing their clothes. Their wet hair seems to steam blue-blackness. Just above
them is a sort of bridge, where the water divides, the channel-water taken from
the little river, and led along the top of the bank.</p>
<p>We sit under the wild guava tree in silence, and eat. The old woman of the
fruit, with naked breast and coffee-brown naked arms, her under-garment
fastened on one shoulder, round her waist an old striped <i>sarape</i> for a
skirt, and on her head a blue <i>rebozo</i> piled against the sun, comes
marching down the aqueduct with black bare feet, holding three or four
<i>chirimoyas</i> to her bosom. <i>Chirimoyas</i> are green custard-apples.</p>
<p>She lectures us, in slow, heavy Spanish:</p>
<p>'This water, here, is for drinking. The other, below, is for washing. This,
you drink, and you don't wash in it. The other, you wash in, and you don't
drink it.' And she looked inquisitively at the bottle of lemonade, cooling.</p>
<p>'Very good. We understand.'</p>
<p>Then she gave us the <i>chirimoyas</i>. I asked her to change the
<i>peso</i>: I had no change.</p>
<p>'No, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>,' she said. 'No, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>. You don't pay
me. I bring you these, and may you eat well. But the <i>chirimoyas</i> are not
ripe: in two or three days they will be ripe. Now, they are not. In two or
three days they will be. Now, they are not.</p>
<p>You can't eat them yet. But I make a gift of them to you, and may you eat
well. Farewell. Remain with God.'</p>
<p>She marched impatiently off along the aqueduct.</p>
<p>Rosalino waited to catch my eye. Then he opened his mouth and showed his
pink tongue and swelled out his throat like a cobra, in a silent laugh after
the old woman.</p>
<p>'But,' he said in a low tone, 'the <i>chirimoyas</i> are not good ones.'</p>
<p>And again he swelled in the silent, delighted, derisive laugh.</p>
<p>He was right. When we carne to eat them, three days later, the
custard-apples all had worms in them, and hardly any white meat.</p>
<p>'The old woman of Huayapa,' said Rosalino, reminiscent.</p>
<p>However, she had got her bottle. When we had drunk the lemonade, we sent
Rosalino to give her the empty wine-bottle, and she made him another
sententious little speech. But to her the bottle was a treasure.</p>
<p>And I, going round the little hummock behind the wild guava tree to throw
away the papers of the picnic, came upon a golden-brown young man with his
shirt just coming down over his head, but over no more of him. Hastily
retreating, I thought again what beautiful, suave, rich skins these people
have; a sort of richness of the flesh. It goes, perhaps, with the complete
absence of what we call 'spirit'.</p>
<p>We lay still for a time, looking at the tiny guavas and the perfect, soft,
high blue sky overhead, where the hawks and the ragged-winged <i>zopilotes</i>
sway and diminish. A long, hot way home. But <i>ma&ntilde;ana es otro dia</i>.
Tomorrow is another day. And even the next five minutes are far enough away, in
Mexico, on a Sunday afternoon.</p>

<h2>3 - THE MOZO</h2>
<p>Rosalino really goes with the house, though he has been in service here only
two months. When we went to look at the place, we saw him lurking in the
<i>patio</i>, and glancing furtively under his brows. He is not one of the
erect, bantam little Indians that stare with a black, incomprehensible, but
somewhat defiant stare. It may be Rosalino has a distant strain of other Indian
blood, not Zapotec. Or it may be he is only a bit different. The difference
lies in a certain sensitiveness and aloneness, as if he were a mother's boy.
The way he drops his head and looks sideways under his black lashes,
apprehensive, apprehending, feeling his way, as it were. Not the bold male
glare of most of the Indians, who seem as if they had never, never had mothers
at all.</p>
<p>The Aztec gods and goddesses are, as far as we have known anything about
them, an unlovely and unlovable lot. In their myths there is no grace or charm,
no poetry. Only this perpetual grudge, grudge, grudging, one god grudging
another, the gods grudging men their existence, and men grudging the animals.
The goddess of love is a goddess of dirt and prostitution, a dirt-eater, a
horror, without a touch of tenderness. If the god wants to make love to her,
she has to sprawl down in front of him, blatant and accessible.</p>
<p>And then, after all, when she conceives and brings forth, what is it she
produces? What is the infant-god she tenderly bears? Guess, all ye people,
joyful and triumphant!</p>
<p>You never could.</p>
<p>It is a stone knife.</p>
<p>It is a razor-edged knife of blackish-green flint, the knife of all knives,
the veritable Paraclete of knives. It is the sacrificial knife with which the
priest makes a gash in his victim's breast, before he tears out the heart, to
hold it smoking to the sun.</p>
<p>And the Sun, the Sun behind the sun, is supposed to suck the smoking heart
greedily with insatiable appetite.</p>
<p>This, then, is a pretty Christmas Eve. Lo, the goddess is gone to bed, to
bring forth her child. Lo! ye people, await the birth of the saviour, the wife
of a god is about to become a mother.</p>
<p><i>Tarumm-tarah! Tarumm-tarah!</i> blow the trumpets. The child is born.
Unto us a son is given. Bring him forth, lay him on a tender cushion. Show him,
then, to all the people. See! See! See him upon the cushion, tenderly new-born
and reposing! Ah, <i>qu&eacute; bonito!</i> Oh, what a nice, blackish, smooth,
keen stone knife!</p>
<p>And to this day, most of the Mexican Indian women seem to bring forth stone
knives. Look at them, these sons of incomprehensible mothers, with their black
eyes like flints, and their stiff little bodies as taut and as keen as knives
of obsidian. Take care they don't rip you up.</p>
<p>Our Rosalino is an exception. He drops his shoulders just a little. He is a
bit bigger, also, than the average Indian down here. He must be about five feet
four inches. And he hasn't got the big, obsidian, glaring eyes. His eyes are
smaller, blacker, like the quick black eyes of the lizard. They don't look at
one with the obsidian stare. They are just a bit aware that there is another
being, unknown, at the other end of the glance. Hence he drops his head with a
little apprehension, screening himself as if he were vulnerable.</p>
<p>Usually, these people have no correspondence with one at all. To them a
white man or white woman is a sort of phenomenon; just as a monkey is a sort of
phenomenon; something to watch, and wonder at, and laugh at, but not to be
taken on one's own plane.</p>
<p>Now the white man is a sort of extraordinary white monkey that, by cunning,
has learnt lots of semi-magical secrets of the universe, and made himself boss
of the show. Imagine a race of big white monkeys got up in fantastic clothes,
and able to kill a man by hissing at him; able to leap through the air in great
hops, covering a mile in each leap; able to transmit his thoughts by a moment's
effort of concentration to some great white monkey or monkeyess, a thousand
miles away: and you have, from our point of view, something of the picture that
the Indian has of us.</p>
<p>The white monkey has curious tricks. He knows, for example, the time. Now to
a Mexican, and an Indian, time is a vague, foggy reality. There are only three
times: <i>en la ma&ntilde;ana, en la tarde, en la troche</i>, in the morning,
in the afternoon, in the night. There is even no midday, and no evening.</p>
<p>But to the white monkey, horrible to relate, there are exact spots of time,
such as five o'clock, half past nine. The day is a horrible puzzle of exact
spots of time.</p>
<p>The same with distance: horrible invisible distances called two miles, ten
miles. To the Indians, there is near and far, and very near and very far. There
is two days or one day. But two miles are as good as twenty to him, for he goes
entirely by his feeling. If a certain two miles feels far to him, then it
<i>is</i> far, it is <i>muy lejos</i>! But if a certain twenty miles
<i>feels</i> near and familiar, then it is not far. Oh, no, it is just a little
distance. And he will let you set off in the evening, for night to overtake you
in the wilderness, without a qualm. It is not far.</p>
<p>But the white man has a horrible, truly horrible, monkey-like passion for
invisible exactitudes. <i>Ma&ntilde;ana</i>, to the native, may mean tomorrow,
three days hence, six months hence, and never. There are no fixed points in
life, save birth, and death, and the <i>fiestas</i>. The fixed points of birth
and death evaporate spontaneously into vagueness. And the priests fix the
<i>fiestas</i>. From time immemorial priests have fixed the <i>fiestas</i>, the
festivals of the gods, and men have had no more to do with time. What should
men have to do with time?</p>
<p>The same with money. These <i>centavos</i> and these <i>pesos</i>, what do
they mean, after all? Little discs that have no charm. The natives insist on
reckoning in invisible coins, coins that don't exist here, like <i>reales</i>
or <i>pesetas</i>. If you buy two eggs for a <i>real</i>, you have to pay
twelve and a half <i>centavos</i>. Since also half a <i>centavo</i> doesn't
exist, you or the vendor forfeit the non-existent.</p>
<p>The same with honesty, the <i>meum</i> and the <i>tuum</i>. The white man
has a horrible way of remembering, even to a <i>centavo</i>, even to a
thimbleful of <i>mescal</i>. Horrible! The Indian, it seems to me, is not
naturally dishonest. He is not naturally avaricious, has not even any innate
cupidity. In this he is unlike the old people of the Mediterranean, to whom
possessions have a mystic meaning, and a silver coin a mystic white halo, a
<i>lueur</i> of magic.</p>
<p>To the real Mexican, no! He doesn't care. He doesn't even <i>like</i>
keeping money. His deep instinct is to spend it at once, so that he needn't
have it. He doesn't really want to keep anything, not even his wife and
children. Nothing that he has to be responsible for. Strip, strip, strip away
the past and the future, leave the naked moment of the present disentangled.
Strip away memory, strip away forethought and care; leave the moment, stark and
sharp and without consciousness, like the obsidian knife. The before and the
after are the stuff of consciousness. The instant moment is for ever keen with
a razor-edge of oblivion, like the knife of sacrifice.</p>
<p>But the great white monkey has got hold of the keys of the world, and the
black-eyed Mexican has to serve the great white monkey, in order to live. He
has to learn the tricks of the white monkey-show: time of the day, coin of
money, machines that start at a second, work that is meaningless and yet is
paid for with exactitude, in exact coin. A whole existence of monkey-tricks and
monkey-virtues. The strange monkey-virtue of charity, the white monkeys nosing
round to <i>help</i>, to <i>save!</i> Could any trick be more unnatural? Yet it
is one of the tricks of the great white monkey.</p>
<p>If an Indian is poor, he says to another: I have no food; give me to eat.
Then the other hands the hungry one a couple of <i>tortillas</i>. That is
natural. But when the white monkey comes round, they peer at the house, at the
woman, at the children. They say: Your child is sick. <i>Si, Se&ntilde;or</i>.
What have you done for it--<i>Nothing. What is to be done?</i>--You must make a
poultice. I will show you how.</p>
<p>Well, it was very amusing, this making hot dough to dab on the baby. Like
plastering a house with mud. But why do it twice? Twice is not amusing. The
child will die. Well, then, it will be in Paradise. How nice for it! That's
just what God wants of it, that it shall be a cheerful little angel among the
roses of Paradise. What could be better?</p>
<p>How tedious of the white monkey coming with the trick of salvation, to rub
oil on the baby, and put poultices on it, and make you give it medicine in a
spoon at morning, noon, and night. Why morning and noon and night? Why not just
anytime, anywhen? It will die tomorrow if you don't do these things today! But
tomorrow is another day, and it is not dead now, so if it dies at another time,
it must be because the other times are out of hand.</p>
<p>Oh, the tedious, exacting white monkeys, with their yesterdays and todays
and tomorrows! Tomorrow is always another day, and yesterday is part of the
encircling never. Why think outside the moment? And inside the moment one does
not think. So why pretend to think? It is one of the white-monkey-tricks. He is
a clever monkey. But he is ugly, and he has nasty, white flesh. We are not
ugly, with screwed-up faces, and we have good warm-brown flesh. If we have to
work for the white monkey, we don't care. His tricks are half-amusing. And one
may as well amuse oneself that way as any other. So long as one is amused.</p>
<p>So long as the devil does not rouse in us, seeing the white monkeys for ever
mechanically bossing, with their incessant tick-tack of work. Seeing them get
the work out of us, the sweat, the money, and then taking the very land from
us, the very oil and metal out of our soil.</p>
<p>They do it! They do it all the time. Because they can't help it. Because
grasshoppers can but hop, and ants can carry little sticks, and white monkeys
can go tick-tack, tick-tack, do this, do that, time to work, time to eat, time
to drink, time to sleep, time to walk, time to ride, time to wash, time to look
dirty, tick-tack, tick-tack, time, time, time! time! Oh, cut off his nose and
make him swallow it.</p>
<p>For the <i>moment</i> is as changeless as an obsidian knife, and the heart
of the Indian is keen as the moment that divides past from future, and
sacrifices them both.</p>
<p>To Rosalino, too, the white monkey-tricks are amusing. He is ready to work
for the white monkeys, to learn some of their tricks, their monkey-speech of
Spanish, their tick-tack ways. He works for four <i>pesos</i> a month, and his
food: a few <i>tortillas</i>. Four <i>pesos</i> are two American dollars: about
nine shillings. He owns two cotton shirts, two pairs of calico pantaloons, two
blouses, one of pink cotton, one of darkish flannelette, and a pair of sandals.
Also, his straw hat that he has curled up to look very jaunty, and a rather
old, factory-made, rather cheap shawl, or plaid rug with fringe. <i>Et
praeterea nihil</i>.</p>
<p>His duty is to rise in the morning and sweep the street in front of the
house, and water it. Then he sweeps and waters the broad, brick-tiled verandas,
and flicks the chairs with a sort of duster made of fluffy reeds. After which
he walks behind the cook--she is very superior, had a Spanish grandfather, and
Rosalino must address her as <i>Se&ntilde;ora</i>--carrying the basket to
market. Returned from the market, he sweeps the whole of the <i>patio</i>,
gathers up the leaves and refuse, fills the pannier-basket, hitches it up on to
his shoulders, and holds it by a band across his forehead, and thus, a beast of
burden, goes out to deposit the garbage at the side of one of the little roads
leading out of the city. Every little road leaves the town between heaps of
garbage, an avenue of garbage blistering in the sun.</p>
<p>Returning, Rosalino waters the whole of the garden and sprinkles the whole
of the <i>patio</i>. This takes most of the morning. In the afternoon, he sits
without much to do. If the wind has blown or the day is hot, he starts again at
about three o'clock, sweeping up leaves, and sprinkling everywhere with an old
watering-can.</p>
<p>Then he retreats to the entrance-way, the <i>zagu&aacute;n</i>, which, with
its big doors and its cobbled track, is big enough to admit an ox-wagon. The
<i>zagu&aacute;n</i> is his home: just the doorway. In one corner is a low
wooden bench about four feet long and eighteen inches wide. On this he screws
up and sleeps, in his clothes as he is, wrapped in the old <i>sarape</i>.</p>
<p>But this is anticipating. In the obscurity of the <i>zagu&aacute;n</i> he
sits and pores, pores, pores over a school-book, learning to read and write. He
can read a bit, and write a bit. He filled a large sheet of foolscap with
writing: quite nice. But I found out that what he had written was a Spanish
poem, a love-poem, with <i>no puedo olvidar</i> and <i>voy a cortar</i>--the
rose, of course. He had written the thing straight ahead, without verse-lines
or capitals or punctuation at all, just a vast string of words, a whole
foolscap sheet full. When I read a few lines aloud, he writhed and laughed in
an agony of confused feelings. And of what he had written he understood a
small, small amount, parrot-wise, from the top of his head. Actually, it meant
just words, sound, noise, to him: noise called <i>Castellano</i>, Castilian.
Exactly like a parrot.</p>
<p>From seven to eight he goes to the night-school, to cover a bit more of the
foolscap. He has been going for two years. If he goes two years more he will
perhaps really be able to read and write six intelligible sentences: but only
Spanish, which is as foreign to him as Hindustani would be to an English
farm-boy. Then if he can speak his quantum of Spanish, and read it and write it
to a very uncertain extent, he will return to his village two days' journey on
foot into the hills, and then, in time, he may even rise to be an
<i>alcalde</i>, or headman of the village, responsible to the Government. If he
were <i>alcalde</i> he would get a little salary. But far more important to him
is the glory: being able to boss.</p>
<p>He has a <i>paisano</i>, a fellow-countryman, to sleep with him in the
<i>zagu&aacute;n</i>, to guard the doors. Whoever gets into the house or
<i>patio</i> must get through these big doors. There is no other entrance, not
even a needle's eye. The windows to the street are heavily barred. Each house
is its own small fortress. Ours is a double square, the trees and flowers in
the first square, with the two wings of the house. And in the second
<i>patio</i>, the chickens, pigeons, guinea-pigs, and the big heavy earthenware
dish or tub, called an <i>apaxtle</i>, in which all the servants can bathe
themselves, like chickens in a saucer.</p>
<p>By half past nine at night Rosalino is lying on his little bench, screwed
up, wrapped in his shawl, his sandals, called <i>huaraches</i>, on the floor.
Usually he takes off his <i>huaraches</i> when he goes to bed. That is all his
preparation. In another corner, wrapped up, head and all, like a mummy in his
thin old blanket, the <i>paisano</i>, another lad of about twenty, lies asleep
on the cold stones. And at an altitude of five thousand feet, the nights can be
cold.</p>
<p>Usually everybody is in by half past nine in our very quiet house. If not,
you may thunder at the big doors. It is hard to wake Rosalino. You have to go
close to him, and call. That will wake him. But don't touch him. That would
startle him terribly. No one is touched unawares, except to be robbed or
murdered.</p>
<p>'Rosalino! <i>est&aacute;n tocando</i>!'--'Rosalino! they are knocking!'</p>
<p>At last there starts up a strange, glaring, utterly lost Rosa-lino. Perhaps
he just has enough wit to pull the door-catch. One wonders where he was, and
what he was, in his sleep, he starts up so strange and wild and lost.</p>
<p>The first time he had anything to do for me was when the van was come to
carry the bit of furniture to the house. There was Aurelio, the dwarf
<i>mozo</i> of our friends and Rosalino, and the man who drove the wagon. But
there <i>should</i> have been also a <i>cargador</i>--a porter. 'Help them,'
said I to Rosalino. 'You give a hand to help.' But he winced away, muttering,
'<i>No quiero</i>!--I don't want to.'</p>
<p>The fellow, I thought to myself, is a fool. He thinks it's not his job, and
perhaps he is afraid of smashing the furniture. Nothing to be done but to leave
him alone.</p>
<p>We settled in, and Rosalino seemed to like doing things for us. He liked
learning his monkey-tricks from the white monkeys. And since we started feeding
him from our own meals, and for the first time in his life he had real soups,
meat-stews, or a fried egg, he loved to do things in the kitchen. He would come
with sparkling black eyes: <i>'H&eacute; comido el caldo. Grazias</i>!' (I have
eaten the soup. Thank you.')--And he would give a strange, excited little yelp
of a laugh.</p>
<p>Came the day when we walked to Huayapa, on the Sunday, and he was very
thrilled. But at night, in the evening when we got home, he lay mute on his
bench--not that he was really tired. The Indian gloom, which settles on them
like a black marsh-fog, had settled on him. He did not bring in the water--let
me carry it by myself.</p>
<p>Monday morning, the same black, reptilian gloom, and a sense of hatred. He
hated us. This was a bit flabbergasting, because he had been so thrilled and
happy the day before. But the revulsion had come. He didn't forgive himself for
having felt free and happy with us. He had eaten what we had eaten, hard-boiled
eggs and sardine sandwiches and cheese; he had drunk out of the orange-peel
<i>taza</i>, which delighted him so much. He had had a bottle of
<i>gaseosa</i>, fizz, with us, on the way home, in San Felipe.</p>
<p>And now, the reaction. The flint knife. He had been happy, <i>therefore</i>
we were scheming to take another advantage of him. We had some devilish white
monkey-trick up our sleeve; we wanted to get at his <i>soul</i>, no doubt, and
do it the white monkey's damage. We wanted to get at his heart, did we? But his
heart was an obsidian knife.</p>
<p>He hated us, and gave off a black steam of hate, that filled the
<i>patio</i> and made one feel sick. He did not come to the kitchen, he did not
carry the water. Leave him alone.</p>
<p>At lunch-time on Monday he said he wanted to leave. Why? He said he wanted
to go back to his village.</p>
<p>Very well. He was to wait just a few days, till another <i>mozo</i> was
found.</p>
<p>At this a glance of pure, reptilian hate from his black eyes.</p>
<p>He sat motionless on his bench all the afternoon, in the Indian stupor of
gloom and profound hate. In the evening, he cheered up a little and said he
would stay on, at least till Easter.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning. More stupor and gloom and hate. He wanted to go back to his
village at once. All right! No one wanted to keep him against his will. Another
<i>mozo</i> would be found at once.</p>
<p>He went off in the numb stupor of gloom and hate, a very potent hate that
could affect one in the pit of one's stomach with nausea.</p>
<p>Tuesday afternoon, and he thought he would stay.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning, and he wanted to go.</p>
<p>Very good. Inquiries made; another <i>mozo</i> was coming on Friday morning.
It was settled.</p>
<p>Thursday was <i>fiesta</i>. Wednesday, therefore, we would go to market, the
Nina--that is the mistress--myself, and Rosalino with the basket. He loved to
go to market with the <i>patrones</i>. We would give him money and send him off
to bargain for oranges, <i>pitahayas</i>, potatoes, eggs, a chicken, and so
forth. This he simply loved to do. It put him into a temper to see us buying
without bargaining, and paying ghastly prices.</p>
<p>He bargained away, silent almost, muttering darkly. It took him a long time,
but he had far greater success than even Natividad, the cook. And he came back
in triumph, with much stuff and little money spent.</p>
<p>So again that afternoon, he was staying on. The spell was wearing off.</p>
<p>The Indians of the hills have a heavy, intense sort of attachment to their
villages; Rosalino had not been out of the little city for two years. Suddenly
finding himself in Huayapa, a real Indian hill-village, the black Indian gloom
of nostalgia must have made a crack in his spirits. But he had been perfectly
cheerful--perhaps too cheerful--till we got home.</p>
<p>Again, the Se&ntilde;orita had taken a photograph of him. They are all crazy
to have their photographs taken. I had given him an envelope and a stamp, to
send a photograph to his mother. Because in his village he had a widow mother,
a brother, and a married sister. The family owned a bit of land, with
orange-trees. The best oranges come from the hills, where it is cooler. Seeing
the photographs, the mother, who had completely forgotten her son, as far as
any keen remembering goes, suddenly, like a cracker going off inside her,
wanted him: at that very moment. So she sent an urgent message.</p>
<p>But already it was Wednesday afternoon. Arrived a little fellow in white
clothes, smiling hard. It was the brother from the hills. Now, we thought,
Rosalino will have someone to walk back with. On Friday, after the
<i>fiesta</i>, he would go.</p>
<p>Thursday, he escorted us with the basket to the <i>fiesta</i>. He bargained
for flowers, and for a <i>sarape</i> which he didn't get, for a carved
<i>jicara</i> which he did get, and for a number of toys. He and the Nina and
the Se&ntilde;orita ate a great wafer of a pancake with sweet stuff on it. The
basket grew heavy. The brother appeared, to carry the hen and the extra things.
Bliss.</p>
<p>He was perfectly happy again. He didn't want to go on Friday; he didn't want
to go at all. He wanted to stay with us and come with us to England when we
went home.</p>
<p>So, another trip to the friend, the Mexican, who had found us the other
<i>mozo</i>. Now to put off the other boy again: but then, they are like
that.</p>
<p>And the Mexican, who had known Rosalino when he first carne down from the
hills and could speak no Spanish, told us another thing about him.</p>
<p>In the last revolution--a year ago--the revolutionaries of the winning side
wanted more soldiers from the hills. The <i>alcalde</i> of the hill-village was
told to pick out young men and send them down to the barracks in the city.
Rosalino was among the chosen.</p>
<p>But Rosalino refused, said again <i>No quiero</i>! He is one of those, like
myself, who have a horror of serving in a mass of men, or even f being mixed up
with a mass of men. He obstinately refused, Whereupon the recruiting soldiers
heat him with the butts of their rifles till he lay unconscious, apparently
dead.</p>
<p>Then, because they wanted him at once, and he would now be no good for some
time, with his injured back, they left him, to get the revolution over without
him.</p>
<p>This explains his fear of furniture-carrying, and his fear of being
'caught'.</p>
<p>Yet that little Aurelio, the friend's <i>mozo</i>, who is not above four
feet six in height, a tiny fellow, fared even worse, He, too, is from the
hills. In this village, a cousin of his gave some information to the
<i>losing</i> side in the revolution. The cousin wisely disappeared.</p>
<p>But in the city, the winning side seized Aurelio, since he was the
<i>cousin</i> of the delinquent. In spite of the fact that he was the faithful
<i>mozo</i> of a foreign resident, he was flung into prison. Prisoners in
prison are not fed. Either friends or relatives bring them food, or they go
very, very thin. Aurelio had a married sister in town, but <i>she</i> was
afraid to go to the prison lest she and her husband should be seized. The
master, then, sent his new <i>mozo</i> twice a day to the prison with a basket;
the huge, huge prison, for this little town of a few thousands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the master struggled and struggled with the 'authorities'--friends
of the people--for Aurelio's release. Nothing to be done.</p>
<p>One day the new <i>mozo</i> arrived at the prison with the basket, to find
no Aurelio. A friendly soldier gave the message Aurelio had left. '<i>Adios a
mi patr&oacute;n. Me llevan.</i>' Oh, fatal words: '<i>Me llevan.</i>'--They
are taking me off. The master rushed to the train: it had gone, with the dwarf,
plucky little <i>mozo</i>, into the void.</p>
<p>Months later, Aurelio reappeared. He was in rags, haggard, and his dark
throat was swollen up to the ears. He had been taken off, two hundred miles
into Vera Cruz State. He had been hung up by the neck, with a fixed knot, and
left hanging for hours. Why? To make the cousin come and save his relative: put
his own neck into a running noose. To make the absolutely innocent fellow
confess: what? Everybody knew he was innocent. At any rate, to teach everybody
better next time. Oh, brotherly teaching!</p>
<p>Aurelio escaped, and took to the mountains. Sturdy little dwarf of a fellow,
he made his way back, begging <i>tortillas</i> at the villages, and arrived,
haggard, with a great swollen neck, to find his master waiting, and another
'party' in power. More friends of the people.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is another day. The master nursed Aurelio well, and Aurelio is a
strong, if tiny, fellow, with big, brilliant black eyes that for the moment
will trust a foreigner, but none of his own people. A dwarf in stature, but
perfectly made, and very strong. And very intelligent, far more quick and
intelligent than Rosalino.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Aurelio and Rosalino, when they see the soldiers with
guns on their shoulders marching towards the prison with some blanched prisoner
between them--and one sees it every few days--stand and gaze in a blank kind of
horror, and look at the <i>patr&oacute;n</i>, to see if there is any
refuge?</p>
<p>Not to be <i>caught!</i> Not to be <i>caught!</i> It must have been the
prevailing motive of Indian-Mexico life since long before Montezuma marched his
prisoners to sacrifice.</p>

<h2>4 - MARKET DAY</h2>
<p>This is the last Saturday before Christmas. The next year will be momentous,
one feels. This year is nearly gone. Dawn was windy, shaking the leaves, and
the rising sun shone under a gap of yellow cloud. But at once it touched the
yellow flowers that rise above the <i>patio</i> wall, and the swaying, glowing
magenta of the bougainvillea, and the fierce red outbursts of the poinsettia.
The poinsettia is very splendid, the flowers very big, and of a sure stainless
red. They call them Noche Buenas, flowers of Christmas Eve. These tufts throw
out their scarlet sharply, like red birds ruffling in the wind of dawn as if
going to bathe, all their feathers alert. This for Christmas, instead of
holly-berries. Christmas seems to need a red herald.</p>
<p>The yucca is tall, higher than the house. It is, too, in flower, hanging an
arm's-length of soft creamy bells, like a yard-long grape-cluster of foam. And
the waxy bells break on their stems in the wind, fall noiselessly from the long
creamy bunch, that hardly sways.</p>
<p>The coffee-berries are turning red. The hibiscus flowers, rose-coloured,
sway at the tips of the thin branches, in rosettes of soft red.</p>
<p>In the second <i>patio</i>, there is a tall tree of the flimsy acacia sort.
Above itself it puts up whitish fingers of flowers, naked on the blue sky. And
in the wind these fingers of flowers in the bare blue sky, sway, sway with the
reeling, roundward motion of tree-tips in a wind.</p>
<p>A restless morning, with clouds lower down, moving also with a larger
roundward motion. Everything moving. Best to go out in motion too, the slow
roundward motion like the hawks.</p>
<p>Everything seems slowly to circle and hover towards a central point, the
clouds, the mountains round the valley, the dust that rises, the big,
beautiful, white-barred hawks, <i>gabilanes</i>, and even the snow-white flakes
of flowers upon the dim <i>palo-blanco</i> tree. Even the organ cactus, rising
in stock-straight clumps, and the candelabrum cactus, seem to be slowly
wheeling and pivoting upon a centre, close upon it.</p>
<p>Strange that we should think in straight lines, when there are none, and
talk of straight courses, when every course, sooner or later, is seen to be
making the sweep round, swooping upon the centre. When space is curved, and the
cosmos is sphere within sphere, and the way from any point to any other point
is round the bend of the inevitable, that turns as the tips of the broad wings
of the hawk turn upwards, leaning upon the air like the invisible half of the
ellipse. If I have a way to go, it will be round the swoop of a bend impinging
centripetal towards the centre. The straight course is hacked out in wounds,
against the will of the world.</p>
<p>Yet the dust advances like a ghost along the road, down the valley plain.
The dry turf of the valley-bed gleams like soft skin, sunlit and pinkish ochre,
spreading wide between the mountains that seem to emit their own darkness, a
dark-blue vapour translucent, sombring them from the humped crests downwards.
The many-pleated, noiseless mountains of Mexico.</p>
<p>And away on the footslope lie the white specks of Huayapa, among its lake of
trees. It is Saturday, and the white dots of men are threading down the trail
over the bare humps to the plain, following the dark twinkle-movement of asses,
the dark nodding of the woman's head as she rides between the baskets. Saturday
and market-day, and morning, so the white specks of men, like sea-gulls on
plough-land, come ebbing like sparks from the <i>palo-blanco</i>, over the fawn
undulating of the valley slope.</p>
<p>They are dressed in snow-white cotton, and they lift their knees in the
Indian trot, following the ass where the woman sits perched between the huge
baskets, her child tight in the <i>rebozo</i>, at the brown breast. And girls
in long, full, soiled cotton skirts running, trotting, ebbing along after the
twinkle-movement of the ass. Down they come in families, in clusters, in
solitary ones, threading with ebbing, running, barefoot movement noiseless
towards the town, that blows the bubbles of its church-domes above the stagnant
green of trees, away under the opposite fawn-skin hills.</p>
<p>But down the valley middle comes the big road, almost straight. You will
know it by the tall walking of the dust, that hastens also towards the town,
overtaking, overpassing everybody. Overpassing all the dark little figures and
the white specks that thread tinily, in a sort of underworld, to the town.</p>
<p>From the valley villages and from the mountains the peasants and the Indians
are coming in with supplies, the road is like a pilgrimage, with the dust in
greatest haste, dashing for town. Dark-eared asses and running men, running
women, running girls, running lads, twinkling donkeys ambling on fine little
feet, under twin baskets with tomatoes and gourds, twin great nets of
bubble-shaped jars, twin bundles of neat-cut faggots of wood, neat as bunches
of cigarettes, and twin net-sacks of charcoal. Donkeys, mules, on they come,
pannier baskets making a rhythm under the perched woman, great bundles bouncing
against the sides of the slim-footed animals. A baby donkey trotting naked
after its piled-up dam, a white, sandal-footed man following with the silent
Indian haste, and a girl running again on light feet.</p>
<p>Onwards, on a strange current of haste. And slowly rowing among the,
foot-travel, the ox-wagons rolling solid wheels below the high net of the body.
Slow oxen, with heads pressed down nosing to the earth, swaying, swaying their
great horns as a snake sways itself, the shovel-shaped collar of solid wood
pressing down on their necks like a scoop. On, on between the burnt-up turf and
the solid, monumental green of the organ cactus. Past the rocks and the
floating <i>palo-blanco</i> flowers, past the towsled dust of the mesquite
bushes. While the dust once more, in a greater haste than anyone, comes tall
and rapid down the road, overpowering and obscuring all the little people, as
in a cataclysm.</p>
<p>They are mostly small people, of the Zapotec race: small men with lifted
chests and quick, lifted knees, advancing with heavy energy in the midst of
dust. And quiet, small, round-headed women running barefoot, tightening their
blue <i>rebozos</i> round their shoulders, so often with a baby in the fold.
The white cotton clothes of the men so white that their faces are invisible
places of darkness under their big hats. Clothed darkness, faces of night,
quickly, silently, with inexhaustible energy advancing to the town.</p>
<p>And many of the <i>serranos</i>, the Indians from the hills, wearing their
little conical black felt hats, seem capped with night, above the straight
white shoulders. Some have come far, walking all yesterday in their little
black hats and black-sheathed sandals. Tomorrow they will walk .back. And their
eyes will be just the same, black and bright and wild, in the dark faces. They
have no goal, any more than the hawks in the air, and no course to run, any
more than the clouds.</p>
<p>The market is a huge roofed-in place. Most extraordinary is the noise that
comes out, as you pass along the adjacent street. It is a huge noise, yet you
may never notice it. It sounds as if all the ghosts in the world were talking
to one another, in ghost-voices, within the darkness of the market structure.
It is a noise something like rain, or banana leaves in a wind. The market, full
of Indians, dark-faced, silent-footed, hush-spoken, but pressing in in
countless numbers. The queer hissing murmurs of the Zapotec <i>idioma</i>,
among the sounds of Spanish, the quiet, aside, voices of the Mixtecas.</p>
<p>To buy and to sell, but above all, to commingle. In the old world, men make
themselves two great excuses for coming together to a centre, and commingling
freely in a mixed, unsuspicious host. Market and religion. These alone bring
men, unarmed, together since time began. A little load of firewood, a woven
blanket, a few eggs and tomatoes are excuse enough for men, women, and children
to cross the foot-weary miles of valley and mountain. To buy, to sell, to
barter, to exchange. To exchange, above all things, human contact.</p>
<p>That is why they like you to bargain, even if it's only the difference of a
<i>centavo</i>. Round the centre of the covered market where there is a basin
of water, are the flowers: red, white, pink roses in heaps, many-coloured
little carnations, poppies, bits of larkspur, lemon and orange marigolds, buds
of madonna lilies, pansies, a few forget-me-nots. They don't bring the tropical
flowers. Only the lilies come wild from the hills, and the mauve red
orchids.</p>
<p>'How much this bunch of cherry-pie heliotrope?' 'Fifteen
<i>centavos</i>.'</p>
<p>'Ten.'</p>
<p>'Fifteen.'</p>
<p>You put back the cherry-pie, and depart. But the woman is quite content. The
contact, so short even, brisked her up. 'Pinks?'</p>
<p>'The red one, Se&ntilde;orita? Thirty <i>centavos</i>.'</p>
<p>'No. I don't want red ones. The mixed.'</p>
<p>'Ah!' The woman seizes a handful of little carnations of all colours,
carefully puts them together. 'Look, Se&ntilde;orita! No more?'</p>
<p>'No, no more. How much?'</p>
<p>'The same. Thirty <i>centavos</i>.'</p>
<p>'It is much.'</p>
<p>'No, Se&ntilde;orita, it is not much. Look at this little bunch. It is eight
<i>centavos</i>.'--Displays a scrappy little bunch. Come then,
twenty-five.'</p>
<p>'No! Twenty-two.'</p>
<p>'Look!' She gathers up three or four more flowers, and claps them to the
bunch. 'Two <i>reales</i>, Se&ntilde;orita.'</p>
<p>It is a bargain. Off you go with multicoloured pinks, and the woman has had
one more moment of contact, with a stranger, a perfect stranger. An
intermingling of voices, a threading together of different wills. It is life.
The <i>centavos</i> are an excuse.</p>
<p>The stalls go off in straight lines, to the right, brilliant vegetables, to
the left, bread and sweet buns. Away at the one end, cheese, butter, eggs,
chicken, turkeys, meat. At the other, the native-woven blankets and
<i>rebozos</i>, skirts, shirts, handkerchiefs. Down the far-side, sandals and
leather things.</p>
<p>The <i>sarape</i> men spy you, and whistle to you like ferocious birds, and
call 'Se&ntilde;or! Se&ntilde;or! Look!' Then with violence one flings open a
dazzling blanket, while another whistles more ear-piercingly still, to make you
look at <i>his</i> blanket. It is the veritable den of lions and tigers, that
spot where the <i>sarape</i> men have their blankets piled on the ground. You
shake your head, and flee.</p>
<p>To find yourself in the leather avenue.</p>
<p>'Se&ntilde;or! <i>Se&ntilde;ora</i> Look! <i>Huaraches!</i> Very fine, very
finely made! Look, Se&ntilde;or!'</p>
<p>The fat leather man jumps up and holds a pair of sandals at one's breast.
They are of narrow woven strips of leather, in the newest Paris style, but a
style ancient to these natives. You take them in your hand, and look at them
quizzically, while the fat wife of the <i>huarache</i> man reiterates, 'Very
fine work. Very fine. Much work!'</p>
<p>Leather men usually seem to have their wives with them. 'How much?'</p>
<p>'Twenty <i>reales</i>.'</p>
<p>'Twenty!'--in a voice of surprise and pained indignation. 'How much do you
give?'</p>
<p>You refuse to answer. Instead you put the <i>huaraches</i> to your nose. The
<i>huarache</i> man looks at his wife, and they laugh aloud.</p>
<p>'They smell,' you say.</p>
<p>'No, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, they don't smell!'--and the two go off into fits
of laughter.</p>
<p>'Yes, they smell. It is not American leather.'</p>
<p>'Yes, <i>Se&ntilde;or</i>, it is American leather. They don't smell,
<i>Se&ntilde;or</i>. No, they don't smell.' He coaxes you till you wouldn't
believe your own nose.</p>
<p>'Yes, they smell.'</p>
<p>'How much do you give?'</p>
<p>'Nothing, because they smell.'</p>
<p>And you give another sniff, though it is painfully unnecessary. And in spite
of your refusal to bid, the man and wife go into fits of laughter to see you
painfully sniffing.</p>
<p>You lay down the sandals and shake your head.</p>
<p>'How much do you offer?' reiterates the man, gaily.</p>
<p>You shake your head mournfully, and move away. The leather man and his wife
look at one another and go off into another fit of laughter, because you smelt
the <i>huaraches</i>, and said they stank.</p>
<p>They did. The natives use human excrement for tanning leather. When Bernal
Diaz came with Cort&eacute;s to the great market-place of Mexico City, in
Montezuma's day, he saw the little pots of human excrement in rows for sale,
and the leather-makers going round sniffing to see which was the best, before
they paid for it. It staggered even a fifteenth-century Spaniard. Yet my
leather man and his wife think it screamingly funny that I smell the
<i>huaraches</i> before buying them. Everything has its own smell, and the
natural smell of <i>huaraches</i> is what it is. You might as well quarrel with
an onion for smelling like an onion.</p>
<p>The great press of the quiet natives, some of them bright and clean, many in
old rags, the brown flesh showing through the rents in the dirty cotton. Many
wild hillmen, in their little hats of conical black felt, with their wild,
staring eyes. And as they cluster round the hat-stall, in a long, long suspense
of indecision before they can commit themselves, trying on a new hat, their
black hair gleams blue-black, and falls thick and rich over their foreheads,
like gleaming bluey-black feathers.</p>
<p>And one is reminded again of the blue-haired Buddha, with the lotus at his
navel.</p>
<p>But already the fleas are travelling under one's clothing.</p>
<p>Market lasts all day. The native inns are great dreary yards with little
sheds, and little rooms around. Some men and families who have come from far,
will sleep in one or other of the little stall-like rooms. Many will sleep on
the stones, on the earth, round the market, anywhere. But the asses are there
by the hundred, crowded in the inn-yards, drooping their ears with the eternal
patience of the beast that knows better than any other beast that every road
curves round to the same centre of rest, and hither and thither means
nothing.</p>
<p>And towards nightfall the dusty road will be thronged with shadowy people
and unladen asses and new-laden mules, urging silently into the country again,
their backs to the town, glad to get away from the town, to see the cactus and
the pleated hills, and the trees that mean a village. In some village they will
lie under a tree, or under a wall, and sleep. Then the next day, home.</p>
<p>It is fulfilled, what they came to market for. They have sold and bought.
But more than that, they have had their moment of contact and centripetal flow.
They have been part of a great stream of men flowing to a centre, to the vortex
of the marketplace. And here they have felt life concentrate upon them, they
have been jammed between the soft hot bodies of strange men come from afar,
they have had the sound of strangers' voices in their ears, they have asked and
been answered in unaccustomed ways.</p>
<p>There is no goal, and no abiding-place, and nothing is fixed, not even the
cathedral towers. The cathedral towers are slowly leaning, seeking the curve of
return. As the natives curved in a strong swirl, towards the vortex of the
market. Then on a strong swerve of repulsion, curved out and away again, into
space.</p>
<p>Nothing but the touch, the spark of contact. That, no more. That, which is
most elusive, still the only treasure. Come, and gone, and yet the clue
itself.</p>
<p>True, folded up in the handkerchief inside the shirt, are the copper
<i>centavos</i>, and maybe a few silver <i>pesos</i>. But these too will
disappear as the stars disappear at daybreak, as they are meant to disappear.
Everything is meant to disappear. Every curve plunges into the vortex and is
lost, re-emerges with a certain relief and takes to the open, and there is lost
again.</p>
<p>Only that which is utterly intangible, matters. The contact, the spark of
exchange. That which can never be fastened upon, for ever gone, for ever
coming, never to be detained: the spark of contact.</p>
<p>Like the evening star, when it is neither night nor day. Like the evening
star, between the sun and the moon, and swayed by neither of them. The flashing
intermediary, the evening star that is seen only at the dividing of the day and
night, but then is more wonderful than either.</p>

<h2>5 - INDIANS AND ENTERTAINMENT</h2>
<p>We go to the theatre to be entertained. It may be <i>The Potters</i>, it may
be Max Reinhardt, <i>King Lear</i>, or <i>Electra</i>. All
entertainment.</p>
<p>We want to be taken out of ourselves. Or not entirely that. We want to
become spectators at our own show. We lean down from the plush seats like
little gods in a democratic heaven, and see ourselves away below there, on the
world of the stage, in a brilliant artificial sunlight, behaving comically
absurdly, like Pa Potter, yet getting away with it, or behaving tragically
absurdly, like King Lear, and not getting away with it: rather proud of not
getting away with it.</p>
<p>We see ourselves: we survey ourselves: we laugh at ourselves: we weep over
ourselves: we are the gods above of our own destinies. Which is very
entertaining.</p>
<p>The secret of it all, is that we detach ourselves from the painful and
always sordid trammels of actual existence, and become creatures of memory and
of spirit-like consciousness. We are the gods and there's the machine, down
below us. Down below, on the stage, our mechanical or earth-bound self stutters
or raves, Pa Potter or King Lear. But however Potterish or Learian we may be,
while we sit aloft in plush seats we are creatures of pure consciousness, pure
spirit, surveying those selves of clay who are so absurd or so tragic,
below.</p>
<p>Even a little girl trailing a long skirt and playing at being Mrs Paradiso
next door, is enjoying the same sensation. From her childish little
consciousness she is making Mrs Paradiso, creating her according to her own
fancy. It is the little individual consciousness lording it, for the moment,
over the actually tiresome and inflexible world of actuality. Mrs Paradiso in
the flesh is a thing to fear. But if I can play at being Mrs Paradiso, why,
then I am a little Lord Almighty, and Mrs Paradiso is but a creation from my
consciousness:</p>
<p>The audience in the theatre is a little democracy of the ideal
consciousness. They all sit there, gods of the ideal mind, and survey with
laughter or tears the realm of actuality.</p>
<p>Which is very soothing and satisfying so long as you believe that the ideal
mind is the actual arbiter. So long as you instinctively feel that there is
some supreme, universal Ideal Consciousness swaying all destiny.</p>
<p>When you begin to have misgivings, you sit rather uneasily on your plush
seat.</p>
<p>Nobody really believes that destiny is an accident. The very fact that day
keeps on following night, and summer winter, establishes the belief in
universal law, and from this to a belief in some great hidden mind in the
universe is an inevitable step for us.</p>
<p>A few people, the so-called advanced, have grown uneasy in their bones about
the Universal Mind. But the mass are absolutely convinced. And every member of
the mass is absolutely convinced that he is part and parcel of this Universal
Mind. Hence his joy at the theatre. His even greater joy at the
cinematograph.</p>
<p>In the moving pictures he has detached himself even further from the solid
stuff of earth. There, the people are truly shadows: the shadow-pictures are
thinkings of his mind. They live in the rapid and kaleidoscopic realm of the
abstract. And the individual watching the shadow-spectacle sits a very god, in
an orgy of abstraction, actually dissolved into delighted, watchful spirit. And
if his best girl sits beside him, she vibrates in the same ether, and triumphs
in the same orgy of abstraction. No wonder this passion of dramatic abstraction
becomes a lust.</p>
<p>That is our idea of entertainment.</p>
<p>You come to the Indian and ask him about his. He hasn't got one.</p>
<p>The Indians dance around the drum, singing. They have their great
spectacular dances, Eagle dance, Corn dance. They have the dancing, singing
procession between the fires at Christmas. They have their sacred races, down
the long track.</p>
<p>White people always, or nearly always, write sentimentally about the
Indians. Even a man like Adolf Bandelier. He was not a sentimental man. On the
contrary. Yet the sentimentality creeps in, when he writes about the thing he
knows best, the Indian.</p>
<p>So it is with all of them, anthropologists and myth-transcribers and all.
There is that creeping note of sentimentality through it all, which makes one
shrug one's shoulders and wish the Indians to hell, along with a lot of other
bunk.</p>
<p>You've got to de-bunk the Indians, as you've got to debunk the Cowboy. When
you've de-bunked the Cowboy, there's not much left. But the Indian bunk is not
the Indian's invention. It is ours.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible for the white people to approach the Indian without
either sentimentality or dislike. The common healthy vulgar white usually feels
a certain native dislike of these drumming aboriginals. The highbrow invariably
lapses into sentimentalism like the smell of bad eggs.</p>
<p>Why?--Both the reactions are due to the same feeling in the white man. The
Indian is not in line with us. He's not coming our way. His whole being is
going a different way from ours. And the minute you set eyes on him you know
it.</p>
<p>And then, there's only two things you can do. You can detest the insidious
devil for having an utterly different way from our own great way. Or you can
perform the mental trick, and fool yourself and others into believing that the
befeathered and bedaubed darling is nearer to the true ideal gods than we
are.</p>
<p>This last is just bunk, and a lie. But it saves our appearances. The former
feeling, of instinctive but tolerant repulsion, the feeling of most ordinary
farmers and ranchers and mere individuals in the west, is quite natural, it is
only honesty to admit it.</p>
<p>The Indian way of consciousness is different from and fatal to our way of
consciousness. Our way of consciousness is different from and fatal to the
Indian. The two ways, the two streams are never to be united. They are not even
to be reconciled. There is no bridge, no canal of connexion.</p>
<p>The sooner we realize, and accept, this, the better, and leave off trying,
with fulsome sentimentalism, to render the Indian in our own terms.</p>
<p>The acceptance of the great paradox of human consciousness is the first step
to a new accomplishment.</p>
<p>The consciousness of one branch of humanity is the annihilation of the
consciousness of another branch. That is, the life of the Indian, his stream of
conscious being, is just death to the white man. And we can understand the
consciousness of the Indian only in terms of the death of our
consciousness.</p>
<p>And let not this be turned into another sentimentalism. Because the same
paradox exists between the consciousness of white men and Hindoos or
Polynesians or Bantu. It is the eternal paradox of human consciousness. To
pretend that all is one stream is to cause chaos and nullity. To pretend to
express one stream in terms of another, so as to identify the two, is false and
sentimental. The only thing you can do is to have a little Ghost inside you
which sees both ways, or even many ways. But a man cannot <i>belong</i> to both
ways, or to many ways. One man can belong to one great way of consciousness
only. He may even change from one way to another. But he cannot go both ways at
once. Can't be done.</p>
<p>So that, to understand the Indian conception of entertainment, we have to
destroy our own conception.</p>
<p>Perhaps the commonest entertainment among the Indians is singing round the
drum, at evening, when the day is over. European peasants will sit round the
fire' and sing. But they sing ballads or lyrics, tales about individuals or
individual, personal experience. And each individual identifies the emotion of
the song with his own emotion.</p>
<p>Or the wild fishermen of the Outer Hebrides will sing in their intense,
concentrated way, by the fire. And again, usually, the songs have words. Yet
sometimes not. Sometimes the song has merely sounds, and a marvellous melody.
It is the seal drifting in to shore on the wave, or the seal-woman, singing low
and secret, departing back from the shores of men, through the surf, back to
the realm of the outer beasts that rock on the waters and stare through
glistening, vivid, mindless eyes.</p>
<p>This is approaching the Indian song. But even this is pictorial, conceptual
far beyond the Indian point. The Hebridean still sees himself human, and
<i>outside</i> the great naturalistic influences, which are the dramatic
circumstances of his life.</p>
<p>The Indian, singing, sings without words or vision. Face lifted and
sightless, eyes half closed and visionless, mouth open and speechless, the
sounds arise in his chest, from the consciousness in the abdomen. He will tell
you it is a song of a man coming home from the bear-hunt: or a song to make
rain: or a song to make the corn grow: or even, quite modern, the song of the
church bell on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>But the man corning home from the bear-hunt is any man, all men, the bear is
any bear, every bear, all bear. There is no individual, isolated experience. It
is the hunting, tired, triumphant demon of manhood which has won against the
squint-eyed demon of all bears. The, experience is generic, non-individual. It
is an experience of the human bloodstream, not of the mind or spirit. Hence the
subtle incessant, insistent rhythm of the drum, which is pulsated like the
heart, and soulless, and unescapable. Hence the strange blind unanimity of the
Indian men's voices. The experience is one experience, tribal, of the
blood-stream. Hence, to our ears, the absence of melody. Melody is
individualized emotion, just as orchestral music is the harmonizing again of
many separate, individual emotions or experiences. But the real Indian song is
non-individual, and without melody. Strange, clapping, crowing, gurgling
sounds, in an unseizable subtle rhythm, the rhythm of the heart in her throes:
from a parted entranced mouth, from a chest powerful and free, from an-abdomen
where the great blood-stream surges in the dark, and surges in its own generic
experiences.</p>
<p>This may mean nothing to you. To the ordinary white ear, the Indian's
singing is a rather disagreeable howling of dogs to a tom-tom. But if it rouses
no other sensation, it rouses a touch of fear amid hostility. Whatever the
spirit of man may be, the blood is basic.</p>
<p>Or take the song to make the corn grow. The dark faces stoop forward, in a
strange race darkness. The eyelashes droop a little in the dark, ageless,
vulnerable faces. The drum is a heart beating with insistent thuds. And the
spirits of the men go out on the ether, vibrating in waves from the hot, dark,
intentional blood, seeking the creative presence that hovers for ever in the
ether, seeking the identification, following on down the mysterious rhythms of
the creative pulse, on and on into the germinating quick of the maize that lies
under the ground, there, with the throbbing, pulsing, clapping rhythm that
comes from the dark, creative blood in man, to stimulate the tremulous,
pulsating protoplasm in the seed-germ, till it throws forth its rhythms of
creative energy into rising blades of leaf and stem.</p>
<p>Or take the round dances, round the drum. These may or may not have a name.
The dance, anyhow, is primarily a song. All the men sing in unison, as they
move with the soft, yet heavy bird-tread which is the whole of the dance. There
is no drama. With bodies bent a little forward, shoulders and breasts loose and
heavy, feet powerful but soft, the men tread the rhythm into the centre of the
earth. The drums keep up the pulsating heart-beat. The men sing in unison,
though some will be silent for moments, or even minutes. And for hours, hours
it goes on: the round dance.</p>
<p>It has no name. It has no words. It means nothing at all. There is no
spectacle, no spectator.</p>
<p>Yet perhaps it is the most stirring sight in the world, in the dark, near
the fire, with the drums going, the pine-trees standing still, the everlasting
darkness, and the strange lifting and dropping, surging, crowing, gurgling,
aah--h--h--ing! of the male voices.</p>
<p>What are they doing? Who knows? But perhaps they are giving themselves again
to the pulsing, incalculable fall of the blood, which for ever seeks to fall to
the centre of the earth, while the heart like a planet pulsating in an orbit,
keeps up the strange, lonely circulating of the separate human existence.</p>
<p>But what we seek, passively, in sleep, they perhaps seek actively, in the
round dance. It is the homeward pulling of the blood, as the feet fall in the
soft, heavy rhythm, endlessly. It is the dark blood falling back from the mind,
from sight and speech and knowing, back to the great central source where is
rest and unspeakable renewal. We whites, creatures of spirit, look upon sleep
and see only the dreams that lie as debris of the day, mere bits of wreckage
from day-consciousness. We never realize the strange falling back of the dark
blood into the downward rhythm, the rhythm of pure forgetting and pure
renewal.</p>
<p>Or take the little dances round the fire, the mime dances, when two men put
on the eagle feathers and take the shield on their arm, and dance the pantomime
of a fight, a spear dance. The rhythm is the same, really, the drums keep up
the heart-pulsation, the feet the peculiar bird-tread, the soft, heavy,
birdlike step that treads as it were towards the centre of the earth. But there
is also the subtle leaping towards each other of the two shield-sheltered naked
ones, feathered with the power of an eagle. The leaping together, the coming
close, the circling, wary, stealthy avoidance and retreat, always on the same
rhythm of drum-beats, the same regular, heavy-soft tread of moccasined feet. It
is the dance of the naked blood-being, defending his own isolation in the
rhythm of the universe. Not skill nor prowess, not heroism. Not man to man. The
creature of the isolated, circulating blood-stream dancing in the peril of his
own isolation, in the overweening of his own singleness. The glory in power of
the man of single existence. The peril of the man whose heart is suspended,
like a single red star, in a great and complex universe, following its own lone
course round the invisible sun of our own being, amid the strange wandering
array of other hearts.</p>
<p>The other men look on. They may or may not sing. And they see themselves in
the power and peril of the lonely heart, the creature of the isolated
blood-circuit. They see also, subsidiary, the skill, the agility, the
swiftness, the daunting onrush that make the warrior. It is practice as well as
mystery.</p>
<p>Or take the big, spectacular dances, like the deer dance, the corn dance.
The deer dance in the New Year. The people crowded on the roofs of the pueblo:
women, children, old men, watching. The two lines of men, hunters, facing one
another. And away at the stream which comes running swiftly from among the
cotton-wood trees, the watchers, watching eagerly. At last, over the log
bridge, two maidens leading the animals: two maidens in their black shawls and
wide white deer-skin top-boots, dancing with a slow, delicate-footed rhythm,
facing out, then facing in, and shaking their gourd rattles delicately, marking
the rhythm as the drums mark it. Following the maidens, all the animals: men in
two columns, and each man an animal, leaning forward each on two slim sticks
which are his forelegs, with the deer-skin over him, the antlers branching from
his head: or the buffalo hide, from whose shaggy mane his bent head peers out:
or a black bear, or a wolf. There they come, the two long lines of wild
animals: deer, buffalo, bear, wolf, coyote, and at the back, even tiny boys, as
foxes, all stepping on those soft, pointed toes, and moving in slow silence
under the winter sun, following the slow, swinging progress of the dancing
maidens.</p>
<p>Everything is very soft, subtle, delicate. There is none of the hardness of
representation. They are not representing something, not even playing. It is a
soft, subtle <i>being</i> something.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time it is a game, and a very dramatic na&iuml;ve spectacle.
The old men trot softly alongside, laughing, showing all their wrinkles. But
they are experiencing a delicate, wild inward delight, participating in the
natural mysteries. They tease the little boys under the fox-skins, and the
boys, peeping with their round black eyes, are shy and confused. Yet they keep
on in the procession, solemnly, as it moves between the ranks of the wild
hunters. And all eyes are round with wonder, and the mystery of participation.
Amused, too, on the merely human side of themselves. The gay touch of amusement
in buffoonery does not in the least detract from the delicate, pulsing wonder
of solemnity, which comes from participating in the ceremony itself.</p>
<p>There you have it all, the pantomime, the buffoonery, the human comicalness.
But at the same time, quivering bright and wide-eyed in unchangeable delight of
solemnity, you have the participating in a natural wonder. The mystery of the
wild creatures led from their fastnesses, their wintry retreats and holes in
the ground, docilely fascinated by the delicacy and the commanding wistfulness
of the maidens who went out to seek them, to seek food in the winter, and who
draw after them, in a following, the wild, the timid, the rapacious animals,
following in gentle wonder of bewitchment, right into the haunts of men, right
into the camp and up to the hunters. The two long lines of wild animals
delicately and slowly stepping behind the slow gyration of the two dark-fringed
maidens, who shake their gourd rattles in a delicate, quick, three-pulsed
rhythm, and never change their wide dark eyes, under the dark fringe. It is the
celebration of another triumph, the triumph of the magical wistfulness of
women, the wonderful power of her seeking, her yearning, which can draw forth
even the bear from his den.</p>
<p>Drama, we are told, has developed out of these ceremonial Glances. Greek
drama arose this way.</p>
<p>But from the Indian's ceremonial dance to the Greek's early religious
ceremony is still a long step. The Greeks usually had some specified deity,
some particular god to whom the ceremony was offered. And this god is the
witness, the essential audience of the play. The ceremony is <i>performed</i>
for the gratification of the god. And here you have the beginning of the
theatre, with players and audience.</p>
<p>With the Indians it is different, There is strictly no god. The Indian does
not consider himself as created, and therefore external to God, or the creature
of God. To the Indian there is no conception of a defined God. Creation is a
great flood, for ever flowing, in lovely and terrible waves. In everything, the
shimmer of creation, and never the finality of the created. Never the
distinction between God and God's creation, or between Spirit and Matter.
Everything, everything is the wonderful shimmer of creation, it may be a deadly
shimmer like lightning or the anger in the little eyes of the bear, it may be
the beautiful shimmer of the moving deer, or the pine-boughs softly swaying
under snow. Creation contains the unspeakably terrifying enemy, the unspeakably
lovely friend, as the maiden who brings us our food in dead of winter, by her
passion of tender wistfulness. Yet even this tender wistfulness is the fearful
danger of the wild creatures, deer and bear and buffalo, which find their death
in it.</p>
<p>There is, in our sense of the word, no God. But all is godly. There is no
Great Mind directing the universe. Yet the mystery of creation, the wonder and
fascination of creation shimmers in every leaf and stone, in every thorn and
bud, in the fangs of the rattlesnake, and in the soft eyes of a fawn. Things
utterly opposite are still pure wonder of creation, the yell of the
mountain-lion, and the breeze in the aspen leaves. The Apache warrior in his
war-paint, shrieking the war-cry and cutting the throats of old women, still he
is part of the mystery of creation. He is godly as the growing corn. And the
mystery of creation makes us sharpen the knives and point the arrows in utmost
determination against him. It must be so. It is part of the wonder. And to
every part of the wonder we must answer in kind.</p>
<p>The Indians accept Jesus on the Cross amid all the rest of the wonders. The
presence of Jesus on the Cross, or the pitiful Mary Mother, does not in the
least prevent the strange intensity of the war-dance. The brave comes home with
a scalp. In the morning he goes to Mass. Two mysteries! The soul of man is the
theatre in which every mystery is enacted. Jesus, Mary, the snake-dance, red
blood on the knife: it is all the rippling of this untellable flood of
creation, which, in a narrow sense, we call Nature.</p>
<p>There is no division between actor and audience. It is all one.</p>
<p>There is no God looking on. The only god there is, is involved all the time
in the dramatic wonder and inconsistency of creation. God is immersed, as it
were, in creation, not to be separated or distinguished. There can be no Ideal
God.</p>
<p>And here finally you see the difference between Indian entertainment and
even the earliest form of Greek drama. Right at the beginning of Old World
dramatic presentation there was the onlooker, if only in the shape of the God
Himself, or the Goddess Herself, to whom the dramatic offering was made. And
this God or Goddess resolves, at last, into a Mind occupied by some particular
thought or idea. And in the long course of evolution, we ourselves become the
gods of our own drama. The spectacle is offered to us. And we sit aloft,
enthroned in the Mind, dominated by some one exclusive idea, and we judge the
show.</p>
<p>There is absolutely none of this in the Indian dance. There is no God. There
is no Onlooker. There is no Mind. There is no dominant idea. And finally, there
is no judgement: absolutely no judgement.</p>
<p>The Indian is completely embedded in the wonder of his own drama. It is a
drama that has no beginning and no end, it is all-inclusive. It can't be
judged, because there is nothing outside it, to judge it.</p>
<p>The mind is there merely as a servant, to keep a man pure and true to the
mystery, which is always present. The mind bows down before the creative
mystery, even of the atrocious Apache warrior. It judges, not the good and the
bad, but the lie and the true. The Apache warrior in all his atrocity, is true
to his own creative mystery. And as such, he must he fought. But he cannot be
called a <i>lie</i> on the face of the earth. Hence he cannot be classed among
the abominations, the cowards, and the liars: those who betray the wonder.</p>
<p>The Indian, so long as he is pure, has only two great negative
commandments.</p>
<p><i>Thou shalt not lie.</i></p>
<p><i>Thou shalt not be a coward.</i></p>
<p>Positively, his one commandment is:</p>
<p><i>Thou shalt acknowledge the wonder.</i></p>
<p>Evil lies in lying and in cowardice. Wickedness lies in witchcraft; that is,
in seeking to prostitute the creative wonder to the individual mind and will,
the individual conceit.</p>
<p>And virtue? Virtue lies in the heroic response to the creative wonder, the
utmost response. In the man, it is a valiant putting forth of all his strength
to meet and to run forward with the wonder. In woman it is the putting forth of
all herself in a delicate, marvellous sensitiveness, which draws forth the
wonder to herself, and draws the man to the wonder in her, as it drew even the
wild animals from the lair of winter.</p>
<p>You see this so plainly in the Indian races. Naked and daubed with clay to
hide the nakedness, and to take the anointment of the earth; stuck over with
bits of fluff of eagle's down, to be anointed with the power of the air, the
youths and men whirl down the racing track, in relays. They are not racing to
win a race. They are not racing for a prize. They are not racing to show their
prowess.</p>
<p>They are putting forth all their might, all their strength, in a tension
that is half anguish, half ecstasy, in the effort to gather into their souls
more and more of the creative fire, the creative energy which shall carry their
tribe through the year, through the vicissitudes of the months, on, on, in the
unending race of humanity along the track of trackless creation. It is the
heroic effort, the sacred heroic effort which men must make and must keep on
making. As if hurled from a catapult the Indian youth throws himself along the
course, working his body strangely incomprehensibly. And when his turn comes
again, he hurls himself forward with greater intensity, to greater speed,
driving himself, as it were, into the heart of the fire. And the old men along
the track encourage him, urge him with their green twigs, laughingly,
mockingly, teasingly, but at the same time with an exquisite pure anxiety and
concern.</p>
<p>And he walks away at last, his chest lifting and falling heavily, a strange
look in his eyes, having run with the changeless god who will give us nothing
unless we overtake him.</p>

<h2>6 - DANCE OF THE SPROUTING CORN</h2>
<p>Pale, dry, baked earth, that blows into dust of fine sand. Low hills of
baked pale earth, sinking heavily, and speckled sparsely with dark dots of
cedar bushes. A river on the plain of drought, just a cleft of dark,
reddish-brown water, almost a flood. And over all, the blue, uneasy, alkaline
sky.</p>
<p>A pale, uneven, parched world, where a motor-car rocks and lurches and
churns in sand. A world pallid with dryness, inhuman with a faint taste of
alkali. Like driving in the bed of a great sea that dried up unthinkable ages
ago, and now is drier than any other dryness, yet still reminiscent of the
bottom of the sea, sandhills sinking, and straight, cracked mesas, like cracks
in the dry-mud bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>So, the mud church standing discreetly outside, just outside the pueblo, not
to see too much. And on its fa&ccedil;ade of mud, under the timbered mud-eaves,
two speckled horses rampant, painted by the Indians, a red piebald and a black
one.</p>
<p>Swish! Over the logs of the ditch-bridge, where brown water is flowing full.
There below is the pueblo, dried mud like mud-pie houses, all squatting in a
jumble, prepared to crumble into dust and be invisible, dust to dust returning,
earth to earth.</p>
<p>That they don't crumble is the mystery. That these little squarish mud-heaps
endure for centuries after centuries, while Greek marble tumbles asunder, and
cathedrals totter, is the wonder. But then, the naked human hand with a bit of
new soft mud is quicker than time, and defies the centuries.</p>
<p>Roughly the low, square, mud-pie houses make a wide street where all is
naked earth save a doorway or a window with a pale-blue sash. At the end of the
street, turn again into a parallel wide, dry street. And there, in the dry,
oblong aridity, there tosses a small forest that is alive: and thud--thud--thud
goes the drum, and the deep sound of men singing is like the deep soughing of
the wind, in the depths of a wood.</p>
<p>You realize that you had heard the drum from the distance, also the deep,
distant roar and boom of the singing, but that you had not heeded, as you don't
heed the wind.</p>
<p>It all tosses like young, agile trees in a wind. This is the dance of the
sprouting corn, and everybody holds a little, beating branch of green pine.
Thud--thud--thud--thud--thud! goes the drum, heavily the men hop and hop and
hop, sway, sway, sway, sway go the little branches of green pine. It tosses
like a little forest, and the deep sound of men's singing is like the booming
and tearing of a wind deep inside a forest. They are dancing the Spring Corn
Dance.</p>
<p>This is the Wednesday after Easter, after Christ Risen and the corn
germinated. They dance on Monday and on Tuesday. Wednesday is the third and
last dance of this green resurrection.</p>
<p>You realize the long line of dancers, and a solid cluster of men singing
near the drum. You realize the intermittent black-and-white fantasy of the
hopping Koshare, the jesters, the Delight-Makers. You become aware of the
ripple of bells on the knee-garters of the dancers, a continual pulsing ripple
of little bells; and of the sudden wild, whooping yells from near the drum.
Then you become aware of the seed-like shudder of the gourd-rattles, as the
dance changes, and the slaying of the tufts of green pine-twigs stuck behind
the arms of all the dancing men, in the broad green arm-bands.</p>
<p>Gradually come through to you the black, stable solidity of the dancing
women, who poise like solid shadow, one woman behind each rippling, leaping
male. The long, silky black hair of the women streaming down their backs, and
the equally long, streaming, gleaming hair of the males, loose over broad,
naked, orange-brown shoulders.</p>
<p>Then the faces, the impassive, rather fat, golden-brown faces of the women,
with eyes cast down, crowned above with the green tableta, like a flat tiara.
Something strange and noble about the impassive, barefoot women in the short
black cassocks, as they subtly tread the dance, scarcely moving, and yet edging
rhythmically along, swaying from each hand the green spray of pine-twig
out--out--out, to the thud of the drum, immediately behind the leaping fox-skin
of the men dancers. And all the emerald-green, painted <i>tabletas</i>, the
flat wooden tiaras shaped like a castle gateway, rise steady and noble from the
soft, slightly bowed heads of the women, held by a band under the chin. All the
<i>tabletas</i> down the line, emerald green, almost steady, while the bright
black heads of the men leap softly up and down, between.</p>
<p>Bit by bit you take it in. You cannot get a whole impression, save of some
sort of wood tossing, a little forest of trees in motion, with gleaming black
hair and gold-ruddy breasts that somehow do not destroy the illusion of
forest.</p>
<p>When you look at the women, you forget the men. The bare-armed, bare-legged,
barefoot women with streaming hair and lofty green tiaras, impassive,
downward-looking faces, twigs swaying outwards from subtle, rhythmic wrists;
women clad in the black, prehistoric short gown fastened over one shoulder,
leaving the other shoulder bare, and showing at the arm-place a bit of pink or
white undershirt; belted also round the waist with a woven woollen sash,
scarlet and green on the hand-woven black cassock. The noble, slightly
submissive bending of the tiara-ed head. The subtle measure of the hare,
breathing, bird-like feet, that are flat, and seem to cleave to earth softly,
and softly lift away. The continuous outward swaying of the pine-sprays.</p>
<p>But when you look at the men, you forget the women. The men are naked to the
waist, and ruddy-golden, and in the rhythmic hopping leap of the dance their
breasts shake downwards, as the strong, heavy body comes down, down, down,
down, in the downward plunge of the dance. The black hair streams loose and
living down their backs, the black brows are level, the black eyes look out
unchanging from under the silky lashes. They are handsome, and absorbed with a
deep rhythmic absorption, which still leaves them awake and aware. Down, down,
down they drop, on the heavy, ceaseless leap of the dance, and the great
necklaces of shell-cores spring on the naked breasts, the neck-shell flaps up
and down, the short white kilt of woven stuff, with the heavy woollen
embroidery, green and red and black, opens and shuts slightly to the strong
lifting of the knees: the heavy whitish cords that hang from the kilt-band at
the side sway and coil for ever down the side of the right leg, down to the
ankle, the bells on the red-woven garters under the knees ripple without end,
and the feet, in buckskin boots furred round the ankle with a beautiful band of
skunk fur, black with a white tip, come down with a lovely, heavy, soft
precision, first one, then the other, dropping always plumb to earth. Slightly
bending forward, a black gourd rattle in the right hand, a small green bough in
the left, the dancer dances the eternal drooping leap, that brings his life
down, down, down, down from the mind, down from the broad, beautiful shaking
breast, down to the powerful pivot of the knees, then to the ankles, and
plunges deep from the ball of the foot into the earth, towards the earth's red
centre, where these men belong, as is signified by the red earth with which
they are smeared.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, the shell-cores from the Pacific sway up and down,
ceaselessly on their breasts.</p>
<p>Mindless, without effort, under the hot sun, unceasing, yet never perspiring
nor even breathing heavily, they dance on and on. Mindless, yet still
listening, observing. They hear the deep, surging singing of the bunch of old
men, like a great wind soughing. They hear the cries and yells of the man
waving his bough by the drum. They catch the word of the song, and at a moment,
shudder the black rattles, wheel, and the line breaks, women from men, they
thread across to a new formation. And as the men wheel round, their black hair
gleams and shakes, and the long fox-skin sways, like a tail. And always, when
they form into line again, it is a beautiful long straight line, flexible as
life, but straight as rain.</p>
<p>The men round the drum are old, or elderly. They are all in a bunch, and
they wear day dress, loose cotton drawers, pink or white cotton shirt, hair
tied up behind with the red cords, and banded round the head with a strip of
pink rag, or white rag, or blue. There they are, solid like a cluster of bees,
their black heads with the pink rag circles all close together, swaying their
pine-twigs with rhythmic, wind-swept hands, dancing slightly, mostly on the
right foot, ceaselessly, and singing, their black bright eyes absorbed, their
dark lips pushed out, while the deep strong sound rushes like wind, and the
unknown words form themselves in the dark.</p>
<p>Suddenly the solitary man pounding the drum swings his drum round, and
begins to pound on the other end, on a higher note, pang--pang--pang! instead
of the previous brumm! brumm! brumm! of the bass note. The watchful man next
the drummer yells and waves lightly, dancing on bird-feet. The Koshare make
strange, eloquent gestures to the sky.</p>
<p>And again the gleaming bronze-and-dark men dancing in the rows shudder their
rattles, break the rhythm, change into a queer, beautiful two-step, the long
lines suddenly curl into rings, four rings of dancers, the leaping,
gleaming-seeming men between the solid, subtle, submissive blackness of the
women who are crowned with emerald-green tiaras, all going subtly round in
rings. Then slowly they change again, and form a star. Then again, unmingling,
they come back into rows.</p>
<p>And all the while, all the while the naked Koshare are threading about. Of
bronze-and-dark men-dancers there are some forty-two, each with a dark, crowned
woman attending him like a shadow. The old men, the bunch of singers in shirts
and tied-up black hair, are about sixty in number, or sixty-four. The Koshare
are about twenty-four.</p>
<p>They are slim and naked, daubed with black and white earth, their hair
daubed white and gathered upwards to a great knot on top of the head, whence
springs a tuft of corn-husks, dry corn-leaves. Though they wear nothing but a
little black square cloth, front and back, at their middle, they do not seem
naked, for some are white with black spots, like a leopard, and some have broad
black lines or zigzags on their smeared bodies, and all their faces are
blackened with triangle or lines till they look like weird masks. Meanwhile
their hair, gathered straight up and daubed white and sticking up from the top
of the head with corn-husks, completes the fantasy. They are anything but
natural. Like blackened ghosts of a dead corn-cob, tufted at the top.</p>
<p>And all the time, running like queer spotted dogs, they weave nakedly,
through the unheeding dance, comical, weird, dancing the dance-step naked and
fine, prancing through the lines, up and down the lines, and making fine
gestures with their flexible hands, calling something down from the sky,
calling something up from the earth, and dancing forward all the time. Suddenly
as they catch a word from the singers, name of a star, of a wind, a name for
the sun, for a cloud, their hands soar up and gather in the air, soar down with
a slow motion. And again, as they catch a word that means earth, earth deeps,
water within the earth, or red-earth-quickening, the hands flutter softly down,
and draw up the water, draw up the earth-quickening, earth to sky, sky to
earth, influences above to influences below, to meet in the germ-quick of corn,
where life is.</p>
<p>And as they dance, the Koshare watch the dancing men. And if a fox-skin is
coming loose at the belt, they fasten it as the man dances, or they stoop and
tie another man's shoe. For the dancer must not hesitate to the end.</p>
<p>And then, after some forty minutes,' the drum stops. Slowly the dancers file
into one line, woman behind man, and move away, threading towards their kiva,
with no sound but the tinkle of knee-bells in the silence.</p>
<p>But at the same moment the thud of an unseen drum, from beyond, the soughing
of deep song approaching from the unseen. It is the other half, the other half
of the tribe coming to continue the dance. They appear round the kiva--one
Koshare and one dancer leading the rows, the old men all abreast, singing
already in a great strong burst.</p>
<p>So, from ten o'clock in the morning till about four in the afternoon, first
one-half then the other. Till at last, as the day wanes, the two halves meet,
and the two singings like two great winds surge one past the other, and the
thicket of the dance becomes a real forest. It is the close of the third
day.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the men and women crowd on the roofs of the two low round
towers, the kivas, while the Koshare run round jesting and miming, and taking
big offerings from the women, loaves of bread and cakes of blue-maize meal.
Women come carrying big baskets of bread and guayava, on two hands, an
offering.</p>
<p>And the mystery of germination, not procreation, but <i>putting forth</i>,
resurrection, life springing within the seed, is accomplished. The sky has its
fire, its waters, its stars, its wandering electricity, its winds, its fingers
of cold. The earth has its reddened body, its invisible hot heart, its inner
waters and many juices and unaccountable stuffs. Between them all, the little
seed: and also man, like a seed that is busy and aware. And from the heights
and from the depths man, the caller, calls: man, the knower, brings down the
influences and brings up the influences, with his knowledge: man, so
vulnerable, so subject, and yet even in his vulnerability and subjection, a
master, commands the invisible influences and is obeyed. Commands in that song,
in that rhythmic energy of dance, in that still-submissive mockery of the
Koshare. And he accomplishes his end, as master. He partakes in the springing
of the corn, in the rising and budding and Baring of the corn. And when he eats
his bread at last, he recovers all he once sent forth, and partakes again of
the energies he called to the corn, from out of the wide universe.</p>

<h2>7 - THE HOPI SNAKE DANCE</h2>
<p>The Hopi country is in Arizona, next the Navajo country, and some seventy
miles north of the Santa F&eacute; railroad. The Hopis are Pueblo Indians,
village Indians, so their reservation is not large. It consists of a square
track of greyish, unappetizing desert, out of which rise three tall arid mesas,
broken off in ragged pallid rock. On the top of the mesas perch the ragged,
broken, greyish pueblos, identical with the mesas on which they stand.</p>
<p>The nearest village, Walpi, stands in half-ruin high, high on a narrow
rock-top where no leaf of life ever was tender. It is all grey, utterly grey,
utterly pallid stone and dust, and very narrow. Below it all the stark light of
the dry Arizona sun.</p>
<p>Walpi is called the 'first mesa'. And it is at the far edge of Walpi you see
the withered beaks and claws and bones of sacrificed eagles, in a rock-cleft
under the sky. They sacrifice an eagle each year, on the brink, by rolling him
out and crushing him so as to shed no blood. Then they drop his remains down
the dry cleft in the promontory's farthest grey tip.</p>
<p>The trail winds on, utterly bumpy and horrible, for thirty miles, past the
second mesa, where Chimopova is, on to the third mesa. And on the Sunday
afternoon of 17th August black automobile after automobile lurched and crawled
across the grey desert, where low, grey, sage-scrub was coming to pallid
yellow. Black hood followed crawling after black hood, like a funeral
cort&egrave;ge. The motor-cars, with all the tourists wending their way to the
third and farthest mesa, thirty miles across this dismal desert where an odd
water-windmill spun, and odd patches of corn blew in the strong desert wind,
like dark-green women with fringed shawls blowing and fluttering, not far from
the foot of the great, grey, up-piled mesa.</p>
<p>The snake dance (I am told) is held once a year, on each of the three mesas
in succession. This year of grace 1924 it was to be held in Hotevilla, the last
village on the farthest western tip of the third mesa.</p>
<p>On and on bumped the cars. The lonely second mesa lay in the distance. On
and on, to the ragged ghost of the third mesa.</p>
<p>The third mesa has two main villages, Oraibi, which is on the near edge, and
Hotevilla, on the far. Up scrambles the car, on all its four legs, like a
black-beetle straddling past the school-house and store down below, up the bare
rock and over the changeless boulders, with a surge and a sickening lurch to
the sky-brim, where stands the rather foolish church. Just beyond, dry, grey,
ruined, and apparently abandoned, Oraibi, its few ragged stone huts. All these
cars come all this way, and apparently nobody at home.</p>
<p>You climb still, up the shoulder of rock, a few more miles, across the
lofty, wind-swept mesa, and so you come to Hote-villa, where the dance is, and
where already hundreds of motor-cars are herded in an official camping-ground,
among the pi&ntilde;on bushes.</p>
<p>Hotevilla is a tiny little village of grey little houses, raggedly built
with undressed stone and mud around a little oblong <i>plaza</i>, and partly in
ruins. One of the chief two-storey houses on the small square is a ruin, with
big square window-holes.</p>
<p>It is a parched, grey country of snakes and eagles, pitched up against the
sky. And a few dark-faced, short, thickly built Indians have their few peach
trees among the sand, their beans and squashes on the naked sand under the sky,
their springs of brackish water.</p>
<p>Three thousand people came to see the little snake dance this year, over
miles of desert and bumps. Three thousand, of all sorts, cultured people from
New York, Californians, onward-pressing tourists, cowboys, Navajo Indians, even
Negroes; fathers, mothers, children, of all ages, colours, sizes of stoutness,
dimensions of curiosity.</p>
<p>What had they come for? Mostly to see men hold <i>live rattlesnakes</i> in
their mouths. '<i>I never did see a rattlesnake and I'm crazy to see one!</i>'
cried a girl with bobbed hair.</p>
<p>There you have it. People trail hundreds of miles, avidly, to see this
circus-performance of men handling live rattlesnakes that may bite them any
minute--even do bite them. Some show, that!</p>
<p>There is the other aspect, of the ritual dance. One may look on from the
angle of culture, as one looks on while Anna Pavlova dances with the Russian
Ballet.</p>
<p>Or there is still another point of view, the religious. Before the snake
dance begins, on the Monday, and the spectators are packed thick on the ground
round the square, and in the window-holes, and on all the roofs, all sorts of
people greedy with curiosity, a little speech is made to them all, asking the
audience to be silent and respectful, as this is a sacred religious ceremonial
of the Hopi Indians, and not a public entertainment. Therefore, please, no
clapping or cheering or applause, but remember you are, as it were, in a
church.</p>
<p>The audience accepts the implied rebuke in good faith, and looks round with
a grin at the 'church'. But it is a good-humoured, very decent crowd, ready to
respect any sort of feelings. And the Indian with his 'religion' is a sort of
public pet.</p>
<p>From the cultured point of view, the Hopi snake dance is almost nothing, not
much more than a circus turn, or the games that children play in the street. It
has none of the impressive beauty of the Corn Dance at Santo Domingo, for
example. The big pueblos of Zuni, Santo Domingo, Taos have a cultured instinct
which is not revealed in the Hopi snake dance. This last is uncouth rather than
beautiful, and rather uncouth in its touch of horror. Hence the thrill, and the
crowd.</p>
<p>As a cultured spectacle, it is a circus turn: men actually dancing round
with snakes, poisonous snakes, dangling from their mouths.</p>
<p>And as a religious ceremonial: well, you can either be politely tolerant
like the crowd to the Hopis; or you must have some spark of understanding of
the sort of religion implied.</p>
<p>'Oh, the Indians,' I heard a woman say, they believe we are all brothers,
the snakes are the Indians' brothers, and the Indians are the snakes' brothers.
The Indians would never hurt the snakes, they won't hurt any animal. So the
snakes won't bite the Indians. They are all brothers, and none of them hurt
anybody.'</p>
<p>This sounds very nice, only more Hindoo than Hopi. The dance itself does not
convey much sense of fraternal communion. It is not in the least like St
Francis preaching to the birds.</p>
<p>The animistic religion, as we call it, is not the religion of the Spirit. A
religion of spirits, yes. But not of Spirit. There is no One Spirit. There is
no One God. There is no Creator. There is strictly no God at all: because all
is alive. In our conception of religion there exists God and His Creation: two
things. We are creatures of God, therefore we pray to God as the Father, the
Saviour, the Maker.</p>
<p>But strictly, in the religion of aboriginal America, there is no Father, and
no Maker. There is the great living source of life: say the Sun of existence:
to which you can no more pray than you can pray to Electricity. And emerging
from this Sun are the great potencies, the invincible influences which make
shine and warmth and rain. From these great interrelated potencies of rain and
heat and thunder emerge the seeds of life itself, corn, and creatures like
snakes. And beyond these, men, persons. But all emerge separately. There is no
oneness, no sympathetic identifying oneself with the rest. The law of isolation
is heavy on every creature.</p>
<p>Now the Sun, the rain, the shine, the thunder, they are alive. But they are
not persons or people. They are alive. They are manifestations of living
activity. But they are not personal Gods.</p>
<p>Everything lives. Thunder lives, and rain lives, and sunshine lives. But not
in the personal sense.</p>
<p>How is man to get himself into relation with the vast living convulsions of
rain and thunder and sun, which are conscious and alive and potent, but like
vastest of beasts, inscrutable and incomprehensible. How is man to get himself
into relation with these, the vastest of cosmic beasts?</p>
<p>It is the problem of the ages of man. Our religion says the cosmos is
Matter, to be conquered by the Spirit of Man. The yogi, the fakir, the saint
try conquest by abnegation and by psychic powers. The real conquest of the
cosmos is made by science.</p>
<p>The American-Indian sees no division into Spirit and Matter, God and
not-God. Everything is alive, though not personally so. Thunder is neither Thor
nor Zeus. Thunder is the vast living thunder asserting itself like some
incomprehensible monster, or some huge reptile-bird of the pristine cosmos.</p>
<p>How to conquer the dragon-mouthed thunder! How to capture the feathered
rain!</p>
<p>We make reservoirs, and irrigation ditches and artesian wells. We make
lightning conductors, and build vast electric plants. We say it is a matter of
science, energy, force.</p>
<p>But the Indian says No! It all lives. We must approach it fairly, with
profound respect, but also with desperate courage. Because man must conquer the
cosmic monsters of living thunder and live rain. The rain that slides down from
its source, and ebbs back subtly, with a strange energy generated between its
coming and going, an energy which, even to our science, is of life: this, man
has to conquer. The serpent-striped, feathery Rain.</p>
<p>We made the conquest by dams and reservoirs and windmills. The Indian, like
the old Egyptian, seeks to make the conquest from the mystic will within him,
pitted against the Cosmic Dragon.</p>
<p>We must remember, to the animistic vision there is no perfect God behind us,
who created us from his knowledge, and foreordained all things. No such God.
Behind lies only the terrific, terrible, crude Source, the mystic Sun, the
well-head of all things. From this mystic Sun emanate the Dragons, Rain, Wind,
Thunder Shine, Light. The Potencies of Powers. These bring forth Earth, then
reptiles, birds, and fishes.</p>
<p>The Potencies are not Gods. They are Dragons. The Sun of Creation itself is
a dragon most terrible, vast, and most powerful, yet even so, less in being
than we. The only gods on earth are men. For gods, like man, do not exist
beforehand. They are created and evolved gradually, with aeons of effort, out
of the fire and smelting of life. They are the highest thing created, smelted
between the furnace of the Life-Sun, and beaten on the anvil of the rain, with
hammers or thunder and bellows of rushing wind. The cosmos is a great furnace,
a dragon's den, where the heroes and demi-gods, men, forge themselves into
being. It is a vast and violent matrix, where souls form like diamonds in
earth, under extreme pressure.</p>
<p>So that gods are the outcome, not the origin. And the best gods that have
resulted, so far, are men. But gods frail as flowers; which have also the
godliness of things that have won perfection out of the terrific dragon-clutch
of the cosmos. Men are frail as flowers. Man is as a flower, rain can kill him
or succour him, heat can flick him with a bright tail, and destroy him: or, on
the other hand, it can softly call him into existence, out of the egg of chaos.
Man is delicate as a flower, godly beyond flowers, and his lordship is a
ticklish business.</p>
<p>He has to conquer, and hold his own, and again conquer all the time. Conquer
the powers of the cosmos. To us, science is our religion of conquest. Hence
through science, we are the conquerors and resultant gods of our earth. But to
the Indian, the so-called mechanical processes do not exist. All lives. And the
conquest is made by the means of the living will.</p>
<p>This is the religion of all aboriginal America. Peruvian, Aztec, Athabascan:
perhaps the aboriginal religion of all the word. In Mexico, men fell into
horror of the crude, pristine gods, the dragons. But to the pueblo Indian, the
most terrible dragon is still somewhat gentle-hearted.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the Hopi. He has the hardest task, the stubbornest
destiny. Some inward fate drove him to the top of these parched mesas, all
rocks and eagles, sand and snakes, and wind and sun and alkali. These he had to
conquer. Not merely, as we should put it, the natural conditions of the place.
But the mysterious life-spirit that reigned there. The eagle and the snake.</p>
<p>It is a destiny as well as another. The destiny of the animistic soul of
man, instead of our destiny of Mind and Spirit. We have undertaken the
scientific conquest of forces, of natural conditions. It has been comparatively
easy, and we are victors. Look at our black motor-cars like beetles working up
the rock-face at Oraibi. Look at our three thousand tourists gathered to gaze
at the twenty lonely men who dance in the tribe's snake dance!</p>
<p>The Hopi sought the conquest by means of the mystic, living will that is in
man, pitted against the living will of the dragon-cosmos. The Egyptians long
ago made a partial conquest by the same means. We have made a partial conquest
by other means. Our corn doesn't fail us: we have no seven years' famine, and
apparently need never have. But the other thing fails us, the strange inward
sun of life; the pellucid monster of the rain never shows us his stripes. To
us, heaven switches on daylight, or turns on the shower-bath. We little gods
are gods of the machine only. It is our highest. Our cosmos is a great
<i>ennui</i>. And we die of ennui. A subtle dragon stings us in the midst of
plenty. <i>Quos vult perdere Deus, dementat prius</i>.</p>
<p>On the Sunday evening is a first little dance in the plaza at Hotevilla,
called the Antelope dance. There is the hot, sandy, oblong little place, with a
tuft of green cotton-wood boughs stuck like a plume at the south end, and on
the floor at the foot of the green, a little lid of a trap-door. They say the
snakes are under there.</p>
<p>They say that the twelve officiating men of the snake clan of the tribe have
for nine days been hunting snakes in the rocks. They have been performing the
mysteries for nine days, in the kiva, and for two days they have fasted
completely. All these days they have tended the snakes, washed them with
repeated lustrations, soothed them, and exchanged spirits with them. The spirit
of man soothing and seeking and making interchange with the spirits of the
snakes. For the snakes are more rudimentary, nearer to the great convulsive
powers. Nearer to the nameless Sun, more knowing in the slanting tracks of the
rain, the pattering of the invisible feet of the rain-monster from the sky. The
snakes are man's next emissaries to the rain-gods. The snakes lie nearer to the
source of potency, the dark, lurking, intense sun at the centre of the earth.
For to the cultured animist, and the pueblo Indian is such, the earth's dark
centre holds its dark sun, our source of isolated being, round which our world
coils its folds like a great snake. The snake is nearer the dark sun, and
cunning of it.</p>
<p>They say--people say--that rattlesnakes are not travellers. They haunt the
same spots on earth, and die there. It is said also that the snake priest
(so-called) of the Hopi probably capture the same snakes year after year.</p>
<p>Be that as it may. At sundown before the real dance, there is the little
dance called the Antelope Dance. We stand and wait on a house-roof. Behind us
is tethered an eagle; rather dishevelled he sits on the coping, and looks at us
in unutterable resentment. See him, and see how much 'brotherhood' the Indian
feels with animals--at best the silent tolerance that acknowledges dangerous
difference. We wait without event. There are no drums, no announcements.
Suddenly into the <i>plaza</i>, with rude, intense movements, hurried a little
file of men. They are smeared all with grey and black, and are naked save for
little kilts embroidered like the sacred dance-kilts in other pueblos, red and
green and black on a white fibre-cloth. The fox-skins hangs behind. The feet of
the dancers are pure ash-grey. Their hair is long.</p>
<p>The first is a heavy old man with heavy, long, wild grey hair and heavy
fringe. He plods intensely forward in the silence, followed in a sort of circle
by the other grey-smeared, longhaired, naked, concentrated men. The oldest men
are first: the last is a short-haired boy of fourteen or fifteen. There are
only eight men--the so-called antelope priests. They pace round in a circle,
rudely, absorbedly, till the first heavy, intense old man with his massive grey
hair flowing, comes to the lid on the ground, near the tuft of kiva-boughs. He
rapidly shakes from the hollow of his right hand a little white meal on the
lid, stamps heavily, with naked right foot, on the meal, so the wood resounds,
and paces heavily forward. Each man, to the boy, shakes meal, stamps, paces
absorbedly on in the circle, comes to the lid again, shakes meal, stamps, paces
absorbedly on, comes a third time to the lid, or trap-door, and this time spits
on the lid, stamps, and goes on. And this time the eight men file away behind
the lid, between it and the tuft of green boughs. And there they stand in a
line, their backs to the kivatuft of green; silent, absorbed, bowing a little
to the ground.</p>
<p>Suddenly paces with rude haste another file of men. They are naked, and
smeared with red 'medicine', with big black lozenges of smeared paint on their
backs. Their wild heavy hair hangs loose, the old, heavy, grey-haired men go
first, then the middle-aged, then the young men, then last, two short-haired,
slim boys, schoolboys. The hair of the young men, growing after school, is
bobbed round.</p>
<p>The grown men are all heavily built, rather short, with heavy but shapely
flesh, and rather straight sides. They have not the archaic slim waists of the
Taos Indians. They have archaic squareness, and a sensuous heaviness. Their
very hair is black, massive, heavy. These are the so-called snake-priests, men
of the snake clan. And tonight they are eleven in number.</p>
<p>They pace rapidly round, with that heavy wild silence of concentration
characteristic of them, and cast meal and stamp upon the lid, cast meal and
stamp in the second round, come round and spit and stamp in the third. For to
the savage, the animist, to spit may be a kind of blessing, a communion, a sort
of embrace.</p>
<p>The eleven snake-priests form silently in a row, facing the eight grey
smeared antelope-priests across the little lid, and bowing forward a little, to
earth. Then the antelope-priests, bending forward, begin a low, sombre chant,
or call, that sounds wordless, only a deep, low-toned, secret Ay-a! Ay-a! Ay-a!
And they bend from right to left, giving two shakes to the little, flat, white
rattle in their left hand, at each shake, and stamping the right foot in heavy
rhythm. In their right hand, that held the meal, is grasped a little skin bag,
perhaps also containing meal.</p>
<p>They lean from right to left, two seed-like shakes of the rattle each time
and the heavy rhythmic stamp of the foot, and the low, sombre, secretive
chant-call each time. It is a strange low sound, such as we never hear, and it
reveals how deep, how deep the men are in the mystery they are practising, how
sunk deep below our world, to the world of snakes, and dark ways in the earth,
where the roots of corn, and where the little rivers of unchannelled, uncreated
life-passion run like dark, trickling lightning, to the roots of the corn and
to the feet and loins of men, from the earth's innermost dark sun. They are
calling in the deep, almost silent snake-language, to the snakes and the rays
of dark emission from the earth's inward 'Sun'.</p>
<p>At this moment, a silence falls on the whole crowd of listeners. It is that
famous darkness and silence of Egypt, the touch of the other mystery. The deep
concentration of the 'priests' conquers for a few seconds our white-faced
flippancy, and we hear only the deep Hah-h&agrave;! Hah-ha! speaking to snakes
and the earth's inner core.</p>
<p>This lasts a minute or two. Then the antelope-priests stand bowed and still,
and the snake-priests take up the swaying and the deep chant, that sometimes is
so low, it is like a mutter underground, inaudible. The rhythm is crude, the
swaying unison is all uneven. Culturally, there is nothing. If it were not for
that mystic, dark-sacred concentration.</p>
<p>Several times in turn, the two rows of daubed, long-haired, insunk men
facing one another take up the swaying and the chant. Then that too is
finished. There is a break in the formation. A young snake-priest takes up
something that may be a corn-cob--perhaps an antelope-priest hands it to
him--and comes forward, with an old, heavy, but still shapely snake-priest
behind him dusting his shoulders with the feathers, eagle-feathers presumably,
which are the Indians' hollow prayer-sticks. With the heavy, stamping hop they
move round in the previous circle, the young priest holding the cob curiously,
and the old priest prancing strangely at the young priest's hack, in a sort of
incantation, and brushing the heavy young shoulders delicately with the
prayer-feathers. It is the God-vibration that enters us from behind, and is
transmitted to the hands, from the hands to the corn-cob. Several young priests
emerge, with the bowed heads and the cob in their hands and the heavy older
priests hanging over them behind. They tread round the rough curve and come
back to the kiva, take perhaps another cob, and tread round again.</p>
<p>That is all. In ten or fifteen minutes it is over. The two files file
rapidly and silently away. A brief, primitive performance.</p>
<p>The crowd disperses. They were not many people. There were no venomous
snakes on exhibition, so the mass had nothing to come for. And therefore the
curious immersed intensity of the priests was able to conquer the white
crowd.</p>
<p>By afternoon of the next day the three thousand people had massed in the
little <i>plaza</i>, secured themselves places on the roof and in the
window-spaces, everywhere, till the small pueblo seemed built of people instead
of stones. All sorts of people, hundreds and hundreds of white women, all in
breeches like half-men, hundreds and hundreds of men who had been driving
motor-cars, then many Navajos, the women in their full, long skirts and tight
velvet bodices, the men rather lanky, long-waisted, real nomads. In the hot sun
and the wind which blows the sand every day, every day in volumes round the
corners, the three thousand tourists sat for hours, waiting for the show. The
Indian policeman cleared the central oblong, in front of the kiva. The front
rows of onlookers sat thick on the ground. And at last, rather early, because
of the masses awaiting them, suddenly, silently, in the same rude haste, the
antelope-priests filed absorbedly in, and made the rounds over the lid, as
before. Today, the eight antelope-priests were very grey. Their feet ashed pure
grey, like su&egrave;de soft boots: and their lower jaw was pure su&egrave;de
grey, while the rest of their face was blackish. With that pale-grey jaw, they
looked like corpse-faces with swathing-bands. And all their bodies ash-grey
smeared, with smears of black, and a black cloth today at the loins.</p>
<p>They made their rounds, and took their silent position behind the lid, with
backs to the green tuft: an unearthly grey row of men with little skin bags in
their hands. They were the lords of shadow, the intermediate twilight, the
place of afterlife and before-life, where house the winds of change. Lords of
the mysterious, fleeting power of change.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with abrupt silence, in paced the snake-priests, headed by the
same heavy man with solid grey hair like iron. Today they were twelve men, from
the old one, down to the slight, short-haired, erect boy of fourteen. Twelve
men, two for each of the six worlds, or quarters: east, north, south, west,
above, and below. And today they were in a queer ecstasy. Their faces were
black, showing the whites of the eyes. And they wore small black loin-aprons.
They were the hot living men of the darkness, lords of the earth's inner rays,
the black sun of the earth's vital core, from which dart the speckled snakes,
like beams.</p>
<p>Round they went, in rapid, uneven, silent absorption, the three rounds. Then
in a row they faced the eight ash-grey men, across the lid. All kept their
heads bowed towards earth, except the young boys.</p>
<p>Then, in the intense, secret, muttering chant the grey men began their
leaning from right to left, shaking the hand, one-two, one-two, and bowing the
body each time from right to left, left to right, above the lid in the ground,
under which were the snakes. And their low, deep, mysterious voices spoke to
the spirits under the earth, not to men above the earth.</p>
<p>But the crowd was on tenterhooks for the snakes, and could hardly wait for
the mummery to cease. There was an atmosphere of inattention and impatience.
But the chant and the swaying passed from the grey men to the black-faced men,
and back again, several times.</p>
<p>This was finished. The formation of the lines broke up. There was a slight
crowding to the centre, round the lid. The old antelope-priest (so called) was
stooping. And before the crowd could realize anything else a young priest
emerged, bowing reverently, with the neck of a pale, delicate rattlesnake held
between his teeth, the little, na&iuml;ve, bird-like head of the rattlesnake
quite still, near the black cheek, and the long, pale, yellowish, spangled body
of the snake dangling like some thick, beautiful cord. On passed the
black-faced young priest, with the wondering snake dangling from his mouth,
pacing in the original circle, while behind him, leaping almost on his
shoulders, was the oldest heavy priest, dusting the young man's shoulders with
the feather-prayer-sticks, in an intense, earnest anxiety of concentration such
as I have only seen in the old Indian men during a religious dance.</p>
<p>Came another young black-faced man out of the confusion, with another snake
dangling and writhing a little from his mouth, and an elder priest dusting him
from behind with the feathers: and then another, and another: till it was all
confusion, probably, of six, and then four young priests with snakes dangling
from their mouths, going round, apparently, three times in the circle. At the
end of the third round the young priest stooped and delicately laid his snake
on the earth, waving him away, away, as it were, into the world. He must not
wriggle back to the kiva bush.</p>
<p>And after wondering a moment, the pale, delicate snake steered away with a
rattlesnake's beautiful movement, rippling and looping, with the small,
sensitive head lifted like antennae, across the sand to the massed audience
squatting solid on the ground around. Like soft, watery lightning went the
wondering snake at the crowd. As he came nearer, the people began to shrink
aside, half-mesmerized. But they betrayed no exaggerated fear. And as the
little snake drew very near, up rushed one of the two black-faced young priests
who held the snake-stick, poised a moment over the snake, in the
prayer-concentration of reverence which is at the same time conquest, and
snatched the pale, long creature delicately from the ground, waving him in a
swoop over the heads of the seated crowd, then delicately smoothing down the
length of the snake with his left hand, stroking and smoothing and soothing the
long, pale, bird-like thing; and returning with it to the kiva, handed it to
one of the grey-jawed antelope-priests.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all the time, the other young priests were emerging with a snake
dangling from their mouths. The boy had finished his rounds. He launched his
rattlesnake on the ground, like a ship, and like a ship away it steered. In a
moment, after it went one of those two black-faced priests who carried
snake-sticks and were the snake-catchers. As it neared the crowd, very close,
he caught it up and waved it dramatically, his eyes glaring strangely out of
his black face. And in the interim that youngest boy had been given a long,
handsome bull-snake, by the priest at the hole under the kiva boughs. The
bull-snake is not poisonous. It is a constrictor. This one was six feet long,
with a sumptuous pattern. It waved its pale belly, and pulled its neck out of
the boy's mouth. With two hands he put it back. It pulled itself once more
free. Again he got it back, and managed to hold it. And then as he went round
in his looping circle, it coiled its handsome folds twice round his knee. He
stooped, quietly, and as quietly as if he were untying his garter, he unloosed
the folds. And all the time, an old priest was intently brushing the boy's thin
straight shoulders with the feathers. And all the time, the snakes seemed
strangely gentle, na&iuml;ve, wondering and almost willing, almost in harmony
with the man. Which of course was the sacred aim. While the boy's expression
remained quite still and simple, as it were candid, in a candour where he and
the snake should be in unison. The only dancers who showed signs of being
wrought-up were the two young snake-catchers, and one of these, particularly,
seemed in a state of actor-like uplift, rather ostentatious. But the old
priests had that immersed, religious intentness which is like a spell,
something from another world.</p>
<p>The young boy launched his bull-snake. It wanted to go back to the kiva. The
snake-catcher drove it gently forward. Away it went, towards the crowd, and at
the last minute was caught up into the air. Then this snake was handed to an
old man sitting on the ground in the audience, in the front row. He was an old
Hopi of the Snake clan.</p>
<p>Snake after snake had been carried round in the circles, dangling by the
neck from the mouths of one young priest or another, and writhing and swaying
slowly, with the small, delicate snake-head held as if wondering and listening.
There had been some very large rattlesnakes, unusually large, two or three
handsome bull-snakes, and some racers, whipsnakes. All had been launched, after
their circuits in the mouth, all had been caught up by the young priests with
the snake-sticks, one or two had been handed to old-snake clan men in the
audience, who sat holding them in their arms as men hold a kitten. The most of
the snakes, however, had been handed to the grey antelope-men who stood in the
row with their backs to the kiva bush. Till some of these ash-smeared men held
armfuls of snakes, hanging over their arms like wet washing. Some of the snakes
twisted and knotted round one another, showing pale bellies.</p>
<p>Yet most of them hung very still and docile. Docile, almost sympathetic, so
that one was struck only by their clean, slim length of snake nudity, their
beauty, like soft, quiescent lightning. They were so clean, because they had
been washed and anointed and lustrated by the priests, in the days they had
been in the kiva.</p>
<p>At last all the snakes had been mouth-carried in the circuits, and had made
their little outrunning excursion to the crowd, and had been handed back to the
priests in the rear. And now the Indian policemen, Hopi and Navajo, began to
clear away the crowd that sat on the ground, five or six rows deep, around the
small <i>plaza</i>. The snakes were all going to be set free on the ground. We
must clear away.</p>
<p>We recoiled to the farther end of the <i>plaza</i>. There, two Hopi women
were scattering white corn-meal on the sandy ground. And thither came the two
snake-catchers, almost at once, with their arms full of snakes. And before we
who stood had realized it, the snakes were all writhing and squirming on the
ground, in the white dust of meal, a couple of yards from our feet. Then
immediately, before they could writhe clear of each other and steer away, they
were gently, swiftly snatched up again, and with their arms full of snakes, the
two young priests went running out of the <i>plaza</i>.</p>
<p>We followed slowly, wondering, towards the western, or north-western edge of
the mesa. There the mesa dropped steeply, and a broad trail wound down to the
vast hollow of desert brimmed up with strong evening light, up out of which
jutted a perspective of sharp rock and further mesas and distant sharp
mountains: the great, hollow, rock-wilderness space of that part of Arizona,
submerged in light.</p>
<p>Away down the trail, small, dark, naked, rapid figures with arms held close,
went the two young men, running swiftly down to the hollow level, and
diminishing, running across the hollow towards more stark rocks of the other
side. Two small, rapid, intent, dwindling little human figures. The tiny, dark
sparks of men. Such specks of gods.</p>
<p>They disappeared, no bigger than stones, behind rocks in shadow. They had
gone, it was said, to lay down the snakes before a rock called the
snake-shrine, and let them all go free. Free to carry the message and thanks to
the dragon-gods who can give and withhold. To carry the human spirit, the human
breath, the human prayer, the human gratitude, the human command which had been
breathed upon them in the mouths of the priests, transferred into them from
those feather-prayersticks which the old wise men swept upon the shoulders of
the young, snake-bearing men, to carry this back, into the vaster, dimmer,
inchoate regions where the monsters of rain and wind alternated in beneficence
and wrath. Carry the human prayer and will-power into the holes of the winds,
down into the octopus heart of the rain-source. Carry the corn-meal which the
women had scattered, back to that terrific, dread, and causeful dark sun which
is at the earth's core, that which sends us corn out of the earth's nearness,
sends us food or death, according to our strength of vital purpose, our power
of sensitive will, our courage.</p>
<p>It is a battle, a wrestling all the time. The Sun, the nameless Sun, source
of all things, which we call sun because the other name is too fearful, this,
this vast dark protoplasmic sun from which issues all that feeds our life, this
original One is all the time willing and unwilling. Systole, diastole, it
pulses its willingness and its unwillingness that we should live and move on,
from being to being, manhood to further manhood. Man, small, vulnerable man,
the farthest adventurer from the dark heart of the first of suns, into the
cosmos of creation. Man, the last god won into existence. And all the time, he
is sustained and threated, menaced and sustained from the Source, the innermost
sun-dragon. And all the time, he must submit and he must conquer. Submit to the
strange beneficence from the Source, whose ways are past finding out. And
conquer the strange malevolence of the Source, which is past comprehension
also.</p>
<p>For the great dragons from which we draw our vitality are all the time
willing and unwilling that we should have being. Hence only the heroes snatch
manhood, little by little, from the strange den of the Cosmos.</p>
<p>Man, little man, with his consciousness and his will, must both submit to
the great origin-powers of his life, and conquer them. Conquered by man who has
overcome his fears, the snakes must go back into the earth with his messages of
tenderness, of request, and of power. They go back as rays of love to the dark
heart of the first of suns. But they go back also as arrows shot clean by man's
sapience and courage, into the resistant, malevolent heart of the earth's
oldest, stubborn core. In the core of the first of suns, whence man draws his
vitality, lies poison as bitter as the rattlesnake's. This poison man must
overcome, he must be master of its issue. Because from the first of suns come
travelling the rays that make men strong and glad and gods who can range
between the known and the unknown. Rays that quiver out of the earth as
serpents do, naked with vitality. But each ray charged with poison for the
unwary, the irreverent, and the cowardly. Awareness, wariness, is the first
virtue in primitive man's morality. And his awareness must travel back and
forth, back and forth, from the darkest origins out to the brightest edifices
of creation.</p>
<p>And amid all its crudity, and the sensationalism which comes chiefly out of
the crowd's desire for thrills, one cannot help pausing in reverence before the
delicate, anointed bravery of the snake-priests (so called), with the
snakes.</p>
<p>They say the Hopis have a marvellous secret cure for snakebites. They say
the bitten are given an emetic drink, after the dance, by the old women, and
that they must lie on the edge of the cliff and vomit, vomit, vomit. I saw none
of this. The two snake-men who ran down into the shadow came soon running up
again, running all the while, and steering off at a tangent, ran up the mesa
once more, but beyond a deep, impassable cleft. And there, when they had come
up to our level, we saw them across the cleft distance washing, brown and
naked, in a pool; washing off the paint, the medicine, the ecstasy, to come
back into daily life and eat food. Because for two days they had eaten nothing,
it was said. And for nine days they had been immersed in the mystery of snakes,
and fasting in some measure.</p>
<p>Men who have lived many years among the Indians say they do not believe the
Hopi have any secret cure. Sometimes priests do die of bites, it is said. But a
rattlesnake secretes his poison slowly. Each time he strikes he loses his
venom, until if he strikes several times, he has very little wherewithal to
poison a man. Not enough, not half enough to kill. His glands must be very full
charged with poison, as they are when he merges from winter-sleep, before he
can kill a man outright. And even then, he must strike near some artery.</p>
<p>Therefore, during the nine days of the kiva, when the snakes are bathed and
lustrated, perhaps they strike their poison away into some inanimate object.
And surely they are soothed and calmed with such things as the priests, after
centuries of experience, know how to administer to them.</p>
<p>We dam the Nile and take the railway across America. The Hopi smooths the
rattlesnake and carries him in his mouth, to send him back into the dark places
of the earth, an emissary to the inner powers.</p>
<p>To each sort of man his own achievement, his own victory, his own conquest.
To the Hopi, the origins are dark and dual, cruelty is coiled in the very
beginnings of all things, and circle after circle creation emerges towards a
flickering, revealed Godhead. With Man as the godhead so far achieved,
waveringly and for ever incomplete, in this world.</p>
<p>To us and to the Orientals, the Godhead was perfect to start with, and man
makes but a mechanical excursion into a created and ordained universe, an
excursion of mechanical achievement, and of yearning for the return to the
perfect Godhead of the beginning.</p>
<p>To us, God was in the beginning, Paradise and the Golden Age have been long
lost, and all we can do is to win back.</p>
<p>To the Hopi, God is not yet, and the Golden Age lies far ahead. Out of the
dragon's den of the cosmos, we have wrested only the beginnings of our being,
the rudiments of our Godhead.</p>
<p>Between the two visions lies the gulf of mutual negations. But ours was the
quickest way, so we are conquerors for the moment.</p>
<p>The American aborigines are radically, innately religious. The fabric of
their life is religion. But their religion is animistic, their sources are dark
and impersonal, their conflict with their 'gods' is slow, and unceasing.</p>
<p>This is true of the settled pueblo Indian and the wandering Navajo, the
ancient Maya, and the surviving Aztec. They are all involved at every moment,
in their old, struggling religion.</p>
<p>Until they break in a kind of hopelessness under our cheerful, triumphant
success. Which is what is rapidly happening. The young Indians who have been to
school for many years are losing their religion, becoming discontented, bored,
and rootless. An Indian with his own religion inside him cannot be bored. The
flow of the mystery is too intense all the time, too intense, even, for him to
adjust himself to circumstances from the darkest origins out to the brightest
edifices of creation.</p>

bored. The flow of the mystery is too intense all the time, too intense, even,
for him to adjust himself to circumstances which really are mechanical. Hence
his failure. So he, in his great religious struggle for the Godhead of man,
falls back beaten. The Personal God who ordained a mechanical cosmos gave the
victory to his sons, a mechanical triumph.</p>
<p>Soon after the dance is over, the Navajo begin to ride down the Western
trail, into the light. Their women, with velvet bodices and full, full skirts,
silver and turquoise tinkling thick on their breasts, sit back on their horses
and ride down the steep slope, looking wonderingly around from their pleasant,
broad, nomadic, Mongolian faces. And the men, long, loose, thin, long-waisted,
with tall hats on their brows and low-sunk silver belts on their hips, come
down to water their horses at the spring. We say they look wild. But they have
the remoteness of their religion, their animistic vision, in their eyes, they
can't see as we see. And they cannot accept us. They stare at us as the coyotes
stare at us: the gulf of mutual negation between us.</p>
<p>So in groups, in pairs, singly, they ride silently down into the lower
strata of light, the aboriginal Americans riding into their shut-in
reservations. While the white Americans hurry back to their motor-cars, and
soon the air buzzes with starting engines, like the biggest of rattlesnakes
buzzing.</p>

<h2>8 - A LITTLE MOONSHINE WITH LEMON</h2>
<p>'Ye Gods, he doth bestride the narrow world<br>
Like a Colossus...!'</p>
<p>There is a bright moon, so that even the vines make a shadow, and the
Mediterranean has a broad white shimmer between its dimness. By the shore, the
lights of the old houses twinkle quietly, and out of the wall of the headland
advances the glare of a locomotive's lamps. It is a feast day, St Catherine's
Day, and the men are all sitting round the little tables, down below, drinking
wine or vermouth.</p>
<p>And what about the ranch, the little ranch in New Mexico? The time is
different there: but I too have drunk my glass to St Catherine, so I can't be
bothered to reckon. I consider that there, too, the moon is in the south-east,
standing, as it were, over Santa F&eacute;, beyond the bend of those mountains
of Picoris.</p>
<p><i>Sono io!</i> say the Italians. I am I! Which sounds simpler than it
is.</p>
<p>Because which I am I, after all, now that I have drunk a glass also to St
Catherine, and the moon shines over the sea, and my thoughts, just because they
are fleetingly occupied by the moon on the Mediterranean, and ringing with the
last farewell: <i>Dunque, Signore! di nuovo</i>!--must needs follow the
moon-track south-west, to the great South-west, where the ranch is.</p>
<p>They say: <i>in vino veritas</i>. Bah! They say so much! But in the wine of
St Catherine, my little ranch, and the three horses down among the timber. Or
if it has snowed, the horses are gone away, and it is snow, and the moon shines
on the alfalfa slope, between the pines, and the cabins are blind. There is
nobody there. Everything shut up. Only the big pine tree in front of the house,
standing still and unconcerned, alive.</p>
<p>Perhaps when I have a <i>Weh</i> at all, my <i>Heimweh</i> is for the tree
in front of the house, the overshadowing tree whose green top one never looks
at. But on the trunk one hangs the various odds and ends of iron things. It is
so near. One goes out of the door, and the tree-trunk is there, like a guardian
angel.</p>
<p>The tree-trunk, and the long work table, and the fence! Then beyond, since
it is night, and the moon shines, for me at least, away beyond is a light, at
Taos, or at Ranchos de Taos. Here, the castle of Noli is on the western
skyline. But there, no doubt it has snowed, since even here the wind is cold.
There it has snowed, and the nearly full moon blazes wolf-like, as here it
never blazes; risen like a were-wolf over the mountains. So there is a faint
hoar shagginess of pine trees, away at the foot of the alfalfa field, and a
grey gleam of snow in the night, on the level desert, and a ruddy point of
human light, in Ranchos de Taos.</p>
<p>And beyond, you see them even if you don't see them, the circling mountains,
since there is a moon.</p>
<p>So, one hurries indoors, and throws more logs on the fire.</p>
<p>One doesn't either. One hears Giovanni calling from below, to say
good-night! He is going down to the village for a spell. <i>Vado gi&ugrave;
Signor Lorenzo! Buona notte!</i></p>
<p>And the Mediterranean whispers in the distance, a sound like in a shell. And
save that somebody is whistling, the night is very bright and still. The
Mediterranean, so eternally young, the very symbol of youth! And Italy, so
reputedly old, yet for ever so child-like and na&iuml;ve! Never, never for a
moment able to comprehend the wonderful, hoary age of America, the continent of
the afterwards.</p>
<p>I wonder if I am here, or if I am just going to bed at the ranch. Perhaps
looking in Montgomery Ward's catalogue for something for Christmas, and
drinking moonshine and hot water, since it is cold. Go out and look if the
chickens are shut up warm: if the horses are in sight: if Susan, the black cow,
has gone to her nest among the trees, for the night. Cows don't eat much at
night. But Susan will wander in the moon. The moon makes her uneasy. And the
horses stamp around the cabins.</p>
<p>In a cold like this, the stars snap like distant coyotes, beyond the moon.
And you'll see the shadow of actual coyotes, going across the alfalfa field.
And the pine trees make little noises, sudden and stealthy, as if they were
walking about. And the place heaves with ghosts. That place, the ranch, heaves
with ghosts. But when one has got used to one's own home-ghosts, be they never
so many, and so potent, they are like one's own family, but nearer than the
blood. It is the ghosts one misses most, the ghosts there, of the Rocky
Mountains, that never go beyond the timber and that linger, like the animals,
round the water-spring. I know them, they know me: we go well together. But
they reproach me for going away. They are resentful too.</p>
<p>Perhaps the snow is in tufts on the greasewood bushes. Perhaps the blue jay
falls in a blue metallic cloud out of the pine trees in front of the house, at
dawn, in the terrific cold, when the dangerous light comes watchful over the
mountains, and touches the desert far-off, far-off, beyond the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>And I, I give it up. There is a choice of vermouth, Marsala, red wine or
white. At the ranch, tonight, because it is cold, I should have moonshine, not
very good moonshine, but still warming: with hot water and lemon, and sugar,
and a bit of cinnamon from one of those little red Schilling's tins. And I
should light my little stove in the bedroom, and let it roar a bit, sucking the
wind. Then dark to bed, with all the ghosts of the ranch cosily round me, and
sleep till the very coldness of my emerged nose wakes me. Waking, I shall look
at once through the glass panels of the bedroom door, and see the trunk of the
great pine tree, like a person on guard, and a low star just coming over the
mountain, very brilliant, like someone swinging an electric lantern.</p>
<p><i>Si vedr&agrave; la primavera.</i></p>
<p><i>Fiorann' i mandorlini</i>--</p>
<p>Ah, well, let it be vermouth, since there's no moonshine with lemon and
cinnamon. Supposing I called Giovanni, and told him I wanted:</p>
<p>'<i>Un poco di chiar' di luna, con canella e limone...</i>'</p>
