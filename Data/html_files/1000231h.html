<h2>CHAPTER I.&mdash;The Shadow.</h2>
<p>Hubert Grant stood on the veranda looking over the garden at Ledge Point.
Just for the moment he was glad enough to be alone. He wanted to stand there
and contemplate his new possession. Everything there was his&mdash;the rainbow
trout in the pool in the Dutch garden, the starry flowers of the anemones in
the larch woods behind the house. And he had paid for it all with his own
hard-earned money!</p>
<p>Ledge Point was his ideal of what a country retreat should be. The house was
modern, no doubt, but the fact had its advantages, and the rambling white front
was covered with a tender green that presently would bear its tribute of
blossoms. The big houseplace opened on two sides into a conservatory where the
flowers gleamed all the year round. Here were treasures of oak and china and
silver gathered by the late owner for many years. To the left was a cosy study;
on the right a drawing-room in white and carmine charmingly furnished. Grant's
eyes softened a little as he thought of the drawing-room. May Leverton would be
presiding over that some of these early days.</p>
<p>Grant had bought the place as much for her as for himself. He had purchased
it only a few days before just as it stood, from his partner old Paul Spencer,
and he had paid for it with a cheque drawn upon his own private account.</p>
<p>"I'm selling it you cheap," Mr. Spencer had said. "Four thousand pounds is
very little. The house cost more than that, to say nothing of the furniture.
Ledge Point has been a hobby of mine, as you know, but I shall not need it any
more. My doctor tells me that I must live almost entirely in the South of
France in future. That means practically giving the whole control of the
business into your hands, Grant."</p>
<p>"No hurry for that, sir," Grant hastened to say.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not. But still it has to be done. We must have a big talk over the
money side of affairs before long. I've always looked after the money
department, as you know. That was part of our original contract. Why, for all
you may know to the contrary, the firm of Spencer and Grant may be on the verge
of bankruptcy."</p>
<p>Hubert Grant smiled at the suggestion. "I certainly have not worried about
that," he said. "There is nobody whose name for sound finance stands higher
than yours."</p>
<p>"All the same, you will have to know very shortly, Grant. You are inclined
to trust people just a little too far. For instance, it would have been far
wiser if you had refrained from paying me for this place till after the
conveyance was signed. If anything went wrong with me you would simply lose
your money."</p>
<p>Grant smiled again. He was not in a business mood at that moment.</p>
<p>"After all, one can't live entirely without sentiment," he said. "I had a
whim to call this place mine. And if I can't trust you, who am I to put my
faith in?"</p>
<p>"You have some thought of getting married, I suppose?"</p>
<p>Grant's face flushed slightly. The lines about his square firm jaw hardened.
His was not exactly a handsome face, but the regular features were attractive.
He had, moreover, that suggestion of physical and moral strength that goes so
far with most women. They know by instinct that here was a man who would not
fail in the hour of trial, who would stand before the world with a front of
brass. He stood upon the veranda in fine contract to his companion.</p>
<p>"I am going to be married," he said. "There are reasons why the matter must
be kept a secret for the present, and therefore I am telling you this much in
confidence. When the time comes I am going to marry the daughter of Sir Bruce
Leverton."</p>
<p>A smile, quick, elusive, sinister almost, crossed Paul Spencer's face. He
huddled up in a big deck chair sunning himself on the balcony, he was a little,
dried-up man, with a skin like badly tanned leather, his high yellow forehead
was bald, he had long ropy hands that trembled as he carried a cigar to his
lips. Yet, despite his age, his teeth were wonderfully sound and firm, his eyes
shrewd and clear. He had a way of laughing to himself in a sardonic fashion;
much as he loved company, he was as secretive as an oyster as to his own
affairs. He passed more or less as an invalid, yet on occasions he should sit
at the bridge table till daylight. He would take out a gun, protesting that a
walk of a mile was dangerous to him, yet at the end of a day over the moors he
was as fresh as any of them. And he was reported to be worth a million of
money.</p>
<p>Who he was and where he came from nobody knew. He had no relations, he
managed the financial side of the business, and Grant knew no more about it
than the junior office boy. There were moments when Paul Spencer repelled him.
He had one of those old feelings upon him now. For Spencer was smiling in his
sinister fashion like some elderly Mephistopheles.</p>
<p>"Do you find the matter so amusing?" he asked, coldly.</p>
<p>Spencer ceased to smile. His leathery features grew grave again.</p>
<p>"It always amuses me to hear a young man talk of getting married," he said.
"Didn't some wise man define marriage as an insane desire to keep somebody
else's daughter? Well, I suppose that it is necessary for the propagation of
the race. But Bruce Leverton's child! My dear fellow, Leverton would never
consent!"</p>
<p>"I am aware of it," Grant replied. "My father did Leverton a great wrong. My
father betrayed and nearly ruined the best friend he ever had. But that is no
fault of mine. I have never been in company with Sir Bruce, and so far as I
know he has never so much as seen me. And that is all the greater reason why he
should not judge me by my father's standard."</p>
<p>"So you have met his daughter and made love to her? That's very like you,
Grant&mdash;very like you indeed. And does the young lady know that you
are&mdash;well, the son of your father?"</p>
<p>"She does. Upon my word, I hardly know why I am discussing this matter with
you. It is hardly a subject that is likely to be of interest to a hard-cured
bachelor like yourself."</p>
<p>The sinister smile was on Spencer's face again. His deep-set eyes
twinkled.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, I am deeply interested." he said. "Some of these early
days you will understand why. Now, let me tell you of something more than
passing moment. Leverton is a big man in his way. He aspires to belong to the
country and his place, Grant Lea, which is not far from here, is a fine old
mansion. But he really cannot afford to live in it, and very frequently he is
hard pressed for money. I make it a point of knowing these things because they
are useful in business. I am telling you this because&mdash;well, because you
may be able to use the information to your advantage."</p>
<p>Grant shook his head. He did not approve of some of his partner's
methods.</p>
<p>"There will be no occasion," he said. "I am going to ask no favour of Sir
Bruce Leverton, and I am not going to put pressure on him in the way you
suggest. If he refuses his consent to my marriage with his daughter I shall
make her my wife all the same. We shall set up housekeeping here, and I can
give May everything that she has been accustomed to. Still, the engagement is a
secret for the present, and I need not ask you to respect my confidence."</p>
<p>Grant walked to the far side of the balcony with an air of finality. So far
as he was concerned the subject under discussion was closed. Spencer watched
him with a queer gleam in his eyes. The hard, leathery face was wrinkled with
malice; the mouth was cold and cruel. And with it was that furtive mirth that
rendered the whole face so hideously repulsive.</p>
<p>"Very well, my boy," he said, "I'll say no more about it. Let us take a walk
together round the estate so that I can show you the full extent of your
possessions. There is a summer-house on the edge of the cliff beyond the pines
that is a very favourite retreat of mine. It is one of the quietest and most
beautiful spots that I know."</p>
<p>Grant followed his partner through the charming grounds with a pleased
feeling of possession upon him. The Dutch garden was a blaze of yellow tulips,
and daffodils and hyacinths edged with masses of some mauve creeper; beyond
this the long festoons of roses were bursting into leaf. The young May
afternoon was soft and balmy; the air was heavy with the fragrance of white
lilac. Away to the left the massed stem of the larches trembled in a sheet of
verdure. Up the slope at the end of the woods was a small chalet in the form of
a summer-house surrounded by the yellow flare of the gorse, and beyond this
again the dancing blue haze of the Channel. The wide stretch of sea lay blue,
200 ft. below.</p>
<p>"Now. What do you think of that?" Spencer asked with some pride. "This is
the one thing that makes Ledge Point perfect. It's a little dangerous, perhaps,
and if you take my advice you will have the cliff fenced in. You can see for
yourself what a sheer drop it is. But for solitude and beauty the place is very
hard to beat."</p>
<p>Grant was silent for a moment. He stood there drinking in the marvellous
restfulness and beauty of it all. And what an ideal home it would make for May
Leverton. What a pleasant surprise it would be when he brought her here for the
first time.</p>
<p>"Yes, you are a lucky young fellow." Spencer murmured as if he had read
Grant's thoughts. "On the whole I should say that you&mdash;well, what is
it?"</p>
<p>A servant stood there with a telegram on a tray.</p>
<p>"I found this in the letter-box, sir," the man said. "Perhaps the telegraph
boy could not make anybody hear. We were all out in the garden, sir."</p>
<p>Spencer snatched at the orange-coloured envelope eagerly. He appeared to be
strangely agitated over it. For a business man accustomed to such things, his
agitation was astounding. His fingers shook as he tore off the cover, Grant
could see the hard leathery face grow pale.</p>
<p>"There is no answer, Jenner," Spencer said in a hard dry voice.</p>
<p>"Grant, I've got to go over to Fairford on urgent business. I have to meet a
man there at once. It is a very unpleasant matter that I had forgotten all
about years ago. A trifling indiscretion&mdash;. My dear fellow, as you grow
older you will find how inconvenient these indiscretions become. I'll try and
get back to dinner, but I can be by no means certain about that. If I'm not
back by half-past 10, I shall be glad if you will come as far as this place and
look for me."</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," Grant stammered. "I am afraid I don't
understand&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of course you don't," Spencer said irritably. "How should you? My dear boy,
this is a matter of life and death to me. We all have our troubles and
anxieties, and they are generally none the less acute because they are of our
own making. I wish I could take you into my confidence, but that is impossible.
Now, will you do as I suggest? If I am not back by half-past 10 will you come
as far as this particular spot and look for me?"</p>
<p>Grant promised in a dazed kind of way. The thing was unexpected, dramatic,
inexplicable! Here was black and bitter trouble, perhaps disgrace, for this
model of respectability! What did it all mean, and where was it all going to
end? Grant was still asking himself this question, when Spencer had turned away
and was hurrying along in the direction of the house.</p>
<p>A moment or two later and the big car that Spencer always drove himself was
hurrying along the road towards Fairford. The fateful telegram had fallen on a
patch of young gorse and lay there fluttering in the breeze. In a mechanical
way Grant took it up. The message was by no means a long one, but it was very
curt and to the point:&mdash;</p>
<p>Must see you at once at the old place in Fairford. You had better not
fail.</p>
<p>That was all. There was no name at the end of this insolent missive. It had
evidently been sent by a man accustomed to be obliged.</p>
<p>With the tissue still open in his hand, Grant made his way back slowly and
thoughtfully to the house. He was filled with an uneasy sense of coming
danger.</p>
<p>By the front door stood a visitor asking questions of Jenner. There was
something oddly familiar about the girl to Grant. He half stopped to
listen.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.&mdash;Why?</h2>
<p>"But surely you must the mistaken," the visitor was saying. "Mr. Spencer
expects me. I am perfectly certain that he would not have disappointed me. I
have come a long way, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry, miss," Jenner interrupted respectfully. "But my master has
been called away to Fairford on unexpected business. It is just possible that
he may not get back to-night. If it is any thing to do with business, I am
quite sure that my master's partner, Mr.&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, it is quite a private affair," the girl said. "I suppose I must call
again to-morrow. I am sorry to have given you all this trouble."</p>
<p>The pretty girl with the slim graceful figure turned away with a suggestion
of disappointment. As she disappeared round a bend in the drive, Grant
followed. He was no longer in doubt now, he knew his ground exactly. He
stretched out his hands and laid it on the girl's shoulder.</p>
<p>"May," he said quietly. "May, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>The girl turned with something like a cry of fear on her lips. The pretty
face was deadly pale; the dark gray eyes were full of tears. They were tears of
disappointment, as Grant could see. But all the fear and anger were lost now in
the pink confusion of the girl's cheeks. From chin to brow the blushes glowed
on her face.</p>
<p>"I might ask you the same question," she stammered. "What are you doing
here?"</p>
<p>"You forget that Mr. Spencer is my partner. I came down here this week-end
on business that concerns you as much as it does me. I had forgotten for the
moment that your father's place was so close at hand. And Mr. Spencer never
told me that you were in the habit&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not. I'm not," May Leverton protested. "I have never been here
before. At the present moment I am supposed to be shopping in Fairford. I came
over on my machine. You must not say a word about this to anybody. Hubert."</p>
<p>"But if Mr. Spencer and your father are friends!"</p>
<p>"They are not. My father dislikes Mr. Spencer exceedingly. He does not trust
him. Mr. Spencer has never been over to Grant Lea. All the same. I had to
come."</p>
<p>"But why, dear? Surely you can confide in me." May Leverton shook her head
sorrowfully. There was a pleading look in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Indeed I can't, Hubert," she murmured. "If I had guessed that you were here
I should not have come near the place. It is hateful to me to have a secret
from you, but it cannot be helped. I have given my promise now, and I cannot go
back on it. I have to see Mr. Spencer on the most urgent matter unless it is
possible that&mdash;"</p>
<p>May's voice trailed away in a whisper, her eyes were far away. Grant could
see that her little hands were clenched in a sudden determination. He began to
realise that there was a determination here that he had not dreamt of.</p>
<p>"You look as if you were contemplating something desperate," he said. The
girl laughed unsteadily. Then the tears crept into her eyes again.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am," she said, desperately. "What am I talking about? But I suppose I
must wait now with what patience I am capable of. Don't think badly of me,
dear, there is nothing to be ashamed of so far as I am concerned. And&mdash;and
how glad I am to see you again."</p>
<p>May forced the tears back from her eyes; a charming smile broke out on her
face. It was all quiet and secluded there, so that Grant took her in his arms
and kissed her passionately. All the jealous uneasy doubts had faded
away&mdash;it was impossible to look down into the clear depths of the gray
eyes turned so lovingly upon him and harbour unearthly suspicions any
longer.</p>
<p>"It is a most, delightful surprise," he said. "I'll take my good fortune as
I find it, and not waste time in asking questions, May. Are you in a great
hurry?"</p>
<p>May hesitated. The day was fair and smiling, and the main she loved was by
her side.</p>
<p>"I ought to go back at once," she said. "I really ought, dear boy. But it is
such a lovely day, and it is so very long since I saw you last. Well, half an
hour."</p>
<p>"I'll try and show you the beauties of the place in that time," Grant
smiled. "You have no idea what a most delightful house it is, May. I fell in
love with it from the start, and I have been coveting it ever since. How would
you like to live here altogether, child?"</p>
<p>May smiled softly as she pressed her lover's arm. There was absolutely
nothing wanting here to make the place perfect. She stood presently in the
summer house looking out over the hazy blue of the sea. A little sigh of
mingled pleasure and anxiety escaped her.</p>
<p>"It is a little paradise." she said. "It is wasted on a man like Mr.
Spencer."</p>
<p>"Do you think so, May? Spencer is very artistic. No man without great taste
and feeling could have designed so perfect a spot as this."</p>
<p>May shuddered as if she suddenly found the day cold and bleak. "The Borgias
were people of taste," she said. "And yet what a set of cold-blooded wretches
they were! Hubert, you may not know it, but Mr. Spencer is a bad man. He is
your partner, and you may think lightly of him as a good business hand, but he
is a bad man. Some day you will find it out. Oh! I cannot tell you how this
knowledge came my way, but it is true. For the present my lips are sealed
because the secret is not altogether mine. Please don't press me."</p>
<p>Grant kissed the anxious look away. "I am not going to, darling," he said.
"And please do not let us waste our precious time in a discussion on the merits
of Mr. Spencer. If I could buy this place, how would you like to live
here?"</p>
<p>"I could be happy with you anywhere," the girl said, simply. "It would be
lovely, dear. But that is far too good to be true. And there is my father to
bring round first."</p>
<p>Grant set his jaw firmly. "I shall know how to deal with him when the time
comes," he said. "After all is said and done, it is not fair of him to punish
me for the faults of other people. Now, if I could induce my partner to sell me
this dear little place, do you suppose that Sir Bruce&mdash;?"</p>
<p>But May was not hopeful. All the grave anxiety was in her eyes as she turned
her face in the direction of Grant Lea a little later on. There was likely to
be many a day of black and bitter trouble before she called herself Mrs. Hubert
Grant.</p>
<p>And Grant had plenty of food for reflection when once he was alone. It came
to him with significant force that he had never really liked his partner. But
hitherto he had regarded him as a model of honour and fairness. Now he began to
have his doubts. May Leverton had not hesitated to say that Spencer was a bad
man, and apparently she was in a position to prove her statement.</p>
<p>Grant thought all this over as he sat in the garden till the light began to
fail and it was time to dress for dinner. There was no sign of Spencer's
return, and Hubert decided to go on without his host. He sat there in the big
house-place with the shaded lights, the dinner-table and the masses of yellow
spring flowers in the old blue vases. All around him was the dull gleam of
ancient oak, the atmosphere of refinement and artistic feeling that he liked so
well. And how perfect it would have all been had only May been seated at the
other end of the table! But that would come one of these early days, Hubert
told himself.</p>
<p>He took his coffee and cigar presently on the balcony with the shaded lights
behind him. On the table there he had thrown down the telegram which had so
greatly distressed Paul Spencer. He took it up again idly now, and began to
turn it about in his fingers. He wondered as to what manner of man the message
had come from.</p>
<p>"There is no reason why you should wait up any longer, Jenner," he said to
the butler who had come to see if any thing more was needed. "I have all that I
require, thank you. If your master is not back by half-past 10 I will see that
the house is locked up."</p>
<p>Jenner retired respectfully. It was an early household as a rule, and the
servants were generally in bed by half-past 10. Grant sat there with the
telegram in his hand. Then something in the postmark attracted his attention,
and he regarded the paper more carefully.</p>
<p>"Very odd," he said to himself. "I quite thought that this was the 6th May.
I should lave been prepared to swear to that. And this telegram is post-marked
the 5th. I suppose I'm wrong. Still&mdash;"</p>
<p>Just for a moment Hubert was inclined to let the matter pass. Then he rose
from his chair and went into the dining-room. By the side of the old-fashioned
fireplace a calendar hung. He bent down and looked at it long and
carefully.</p>
<p>"I'm right, after all." he said. "This is Saturday the 6th May. And the
postmark on a telegram that is obviously sent out from London this morning is
post-marked a day wrong. Now, fancy a post office official making a mistake
like that! I have never heard of such a thing before. I'll put this in my
pocket and&mdash;well, Jenner?"</p>
<p>Jenner stood there quiet and respectful as usual. He had discarded most of
his clothing, and appeared now in his pyjamas.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon for disturbing you, sir," he said, "but there is a
burglar in the library. Shall I and tell the police, or shall you and me, sir,
tackle the person? It is not much in my line, being by nature a timid man, sir;
but if you like&mdash;?"</p>
<p>Grant jumped hurriedly from his seat, his face hard and set.</p>
<p>"Come along." he whispered. "We shall be able to manage him between us."</p>
<p>"Beg pardon, sir," Jenner murmured. "It isn't a he at all, sir&mdash;it's a
woman!"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.&mdash;Enter Mr. Smith.</h2>
<p>Hubert was inclined to be amused. The correctness and solemnity of Jenner's
manner by no means disguised his nervousness. The man was white and frightened.
On the other hand Grant regarded the situation with a certain feeling of
amusement. The idea of a lady burglar was distinctly a novel one. Doubtless one
of the maids had come prowling about in the darkness, and Jenner had magnified
her into a professional thief.</p>
<p>"Better make sure first," Hubert suggested. "It seems hardly possible that
anybody should come here whilst so many lights are burning. Your burglar is not
noted for audacity. Go and ask her what she wants. She is probably a house
maid."</p>
<p>"I think not, sir," Jenner said quite firmly. "I don't make those mistakes,
sir. I have been in service with the best families too long sir. It is a
lady."</p>
<p>"You mean that you have seen her face?"</p>
<p>"Well, no, sir. I can't go so far as that. But with my experience it is
impossible to make a mistake. There's a certain delicacy of perfume that the
lower classes can't get. Even a lady's maid, who ought to know better, always
over does it. And the way she carries her clothes. I shall be very much obliged
if you will come this way, sir."</p>
<p>Hubert rose from his chair. It seemed to him that Jenner's philosophy had
gone far enough. He was no longer amused; on the contrary he was vexed with
himself for having wasted so much valuable time. Even in this interval the
daring thief might have got away with some plunder of price. And a troubled
doubt began to assail Hubert. There was something very wrong about this house,
some thing sinister in connection with his partner. May Leverton had come here
on a more or less desperate errand, and here was another woman on a similar
quest apparently. Unless it might be that the two women&mdash;</p>
<p>The mere suggestion sent the blood humming through Hubert's head. The idea
was preposterous and absurd, and yet stranger things had happened. It would be
just as well perhaps to take this matter out of Jenner's hands altogether. Even
if his suspicions were groundless, there was no necessity for Jenner to know
too much. Taking it for granted that the intruder was a lady; the fact was
almost in itself a proof that she was here on some desperate enterprise not
necessarily connected with common robbery.</p>
<p>"We will go and investigate," Hubert said with a gaiety he was not
altogether feeling. "I don't think there will be any occasion for us to arm
ourselves. I'll go in front."</p>
<p>Jenner did not contest the point; he appeared quite content to fall modestly
in the background and leave the whole affair to Grant.</p>
<p>The door of the library was open, and in the darkness somebody could be
heard moving about. In a corner by a window stood the big safe. A moment later
a match flared out; there was a sudden jingling of keys and the click of a
lock. A pale, pretty, desperately frightened face stood out just for an instant
in a luminous bath of light.</p>
<p>It was only for an instant, but it was quite long enough for Hubert. All his
wits were alert and vigorous now. In the dim rays of the match he could make
out Jenner with his hand on the switch ready to flood the room with the gleam
of electrics.</p>
<p>Without the slightest hesitation, Grant's right arm shot out, and landed
heavily on Jenner's temple. He went down like a log without a groan. The whole
thing was too quick and clever for the servant to guess from what quarter the
assault came.</p>
<p>He dropped on the carpet with a heavy thud. A muffled scream came from the
figure by the safe. She darted headlong in the direction of the door, and as
she passed him, Hubert caught her by the arm. She moaned piteously as Grant
held her tight.</p>
<p>"You are quite safe," he whispered. "Absolutely there is no danger. But what
possessed you to do it, what peculiar form of madness is this, May?"</p>
<p>The girl trembled from head to foot in a violent fit of sobbing. She was
fighting hard with a wild desire to burst out into hysterical laughter. Grant's
soothing words prevailed at length.</p>
<p>"I had to come," she whispered. "I meant to return when I left you this
afternoon. It&mdash;it was a great shock to me to find you here at all. I did
not expect anything of the kind. And I had to deceive you. Because the secret
is not altogether mine."</p>
<p>Grant felt his way across the room and turned on the lights. May drew back
in horror at the sight of Jenner lying there white and unconscious on the
floor.</p>
<p>"Somebody has killed him," she cried. "He is dead."</p>
<p>"Not so much noise," Grant said. "The servants are all safe in bed, and it
would be a great pity to disturb them. The man is all right. It was he who
discovered that you were in the house. He had not recognised you when you
lighted that match, but he would have done so had I not taken strong measures
and knocked him senseless. He is beginning to move."</p>
<p>At a sign from Grant, May darted back behind the curtains. Jenner struggled
to his feet.</p>
<p>"What happened?" he asked. "Where am I, sir?"</p>
<p>"Somebody must have struck you a blow," Grant exclaimed glibly. "It was
quite sudden. In the confusion of the moment it is difficult to follow these
things. There is nobody here now, and it would be a waste of time to try catch
the thieves. I'll telephone the police in the morning. In the meantime you had
better go to bed."</p>
<p>Jenner needed no further persuasion. The man was horribly frightened. He was
anxious enough to have all the trouble and danger off his hands. If Mr. Grant
was going to sit up until Mr. Spencer returned, he would like to retire. His
head ached terribly, and in his present condition he would be quite
useless.</p>
<p>Hubert watched Jenner disappear up the stairs, he heard the butler's room
door closed and locked before he returned to the library. From the gentle
draught that swayed the curtains to and fro he gathered that the windows were
open. Obviously May had come that way. He whispered her name, and she came
timidly towards him.</p>
<p>"You are very angry with me?" she asked, imploringly.</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Hubert said quietly. "It is all so strange and
unexpected that I don't know what to think. Surely it must be some desperate
trouble that impels you to do this daring thing! Won't you confide in me now,
May? Won't you tell me everything?"</p>
<p>"I hardly know how I can look you in the face," May murmured. "There is no
necessity, dearest. If it helps your courage we will talk in the dark. Perhaps
it would be as well for us to do so in any case. I am expecting Mr. Spencer
back soon, and I am quite sure that you don't want to see him at this
hour."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, no," May shuddered, "I came this afternoon to try to persuade him
to do me a favour. It was a great disappointment for me to find that he was
away. Not that I believed for a moment that he would listen to anything that I
had to say. It was when I was talking to you that I made up my mind. As I went
away I looked in through the window of this room, and I saw that Mr. Spencer
had left his keys on his desk."</p>
<p>Grant started. He had not noticed this oversight himself. It was very unlike
his partner to do anything like that. But then he had been greatly distressed
and agitated by that mysterious telegram, he had gone off without the least
delay.</p>
<p>"You desired to rob Mr. Spencer's safe?" he asked. "Why?"</p>
<p>There was a long pause before May replied. Hubert could feel her trembling
from head to foot. He waited patiently; he soothed her, with loving words and
assurances of his loyalty to her.</p>
<p>"I am sure that you sorely need a friend," he said. "You are in some
dreadful trouble that is caused by no fault of your own. And who better could
you have to tell than me? I am not your husband yet, but I am going to be. Tell
me, dearest."</p>
<p>A long sigh came from Mary's lips.</p>
<p>"How good, you are to me!" she murmured. "How nobly you treat me! And yet my
conduct could not appear to you in a worse light. You are justified in
regarding me as a common thief and never speaking to me again."</p>
<p>"I am quite certain that you are not to blame, May. I am quite certain that
you are trying to shield somebody else. Who is it?"</p>
<p>"My&mdash;my mother," May whispered. "I ought not to have told you, but I
could not keep it to myself any longer. It is only fair that you should be
told. In that safe are my mother's jewels, or at least the jewels that my
mother was taking care of."</p>
<p>"Taking care of! Then they are not here at all. Pray go on."</p>
<p>"I will try to make the matter plain, Hubert. Mr. Spencer is a scoundrel.
There is no man whom I regard with more contempt and loathing. He&mdash;he
wanted to marry me."</p>
<p>"To marry you! But where, how, when&mdash;I am amazed to hear this."</p>
<p>"We met frequently in London last winter. Mr. Spencer is a rich man, and he
became very friendly with my mother. It was not right, because my father hates
the man. You have heard me speak of my mother frequently. She is not bad, only
foolish and frivolous, and very fond of getting into smart society. To do that
nowadays it is necessary to gamble recklessly. And my mother has always had a
weakness that way. She lost large sums of money, and Mr. Spencer paid them for
her. But he always wanted security. He had her own jewels one by one. But that
is not the worst. When Lady Mossingford had to go abroad suddenly to see her
boy, who was dangerously ill in Paris, she was staying with us at Grant Lea.
She left a large portion of her jewels in my mother's charge,
and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>
<p>May paused as if unable to proceed. Hubert kissed her tenderly.</p>
<p>"Let me finish," he said. "In a fit of madness your mother pledged those
gems to get money to pay her gambling debts, and Spencer knows whom they belong
to. He is using his knowledge as a lever to get your mother to force you to
marry him. You came here this afternoon to try to induce Mr. Spencer to do the
proper thing, and you found me here instead. And when you happened to see the
keys on the desk, you made the desperate resolve of coming back to try to get
possession of those gems. And all the time I have been in absolute ignorance as
to what was going on. I told my partner this afternoon that I was going to
marry you, and he took it as if it was the most ordinary piece of news. And all
this time I have been the partner of an infernal scoundrel without dreaming of
the fact. Why didn't you tell me?"</p>
<p>May was crying quietly, with her head on Hubert's shoulder.</p>
<p>"I did not dare to," she said. "I was afraid of making mischief between you.
I see now how weak and foolish I have been. And I had my mother to think of. I
only found out how bad things were quite by accident. At the present moment I
am supposed to be in bed and asleep. I came by the road along the cliffs in the
moonlight, and I am going back presently the same way. But I must have those
jewels. It is a vile and dishonourable thing to do, but my mother is the first
consideration. You will help me, Hubert?"</p>
<p>Grant hesitated. The situation was hedged with difficulties.</p>
<p>"We must take time," he said. "If you&mdash;but come outside. Let us go down
the grounds in the direction of the cliffs. Unless I am greatly mistaken,
Spencer has come back. I am quite sure that I heard his steps in the dining
room."</p>
<p>Somebody was moving about the dining room certainly. Followed by May, Grant
crept into the garden and made his way towards the cliffs.</p>
<p>"Wait for me," he said. "Stay here and have patience. I'll be back
presently."</p>
<p>He hurried back to the house and into the dining-room. The lights were fully
on; the blinds were drawn and by the table stood a figure in evening dress. To
Grant's surprise he saw that the intruder was not Spencer, but a stranger.</p>
<p>"There is some mistake here," he said. "You are&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Very much at your service, sir," the stranger said. "Be so good as to be
seated. You want naturally to know my name. Then call me Smith&mdash;Mr. John
Smith&mdash;of London."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;By Whose Hand.</h2>
<p>The stranger appeared to be fully cognisant of the fact that he was master
of the situation. To further emphasize the fact he laid a small ivory handled
revolver on the table before him. There was a coolness about the whole
proceeding that deprived Grant of the power of speech for a moment. He saw a
little fat man with a tiny waxed moustache, a glass in his right eye, and a
general suggestion of the middle aged dandy with him. There are scores of such
men to be seen everyday in the service clubs in St. James's-street, but in this
case there was an air of grimness and determination which there was no
mistaking. The voice of the stranger was mincing and affected, but behind the
falsetto an uneasiness that had almost a menace in it.</p>
<p>"Am I to understand that I am practically a prisoner?" Grant asked.</p>
<p>The little man screwed his glass still more firmly in his right eye. His
hand fell on the butt of the revolver with a suggestion of familiarity with
weapons.</p>
<p>"That is an exceedingly luminous idea of yours," he said. "For the time
being you are a prisoner. And in your own house too. But, believe me, I have no
idea of violence&mdash;that is if you are reasonable. The less resentment you
show, the quicker I shall be finished. I have come to give you some exceedingly
valuable advice."</p>
<p>"You might have come in a more conventional form," Hubert retorted.</p>
<p>"I might, yes," Mr. Smith said thoughtfully. "But there are strong reasons
why I should not do any thing of the kind. Mr. Spencer is your partner, I
understand?"</p>
<p>"That is common knowledge, sir. Will you please go on?"</p>
<p>"I pray you not to be impatient. Now, has it ever occurred to you that Mr.
Spencer is not exactly what he appears to be? His name stands high in the
city&mdash;he is supposed to be a very rich man. I use the word 'supposed'
advisedly. I have the best of reasons for believing that Mr. Paul Spencer is
not a rich man at all. In fact he is a defaulter. The firm of Spencer, Grant,
and Scarsdale is hopelessly insolvent. In a few days this will be common
property. It is exceedingly hard on Mr. Philip Scarsdale, who is only a
sleeping partner, but he is not quite blameless. He ought to have insisted upon
seeing that the money was correct. So should you for that matter."</p>
<p>"Mr. Spencer has always looked after the financial side of the business,"
Grant said.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know that. He has showed you forged balance-sheets and forged bank
books. He has been doing that sort of juggling for years. The time comes when
that kind of thing has to stop, and the time has come now. The money you paid
for this house goes with the rest. You were a great fool not to have a proper
conveyance of the property. Not that it would have mattered much, as your
creditors will take everything."</p>
<p>Grant stood there listening in a kind of dull amazement. Who was this man
who spoke in such confident terms of his private affairs?</p>
<p>"I have only your word for all this," he said. "Precisely. I expected you to
say that. It is only natural that I should be expected to prove my bona-fides.
All the same you will pardon me if I prefer to remain more or less anonymous. I
am going to speak now of one or two transactions that will open your eyes."</p>
<p>The speaker proceeded to tick off certain items on his fingers. He mentioned
the names of clients, he spoke freely of their business, he seemed to have all
the figures at the end of his tongue. In the light of these revelations certain
vague suspicions of Grant's became damning facts. He began to understand
presently how desperate the position was.</p>
<p>"Have I said enough?" the stranger said curtly. "If you are not satisfied, I
will go on. There is no transaction of your firm which is concealed from
me."</p>
<p>"The whole thing is amazing," Hubert cried. "My partner&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Your partner is a scoundrel. In a day or two everybody will know him for a
rascal of the worst possible type. I am sorry for you, and I am sorry for
Philip Scarsdale. But you are by no means blameless in the matter. You have
allowed this to go on for all these years without asking questions. After the
figures are investigated you will all stand in the dock together. People will
say hard things about you."</p>
<p>"They will," Grant agreed moodily. "If I could confront you with Paul
Spencer&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That you will never do. Paul Spencer does not set foot in this house again.
Within a very short time he will be on his way abroad. He has a trouble of his
own, and by this time the police are after him. Is the name of Robert Morton
familiar to you?"</p>
<p>"As an acquaintance," Grant said. "A man more or less of a failure in
business, who has lately taken up politics. A poor conceited creature!"</p>
<p>"You are absolutely wrong, Mr. Grant. That silly manner of Morton's is
assumed to hide the man's wonderful cunning and cleverness. He is one of the
most dangerous and unscrupulous men that I ever met. He is mainly responsible
for Spencer's downfall. I believe that once he was out of the way Spencer could
have saved the situation. And this great enemy of his will be yours also.
Still, I can help you here. You will get some letters and papers through the
post, and I hope you will study them carefully."</p>
<p>"I suppose I ought to thank you?" Grant asked.</p>
<p>"My dear sir, if you knew every thing, you would thank me on your knees. And
if you wish to see your late partner again you must go as far as the summer
house on the cliff. I fancy you were asked to go there to-night at half-past 10
if he did not come back. You may take my word for it that he will not come
back."</p>
<p>Hubert glanced mechanically at the clock. It was a few minutes past the hour
of ten. There was yet time to hear more of the mysterious business.</p>
<p>"I am much obliged to you for the hint," he said. "If you have nothing
further to say to me, I will go now, I have much to discuss with Mr.
Spencer."</p>
<p>The stranger clicked the lock of his revolver significantly.</p>
<p>"I am not here entirely for your benefit," he said drily. "It must be plain
to your intelligence that I am taking risks in coming here at all. At half-past
ten precisely I shall permit myself the pleasure of taking off the embargo that
keeps you here. In ten minutes from now I shall relieve you of my presence. In
all probability we shall never meet again. You are annoyed and angry with me
now, but the time will come when you will bless the day that introduced you to
the man who calls himself Mr. Smith, of London. Did I say Mr. John Smith?"</p>
<p>Grant nodded sullenly. He was in no mood to be grateful. There was something
in the man's manner that he resented. And all the while May was waiting for him
in the garden. She was not likely to turn her face in the direction of Grant
Lea so long as matters remained in the present state of uncertainty. And with
it all was the danger that her absence from home might be discovered. Any silly
little accident might bring this about.</p>
<p>"You are causing me great inconvenience," Grant said. "If I could go at
once&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You can't go at once. You must give me your word to remain here till the
clock strikes the half hour. If you break it, you must take the consequences.
If you move a yard from the house till the proper moment you will pay for your
broken promise with your life."</p>
<p>As the last word was uttered the electric lights went out suddenly leaving
the room plunged into black darkness.</p>
<p>As Grant's dazzled eyes, assisted by the moon outside, began to discern the
familiar surroundings he became aware of the fact that he was alone.</p>
<p>The mysterious Mr. Smith had vanished as strangely as he had come. The
leaden monster crept on till the half hour struck with a noise and
unexpectedness that set all Grant's nerves throbbing. He made a dash for the
door for the garden beyond. It lay still and peaceful in the moonlight, there
was no sign of May anywhere. She was no longer standing in the place where
Grant had left her. Possibly she had got tired of waiting, and gone home,
perhaps she was hiding somewhere close by. Grant called her softly by name, but
no reply came. And there was no time to lose.</p>
<p>He made his way through the garden and up the slope leading to the summer
house. The clear moonlight shone across the wide expanse of sea, a figure
standing on the edge of the cliff loomed out clear like a cameo. It needed no
second glance to tell Grant that the solitary figure was that of Paul Spencer.
It was very strange that a man presumably a fugitive from justice should expose
himself in that bold, careless way.</p>
<p>"Better get into the summer house," Grant called out. "I'm coming up."</p>
<p>"I'm waiting for you," Spencer replied. "I dare say you think&mdash;"</p>
<p>The sentence was never finished. With the words on his lips Spencer
staggered back with his hand to his side as a revolver shot rang out. A stifled
groan escaped him; he lurched forward, then backwards and disappeared headlong
over the steep cliff into the sea two hundred feet below.</p>
<p>With a feeling of horror and sickness upon him Grant looked down to the
silent flood lapping peacefully on the granite rocks. He called and called
again, but nothing came but the hoarse echo of his own frightened voice.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.&mdash;"Red Ruin."</h2>
<p>Grant stood there looking down long and anxiously. The whole thing had
happened with such dramatic suddenness that he felt almost inclined to doubt
the evidence of his senses. And yet he had clearly hard the voice of his
partner, he had seen Spencer's familiar figure picked out with vivid
distinctness in the moonlight. He had heard the quick crack of the revolver
shot, he had seen Spencer roll and disappear over the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>Paul Spencer was dead beyond all doubt. Probably the bullet from the
revolver had been sufficient to account for the victim, but the fall from the
cliff had removed all uncertainty. There was not a ledge or a spur on the face
of the rocks to break the force of the descent. A hundred yards or more to the
right was a winding path leading to the beach, and Grant risked it. But his
search was all in vain. The tide was fairly high, and it still washed the foot
of the cliff. There was nothing for it now but to hurry back to the house and
give the alarm.</p>
<p>As Hubert reached the garden. May flashed into his mind again. He was
anxious and worried about her. Had she gone home? Had she got tired of waiting
for him? Or was she still hiding close by? There was no satisfactory way of
answering these questions as far as Hubert could see. He would have to wait.
The amazing complexity of the tangle bewildered him. A few hours before and
there was no suspicion of trouble at all. A few hours ago he had been the proud
and happy owner of Ledge Point, with the prospect of fair years before him. And
now he doubted whether or not he could call the house his own. Certainly he had
no right to do so if half of the mysterious 'Mr. Smith's' story was true.</p>
<p>Clearly May had gone home. It was no use wasting further time looking for
her. The thing to do now was to find the cold-blooded author of the murder.
Grant dismissed the idea that Mr. Smith himself might be the author of the
crime. If that extraordinary individual had intended anything of the kind he
could never have been so rash as to make himself known to anybody at Ledge
Point. Clearly Paul Spencer had had more enemies than one.</p>
<p>But something must be done. Hubert made his way back to the quiet house
where the lights were still burning, and called up the Fairford police on the
telephone. It seemed to him to be much more prudent not to disturb the
house-hold. At the end of a long weary hour Inspector Manley put in an
appearance.</p>
<p>"This seems to be a very extraordinary affair, sir," he said. "Will you
please to give me the details all over again?"</p>
<p>Hubert explained at length. He said nothing as to the presence of Mr. Smith.
Clearly Smith had had no hand in the tragedy, and to drag in his name would
merely precipitate the financial scandal that Hubert was anxious to avoid. It
was not a very prudent decision, but there was not much time to think.</p>
<p>"Mr. Spencer had enemies?" Manley asked.</p>
<p>"So it would seem," Grant said, guardedly. "I never suspected it till this
afternoon. My partner struck me as a very respectable man. He had no vices or
extravagances, and he was very particular as to the company he kept."</p>
<p>"Did he say anything after that telegram came?"</p>
<p>"I fancy not. Oh, yes, he did&mdash;he said something as to old
indiscretions, and the way they came back to people years afterwards. He was
evidently alluding to something that happened in his early manhood. The
telegram seemed to agitate him very much."</p>
<p>"I suppose you did not happen to see the telegram, sir?" Manley asked.</p>
<p>"Indeed, I did," Grant explained. "As a matter of fact, I have it in my
pocket at the present moment. Mr. Spencer dropped it, and I packed it up
meaning to return it to him when he got back here. Would you like to have a
look at it?"</p>
<p>Inspector Manley expressed a keen desire to do so. He puzzled over the
flimsy pink paper for some little time. It was plain that he made nothing out
of it.</p>
<p>"I'll keep this, sir, if you don't mind," he said. "I see the telegram was
despatched from London. That makes the sender very difficult to trace. There is
a distinct threat in the message, and it is quite clear from what you say that
Mr. Spencer was afraid of the person who sent the curt summons to him. Was he
of a nervous disposition?"</p>
<p>"Quite the contrary," Grant explained. "I have seldom met a man with more
moral and physical courage. Keep the telegram, by all means, Inspector. And
when you have examined it carefully, tell me if you find anything peculiar
about it."</p>
<p>The inspector rose and made his way to the door.</p>
<p>"You may depend upon it that we shall leave nothing undone to get at the
bottom of the affair," he said. "I will come round and see you in the
morning."</p>
<p>"I should prefer to wait till night so far as I am concerned," Hubert said.
"I must be at the office all day to-morrow. I shall have my unfortunate
partner's business to see to as well as my own."</p>
<p>The inspector had no objection to make. By breakfast-time the whole
countryside seemed to have heard of the tragedy. Idle groups began to collect
in the roads. One or two journalists had already arrived athirst for
information. Grant turned the keys in the door of the living rooms and handed
them to Jenner.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you will ever see your master again," he said. "They tell
me that bodies lost off the cliffs here are never recovered. But that won't
prevent you being pestered by a lot of vulgar sightseers who will ask you
questions. They will want to photograph the house both inside and out. Don't
let them do anything of the kind, Jenner. And don't part with those keys unless
the police ask for them."</p>
<p>Grant caught a fairly early train to town, and 11 o'clock saw him in the
city. It seemed to him that one or two business acquaintances eyed him
curiously as he walked along. There was a significant whispering and a raising
of eyebrows. Was the story public property already, Grant wondered? He did not
know that there had been whispers as to the status of his firm for days past.
It is one of the things the party most intimately connected never hears of
until too late. But there was no mistaking the significance of these glances
now. The full force of the mysterious Mr. Smith's warning came home to Hubert
at that moment.</p>
<p>He strode into his private office and rang the bell. A flurried-looking
clerk answered the summons.</p>
<p>"Send Mr. Raybold to me at once," Hubert said curtly. Mr. Spencer's
confidential clerk appeared presently. There was nothing about the business of
the firm that this man did not know. He was a tall, stout man, bald, pompous,
slow of speech, the very essence of subordinate respectability.</p>
<p>"You have heard the news Raybold?" Grant asked.</p>
<p>Raybold bowed. His florid face was ghastly pale, a fine bead of perspiration
gathered on his head. He put out a trembling hand imploringly.</p>
<p>"You must not blame me, sir," he whined. "It was no fault of mine. I
implored Mr. Spencer to take you into his confidence over and over again, but
he would not hear of it. For the last two years I have seen matters going from
bad to worse. Of course, I know that Mr. Spencer had been speculating wildly.
But he always said that it would come right&mdash;he had one big thing that was
going to make a million. Lord, what a time it has been!"</p>
<p>Raybold wiped his heated face with a palsied hand.</p>
<p>"Then I suppose that everything has gone?" Grant asked.</p>
<p>"It's worse than that, sir," Raybold explained. "It isn't only our money.
There is some fifty thousand pounds the other side belonging to clients. Some
of them have been lately making a fine to-do about their money. And there were
nasty letters from solicitors who threatened proceedings."</p>
<p>"And not one word was said to me about it!"</p>
<p>"That was Mr. Spencer's orders, sir. You were not to be told anything. He
hoped to get the money back over those East Quogga mining concessions."</p>
<p>"That is the concession that Mr. Cardella was so anxious to get from
us?"</p>
<p>"Quite so, sir. And he'll get the concession now unless we can find the
money. It's only a matter of another week. Mr. Cardella's man, Robert Morton,
has been working against us. People say he is a fool, but I know better."</p>
<p>Hubert frowned thoughtfully. He was of Raybold's opinion. Despite his silly
manner, Robert Morton was no fool. And Hubert had the mysterious Mr. Smith's
assurance that Morton was somewhat at the bottom of this conspiracy. Cardella
was a government official, a prominent member of the House of Commons with none
too sweet a reputation. There were those who declared that he used his official
knowledge to put money into his pocket. Morton was a member of the House, too,
with a reputation as an organiser. Grant began to see how the pit had been
prepared.</p>
<p>"Do you suggest that we are likely to be prosecuted?" he asked.</p>
<p>"It might come to that, sir." Raybold said hoarsely. "We might be able to
prove that Mr. Spencer had been queer for some time. But then people will say
that you ought to have looked into matters more closely. Cardella and Morton
know pretty well how matters stand, and they will try to pull you down this
week if possible. If they do, the Quogga concession falls into their hands
quite naturally. It might not be difficult to get one of Mr. Spencer's clients
to apply for a warrant against you. You'd probably get bail after a day or two,
but that would be too late. In the meantime we should break up altogether."</p>
<p>Hubert flashed round on the stumbling, hesitating Raybold.</p>
<p>"Speak out," he commanded, "tell me the whole truth. It is quite evident
that you are concealing something from me. Criminal proceedings have been
threatened?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir; that is so, sir," Raybold stammered. "A client named Jenkins. We
owe him some seven thousand pounds. Personally, I believe that Cardella and
Morton sent him here on purpose to lose his money. They knew full well that Mr.
Spencer would appropriate it. That is the quarter where the danger lies."</p>
<p>Grant listened moodily enough. A feeling of hopeless, impotent rage
possessed him. He was like a child who was kept in the dark. All this mystery
and intrigue was going on all around him, and he was entirely ignorant of the
thing. He had known something, of course, of the Quogga concession out of which
the firm was going to make a fortune. And they had been duped and fooled in
this way by Cardella and Morton.</p>
<p>"Well, it's useless to cry over spilt milk," Hubert said. "I shall gain
nothing by telling you that you are as great a knave as my late partner. Had
you been an honest man you would have come to me and told me all this. Leave
me, please. Before you go send a telegram to Mr. Scarsdale, and say his
presence is urgently needed here at once. This disgrace is hard upon me; it is
still harder on Mr. Scarsdale."</p>
<p>Raybold vanished eagerly. On the whole the dreaded interview had not been so
bad as he had expected. Grant sat there moodily stubbing a pen into his
blotting pad. The whole thing was terribly hard on Philip Scarsdale, who was a
sleeping partner in the business, with no knowledge whatever of what was going
on. Hubert was still thinking the matter over when Inspector Manley was
announced. The officer had the fateful telegram in his hand.</p>
<p>"I ran up to London with this, sir," he said. "You asked me if I noticed
anything peculiar about the telegram, and I have. It's the mistake in the date
you mean. That's why I came up to town to make inquiries. And now I have found
something stranger still."</p>
<p>"What is that?" Grant asked.</p>
<p>"Why, it is not a genuine message, sir. The form is correct and so is the
envelope and the stamp. But the message itself has never been through the post
office at all!"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;Flight.</h2>
<p>Hubert forgot his troubles in this new sensation.</p>
<p>"Stop a moment," he said. "Let me clearly understand the matter. The
telegram is a forgery?"</p>
<p>"In a manner of speaking yes, sir. Somebody contrived to obtain possession
of the proper form and the proper envelope. When this was done it would not be
a very difficult matter to forge the date stamp. I dare say I should have
allowed the whole thing to pass but for that mistake in dating the telegram the
wrong day."</p>
<p>"And how do you propose that that happened?"</p>
<p>"Well, it's only a theory, sir, but I fancy that I can explain that matter
easily enough. The date stamp was forged in one piece. I mean it wasn't a die
that could be changed. Something happened to put off the sending of the
telegram, for a day, and there was no time to have another die cut. Therefore
the person who is at the bottom of this queer business had to chance it. He
took the risk of the mistake passing, and in nine cases out of ten it would
have done so. When I came up to London with the telegram I knew that there was
something queer about it, and I was quite prepared for the post office to
repudiate the whole thing, which they did. No message like that was handed in
at East Strand yesterday."</p>
<p>"And that is as far as you have puzzled it out up to now, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Quite right, sir. I thought that I would come and let you know. If you are
returning to Ledge Point this evening I'll tell you what my theory is."</p>
<p>Grant was, however, by no means certain as to that point, and Inspector
Manley took his departure fairly well pleased with his own astuteness. He had
hardly left the office before Philip Scarsdale came in. He looked anxious and
uneasy.</p>
<p>"I got your telegram," he said. "I came up as quickly as possible. I heard
all sorts of rumours as I came along. The popular theory is that Spencer
committed suicide because he could not face his creditors. Is that really
so?"</p>
<p>"Paul Spencer did not commit suicide, anyway," said Hubert. "The man was
murdered. I saw the thing with my own eyes. I didn't see the murderer, of
course, or he would have been in the hands of the police before now."</p>
<p>Scarsdale intimated that he should like to hear the story. He listened
coldly and critically enough. There was something in his manner that irritated
Grant.</p>
<p>"Do you imagine that I am not telling the truth?" he asked.</p>
<p>"What I think does not matter in the least," Scarsdale retorted. "It is what
the coroner and Jury will say when they come to view the body. Some people
might insinuate that you got Spencer out of the way so that you could put all
the blame on him."</p>
<p>The hot blood rushed to Grant's face.</p>
<p>"Are you one of those people?" he asked pointedly. "Years ago when you stood
under the shadow of disgrace for a time one man believed in you. He stood up
for you when the woman who is now your wife turned from you. Appearances were
pretty black, but that one man never wavered. And when the whole vile
conspiracy was exposed&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," Scarsdale cried. "I ought not to have allowed you to
remind me of that, Hubert. Still, when a man looks like losing everything, he
is apt to forget his friends. Tell me in as many words whether we are ruined or
not?"</p>
<p>"More than that," Hubert replied. "We are disgraced. For all I know to the
contrary, there may be a warrant out for my arrest at the present moment. And
yet I can honestly swear that I am as innocent of wrong-doing as yourself.
Raybold will tell you so. Spencer managed all the money side of the business;
there never seemed any lack of capital. Mind you, I am not excusing myself. I
ought to have insisted upon a sight of the books. And here was I not dreaming
of a thing that was well known to Cardella and Morton."</p>
<p>"You mean Morton, the member of Parliament? He is going to dine with Sir
Bruce Leverton to-night, and we are driving him over. He has never been there
before, and Sir Bruce wanted to see him in connection with some political work.
He always struck me as being&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know he did," Grant said grimly. "But he isn't. That silly stupid way of
his is assumed. If you watch him carefully to-night you will see."</p>
<p>"I shan't," Scarsdale said wearily. "I shan't go. I shall send my wife
instead, and get her to introduce Morton to Sir Bruce. As you can imagine, this
has been a blow for me. I suppose that there will be nothing saved out of the
wreck?"</p>
<p>"On the contrary," Grant explained, "there is a good deal to be found. If I
had had time to work at East Quogga concession I could have saved the
situation. But Cardella and his satellite, Morton, are far too clever for that.
Their game is to break us up at once, and bring the old house down with a
crash. They have a man ready to apply for a warrant against me, and they may
have made the application already. By the time I had explained my position and
procured bail, the mischief will have been done. Those two rascals will have
got the Quogga concession into their hands, and secure a fortune."</p>
<p>"You mean that if you can be free for a day or two&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Precisely. If you can help me here I fancy I can see my way clear."</p>
<p>"Then I will. I'll call on Wainwright on my way home, and tell him to be
ready for you in case you are on the look out for a hiding place. I am taking
it for granted that there is nothing left of Spencer's fortune. You have looked
into his safe?"</p>
<p>Grant started. The question had given him an idea. He had quite forgotten
all about the safe at Ledge Point. The keys of the library had been handed over
to Jenner, who had instructions not to part with them except at the request of
the police. And in all probability the police had not needed them. Spencer's
safe was actually open, or at least the key was in the door. Here was a
splendid chance to help May Leverton. At any hazard the must be free of her
trouble. And the safe at Ledge Point might disclose something of real practical
value.</p>
<p>"That is very good of you," Grant said. "I'll telephone my landlady to pack
a bag for me, and leave it at Charing Cross Station to be called for. You shall
take it down as far as Wainwright's place near Fairford, and leave it there for
me. I have a little scheme in my mind, the details of which are not quite clear
yet, but I dare say I shall puzzle it out before dark. What time do you dine at
Leverton's to-night?"</p>
<p>"Half-past eight. Lady Leverton is nothing if not fashionable."</p>
<p>Philip Scarsdale went on his way presently leaving Hubert to his own
troubled thoughts. An hour later he was called to the telephone. He recognised
Scarsdale's voice.</p>
<p>"I'm calling you up from the Junior National," he said. "Morton has just
gone out with a man called Jenkins. I happened to hear a word of two of their
conversation. They are going to Bow-street to take out a warrant against you.
I'm telephoning Wainwright."</p>
<p>The message ceased, and Hubert reached for his hat and coat. He called a
taxicab presently, and got out at Charing Cross. Thence he took a bus to
Victoria, and travelled down to Clapham Junction. Here he left the station, and
started to walk to Grange Park, where he could get a local that would land him
four miles from Ledge Point.</p>
<p>He managed to creep into the grounds at length. The early April night was
closing in, though it was only a little past six. It was a dull evening, with a
cold wind from the east. Making his way with great caution, Hubert reached the
terrace at length. He had the satisfaction of seeing that the catch of the
library window was pushed back. A moment later he had dashed across the
terrace, and was in the room.</p>
<p>The door was locked. Jenner had evidently remembered his instructions. So
far, so good. The keys were in the safe, and Grant pulled back the door. There
was only one package in the safe so far as Grant could see&mdash;a square neat
package, with Lady Leverton's name on it. Without the slightest hesitation,
Hubert slipped it in his pocket. His one idea was to make his way to Fairford
to the residence of the man who was awaiting him. As he turned to go a telegram
on the mantelpiece attracted his attention. It was addressed to himself. No
doubt Jenner had put it there for safety.</p>
<p>He tore the flap open carefully, so that he could stick it down again. The
message was from May asking for the package in the safe at once. It was a
matter of life and death that it should be delivered at Grant Lea that same
night.</p>
<p>An hour later Grant burst in upon his friend Wainwright. He wanted to know
if his bag had come; he wanted to use the telephone without delay. His manner
was eager and excited, but there was something of the air of the conqueror
about him.</p>
<p>"That's all right," he said, presently. "I've managed to get the better of
Morton for the time being at any rate. And now I should like to see my room,
and have my dinner clothes."</p>
<p>"But you don't want dress clothes to-night," Wainwright protested.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I do," Grant exclaimed. "I'm dining out this evening. It will be a
pleasant surprise for some of them later on. I am going to do myself the honour
and pleasure of joining Sir Bruce Leverton's dinner party this evening."</p>
<p>"You must be mad," Wainwright protested.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;The Trouble Widens.</h2>
<p>Philip Scarsdale had taken the blow manfully enough. He had gone to town
with an uneasy feeling that matters were far from well with the firm of
Spencer, Grant, and Scarsdale, but he had not been prepared to find that
positive ruin stared him in the face.</p>
<p>It meant that he had lost everything. Ever since his marriage a comfortable
income of some thousands per annum had reached him regularly from that little
gold mine in the city. He had trusted his partners implicitly. He had developed
his perfect little estate; he had spent all his income in the comfortable
belief that he was justified in doing so.</p>
<p>And he believed Grant now; he took his word without the slightest
hesitation. The two were old friends in business, though oddly enough, Grant
had never visited at Scarsdale's house. He knew Mrs. Scarsdale by repute, he
knew of the trouble that once had threatened to ruin Scarsdale's happiness, but
he had never met Ellen Scarsdale face to face.</p>
<p>Scarsdale's thoughts were gloomy enough as he made his way homewards. It
seemed like some uneasy dream to see his wife standing there in the
drawing-room impatiently waiting his return. She was dressed ready to go out;
she came forward with a smile on her face. Then she started back as she saw the
hopeless misery in her husband's eyes.</p>
<p>"What is it, Philip?" she asked. "What is the matter? Are you ill
or&mdash;"</p>
<p>She could not say the word, and Scarsdale saved her the necessity.</p>
<p>"Ruin!" she gasped. "Ruin! You mean to say that there is
nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;"</p>
<p>Ellen Scarsdale paused as if unable to proceed. It seemed absolutely
impossible that Philip could be telling the truth. She glanced around her own
perfectly-appointed drawing-room; she could not possibly blend the startling
information with her surroundings. She could catch a glimpse of her own long
slim figure in a mirror opposite&mdash;a graceful outline in white, with
shining points of flame in the dark hair.</p>
<p>She could hear outside in the drive the jingle of harness, and the impatient
scraping of horse's feet. To her right hand lay the exquisite confection in
lace and satin and fur which she was going to wear in the brougham
presently.</p>
<p>And here was Philip splashed and mud-stained, still in a suit of rough
tweeds, his face pale and agitated. Long ago he should have been suitably
attired in the evening garb of modern civilisation.</p>
<p>"But, I don't understand at all, Phil," the young wife said with a catch in
her voice. "I thought you were so rich. You have always told me that I need not
give any consideration at all to money matters. Now you tell me&mdash;"</p>
<p>With a gesture of despair, Scarsdale rose from his chair, and placed the
room with a monotony which began to jar on the nerves of his fair
companion.</p>
<p>"Oh, it is exactly as I have said," he muttered. "There will be nothing
saved from the wreck."</p>
<p>"But how did you hear it?" Ellen asked. "Grant told me. I blame myself
bitterly now that I have taken so little interest in the business. But they
always assured me how perfectly safe it was, and, indeed, have always hinted to
me that they preferred my room to my company."</p>
<p>"Still, I don't quite understand," Ellen said. "What could you possibly have
to do with it?"</p>
<p>"I hardly understand myself," Philip said ruefully. "As far as I can
understand some two hundred thousand pounds of our clients' money was passed on
to Spencer to invest. Instead of doing that he seems to have spent it all, and
forged deeds to show that the thing was all right. Now the whole story has come
out. Spencer has committed suicide. It is a dreadful business."</p>
<p>Ellen Scarsdale was beginning slowly to comprehend. The prospect was so
terrible that the pretty mouth drooped and the clear gray eyes filled with
tears.</p>
<p>"For heaven's sake, don't do that," Scarsdale said hoarsely. "Don't blame me
now. I have nothing to do with it."</p>
<p>"I'll try to be brave, Phil," the girl said with an effort. "But this is a
terrible shock to me. You know how passionately fond I am of beautiful things,
and how proud I am of my lovely old house. And to think it will all have to go!
At the same time there is something in your manner that suggests that you have
not told me everything. As your wife&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I know that," Phillip said despairingly. "You are quite
right&mdash;there are things connected with this unfortunate affair which I
cannot tell to anybody. I am pledged to secrecy. At the same time there is
something that you must acquit me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Disgrace!" the girl cried.</p>
<p>"There is disgrace and dishonour behind this thing which is infinitely worse
than the loss of all our money. Do not tell me that my own husband&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no," Scarsdale cried. "I swear to you that so far as I am concerned
none have the right to use my name disdainfully."</p>
<p>"But I am your wife," Ellen Scarsdale protested. "And if you refuse to tell
me all, I must draw&mdash;"</p>
<p>Scarsdale crossed the room and took his wife's slender hands in his. The
pressure of his fingers was so strong that the flashing sapphires and diamonds
cut into the girl's flesh and left little livid marks there. She looked up
proudly into her husband's face. She saw a light almost like madness in his
eyes.</p>
<p>"Let me remind you of something," he said, hoarsely. "You have known me
nearly all my life; can you point to one act of mine of which I need to be
ashamed? I hate to have to remind you of the past, Nell, but you compel me to
do it. It is a thousand pities that with so sweet and generous a nature as
yours, you cannot eradicate from it that vein of suspiciousness which gives you
as much pain as it does me. Three years ago it was nearly brought home to me
that I was guilty of cheating at cards at the club at Landford. An ingenious
plot&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't, Phil; please don't!" Ellen Scarsdale said brokenly. A vivid
crimson stained her face, she hung her head piteously. "You promised me never
to refer to that shameful doubt of mine again."</p>
<p>"But, my dear girl, you forced me to it," Scarsdale cried passionately. "You
came to me after the cloud had passed away, for I should never have come to
you, though never for a moment did I cease to love you. You came to me,
and&mdash;well, we need not speak of that any more."</p>
<p>"But why humiliate me like this?" Ellen said. "Because, my dear, you
humiliate me. You promised me then that you would trust me in the future
whatever happened, however appearances might be against me. And here, the first
time that I am compelled to keep a secret from you, you look at me in that cold
suspicious manner which cuts me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, you are right&mdash;you are right, and I am a thousand times wrong!"
Ellen exclaimed. "I know it is no fault of yours, and I am not going to blame
you for a moment. If we have to dispose of everything and leave our lovely old
house I will try to show you how brave and uncomplaining I can be. But I shall
never forgive Hubert Grant for dragging you into this. He must be a bad
man&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You are quite mistaken," Scarsdale said as he glanced hastily at the clock.
"I trust Grant implicitly. If you are going to get to Levertons in time for
dinner you will have to leave at once."</p>
<p>Ellen fairly started. She had forgotten all about his dinner engagement at
Sir Bruce Leverton's, though she had been waiting impatiently half an hour
before for Scarsdale's home-coming.</p>
<p>"But you will come along," she pleaded.</p>
<p>"My dearest girl, I cannot. Believe me, I would if I could, but I am
expecting some letters here to-night that must be answered at once. There is
just a shadow of a chance that we may right this thing yet by keeping a brave
face before the world. I want you to go to this dinner as if nothing had
happened. I want you to be brave and smiling at your sunny self. Morton may be
here at any moment, and it is quite easy to make an excuse for me."</p>
<p>"I had quite forgotten all about Mr. Morton," Ellen said with an equanimity
which cost her an effort, "and I will do everything I can. It will be a
terrible ordeal driving four miles on a dark night with a chattering magpie
like Robert Morton. I am quite at a loss to understand why you induced Sir
Bruce to allow you to bring a man to dinner whom our kind host has never
seen."</p>
<p>"It is a question of politics," Scarsdale explained. "With all his
chattering inanities, Morton will be a very useful man to Sir Bruce in the
coming electoral campaign."</p>
<p>At the same moment a footman entered the room bearing a telegram which he
handed to his master. A little smile played about Scarsdale's lips.</p>
<p>"You are well out of one worry, at any rate," he said. "Morton has been
detained at the last moment, as this telegram from Landlord proves. To cut it
short, Morton can't go to the dinner to-night, and he has asked me to convey
his regrets to Sir Bruce."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right." Ellen sighed. "It would have been a terrible ordeal
for me to have to meet all those people with such a burden on my mind. Mind
you, I am not complaining."</p>
<p>Scarsdale kissed his wife passionately. He was glad in spite of everything
to notice her stern determination and strength of purpose. More than once he
had wondered in his dreamy speculative way what kind of a helpmate Ellen would
make if adversity fell upon them. In his heart of hearts he had not been
sanguine that she would prove of high courage, but he began to think
differently now. All the girl's whiteness of face and agitated expression of
features had vanished. She stood there bold and resolute, a dash of colour in
her cheeks, a brilliant light in her gray eyes. In some subtle way she seemed
to have grown older, more matronly, and yet, in a fashion, still more
beautiful. Perhaps it was the awakening of the woman who rises to sublime
heights in the hour of need.</p>
<p>"I could not love you more than I do," Scarsdale said unsteadily, "but never
till this moment have I admired you in the way I admire you now. There is
something about the pose of your head, the flash of your eyes, that gives me
new strength and courage. I feel that we are going to win, and that we shall
pull through in spite of every thing. I wish I could tell you&mdash;"</p>
<p>The words were not finished, for Ellen had her hand upon her husband's
mouth.</p>
<p>"Do not say any more." she said. "I am having a liberal education to-night,
and now as I have nearly five miles to drive, and it is close on 8 o'clock, I
will ask you to see me into the carriage."</p>
<p>"You can trust me implicitly," Scarsdale replied. "I know it is a commonly
accepted axiom that a man tells his wife everything, and in nine cases out of
ten it is only right that he should, but in this instance I am in honour bound
to keep my own counsel. I know you will not tempt me."</p>
<p>"Not for worlds," Ellen cried. "I know that I shall hear everything when the
time comes, and I know that, come what may, you will emerge from this matter
with clean hands."</p>
<p>Scarsdale appeared as if about to say something, then checked himself. On
that point he did not feel in the least sanguine. True, he had been no more
than a mere passenger in the business of his firm, but on the other hand, he
had signed documents, terribly compromising documents, without so much as
looking at them, and he had sufficient knowledge of worldly affairs to know
that a judge and jury might take a harsh view of his conduct. In his
imaginative way he had already conjured up visions of the detective's hands
upon his shoulder and himself standing in the dock. He turned away from the
contemplation of these gloomy things and offered his arm to his wife. If she
could smile and be brave, it was a poor thing if he could not do the same.</p>
<p>"Come along," he said almost gaily. "Let me wrap you up well, for it is a
cold night, and a great deal of wind is blowing. Poor little girl, it will be
some time, I expect, before you ride behind a pair of blood horses wrapped up
in furs again."</p>
<p>Ellen was in the carriage at length, snugly ensconsed in her warm wraps, and
trying to conceal behind a smile the sinking of her heart. She forced a word or
two to her lips, then, as the carriage shot into the darkness, she dashed the
tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>"I must be brave," she murmured. "For his sake, I must be brave and
resolute. To think that I should go so far as to accuse Phil of actual
dishonour."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;A Desperate Expedient.</h2>
<p>The brougham flashed along in the darkness of the night bearing its fair
burden in the direction of the residence of Sir Bruce Leverton, which fine old
country house stood some five miles distant from Scarsdale place. As she drove
along with the fresh crude air on her face, Ellen gradually recovered her
courage. She had fully made up her mind to show Philip what she was made of,
though she bitterly regretted the repetition of that suspicious bias which had
come near to wrecking her own life three years before. She recalled now how she
had forced her pride down and actually gone out of her way to see Philip and
implore his forgiveness. She recollected that incident as vividly as if it had
only been yesterday. How stern he had been at first, and yet with a look in his
eyes that belied his manner, and how noble and forgiving he had been long
before a confession was made, how he had almost commanded her never to refer to
it again. It would be almost as well perhaps for adversity to come so that
Ellen could prove herself in deeds as well as words.</p>
<p>The wind was rising higher, there was no moon, and the sky was tilled with
ragged clouds. Darker and darker it grew until presently in the narrow throat
of a lane the brougham almost stopped. There had been something approaching a
gale the previous night and the roadway was strewn with broken branches.
Presently a figure appeared out of the gloom and held up his hand for a signal
for the coachman to stop. Ellen could hear words passing.</p>
<p>"What is the matter?" she said with her head out of the window. "Has
anything gone wrong here?"</p>
<p>The muffled figure by the roadside muttered something to the effect that a
branch of a tree lay across the road a little further on, and that progress was
impossible until it had been removed. Already the coachman and footman were
down from their seats and without much trouble managed to drag the obstacle
away. Vaguely alarmed, Ellen had had the carriage door open so that she could
see what was taking place, as far as it was possible to see anything in the
gloom. Once the path was clear the stranger intimated that he would close the
door. He gave a sharp command to the coachman, and the brougham plunged on, but
not before the stranger had entered the brougham and coolly closed the door
behind him. Ellen, more indignant than alarmed, would have pulled the check
string had not the stranger anticipated her movement.</p>
<p>"I implore you to do nothing rash," he said in a pleasant even voice.
"Please do not imagine that I am a modern equivalent of Dick Turpin and other
famous knights of the road. As a matter of fact, I am making my way to Grant
Lea, as I have most important business there. You will pardon me, I am
sure."</p>
<p>The speaker struck a match and held it in front of his face. It was by no
means a bad type of face, fairly handsome and refined, and lighted by a pair of
dark resolute eyes. The mouth was partially concealed under a dark trim
moustache, but all the same, the power of it was there. Ellen gave a little
gasp.</p>
<p>"Hubert Grant," she exclaimed. "I recognise you from your photograph.
Really, could audacity go any further? If I did my duty I should stop the
brougham at once and insist upon detaining you until the police have been
communicated with."</p>
<p>Grant smiled sadly. "If I ask you to believe that I am innocent as your
husband himself, would you believe me?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Why should I?" Ellen cried indignantly. "Why do you treat me as if I were a
child? Your partner has gone to his account with his crimes on his bead, and
you are a fugitive from justice&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Possibly," Grant went on in the same quiet fashion. "Nobody could possibly
know all the circumstances of the case except myself. And your husband knows if
I can only keep clear of the law for the next few days; there is just a
possibility that I may right the wrong yet and save everybody from loss. If, on
the other hand I fall into the hands of the police then the ruin is complete
and irrecoverable. It is in your hands to give me the chance that I need. Will
you do it?"</p>
<p>"You must be mad," Ellen exclaimed, "to come to me of all women with such a
story as this&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You may believe me or not, but I am as innocent of wrong intent as
yourself," Grant replied. "I know you refuse to believe me, I know you will
betray me and regret it ever afterwards. And now I am going to make an appeal
to your woman's nature. I am going to remind you of an episode that happened in
your own past. Do not forget the time when you declined to believe in the
honour of your own husband, and nearly wrecked his happiness because of your
unworthy suspicions."</p>
<p>"How dare you?" Ellen gasped. "How dare&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I dare, because I am a desperate man with his back to the wall. I swear to
you that all I say about myself is true. I will ask you to give me the benefit
of the doubt as you would have given it to Philip Scarsdale three years ago.
You should have learnt the lesson then, that however terribly appearances may
be against one, there may always be an answer to the charge. I implore you by
all that you hold sacred and holy to give me the chance that I need. Believe
me, I would never have given you pain by alluding to that episode in
Scarsdale's life if I had not hoped to have touched your heart thereby.
Appearances were terribly against him, and everybody thought him guilty. You
cannot look me in the face and say that you were not absolutely sure of
it."</p>
<p>"I cannot," Ellen blushed and faltered. "Oh, why do you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am compelled," Grant went on. "No slur has ever been put upon my
character till now, no breath of suspicion touched Scarsdale till the time I
speak of. And yet, in the face of absolute proof of guilt, he was innocent. I
declare to you with all the force in my power that I am innocent also. I
declare to you that if you gave me this chance I have an opportunity of
righting the wrong. That is why I am here to-night. I knew that your husband
would not accompany you to-night, because he expects an important visitor. I
also was aware of the fact that Mr. Morton was coming along with you, and I
managed to get him out of the way by a simple ruse that I need not go into now.
It was perhaps fortunate that the branch of a broken tree barred your progress,
but I had another scheme or two for getting into your brougham. I dare not walk
because I feel convinced that there is a trap waiting for me a little later on.
It is absolutely necessary that I should see May Leverton to-night."</p>
<p>"I cannot do it," Ellen cried. "It is impossible that I should mix myself up
with this affair. It may seem foolish, no doubt, it may sound utterly illogical
and absurd, but I have a kind of feeling that you are telling me the
truth."</p>
<p>"Well. God bless you for that." Grant said, allowing something like emotion
for the first time. "It is good when all the world is against one to feel that
there is one person left, who is disposed to listen to the other side of the
story, but I implore you, I will go on my knees to you if you like, to get me
inside Grant Lea just for one hour this evening. I must see May, indeed, she is
expecting me. If you will consent to this arrangement, you will be the means of
averting a great deal of misery and sorrow."</p>
<p>"But how can I possibly do it?" Ellen asked. She was yielding in spite of
herself; she was being carried away by Grant's pleas. "How can I do this
preposterous thing? I am dining with Sir Bruce to-night. He has an exceedingly
large party for his birthday celebration, and all invited guests&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Precisely," Grant said eagerly. "That is exactly where your opportunity
comes in. If May were only here I am certain she would add her protestations to
mine. The time is close at hand&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But I can do nothing to help you," Ellen said. "I can do no more then take
you to the front door at Grant Lea."</p>
<p>"You must do more, you really must." Grant said hoarsely. "It is absolutely
imperative that I should find my way into the house, and that in a legitimate
fashion. I should like you to fall in with my suggestion. There is a certain
amount of risk about it."</p>
<p>"Tell me what it is?" Ellen asked. She was curious and interested in spite
of herself. "What wild idea is it?"</p>
<p>"That I should come as Mr. Morton," Grant suggested coolly. "Pray do not
interrupt me. I thought this all out to-day, and fortune favoured me in the
knowledge that circumstances would prevent your husband being present at the
dinner to-night. Then, I adopted the expedient which has sent Mr. Morton off on
a wild goose chase to the other end of England. Morton is a man who has only
one object in view, and that is the making of money. I have so arranged it that
he is likely to be detained some time in the North&mdash;after the end of the
week he can come back and welcome. Do you follow?"</p>
<p>"Precisely," Ellen said trying to speak coldly. "You are asking me to play a
disgraceful trick upon a dear old friend of the family, and be party to
introducing under his roof a man who is a fugitive from justice. I must aid in
this disgraceful proceeding, and be the means of bringing you to Grant Lea as
an honoured guest. It seems incredible that you should dare to breach such an
idea to me."</p>
<p>"And yet there is no other way out of it. As I told you before it is
absolutely imperative that I should see May to-night."</p>
<p>"Does she know that you are coming?" Ellen asked.</p>
<p>"Her life's happiness depends upon it."</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed," Ellen said scornfully, "May is a great friend of mine, and I
had no idea up to now that she was a consummate actress. Why, if you walked
into the drawing-room and I had the hardihood to introduce you as Mr. Morton,
May would betray herself at once. No, no, you must not ask me to do this thing.
Even if the imposture were never discovered, I should blush with shame whenever
I think of it. Besides, if every thing goes as smoothly as you say it may, Sir
Bruce is bound to know sooner or later."</p>
<p>"Ah, then it would not matter," Grant said eagerly. "I should have saved the
situation, and Sir Bruce would thank you as heartily as he would subsequently
thank me. And now, my dear lady, do let me try once more to persuade you to
undertake what I ask. You will never, never regret it, and after all is said
and done whatever Sir Bruce might think, you have been guilty of no more than
an act of impertinence. See, here are the lights of the house&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no," Ellen cried. "I really cannot listen to you any longer. When we
reach the portico you can get out of the brougham, and I will try to forget
this extraordinary adventure. Besides myself and my husband, none shall ever
know of it."</p>
<p>Further conversation was prevented by the sudden pulling up of the carriage,
and before the door could be opened by the footmen a portly figure in evening
dress had rushed down the steps, he held out a hand through the carriage window
and grasped Ellen's fingers with a heartiness and fervour which was
embarrassing.</p>
<p>"So you have come at last," Sir Bruce cried. "It is so late that I began to
fear that some accident had happened to you. Come along. This gentleman, I
presume is Mr. Morton."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.&mdash;On The Thorns.</h2>
<p>A cruel crimson stained Ellen's cheeks. She could feel the hot blood burn
and sting to the roots of her hair. It seemed to her that never before had
woman been placed in such a trying predicament. Duty was plain before her, too,
honour and honesty impelled her to speak the truth, and denounce the man who
had thrust his company where it was the least wanted.</p>
<p>"Hello, Philip hasn't come," Sir Bruce went on cheerfully. "How is that? Has
he been detained?"</p>
<p>Ellen found voice to speak at last. She wondered if her old friend noticed
how strained and hoarse her tones were.</p>
<p>"He was kept at the last moment by most important business," she said. "He
told me to say how sorry he was&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, well, it doesn't much matter," Sir Bruce replied. "I can manage to do
without Phil so long as he has sent you to take his place. At the same time, I
was getting very anxious about you. Come along in. Mr. Morton, I am very
pleased to meet you. It was very good of you to come over at so short a
notice."</p>
<p>Now was the time to speak or never. Grant had alighted from the brougham and
seemed to be hesitating just a moment whether he should take Sir Bruce's hand
or not. Lady Leverton bustled forward and kissed Ellen affectionately in her
own warm-hearted way.</p>
<p>"Do come up to the fire and warm yourself," she cried. "You are as pale as a
ghost. I hear that Phil could not come. Is that Mr. Morton who came with you?
He seems a nice type of man as far as I can judge, and not at all like the
effeminate chatterbox Phil described him to be."</p>
<p>"He is a stranger in the neighbourhood," Ellen said faintly. "For my part, I
am disposed to like the man."</p>
<p>Lady Leverton was rambling on, but Ellen was not paying the least attention.
She managed to ask presently what had become of May, and why she was so late in
appearing.</p>
<p>"May is always late, as you know," Lady Leverton said. "I think I can hear
her coming down the stairs now."</p>
<p>Ellen could stand the strain no longer. "I'll go and meet her," she said.
"There is a little matter I want to speak to her about. You will excuse me, I
know."</p>
<p>Ellen reached the hall just in time to intercept a slight graceful figure in
white coming down the stairs. Usually May Leverton was sunshine itself. Her
pleasant face was welcome everywhere, and her charm of manner was equal to her
charm of features. But as the light fell on her face now, Ellen could see that
she was deathly pale, and that there were rings under her eyes that spoke
eloquently of tears. The pitiful face lighted slightly as Ellen came forward
and kissed her friend.</p>
<p>"Surely you can't go into the drawing-room looking like that," she
whispered. "You would not be recognised. Never before have I seen you without a
smile upon your face. What is the matter?"</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you," May whispered. "At least, I cannot tell you here. My
father knows nothing of my trouble. I have striven to conceal it from him, but
there are moments when the pain is more than I can bear. Stay here with me a
minute or two and I will try to regain my self-possession. Perhaps later on in
the evening I may get a chance to tell you everything. If I do not confide in
somebody I shall lose my reason."</p>
<p>"I think I can guess something of it." Ellen said. "Fate has so ordained it
that I have been brought in to share your secret. You are in bitter trouble
over Hubert Grant."</p>
<p>"You have guessed it," May said in a frightened whisper. "But who told you?
How could you possibly&mdash;?"</p>
<p>"There is no time to discuss that," Ellen interrupted. "Never mind how I
know it. The dinner gong will ring in a minute, and then it will be too late.
Mr. Grant is in the drawing-room at the present moment posing as Mr. Morton,
who has been got out of the way by an ingenious little scheme devised by your
lover. Do you understand that?"</p>
<p>"He came with you?" May murmured. "You brought him? How good and kind it was
of you to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Nothing of the kind," Ellen said impatiently. "He thrust himself upon me in
such a manner that I had to act a lie and play a part which is strictly
dishonourable. And all this to aid a man who has helped to reduce us to the
point of ruin. But my indignation gets the better of me and makes me forget how
critical the situation is. That is all you have to remember&mdash;that 'Mr.
Morton' is really your lover, and you are to act us it you had never seen him
before. My cheeks burn with shame when I think of the part that I am playing,
but it is too late for remorse now."</p>
<p>May murmured something in the way of thanks. Once in the drawing-room her
manner came as something in the way of a revelation to Ellen. She had never
looked for self control in May, and was surprised how perfectly she ruled her
feelings.</p>
<p>The dinner proceeded smoothly enough as such things do in well appointed
households. There was a babel and chatter of voices, the clash of knives and
forks and the soft footsteps of well-trained servants. It seemed almost
impossible to identify that fine old Jacobean dining-room with the elements of
a tragedy. Surely crime and dishonesty could have no connection with the rose
tinted lights and banks of flowers upon the table. It seemed impossible to
believe that the man opposite with the dark moustache was almost within the
grasp of the law. From the top of the table came broken fragments of a
conversation which gripped Ellen and made her almost breathless.</p>
<p>"A most disastrous affair," one of the elderly ladies were saying. "It seems
a dreadful thing that men calling themselves gentlemen can stoop to such
meanness. They say that the poor creature is absolutely penniless. Ten
thousands a year gone in one fell swoop. Of course, the boys will have to leave
Oxford and Eton and turn out to get their own living. Thank goodness, my
husband never had the least faith in lawyers. He always insisted on keeping all
his securities at his bank. If Lady Barrington had done the same thing I am
perfectly certain&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say that Lady Barrington is in the Spencer smash," Sir
Bruce cried.</p>
<p>"Well, I am sorry to hear that. I thought that in this country, at any rate,
there were none of Spencer and Grant's unfortunate clients. By the way, have
they got hold of the missing man yet? You have just come down from town, Mr.
Morton, is there anything fresh to tell?"</p>
<p>The stranger looked up and shook his head. Ellen was glad enough at length
when Lady Leverton rose from the table and gave the signal for a move to the
drawing-room. Once in the drawing-room May came up and led her away under a
pretence of examining some new flower in the conservatory.</p>
<p>"I don't know how I existed through dinner," the girl said. "Nobody noticed
it, but I have not had a mouthful of anything to eat. To see him sitting there
opposite me as if nothing had happened was terrible. And yet I feel, in spite
of everything, that Hubert is innocent of the terrible charge that hangs over
his head. But I suppose he will have an opportunity of explaining presently.
Nell, you must so contrive it that we can be left alone together."</p>
<p>"I will do that if I can," Ellen promised. "I have embarked so far on a
career of duplicity that a little thing like that cannot matter, and like you,
though against my better judgment, I have a feeling that Mr. Grant is more
sinned against than sinning. But surely, Sir Bruce and Lady Leverton know
something of the friendship between Hubert Grant and yourself?"</p>
<p>"Indeed they don't, my dear Nell. You forget that for the best part of the
past year my people have not been in London at all. They don't even know yet
that I have met Mr. Grant. There is a prejudice against him. We had a fancy to
keep our engagement a secret till Hubert had come down here and I could
introduce him. I hope you will not blame me."</p>
<p>"You cannot be any more surprised than I was," Ellen replied. "I recognised
Mr. Grant from his photograph. Phil could not come this evening, as he was
detained on some wretched business connected with the failure of Spencer and
Grant."</p>
<p>"One moment," May said eagerly. "I did not have time to discuss the point
before dinner. You hinted at the fact that Phil was more or less involved in
the downfall. I do hope that you have not suffered any very great loss."</p>
<p>"My dear, we are absolutely ruined," Ellen said calmly. "Not only have we
lost everything but I am afraid that Phil is involved in something like
disgrace as well. But we need not go into that yet, because I really do not
know. You were asking me just now how I came in contact with Mr. Grant, and
what strange circumstances brought him here. I suppose he planned the whole
thing in his mind, knowing perfectly well that Phil could not get here
to-night. He managed to get Mr. Morton out of the way, then waited for my
brougham on the road. The rest was quite easy. I was so taken by surprise that
I just did nothing, and when once that man began to plead with me, I was
foolish enough to hesitate, and once I hesitated I was lost. But in justice to
myself, I may say that I refused to be a party to this imposture till we
reached your house. Unluckily, Sir Bruce was rather anxious about me, and he
was standing on the doorstep when we got here. He jumped at once to the natural
conclusion that Mr. Grant was Mr. Morton, and the two were shaking hands
together before I could get a word out. Oh, I know that my duty was quite
plain. I know exactly what I should have done. But what woman with a heart in
her bosom could have behaved in any other way. Filled with shame and
humiliation as I was, I allowed the imposture to pass, I held my tongue and the
thing was done. What Sir Bruce will say when he knows the truth&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't let us talk about that," May said with a catch in her voice. "You
acted just like the noble creature that you are, and I am perfectly certain
that in the end good will come of it. You are the only one I have to confide in
at the present moment, and if you are cold and distant to me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am neither cold nor distant," Ellen said, "and I will do all I can to
help you. And now, as I hear the voices of the man in the drawing-room, we had
better return for the present."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.&mdash;The Unexpected Guest.</h2>
<p>It was some considerable time before Ellen managed to bring about the
meeting between Hubert Grant and May. It seemed to Ellen's guilty fancy that
she was being watched and suspected. But the opportunity came at length when an
adjournment was made to the billiard room, and the rest of the party sat down
to the intolerable, and inevitable game of bridge. Ellen excused herself under
the plea of a headache, which was by no means a fiction on her part, and Grant
appeared to be deeply immersed in some Parliamentary papers which he had just
been discussing with his host. A moment later, the trio were in the
conservatory together.</p>
<p>"Don't be any longer than you can help," Ellen said wearily. "I have ordered
the brougham for half-past ten. I have had some pleasant evenings here, some of
the pleasantest in my life. But I never expected the time to come when I should
be counting the minutes previous to my departure from Grant Lea."</p>
<p>Ellen turned away without another word, and went back to the
drawing-room.</p>
<p>It was quiet and subdued in the conservatory. The shaded lights invited
confidence. The thick belts of palms and flowers hid the lovers from view. For
a time they were absolutely silent. Grant holding May's hands in his and
looking down into her white sad face. An unsteady smile wavered on her
lips.</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to kiss me?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I hardly dare to," Grant said hoarsely. "Oh, I know what you would say. I
know how good and true and loyal you are. You would tell me, if I would let
you, that this terrible thing would make no difference to us. Is not that so,
dearest?"</p>
<p>"A thousand times yes," May whispered. "I was stunned when I saw this
morning's paper. It seemed incredible to me that such a thing could happen to a
firm like yours. I felt sure that you would be the first to stand up and defend
your character, and I must say I was disappointed&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of course you would be disappointed." Grant said sadly. "It was the action
of a scoundrel for me to run away and hide myself in the way I did. I will
explain presently if I have time. But we are wasting the precious minutes. I
had to hit upon this idea after getting your telegram. I suppose you managed to
get home safely last night?"</p>
<p>"It was awful," May said sadly. "It was most difficult for me to get back
without being discovered. And now as to yourself?"</p>
<p>Grant bent down and kissed May's white lips passionately.</p>
<p>"I cannot help it," he said, contritely. "I am most grateful to know that
there is one person who still believes in me. Let me tell you, my dearest girl,
there was nobody more utterly overwhelmed than myself when I heard the news of
my partner's frauds. So far as I knew, there was no reason whatever why my
partner should take his own life. Our man Raybold has known what had been going
on for the last two years. He showed me, that not only were we absolutely
bankrupt, but that an enormous amount of money belonging to our clients had
disappeared. There are other complications which I need not go into, because
you would not understand them."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," May sighed. "I know nothing about business, but with you who
are so keen and clever, it is quite another thing. It seems almost impossible
to believe that all this could go on without our knowledge. I may be
wrong&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, it is quite natural," Grant went on. "You see, in most big offices, the
financial side of the business is conducted by one partner alone. I had the
most implicit trust in Spencer. His reputation stood exceedingly high in the
city, and I was under the impression that he had a large private income of his
own. As a matter of fact, he must have been bankrupt when I went into the firm.
And the worst of if is that scores and scores of forged leases and mortgages
and such things have passed through my hands. There are letters and documents
bearing my signature which, tendered as evidence against me in a court of
justice, would inevitably mean a long term of imprisonment. It would not be the
slightest use for me to say that I knew nothing of what was going on, for no
judge or jury would dream of believing me. Unfortunately for me, I am of
somewhat of an extravagant nature, and this would tell against me also."</p>
<p>"Is that all you have to tell me?" May said in a somewhat disappointed tone.
"I thought that perhaps you had made some extraordinary discovery calculated
to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am coming to that," Grant said. "As you may be aware, my late partner has
a small suite of rooms in town where he stays when he is detained late on
business. You see, when I found out all these dreadful things I had just over
an hour in which to act and make up my mind what to do, and in my late
partner's flat I certainly found something which startled me greatly. I cannot
tell you what it is, because as yet I cannot speak definitely myself. Before I
could put my plan into execution, I had undergone a most unpleasant interview
with regard to a client who eagerly wanted the chance to pull us down. Quite by
accident, too, Scarsdale discovered that this client had applied for and
obtained a warrant for my arrest. I could see at once that it was absolutely
fatal to my new scheme for me to fall into the hands of justice. There was no
time to take the papers I had discovered to the one person who might throw some
light upon them, so I determined to fly and come down here and see you at the
first opportunity. Your telegram gave me the information I needed. It is a very
lamentable thing how a man's friends fall away from him at the first breath of
misfortune. With you it is so different."</p>
<p>"Yes, it is different with me," May said. There were tears of sympathy in
her eyes, her sensitive lips quivered. "I will do anything you ask me to do. I
will forget all my own troubles&mdash;''</p>
<p>"I fancy I have settled those at any rate, dearest," Grant smiled. "I have
not time to tell you everything, because the story is a long one. I have here a
packet which I now give into your charge with a paper full of definite
instructions as to what is to be done. The mission is not without a certain
element of danger, and I am putting my whole future into your hands. If your
task is successful, then I shall come boldly forward and demand an
investigation of the whole affair. But for the next day or two it is
imperatively necessary that I should be at liberty to follow up my discovery,
as nobody else could do it. You will understand how anxious I am to prove my
innocence, even if it is only for your sake. When I come to think of
it&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You have discovered something out of the ordinary," May cried. "I know you
have by your manner. Won't you tell me what it is?"</p>
<p>"I dare not," Grant rallied. "In the first place, I want you to appear as a
perfectly innocent party who knows nothing of the facts of the case. But this I
may tell you&mdash;I have made a discovery so terrible and so startling that I
am almost afraid to think of it myself. But I cannot tell you what it is at
present, May. I am sure that when you know everything, as you must sooner or
later, you will feel convinced that I acted for the best. Now, it only remains
for me to give you the packet and ask you to act on the instructions which you
will find inside. I suppose you will have no difficulty in getting up and down
to London without a lot of inquisitive questions being asked."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, there will be no trouble about that," May said. "My aunt, Mrs.
Mayfield, is always glad to see me, and indeed I often run up to her house for
a day or two when I have nothing else to do. You need not have any uneasiness
on that score, but I am troubled about yourself, Hubert. Ellen Scarsdale will
be leaving for home very shortly, and you will have to accompany her in the
brougham, at any rate part of the way home. What are you going to do with
yourself afterwards? It is a terrible torture for me to think that you are
absolutely homeless and houseless&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not quite that," Grant said with a tender smile. "I am not absolutely
without friends, or I should not be here to-night. You see, I had to have some
shelter for my head or I could not have changed into evening dress as I have
done. As a matter of fact, an old companion of mine is at present in Fairford,
ostensibly down here for a few days' holiday. I am sharing his lodging, and he,
it was, who drove me to the spot where I intercepted Mrs. Scarsdale's carriage.
When I leave here presently I shall only go as far as the lodge gates with Mrs.
Scarsdale, for the dogcart will be waiting for me in the road. I hope you will
not be awake at night thinking of me as a homeless wanderer, for really I am
nothing of the sort. Now, is there anything else that you would like to say to
me before we go back to the drawing-room? Bless my soul, I am forgetting a most
important part of my mission here. Those diamonds that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Presently," May whispered. "It is really terrible to think about myself
just now. Do not go for a few minutes yet. Goodness knows when I shall see you
again."</p>
<p>They lingered a few moments longer talking of their personal affairs till
the clock struck the half-hour after ten, and Ellen in the drawing-room rose to
her feet with a deep sigh of relief. The dreadful evening was over at length,
and she was free to depart now without any questions on the part of her host
and hostess. From where she seated she could see dimly into the recesses of the
conservatory. She could just make out the forms of May and Grant as they came
towards her. It was very still and quiet in the drawing-room, so quiet indeed
that voices of servants could be heard in the hall and some third party
protesting vigorously and demanding to see Sir Bruce Leverton without delay. As
the sound of that voice broke on Ellen's ears all the blood seemed to leave her
heart and she stood there as if she were turned to stone.</p>
<p>"Very well, very well," her strained ears caught Sir Bruce's voice a moment
later. "Some extraordinary mistake, of course. If you won't mind standing there
I will go and speak to Mrs. Scarsdale. I won't detain you a moment."</p>
<p>The voice made some reply, and Sir Bruce came along hurriedly in the
direction of the drawing-room. At the same moment, Grant and May stood under
the alcove leading to the conservatory.</p>
<p>"Back a moment," Ellen whispered. "Go back into the conservatory. Something
very dreadful has happened. Ask no questions, but do what I tell you without
delay."</p>
<p>The two figures vanished obediently.</p>
<p>Almost before they had done so, Sir Bruce came into the drawing-room. There
was a puzzled expression on his face. He looked just a little excited and
annoyed. He crossed over to Ellen, and laid his hand on her arm.</p>
<p>"Most curious thing," he said. "Here is a man looking like a gentleman
turned up claiming to be Mr. Morton. Come out and convince him that he is the
imposture I take him to be."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.&mdash;Midas Up To Date.</h2>
<p>The strange tragedy resulting in the disappearance of Paul Spencer did not
pass unnoticed in the City of London. Spencer had been a power there for many
years, and the story of the crime produced a grave impression. It came, too,
just at a time when there was something in the nature of a financial crisis, so
that quite early in the day sinister rumours were in the air. Paul Spencer had
not been shot at all; he had committed suicide. The only one who had witnessed
his death was his own partner, and surely no man ever had a more strange or
unlikely story to tell!</p>
<p>Long before midday the city had made up its mind. The firm of Spencer and
Grant was hopelessly bankrupt, and the senior partner had made away with
himself. Robert Morton brought the news to Julius Cardella in the latter's
private room at Lexington House. Here the great financier presided over upwards
of a thousand employees, transacting business all over the world.</p>
<p>And yet five years ago Cardella had not been heard of. He had come
mysteriously out of nowhere, and taken his place amongst London's great
capitalists. He was supposed to have done something amazing in the Argentine
Republic, which resulted in a million or two. He had a house in Park Lane, a
'cottage' on the coast near Fairford, and a dozen other establishments in
various parts of the country. He had given a million for an historic picture
gallery, and last, but not least, he was the husband of Carmen Sandoris, the
greatest tragic actress the world had ever seen. There was some thing
dazzlingly romantic about this man's position. He sat at his desk&mdash;a
little swarthy man with keen beady eyes and curly hair, looking as little like
the accepted portrait of the capitalist as possible. Asked as to his
nationality, he would have said that he was a Spaniard&mdash;as a matter of
fact he was a pure Cockney, and had been born in a mews in Bermondsey.</p>
<p>He looked up quickly as Morton came in, the latter, immaculately dressed,
stood out in vivid contrast to his companion. There was an air of silly
affectation about him that made him usually the butt of his companion's wit.
But the man was keen and shrewd, and unscrupulous enough where his own ends
were concerned. He posed for a city failure, but there were one or two people
who knew better than that.</p>
<p>"I suppose you know all about it?" he asked. Cardella nodded. He motioned
Morton to a chair.</p>
<p>"I read it in an early addition of some evening paper as I came here,"
Cardella said. "Is there anything fresh since this morning?"</p>
<p>"No fresh news, if that is what you mean. But people are talking, of course.
There is a rumour to the effect that Spencer committed suicide because he could
not face his creditors. They say that the concern is hopelessly bankrupt, and
that Grant engineered the whole swindle."</p>
<p>"All of which you contradicted, of course," Cardella said, with a sardonic
grin. "Of course. I'm so very fond of Grant. He's always so nice to me! For
once rumour speaks the truth, as you and I can tell. It ought to, seeing that
we have devoted the last year or more to smashing up Spencer and Grant. We've
got our man ready. The only question now is as to when we had better apply for
a warrant. It's a big triumph for us."</p>
<p>Cardella made no response to this exulting remark. He had worked almost
solely for this for many months past, and the prize would be enormous. But
there was a moody look on his face and just a gleam of anxiety in his shifty
eyes.</p>
<p>"I don't want to risk it," he said. "There are one or two little things
requiring attention. If you don't hear from me to the contrary, move after
lunch. That Quogga business is not quite in order yet. And we must get that
concession whatever happens. There are millions in it if properly worked, and
nobody knows how to work it as we do. Lord knows I want the money. If I wasn't
so anxious I should laugh. It's only by sheer impudence and bluff that I have
kept my word up so far. People trust me as if I were a god. If they only knew!
What a yelping pack I should have at my heels! Still, if the Quogga affair
comes off all right I shall be really a rich man. Now you go down to-night as
arranged with Scarsdale and dine with Sir Bruce Leverton. You must get him to
come in. His name will be useful. If he declines, drop him a hint as to his
wife's bridge debts and Lady Mossingford's jewellery. But he is pretty sure to
bite without that. After the dinner party is over, drive to my place near
Fairford, and see me. I'm going down there till Monday. For once in a way I'm
going to have the week-end to myself. I really want rest and time to think.
There will be no body else but my wife and my self."</p>
<p>Morton nodded as he rose from his chair. He was feeling on more than usually
good terms with himself. Everything was going his way. Cardella sat there for a
long time in gloomy thought. There were hundreds of people who envied his
position, thousands who had followed his advice implicitly. And yet not one
would have changed places with him had they known. He was standing as
perilously near to the dock as Hubert Grant, unless the great coup turned out
successfully. He was still puzzling out the smaller points in the problem when
the door of the office opened, and Carmen Cardella came in.</p>
<p>She looked very superb, very disdainful and beautiful as she crossed the
room. All the fire and passion of the South slumbered in her eyes; the lips
that might have softened and grown tender for some one favoured man were
compressed now. Here was a lovely volcano cased in ice. Cardella rejoiced in
the presence of this tropical beauty, but her heart was not his. He would have
been startled could he have looked into it.</p>
<p>"This is quite an unexpected honour," he said.</p>
<p>"It is not an honour at all," the woman said, coldly. "I had to come. I have
been down to the theatre to hear the new play read. My part was so
disappointing that I have resigned it. And I can't lunch with your friends as
you suggest. I quite forgot that I had promised to lunch with my old friend
John Smith. Give me some money."</p>
<p>Carmella's eyes gleamed dangerously just for a moment.</p>
<p>"Keep it up," he said. "Play the game for all that it is worth. Ask for a
thousand pounds when I don't know which way to turn for a shilling!"</p>
<p>"A thousand pounds is just the sum I am asking for."</p>
<p>"Only that!" Cardella sneered. "And to think that five years ago you were
glad to get a few shillings a week as chambermaid in a fit-up company! You
don't help me a bit. You are going to throw up a part worth two hundred pounds
a week simply because you don't care for it. I tell you I'm getting sick of the
whole thing. Why did you marry me?"</p>
<p>The woman's eyes flashed for a moment. Her face was full of scorn.</p>
<p>"Because I was a woman," she said. "I don't know what I am now. At any rate
I have kept to my part of the bargain, which is more than you can say. To a
certain extent I have made you what you are. Heavens, how proud of my handiwork
I should be!"</p>
<p>"So should your friend, Mr. John Smith," Cardella laughed. "He discovered
you. But for him you would still have been wasting your talents on fit-up
companies. The eccentric gentleman who can't write plays has a fine eye for
genius. He must have wasted some hundreds of thousands on unsuccessful
productions, but he has given the world a few actresses. Go and lunch with him
by all means if you like. Ask him, down to Fairford if he cares to come. I
might get him into some of my little ventures. Or you might ask him to lend you
some cash. You won't get any out of me to-day."</p>
<p>Carmen Cardella went off presently none the richer for her visit. A great
car in green and gold was waiting for her in the street below. A little crowd
had gathered round watching her respectfully. Everybody there knew who she was;
there was hardly an errand boy in the street who did not know her history.</p>
<p>She went along, calm, dignified, unsmiling, her placid beauty glowing in the
sunshine, a great storm of rage and passion simmering in her heart. There were
times when she hated the world and herself and her husband. Cardella she hated
worst of all. There was no interval of indifference or toleration where he was
concerned. Every moment of her waking hours this hate grew in strength and
volume. She came at length to her destination&mdash;a block of flats in
Brunswick Gardens. She got out of the electric lift on the second floor, and
asked a discreet-looking man servant for Mr. John Smith.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith was awaiting Mrs. Cardella. He came forward jauntily with the
inevitable glass in his eye, the absurd little moustache carefully waxed. He
was a figure for a comic paper, the sort of character made for a stage comedy.
But Mrs. Cardella's manner was cordial enough.</p>
<p>"I am charmed, I am delighted," the little man said. "I hardly expected,
after all, that I should have the honour of lunching with you here. What can I
do to show my appreciation?"</p>
<p>Carmen Cardella dropped into a chair, and slowly pulled off her gloves.</p>
<p>"That is very easily done," she said with one of her rare smiles. "Be
natural. Be yourself as I have seen you on more than one occasion. You can be
both brave and sensible if you like."</p>
<p>"Very well," Mr. Smith said, with a sudden change of manner. "Only I am
bound to keep it up so long as my man is in the room. My dear lady, you do not
properly feel for me. I have a certain amount of money of my own; I have good
health, no anxieties. But I have one great ambition which must remain for ever
unsatisfied. As you know, it is the dream of my life to write a successful
play. Of course, I could hire a theatre and produce a piece as I have done
before now. And the dismal failure of it! I spend thousands on managers, I lend
them money, but they will not look at anything of mine. Therefore I have fallen
back upon the human drama. I construct plots for living actors with the world
for their stage. If any of my friends are in trouble they come to me, and out
of their story I construct a comedy or melodrama, as the case may be."</p>
<p>"My fortune is behind this, as was the fortune of my poor friend Paul
Spencer until everything was gone. You did not know, perhaps, that he had a
mania for the theatre. He spent thousands on his hobby without anybody knowing
it; in fact I did the spending for him. And when his story had to be told I
constructed a plot for him. A most fascinating pursuit! And a very strange
thing that that drama should be mixed up with yours. On the whole I should say
that this is the most successful living drama I ever handled."</p>
<p>"You are a most wonderful man," Mrs. Cardella smiled.</p>
<p>"I'm a wonderful old bore," Mr. Smith cried. "Still, I have had my
successes, and you are one of them, gracious lady. I gave to the world the
greatest tragic actress of her time."</p>
<p>"And one of the most unhappy of her time, dear friend."</p>
<p>"Ah, my beautiful one, we cannot have it both ways. Cardella&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, you have laid your hand on the sore as you can always do. I was
happier in the old days than I am now. I had a man who loved me, and whom I
loved. Then Cardella came along. He plotted to get Carl out of the way; he
hounded him on to his death. My lover was never the criminal they made him out
to be. There was no blood on his hands. But he died the death of a murderer all
the same, and I was desolate. I suppose that is why I married Julius Cardella.
I did not dream, I never expected to discover his black treachery. He knew that
I did not love him, but I was negatively happy till I made the great
discovery."</p>
<p>"He does not know, he does not guess?" Smith asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"He guesses nothing. I am an actress, my friend. And the finest piece of
acting in the world has ever seen takes place with my home in Park Lane for a
setting. I marvel at my own strength, at my own self-restraint. But I am
waiting, waiting. When the proper time comes I shall know how to bring down the
curtain."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.&mdash;By Telephone.</h2>
<p>Carmen Cardella had risen to her feet, her slender figure swayed; the fine
voice had dropped to a clear whisper. She seemed to forget the presence of her
companion for the moment. She was the living breathing embodiment of a great
master passion. She was a woman waiting for her vengeance. It seemed to Smith
that he had never seen anything like it before.</p>
<p>"I owe nothing to that man," she said. "The debt is on the other side. Oh,
if you could only realise how absolutely vile and worthless he is!"</p>
<p>"I am not altogether blind," Smith said drily. "I am watching that drama
with great interest. When the smash comes it will be a stupendous one. And you
will be independent of it, dear lady, because you have your art to fall back
on. I am the man in the comedy-drama who appears at the psychological moment.
It is for me to prevent the bloated capitalist from ruining the hero and
incidentally the heroine also. Have you seen Morton lately?"</p>
<p>"He is at Park Lane most evenings. I take no interest in the man. I dislike
him."</p>
<p>"A dangerous man, a very dangerous man. But as a character in the play,
decidedly interesting. Is he going down to Fairford to-day for the
week-end?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I met him as I was getting into my car just now. He told me that he
would have the pleasure of staying with me. He dines out to-night with those
Leverton people, going there with the Scarsdales. Afterwards he comes on to
us."</p>
<p>Smith beamed as he carefully polished his eye-glass. "I should very much
like to be of the party," he said. "There are certain interesting developments
that I desire to watch. May I plead for an invitation?"</p>
<p>"It would be doing me a favour," Mrs. Cardella said. "I shall only be too
pleased if you will come down with me. There is ample room in my car."</p>
<p>Smith was disconsolate; it was most unfortunate that he had business which
would detain him in London till nearly 8 o'clock. With a little luck he might
manage possibly with the aid of his own car, to get to Fairford in time for
dinner. If he happened to be a little late they were not to wait for him.</p>
<p>"And now, my dear lady, let us go in to luncheon," he said. "Let us try to
forget all our trials and troubles for an hour or so. I can promise you an
ample reward a little later on. You shall see how truth and honour triumph over
darkness and chicanery. The story is so excellent that I am sanguine of making
a successful play out of it."</p>
<p>"To be continued in our next," Carmen Cardella smiled. "My husband will be
equally glad to see you. He hopes that you may be induced to take part in some
of his ventures. It was he who suggested that you should come down with
me."</p>
<p>Smith smiled drily. Something seemed to amuse him.</p>
<p>"He need not be anxious," he said. "There is one little venture of his in
which I shall most decidedly take a part, and not a small one either. Now let
us two lunch."</p>
<p>It was fortunate, perhaps, for Mr. Smith that dinner at the 'cottage' near
Fairford was late that night. Cardella had been detained on business longer
than he had expected, in consequence of which it was nearly 9 before he sat
down to the evening meal. Mr. Smith had arrived only a few minutes before,
having barely had time to change into evening dress. His car showed signs of
hard wear, he had lost his way, and come along by roads that were none too
good. He appeared to be on excellent terms with himself&mdash;his eye gleamed
with a certain suggestion of amusement. Mrs. Cardella sat unusually silent and
thoughtful, as she always did when her husband introduced business. It was some
time past 10 before she rose wearily from the table, and returned to the
drawing-room.</p>
<p>"I am going to bed," she said. "It is quite late now, and business does not
interest me."</p>
<p>"Only the tangible results of it," Cardella sneered. "You are never blind to
them, Carmen. But Mr. Smith will recognise a good thing when he sees it."</p>
<p>Carmen Cardella swept out of the room without a reply. Cardella pushed the
silver cigar box across the table, and intimated that the port stood at Smith's
elbow.</p>
<p>"We might just as well sit here and talk as anywhere else," he said. "It is
quite the pleasantest room in the house. I hate a poky little place like
this."</p>
<p>"So different from what you have been accustomed to," Smith said drily. The
touch of satire in the words flew harmlessly over Cardella's head. He looked
anxious and moody.</p>
<p>"I should be quite contented with it. Upon my word, you capitalists puzzle
me. You have more money than you can possibly, spend, and yet you worry
yourselves into all sorts of nervous disorders getting more. There was that
little affair you were telling me about just now, for instance."</p>
<p>Cardella brightened up, his manner became animated.</p>
<p>"A little gold mine," he said, "And quite safe. If I had not a high regard
for you I should never have mentioned it. Even Morton knows nothing about it.
Why not come in? A matter of ten thousand will not hurt you if you lose it, and
if you win you treble your capital in a week. If you will let me have your
cheque by Wednesday&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Perhaps the check will come before Wednesday," Smith said absently.
"Really, I beg your pardon. I was thinking of something else. But my dear sir,
your ventures are not always successful. There was that little business at San
Remo, for instance. Only in those days you did not call yourself Cardella. Your
name was a little less striking and picturesque, I fancy. Let me see&mdash;what
was it? I was at San Remo at the time, because it was just then that I had the
good fortune to see your wife on the stage there."</p>
<p>Cardella started slightly. He was not expecting anything like this.</p>
<p>"Isn't there some mistake here?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I fancy not," Smith said in his most amicable manner. "I am not making any
comment on the business in question. I am perhaps a little old-fashioned in my
views of what is called commercial morality. If you have any more flights of
imagination of the same kind, you will be so good as to count me out."</p>
<p>Cardella muttered something under his breath. Matters were not going at all
satisfactorily from his point of view. He was making the same mistake as other
clever men of his class frequently indulge in&mdash;he took every other man he
met for a fool. And he did not like the cool, calm searching eye turned upon
him behind Smith's eyeglass.</p>
<p>"Then I cannot tempt you to join me?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Not at present, Cardella. I waste the greater part of my income, I admit;
but I get a vast amount of enjoyment out of the expenditure. If&mdash;"</p>
<p>Cardella rose hastily from his chair, and put his cigar down. Out side in
the hall the telephone bell was rippling impatiently. It rang again and
again.</p>
<p>"I'll ask you to excuse me for a moment," Cardella said. "I expect all the
servants have gone to bed. They usually do unless we have a lot of people
staying here."</p>
<p>Smith nodded carelessly; the subject was of no interest to him. Cardella
strode into the hall and took down the receiver. He placed it to his ear.</p>
<p>"Hello," he said. "Hello. Yes, this is Fairford Cottage. Mr. Cardella? You
are talking to him at the present moment. Who are you? Oh, Sir Bruce Leverton.
Yes, Sir Bruce. Yes. Yes. Mr. Robert Morton. What? Why, I
understand&mdash;"</p>
<p>Cardella paused. At the same moment there was a sudden click, and the hall
lights faded away leaving the place in darkness. Something cold and round was
pressed to Cardella's left temple, and a hoarse voice came menacingly to his
ear.</p>
<p>"If you move or speak you are a dead man," the voice said. "You are getting
a message from Sir Bruce Leverton. He wants to know whether or not Robert
Morton is dining with him. There has been some kind of mistake. Now say what I
tell you to say, or you will not speak many more words on this side of the
grave. Say that Morton should have arrived in company with Mrs. Scarsdale. Now
then, say it!"</p>
<p>Cardella repeated the message mechanically. With that cold metal ring
pressing on the side of his head he had no alternative. As he hung the receiver
up and the bell rang off the cold pressure relaxed, the dim threatening form
vanished. In a paroxysm of rage, Cardella flew for the switch. Once he had the
light on and his freedom to act he would soon put matters right. The rascal who
had dared this audacious thing really was no more than a reckless fool after
all. The light was on again now, and Cardella snatched for the receiver. The
flex attached to it came off in his hand; the cord had been clean cut, it was
useless. There was no possibility of using the instrument now; it would take
hours before it could possibly be available for conversation again. Cardella
dashed the thing down in a fit of rage and fury; he turned to see that Smith
was regarding him with calm curiosity through his eyeglass.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;"A Front of Brass."</h2>
<p>Events were not standing still at Grant Lea. The bombshell had fallen and
exploded at Hubert Grant's feet, shattering his schemes into fragments. The
startling unexpectedness of it left him utmost petrified for the moment. It was
the very unexpectedness that kept him silent. He looked from Sir Bruce's placid
unsuspicious features into the deadly whiteness of May's face. For her sake
more than his own he would have to see this thing through.</p>
<p>At any rate Sir Bruce did not suspect him. There was comfort in this
reflection. Sir Bruce regarded it either as a mistake, or an impudent attempt
at impersonation on the part of some audacious stranger. Probably it was a
practical joke. It was just as well perhaps to adopt this view of the matter.
Hubert found his voice at last.</p>
<p>"Some friend of mine amusing himself," he said lightly. "A practical joke.
Not altogether good taste in the circumstances, but then some people have no
consideration. I understand that you have seen the individual in question. Sir
Bruce?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I've seen him right enough," Leverton said. "And I'm bound to say that
he looks a gentleman. A well-dressed man, with a rather pronounced drawl.
Affected, some people might call it. Seems to be very much in earnest,
too."</p>
<p>Hubert's courage failed him for the moment. He was half hoping that the
thing might turn out to be a mistake after all. But Sir Bruce's description of
Morton tallied too closely for that. He recognised the tremendous nature of the
task before him.</p>
<p>"And where is my double at the present moment?" he asked. "In the library. I
have just come away from him."</p>
<p>"Really! Well, if you don't mind, perhaps you will let him stay there for a
little longer. A few minutes' reflection may convince him of his folly. Unless,
of course, you feel that he is the genuine article and I the impostor."</p>
<p>"That is absurd," Sir Bruce cried. "This man comes here with a mere
assertion. You came under my roof with my friend, Mrs. Scarsdale."</p>
<p>Hubert's conscience pricked him again. If this thing became an open scandal
he would involve Ellen Scarsdale as well as the others.</p>
<p>"I am sorry that you should have had this unpleasantness, Sir Bruce," he
said. "It is very unfortunate, especially as this is my first visit here. Will
you leave that man to me? Will you permit me to see him alone? I can save you
trouble that way."</p>
<p>Sir Bruce hesitated just for a moment. Easy going as he was, he always
avoided unpleasantness if he could. He smiled at the idea now.</p>
<p>"You have not told anybody else?" Hubert asked. "Positively nobody. The
servants don't know. I thought it just as well not to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Quite so," Hubert said eagerly. "Very wise of you. If you will leave the
matter to me I will get rid of the intruder without further bother. It is just
possible that he is some unfortunate who is wandering in his mind. You can
trust me implicitly."</p>
<p>Sir Bruce expressed his thanks. If he had any suspicions they were troubling
him no longer. May turned with a little broken cry, and clasped her lover's
arm.</p>
<p>"What does it mean?" she whispered. "What terrible new misfortune is
this?"</p>
<p>"Courage, courage, darling," Hubert said. "When things are going badly
against one, these little troubles are certain to come. Beyond question the
real Robert Morton is here. I thought that I had got him safely out of the way.
By a judicious use of the telephone I imagined that I had induced him to take a
journey North. I was not afraid of the man personally; I was merely going to
use him as a channel for getting here to see you. It was a wild and foolish
thing to do, of course, but time was pressing, and I had to see you. And all
this time I have forgotten the box which I have for you in my pocket. It came
but of Spencer's safe."</p>
<p>A glad cry came from May's lips.</p>
<p>"The jewels!" she whispered joyfully. "Lady Mossingford's gems."</p>
<p>"I presume so. I have not opened the packet which you will see is addressed
to Lady Leverton. It was a considerable risk on my part, but I went down to
Ledge Point this afternoon on purpose to see what was in the safe. The idea
came to me from a chance remark dropped by Scarsdale. I managed to get into the
library without being seen. I found your telegram waiting for me, and I
contrived to read the message and fasten the envelope down again so that it
would be impossible to see that it had been tampered with. Your message was so
urgent that I had to come here. I racked my brains for some ingenious way in
which I could manage to see you without risk. Things had gone too far for me to
show myself openly. Then it occurred to me that I might pass myself off for
Morton here. I knew that he was coming here with the Scarsdales. If I could get
him out of the way I could take his place. It was a mad idea, but I could think
of nothing else. By using the telephone I managed to get Morton out of the way.
I knew that Philip Scarsdale would never consent to my scheme, so I waylaid
Mrs. Scarsdale, and almost forced her to bring me here. Of course the whole
thing is bound to be found out sooner or later, but that will make very little
difference. The one thing I did not expect was that Morton would turn up in
this fashion."</p>
<p>May turned a pale anxious face to her lover. "What do you propose to do?"
she asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am going to see Morton. Now that things have gone so far it is
absolutely impossible for me to do anything else. If I disappeared suddenly I
should leave Mrs. Scarsdale in a very serious position, and a very painful one.
By showing myself to Morton I shall have to more or less confess my hiding
place. But I am going to bluff it out."</p>
<p>Hubert rose from his seat with on air of determination. After all his plan
had been so far successful, inasmuch as he had saved Lady Leverton. And no
doubt he would have no great difficulty in finding another hiding place.</p>
<p>But May was by no means so sanguine. The truth would have to be told. Her
mother must help her. Lady Leverton was not playing her favourite game at that
moment. This homely after-dinner Bridge was unattractive. She liked the
excitement and anxiety of the big stakes. She was by no means a bad woman,
merely a foolish one who is led away by ostentation and display. She liked to
speak of her smart friends, to be on the top of the tide. It was an expensive
amusement for her with her recklessness and impulsive temperament.</p>
<p>She never dreamt for a moment that most of those 'friends' of hers were
semi-professional sharpers who looked upon her as absolute plunder. Even now
she would not look her troubles in the face. In her kindly flighty way she
hoped for the best even at this moment when Lady Mossingford was under her roof
and a request for the jewels was only a question of a few hours.</p>
<p>Nevertheless she paled and started a little as May touched her arm. There
was a hard look in the girl's eyes, a certain pallor of feature that caused
Lady Leverton's heart to beat a little faster. She followed her daughter into
the hall.</p>
<p>"What is the trouble?" she asked. "My dear child, have you seen a
ghost?"</p>
<p>"Something like it," May said bitterly, "Mother, I want you to help me. I
want you to put aside all your little pleasures and try and realise that I am
in a serious trouble."</p>
<p>The ready tears rose to Lady Leverton's eyes. She had an easy flow of
sympathy for most people.</p>
<p>"I am quite sure, my dear, that I am ready to do anything," she said. "What
is the matter?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it is not altogether personal. There are other people involved in it as
well as me. Indeed, you are responsible for most of it."</p>
<p>"My dear child! Really, you appear to forget&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Mother, I am forgetting nothing," May cried passionately. "There are
certain things that I should be only too glad to put out of my mind. Lady
Mossingford's diamonds for instance."</p>
<p>Lady Leverton started. Very pale and agitated, she waited for May to
proceed.</p>
<p>"I found it out more or less by accident," the girl went on. "I had my
suspicions after a certain conversation with Mr. Spencer. He asked me to marry
him&mdash;that vile old man asked me to become his wife! And you encouraged
him."</p>
<p>Lady Leverton said nothing. It seemed as if the world were slipping away
from under her feet. It seemed to her as if she had never known her daughter
before. Here was May transformed almost beyond recognition. Her face was hard
and her eyes accusing.</p>
<p>"I am glad you do not deny it," May went on. "I dare say you think that this
is a strange conversation to take place just now, but you will see the absolute
necessity of it presently. I say that you encouraged Mr. Spencer. He had your
approval. Not that you liked him, but because you were in his power. He lent
you money to pay your bridge debts, but not one penny did he advance without
security. And then there came a time when you were in desperate need of cash.
You had nothing to fall back on but the jewels that Lady Mossingford left here
before she was called away to Paris. In your sanguine way you took them and
pledged them to Paul Spencer. You did not mean to do anything wrong, of course.
You were quite sure that luck would turn, and that you would redeem the stones.
But your luck did not turn. It would have been strange otherwise with some of
the women you play with. Why I heard one of the finest bridge players in London
say openly that he would not sit down with some of your friends. But I need not
go into that. You lost your money, Mr. Spencer is dead, and Lady Mossingford is
here. What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>Lady Leverton wept softly. She was the most unfortunate unhappy creature in
the world.</p>
<p>"Oh, no you are not," May said drily. "I am going to help you, and in return
you are going to help me. The stones are in my pocket at the present moment. At
my instigation they were stolen from Mr. Spencer's safe at Ledge Point. I
should have stolen them myself, but for a mischance. But I got a friend to act
for me, and he came here a little time ago and put the diamonds into my hands.
He is under our roof at the present moment."</p>
<p>"Really!" Lady Leverton stammered. She was trying to collect her scattered
senses. "I hope you thanked him properly. What a risk he must have taken."</p>
<p>"That is a mild way of putting it," May said. "Mind you, my friend knows
everything. He knows who the jewels belonged to, and how they found their way
into Paul Spencer's safe. I had to tell him, because he had every right to
know. I am speaking of Hubert Grant."</p>
<p>Lady Leverton found her wits at last. Understanding was coming to her.</p>
<p>"But my dear child!" she exclaimed. "Hubert Grant! The son of the man who
almost ruined your father. Paul Spencer's partner! A man who is a fugitive from
justice. Everybody says that he is an utterly unprincipled rascal."</p>
<p>"What everybody says is wrong," May retorted coldly. "But you heard what was
said at dinner. There was only one opinion. I did not even know that you were
acquainted with Hubert Grant."</p>
<p>"I did not tell you for many reasons. I thought you would disapprove, and in
any case I knew that my father would. At first I was prejudiced against Hubert.
But I heard so many things to his credit. And gradually my opinion changed. It
seemed harsh and unreasonable to judge him by his father. And that is how I
became engaged to him."</p>
<p>Lady Leverton lifted her head helplessly. All this was terrible.</p>
<p>"Your father will not hear of it," she said. "And yet this man has saved
my&mdash;has done me a great service. Really, I must thank him. Did I
understand you to say that he was in the house? But that must be a mistake on
my part. This has been such a startling business that I do not properly grasp
it even yet. If he were in the house&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He is in the house," May said in a fierce whisper. "He has been here all
the evening&mdash;he dined with us. Only he did not call himself Hubert Grant.
The gentleman passing here as Mr. Morton is Mr. Hubert Grant. And now do you
understand?"</p>
<p>"It might be worse," Lady Leverton said, with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"But why&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It is worse," May went on. "The real Morton has turned up, and demands to
be confronted with the man who has answered his name. They are at present
together in the library. You can see the danger of the situation. I want you to
help me. I fancy I can see a way to save the situation yet. But I cannot do so
without your assistance."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;Bluff.</h2>
<p>Hubert was feeling calm and cool enough as he walked in the direction of the
library. Fate was doing its worst so far as he was concerned, and there was
even a certain grim curiosity as to what was going to happen next. At any rate
he had fulfilled his mission so far as May was concerned. He was going to be
exposed, it would be very unpleasant for Ellen Scarsdale, but Sir Bruce
Leverton was a just man, and he would know how to lay the blame on the proper
shoulders, Morton was pacing up and down the library in a fussy frame of mind.
His dignity had been outraged; he did not feel that he was being properly
treated by these people. For the most part he was a scheming, cunning little
rascal, he knew now to take slights where business was concerned, but apart
from that he had an exceedingly good opinion of himself and his social
position. And here he was being treated like an impostor, and so to speak, put
by for identification. He had not the slightest idea as to the real facts of
the case. He had been tricked by a telephone message, and but for a trivial
accident by this time he would have been far on his way to the North. As the
door of the library opened he turned round angrily.</p>
<p>"Really, Sir Bruce." he said. "Considering that I have come all this
distance for&mdash;"</p>
<p>His jaw dropped; there was some thing like terror in his eyes as they
encountered Grant. He stepped back as if expecting something in the shape of
physical violence.</p>
<p>"Hubert Grant," he stammered. "Now perhaps you will be able to explain the
extraordinary&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," Grant said. "What did you say that your name was?"</p>
<p>"Oh, drop all that nonsense. You know perfectly well what my name is. You
have not lived all these years in the city without knowing something of Robert
Morton. Besides&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But, my dear sir, there is some mistake here. I am Robert Morton. Between
ourselves, I am that precious scamp. To a certain extent I was a failure in the
city till I came in contact with Julius Cardella. I have been exceedingly
useful to him, and before long I am going to get my reward. It mainly consists
in a share of the Quogga concession. Now that the firm of Spencer and Grant are
down we come in, you know. Between ourselves, we practically wrecked Spencer
and Grant. We took advantage of our knowledge, we found out what Spencer was
doing, and we had a tool of ours ready to apply for a warrant against two of
the firm when the time had come. As a matter of fact, we are two of the
greatest scamps in the city, which is saying a great deal. But we have not won
yet, we shall not feel quite safe until Hubert Grant is laid by the heels. And
we are going to find that a difficult matter."</p>
<p>Morton listened open-mouthed to this strange medley. He was getting over his
sense of fear now. It was hardly possible that Grant would assault him in
another man's house. It was quite clear now that for some reason Grant was
impersonating him.</p>
<p>"But this is all nonsense," he protested.</p>
<p>"I think not. I was the first Richmond in the field. Nobody knows either of
us here, and Mrs. Scarsdale will vouch for my identity."</p>
<p>"But Mrs. Scarsdale knows perfectly well that you are not me," Morton cried.
"I will go and see her at once, and she shall come and confess&mdash;"</p>
<p>Grant laid a grip of steel on the speaker's arm.</p>
<p>"Don't move," he said quietly. "If you try to leave the room or ring the
bell, I'll kill you. You are puzzled to know what I am doing here, and why I am
passing in your name. Sooner or later you will learn that to your discomfiture.
It is a great consolation to me to be able to use you to such advantage. At the
present moment I am fighting for my freedom. Every hour is of the utmost
importance to me. If I can keep clear of a gaol for the next week I shall win.
I shall be able to take up that Quogga concession, and everybody will be paid.
Inevitably I shall make a fortune. And I shall show the world what part
Cardella and yourself have taken in the business. So far as Grant Lea is
concerned, you are wasting your time here. Sir Bruce Leverton regards you as an
impostor; he has left me to deal with you as I think fit. If I advise him to
have you kicked out of the house he will have you kicked out of the house. You
will have your remedy afterwards, of course, but for the time being I am quite
master of the situation."</p>
<p>"Oh, are you," Morton sneered, "When I insist upon seeing Mrs.
Scarsdale&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My good fellow, it will not be the slightest use for you to insist upon
seeing Mrs. Scarsdale. As you are regarded here as an impudent impostor, any
suggestion of that kind would be resented as so much insolence. From your point
of view the best thing to be done is to go as far as Fairford and tell the
police that I am here. I shall certainly not be here when they arrive, but you
will have the consolation of knowing that I have been driven out of the house.
On the other hand, Sir Bruce Leverton has given me a free hand to do as I
please with you. He would not be in the least annoyed if I kicked you out of
the place. How I itch to do it!"</p>
<p>Hubert came forward with his hands clenched. The wild light of a righteous
indignation blazed in his eyes.</p>
<p>"If I consulted my own inclination," he said, "I should thrash you within an
inch of your life. Certainly I shall never have a better opportunity. My
fingers are itching to be at you."</p>
<p>Morton shrank back. Physical pluck was not one of his virtues.</p>
<p>"Don't you dare to touch me!" he said, hoarsely. "I&mdash;I am armed."</p>
<p>Grant burst into a sardonic laugh.</p>
<p>"You miserable little liar!" he exclaimed. "I don't believe that you ever
handled a weapon in your life. You would not dare to carry a revolver in your
pocket. The longer you stay here the less able shall I be to control my
feelings. Why do you remain? Why don't you go? What is the use of staying on
here where you are cutting so sorry a figure? You can return again to-morrow
with witnesses and restore your precious reputation in the eyes of Sir Bruce.
Every dog has his day, and this happens to be mine. Now, will you go or shall I
put you out?"</p>
<p>"It was all very hard," Morton muttered. "Could he see Sir Bruce just for a
moment? In fact, he was not going to leave the house till he had done so."</p>
<p>There was a certain determination about him now.</p>
<p>Grant shrugged his shoulders carelessly. After all, he was absolute master
of the situation. Morton had already said as much as he could. And Sir Bruce
might decline to see him.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said. "Stay here and I will fetch my host. But you are doing
yourself no good by the folly. And you are giving me time."</p>
<p>"That is going to come," Morton said with an ugly grin on his face.</p>
<p>Hubert passed out of the room without retort. He could afford to smile at
that sort of thing. Sir Bruce had evidently forgotten all about his strange
visitor, for he had been inveigled to one of the card tables, where he was
engaged in a rubber. As Grant stood at the drawing-room door, uncertain, as to
what to do next, Lady Leverton came up and touched him on the arm. There were
traces of tears in her eyes; her face was pale and agitated. What new trouble
was here, Hubert wondered.</p>
<p>"Come as far as the hall with me," Lady Leverton whispered. "I have
something important to say to you. May has been telling me everything. Oh! What
a lot I owe you, Mr. Grant."</p>
<p>Hubert started. It was a veritable evening of surprises, and this was not
the least of them. He was wondering why it was that May had suddenly confided
in her mother? Perhaps she had feared for an exposure of the whole thing,
perhaps she was anxious to have an ally on her side.</p>
<p>"Indeed!" he said, guardedly. "Then it is useless for me to pretend to be
anybody but myself to you. There are many reasons why I had to do this thing,
but there is no time to explain now. But as I have been the means of doing you
some little service&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Little service! You have saved my good name. You have saved me from the
consequences of one of the most wicked things a woman ever did. I have had a
lesson I am not likely to forget. After to-night I am never going to gamble
again. But I did not bring you here with the selfish idea of talking of myself.
I want to help you if I can. If necessary I will tell my husband the whole
truth. I want him to realise what you have done for us. When he finds
out&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Is there any necessity?" Grant asked softly. "Sir Bruce must find out who I
am sooner or later, but there is no necessity for his doing so to-night.
Nothing will be gained by it. And, besides, think of what a cruel position Mrs.
Scarsdale would stand in! But for her generosity and kindness I should not have
been here at all. It would be a poor return&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But that man!" Lady Leverton protested. "The man in the library, the real
Morton&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sir Bruce refuses to recognise him as such," Hubert argued. "It has been
left with me to deal with the fellow just as I like. He asked to see Sir Bruce
just for a moment, and I came to find him. I see that he is playing cards, and
it is impossible to disturb him. The least thing I can do is to go back to the
library and give him his dismissal. I can say that Sir Bruce flatly refuses to
see him. After he has gone I dare not linger many moments."</p>
<p>"But you will give me ten minutes," Lady Leverton said eagerly. "You are not
in all that danger for the present. Do come back and let me thank you."</p>
<p>Grant gave the desired assurance before he returned to the library.</p>
<p>Morton appeared to have become more resigned, for he was seated with his
back to the door reading a. book. So engrossed was he that he did not look up
as Grant entered.</p>
<p>"It is quite useless." the latter said; "Sir Bruce is playing cards and
refuses to be interfered with. He has left everything to me. And I am to
say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Quite right!" a mincing, affected voice said. "He could have done no
better."</p>
<p>Grant started as the speaker rose. Morton had vanished, and in his place
was&mdash;</p>
<p>"Mr. Smith!" Grant stammered. "Mr. Smith, may I ask what this means? And
what has become of Mr. Robert Morton who was here a few minutes ago?"</p>
<p>"That," said Smith, "is a matter that requires a little explanation."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.&mdash;Delilah!</h2>
<p>Julius Cardella crept from the telephone into the dining-room, with his
knees knocking together, and a dry patch at the back of his threat. The man was
hard enough when no physical danger was at hand. He could face an angry meeting
of defrauded shareholders without a flutter&mdash;the thought of it would not
have affected His appetite. But in a moment of actual peril like this be became
as a frightened child. He dropped into a chair, and grasped a glass of brandy.
Mr. John Smith appeared to be lost in dreaming meditations.</p>
<p>"A diabolical outrage," Cardella gurgled. "Most audacious thing I ever heard
of."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," Smith said absently. "I was thinking. A splendid idea
for a situation flashed into my mind directly you had gone. It is more or less
connected with the telephone. For the purpose of stage effort the telephone is
not exploited half enough. You have a beautifully arranged room like
this&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes; I'll listen to all that presently," Cardella said testily. His
courage was coming back to him now under the stimulus of the brandy.</p>
<p>"My dear sir, there are more important things in the world than the
situations in stage plays."</p>
<p>"Not to me," Smith said. "I want nothing else to do. I long to play the hero
in a living drama, where I can control all the characters and make them do as I
please&mdash;especially when all the time they think they are doing exactly as
they please. If I can't get it acted, at any rate I can get some of my dramas
performed."</p>
<p>"Well, here is a situation for you at any rate," Cardella said savagely. "I
am sitting here talking business to you in the most natural way. Everybody has
gone to bed, and so far as I knew to the contrary the house is locked up
securely. The telephone bell rings, which is nothing very alarming. I find that
a neighbour of mine, Sir Bruce Leverton, needs to speak to me. He has a few
questions to ask as to my friend Morton. I am about to reply when the light
goes out and a revolver is pressed to my forehead by some unseen antagonist. I
am invited to reply as this ruffian desires or have my brains blown out. In the
circumstances, hesitation is foolish. I do as I am told."</p>
<p>"With the knowledge that you can repair the mistake after your visitor has
gone?" Smith chuckled.</p>
<p>"Well, I had not overlooked that," Cardella went on. "But as soon as the
interview was finished I discovered that the receiver had been cut away from
the instrument with the rapidity of lightning. I was powerless to do anything
further."</p>
<p>An enthusiastic smile lighted up Smith's face.</p>
<p>"Excellent," he cried. "Most excellent! Really a fine situation. I should
have been proud to have been the author of it myself. Where did you get it
from?"</p>
<p>"Get it from," Cardella snarled. "Do you suppose I waste my time&mdash;why,
what I am telling you has just happened to me. Took place in the hall now."</p>
<p>"What, here? Under your own roof?" Smith cried. "Is it possible? Whilst I am
dreaming of possibilities the real thing is actually taking place. Upon my
word, I should like to meet that man. How did he get here? Which way did he
escape?"</p>
<p>Cardella intimated that that was exactly the problem that puzzled him. He
had no intention of sitting down again until his mind was easy on that score.
It was impossible to communicate with the police so long as the telephone was
out of order.</p>
<p>"The best thing we can do is to go and see," Smith said. "But look here,
Cardella&mdash;there is more here than meets the eye. Your mysterious visitor
must have known that Sir Bruce Leverton was probably calling you over the
telephone. He must have had some very urgent reasons for compelling you to make
up a story. In other words he has some knowledge of your private affairs."</p>
<p>Cardella started. The point had escaped him for a moment. He looked anxious
and restless.</p>
<p>"You are probably right." he said. "But one thing at a time. I can't
possibly be easy in my mind till I am satisfied that that fellow is no longer
in the house."</p>
<p>But no signs of the audacious visitor were to be seen. One of the long
French windows in the morning-room was unfastened, and slightly open. Beyond
all doubt that man had come and gone that way. He might have been lurking about
the morning-room for hours, seeing that nobody had been there since the
darkness had fallen. Satisfied in his mind now that the intruder had vanished,
Cardella turned back towards the dining-room. Smith dodged in front of him.</p>
<p>"Just one more cigarette," he suggested. "And one more glass of brandy and
soda. Allow me to make yours. Ah, you are not wise to take quite so much
brandy, my friend."</p>
<p>Cardella Smiled as he lifted the glass which Smith had prepared for him to
his lips. He lighted a cigarette and lay back in his chair. Presently the
half-smoked cigarette dropped from his fingers on to the carpet, and burned
there with a thin spiral stream of smoke. Smith sat there looking on curiously
through his eyeglass. He seemed not unlike some amiable elderly Cupid. As he
stooped cautiously to pick up the smouldering cigarette, a snore broke from
Cardella. On the instant Smith's expression charged altogether.</p>
<p>"That is all light, my friend," he muttered. "That little pinch of gray
powder in your glass will give the 60 minutes I need. Positively the drama is
breathing with situations. They came crowding almost too fast one on the heels
of the other. And to think that I stand here the master of all these puppets!
This is far better than watching my own play from the stalls."</p>
<p>The mincing accent was no longer there, the whole expression of the man's
face changed. He passed out into the hall and whistled softly. A moment later
and Mrs. Cardella came out of the dining-room. She was clad in some dead black
wrap, her long dusky hair was over her shoulders, the beautiful face was white
and set. Only the slumbering fire in the eyes of the wild tornado of passion
seething underneath.</p>
<p>"You have managed it?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"My Lady Macbeth, yes," Smith replied. "Pardon me, but you remind me of Lady
Macbeth at the present moment strongly. Reynold's portrait, you know."</p>
<p>"There is a resemblance in more ways than one," Mrs. Cardella said bitterly.
"Lady Macbeth despised her husband from the bottom of her heart. I hate and
loathe and despise mine. I want him to know that I have discovered everything.
I want to tell him when the time comes that I have lived for revenge on the man
who killed my lover. I want to see him pulled into the dust, disgraced,
dishonoured, a pauper fleeing from justice. And you promised to give me all
that&mdash;"</p>
<p>The words came in a thrilling whisper. They seemed to burst from the woman's
full heart like a mountain flood overflowing its banks. Smith regarded her
admiringly.</p>
<p>"What a situation," he murmured. "And what an exponent of the character. I
am obliged to you for your assistance, my dear madam, but I must confess that
my conscience does not altogether approve of the methods I am compelled to
adopt. To induce a woman to betray her husband&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I have no husband," Mrs. Cardella said coldly. "Cardella is the man I live
with. Oh, I married him, of course, but that is nothing. I did not know then
how I had been deceived. My heart was dead within me, and I did not care what
became of me. If there is any betrayal it is all on his side. And I am going to
help you, because by so doing we insure the happiness of a dear little girl who
is so foolish as to admire me. All the same I am not doing it entirely for her
sake. You are sure that May Leverton will benefit?"</p>
<p>"I can lay my hand on my heart and swear to that," Smith said. "May
Leverton's whole happiness is at stake. At the present moment the man she loves
is keeping out of the way for fear of arrest on a charge of fraud. Hubert Grant
is innocent enough. But your husband and that rascal Morton have so engineered
it that Grant's guilt appears to be overwhelming. If he is arrested, he is
certain to be committed, and therefore something valuable in the way of
business will pass from Grant to Cardella. If Cardella loses this he cannot
carry on much longer."</p>
<p>"You mean that he is on the verge of ruin! It seems impossible!" Mrs.
Cardella glanced round the room. Smith could see what was passing in her
mind.</p>
<p>"So you would imagine," he said "This house does not suggest ruin. Neither
does the magnificent mansion of yours in Park Lane. When a man is believed to
be a millionaire, nobody ever wants money from him. Cardella's position is what
I tell you."</p>
<p>"Yes. Yes. And what do you want me to do?"</p>
<p>"I want you to get me Cardella's keys. He has further mischief afoot
to-night, though he does not look it as he sleeps so peacefully there. But he
expects Morton here before midnight and there is something like an adventure
before them. I gave him a passing drug, because an hour or so is sufficient for
my purpose, and because I want him to wake presently and fancy that he has had
no more than a nap. When he comes to himself he will imagine that I have gone
to bed. When Morton comes it will be quite another matter. The keys?"</p>
<p>"They are round his neck," Mrs. Cardella explained. "Attached to a gold
cord. The key you need is the little one with the gold disc on the top. And the
safe is in his dressing-room. Is there anything else that I can do for
you?"</p>
<p>Smith professed himself to be perfectly satisfied so far. He dexterously
loosened the stud in the shirt of the sleeper and fumbled inside for the keys.
They came up presently, three of them on a ring from which it was an easy
matter to detach them.</p>
<p>"If you will remain here till I come back I shall be obliged," Smith said.
"There is little chance of Cardella waking for some half-hour more, but one can
never quite tell."</p>
<p>He slipped away and came presently to Cardella's dressing-room. Here a small
steel-fronted safe had been let into the wall. The tiny key turned in the
well-oiled lock without a sound. For some time Smith was busy with the mass of
papers inside. He chuckled presently as he came to the thing he needed, and
thrust it into his breast pocket.</p>
<p>"Now in the metaphor of youth, we shan't be long," he said. "That is what
the low comedian would say, and it is emphatically the part of the low comedian
that I am acting at the present moment. Another two days and the long suspense
is over."</p>
<p>Cardella was still sleeping peacefully as Smith returned to the dining-room.
The key was replaced about his neck, and the stud fastened again. Mrs. Cardella
looked eagerly at her companion. He tapped his breast pocket significantly
after the best traditions of the stage.</p>
<p>"I have the papers," he said gleefully. "I have discovered everything that I
need. All that you have to do now is to go to bed and leave the rest to me.
Perhaps you will be so good as to lock my bedroom door, and hide the key under
the mat outside. I want it to be assumed that I have gone to sleep. Morton must
be more or less assured of that when he gets here."</p>
<p>"You are going out again?" Mrs. Cardella asked in some surprise.</p>
<p>"It is absolutely necessary that I should do so," Smith explained. "I may be
a couple of hours; on the other hand I may not be back before daybreak. But my
absence must not be noticed. Let me wish you good-night."</p>
<p>Smith took Mrs. Cardella's cold limp hand in his, and gallantly carried it
to his lips. He was still acting up to the best instincts of the stage. Withal
he was intensely pleased with himself. Everything was going splendidly; he was
playing the part of the god in the car entirely to his own satisfaction. When
he stepped out into the night a little later his appearance was changed beyond
all recognition. There was a large lump between his shoulders; he wore a gray
slack wig and a lot of straggling beard and whiskers. There was a suggestion of
dissipation about him, a flavour of spirits. He might have been some one-time
prosperous solicitor or professional man who had come down through drink. In
the road a small dark car was waiting him.</p>
<p>The driver saluted as be came up.</p>
<p>"I came as soon as possible, Watkins," Smith said. "What do you think of
this?"</p>
<p>"Shouldn't have known you from Adam, sir," the chauffeur said. "Perfect
disguise, sir. You didn't say which way you wanted to go."</p>
<p>"Grant Lea. Stop at the lane behind the avenue. I'll get out there and walk
to the house. After that I'll get you to drive me to Ledge Point. Possibly we
shall find ourselves in London by daylight. But that depends upon
circumstances."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;The Ghost.</h2>
<p>Hot, and sore, and angry, Morton paced up and down the library, awaiting
Grant's return. He had never expected a humiliation of this kind. He was at a
loss, too, to understand what it all meant. He would have given a great deal to
know why Grant was impersonating him in this audacious manner. He wondered if
Scarsdale had anything to do with it. Certainly Mrs. Scarsdale must be a party
in the fraud. But why had she been dragged into the matter, and what did
anybody expect to gain by it? If Sir Bruce Leverton deliberately chose to be a
blind fool, then he must take the consequences of his folly. If the worst came
to the worst, Morton decided to make his way by road as far as Scarsdale's
place and tell him everything. This course would be the means of giving Mrs.
Scarsdale an uncomfortable hour or so on her return home. There was some
extraordinary conspiracy afoot here that Morton did not like at all. Still he
had all the cards in his hands, and&mdash;He came to himself with a shock, and
the knowledge that somebody was tapping on the window. As he pushed the
casement back he saw a shaggy gray beard and a mass of hair about a face that
was none too clean. An odour of stale tobacco and spirits filled the air.</p>
<p>"Who are you and what do you want with me?" Morton demanded.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter in the least who I am," the shabby stranger said. "I want
to do you a good turn if I can, though your manner is not inviting. If you take
my advice you will stop hanging about here and get over to Cardella at once.
Sir Bruce won't see you."</p>
<p>Morton started. All this was both unexpected and unpleasant.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he asked. "What is your name? And what do you know of
Cardella."</p>
<p>"Oh, he's not the only scamp of my acquaintance," the stranger laughed
harshly. "Now, don't you hang about here asking useless questions. There's
danger in the air so far as Cardella and yourself are concerned. Things have
been happening to-day."</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say that Clarkson has been talking?" Morton blurted
out.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying anything about Clarkson or anybody else. Of course if you
like to waste your time hanging about here trying to get a plaster for your
wounded dignity, it's no affair of mine. Stay by all means, and leave Cardella
to go to Ledge Point alone. He'll have to go over there at once if he means to
save the situation."</p>
<p>Morton was really impressed. Whoever the gray stranger was he knew a good
deal. Beyond all doubt, too, he spoke words of wisdom.</p>
<p>"You're right," he said. "I'll go at once. I'll get there in an hour at the
outside." Morton closed the window behind him, and vanished into the night.</p>
<p>When Smith slipped into the library a few minutes later his disguise had
vanished. He was once more the fat chubby ridiculous Cupid in the eyeglass that
Grant had met at Ledge Point. He sat himself down very calmly in a chair
waiting for Grant to return. He had listened at the window long enough to know
that Grant would come back presently, and that he would come by himself. The
problem was working out exactly as Smith had anticipated.</p>
<p>Grant came at length, and Smith worked his little surprise. Once that was
done he reverted to business again. He laid an impressive hand on Grant's
breast.</p>
<p>"I am responsible for getting rid of Morton," he said. "In fact I came over
here entirely to take that fellow off your hands. He will not trouble you again
this evening. You will be able to tell Sir Bruce that you made short work of
the impostor."</p>
<p>"Where has be gone!" Hubert asked. "If he has gone as far as Philip
Scarsdale's&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, you can make your mind quite easy on that score," Smith smiled. "Morton
has not gone off to make mischief between Scarsdale and his wife. He has
returned to Cardella's, where I am supposed to be in bed and asleep at the
present moment. I am Cardella's guest, but not his friend. He asked me down to
try and get some money out of me. Instead of that, I am making use of him. What
use I have made you will know all in good time."</p>
<p>"You are a most extraordinary man, Mr. Smith," Hubert murmured.</p>
<p>"Well, I am," Smith said modestly. "I am the god in the car at any rate. I
am a born dramatist suffering at the hands of a ring of managers. Though I have
stooped to bribe them with lavish entertainments, they will have none of my
works. Perhaps I am a little too realistic. So I am forced to play such dramas
with the world for my stage. I like to take up a set of puppets and play them
for all they are worth. The drama I have in hand now is the love affair of two
young people who are persecuted by two ruffians. The hero is in danger of
arrest. If he is arrested, he is ruined. If he can keep clear of gaol for a day
or two, the ruffians are defeated. It is part of try business to defeat the
ruffians."</p>
<p>"Meaning Cardella and Morton, I suppose?" Grant asked.</p>
<p>"Precisely. That was the great problem before me. I had to work out the play
on logical lines and beat rascality at the same time. So far I have been fairly
successful. We have got through two acts and now the excitement begins in
earnest. Will you come and help me?"</p>
<p>"That all depends as to where you want me to go?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't want you to stay here at any rate. I suppose that everybody
will be going in a short time now. Morton is out of the way, but he may take it
in his head to tell a passing policeman that Hubert Grant is at Grant Lea. As
to me, I am going to Ledge Point&mdash;to look for the ghost. Come along with
me in my car. Whether we are successful or not, I can promise you a good deal
of exciting sport before morning."</p>
<p>Hubert hesitated. He was in no mood for sleep, he could not rest. And the
funny little man with the eyeglass was evidently his friend.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said. "I will trust you. Our first introduction was not a
very promising one, but I feel that you are kindly disposed towards me."</p>
<p>"My dear sir," Smith protested. "You are the hero of the drama. As the
author of the whole thing, I must be fond of my hero. It is my positive duty to
see that you and the heroine wind up everything happily. Now come along."</p>
<p>"I'll come with pleasure," Grant said heartily. "I suppose it is useless to
ask who you really are?"</p>
<p>"I am Mr. John Smith&mdash;of London," the other said drily. "I told you
this quite candidly the first time we met. Now go and say goodbye to Miss
Leverton, and explain to Sir Bruce that you have got rid of Morton. You can
make what excuse to Mrs. Scarsdale you like."</p>
<p>It was no difficult matter to get away. Sir Bruce was still absorbed in his
whist, and had nothing to say. Lady Leverton was not to be seen. May was in the
conservatory, white and troubled.</p>
<p>"I have been so anxious about you, dearest," she whispered.</p>
<p>"I could not get back before," Hubert explained. "At any rate I managed to
get rid of that fellow. I fairly bluffed him. I am quite sure that Sir Bruce is
satisfied. Anyway Morton has gone, and you will see that it is not safe for me
to remain here any longer."</p>
<p>"But what are you going to do? Where will you stay
until&mdash;until&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Until the danger is past? If I can manage for a couple of days I shall be
all right, I fancy now that the sky is not quite so black as it was. I have
found an unexpected friend in the shape of a queer eccentric little man who
calls him self John Smith, of London. He has a passion for acting. From what he
says I gather that he knows you."</p>
<p>Something like a smile flickered across May's pale and anxious face.</p>
<p>"I know him," she said. "But he did not call himself 'John Smith' when I met
him&mdash;I forgot his name. He has a silly manner, and a silly eyeglass, but
he really is a clever little man, and I am sure he is really brilliant. I
forget where I met him, but he took me in to dinner. But how does he come to be
mixed up in this business?"</p>
<p>Hubert shook his head. The question was beyond him. It came to him now that
he was wasting time. It was quite secluded in the conservatory, and the
temptation of May's lips was handy.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Grant and his eccentric companion were speeding down the
country lanes in the direction of Ledge Point. They did not drive up to the
house, but dismounted in a lane close by. They crept across the lawn to the
side of the house which was all in darkness.</p>
<p>"We will sit down by the side of these shrubs, and await events," Smith
said. "It is just possible that we may have our journey for our own pains, but
I don't think so. We may not see the ghost to-night, but that is only a
question of patience. You had better not smoke."</p>
<p>Grant clipped his cigarette case back in his pocket again.</p>
<p>They lay under a belt of shrubs on a heap of rugs from the motor, so that it
was quite warm and snug. For a long time there was no word spoken, no sound
broke the silence till a twig on the gravel snapped like a pistol shot. As
Grant glanced up eagerly he saw two forms standing out dimly against the gray
of the house. They stood there some little time talking in whisper, then there
was a scrape of a match and a tiny point of blue flame flashed out.</p>
<p>"Who do you make this out to be?" Smith asked.</p>
<p>Grant made no reply for a moment.</p>
<p>One of the intruders moved before the light, so that the features stood out
clear and bold for the fraction of a second.</p>
<p>"Cardella," Grant whispered. "Cardella for certain. And the other man is
Morton. What do they want&mdash;?"</p>
<p>"They are looking for the ghost, too," Smith chuckled.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;The Eve of Reckoning.</h2>
<p>There was no help for it so far as Morton was concerned. The whole evening
had been a series of humiliations for him. There was the consolation of knowing
that sooner or later he would be able to re pay Hubert Grant, but that was a
poor solace for his wounded vanity. And now here was another complication that
worried him exceedingly. Who was the man with the ragged gray beard? How did he
come into the picture? And why did Cardella chose such a messenger?</p>
<p>Morton dismissed a suspicion of blackmail. The seedy man could not have been
after money, or he would have shown his hand. He had merely delivered his
strange message and departed. The more Morton thought the matter over, the more
uneasy he became. Perhaps he had better get away at once and see Cardella.
Nothing could be gained by staying where he was. And Cardella might be in real
need of his assistance. But how to get as far as Fairford without assistance
was quite another matter. Perhaps it was possible to obtain some sort of
conveyance in the village. If not it would be necessary to walk the whole
distance along an unknown road, and at that time of night the task could not
possibly be accomplished under the hour.</p>
<p>Down the road a brilliant light was shining, and Morton made his way towards
it. He found a car there with the driver sitting on the step and humming to
himself as he smoked a cigarette. A sudden inspiration came to Morton. The man
had the air of one who anticipated some considerable wait. Perhaps he would
like to earn a trifle.</p>
<p>"Anything the matter, my man?" he asked.</p>
<p>"No, sir," the chauffeur replied. "I'm waiting for the governor. Likely to
be long? Well, probably he may be another half hour or so. Looks like rain now,
doesn't it?"</p>
<p>It did. The moon was partly obscured by a rack of scurrying clouds, the wind
was rising, and there was a decided drop in the atmosphere. Morton glanced down
at his patent leather boots. Here was one extra reason for getting to Fairford
without delay.</p>
<p>"Would you like to earn half a sovereign?" he asked.</p>
<p>The chauffeur responded suitably enough. He was by no means averse, provided
that there was nothing wrong about it. What could he do for the gentleman?</p>
<p>"Take me as far as Fairford," Morton suggested. "You'll get there and back
in twenty minutes easy."</p>
<p>"Take you as far as Fairford Park," the chauffeur amended. "I dare not quite
risk the whole way. If you walk through the Park you'll get to Fairford as soon
as if I drove you round the long way of the road. If you're on, jump in."</p>
<p>Morton hesitated no longer. Ten minutes later he was the poorer by ten
shillings, but he was within a few minutes' walk of Cardella's cottage. He
would have been a little less complacent in his mind, perhaps, had he known
that the mysterious stranger with the ragged beard was the owner of the car.
But that was mercifully kept from him. He could not possibly mistake the way,
the chauffeur had told him. If he followed the left avenue through the park he
would come to the residential end of Fairford in a few minutes. By way of a
feeler, Morton mentioned the name of Cardella's cottage.</p>
<p>"I know it," the chauffeur said. "Why, the garden actually opens on to the
park! You'll see the name in gold letters on the gate. Good night, sir, and
thank you."</p>
<p>A fine rain was beginning to fall now; the wind was rustling in the tree
tops. Morton hurried along to escape the worst of the coming storm. He found
the gate at length, and turned into the garden. A figure stood in the pathway
before him&mdash;the tall slender figure of a woman who seemed to be hesitating
as to what to do next. Morton watched her furtively. It was in the nature of
the man to do so. Useful knowledge was frequently gained in that way. Then
gradually it dawned upon him that the figure in black was none other than Mrs.
Cardella. It was only for a moment or two that she hesitated before making her
way back to the house. She crept along till she came to the long drawing-room
windows, and pulling one of those back slipped into the house as noiselessly as
a ghost. After Morton had pressed the bell once or twice, more of less
impatiently, the door was opened by Mrs. Cardella herself. She was in her
evening dress of some shimmering black with diamonds like stars in her hair.
She looked tranquilly scornful as usual, her glance passing over Morton's
head.</p>
<p>"I was reading in my room, and I heard the bell ring," she said. "My husband
seems to have gone to sleep in the dining-room. Will you come inside?"</p>
<p>Morton began to wonder if he had not made some mistake. There was not the
slightest suggestion of hurry or confusion about Mrs. Cardella. And yet there
was no forgetting the beautiful slenderness of that perfect figure. And if he
was wrong, who, then, was the woman who had made such a furtive entrance to the
house? But Morton asked no questions. He had a great admiration for Mrs.
Cardella's talent, and beauty, but he hated and disliked her. She always
treated him with such cold indifference. He had a feeling in her presence as if
he were a dishonest footman who had been found out, and was sure that she
regarded him as a knave and a charlatan. In his underhand way he would have
gone far to do her some injury.</p>
<p>"In the dining-room," she said. "He is just waking up. You know the
way."</p>
<p>Without a further word she turned her back on him. Morton set his teeth
together. Some of these days the woman should pay for all this. Meanwhile he
had other matters to think of. He found Cardella rubbing his eyes sleepily and
fumbling with a cigarette.</p>
<p>"What time is it?" the latter asked. "And what's become of Smith? Funny
thing that I should drop off in this fashion. How did you get on?"</p>
<p>"We'll come to that presently," Morton said impatiently. "One thing at a
time. I got here as soon as I could. Where did you get your messenger
from?"</p>
<p>"What messenger? I never sent any message for you."</p>
<p>"Bosh. The fellow came to Grant Lea. He looked in at the library window. He
said that you needed me at once, and I came. A wild looking chap, with a lot of
straggling hair on his face."</p>
<p>"I haven't the remotest idea what you are talking about," Cardella
exclaimed. "I sent no message for you and I certainly don't know anybody who
answers to that description. What do you make of it?"</p>
<p>Morton helped himself uneasily to a whisky and soda.</p>
<p>"Then there's something wrong here altogether," he said. "We've got enemies,
Cardella, as you know, and they seem to be on the side of young Grant. And he
has some precious schemes of his own. I'll tell you what a game he played on me
this evening."</p>
<p>Cardella was distinctly amused at Morton's story. He could imagine the
latter's feelings. But the situation had its serious side as he did not fail to
see.</p>
<p>"Somebody is evidently playing a deep scheme on us," he said. "Grant appears
to have found friends in unexpected quarters, Morton. The sooner we act the
better. We have made a little too sure of our position. We thought that once
Spencer was out of the way we could get the Quogga concession as a matter of
course. But we can't do anything without the preliminary charter from the chief
of the tribe. I know it isn't at Spencer's office, because I bribed Raybold to
see. I have come to the conclusion that we shall find what we want at Ledge
Point. We'll walk over to Ledge Point presently and make sure."</p>
<p>"We can't get into the house at this time of night," Morton protested. "Oh,
yes, we can," Cardella said with a significant wink. "I'll see to all that. But
after this move on the part of the foe it won't do to wait any longer. We shall
get into the house quite easily, and what is more we shall be welcomed."</p>
<p>"You've got all our papers, of course, you've got all those bills that were
stolen from Spencer's safe? Lord, what a complicated business it is
altogether!"</p>
<p>"I've got everything," Cardella said. "I ought perhaps to have destroyed
those bills. They would be highly dangerous in the hands of a third party. But
on the other hand when once Grant is safe in gaol for a term of years we shall
be able to turn those bills into money, my lad. Nobody but we know that the
firm of Spencer and Grant is really solvent."</p>
<p>"Well, we need not go into that," Morton muttered. "Have you got Clarkson's
letters here? I am going to put the screw on Clarkson; I don't believe he is
doing the right thing by us. Give me those two letters, and I'll take them to
London with me to-morrow."</p>
<p>Cardella nodded approvingly. He placed his hand under the white expanse of
his shirt front and produced his bunch of keys. He proceeded to detach the
little one with the gold top. He looked at this with a frown on his face.</p>
<p>"I don't understand this at all," he said. "Somebody has been tampering with
this key. There is a little disc on the top that moves with the days of the
week. As this is Saturday the number on the disc should be 6. It is No. 1
instead. As sure as fate somebody has had the key in his hand since I dressed
for dinner."</p>
<p>"Oh, you have made some mistake," Morton said carelessly. "Or perhaps the
machinery has gone wrong."</p>
<p>Cardella clicked a little spring and the seven numbers spun round smoothly.
A dark and troubled look came into his eyes.</p>
<p>"I make no mistakes in these matters," he said. "I am positively certain
that I am right. The last time I used the key was just before dinner. But to
make assurance doubly sure&mdash;"</p>
<p>He rose abruptly from his chair, and left the room. He came back presently
with a white face and an unholy rage blazing in his black eyes. He fairly
trembled with passion.</p>
<p>"We've been robbed," he said hoarsely. "The letters are gone. So are the
bills. They were all in their places this afternoon. We have a very deep and
cunning gang to deal with here. How did they manage to get at my safe? How did
they contrive to get hold of my key between dinner time and now? Not a soul but
you knew that I carried the key round my neck, and you only knew it the last
few moments. I can't think who has betrayed me unless it
is&mdash;is&mdash;"</p>
<p>He paused, and his speech died away to a mutter. He was brooding over
something in his mind. A black and bitter suspicion gathered in his eyes.</p>
<p>"It's all very strange," he went on. "That business at the telephone. Then
the messenger who came for you. And now the papers have gone. Nobody could have
touched the key till I fell asleep in my chair after dinner. I wonder if I was
drugged? I wonder if that man Smith had anything to do with it. It seems
impossible that a congenital idiot like that&mdash;but one can never tell. And
he was alone with me. He might have pretended to go to bed early. In a case
like this one hardly knows who to suspect. I'll go and make sure."</p>
<p>Cardella strode up the stairs two at a time. The door of Smith's room was
locked. He tapped on the panels once or twice more and more loudly, but no
reply came. In a sudden fit of exasperation, he stepped back and lunged at the
door with his shoulder. The wood gave way with a crash.</p>
<p>At the same moment Mrs. Cardella appeared in the corridor. She stood there
regarding the breaking of the door with cold and distant displeasure.</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of this midnight madness?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"It was necessary for me to see Smith," Cardella explained sullenly.
"Something has happened that may make all the difference to my fortunes. I have
been robbed, robbed since dinner. When we sat down to our wine after you left
the dining-room everything was in order. I did what I have never done
before&mdash;I fell asleep in my chair. I have been drugged. Nobody could
possibly have done this but Smith&mdash;"</p>
<p>"With all his little peculiarities. Mr. Smith is a gentleman."</p>
<p>"Handsome is as handsome does," Cardella said bitterly. "I shall be quite
ready to listen to what Smith has to say. Now, if you will stand aside. Oh, I
expected this!"</p>
<p>The bedroom was empty; there was no sign of John Smith to be seen! Cardella
turned on his wife a searching glance that had something of murder in it.</p>
<p>"He could not have done this without my keys," he said hoarsely. "And he
would never have known where to find the keys if somebody had not told him. I
thought that nobody knew but myself, but I had forgotten one other. I must have
a few words with you presently."</p>
<p>Mrs. Cardella turned a cold and scornful face to her husband.</p>
<p>"Very well," she said. "I shall be ready for you. I shall be glad if you
will make a little less noise&mdash;it is apt to alarm the servants."</p>
<p>She turned coldly on her heel, and closed the door of her room behind her.
Cardella watched her with his hand drawn up as if he were clutching
something.</p>
<p>"It's true, it's true," he hissed. "If it's true, my lady, look to
yourself."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;A Woman Scorned.</h2>
<p>Morton listened moodily enough. It looked as if the thoughtfully planned
scheme was discovered. The loss of those letters and bills was terrible. And
the real author of the mischief was not far off. All Morton's hatred of Mrs.
Cardella raged and boiled in his heart now.</p>
<p>"Look here," he said, hoarsely, "I may offend you, but I've got something to
suggest. I know your wife is a wonderful woman, and that you think there is
nobody like her in the world. But do you always feel that you can trust her? Do
you honestly believe that she cares for you?"</p>
<p>The questions found Cardella silent. That his wife did not care for him he
knew. She had never made any disguise of her feelings on that point. He brooded
darkly.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to suggest," he asked, "that she took my keys?"</p>
<p>"Curse it all&mdash;yes!" Morton cried. "Who else could have done so? If she
didn't take the keys, she told Smith where to find them. I believe that she is
in the conspiracy. Ask her what she was doing in the garden to-night. Ask her
why she disguised herself, and why she sneaked in by means of the drawing-room
window. I saw the whole thing myself. I should have said nothing about it but
for this business. Don't waste any further time."</p>
<p>Cardella rose slowly from his seat. He was seeing many things now beyond the
trouble of the moment. He was asking himself questions. If his wife had
betrayed him in this matter then she was going to suffer. She was a sort of
passion with him; his admiration for her was sincere. But in a case like this,
the desire for vengeance swallowed up everything else. He would like to see her
stripped of everything, walking in the streets begging her bread. For the
moment he forgot her profession. He called her loudly from the drawing-room
where he had turned on the lights.</p>
<p>She came in her cold slow deliberate way, and flung herself into a chair.
She asked no questions, she could see quite plainly that she was face to face
with a crisis in her life.</p>
<p>"Will you be as brief as possible, please?" she said.</p>
<p>"I shall do things in my own way!" Cardella said. "Why have you betrayed
me?"</p>
<p>"Surely you are the last person in the world to reproach anybody with
that."</p>
<p>"Oh, I can assure you that you will gain nothing by taking that line. I am
not going to ask you what you were doing outside to-night, because that is a
minor matter. I am going to ask you if you took my keys to-night? Did you give
them to Smith?"</p>
<p>Cardella looked for something in the way of prevarication. The reply
staggered him.</p>
<p>"I told him where to find them," the woman said indifferently. "That is all
I had to do in the matter. And in the same circumstances I should do it again.
It is useless to try legitimate methods with men like Robert Morton and
yourself. You must be fought with your own weapons. You were about to do a
great wrong to a young man whose happiness is bound up with a girl I am fond
of. Mr. Smith told me the whole story. He asked me to help him. I did not
think&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That the thing would come out so soon. Otherwise, I suppose, you would not
have dared&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Dared! I dare anything! I dare to stand before you now and tell you what I
think! I was glad to have the chance of righting the foul wrong! I was glad to
be able to help an innocent girl to regain her lost happiness. And I was glad
to get even with you at last!"</p>
<p>Some of Cardella's passion faded away. He had not expected to find an
electric force like this.</p>
<p>His rage and anger was nothing compared with the raging tornado of the
woman's hate, expressed, though it was in words clear and cold and cutting.
Here was something he had not expected.</p>
<p>"Listen!" the woman went on. "I know everything. I even know that you are a
worse scoundrel than I took you for. To gain your own ends you would send an
innocent man to gaol. Mr. Smith told me. It is to him that I owe my chance in
life. He has ever been a good friend to me. After I married you I found out why
I lost my lover. You did not shoot him or poison him, but you murdered him all
the same. You got him out of the way so that you could marry me. And after I
became your wife I found it out. Ah! If you only realised my feelings, if you
had only known you would not have dared to stay by me. The miracle to me is
that I did not kill you. I planned to do so more than once. I disguised my
feelings. I pretended to be your friend. It was my finest piece of acting. But
I did not kill you, because you would not have known, and I should have been
deprived of my vengeance. By that time I had begun to see the kind of man that
you are. I found out the way to do you a deadly mischief. My plan of vengeance
will hurt you most of all. And I have taken it."</p>
<p>Cardella stood there listening. Admiration and hate struggled within him for
the mastery.</p>
<p>"Do you realise what all this means?" he asked hoarsely. "You can't stay
here after what&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Stay here! Do you suppose I want to stay? Do you suppose I could stay after
this? Man, I should rise up in the middle of some night and murder you. To
morrow&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No," Cardella yelled. "To-night, now! Stripped of your jewels and your
dresses. Into the pouring rain, out into the world without a penny in your
pocket. Do you understand that, Jezebel? Has that gone home to the right place,
you handsome thief? Does that appeal to you?"</p>
<p>Beside himself with rage, the man strode across the room and dealt the woman
a savage blow full on the forehead. She staggered back before the force of the
assault; she would have fallen but for a table close behind her. The white
flesh showed the cruel scar red and livid, but no cry of pain came from Mrs.
Cardella's lips. Her features never changed.</p>
<p>"I fancy I understand everything," she said. "I am not surprised. It only
wanted you to play the coward like that to pile up the measure of your
loathsome vices."</p>
<p>She turned without another word and crossed to the window. Here she stood
for a moment and tore the jewels from her hair. One by one she crashed the
glittering diamonds from her fingers and flung them with a gesture of scorn and
contempt to the far side of the room.</p>
<p>"There," she cried, "I am free at last. I could not take anything that
belongs to you. I am only sorry that I have to take this dress with me. Sell
those stones and pay your creditors with the money. They no more belong to you
than they do to me. And that is all I have to say."</p>
<p>She pushed back the catch of the window and stalked out into the night. The
rain had ceased to fall, but it was still wild and black. Just as she was, in
that thin dress and dainty shoes, she walked as in a waking dream. Her head was
aching horribly; she was very, very tired. She would turn in at some house and
ask for a night's shelter. Then the earth seemed to rise up and meet her, and
she remembered no more.</p>
<p>Cardella walked slowly back to the dining-room. He was filled with shame and
anger and a certain dread. How far had this thing gone? And was it possible to
find some remedy for things. He glanced at his companion who seemed to regard
him with marked displeasure.</p>
<p>"Well, you've made a fine mess of it," he said. "I heard everything. I
simply couldn't help it. I'm not very scrupulous myself, but when it comes to
laying hands upon a woman&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Curse you, be quiet, or I'll lay hands on you," Cardella screamed in a
sudden fury. "You heard what she said. She has betrayed me&mdash;betrayed me
because I got her lover out of the way and married her. Anyway, she's gone, and
she's not likely to do any further mischief so far as we are concerned."</p>
<p>"You were a great fool to let her go like that. People are certain to
talk."</p>
<p>"Let 'em talk. And they'll have something to talk about with a vengeance
unless we make a move soon. We shall have to go over to Ledge Point at once. We
must get those papers to-night. Its any odds that Smith does not find out what
has happened yet. He will probably think that I am still ignorant of my loss.
If we can get hold of him and have him back here, why&mdash;"</p>
<p>Cardella paused significantly. Morton knew exactly what was passing in the
mind of his chief. If Smith in ignorance of the unexpected turn of events had
appeared at that moment it would have gone hard with his especially as Mrs.
Cardella was no longer in the house.</p>
<p>"A little courage now and all will be well," Cardella went on. "We must
manage to get on the track of Smith by daylight. It's just possible that he may
come back here. In that case the sooner we are up to Ledge Point and back the
better."</p>
<p>"Are we going to commit burglary then?" Morton asked.</p>
<p>"No, we are not," Cardella muttered. "Oh, come along. When there is any
danger about you are a pretty bad starter. And the delay of an hour may be
fatal."</p>
<p>Stung by this, Morton rose to his feet. It was no great way to Ledge Point,
and it was still less than one o'clock in the morning when the destination was
reached. With the air of a man who knows exactly what he is doing, Cardella
strode on till the house loomed before him. He was looking for a side door, and
he had to strike a match to find it. He had his finger on the bell. A minute or
two later and a white frightened face appeared.</p>
<p>"Well, Jenner," Cardella said. "Glad to see us, eh? Thought perhaps that we
were never coming? We have been detained on business of importance, and could
not get here before. Put up the lights."</p>
<p>Jenner murmured something in an uncertain voice. He was horribly white and
nervous, plentiful beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead. He stood
there with the door open, and the brilliant stream of light behind him, so that
the watchers on the lawn could see everything.</p>
<p>"What does it all mean?" Grant asked his companion. Smith chuckled.</p>
<p>"That is exactly what we are here to find out," he said. "You can see for
yourself what a faithful servant Jenner has proved. He has been bribed, of
course. But we shall hear and see a great deal more if we are inside the house.
Come along."</p>
<p>"Into the house?" Grant asked. "You actually mean it?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do, my dear fellow. Everything is arranged. The flats are
joined properly and the scene is set. Unless I am mistaken it will be a most
interesting performance."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;"An Angel Unawares."</h2>
<p>The bridge tables in the drawing-room at Grant Lea were breaking up. With a
deep sigh of thankfulness Ellen Scarsdale realised that the hour for departure
was at hand. Never could she remember a more trying evening. There was an air
of unreality about it, too. A few hours before she had been busy in her garden,
a happy woman with hardly a cloud on the horizon. She had been thinking how
wonderfully nice the flowers looked; the house itself had never appeared to
better advantage. And all this was only a matter of some seven hours ago. It
seemed almost impossible to believe that she had gone through all this worry
and anxiety since then. The world and her place in it had changed entirely. She
was filled with a restless anxiety that amounted to terror. Anything to get
away home, to save the shame that loomed before her. She was afraid as yet to
dwell upon what might happen afterwards&mdash;the present was bad enough in all
conscience. She gathered up her skirts presently, and began to look about for
Hubert Grant. There was still a certain amount of desultory conversation going
on; guests were lingering over their farewells.</p>
<p>"Where is my&mdash;I mean Mr. Grant?" Ellen whispered to May.</p>
<p>"I ought to have told you before," May said. "Only you were playing cards
and I could get no opportunity. Hubert has gone away. Somebody came and fetched
him. Of course you heard that Mr. Morton had been here? Dreadful, wasn't it?
Fortunately my father behaved quite nicely. He did not want to have any fuss.
He sent Hubert to see Mr. Morton. It was like one of those funny scenes in a
comedy&mdash;only it wasn't at all funny so far as we were concerned."</p>
<p>"But there was some kind of disturbance?" Ellen Scarsdale asked.</p>
<p>"There wasn't. When Hubert got back to the library Mr. Morton had vanished.
He just walked out of the house without saying another word. No doubt he was
most fearfully disrupted. Then somebody came along and wanted Hubert at once. I
don't know what it was all about, but he had to go."</p>
<p>"He went off without saying good-bye to anybody?"</p>
<p>"My dear Ellen, he had to. There was not a moment to be lost. He asked me to
tell you. He also asked me to make his apologies to my father."</p>
<p>Mrs. Scarsdale folded her hands in despair. She had a desire to burst into
hysterical laughter. In spite of everything, there was a suggestion of wild
farce in the situation.</p>
<p>"I shall break down, I know I shall," she said. "My dear child, will you see
if my carriage is ready. Positively I have remained here chattering till
everybody else has gone. And now I have actually got to apologise to Sir Bruce
for the rudeness of my companion&mdash;"</p>
<p>Sir Bruce came across the room towards Ellen Scarsdale. She was the last
guest left. Lady Leverton was in the hall chattering to a little group getting
ready for their car. There was something grave, almost stern, in Leverton's
face as he came up.</p>
<p>"What has become of Mr. Morton?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," Mrs. Scarsdale stammered. "I understand that
somebody sent for him. Very important business he told May that it was. You
were engaged."</p>
<p>"Yes, I was engaged," Sir Bruce said thoughtfully. "It was a strange affair
altogether. You bring a stranger here who calls himself Robert Morton, and then
another claimant to the same name makes his appearance. When I see him he makes
a startling accusation. Had not my house been full of guests, I should have
investigated the charge at once. But you see I was in rather an awkward
position. I could not have anything like a scandal when my friends were here. I
sent your&mdash;I mean Mr. Morton, to see the other man, and I hear later that
the other man has discreetly retired. Whether he was frightened or whether he
deemed discretion to be the better part of valour I don't know. But I am not
quite satisfied. I fancy you could tell me more if you liked, Ellen."</p>
<p>Mrs. Scarsdale looked up with a startled expression on her face. Sir Bruce
looked grave enough, but the kindly tone of his voice touched the girl to
tears. She covered her face with her hands, she leant forward, her whole frame
shaking with sobs.</p>
<p>"I am a wretch," she said, "a deceitful little wretch! How did you find me
out?"</p>
<p>"My dear child, the expression of your face. You have been most miserably
unhappy all the evening. Of course I make due allowance for the loss of all
your money. But that would not frighten you, that would not keep you looking
over your shoulder all the time end starting as everybody came into the room.
Why not tell me all about it, Ellen. Who was your friend?"</p>
<p>"You have guessed that he was not Mr. Morton at all?"</p>
<p>"I have had my suspicions, yes. And you have confessed them. I am quite sure
that you would not willingly do me an injury. The deception was forced on
you."</p>
<p>"Oh, it was. Not that that is any excuse. I was taken unawares, carried off
my feet. When I left home I was alone in the brougham. When I got here, my
companion was with me pleading passionately that I should pass him off as
Robert Morton. If you had been a woman and had heard what he had to say you
would have done the same. The very urgent reasons&mdash;"</p>
<p>Ellen Scarsdale paused suddenly.</p>
<p>Sir Bruce's face had grown hard and stern. She wondered what it was that had
changed his mood like this. Leverton was turning the events of the evening over
rapidly in his mind. He recalled the fact that he had found the alleged Morton
and May in closest conversation. He began to grasp things dimly and
unpleasantly.</p>
<p>"I know that you can never forgive me," Ellen cried. "If I tell you
everything&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That is exactly what I want you to do. Did those urgent reasons that I
spoke of have anything to do with my daughter? Did you smuggle a lover under my
roof?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Scarsdale had no reply. She sat there with her face averted. She could
not see that May was standing in the doorway listening to every word. The girl
came forward now, her face deadly pale, but there was a resolute light in her
eyes.</p>
<p>"I am to blame father," she said. "It was my lover who was here
to-night."</p>
<p>"Oh, I did not mean to betray you," Ellen cried. "I did not mean to shrink.
But Sir Bruce was so good and kind that&mdash;that I had to say something. It
was all my fault."</p>
<p>"It wasn't," May said. "You only followed the dictates of your own kind
heart. In your case I should have behaved just the same. You had better go,
dear. I will explain. And when I have done I can, I fancy, promise you that my
father will hold you blameless."</p>
<p>Sir Bruce nodded his head gravely. He offered Ellen his arm and put her in
the brougham. The grasp of his hand was just as friendly as it had ever
been.</p>
<p>"I shall not blame you," he said. "I am quite sure that at the worst you
have been no more than thoughtless. And you women are so terribly swayed by
sentiment. Good-night."</p>
<p>But Sir Bruce was feeling more stern and hard as he returned to the
drawing-room. May stood there awaiting him. Lady Leverton was upstairs with
Lady Mossingford, who had retired for the night. May could guess what her
mother had to say to Lady Mossingford.</p>
<p>"Well," Sir Bruce said. "What have you to say to me, May?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know that I have done wrong. I know that I have behaved abominably.
But I meant to tell you at the first favourable opportunity, father. I hoped to
make you forget your prejudice against&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, then the young man is not altogether desirable. Some acquaintance you
made in London, I suppose. I am bound to confess that I liked the look of this
impersonator of Mr. Morton's. He looked like a gentleman, he is very nice to
the eye, and he has an honest, resolute face. But, on the other hand, a man who
would consent to play so dishonourable a trick upon a perfect
stranger&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But my dear father, it was absolutely necessary to do so," May
protested.</p>
<p>"Really! Well, one lives and learns. I cannot conceive a set of
circumstances in which one man enters the house of another, under an assumed
name, and sits down to a dinner to which he has not been invited. My dear
child, will you kindly favour me with a few more details of the history of this
strange and fascinating young man who hypnotises Mrs. Scarsdale into bringing
him here and induces you to deceive me in this fashion. What is his proper
name?"</p>
<p>The question was asked now, and it would have to be answered. For the first
time May bent her head. The hot blood flowed into her face.</p>
<p>"Hubert Grant," she whispered. "Hubert Grant. And he is the only man I could
ever care for."</p>
<p>Sir Bruce fairly started. His eyes filled with horror and loathing.</p>
<p>"Hubert Grant," he gasped. "The felon. The broken bankrupt who is a fugitive
from justice. The man for whose apprehension a warrant has been issued! His
father was once my friend. He served me as few men have ever been served
before. Like father, like son! And you allowed him to come here, to take my
hand, to sit down at my table with honourable people! To think that my own
child should so for humiliate me. May I could not have believed this."</p>
<p>The tears were running freely down May's cheeks. It was worse than she had
expected.</p>
<p>"I met him in London," she said sadly. "I did not guess who he was at first.
And by the time that I found out I&mdash;I loved him. And he asked me to be has
wife. We had to keep the engagement a secret until we could be sure that you
would consent. We wanted you to realise that Hubert was quite different from
his father. And I am quite sure&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And this is the way the fellow proves his worth? But why this madness? What
had you to gain by such a lunatic scheme? Suppose Grant had been recognised by
one of my guests! And is there something that you are still keeping from
me?"</p>
<p>It was bitterly hard and cruel for the girl to bear. From her own side, she
had made full confession. But she could not justify herself and Grant further
without implicating other people. A passionate fit of subbing almost choked
her. The air of the room was hot and stifling. She crossed over and flung two
of the windows leading to the lawn wide open. Oh, if her father only knew, if
he only realised for whom this danger had been run! But she could not speak; he
must think the worst of her.</p>
<p>Her mother&mdash;Lady Leverton was in the room. Her pleased smile gave way
to a frightened look.</p>
<p>"What have you two been quarreling about?" she asked. "And May in tears.
Why?"</p>
<p>Leverton proceeded to explain. He was facing two white-faced women now
instead of one. Lady Leverton stood with her hands on the back of a chair
holding on so tightly that her knuckles stood out white and clear from the
hand. For she could understand&mdash;</p>
<p>"That is all I know so far." Sir Bruce exclaimed. "Of course there is a good
deal more to be told. I might have given my consent in the ordinary way but not
like this&mdash;why was this done? Why am I flouted and insulted in this way
and my guests humiliated. That I insist upon being told."</p>
<p>Sir Bruce spoke sternly enough now. May's sobs broke out afresh. She gave
one pitiful pleading glance in the direction of her mother, then she hid her
face in her hands again.</p>
<p>Lady Leverton swayed unsteadily. It was some time before she could
speak.</p>
<p>"I can tell you that," she said. "It was done to save me. There was no other
way."</p>
<p>A little broken cry came from May's lips. Sir Bruce stood there a picture of
astonished indignation.</p>
<p>"To save you!" he echoed. "What can you possibly have to do with it?"</p>
<p>"It was a matter of money," Lady Leverton went on. "Bridge debts. I have
been gambling, Bruce. I have been gambling on and off for a long time. The
others were too sharp and clever for me. I was desperately in debt. When Lady
Mossingford went to Paris from here to see her son she gave her diamonds into
my charge. And I pawned them&mdash;I borrowed money on them from Paul Spencer.
I had to get those gems back to-night. I had to! And Spencer was dead, and they
were in his safe. May found everything out. I did not know that there was
anything between her and Hubert Grant. But she said she would help me. Her
scheme was partly hers and partly Grant's. And Lady Mossingford has her jewels
back."</p>
<p>Sir Bruce listened in a kind of dream. Events were crowding too thick and
fast for him to grasp them as they passed. The whole system seemed to be
crumbling under his feet. An hour or two ago and he had not dreamt of anything
of this kind. And now he was indebted to a fellow for the honour of his house.
But for Grant his name would have been a by-word in the country.</p>
<p>"I'll say nothing more to-night," he said. "I am tired and worn out. I never
expected anything so utterly humiliating as this. And so I am the debtor of
Hubert Grant. I shall be able to appreciate perhaps later on what he has saved
me. But a thief like that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no," May said. She stood in the shadow of the open window. "Hubert is
no thief. He is the victim of an infamous conspiracy. All the world will know
before long that he is innocent of this wicked charge. I implore you not to be
so hard, father."</p>
<p>"Nobody would be more pleased to know this is so," Sir Bruce murmured. "But
who is to prove it? Is there a body in the wide world who can do so?"</p>
<p>A hand thrust May aside and a woman came into the room. Mrs. Cardella stood
there with flaming eyes and heaving breast. A livid red scar stood out on her
white forehead.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said. "Yes, Sir Bruce. I am one of the persons in the world who
can prove it."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.&mdash;The Ghost Approaches.</h2>
<p>"We shall certainly do much better in the house," Smith whispered. "I have a
pretty fair idea as to what those rascals are up to, and I want to be quite
sure. The fact of your knowing the house so well is of great assistance to me.
I'm afraid that Cardella has found me out."</p>
<p>"Found you out in what way?" Hubert asked. "That I have robbed him. He was
bound to discover that sooner or later, but on the whole, it would have been
better if the discovery had been postponed till to-morrow. Still, I had to
discount that. You will see presently what we are here for. Meanwhile will you
please make a note of the fact that the honest Jenner is in the pay of
Cardella. What would Spencer say to that?"</p>
<p>"He always said that there never was a servant like Jenner," Hubert
murmured. "Yes&mdash;he told me so, times out of number. We argued the matter
often. Personally, I don't believe that there is such a thing as a really
honest 'gentleman's gentleman.' According to the traditions of the stage, such
a creature does not exist. And this business is being run entirely on stage
traditions. I am exceedingly glad that I fetched Morton away from Grant Lea
this evening."</p>
<p>There was no chance now for further conversation. It was no easy matter to
follow the conspirators without being discovered. They made their way as far as
the dining-room, where Jenner put up the lights. Fortunately the hall had been
reduced to darkness again.</p>
<p>Standing there close to come old leather hangings. Smith and his companion
could see and hear all that was going on. Jenner produced some glasses and a
bottle of champagne, there was the scraping of matches and the smell of
cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>"I didn't expect you gentlemen to-night," Jenner said in his most respectful
manner.</p>
<p>"And I didn't expect to come," Cardella explained. "But I have been robbed
of some valuable papers, and thus it becomes necessary to act without delay. A
man who is actually my guest got hold of my keys. There is a patent arrangement
in one of the keys, and if a stranger tampered with it&mdash;"</p>
<p>Smith chuckled. The conversation seemed to amuse him.</p>
<p>"So that's how he found it out," he whispered to Hubert. "I was wondering
why he had got so soon on the track of the thief. I ought to have guarded
against that. But then one can't think of everything. After all, it only
precipitates matters, and you will be out of your misery all the sooner."</p>
<p>But Hubert did not appear to be listening. He was deeply interested in what
was taking place in the dining room. He could see Jenner standing there rubbing
one hand over the other, a pleased grin on his face.</p>
<p>"Quite right, gentlemen," he said; "I am entirely at your service. But there
is a good deal of danger for me&mdash;a great deal more danger than you
imagine. You see, the police hold me responsible for the safety of everything
here. They have sealed up all the boxes and the safe&mdash;"</p>
<p>A cry of anger broke from Cardella.</p>
<p>"Curse it all!" he muttered. "I had forgotten that. I don't care a rap about
the safe, because there is nothing of any value in there. Spencer knew that it
would be opened first thing, and the old fox would choose some other hiding
place for his papers. But that police seal is an awkward matter."</p>
<p>"Couldn't we take an impression of it?" suggested Morton.</p>
<p>"Possibly," Cardella said. "If we had some wax it might be done. Then we
could get a die cut in the course of tomorrow, and Jenner could re-seal the
boxes. There's a certain amount of risk, of course, but I don't suppose that
the police will come along making trouble within the next day of so. Jenner
will not object to that for a few hours, I'm sure."</p>
<p>"Jenner isn't going to do anything of the kind!" that individual said with a
sudden change of manner. "I'm not a man of courage, and I don't mind saying so.
I'm a gentleman's servant, I am, and I make my money according to the rules of
the game. Mr. Cardella promised me L100 if I would let him have the run of the
place for a day or two and no questions asked. If any seals are broken the risk
is not going to be mine, and don't you forget it."</p>
<p>"Our friend does not appear to trust us," Morton said.</p>
<p>"He doesn't!" Jenner responded, curtly. "Not half. All the boxes you speak
of are in the cellar. There are perhaps a dozen of them altogether. Whether the
police counted them or not I do not know. But I am a bit of a carpenter, and
I've got a good chest of tools. I daresay there are some of them boxes which I
could open and close again and nobody any the wiser."</p>
<p>"Oh, come&mdash;that's more promising." Cardella said in a mollified voice.
"Where are the boxes?"</p>
<p>"They are in the cellar&mdash;in the wine cellar, in fact. To my certain
knowledge, most of them have not been looked at for years. It's just possible
that some of the cases are full of wine. There's a good stock of the best in
the cellar, though my master did not drink much. If you'd come this way I'll
show you, and you can help yourselves."</p>
<p>Grant and his companion stepped discreetly behind the leather hangings as
the two came out into the hall, guided by Jenner, and made their way to the
cellars.</p>
<p>This part of the house was large and commodious; there were many angles and
corners which Jenner proceeded to flood with light. Standing at the top of the
steps the watchers could see what was going on.</p>
<p>"I think that we shall do all right here," said Smith. "We can see
everything without the slightest chance of being seen. And if necessary, we can
lock those fellows in. It would take them hours to get out, and meanwhile we
could summon the police. A new sensation it would be for the City to-morrow.
The millionaire Julius Cardella charged with burglary!"</p>
<p>"Is that what you are going to do?" Hubert asked. "Well, the temptation is
pretty strong," Smith chuckled. "It would serve them right. But on the other
hand, it would spoil my play altogether. It would ruin one of the most
interesting situations ever invented by a dramatist. You see, I have to be
ready for emergencies, and I understand the exact moment to turn them to
account. We shall do better than that."</p>
<p>"What do these people expect to find here?" Hubert asked.</p>
<p>"Buried treasure, of course," Smith responded with the same dry chuckle.
"Bars of silver and nuggets of gold concealed in an old wine case. Bottles full
of diamonds, perhaps. What they are really looking for are certain papers
connected with the Quogga concession. Cardella knows that Paul Spencer was as
secretive as a magpie. Personally, I believe that those papers are down here.
It is very good of those people to save us all this trouble."</p>
<p>One or two boxes had been discovered and discarded as obviously of no
importance. A long talk followed as to the prudence of opening them.</p>
<p>"Oh, let's make a start on something," Morton said, impatiently. "We shall
be here all night, else. Now what is in this case with the queer lettering all
over it?"</p>
<p>Jenner explained that it had contained, or did contain Tokay. Morton pushed
the case over with his foot. There was a rattle of bottles inside, but the box
itself was curiously light.</p>
<p>"Funny thing," Cardella said. "The case is carefully sealed, and yet those
bottles must be empty. And Tokay is one of those rare and extravagant wines
that people only drink out of glasses as big as a thimble. Very few people
indeed can afford to touch it, and yet these bottles are empty. My good Jenner,
I have a very strong and lively curiosity to see inside that case."</p>
<p>"It isn't me who is stopping you, sir," Jenner said with a grin.</p>
<p>"Very well, then. The police appear to have done their work effectually.
Fancy sealing a case like this. But an expert carpenter could remove the bottom
and put it back again so neatly as to avoid all suspicion. Go and fetch your
tools. Also some of those wire nails."</p>
<p>Jenner produced one or two tools from his pocket. He carefully pulled the
bottom off the case, and exposed the black wide-mouthed bottles inside. They
were loosely corked, so that it was not a difficult matter to remove the
stopper with the hand. Jenner bustled away to get nails and hammer. Morton drew
one of the corks, and turned the bottle upside down. A shower of neatly folded
papers fell to the floor, and Cardella took them carefully. As he proceeded to
spread out one after another his dark eyes gleamed, his hands shook
strangely.</p>
<p>"Look at these," he whispered. "Lord love the man, look at these! Bonds,
bills, coupons. Every one of them good stuff and worth money on the market.
Open another bottle and see what you can find before Jenner comes back. Upon my
word, we have stumbled upon a fortune."</p>
<p>"Same here," Morton said hoarsely. "The same story. Now, what in the name of
goodness, does all this mean? Put your papers back again, shove in the corks
and replace the bottles. Not a word of this to Jenner. Then we'll kick the box
back in its place and come back here to-morrow night and carry the whole lot
away. It won't be a difficult matter to get rid of Jenner for an hour or two.
And now let us have a hunt round everywhere for those other papers."</p>
<p>At the same time Jenner bustled back into the cellar. He looked inquiringly
at his fellow conspirators. With a contemptuous kick Cardella indicated the
box.</p>
<p>"Nail it up," he said. "Nothing there but a lot of papers, redeemed bonds
and the like. Wonder why a business man like Spencer kept all that rubbish.
Besides, it wastes our precious time. Have you got anything likely over there,
Morton?"</p>
<p>Jenner paused with his hammer in his hand.</p>
<p>In the stillness of the house the rippling purr of the electric bell on the
front door came with a startling effect. A minute later and the bell rang
again. This time it lasted for the best part of a minute. Jenner listened with
a white set face.</p>
<p>"Go and answer it." Cardella suggested. "What are you frightened about? It's
very late, of course, but that it no reason why somebody shouldn't&mdash;go and
answer it."</p>
<p>Jenner crept shakily up the stairs.</p>
<p>With a chuckle, Smith watched him pass.</p>
<p>"I should like to share your secret," Hubert said.</p>
<p>"One moment, my boy, only one moment," Smith whispered. "This is positively
splendid. It is a development beyond my wildest dreams. Worthy of Pinero at his
best. Ah, my young friend, you are going to see something like a curtain
now."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.&mdash;A Pregnant Message.</h2>
<p>Sir Bruce Leverton forgot his own troubles for the moment. He knew in some
vague way that Mrs. Cardella was in deep and bitter distress. She spoke in a
distant fashion, as if she were not fully conscious of what she was saying. She
pressed her hand to her head.</p>
<p>"You will pardon me," she said. "I did not mean to come here at all.
I&mdash;I was out for a walk. Then I saw the light in the window, and it
attracted me...........like the moth is attracted by the candle."</p>
<p>Leverton came forward courteously enough. He offered his arm to the speaker,
and led her to a chair. He could see the raindrops glistening on her dress and
sparkling like a silver powder on her glorious hair. And he could see, too, the
trouble in her eyes.</p>
<p>"You are not quite yourself," he said, soothingly. "Do sit down for a time
and rest. Would you like to have a doctor? I see you have met with an
accident."</p>
<p>Mrs. Cardella passed a weary hand over her scarred forehead.</p>
<p>"That is no accident," she said quietly. "My husband did it. He struck
me."</p>
<p>Leverton suppressed a groan. There are some occasions when all the tact and
delicacy in the world is lost, and this was one of them. He looked helplessly
at his wife and daughter. Then was the time when a woman's touch was needed.
The poor creature was wet; her thin shoes were soaked and broken. What was
going to be the end of this amazing night, Leverton wondered.</p>
<p>"My dear," he said awkwardly. "Mrs. Cardella must change her dress. Her
shoes, too&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't notice it," the woman said. "I am not cold. I walked out of the
house just as I was. I had not the least idea what I was doing. I can't go back
there again."</p>
<p>She said this as if it were the most natural thing in the world. She had
forgotten that these people were absolute strangers to her. She could remember
nothing but her desire for vengeance, and the knowledge that she could say a
good word for Hubert Grant. Then it came back to her.</p>
<p>"I am ashamed of myself," she went on. "I should not give you all this
worry. To come into the house of strangers like this! You who have never called
upon me!"</p>
<p>Lady Leverton flushed a little uncomfortably. She had never called on Mrs.
Cardella for what appeared to her to be perfectly natural reasons. She admired
and respected Mrs. Cardella as a beautiful woman and one of the most
distinguished ornaments of her profession, but Cardella's wife was quite
another thing. The man's reputation was too evil; he kept the wrong class of
associates. But all these silly little shibboleths were forgotten now.</p>
<p>"I have always been anxious to know you," Lady Leverton murmured.
"But&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I quite understand. As Cardella's wife? Exactly. In the circumstances
I should have done the same thing. But I am going back to the stage again. I
shall never live with him any more. Can you imagine a man marrying a woman that
he hates? No? But you can imagine a woman marrying a man that she loathes. We
are like that. And when he found out he struck me."</p>
<p>Lady Leverton rose. She was feeling the strain of it all. And deep down in
her frivolous kindly heart was a fine pity for this unhappy woman.</p>
<p>"Come up to my room," she urged. "I have a fire there. We will give you some
dry clothing and make you comfortable for the night. It will be a great
pleasure to help you."</p>
<p>Mrs. Cardella smiled gratefully. The wild look was fading from her eyes, her
beauty seemed to grow warmer.</p>
<p>"You are very kind," she said. "All the same I ought not to have come here.
Perhaps I should have done something foolish if I had not seen the light. Such
a feeling of absolute loneliness. It was good to hear voices, to see a room
like this, so refined and yet so like home. But I never had one. You cannot
possibly have a home in Park Lane."</p>
<p>Sir Bruce smiled bitterly. Grant Lea had been very little like home the last
hour or so. Mrs. Cardella caught his eye, and seemed to read his thoughts.</p>
<p>"I'd like to get these wet things off," she said. "I am beginning to feel
the cold. And when I have done so, I shall be glad to come down again and
convince Sir Bruce that I have only told the truth so far as Hubert Grant is
concerned. And I can prove it."</p>
<p>Sir Bruce murmured something appropriate. Once he was alone he paced up and
down the room a prey to anxious and disturbing thought. He had always taken a
great pride in his house and his family. He did not fail to recognise the
importance of his position. Of late he had been getting a little behindhand,
but that appeared to be due to his wife's growing extravagances. He had not
imagined that his money had been diverted from its legitimate sources to pay
his wife's gambling debts. He regarded May as a heart-whole child who some day
or another would marry in her proper station. And here, in the course of an
hour or so, the whole fabric had come tumbling about his ears. Both his
daughter and his wife had disgraced themselves beyond measure.</p>
<p>There was some allowance to be made for May. She was young and romantic, she
had been led away by the good looks and fascinating ways of Hubert Grant. And
yet she had made a good many sacrifices, and ran some risks to save her
mother's good name. Thank God that that disgrace had been averted. The
situation had been saved in the nick of time. And yet all these efforts would
have been wasted had it not been for Hubert Grant. In spite of all the danger
and trouble before him, he had turned aside to do May this incomparable
service!</p>
<p>Leverton could see quite clearly now why Grant had come there masquerading
as Robert Morton. He had gained nothing by it personally, but he had saved the
honour of the house of Leverton. He had looked a fine manly fellow, too! There
was nothing of his father about him. He ought not to have done it, of course,
but did not the end justify the means? Whilst hardly as yet aware of the fact,
Leverton was making excuses for Grant. At any rate all his bitter feeling had
passed away. His mood was growing almost complacent when Lady Leverton and Mrs.
Cardella came back.</p>
<p>"I am quite myself now," the latter said. "Really. I don't know how to thank
you. I came down again even at this late hour to speak of Hubert Grant. I told
you that he was the victim of a conspiracy. The men who planned out the
conspiracy are my husband and Robert Morton. They set themselves out some time
ago deliberately to ruin the firm of Spencer and Grant. They found out
something about Mr. Spencer, and drove him away from England. At least they so
worked upon his feelings that he committed suicide. People say that he fell
over the cliff, but I don't believe it. He committed suicide because he could
not stand the persecution any longer. And he could not face his partner,
either. He had speculated till all his funds of the firm were exhausted."</p>
<p>"This is your opinion, Mrs. Cardella?" Sir Bruce asked.</p>
<p>"No. I have no opinions. But I have some vague knowledge of business
methods. It would be impossible to live in an atmosphere like mine for some
time without learning something. I believe that I am quite an authority on the
shady side of finance. I used to listen. I had my own reasons for doing so. But
how I came to marry my husband, and how I am going to punish him for his black
treachery to me will not interest you. It is no story for a happy household
like this. But I listened! I used to listen at nights when my husband and
Robert Morton were planning their schemes in the smoking room. If necessary, I
could go into the witness-box and tell a story that would cause the magistrates
to dismiss Hubert Grant on the spot. He is as innocent as his partner Philip
Scarsdale."</p>
<p>"But why should this thing be done?" Leverton asked. "Oh, I can even tell
you that. Cardella and his accomplice were after some big concession. They
expected to make millions out of it. But they could not work till the firm of
Spencer and Grant was down. Even then it became necessary to get Grant out of
the way. If they could put him in gaol even for a little time the plot was to
be successful. And Hubert Grant knew this. He knew that if he could carry on a
little longer he could raise money on the concession and pay the debts of the
firm. It was a race between the two, with odds on Cardella and his companion in
crime. I ought to know all this, for I have heard it discussed times
enough."</p>
<p>Leverton paced up and down the room listening intently to the story.</p>
<p>"A most remarkable state of things," he said. "It becomes quite plain to me
that I have greatly misjudged Mr. Grant. Perhaps I am prejudiced&mdash;but that
is an old story. Something must be done."</p>
<p>"Something is being done," Mrs. Cardella replied. "The matter is in very
capable hands, Sir Bruce. There is a man who calls himself John Smith. He is
eccentric, and it is his pose to look like the typical middle-aged idiot of the
stage. He has a mania for stage plays which he cannot write. But he has a fine
eye for a situation, and he knows how to adopt it. He works out what he calls
living dramas with real characters, and he is engaged on this particular case.
He is a rich man, too, so that he has no need to worry about funds."</p>
<p>"I should very much like to see your friend," Leverton smiled.</p>
<p>"Oh, I hope you will before long. He has mentioned your name to me. He knows
your daughter, and he has a very high opinion of Hubert Grant. He was the best
friend I ever had. I was struggling hard for a living when we first met. He
picked me out from a poor travelling company, and he gave me a chance. And now,
as I am very tired&mdash;"</p>
<p>"A thousand pardons." Sir Bruce murmured. "Your story is so interesting that
I am forgetting all my good manners. I hope you will have a good night. And if
there is anything I can do for you in the morning I shall be most happy."</p>
<p>Sir Bruce was alone at length. The house was quiet now, and all the servants
had retired. As a rule Leverton kept early hours, but not to-night. The crowded
events of the evening had left him restless and eager. The idea of sleep was
utterly out of the question. He paced up and down the room trying to piece the
scattered bits of the puzzle together. It was borne in upon him presently that
somebody was tapping on the window. A grim smile crowned his face. Here was
some further complication, of course. Possibly Cardella had come looking for
his wife. In that case&mdash;</p>
<p>But Leverton was mistaken. He threw open the window, and the light fell upon
the troubled anxious face of Philip Scarsdale. The latter appeared to have
something heavy on his mind.</p>
<p>"I've had a lot of trouble Leverton," he said. "Of course, you have heard
all about the unfortunate business of my firm. Everybody has done so by this
time. If I get out of the mess without the loss of my good name I shall be a
fortunate man. That is why I did not come and dine with you this evening. I
sent my wife instead, and with her Robert Morton was to have come, or at least
I was under the impression&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know all about that," Leverton smiled. "You might have come all the
same."</p>
<p>"Really I couldn't. I had a telegram from a man asking me to see him on the
most urgent business connected with the affairs of my firm. He came to my house
this evening after Ellen had gone. A most amazing little man called John Smith.
He says that he is going to set everything right. And certainly he is no fool,
though he does his best to give one that impression. But all this is by the
way. I thought I had as much trouble and misery as any man could carry, but it
seems that I was wrong. When my wife got back she made a confession to me that
filled me with dismay. I am alluding to her extraordinary folly in allowing
herself to be made the tool of Hubert Grant. I never dreamt that Grant could be
guilty of such a glaring breach of good taste. If he had come back with my wife
to-night I should have done him a mischief."</p>
<p>"Not if you had known everything," Leverton said gently.</p>
<p>Scarsdale gazed open-mouthed at the speaker.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon," he stammered. "Do I understand that you approve
of Mr. Grant's conduct?"</p>
<p>"Sounds amazing, doesn't it?" Leverton smiled. "Now you would not believe
that an action of that kind could be justified. But it was, and I am under the
deepest debt of gratitude to Grant. I cannot for certain reasons give you all
the facts of the case, but Grant has done me a service to-night that I could
not possibly repay him in the course of a lifetime. If I stripped myself of all
I possess, the debt would still be against me. And he could see no other way.
He worked the matter out skillfully and executed it with a wonderful boldness
and dash. But for him I should have received a blow from which I should have
never recovered. And it was a happy weakness on your wife's part that gave
Grant the chance he needed. If you come to apologise for all this&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear fellow, I am here at this unearthly hour partly for that purpose.
But go on&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Really there is little more to say. I nave misjudged Grant. I have learnt
to-night that he is the victim of a conspiracy between Cardella and Robert
Morton&mdash;the very man who was to have been my guest to-night. Mrs. Cardella
at the present moment is under my roof. I have been listening to a very strange
story from her. If we can keep Grant safe between us for another day or two the
situation will be saved. The whole thing reads like some exciting romance."</p>
<p>"That is exactly what it is," Scarsdale said. "I am taking a hand, too.
There is a great deal more here than meets the eye. Just before I said
good-night to my wife and started to walk here I got this telegram, by special
messenger from Fairford. It is most mysterious. It is unexpected, too, and I
don't quite know whether I had better ignore it or not."</p>
<p>Scarsdale produced the message from his pocket. He handed it over to
Leverton. There was only a few words on it, but they did not err on the side of
ambiguity.</p>
<p>Go into Fairford at once (it said) and call at 17, John-street. Ask to see
Clarkson, and tell him that everything is ready. Bring the parcel to Ledge
Point.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;17 John-street.</h2>
<p>"Now, what on earth do you make of that?" Leverton asked.</p>
<p>"I don't make anything out of it," said Scarsdale. "It looks to me like the
word of my eccentric friend John Smith. It is just his jerky way of doing
things. He loves mysteries as a conjuror loves them. He wants to puzzle you all
the time and be in the secret himself. That is what he calls dramatic effect.
When he left me comparatively early this evening he said that perhaps he would
send me a telegram very late this evening. That has obviously been despatched
per telephone. You can't telegraph from Fairford late at night, but they take
in messages and you have to pay extra for delivery."</p>
<p>"I see," Leverton said, thoughtfully. "And you can make nothing whatever out
of this?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely nothing&mdash;except the name of Clarkson. We had a man called
Clarkson in our firm for some years. He was a clever man who took to drink, and
we had to discharge him. For some time past now he has been getting a
precarious living by using our private information."</p>
<p>"Um!&mdash;just the kind of man that Cardella and Morton would like to get
hold of."</p>
<p>"By Jove! I never thought of that." Scarsdale exclaimed. "This is evidently
the Clarkson that the mystic telegram alludes to. I think, on the whole, I had
better go. I don't like the address much."</p>
<p>Sir Bruce was of the same opinion. Fairford was by the way of being
something of a port and down by the side of the docks were streets with a very
queer reputation. It would be obviously out of the question to seek the
assistance of the police and for a moment Scarsdale hesitated. He wished with
all his heart that his friend John Smith had been a little more explicit. But
here might be a matter on which his future happiness&mdash;perhaps his whole
reputation rested.</p>
<p>"I think I'll go," he said. "I am in no mood for sleep, and an adventure
with a spice of danger in it would be a fine tonic. So, if you don't mind, I'll
get along, Leverton."</p>
<p>"Stop a minute," Leverton cried. "I don't feel a bit more inclined to sleep
than you do. Two heads are better than one in a case of this sort, and
therefore I'll come with you. But not dressed as we are. It would never do to
go prowling about in the streets of Fairford in evening kit. Come up with me to
my dressing-room and I'll rig you out with some of my old duck shooting tweeds
and a cap. If we tie a handkerchief round our necks and leave off collars we
shall look the part all right. Wonderful how different a man looks when he
leaves off his collar."</p>
<p>The change was made presently, and Scarsdale and Leverton regarded each
other with mutual satisfaction. An artistic touch or two with a little dust and
the disguise was complete.</p>
<p>"I fancy we shall do," Leverton said. "We might be two tramps out of work.
At any rate, both of us have a pretty good idea of taking care of ourselves.
Now come along."</p>
<p>It was a fairly long tramp into Fairford, and by the time the town was
reached it was past 1 o'clock. They made their way in the direction of the
docks, and presently by the light of a street lump they made out the name of
the street they had come in search of. It was by no means an inviting-looking
place, narrow and dark, open to the water on one side. Most of the houses had
lights in them, and the great majority appeared to be let as common lodgings,
for every other window had a card to the effect that good beds could be had
there. No. 17 was about the middle of the street, the door was wide open, and a
feeble gas jet flared in the passage.</p>
<p>"Shall we knock or walk in?" Leverton asked.</p>
<p>"I don't quite know what the etiquette is," Scarsdale said, drily. "I don't
suppose the class of people who sleep in a house like this trouble to knock
much. We'll chance it and walk in."</p>
<p>At the end of the passage a fat greasy woman with a terribly black eye
awaited them. The atmosphere was impregnated by a strong odour of gin. The
place was stifling to a degree. The woman stood blocking the passage, her hands
on her hips, and a suspicious gleam in the bleary eye.</p>
<p>"Now, then, my lads," she said, "is it a doss or a sleep by the kitchen
fire?"</p>
<p>Scarsdale hesitated for a moment. He had to guess at the meaning of this
cryptic sentence. He rightly judged the woman to ask whether or not they
required a bed or merely to pass an hour or two by the kitchen fire till they
were ready to go further.</p>
<p>"Snooze by the fire," Scarsdale said roughly. "We're looking for a mate,
mother."</p>
<p>The woman nodded and held out her hand. Into it Leverton put a shilling,
with an intimation that she might keep the change. She led the way into the
kitchen, and vanished, only to re-appear presently with two pots of muddy
looking ale. Then she winked and presently took herself off. The long, low
kitchen, with the black ceiling, reeked abominably of stale humanity, but it
was empty for the moment, and for this the adventurers were grateful.</p>
<p>"Heavens&mdash;to think that people can live in a place like this," Leverton
gasped. "You'll find a pipe and some pretty strong tobacco in that coat of
yours. I'm glad I brought mine. Pour some of the beer through that hole in the
floor there, and they'll imagine that we have drunk it."</p>
<p>They sat and smoked for some time in silence. The closeness of the place
brought the free play of sweat out on their faces, so that the dirt made little
channels down their cheeks, and gave them a semblance of the true nomadic air.
Scarsdale began to grow impatient at last.</p>
<p>"This is all very well," he said. "But like the farmer in the story, we
don't seem to be getting any further. I wonder if it would be safe to ask for
Clarkson or if we had better wait till some of the regular patrons of this
hotel come along."</p>
<p>"Better wait," Leverton said prudently. "Somebody's sure to come along
presently." Half an hour later and the room began to fill up. First came a
sturdy-looking beggar with a leg in a sling, and an arm strapped. He bore on
his breast an inscription to the effect that he was the victim of a recent
colliery accident. With a surly nod in the direction of the two figures by the
fire, he proceeded to remove the bandages and discard the placard. He stood up
sound in every limb as he took some slices of bacon from his pocket.</p>
<p>"If you don't want all the fire, give me a chance," he said. "I've got my
supper to cook."</p>
<p>He tossed the bacon on to a gridiron, and transferred it presently to a
small loaf of bread, which he cut up with the aid of a pocket knife. For drink
he produced a flask of gin, which he drank out of the bottle. After that he
displayed a packet of cigarettes that Scarsdale's experienced eye recognised as
the finest Egyptians.</p>
<p>"Never had such a day," he grumbled. "Nothing but coppers, except a shilling
from a soft little bit of a girl outside the theatre. Haven't taken eight bob
all day."</p>
<p>"Things are getting worse and worse," Leverton said feelingly. "It isn't
eight bob you'd be getting if I had my way."</p>
<p>The beggar cocked an eye suspiciously, but said nothing. By this time the
kitchen was beginning to fill up. There were women as well as men, and, if
possible, their language was worse of the two. Scarsdale laid a warning hand
upon Leverton's arm.</p>
<p>"The telegram is all right," he whispered. "There's Clarkson by the
door&mdash;the man with the seedy frock suit and the red nose. I don't suppose
he will recognise me for a moment, but we shall have to be careful. Let's get a
little nearer and see if we can hear what he is saying."</p>
<p>Clarkson was sitting there nervously talking to some equally broken down
specimen of humanity, and sharing a pot of muddy beer with him. It was not
difficult to follow his conversation.</p>
<p>"Boy, there's money in it," the other man was saying. "Don't tell me you
don't know who he is."</p>
<p>"Have I ever said anything of the sort?" Clarkson said sulkily. "There may
be money in it. Lord, send there is, for I want it badly enough. I've been
served something shameful, Arthur. But I've got my eye upon them. It's all very
well for Cardella and Morton&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Here, stow that! You don't know who might be listening."</p>
<p>"Listening!" Clarkson sneered. "A lot of people here likely to be interested
in the doing of the great Julius Cardella, millionaire. But I can't make the
old man out at all. For the life of me I can't imagine what his game is. He
swears he hasn't got any money, but every morning he produces ten bob from
somewhere. I've searched the room. I've laid awake at night, but I can't find
out where he hides it. He dare not show up anywhere and so far he is in my
power. And I'll not deny that the few shillings I screw out of him every day
are useful."</p>
<p>"And you haven't got a notion who he really is, Charlie?"</p>
<p>"How should I?" Clarkson asked. "I don't know, and don't care, so long as he
keeps me going in beer and cigarettes. Besides, I share his rooms here, and
that is better than dossing with all the scum. Costs a bob a night that does,
but it's worth the money."</p>
<p>"Well, you go and draw a bob from him now," the other man suggested. "I've
got plenty of cigarettes, and I'll share with you if you'll touch old mother
Dutch downstairs for two quarts of beer. I've got a real perishing throat on me
to-night. Get along. Charlie."</p>
<p>Clarkson rose and went into the dingy passage. As he crept up the stairs,
Scarsdale and Leverton followed him. He did not appear to be in the least
suspicious until he paused with his hand on the knob of a door and the others
paused in their turn.</p>
<p>Scarsdale laid a hand upon his arm and he fairly started. He turned with a
snarl.</p>
<p>"Don't make a fuss," Scarsdale said. "I recognise you, Clarkson. I am Mr.
Scarsdale. If you open your mouth to raise an alarm I shall knock you down. So
this is the room of the millionaire who had the spending of half a sovereign
per-day. We should like to go inside." "You can't do it," Clarkson said
defiantly. "This is an outrage, sir. I don't even know the name of the
gentleman inside. He is a very good friend to me, and I ask no questions. If
you are going to force your way in I shall give the alarm. And there are half a
dozen fellows down there who only want the word said and&mdash;well, there's
been murder done here before now."</p>
<p>"Not to-night," Scarsdale said calmly. "Will you kindly open that door at
once or presently&mdash;"</p>
<p>A voice rose from the inside, a loud voice demanding to know who was
there.</p>
<p>Scarsdale's face changed to a look of blank amazement. Then he laughed
grimly.</p>
<p>"I never expected this," he said. "This is the crowning surprise of a most
amazing night. Open the door, Clarkson. The game is up, my good fellow."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;A Scrap of Paper.</h2>
<p>It was strange that the disappearance of Paul Spencer did not create the
sensation that it might have done. There were all the elements of a 'popular'
mystery, but as a matter of fact outside business circles there was very little
comment. Only the lynx eye of Scotland Yard was turned steadily that way. The
officials there had their own theory, of course, but as yet they had made
little progress.</p>
<p>They did not even know as much as Inspector Manley from Fairford, and his
discovery he had kept to himself up to a certain point. If he had any luck here
it might mean some big promotion. If he could only work it out, he had the clue
of the mystery. He was certain that the solution lay in that forged telegram.
But he could not say why any criminal should forge a telegram when it was so
easy to get a false message in an assumed name through the Post Office. Why had
the miscreant gone to all this apparently unnecessary trouble?</p>
<p>Manley puzzled over it till be came to the decision of taking Scotland Yard
into his confidence. He walked down there and asked to see one of the
inspectors, Mr. Townley was disengaged. He had been one of Manleys superior
officers years ago before ill-health had driven him from London into the
country. Townley received him cordially.</p>
<p>"Glad to see you again, Manley," he said. "Last time you were here you
looked like a ghost. We gave you about a year to live."</p>
<p>"And I have been five years in charge of Fairford now," Manley laughed. "I
was never more fit in my life. And that is why I am anxious to get back to
London again. I should like Lenon's job. If I could pull off something
clever&mdash;the Paul Spencer case for instance!"</p>
<p>"You might get it&mdash;yes. Queer case that. Something very wrong there.
Still, it's in your district and a real good chance for you. Do you know
anything?"</p>
<p>"Nothing really tangible," Manley replied. "But I have got a bit of
information which I have kept to myself so far. On the day of Spencer's death
he was greatly upset by the receipt of a telegram that took him to Fairford. To
all practical purposes he was never seen again. I have that telegram and it is
a forgery. It has never been through the Post Office."</p>
<p>"That's a funny thing," Townley said thoughtfully. "Now, what particular
object&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know you would say that. I quite agree with you. When I can find that out
I shall probably have the solution of the matter in my pocket. The telegram was
printed on the right paper with the right ink and despatched in the right
envelope. The forgery of the date stamp was an easier matter than the procuring
of Government paper and envelopes. Nobody sells envelopes such as telegrams are
put up in and nobody sells that class of paper. The average man could not steal
it out of a post office, because it is not in the department where the public
are admitted."</p>
<p>"An employee might have taken it?"</p>
<p>"He might, of course. But I don't think so. A criminal who would take all
this trouble over a forged telegram would hardly take a telegraph clerk&mdash;a
girl, mind&mdash;into his confidence. My logic is a bit fine drawn, but it
sounds natural."</p>
<p>"It certainly does," Townley admitted. "You think that the paper was stolen
from the makers."</p>
<p>"I do. Bank of England paper has been stolen before now. So has the paper
that postal orders are printed on. Post Office Savings Bank Books again. I
recollect when I was here years ago that one or two of our regular 'customers'
made a hobby of that kind of thing."</p>
<p>"They did. But it doesn't pay now," Townley said. "There are so many tests
that the game is hardly worth the candle. There may be a certain amount of it
amongst the betting fraternity. New tricks are constantly being played upon the
bookmakers."</p>
<p>"That's it." Manley cried. "That's exactly the class of man I'm after. Give
me the name and address of one and I'll make a start at once."</p>
<p>Townley rang his bell and a clerk appeared. He took certain instructions and
entered presently with a big volume and a packet of photographs. At the end of
half an hour Manley knew a great deal as to the career of certain criminals
connected with racecourses. In the course of the afternoon he found himself
seated in a dreary looking public-house off the Edgeware-road. He was eyed a
little askance by the questionable gang lounging against the counter, but a
word from the landlord reassured his customers. The landlord was just a little
uncomfortable himself, but he quite appreciated the wisdom of keeping in with
the police. He conveyed the general impression that Manley was a bookmaker who
deemed it prudent to lie low for the moment. At the end of an hour the man that
Manley was waiting for lounged in. He was fashionably dressed, he wore a
profusion of cheap jewellery, and his shiny hat was on one side. Apparently he
was enjoying one of his rare bursts of financial prosperity.</p>
<p>"Anybody here been to see me?" he asked.</p>
<p>The landlord jerked his thumb in the direction of Manley and winked. The new
comer turned pale. He did not altogether approve of the look of Manley.
Nevertheless he swaggered across the room with his cigar cocked at a knowing
angle and addressed Manley with insolent familiarity. The other bar loungers
absorbed in 'sport' were not interested.</p>
<p>Manley fixed his man with a cold eye.</p>
<p>"Sit down, my lad," he said. "Sit down and order what you please. I am not
after you this time, so you can make yourself at home."</p>
<p>"And who the blazes may you be?" the flashy man demanded.</p>
<p>"My name is Manley. I am connected with the police. But you have already
guessed that or I am greatly mistaken. I was at Scotland Yard when you and
'Rat' Kelly and Red Logan were picked up over the robbery of that bank paper.
In fact I arrested Kelly myself. You got out of that very well. You might just
us well have had 10 years, Charlie."</p>
<p>Charlie Corner nodded amiably. He was accustomed to be talked to in this
way. He was an unscrupulous ruffian and not at all nice in his methods, but he
respected the law and cringed before it.</p>
<p>"That's right, sir," he said. "I remember you now. I thought I knew your
face. Gave me a regular turn directly I entered the bar. What can I do for you,
sir?"</p>
<p>"Well, you can answer a few questions and answer them truthfully. I am
looking for a man who secretly has been purchasing Bank paper. Have you got
any?"</p>
<p>"No, I haven't&mdash;too dangerous a game. Besides, it isn't much use
nowadays. I knew a man who had some Bank of England papers for years. He
offered to sell the whole lot for a fiver and couldn't get that. So he put it
on the fire. I've chucked it, too."</p>
<p>"Um!" Manley said, dubiously. "Well, I'll take your word for it. But it
isn't bank paper I am after so much as the stuff that telegrams are printed
on&mdash;envelopes and the like. That's a game that pays anyhow, especially if
you can hit upon some new scheme for swindling a bookmaker. We know all about
altering the time on a telegram, but what looks like a bona-fide telegram on
bona-fide paper&mdash;"</p>
<p>Mr. Corner gasped. He favoured Manley with a look of intense admiration. It
was a suggestion entirely after his own heart, and afforded him inspiration for
a purely new swindle. He would not have felt quite so easy had he known that
Manley was reading him like an open book.</p>
<p>"I have heard of something of the kind being done," he said. "Of course, the
paper can be got."</p>
<p>"Well, take that for granted," Manley said sharply. "Can you give me the
name of a man who has some? It's long odds that there is only one man in
London. There generally is only one man who supplies the funds for these sorts
of schemes. I don't want to do him any harm; I want to warn him and get him to
give up his supply. He won't give it me all, of course, but I have to chance
that. Give me his address and if it is at all right I'll send you five
pounds."</p>
<p>Corner was ready to produce the address without the slightest hesitation. He
was not the kind of man to uphold the tradition that there is honour amongst
thieves. He would have been one of the first of his profession, scornfully to
repudiate the suggestion.</p>
<p>"All right," he said. "I'll write the address down for you. Of course, you
won't give me away, mister. It would be as much as my life was worth. Still,
they are over at Croydon and not at all likely to come across me. East Croydon
it is and thank you."</p>
<p>A little later, and Manley was at Croydon. He was not in the least surprised
to find himself in a good-class stationer's shop with an excellent stock more
or less up-to-date. But there was a good deal of dust about and a conspicuous
absence of assistants for so large an establishment. A slim girl came forward
to serve the customer.</p>
<p>"Have you been here very long," he asked. "What has become of Mr.&mdash;I
forget his name."</p>
<p>"I have only been here a few weeks," the slim assistant said. "Mrs. Kerr
bought the business a year or so ago. No&mdash;there is not much doing. We are
cut about by that big co-operative chemist and bookseller on the other side of
the road. I am afraid that Mrs. Kerr will lose her money. We cannot compete
with those cutting co-operative prices."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Kerr&mdash;Mrs. Kerr!" Manley said, thoughtfully. "I fancy I know her.
I used to be in the trade myself. Could I possibly speak to her for a
moment?"</p>
<p>There was no objection, and Mrs. Kerr came forward. Manley measured her with
his eye. He was just a little surprised to find a woman engaged in the
business. She stood there quiet and respectful enough, but with just a
suggestion of defiance on her face. The slim assistant was waiting upon a
customer who had come along in search of pocket-books.</p>
<p>"I am looking for some paper," Manley suggested.</p>
<p>"Notepaper, sir?" the shopkeeper asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; I have a good stock. Now let me see."</p>
<p>Obviously she knew little or nothing about her own shop. She stared about
her vaguely.</p>
<p>"It won't do. Mrs. Kerr," Manley said, pleasantly. "No use with me, you
understand. I am too old a hand at the game. You know the paper I'm after. I
want some of the paper that telegrams are sent out on and some envelopes to
match. Also a date stamp with movable figures. They tell me that this is the
only place round London where I can get it."</p>
<p>A queer little cry came from Mrs. Kerr's lips. She pressed her hand to her
side.</p>
<p>"I am more or less connected with Scotland Yard," Manley said. "It is not
the least use for you to protest, because I am absolutely certain of my ground.
Now I am not here to do any harm. If you will give all the information you
possess on a certain subject I will see that you don't suffer. If Scotland Yard
raid your premises in a week's time looking for illicit paper and find it,
don't say you have not been warned."</p>
<p>Mrs. Kerr capitulated at his discretion. A thin smile trembled on her
lips.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you, sir?" she asked. "I am quite certain that any
information I can give you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That's right. That's the spirit in which to take it. Now have you sold any
paper lately?"</p>
<p>"Not more than four sheets and as many envelopes the last eight months," the
woman protested. "An old gentleman came in the other day and asked for some
paper."</p>
<p>"But you don't part with your stock-in-trade to casual old gentlemen who
come and ask for it."</p>
<p>"Oh, well sir, he had an introduction. He said that Mr. Clarkson had told
him."</p>
<p>"And who may Mr. Clarkson be? Is he one of your regular customers?"</p>
<p>"He used to be at one time. I believe that he is a clerk or was a clerk in a
good position in the city. I like to know who I am dealing with. But Clarkson
has been drinking lately and I heard it said that Spencer, his employer, had
discharged him. He has been mixed up with horses and racing all his life. He
had a great scheme on&mdash;but I need not go into that."</p>
<p>"Quite right," said Manley cheerfully. "Don't let me pry into your secrets.
I dare say that this Mr. Clarkson has letters sent to him here. Yes, I thought
so. Where is he now?"</p>
<p>"At a place called Fairford. I send the letters on to a street there, but I
should say from the address that it is no better than a common lodging-house.
Here it is, see."</p>
<p>Manley whistled softly as he looked at the address. Mrs. Kerr's estimate had
not been very wide of the mark. And Manley registered a vow that before
nightfall, if possible, at any rate before daybreak, he would see Clarkson at
that address. He knew something of the man, too&mdash;he had not been in
Fairford all these years without hearing of Clarkson, who was confidential
clerk to Mr. Spencer, of Ledge Point. Clarkson, before his downfall had been
there for week-ends.</p>
<p>"I fancy that is about all I need," Manley said. "What was the old gentleman
like?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Kerr apparently had a good memory and a fair eye for detail. She gave
Manley a description of her customer that pleased him very much, in fact, the
more he thought it over the more pleased he was. He quitted the shop in a very
pleasant frame of mind.</p>
<p>"Good day," he said. "Remember my warning. A snug business like this will
pay you far better in the long run than, well, business of another kind."</p>
<p>With this benign expression of his good will Manley made his way back to the
station.</p>
<p>"It's a complicated business still," he told himself. "But I have had a real
lucky day, and unless things go very much against me I shall have the tangles
all out in a day or two. It was a real piece of good fortune stumbling up
against Clarkson in this way. I wonder if he really understands, or is he
merely a pawn in the game? If so, what is he doing at Fairford? And why?"</p>
<p>Manley chuckled to himself as he lighted a cigar.</p>
<p>"And why did Mr. Spencer take all that trouble? Why did he go out of his way
to forge a telegram and send the blessed thing to himself?"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;The Ghost Appears.</h2>
<p>Manley asked himself the question again and again. Why had Paul Spencer
taken all this trouble and why had he addressed that telegram to himself. There
was very little doubt that he had adopted such a course. He had discovered
where the paper was to be obtained from his disreputable clerk Clarkson, and
the rest had emanated from his disordered brain. More or less from the first,
Manley had suspected suicide here, and now he began to be pretty sure of it. If
he had known anything of the movements of the eccentric John Smith he might
have modified his views, but then no such person existed so far as he was
concerned.</p>
<p>Paul Spencer had thrown himself over the cliff in sight of his partner, and
the revolver shot that had so impressed Grant was a theatrical effect merely.
Spencer had put himself out of the way in such a manner as pointed to a violent
end. He had escaped the stigma of suicide. There are many madmen who take their
lives and yet are sane enough to desire a decent burial. Doubtless Paul Spencer
was one of them. To all practical purposes, then, Manley had solved the
mystery. Spencer had committed suicide. The suggestion that he had been
murdered was absurd. All the same there were one or two little points to be
cleared up before Manley laid the result of his investigations before Scotland
Yard. He had to sec Clarkson first. He could not imagine what the discharged
clerk was doing in Fairford. His presence there was more or less suspicious. He
might be up to some mischief. But the first thing was to prove beyond a doubt
that Spencer's mysterious telegram was a forgery. A visit to the post office at
Fairford would settle that question. Manley called there without delay.</p>
<p>The postmaster was quite definite in his statement. No such message had been
received on the day of Mr. Paul Spencer's death. It was open for Manley to
inspect the file if he liked. But Manley was satisfied. The assurance of the
Post master was good enough for him.</p>
<p>"I am much obliged to you," he said. "There is no need to trouble you any
further. This is more or less of a secret, so please say nothing about it."</p>
<p>It was very late before Manley made his next move. A good deal of work
needing urgent attention had presented itself in his absence. Clarkson could
wait. It was long past midnight before Manley found himself adjacent to the
Fairford docks. There had been a good deal of trouble in the case of a
Norwegian sailor, but that was satisfactorily arranged.</p>
<p>Manley walked into the common lodging house and asked for the landlady. She
came to him amiably enough. It was no part of her policy to quarrel with the
police. Mr. Manley was quite welcome to all the information that she could give
him. At the mention of Clarkson's name she looked puzzled. Evidently it
conveyed nothing to her.</p>
<p>"Haven't got anybody of that name here, sir," she said.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," Manley admitted. "At least not under that name. He's a man
about 40, seedy looking, and dressed in frock coat and silk hat. Like a
broken-down clerk."</p>
<p>All this was more or less guess work, but it served the purpose. The woman's
face cleared.</p>
<p>"I know him," she said. "Only he calls himself Dent. He's only been here two
days. He shares the same room with the foreign gentleman with the white
hair."</p>
<p>"Um. One of your aristocratic customers who has a private sitting and bed
room. What's he like?"</p>
<p>The woman didn't know. He was rather old, he had white hair, and the man
Dent had told her he was a foreigner who understood very little English. He
looked after his own room, indeed in a common lodging-house the cleaning out of
the rooms was a mere fiction. Manley listened with interest. He had made up his
mind to interview the white haired old gentleman who spoke very little English.
His experience told him that the presence of such a man close to the docks
frequently meant a fugitive escaping from justice. He asked a few more
questions about Clarkson and his ways and habits when he left the house.
Clarkson was not in, and he did not say that he was coming back again.</p>
<p>He met his man later on in the street outside the lodging-house. He was
quite sure that the seedy looking individual in the shabby frock coat was
Clarkson. He touched him on the shoulder. Clarkson started and cried out. The
man was horribly afraid of something.</p>
<p>"What do you want with me?" he swaggered. "And who are you, anyway?"</p>
<p>"Your name is Clarkson?" Manley asked. "Late in the employ of Spencer and
Grant?"</p>
<p>"Nothing of the kind," Clarkson said. "My name is Dent. I am a man of
private means."</p>
<p>"With a weakness for passing your time in common lodging-houses," Manley
said dryly. "Now I happen to be the chief of the Fairford police, and I warn
you if you persist in calling yourself Dent, I shall regard that as what
diplomatists call an 'unfriendly act,' and I will take measures accordingly. I
shall be compelled to ask you to accompany me to the police station. But if you
tell me freely that you are Clarkson I can make it easy for you. I won't even
say anything about your friend, Mrs. Kerr, of East Croydon. Now are yon going
to be sensible?"</p>
<p>Clarkson suddenly decided that he was.</p>
<p>Manley carried too many guns for him altogether.</p>
<p>"I don't mind admitting that I'm down on my luck," he said. "My own fault,
perhaps. Too much drinking and betting. But I was a good servant to the firm
for many years. What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"For the present, nothing," Manley said. "Go as far as the police station
and wait for me. I've got a good many questions to ask you in relation to that
stationer's shop in East Croydon. If I am not back at the end of half an hour,
return and meet me at your lodgings. No, I don't want you to go back for
anything; I want you to get down to the police station as soon as
possible."</p>
<p>Clarkson shuffled off more or less uncomfortably. He was very disturbed and
uneasy in his mind. He mistrusted all this sudden friendliness on the part of
the police. It did not occur to him that Manley had contrived all this with the
intention of getting an interview with the white haired old gentleman who had
so poor a knowledge of the English language. Manley called for the landlady
again and made his meaning quite clear. He wanted to know where the elderly
gentleman was to be found and as to the rest he could interview him
himself.</p>
<p>He knocked at the door of the room twice before any reply came. Somebody was
shifting about inside, somebody who was trying to fasten the door. Manley was
just a little too quick for that. He pushed his way into the bedroom. There
were a few sticks of furniture; a chair or two, and a couple of
uninviting-looking beds against the wall. The lavatory arrangements were
primitive; a cracked piece of looking-glass was nailed up over the fireplace.
It was not luxurious, but as much as the ordinary man could expect for sixpence
per night.</p>
<p>A slender white man with a mass of white hair and eyes hidden by big
spectacles stood before Manley. He seemed to be horribly frightened, for he was
trembling from head to foot. For a man who could afford nothing better in the
way of lodging than this he was remarkably well dressed. His boots were good,
and across his waistcoat was a gold chain. He made some poor show of
indignation.</p>
<p>"Not a bit of use," Manley said. "Unless I am greatly mistaken you know me.
I am pretty sure you recognised me by the aid of that miserable lamp of yours.
And you understand every word that I say, though you pretend to know no
English. Take that wig off!"</p>
<p>"This is an outrage!" the stranger protested in English as good as Manley's
own. "It is no business of yours that I prefer to live in a place like
this."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, it is," Manley said, coldly. "I am the head of the police here.
You are obviously in disguise and in hiding; moreover, you have taken up your
temporary abode somewhere near the docks! That is just what a man would do who
was trying to escape from justice. I should be lacking in my duty if I did not
interfere. I may be wrong, of course, and if so, I shall be happy to
apologise."</p>
<p>The stranger protested again. He discarded his angry manner, he became
affecting. Manley dropped into one of the chairs and watched him. On the whole
he was enjoying himself. Something like half an hour passed, then there was the
sound of somebody coming up the stairs. The door burst open, and Clarkson came
in closely followed by Sir Bruce Leverton and Philip Scarsdale.</p>
<p>"Ah, I thought so," Scarsdale exclaimed. "I could have sworn that&mdash;but
who is this. I begin to be afraid that we have made some mistake, after all.
Oh, Manley, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"I am probably here on the same errand as yourself, sir," Manley said. "I am
investigating into the matter of the disappearance of Mr. Spencer, and that has
led me to this house. I was just having a most interesting argument with this
gentleman when you came in. It was he who called out to you. I want his
assistance, and I am sanguine that I shall have it."</p>
<p>Manley spoke with one eye on Clarkson who had dropped discontentedly on one
of the chairs.</p>
<p>"It's all up," he said, with a grin. "It's all up; you may as well admit
it."</p>
<p>"Really. I fancy that our friend is right," Manley said cheerfully. "All the
same, it is impossible to settle the affair here. We had better have a cab and
go as far as Ledge Point."</p>
<p>The stranger in the white hair broke out furiously. As he grew calmer he
snatched his wig from his head and dashed it on to the floor. The big
spectacles followed.</p>
<p>Scarsdale cried in astonishment. "Spencer!" he said. "Paul Spencer! Now,
what is the meaning of this? We all thought&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't you think that we had better go as far as Ledge Point first," Manley
suggested. "This in no place for a long explanation. Besides, there are so many
things to be settled."</p>
<p>Scarsdale suddenly thought of his telegram. He had been asked to go to Ledge
Point that night. Doubtless there was some urgent reason for the message. "I
should prefer it," he said. "I don't suppose that Mr. Spencer has any
objection?"</p>
<p>Spencer said nothing. He appeared to have resigned himself to the
inevitable. They drove in silence as far as Ledge Point and Manley rang the
bell. He rang it again before the frightened face of Jenner looked out into the
garden. Then Jenner gave a loud yell and dropped into a chair. His teeth were
chattering with abject terror.</p>
<p>"Mr. Spencer!" he stammered. "It's either the master come back or his
ghost!"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;Light.</h2>
<p>Jenner stood there shaking and quivering, his eyes dilated with terror.
There was something about him that suggested guilt. He pulled himself together
presently and made some effort at happiness at the sight of his master. But it
was all wasted so far as Paul Spencer was concerned. He moved like a man in a
dream, he was taking not the slightest interest in the proceedings. It was
questionable as to whether he was aware of the fact that he was in his own
house.</p>
<p>"That will do," Scarsdale said. "We will hear what you have to say
presently. Meanwhile is there anybody in the house besides yourself? I have
good reasons for asking."</p>
<p>Jenner appeared puzzled, as if he did not quite understand the question. He
was gaining time; he strained his ears to catch any sound that might come from
the cellar.</p>
<p>"There are the maidservants, sir," he said respectfully. "As a rule you see,
sir&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Is there anybody in the house?" Scarsdale thundered. "You are found out, my
friend: it is no use for you to profess this innocence. Are there any visitors
here?"</p>
<p>Smith came forward, bland and mincing as usual. This was the moment of his
triumph. To look at him, stout, florid, with the glass in his eye it was hard
to realise that his brain had devised the whole thing. The fat little man was
the hero of the hour.</p>
<p>"Let me answer the question for you," he said. "I am John Smith&mdash;of
London. You may have heard of me."</p>
<p>"I think I have had that honour," Scarsdale smiled. "Very good, sir. In that
case we can get on. I have taken a great interest in this business, in fact I
began to take an interest in it before Mr. Spencer vanished. I may go further
and say that indirectly I am the cause of that mysterious disappearance. I
shall have a good deal to say about it presently&mdash;in fact, the explanation
of the whole story rests with me. But I cannot do myself justice unless I have
a proper and complete audience. Jenner, produce the rest of the audience."</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," said the bewildered Jenner. "I don't quite follow
you, sir."</p>
<p>"I said produce the rest of the audience. Partly owing to my endeavours and
partly owing to a series of favourable circumstances, everybody interested in
the fortunes of Spencer and Grant, and the fortunes of Mr. Grant and the lady
he is going to marry are here. Fetch the other two."</p>
<p>"If you would only speak a little more plainly, sir," Jenner stammered.</p>
<p>"Surely my words are plain enough," Smith said gaily. "I want the other two.
I need the gentlemen who are at the present moment in the cellar. It is a
strange place to receive your guests, Jenner, but then there is no accounting
for tastes. Bring Mr. Cardella and Mr. Morton from the cellar."</p>
<p>The fit of terror was on Jenner again. He was wondering where the little man
got his knowledge from. He shuffled off presently in the direction of the
basement.</p>
<p>"It's not in the least wonderful," Smith said with a smile. "Mr. Grant and
myself have been here quite a long time. I knew that Cardella would have to
come here. I had to take the chance of his coming to-night, but my calculations
were quite correct. That is why I sent you that telegram, Mr. Scarsdale, I hope
you did not seem it a liberty."</p>
<p>"Not at all," Scarsdale murmured. "On the contrary, I owe you something for
sending it."</p>
<p>Hubert Grant advanced towards Leverton, and made a motion as if to hold out
his hand.</p>
<p>"Let me apologise, too," he said. "I don't suppose you will ever forgive me
for my conduct to-night, Sir Bruce, but I had to behave in the way I did. It
may sound cheap and theatrical to say that the happiness of three people
depended upon it, but that is no more than the actual truth. Unfortunately for
myself I shall never be able to say more than this. If you think that you
can&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I have already done so," Leverton interrupted, "I know exactly what I have
to thank you for. But don't let us say anything more about it for the present.
This is not the time nor place. So long as we are in the presence of your
unfortunate partner, Mr. Spencer&mdash;"</p>
<p>Sir Bruce concluded with a lowering of his voice and shrug of his
shoulders.</p>
<p>Hubert was too amazed to reply for a moment. Leverton knew
everything&mdash;he could not have spoken like that otherwise. He must have
learnt the whole of the bitter truth in some way after Grant had left Grant
Lea. The way in which he alluded to Spencer proved that. And he was right, too.
This was no time and place to discuss the reasons that had taken Grant to Grant
Lea that evening. There were other and different matters to discuss first.</p>
<p>Jenner was coming with his guests. Morton approached with his head in the
air and an uneasy swagger. Cardella looked more dangerous. His dark eyes
gleamed, his hands were clenched.</p>
<p>"What does all this mean?" Smith asked, "Gentlemen, explain yourselves."</p>
<p>"I'll have an explanation with you presently," Cardella said meaningly. "We
came here in search of certain information. It is not perhaps quite regular,
but the matter was pressing. Jenner allowed us to search for what we wanted in
the cellar. We have not found it. Good night, gentlemen."</p>
<p>"Very weak," Smith said with a critical head on one side. "Not what one
expects from the chief villain of the piece. We cannot let it pass at
that."</p>
<p>"Stand aside," Cardella said threateningly. "We have no further business,
here. Do you hear what I say? You are not going to try and detain us."</p>
<p>"I have no right to do so," Smith smiled. "Nor has Mr. Grant, nor Sir Bruce
Leverton, nor Mr. Scarsdale. But there is a gentleman there who can do so if he
pleases. Mr. Cardella, Mr. Morton. Let me introduce you to Inspector Manley,
head of the Fairford police."</p>
<p>Cardella started uneasily. All Morton's swagger dropped away from him.</p>
<p>"That is so," Manley said. "I'm afraid I must ask you for something more
satisfactory. I find you here in the dead of the night hunting amongst Mr.
Spencer's effects. The mere fact that Jenner admitted you and is part of the
conspiracy does not make matters any better."</p>
<p>"It looks unfortunate," Cardella admitted. "But as we have taken nothing
away&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Because you could not find it," Smith interrupted. "You are guilty of
burglary. You are guilty of breaking open a case, for I saw the thing done. Mr.
Grant and myself have been in the house as long as you have. We have seen and
heard everything."</p>
<p>"It's a lie," Cardella muttered. "You have just come in with the
others."</p>
<p>"Really! Jenner, go down to the cellar and bring up the case of Tokay. I
mean the box that at one time contained Tokay. These friends of yours have
deceived you. There is no wine in the case, it is true, but it contains
something of still greater value. I am going to prove to Mr. Cardella that I
have been in this house since he arrived himself."</p>
<p>Something like an oath broke from Cardella's lips. It was impossible to
fight the thing any further. He nodded sullenly as Jenner looked to him for
instructions. The servant disappeared only to return a little later on with the
box in his arms and a chisel.</p>
<p>"Now open that," Smith commanded. "It doesn't matter about police seals so
long as we have Mr. Manley in the house. Break it open and take out the
bottles...There! Now, Mr. Manley will you take those papers from the bottles
and let Mr. Grant examine them. He has more than a faint idea as to what they
are, because the case has been opened in his sight once before this
evening."</p>
<p>The papers were duly handed round. Hubert's eyes dilated. Here was
practically all the missing wealth of the firm of Spencer and Grant. There was
enough here to pay every creditor and set the firm up on its legs again.</p>
<p>Grant looked at Spencer for an explanation. He seemed to comprehend dully
what was wanted of him. His full measure of intelligence was returning.</p>
<p>"Presently," he muttered, "presently I'll tell you everything, when those
rascals have gone."</p>
<p>He lapsed into moody indifference again. No doubt an explanation of this
amazing conduct would be forthcoming all in good time. Smith was the first to
speak.</p>
<p>"This is one of the best situations in the play," he said. "Here we have the
hero restored to his fortune again, and the very men who have done it are those
who tried to do him the most harm. That is a fine instance of what man calls
'poetical justice.' After what has happened, there will not be much chance of
Mr. Cardella getting the Quogga concession."</p>
<p>"I owe you this," Cardella said furiously. "But for you...And you came into
my house as a guest. You drugged me in my own dining-room, you stole my keys
and burgled my safe. And you are acting now as if you were proud of it. Proud
of it!"</p>
<p>"So I am!" Smith said genially. "On the whole I should say that this was the
proudest moment of my life. This is the finest play I ever constructed, and it
has worked out without a hitch. Every character has dropped into his place
naturally, he has required very little prompting, either. And the best of it is
that you are powerless to do any further harm. After what I have said and in
view of the papers that I have obtained from your safe, I can compel you to
leave England. If you came to stand in the dock with your confidant Clarkson it
is just possible&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That will do," Cardella said. "It's no use going on, Morton. If these
people prosecute&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am not going to prosecute," Spencer said suddenly, "I am going to do
nothing."</p>
<p>Smith nodded approvingly. The whole thing was working out as it should.
Spencer was not going to prosecute. A story of a sort would have to be told,
but on the other hand Cardella had lost everything. There was going to be a
resounding smash, so far as he was concerned, in a few days.</p>
<p>"In that case there is no occasion for us to remain," he said.</p>
<p>"Precisely," Smith replied. "You are very fortunate, and I make no apologies
for the way in which I have treated you. Nor need I have any anxiety as to your
future. You will get on wherever you are, though I need not suggest that your
future career will not trouble London very much. I take it that you understand
my meaning."</p>
<p>Cardella nodded sulkily as he left the house, followed by Morton. Smith
turned upon the trembling Jenner and ordered him to bed.</p>
<p>"We shall not need you any further," he said. "I have no doubt Mr. Spencer
will know how to deal with you in the morning. I am very sorry, gentlemen, to
monopolise the whole stage in this way, but you see that it has been more or
less necessary. You can see for yourselves how matters have gone. When I knew
that Mr. Spencer had sent that bogus telegram to himself&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But how did you know that, sir?" Manley asked. "I flattered myself that
that was my discovery. I found out where Mr. Spencer got his paper from. I have
the name of the woman who supplied it."</p>
<p>"Yes, but the original idea was mine," Smith smiled. "Mr. Spencer consulted
me in the first place. I could see that he was depressed and out of sorts. He
acted like a man on the verge of ruin. He asked me to dine with him, he
discussed plots and plays with me. It was a most interesting discussion. He put
a case to me of a man who wanted to get away from his creditors, to disappear
in such a manner as to suggest that he had either been murdered or had
committed suicide. I don't mind confessing that the thing took a firm hold on
me. I began to see my way clear. I came down here, I saw how an 'accident'
could be arranged on the edge of the cliff and how the unfortunate could slip
away afterwards leaving no trace behind. I worked out that telegram business. I
had more or less forgotten the thing when I heard that Mr. Spencer had been
killed. He had fallen over the cliff, he had been shot, he had had a mysterious
and disturbing telegram. And then in a flash I realised that Mr. Spencer was
not dead at all. He had merely put my scheme into practice. At first I looked
upon it as a joke, but it was no laughing matter. I realised that when I saw
what the thing meant to Mr. Grant and a certain young lady who shall be
nameless. I was more or less responsible for what had happened, and it was my
bounden duty to set it right. One must always have a certain amount of luck in
these matters. My luck existed in the fact that I knew Mrs. Cardella
intimately. When I found that her husband was at the bottom of the whole
business I knew exactly what to do. And I have enjoyed it. I enjoyed the way in
which I puzzled Mr. Grant on the night of Mr. Spencer's death. I enjoyed
fooling Morton and Cardella. I actually made the latter reply to Sir Bruce here
on the telephone exactly what I had to say. All the time I have controlled
everything and made things go as I wished. If there are any more questions you
would like to ask me shall be pleased to answer them."</p>
<p>But Smith's explanation seemed quite complete. The main interest now lay
with Spencer. Why had he done this thing? Why had he given way when his firm
was quite solvent? And why did he want to make it appear as if he were
dead?</p>
<p>"The whole thing becomes perfectly plain," Scarsdale said thoughtfully. "We
shall begin to realise later on what a deep debt of gratitude we owe to Mr.
Smith. He has saved our good name and our happiness. But surely Mr. Spencer has
something to say."</p>
<p>Spencer appeared to be struggling to arouse himself from a fit of apathy. He
passed his hand over his forehead with the air of a man who is in brain
worry.</p>
<p>"I am very tired," he said. "I am so tired that I can hardly keep my eyes
open. I shall be greatly obliged if you will wait till the morning. I don't
think that my story will be found to be very much less interesting than that of
Mr. Smith. But I can't tell it you to-night. We shall all of us be better for a
good night's rest."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.&mdash;The Reason Why.</h2>
<p>The city of London had two sensations ready for consumption on the Monday.
To begin with the great house of Cardella was done, and it became known in the
course of the day that there would be nothing for the creditors. Cardella
himself was nowhere to be found, it was understood that he had already started
for South America on important business.</p>
<p>The offices were closed; already creditors were in possession in Park Lane.
They had also raided his other residences.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cardella had had a quarrel with her husband and was going back to the
stage. She had the sympathy of everybody. But she was not going to remain in
England; she was not going to stay in London till people had had a chance to
forget. She had closed with a tempting offer from America and was to sail
without delay.</p>
<p>The story of the Quogga concession began to spread. Late on Monday
afternoon, the warrant for Grant's arrest was withdrawn, and Hubert was back at
the office again. By night fall everybody who was interested in such matters
knew the story of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>On Tuesday it was common knowledge that Paul Spencer was at home again. The
man had been frightened to death by Cardella, and he had vanished, leaving
people under the impression that he had been murdered. He had been half mad
with terror, he had taken a fortune along with him, and the fortune was now
back in the business again.</p>
<p>Confidence in the firm of Spencer and Grant was returning. On every side
Hubert was receiving sympathy. Before the end of the week everything was going
on quite smoothly. But Spencer did not appear, it was understood that the City
of London would see him no more. Something had happened to his brain, he had
had a nervous breakdown, and he was going to live in the South of France for
the future. It was a sensation for a day or two, and then it was forgotten for
something else. The truth was known only to Scarsdale and Grant. The former
came over to Ledge Point early the next day and met Grant there. It was perhaps
prudent for Hubert to remain at home until his solicitors could satisfy the
prosecutor that nothing was to be gained by the execution of the warrant.</p>
<p>Spencer joined the others after breakfast, looking terribly ill and worn. He
had become an old man all at once. His eyes looked tired and weary.</p>
<p>"You are going to tell us all about it?" Scarsdale suggested.</p>
<p>"After all, there is very little to tell," Spencer said. "My nerves gave
way. I got thinking and thinking over the plot that Smith suggested to me until
I felt that I was bound to carry it out. My first step was to forge that
telegram. I got the paper through Clarkson. I had a hold on Clarkson and I had
a pretty shrewd idea that he knew all there was to be known on the subject of
telegraphic frauds. At any rate, I got the paper and forged the telegram. To
disappear was easy. I wanted a witness and so I arranged it that Grant should
see my 'murder' really I did not fall over the cliff. I dropped on to a clump
of bushes. I had a cord round my waist."</p>
<p>"But who fired that shot?" Grant asked.</p>
<p>"Why, I fired it myself. After that I pitched the revolver into the sea. I
lay on those bushes until it was safe to get away. I had my disguise ready. I
was going to slip away to some foreign part where I could enjoy the money of
the firm. Cardella could not touch me then. I was terribly afraid of Cardella,
I can't say why. But I was. I always felt that sooner or later he would break
us down. And when I started for the Continent I suddenly recollected that I had
left all the securities behind me in the cellar. I had come back for them. I
went to Fairford in a common lodging house, and there it was that Clarkson
found me. I had quite forgotten Clarkson. After the story of the telegram came
out he guessed what I had done. He was a bit lucky to find me, but find me he
did. Of course, his idea was to blackmail me, to live on me in future. Still,
he could do nothing, and I could do nothing until I came back and took the box
out of the cellar. I think Raybold must have known something, too, for he seems
to be as big a scamp as the others. Now don't ask me why I did this, because I
really couldn't tell you. Why do men commit strange and unaccountable acts? Why
did I try to induce a young and innocent girl like May Leverton to marry me?
Why did I prey upon the vanity and folly of her mother? By the way, Grant, that
reminds me that in my desk&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That is already done," Grant said curtly. "Everything is settled and nobody
is any the wiser. Scarsdale will excuse me if I don't talk secrets before
him."</p>
<p>"Then I must not say any more on that account," Spencer went on. "My
carefully laid plot seems to have turned out a complete and absolute
failure."</p>
<p>"It would have been successful enough but for Smith," Grant said. "It might
have been a great deal worse. And now what are you going to do? In common
fairness to Scarsdale and myself&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes. I know exactly what you are going to say. There is not the slightest
necessity to do so. I shall never show my face in London again. I am going off
to the South of France to a little spot there where I shall end my days. All I
ask for is half my usual share of the business, and you can get our solicitors
to draw up the necessary deeds as soon as you like."</p>
<p>Scarsdale went back home feeling that the world was a pleasant place to live
in after all. It was a glorious day, too, and the sunshine was getting on his
head. He had gone off before his wife was down, and he found her anxiously
awaiting his return. She took heart of grace from his smiling face.</p>
<p>"Something good has happened," she said. "Has Sir Bruce forgiven me?"</p>
<p>Scarsdale took Ellen in his arms and kissed her fondly.</p>
<p>"There is nothing to forgive," he said. "Had you not acted as you did, the
whole course of our lives would have been changed. And they would have been
changed for the worse. After all is said and done you did nothing very wrong,
Nell. It was foolish, perhaps, and impulsive, but you acted for the best. You
allowed your sentimental feelings to get the better of you. And what would this
dreary old world of ours be without a little flavour of sentiment!"</p>
<p>"It will be about all we have left," Ellen said sadly. "Indeed, it won't, my
dear. As a matter of fact, we are going to be a little better off than
hitherto. But let us go in the garden and I'll tell you everything. I must have
a cigarette. After that I will tell you one of the most remarkable stories I
have ever heard."</p>
<p>Ellen listened with rapt interest to the story that Scarsdale had to tell.
It sounded like some fairy tale. The world looked all the fresher for it
afterwards.</p>
<p>"It's really wonderful," Ellen said "It seems almost impossible. And so we
owe the whole of this to Mr. John Smith. We must have him down here to stay
with us; we must make a tremendous fuss of him. But what about Hubert Grant and
May Leverton?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I daresay that will come all right," Scarsdale laughed. "Grant seems to
have done Leverton some tremendous service so far as I could gather. I don't
know what it is, but something quite out of the common. He can't very well
refuse his consent after that. I shouldn't be surprised if May came over with a
happy story to tell."</p>
<p>Scarsdale turned out to be a true prophet. It was a day or two later that
May rode over to see Ellen. She was beaming with happiness and joy. Her face
was sufficient for Mrs. Scarsdale.</p>
<p>"I guess," she said, as she kissed the girl fondly, "your father has given
his consent."</p>
<p>"That is it," May laughed happily. "Hubert dined with us last night. He did
a thing for us that my father can never forget. And he did it at a time when he
was in great danger. And you helped him, you darling! Without you he couldn't
have done it at all. I can't tell you what it was, for it is more or less of a
family secret. I went to the station with Hubert this morning, and he is going
to have us all to dinner at Ledge Point to-night. Mr. Smith is coming down,
too. And, of course, the thing will not be complete without you two. I hope you
will not mind accepting an informal invitation like this."</p>
<p>"My dear child, we will come with the greatest possible pleasure," Ellen
replied. "I am sure Philip will be as delighted as myself. How fortunately
everything has turned out for us all. And now come down the garden and look at
my roses. They are better than yours."</p>
<p>It was quite a happy little party that gathered together at Ledge Point the
same evening. It was just as well, perhaps, that Paul Spencer was not there. He
had already started for the South of France without saying good-bye to anybody.
John Smith was there beaming with delight and taking a fatherly interest in the
young people. It seemed to him that he was more or less responsible for their
happiness, and, indeed, they were quite ready to give him credit for his
success.</p>
<p>"We owe you a good deal more than I can possibly say," Sir Bruce exclaimed.
Dinner was over now, and they were smoking their cigarettes and drinking their
coffee on the balcony.</p>
<p>"The more I think over the whole thing the more remarkable it seems. A
regular play, a drama, my dear sir."</p>
<p>"The finest ever written!" Smith laughed. "If I could only put it down on
paper, I should make a fortune out of it. But, of course, those confounded
managers would say that it was not true to life, and that it was not
convincing. They always say that about&mdash;my plays. And yet I never
constructed a single incident that was not founded on fact, and be hanged to
'em!"</p>
<p>"Those young people do not take the same view," Sir Bruce laughed.</p>
<p>"No&mdash;because they are filled with the proper sentiment!" Smith cried.
"What a setting to the play this place is! And how happy they ought to be
here!"</p>
<p>May and Hubert were thinking the same thing as they walked side by side down
the garden. For them it had been a wonderful evening&mdash;the most wonderful
day in their lives. They were very silent for some time&mdash;the silence of
perfect understanding and perfect companionship.</p>
<p>"What a difference a few days make!" May said at length.</p>
<p>"Don't they?" Hubert agreed. "A week ago and we were as far apart as the
poles. Four days ago and it looked as if our life's happiness was gone for
good. And almost before we turn round you are here, and your father is sitting
yonder on the balcony smiling approval on me. But we should never have
accomplished this without our good friend, John Smith."</p>
<p>"I have not forgotten your courage and resolution." May said, with a tender
smile. "We should have had to wait a long time if you had not faced your
trouble so nobly. After all, there are worse things for a man than a stout
heart and a Front of Brass."</p>
