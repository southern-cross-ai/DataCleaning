<h2>CHAPTER I.&mdash;A LORD OF ACRES.</h2>
<p>The mists rolled back discreetly, the pearly curtain lifted demurely, as if
conscious of the splendour that it concealed, then the turrets of Borne Abbey
raised their carved pinnacles into the blue of the summer morning. The long
white mantle folded itself slowly backward, and the house stood in view like
some perfect picture with the great sweep of its famous beech trees behind.
Where a moment before there had been nothing visible but the thin grey envelope
of the mist and dew, stood now a long, low house, a miracle of cunning
architecture, stained to a fine red-brown by the deft hand of the passing
centuries. For this you cannot buy or manufacture, for it comes only with the
passage of the years, and many a storm and many a shine goes to the exquisite
making of it.</p>
<p>And there is nothing finer or more beautiful on the English countryside than
Borne Abbey. It has all the strength and weight of a cathedral, with the grace
and finish given it by such masters of the art of building as Christopher Wren
and Inigo Jones and Pugin. Add to this the poetry in stonework of a Grinling
Gibbons, and there stands out the faint picture of what Borne Abbey is
like.</p>
<p>Indeed, the place had an atmosphere of its own. It lay there in the
sunshine, glistening in the early moisture like some mythological beauty, fresh
from a bath of sea spray, the sky bent, blue and grey and opalescent, behind
the wondrous carvings and the quaint beauties of the twisted chimney stacks.
For a whole three hundred feet the south front stretched itself along its flank
of velvet lawns where the flowers were rioting in their beds, and beyond all
this, the park extended almost to the sea. It looked like what it was, a cradle
of heroes and men who have left their mark upon the blood-stained pages of
history.</p>
<p>For nearly four hundred years the Cranwallis family had lived here, lords of
broad acres and suzerain of a many goodly manors. Here was a house, at least,
where the modern millionaire came not, and the plutocrat gave no trouble. It
would never have occurred to Egbert Cranwallis, eighth Earl of Sherringborne,
that such a possibility or such a contingency might arise. He knew that certain
peers of his, drifting along the tide of modern democracy, had come under the
glamour of the cheque book, but then, in their cases, poor men, it was
oft-times a matter of sheer necessity. So far as he was concerned he had his
rent roll, he could afford to play the part of the grand seigneur, and, to do
him justice, he played it exceedingly well. It was no acting on his part, it
was a clear dispensation of Providence, and he would know how to give an
account of his stewardship when his time came to answer the roll-call.</p>
<p>The Cranwallises had always been men of affairs, and the present head of the
family was no exception to the rule. He had no particular affection for
politics; au contraire, he rather disliked them. He would infinitely have
preferred to pass his time at Borne Abbey, but he had a profound respect for
his responsibilities, and that was why he found himself at fifty-five a Cabinet
Minister, holding the portfolio of Foreign Affairs. As Lord Palmerston said
with regard to the Garter, there was no d....d merit about it, but if
Sherringborne was not brilliant, he was sound and he was safe.</p>
<p>For the rest, he was a widower with one son and one daughter; the latter,
Lady Edna, who kept his house and reigned over the Abbey with a despotism no
less despotic because the little hand was sheathed so carefully in the velvet
glove.</p>
<p>Lady Edna had all the good looks of the Cranwallises. She was tall and
slight and dark, a little too haughty, perhaps, but then, what would anyone
have in a daughter of a semi-regal house like that? Perhaps it was the
shortness of her upper lip, and the slight aquiline curve of her nose which
endowed her features with that faint suggestion of hauteur that a good many
people found repellent, not to say awe-inspiring. But these, for the most part,
were strangers&mdash;there was not a man or woman or child on those broad acres
who did not worship the ground that Lady Edna trod on.</p>
<p>It was perhaps not altogether the girl's own fault, since this sort of thing
had been her native air. From the very beginning she had been taught
unconsciously that the human race consisted of men and women and Cranwallises.
There were just a few others, perhaps, whose names were to be found in the
fascinating works of Debrett and Burke, but these were few and far between;
thus Lady Edna led a comparatively secluded life, indeed. Baron Rupert de la
Croisa was wont to say that there was a distinct flavour of the cloister about
her. But then the Baron was a privileged individual, a licensed old friend with
a terrible tongue, and his declaration that Lady Edna would some day marry
entirely outside her own station was a thing that he kept to himself. We shall
come to Baron de la Croisa presently.</p>
<p>But, after all said and done, it was a great position and a great
responsibility for a girl who had barely attained her twenty-first year. But,
be that as it might, Lady Edna had entertained Royalty at Borne Abbey, she was
pleasantly familiar with Ambassadors, and she treated Cabinet Ministers with a
serene contempt that most of them undoubtedly merited. She floated on the crest
of the wave serenely, a marvel of capacity; she would cheerfully have
undertaken to share the responsibilities of a kingdom, and, beyond question,
she would have done it well.</p>
<p>She came out in the garden now, from under the shadow of the great Norman
archway, with the storied device of the Cranwallises cut deep in the stone over
her glossy head. She stood there, chin up, inhaling the sweetness and fragrance
of the morning, filled with the joy and vigour of life, and wondering vaguely
why she felt so happy and uplifted. Then she passed across the lawns by the
busy gardeners and returned presently with her arms filled with blooms all wet
with the dew of the morning. McKillop, the Scotch gardener, sighed impotently
as he contemplated this desecration of his peculiar province. He had tried once
to induce Lady Edna to a proper sense of her position, but that had been four
years ago, when he had first come. He had showed fight, of course, for he came
from a race that always did. The combat had been a short and decisive one, and
now McKillop could only sigh and bend his head before a force that had
ruthlessly trodden down all the traditions of his ancient craft. It would,
perhaps, have surprised the wilful beauty of the household had she known that
McKillop regarded her as a dangerous radical with designs upon the fabric of
society. And now he stood and pretended to enjoy it when Lady Edna
congratulated him upon his roses.</p>
<p>"They are very fine, McKillop," she said. "But I have seen better. The
Baron's, for instance."</p>
<p>McKillop, being a Scotchman and an honest man, admitted the charge with an
inward groan. One of the crosses he had to bear lay in the fact that Baron de
la Croisa could grow better roses than his own. And this man was a mere
foreigner, forsooth, a sort of Spaniard who had come into the neighbourhood
from somewhere on the Spanish Main, and, when he and McKillop had first met,
the upstart's knowledge of roses had been nil.</p>
<p>Lady Edna turned from the discomfited McKillop and made her way down the
long beech avenue till she stopped at the lodge gates and exchanged a word or
two with the old woman who lived there. Then for a moment, attracted by
something she saw in the road, she passed beyond the big hammered-iron gates
that Quentin Matays himself had forged, and stood there looking across to the
sea. Early as it was, a touring car came hurling down the road and pulled up
almost at Lady Edna's feet. A dark, flashing, handsome face, lighted up by a
pair of mischievous eyes, looked out of the window and accosted Lady Edna in a
voice that had nothing lacking in audacity about it.</p>
<p>"Am I on my way to Lamport?" the visitor said. "My man is not quite sure,
and I am a stranger here."</p>
<p>Lady Edna recoiled slightly. She knew well enough who was the beautiful
woman speaking to her. She had met Senora Garrados once in a London
drawing-room when that light of the stage was giving a charity performance
under the roof of a duchess. She had been shocked and scandalised at the
abandon of the performance, but then Lady Edna made no secret of her
old-fashioned views on this point though she had frozen into herself later on
when this dancing creature had had the audacity to address her in tones of
absolute familiarity, and, strangely enough, the duchess and her entourage had
seen nothing strange in the proceeding. But Lady Edna's manner had been marked
enough, and the woman in the car had not forgotten it.</p>
<p>The two recognised one another with that instant hostility that only women
possess. Lady Edna stood there, cold and statuesque in her classic beauty, and
perhaps quite misunderstanding the humorous twinkle in the dancer's eyes.</p>
<p>"You are on the right road," she said haughtily. "It is impossible to make a
mistake."</p>
<p>"I think we have met before," Ninon Garrados threw herself back in her seat
and said.</p>
<p>"I think not," Lady Edna said icily. "Indeed, I hope not. You must be
mistaken."</p>
<p>With that the car moved on. Ninon Garrados threw herself back in her seat
and laughed whole-heartedly to her companion.</p>
<p>"Now, what do you think of that, Coralie?" she said. "What your Tennyson
calls Lady Vere de Vere. But some day she will wake up, and then, if the right
man comes along, ah, well, then we shall see things. She is a great lady, but
she is not born yet. I have seen them before."</p>
<p>"But have you met her?" the girl called Coralie asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I have met her, yes. In Society, bien entend. She seems to think I am
just a circus girl. But that, of course, my dear Coralie, is the fault of her
bringing up. I should not wonder, some day if Lady Edna Cranwallis and myself
became good friends. But she will have to be born first, oh, yes. She could not
believe, of course, that Ninon Garrados, the dancing girl, could be the
daughter of a Spanish grandee. Ah, she has yet much to learn. But a splendid
woman, my dear Coralie, a splendid woman when the right man comes along."</p>
<p>"She was very rude," Coralie smiled.</p>
<p>The dazzling Spaniard showed her teeth in a gleam which the great world had
learned to know so well.</p>
<p>"Not rude, mia cara," she said. "So great a lady could never be rude. I
wonder what she would say if she knew that, by the raising of my little finger,
I could be her sister-in-law. Is she aware, think you, that Lord Shorland, her
brother, is one of my little Pomeranians? I wonder if it would be worth while.
It's a great title, and Borne Abbey is a fine historic estate. I might do
worse, Coralie, I might do worse. And with me to train him, Shorland has
distinct possibilities. It would make quite a play, my child."</p>
<p>"With you for the heroine," Coralie said. "I should like to be there to see
the third act."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.&mdash;THE NEW ORDER.</h2>
<p>Lord Sherringborne had dispatched his bacon with a due regard to the
traditional surrounding toast and marmalade. He had finished his coffee and,
with a cigarette, was disposed to talk. For the most part, he enjoyed his
week-ends more than those days when the calls of State summoned him to London.
He did not see the necessity for an overworked legislature to be sitting in
July, and was inclined to criticise the Premier who was mainly responsible for
this condition of things.</p>
<p>"You had better tell Sir James Pallisser so yourself," Lady Edna smiled. "I
don't see why you should choose me as medium for your criticism. But as Sir
James is coming down here this evening for the week-end, can't you try and
persuade him yourself of the necessity for a holiday?"</p>
<p>Lord Sherringborne wiped his white moustache thoughtfully. He looked just a
little uneasy and disturbed, and he was not meeting his daughter's direct gaze
quite so steadily as usual.</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;the fact is, things are not quite what they should be,"
he said. "Of course, I can't enter into details, I tell you too many Cabinet
secrets as it is. But the Premier isn't coming down here at all to-day. There
has been some breakdown in connection with stupid trouble in Tortina, and it
looks as if America and Japan might come to loggerheads with regard to those
Islands off the coast of Tortina. Nothing like a rupture, of course, but it's
rather a complicated business, and I really ought to be in town looking after
it. But Pallisser prefers to handle it himself, and that's why he's kept in
town. But you can read his letter if you like."</p>
<p>"Then we shall be entirely alone this week-end," Lady Edna cried. "How
jolly&mdash;I mean, how nice. I haven't had you entirely to myself since
Easter."</p>
<p>It was a pretty enough compliment in its way, but for once Lord
Sherringborne did not seem to appreciate it.</p>
<p>"Well, not exactly," he said with some hesitation. "You see, I have
telegraphed to young Saltburn to come down. I don't think you have met Philip
Saltburn."</p>
<p>Lady Edna partly rose from the table. The smile had died out of those
glorious eyes of hers, and her face had suddenly grown hard and cold.</p>
<p>"Is this a joke, father?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Is it a Joke; my dear, why a joke? I am not given to what Shorland calls
'leg pullin.' Of course, in my peculiar position, I have&mdash;er&mdash;to make
myself agreeable to many people&mdash;"</p>
<p>"In London," Lady Edna corrected. "Yes, but this is an entirely different
matter. None of that class have ever been down here before. Besides, what
possible connection can there be between us and these Saltburns? Oh, I know all
about the father. I know that forty years ago he started in life selling glue
or tin-tacks, or something equally revolting and necessary. I know that he is a
great financier, with offices in every capital in Europe&mdash;sort of
Rothschilds&mdash;Lady Marchborough says. But it is not very complimentary to
the Rothschilds to mention them in the same breath. But really, my dear father,
the audacity of these people is getting beyond all bearing."</p>
<p>"Unfortunately," Sherringborne sighed, "unfortunately, we can't do without
them."</p>
<p>"Fortunately we can do without them here," Lady Edna said, with some
austerity. "Oh, I quite recognise their power and importance. Baron de la
Croisa said the other night that a handful of capitalists over a plate of
filberts and a bottle of port could change the map of Europe if they liked. But
with all their power none of them has yet succeeded in getting an invitation to
Borne Abbey, and I am rather surprised&mdash;"</p>
<p>Sherringborne shuffled uneasily in his chair.</p>
<p>"My dear, you have no sympathy with modern thought. It is absolutely
necessary for the Government to keep on the right side of Saltburn. He's got
that Tortina business in the hollow of his hand, and really his son is quite a
decent young fellow. Oxford and Eton, a really first-class shot, and a straight
rider to hounds. I shouldn't be at all surprised if Saltburn decides to buy
'The Chantrey'&mdash;"</p>
<p>Lady Edna passed her hand across her face as if she were suffering from a
particularly hideous form of nightmare. In a faint, small voice she asked
Sherringborne if she heard him correctly. Was she to understand that 'The
Chantrey' was actually in the market? She refrained from asking her father why
he had dared to contemplate such a step without consulting her, but that was
what her tone inferred, and the fact was not lost upon his Majesty's Minister
for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>"What was the good of it?" he asked. He spread out his hands as if he were
addressing a hostile gathering in the House of Lords.</p>
<p>"I ask you as a sensible girl what we make per annum out of 'The Chantrey'?
It's a beautiful old house, and, of course, it has been the family dower-house
for centuries. Look at the land there, what poor stuff it is. Nothing but gorse
and heather&mdash;seven or eight thousand acres for a few sheep to starve on.
If I sell the place to Saltburn we shan't even know that he's there. And I
understand he is prepared to pay quite a fancy price for it."</p>
<p>"A fancy price," Lady Edna echoed scornfully. "My dear father, where do you
pick up your expressions? It sounds like a ticket on a ready-made mantle in a
Bond-street shop. If we are in need of money, which we are not&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then we are exceedingly fortunate, my dear," Sherringborne said in his
mildest manner. "I suppose you don't realise what an expensive luxury Shorland
is?"</p>
<p>"I suppose Teddy is extravagant," Lady Edna admitted with the air of a
sovereign asking Parliament for a grant for some pampered prince. "I shouldn't
so much mind if he were a little more careful with his acquaintances. But then
those society papers exaggerate so. I read a ridiculous story a few days ago
about Shorland and that South American dancer. Something idiotic about a
diamond necklace. By the way, I saw her this morning. Her car pulled up, and
she asked me the way. A common, flaunting creature."</p>
<p>"Ah, there you are a little prejudiced," Sherringborne said. "I thought she
was&mdash;er&mdash;I mean, believe she is quite well connected."</p>
<p>"And leads that sort of life?"</p>
<p>"Well, why not, my dear. It can be quite respectable, and it means quite a
fabulous income, so far as I know. Ninon Garrados goes everywhere."</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose she does. But she doesn't come here, and, of course, that
story of the diamond necklace is a fable."</p>
<p>Sherringborne smiled a little guiltily as he lighted a fresh cigarette. It
was not for him to say that he had the bill for those diamonds in his pocket at
the very moment. He was almost ashamed to tell Lady Edna how frank the old
family solicitor had been on the subject of Shorland's extravagance. But this
was not likely to affect his daughter much, for she had regarded the Cranwallis
exchequer to be as limitless as the sea. Where mere money was concerned her
contempt was wholehearted, not to say picturesque.</p>
<p>"Does Teddy owe so much?" she asked carelessly.</p>
<p>"Over thirty thousand pounds," Sherringborne said. "And this is by no means
the first time. Even our exchequer cannot stand it. My dear Edna, I really
don't know where the money is coming from. The lawyers tell me that I can't cut
down any more timber."</p>
<p>"You can't, you can't. Why?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all very well to talk like that, but the estate is not mine to do
what I like with. I am merely what the law calls a tenant for life. And so, you
see, this money must be paid. It would never do for a man in my position to
have Shorland's debts thrown in my face. And that is why I have made up my mind
to sell 'The Chantrey.'"</p>
<p>Sherringborne spoke with a resolution that he was far from feeling, and had
Lady Edna been less wrapped up in her contemplation of the family dignity she
would have seen how hard and grey her father's face had grown. She would see
that there was something here beyond financial worries.</p>
<p>"Saltburn has offered me at least four times the value of the place," he
went on. "Indeed, I don't understand why he wants to buy it at all. And I shall
be glad, my dear, if you won't say any more about it. You will, of course, make
Mr. Philip Saltburn's brief stay here as pleasant as possible."</p>
<p>Lady Edna inclined her head graciously. She was a loyal and dutiful daughter
enough, but she was not pleased, and as the day wore on she began to be
conscious of an uneasy feeling that something was going to happen, that her
father was concealing material facts from her. The day slipped on decorously,
as it always did at Borne Abbey, luncheon was a thing of the past, and Lady
Edna was sitting down to tea quite alone in the great hall waiting for
Sherringborne, who was out somewhere on the estate. She sat there in the cool
brown silence, with the little flecks of light cast here and there from the
armour round the walls, waiting, half-unconsciously, for the coming visitor.
She had gone off into a day-dream of her own when she became aware of the fact
that a footman was standing behind her with a young man by his side. He was a
tall, well-knit young man with a face bronzed almost to the hue of mahogany,
with the tinge of health showing beneath it like the rosy side of a winter
apple. A masterful man, too, for his lips were close set and his grey eyes
steadfast.</p>
<p>"I am Philip Saltburn," he said, respectfully enough, though his tone was
easy and self-reliant. "It is a great pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady
Edna."</p>
<p>Philip Saltburn held out his hand with a frank suggestion of equality that
touched Lady Edna's pride at once. Seeing that this young man was her guest,
there was nothing for it but to yield her hand with what grace she could. And
with it all she caught herself thinking what a firm grip Saltburn had, and what
a deal of conscious power lay in those brown fingers of his.</p>
<p>Not a handsome man, Lady Edna decided, but his features were good and
regular. He looked so wonderfully healthy and wholesome, and, strangely enough,
quite like one to the manner born. Positively, there were no points in this
young man's armour to pick holes in. His flannel suit was well-cut and quiet in
texture, his grey silk tie was knotted with the careful carelessness that
usually goes with a well-dressed man who is not even aware of the fact that he
is well dressed.</p>
<p>With those few words he dropped into one of the great carved Cromwellian
chairs and began to talk quite easily and naturally. He appeared to have
travelled far and wide, he seemed to have studied most things that mattered to
advantage. And though Edna had been steeping in an atmosphere of art from her
childhood, her own knowledge of the great English masters around her was
nothing like so wide and comprehensive as that of her guest. He put her right
upon a minor point or two quite without a suggestion of superiority.</p>
<p>Clearly it was impossible to patronise this young man. He absolutely refused
to see any line of social demarcation between himself and his beautiful
hostess. He would probably have dismissed the suggestion with a smile.</p>
<p>"I have travelled a great deal," he said. "You see, I was born in Australia.
My father emigrated there nearly fifty years ago. When I was old enough for
school I divided my time between Eton and Heidelburg, finishing up at Oxford.
It has been a pleasant life but I have never known what it is to have a home;
still, I have had dreams of a place like this, and that is why I am so anxious
to get 'The Chantrey.' I happened to see it some time ago, and fell in love
with the place, and my father is buying it to please me."</p>
<p>Lady Edna sat there, looking thoughtfully into the flower-decked fireplace.
Possibly this young man meant nothing offensive, but the time had come to show
him that matters were going too far.</p>
<p>"I am afraid I am not concerned with that," she said haughtily. "The Earl
was telling me something about it at breakfast time, but I am very much afraid,
Mr. Saltburn, that I could not possibly give my consent."</p>
<p>"Indeed," Saltburn said with twinkling eyes. "Then I am afraid we shall have
to do without it."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.&mdash;"THESE THINGS TO HEAR&mdash;"</h2>
<p>There was no antagonism in Philip Saltburn's clear eyes. He lay back in his
chair, crossing his legs, and smilingly contemplating the cut of his neat brown
shoe. Obviously a difficult man to anger, and still more difficult to turn from
his point. Lady Edna regarded him with smouldering eyes. She would not lose her
temper, of course, but really this young man must be made to understand.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," she said coldly.</p>
<p>"And I beg yours," Saltburn said. "But, you see, the thing is as good as
done. Of course, I should like to have your approval, but if you withhold it,
then I can only deplore your point of view. What a charming old hall this is.
There is nothing that shows pictures off so well as warm, brown old oak. And
may I trouble you for another cup of this delicious tea. We are great tea
drinkers in Australia, but we never get any like this. I expect that beautiful
Queen Anne silver makes the difference."</p>
<p>Lady Edna murmured something vague in reply. She had an uneasy feeling that
there was something wrong in her attack, and she was uneasily conscious that
she had come in contact with a force. Clearly this young man was not going to
be routed by the feudal method. Perhaps he was a radical, but, in that case, he
would have had no sympathy with old oak and Queen Anne silver and the works of
the great English masters. Clearly it was useless to try and snub him, to open
his eyes to the awful gulf that lay between a Cranwallis and a Saltburn.
Perhaps it might be possible to let him down gently, to send him away with a
clear impression that money was not everything, and that a Cranwallis was as
far above him as the misty star is beyond the flight of the moth.</p>
<p>She would not, perhaps, have been so tranquil beneath the armour of her
exclusiveness could she have looked into Saltburn's mind, for over the edge of
his Sevres cup he was studying her with the calm critical approval of a
polished man of the world.</p>
<p>For Saltburn was acquainted with foreign courts. As the only son of that
great financial magnate, William Saltburn, he found all houses were open to
him, he had basked in the smiles of royalty itself. And he was not dazzled, he
was too serene and level-headed for that. He had his own ideals, he knew
exactly the type of woman whom some day he hoped would rule over the dainty and
refined home which he saw late at night behind the blue drift of his cigarette
smoke.</p>
<p>And here it seemed to him that he had found the very thing that he was
looking for. Phil Saltburn was no snob, it was no exhilaration, to him to find
himself mixing with the great ones of the earth; his critical faculty was too
keen and clear for that.</p>
<p>But he had never yet seen anyone who set his pulses beating and moved him to
such a warm regard as Lady Edna was doing. He liked her pose, he liked the
haughty stamp of her beauty, the curve of her lips, and the aquiline chiselling
of her nose. She might have been one of Tennyson's heroines, and Saltburn had
always had a weakness for the women of that great Victorian. As he sat there,
balancing his tea cup, he was drifting to the conclusion that there was no
occasion to go any farther, but there was no hurry, and, as far as he knew,
there was no one in the way.</p>
<p>He came down to dinner in the same frame of mind, where he sat with
Sherringborne and his daughter in the Rubens dining-room to a meal which was
none the less elaborate because it was so exceedingly simple. Half a dozen
servants in the Cranwallis livery moved noiselessly about the room; the shaded
lamps under the quaint pictures picked out the exuberant flesh colourings of
the great Flemish artists. Silver and glass were priceless in their way, and it
seemed to Saltburn that he had never seen such peaches and grapes before. Not
that he was in the least impressed. He stood in no awe even of the magnificent
family butler, who, before now, had impressed a Cabinet Minister.</p>
<p>Lady Edna sat there, dressed almost severely in black, her arms and
shoulders shining like ivory in the shaded lights. There was just one diamond
flashing in her hair, an old ring or two on her slim fingers. From under her
half-closed lashes she surveyed her guest. She was a little disappointed,
perhaps, that she could find no flaw in his social exterior. Even the trying
act of peeling and eating one of the Cranwallis peaches gave her no loophole
for criticism.</p>
<p>"This is a wonderful old place of yours," Saltburn said. "I have been
wandering about the grounds and admiring them, but what strikes me most
forcibly are those amazing old yew hedges of yours."</p>
<p>"Yes, we pride ourselves on our hedges," Sherringborne said. "They were
planted in the reign of Elizabeth, mostly by Sir Walter Raleigh, I believe.
They have been useful for the purposes of defence more than once. Nothing could
get through them. They are impregnable."</p>
<p>"It would certainly be a matter of time," Saltburn observed. "I think I
could manage it if I wanted to. It would be a matter of breaking one branch
after another just as John Halifax suggested when the question was put to him
by Phineas Fletcher. Do you remember the incident, Lady Edna?"</p>
<p>Lady Edna looked up from her peach languidly.</p>
<p>"I recall it," she said. "But I never cared much for that class of
literature. In spite of his many virtues, John Halifax was essentially a
middle-class man. The story of his successful career might have appealed to
Samuel Smiles, but it certainly does not to me."</p>
<p>"There you are wrong," Saltburn said. "It is astonishing what little
interest people in your position take in the middle classes. You ought really
to read more good English literature. It is clearly a duty that you owe
us."</p>
<p>Lady Edna smiled faintly. Really, Philip Saltburn was an amusing young man.
A little later on, perhaps, she would be able to show him that there was
another point of view.</p>
<p>"I am sorry you think my education has been neglected," she said. "And you
do, don't you?"</p>
<p>"I am perfectly certain of it," Saltburn said in a tone that had no possible
suggestion of offence in it. "It is not good for anyone to lead an aloof life
in these days. Of course, yours is an ideal existence here, but none of us ever
knows what change time may bring. For instance, it would never have occurred to
you a month ago that you would be entertaining the son of a man who started
life scaring crows from an English wheatfield."</p>
<p>This was so true, such a thrust in the chink of her cold armour that Lady
Edna rose and swept from the room as nearly on the verge of rudeness as ever
she had been in her life. Saltburn watched her with a strange gleam in his
eyes. Then Sherringborne rose somewhat wearily from the table.</p>
<p>"I will get you to excuse me for an hour or two," he said. "I have to see a
friend on a little matter of business. You can finish your duel with Lady Edna
meanwhile."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;THE SILVER CANDLESTICKS.</h2>
<p>The brilliant primrose of the summer twilight had not yet faded in the west
as Sherringborne stepped out on to the terrace and made his way along one of
the trim avenues that led across the park. He looked a little older and less
jaunty now, his head was bowed, and a mass of little wrinkles were netted
around his eyes. He passed under those ancestral elms and beeches, he saw the
deer creeping through the bracken in shadowy procession.</p>
<p>So far as he could see, he was suzerain of all the broad acres around him.
There were farms and homesteads and cottages where every man called him
overlord, and made him homage. And what reigning house in Europe could say more
than that?</p>
<p>And yet Sherringborne looked as little like a happy man as needs be as he
walked on his own soil that evening. He came presently to a little path,
running between wide belts of shrubs, then he opened a wicket gate which gave
upon a very beautiful and charming old world garden. It lay there secluded by
the big forest trees; everywhere were well-kept grass paths between wide beds
of roses. There were roses everywhere in the full panoply of their summer
beauty. Up the slope stood a tiny creeper-clad cottage with latticed
windows.</p>
<p>The place itself was a perfect embodiment of peace and quietness. One could
imagine an artist or a poet living there secluded from the world and by the
world forgotten. The door of the cottage stood invitingly open, and, bending
over a few choice specimens of potted roses, two men appeared to be engaged in
a heated argument. One of them stood up as Sherringborne approached and
extended his hand.</p>
<p>"Now we will leave his lordship to arbitrate," he said. "Francois says this
is nothing less than a Dijon rose, I contend that it is exceedingly impertinent
on his part to contradict an expert so distinguished as myself."</p>
<p>"Francois is an impertinent scoundrel," Sherringborne smiled. "Incidentally,
he is the only man I know who is not really afraid of Baron de la Croisa."</p>
<p>"Ah," the other said. "The hero and his valet over again. True now as ever
it was."</p>
<p>With that the Baron threw back his head and laughed with the heartiness of a
boy. He made a distinguished figure as he stood there in his plain evening
dress, a little knot of ribbon striking a crimson note against the lapel of his
coat. He was not a tall man, but he made the most of his inches; his thin,
ascetic face might have belonged to a distinguished statesman or scholar. His
shrewd brown eyes twinkled with humour, a thick thatch of white hair on his
head resembled nothing so much as a doormat. In his left eye he wore a glass
with a tortoise shell rim. He retained it with the manner of a man who is
thoroughly accustomed to the use of the monocle.</p>
<p>A little old man with a ridiculously fierce grey moustache stood
by&mdash;the type of man who has old soldier written on him in the plainest
possible words. And Francois was a character in his way. He was cook and house
keeper and eke laundress, too, to Baron de la Croisa; he worshipped his master
with an almost dog-like devotion, though his criticisms of that distinguished
individual never lacked anything on the score of frankness.</p>
<p>"Francois, you may retire," the Baron said. "The debate is adjourned for the
present. Do you know, Sherringborne, that there are times when I am almost
sorry Francois saved my life. He seems to think I belong to him ever since. To
this day, I am sure it is a lasting wonder to Francois that my beloved Tortina
once entrusted her destinies to my hands. But come in, my dear old friend, come
in. You look worried and anxious. I am sure you have come here to consult me
about something."</p>
<p>So saying, the Baron led the way into the cottage. It was a tiny affair with
but one living room, and a kitchen on the other side of the door which was
Francois' own private property. There were but two bedrooms and a bathroom
overhead, and the sitting-room itself was furnished with almost Spartan
simplicity. But there was a Persian carpet on the stone floor, the inglenook
was priceless in its way, and on the bare deal table, scrubbed to a snowy
whiteness, were a pair of carved branch candlesticks unmistakably the work of
Cellini himself.</p>
<p>Along the ledge over the fireplace were china ornaments in black and gold,
rare bits of the Ming Dynasty. There were pictures, too, on the whitewashed
walls, a Corot, a Masonnier, and over the fireplace an exquisite Rembrandt. The
Baron formed part of the picture, too, despite the correct severity of his
evening dress. Anyone else would have been grotesquely out of place there, but
de la Croisa struck the right note.</p>
<p>"Sit down," the Baron said hospitably. "Sit down and tell me all about it.
Positively I have not seen a civilised being for over a week. Oh, I'm not
grumbling, honestly, I am much more happy than I should be if I were back in
the arena again. Providence never intended me for politics. I am too
sensitive&mdash;what you call too thin-skinned. Ah, my friend, you did a great
kindness to me when you placed this cottage at the disposal of a disappointed
man. Perhaps I was fortunate to have escaped from Tortina with an income just
sufficient for my modest wants and a few things like these to satisfy my
artistic instincts."</p>
<p>He waved his white hand airily towards the pictures on the wall, his glance
at the candlesticks was almost affectionate.</p>
<p>"You ought to have stayed on," Sherringborne said. "If you had remained in
Tortina, Santa Anna and the present man, Altheos, would never have dared to do
what they have just done. You would have beaten them, my friend, you would have
beaten them, and had you done so you would have saved me a vast amount of
trouble and anxiety. Because, if you were at the head of affairs there now we
should never have had all this bother with Japan over those concessions." The
Baron looked up swiftly.</p>
<p>"Ah," he cried, "There is trouble, then?"</p>
<p>"More than enough, my dear fellow. It's a thing I never anticipated. The
whole crisis came on the Foreign Office like a bombshell. There was not a
single cloud on the horizon. Those concessions of mine that I paid so much for
looked like proving a gold mine. You see, though I am Foreign Minister, I
thought I could handle them, for apparently Tortina was quite beyond our sphere
of influence. And I am afraid I plunged rather heavily, and that I did more or
less acting on William Saltburn's advice."</p>
<p>Again the Baron looked up suddenly.</p>
<p>"That man is a wolf," he said. "That man is out for himself. He thinks of
nothing but money, and, mark you, it is all the same to him where it comes
from. And so that long, greedy hand of his has reached as far as Tortina, has
it? Well, many a hand has been burnt there, and why not Saltburn's? But go on,
my friend, I interrupt you. I understand you are interested in Tortina
concessions."</p>
<p>"Deeply interested," Sherringborne murmured. "So deeply that my financial
future is in peril. And that is not the worst of it, Baron. I am a Minister of
the Crown. I hold an almost sacred office and there has been no slur on the
fair fame of an English Cabinet Minister since the days of Walpole. What would
people say if they knew that the Foreign Minister had an interest in Tortina
concessions? My enemies might say that I had used exclusive diplomatic
information to put money in my pocket. And yet, three months ago, who could
have blamed me for what I did? But now it is different. Japan has interfered
because she claims a voice in the administration of those islands off the coast
of Tortina, and Washington is alarmed. There are only two things before me. One
is to cut my loss, which would mean leaving Borne Abbey, and the other to put
myself in the hands of the Premier."</p>
<p>"Sir James Pallisser doesn't know of this?" the Baron asked.</p>
<p>"Not yet," Sherringborne went on. "But I must tell him. You understand, I
have done nothing wrong, and even yet the trouble may be averted. There can be
no question of armed strife between Japan and America, but if Washington is
obstinate, then my speculation in Tortina concessions must be made public. It
would be disastrous for me, Baron. I should lose practically all I have, at a
moment when my boy has placed a load of debt round my neck. Disgraceful debts,
some of them, which must either be paid or I must leave the Ministry."</p>
<p>It was a long time before the Baron replied. Then he looked into the face of
his friend and his words came dropping like little bits of ice.</p>
<p>"And Saltburn?" he said. "Will Saltburn allow you to drop him? Remember the
man you have to deal with. It is evident that he has been using you as a pawn
in the game and if you come between him and his prey he will break you,
Sherringborne, like a butterfly. I know that man. I knew him when I was
president of the Tortina Republic, and I know that it was his money which was
behind the revolution that drove me out of the country that I, a Spaniard, had
practically made."</p>
<p>Sherringborne rose to his feet. He paced up and down the little
sitting-room, his face white and wet.</p>
<p>"My God," he cried. "De la Croisa, I never thought of that. And here I have
his son under my very roof at the present moment. And what about our old
friend, El Murid? Surely he can save the situation? He remains in Tortina
still, and in memory of the days when we were at Eton together he will do what
he can for me. Because, you see, he knows the truth. He has the documents that
would save my political reputation. Can't you get in touch with him? Can't you
tell him the facts? Is it possible to persuade him to come to England? Because
there is no great hurry. These negotiations may take a long time, and I may
save both my fortune and my name yet."</p>
<p>"Then you haven't heard," the Baron said slowly, "You don't know that El
Murid is dead?"</p>
<p>"Dead," Sherringborne cried. "El Murid dead?"</p>
<p>He dropped into a chair, all white and shaking, and a fine bead of moisture
stood on his forehead.</p>
<p>"I only heard this afternoon," the Baron went on. "It came to me in an
underground way, as these things often do. Our dear old friend is not only
dead; it is worse than that. El Murid committed suicide two days ago."</p>
<p>"Ah, then, it is even worse than I feared," Sherringborne cried. "He was a
brave man, always reckless of his own life, and always deficient in moral
courage. He was just the same at Eton. I knew him well, Baron, we were the very
best of friends. Can't you see what a terrible thing it is for me? It cuts the
last prop from under my feet. Nothing can be gained now by disguising the
truth. What can we do?"</p>
<p>"Only wait," the Baron said. "Only wait, and hope for the best. If we could
get hold of El Murid's papers, then it is just possible that&mdash;I
wonder&mdash;"</p>
<p>For a moment or two the Baron paced the floor in deep thought, while
Sherringborne watched him with anxious eyes.</p>
<p>"Yes," the Baron said thoughtfully. "There is just a chance. But I can tell
you nothing yet."</p>
<p>"Ruin," Sherringborne murmured. "Absolute ruin."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.&mdash;NOBLESSE OBLIGE.</h2>
<p>De La Croisa closed the door softly and lighted the candles in the great
silver branches. As the crocus flames grow up one by one, so did the expression
on Sherringborne's face stand out all the more white and ghastly. After all, it
seemed to de la Croisa that his was the better part and the more noble portion.
He had lost all, or nearly all, that men in his class value. His ambition lay
buried underneath the roots of his beloved roses. Yet, all the same, his
sympathy for Sherringborne was deep and sincere. His voice trembled a little as
he laid his hand upon his friend's shoulder.</p>
<p>"This is very bad, my dear old comrade," he said. "Tell me all about it. How
did it happen?"</p>
<p>Sherringborne spread out his hands helplessly. There was no sign of the lord
of the manor here now, no suggestion of the smooth, strong man, who held, to a
certain extent, the fate of England in his hands. For the nonce, he was an old
man, with the red sword of a great trouble hanging over his head.</p>
<p>"I don't know," he replied. "It would be difficult to say. I am all misty
and confused. I don't seem to be able to think coherently. I suppose it was
Shorland's extravagance that started it. You see, I had paid over sixty
thousand pounds for him already, and my expenses appear to be enormous. Not but
what I should have had enough if it had not been for that wretched boy of mine.
I began to feel alarmed. It was about the time that I first met Saltburn. In a
way I rather like the man. He is so strong&mdash;so self-reliant&mdash;I never
met a man who reminded me so much of Cecil Rhodes. It was he who first hinted
of the possibilities of Tortina Concessions. And, after all, one must have
one's money somewhere. I bought largely. I suppose I must have invested
something like a hundred and fifty thousand pounds. I believed all that
Saltburn said. I began to see my way towards clearing half a million.</p>
<p>"And now?" de la Croisa asked significantly. "And now I look like losing two
hundred thousand. But that isn't the worst. There is going to be a big scandal
over this, Baron. One or two of the financiers will be accused of fomenting
this trouble for their own benefit&mdash;"</p>
<p>"They won't mind that," the Baron murmured. "In the present singular
condition of society a thing of that sort is regarded with a certain amount of
admiration&mdash;I mean admiration of the financier, of course. But the world
says hard things of public men who dabble in these kind of adventures. They
will say especially hard things about a Cabinet Minister who lends himself to
this class of financing. They will say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know what they will say," Sherringborne exclaimed. "They will say I
have been using my position to make money. They will point out me as the only
man in the English Administration who has done this disgraceful thing since the
days of Walpole. And the worst of the whole thing is that it is true. If
everything had gone well, no one would have been any the wiser, no one would
have cared. But as it is&mdash;"</p>
<p>Sherringborne paused as if unable to go any further. There was no blinking
facts, there was no sophistry to varnish such a terrible indiscretion. And yet
it had all seemed so safe, so sure, and certain. Even a distinguished nobleman
occupying a great public position must do something with his money.
Sherringborne had a reputation for hard common-sense, but, as a matter of fact,
in business matters he was a perfect child. He thought moodily now of another
great nobleman who had been recently dragged through the mud at the heels of an
unscrupulous financier, but then, the nobleman in question had kept clear of
politics.</p>
<p>He would have to resign his position, he would have to make a clean breast
of the whole transaction to Sir James Pallisser, the Premier. The Opposition
Press would get hold of this thing, they would not fail to make the most of it.
In his mind's eye he could see the headlines of the posters staring him in the
face, he could hear the yelp of the whole Opposition pack in the House of
Commons. And yet he had gone into this simply as clean business, and never
dreaming for a moment that the whole thing was to be elevated so soon into an
international problem.</p>
<p>"Can't you suggest something?" he said. The Baron shook his head
sorrowfully. There was nothing to suggest. They could only sit there,
discussing the matter in all its bearings, and the more the vexed question was
threshed out the blacker and more repulsive it seemed.</p>
<p>"I must be getting back home," Sherringborne said wearily. "I'll come over
again to-morrow afternoon when my head is a bit clearer. Good-night, my dear
old Baron."</p>
<p>It was not yet quite dark as Sherringborne retraced his footsteps through
the park. He could hear the wind rustling amongst the beeches, he saw the
pheasants scuttling across the drive: a covey of partridges rose from under his
feet and went drumming away over the bracken. A belated labourer passed him,
touching his hat in humble homage. It was all his, so far as he could see, even
the beasts of the field and the birds of the air seemed to come under his
sway.</p>
<p>A great possession, no doubt, a fine possession, but just at that moment he
had it in his heart to change places with the humblest hind on his estate. He
had an uneasy feeling that he was being made a puppet in the great game of
financial chess which Saltburn was playing, but the reflection brought no
consolation to him. He could see now how foolish he had been; he could see no
palliation for his conduct.</p>
<p>Just for one moment trees and sky and earth and air seemed blended in one
whirling mist, then his brain cleared again and he crept on, trembling
strangely in every limb. A nausea gripped him, a kind of physical sickness that
he had never felt before.</p>
<p>He put all these painful thoughts away from him with an effort. There was
something like a smile on his face as he walked into the drawing-room where
Lady Edna and Philip Saltburn were seated. A clock somewhere was chiming the
hour of eleven with the sound of silver bells. Lady Edna more or less
successfully concealed a yawn beneath her hand.</p>
<p>"You are very late," she said. "We have been wondering what had become of
you. I am quite sure that Mr. Saltburn is getting tired of my society."</p>
<p>"You don't really mean that," Saltburn replied. "In any case, one would be a
long time before one tired of a place like Borne Abbey."</p>
<p>Lady Edna hesitated a minute, then she held out her hand as she said good
night to Saltburn. He rose, in his turn, and asked his host to excuse him.</p>
<p>"Late hours do not agree with me," he said. "You won't think me rude if I go
to bed, will you? No, thank you, I won't take anything. I make it a rule to
touch nothing after dinner. I think you said breakfast at half-past eight."</p>
<p>Sherringborne murmured his regrets politely. At the same time he was
relieved that there was no necessity to sit there opposite his young guest
making conversation. He wanted to be alone now. He longed for the seclusion of
the library where he could think matters out. There were details in connection
with the lamentable suicide of El Murid which he was aching to hear. It might
be possible at this late hour to get some information from London.</p>
<p>He walked over restlessly in the direction of the telephone, he would call
up Sir James Pallisser and see if the Premier knew anything. As he stood there
with his listless hand upon the receiver, the bell of the telephone purred
rapidly and so startlingly and unexpectedly that Sherringborne fell back. He
could hardly recognise his own voice as he asked the usual question. Then there
came above the humming of the wires the soft, smooth utterance of Sir James
Pallisser himself.</p>
<p>"Is that you, Sherringborne?" he asked. "Oh, it is. I am very glad to have
got you. Are you doing anything particular to-morrow? You are not. Oh, very
well. I beg your pardon. Oh, yes. Well, I want to see you pretty badly, and I
should like to bring Grant and Featherstone with me. I got my secretary to send
a note round to the papers saying that we are spending the week-end at Borne
Abbey. I suppose you can put us all up?"</p>
<p>"Delighted," Sherringborne said huskily.</p>
<p>"Yes, I thought you wouldn't mind. After all, there is nothing significant
in the fact that two or three of us are spending a week-end with you. We'll
motor down early to-morrow."</p>
<p>"Is there anything seriously wrong?" Sherringborne asked.</p>
<p>"Seriously, do you say? Oh, yes, I am afraid so. I suppose you haven't heard
that El Murid is dead&mdash;committed suicide, poor fellow. Oh, you know it, do
you? Who told you? De la Croisa? Very strange how the Baron gets hold of
everything. I suppose he didn't happen to know any of the circumstances of the
case. I am afraid it is a bad business altogether. If there was one honest man
connected with Tortina it was El Murid. And I am very much afraid he has been
speculating deeply with public money."</p>
<p>"Never," Sherringborne whispered. "Never."</p>
<p>"Ah, well," the voice at the other end of the 'phone said. "You knew the man
intimately. Far better than I did. But can't you see this is a most unpleasant
business for us?"</p>
<p>Still Sherringborne said nothing. He might have spoken then and saved
himself many a sleepless hour, but he could not unburden himself over the
wire.</p>
<p>"I shall see you to-morrow," he said. "And then we shall be able to go into
the matter, thoroughly."</p>
<p>"You are right there," the Premier replied.</p>
<p>"Between ourselves, I believe that Saltburn is at the bottom of the whole
business. Oh, may I bring him with me to-morrow?"</p>
<p>"By all means," Sherringborne said, and hoped that his voice conveyed
nothing to his listener.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;"THE TENTH TRANSMITTER OF A FOOLISH FACE."</h2>
<p>Lady Edna protested against the whole thing indignantly. There was reproach
even in the way she handed her father his breakfast coffee. Sherringborne had
passed a restless night, and, in consequence, made no appearance at the
breakfast table until the others had finished. Already Philip Saltburn had set
out to explore the park, so that father and daughter were alone.</p>
<p>"I think it is great presumption on Sir James's part," Lady Edna said
coldly. "Of course, one is always glad to see him and Mr. Grant and Mr.
Featherstone. But, really, Sir James had no right to ask that other man down.
It is not fair to me. Fancy expecting me to entertain Mr. Saltburn."</p>
<p>"There are worse catastrophes," Sherringborne said wearily.</p>
<p>"My dear father, this isn't a catastrophe, it's an outrage. It has always
been our boast that no people of that sort have ever entered the doors of Borne
Abbey&mdash;at least, I don't mean it is exactly a boast, because the
Cranwallises are not given to that kind of thing. We have simply ignored people
of Mr. Saltburn's type."</p>
<p>"You don't understand," Sherringborne said with an air of one who is
addressing an intelligent child. "There is a serious crisis which may have an
effect on the Government itself. There is trouble in Tortina and El Murid, the
only man we could trust there, has committed suicide."</p>
<p>"Oh, I am grieved," Lady Edna said. "Such a nice man, too. And quite an
Englishman in his way. The last time he was here he was telling me of some
boyish adventures you and he had together when you were at Eton. He was such a
splendid shot, too. But why do you look at me like that? Surely there is
nothing really wrong?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid so," Sherringborne murmured.</p>
<p>"It looks to me very like a big disgrace. Murid was bold and over
sanguine&mdash;just the sort of man who would deliberately take his chances and
reckon on his revolver in the case of failure. He was a fatalist, too. I am
afraid, Edna, there is going to be a great deal of trouble over this. Of
course, you don't understand business, but there are many millions of English
money in Tortina securities which most people will now regard as hopelessly
lost. It is a hopeless tangle, and I can't explain to you how this new bother
between the United States and Japan is likely to seriously affect many innocent
people in England. I suppose that is why Pallisser is bringing Saltburn down
here. For the most part we are perfect children in such matters, and I expect
Saltburn is going to explain."</p>
<p>Lady Edna was silent, if not convinced. After all said and done, her father
occupied a great public position, and it was no more than his duty to see that
these poor people were not robbed; but, on the other hand, the more thought of
William Saltburn's presence there was an outrage on her dignity and self
respect.</p>
<p>She had seen the man once in a London drawing-room, she had been repelled by
his strong, heavy face, and the boom of his voice. He had seemed to dominate
everybody there, he had held the whole room with a magnetism of a strong, and,
so Edna thought, brutal nature. He had been a new type to this haughty young
aristocrat, a repellant, fascinating kind, in form something between a shark
and a tiger. She had wondered why one born to the purple like the Duchess of
Cantyre could possibly have tolerated such a creature as Saltburn. And now he
was actually coming down here, to Borne Abbey, above all places in the
world.</p>
<p>"Very well, father," she said with proud humility. "Of course, I will do my
best to make myself civil to the man. It will only be for a few hours at the
outside. It is very fortunate that there are no women guests here, so that
there will be no necessity for me to come in to dinner. As the dinner will be
more or less political, you won't want me."</p>
<p>Sherringborne accepted the compromise eagerly enough. His career as a
statesman had taught him the value of the compromise, and he was in no mood
then for anything in the nature of a fight.</p>
<p>It was past the luncheon hour; indeed, it was nearly tea-time before two
motor cars drew up under the great archway of the Abbey and the expected guests
alighted. Lady Edna stood in the hall to receive them, smiling and gracious, so
far as Pallisser and his colleagues were concerned. She swept Saltburn a frigid
bow, and did not appear to see his outstretched hand. But she noticed the
blunt, thick fingers clearly enough, she saw the coarse nails that had been
bitten to the quick, and the fact was not lost upon her that Saltburn's palm
was none too clean.</p>
<p>But if he felt anything he gave no sign, but stood there, a short square
figure, with a hard red face and grim mouth, smiling with a certain cynical
approval that had something of the auctioneer about it.</p>
<p>"Nice place you've got here, Sherringborne," he said. "Ah, Phil, how are
you? Enjoying yourself, my lad? After all said and done, there's nothing like a
fine old English home. I should like to wash my hands, Sherringborne, I suppose
I can."</p>
<p>Lady Edna shivered. A wave of crimson swept over her face. She set her
little teeth together with her eyes on Philip Saltburn. She noticed he was
smiling to himself as if something amused him. She made a gesture in the
direction of the bell.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't ring on my account, missie," Saltburn said. "I can find my way.
There is a lavatory at the back of the great staircase, isn't there?"</p>
<p>"How do you know that," Sherringborne asked. "You've never been here
before."</p>
<p>Just for a moment Saltburn showed signs of confusion.</p>
<p>"Oh, I must have read about it, I suppose," he said. "Once show me a house,
and I could go over it blindfold a year after-wards. Come along with me, Phil,
and give me a lead in case I make a mistake."</p>
<p>Philip Saltburn followed obediently enough. He stood while Saltburn stripped
off his coat and bared a pair of arms that would have done justice to a navvy.
He plunged his red face into the marble basin, and scrubbed himself until that
coarse skin of his shone again. Then he turned to his son with a certain
unmistakable pride and affection. He was proud of Philip, proud of his style
and his manner, and of the friends that he made. But it was characteristic of
the man that he never said so.</p>
<p>"Well, how are you getting on?" he asked. "Topping place this, isn't it?
Handsome gel, too. That's the type of woman you want, old chap; that's the
class you've got to marry into. Get hold of one of the first flight and settle
down and found a family. You needn't worry about money&mdash;I'll see to that.
You'll find her devilish stand-offish, of course, but I like that
sort&mdash;dash it, there is an atmosphere about the whole place you can't buy.
No change whatever in the last fifty years, except the electric light, and that
is an improvement."</p>
<p>Philip looked inquiringly at his father.</p>
<p>"But you've never been here before," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, haven't I?" the financier said. "It's a dead secret, my boy, but you
had to know it sooner or later, and that's one of the reasons why I came down
here to-day. Fifty years ago I was in the kitchen here. I cleaned the boots, my
son. I used to regard the butler in those days as a much bigger man than
Sherringborne. But that's all between you and me, and need never go any
further. Look here, Phil, when I was a boy here I was a bit of a poacher. Only
a rabbit or two, for the sport of the thing, but they got hold of me, and they
gave me six months. That turned me against the whole tribe. When I came out I
swore I'd be even with them some day, and, by the Lord Harry! it's coming true.
I've got Sherringborne and Borne Abbey in the hollow of my hands. I can smash
'em like an eggshell if I like. But that's not my game. When you were born I
swore that you should some day marry the present man's daughter, and, by
Heaven, you shall. When I saw you and Lady Edna side by side just now that old
dream came back. We'll humble her pride, my boy, we'll show her what a power
William Saltburn is. Bring her nose down to the grindstone and make her
grateful to know that a fine young chap like Philip Saltburn is ready to pick
her up again. But, of course, if you've got your eye on somebody
else&mdash;"</p>
<p>Philip Saltburn smiled.</p>
<p>"That's just like you," he said. "You think that you and your money can do
everything."</p>
<p>"By Gad, you're right there," the financier cried. He worried his thick mat
of hair with a pair of brushes; his coarse features shone as if they had been
varnished. "You can do anything with money. But what do you think of the young
woman? Is it good enough? Will she do?"</p>
<p>"My dear father," Philip protested. "You speak as if I was going to buy a
horse."</p>
<p>"Well, it's much the same thing, isn't it? You'll have to put it on a
business footing or the girl won't look at you. Oh, I know these swells. It'll
have to be a bargain, my boy, and one she can't possibly wriggle out of. That's
the way we do things in the city."</p>
<p>Philip listened with disgust and a feeling of despair. He knew it was almost
impossible to bring his father round to his own view, but, at any rate, he must
try, unless the ruins of his hopes were to lie about his feet.</p>
<p>"Lady Edna is charming," he said. "It isn't only her beauty that attracts
me, it's her mind as well. She's a class apart, a survival, if you like, but an
exquisite survival, and if I am fortunate enough to win her for my wife I shall
regard myself as one of the luckiest of men."</p>
<p>William showed his strong teeth in a grin. "Then, dash it all, you shall
marry her," he said. "Never mind what she says, I shall come in at the proper
time."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;FLINT AND STEEL.</h2>
<p>Philip Saltburn fairly winced. He was fond enough of his father, he admired
his many sterling qualities, but that brutal bluntness jarred him terribly now.
There were many ways of arriving at the definite issue without that crudeness
of speech which was almost a vice, as far as the capitalist was concerned.</p>
<p>He had been a successful man all his life, he was used to giving and taking
blows, and he loved to fight for the pure joy of it. With him finesse and
diplomacy were mere symbolic, and, because of this, he had gone direct to the
point.</p>
<p>And, with it all, he had an almost boundless ambition. No man knew better
the value of money, and money to him meant power, and nothing else. Personally,
his habits were the simplest, and he could work for fourteen hours at a stretch
on a biscuit and a cup of tea. He could smoke the best of cigars if they were
offered him, but, if there was no tobacco to be had, it was all the same to
him. Nothing mattered except money and good health, and the ability to lay out
his millions to the best advantage.</p>
<p>He knew perfectly well that kings were powerless without it, and that an
army might be paralysed for the need of it. By the side of a great capitalist a
statesman or a general was a mere child. Money, money was everything. The time
would come when he and others of his clan would be masters of the world, and
they were showing it now in the way in which they were engineering that
embroglio in Tortina. And Saltburn was perfectly frank in his aim&mdash;he
talked of it in the hall at tea-time, he discussed it until the dinner bell
rang. It was nothing to him that Lady Edna sat regarding him with a certain
contemptuous disdain. The long purple lash swept her cheek as she listened,
merely tolerating this crude specimen of humanity, and Philip writhed uneasily
as he saw what was passing through her mind. He was a shrewd young man enough
in his way, he knew the great world and its traditions far better than his
father, and he was not blind to the fact that the noisy capitalist was doing
his cause more harm than good.</p>
<p>For William Saltburn, from Lady Edna's point of view, would have been a
terrible and monstrous affliction in the way of a father-in-law. It seemed to
Philip that he could see these thoughts in the sleepy droop of her eyelids, and
the slightly disdainful curve of her lips as she listened. He was glad enough
when the first dinner bell rang and that big voice ceased to magnetise
Saltburn's fellow guests.</p>
<p>Sir James Pallisser seemed to be frankly amused. Sherringborne was absorbed
in a reverie, and the other two Government members listened with a boredom that
they were at no pains to conceal. Occasionally Saltburn's keen eye flashed over
them. His mode of address was contemptuously familiar and his opinion of them
too thinly veiled. Lady Edna rose and Philip followed to open the door for
her.</p>
<p>"I will get you to excuse me," she said. "It will be better, perhaps, if I
do not come down to dinner. You are going to talk politics, and politics always
give me a headache. They seem to lead to nothing but argument."</p>
<p>Sherringborne came out of his reverie.</p>
<p>"There will be seven of us altogether," he said. "I have asked de la Croisa
to come over, Pallisser."</p>
<p>"I am glad to hear it," the Premier said heartily. "I always enjoy a chat
with the Baron. Do you happen to know him, Mr. Saltburn? A most charming and
entertaining companion."</p>
<p>"I met him once," Saltburn said abruptly. "Old-fashioned, exploded type of
politician, sort of dancing master statesman. A man who would argue with
scrupulous politeness and call you out if you disputed his facts after-wards.
He's the man that made such a mess of Tortina. But for him we shouldn't have
had all this trouble between Japan and the States. Plenty of brains, but too
impulsive."</p>
<p>The last dinner bell rang out through the great house presently&mdash;the
one note of noise in that peaceful place where everything seemed to run on
oiled wheels, and where trouble and care had apparently no rest for the sole of
its foot. Saltburn took it all in as he came down the great marble staircase,
he saw the legendary pictures on the walls, the flesh pink statuary, and the
glowing cabinets, wrought by master hands. He saw the servants in their
resplendent liveries moving about the house silently and discreetly like an
army of soldiers in a fortress where discipline is the watchword of it all.</p>
<p>Yet, the air of it all, the nameless something which is so impressive, had
no effect upon him. He liked it, he admired it, he would have given a good
round sum of his beloved money to catch such an atmosphere in a home of his
own. But he could afford to leave all that presently to Philip and his future
daughter-in-law, Lady Edna Cranwallis. It was characteristic of the man that he
should regard this business as good as settled. He was in one of his most
amiable moods when the footman pushed up the big oak chair behind him, and he
unfolded his napkin.</p>
<p>Dinner was served in the great oak dining room, the walls of which were hung
with a Beauvais tapestry which had a history of its own. The shaded lights
twinkled in the fretted roof. There were points here and there in the darkness
where art treasures obtruded themselves with a certain discreetness which was
an art in itself. The table was decorated with gold and silver and flowers,
loose and moist and feathery. The well-trained servants moved silently, there
was no sound except the murmuring conversation round the dinner table. There
was an air and an environment here, a certain brooding of the spirit of the
centuries, which gave the entertainment a singular charm in the eyes of Philip
Saltburn.</p>
<p>He was interested in all the men about him, but most of all he was
interested in de la Croisa. The Baron was wearing the colour of an order round
his neck, the ribbon across his breast gleamed dully red. He knew something
about this man, of course, knew what de la Croisa might have been had he chosen
to be supple and court popular opinion. He knew that he was listening to a man
now, whose conversation was witty to a degree and whose converse sparkled with
epigrams. And he felt, too, that behind all the light some laughter de la
Croisa was watching all that was going on with the keen, discriminating eye of
a hawk.</p>
<p>So far as Philip could see, most of the conversation at the dinner table was
being monopolised by the Baron and his father. It was the same presently when
the long elaborate meal drew to a close and cigars were lighted. It was the
same again when a move was made to the drawing-room.</p>
<p>"We must not altogether forget our charming hostess," Sir James said.
"Sherringborne, if you don't mind, I should prefer to have my coffee in the
drawing-room."</p>
<p>Sherringborne did not appear to hear. The suggestion was repeated twice
before it conveyed itself to his intelligence.</p>
<p>"By all means, my dear fellow," he murmured. "What do you other people say?
Then come along."</p>
<p>Lady Edna looked up with a smile from the book she was reading. She sat in a
remote corner near a window, the curtains of which were not yet drawn, the
fading primrose light of the July evening fell upon her face. Philip Saltburn
crossed over to her. Sooth to say, he was just a little tired of the rasping
boom of his father's voice. It seemed to him that that dominating personality
was singularly out of place here. The room was large enough to get away almost
outside the region of Saltburn's environment. Philip could see now that Lady
Edna was regarding his father somewhat as if she were a naturalist with a new
specimen on the plate of a microscope.</p>
<p>"What are you reading?" he asked.</p>
<p>"An autobiography," Lady Edna explained. "It is the life story of a
successful man, a man who made his way from the ranks&mdash;that is, a
capitalist. I always had a weakness for natural history."</p>
<p>"The type is new to you?" Philip asked quietly.</p>
<p>Lady Edna smiled as her eyes were turned in William Saltburn's
direction.</p>
<p>"It was," she said demurely.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;AFTER THE COFFEE.</h2>
<p>The room was faintly tinged with the fragrance of coffee. Then it seemed to
Philip that Lady Edna was paying scant attention to what he was saying. She was
listening, and yet not listening, to what was going on at the other end of the
room. De la Croisa was speaking now, he lay back in an arm-chair, his legs
crossed, his long, thin finger-tips pressed together. Once more the talk had
drifted into a duel between de la Croisa and Saltburn.</p>
<p>"You are not altogether a fool," Saltburn said approvingly.</p>
<p>"Ah, I thank you," the Baron responded. "Quite so, my friend. According to
this shrewd judge, I am not the fool he took me for. Behold, it is a great
compliment to the poor old failure who has to take refuge in growing roses. It
takes brains to grow roses. But that is a mere detail. And now, my friend
Saltburn, with your permission, I will ask you a question. You say that the
Tortina Islands business should be left to the financiers?"</p>
<p>"Only an idiot could suggest anything else," Saltburn said bluntly.</p>
<p>"Meaning yourself, perhaps?" the Baron asked blandly.</p>
<p>"With Van Troop of New York, we could settle it in a day. It's largely a
question of bluff after all. These things always are. But we shall have to be
trusted."</p>
<p>De la Croisa twinkled like a child.</p>
<p>"And Japan?" he asked. "The innocent Jap? Ah, you would not take advantage
of those children at Tokio, and all the cards would be on the table, of
course?"</p>
<p>De la Croisa spoke lightly, almost flippantly, yet the eyes which he turned
upon Saltburn had a challenge in them. Saltburn's red face turned a shade
crimson. He mopped his huge forehead.</p>
<p>"That is a clever shot," he said.</p>
<p>"No, my friend, it was no shot at all. You go soon to Tokio to see the
Emperor, you will have to explain to him how it is that South America has
seized this opportunity to make trouble. It is very unfortunate for us that
poor El Murid is out of the way because he might have thrown a lurid light upon
this complication. The Emperor will be annoyed, he will probably scent a breach
of faith. It is possible that he may say that you have brought this about for
your own purposes. He may remark that Santa Anna is a poor man or that he was a
poor man till a comparatively recent date, in fact, there is no end to the
things the Emperor may say to you. But on these things it will be possible to
speak more plainly when we have seen El Murid's private papers. You made a bad
debt there, Mr. Saltburn."</p>
<p>"Put it plainly," Saltburn said. "You might just as well accuse me
openly&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah, a thousand pardons," de la Croisa said in tones of exquisite
politeness. "You mistake me. I am grieved, I am desolated. Let me hasten to say
that I make no accusation against anybody. I merely stated that our late friend
El Murid was deeply in your debt, and that it was impossible to get to the
bottom of it until his papers came to be overhauled. Then we shall see many
things. I&mdash;the poor broken-down public servant with nothing but my roses
and my cottage&mdash;tell you so. And there is going to be trouble in
Washington. There is going to be trouble everywhere. Now, Mr. Saltburn, here is
the chance to show your power. If I were a great capitalist, do you know what I
should do? I should say to him&mdash;"</p>
<p>Saltburn was leaning eagerly forward to listen now. His wide lips were
parted, there was a fine perspiration on his forehead. Then de la Croisa broke
into a gay laugh.</p>
<p>"Well, go on," Saltburn said impatiently, "I am listening. I don't often pay
anyone the compliment of doing that."</p>
<p>"Ah, no," de la Croisa exclaimed. "Possibly I have already said too much.
But if I had those papers&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah, El Murid's, eh? I don't mind telling you I have seen to that. A friend
of yours, wasn't he?"</p>
<p>"He was at Eton with our host and myself," de la Croisa explained. "An
honest, straightforward man, and a capital sportsman. Isn't that so
Sherringborne?"</p>
<p>But Sherringborne did not appear to be listening. There was a strangely
vacant look in his eyes, his lips were twitching. De la Croisa asked the
question twice before Sherringborne's eyes were turned in his direction.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," he said. His voice was strained and hard, yet with a peculiar
tremble in it that caused Sir James Pallisser to turn in his direction. "Oh,
yes," he went on, "it was a chaffinch's nest with three eggs in it. Now, don't
you think it is a singular fact that a chaffinch should build a nest in a
candlestick? But you can see for yourselves there it is! A nest made of moss
and horsehair, right under one of those branches."</p>
<p>"Good heavens! Sherringborne," Sir James exclaimed. "What's the matter? What
are you talking about? Here, hold up."</p>
<p>But Sherringborne had fallen forward, his head hanging on his breast. All
the light of life and reason seemed to have gone out of his eyes now. He was an
old, old man, suddenly senile and broken.</p>
<p>"Can't you see it for yourself?" he asked petulantly. "It is there yonder,
on the candlestick, and it is full of El Murid's papers. You must get those
papers for me, Pallisser, take them out of the nest when the bird is not
looking. If I don't get them I am ruined. I shall be disgraced."</p>
<p>He lifted his head suddenly, his eyes shining now with a new and restless
fire.</p>
<p>"You must listen to me, my lords," he said. "I desire to crave your
indulgence for a minute. For the last twenty years I have sat in your
lordship's house. I have played a prominent part in the Councils of the Nation,
and I must confess that this accusation has taken me entirely by surprise.
Because I am not guilty my lords. For five hundred years there have been
Cranwallises at Borne Abbey, and until the present moment&mdash;"</p>
<p>He broke off again, half-conscious of the horrified looks of those around
him. They stood, one or another, as if to shield him from the eyes of his
daughter. Lady Edna lay back in her chair talking quietly to Philip Saltburn,
utterly unconscious of the ghastly tragedy which was being played only a few
feet away.</p>
<p>"Pull them out, I say," Sherringborne said, querulously. "Pull the papers
out of the chaffinch's nest. Do you hear, Pallisser? I shall be ruined, and the
Government will be disgraced, and all because&mdash;because&mdash;El Murid's
letters&mdash;the letters I wrote to him."</p>
<p>There was a silence, long and slow and painful. In the recess by the window
Lady Edna sat chatting with Philip. The murmur of his voice reached the others,
it seemed strangely inconsequent, so hideously out of place. It was as well,
perhaps, that most of the lights there were shaded, that it was only possible
for those close to him to see the ghastly, twitching greyness of
Sherringborne's face. In the presence of a tragedy like this the little group
standing round it seemed to be paralysed. Even William Saltburn had no
suggestion to make, he could only regard his host with an expression of mingled
pity and contempt.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Pallisser whispered to de la Croisa. "Do you know anything,
Baron? Can you think of the cause of this dreadful business? What had we better
do?"</p>
<p>De la Croisa shook his head. He could explain, no doubt, but in the presence
of Saltburn he was silent.</p>
<p>"It is only conjecture, my dear Sir James," he said. "So far as I can see
there is only one thing to be done, and that is to send for a doctor without
delay. There is some serious brain trouble here&mdash;the result of a mental
shock, I should say."</p>
<p>"What were we talking about?" Sherringborne went on in the same curious
shrill treble. "What was the subject under discussion? I can't think of
anything. Oh, yes, El Murid and those papers, and the nest&mdash;the nest."</p>
<p>He said no more, for suddenly the left side of his face drew up with a
hideous contortion, his left hand hung limply by his side. Then, very slowly,
he dropped to his knees, and lay on the carpet. He was breathing stentoriously
now, the ghastly pallor on his cheeks had given place to a dull mottled
redness.</p>
<p>"By heavens, he is dead," Featherstone cried. "What fools we are to stand
gaping like this. Lady Edna!"</p>
<p>She had heard, for, on the spur of the moment Featherstone had called out
the words with a hoarse horror; they rang from one end of the saloon to the
other. Lady Edna's book slipped from her fingers, and went crashing to the
floor. She came across the room now swiftly, her dress trailing behind her, her
face all soft and tender and apprehensive. She took in at a glance what had
happened; there was no occasion to ask any questions.</p>
<p>Just for the moment her brain moved half-unconsciously, for she was not used
to trouble, and it had come upon her all too swiftly.</p>
<p>She was trying to tell herself that her father had been suddenly stricken
down, and that for the first time in her life she was face to face with death.
She knelt there all heedless of her dress, she raised the limp, grey head, and
rested it on her knee. There were tears in her eyes now, her lips were
trembling as she glanced up at the little group standing round her.</p>
<p>"How did it happen?" she murmured. "But why do I waste time asking
questions? Sir James, will you ring the bell and ask them to send for a doctor
at once; and don't you think it would be as well to lift my poor father on to a
sofa? Shorland ought to be sent for, too."</p>
<p>"We will hope," Pallisser murmured, "we will hope, Lady Edna, that it is not
so serious as all that."</p>
<p>"Oh, but it is. You know that it is&mdash;I can see that by the expression
of your face. Please ring the bell."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.&mdash;"BUT YET A WOMAN."</h2>
<p>The household was all in commotion now. It was as if the oiled wheels had
left the track, as if the whole perfect machinery had fallen out of gear. There
were sounds of voices in the house, a confused murmur of servants as they
hurried from room to room, and, above it all, the sharp incongruous note of the
telephone bell.</p>
<p>They had the stricken man upstairs now. He was lying partially undressed on
his bed, still breathing stentoriously. The mottled red on his face had struck
a deeper purple hue. Downstairs in the drawing-room, William Saltburn stood by
the fireplace, his hands behind his back, reckoning up his chances. He was the
only one there who did not seem in the least impressed by the tragedy. By his
side stood Philip, tugging irresolutely at his moustache. So far as he was
concerned he was profoundly shocked and impressed. He was recalling other
conversations which had led up to the distressing scene which he had lately
witnessed. He had more than an uneasy impression that his father was at the
bottom of the whole ghastly business.</p>
<p>"What do you think of it?" William Saltburn asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know," Philip murmured. "It is all so unutterably sad. It seems an
awful thing for the master of all this to be fighting for this life upstairs
like an ordinary human being."</p>
<p>"Common lot," Saltburn exclaimed. "Got to come to us all sooner or later.
What has become of the Baron? Has he gone home? Do you know I should like to
get hold of that chap&mdash;just the sort of man I could make use of. Poor,
isn't he? They tell me he lives in a little cottage here on about a pound a
week. Funny idea for a man of his ability. But those Latins are rum chaps when
their vanity is touched. Anyway, I'd give a hundred thousand pounds if I could
get de la Croisa to place his services at my disposal. And you can tell him so
if you like. You get on better with that class of old swell than I do."</p>
<p>"I should be sorry to," Phillip murmured. "I should expect the Baron to run
me through the body. But, look here, father, is there really anything in this
Tortina business? I don't want to be personal, but if our host is in trouble
through dabbling in some scheme of yours, why&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You mind your own business," Saltburn growled. "Don't you come meddling in
things you don't understand. Your game is to play pretty and make yourself
agreeable to the ladies."</p>
<p>Philip stood there, profoundly dissatisfied. He might have said more, only
the door opened at that moment, and de la Croisa came in.</p>
<p>"I think he is a bit better now," he said in answer to Philip's inquiry.
"The doctor has come, and the first thing he did was to turn us all out of the
room. Lady Edna would like to speak to you, Mr. Philip. You will find her in
the library."</p>
<p>Philip needed no second bidding. He closed the door quietly behind him,
leaving the Baron and his father confronting each other. Saltburn's red,
aggressive face was strongly combative now. The Baron was regarding him through
narrowed eyelids, his glance appeared to sparkle like steel.</p>
<p>"Well, are you satisfied?" he asked. "My dear Mr. Saltburn, there are times
when it is necessary to sink the method of diplomacy and give nature a chance.
It would be foolish on my part to close my eyes to what has taken place
to-night. Tell me, why you should go out of your way to make all this trouble
with my old friend Sherringborne. Surely he has done you no harm?"</p>
<p>"That is not the question," Saltburn responded.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not. But it is important from my point of view. This, I presume, is
what you call business. There are people like myself who could give it quite
another name. Fifty or sixty years ago when gentlemen settled their differences
in a proper and orthodox manner I should have been compelled to call you out
for this. I should have had infinite satisfaction in running you through the
body and subsequently repairing to my cottage with a clear conscience. But now
it is the fashion to employ lawyers to do these things for one. Still, it is an
easy negotiation after all. You have only to revert to your original scheme
with regard to the finances of my friend Santa Anna. Do you follow me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm all there," Saltburn said bluntly. "I am ready to answer to the
crack of the whip if you can find it. But can you find it? In the hands of
Japan&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear friend," the Baron said softly, his eyes were half-closed now, he
appeared to be examining the painted ceiling with critical approval, "my dear
friend, is there not a Scotch poet who sings that there are hills beyond
Pentland and seas beyond Firth? It is precisely the same with international
politics. It is well for you to shield yourself behind that plea that this new
policy on Japan's part calls for reconsideration of your position. But it is
just possible that there are forces which may induce the Mikado to take another
view of the matter. Now, in all your travels, have you ever been as far as
Japan?"</p>
<p>Saltburn looked frankly puzzled. He was phenomenally quick at grasping a
point, but palpably he was at sea here. And he did not like the cynical
superiority of the Baron's smile.</p>
<p>"No, I haven't," he said. "I believe it is a beautiful country all the same.
And certain to go ever farther than it has."</p>
<p>"Aye, and that before long, too," the Baron said with a sudden change of
voice. "I suppose you have heard of the Prince Ito? He is at present in London,
and&mdash;now, my dear friend, do you want me to say more?"</p>
<p>Something like an oath broke from Saltburn's lips. He began to understand
now the power and significance of the force which was arrayed against him.</p>
<p>"I haven't thought of that," he muttered. "Strange as it may seem. Ito had
never entered my calculations for a moment. And I have never met the Prince.
Have you?"</p>
<p>"He is a friend of mine, of course. They are all friends of mine, Mr.
Saltburn. Ah, the old man tending his roses in his country garden is not
entirely forgotten yet. I don't want to interfere with your plans, but, I
think, I really think, my friend, that this sad business will be settled on an
amicable basis yet. A true patriot like yourself&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Patriotism be hanged," Saltburn broke out furiously. "It's only the fool
and the socialist who prates of patriotism. And you may be assured of one
thing&mdash;whatever happens&mdash;"</p>
<p>Saltburn's strident voice died away in a growl as the door opened, and
Pallisser, accompanied by the others, came in. De la Croisa lifted his eyebrows
interrogatively.</p>
<p>"Very bad," the Premier said. "Very bad indeed. The symptoms are exceedingly
grave, and fresh complications may supervene at any moment. On the other hand,
it is just possible that Sherringborne may be comparatively himself within a
week. But it would be criminal to be too sanguine. Featherstone, I wonder if
you would lend Lady Edna your car? She has taken it into her head that she
would like to fetch Shorland herself."</p>
<p>"What, alone?" Featherstone asked significantly. "Of course she can have the
car with pleasure, but it would be far more advisable for one of us to go. You
see, Shorland is not the kind of man to put himself out for other people's
convenience. I don't suppose Lady Edna will approve of some of his associates
if he happens to be giving a supper-party or something of that kind, which is
exceedingly likely. I don't think&mdash;well, you know what I mean, Sir James.
Between ourselves, Shorland is a vicious young scamp, and as heartless and
selfish as they make them."</p>
<p>The Premier shook his head doubtfully. He had heard many of these stories,
which are usually the last to come to the ears of those most concerned. Lord
Sherringborne was aware that his son was reckless and extravagant. But of the
kind of life that he was leading Lady Edna knew nothing. She was entirely
outside a world of that kind. As the little group of men stood there debating
the point, Lady Edna came in.</p>
<p>"My father appears to be quieter now," she explained. "The doctor has asked
me to keep away as much as possible. He has managed to get hold of two nurses
who have just arrived. But, really, Shorland ought to know, he would be
terribly distressed and hurt if he thought that we were keeping him in the
dark." The others exchanged glances. "Of course, I know he is very wild and
foolish, but with all his faults he is devoted to his father and to me. I must
do something, Sir James, I really can't stay here. This inaction is positively
maddening. Do lend me your car, Lord Featherstone. I can be back again in two
or three hours at the outside."</p>
<p>Featherstone hesitated. He ventured to suggest that he should go
himself.</p>
<p>"It would be far better," he said, "for a man to undertake this thing."</p>
<p>But Lady Edna would have none of it, nothing would please her except that
she should undertake the journey personally. She was still pressing the point
home when Philip Saltburn came in. He was already dressed for a journey, he was
wearing a big motor-coat over his dress clothes. He seemed to have taken the
whole matter into his own hands as if it were the most natural thing in the
world.</p>
<p>"I have taken the liberty of borrowing your car, Featherstone," he said. "I
have managed to get Lord Shorland's address in London, and with any luck I
shall be back here by midnight. I understand that Lady Edna wants to go, but,
of course, that is out of the question. It is impossible."</p>
<p>Lady Edna flashed a challenge from moist eyes.</p>
<p>"I shall be glad of your assistance," she said, "but, all the same,
understand that I am going with you."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.&mdash;THE GLADES OF PLEASURE.</h2>
<p>There was no more to be said or done, for Lady Edna's voice had in it the
final accent.</p>
<p>Standing there, regarding her with a glance not altogether of approval,
Philip Saltburn was trying to persuade himself that this decision had not
filled him with pleasure. He had taken the whole thing into his hands in his
strong, capable way; it never occurred to him that Lady Edna might be anxious
to dispense with his services.</p>
<p>But she said nothing further; she hurried out of the room, only to return a
moment or two later equipped for the journey. It was a fine, still night, with
the moon riding high in the heavens; there was no occasion for anything
extraordinary in the way of warm clothing.</p>
<p>They were slipping along the country lanes presently, the great car moving
noiselessly at something over 30 miles an hour. The clear, white light of the
moon shone on Lady Edna's face, and Philip could see how soft and tender it
looked now. From the first he had admitted Lady Edna's beauty, but now there
was an added womanliness to it which gave her a new charm in his eyes. It was
gratifying to him to find that she had these moods, that, after all, she was
nothing more than a woman with all a woman's weakness and charm.</p>
<p>"You are bearing it bravely," he murmured.</p>
<p>"I hope so," Lady Edna replied. There was no note of scorn in her voice now,
she did not resent the pity, which at any other time would have called for
contempt. "You see, it is so new to me. I have never had a great trouble
before, and my mother died before I was old enough to understand things."</p>
<p>"You don't remember her?" Saltburn asked. "Very little. She was quiet and
self-contained&mdash;so very different to Shorland and myself. I think that was
my father's only trouble, too&mdash;till this one."</p>
<p>Philip seemed to understand. He had heard of Lord Sherringborne's
marriage&mdash;that it had been merely a matter of family convenience, and that
the death of his wife was no more than a source of profound regret to him. All
his life had been arranged for him, everything had gone smoothly, and that was
why, perhaps, he had gone down before the first great catastrophe which had
come so unexpectedly into the sphere of his well ordered existence.</p>
<p>There are some natures to whom trouble is insupportable, and apparently
Sherringborne's was one of these. Philip wondered to himself if Lady Edna
guessed how deep the wound was, and how sore the trouble was likely to be. He
wondered if she had contemplated even for a moment the suggestion of disgrace
to the noble house of Cranwallis for the shadow of a sinister catastrophe to
smirch its proud escutcheon. But though Lady Edna's face was sad and the tears
welled into her fine eyes, there was no suggestion of this upon her features.
She seemed to be wrapped up entirely in her consideration for her father. She
spoke as to the way in which the news was to be broken to Shorland, she
pictured him as helping her to sustain her trouble.</p>
<p>In spite of the depth of his sincerity, Philip smiled grimly. He knew
something of the kind of life that Shorland was leading. He had heard the
various stories. He was acquainted by sight at any rate, with some of
Shorland's choice associates. He only hoped that to-night might prove an
exception to the rule, and that Lord Sherringborne's heir might be found in
comparatively respectable company. It was, at best, but a remote contingency,
and when at length the lights of London began to twinkle in sight Philip began
to regret that he had not come on his errand alone.</p>
<p>The mere fact of it being Sunday night was in Shorland's disfavour. London
was comparatively empty, too, most of the great houses in the West were closed,
so that Shorland would be more or less compelled to seek his recreation in the
half-world which appears to hold so strange a fascination for the guilded youth
of his kin.</p>
<p>It was exactly as Philip feared. The discreet man-servant at Shorland's
rooms confessed an utter ignorance as to his master's movements. A few words
from Philip, direct and to the point seemed to refresh his memory. He thought
but he was not quite sure, that his lordship was supping with a few friends at
the "Caversham." Philip groaned in spirit.</p>
<p>"I wish you would stay here, Lady Edna, and let me go to the 'Caversham'
alone," he said. "It is not exactly the place where you would feel at ease. Oh,
I don't mean to say that it isn't well conducted. But you will understand what
I mean."</p>
<p>It was apparent from the inquiring look in Lady Edna's eyes that she didn't.
Of this phase of existence she knew nothing. The glades of pleasure were but a
name to her, her only impression of them was derived from society novels, of a
certain class, and even these Lady Edna had been pleased to regard as a gross
libel on her set. She shook her head resolutely.</p>
<p>"I am sure my brother, would not frequent any place I could not go to," she
said. "You have been very kind and thoughtful so far, Mr. Saltburn. Surely you
are not going&mdash;"</p>
<p>Philip set his teeth together. After all, he had made his protest, and
perhaps it would be no great disadvantage in the long run for Lady Edna to
learn something about the ways of her brother and his mode of living. He
climbed back in the car again and gave orders to be driven straight to the
"Caversham."</p>
<p>London might have been empty as it pleased the great world to believe, but
there was no sign of any slackness of business either outside or inside the
"Caversham." The big dining-rooms were filled with people resplendent in
evening dress, there were women so daringly gowned that Lady Edna shrank back,
half ashamed, and wholly disdainful.</p>
<p>There were men here, the like of which she had not seen before, red-faced,
loudly-spoken men displaying a large amount of white shirt, and an overplus of
jewellery. The scene looked gay enough, the glades of pleasure appeared to
possess an attraction of their own, but with it all the gaiety was forced,
there was something that rang hollow in the laughter of the women and the mirth
of the men.</p>
<p>"I think you are right," Lady Edna faltered. "I ought to have allowed you to
come here alone. Still, now I am here&mdash;"</p>
<p>Philip asked to see the manager. He had a few words in private with that
functionary, then he came back with a grave air and a face stern and
disapproving.</p>
<p>"You had better go back to the car, Lady Edna," he said. "Your brother is
upstairs with a party that consists mainly, I understand, of ladies connected
with a theatrical company in which he is interested. There is also, I
understand, a Spanish woman&mdash;a wonderful dancer&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know," Lady Edna murmured. She flushed crimson to the roots of her
hair. "I&mdash;I have already heard of this woman, Ninon Garrados. But it is no
time to be particular, Mr. Saltburn. I am coming with you."</p>
<p>She swept up the crimson-carpeted stairs along the corridors which seemed
hot almost to the point of suffocation. It appeared quiet and decorous enough
here except when a door a little way off opened suddenly and a wild cackle of
laughter broke out and then stopped again as the door closed as if a lid had
been shut down on it.</p>
<p>Lady Edna shuddered. She half-hesitated for a moment, then went on with a
new courage and resolution. A waiter flung the door back and displayed a room
where half-a-score of people were supping. The lights on the table were
somewhat obscured by cigarette smoke, the flowers were already fading, and
across the white tablecloth was a splash of crimson where somebody had
overturned a decanter of wine.</p>
<p>It seemed to Lady Edna to be a panorama, a kind of dissolving view of smoke
and flowers and lights with a few vacuous, foolish, yet refined faces of men
peeping out here and there, and behind it the women, preening in all the
colours of the rainbow, a mass of gleaming necks and throats and shoulders, and
with it all that cackle of laughter that sounded too false and hollow, in a
word, theatrical. Saltburn strode resolutely into the room and grasped Shorland
by the shoulder. The latter's handsome face flushed with annoyance. His weak
mouth shaped itself into a forced defiance. His eyes were slightly blurred, he
swayed just a little as he rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"Now, don't make a scene," Saltburn said curtly. "Your sister is with me.
She insisted upon coming. Your father has had a paralytic stroke and he may be
dead at the present moment. We have a motor outside. Now come along."</p>
<p>The words seemed to cut through the thick atmosphere, the shrill scream of
laughter died away. A dazzlingly pretty woman with a mass or dark hair rose
from her seat and stood beside Shorland. Saltburn knew who she was perfectly
well. More than once he had seen Ninon Garrados, the dancer, who had made so
great an impression upon London. She was dainty and fascinating enough in her
way, but just then her eyes were a trifle hard. She smiled in Saltburn's
face.</p>
<p>"What is it Teddy?" she asked. "Oh, your father. Poor old gentleman. Had I
better come?"</p>
<p>Lady Edna's face flamed.</p>
<p>"Is the woman mad?" she said. "Don't you understand? Oh, to think that I
should ever have to stoop&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Drop that," Shorland stammered. "Dreadful shock to me, don't you know. But
you mustn't talk like that Edna, you must be more civil to this lady. Perhaps I
had better introduce you properly. Lady Edna Cranwallis&mdash;Lady Shorland.
Mr. Saltburn, let me present you to my wife!"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.&mdash;RUST AND MOTH.</h2>
<p>The scarlet flame on Lady Edna's face ebbed to a deadly whiteness. It seemed
as if some one had struck her an unexpected blow. All her pride seemed to have
left her for the moment. She stood there looking helplessly through the blue
wreaths of cigarette smoke at the gaudy butterflies collected round the table.
But, be that as it might, they were behaving decorously enough now. One or two
of them had risen, and with murmured regrets were making their way towards the
door. It seemed as if Lord Shorland had not yet grasped the full meaning of
Saltburn's words. And, apparently, Lady Edna had forgotten it in the face of
that tremendous statement of her brother's.</p>
<p>"This is an ill time to jest," she said.</p>
<p>"Who's jesting?" Shorland asked. He spoke with all the truculent fierceness
that is born of alcohol. "Do you mean to insult this lady?"</p>
<p>Lady Edna turned helplessly to Saltburn.</p>
<p>"I don't understand," she said. "I don't know what my brother means. And now
all those people have gone, perhaps you will try and get him to explain."</p>
<p>The room was quite empty by this time, except for the four people
interested. The others had faded away and for their consideration Saltburn felt
grateful.</p>
<p>"Your sister has asked you a question," he said.</p>
<p>"Who&mdash;who the devil are you?" Shorland asked abruptly. "And what have
you got to do with it. Some one I seem to have met before. One of my creditors,
I expect."</p>
<p>With a sudden spurt of rage Saltburn brought his hand down on Shorland's
shoulder. He could have strangled him cheerfully at that moment. But that he
was not altogether sober was no excuse in Saltburn's eyes. It seemed almost
incredible to believe that this weak and vacuous-looking youth with weak
irresolute face was the future Lord Sherringborne. It seemed strange that a
race of feudal lords like the Cranwallises with their long, honourable record
of soldier, priest and statesman should have produced a decadant like this. He
seemed to fit in well enough with this artificial atmosphere of wine and exotic
flowers and the acrid pungency of cigarettes.</p>
<p>He fairly winced now under Saltburn's grip.</p>
<p>"Pull yourself together man," the latter said. "Your father has had a
dangerous seizure and you must come at once if you wish to see him alive."</p>
<p>"Is that so?" Shorland asked. "Why didn't you say so before. And I know who
you are now. You are the Convict!"</p>
<p>"We will let it pass at that if you like," Saltburn said quietly. "You must
come at once. We have a car outside, and we can get back to Borne Abbey by
daylight."</p>
<p>Shorland raised no objection. He did not express the least regret or sorrow,
indeed, as yet, he was still obviously annoyed at this interruption of his
pleasure. He turned to the woman by his side more or less eagerly.</p>
<p>"You can come along, Ninon?" he said. Lady Edna seemed to freeze again.</p>
<p>"Is not this jest carried far enough?" she asked.</p>
<p>The famous dancer smiled. It seemed to Saltburn that she was enjoying the
situation. She was perfectly self-possessed.</p>
<p>"It is no jest," Shorland said with a dignity that would have been comical
under any other circumstances. "I tell you that this lady is my wife. We were
married yesterday morning. You'll see it for yourself in all the papers
to-morrow. Ninon, let me introduce you to my sister, Lady Edna. Edna, this is
Lady Shorland."</p>
<p>There was a certain weak dignity about it all which was sufficiently
amusing. Lady Edna stood there as if trying to get a grasp on the situation.
She was very white, there was a certain horror and disgust in her eyes, so
frank and undisguised that it brought a faint tinge of colour into the face of
the woman opposite. She could read Lady Edna like an open book, she knew
exactly what was passing in her mind. And she was not blind, either, to the
knowledge that she was mistress of the situation. She bowed and smiled, but she
made no attempt to extend her hand.</p>
<p>"You are naturally surprised," she said. "And perhaps somewhat disappointed.
Well, that is quite simple under the circumstances. Lady Edna, I am not
apologising, you understand. And I am sorry to hear this bad news of Lord
Sherringborne. I think in the circumstances, Ted, that I had better stay where
I am."</p>
<p>"You're coming along," Shorland said mulishly.</p>
<p>"I think not," Lady Shorland said. "Do please be reasonable. I shall be glad
enough to come down to Borne Abbey latter on, but just now I should be
decidedly in the way. I wish you good night, Lady Edna. Mr. Saltburn, do you
mind calling a cab for me?"</p>
<p>It was not at all badly done, as Saltburn was bound to admit. From his point
of view, she was no more than a brilliant insect that is bred on a dustheap,
but he was to change his opinion presently. Just now she shone in comparison
with Shorland, there was no denying the fact that she was behaving rather well.
At any rate, she was out of the way now, and Saltburn was able to return to his
companions. Shorland's mood appeared to have changed for he welcomed Saltburn
with a friendly smile.</p>
<p>"I thought I recognised you," he said. "I felt quite sure that you were the
Convict. Edna, Saltburn and myself were at Oxford together. We weren't in the
same set&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I hadn't that honour," Saltburn said quietly.</p>
<p>"Yes, we were a bit too rapid for you," Shorland said inanely. "Still, the
Convict isn't a bad sort. He got me out of a tight place once. By Jove, it's a
funny thing that you, above all men, should be here with my sister. Shows how
times change, doesn't it? And for myself, I don't care a rap about the class
distinction. If I find a chap or a woman who is amusin', I don't care a hang
where they are born. But hadn't we better get on?"</p>
<p>Saltburn was nothing loth. It was no easy matter for him to disguise the
contempt which he was feeling for this chattering popinjay who seemed to
realise nothing of the trouble which had fallen on his house. It was a relief
presently when Shorland went to sleep in the car and they heard no more from
him during the rest of the journey. Lady Edna sat there, pale and silent. It
was a long time before she spoke.</p>
<p>"You have been very good to me," she said. "I hardly know how to thank you.
I thought I had had trouble enough already. But I never expected a shameful
disclosure like this. I didn't know, either, that you had met my brother
before. I am afraid he was very rude to you."</p>
<p>"I don't think he intended to be," Saltburn said. "After all, he only called
me by the nickname by which I was known to my friends, and if you ask me what
that name means, I am afraid I can't tell you. I have an idea, of course, but
for the sake of my own peace of mind I have never inquired into the name too
closely."</p>
<p>With this Lady Edna had to be content. She was afraid in the same way that
the subject was distasteful to Saltburn and she felt sorry that she had alluded
to it. She was thankful enough presently when the wide, grey front of Borne
Abbey loomed out in the morning mists and the car pulled up at length.</p>
<p>Lord Sherringborne was no better and no worse. A couple of nurses were in
attendance upon him now, and the great specialist who had been hastily summoned
had passed his opinion. No doubt Lord Sherringborne had had a shock of some
kind, perhaps he was a little overworked. But on the other hand, his
constitution and the care he had taken of himself were in his favour, and if no
complications arose, there was no reason why he should not recover. But it
would be a long process, and, meanwhile, it was essential that he should be
kept quite quiet.</p>
<p>All these details Lady Edna derived from the Baron who had remained at Borne
Abbey pending her return. De la Croisa had slipped home for a bath and change,
and he looked now as fresh and alert as if he had had a sound night's
sleep.</p>
<p>He was full of kindly sympathy. He was only too ready and willing to do
anything that he could. And ever since Lady Edna could remember, de la Croisa
had been more or less like a second father to her. She allowed him to take
everything into his hands now, she concealed nothing from him. It was a matter
of deepest pain to her that Shorland should have accepted the situation with
such easy philosophy. He had expressed no regret, he had shown no feeling. On
the contrary, he had merely remarked that he was devilish tired, and that he
would be good for nothing till he had been to bed.</p>
<p>"I could have put up with the one trouble," Lady Edna said. "Trouble is
bound to come to us all sooner or later, dear Baron. But this disgrace is
terrible."</p>
<p>Baron de la Croisa started. Just for a moment he was afraid that Lady Edna
was referring to her father's trouble.</p>
<p>"Oh, I had quite forgotten," he said. "Saltburn told me. And so Shorland has
succeeded at last in crowning his folly. Saltburn tells me that he has actually
married the Spanish dancer. It is a queer world, my dear child, and you will be
surprised to hear that scores of well-bred young men will be disposed to regard
Shorland as what they term 'a devilish lucky chap.' He will be quite a hero in
his own set for some time. And, after all, it isn't a new thing. Our
aristocracy to-day is considerably embellished by recruits from the music-hall
stage. And the singular part of it is that these women make quite good wives.
Now, honestly speaking, don't you think that any woman is good enough for
Shorland?"</p>
<p>"But a dancer!" Lady Edna gasped. "A woman who displays her limbs to vulgar
people for so much a week. Oh! I don't deny that she is pretty and fascinating,
and I don't deny that she behaved quite well last night. She might have come
here with Shorland, and, though the temptation must have been great, she
declined. I suppose there are worse specimens of her class than Ninon
Garrados."</p>
<p>The Baron pricked up his ears.</p>
<p>"Oh. Ninon Garrados," he exclaimed. "I knew that there was a Spanish dancer,
of course, but, I wasn't aware that she was the Garrados. Our dear Shorland his
secured a greater prize than I thought. He has covered the family with glory.
Really, this is not so bad as it looked. There are several houses in England,
and quite great houses, too, where Ninon Garrados is a welcome guest."</p>
<p>Lady Edna lifted her shoulders scornfully.</p>
<p>"I suppose that is possible," she said. "I have read of such things. You
mean the houses where they entertain new millionaires&mdash;dreadful creatures
who do atrocious things at the table and are quite unacquainted to the use of
the fork. But those sort of people never come here. It's all very well of you,
my dear Baron, to take this cynical view of of it, but then, unfortunately for
me, I don't possess your sense of humour. I thought we had gone too far when
Mr. Saltburn was allowed to come here."</p>
<p>"Now, don't you say a word against him," the Baron said. "My dear Edna,
Philip Saltburn is a fine young fellow. And you have already told me yourself
how well he behaved last night. I understand that it is necessary for him to
stay in their neighbourhood a little longer, because he is negotiating in your
father's absence with your lawyers as to the sale of 'The Chantrey.'"</p>
<p>"I had forgotten that," Lady Edna said. "Indeed, I had hoped that my father
had changed his mind."</p>
<p>"Well, you see," the Baron said deliberately, "it is a matter of business
after all. And even people in the Earl of Sherringborne's position need money
to pay their debts. And I happen to know that our dear Shorland's little
amusements have been a great source of expense of late. Besides, your father
won't be able to think of business for months to come. And that being so, where
do you suppose the thousand or so a week to keep this place up is coming from?
I know it seems incredible that a girl in your position should need money, but
there it is. And that is why we are so anxious to get this matter of 'The
Chantrey' pushed through."</p>
<p>Lady Edna listened with an uneasy feeling that something had gone wrong in
the scheme of creation. She was learning her lesson rapidly enough now, but
these distracting elements, coming so swiftly on the top of one another,
disturbed her mental balance and left her for the first time in her life
anxious and uneasy.</p>
<p>"As you will," she said. "I suppose you mean that Mr. Saltburn had better
stay here?"</p>
<p>"No," de la Croisa said. "I don't suppose he would if you asked him. In
fact, he has already made arrangements to put up at the hotel. He is worth
making a friend of, Edna. I have a high opinion of that young man&mdash;despite
his father."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.&mdash;HEREDITY.</h2>
<p>It seemed to Shorland that he had a distinct grievance with the decrees of
Providence. In the first place, he hated the country, and could see no beauty
in Borne Abbey beyond its rent-roll and as a source of income for his rapid and
unwholesome pleasures. So long as the Earl remained in the present critical
condition it was imperative that Shorland should remain where he was.</p>
<p>It came as a shock to him, too, to find that at present, at any rate, it was
impossible for him to obtain any money. The first interview he had with the
family solicitor convinced him of that. The lawyer in question was somewhat of
an autocrat in his way, he belonged to the heredity of family attorneys, and he
possessed, moreover, an unpleasant habit of speaking his mind.</p>
<p>"It is utterly impossible my lord," he said. "I couldn't possibly go to the
length of guaranteeing you any further funds at present. I may remind you that
his lordship has twice within the last two years freed you at a cost of nearly
40,000 pounds. Lord Sherringborne is not a careful man, and your conduct is
seriously embarrassing. You have your own way of raising money."</p>
<p>"Not another penny," Shorland said. "The Jews are fighting shy of me just
now. I suppose I shall have to put up with it. But you really must let me have
a couple of thousand, Gascoigne."</p>
<p>"I can't do it," Gascoigne said firmly.</p>
<p>"But, my dear fellow, you must. If I don't get it within a week I shall be
in a devil of a mess. It's worse than a debt of honour."</p>
<p>But Gascoigne was polite but firm. He had done all he could, and he was not
prepared to do any more.</p>
<p>"Then I shall ask some of my pals down here," Shorland said. "There are one
or two who would give their ears to get an invitation down to Borne Abbey.
They'd fork out the money cheerfully enough to be able to read in the 'Morning
Post' that they were the guests of the Earl of Sherringborne. They wouldn't do
for you, Gascoigne, and I expect that Lady Edna would kick up no end of a fuss.
But so long as my father is laid up I am master of the house, and, by gad, I'll
do as I like. I'll get my wife, and some of the right sort down here, and we'll
show the natives a thing or two. Now, what will you have, Gascoigne? Brandy and
soda, or a glass of champagne?"</p>
<p>Gascoigne packed up his papers and departed without even taking the trouble
to acknowledge this hospitable invitation. There was trouble in Borne Abbey
later on when Shorland announced his intention to Lady Edna at lunch time. He
had fortified himself freely, and his intellect was none too clear. When he
made the announcement Lady Edna listened in cold horror.</p>
<p>"You can do as you like as regards your wife," she said. "I suppose we shall
have to make the best of this unhappy business. The only consolation is that it
might have been worse. But I decline to receive any of your men friends here.
The Baron has been telling me of one or two of them. You quite understand
that?"</p>
<p>"I shall do just as I like," Shorland said obstinately. "And if you don't
choose to meet them you can go somewhere else. In fact, the thing is already
done. They will all be here on Friday night in time for dinner. Good lord,
anyone would think you were royalty the way you talk. Besides, I am bound to
get money from somewhere. It's the only way I can see."</p>
<p>"I think I begin to understand," Lady Edna said coldly. "You are going to
blackmail these dreadful creatures. They won't lend you money in the ordinary
way, but in return for an invitation here they are willing to accommodate
you."</p>
<p>Shorland let it pass easily enough. As he was fond of boasting, there was no
false pride about him. But even he was stung presently into a certain noisy
explosive anger by the cold cutting contempt which Lady Edna poured out upon
him. He raised his voice shrilly, it seemed to Lady Edna that he was
disgustingly vulgar. And to this quarrel, quite inadvertently, Philip Saltburn
came upon the scene.</p>
<p>He would have withdrawn with an apology for his intrusion, but it was too
late now. And just for the moment Lady Edna was stripped of every rag of her
family pride and dignity. She was prepared to go to any length to prevent this
outrage. It seemed to her that here was disgrace to a noble name which would
presently be discussed, from one end of England to another. And she was willing
now, to grasp at any stray straw which would keep her floating on the muddy
torrent.</p>
<p>"Don't go away, Mr. Saltburn," she said. "I am in great distress, and
possibly you could help me. My brother insists upon inviting various people
here&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, and I'm going to," Shorland interrupted. "Saltburn knows one or two,
by reputation, at any rate."</p>
<p>"Possibly," Saltburn said. "But if I may be allowed to give a little advice,
I don't think&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What the deuce has it go to do with you?" Shorland demanded. "This is a
pretty nice thing, to come from a man of your type in my own house. Fancy the
Convict talking to me like this. Fancy Saltburn dictating to anybody. Let me
tell you that you are devilishly lucky to be at Borne Abbey at all. Oh, I know
what I am talking about. Why, fifty years ago Saltburn's father helped to wash
the dishes in the kitchen here. Oh, it's true enough. I was told that long ago
by one of the old chaps who used to help in the stables. And old Saltburn got
into trouble over a poaching affair and they transported him. And now he comes
back with his pocket full of money as if the whole place belonged to him. And
here is his son, a pal of my own sister's, actually telling me whom I shan't
invite to Borne Abbey. And before you say anything else about my friends, Edna,
perhaps you will be a bit more careful of your own."</p>
<p>Shorland screamed this all out in the shrill, angry, tone of the weak man,
emboldened by the stimulant of the moment. Saltburn stood there without so much
as moving a muscle. There was nothing to show that he was feeling the sting of
this outrageous insult except a certain quiver of his eyelids.</p>
<p>The whole thing was so uncalled for, and so bitterly unjust, that Saltburn
would have been quite within his right to resent it physically. Yet it seemed
to Edna that he was behaving very well indeed. She was beginning to understand
now the difference between blood and manhood.</p>
<p>"Oh, this is shameful," she cried. "It is unpardonable. It would be worse if
it were true, of course."</p>
<p>"It's quite true," Saltburn said quietly. "I didn't know that anybody here
remembered my father. I suppose when he began to make his reputation certain of
the older servants here would recollect. And he did not change his name
because, after all, he had done nothing really to be ashamed of. To-day it
would merely amuse a bench of magistrates. But, of course, we don't proclaim
this thing on the housetops; why should we?"</p>
<p>"But the unwarrantable insult remains the same," Lady Edna said. "I decline
to stay here and hear a guest of mine outraged in this way. Shorland, you must
apologise."</p>
<p>But that was not Shorland's way. He shook his head obstinately. It was only
when Lady Edna flounced indignantly from the room that Shorland began to
realise that he had gone too far. Perhaps there was something in Saltburn's
expression that disturbed him.</p>
<p>"You brought that on yourself," he muttered. "And, after all, it's no
business of yours."</p>
<p>"That I am prepared to admit," Saltburn said quietly. "But Lady Edna asked
me a plain question, and I had to answer it. Now, look here, Shorland, I don't
choose to mix with the sweeps that you are fond of, but I know a good deal
about them, and I know a good deal about you. You're going to ask Lionel Marx
and some of that lot down here so that you can borrow money off them on the
strength of their being your guests. I know you want money badly, and that's
why you are going to insult your sister in this way, Now, for her sake, and to
save her from this unspeakable disgrace I am prepared to make a bargain with
you. How much do you want?"</p>
<p>"Oh, a couple of thousand pounds," Shorland said. "I say, you're a good
chap, after all. Upon my word, I'm sorry I made such a fool of myself. You'll
let me have the cash, and Marx and his lot can go to the devil so far as I'm
concerned. Of course, I don't really want these bounders down here. I'll write
and tell my wife to put them off. Of course she's a different matter."</p>
<p>"Precisely," Saltburn said in the same cold way. "I have nothing whatever to
say as regards Lady Shorland. If you write her ladyship, as you suggest, I'll
let you have a cheque in the course of the day. But only on that
condition."</p>
<p>Shorland protested in his florid way that Saltburn was one of the best. He
wanted to shake hands, he was profuse in his expressions of friendship, and
exceedingly anxious that Shorland should partake of something of a spirituous
nature. He escorted his guest down the drive as if they had been bosom friends.
It was with an uneasy feeling that Lady Edna met her brother on his return.</p>
<p>"So Mr. Saltburn accepted your apology," she asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right," Shorland said carelessly, "I was an ass to talk to
him like that. And he's a real good chap."</p>
<p>Lady Edna suddenly froze again.</p>
<p>"He persuaded you, then," she said. "You mean to say that those people
aren't coming?"</p>
<p>"Just as well they shouldn't," Shorland said jauntily.</p>
<p>"Ah, I begin to see. Mr. Saltburn made a bargain with you. To save this
great disgrace he lent you the money you want; you don't need to trouble to
deny it. Well, I suppose I shall get used to these humiliations in time. At any
rate, I can't blind myself to the fact that I owe Mr. Saltburn a debt I shall
find it difficult to repay. And yet, it seemed to me a little time
ago&mdash;"</p>
<p>Lady Edna turned away as if unable to say more. She was beginning to realise
now how utterly impossible it is for even the great ones of the earth to get
beyond their environment.</p>
<p>And she was beginning to realise, too, what de la Croisa had meant when he
had more than once spoken of Saltburn as one of the salt of the earth. At any
rate, Saltburn had saved her from the crowning shame, and by comparison the
burden of receiving Lady Shorland was an easy one.</p>
<p>She came on the Friday afternoon, beautifully dressed, marvellously
self-possessed, and prepared to enjoy the novelty of the situation. She was
clever enough to make no offer of friendship as far as Lady Edna was concerned,
and the haughty young chatelaine of the Abbey was bound to confess that there
was nothing the matter with her manners.</p>
<p>She had behaved herself as if to the manor born through the long and trying
dinner; she might have been accustomed to being waited on by a retinue of
servants from her cradle. She could sing very well, and play brilliantly, so
that de la Croisa, coming along the terrace, and looking through the windows,
applauded softly.</p>
<p>"I have come to pay homage to the future Lady Sherringborne," he said. "She
seems to be quite at home here, I&mdash;"</p>
<p>The Baron broke off suddenly. Then he examined the brilliant figure at the
piano through his eyeglass. There was a peculiar smile on his eyeglass as he
walked into the drawing-room.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;IN THE PURPLE.</h2>
<p>It was only just for a moment that de la Croisa stood there taking in the
figure of the woman, then he came into the room with his old easy way, and that
charming suggestion of his being absolutely at home. They all looked happy and
comfortable enough, and outwardly, at any rate there was but little sign of the
shadow of the great tragedy that lay over the house of Cranwallis.</p>
<p>Here were all the shaded lights, the banks of artistically arranged flowers,
the palms and the pictures and the statuary which made up the smooth and
harmonious whole which gave the Pink Drawing-room at Borne Abbey its nameless
charm. It was not yet quite dark, so that from the windows it was possible to
see the wide sweep of the park and the spreading landscape beyond. It was the
kind of thing to recall Tennyson's "haunts of ancient peace," and "immemorial
elms."</p>
<p>There was nothing, either, to indicate that the woman sitting at the piano
was not part and parcel of the picture. At any rate, she looked dainty enough
in her simple black lace dress, she wore none of the jewellery with which the
pink paragraphists usually credited her. She was sensible enough to know that
no diamonds were needed, and indeed, she was playing her part very well.</p>
<p>She had chosen a song which suited her voice&mdash;a charming little
fragment which she sang in the purest French. Even Lady Edna seemed to be
pleased, for she sat there listening attentively. In a distant corner of the
room Shorland lounged over a pile of sporting papers. There was a cigarette in
his mouth, and a long glass of amber-coloured fluid stood by his side. He
appeared to be the only discordant note in the harmony. Palpably he was bored
by the whole thing. There was just a flicker of contempt in de la Croisa's eyes
as he regarded Shorland.</p>
<p>"Quite a charming domestic interior," he said to Saltburn. "You seem to have
settled down very comfortably. I shouldn't wonder if Lady Shorland were a
success."</p>
<p>"She sings very nicely," Saltburn said.</p>
<p>"Yes, and very correctly, too," de la Croisa replied. "Honestly now, doesn't
she look as if she were born in the purple? And after all, my dear fellow, what
does it matter? At any rate, she is far too good for Shorland, and I shouldn't
be at all surprised if, in the course of time, our little singer doesn't become
a very great lady indeed. There is only one thing which puzzles me."</p>
<p>"And what is that?" Saltburn asked. "Well, why she married Shorland, to be
sure. Do you suppose she cares a rap about him? Do you suppose she doesn't know
that he is a weak fool without a single redeeming quality? And there's a woman
who might have married a Grand Duke; it would have only been a morganatic
marriage, of course, but still, that has its advantages. And as the Grand
Duchess Alexis, for example, our fascinating Ninon might have gone a long
way."</p>
<p>"You know something about her then?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I know something about her, my dear fellow. There are few
prominent people of whom I am in ignorance. When I was in the world of politics
I found it greatly to my advantage to cultivate the Ninons of my acquaintance.
I will go over and speak to her presently. I wonder if she's altogether
forgotten me."</p>
<p>"You know her personally then?" Saltburn asked.</p>
<p>"I think I may say so. It is quite ten years since we met, and she was a
child of fifteen then. It was not long before I left the world and came down
here to devote myself to my beloved roses. But I never forgot a face, and you
must admit that Lady Shorland's is a striking one."</p>
<p>The song came to an end here, and the singer rose from the piano. She came
across in the direction of the windows, then she pulled up and regarded de la
Croisa with a puzzled expression. Obviously she was asking herself where she
had met him before. She was wondering where this neat little man with the white
hair and the speck of ribbon in his buttonhole had last come in contact with
her. Then it seemed to Saltburn that Lady Shorland's face grew just a little
anxious and frightened.</p>
<p>"Will you introduce me?" de la Croisa said.</p>
<p>"I came over from the cottage this evening only to have the pleasure of
making the acquaintance of Lady Shorland."</p>
<p>Saltburn made the introduction formally enough. He could see quite plainly
that de la Croisa was not adverse to being left alone with his fair companion.
Saltburn turned his head and moved across to the little table where Lady Edna
was seated. At the same time de la Croisa indicated the wide stretch of country
outside the long French windows.</p>
<p>"That is a charming prospect," he said. "I am glad to think that your
introduction to a typical English landscape should have been made here. And
don't you think it rather a pity to stay indoors on a night like this?"</p>
<p>"Do you want to speak to me?" Lady Shorland said.</p>
<p>"It would be a great happiness," the Baron murmured. "It would be a singular
favour for an old man like myself."</p>
<p>Lady Shorland tossed her head slightly. She swept along in front of de la
Croisa who made way for her to pass. It was mild enough out on the terrace so
that there was no occasion for a wrap.</p>
<p>It was still and peaceful, too, with a thousand fragrant scents upon the
summer air. As they paced side by side up and down the terrace the subdued
yellow gleam of the shaded lamps glistened on Lady Shorland's hair and gave her
skin an opalescent hue like warm ivory.</p>
<p>"Now then," she said. "Please go on."</p>
<p>"But why speak to me like that?" de la Croisa asked. "I came to-night with
an olive branch, not a sword. You will think that perhaps I was surprised when
I saw you here this evening, but I am not. I have lived too long and seen too
many strange things to believe in what you call coincidences. Coincidences are
the everyday things in life. It is the commonplace which is so startling. But
it is too perfect a night to talk philosophy. Now tell me, why is it that you
married Shorland?"</p>
<p>"Have you any right to ask?" Lady Shorland replied.</p>
<p>"Well, no; but you see, I am an old man, and consequently privileged. And,
besides, I knew your mother quite well, to say nothing of your father, who was
one of my greatest friends. But still, I am bound to say that I did not expect
to find my old friend's daughter in the person of Ninon Garrados."</p>
<p>"Oh, I remember you," Lady Shorland said. "And you are connected with
certain early episodes of my life. It was good of you, of course, to try and
heal the differences between my father and my mother. I was only a child at the
time, but I was old enough to think then as I think now&mdash;that my mother
was never meant to be the wife of a statesman&mdash;if you can call my father a
statesman. I know you think that he was one of the best of men. But he never
understood me, and that is why, when my mother died, I chose to follow a stage
career. And now my father is dead it is useless to rake up those scandals."</p>
<p>"You know how he died?" de la Croisa asked. "Oh, yes, he took his own life.
If I were an ordinary daughter, perhaps&mdash;but then, we never were friends.
Don't think me heartless or unkind, Baron&mdash;"</p>
<p>She broke off abruptly, and de la Croisa could see that her lips were
trembling.</p>
<p>"Oh, I felt it," she went on. "It was a shock when I read the story in the
papers. Perhaps, if I had understood my father better&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But you value his good name?" the baron urged. "It was a great one in Spain
once. But I was rude enough to ask you just now why you married Shorland."</p>
<p>Lady Shorland shrugged her shoulders carelessly.</p>
<p>"What can it possibly matter?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Well, as it happens, it matters a great deal. You may be surprised to hear
that your father's fortunes and those of the house of Cranwallis are bound up
in the most amazing fashion. But again I will come to this presently. I want to
help you and I want to help my friend Sherringborne at the same time, and you
could be of the greatest assistance."</p>
<p>Lady Shorland was interested in spite of herself.</p>
<p>"Is that really so?" she asked, "Well, a clever man like yourself ought to
know. I remember years ago hearing my father say that you were the most
brilliant statesman he had ever met."</p>
<p>"That will possibly be the verdict of history," de la Croisa said. "But I am
too old to be touched by the compliments of even a pretty woman like yourself.
My great task now is to save the good name and reputation of Egbert Cranwallis,
whom you know as the Earl of Sherringborne. And that brings me to the point
again. Why did you marry Shorland?"</p>
<p>"I hardly know," Lady Shorland said indifferently. "One does these things on
the spur of the moment. And you have it in mind that I might have married a
Grand Duke. Well, I had my choice even in that exalted sphere But, you see, I
wanted to be the wife of an English nobleman. There is something almost unique
about a position like that. And fancy being mistress of a house like Borne
Abbey. You mustn't forget, Baron, that I am an artist to my finger tips. I have
only been here a few hours, but I love this place. There are things here which
bring the tears to my eyes. Just look at its artistic beauty, look at the
romance and refinement of it all. Ah, it is worth even a greater sacrifice than
that of being tied to a fool like Shorland. And I shall make a man of him yet.
At any rate, I shall be mistress of a great historic house, I shall have a
great fortune behind me. You see, I am quite candid with you. And you must
admit that it is not an ignoble ambition. These people here may despise me at
present, but it won't be for long. And that is why I deliberately chose
Shorland instead of a picturesque Grand Duke who could never have given me a
home like this."</p>
<p>"I am glad you have spoken plainly," de la Croisa said. "So you think that
everything is smooth here. You think that before very long you will be Lady
Sherringborne and one of the powers of the land. Well, I have no doubt you will
be a brilliant success. But, my dear Ninon, there are lions in the path. How
would you like it presently to find it was necessary to let Borne Abbey and the
other two places of the family and to live in dingy lodgings somewhere for a
number of years till all the family debts were paid, and the estates
unencumbered? You have resided in England quite long enough to know that a
score of our great families are suffering from this financial blight. My dear,
I am not painting a fancy picture."</p>
<p>"It isn't true," Lady Shorland exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Oh, but it is. I never spoke a truer word in my life. Now, mind, I am
trusting you. I am betraying the confidence of the best friend I ever had. And
I am doing all this because some day you will be Lady Sherringborne, and I feel
sure you will help me in every way that lies in your power. There is not a
financial disaster, but absolute disgrace. Yet, bad as the outlook is, it can
be saved, and you, by a strange trick of fate, are the only woman who can do
it. I know you will help me, because you have ambition and courage, and because
you will not sit quietly down and allow these great advantages to slip through
your fingers."</p>
<p>Lady Shorland was interested enough now. She stood beside her companion with
dilated eyes and parted lips.</p>
<p>"You are a man of honour," she said. "And I know you would not deceive me.
You must tell me more, please."</p>
<p>"Not much more," de la Croisa said. "I have given you an outline of the
position. You know that Sherringborne is a politician as well as a great
nobleman, and politicians, occasionally do very foolish things. Besides, people
are beginning to talk already. Sherringborne has certain enemies who do not
hesitate to say that he has been using official information for Stock Exchange
purposes."</p>
<p>"Ah," Lady Shorland said breathlessly. "Ah! Go on."</p>
<p>"Now, you are woman of the world enough to know what that means. It isn't
true, of course, Sherringborne has been rash and&mdash;well, I needn't go any
further. He has an unscrupulous enemy who is one of our greatest financiers and
when the pinch comes this financier will not hesitate to use any weapon that
comes to hand."</p>
<p>"I know. William Saltburn. Yes?"</p>
<p>"And now I am going to surprise you," de la Croisa went on. "There were two
people in this mad venture of Sherringborne's&mdash;himself and your father.
Unfortunately your father is dead. It is well, perhaps, for my scheme, that
nobody knows that you are the daughter of the man who was called El Murid."</p>
<p>"Go on," Lady Shorland said. "That secret has been well kept at any rate,
and now, what do you want me to do? I see that you have some proposition to
make."</p>
<p>De la Croisa lowered his voice impressively.</p>
<p>"I want you to go to Tortina," he whispered. "I want you to go there with
proofs of your identity and put in a claim for all your father's belongings. I
will see that the path is made smooth for you. You must lay your hands on all
his papers without delay. If you fail to do so certain documents will be made
public, and Lord Sherringborne will be ruined. And then you will have to face
the dingy lodgings for many a long day to come. Now, take your time, don't
answer hurriedly. Are you going to be Lady Sherringborne in effect as well as
name, or are you going to let the matter drift entirely? Only I must know
to-night."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;A MATTER OF DIPLOMACY.</h2>
<p>Lady Shorland stood there for a long time, taking in thoughtfully all that
de la Croisa had to say. She was luminous-minded enough to see that he was
speaking the truth. And she could see plainly enough, too, that all the
advantages for which she had made so great a sacrifice would slip through her
fingers unless she made an effort to retain them.</p>
<p>She had thought the whole matter out carefully. She had made up her mind
that her darling ambition should be to preside over some great English house
and attach herself to some great territorial title. She recognised that the
chances were few and far between, and therefore she decided to sweep Shorland
into her net almost the very day in which she came into contact with him, and
all the more because of Lady Edna's open contempt for her.</p>
<p>She would know how to behave with Shorland when the time came. He had a
glittering coronet to offer her, one of the most famous ones in the history of
her adopted country. Nobody stood higher than the Cranwallises, no name was
more deeply inscribed in the pages of history. There was great wealth, too,
which was a great asset of considerable importance in the eyes of Ninon
Garrados. She would have preferred, of course, to have been married at
Westminster Abbey with all the pomp and circumstance, but that was out of the
question. Still, she was married, and almost in the first blush of her
ambition, it looked as if the whole glittering structure was crumbling at her
feet.</p>
<p>"Let us plainly understand one another," she said. "You say that my father
and Lord Sherringborne were mixed up in some debatable business which means
ruin if the matter becomes public. All this is set out in certain papers,
belonging to my father which it is of the utmost importance that I should
recover. Very well, I will try to do what you suggest. It won't be a difficult
matter for me to get to St. Lucia without arousing suspicion, I have sung and
danced in the capital of Tortina, the capital where I was born, and none of
them guessed that I was the daughter of a one-time President of the Tortina
Republic."</p>
<p>It was half an hour later that de la Croisa turned his face thoughtfully in
the direction of his cottage. The famous silver candlesticks were lighted on
the table, and the faithful Francois was seated there waiting to see if his
master needed anything else before retiring for the night. De la Croisa's eyes
were gleaming and there was a certain reckless, youthful gaiety about him which
aroused all the old soldier's suspicions.</p>
<p>"What is it now, my master?" he asked. "What are you going to do? I have not
seen that look on your face since that night in St. Lucia twelve years
ago&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It matters nothing," the Baron cried gaily. "Francois, I am going out into
the world again. I am going to wear my armour once more, and try a fall with a
foe who is worthy of my steel. We go out, my good friend, to fight for the
honour of a noble house that stands in dire peril from the machination of its
foundings. To-morrow I go to London."</p>
<p>Francois crossed himself piously.</p>
<p>"Then heaven have mercy on us," he said. "If you say it will be done, it
will be done. I come with you, of course?"</p>
<p>"No, Francois. On this occasion I go alone. You will have to stay and look
after the roses. I don't know when I shall be back, indeed, I may have to go as
far as St. Lucia itself. But for the moment that is on the knees of the gods.
You will pack my portmanteau, just a few simple things. Now, don't stop to ask
any further questions."</p>
<p>It seemed to be strange to the Baron to find himself in the rush and the
whirl of the world again. It seemed strange to him to be passing through the
public thoroughfares that he had known so well in his earlier days and to feel
that no soul hurrying by should recognise him. For here, to a certain extent,
was a new generation, to whom the name of de la Croisa was no more than a
shadow.</p>
<p>But the Baron had enough to occupy his mind without brooding over these
things. He dined later on, alone, at his hotel, then he made his way on foot to
one of the streets leading off Grosvenor-square. Here he stopped at a certain
house and sent in his card. There came to him presently a little man, in
evening dress, which contrasted so curiously with the oriental type of his
features, and the strange droop in the corners of his eyelids. He came forward
with a smile and shook de la Croisa's hand with every appearance of cordiality
and friendship.</p>
<p>"You are surprised to see me?" the Baron asked.</p>
<p>"Well, not quite that," the other said. "You see, we Japanese are surprised
at nothing. But, at the same time, it is an unexpected pleasure. The last time
we met was in Paris, when I was representing my country there. And to you I
owed a debt of gratitude which I shall never be able to repay."</p>
<p>"And that, my dear Prince Ito, is why I am here this evening. Now, I think
you can trust me. And I think, when I ask you certain pertinent questions, you
will be disposed to answer me. For instance, how long will it be before your
Tortina islands policy is really disclosed?"</p>
<p>Prince Ito smiled significantly.</p>
<p>"Sit down, my dear friend, sit down," he said. "Permit me to offer you a cup
of coffee and a cigarette. Ah, Tortina could have done with a few more
statesmen like you. And I have not forgotten the many lessons that you taught
me. I was no more than a raw boy when I came to you, and there were others,
too, in various capitals, learning the great game. But we benefited by our
lessons, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>The speaker broke off and elevated his shoulders.</p>
<p>"But I am talking secrets," he resumed. "I know I can trust you, of course.
And now, my dear Baron, what can I do to help you in that little matter between
your friend Sherringborne and the man who is called William Saltburn?"</p>
<p>"Delightful," the Baron murmured. "My dear Prince, I always said you were
the most remarkable man of my acquaintance. It is a great pleasure to me to
know that you are an old pupil of mine in the great game of diplomacy. I knew
that when you found yourself at the head of the Japanese Intelligence
Department you would be controlling one of the most stupendous machines in the
world. So you know all about poor Sherringborne and the terrible mistake he
made in connection with the Tortina Concessions?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know that," Prince Ito said, as if he were mentioning the most
casual thing in the world. "I may say that for some time past I have been
following the career of Mr. Saltburn with interest. In the world of finance
that man is a Napoleon. He will aspire some day to control the capitals of
Europe. His ambition is to be able to prevent a war, or fan one into flame just
to suit his purpose. And, some day, he will produce a capital big enough to do
it. At the same time, my dear Baron, you will doubtless see what a dangerous
man this would be. There is one mistake he makes, that he is disposed to
underrate the intelligence of his opponents. In the great building up of an
Empire like ours, we have to foresee all contingencies. And amongst them we
have certainly foreseen a man like William Saltburn. You know, for example,
that at the present time he is practically controlling the finances
of&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That is no secret to me," de la Croisa murmured.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, it is to the interests of this country, and to the
interests of Lord Sherringborne in particular, to prevent any complications
just now between Japan and America. On the other hand, that's exactly what
Saltburn wants to bring about. And so it happens that, though quite friendly on
the surface, Sherringborne and Saltburn are at daggers drawn, and there is the
bitterest enmity between them. It is personal to a certain extent, too. Perhaps
you are not aware of the fact that before Saltburn was transported for poaching
nearly 50 years ago he was a boy in the kitchen at Borne Abbey. Amongst his
other plans he wants to marry his son to Lady Edna Cranwallis."</p>
<p>"Now that," de la Croisa cried, "is charming. What a race you are. And to
what a marvellous pitch have you brought your intelligence. But then I always
said that Japan would control the East one day. And the strange part of the
whole thing is this&mdash;Saltburn is not taking you into his calculations at
all. It seems amazing that so clever a man should be guilty of such
oversight."</p>
<p>Prince Ito shrugged his shoulders carelessly. "Napoleon had his Moscow," he
said. "And we are but human after all. We make less mistakes because we divide
our responsibilities, but Saltburn trusts nobody; it is his boast that he
manages entirely by himself. Still, we can put him on one side for the moment.
I know all about El Murid and those letters of his. I can quite see why you are
so anxious to regain possession of them. And, by the way, how did you manage to
get hold of El Murid's daughter? I mean the dancer who married Lord Shorland
the other day. She's the one to help you."</p>
<p>"That is already arranged," de la Croisa explained. "She will be on her way
to Tortina in a day or two. But that is not exactly what I came here to talk to
you about. I think I have got a pretty good idea of your policy. If you can
keep Japan and America on good terms, then Sherringborne is saved. Out of sheer
self-defence, Saltburn will have to reconsider his position."</p>
<p>Prince Ito bent forward and laid his hand upon de la Croisa's knee. His face
was quivering with excitement now, his voice had sunk to a husky whisper.</p>
<p>"It is the old game of bully and brag," he said. "America thinks we are
afraid of her, that we are born enemies. Ah, that is where they are wrong,
Baron. I am telling you this, and I am placing my good name in your hands."</p>
<p>"It is safe with me," the Baron said. "Then there will be no trouble over
the Tortina Islands? In which case Saltburn&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Will be powerless," the Prince murmured. "And perhaps ruined."</p>
<p>De la Croisa smiled. He had heard enough.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.&mdash;THE PRIDE OF RACE.</h2>
<p>To the great relief of Francois, de la Croisa returned to the cottage a day
or two later as if nothing had happened, and as if he had merely been away on a
little holiday. He gave no suggestion that he had been back to the great world
again, and that he had been taking a hand once more in high politics. He had
all the gaiety and carelessness of a child, he could speak of nothing but the
roses, which he said had been neglected by Francois in his absence.</p>
<p>"Green fly, green fly," he said gaily. "Actually I can detect evidences of
green fly on the trees which we got from Nice last year. It is a most
extraordinary thing that I can trust nobody. What have you been doing,
Francois? I hope you are not contemplating matrimony?"</p>
<p>The old soldier shook his head solemnly. He was too overjoyed to see his
master back again to defend himself against so unwarrantable a charge. He hoped
that the Baron had not been getting into mischief. And Francois's fears began
to vanish presently when he saw the Baron in his shirt sleeves wandering from
one rose bush to another examining the fragrant petals through a pocket
microscope. Not till after lunch time did the Baron betray any interest in
outside matters. After the meal was over he made his way to Borne Abbey in
search of the latest news of Sherringborne. One of the nurses came down to see
him.</p>
<p>"His lordship is much better," she said. "He has taken a decided turn. He is
still very ill, and we have some difficulty in making him understand what we
are saying. At the same time he has intervals of an hour or so when he is quite
himself."</p>
<p>"Does he see the newspapers?" de la Croisa asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir, the doctor said it wouldn't much matter. But it was a great
mistake, because on Monday morning he happened to see a paragraph relating to
the marriage of Lord Shorland."</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed," the Baron exclaimed. "That was very unfortunate. I hope he is
none the worse for it."</p>
<p>"I don't think so," the nurse said. "His lordship seemed to be somewhat
blunted in his perceptions, but he understood perfectly well, and he expressed
a desire to see his son. In fact, he has seen both Lord Shorland and her
ladyship. And he is most anxious to meet you, Baron. I was coming across to
fetch you."</p>
<p>De la Croisa smiled with the air of a man who is not altogether displeased.
He found Lord Sherringborne sitting up in bed, near the open window, where he
could command a fine prospect of the park. On the whole his illness had left
less effects upon him than de la Croisa had expected. He was weak and shaky
enough, and there was a peculiar nervous affection on the left side of the
face, but Sherringborne's eyes were clear, and he welcomed the Baron
effusively.</p>
<p>"Oh, I think I am better," he said. "They are making a good deal too much
fuss, de la Croisa. They don't seem to realise how necessary it is that I
should know exactly what is going on. I shall be far better and easier in my
mind if you will be good enough to tell me the worst."</p>
<p>"Oh, there is no worst," the Baron said. "For the moment things stand just
where they were. And, if it is any consolation to you, you have the sympathy of
the whole nation. And meanwhile I have not been idle. I have had an interview
with Ito and one or two of the others, and with a fair amount of good fortune
we shall be able to get the best of Saltburn yet."</p>
<p>Sherringborne clutched convulsively at the bed-clothes.</p>
<p>"That's right," he whispered. "Strangle the scoundrel. Take him by the
throat and choke him. I tell you, men like that belong to the worst type of
criminals. They would sacrifice everything to their ambition. For the sake of
power and money they would see their country ruined, they would watch innocent
women and children die of starvation."</p>
<p>"Steady, steady," the Baron whispered softly. "My dear fellow, this is not
the way to get well. Now you know perfectly well that you can entrust your
affairs in my hands."</p>
<p>"Implicitly," Sherringborne said gratefully. "With my knowledge of
international affairs I can get the best of a mere financier like Saltburn. And
Ito is on my side, too. He knows all about it, my friend. That is the most
brilliant intellect in international politics to-day. When I called upon Ito he
knew exactly what I had come for. He knows how you stand as regards Saltburn
and the Tortina Concessions. My dear Sherringborne, you really have no cause to
fear. My lips are sealed, because I promised Ito I would say nothing. Ah, you
are getting excited again."</p>
<p>Sherringborne controlled himself with an effort.</p>
<p>"Go on," he said. "I see what you mean. In that case, Saltburn's scheme
would be checked. Japan would no longer have any use for him if her hands were
full, then we should be able to lay our hands upon the Tortina finances, and
rearrange them as Cromer rearranged the monetary conditions of Egypt. You see
what that means, Baron? Instead of being disgraced, I shall be looked upon as
one of the greatest benefactors this country has ever had. But there is always
the danger of those papers of poor El Murid's."</p>
<p>"Ah, you are better than I thought," de la Croisa said. "That's exactly what
I wanted to speak to you about. Directly I came here the other night and
recognised your new daughter-in-law as El Murid's daughter, I began to see my
way. And Ito saw it, too. If this is not a direct intervention of Providence,
then I am greatly mistaken. Of course, it is rather a blow to you, but then our
dear Shorland might have done worse."</p>
<p>"He might," Sherringborne said with a sour smile. "In fact, I have been
dreading some terrible faux pas for the last year or two. Of course, I have
known for some time, that this marvellous dancer was the daughter of our friend
El Murid. And directly my brain got sufficiently clear I began to see my way.
That's why I sent for my daughter-in-law with a view to seeing what she was
like. And, on the whole, I was agreeably disappointed. That woman would adapt
herself, Baron. She will find her place and, before very long, she will take a
very high position indeed. She is just the kind of fascinating, audacious
creature to find favour even with royalty. And she has the courage, too. Now
don't you think it would be just as well to take her into our confidence and
send her as far&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear Sherringborne, you are paying me a dubious compliment," de la
Croisa interrupted. "Do you suppose I have been idle all this time? Now, I have
had a chat with Lady Shorland. She's all you describe her, and a little more. I
asked her a series of questions. I put her a conundrum which I thought she
might have had some difficulty in answering. Without wishing to hurt your
parental feelings, I wanted to know why so brilliant a creature and beautiful a
woman married a man like Shorland. She might have married a Grand Duke, you
know. But she had an ambition to be the head of some great British historic
family. It seemed to me to show nice discrimination."</p>
<p>"Go on," Sherringborne said quietly. "Well, I applauded her sentiments. Then
I ventured to point out to her that there was a strong possibility of the
little programme falling to the ground. It was a desperate remedy, I know, but
I had to tell her pretty well everything. She saw the point in the twinkling of
an eye. And she volunteered to go out to St. Lucia and get possession of her
father's papers. And she'll do it, too. You see, no one will suspect that she
is thinking of anything but her professional engagements. And she will come
back with those papers, and the situation will be saved. Then we shall be able
to dictate terms to Saltburn. Does the idea amuse you?"</p>
<p>For Sherringborne was laughing quietly.</p>
<p>"It isn't that," he said. "Since I have been lying here you would be
astonished to know how my point of view has broadened. When a man is born to
the purple like myself, he is apt to get a notion that the scheme of creation
has been designed for his own particular benefit. A month or two ago I should
have been shocked at the mere idea of welcoming a professional dancer under my
roof. But what I was thinking of was Edna's feelings. She is making the best of
it, poor girl. She thinks now that Lady Shorland will begin to realise the
responsibilities of her position. She believes that all the pride and glory of
Borne Abbey must make an impression, and what she will say when she hears
Shorland's wife is going ostensibly on a professional tour I tremble to
think."</p>
<p>"It is sad, isn't it?" de la Croisa said gravely. "But the thing is
inevitable. I came over here this morning as much to see Lady Shorland as
yourself. Everything is more or less ready, and now, as I think you have talked
long enough, I will go before the doctor comes and turns me out. I will look in
again to-night."</p>
<p>"Come and dine here," Sherringborne said. "I should like to hear,
after-wards, what has happened. And really, you have taken quite a weight off
my mind."</p>
<p>Lady Edna was out somewhere, and Shorland had gone off in his car to a race
meeting somewhere in the neighbourhood. De la Croisa found Lady Shorland in a
morning room, deeply engaged in her correspondence.</p>
<p>She welcomed the Baron with a smile. "I have been hoping to see you," she
said. "I was beginning to think you had basely deserted me."</p>
<p>"On the contrary, I have been doing great things," the Baron said. "Up to
now, everything is going splendidly. The rest is more or less in your hands.
Now, have you made any arrangements?"</p>
<p>Lady Shorland pointed to two telegrams on the table.</p>
<p>"It is all settled," she said. "I've just had this wire from my agent, but I
inspired the contract. There are great doings at St. Lucia in a fortnight's
time. But then there are always great doings at St. Lucia. But this is some big
feast, and the President is entertaining largely. He is delighted at the idea
that Ninon Garrados should perform before his guests, and I am assured of a
great reception. That's very amusing, isn't it? And he has not the slightest
idea who I am."</p>
<p>De la Croisa chuckled.</p>
<p>"Only a day or two ago I was looking forward to the delights of a rural
life, and here am I back again in the limelight more prominently than ever. Oh,
I shall enjoy the adventure; in fact, I am looking forward to it with the
greatest possible pleasure. But what, my dear Baron, am I to say to Lady
Edna?"</p>
<p>Baron de la Croisa was frankly amused. Lady Edna would be displeased if she
could have seen her old friend at that moment. Possibly he was looking forward
to Lady Shorland's thunderbolt with cynical amusement. But then, as he
explained to his companion, he was an old man, and his pleasures were few.</p>
<p>"What will Shorland say?" he asked.</p>
<p>"What does it matter what he says? I should say that he would be rather
glad. In the present state of his finances it's no bad thing to have a wife who
can lend him a hand financially. I expect that's the view he will take of it.
But our dear Edna will freeze me. She will pour a cold cataract of contempt
over me. Upon my word, I really dread telling her."</p>
<p>"Let me do it," the Baron said eagerly. "Don't deprive me of a new sensation
like this. I promised to dine here this evening and see Sherringborne
after-wards. Now, Lady Edna is one of the most delightful creatures in the
world. You have no idea what a noble woman she is. But she has been clad in her
splendid isolation too long. She has come to regard the universe as a world of
royalty, Cranwallises, and the rest of the inhabitants of the globe. If we
could only induce her to believe&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Can't Philip Saltburn do that," Lady Shorland said demurely. "He's just the
man for the job."</p>
<p>"Oh, so you've noticed that, too," de la Croisa said. "As a matter of fact,
it would be the best thing that could happen. Lady Edna doesn't know that she
would be a lucky girl if she became Philip Saltburn's wife, but it's a fact all
the same. Now you will let me tell Lady Edna to-night, won't you?"</p>
<p>"It's a privilege which I cheerfully resign," Lady Shorland said. "You shall
make the announcement after dinner, and you shall break the news your own way.
What a comedy it would make! And how I should like to play a part in it
myself."</p>
<p>De la Croisa presently went off cheerfully enough in the direction of his
cottage. He felt that his morning had not been wasted. He had the additional
pleasure, too, of finding amongst his roses one which appeared to be an
entirely new species. For the next hour or two Francois and himself discussed
this treasure, to the exclusion of everything else.</p>
<p>"It will make our reputation," Francois said. "You will be known to
posterity&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Greatness thrust upon me," the Baron laughed. "And to think that I have
been wasting my years in the muddy atmosphere of politics! But one lives and
learns, Francois."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;THE THUNDERBOLT.</h2>
<p>The lamps were lighted in the dining-room, and the servants moved silently
and swiftly about, and dinner was at length drawing to a close. Lady Edna sat
in her father's accustomed place talking quietly with de la Croisa, whilst
Shorland was babbling to his wife as to the luck which had attended his day's
racing.</p>
<p>He had pushed his glass and dessert plate to one side, and moodily lighted a
cigarette. This was an innovation which found scant favour in Lady Edna's eyes.
At any other time she would have resented it as a breach of tradition, but she
had found herself allowing many things to pass lately. She seemed to realise
that her authority was waning now, and that she no longer presided over the
house as a goddess might have done.</p>
<p>She was, perhaps, unconsciously grateful that Lady Shorland showed no
disposition whatever to usurp her authority. The latter obliterated herself
entirely; she was discreet enough to refer things to Lady Edna, and to behave
exactly as if she had been a guest in the house. Philip Saltburn watched her,
not without approval. He had a certain democratic contempt for the pretensions
which Lady Edna unconsciously claimed, and, indeed, he could not see much to
find fault with in the air and manner of the new Lady Shorland.</p>
<p>De la Croisa turned to her presently, for she had said something about
roses, which immediately attracted the Baron's attention.</p>
<p>"By the way," he said, "you've not seen mine yet. Positively I've found a
new specimen. It will be at its best in about a week's time. Now, suppose you
come over next Thursday and give me the pleasure of lunching with me."</p>
<p>Lady Shorland looked reproachfully at the speaker.</p>
<p>"Why do you make that suggestion?" she asked. "You know perfectly well I
shan't be here."</p>
<p>Lady Edna looked interested.</p>
<p>"Are you going away?" she asked. Lady Shorland made no reply, though she
glanced mischievously at the Baron. He had promised valiantly enough to launch
the thunderbolt, and his fellow-conspirator had not the slightest intention of
coming to his assistance.</p>
<p>"Ah," he said gaily. "It is not an easy matter to get out of professional
engagements." Lady Edna sat upright, she began to understand what the Baron was
saying. She turned in her most frigid way to her sister-in-law.</p>
<p>"I am afraid I don't quite follow," she said.</p>
<p>"What does the Baron mean by 'professional engagements?' Surely you don't
contemplate the possibility of continuing&mdash;"</p>
<p>Words failed her for the moment. The mere suggestion of a Cranwallis by
marriage figuring on the stage was insupportable.</p>
<p>"This is supposed to be a democratic country," the Baron said. "There is a
popular delusion to the effect that it is the land of liberty. As a matter of
fact, it is nothing of the kind. And even in the case of the most exalted it is
impossible to break a contract. If one tried that the law steps in with a
threat of contempt of court. Now, contempt of court, my dear Edna, means that
if you refuse to carry out a contract you go to gaol. And I am sure you would
not like to see Lady Shorland in gaol, languishing in a prison cell."</p>
<p>"Some way must be found," Lady Edna said calmly.</p>
<p>"No way can be found," Lady Shorland laughed. She was being stung into
opposition now, by the icy hostility of the other's manner. "And, besides, I am
not disposed to break my word. I am rather looking forward to my trip. If I go
to Tortina this week St. Lucia is waiting for me. You would think nothing of it
if I happened to be, Melba, for instance. And what is the difference? Besides,
my beloved Shorland and myself have our living to get. I cannot argue it,
Edna."</p>
<p>"The situation is impossible," Lady Edna cried.</p>
<p>"Oh; really? You will find it quite possible. And I always keep my promise.
A promise is as sacred to me as if I, too, had been born a Cranwallis."</p>
<p>A warm reply trembled on Lady Edna's lips. She was on the verge of a
passionate outbreak. Then she turned coldly away and moved in the direction of
the door. Shorland looked up from his cigarette and laughed in a feeble kind of
way.</p>
<p>"There'll be some fun in the drawing-room presently," he said. "I expect
they'll make the fur fly. Edna's got a good pluck of her own, but she won't
find Ninon far round the corner when it comes to that sort of thing. I say,
let's follow and see the fun. I wouldn't miss it for anything."</p>
<p>The response of the listeners was not enthusiastic, so that Shorland sat
there sulkily with the declaration that some men had no keenness where sport
was concerned. Meanwhile, Lady Edna was standing, haughty and dignified, in the
drawing-room waiting for a chance to speak her mind. Lady Shorland dropped into
a chair and fanned herself languidly.</p>
<p>"Very warm, don't you think?" she said.</p>
<p>"I had not noticed it," Lady Edna said. "And now I shall be glad of an
explanation. Why are you doing this thing? Why are you going out of your way to
bring disgrace upon us? You know perfectly well that you can spare us the
humiliation if you like. For my brother's sake I was prepared to make the best
of an intolerable situation&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Stop," Lady Shorland cried. "You are going too far. Do you think I am going
to submit to be spoken to like this by one who, as far as the ways of the world
go, is a mere child? Anybody would think that I was some unspeakable creature
whom Shorland had plucked out of the gutter. And if Shorland cannot support me,
I must support myself."</p>
<p>"We are not paupers," Lady Edna retorted.</p>
<p>"Aren't you? Well, I'm not sure of that. Shorland has no money and at
present no means of getting it. You don't suppose I am going to sit quietly
down and be a dependent in this house as if I came here by favour? And I am not
doing this thing entirely for my own benefit. Cold and distant as you are, and
unpleasant as you make things for me, I am sorry for you."</p>
<p>"Sorry," Lady Edna, gasped. "Sorry for me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I am speaking plainly enough. I mean every word I say. And I am sorry
for you because you are living in a fool's paradise. You think all this
splendour and display is real, you are proud to believe that Borne Abbey is
built on a solid foundation and that nothing can shake your position. I tell
you, you are quite wrong. The whole thing might collapse at any moment like a
house of cards. Ah, you little know how near you are to ruin and disgrace which
will be talked of from one end of England to another. Everything has been kept
from you. You are like a child playing with a box of bricks in a house of
mourning. Why, if I liked, I&mdash;I could tell you&mdash;"</p>
<p>Lady Shorland broke off abruptly. She was suddenly conscious that her
outburst of anger was carrying her too far. She could see pain, as well as
anger, in Lady Edna's white, set face. And, looking round at all this
magnificence, at all the refined artistic splendour of the centuries, it was
hard to realise that the hand of shame and trouble was clutching for it
all.</p>
<p>Lady Edna was asking herself questions, too. Was it possible that she was
being treated as a child? Was it possible that certain truths were being kept
back from her? She began to see now that there might be something horribly
tangible behind her father's illness.</p>
<p>"Go on," she said. "Pray continue. I am all attention. It is humiliation
enough for me to feel that a comparative stranger like yourself should have
received confidences of which I appear to be unworthy. Go on, I am learning my
lesson."</p>
<p>"No," Lady Shorland said quietly. "I have already said too much. You goaded
me to it, but I ought to have been wise enough to have held my tongue. But
there is one thing which I may promise you&mdash;when I have fulfilled my
engagement at St. Lucia I will never take another. I am going there not to
please myself, but to do my best to remove disgrace and humiliation which
threaten you all. And now, don't worry yourself any more about it. Look after
the servants and your poor, and your flowers, and don't interfere with things
which you cannot understand, for after all, you are no more than a child, and
you don't know any better."</p>
<p>Lady Edna stood there, utterly at loss for a reply. She stood there,
immersed in her own painful thoughts, and hardly conscious of the fact that she
was not alone. It was not an easy process to fit together the pieces of this
disjointed puzzle, but slowly and by degrees they began to resolve themselves
into their places.</p>
<p>A wild feeling of passionate rebellion which for a time had raged in the
girl's heart began to dissolve and fuse into a certain nameless fear. There was
anger in it, too, a certain reasonable revolt against the way in which, she had
been treated.</p>
<p>She went off presently up to her father's bedroom. It was just possible that
he was awake and that he might feel disposed to give her the confidence which,
up to now, he had withheld. She found him sitting among the pillows reading a
copy of the "Times." He looked brighter and stronger than he had for some days
past, and he welcomed Edna pleasantly enough.</p>
<p>"Come in," he said. "My nurse has left me for a moment. Yes, I am feeling a
great deal better to-day. De la Croisa brought me some news this morning which
has cheered me up. Oh, you need not mind worrying me if anything is troubling
you."</p>
<p>"Well, I am greatly worried," Lady Edna admitted. "I have been talking to
my&mdash;to my sister-in-law. I quite thought that when she married Shorland
she would give up the stage. And now she actually tells me that she has
accepted an engagement in Tortina within a few weeks."</p>
<p>Sherringborne lifted his brows.</p>
<p>"And have you been interfering?" he asked. "You have been making yourself
unpleasant to her?"</p>
<p>"I certainly spoke my mind," Lady Edna admitted. "In fact, we both lost our
tempers. That woman had the audacity to hint that there was a great disgrace
hanging over our house, and that she was going to St. Lucia to prevent it. I
say nothing as to that absurd statement, as to my being treated as a mere
child, but of course I know I ought not to be worrying you now, but at any cost
this thing must be stopped. Promise me that you will interfere."</p>
<p>Lady Edna glanced half imploringly at her father, but she was surprised at
the look of deep displeasure in his eyes.</p>
<p>"You're a fool," he said harshly. "You are a silly child, and don't know
what you are talking about. Who asked you to interfere? Do you suppose the
whole world was designed for your own special benefit? And you talk about
disgrace. Well, there is disgrace. And we shall both be fortunate if we escape.
Now unless you wish&mdash;but I'm not going to discuss the matter. You must be
civil to Shorland's wife; you must be civil to young Saltburn, to everybody. Do
you understand?"</p>
<p>No reply came from Lady Edna's lips. It seemed to her as if the whole world
were slipping under her feet. Disgrace! And the house of Cranwallis! Oh, the
thing was impossible!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;IN THE SHADOW.</h2>
<p>Disgrace! It seemed almost impossible to identify such a word with Borne
Abbey. Lady Edna looked around her and saw nothing on every side except the
outward and visible greatness of the Cranwallises.</p>
<p>And yet she had heard the word from her father's own lips, and there was
nothing either in his manner to suggest that he was suffering from a delusion.
And he had never spoken to his daughter like this before. His manner had been
harsh and rude, and there was something furtive in the way he spoke, as if he
were a party to a mean and underhand thing of which he was ashamed.</p>
<p>It seemed to Lady Edna that she had read something like this before. She had
a vague idea that she could remember a daughter who had had such a father and
how disappointed she had been in him.</p>
<p>And then, again, there was the suggestion that Ninon Garrados was in some
way necessary to the fortunes of the family. The idea was grotesque,
ridiculous. Why, there was nobody in the house who had heard her name a
fortnight ago. And now Edna had it on the authority of her father that this
woman was going off hot-foot to St Lucia, of all places in the world, with a
view to saving the family name.</p>
<p>It struck Edna for a moment that her father was wandering in his mind. She
was quite prepared to believe that he was suffering from some great trouble
which he had kept entirely to himself, and which was the cause of his
breakdown. But the rest were mere chimera, a mere figment of disordered
imagination.</p>
<p>But Lady Edna did not dare to ask any further questions. She could see how
excited the Earl was, and in any case the return of the nurse put an end to
further conversation. It was a restless night that Lady Edna passed, but her
gloomy thoughts were somewhat lightened by the morning. For she could see no
signs of trouble about the house. Everything seemed to be progressing as usual,
and the great establishment was running easily on oiled wheels. Here was the
big staff of servants with a small army of gardeners, and in the suite of
apartments given over to Sherringborne's political affairs were the half-dozen
or so of smart, well-bred, well groomed secretaries.</p>
<p>And here, too, were the clerks and the busy rattle of the typewriters. A
constant stream of messages was running to and fro quite the same as usual; and
here, too, were the morning papers with their sympathetic allusions to
Sherringborne's illness and the hope that he would soon be himself again. And
here were Lady Edna's own private letters with appeals to her charity and all
the rest of it.</p>
<p>And here was the wide stretch of gardens and the park beyond and the
ancestral deer under the shadows of the beeches. Oh, it seemed impossible to
identify all this with trouble and disgrace of any kind.</p>
<p>And yet, at the same time, Lady Edna could not rid herself of the cloud
which hung over her, despite the fact that it was a glorious day and that the
sun was shining in a sea of liquid blue.</p>
<p>For the first time in her life Edna regretted the fact that she had no
intimate personal friends. She had always been self-contained, always a little
prone to take herself seriously, and always over-conscious of her exalted
position Now she regretted that she had nobody to confide in. There was only
one person she could talk freely to, and that was de la Croisa.</p>
<p>It occurred to her in a fleeting sort of way, to make one more appeal to
Lady Shorland, but the latter had gone off soon after breakfast in her rapid,
headlong way, and had left an intimation at Borne Abbey that she would not be
back for some weeks at least.</p>
<p>So she had really gone! Well, after all, it did not much matter. All the
world knew now what Shorland had done, the papers had been full of it, and his
marriage had been the subject of a thousand racy paragraphs. And St. Lucia was
a long way off. On the whole, the best thing to do was to go down to the
cottage, and there talk matters over with the kindly old Baron.</p>
<p>De la Croisa had looked forward to a quiet morning to himself. He sat in the
armchair outside the cottage door deeply engrossed in the "Times." He looked
very young and very jaunty in his white flannel suit. From time to time he
screwed his glass into his eye and gave certain instructions to Francois, who
was busy amongst the roses.</p>
<p>There had been a time when de la Croisa had sworn by all his gods he had
finished with politics for ever. In future he was only going to regard them
from the comfortable depths of an arm-chair in a strictly historic and critical
light. And here he was back again in the arena, fighting with all his old
shrewdness and audacity for the reputation of his friend.</p>
<p>He tried to tell himself that he was doing this entirely on Sherringborne's
behalf, but at the same time he was enjoying the combat for its own sake. It
seemed hard to believe that this shrewd and dapper little man seated at his
cottage door was holding in his hands the shaping destinies of Europe. For that
is what it came to, and de la Croisa was keenly proud of the fact.</p>
<p>He knew that he was struggling for something more than the desire to save
Sherringborne from his folly, and thwart the designs of an unscrupulous
financier. He began to see his way now to the possibilities of breaking down
Saltburn altogether.</p>
<p>And everything was going very well, too. De la Croisa could find a great
deal to give him satisfaction in the perusal of England's foremost daily paper.
The 'Times' special correspondent at Washington, and also his colleague at
Tokio, took a sufficiently gloomy view of the situation. They were both under
the impression that there would be serious trouble between the States and Japan
before long. And this being so, it was difficult to see how England, with her
Pacific interests, was going to keep out of the squabble.</p>
<p>Out of the profound depths of his experience de la Croisa had a good-natured
contempt for newspaper correspondents. But on this occasion he was inclined to
agree. He smiled, too, to see that Sir James Pallisser, the Prime Minister, had
been disposed to take a sanguine view of the situation in the House of Commons
the day before. Certainly, everything was going right from the Baron's point of
view, and it seemed to him that he could return to his roses with an easy mind.
He had just lighted his after-breakfast cigarette when Lady Edna came upon the
scene.</p>
<p>He was delighted to see her, of course; he was proud to show her round his
garden, and to prove to her that McKillop, the Borne Abbey gardener, knew less
about roses than he imagined. But for once, Lady Edna did not appear to be
interested. Her face was grave, and the serene look in her eyes had given place
to a certain cloudy anxiety.</p>
<p>"Oh, I dare say," she said, "but I am not in the mood to talk about flowers
this morning. I came to see you on a most important matter. I suppose, being a
girl my father does not think that I am worthy of his confidence, but I know
that you possess it.</p>
<p>"We have been friends for many years," the Baron murmured.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know that. And I believe that you two, between you have been
responsible for a good deal of history. But this is a personal matter. I saw my
father last night and I asked him a plain question."</p>
<p>"Oh, did you," the Baron said. "My dear Edna, if you have taken the trouble
to read history carefully, you must know that some of the most promising of
politicians have been ruined because there has been some woman in the case.
Now, I have an instance in my mind, where it was absolutely necessary to employ
a woman in the case. There was no help for it."</p>
<p>"I understand," Lady Edna said. "You see, I am no diplomatist. You were
talking, of course, of Lady Shorland?"</p>
<p>"Precisely. You are rather cleverer than you imagine yourself to be. But
that is only what one could expect from your father's daughter. But believe me,
this candid fashion of yours of going straight to the point is likely to
occasionally play into the hands of the enemy. For instance, you have as good
as told me that Lady Shorland lost her temper last night."</p>
<p>"We both did," Lady Edna admitted.</p>
<p>"Just what I thought. And you both said a good deal that you are likely to
be sorry for. For instance, you are furious with your brother's wife, because
she insisted on carrying out a certain engagement, and by way of retaliation
she let you know that she was doing this on behalf of the family. Now, let me
prophesy. My dear child, I know as much about that conversation as if I had
been there listening. And now you are uneasy in your mind. You want to know
what this trouble is, wherein an almost total stranger could help you. And you
went to your father last night and he practically told you to mind your own
business."</p>
<p>"You are certainly a most wonderful man," Lady Edna said with a suspicion of
a smile. "And you have stated the case exactly. I did not care to say too much
to my father, and besides, the nurse came and turned me out. But I know that
there is some deep trouble, and I don't think I ought to be left in ignorance
of it."</p>
<p>De la Croisa shook his head reprovingly.</p>
<p>"And that is why you come to ask me to betray your father's confidence," he
said. "My dear child, I can't do that. Your father has been foolish. Mind you,
he has done nothing wrong willingly, but, at the same time, he has been very
unwise, and like many other great men he had bitter political enemies."</p>
<p>"But my father is the soul of honour," Edna cried.</p>
<p>"Quite. But it is all part of the great game. Take my own case, for
instance. At one time I was supposed to have the destinies of South America in
my hands. And even my enemies gave me the credit for purely patriotic motives.
But that did not prevent them from scheming to get rid of me. They did get rid
of me, eventually, by one of the vilest political ruses. Now, it those men had
done the same in private life they would have been hounded out of decent
society. They would have had to resign their clubs; they would not have been
admitted into certain houses. But as it was part of the game of politics they
sit in high places to-day, and I live without a cloth on my dining table, and
only my roses for consolation."</p>
<p>Lady Edna listened meekly.</p>
<p>"How many people in England know to-day that the man who calls himself de la
Croisa is really the Duc de&mdash;, but it does not matter," the baron went on.
"I am only giving you this as an object-lesson. That is the position of your
father to-day, and that is the cause of his breakdown. I am going to save
him&mdash;make no mistake about that. But I am going to do it my own way, and
with my own weapons. More than this I cannot tell you. If you will have
patience, everything will come right."</p>
<p>Lady Edna murmured her thanks somewhat grudgingly. Despite her exalted
position and the consciousness of her own brilliant orbit, it was strange how
she always felt like the merest child when she came to talk seriously to de la
Croisa.</p>
<p>"You must forgive me," she said. "You can imagine how helpless I feel, and
it is bad enough when I have to welcome Mr. Saltburn and his son at Borne
Abbey."</p>
<p>"You think it was derogatory?" the baron asked.</p>
<p>"I think so still," Lady Edna said.</p>
<p>"Ah, well, there you are wrong. I am not going to say anything so far as
William Saltburn is concerned, but Philip is a thoroughly good fellow. It seems
to me you owe him a good deal. For instance, you know how well he behaved on
the night of your father's sudden illness, and you have told me yourself how
you have to thank him for keeping Shorland from filling up the house with his
undesirable associates. And, mind you, he did this after Shorland had insulted
him most outrageously."</p>
<p>"You think highly of Philip Saltburn, then?"</p>
<p>"I think very highly of him, indeed," the baron said dryly, "and I think
that the girl who marries him will be lucky. Now, do you know what I should
like to do with you if you were my daughter? I should like to send you out into
the world for twelve months to get your own living. It would be a perfect
revelation to you. Oh, I don't mean it unkindly. And now come round the garden
with me, and I will show you the new rose."</p>
<p>Lady Edna went back to Borne Abbey presently a little easier in her mind.
She had the most implicit faith in de la Croisa's promise, but, at the same
time, she could not get rid of the feeling that she was being treated like a
child.</p>
<p>De la Croisa, in the midst of his roses, watched her with an amused twinkle
in his shrewd eyes. Then he dismissed Lady Edna from his thoughts and proceeded
to devote himself to his beloved flowers. It was not for long that he was to be
left alone, for presently Philip Saltburn appeared.</p>
<p>"Behold the lover," de la Croisa murmured to himself. "I thought he would
not be far behind. Well, young man? And what can I do for you? Are you any
judge of roses?"</p>
<p>"Hang the roses," Philip Saltburn said.</p>
<p>"By no means," de la Croisa said gravely. "You must not speak
disrespectfully of my flowers. But you are not coming to worry me on a lovely
morning like this, are you?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid I am," Saltburn said. "I am very sorry, but it is quite
necessary. I want to talk to you about this business of your friend, Lord
Sherringborne."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;IN THE HOUSE.</h2>
<p>De la Croisa abandoned himself to the inevitable. Here was a young man who
was not going to be put off, and, in his heart of hearts he liked him all the
better for it. He placed another chair in the cottage porch and invited
Saltburn to sit down. Then he waited for him to speak.</p>
<p>"I know you are the only man to come to," Saltburn said. "You see, I know
exactly who you are, and I know that you are in Sherringborne's confidence. For
all I am not following my father's profession; I have had a good business
training, and I am interested in international finance. Now, is it true or not
that Sherringborne has got himself mixed up in that Tortina business? Now, my
dear Baron, I am not asking these questions out of mere curiosity. This is not
impertinence on my part."</p>
<p>"If it were," de la Croisa said quietly. "I should know how to get rid of
you. On the contrary, I know you want to help us. I feel quite sure you will do
that if only for Lady Edna's sake."</p>
<p>Philip Saltburn flushed slightly.</p>
<p>"We can leave her out of the question," he said.</p>
<p>"Well, for the present, perhaps we can. But she must crop up sooner or
later, my dear Saltburn. And since you seem to know so much, I am going to pay
the compliment of trusting you. What you say is absolutely correct."</p>
<p>"Ah, I knew it," Saltburn exclaimed. "I felt quite certain of it. And I know
perfectly well, too, who is responsible for this."</p>
<p>"Your father has many irons in the fire," the Baron said.</p>
<p>"I am not in my father's confidence. It has always been a boast of his that
he never trusted a man in his life. But the thing which puzzles me is
this&mdash;if my father had not more or less backed those Tortina Concessions,
Sherringborne, and, indirectly, this country, would not have been in them at
all. And now, as far as I can gather, my father has thrown the Tortina
Government over altogether, and is backing his own hand."</p>
<p>"And forgetting me," the Baron said softly.</p>
<p>"Well, it is a theory of mine that most high finance nowadays is merely a
form of crime. There is no punishment for it on the statute book, but it is
criminal all the same. However, we need not discuss that. All my father's
interest is behind his group now, and if he can induce Tortina to force a
quarrel on Washington, through Japan, thousands of innocent English people,
besides Sherringborne, will be ruined. But to your big financier this is a mere
incident in the game. Now, Baron, do you think that trouble between Japan and
the States is imminent?"</p>
<p>"Certain sections of the Press would have us believe so," de la Croisa said.
"But personally I should like to gamble against it. I know that if I were head
of the Government to-day I should ignore the possibility of such a thing."</p>
<p>"And you would be right," Saltburn said with conviction. "There would be no
trouble between the two Pacific Powers because neither desires it."</p>
<p>"You are a clever young man," the Baron said sententiously. "Ah, if I were
only your age again!"</p>
<p>"I think I know what I am talking about," Philip said modestly. "You see, I
have been in Japan; I spent 18 months there. If hostilities break out I take it
that Lord Sherringborne will be ruined."</p>
<p>"You are indeed an observant young man," the Baron replied. "That is
precisely what ought to happen, and if it doesn't, then Mr. William Saltburn
will lose quite a lot of money, which means that your father will not be the
financial power of the future that he is to-day. I feel convinced that he has
staked everything upon that rascal Santa Anna deliberately making for
trouble."</p>
<p>"I agree," Philip said. "There's many a slip between the cup and the lip. So
you feel sure that if Santa Anna were representing Tortina as obdurate,
Sherringborne will be in a tight place indeed. Now, how much would it take to
set him straight and get him out of his trouble?"</p>
<p>"This is a very strenuous conversation," de la Croisa said. "It would be
more affectation on my part to stop when I see you know so much. Between
ourselves, you have not exaggerated Sherringborne's position in the slightest.
But if my plans materialise the world will be none the wiser."</p>
<p>"But what about his position?" Philip insisted.</p>
<p>'"Well, Sherringborne can be saved as far as his finance and good name are
concerned by a quarter of a million. This money would all come back again if
the Tortina Concessions only have fair play, but if Santa Anna is the traitor I
take him to be, then it will be lost. At the present moment it is what you call
a toss-up either way. But why discuss the matter? Who is the least likely to
find the money?"</p>
<p>"I am," Philip said quietly.</p>
<p>The eyeglass fell from the baron's eyes.</p>
<p>"You are?" he exclaimed. "My dear fellow, I congratulate you. I had no idea
you were so rich."</p>
<p>"I am not," Philip said. "Still, I could find that money, and have a little
left besides. As a matter of fact, my mother had a considerable holding in
Australian mining shares, and these came to me. I am prepared to run the risk
if you think it will be of any real use to Sherringborne."</p>
<p>"This is very magnificent," de la Croisa said dryly. "And quite
disinterested, of course?"</p>
<p>Once more Saltburn's features changed colour.</p>
<p>"Indeed it isn't," he said. "I am not playing the philanthropist in the
least. I want to save Sherringborne's good name, and, above all, to shield his
daughter from shadow and disgrace, and I don't want you to allow Sherringborne
to know where the money comes from. In any case, Lady Edna must not hear a word
of it. If I am to find favour in her eyes I must do it on my own merits. I have
no wish to buy a wife."</p>
<p>"So that's the way the wind blows?" the Baron asked.</p>
<p>"Quite right, my dear Baron. The first time I saw Lady Edna I made up my
mind. There's no accounting for these things. At any rate, I know that I have
met the one woman&mdash;you know what I mean."</p>
<p>"I think so," the Baron murmured.</p>
<p>"I dare say you regard her as cold and proud," Philip went on, "the sort of
girl&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You forget that I have known her for years," the Baron said. "Ah, the man
who married her&mdash;still she has the defects of her qualities, but I take it
that your father will have something to say on the subject?"</p>
<p>"On that point we happen to be agreed," Philip said. "Only his methods are
not mine."</p>
<p>"I can understand that," the Baron said dryly.</p>
<p>"Still, I hope that I can bring my father round to a proper appreciation of
the right thing to do. I shall have an opportunity of talking it over with him
to-night, when I am dining with him in the House of Commons. I should have done
so before, only he has been away in Paris."</p>
<p>An amused gleam came into the Baron's eyes. Quite unconsciously Saltburn had
given him a piece of valuable information. And although Saltburn appeared to
know a great deal, he did not know everything, and, indeed, there was no reason
why he should. Then the conversation became more desultory, and Saltburn went
off in the direction of his hotel.</p>
<p>He reached London late the same afternoon, and after dressing walked down to
the House of Commons. He had to wait some little time for his father in the
lobby of the House. The big room was filled with a more or less excited crowd
of outsiders and journalists, for a big debate was in progress concerning the
whole foreign policy of the Government. There were various rumours afloat, and
to these Saltburn listened with more or less cynical amusement.</p>
<p>His father came out presently, big and noisy, and overpowering as usual. He
seemed conscious of his own importance.</p>
<p>"You'll have to wait a bit," he said. "I've got one or two little matters
which must be attended to, but there's a bit of debate on to-night, and it may
interest you. Perhaps you would like to go up in the gallery until I've got a
few minutes to spare."</p>
<p>The House of Commons was crowded as Saltburn took his seat. The green
benches below were filled with members, and a prominent supporter of the
Opposition was making a furious onslaught on the Government. It was a bitter
attack, and not a little personal. There were allusions, too, to
Sherringborne's mysterious illness, and an unmistakable hint to the effect that
the noble lord was keeping out of the way.</p>
<p>The speech came to an end presently, and then, looking down on the House,
Philip could see that the late speaker had disappeared behind the Chair, in
company with his own father. It was obvious enough to Philip to see that the
whole thing was prearranged. He knew well enough that the member who had just
sat down was, so to speak, in his father's pocket. He knew that the man had
been put up with the sole idea of aiming a blow at Lord Sherringborne's
reputation. A moment or two later and William Saltburn himself came into the
gallery.</p>
<p>"Now I can give you a little time," he said. "Come into one of the
dining-rooms with me. What is it you want?"</p>
<p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I want a good deal," Philip said. "At any rate,
I can't tell you anything here, but I certainly should like to know why you are
making this unworthy attempt to destroy Sherringborne. As far as I know, he has
done you no harm, and he has certainly been most kind and courteous to me."</p>
<p>"That's my business," William Saltburn growled.</p>
<p>"Not altogether," Philip retorted. "I may be wrong, but I think you are
making a great mistake. You are altogether too sanguine in his matter."</p>
<p>William Saltburn broke into a roar of laughter.</p>
<p>"Rot, my dear boy, rot," he cried. "What does a boy like you know? Those
chaps at St. Lucia will do exactly as I tell them. Talk about things you
understand, Philip."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;FATHER AND SON.</h2>
<p>Not a muscle of Philip's face changed. But he know that in those few
boastful words his father had given him the whole key to the situation. Those
people in St. Lucia would dance to William Saltburn's tune, in other words, he
had Santa Anna, the President of that disturbed revolutionary State, in his
pocket. It was as plain as possible that Sherringborne had been deliberately
betrayed. He had been carefully shepherded into the trap of the great British
capitalist, and, undoubtedly, William Saltburn was at the bottom of the whole
conspiracy.</p>
<p>He was to be ruined, he was to lose his money, and the concession which had
been granted to himself and his syndicate would be worthless&mdash;at any rate,
for a time at least. No doubt William Saltburn would see his way to making
those shares valuable again when Sherringborne and his friends were out of the
way, but that time had not come yet.</p>
<p>Then, when the mischief was all done, the shares would fall automatically,
and at his own price, into Saltburn's hands. All this was clear to Philip as
daylight. He knew now that if his father had only kept out of the way the
threatened trouble between Japan and the States would never have arisen. And,
in that case, Sherringborne's interests in the concessions would have been
regarded by the world as a more matter of business, concerning only himself and
certainly a commercial transaction which would in no way have involved the
honour of a Minister of State. But the mere fact of his being Foreign Secretary
when the trouble began made all the difference in the world, and the knowledge
that Sherringborne had not conveyed this information to his colleagues in the
Cabinet made the thing look blacker still.</p>
<p>No doubt Saltburn had counted on all this, and, indeed, when Philip looked
into his father's hard, keen face, he had no further hesitation on the point.
It was clear enough that William Saltburn was going to drive Sherringborne into
a corner, and ultimately out of the Cabinet in sheer dishonour and disgrace.
Then, when the bottom had dropped out of the Tortina Concessions, the
capitalist would buy them at his own price, and thus, not only gratify his
feelings of revenge, but put a large sum of money into his pocket at the same
time.</p>
<p>It was a hateful business altogether, and just for a moment on Philip's lips
there trembled words that he might have been sorry for after-wards. He was on
the verge of a violent quarrel with his father, but he restrained himself just
in time. He could see that there was nothing to be gained by such a course, in
fact, everything to lose. Saltburn's idea was to humiliate the Cranwallises and
bring them down to such an extent that Lady Edna would be only too glad to find
herself the wife of a man who could stand between her and dishonour, and also
the wife of a man who would some day be the master of Borne Abbey.</p>
<p>Doubtless William Saltburn was a great man in his way, but in this respect
he was a mere child, and no one knew it better than his own son. Lady Edna
would rather have died than accept such a way out, and Philip knew it in his
bones. He must keep his temper, he must hear all that his father had to say,
and fight that unscrupulous capitalist with his own weapons. And that fight
Philip resolved to carry through to the bitter end, even if it cost him the
last penny of his own private fortune.</p>
<p>"I think you are wrong," he said. "Perhaps I am a child in these matters,
but I shall never marry the woman that I hope to make my wife by following on
the lines that you have mentioned. You know nothing of such people."</p>
<p>William Saltburn's big voice boomed out with a confidence of a conqueror. He
had a good deal to say, and he said it in his own particularly offensive
manner. But he had no time to argue. There was a debate going on in the House
in which he intended to take a part, and that debate was in connection with the
Foreign Office vote. If Philip liked to hear it he could.</p>
<p>"I think I should," he said.</p>
<p>A few minutes later and he was seated in the Strangers' Gallery, listening
to what was going on on the floor of the House. The Speaker was not in the
Chair, because the House was sitting in Supply, with the Chairman presiding,
and presently William Saltburn rose from his seat on the Opposition side of the
House below the gangway, and began to address the Chair.</p>
<p>He plunged into his subject at once, and moved the adjournment of the
committee in connection with certain Foreign Office allowances. From this he
glided dexterously into an attack on the Government in connection with the
Tortina concessions.</p>
<p>To the ordinary listener there was nothing in this, but Philip could see
clearly enough that every word was a hit at the Foreign Secretary. And there
were other men in the House who knew it too&mdash;the financial group for the
most part&mdash;and these were interested enough. And so Saltburn went on for
the best part of half-an-hour whilst Philip listened, almost unconscious of the
fact that a man there, seated by his side, was almost as deeply interested as
he was himself.</p>
<p>"Wonderful man, Saltburn," the stranger said. "A pity he's such an
unscrupulous rascal."</p>
<p>Philip turned sharply to the speaker, who had put into words the thought
that was uppermost in his mind. He saw a slim, well-dressed man, with dark hair
and eyes, evidently a man of Spanish or Italian descent.</p>
<p>"Do you know Saltburn?" Phillip asked guardedly.</p>
<p>"Well, I know all about him," the stranger said. "You see, I am a native of
Tortina myself, and I happen to know the story. Japan doesn't care twopence
about those concessions, neither does America for that matter. Saltburn wanted
those concessions himself, but Sherringborne's lot were in front of him, and he
has never forgotten it. If you are a student of politics you must see that
Sherringborne is being attacked. Ah! if El Murid had only held on a little
longer, this would never have happened."</p>
<p>"I don't quite follow," Phillip said.</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps I am saying too much," the other man responded. "Perhaps I
ought not to have mentioned Lord Sherringborne. You might know him."</p>
<p>"I do, indeed," Philip said. "He's my good friend, and I would do anything
to help him."</p>
<p>"I am glad to hear that," the other man said. "Because I think I can assist
you. It's like this. If Sherringborne can be dragged into publicity over this
business, then those concession shares will be worthless. Saltburn can buy them
at his own price. But if things develop in another direction, then all that
money will be saved, and Lord Sherringborne will he cleared. He will make a
fortune out of his investments. Do you know anything about Tortina?"</p>
<p>"I've been to St. Lucia," Phillip said.</p>
<p>"Oh, you have. Then I suppose you know all about El Murid, and how he was
intrigued out of office by that traitorous rascal Santa Anna. That, of course,
was the beginning of El Murid's troubles. I suppose you know why he committed
suicide?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I don't," Philip said.</p>
<p>"Well, he killed himself because he feared that he could not keep faith with
his friends. He thought that he had ruined Sherringborne amongst others, and
the idea drove him to despair. If you could get hold of his papers now, you
could expose the whole conspiracy. I happen to know this because I was one of
El Murid's secretaries. In those papers is the whole story, and I don't think
that even Saltburn could face the world if it came out. Of course, with his
vast resources, he has stirred up the yellow press in three capitals to make
all this fuss. I tell you, Japan doesn't care a scrap about those island
concessions. All she wants is for St. Lucia to be made a treaty port. What she
fears is that St. Lucia will be fortified and that America will expect to hold
a brief for Tortina through the Munro Doctrine."</p>
<p>Philip was beginning to see daylight.</p>
<p>"But what about the islands?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, the islands," the other laughed. "The outlying group of islands belong
to Japan already, and, as to the rest, they are part of the Corel Group. No
fortifications could stand on them. A big tidal wave or an earthquake, and they
would be gone. Besides, have you ever thought of San Toro?"</p>
<p>"San Toro?" Philip said. "That's the tiny republic lower down on the
coast."</p>
<p>"Yes, that is so, and there is the site of one of the finest harbours in the
world."</p>
<p>At that moment someone tapped Philip's loquacious acquaintance on the
shoulder and he vanished, leaving Saltburn to his own troubled thoughts.</p>
<p>Gradually, by degrees, his mind came back to what was going on beneath him.
His father was still speaking, and a moment later Philip heard San Toro
mentioned. William Saltburn was suggesting San Toro as a way out of the
difficulty. Why not, he said, allow the trouble over Tortina to lapse into
forgetfulness, and establish a big treaty port at San Toro? And with that
Philip knew beyond a doubt that it was in San Toro that his father's chief
interests lay. He was going to break up Sherringborne and disgrace him, he was
going to buy those Tortina Concessions at his own price, and eventually get all
his money back through the big new scheme in connection with San Toro.</p>
<p>Philip sat just for a moment, turning this discovery over in his mind, then
he rose quietly and left the House, and turned into Palace Yard. Outside he met
the very man he was looking for, a member of the House on his way home.</p>
<p>"Behold, thou art the man, Yardley," he said, "I suppose you wouldn't mind
taking up a little matter of business even at this late hour?"</p>
<p>"You're right there," Yardley replied. "Things are not so good on the Stock
Exchange at all that. Which way are you going? Why not come far as my rooms? We
can settle the whole matter over a cigar."</p>
<p>Philip turned and walked with his companion. They ware settled presently in
Yardley's luxurious chambers.</p>
<p>"I don't want this thing talked about," Philip said. "But I have a fancy to
have a flutter on a fairly big scale in those Tortina Concessions. Can you get
me forty thousand of them?"</p>
<p>Yardley whistled softly.</p>
<p>"A hundred and forty thousand if you like," he said. "I suppose you know
those things are an absolute drug on the market? You can get them at
practically your own price, and, besides, there will be heavy 'calls'
presently."</p>
<p>"I am quite prepared to risk all that," Philip said. "If I lose the whole
sum, there will be no harm done. The question is, will you buy these things for
me? I only make one stipulation, and that is that the account is not opened
before two o'clock to-morrow. I'll put it all down on paper if you like, but I
suppose my word is good enough."</p>
<p>"Your word is quite good enough for me," Yardley said. "And I will undertake
this business for you with pleasure of course. It seems to me that I am the
only one likely to make anything out of the deal. Still, that is no business of
mine."</p>
<p>It was nearly 1 o'clock when Philip strolled home-wards. Once there he
reached for the telephone directory, and looked up Sherringborne's number at
Borne Abbey. It was very late of course, but he knew that the secretary's
office at Borne Abbey was not likely to be closed for the next hour or so.
There would certainly be much business transacted following on that night's
debate in the House of Commons. Presently an impatient voice spoke at the other
end of the wire.</p>
<p>"Is that you, Hardy?" Philip asked. "It's Saltburn speaking to you. Oh, yes.
I want you to send over to Baron de la Croisa's cottage and ask him to come and
speak to me. Oh, yes, I know that it is very late, and that the Baron has gone
to bed, but this matter is of the greatest importance. You can tell the Baron
that I want him, and he will come at once. I'm very sorry to trouble you, but
the matter admits of no delay. And besides, the business is as much Lord
Sherringborne's as it is mine."</p>
<p>There was a certain amount of grumbling and muttering at the other end of
the wire, but that did not trouble Saltburn in the least. He hung up the
receiver and waited patiently for an hour or so before the bell rippled out
again.</p>
<p>It was not a long conversation which Philip had with the Baron, but it
seemed to satisfy him, for he went to bed presently in the enviable frame of
mind with the consciousness that he had done a good evening's work. He had
scarcely finished his breakfast the next morning before de la Croisa
appeared.</p>
<p>"You are certainly a wonderful young man," the latter said. "And your ideas
are magnificent, too. You are a modern Sir Galahad. In the old days you would
have made an excellent Knight of the Round Table. And you have a way, too, of
scattering your money about which is truly regal. I suppose you fully realise
what you are undertaking?"</p>
<p>"I am undertaking nothing that I cannot meet," Philip said quietly. "And I
am going to lose nothing. On the contrary, I am going to gain a large sum of
money."</p>
<p>"And you stand to lose all you've got."</p>
<p>"That may be so of course, still, I am quite ready to back my own opinion. I
feel perfectly certain that there is going to be no trouble, and that in less
than a year's time Sherringborne's great scheme will be established on a firm
basis. And we shall have Japan to thank for that. In fact, I shouldn't be at
all surprised if that is not part of the whole scheme. At any rate, I shall be
able to save Lord Sherringborne. I can relieve him of a terrible anxiety, and
when the questions are asked as to whether or not he has holdings in Tortina he
will be quite justified in saying that he hasn't. Now, do you think my policy
is sound?"</p>
<p>De la Croisa declined to say anything further. As a matter of fact, he knew
perfectly well that Philip's policy was a correct one. And he suggested
guardedly that Philip was quite old enough and wise enough to exercise his own
discretion.</p>
<p>"There is only one thing to be done now," the latter said. "And that is to
bring Lord Sherringborne's broker into contact with my man Yardley. I want them
to come together quite in a natural way, and as if they had met promiscuously
in the ordinary course of business. Your broker has a large block to sell and
mine wants to buy. There's the whole thing in a nutshell. I am going to leave
this entirely in your hands, because I am quite sure it will be safe with you.
Then you can let Lord Sherringborne know later on in the day that he is
relieved of his most pressing source of anxiety. Once that is done, it won't be
long before he is quite himself again."</p>
<p>"And what are you going to do?" de la Croisa asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am going to pursue the policy of masterly inactivity," Philip
laughed. "I want to be out of the way where no awkward questions will be asked
and where I shall be incapable of doing any further mischief. Besides, I am
interested in all those repairs we are making at The Chantrey. I suppose you
will be back at Borne Abbey before night? If you are, you might look in at my
quarters and let me know if everything has gone off satisfactorily."</p>
<p>"I will do that with pleasure," the Baron said. "I certainly think you are
wise in getting out of London as soon as possible. But quite between ourselves,
if your forecast turns out to be a shrewd one, it would be awkward for your
father."</p>
<p>"It will go a long way to ruining him," Philip said coolly. "But he is
bringing it upon himself. It is not a bad thing for a man to realise that he is
not infallible. But I think it will be safe to leave my father to himself."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.&mdash;WHOSE HAND?</h2>
<p>Undoubtedly Sherringborne was getting better. He was reaping the reward now
of a careful and well-preserved life. He was still very weak and shaky; he had
not altogether got rid of the nervous play of his muscles. But he was up and
dressed, and he had insisted upon coming down into one of the drawing-rooms,
where he was seated over certain papers after lunch.</p>
<p>Lady Edna was busy writing there, so deeply engrossed indeed that she did
not notice the entrance of one of the assistant secretaries with a letter which
had just arrived by special messenger. The secretary discreetly disappeared,
and Sherringborne proceeded to open the letter in his own deliberate way. As he
read, the letter fluttered from his fingers, and he staggered to his feet
trembling with excitement from head to foot. A queer cry came from his lips.
Something between a laugh and a groan. Lady Edna dropped her pen, and hurried
to her father's side in a state of agitation and alarm.</p>
<p>"What is the matter?" she asked.</p>
<p>Sherringborne appeared to recover himself with an effort.</p>
<p>"It is nothing," he said hoarsely. "Whatever you do, don't ring the bell. I
shall be quite right in a minute or two. I have had some good news, which has
been rather too much for me. I never dreamed of anything like this. This letter
is from de la Croisa. But, of course, you wouldn't understand it if I told you.
Help me into my chair, my dear. And don't speak to me for a minute or two. This
good news will do me more good than all Harley-street put together."</p>
<p>Sherringborne leaned back in his chair for a minute or two with closed eyes.
He appeared to be unconscious as to what was going on around him.</p>
<p>But the colour was creeping back to his face, and Edna deemed it more
prudent to leave him to himself.</p>
<p>The letter lay face up-wards on the carpet, so that it was almost impossible
not to read the dozen lines or so, dashed off there in the Baron's neat
handwriting. Almost before Lady Edna was aware of the fact she had read the
whole letter.</p>
<p>She could not grasp it all, of course; she had not sufficient business
knowledge for that. But she had seen quite enough to realise what had happened.
To a great extent, the cloud of disgrace and shame had been lifted from the
house of Cranwallis, and for this she had to thank the man whose father had
once been the boot-boy in the scullery at Borne Abbey.</p>
<p>A great wave of red dyed Lady Edna's face, but that flush was no flush of
shame. She ought to have been cast down and humiliated, she told herself, and
here, on the contrary, she was glad to know that Philip Saltburn had done this
thing. It was just like him, she admitted to herself. There was no man of her
acquaintance capable of an act like this. Here was the class of man her brother
ought to have been.</p>
<p>And now there was shame and humiliation in her mind as she contrasted
Shorland with Philip Saltburn. She picked up the letter and laid it on the
table; then Sherringborne opened his eyes.</p>
<p>He looked a different man already. A certain firmness had come back into his
lips, his eyes were eager and en-sanguined.</p>
<p>"Did I tell you what had happened?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Only the outline," Lady Edna said quietly. "But I have read it all for
myself. It lay at my feet and I couldn't help seeing it. And, besides, it seems
to me that I am directly concerned. Now will you please tell me how exactly we
stand. Will you tell me how it comes about that we are beholden to a man who is
the son of a convict? I am not using my own expression&mdash;it is one of
Shorland's elegant metaphors."</p>
<p>It was a long time before Edna began to understand. And there was something
halting in Sherringborne's explanation. There were a great many technical and
legal words, too, connected with the higher flights of finance, but it seemed
to Lady Edna that she had mastered them at length. To a great extent this had
been the opening of a new world to her.</p>
<p>She had taken it for granted up to now that Sherringborne owed his position
entirely to his rank and his birth. She had always accepted it as an axiom that
the masses must be governed by the classes, even after the war, and the power
of the new democracy left her still cold and uncomprehending.</p>
<p>She turned this over in her mind for the rest of the afternoon. And she had
quite a feminine curiosity now to see de la Croisa, whom she knew would be far
more candid than her father. De la Croisa failed to put in an appearance,
however; he did not even come in after dinner, as was his invariable custom.
And Lady Edna was surprised to find how eager and impatient she was for further
details.</p>
<p>She would have all the long evening to herself, for the doctor had been
arbitrary in his instructions that Sherringborne should retire early.</p>
<p>It was a perfect night, still and beautiful, so that Lady Edna was tempted
out on the terrace. It was no far cry either to the Baron's cottage, and it
would be some time yet before the daylight failed. But for once in a way, it
fell out that the Baron was not at home. He had gone out to dinner, said the
faithful Francois, without giving any idea where he was going.</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but for Lady Edna to retrace her steps. She had
reached the park again when she came in contact with the man who was uppermost
in her mind. She intended to be gratefully polite and gracious, but she could
not keep the tinge of colour from her cheeks or the smile from her eyes, and
Philip Saltburn saw it too, and in some dim way he realised that she knew
everything. He would have passed her with a few words had she not stopped and
held out her hand.</p>
<p>"I was going to see de la Croisa, too," Philip explained. "But if he is not
at home it is no use my going further."</p>
<p>He turned and walked by Lady Edna's side. Just for a moment there was an
awkward silence between them. It was the girl who spoke first. She turned to
Saltburn with a clear gaze and proud, honest eyes, which he admired so
much.</p>
<p>"I am very glad I met you, Mr. Saltburn," she said, "because there are
certain things which I am bound to say to you. I don't know why you should go
out of your way to be so good to us as you are. I am sure you owe us nothing,
indeed, when I think of the way in which my unfortunate brother&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Need we discuss him?" Saltburn asked.</p>
<p>"I am afraid so. I cannot forget the way in which Shorland insulted you, and
the manner in which you behaved. And now, I understand that you have gone
further. I understand that you have taken this terrible burden from our
shoulders and saddled yourself with the responsibility which is more that one
man ought to bear."</p>
<p>"I am sorry to hear it," Philip said.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know all about it, you see. I know that there was a kind of
conspiracy between the Baron and yourself, because I saw what he wrote to my
father this afternoon. Then I insisted upon being told everything."</p>
<p>"Why?" Philip asked. "Why?"</p>
<p>"It seemed to me that I had a right to be told. And my father has been good
enough to give me a lesson in finance. I flatter myself that I am an apt pupil.
I am almost able to appreciate your subtle distinction between honesty and
business. I almost believe I should be able to pass an examination in that
extraordinary operation which is called 'rigging the market.'"</p>
<p>There was a ring of almost passionate scorn in Lady Edna's voice. But the
haughtiness had left her face now, and Saltburn could see that her lips were
trembling.</p>
<p>"There is no occasion to speak that way," he said. "For, after all, it is no
fault of yours that humanity is so poor a thing. Neither is Lord Sherringborne
so much to blame. He is very indiscreet if you like, and no public man has a
right to dabble in these matters. Besides, it is not fair to the other members
of the Government. After all, I have done nothing. I have risked a certain
number of thousands of pounds which will not cause me the loss of an hour's
sleep if I lose them. There is only one man who will be disappointed."</p>
<p>"And who is that?" Lady Edna asked.</p>
<p>"My father. He will be furious when he knows everything. But he has not
behaved very well. Oh, can't you see why I am so anxious to get away from all
connection with this modern business? Can't you see why I fell in love with The
Chantrey? And there are other reasons which I cannot mention. I have only one
great regret, and that is that you found all this out. I didn't want you to
know&mdash;I didn't even want Lord Sherringborne to know."</p>
<p>"But why?" Lady Edna asked.</p>
<p>Philip laughed somewhat unsteadily.</p>
<p>"Some day, perhaps, I will tell you," he said. "But not yet. Still, this
affair has not been without its advantages. I think it has done you good. I am
sure it has broadened your outlook on things. It is not altogether right that a
girl like yourself should imagine that she is made of superior clay to other
people. Now, confess it, Lady Edna, haven't you learnt something from your
lesson?"</p>
<p>Lady Edna listened in a dreamy sort of way. It seemed impossible that any
ordinary man would be talking to her like that. She told herself that she ought
to have been furiously angry, she ought to be haughty and dignified. She should
have treated this presumptuous young man with cold, cutting scorn.</p>
<p>But she was not in the least angry. On the contrary, she felt strangely
softened, she was conscious of a certain wild, unreasonable happiness for which
she would have been utterly at a loss to account.</p>
<p>And the man by her side, though so quiet, so strong, and reliable and calm,
was treating her as no man had ever treated her before. Her father had always
assumed her to be a girl almost incapable of understanding the machinery of
affairs, and yet here was Saltburn talking to her as if she were on a level
with himself, and she, instead of being annoyed, was flustered and
flattered.</p>
<p>She laughed somewhat unsteadily.</p>
<p>"I ought to be very angry with you," she said.</p>
<p>"I don't see why," Saltburn said. "Besides, it is quite true. But at the
same time I am sorry that you found this out, because it handicaps me. You see,
I had hopes&mdash;but what am I talking about? The beauty of the evening is
getting into my head."</p>
<p>"But I must thank you," Lady Edna exclaimed. "Really. I must. What should we
have done without you? Oh, I would give a great deal if my brother were like
you."</p>
<p>"That is a compliment, I suppose," Saltburn said. "Then you would like me
for a brother?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I would," Lady Edna murmured.</p>
<p>"I am afraid that wouldn't satisfy me," Saltburn said audaciously. "Now, if
I could only hear you say that you would like to have&mdash;"</p>
<p>He paused, fearful that he had gone too far. And he could see from the red
that had flamed into Lady Edna's face that she understood. But she did not
break away from him indignantly, she did not turn upon him a face of scorn. Her
lips parted in a smile as she walked demurely by his side.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.&mdash;STEEL AND VELVET.</h2>
<p>To quote one of his own pet phrases. William Saltburn constantly had his
finger on the pulse of the market. It was his business to watch the
fluctuations of stocks and shares as carefully as a mother watches her child.
It was the same labour of love to him and his unerring instinct never led him
far wrong.</p>
<p>It was not a difficult matter, therefore, for him to discover that some
audacious outsider, was interfering with his operations in Tortina Concessions.
It seemed almost incredible that any ordinary business man should step
deliberately into the path of a financial lion like William Saltburn. And there
were signs, too, that the thing had been done quite deliberately.</p>
<p>Saltburn was not so much annoyed as curious. He was desirous of knowing the
name of the humble individual who had done this thing. In a way, Saltburn was
sorry enough. He was a good fighter himself, and therefore a great admirer of
courage in others. This was by no means the first time that an opponent had put
up a fight, but of recent years such combativeness had been rare, and Saltburn
was wont to deplore the fact that the city did not display as much pluck as it
used to.</p>
<p>Of course, it was absolutely necessary, and that at once, to break down this
audacious person. The thing had had to be done on occasions before, and when it
was over, Saltburn had sometimes extended a generously contemptuous hand to the
man he had ruined, quite in the ordinary way of business. He gave his
confidential secretary instructions now to find out who this man was, and to
adopt the ordinary means of getting rid of him. At the end of a fortnight the
secretary was bound to admit that he could not find any trace of the foe, and
that very reluctantly he had been compelled to fall back upon his employer.
Saltburn raved and stormed in his usual way, and then he set out to get the
news for himself. But another fortnight elapsed before he stumbled on the
truth, and that, more or less, by accident.</p>
<p>Really, it was an excellent joke. To think that Philip, of all men in the
world, should be going out of his way to so worry his own father. Saltburn sent
for his son to dine with him, and the latter came obediently enough.</p>
<p>"This is a nice way you are treating me," William Saltburn said. "Try one of
those cigars, my boy. Even the King can't get tobacco like that. So you are
anxious to get rid of your money as soon as possible. I suppose you think that
it doesn't matter, seeing that you will get plenty from me some day?"</p>
<p>"I am not so sure of that, sir," Philip said quietly.</p>
<p>William Saltburn smiled pitifully.</p>
<p>"Ah, what it is to be young and sanguine," he said. "If people with no money
weren't sanguine, half the officers in the city would have to put their
shutters up. Oh, I begin to understand why you have done this foolish thing.
It's very magnificent, my boy, but I don't suppose it will make the slightest
difference to Lady Edna Cranwallis. She won't be any more likely to marry you
because you have succeeded in gambling away a handsome fortune."</p>
<p>"We shall see," Philip smiled.</p>
<p>"My boy, aristocrats hold their noses very high, and profess to have a great
contempt for a mere business man, but they are not indifferent to the value of
money. Lord bless you, I know them. They despise me, they shrug their shoulders
when my name is mentioned, and speak of me as quite an impossible man. But that
don't prevent them from coming and fawning and flattering on me, my boy."</p>
<p>"But that isn't friendship," Philip argued.</p>
<p>"That don't prevent them asking me to dinner. Lord bless your soul, I could
hang up my hat in half the ducal houses in England, and they would be glad to
see me. They are all on the make, Phil, just as well as most people. And you
may depend upon it, that Lady Edna has her eye-teeth cut like the rest of
'em."</p>
<p>Philip writhed about uneasily in his chair. This was his father's mood, when
he hated most. William Saltburn sat there now with his thumbs in his armholes,
his red, strong face filled with complacent good-humoured contempt. The protest
which rose to Philip's lips died away again, for what was the good of it? His
father would not understand.</p>
<p>"If I lose my money," he said, "well then, I must. But the point is, I don't
think I shall. I know in these matters your judgment is much more valuable than
mine, but the greatest financier makes mistakes, and I believe you are making
one now. Napoleon, did so. In fact, he made more than one mistake."</p>
<p>"Oh, Napoleon was a fool," Saltburn exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Very likely. Possibly because he was puffed up with conceit. If you are
right and I am wrong, then I lose a quarter of a million of money. If, on the
other hand, I am right, what do you lose?"</p>
<p>Just for a moment William Saltburn looked grave.</p>
<p>"Well, I should have to start again," he admitted. "I've got every penny
that I can scrape together in South America. If everything goes right I can
pretty well mould her future policy. By gad, I shall be the greatest man in
Europe."</p>
<p>"And if Japan stands firm?" Philip asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, why do you go harping on that string? Japan will go her own way. I have
told you so before. I know the Japs, and I know what they are after. They
cannot fool me."</p>
<p>"And the whole thing is merely a blind to hide a real live policy
elsewhere?" Philip suggested. "You see what I mean, I have profound respect for
Prince Ito, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>But William Saltburn declined to discuss this view. It seemed to him that he
was displaying an exemplary amount of patience with a headstrong boy who was
bent on ruining himself for purely quixotic motives. As a matter of fact,
Philip was telling his father more than he imagined.</p>
<p>William Saltburn chuckled to himself now because it seemed to him that he
knew perfectly well why Philip had plunged over the Tortina business. For the
time being he had saved the face of Lord Sherringborne, but from William
Saltburn's point of view all this could have been managed without risk of
losing any of his money.</p>
<p>"You've gone about it the wrong way, my lad," he said. "You should have left
it to me. I would have cleared the field for you all right. I could have bent
Sherringborne's proud neck and dragged his good name in the mud. And I would
have humbled the pride of her ladyship, too. Before she had done with me, she
would have been glad enough to marry any decent fellow capable of giving her a
comfortable home."</p>
<p>Philip smiled grimly.</p>
<p>"Of course, when matters have blown over, it would be nice for you to be
able to say you had married a Cranwallis. And, I daresay I should have been
able to have got hold of Borne Abbey for you. But you must needs come
blundering into it like this. You expect to find Lady Edna grateful, don't you?
But she won't even thank you, my boy. And when you ask her to marry you, she
will treat you like dirt."</p>
<p>It was absolutely impossible for Philip to argue with crass ignorance like
this. It seemed to him that he had never seen his father so hopelessly vulgar
before.</p>
<p>"Why do you want to wreck Sherringborne?" he asked.</p>
<p>William Saltburn's face flushed darkly.</p>
<p>"He's such an insolent beggar," he said. "He is so infernally polite, and
yet, at the back of it all, you can see that he thinks that he is
condescending. Break him up, root and branch, I say. Drag him down into the
mud. Let him know eventually that the boy who used to be in his father's
kitchen is now the master of his fortunes. Lord bless you, I've got no personal
animosity against the man. But, all the same, I am going to bring his nose to
the mud. And when I tell him who I am&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You are looking forward to that?" Philip asked quietly.</p>
<p>"That's the idea," William Saltburn said.</p>
<p>"Ah, well, in that case you will be disappointed. You may be surprised to
hear that Lord Sherringborne knows that already. You see, they had some inkling
of it even when I was at Oxford. It may perhaps be news to you, but my friends
up there used to call me 'the Convict.'"</p>
<p>"Called you what?" Saltburn shouted.</p>
<p>"It was all done in a good-natured way, of course, and it never made the
slightest difference to me, but the fact remains. It was Shorland who first of
all began to talk. He had it from some old stable help who used to be hanging
about the house when you were a boy at Borne Abbey. Shorland, of course, is a
bounder of the worst possible type, and he was good enough to acquaint Lady
Edna with your antecedents before my face."</p>
<p>"And what did you say?" Saltburn asked.</p>
<p>"Well, in most houses that would have been a very awkward moment, indeed. It
would be impossible for me to tell you how well Lady Edna behaved. They are
treating me just as if I were a guest in the house, and, in addition to that,
at any rate, till quite recently, neither Sherringborne nor his daughter knew
that I had gone out of my way to help them. And these are the people you want
to ruin."</p>
<p>William Saltburn pulled sulkily at his cigar. Just for the moment the
tobacco which the King could not get seemed to have lost its flavour. If Philip
were correct, then it seemed to William Saltburn that for once in his life he
had done a foolish thing. And highly successful men with a firm belief in
themselves do not care to make these confessions.</p>
<p>"Oh! nonsense," he said. "They are only civil to you because they are afraid
of you. Of course they are afraid of me, which comes to the same thing. I am
not saying that I have not made a mistake."</p>
<p>"That is very magnanimous of you," Philip said.</p>
<p>"Now, I don't want any of your impudence, my lad. Still, the thing is done,
and there's an end of it. You'll be humble enough before Christmas comes. Of
course, it's rather a staggerer for me to find that Sherringborne knows all
this. Still, my policy is my policy, and I wouldn't alter it if Lady Edna came
to me on her bended knees and asked me to alter it."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't wait for that," Philip said dryly.</p>
<p>"You go your own way and I'll go mine. And when you've lost all your money
come along to your old dad, and he'll set you on your feet again. The fact of
the matter is, Philip, that these people have spoilt you. You are a young man
with very little knowledge of the world, and you are flattered. I have seen the
same thing often before."</p>
<p>Philip was content to let it go at that. He got away presently somewhat
relieved to find that he had emerged from the interview without the suggestion
of a quarrel.</p>
<p>He had expected to meet his father in one of the latter's most aggressive
moods. He had looked forward to dark threats, unless he got out of his position
without delay. On the other hand, he had been treated very much like a spoilt
child, who insists on eating something that is not good for him. Therefore, on
the whole, he went down again to Borne Abbey on very good terms with
himself.</p>
<p>He was glad to find Sherringborne so much better; he did not fail to note
the warmth of Lady Edna's smile, and the friendly pressure of the handshake. De
la Croisa was in good spirits, too, for the threatening cloud seemed to be
lifting, though as yet the Baron had had not definite news from his envoy in
St. Lucia.</p>
<p>The Baron was in the garden arguing, as usual, with McKillop as to the
latter's treatment of his roses. Sherringborne was there too, listening to the
quarrel with a smile of amusement on his face.</p>
<p>"You'll stay and lunch with us, Saltburn, of course," he said. "I am rather
expecting an important guest, but that will not make any difference if you will
excuse me directly after-wards, McKillop appears to be getting the worst of
it."</p>
<p>The gardener retreated presently, defeated but defiant, and the Baron took
Philip aside.</p>
<p>"I rather wanted to have a little chat with you," he said. "Do you know, my
dear young friend, you have behaved exceedingly well. In fact, a great deal
better than I knew of. The most satisfactory part is that Lady Edna knows. I
didn't tell her."</p>
<p>"And I can safely say the same thing," Philip replied. "My dear Baron, you
don't think for a moment&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Certainly not," de la Croisa smiled. "I am quite sure you would not stoop
to a subterfuge like that. Of course, you have your pride. When you ask a girl
to be your wife you would expect her to marry you for yourself. Now, come
along, and let's go in to lunch. McKillop is an obstinate old man, and an
argument with him always gives me an appetite."</p>
<p>Luncheon was served in one of the smaller dining-rooms, and Sherringborne
stood on the terrace consulting his watch. A moment or two later a car came up
to the front, and a little dark man jumped out full of apologies.</p>
<p>"Not at all, my dear Prince," Sherringborne said. "My daughter and the
Baron, you know, of course. This is Mr. Philip Saltburn&mdash;his Highness
Prince Ito."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;BREAD AND SALT.</h2>
<p>Philip bowed gravely enough. He was quite sincere in saying that he was glad
to meet the distinguished Japanese statesman. He was an astute young man
enough, and it needed no outsider to tell him that this lunch party was
something more than mere conventional politeness on Sherringborne's part.</p>
<p>"I happened to be staying in the neighbourhood," the Prince said. "And as I
have not seen Lord Sherringborne since his illness, I thought I might take the
liberty of inviting myself here to lunch. This is quite a friendly visit.
Indeed, it would be sacrilege almost to discuss politics on such a heavenly
day. Besides, I believe Lord Sherringborne has been strictly forbidden to do
any work for the present."</p>
<p>"That is so," Sherringborne said gravely.</p>
<p>"Then I will bow to the doctor's orders," the Prince said. "Mr. Saltburn, I
am pleased to meet you. I know all about your father, of course. We have been
antagonists on one or two occasions, and I am bound to confess that I have not
always had the best of it. But my time may come."</p>
<p>All this was said easily enough, and in the best possible English. Indeed,
but for the sallowness of his skin and the Oriental slant of his dark eyes,
Prince Ito might have passed for a European gentleman of leisure. He was
dressed quite in the English style, and his brown flannel suit fitted him to
perfection.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was a certain half-amused gleam in his eyes as he
spoke of his tourneys with William Saltburn. He suggested to Philip that the
next time on which the diplomats and capitalists met on the field, Saltburn was
not likely to get the best of it.</p>
<p>It was an interesting luncheon, for the Prince spoke surprisingly well, and
Philip regretted when at length the meal came to an end. He went off presently
with de la Croisa and Lady Edna to see something out of the common in the way
of roses, leaving Sherringborne and his distinguished guest to their cigars and
coffee in the sunshine out on the terrace.</p>
<p>"You are looking far better than I expected," the Prince said. "I am glad
now that I took the liberty of coming over to see you. Now, when do you expect
to be in harness again? I am bound to admit, my dear lord, that the question is
not altogether a disinterested one. You see, I am quite candid."</p>
<p>"Well, I am practically in harness now," Sherringborne explained. "It's
true, I haven't been in town, but I have transacted a lot of business. You see,
that's one of the advantages of being in the Upper House. If there's anything
wanting to be said to me, speak freely by all means."</p>
<p>Prince Ito hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"I was wondering," he said slowly, "if you had done anything with those
Tortinas. Of course, it is quite outside our province, but in certain
circumstances any action of yours might make a difference to us."</p>
<p>The Prince spoke with his eyes on the distant landscape. The expression on
his face was one of peace and contentment with the beauty of his
surroundings.</p>
<p>"My policy is plain enough," Sherringborne said. "I always believe in
playing with all my cards on the table. If I could carry out my scheme,
thousands of people would be saved from ruin, and Tortina would be in a better
position than ever. But, obviously, my dear Ito, it is the policy of Saltburn
to thwart me at every turn."</p>
<p>"Aided by certain other capitalists," Ito said. "By the way, I was rather
taken with that young man who was lunching here to-day. Of course, I know who
he is, but he seems to have been made from quite different stuff from his
father. And he is not operating on his father's advice, either. Really, you
ought to be proud to find a son of William Saltburn's putting his money on the
Secretary of Foreign Affairs."</p>
<p>The words dropped carelessly enough from Ito's lips; he appeared to be given
over to the enjoyment of his cigar. Sherringborne shot a keen glance at him. He
was wondering how much the Prince knew.</p>
<p>"Philip Saltburn is a fine young fellow," he said. "Of course, I know he has
been buying Tortinas on a big scale; the Baron told me this."</p>
<p>"So I understand," Ito said. "You see, it is my business to know all these
things. It struck me at the time how strange it was that we should see the
father on one side, and the son on the other. William Saltburn, of course, is
all for himself. He is one of the cleverest and, at the same time, one of the
most dangerous financiers in Europe, and, between ourselves, my dear
Sherringborne, I should not be sorry to see him safely out of the way. There
would be no possibility of a war between Japan and America at the present
moment if it were not for Saltburn and the group of capitalists who always
follow his lead. I think you agree with me."</p>
<p>"Precisely so," Sherringborne replied. "But is there going to be war between
Japan and the States? If there is, then my political career is at an end. I
shall go down to posterity as a failure or something worse. If, on the other
hand, this crisis can be averted, then I shall probably be hailed as a great
public benefactor. But still, I have an idea that you people won't fight. To be
perfectly candid, my dear Prince, I was rather hoping to see you stand up
against America."</p>
<p>"Oh, you flatter us," the Prince smiled.</p>
<p>"Not at all, not at all. Any firm action with regard to the Tortina question
on your part is certain to command our thoughtful consideration. And that
Monroe Doctrine can be carried too far."</p>
<p>"Again you flatter me," the Prince said quietly. "It is a great triumph for
us to think that our English allies treat us so seriously. You don't know how
you encourage us. If you are speaking on behalf of his Majesty's
Government&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What more do you want?" Sherringborne asked. "In this matter I am his
Majesty's Government. At any rate, I have the Cabinet behind me, and I have
quite a free hand in dealing with matters within my department. Of course, you
can't expect me to take sides. Our alliance is not altogether an offensive and
defensive one. But as we made it, we needn't go into that And there is one
thing, my dear Prince, that you can rely on. If, unfortunately, there should be
a quarrel between America and Japan, which we should all very much
deplore&mdash;"</p>
<p>Sherringborne paused, and Prince Ito smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes, it would be dreadful, wouldn't it?" the latter said. "But, of course,
it is within the bounds of possibility. I must say we are more or less prepared
for it. And nobody can say we are not justified. We must have room for
expansion on the Pacific. We cannot sit quietly down and see St. Lucia
practically an armed port under American suzerainty. A treaty port, if you
like, with Japan, exercising a benevolent neutrality on the outer islands. With
a navy like ours&mdash;"</p>
<p>"America will choose her own time," Sherringborne said.</p>
<p>"Because of her geographical advantages. Well, that is the position we stand
in to-day, and, really, between ourselves, if I felt quite sure that England
would 'keep the ring' between America and Japan in case of trouble,
why&mdash;but really, I am talking at haphazard. The beauty of the day has got
into my head. I will say no more."</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, we should," Sherringborne said. "We are only idly
speculating, of course. Without wishing to hurt your feelings, you are bound to
admit that a quarrel between America and Japan can only have one issue."</p>
<p>"I quite agree with you," the Prince said dryly. "And so, whilst the trouble
is acute, we can rely upon England to stand by and act the part of
policeman."</p>
<p>Ito uttered the words quietly enough, but there was a certain suggestion of
gravity in his tone which Sherringborne perfectly understood.</p>
<p>"I will give my hand on that," he said. "And my solemn assurance that such
would be our policy. But, of course, you must guard against any change of
Government. I think we are good for another year or so, and perhaps more. But
don't, my dear Prince, allow yourself to take this fact into consideration. Our
foreign policy is fortunately practically continuous, and my successor will
probably take the same view."</p>
<p>"Then that is settled," Ito cried gaily. "Does it strike you, my dear
friend, that we may be making history at this particular moment? One of the
greatest fascinations in the career of a diplomatist is his opportunity for
making history."</p>
<p>"Well, keep it out of the papers," Sherringborne laughed. "The most exciting
history is that which never gets into print at all. It is really very good of
you to undertake this absolutely out of pure friendship."</p>
<p>"I owe you more than you know," Ito said half gravely.</p>
<p>"My dear Prince, you wiped out the debt today, anyway," Sherringborne said.
"Directly you define your policy, you enable me to tackle Tortina with a free
hand."</p>
<p>Prince Ito showed his teeth in a smile.</p>
<p>"We quite understand one another," he said. "And we keep our
lightheartedness to ourselves. And now, my lord, I must really drag myself
away. It is very charming here, of course, but I have certain matters to attend
to which will not brook further delay. I hope you don't mind my coming to see
you in this unceremonious fashion. We have so many formal interviews that an
occasional unbending&mdash;"</p>
<p>The Prince was gone at last, and Sherringborne sat there gazing in front of
him, and quite lost to the fact that his cigar had gone out. Then came de la
Croisa, who dropped into the chair vacated by the Prince, and glanced
significantly at his companion. Sherringborne came to himself with a start.</p>
<p>"Well?" de la Croisa asked. "Well?"</p>
<p>"It's practically settled," Sherringborne whispered. "I know I can trust
you. There will be no trouble between America and Japan over those Tortina
Concessions. We can defy William Saltburn now."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," the Baron murmured. "Perhaps."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;AN AUTUMN SESSION.</h2>
<p>London was very full for Parliament was sitting late that autumn and
Christmas was at hand and there was no sign as yet that overworked legislators
would be relieved of their duties.</p>
<p>Those who expected that Parliament would be prorogued to a later date were
disappointed, for both Houses were hard at it again before the end of January.
There was the usual amount of grumbling, of course. Members professed that they
could not see any reason for this unwonted display of energy. There was nothing
very startling before the country, and no particular crises, indeed nothing but
an excuse that business was behindhand, and needed bringing up to date.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there were one or two thoughtful people who saw trouble
ahead.</p>
<p>Possibly the trouble might be averted. There was no knowing. Still in case
of emergencies, Parliament was sitting, and the King's Ministers would know how
to deal with anything that came along.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there was nothing to worry about, and the papers were unusually
quiet. One or two of them hinted darkly of impending troubles in the East. They
prophesied as to what was likely to happen when America and Japan were at
loggerheads, but very few people regarded this as serious.</p>
<p>There was one man, however, who was by no means easy in his mind. Saltburn
had been so sure of his ground, so certain of his facts, that he had not
worried himself in the least. What mysterious hand was at work in high politics
between America and Japan over the Tortina affair? What hindered progress? And
yet the delay continued.</p>
<p>At any rate, if the little Far Eastern Power was bluffing, she was doing it
remarkably well. She was busy in other directions, too. It only remained now to
see how long the game was going to last. And if the worst came about, America
might make a concession and leave Japan without any pretext for an appeal to
arms. What then?</p>
<p>All the same, Saltburn was worried, and perhaps that was the reason why he
had taken no steps towards the crushing of Lord Sherringborne. And, on the face
of it, Sherringborne's position seemed to be stronger than ever. He had played
a strong hand with regard to Tortina financial obligations, and people who, a
few months ago, had been disposed to regard him as a poor financier, now began
to speak of him as a great genius.</p>
<p>Saltburn had smiled to himself, because it seemed to him that he could pull
down this glittering structure at any moment he pleased. He had his own agents
in St Lucia, and when the time came they would know how to act.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sherringborne was up in town, giving his brilliant dinners and
receptions, and Lady Edna was apparently in her element as one of the most
charming and successful hostesses.</p>
<p>Sherringborne preferred to dispense his hospitality at his own town house,
and there was a big reception this evening, which was not likely to be unduly
prolonged as Ministers generally were due to take part in the big debate.
Saltburn had been asked; indeed it seemed to him that of late Sherringborne had
gone out of his way to make himself agreeable.</p>
<p>And this easy politeness and calm ignoring of past disagreeableness was a
thing which always puzzled and irritated Saltburn. He did not like the method,
he could not understand two people differing without being ready to fly at one
another's throats like a couple of dogs over a bone. All his life he had fought
for all he could get, he had had little or no mercy for his opponent; indeed he
had the primeval instinct uppermost.</p>
<p>He was going to the reception, of course. He came along to it presently,
elbowing his way with characteristic fashion through a glittering mob of men
and women until he had fought his way to the top of the great black marble
staircase, where Lady Edna stood receiving her father's guests.</p>
<p>She looked very stately, very dignified and beautiful, as she stood there
with a gracious smile for Saltburn. Indeed, he could not disguise from himself
that she was receiving him with the same lofty amiability she had for a
duchess. And there was no suggestion of any particular desire to please him,
which Saltburn was compelled to admit. From his point of view, it seemed absurd
to suppose that this gracious goddess would consent to share Philip's lot
unless she were first humiliated and her pride brought low. Assuredly Philip
was going to work in the wrong way.</p>
<p>But Saltburn had other things to occupy his attention this evening. He was
anxious to see Van Hasvell, the diplomatist who had the American affairs in
hand in London just now. The regular Ambassador was away on sick leave, and the
brilliant and fascinating Hasvell had been temporarily selected for the
post.</p>
<p>Saltburn knew Hasvell well, he knew the latter to be no great diplomatist,
he was a great deal fonder of the theatre and the supper party. Of late, it
seemed to Saltburn that Van Hasvell was keeping out of his way, and the time
was coming when that elusive individual must be shown that Saltburn meant to
stand no nonsense.</p>
<p>Saltburn found him presently in the centre of an admiring group of women,
who seemed to be hanging on his lightest word. He was quite the typical
diplomatist of sensational fiction. His clothes fitted him to perfection, not a
single hair of his well-waxed moustache was out of place. A certain contempt
filled Saltburn and rose to his eyes. He strolled into the little group of
rustling silks and flashing diamonds, and caught Van Hasvell by the elbow quite
unceremoniously.</p>
<p>"Here," he said. "I want you."</p>
<p>The American's face flushed. All the same he turned to his fair companion
and murmured some excuse.</p>
<p>"What can I do for you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, cut all that out," Saltburn said brusquely. "I'm not a society
butterfly, and you weren't when I first met you. And why have you been keeping
out of my way lately?"</p>
<p>"Is that so?" Van Hasvell smiled. "You forget, my dear Saltburn, I am a man
of affairs. I have so many calls on my time. And as to keeping out of your
way&mdash;well&mdash;you are too suspicious, my friend. Now, what do you
want?"</p>
<p>Saltburn thrust out his chin doggedly.</p>
<p>"I want you to tell me the truth," he said. "If you have fooled me, if any
of you have fooled me&mdash;but you know what I am, and you know what to
expect. When you came over here there was a perfect understanding between us.
But what I want to know is, how much longer is this going on? I begin to see
that I made a mistake."</p>
<p>"We all do," Van Hasvell said sententiously.</p>
<p>"Oh, do we? Well, then, let me tell you that when I make a mistake thousands
of people have got to suffer for it. Now, I've been getting some information
lately, and it rather startled me. Egad, I began to think that the Japs are
going to get their way after all."</p>
<p>Van Hasvell smiled almost superciliously.</p>
<p>"Oh, really," he said. "But I can't discuss it with you, Saltburn. Then, you
see, I was a mere business man; now I am a representative of my country at St.
James's. You see the difference?"</p>
<p>"The poacher turned gamekeeper," Saltburn said grimly. "What I want to know
is, how this thing is going to be settled."</p>
<p>"I am exceedingly sorry, my dear Saltburn," Van Hasvell said smoothly. "I
assure you I have done all I can. I have been your partner more than
once&mdash;but I was in Wall-street then, remember. You are not really
suggesting that, for the sake of old times, I should discuss Government matters
with you? Besides, you're astute enough to draw your own conclusions. And I am
not the American Ambassador, anyway."</p>
<p>"So that's how the land lies," Saltburn grumbled. "And I was a fool to trust
you as far as I have. Still, if you will only tell me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I can tell you nothing," Van Hasvell said. "Sherringborne is a friend of
yours. Go and ask him, ask him if he believes there is any chance of a war
between America and Japan."</p>
<p>"He'd know, of course," Saltburn admitted sulkily.</p>
<p>At the same moment, Sherringborne walked smilingly by in animated
conversation with one of the secretaries from the American Embassy. Saltburn
began to wonder why the idea had not occurred to him before. Assuredly
Sherringborne knew whether there was a chance or not of an outbreak of
hostilities on the Pacific. Would it be possible, Saltburn wondered, to force
the truth from his host? For the moment the accident of circumstance had saved
Sherringborne, but the danger was by no means over. There might be trouble
arising from the direction of St Lucia yet.</p>
<p>Saltburn watched his host moodily from under his heavy eyebrows. Van
Hasvell, standing there, twisting his moustache, seemed to see what was passing
through the other's mind.</p>
<p>"You might be able to tap Sherringborne," he said. "By the way, what has
become of that erratic daughter-in-law of his? I haven't heard a word about her
for months. She went off with a great flourish of trumpets to give a series of
performances in Tortina, and there hasn't been a word about her in the papers
since."</p>
<p>Saltburn smiled grimly.</p>
<p>"She's not well, I believe," he said. "At any rate, I understand that she
has gone somewhere near San Francisco with a view to giving herself a rest. It
is a habit these spoilt actresses have got. At any rate, Shorland seems to take
it calmly enough. I was talking to him about his wife a day or two ago, and he
didn't seem to know any more about her than I did. I suppose he has got tired
of her. These sort of marriages never last. Besides, Shorland is a vicious
young fool that any woman's too good for. I suppose there will be a flaming
divorce there some day, and then the present Lady Shorland will console herself
with a Russian grand duke. Not that it matters."</p>
<p>Saltburn turned away as if he were done with the subject, and Van Hasvell
discreetly disappeared. Meanwhile William Saltburn sat there, amidst those
uncongenial surroundings, revolving a scheme in his mind. He wondered he had
not thought of it before. He was still busy with his project when Philip came
along, obviously in search of somebody. A certain sort of gratified pride
filled Saltburn as he looked at his son. At any rate, whatever his feelings
were, Philip appeared to be perfectly at home there. He came over to his
father's side and sat down just far a moment.</p>
<p>"I thought you weren't coming," he said.</p>
<p>"I changed my mind," Saltburn answered. "I wanted to have a little talk with
my young friend Van Hasvell, and I knew I should find him here."</p>
<p>"I hope you are satisfied with him," Philip said.</p>
<p>"Now, what the deuce do you mean by that?" Saltburn demanded. "As a matter
of fact, I am not a bit satisfied with him. I begin to believe that those
people have actually had the audacity to try and humbug me. Humbug me; mind.
But I think I showed Van Hasvell to-night that he's got a man to deal with. And
you will find that Japan dare not go too far. You get out of it, my boy, as
quickly as you can. Sell out, while you have the chance."</p>
<p>Philip shook his head smilingly. There rose to his mind the face and figure
of Prince Ito as he had seen him on that eventful afternoon on the terrace at
Borne Abbey.</p>
<p>"I think I'll hold on," he said quietly,</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;A QUESTION IN THE HOUSE.</h2>
<p>"Oh, very well, my boy, please yourself. You've got your lesson to learn,
and you might as well learn it now as years hence, when you have a family to
provide for and you can ill spare it."</p>
<p>"I'll go my own way," Philip said. "If I am wrong, then I shall be ready to
risk it. But I have a big prize to play for, and I must play according to my
own lights."</p>
<p>"Lady Edna," Saltburn scowled. "Lady Edna is&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Lady Edna. Pardon me, father, but there are some things that you don't
understand, and this is one of them."</p>
<p>"Oh, is it?" Saltburn sneered. "Made of different clay, and all that sort of
thing. If you take my advice&mdash;".</p>
<p>Philip smilingly refused to continue the discussion. Where his own point of
view was concerned he could be quite as obstinate as his father.</p>
<p>"I am not going to be frightened," he said. "I am going to stick to my guns,
and see the thing through to the end. As a matter of fact, I think I shall
increase my holding. Do you happen to be going down to the House tonight? If
you are I'll go with you. I want to see Yardley."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm going to the House right enough," Saltburn said grimly. "I ordered
my car to be here at half-past 10."</p>
<p>The spacious rooms were rapidly emptying now. Most of the guests connected
with politics had disappeared, and there was nothing for it but to follow
them.</p>
<p>Saltburn left Philip in the lobby, where the latter had to wait until the
man he had come in search of was found. The great hall was filled with a crowd
of journalists and others waiting the issue of the debate, which would be known
presently. As Philip sat on the stone ledge of the corridor he was accosted, to
his surprise, by de la Croisa. The latter had a soft hat pulled down over his
brows. His coat-collar covered him to the ears.</p>
<p>"This is a surprise," Philip said. "You are the last person I expected to
meet here, Baron. Are you afraid of being recognised by some older member?"</p>
<p>De la Croisa smiled just a little sadly.</p>
<p>"There is no place that changes so swiftly," he said, "as a House of
Commons. Ten years here is equivalent to a generation. There aren't a dozen men
in the House to-day who would recognise me if I took a seat on one of the front
benches. And if you were to mention my name to two-thirds of your legislators
they wouldn't know whom you meant."</p>
<p>"But what are you doing here?" Philip asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, put it down to idle curiosity," the Baron said. "But it is not quite
that. I saw you come in with your father just now. Has he begun to realise yet
that he stands a good chance of finding himself a poor man before many months
are over his head?"</p>
<p>"That's what I tell him," Philip said. "But he seems quite sure of his
ground. He tells me there will be no trouble in South America. And my father
speaks with authority."</p>
<p>"Really," De la Croisa said. "And how long would these suggested concessions
satisfy the Japanese? And suppose the Japanese take matters into their own
hands? Suppose they refuse to be satisfied? It is extremely unlikely, but it is
well to be prepared."</p>
<p>"Oh, I quite follow you," Philip said. "But I have thought out my policy and
I am going to hold to it. I think my father is making a great mistake. But I
cannot permit him to spoil my prospects, not even if it means his financial
ruin."</p>
<p>De la Croisa, looked at Philip with frank admiration.</p>
<p>"That's exactly what I hoped you would do," he said. "Within a week we shall
have some important news from Washington. In my opinion there will be a
compromise."</p>
<p>"You have special knowledge?" Philip asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, my dear boy, that is not for me to say. I will trust you as far as I
can. You have behaved very well indeed in every way. And I know you will do a
great deal to help Lord Sherringborne, to say nothing of Lady Edna. Some day or
other, I hope to see you one of the family, and then you will understand why I
have found it necessary to interfere. By the way, isn't that your friend
Yardley coming in your direction? I wish you would ask him to take me up in the
Gallery. My man seems to have forgotten me. You had better come along. We can
talk matters over there, and besides, it isn't so draughty."</p>
<p>Philip raised no objection. Decidedly it was more comfortable in the
Gallery, and it was possible to discuss matters there while the debate below
was dragging its weary length along. The Speaker himself did not happen to be
in the Chair, and his Deputy was ruling the House with a lenient hand. Members
were taking advantage of it accordingly.</p>
<p>It was one of those debates, too, which lend themselves to discursiveness,
so that matters were dragged in which appeared to have no connection with the
question.</p>
<p>There arose presently on the Opposition side one of those notorious bores
who inflicted himself on all occasions on a long-suffering House. He was
terribly in earnest, as bores always are; he appeared to be imbued with a
desire to draw the attention of the House to a matter quite outside the scope
of the debate. He flourished in his hand a copy of an evening newspaper, from
which he proceeded to read an extract.</p>
<p>"When I am on the subject, Sir," he said. "I should like to ask the
Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs a question which affects the country at
large and also the right honourable gentleman's chief as well. I am quoting
from the 'Evening Echo,' which I have every reason to regard as reliable
authority. Some time ago a certain nobleman married a lady prominently
connected with the stage. Honourable members will now know whom I mean without
my mentioning names. The mere fact that the lady is by birth a foreign subject
makes little or no difference to the question. Now that she has become the wife
of a nobleman, and consequently one day will be the head of a great household,
I claim that she comes under the protection of the British Government. That
this lady should have chosen after her marriage to continue her profession is
no business of mine&mdash;"</p>
<p>Ironical cries and laughter broke out at this point. Philip could see that
de la Croisa was deeply interested.</p>
<p>"Don't you see whom he is talking about?" the Baron said. "The poor man is
alluding to Lady Shorland."</p>
<p>"Oh, members may laugh if they like," the speaker went on. "But it is a most
intolerable thing that an unprotected woman should be treated as if she were a
prisoner, and detained against her will in a foreign country, simply because
she claims what are, apparently, her rights. Personally, I am not responsible
for the statements. It is all set out in detail in the 'Evening Echo' so that
honourable members may read it for themselves. It seems to me almost incredible
that the relatives of this unhappy lady have not seen their way to interfere.
They are merely relatives by marriage, it is true, but seeing that one of them
is Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, this delay to me is all the more
amazing."</p>
<p>"What on earth is he talking about?" Philip asked.</p>
<p>"It's quite plain," the Baron said. "This is just one of those choice bits
of scandal which an ass like the speaker likes to get hold of. I have no doubt
that it is a beautiful story dished up by one of the evening papers with a view
to making a sensation. You can just hear in that an element of truth which
makes the lie all the more outrageous. You see, Lady Shorland is in Tortina;
she did go there to fulfill a professional engagement, and she certainly has
claims out there, which I had hoped to have settled some time since. The plain
fact is that Lady Shorland has gone to St. Lucia on business that is entirely
professional. The idea of her being detained by the authorities is so much
preposterous nonsense. The whole thing is a put up job to cause Sherringborne
annoyance. I should not wonder if the speaker had been inspired by&mdash;"</p>
<p>De la Croisa broke off abruptly.</p>
<p>"I think I see what you mean," Philip said quietly. "You would not be
surprised to find that my father is at the bottom of this. I hope not,
but&mdash;"</p>
<p>De la Croisa's silence was eloquent enough. He rose from his seat presently
and expressed a wish to see a copy of the "Evening Echo."</p>
<p>He waited long enough to hear the loquacious speaker very properly snubbed
by the Under-Secretary in a few words, then they passed through the Lobby and
out into the street. There were a score of newsboys humming around, all of them
crying their wares and calling attention to the strange story of the missing
actress.</p>
<p>There were other papers, too, by this time, who did not hesitate to mention
Lady Shorland by name. De la Croisa purchased a copy of each of the sheets, and
thrust them in his pocket.</p>
<p>"Now, find me some place where I can read these, if you please," he said. "I
don't want to go to the Club if I can help it. I might be recognised."</p>
<p>"That's easily settled," Philip said. "We can do no better than go to my own
rooms. I shall be delighted to act as your host. Let me call a cab."</p>
<p>De la Croisa accepted the offer, together with a subsequent cigarette, and
something exceedingly mild in the way of whisky and soda. Then he proceeded to
read aloud an extract from one of the papers; Philip listened, carefully.</p>
<p>"Further details are to hand concerning the mysterious disappearance of a
well-known actress, connected by marriage with one of our greatest families,
who recently went out to fulfil an engagement at Tortina. According to reliable
authority, the lady in question claims to be the daughter of a distinguished
statesman, who up to a short time ago occupied a position of trust in the
Tortina Government. We understand that this statesman a few months ago rashly
took his life, in consequence of a certain unfortunate speculation which
threatened to ruin his career. Without mentioning names, we may say that the
individual in question was known in London as well as he was known in St.
Lucia. So far as education and training were concerned, he was as much English
as he was Spanish. The heroine of this romance naturally enough claimed all her
father's papers; and proceeded to take possession of them without troubling the
Government officials. But, for diplomatic reasons, the Government sought to
regain possession of the papers, and as the fair owner resolutely declines to
part with them, she is not permitted for the moment to leave the country.
Further details of this strange story, will be awaited with the most lively
interest."</p>
<p>"What do you think of that?" the Baron asked.</p>
<p>"I begin to understand," said Philip slowly, "that those papers are of the
utmost importance&mdash;"</p>
<p>"To Sherringborne," the Baron said. "Precisely."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;"AS THE TWIG IS BENT."</h2>
<p>It seemed to Philip that his eyes were growing clearer now. The problem
began to straighten itself out before him, and he marvelled that he had not
seen it all before. He had before him a vivid vision of the ghastly night at
Borne Abbey when Sherringborne had collapsed and half his secret had been
spoken.</p>
<p>Beyond all question, it had been worse than Philip had anticipated. He had
guessed early on that Sherringborne had done a foolish thing, but till now he
had not been aware that the Foreign Secretary had troden very closely on the
heel of political indiscretion. It was no matter, of course, for a society
scandal, but still, if all the facts came to light, not only would
Sherringborne's political career be at an end, but he would come in for a large
measure of social condemnation as well, in fact, just the thing that a certain
section of the Press revels in.</p>
<p>"I think you follow me," de la Croisa said.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to say I do," Philip replied. "I begin to realise what El
Murid's cowardice means to Sherringborne. But I thought the danger was averted.
I had hoped that our noble friend was free. May I be quite candid, Baron?"</p>
<p>"My dear boy, I want you to be candid. I should not be talking to you like
this if it were otherwise. And I seem to have made the mistake of believing
that you knew everything."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's just the delusion I was under," Philip said, "I didn't know that
Lady Shorland was the daughter of El Murid, and I didn't guess that she has
gone out to St. Lucia on purpose to get possession of her father's papers. Are
you afraid that they will contain compromising details?"</p>
<p>"Well, not quite," de la Croisa replied. "I had better tell you everything,
Philip. Now, Sherringborne behaved very foolishly. He got frightened and lost
his head. There was no reason whatever why he shouldn't invest his money in
those Tortina Concessions."</p>
<p>"But as Foreign Secretary&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ah. I see your point, my boy. Now a man like Sherringborne must invest his
money somewhere. There is no reason why a Foreign Secretary should be debarred
from speculating in any part of the world. And Sherringborne was being hard
pushed. Shorland was a great expense to him. And that's why he jumped at the
chance of making a big fortune in South America. You must remember at that time
there was no trouble between Japan and America, and none likely. But there you
are, there is the trouble, and here is Sherringborne largely interested in the
State of Tortina and Foreign Secretary at the same time."</p>
<p>"I see what you mean," Philip said, "Roughly speaking, it's like a criminal
sitting on his own jury."</p>
<p>"Ah, there you have it," de la Croisa cried. "You have put your finger on
the spot. Mind you, Sherringborne could never have anticipated this, and when
it came home to him, it threw him clean off his mental balance. Perhaps he
ought to have made a clean breast of it to the Premier, but he went on, hoping
for the best, and I am afraid he was largely guided by me in his policy of
silence. I thought, and I think now, that the whole trouble will blow over, in
which case Sherringborne will get all his money back, and your father will be
the poorer of anything up to a million. To be quite candid, Philip, your father
and his group are behaving very badly. I regard all international capitalists
as more or less criminals."</p>
<p>"I am afraid you are right," Philip said. "But what's all this got to do
with Lady Shorland?"</p>
<p>"Good boy," de la Croisa said approvingly. "You bring me back to the point.
Now, the whole business is a conspiracy between Santa Anna, the President of
the Tortina Republic, and William Saltburn. I guessed that at once, and when I
heard of El Murid's suicide I was certain of it. Because, you see, it was El
Murid who dragged his old friend Sherringborne into the business. Then
Sherringborne appealed to me as an old President of Tortina, to save him. I was
going there myself if necessary; indeed, I might even go now, but when I met
Lady Shorland and recognised her as El Murid's daughter, then I began to see a
better and a safer way. No one in Tortina knows who Lady Shorland is, though
she was born in St. Lucia, and I decided to take her into my confidence. She
has gone out on purpose to get possession of her father's papers. If we can
find what we want, then we have Santa Anna in our grip. Because, my dear
Philip, I am convinced of the fact that my old friend El Murid did not commit
suicide at all."</p>
<p>"You think he was murdered?" Philip cried.</p>
<p>"Precisely. And at the instigation of Santa Anna. El Murid knew too much,
and therefore it was necessary to get him out of the way, and if Lady Shorland,
with that wonderful courage of hers, gets the evidence she needs, then we shall
hear no more of this dispute between Japan and America, because we shall be
able to remove Santa Anna and replace his government with an honest one. You
will see what that would mean."</p>
<p>"I am beginning to understand," Philip said, "Then you think that
Sherringborne has acted wisely in not taking the Premier into his
confidence?"</p>
<p>"I do," the Baron replied. "There will be plenty of time for that if the
worst comes to the worst. If Sherringborne adopts that course, then the facts
must be made public, which means the downfall of the Ministry. You can
understand why this should be postponed as long as possible. You go your own
way&mdash;I am confident it is the right one, and if I have to take a little
trip abroad, as I anticipate, I will see you before I go. I may have to leave
at any moment."</p>
<p>But things did not fall out quite in accordance with the baron's programme.
He breakfasted the following morning, and, having despatched a telegram calling
his faithful Francois to London, sat down with the 'Times' before him.</p>
<p>He found the papers particularly interesting, especially with regard to the
proceedings in the House of Commons the previous night. All the morning
journals were full of it; they all gave more or less interesting details,
friendly or otherwise to Sherringborne, according to their political view.</p>
<p>Some of them were not at all pleasant reading, and the Baron smiled grimly
behind his eyeglass. He was still studying those paragraphs with his intimate
inner knowledge when a note from Lady Edna was brought to him. Lady Edna would
be glad if the Baron would come round and see her before lunch. He found her at
her coldest and most dignified, though there was just a suspicion of anger and
mortification in her eyes.</p>
<p>"I sent for you," Lady Edna said. "I thought perhaps you might be able to
give me an explanation. I asked my father, but he practically told me to mind
my own business. Just as if it were not my own business. I suppose you have
seen the papers?"</p>
<p>"I generally do," the Baron said mildly.</p>
<p>"Of course you have. But if you are going to treat me the same as everybody
else, I shall be sorry I sent for you. I am ashamed that we should be mixed up
in a scandal like this."</p>
<p>"But is it a scandal?" the Baron asked humbly.</p>
<p>"It is dreadful to think of the future Countess of Sherringborne spoken of
in this fashion. What does it all mean, Baron? What have we done to be talked
about like this? And why does my father treat me like a child? Surely I am old
enough to understand?"</p>
<p>"You would be in the ordinary way," de la Croisa said coolly. "But, to be
perfectly candid, my dear lady, you are a veritable child in these matters. You
have always lived in an atmosphere of your own. You have always deluded
yourself with the idea that the Cranwallises are under the special protection
of Providence. But, really, their great advantage lies in the fact that their
position and money have placed them outside the ring of ordinary temptation.
But, for my part, I would rather have young Saltburn for a son than Shorland.
Now, wouldn't you?"</p>
<p>Lady Edna flushed angrily.</p>
<p>"I have a very high opinion of Mr. Saltburn," she admitted. "I can never
forget that he has been instrumental in saving us from a great trouble, and he
did it in the nicest possible fashion. But that is not the point, Baron de la
Croisa."</p>
<p>"Ah, now, you are angry with me," the Baron said. "Be reasonable, my child.
Do you expect me to tell you diplomatic secrets that your father declines to
discuss? If you take my advice you will keep out of this business
altogether."</p>
<p>Lady Edna gave a scornful gesture.</p>
<p>"Oh, you may toss your head if you like," the Baron went on. "I don't mind
telling you that I am going to St. Lucia myself to put matters right. And, if
you only knew it, Lady Shorland is behaving exceedingly well&mdash;how well you
will know in time. You have much to be thankful for, my dear child."</p>
<p>Strangely enough, Lady Edna did not seem to resent this air of patronage; on
the contrary, her face relaxed and her lips grew unsteady. She turned to de la
Croisa almost timidly.</p>
<p>"I hope you will forgive me," she murmured. "Ah, what a friend you are. But
does Mr. Saltburn know?"</p>
<p>"Which Mr. Saltburn?" the Baron asked blandly.</p>
<p>"Oh, you know perfectly well which one I meant."</p>
<p>"Very well, then, I do, and I should say he knows all about it. He is a very
fine young fellow, and if I had the happiness to possess a daughter&mdash;like
yourself, for instance&mdash;it would give me the profoundest satisfaction to
know that she was going to marry Philip Saltburn. And I think, my dear child,
that my ancestry is quite as illustrious as yours."</p>
<p>Lady Edna listened almost meekly. She knew precisely what de la Croisa
meant. He was telling her in as many words that if she ever had the opportunity
of becoming Lady Edna Saltburn, she would be both silly and ungracious if she
let the golden chance slip.</p>
<p>And, indeed, de la Croisa was going even further than this. He was telling
her that she should be grateful for the opportunity. Here was a nice thing to
dare to say to the daughter of a hundred earls. It seemed incredible that he
should have had the audacity to advise her to hold out her hand to a man whose
father had started life in the scullery at Borne Abbey.</p>
<p>She ought to have ordered the Baron out of her presence immediately, she
ought to have withered him with scorn, she should have let him know what she
thought of his outrageous temerity.</p>
<p>And yet she was not even faintly annoyed. She was conscious of the fact that
there was a warm red flush on her face, that she was contrasting Philip, much
to his advantage, with the average young man she knew.</p>
<p>And she was glad; for the life of her, she could not help feeling glad that
Philip Saltburn admired and looked up to her. Her lips were smiling as she
turned to de la Croisa.</p>
<p>"You are the most audacious man I know," she said.</p>
<p>"I don't think so," the Baron said critically. "You see, I am old enough,
and disinterested enough, to indulge in the luxury of the truth. Take my
advice, my dear girl. Don't let Philip Saltburn slip through your fingers, and
when he asks you to marry him, as he certainly will some day, don't put him on
probation. He's not the sort of young man to stand it."</p>
<p>"Pray, proceed," Lady Edna murmured. "I am all attention."</p>
<p>"My child," the Baron said, "I have taken the keenest interest in you ever
since you sat on my knee and listened to my fairy tales. I know you, perhaps,
better than you know yourself. And now, good-bye, for I really must be
off."</p>
<p>The Baron took Lady Edna's hand into his; and placed it gallantly to his
lips, then he vanished in his light and airy way, leaving Lady Edna wondering
how much she had gained from the interview.</p>
<p>She tried to tell herself that the Baron had behaved with a great deal of
unnecessary flippancy, and that his allusions to Philip Saltburn were almost
vulgar. But, at the same time, the girl was honest to the core. She knew
perfectly well that what the Baron said had given her a certain amount of
genuine pleasure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Baron was making his way back to his hotel, under the
impression that he had not wasted the last hour or so. He found Francois, stiff
and stern, awaiting him amongst a pile of luggage. It was obvious that Francois
was not pleased.</p>
<p>"What does this mean, Baron?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I feel I ought to apologise," the Baron said meekly. "But the fact is,
I am going for a trip abroad, and I ask for the honour of your company. We are
not going to get into mischief, Francois, we are too old for that."</p>
<p>"Never," Francois said gloomily. "The Baron de la Croisa will never be too
old to get into mischief, and I am a fool, I am weak, I do not put my foot down
and say 'this thing shall not be.' Perhaps it is that I, too, am old."</p>
<p>"But an affair of the heart, Francois," the Baron urged. "The good name of
an amiable and beautiful lady. Shall I have to appeal to my Francois in a case
like this?"</p>
<p>Francois conceded the point gracefully. Therefore, an hour or so later,
master and man were waiting for the Northern Express at Euston. As the Baron
stood on the platform the incoming train disgorged a seething mass of humanity,
and amongst those who bustled by was William Saltburn.</p>
<p>He looked harder and more grim than usual. His collar was none too clean,
and he was obviously in need of a razor. He nodded curtly to de la Croisa, and
would have passed by had not the latter detained him.</p>
<p>"Ah, that is the worst of you business men," the latter said. "You are
always in a hurry. It is not well, my dear Saltburn, to use the sword too much.
Why not take a holiday and come with me for a little trip abroad? By the way,
do you recollect me saying to you one night at Borne Abbey that it would be
well if you kept an eye on Prince Ito? I trust you have done so."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.&mdash;THE TRUST IN PRINCES.</h2>
<p>Saltburn growled something inarticulate and passed on without further
ceremony. From his point on view, the Baron's little joke came at a very
inopportune moment. For it was beginning to dawn upon Saltburn that he was in
the presence of forces that were altogether beyond his strength.</p>
<p>And in his rugged, resolute way, it had never occurred to him that anyone
would dare to challenge him in the heart of his own citadel. He had always been
so successful, he had always struck terror into the hearts of his opponents, he
had swept them out of his way without mercy, and this rule of his applied
equally to individuals and governments.</p>
<p>And everything had appeared so easy, too. A year or two ago he had seen the
value of those Tortina Concessions, and had earmarked them for his own,
intending to take them up when the time was ripe. But he was a man who had many
irons in the fire, and so the Tortina business had to wait. This was at the
time when El Murid was ruling over the destinies of Tortina, and it had been no
part of William Saltburn's policy to make advances so long as El Murid was at
the head of affairs. But this was only a matter of months. The rascally Santa
Anna was reaching for the reins of power, and Saltburn's almost bottomless
purse was behind him. In other words, Saltburn, through his accredited agents,
was engaged in the business of a South American revolution. In this he could
see almost limitless opportunities for the making of money, provided, of
course, that the man behind the gun was as unscrupulous as himself. And he had
found the man behind the gun in Santa Anna. Once the revolution was an
accomplished fact, Santa Anna would be president, and the enlightened and
patriotic El Murid would be down and out for ever. It was only a question of
time, and in time it came.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately for Saltburn, before the pear was ripe El Murid had
interested certain persons in Europe in the Tortina Concessions, so that when
he was driven into captivity, and was compelled to fly into the interior of the
country to save his life, the mischief was done.</p>
<p>Saltburn was naturally furious. The revolution had cost him a fortune, and
he had no confidence whatever in the puppet that his gold had placed at the
head of the Government. Therefore it became necessary to look round him and
find some means of recovering his losses. It did not take Saltburn long to
discover whose money it was that lay behind those concessions. The mere fact
that it was Sherringborne's money only increased Saltburn's feeling of
bitterness, and, if he could only manipulate the situation to his own
advantage, then not only would he recover all he had invested, but he could
ruin the man he most hated in the world at the same time.</p>
<p>It was a congenial task, and Saltburn set about it with a certain savage
pleasure. He had his agents all over the world; he had a servile section of the
Press in three capitals in his pay. And with this Press behind him he set out
to make trouble between Japan and America, and up to the present moment he had
succeeded almost beyond his wildest expectations. If he could keep up the
present pressure and bring about a conflict between the two great Powers, then
those Tortilla Concessions would be worthless, and Sherringborne and his
friends would lose all their money.</p>
<p>And up to a certain point everything had gone well. The papers were still
full of rumours of strife and prophesies concerning the approaching crisis, and
already the price of Tortina Concessions had fallen to zero.</p>
<p>And yet, in the face of all this, someone was buying steadily. Already
Saltburn had contracted to sell more than he possessed, and if the pressure was
kept up then he was likely to find himself in a tight corner. And the man who
was buying all these shares was William Saltburn's own son. Why? Saltburn
wondered. And what did Philip know about business? Still, he was on the terms
of close friendship with Sherringborne, and, what was more to the point, was
intimately connected with de la Croisa.</p>
<p>And if there was one man in the world that William Saltburn was afraid of it
was the Baron. They had crossed swords more than once in the past, and almost
invariably de la Croisa had come out with all the honours of war.</p>
<p>And here was Sherringborne still in the Cabinet, apparently a trusted figure
in politics, carrying on with renewed strength and energy, as if he had not a
single anxiety in the world. And yet, if those Tortina Concessions failed to
materialise, Sherringborne would be stripped of all he possessed, and the man
who had brought all this ruin about would be the humble individual who, half a
century before, had been in the scullery at Borne Abbey.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful vengeance, and one that Saltburn had hugged to his soul
for years. He had planned it all out in his mind, but he had not really seen
what it meant, until he had found himself under the roof of Borne Abbey, again
seated at the same table with Lady Edna opposite him, and his own son by her
side.</p>
<p>From Saltburn's point of view there was only one way of bringing about what
he desired, and that was to humble Sherringborne in the dust and compel Lady
Edna, almost with tears in her eyes, gratefully to accept Philip as her
husband.</p>
<p>And here was Philip opposing such a policy tooth and nail. Here was Philip
conspiring against his own father, to save the honour of the house of
Cranwallis, and after-wards, presumably, to go down on his knees to Lady Edna
and sue "in forma pauperis," so to speak, for the privilege of going through
life with her.</p>
<p>William Saltburn could not understand it at all. He did not know that in
these matters he was nothing more than a child, he did not know what pride of
race meant, and that, in his well-meant efforts to promote Philip's happiness
he was going the way to utterly and entirely destroy it.</p>
<p>But that was not what was worrying Saltburn as he strode along the platform
in search of a taxi. His trouble was that, for once in his life, he could not
see his way clearly. Something was going on behind the scenes that he could not
get at, something had happened to save Sherringborne from humiliation and
disgrace, because here he was, carrying on much the same as usual, when he
ought to have been driven out of the Cabinet. And here was Prince Ito, who
spoke authoritatively on the behalf of Japan, holding secret meetings with de
la Croisa and Sherringborne, meetings at which Saltburn knew that his son,
Philip, had been present. And in the face of all this Philip was buying every
share in Tortina Concessions that he could lay his hands upon.</p>
<p>And Philip was no fool. Saltburn knew that his son had inherited a good deal
of his shrewdness, and that he was not likely to sacrifice his own fortune in a
futile attempt to preserve the honour and glory of the Cranwallis family. And
again, what had de la Croisa meant when he hinted so mysteriously at Prince
Ito? What was there in the wind of which Saltburn knew nothing? The mere fact
that he did know nothing filled him with cold fury. It was perfectly useless,
he knew, for him to attempt to learn anything from Prince Ito. He had tried
that on before in his bluffing way, and he had had a lesson which did not fail
to penetrate even his thick skin. Perhaps Van Hasvell might be able to throw
some light upon it.</p>
<p>Yes, that was the idea. With this upper most in his mind Saltburn went to
his hotel, where he bathed and shaved and immediately set out in search of the
man who had been his business partner in the days before Van Hasvell had turned
respectable and had gone into the political arena.</p>
<p>Van Hasvell happened to be at home, and, moreover, quite ready to meet Mr.
Saltburn. He came into the library with a cigarette in his mouth, and a jest on
his lips, and altogether with the air of a man who is quite sure of his
ground.</p>
<p>"I want to have a bit of a talk with you," Saltburn said truculently. "Got
half an hour to spare?"</p>
<p>"My dear Saltburn, I've got all the afternoon to spare. If you desire it,"
Van Hasvell drawled. "But please don't talk business to me. When I made my pile
in Wall-street&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Thanks to me," Saltburn growled.</p>
<p>"Precisely. I am glad you reminded me of the fact. But I think, my dear
fellow, that the benefit was mutual. However, all that is beside the point.
When I left Wall-street I cut business altogether. I invested all I had in
gilt-edged securities, and, on the interest, I am living a simple life. I
always have a taste for politics, and when my party came into office, and they
made me Chief Secretary of our Embassy in London, I was most profoundly
grateful. But don't talk business."</p>
<p>"Oh, that be hanged for a tale," Saltburn cried, in that big coarse voice of
his. "You've got to listen, yes, and you've got to help, too, if I say the
word."</p>
<p>Van Hasvell smiled almost sweetly.</p>
<p>"Well, you're my guest, I suppose," he said. "Go on. I don't think, my dear
friend, that you are likely to get much out of me. But you can try."</p>
<p>"I am going to," Saltburn said doggedly. "Now, between one man and another,
what are your people going to do over this Tortina business?"</p>
<p>"Didn't I remind you once before that I am not the American Ambassador? My
dear fellow, I am as ignorant as you are. It's not the business of the
Secretary to know anything. He has to do precisely as he is told, without
asking any questions. And as to Tortina, time alone will show. You seem to
forget that there is now such a thing as a League of Nations."</p>
<p>"League of Nations, be hanged," Saltburn cried. "How long is that likely to
last? And how long has the League of Nations abolished human nature? Now, look
here, Van Hasvell, I'm in a bit of a hole."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's better," Van Hasvell murmured softly. "You've got yourself into
a mess over that business and you can't see your way out. It's the sort of
thing that always happens when a man allows his private feelings to interfere
in business."</p>
<p>Saltburn was taken aback. He knew perfectly well what Van Hasvell was
driving at, but he was both disturbed and astonished to find that his scheme
for the ruin of Sherringborne was perfectly well known to this old business
colleague of his.</p>
<p>"Well, never mind about that," he growled. "What I want to know, what I must
know, is, whether there is going to be an open rupture between America and
Japan. No League of Nations will ever prevent it, when it comes to a matter of
international interest. And if you and Japan quarrel, I don't see Europe coming
into the ring with big armies to stop the fun. Why, if they did, Japan and
America would immediately join hands and tell the Western Powers to go hang.
The patriotic drum would be beaten, and we should have the big European war all
over again. But never mind about that. Is there going to be live trouble?"</p>
<p>"If I could tell you I wouldn't," Van Hasvell said coolly. "It would be a
direct breach of faith. But one thing I can advise you to do, and that is to
drop the Tortina business altogether and get out with as little loss as
possible. You've burnt your fingers over that transaction, and if you're a wise
man, you'll climb out before the explosion comes, and&mdash;well, I think I've
told you quite enough. And don't you come here again trying to bully me,
because I won't have it. And that's all there is to it."</p>
<p>Saltburn set his lips doggedly. He was not going to be beaten, he was not
going to turn back now. He would win through yet, and show these people what it
meant to come in the way of William Saltburn. Without a word he turned his back
upon Van Hasvell and went off moodily down the street.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.&mdash;THE MAN WHO KNEW.</h2>
<p>Saltburn stood there was a strange feeling that he was cut off from the rest
of the world and was alone in it, the only one of his tribe. And in a certain
sense it was true enough. He had always boasted that he had never made a
friend, and, indeed, he had never had the opportunity.</p>
<p>But now he felt as it were in a kind of dream and as if he needed
assistance. For the first time in his life he was conscious of a feeling which
he had never experienced before. It wasn't exactly fear nor illness, and yet it
was unpleasant, and Saltburn would have been glad to be without it.</p>
<p>Then it flashed upon him what it was. He had heard people speak of this
thing, and hitherto he had put it down contemptuously enough to weak-mindedness
or mere fancy.</p>
<p>He was nervous, that was what was the matter with him. Nervous! He, William
Saltburn, who always boasted that he feared nothing, either in this world or
the next! At any rate, there it was. It was a most unpleasant feeling, and one
which set Saltburn's heart beating faster. His lips were dry and there was a
certain throbbing sensation in his throat.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was overworked, Saltburn told himself. Hitherto he had always
laughed at an idea like that. It was his boast that he could toil twenty hours
a day, and he had proclaimed aggressively that four hours' sleep a night were
enough for anybody. Anybody who wanted more was not worth troubling about.</p>
<p>Still, here it was. He was a little dizzy, a little unsteady, and he did not
like the way his heart was fluttering at all. He had the peculiar fear which
always comes to the physically strong man when, for the first time in his life,
he becomes conscious of his own bodily identity.</p>
<p>He tried to laugh his fears aside; he tried to force his thoughts into
another channel. He concentrated his attention upon his money, but there was
precious little consolation in that direction just now. He was going to lose
his money, at any rate, the greater part of it.</p>
<p>People would laugh at him. In the City they would say that William Saltburn
was a back number. They would sneer at him, and pity him, and declare that he
was old-fashioned and out of date. He knew this because he had done the same
about other people.</p>
<p>Why should this man Sherringborne escape all the consequences of his folly?
What had he done that he should find himself in his present strong position?
Sherringborne had no brains. He was just a pompous, self-satisfied individual,
who found himself in his present position because he happened to be born to a
great historic title, and into the possession of large estates. He could never
have attained Cabinet rank at all but for the accident of fortune.</p>
<p>He made a fine figure-head, of course. He was very imposing and very
courtly, and he had a certain heavy eloquence which read well in the papers.
And yet, there he was, absolutely master of the situation. There was no credit
due to him. If there had been no such place as Borne Abbey, Sherringborne would
have left the Ministry in disgrace long ago.</p>
<p>The point wanted no arguing. And yet, here Sherringborne was, wrapped in the
purple, and with scores of people cleverer than himself waiting upon his
lightest word.</p>
<p>Saltburn was filled with a certain blind, unreasoning anger as he passed
Sherringborne's great house, blazing from top to bottom with lights. He saw the
stream of people moving up and down the steps, he could see the gorgeous array
of liveried servants in the hall. There were men in demure black, obviously
secretaries, crossing the lighted space, swiftly bearing bundles of papers in
their hands.</p>
<p>A Foreign Office messenger came up presently with a despatch-box. Near the
house on either side a policeman stood, so that it seemed to Saltburn that here
was a man whose position was semi-regal. The whole thing was almost
laughable.</p>
<p>And yet Saltburn didn't laugh. He was beginning to understand things. He was
beginning to ask himself questions. Was it possible, after all, that
Sherringborne was a great and more gifted man than most people believed him to
be? Hitherto Saltburn had held a poor enough opinion of the politician.</p>
<p>He regarded him, and rightly, in most cases, as a frothy, self-opinionated
person whose only capital was his self-conceit and his sublime audacity. There
were exceptions, of course, and Saltburn had met them. But he had never looked
on Sherringborne as one of these.</p>
<p>At any rate, he was going to see for himself. Once he moved his foot in the
direction of the house all his nervousness and hesitation left him. He was not
in the least afraid of Sherringborne. He held the latter in the hollow of his
hand, and he would let him know it soon. He pushed his way into the hall, and
handed his card to one of the servants.</p>
<p>"Take that to your master," he said abruptly, "and tell him that I want to
see him at once."</p>
<p>The name on the card was not without its effect. But there was no indecent
haste on the part of the liveried servant. He passed the pasteboard on to the
hall porter, who, in turn, handed it on to somebody else, and at the end of ten
minutes an assistant secretary appeared, full of polite regrets, and an
intimation that his lordship was too busy to see anybody.</p>
<p>"If you will make an appointment, sir," the secretary said.</p>
<p>Saltburn fumed inwardly. But he saw that it was not of the slightest use to
bluster. The secretary was perfectly polite, but he met Saltburn's eyes
squarely enough. There was nothing to gain by display of violence. And,
besides, Saltburn would see that he made himself felt presently.</p>
<p>"I am a busy man myself," he said. "And I know how valuable time is, but
really, I must ask Lord Sherringborne to be good enough to see me for a minute
or two."</p>
<p>The secretary bowed and vanished. He came back presently with the request
that Saltburn would follow him. He found himself presently in a library lined
with books, and at a large table Sherringborne was seated.</p>
<p>He smiled blandly enough at his visitor, but he made no attempt to rise,
neither did he hold out his hand. He appeared to be perfectly at his ease; he
had that large bland manner which generally goes with a man who feels himself
in the presence of an inferior.</p>
<p>"You wanted to see me?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Well, yes," Saltburn said. "I want you to give me a little information if
you will. Now as to this Japanese business&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," Sherringborne said coldly. "I am afraid I don't quite
follow you."</p>
<p>Saltburn hesitated for a moment. Should he meet this man with his own
weapons, or should he take him by force, so to speak? Still, it did not much
matter either way. Saltburn was too sure of his ground to have any doubts as to
the result.</p>
<p>"I thought I spoke plainly," he said. "I am sweating about this trouble in
Tortina. I have just bought a paper, which says that Japan has threatened
hostilities, and that there has been a big naval demonstration off St. Lucia.
Of course, the suggestion that shots have been exchanged is all nonsense."</p>
<p>"So I should imagine," Sherringborne said blandly.</p>
<p>It was quite evident that Saltburn was going to get no assistance here.
Sherringborne was absolutely patronising. His manner was scrupulously correct,
and exquisitely polite, but there was no mistaking the fact that Sherringborne
was speaking to a man whom he regarded as his inferior, and he was taking no
special pains to cloak his demeanour.</p>
<p>He lay back smilingly in his chair now, with the tips of his long white
fingers pressed together. He gave Saltburn the impression of the man who is
slightly bored, but who is far too much of a gentleman to say so.</p>
<p>"People who publish papers always magnify, you know, Mr. Saltburn," he said.
"It is their business to exaggerate these things. As a responsible Minister of
the Crown, nobody deplores these sensational reports more than myself. It is a
theory of mine that sooner or later one of these irresponsible, cheap papers
will embroil us into another Continental war. But, fortunately for us, Mr.
Saltburn, this is a free country. We are not bound to believe what the papers
say, you know."</p>
<p>All this with the most perfect sang-froid, and polished good-humour.
Saltburn was forced to smile, though he was inwardly raging. He began to wonder
if he had made a mistake. Was it possible, after all, that Sherringborne was
really the strong and brilliant man which the Government Press made him out to
be?</p>
<p>And yet Saltburn had seen him in very different circumstances to these. And
he might be a foeman worthy of anyone's steel. It might be that he had all the
advantages. At any rate, Saltburn told himself he was not going to stand this
sort of thing.</p>
<p>"That's all very well," he said bluntly. "I didn't come here to talk about
the morality of the cheap Press. I want to know if this thing's true."</p>
<p>Sherringborne smiled irritatingly.</p>
<p>"My dear Mr. Saltburn, how can I tell?" he asked. "Are you asking me as a
Minister or a private individual?"</p>
<p>"I don't care a rap which it is, so long as I get the information," Saltburn
said.</p>
<p>"Very well, then," Sherringborne said with the same smiling good humour. "I
will try and answer in both capacities. As a private individual, I know just as
much or as little as you do. In fact, I know less, because I haven't seen the
papers, and you have. As a Minister of the Crown, I know nothing. You see, this
is my private residence, and though circumstances compel me to transact all
sorts of business here at all sorts of hours, I only work here for my own
convenience."</p>
<p>"Meaning that I am an intruder?" Saltburn asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I didn't mean it quite that way. I'm sorry I gave you that impression.
When the House meets to-night, we shall have nothing fresh to disclose, and, up
to the present moment I have not a single official line from the seat of the
trouble."</p>
<p>Saltburn gritted his teeth together. He would have given much to take
Sherringborne by the shoulders and shake his secret out of him.</p>
<p>That Sherringborne knew all about it, Saltburn never doubted for a moment.
He had not said that he knew nothing, he had only insisted upon the fact that
he had no official information. He was treating Saltburn now as he would have
treated a question from the Opposition in the House of Lords.</p>
<p>"Oh, that isn't good enough for me," Saltburn said. "Come, my dear sir, you
know all about it. Do you mean to tell me that Prince Ito, who was here this
morning, didn't know? Do you mean to tell me that the Government hasn't been
expecting this for a week or more? I'm not quite a fool as far as politics go.
Why, Japan would not have dared to have gone in for this business without, at
any rate, the moral support of England. And you might as well own up,
Sherringborne. You might just as well tell me that Ito came over just now to
give you the latest information."</p>
<p>Sherringborne smiled quite blandly. Probably he was bitterly annoyed, but,
at any rate, he did not show it.</p>
<p>"My friend, Prince Ito, has been here today," he said. "He came to discuss a
little matter of business, certainly, but you may be surprised, to hear that
Tortina was not so much as mentioned. I shall have to get you to take my word
for that, Mr. Saltburn. I am very sorry, but there it is."</p>
<p>It was beginning to come home to Saltburn now that he had a man to deal
with. It was impossible, too, to carry the matter any further in this direction
without telling Sherringborne pretty plainly that he was deliberately telling a
lie. And there was nothing to gain by a course like that.</p>
<p>It would probably result in Saltburn being politely kicked out of the house
with an intimation not to return again. Still, there were other methods, and
Saltburn would not hesitate to adopt them if necessary.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am not saying you are wrong," he said ungraciously. "But I am here
asking you more or less a favour. If this thing is true, it is a serious
business for me, and it will entail a loss of money. On the other hand, if I
know exactly how matters stand, then I shall be able to act promptly in the
matter. I am not asking you to betray official secrets."</p>
<p>Once more Sherringborne smiled blandly.</p>
<p>"Of course not, Mr. Saltburn," he said. "You are too thoroughly a man of the
world for that. I am sure you would never suggest such a thing. And that is why
I am sorry that I can't help you. As I said just now, I have no official
information, and therefore, speaking as a Minister, I am as much in the dark as
you are. And don't let me detain you. I know how busy you are. And, if at any
time I can be of any service to you, don't hesitate to let me know."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.&mdash;THE MAN WHO DIDN'T.</h2>
<p>There was no mistaking the meaning of Sherringborne's words. He rose from
his chair and held out his hand with the air of a man who is regretfully
parting with a pleasant acquaintance.</p>
<p>But Saltburn was not in a responsive mood. He stood doggedly there, his legs
planted wide apart, a figure of sullen resolution. He had made up his mind at
last. He knew now that he had been mistaken in Sherringborne's character. He
knew now that he had to deal with one quite as clever, and a great deal more
subtle than himself. But it was not the slightest use trying to fight
Sherringborne with a rapier! This was when the broadsword called for free play.
And as the challenge was evidently on Sherringborne's side, then it was with
Saltburn to choose the lethal tool which suited his style of fight.</p>
<p>"Here, stop a moment," he said, "it is just as well that you and I should
understand each other. I came here asking for information, more or less as a
favour, and if you choose to withhold it, it isn't for me to grumble. And now,
putting all diplomacy aside, and speaking as one man to another, I ask you if
you know if this news is true or not."</p>
<p>Sherringborne smiled loftily.</p>
<p>"I always found," he said, "that an excellent way of obtaining information
is by asking questions. You have asked me one, and it is only fair that I
should return with another. What right have you to come to me, above all people
in the world, and want to know these things? Don't you think it would be far
better to wait till to-morrow and put the question to the Under-Secretary from
your place in the House of Commons?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all very well in its way," Saltburn said. "I'll answer your
question when you've answered mine."</p>
<p>"I can tell you nothing," Sherringborne said.</p>
<p>"Oh, I think you can. Besides, if we begin this game of asking questions,
there are one or two I could put in the House of Commons which you might not
care about. For instance, I could ask you if it is a fact that up to a little
time ago the Secretary for Foreign Affairs was a comparatively large holder in
Tortina Concessions. I could ask if he bought them at a low price on the
expectation of their increasing in value with a new financial scheme which was
about to be enforced."</p>
<p>"Is that within your province?" Sherringborne asked.</p>
<p>"In fact, there are scores of questions on the point which I could ask, and
I am sure that they would be listened to with the greatest attention. I think I
can make a good rousing speech on the matter."</p>
<p>"I am sure you could," Sherringborne murmured.</p>
<p>"And, as you are aware, my lord, the English people have a rooted objection
to responsible Ministers who dabble in finance. I might even go further, and
suggest that England has been induced to back Japan in this matter, and force
the hands of America so as to save the Foreign Secretary from a financial
scandal, such as the country has not known since the days of Walpole. I have no
doubt that I could find a few useful facts to back my assertions. It would be a
very interesting evening."</p>
<p>"I am quite sure it would," Sherringborne said amiably. "But don't you think
that those American methods in politics are a mistake? And it would give a very
great deal of trouble, too, and at a very busy time. Really, I am sorry, Mr.
Saltburn, that I cannot be of assistance to you."</p>
<p>Saltburn had no reply for the moment. It seemed impossible to shake this man
from his balance, or move him to anger. If Saltburn had seen any displeasure on
his part, or any sign of emotion, he might have been encouraged to proceed. But
even his threats were received in the blandest possible manner, and now
Sherringborne was glancing at the clock with the air of a man whose patience is
getting exhausted.</p>
<p>"Then you decline to tell me?" Saltburn asked.</p>
<p>"I don't even go as far as that," Sherringborne said. "I really have nothing
to tell you. I have only to say that I have no official information. And even
if I had, look what a precedent this would be. Why, if I allowed this to
escape, I should have people of all kinds and descriptions dropping in at all
sorts of times, thirsting for information, and on all sorts of topics. Now,
don't be foolish, Mr. Saltburn. Possess your soul in patience and get your
information through the legitimate channels. Ask the Undersecretary to-morrow
night. And if you want to involve me in a scandal, why, you are at perfect
liberty to do so. Now let us suppose that I am seeking information. You are
greatly interested in some sort of stock, and you are keeping the information
to yourself, seeing that it is worth millions to you. Now what would you think
of me if I came along in this innocent sort of way and asked you to show me
your methods? Supposing, again, that you have a horse which you are keeping to
win a certain race. What would you say to me if I dropped you a line asking you
which race it was that you were particularly keen on winning. But, then,
perhaps you are not keen on racing?"</p>
<p>"I used to be at one time," the discomfited Saltburn said. "But that was
years ago, when I was a boy. Your father was a better sportsman than you
are."</p>
<p>"I suppose he was," Sherringborne said amiably. "I know his stud was
terribly expensive, and, indirectly, I am still paying for it. But I had
forgotten for the moment that you knew my father. I had no idea until
comparatively recently that you were so well acquainted with Borne Abbey. In
those days, people were unnecessarily harsh in small matters. But still, your
misfortune turned out a great blessing after all, didn't it?"</p>
<p>Saltburn stared at the speaker. He was wondering how it was that
Sherringborne had so absolutely guessed what was passing in his mind. He had
been leading up to this, he was going to use it as a lever for extracting the
information he needed, and now Sherringborne was cutting the ground from under
his feet.</p>
<p>"I did no wrong," he said stubbornly. "And after all it was only the matter
of a rabbit. And it was more of a boy's escapade than anything else."</p>
<p>"My dear sir, I am perfectly well aware of it," Sherringborne said. "I have
been looking up the case. It was, to say the least of it, a monstrous
miscarriage of justice. And you are quite right, all the same, to keep this
trouble in the background. You don't want people to say, of course, that Mr.
Saltburn, the great millionaire, is a returned convict. Really, as a matter of
fact, any man who has been convicted of an act of felony, is debarred from a
seat in the British House of Commons. It seems a monstrous thing that poaching
rabbits should be called a felony but the law has never been repealed, and
there it is. It really makes one's blood boil to think that game-preserving
magistrates of the old days should have had such powers in their hands. I
trust, Mr. Saltburn, that you will understand that outside my family this
matter will never be mentioned."</p>
<p>Saltburn glared speechlessly.</p>
<p>"Still, just imagine if you carried out the playful suggestion you made just
now as to myself and certain imaginary bonds, how annoyed a section of our
followers in the House would be. They would not hesitate to make use of the
little personal matter of yours which we are now discussing, which, of course,
would be very awkward for you. As for myself, I think nothing of it. It won't
prevent me from being friends in the future, and it won't prevent me being
always ready to welcome that exceedingly nice boy of yours at Borne Abbey.
Really it is quite a romance in its way, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Saltburn choked down a forcible reply. He could never recollect feeling
quite so small in his life before. There had been occasions, of course, when he
had had to acknowledge defeat, but never anything quite so complete and
absolute as this.</p>
<p>And the knowledge that he had been utterly wrong in his estimate of
Sherringborne's character was an added drop of gall in the cup of humiliation.
If he could only have aroused Sherringborne's anger something would have been
gained. But the gay smile was on the Foreign Secretary's lips, and the amused
twinkle still in his eye.</p>
<p>And yet, in his way, he had been quite as plain-spoken as Saltburn himself.
He had told the latter in the plainest possible way that he meant to stand no
nonsense, and that he had not the least intention of taking it lying down. And,
as far as Saltburn could see, it would be no easy matter to bring this
accusation home to Sherringborne. He had been foiled in this matter, and the
knowledge that he had been baffled by his own son was merely an added cause of
dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>And, on the other hand, Sherringborne had a very strong card indeed. Without
showing his hand at all, he could make things very awkward for William
Saltburn. And with all his bluntness and independence, and with all his
knowledge that he had been punished out of proportion with his crime, Saltburn
was not proud of the fact that he was a returned convict. It was the one thing
that he had kept in the background as likely to injure him in his career.</p>
<p>And this was not the worst of it either. With a smile on his face, and a
joke on his lips, Sherringborne had dealt him a deadly blow. He had told him
quite plainly that he had no business whatever to be in the House of Commons,
and that if certain facts came to light, Saltburn's opponents would make the
latter vacate his seat in circumstances that savoured of disgrace.</p>
<p>And Saltburn was bound to admit to himself that Sherringborne had done this
very nicely indeed. He could not but contrast the Foreign Secretary's methods
with his own, as they would have applied had the situation been reversed.</p>
<p>Saltburn would have done it brutally and candidly, he would have brained his
opponent with a sledge-hammer. On the other hand, Sherringborne had done the
thing neatly and cleanly, with a dexterous thrust of his polished blade which
left no ugly outward wound behind it.</p>
<p>It had been an exceedingly neat and nice bit of surgery, and Saltburn was
bound to admit it. But the real sting lay in the fact that he had been cruelly
mauled by an opponent who at all points of the game had displayed a science far
more profound than his own. It was of no use being jealous of Lord
Sherringborne, it was no use to grudge him his gifts, and wonder why the god of
chance should throw the big battalions on his side.</p>
<p>To do him justice, Saltburn was a man who always knew when he was beaten. He
moved to the door now with as good a grace as possible, though he affected not
to see the hand which Sherringborne held out to him.</p>
<p>"I have made a mistake," he said. "I quite see now that I ought not to have
come here at all. But the news I had to-night rather upset me. It threw me off
my balance for a few minutes. And there is a good deal in what you say."</p>
<p>"Oh, please don't apologise," Sherringborne said. "If there is any way in
which I can serve you&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Saltburn was no longer there. He went out, closing the door behind him
with a little more noise than was absolutely necessary. Sherringborne lay back
in his chair smiling softly to himself. On the whole, he had enjoyed the
interview. He had expected something of the kind, and, so far as he could see,
he had no cause to be dissatisfied.</p>
<p>"What a man," he mused. "And what crude methods! And to think that this
should be the father of Philip Saltburn. If it were otherwise, I might have
been disposed&mdash;but that's impossible."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.&mdash;IN STILL WATERS.</h2>
<p>The weeks had drifted slowly along, the Houses of Parliament were up for
their Easter vacation, and Sherringborne and Lady Edna were back at Borne
Abbey. Nothing bad happened in the meantime, despite the wild shrieking of the
newspapers, and the sensational Press for once was frankly puzzled.</p>
<p>And, meanwhile, down there at Borne Abbey, the daffodils were blooming in
the woods and already the first May buds were breaking in the hedges. Philip
Saltburn was down there too, glad to turn his back upon the turmoil of town and
get away to a little peace and quietness. He had firmly established himself in
'The Chantrey' by this time, and this perfect spring night was entertaining his
neighbours from Borne Abbey to dinner. He had taken over the Old Dower House,
just as it stood, even to the priceless old furniture, and only certain family
portraits had been moved. There had been certain alterations, of course, for
instance, a gloomy old dining-hall at the back had been transformed into a
tropical conservatory. The principal living rooms opened, one into the other,
so that when the old oak doors were thrown back, there was a perfect vista of
art and beauty, terminating in a glorious burst of bloom. Even Lady Edna, with
all her hatred of change, exclaimed with delight, when she saw this.</p>
<p>She was graciously pleased, too, with the really clever way Philip had
introduced the electric light, in fact, her most fastidious taste could find
nothing to cavil at anywhere.</p>
<p>They were seated in the hall after dinner over coffee and cigarettes, and
admiring the pictures with which Philip had replaced the old family portrait's,
sitting there in the faint glory of a May night, and talking as if they had
been friends for years. Shorland was there too, a little quiet and subdued, and
unmistakably changed for the better. He had been down at Borne Abbey most of
the winter, at first owing to the fact that his allowance had been woefully
exceeded and now more or less reconciled to a country life. He was an improved
Shorland, a good deal steadier, and only inclined at times to grumble at what
he called his hard lot, and kick over the traces. Philip had noticed this in
his quiet way at dinner time, and he had noticed too, that Shorland allowed the
champagne to go by oftener than he troubled to stop the servant behind him.</p>
<p>For Shorland was missing his wife. He was missing her more than he thought
he would. In the short time they had been together he had learnt to depend upon
her, and now that fatuous young man began to wonder if he was ever going to see
her again. He had made that remark more than once during dinner, and Philip had
smiled softly to himself, for he could have told Shorland a good deal on that
head had he liked. Also, he could have told Sherringborne exactly what de la
Croisa was doing, and where the latter was to be found. So far, no word had
come from either de la Croisa or Lady Shorland, and, from Philip's point of
view, this was all to the good.</p>
<p>For he knew perfectly well that everything was going smoothly. For some time
now he had not seen his father, though he knew perfectly well what William
Saltburn was doing.</p>
<p>And he knew, beyond doubt, before long, that William Saltburn, the great
financier and ruler of men, would be down there almost on his knees, asking his
son to get him out of the mess that threatened to overpower him. It had all
come when the time was ripe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they sat there, in the hall of "The Chantrey," talking over many
things, whilst Lady Edna lay back in her chair, pleased and gracious, and most
intensely glad to notice that Philip had made no change in this house, which
had been the cradle of the clan of Cranwallis. No doubt, some of these days,
Philip Saltburn would bring a wife here, and Lady Edna caught herself
speculating as to what sort of a wife she would be, and if she could make
friends with her. She hoped that she might, for her heart was full of gratitude
towards the man who had done so much to preserve the honour and glory of the
house of Cranwallis, and she told herself that she would have done almost
anything for him.</p>
<p>But that did not prevent her from being just a little jealous of this
nebulous woman, who, some time or another, would have the proud privilege of
calling herself mistress of "The Chantrey."</p>
<p>"You have done wonders here," she said to Philip. "The great fault of the
old house was its gloom. You seem to have banished all that without altering a
single feature of the place. You must be a magician, Mr. Saltburn."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know," Philip smiled. "It's been a labour of love. I would
rather have 'The Chantrey' than any house in the kingdom. It was the Dower
House, wasn't it? Built, I understand, before Borne Abbey was even
planned."</p>
<p>"That's true enough," Shorland interposed. "Jolly old place, I call it. Do
you know, I've come to the conclusion that I could have been quite happy here
without Ninon. When you've made a bit of a fool of yourself like I have, and
you come to realise what a rotten business knocking about town is&mdash;"</p>
<p>Shorland lapsed into silence, a little afraid of his own eloquence, and
rather at a loss to proceed.</p>
<p>"I think I know what Shorland means," Lady Edna said. "You will perhaps be
surprised to hear me say that I prefer 'The Chantry' to Borne Abbey. It was
built by the first Cranwallis, over six hundred years ago. Those are the sort
of things you can't forget. And I used to spend a lot of time here when my
grandmother was alive. Nobody knew more about the family than she did. And a
lot of history has been made here, too. Stories of Queen Elizabeth and Charles
II are told about many of the rooms in the house, and I am quite sure, Mr.
Saltburn, that you are worthy of it all."</p>
<p>It was a great deal for Lady Edna to say, and Philip glowed with pride and
satisfaction. Looking into that calm beautiful face now he could see an
expression there that he had never noticed before. It was a face, no longer
proud and haughty, but the face of a very woman happy and grateful, and
addressing one whom she regarded absolutely in the light of an equal. It was an
invitation to a closer confidence, and all the manhood in Philip's soul rose to
it spontaneously.</p>
<p>Shorland strolled off along the corridor rooms, through the conservatory
into the garden beyond, and crossed the terrace with a spaniel of Philip's that
had taken a great fancy to him. For children and dogs liked Shorland, which was
surely an asset in that erratic youth's favour. Sherringborne lay back with a
cigar between his lips, contemplating the painted ceiling thoughtfully.</p>
<p>He was his old self again almost, though there were moments now and then
when his face would look grey and old, and his speech dragged. He never quite
got over his attack of the summer before, and though he had met William
Saltburn resolutely enough when the time came to cross blades with him, he had
only risen to the occasion by sheer force of will and the knowledge that he was
a Cranwallis, and the man opposing him a humble hind, born on his own estate.
On that occasion he had been carefully coached by de la Croisa, and he had done
that master of fence infinite credit. But for all his ease and aplomb, it had
been a very near thing had William Saltburn only known it.</p>
<p>He was not out of the wood yet. He had hung on all through these troublesome
months, knowing that his political reputation rested on a single hair, but, so
far, he had come through. He had told the Premier nothing, and, in this policy
of silence, he had been advised by de la Croisa. There would be plenty of time,
the Baron urged, to make full confession to the head of the Government if
things came to an extreme between Japan and America, in which case the English
Foreign Office would probably be asked to arbitrate, and then Sherringborne, as
head of the department in question, would be bound, in common honour, to tell
the Premier that he was financially interested in Tortina, and ask to be
relieved of his seals of office.</p>
<p>And this might happen at any moment, as Philip well knew, so that he had a
fair idea of what Sherringborne was thinking about as he lay back in his chair
with a half-smoked cigar between his lips. It was a critical moment, and
anything might happen in the next few days.</p>
<p>Not that there was any sign of it in the peaceful atmosphere of 'The
Chantrey.' Trouble and strife seemed very far away in that beautiful old hall,
with its panelled walls, and the fading light streaming through the painted
windows. It was absurd to think of human strife and chicanery in an atmosphere
like that, presided over by a beautiful woman in a simple black dress, which
was utterly devoid of a single piece of jewellery. And with Sherringborne in a
world of his own, Philip and Lady Edna sat there, talking in the most friendly
fashion, and exchanging confidences as if they had known each other all their
lives. It was impossible, just then, for Philip to think of all his plans for
the future, for he was quite content to bask in the happiness of the moment,
and leave to-morrow to fate.</p>
<p>It was with a feeling of something like annoyance that he noticed the coming
of a servant with what appeared to be a telegram on a salver. With an
apologetic glance to Lady Edna, he tore open the orange-coloured envelope and
ran his eyes quickly upon the somewhat long message it contained. The contents
were evidently disturbing, for Philip started slightly, and his face changed
colour.</p>
<p>Then he folded up the flimsy and dropped it carelessly into the pocket of
his dinner jacket.</p>
<p>"There's no answer, Barton," he said. "I think you were saying, Lady Edna,
that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Pray don't let us keep you, if it's any thing important," Lady Edna said.
"I thought you were rather disturbed. But don't stand on ceremony with us,
please."</p>
<p>"That is very good of you," Philip said gratefully. "It's only a little
matter of business which will keep. Not bad news, quite the contrary, I assure
you. Isn't that Shorland calling? Excuse me a moment."</p>
<p>Lady Edna said nothing, but she was quite sure that Shorland, standing on
the terrace, had said nothing. Philip passed along quickly and joined Shorland
on the terrace.</p>
<p>"Look here, Shorland," he said. "I've got some important information. I want
to discuss it with your father at once. It's politics. I can't tell you what,
but great things are in the air, and there is no time to be lost. Make some
excuse and come back in two or three minutes and lure your sister outside."</p>
<p>Five minutes later and Philip was alone with Sherringborne.</p>
<p>"I have something to say to you," he said, "something of the utmost
importance. I have just had a cable message from the Baron de la Croisa at San
Toro."</p>
<p>"Eh, what?" Sherringborne asked. "San Toro. What on earth is the Baron doing
there?"</p>
<p>"Ah, that I can't tell you," Philip said, "though I can make a pretty shrewd
guess. But the news is this: There has been a great earthquake and most
disastrous tidal wave off the coast of Tortina, and the other islands have been
totally destroyed. Not a vestige of them remains. I am sure you will appreciate
what this means."</p>
<p>Sherringborne gasped. Just for a moment he turned deadly pale and was
obviously on the verge of collapse. Then he rallied and rose to his feet
excitedly.</p>
<p>"Of course I appreciate it," he said. "Those outer islands belong to Japan,
that is why they claimed a sort of protectorate over Tortina. They wanted to
fortify those islands, which they had every right to do, and thus they would
have been a constant menace to the port of St. Lucia in case of trouble. They
could have dominated St. Lucia, and they could have prevented any navy calling
there except their own. But the thing goes a great deal further than that, my
dear Philip. If this amazing news is true, then we can take it for granted that
Japan will show no further interest in Tortina. What they will want to do now
is to make arrangements with America for the joint development of San Toro as a
naval base on an international footing for the coaling of the navies of the
world. Philip, if this is true, then all my troubles are ended. There is no
occasion for me to care who knows about my holdings in Tortina Concessions,
because those become simply a commercial speculation that any statesman might
dabble in. But is it true?"</p>
<p>"I am perfectly certain it is," Philip said. "To begin with, the cablegram
is signed by de la Croisa, and, in the second place, I learnt, quite by
accident, in the gallery of the House of Commons some month ago from a native
of Tortina, that those Outer Islands were merely coral, and that Japan dare not
fortify them because the islands wouldn't carry any weight of ordnance. I was
told that the first earthquake would wash them away. And on that priceless
piece of information I gambled. Oh, the thing is quite true, and I congratulate
you from the bottom of my heart."</p>
<p>But Sherringborne did not appear to be listening. His mind was evidently far
away. Gradually the strained look left his face and he smiled like a man who is
healthily and happily tired and in need of a good night's sleep.</p>
<p>"Would you mind leaving me to myself for a few minutes, my boy?" he asked.
"I shall know how to thank you presently. It looks to me as if you had saved
the honour of my house."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.&mdash;"IN FORMA PAUPERIS."</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Lady Edna stood there, on the terrace looking across the lawns
and deep old rose gardens in the direction of Borne Abbey. She was alone, for
Shorland had gone off in the direction of the stables in search of the head
coachman who was more or less a friend of his, for horses and dogs had an
irresistible fascination for the man who had been brought up amongst them all
his life, and, indeed, had he stuck to those humble companions, it would have
been better for him, and better for the fortunes of his house. He had made some
trivial excuse for calling Lady Edna outside, and she had remained there, more
or less fascinated by the beauty of the evening.</p>
<p>In the hall she could hear Sherringborne and Philip talking with a certain
intimacy that prevented her joining them for the moment.</p>
<p>And it was beautiful out there, with the primrose light in the sky throwing
up Borne Abbey like some exquisite cameo and gradually fading on the trees in
the park. And this was her own home, the spot where she had been born and bred,
the fair corner of England that was endeared to her by a thousand
recollections.</p>
<p>And she was beginning to recognise now that all this had been preserved to
her by a man whom she had despised, even before she had seen him. She was under
a deep debt to the new owner of "The Chantrey," and, here she was, standing
under the shadow of his own threshold, almost at his good pleasure.</p>
<p>There was something almost amazing about it, something that she was yet
trying to grasp, and bring in the right perspective. She stood there, on the
terrace, leaning her bare arms on the stone balustrade, and fighting it all out
in her mind. For perhaps the first time in her life she was indulging in the
pains and pleasures of self-analysis. She was contrasting the Cranwallises with
the rest of human nature, not altogether to the advantage of that proud clan.
She was coming to realise, for the first time, that there were people in the
world with attributes and qualities that the house of Cranwallis had never
possessed. She was trying to think, too, that there was something quixotic in
the way in which Philip Saltburn had imperilled his own fortune for the sake of
people who, a few months ago, would only have regarded him with tolerant
contempt.</p>
<p>And Lady Edna had never admired Philip Saltburn quite as much as she did at
that moment. Still, she knew perfectly well that if the circumstances had been
reversed, she might have acted precisely as Saltburn was doing, but then there
was a vast difference between the family of Saltburn and the great and
distinguished house of Cranwallis.</p>
<p>But was there so much difference after all?</p>
<p>The question forced itself upon Lady Edna, and clamoured for a reply. After
all, dishonour and disgrace are relative terms, and only a matter of
comparison.</p>
<p>It seemed hard to stand there, on that wide spread of terrace with the great
medieval pile behind her, and associate it with disgrace. But, all the same,
disgrace had not been very far off, and Lady Edna could not forget it. Even now
it might be hanging over that distinguished clan. And, at any rate, if it were
averted, there was only one person that they had to thank for it, and that was
Philip Saltburn.</p>
<p>He had come forward in the crisis, he had staked everything he possessed to
save a set of people who were comparative strangers to him. And now whilst they
were once more basking in a blaze of prosperity, he was still prepared to risk
all he had. It was very generous, and very noble, but, at the same time, Lady
Edna asked herself if there were not some other way out of it. She would have
liked to have interfered, but she could scarcely see how this was to be done.
And whilst she was still standing there, she heard a footstep on the path, and
turned to see the very man who was uppermost in her mind.</p>
<p>He looked grave and preoccupied, there was the sternness of seriousness on
his face that Lady Edna had never seen before. She extended her hand to him and
smiled a welcome. There was something very warm and encouraging in her smile
that might have astonished those people who regarded her as cold and heartless.
She did not suggest those drawbacks at that moment.</p>
<p>"I was just thinking about you," she said.</p>
<p>"It's quite mutual," Saltburn replied. "I have been talking to your father.
Something has happened that has changed the whole position. Lord Sherringborne
has asked me to leave him for a time."</p>
<p>"He is not ill?" Lady Edna asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Does good news ever hurt anyone?" Philip suggested. "And this is good news
indeed. It is all going our way at last, our way, mind you."</p>
<p>Lady Edna betrayed some signs of confusion.</p>
<p>"I spoke unthinkingly," she said. "But all the same, I am glad he came here
to-night. And I have been wondering, too, Mr. Saltburn, why are you so
interested in our unhappy affairs?"</p>
<p>"Can't you guess?" Philip asked. "Don't you understand? I came here hoping
to be your friend. I came here as a stranger hoping that you would accept me
for myself, and I think you would have done so had not my father interfered. He
does not understand&mdash;he doesn't understand anything except money and how
to make it."</p>
<p>"I am sorry to hear that," Lady Edna said, "true as it is. But money is not
everything."</p>
<p>"If you say you are sorry, I know you are speaking the truth. And, since you
know so much, I may tell you that things were very bad indeed. You see, my
father had been too successful. Everything has gone his way from the start. I
don't say he isn't a financial genius, because he is. And he has courage and
audacity and imagination. But, at the same time, he has had all the luck
without knowing it."</p>
<p>"Haven't we shared that sort of luck?" Lady Edna asked demurely.</p>
<p>"This good fortune he attributes entirely to his own abilities," Philip went
on. "He has a sort of idea that he is a cloud-compelling providence. That was
why, I suppose, he underrated the position of Japan. Still, he might have won,
but for certain forces over which he had no control. I hope I am not boring you
with these details."</p>
<p>"I am deeply interested," Lady Edna said.</p>
<p>"Well, then, so far as he is concerned, everything has gone by the board.
And tomorrow people in the city will be talking about it. The one thing I have
to do is to find some money with as little delay as possible. If that is done
my father might just manage to escape shipwreck. I have helped to save your
name, it is my duty to save another's."</p>
<p>"It is not a certainty, then?"</p>
<p>"Oh, by no means. Still, it is worth trying, and I mean to risk the
experiment. And, after all, what does it matter? Suppose I lose everything? I
am young enough to begin again. And, what is more, I should enjoy it."</p>
<p>"And all your ambitions?" Lady Edna asked.</p>
<p>"I am afraid they are not of much account," Philip laughed a little
unsteadily. "I never cared anything for politics, and modern business has no
attractions for me. Besides, it isn't clean enough for my taste. My ambition
was to settle down here as a country gentleman."</p>
<p>"But, surely," Lady Edna protested, "surely&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, that isn't quite all," Saltburn went on. "I hoped some day to marry.
That dream will possibly be shattered, and that is the part which hurts the
most. I couldn't very well ask the woman I have in my mind to come out yonder
with me, and live in a log cabin. Even my audacity shrinks from that."</p>
<p>"Ah, you are like most of the men," Lady Edna smiled. "You look at it all
from the masculine point of view. Don't you think you might pay the lady the
compliment of asking her?"</p>
<p>"You tempt me," Saltburn said. "And if I forget myself and go a step too
far&mdash;"</p>
<p>"One moment," Lady Edna cried hastily.</p>
<p>"Are you quite determined to make the sacrifice you speak of?"</p>
<p>"That is absolutely settled," Philip said. "We don't want to discuss the
point any further. I am just as keen to preserve my good name as you are to
keep yours."</p>
<p>"Yes, I like to hear you talk like that. And now I come to a point which I
cannot overlook. I have been kept in the dark as much as possible, and I have
discovered many things more by accident than anything else. I know, for
instance, that it was you who saved us. Oh, you needn't shake your head; you
need not try to deny it. If it hadn't been for you, a great disaster would have
overtaken us. My father would have lost his right to stand prominently in the
front rank of statesmen. And yet to-day his reputation has never been so
marked. And all this we owe to you. Absolutely, we owe it all to your
disinterested kindness. And yet you had little encouragement. And you came here
first when I didn't want to see you. I should not even have received you had
not my father insisted on it. And how badly Shorland behaved to you. And yet it
made no difference. You went on just the same, and now it is impossible to
thank you for what you have done. But why did you do it? What claim have we
upon you?"</p>
<p>"One moment," Saltburn interrupted. "Isn't the question a bit superfluous?
You underrate your own intelligence, Lady Edna. Why does a young man do these
disinterested things?"</p>
<p>Saltburn turned a keen glance upon her. He laid his hand upon her arm as it
lay there, white and gleaming on the stone balustrade, and there was a
masterfulness in his grip that was not displeasing.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, you do," he said. "You know perfectly well. You don't suppose I was
blind when I came here. You don't suppose that I failed to see what your
feelings towards me were? Nobody could be more polite and gracious than
yourself. But in every word you said, in every glance and gesture, you were
marking your superiority over me. You let me know I was here on sufferance. And
to a certain extent I was amused. And then, well, then, I had other feelings.
And there is a good deal of my father's obstinacy in my nature, and gradually
the force of circumstances threw us a good deal together. We had to be on the
same side, and after a bit you began to see that I might possibly be worthy of
your friendship."</p>
<p>"Can there be any doubt of that," Lady Edna murmured.</p>
<p>"I thank you for that. I know you mean it sincerely. And we are good
friends, now, are we not?"</p>
<p>"You are the best and truest friend I ever had," Lady Edna murmured. "I am
thankful for the chance to tell you so."</p>
<p>She lifted her face to Saltburn's now. Her eyes were steady enough, but they
were swimming in a luminous moisture, and the pallid ivory of her face was
suffused with red. Saltburn's hand was still upon her arm as he spoke.</p>
<p>"That was something gained, wasn't it?" he smiled. "And when I found that I
had gained it, I began to see my way to my ambition at last. I had all that a
man desires to make a woman happy, and up till quite recently the way appeared
to be quite clear. And, now, unfortunately, I find there is something more than
ambition and the gratification of one's personal desires. I hope this doesn't
all sound too much like the maxims in one's old copy-books. But then, you see,
I have put a certain amount of restraint on my feelings, but I feel sure you
know what I mean. You said just now I was like the majority of men and only
took the masculine point of view. I am trying to show you now why it is
absolutely necessary that I should do so. Now, honestly, wouldn't you suggest
that a prospective pauper like myself should not come, say, to a girl in your
position and coolly ask her to become his wife. Now is it logical?"</p>
<p>"It may not be logical," Lady Edna laughed unsteadily. "But I know if I were
a man I should do so."</p>
<p>It was a bold thing to say, and Lady Edna caught herself wondering how she
could have had the audacity to utter it. An hour or two before she would have
resented the mere suggestion of an understanding between Philip Saltburn and
herself.</p>
<p>And now, when it seemed to her that she was going to lose him, that he was
going to place everything before his love for her, then she knew that she could
not let him go. What did anything matter if there was to be no Philip Saltburn
by her side in the future?</p>
<p>"I have said too much," Saltburn muttered.</p>
<p>"Have you?" Lady Edna asked. "Oh, no. On the contrary, it seems to me that
you have left off at the most interesting part of the story. My dear Philip,
you are never going to force me&mdash;"</p>
<p>Saltburn stepped back. He was on the verge of a passionate outburst. Then he
heard the sound of footsteps, and William Saltburn stood behind him, breathing
hard, as if he had come a long way at full speed. He did not see Lady Edna at
all.</p>
<p>"I want you," he panted. "I have motored down on purpose to see you. It is
necessary that I should see Sherringborne at once. You must manage this for me,
Philip."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.&mdash;A MATTER OF NERVES.</h2>
<p>Lady Edna drew back. It seemed no place for her. She bowed graciously to
Saltburn, though her aloofness was as marked as ever, and made a
suggestion.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you would like to be left alone with your father," she said. "There
is no occasion whatever to stand on ceremony. Lord Sherringborne will
understand. And we shall enjoy the walk back across the park this perfect
evening."</p>
<p>William Saltburn looked almost grateful, his face was hot and dirty, his
eyes bloodshot. Just for a moment Philip caught himself wondering as to whether
or not his father had committed a crime, and was looking for someone to help
him. Certainly Philip had never seen the older man in circumstances like these
before. He turned to speak to Lady Edna, but she had vanished.</p>
<p>"I came down here at once," Saltburn said. "It's a pressing business,
Phil."</p>
<p>"One minute," Philip said. "I can't let my guests go like this. I must speak
to Sherringborne."</p>
<p>But Sherringborne and his family had already departed. Philip could see them
as they walked down the drive in the direction of the Abbey, he could catch the
expression in Lady Edna's face as she waved her hand to him.</p>
<p>"That's the man that matters," Saltburn said hoarsely. "Sherringborne, and
nobody else. And I regarded him as little better than a fool. I thought he was
no more than a gilded popinjay. I was idiot enough to believe he was like all
the rest of them, and that he owed his office to the fact that he was a
Cranwallis."</p>
<p>"We all make mistakes," Philip murmured.</p>
<p>"I thought I should be able to do as I liked with him," Saltburn went on. "I
thought I should be able to twist him round my little finger and make him dance
like a doll at the end of a string, and that is where I made the mistake, my
boy; Sherringborne is a cleverer man than I."</p>
<p>"Hadn't you better explain?" Philip said.</p>
<p>"Well, it's pretty plain, isn't it? Sherringborne was in my way, he was
interfering with my plans, and it became a question of whether I suffered or he
did. Oh, I worked it out in my mind, and when I had got that man beaten I was
going to make my own terms."</p>
<p>Saltburn shook his fist at the receding Sherringborne.</p>
<p>"And he looked so easy, too. I never thought that he would be able to stand
up to me when the pinch came, but I was wrong. When the pinch did come I found
him to be a better man than myself. I don't believe I've got the head I used to
have. It never occurred to me that Sherringborne would be able to use the whole
of the Diplomatic force behind him to get the better of me."</p>
<p>"He didn't," Philip said. "That's where you went wrong."</p>
<p>"But that's what he has done. If it hadn't been for my policy as regards
those Tortina concessions, there never would have been any trouble between
Japan and America at all."</p>
<p>Saltburn spoke in quick, jerky sentences, but the wild look was no longer in
his eye.</p>
<p>"You brought the trouble about deliberately?" Philip asked.</p>
<p>"Certainly I did. And why? So that I could ruin that proud old aristocrat.
Render his concessions worthless by stirring up Japan, and buying them after at
my own price. Then, when I had him bankrupt, you had to step in, and Lady Edna
would have only been too glad&mdash;"</p>
<p>Philip listened more in sorrow than in anger. "All this I saw quite
plainly," he said, "but, with the best intentions in the world you were bent on
ruining my chances with Lady Edna. She belongs to a class you will never
understand. She would rather die than consent&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Rubbish," Saltburn cried. "She couldn't live without all this. I tell you,
my boy&mdash;"</p>
<p>He waved his hand round comprehensively. The sad vexed expression was still
on Philip's face.</p>
<p>"It is quite hopeless to argue," he said. "When I want to marry, I want a
wife to take me, not my position. And Lady Edna will marry the man she loves,
even if she has to live in a hut. Only an hour ago she practically told me so.
But all this is beating the air. What do you want me to do?"</p>
<p>"Get Sherringborne to see me in the morning. I have a proposal to make that
may save the situation yet. I suppose you have heard what has happened in
Tortina?"</p>
<p>"I have," Philip said. "We shall hear of no more trouble between the States
and Japan. And my Tortina speculation will come back a hundredfold. You see, I
was acting on a hint from Prince Ito. It was the Port of San Toro that the
people from Tokio were after all the time."</p>
<p>Saltburn burst out stormily, his big voice boomed to heaven.</p>
<p>"And you knew this all the time," he raved. "Knew it and never told me."</p>
<p>"Because I could not betray a confidence," Philip said. "My dear father, the
diplomacy of little Republics, and that of big Powers is a very different
matter. Toy States can be bought, as the international financier knows, but a
country like Japan!"</p>
<p>Sherringborne, approached next morning, had no objection to meeting his old
foe. He was gracious and debonair as usual.</p>
<p>"Why this mystery, Mr. Saltburn?" he asked. "Why didn't you write in the
ordinary way and make an appointment?"</p>
<p>"I prefer this way, if you don't mind," Saltburn said. "The last time I was
here the circumstances were very different."</p>
<p>There was a threat underlying the words, but, for the life of him, Saltburn
could not restrain the impulse. Obviously it was his policy to come to this
man, hat in hand, but just for the moment the old Adam was uppermost.</p>
<p>He felt unreasonably angry, and he was writhing under the patent sense of
his own inferiority. The contrast was so great that he could not restrain
himself, and Sherringborne saw it quite clearly too, for, despite his easy
smile, there was a tinge of colour in his cheeks.</p>
<p>"That was not quite discreet of you," he murmured.</p>
<p>"It wasn't," Saltburn admitted bluntly. "But then, I have not been bred up
to diplomacy. The last time I was here was on the night of your illness."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," Sherringborne murmured. "Pray go on. You appear to be in trouble,
Mr. Saltburn. If I can help you, I shall be only too glad to do so."</p>
<p>"I am up to my neck in it," Saltburn said. "I need not tell you how I am
situated, you know the position as well as I do. The whole world is beginning
to know it. They say that William Saltburn is on his last legs, and, by gad,
it's true. That earthquake business has finished me off. I have backed the
wrong horse, Sherringborne, and that's all there is to it."</p>
<p>"I am really sorry," Sherringborne murmured. "Well, you're the man who
backed the winner. You are too clever for me, and that's the naked truth. And a
pretty bitter confession it is. But I should have worried through had it not
been for that earthquake in Tortina. Can't you manage to take a hand,
Sherringborne?"</p>
<p>"But how?" Sherringborne asked. "Surely you are not suggesting that I should
put pressure on Tortina, where Santa Anna, the President, is ostensibly a
friend of England? Come, Mr. Saltburn, that is not worthy of a man of your
ability."</p>
<p>"I don't want any soft soap," Saltburn said doggedly. "And who said anything
about putting pressure on Tortina? The Concession holders will do that fast
enough, and you're one of them. If you can give me an introduction to Prince
Ito and ask him to treat me as a friend of yours, I think I can see a way
out."</p>
<p>Sherringborne smiled good-humouredly.</p>
<p>"Your idea certainly has the merit of novelty," he said. "But you will
pardon me if I say it is utterly absurd. A little reflection will show you
this. Your business methods in Tortina have done mischief enough in Tortina as
it is, but I assure you that I am quite powerless in the matter."</p>
<p>"You could have prevented the whole thing if you had liked," Saltburn
snarled. "Oh! I know when you put your money in Tortina the political sky was
quite clear, but if you had not invested in those concessions I should never
have had&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Seen your way to ruin me," Sherringborne said quietly. "I am not a very
wise man, Mr. Saltburn, but I have seen your policy quite clearly from the
first day you came here, and I learnt your&mdash;shall I say, without
offence?&mdash;early history."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know that I underrated your intellect," Saltburn said almost
brutally, "but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There is no but about it," Sherringborne said. "You were going to drag me
in the mud through my public position. You meant to tell the House of Commons
that I had used my official knowledge in connection with my Tortina
investments, and that, when hostilities threatened, I suppressed the fact so
that I could benefit&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not for my own sake entirely," Saltburn cried, off his guard. "I was
thinking more of my son and daughter&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Really," Sherringborne interrupted. "This is an extraordinary conversation.
I make every allowance for your feelings, but you are putting a great strain on
my patience."</p>
<p>"You can help me if you like," Saltburn growled.</p>
<p>"Possibly yes, I think it highly probable that Prince Ito would help you if
he had a suggestion from our Foreign Office. But he's not the least likely to
get it. My dear sir, if your nerves&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I am not the only nervous one," Saltburn said truculently. "I saw that
when I was here last. And you had good reason."</p>
<p>Saltburn had overstepped the mark at last. Sherringborne turned on him a
face clouded with anger.</p>
<p>"Since you take this attitude," he said. "I will ask you to speak a little
more plainly."</p>
<p>"I will," Saltburn said. "A few months ago you broke down badly, you came
precious near to bankruptcy and lost your reputation as well as health. You had
done an exceedingly foolish thing, and I knew it as well as you did."</p>
<p>"Folly is not dishonesty," Sherringborne said.</p>
<p>"It's all carefully covered up now, but if it hadn't been for my
son&mdash;my son, of all people in the world&mdash;you would have had to leave
Borne Abbey and let it to strangers. And you're not safe, even yet. You will
never be safe till the mystery of El Murid's death is cleared up. It was bad
for you when he died, but it may be worse if his private papers fall into
certain hands. Now, supposing I can get hold of those papers? At what price are
you prepared to get them back? I don't mean in money."</p>
<p>Sherringborne had lost all his courtly dignity now. He showed neither fear
nor confusion, but Saltburn could see that he was making an impression.</p>
<p>"I am not going to admit that any such papers exist," Sherringborne said,
"though El Murid was a great personal friend of mine, and I was in regular
communication with him. He was the one man in Tortina I could trust, and when
one writes to a man like that one naturally says a good deal that is not
intended for publication. Public policy, and that sort of thing. Now, let us
understand one another plainly, Mr. Saltburn. You came here today to blackmail
me."</p>
<p>"That's a lie," Saltburn cried. "Call it bargain if you like."</p>
<p>"And if I don't agree to the bargain then you threaten to ruin me by
disclosing letters which you hint have fallen into your hands, and which were
written by me to El Murid. Am I wrong? Because if I am I will apologise for
mistaking you for a contemptible scoundrel whom I ought to have kicked out of
my house."</p>
<p>"Then you mean to fight," Saltburn challenged.</p>
<p>"My dear sir, it is no question of fighting at all. Surely we can argue this
matter out without violent methods. If I misunderstood you I am sorry, but you
will quite see for yourself that it would be foolish on my part&mdash;"</p>
<p>Sherringborne broke off abruptly as the door opened and a servant came in.
Then, behind the servant appeared the well-known figure of de la Croisa.</p>
<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," the Baron cried. "I thought you were alone. Ah,
surely this is our mutual friend, Mr. Saltburn. We are well met, sir."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.&mdash;"WHO IS ON MY SIDE?"</h2>
<p>The situation was saved. Sherringborne knew that directly he glanced at the
easy, smiling face of de la Croisa. And Saltburn knew now that his last plank
was gone.</p>
<p>And the Baron, in his turn, summed up the situation in a look. He glanced
significantly at Sherringborne and tapped his breast-pocket. Sherringborne was
making play with his handkerchief now. He wiped his heated face with an
expression to the effect that the day was warm.</p>
<p>It had been touch and go with him, but now he could see that there was no
further use for fear. He could be gracious enough to Saltburn. Indeed, there
was nothing to gain by any other course.</p>
<p>"I have been having a rather unpleasant conversation with Mr. Saltburn," he
said. "Really, those disturbances in Tortina are very disastrous for British
shareholders. Mr. Saltburn has taken the trouble to come all the way from
London in their interests, to suggest a course to me whereby something, at any
rate, can be saved from the wreck. Unhappily, it is a course I cannot see my
way to adopt."</p>
<p>Saltburn said nothing. He had utterly and irretrievably lost now. Broken as
he was and desperate, he could still find time to envy Sherringborne his easy
manner and the way in which he had turned all unpleasantness aside. And it was
not in Saltburn's nature, either, to make a dignified exit.</p>
<p>"Well, I won't waste your time any longer," he said. "I wish you both good
day."</p>
<p>It was the best he could do in the circumstances. He turned on his heel
abruptly, and strode across the room through the French window on to the
terrace. De la Croisa threw himself into a chair and laughed softly.</p>
<p>"It seems to me, my dear friend," he said, "that I have arrived at what the
novelists call the psychological moment. Unless I am greatly mistaken, our
Berserk friend was threatening you when I came."</p>
<p>"Well, to be quite candid, he was," Sherringborne admitted. "To say he was
here on behalf of the English investors in Tortinas is a mere figure of speech.
As you can guess, he was here on behalf of William Saltburn."</p>
<p>"And the devil take the hindmost, eh!"</p>
<p>"He looks like losing what he has left owing to that disastrous earthquake.
He has contracted to sell thousands of Tortinas at starvation prices, and he
has no shares to deliver unless he buys them at a fancy figure. I am sorry for
the man, but I could not possibly do as he asked. The situation is a bit too
delicate for me to interfere. And when I refused Saltburn threatened me with
certain indiscreet letters you know of. And, just for a moment I believed that
he had them."</p>
<p>"He was never within miles of them," de la Croisa smiled.</p>
<p>"And then you turned up, for all the world like the comedian at the end of
the third act. What a wonderful instinct you have for doing the right thing.
And, of course, those letters are in your breast-pocket at the present moment.
I could not be mistaken."</p>
<p>"Correct, as usual," the Baron cried gaily. "But I have had what you call
the very devil of a job. I've been in Tortina for weeks with no little risk to
myself, but I managed to smuggle the letters through eventually. Still, I
shouldn't have done it without Lady Shorland's assistance."</p>
<p>"Ah," Sherringborne cried. "Then she got the letters for me after all."</p>
<p>"My dear fellow, she got the whole of her father's papers. She played the
part of a queen in a revolutionary comedy. She denounced Santa Anna from the
stage of the Union Theatre in St. Lucia, and told the audience the truth with
Santa Anna in a box. She denounced Santa Anna as her father's
murderer&mdash;for El Murid was murdered. She carried the whole audience with
her, and Santa Anna had to flee for his life. The old constitution party is
back in power again, and everything goes well. They wanted me to stay and join
the new administration. All this happened nearly a month ago, but Santa Anna
had cut the cables, and consequently&mdash;"</p>
<p>"So it was Lady Shorland who can claim all the credit for the campaign?"
Sherringborne asked.</p>
<p>"She behaved splendidly. I tell you, that woman is a born diplomatist, and
she has a fine natural courage of her own as well. I think I can congratulate
you on your daughter-in-law. People may be disposed to sneer at her, but she
will be a great force some of these days. I shouldn't be surprised if she made
a man of Shorland yet."</p>
<p>"I will thank you later on," Sherringborne said quietly. "What an
extraordinary thing it is that this ill-assorted marriage of Shorland's should
have gone to save my political reputation."</p>
<p>"Oh, all the sympathy is on the side of the lady," de la Croisa laughed.
"Still, you can speak to her when you get the opportunity. We both came back
together this morning and are rather disappointed to find that the fatted calf
had not been killed for our reception. We sent a telegram from Paris. Didn't
you get it?"</p>
<p>"I haven't seen it," Sherringborne explained. "I suppose they are making
Lady Shorland comfortable?"</p>
<p>Lady Shorland had seen to that for herself. She had made herself quite at
home in the hall, where she was devouring tea and muffins with a fine healthy
appetite. It was still a mystery to Lady Edna how all this had come about. She
had received her sister-in-law with a certain cold cordiality, which was not
altogether unmixed with a sense of being out in the cold. There was a
neighbouring duchess calling at the time.</p>
<p>Of course, in time Lady Shorland would have to meet these people, but not
until she had been educated up to so trying an ordeal. It was not to be
expected that she would be able to live up to the rich cream of society like
this. But she seemed to fit naturally in her place and even to take the lead.
Lady Edna watched her with a certain sort of satisfaction. But it was not till
the end of the trying afternoon and the great one of the earth had gone that
Lady Edna was forced to admit to herself that her sister-in-law had been an
absolute social success.</p>
<p>Lady Shorland took it all cooly enough. She sat, after tea, on the terrace
smoking a cigarette and criticising the recent visitors.</p>
<p>"I'm glad I met them," she said. "It's just as well to take the top first.
Now, confess it, my dear child, weren't you terribly frightened when I turned
up to-day. You are a very candid girl, and very transparent. It is a great
fault of yours that you allow your face to speak your mind too freely."</p>
<p>"I hope," Lady Edna began, "I hope, Ninon, that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And yet I didn't shock you so terribly just now, did I? Now do you know
what the Duchess did when she went away? She has a big political demonstration
at the Castle early next month, and she has asked me to go and stay with her
for a fortnight and help to amuse the people. What do you think of that?"</p>
<p>"And are you going?" Lady Edna asked.</p>
<p>"Going! Of course I am. I've got to meet these people sooner or later, and I
might just as well start in the right place. And I am not going to be
handicapped because I happened to marry a poor thing like Shorland. And between
ourselves, my dear, it's a precious good thing for the Cranwallises that I did
marry Shorland. Oh, I don't want any gratitude, because I was thinking as much
of myself as of you. And I suppose by this time you know why I went to
Tortina?"</p>
<p>A bright flush tinged Lady Edna's cheeks.</p>
<p>"I don't like to think of it," she murmured.</p>
<p>"Then don't think of it. You are never likely to hear me mention it again. I
was quite successful, though I ran risks and did things which you would have
shrunk from. If I were to put all my adventures into a book a publisher would
not look at it. He would say that the thing was too improbable. But all the
same, the dear old Baron and myself had a grand time together, and I shouldn't
mind having it all over again. Still, it has turned out very well, all except
one thing, and that gives me a good deal of cause for regret."</p>
<p>"And what is that?" Lady Edna asked.</p>
<p>"Well, I am worried about Philip Saltburn. I have only met him a few times,
and I have formed a very high opinion of him. He wasn't much in my old set, of
course. That set consisted of Grand Dukes and gilded fools and immensely
wealthy capitalists, most of them of Hebrew extraction. You would be surprised
to know what a deal I know about finance. I believe I should have been a big
success in the city. And I have got a great deal of information lately from the
Baron. I know exactly what Philip Saltburn has done, and it will be my business
to see that he gets the best results from his Christian action. There is not
the slightest reason why he should waste all his own fortune in trying to
bolster up his father's credit, but it can be done another way. And, besides,
how can the poor fellow get married when he has nothing to live upon? That
would be very hard on you."</p>
<p>"I don't quite follow you," Lady Edna said coldly.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you do, my dear. It is all very well to speak in that frigid way,
and hold your pretty head at that fascinating angle, but that can't prevent the
colour rising in your cheeks at the mention of Saltburn's name. Why, you are
head over heels in love with the man."</p>
<p>"Ninon, how dare you?" Lady Edna cried with flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>"Anyone who has eyes can see that when you are together. Oh, I know what I
am talking about. I have had my own little romance, though I have put it aside
for the sake of a man like Shorland. And if you only know it you are a
decidedly lucky girl. Marry him, you little idiot, marry him. He is worth a
waggon-load of the gilded noodles that one meets in society. Of course, I don't
want to interfere, but whatever your fate is, you can't do more than marry a
gentleman, and Philip Saltburn is that if I ever saw one."</p>
<p>Lady Edna abandoned the unequal contest. It was perfectly impossible to
stave off a direct attack delivered in this uncompromising fashion. She could
only protest feebly.</p>
<p>"Mr. Saltburn is a poor man," she said shamefacedly.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, he isn't. At any rate, he won't be by the time I have done with
him. Now I'm not going to sit quietly by and see him playing ducks and drakes
with your happiness and his simply because he has a quixotic idea that he ought
to help that rascally father of his. I am going to take a hand at this
game."</p>
<p>"You would not dare," Lady Edna gasped.</p>
<p>"Oh, wouldn't I? You don't know me yet, my child. I've got a little scheme
of my own for the saving of the situation as far as William Saltburn is
concerned, and that without getting Philip to put his hand in his pocket for a
penny. I suppose I know nine out of every ten great financiers in Europe. And I
shall know how to handle this problem when the time comes."</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Saltburn with it?" Lady Edna asked. "I am not doing this for the
sake of William Saltburn, my dear. I am doing it for yours. And the time will
come when you will be grateful. Indeed, I shouldn't wonder if the time came
when you were bound to admit that I did a very kindly thing when I permitted
Shorland to ally me with this illustrious family."</p>
<p>Lady Edna smiled in spite of herself. Indeed, she was almost ready to admit
that now. And she was really beginning to take a liking to this pretty
fascinating creature who had come into her life with dramatic suddenness.</p>
<p>"I won't discuss the matter any further," Lady Shorland said. "By the way,
Shorland tells me that we are going over to 'The Chantrey' to lunch with Philip
Saltburn on Monday. Now, I wanted to ask him to get his father there. Never
mind why, you can leave that to me. Only see that it is done, that's all. And
then you will see what you will see. I am your fairy godmother, my dear."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.&mdash;IN HONOUR BOUND.</h2>
<p>Though the miracle had happened, Philip Saltburn was feeling no easier in
his mind. True, he had saved the honour of the house of Cranwallis, to say
nothing of its financial integrity, but at what a cost?</p>
<p>His father was ruined, and Philip had deliberately brought that ruin about.
And yet it had been the only way, the only way to keep Phil's reputation sweet
in Lady Edna's eyes, and preserve her friendship. Had William Saltburn had his
say, then Phil's romance was so much Dead Sea fruit.</p>
<p>The collapse of Santa Anna in Tortina, and the forces of nature intervening
on the Islands had blown Saltburn's scheme for humiliating Sherringborne and
his daughter to the winds. The Concessions now would make Sherringborne a rich
man again, rich in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>And Philip could share that prosperity. The political crisis was over, and
Sherringborne was saved. Japan would gain all she had been coveting from the
first&mdash;a treaty port at San Toro, and nothing more would be heard about
St. Lucia. And all this was due to Philip alone. He had won Lady Edna's
respect&mdash;more than that, he hoped&mdash;but at what a cost? To prove that
he was right he had been compelled to fight his own father with weapons placed
in his hands by Sherringborne, de la Croisa, and the Japanese Prince Ito, with
the result that his father stood on the verge of ruin.</p>
<p>And this must not be, must not, even if Philip had to sell 'The Chantrey'
and start again in some distant part of the world. So far as Philip could see,
nobody grasped the fact but himself.</p>
<p>However, in this he was reckoning without Lady Shorland. The solution was
plain enough to her, with that nimble intellect of hers, to say nothing that
she had enjoyed for some weeks the full benefit of de la Croisa's company and
confidence. By the time she got back to Borne Abbey she knew as much of the
situation as the Baron.</p>
<p>With his trouble heavy upon him, Philip was as wax in her hands, and all the
more, perhaps, that he could see that she was only too eager to help him.</p>
<p>"Then what are you going to do?" she asked.</p>
<p>"There is only one thing to do," Philip said. "My father must not suffer.
After all, he is my father; I must make good as far as I can."</p>
<p>Lady Shorland smiled.</p>
<p>"And 'The Chantrey'?" she asked. "The ambition to found a family? To say
nothing of love's young dream. My dear Philip, there is a better way than
yours."</p>
<p>"Lady Edna is lost to me now," Philip said gloomily.</p>
<p>"Not she. Send your father to me and don't worry. Trust El Murid's daughter
to find a way out. You have no idea what a good business woman I am. And I have
had some of the greatest financiers at my feet for years. Your father's name
shall be saved, and I shall wear a special frock I have imported from Paris at
your wedding."</p>
<p>Philip let it go at that. He wrote to his father the same evening, and the
elder man came down from London with none too good a grace.</p>
<p>"Anything more gone wrong?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Not so far as I know," Philip said. "All my arrangements are still
proceeding. But for some reason or another Lady Shorland wanted to see you, in
fact, she would take no refusal."</p>
<p>Saltburn broke into a strenuous laugh.</p>
<p>"Well, that's odd," he said. "What can that brilliant little adventuress,
want with me? She's never been what I call friendly, in fact, she's been at no
pains to disguise her feelings. Now I wonder what bee she's got in her bonnet
now."</p>
<p>"You're very complimentary," Philip said. "But I don't think it will be so
dull after all. You see, Lady Shorland thinks she can&mdash;well&mdash;get you
out of your difficulties."</p>
<p>William Saltburn remarked frankly enough that Lady Shorland was welcome to
try.</p>
<p>"She's well in with a lot of big people, I know," he said. "She's pretty,
she's fascinating, and she's got brains. And with all her Bohemianism she's
managed to keep her own record clean enough. At any rate, she would make a fine
ally for a financier working a big deal. But you don't know anything at all
about these things. If I wanted to bring about a big financial amalgamation,
I'd rather have Lady Shorland to work it for me than any man on earth. And
she's acquainted with all the capitalists, both here and in America. Upon my
word, I've a dashed good mind to offer her a share in a partnership. I'm dead
broke, but William Saltburn's not done for yet."</p>
<p>Philip was content to let it go at that and presently Lady Shorland took
William Saltburn in hand. She seemed to enjoy his society, and talked in a way
which excited the financier's admiration. It was after luncheon that she
insisted upon taking him round the garden and pointing out its manifold
beauties to him.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's a pretty place enough," Saltburn said contemptuously. "All very
well to come down to at week-ends when one gets tired of London. But I can't
understand why Philip wants to settle down here. A young man like that. He
ought to have more ambition."</p>
<p>"Well, he's not likely to have the chance now," Lady Shorland said. "Where
does he get his ideas from, Mr. Saltburn?"</p>
<p>"What ideas?" Saltburn asked.</p>
<p>"Why, his extraordinary ideas about honour and duty. He doesn't inherit them
from you, surely?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I've got no fads," Saltburn said, without the slightest show of
resentment. "I think I know what you mean, though. You think Philip is going to
be fool enough to hand over all the money he has to put into my business. Well,
that's what he has offered."</p>
<p>"I'm perfectly sure he would," Lady Shorland said in her sweetest manner.
"But what's the good of it? It won't really help you. Nothing less than a
couple of millions, would put you straight."</p>
<p>"That's true," William Saltburn admitted.</p>
<p>"But then, like all the rest of the financial gamblers, you have a sanguine
temperament, and you are selfish into the bargain. You might, at any rate,
express a certain amount of regret at ruining your son's prospects in this
way."</p>
<p>"If Phil had taken my advice&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He would have ruined everything. He wanted to settle down here as a country
gentleman with money to found a family. He would be Lord Sherringborne's
son-in-law, and that itself would give him a standing. And sooner or later,
after the first glamour of marriage had passed off, he would begin to take an
interest in politics. He couldn't help doing this, and I am perfectly certain
he would go very far indeed. And he has proved himself to be a great deal
cleverer than you are."</p>
<p>"That's true," William Saltburn admitted, not without pride.</p>
<p>"Instead of this, you are going to send him off, sooner or later, to get his
living by the picturesque occupation of cow-punching if you are selfish enough
to accept his offer. They do call it cow-punching, don't they?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Saltburn said. "But, see here, Lady Shorland, what are you
driving at? I don't want to injure the boy if I can help it. He's all I've got
and I'm dashed proud of him, though I don't care about telling people so. He's
different to me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I've noticed that," Lady Shorland smiled.</p>
<p>"Oh, you needn't laugh at me. You know what I mean. I expect Philip takes
after his mother. She was a lady, you know. Her people went out to Australia
nearly a century ago, and they belonged to the north country Bradleys. People
wondered why my wife ever came to marry me."</p>
<p>"Women do quaint things," Lady Shorland smiled. "It is one of their charms
in men's eyes."</p>
<p>"Well, at any rate, Philip's all right. Wherever he goes he is popular. And
I don't think it is for the sake of his money either. Look how thick he is with
the people in Borne Abbey. Why, he more or less lives there. And they have
known from the first that I used to be a boy in the kitchen. One of my
ambitions was to marry Philip to Lady Edna. I was going to force her into it,
more or less. And then I was going to tell them who I was&mdash;but that's all
knocked out now."</p>
<p>"Very strange," Lady Shorland said thoughtfully, "how an awfully clever man
in one thing can be a perfect fool in another. Now, that little scheme of yours
would never have answered. If you had ruined the whole family it would have
been just the same. Lady Edna would not have married Philip even if she had
been dying of love for him. Still, as you so tersely put it, all that is
knocked on the head now. And the strange part is that you knocked it out
yourself."</p>
<p>"I don't see that," Saltburn exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you have. You would have ruined everything by that selfishness of
yours. Now Philip and Lady Edna are vary much in love with one another, and the
whole thing was going beautifully when you blundered into it in the way you
aggressive men have. It would have all come right in the end. You don't expect
a pauper, an your boy will be if he hands everything over to you, to ask Lady
Edna Cranwallis to share his lot with him, do you? You can't imagine Lady Edna
out in what you call the 'back blocks,' scouring her saucepans and cooking her
own breakfast, can you?"</p>
<p>"I begin to see that I have made a fool of myself," Saltburn muttered.</p>
<p>"True. My good, man, what's going to become of all this money of Philip's
when he insists upon giving it to you?"</p>
<p>"He'll have it all back, and more, in ten years' time," the capitalist
cried. "Ah, I've not come to grief altogether."</p>
<p>"There is no reason why you should come to grief altogether. There are
scores of great financiers in the world who would be only too glad to have you
as partner. Naturally, you wouldn't go in on your own terms now. You would have
to take a second place, though the world wouldn't know it, of course. You would
be a kind of glorified servant, with your name over the shop door, so to speak,
but you would be a servant all the same."</p>
<p>"Show me the chance," Saltburn said doggedly.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, you could get rid of all your worries without losing
your reputation, and you would have more money than any one man would be able
to do with. And, again, you wouldn't be in a junior position for long, you are
too strong and masterful and unscrupulous for that."</p>
<p>"That's pretty plain speaking," Saltburn said.</p>
<p>"I brought you here for plain speaking. Do you know that I am a very clever
woman, Mr. Saltburn. If I hadn't been clever I shouldn't have married Shorland.
O, I knew what I wanted, and that, of course, was a matter of time. And I shall
make something of Shorland yet. And I am very anxious to see Philip in the
family. He would be exceedingly useful to me later on. But it is obvious that
Philip can't come into the family if you persist in taking his money."</p>
<p>"I see that," Saltburn said grudgingly.</p>
<p>"Very well, then. In that case, it is your duty to do as I tell you. Why
don't you go to one of the big Americans and get him to come in with you?
Several of them would be only too glad to have the chance. And you can make
your own terms pretty well. I know half a dozen men who would give an ear to
have a partner like yourself on this side of the Atlantic. There's van Ritter,
for instance. I'm perfectly certain he'd jump at the chance."</p>
<p>"But I don't know him," Saltburn said.</p>
<p>"Well, I do. And he is in London at the present moment. And he is a solid
man, he is rich simply because he can't help himself. But that doesn't prevent
him from having a desire to be richer still. He has a scheme for controlling
the markets here and in New York, and he was only telling me last night what he
could do if he had a partner after his own heart. And to be perfectly candid
with you, Mr. Saltburn, I mentioned your name. Of course, I didn't tell van
Ritter that I knew of your position, because that would be giving the game
away. I treated the whole thing quite as a matter of business, and I get a
commission if I bring off a deal with you. Now, Mr. Saltburn, you are never
going to be hardhearted enough to prevent a poor creature like myself from
earning an honest penny? Besides, Shorland and myself are dreadfully hard up,
and I have a lot of heavy bills to meet. Still, if you don't like the idea I
can try somebody else."</p>
<p>But Saltburn did not appear to be listening. He rose from the seat where he
had been sitting and began to pace up and down excitedly between the flower
beds. His quick commercial mind grasped the possibilities of this opening at
once. By the time he had taken half a dozen turns he saw his way clearly.</p>
<p>"I'll do it," he said. "I could double van Ritter's money in a few years.
And I suppose you've got nothing definite?"</p>
<p>Lady Shorland smiled innocently,</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I have," she said. "I told van Ritter for his own protection he
ought to put it in writing, because, you see, people make such funny mistakes,
and then after-wards they go about and say that they've been robbed, and all
sorts of stupid things. So you see we drew up an agreement, and when I showed
it to my solicitor before I left London he actually complimented me on it. Now,
don't you think it was very clever of an ignorant little woman like myself to
get all that down right?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you're very ignorant," Saltburn said grimly. "Still, I owe you
something for this, and you shall get your commission. You bring van Ritter and
myself together. And so far as I am concerned, Philip is quite free. I shan't
want his money now. And as to you, well, you ought to have been a man. And I
can't pay you a higher compliment than that."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.&mdash;THICKER THAN WATER.</h2>
<p>Lady Edna stood by Philip's side with her beautiful eyes turned in almost
rapt attention on the facade of "The Chantrey."</p>
<p>"I have always been fond of the house," she said. "Indeed, in some respects,
I prefer it to Borne Abbey. The Abbey frightens me at times. And I shall not be
sorry later on to hand it over to Shorland and his wife. I should not be
surprised if she makes quite a good hostess in time."</p>
<p>Philip was inclined to agree. Just for a moment his mind reverted to that
strange morning a few months back when Lady Edna and Lady Shorland had met in
such remarkable circumstances. Perhaps Lady Edna was thinking of the same
thing, too, for there was the suspicion of a smile on her lips.</p>
<p>"That was a bad start, though," Philip said. "But, of course, we must make
allowances for the artistic temperament. A woman isn't necessarily bad because
she wears picturesque dresses and smokes cigarettes in public. For my part I am
bound to confess that I like Lady Shorland. I should not be surprised if she
does not make a man of your brother yet. To a certain extent he is afraid of
her, and I know she has stopped his betting. When I saw him to-day, he looked
more fit than I have ever seen him."</p>
<p>"Ah, we are chastened in many ways," Lady Edna smiled. "But I really think
Lady Shorland is going to be a blessing in disguise. My education in worldly
matters has progressed at such a rate lately that I hardly know myself...What a
happy idea it is to have removed those fir trees, and placed a pergola along
that bank. And don't you think it would have been an improvement if you had
pulled down the old wall as well?"</p>
<p>"I did think of it," Philip said. "But it would be a sheer waste of money
now, I must leave that to my successor."</p>
<p>"Your successor?" Lady Edna exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Well, yes, I intended to tell you. You see, at the present moment, I want
all the money I can scrape together to help my father out of his pressing
difficulties. I am rather afraid it will be throwing good money after bad, but
still he is a wonderful man, and if he can't succeed, well then there's no
chance for anybody. And in a way his business is his life. If he goes down now
I don't think he will ever recover again. Of course, from a practical point of
view I am doing a foolish thing, but I have no intention of going back from it.
For the time being, of course, I shall be almost penniless, and the money I
shall get from letting this house furnished will be enough to keep me. I've got
a man coming down in a day or two to look at this house, and I feel quite sure
from what he said that we shall be able to come to terms."</p>
<p>"What are you thinking of doing?" Lady Edna asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I shall go abroad. I've got one or two friends out in Australia who
will be pleased enough to give me a start. But then things will come right
again, and then I shall come back. This isn't what I expected a week or so ago,
and I don't mind confessing to you that it has been a hard struggle to make
this sacrifice. I had been looking forward to a happy life here. I had been
looking forward to something else. But in common honesty and fairness I could
not mention that now. But, of course that's all a dream. I couldn't ask the
woman I love and admire more than anybody to share my lot, could I?"</p>
<p>"Haven't we argued this out before?" Lady Edna asked. "And besides, it all
depends on the woman."</p>
<p>"I know that. And in this case it depends on the man, too. I couldn't do it,
Lady Edna. I couldn't do it indeed. Fancy my suggesting to a girl brought up as
you are, for instance, that she should come out with me to Australia and rough
it for the next few years. Why her relations would not hear of it. And I would
not make the suggestion. Still, if I could only screw up my courage to ask her
to wait for me...I wonder if she would."</p>
<p>"You had better ask her," Lady Edna said, "That's the only way I know of
getting information."</p>
<p>"Oh, I might do that," Philip said thoughtfully. "I'll think it over. I
believe I am coming to dine with you to-night. I understand that Lord
Sherringborne was running down here with Sir James Pallisser to dine and
sleep."</p>
<p>"That was the arrangement," Lady Edna said.</p>
<p>"Then I'll tell you more about it after dinner. I really have not the
courage to do it now, here in broad daylight. I think I might manage it better
on the terrace this evening. By the way, is Shorland staying on?"</p>
<p>"I think so," said Lady Edna. "As far as I can understand, he has been away
for the best part of three weeks without getting into any mischief whatever.
Really, I shouldn't wonder if he became a respectable member of society after
all. And that reminds me of something I had forgotten. I have just recollected
that Shorland is heavily in your debt. I suppose he has not paid you, by some
remote chance?"</p>
<p>Philip waved the suggestion aside.</p>
<p>"That is a small matter," he said. "Shorland will pay me as soon as he can
turn round. And I'm not quite so hard up as all that, Lady Edna."</p>
<p>It was at this point that Lady Shorland and Saltburn joined the other two.
Saltburn was a little more subdued in his manner than usual, his mind appeared
to be occupied with something to the exclusion of everything else. But at the
same he appeared to have lost a great deal of his truculent expression, and the
light of battle had died out of his eyes.</p>
<p>It was an effort, perhaps, on his part, that he was actually making himself
agreeable to Lady Edna. Perhaps he, too, had learnt a lesson in the last hour
or two. Perhaps he, too, was beginning to understand that there are more
methods than one of attaining a desired end.</p>
<p>Hitherto, he had marched victoriously over the prostrate bodies of his foes,
he had asked and given no quarter, and probably he was all the harder for the
knowledge that hitherto he had found nothing to criticise in his own
methods.</p>
<p>And perhaps, on the other hand Lady Edna was just a little sorry for this
man who had come so near to the wrecking of a great career. She did not know
quite as much as the others. She did not know that the shadow of disgrace which
had loomed over the house of Cranwallis had been more or less produced by
William Saltburn himself.</p>
<p>She only saw before her a man of hard and resolute ambition who had, to a
certain extent, the merit of being Philip's father. This undoubtedly was a
point in his favour, and presently these two found themselves, to their
surprise, engaged in an almost amicable conversation. And plainly, William
Saltburn was trying to make himself agreeable.</p>
<p>"Philip is different to me," he said. "He seems to like a quiet country
life. If I had to live here always I should end by blowing my brains out. I
couldn't stand it."</p>
<p>"Your son is leaving here," Lady Edna said, William Saltburn laughed as if
something amused him.</p>
<p>"There's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip," he exclaimed. "And Philip is a
rare good lad. I didn't realise how good he was till Lady Shorland opened my
eyes for me. Do you know, Lady Edna, though I pass for a hard, practical man, I
am a bit of a dreamer too. I suppose most capitalists are. Pinero says that
capitalists are pawnbrokers with imaginations. And, upon my word, that's not
far wrong. It takes a good many sorts of people to make up a world, and I can't
blame everybody because they don't take the same view as I do. But don't you
believe all you hear, Lady Edna. Philip hasn't left 'The Chantrey' yet."</p>
<p>With this cryptic remark Saltburn turned away and asked if there were any
place hard by where he could get on to the telephone. There was an instrument,
it appeared, at the "Cranwallis Arms," and without further ceremony William
Saltburn turned and made off in that direction.</p>
<p>It was tea-time when Philip returned slowly and thoughtfully through the
woods. On the whole he was not particularly pleased with himself; it seemed to
him that he had acted somewhat in a cowardly way.</p>
<p>Lady Edna had given him the opportunity of speaking, indeed she had gone out
of her way to do so, and he had not spoken his mind. But he would have to tell
her.</p>
<p>He would have to explain fully the position of affairs to her, and leave the
decision in her hands. It wasn't for him to suggest anything in the way of an
engagement, but they might possibly come to something in the way of an
understanding whereby Lady Edna might wait.</p>
<p>Philip would not even ask for that. Indeed, it seemed to him that he had no
right to do so. He would leave it entirely to her. But even this decision
caused him no satisfaction. He wanted to be alone to think the matter out and
the sight of his father walking up and down the terrace was positively
distasteful to him.</p>
<p>The elder man appeared to be quite himself again. He carried his head high,
and the old light of battle was shining in his eyes.</p>
<p>"I wondered where you had got to," he said. "Come out here and smoke a
cigarette. Indoors doesn't seem to be big enough for me. I've been talking to
Lady Shorland about you. That is, about you and Lady Edna."</p>
<p>"That is very good of you," Philip said.</p>
<p>"Oh, you needn't be annoyed. It's all for your good, my boy. And so far as I
can see&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Is the matter worth discussing?" Philip asked quietly. "You know exactly
what my feelings towards Lady Edna are, but you must please allow me to manage
these things in my own way. If I had acted on your suggestion I should have
found myself forbidden the house long ago. But what does it all matter? Lady
Edna is as far away from me as the stars. For the next few years I shall be a
poor man, and poor men don't aspire to marry a Cranwallis."</p>
<p>"Still, if the girl cared for you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear father, that isn't the point at all. It is a matter of honour
entirely. I am not complaining, I am not going to make a martyr of myself. I
have promised to help you&mdash;"</p>
<p>William Saltburn burst into a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>"And you thought I was going to take your money," he cried. "Oh come, my
dear boy, I haven't reached that point yet, I admit that I was sorely tempted.
Keep the money you have, and the money you made in Tortina when you saved
Sherringborne, despite me. And, by heaven, you are right. You heard me ask just
now where I could get on to the telephone, didn't you? Well I have been having
a long conversation with a man who has been making overtures to me for
years."</p>
<p>The fiction was perhaps pardonable in the circumstances.</p>
<p>"I've settled the whole thing now, with van Ritter of New York, and in a day
or two the world will know all about it. It's going to be a case of van Ritter
and Saltburn against the rest of the world. And van Ritter will do as I like
and ask no questions. And in a year or two you will be using 'The Chantrey' for
your stables. Now don't worry yourself about me at all. Go in and win, my boy.
You've got it all your own way if I am any judge."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.&mdash;COMPENSATION.</h2>
<p>William Saltburn meant it beyond a doubt; he meant every word of it. Just
for a moment it occurred to Philip that his father was inventing this for his
own special benefit.</p>
<p>But it was impossible to look into William Saltburn's face and give him
credit for an elegant fiction of this kind. There was conviction, even in the
tone of his voice, in the way in which he carried his head and glanced about
him. He might have been some general who had turned what appeared to be a
crushing defeat into a brilliant and decisive victory.</p>
<p>"I ought to have done it before," William Saltburn said. "To tell you the
truth, Philip, I'm not quite the man I used to be. I've had one or two attacks
of nerves lately. I suppose I'm getting a bit past it. I used to laugh at that
kind of thing a year or two ago, but I don't now, and I'm getting a little
tired of the purely speculative business. Still, there are a good many years of
work in me yet. I shall enjoy this new game. We shall be on the top before
long, you see if we are not."</p>
<p>"Then you don't want Naboth's vineyard?" Philip asked.</p>
<p>"Eh, what? Oh, I see what you mean. Well, no, my boy. You can come in, of
course, if you like, and get cent. per cent. on your money, but that's a matter
for yourself. But I can't stop any longer, I've got a dozen things to scheme
out before to-morrow morning. I hope to meet Van Ritter at luncheon."</p>
<p>William Saltburn strolled off in the direction of the house, leaving Philip
grateful for the chance of being alone. He could hardly realise at first that
he was free&mdash;free to do as he liked and to carry out the golden programme
which he had laid out for himself. He had done the fair thing, he had offered
to put down everything to save his father's good name, and now the sacrifice
was not necessary, neither had it been made in vain.</p>
<p>Philip gazed about him with a curiously light heart, and with the feeling
that life was worth living. He began to take an interest again in the plans
which he had been making for many months, there were alterations here and there
which began to appeal to him once more. He was going to have them carried out
in exact accordance with Lady Edna's suggestions. Everything must be done to
please her, of course. And perhaps a little later on, when all was finished,
why&mdash;.</p>
<p>Philip smiled at himself for a visionary. Really, he was going too fast. But
when he came to ponder the thing quietly over, he could think of actually
nothing definite which Lady Edna had said to justify these sanguine feelings.
She had been very nice, and very friendly, of course, and once, well, once he
had stood with her on the terrace with his hand on hers and she had not even
murmured. The action had been a caress, in fact, but still, you never know.
And, after all, she was Lady Edna Cranwallis, and he was the son of a
discredited capitalist with a conviction recorded against him.</p>
<p>Still, she had challenged him right enough. She had told him quite plainly
that it was a question as much for the woman as for the man.</p>
<p>She had told him that if she were a man she would not have hesitated for a
moment. And all this from that white, haughty, distant beauty who had received
him so coldly at Borne Abbey only a few months ago.</p>
<p>He had been inclined to laugh at her then, he had been sufficiently amused
with those distant airs because he was a young man with dazzling fortunes, and
even greater than Lady Edna had deigned to smile on him. But he hadn't been
amused for long. Very soon there was a feeling entirely different. And then he
had thrown himself heart and soul on the side of the Cranwallises.</p>
<p>He had saved Sherringborne right enough, and he had helped Lady Edna more
than once, but she really had no idea how large a hand he had had in averting
the great catastrophe. No doubt it would have been a great asset in his favour,
but Philip had not the slightest intention of playing the game in that way.</p>
<p>He thought the whole matter carefully over as he dressed for dinner. He was
a little more fastidious in his toilet than usual. And so far as he could see,
there was only one way. He would go straightforwardly to Lady Edna and ask her
to be his wife.</p>
<p>He would take advantage of no outside circumstances, and now that he had
made up his mind to this he felt less uneasy. When he reached Borne Abbey there
was no one in the drawing-room yet besides Sherringborne and Sir James
Pallisser.</p>
<p>"We were just talking about you," the latter said as he shook hands.
"Bartram has resigned his seat. I only knew it this afternoon, and I have been
discussing it with Sherringborne. Now that you have taken up your residence in
the country, I hope you will try your hand at politics."</p>
<p>"There is nothing that would please me more," Sherringborne said. "But I'm
not quite sure that Saltburn is staying here. My daughter told me something to
the effect that he is letting the house and going abroad for a time."</p>
<p>"Well, fortunately for me, that is no longer necessary," Philip said. "You
see, I was going to help my father, but it seems that he has entered into a
great financial alliance with van Ritter of New York. After that, I hardly
dared mention my poor little quarter of a million or so. But, at any rate, Lord
Sherringborne, I am going to stay here now and settle down at 'The Chantrey.'
And I think I should like a seat in the House."</p>
<p>"Of course you would," de la Croisa explained. He had come into the room
just in time to hear the last words. "The air is full of strange rumours, my
dear fellow. I hear of schemes for the financial invasion of England by an
American army headed by your father and van Ritter. I hope you are sufficiently
an Englishman to keep out of that conglomeration."</p>
<p>"I wasn't asked to go in," Philip laughed. "And, in any case, I have had
quite enough of the money market. And now, Sir James and Lord Sherringborne are
trying to persuade me to try a hand at politics. Well, I must confess that that
is part of my programme, but I wasn't thinking of it just yet. Still, Bartram's
seat is a safe one, and if these kind friends of mine here are willing, I am
prepared to place myself in their hands."</p>
<p>De la Croisa nodded approvingly. He took an early opportunity after dinner
of taking Sherringborne aside.</p>
<p>"You've done excellently to-night," he said. "In the course of a long and
distinguished career, I don't think you ever did anything better. That young
man will go far, Sherringborne. He has ability and modesty and courage, and
besides, he is exceedingly well off. Some day he will be one of the richest men
in the kingdom. His father has made a big mistake this time, of course, but any
moneymaker who acts upon the assumption that William Saltburn is an extinct
volcano will be likely to suffer for it. In my opinion, he is putting up the
biggest financial combination in the world. Within the next twenty years Philip
Saltburn will be a power in the country. It is quite on the cards that he might
end up with a Premiership and a seat in the House of Lords. If he only marries
right that's a certainty."</p>
<p>"That's an important point," Sherringborne said thoughtfully. "I shall look
forward to that event."</p>
<p>De la Croisa screwed his glass in his eye. He looked his host up and down
with that easy audacity of his which, in most men, would have savoured of gross
impertinence.</p>
<p>"Of course you will, my dear fellow," he said. "It is, after all, the most
natural thing in the world that you should be interested in your own
son-in-law."</p>
<p>"My dear Baron," Sherringborne protested. "Well, and why not? He's a
splendid fellow. He is well enough connected, on his mother's side, at any
rate. He is rich, too, and&mdash;well to come to the point, Sherringborne, you
owe him a debt you would find it exceedingly difficult to pay."</p>
<p>"That is so," Sherringborne said gravely. "But I give you my word of honour
that I hadn't the least idea that there was anything of this kind going on
between Saltburn and my daughter."</p>
<p>"Of course you hadn't. You have been too much wrapped up in your politics
for that."</p>
<p>"But I didn't think she cared for him. I know she was excessively annoyed
the first time I asked him to stay here. We had quite an unpleasantness over
it. Still, she has told me once or twice that she has made a mistake. And, as
you say, it would be very difficult indeed to put my indebtedness to that young
man into words. But surely you don't mean to say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I don't say anything. My dear Sherringborne, I am an old man, and
perhaps I take a little too much interest in my labours. But the first time I
saw those young people together I said to my self, 'Here is an ideal couple.'
Now, I am very fond of Edna; she has been a great companion to me all these
years, and I have watched her grow from a charming child into a noble and
beautiful woman. The only fault I could see in her was that she was too proud,
too full of class prejudices."</p>
<p>"I am afraid that was a family failing," Sherringborne murmured.</p>
<p>"What she wanted was to meet the right man. And in Philip Saltburn she's
done it, or I am greatly mistaken. Oh, I don't suppose he's said a word to her
yet, and I don't suppose she realises her own feelings. But now that Philip
Saltburn has put his trouble behind him, he won't allow the grass to grow under
his feet."</p>
<p>"You think she is fond of him then?"</p>
<p>"I honestly believe she is. And Lady Shorland is sure of it. I wouldn't
stand in the way, if I were you, Sherringborne. I feel sure that Lady Edna
could do a great deal worse."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not objecting," Sherringborne said. "Only the thing has come rather
as a surprise to me. These are democratic days."</p>
<p>De la Croisa pressed the point no further. It seemed to him that he had
accomplished his purpose, and that, as far as Sherringborne was concerned,
there would be no obstacle in the way of Philip's happiness.</p>
<p>It was fortunate, perhaps, for the Baron's diplomacy that Pallisser came up
at that moment. The windows of the drawing-room were open to the terrace, and
some of the others were taking their coffee outside. Lady Shorland lay back in
the depths of her big chair with a cigarette between her lips. Shorland was
close by, a little more noisy than he had been of late. Apparently he had taken
advantage of the relaxation of discipline on his wife's part to imbibe a little
more champagne than was strictly in accordance with the usages of society. He
was not a man who drank with impunity. He was one of those weak heads to whom
wine, in any form, is fatal.</p>
<p>He appeared to be hilariously amused now. Lady Shorland lay back in her
chair and contemplated him as if he had been a sort of performing parrot, and
as if she were not quite pleased with the progress of the bird's education.</p>
<p>"It is really beyond a joke," he said in his thin, shrill voice. "Oh, hang
it, my dear girl, we must draw the line somewhere, we really must."</p>
<p>"Well, you can't have a monopoly of that sort of thing, Teddy," Lady
Shorland said quietly. "I suppose you think that the family ought to draw a
line at me."</p>
<p>"Oh, I didn't say that," Shorland protested feebly.</p>
<p>"Well, at any rate, that's what it comes to. Now you are what's called a
'Lord of Creation.' It sounds like an exquisite joke in connection with a man
like you. You must marry a dancing girl and expect her to be taken into the
family with open arms and without a word of prejudice. And when your sister
wants to marry a man whose boots you are not worthy to black, then you begin to
talk about family dignity."</p>
<p>"I shall be the head of it some day," Shorland protested.</p>
<p>"And yet, there are a great many people, whose opinions are worth having,
who seem to think that I am much too good for you. Now, I am quite
enthusiastically of the opinion myself. And I am quite sure that this sentiment
will be echoed by Baron de la Croisa who is standing behind me in the window
listening in the meanest possible way to my sweet confidences."</p>
<p>"There isn't the slightest doubt about it," the Baron said cheerfully.
"Without wishing to hurt dear Teddy's feelings for a moment, I should say that
any woman possessed of her faculties and not given to undue partiality would be
far too good for Shorland."</p>
<p>"I give it up," Shorland said feebly. "You people are too clever for me.
When you get talking like that, I don't know whether I am standing on my head
or my heels. But I ain't convinced, all the same. A man is different. He can do
as he likes. Of course, the Convict isn't a bad chap, but when it comes to his
aspiring to come into Borne Abbey and hang his hat up as one of the family,
well&mdash;there I draw the line."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.&mdash;THE PROMISED LAND.</h2>
<p>The Baron stood there listening with his head on one side, as if he were
following the rapt notes of a nightingale.</p>
<p>"Hear him talk," he murmured. "Listen to his burning eloquence. Isn't it an
inspiring sight to see Teddy Shorland posing as the guardian of the family
morality. Why, but for the grace of God and the clever little lady by your side
there would have been no family to guide by this time. Ah, my boy, you're too
big a fool to understand things, but some day, when you are older and wiser,
you will know what the Cranwallises have to thank Lady Shorland and Philip
Saltburn for."</p>
<p>Lady Shorland made a quick motion with her cigarette. From the depths of her
chair she could see that Lady Edna and Phil were coming down the terrace in
their direction. She was just too late, for Shorland broke out with a sudden
spurt of anger.</p>
<p>"I'll have nothing to do with it," he cried. "I'm going to have no convict
in my family. I don't say&mdash;"</p>
<p>De la Croisa caught the speaker savagely by the arm. From the bottom of his
heart he hoped that Lady Edna and Philip had not heard what was said.</p>
<p>But the night was very still, and Shorland's voice had a certain falsetto
note in it which always carried far.</p>
<p>In the dim light that filtered through the window de la Croisa saw Lady Edna
pull up suddenly and the murmur of her voice died on her lips. Undoubtedly
Philip had heard it too, for he dropped his hands to his sides, and came
forward swiftly. Then he seemed to control himself and waited for his companion
to join him.</p>
<p>The Baron could see that Lady Edna's face was white and set; he could see
the anger blazing in her eyes. She wore no ornaments except a shining thread of
tiny brilliants round her throat, and these seemed to rise and fall in
uncertain light, like moonlight on the summer sea.</p>
<p>And then the Baron waited for the explosion which he knew as inevitable. He
was still young enough at heart to take a certain mischievous enjoyment in the
comedy. Besides, he told himself in his pleasantly cynical fashion, that
Shorland's opposition would precipitate matters.</p>
<p>"That is an unpleasantly penetrating voice of yours, Shorland," Lady Edna
said. "You really must learn to control it. I don't suppose that a man of your
position as prospective head of the family would so far demean himself as to
apologise to a girl like me, but you certainly owe an apology to Mr.
Saltburn."</p>
<p>Shorland shook his head obstinately. As a matter of fact, he was terribly
frightened. But he had all the perverseness of the weak, and just enough sense
to know that he had placed himself in a humiliating position. What he lacked
was the necessary sense and tact to get out of it.</p>
<p>"Not me," he said. "I ain't going to apologise to the Convict. I don't mean
to be offensive, 'pon my word, I don't. But Saltburn will see for himself that
when it comes to a matter of Lady Edna Cranwallis and himself&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not another word," Lady Edna said. "This is unpardonable. It is monstrous.
And let me tell you this, Shorland, and I mean every word of it from the bottom
of my heart. The woman who marries Philip Saltburn will be the luckiest
creature in the world. And if it were I&mdash;"</p>
<p>The words were said beyond all recall. They had come, hot and spontaneous,
from Lady Edna's lips on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p>She was so entirely carried away by her feelings that she hardly realised
for the moment what she was saying. But that her heart was in it was beyond all
question.</p>
<p>Almost mechanically her hand outstretched and rested on Philip's, which lay
on the back of de la Croisa's chair. It was only the latter who, at the moment,
grasped the full meaning of the little gesture. He could see clearly enough
that Lady Edna meant it was a complete surrender. And then at last it came home
to Philip, too.</p>
<p>He turned to Lady Edna and met her eyes just for an instant, but that
instant was long enough. All the anger had died out of her face now. She
laughed unsteadily as she faced Shorland again.</p>
<p>He was learning something, too. Perhaps it occurred to him, in his muddled
way, that he had gone a bit too far.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," he said. "And a chap can't say more than that he's sorry, you
know. No business of mine, really, when I come to think of it. There are lots
of chaps who would take&mdash;well you know what I mean. Awfully hot night,
isn't it?"</p>
<p>He wiped his heated face agitatedly. Then it occurred to him as a brilliant
suggestion that exhausted nature called for a whisky and soda. And really, it
was impossible for long to be angry with such a creature.</p>
<p>That, at any rate, was the liberal-minded view which Philip took of it. It
mattered nothing to him whether Shorland meant to be offensive or not. He had
certainly precipitated matters and told Philip what he had been aching to know
for the last hour or two. Lady Edna was laughing and blushing now. She deemed
to have cast aside all her haughtiness and reserve.</p>
<p>"Don't let him have any more," she said. "I'm sure he's had quite enough
already."</p>
<p>"I think you can leave that to me," Lady Shorland said composedly. "When I
take Teddy in hand I shall do it effectually. You see, this is really an
exceptional occasion. These great things don't happen every night. And now let
me be one of the first to congratulate you, Mr. Saltburn."</p>
<p>"On what?" Philip asked.</p>
<p>"Well, really, I don't know where to begin first," Lady Shorland laughed.
"To begin with, I am glad to find that there is no chance of your leaving the
neighbourhood. Oh! I know a great deal more about these matters than you are
aware of. Why, it was I who brought your father and van Ritter together. But I
daresay your father has told you that. Really, you've got nothing to thank me
for."</p>
<p>"It seems to me that I have to thank everybody for everything," Philip said
joyfully. "It has made a great deal of difference to me. I don't believe
anybody realises how much difference it has made to me."</p>
<p>"Lady Edna does," Lady Shorland said demurely.</p>
<p>Lady Edna blushed to the roots of her hair, but she said nothing. Strangely
enough she seemed to be the most confused and uneasy of the little party. It
was de la Croisa, as usual, who came to the rescue.</p>
<p>"Everything has been arranged," he said gaily. "We are not going to lose
Saltburn; on the contrary, he is going to have a fresh stake in the country.
When Bartram resigns our young friend here is going to take his place. Both
Sherringborne and Sir James are of the same opinion as myself, that we couldn't
get a better man."</p>
<p>"Is that really so?" Lady Shorland asked. "Well, I am delighted to hear it.
If you don't mind I think I'll go in and see that Shorland isn't getting into
mischief."</p>
<p>She turned away, discreetly followed by the Baron. Lady Edna would have
followed too, only Philip held out an audacious hand and restrained her. He was
not feeling in the least nervous or doubtful now.</p>
<p>"Stop," he said. "We came here on purpose to talk of certain matters. There
is much I had to say. Now, on the contrary, there is very little I have to
say."</p>
<p>There was silence just for a moment. Lady Edna was the first to break it.
She turned to Philip almost passionately.</p>
<p>"What must you think of me?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Think of you, my dearest? Oh, surely you know what I have thought of you
from the very first?"</p>
<p>"But after to-night. After the way I spoke? I must have completely forgotten
myself."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you didn't. You forgot your mantle of reserve and dignity, and for
once you were a natural woman. Surely I understand your feelings. You were
ablaze to see a guest insulted in that way. You would have done the same for
anyone. It was nice for me to hear you say that any woman would be lucky who
called herself Mrs. Philip Saltburn. And think how lucky Philip Saltburn was to
hear the only woman in the world he has ever cared for speak like that in his
hearing. Think how easy it makes it for me. When I came here to-night I was
almost afraid of what your reply might be. But I am not afraid now. Why should
I be?"</p>
<p>"Why indeed?" Lady Edna murmured softly. "Do you think it possible to be two
different women?"</p>
<p>"I think it possible to be half a dozen," Philip replied.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't quite mean that, Philip. I mean is it possible for a woman to
change utterly in a few months? What a hateful creature I must have been when
you first met me."</p>
<p>"You were nothing of the sort," Philip protested. "You were just as sweet
and charming then as you are now. Only, you see, your whole existence was bound
up in Borne Abbey and your father and the contemplation of the family
greatness. You didn't realise then how purely human we all are, and how the
greatest of us are likely to make, mistakes at times. But if you could only
have seen yourself to-night&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't want to think of it," Lady Edna whispered. "I want you to try to
forget it also."</p>
<p>"Forget it. Why should I forget it? Why, it will always be one of my most
cherished memories. A beautiful picture in a beautiful setting. And the whole
atmosphere faint with the smell of narcissus. Surely you don't want the man you
mean to marry to forget the moment when you stood before the world and told
everybody that you had found your happiness, and crowned my own?"</p>
<p>Lady Edna smiled into the speaker's face. She had lost all her confusion
now, and her eyes were shining with happiness which she made no attempt to
conceal.</p>
<p>"I haven't said so," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Of course not, my darling. Mere words of that kind would spoil everything.
And so, after all, you are going to marry the son of a man who started life in
the kitchen of Borne Abbey. It is a terrible comedown for a Cranwallis."</p>
<p>Lady Edna laid her hand upon his arm.</p>
<p>"I am going to do nothing of the kind," she said. "I know nothing of the man
who started life in the kitchen of Borne Abbey, and I care less. All I know is
that Philip Saltburn has asked me to be his wife, and I believe I have been in
love with him from the very day we first met...well, at any rate, I am quite
sure I fell in love with him the night that Shorland behaved so badly after he
had come to our assistance in keeping those wretched people out of the house.
But, all the same, that didn't prevent me from behaving very foolishly.
Still&mdash;"</p>
<p>She held her hands out to Saltburn, who took them in his, and drew her to
his side. And with that the last drop of pride in her heart was fused like a
pearl.</p>
