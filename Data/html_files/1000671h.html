      The large and rather comfortable apartment of Rufus
      Haymaker, architect, in Central Park West, was very silent.
      It was scarcely dawn yet, and at the edge of the park, over
      the way, looking out from the front windows which graced
      this abode and gave it its charm, a stately line of poplars
      was still shrouded in a gray morning mist. From his bedroom
      at one end of the hall, where, also, a glimpse of the park
      was to be had, came Mr. Haymaker at this early hour to sit
      by one of these broader windows and contemplate these trees
      and a small lake beyond. He was very fond of Nature in its
      manifold art forms--quite poetic, in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall and spare man of about sixty, not ungraceful,
      though slightly stoop-shouldered, with heavy overhanging
      eyebrows and hair, and a short, professionally cut gray
      mustache and beard, which gave him a severe and yet
      agreeable presence. For the present he was clad in a
      light-blue dressing gown with silver cords, which enveloped
      him completely. He had thin, pale, long-fingered hands,
      wrinkled at the back and slightly knotted at the joints,
      which bespoke the artist, in mood at least, and his eyes
      had a weary and yet restless look in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For only yesterday Doctor Storm, the family physician, who
      was in attendance on his wife, ill now for these three
      weeks past with a combination of heart lesion, kidney
      poisoning and neuritis, had taken him aside and said very
      softly and affectionately, as though he were trying to
      spare his feelings: "To-morrow, Mr. Haymaker, if your wife
      is no better I will call in my friend, Doctor Grainger,
      whom you know, for a consultation. He is more of an expert
      in these matters of the heart"--the heart, Mr. Haymaker had
      time to note ironically--"than I am. Together we will make
      a thorough examination, and then I hope we will be better
      able to say what the possibilities of her recovery really
      are. It's been a very trying case, a very stubborn one, I
      might say. Still, she has a great deal of vitality and is
      doing as well as could be expected, all things considered.
      At the same time, though I don't wish to alarm you
      unnecessarily--and there is no occasion for great alarm
      yet--still I feel it my duty to warn you that her condition
      is very serious indeed. Not that I wish you to feel that
      she is certain to die. I don't think she is. Not at all.
      Just the contrary. She may get well, and probably will, and
      live all of twenty years more." (Mentally Mr. Haymaker
      sighed a purely spiritual sigh.) "She has fine recuperative
      powers, so far as I can judge, but she has a bad heart, and
      this kidney trouble has not helped it any. Just now, when
      her heart should have the least strain, it has the most.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is just at that point where, as I may say, things are
      in the balance. A day or two, or three or four at the most,
      ought to show which way things will go. But, as I have said
      before, I do not wish to alarm you unnecessarily. We are
      not nearly at the end of our tether. We haven't tried blood
      transfusion yet, and there are several arrows to that bow.
      Besides, at any moment she may respond more vigorously to
      medication than she has heretofore--especially in
      connection with her kidneys. In that case the situation
      would be greatly relieved at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However, as I say, I feel it my duty to speak to you in
      this way in order that you may be mentally prepared for any
      event, because in such an odd combination as this the worst
      may happen at any time. We never can tell. As an old friend
      of yours and Mrs. Haymaker's, and knowing how much you two
      mean to each other"--Mr. Haymaker merely stared at him
      vacantly--"I feel it my duty to prepare you in this way. We
      all of us have to face these things. Only last year I lost
      my dear Matilda, my youngest child, as you know. Just the
      same, as I say, I have the feeling that Mrs. Haymaker is
      not really likely to die soon, and that we--Doctor Grainger
      and myself--will still be able to pull her through. I
      really do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Storm looked at Mr. Haymaker as though he were very
      sorry for him--an old man long accustomed to his wife's
      ways and likely to be made very unhappy by her untimely
      end; whereas Mr. Haymaker, though staring in an almost
      sculptural way, was really thinking what a farce it all
      was, what a dull mixture of error and illusion on the part
      of all. Here he was, sixty years of age, weary of all this,
      of life really--a man who had never been really happy in
      all the time that he had been married; and yet here was his
      wife, who from conventional reasons believed that he was or
      should be, and who on account of this was serenely happy
      herself, or nearly so. And this doctor, who imagined that
      he was old and weak and therefore in need of this loving
      woman's care and sympathy and understanding! Unconsciously
      he raised a deprecating hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also his children, who thought him dependent on her and
      happy with her; his servants and her and his friends
      thinking the same thing, and yet he really was not. It was
      all a lie. He was unhappy. Always he had been unhappy, it
      seemed, ever since he had been married--for over thirty-one
      years now. Never in all that time, for even so much as a
      single day, had he ever done anything but long, long, long,
      in a pale, constrained way--for what, he scarcely dared
      think--not to be married any more--to be free--to be as he
      was before ever he saw Mrs. Haymaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet being conventional in mood and training and utterly
      domesticated by time and conditions over which he seemed
      not to have much control--nature, custom, public opinion,
      and the like, coming into play as forces--he had drifted,
      had not taken any drastic action. No, he had merely
      drifted, wondering if time, accident or something might not
      interfere and straighten out his life for him, but it never
      had. Now weary, old, or rapidly becoming so, he condemned
      himself for his inaction. Why hadn't he done something
      about it years before? Why hadn't he broken it up before it
      was too late, and saved his own soul, his longing for life,
      color? But no, he had not. Why complain so bitterly now?
    </p>
    <p>
      All the time the doctor had talked this day before he had
      wanted to smile a wry, dry, cynical smile, for in reality
      he did not want Mrs. Haymaker to live--or at least at the
      moment he thought so. He was too miserably tired of it all.
      And so now, after nearly twenty-four hours of the same
      unhappy thought, sitting by this window looking at a not
      distant building which shone faintly in the haze, he ran
      his fingers through his hair as he gazed, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      How often in these weary months, and even years, past--ever
      since he and his wife had been living here, and before--had
      he come to these or similar windows while she was still
      asleep, to sit and dream! For some years now they had not
      even roomed together, so indifferent had the whole state
      become; though she did not seem to consider that
      significant, either. Life had become more or less of a
      practical problem to her, one of position, place, prestige.
      And yet how often, viewing his life in retrospect, had he
      wished that his life had been as sweet as his dreams--that
      his dreams had come true.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time on this early morning, for it was still gray,
      with the faintest touch of pink in the east, he shook his
      head solemnly and sadly, then rose and returned along the
      hall to his wife's bedroom, at the door of which he paused
      to look where she lay seriously ill, and beside her in an
      armchair, fast asleep, a trained nurse who was supposedly
      keeping the night vigil ordered by the doctor, but who no
      doubt was now very weary. His wife was sleeping also--very
      pale, very thin now, and very weak. He felt sorry for her
      at times, in spite of his own weariness; now, for instance.
      Why need he have made so great a mistake so long ago?
      Perhaps it was his own fault for not having been wiser in
      his youth. Then he went quietly on to his own room, to lie
      down and think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always these days, now that she was so very ill and the
      problem of her living was so very acute, the creeping dawn
      thus roused him--to think. It seemed as though he could not
      really sleep soundly any more, so stirred and distrait was
      he. He was not so much tired or physically worn as mentally
      bored or disappointed. Life had treated him so badly, he
      kept thinking to himself over and over. He had never had
      the woman he really wanted, though he had been married so
      long, had been faithful, respectable and loved by her, in
      her way. "In her way," he half quoted to himself as he lay
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he would get up, dress and go down to his office
      as usual if his wife were not worse. But--but, he asked
      himself--would she be? Would that slim and yet so durable
      organism of hers--quite as old as his own, or nearly
      so--break under the strain of this really severe illness?
      That would set him free again, and nicely, without blame or
      comment on him. He could then go where he chose once more,
      do as he pleased--think of that--without let or hindrance.
      For she was ill at last, so very ill, the first and really
      great illness she had endured since their marriage. For
      weeks now she had been lying so, hovering, as it were,
      between life and death, one day better, the next day worse,
      and yet not dying, and with no certainty that she would,
      and yet not getting better either. Doctor Storm insisted
      that it was a leak in her heart which had suddenly
      manifested itself which was causing all the real trouble.
      He was apparently greatly troubled as to how to control it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this period Mr. Haymaker had been, as usual,
      most sympathetic. His manner toward her was always soft,
      kindly, apparently tender. He had never really begrudged
      her anything--nothing certainly that he could afford. He
      was always glad to see her and the children humanly
      happy--though they, too, largely on account of her, he
      thought, had proved a disappointment to him--because he had
      always sympathized with her somewhat unhappy youth, narrow
      and stinted; and yet he had never been happy himself,
      either, never in all the time that he had been married. If
      she had endured much, he kept telling himself when he was
      most unhappy, so had he, only it was harder perhaps for
      women to endure things than men--he was always willing to
      admit that--only also she had had his love, or thought she
      had, an actual spiritual peace, which he had never had. She
      knew she had a faithful husband. He felt that he had never
      really had a wife at all, not one that he could love as he
      knew a wife should be loved. His dreams as to that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Going to his office later this same day--it was in one of
      those tall buildings that face Madison Square--he had
      looked first, in passing, at the trees that line Central
      Park West, and then at the bright wall of apartment houses
      facing it, and meditated sadly, heavily. Here the sidewalks
      were crowded with nursemaids and children at play, and in
      between them, of course, the occasional citizen loitering
      or going about his errands. The day was so fine, so
      youthful, as spring days will seem at times. As he looked,
      especially at the children, and the young men bustling
      office-ward, mostly in new spring suits, he sighed and
      wished that he were young once more. Think how brisk and
      hopeful they were! Everything was before them. They could
      still pick and choose--no age or established conditions to
      stay them. Were any of them, he asked himself for the
      thousandth time, it seemed to him, as wearily connected as
      he had been at their age? Did they each have a charming
      young wife to love--one of whom they were passionately
      fond--such a one as he had never had; or did they not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondering, he reached his office on one of the topmost
      floors of one of those highest buildings commanding a wide
      view of the city, and surveyed it wearily. Here were
      visible the two great rivers of the city, its towers and
      spires and far-flung walls. From these sometimes, even yet,
      he seemed to gain a patience to live, to hope. How in his
      youth all this had inspired him--or that other city that
      was then. Even now he was always at peace here, so much
      more so than in his own home, pleasant as it was. Here he
      could look out over this great scene and dream or he could
      lose the memory in his work that his love-life had been a
      failure. The great city, the buildings he could plan or
      supervise, the efficient help that always surrounded
      him--his help, not hers--aided to take his mind off himself
      and that deep-seated inner ache or loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The care of Mr. Haymaker's apartment during his wife's
      illness and his present absence throughout the day,
      devolved upon a middle-aged woman of great seriousness,
      Mrs. Elfridge by name, whom Mrs. Haymaker had employed
      years before; and under her a maid of all work, Hester, who
      waited on table, opened the door, and the like; and also at
      present two trained nurses, one for night and one for day
      service, who were in charge of Mrs. Haymaker. The nurses
      were both bright, healthy, blue-eyed girls, who attracted
      Mr. Haymaker and suggested all the youth he had never
      had--without really disturbing his poise. It would seem as
      though that could never be any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, of course, there was the loving interest of
      his son Wesley and his daughter Ethelberta--whom his wife
      had named so in spite of him--both of whom had long since
      married and had children of their own and were living in
      different parts of the great city. In this crisis both of
      them came daily to learn how things were, and occasionally
      to stay for the entire afternoon or evening, or both.
      Ethelberta had wanted to come and take charge of the
      apartment entirely during her mother's illness, only Mrs.
      Haymaker, who was still able to direct, and fond of doing
      so, would not hear of it. She was not so ill but that she
      could still speak, and in this way could inquire and
      direct. Besides, Mrs. Elfridge was as good as Mrs. Haymaker
      in all things that related to Mr. Haymaker's physical
      comfort, or so she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the truth will come out--as it will in so many pathetic
      cases--it was never his physical so much as his spiritual
      or affectional comfort that Mr. Haymaker craved. As said
      before, he had never loved Mrs. Haymaker, or certainly not
      since that now long-distant period back in Muskegon,
      Michigan, where both had been born and where they had lived
      and met at the ages, she of fifteen, he of seventeen. It
      had been, strange as it might seem now, a love match at
      first sight with them. She had seemed so sweet, a girl of
      his own age or a little younger, the daughter of a local
      chemist. Later, when he had been forced by poverty to go
      out into the world to make his own way, he had written her
      much, and imagined her to be all that she had seemed at
      fifteen, and more--a dream among fair women. But Fortune,
      slow in coming to his aid and fickle in fulfilling his
      dreams, had brought it about that for several years more he
      had been compelled to stay away nearly all of the time,
      unable to marry her; during which period, unknown to
      himself really, his own point of view had altered. How it
      had happened he could never tell really, but so it was. The
      great city, larger experiences--while she was still
      enduring the smaller ones--other faces, dreams of larger
      things, had all combined to destroy it or her, only he had
      not quite realized it then. He was always so slow in
      realizing the full import of the immediate thing, he
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the time, as he had afterward told himself--how
      often!--that he should have discovered his mistake and
      stopped. Later it always seemed to become more and more
      impossible. Then, in spite of some heartache to her and
      some distress to himself, no doubt, all would be well for
      him now. But no; he had been too inexperienced, too
      ignorant, too bound by all the conventions and punctilio of
      his simple Western world. He thought an engagement, however
      unsatisfactory it might come to seem afterward, was an
      engagement, and binding. An honorable man would not break
      one--or so his country moralists argued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, at that time he might have written her, he might have
      told her, then. But he had been too sensitive and kindly to
      speak of it. Afterward it was too late. He feared to wound
      her, to undo her, to undo her life. But now--now--look at
      his! He had gone back on several occasions before marriage,
      and might have seen and done and been free if he had had
      but courage and wisdom--but no; duty, order, the beliefs of
      the region in which he had been reared, and of
      America--what it expected and what she expected and was
      entitled to--had done for him completely. He had not
      spoken. Instead, he had gone on and married her without
      speaking of the change in himself, without letting her know
      how worse than ashes it had all become. God, what a fool he
      had been! how often since he had told himself over and
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, having made a mistake it was his duty perhaps, at
      least according to current beliefs, to stick by it and make
      the best of it;--a bargain was a bargain in marriage, if no
      where else--but still that had never prevented him from
      being unhappy. He could not prevent that himself. During
      all these long years, therefore, owing to these same
      conventions--what people would think and say--he had been
      compelled to live with her, to cherish her, to pretend to
      be happy with her--"another perfect union," as he sometimes
      said to himself. In reality he had been unhappy, horribly
      so. Even her face wearied him at times, and her presence,
      her mannerisms. Only this other morning Doctor Storm, by
      his manner indicating that he thought him lonely, in danger
      of being left all alone and desperately sad and neglected
      in case she died had irritated him greatly. Who would take
      care of him? his eyes had seemed to say--and yet he himself
      wanted nothing so much as to be alone for a time, at least,
      in this life, to think for himself, to do for himself, to
      forget this long, dreary period in which he had pretended
      to be something that he was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he never to be rid of the dull round of it, he asked
      himself now, never before he himself died? And yet shortly
      afterward he would reproach himself for these very
      thoughts, as being wrong, hard, unkind--thoughts that would
      certainly condemn him in the eyes of the general public,
      that public which made reputations and one's general
      standing before the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this time he had never even let her know--no,
      not once--of the tremendous and soul-crushing sacrifice he
      had made. Like the Spartan boy, he had concealed the fox
      gnawing at his vitals. He had not complained. He had been,
      indeed, the model husband, as such things go in
      conventional walks. If you doubted it look at his position,
      or that of his children; or his wife--her mental and
      physical comfort, even in her illness, her unfailing belief
      that he was all he should be! Never once apparently, during
      all these years, had she doubted his love or felt him to be
      unduly unhappy--or, if not that exactly, if not fully
      accepting his love as something that was still at a fever
      heat, the thing it once was--still believing that he found
      pleasure and happiness in being with her, a part of the
      home which together they had built up, these children they
      had reared, comfort in knowing that it would endure to the
      end! To the end! During all these years she had gone on
      molding his and her lives--as much as that was possible in
      his case--and those of their children, to suit herself; and
      thinking all the time that she was doing what he wanted or
      at least what was best for him and them.
    </p>
    <p>
      How she adored convention! What did she not think she knew
      in regard to how things ought to be--mainly what her old
      home surroundings had taught her, the American idea of
      this, that and the other. Her theories in regard to
      friends, education of the children, and so on, had in the
      main prevailed, even when he did not quite agree with her;
      her desires for certain types of pleasure and amusement, of
      companionship, and so on, were conventional types always
      and had also prevailed. There had been little quarrels, of
      course, always had been--what happy home is free of
      them?--but still he had always given in, or nearly always,
      and had acted as though he were satisfied in so doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why, therefore, should he complain now, or she ever
      imagine, or ever have imagined, that he was unhappy? She
      did not, had not. Like all their relatives and friends of
      the region from which they sprang, and here also--and she
      had been most careful to regulate that, courting whom she
      pleased and ignoring all others--she still believed most
      firmly, more so than ever, that she knew what was best for
      him, what he really thought and wanted. It made him smile
      most wearily at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in her eyes--in regard to him, at least, not always so
      with others, he had found--marriage was a sacrament,
      sacrosanct, never to be dissolved. One life, one love. Once
      a man had accepted the yoke or even asked a girl to marry
      him it was his duty to abide by it. To break an engagement,
      to be unfaithful to a wife, even unkind to her--what a
      crime, in her eyes! Such people ought to be drummed out of
      the world. They were really not fit to live--dogs, brutes!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, look at himself--what of him? What of one who had
      made a mistake in regard to all this? Where was his
      compensation to come from, his peace and happiness? Here on
      earth or only in some mythical heaven--that odd, angelic
      heaven that she still believed in? What a farce! And all
      her friends and his would think he would be so miserable
      now if she died, or at least ought to be. So far had
      asinine convention and belief in custom carried the world.
      Think of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      But even that was not the worst. No; that was not the
      worst, either. It had been the gradual realization coming
      along through the years that he had married an essentially
      small, narrow woman who could never really grasp his point
      of view--or, rather, the significance of his dreams or
      emotions--and yet with whom, nevertheless, because of this
      original promise or mistake, he was compelled to live.
      Grant her every quality of goodness, energy, industry,
      intent--as he did freely--still there was this; and it
      could never be adjusted, never. Essentially, as he had long
      since discovered, she was narrow, ultraconventional,
      whereas he was an artist by nature, brooding and dreaming
      strange dreams and thinking of far-off things which she did
      not or could not understand or did not sympathize with,
      save in a general and very remote way. The nuances of his
      craft, the wonders and subtleties of forms and angles--had
      she ever realized how significant these were to him, let
      alone to herself? No, never. She had not the least true
      appreciation of them--never had had. Architecture? Art?
      What could they really mean to her, desire as she might to
      appreciate them? And he could not now go elsewhere to
      discover that sympathy. No. He had never really wanted to,
      since the public and she would object, and he thinking it
      half evil himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, how was it, he often asked himself, that Nature
      could thus allow one conditioned or equipped with emotions
      and seekings such as his, not of an utterly conventional
      order, to seek out and pursue one like Ernestine, who was
      not fitted to understand him or to care what his personal
      moods might be? Was love truly blind, as the old saw
      insisted, or did Nature really plan, and cleverly, to
      torture the artist mind--as it did the pearl-bearing oyster
      with a grain of sand--with something seemingly inimical, in
      order that it might produce beauty? Sometimes he thought
      so. Perhaps the many interesting and beautiful buildings he
      had planned--the world called them so, at least--had been
      due to the loving care he lavished on them, being shut out
      from love and beauty elsewhere. Cruel Nature, that cared so
      little for the dreams of man--the individual man or woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time he had married Ernestine he was really too
      young to know exactly what it was he wanted to do or how it
      was he was going to feel in the years to come; and yet
      there was no one to guide him, to stop him. The custom of
      the time was all in favor of this dread disaster. Nature
      herself seemed to desire it--mere children being the be-all
      and the end-all of everything everywhere. Think of that as
      a theory! Later, when it became so clear to him what he had
      done, and in spite of all the conventional thoughts and
      conditions that seemed to bind him to this fixed condition,
      he had grown restless and weary, but never really
      irritable. No, he had never become that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead he had concealed it all from her, persistently, in
      all kindness; only this hankering after beauty of mind and
      body in ways not represented by her had hurt so--grown
      finally almost too painful to bear. He had dreamed and
      dreamed of something different until it had become almost
      an obsession. Was it never to be, that something different,
      never, anywhere, in all time? What a tragedy! Soon he would
      be dead and then it would never be anywhere--anymore!
      Ernestine was charming, he would admit, or had been at
      first, though time had proved that she was not charming to
      him either mentally or physically in any compelling way;
      but how did that help him now? How could it? He had
      actually found himself bored by her for more than
      twenty-seven years now, and this other dream growing,
      growing, growing--until--
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he was old, and she was dying, or might be, and it
      could not make so much difference what happened to him or
      to her; only it could, too, because he wanted to be free
      for a little while, just for a little while, before he
      died.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be free! free!
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the things that had always irritated him about Mrs.
      Haymaker was this, that in spite of his determination never
      to offend the social code in any way--he had felt for so
      many reasons, emotional as well as practical, that he could
      not afford so to do--and also in spite of the fact that he
      had been tortured by this show of beauty in the eyes and
      bodies of others, his wife, fearing perhaps in some strange
      psychic way that he might change, had always tried to make
      him feel or believe--premeditatedly and of a purpose, he
      thought--that he was not the kind of man who would be
      attractive to women; that he lacked some physical fitness,
      some charm that other men had, which would cause all young
      and really charming women to turn away from him. Think of
      it! He to whom so many women had turned with questioning
      eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also that she had married him largely because she had felt
      sorry for him! He chose to let her believe that, because he
      was sorry for her. Because other women had seemed to draw
      near to him at times in some appealing or seductive way she
      had insisted that he was not even a cavalier, let alone a
      Lothario; that he was ungainly, slow, uninteresting--to all
      women but her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Persistently, he thought, and without any real need, she
      had harped on this, fighting chimeras, a chance danger in
      the future; though he had never given her any real reason,
      and had never even planned to sin against her in any
      way--never. She had thus tried to poison his own mind in
      regard to himself and his art--and yet--and yet-- Ah, those
      eyes of other women, their haunting beauty, the flitting
      something they said to him of infinite, inexpressible
      delight. Why had his life been so very hard?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the disturbing things about all this was the iron
      truth which it had driven home, namely, that Nature, unless
      it were expressed or represented by some fierce
      determination within, which drove one to do, be, cared no
      whit for him or any other man or woman. Unless one acted
      for oneself, upon some stern conclusion nurtured within,
      one might rot and die spiritually. Nature did not care.
      "Blessed be the meek"--yes. Blessed be the strong, rather,
      for they made their own happiness. All these years in which
      he had dwelt and worked in this knowledge, hoping for
      something but not acting, nothing had happened, except to
      him, and that in an unsatisfactory way. All along he had
      seen what was happening to him; and yet held by convention
      he had refused to act always, because somehow he was not
      hard enough to act. He was not strong enough, that was the
      real truth--had not been. Almost like a bird in a cage, an
      animal peeping out from behind bars, he had viewed the
      world of free thought and freer action. In many a
      drawing-room, on the street, or in his own home even, had
      he not looked into an eye, the face of someone who seemed
      to offer understanding, to know, to sympathize, though she
      might not have, of course; and yet religiously and
      moralistically, like an anchorite, because of duty and
      current belief and what people would say and think,
      Ernestine's position and faith in him, her comfort, his
      career and that of the children--he had put them all aside,
      out of his mind, forgotten them almost, as best he might.
      It had been hard at times, and sad, but so it had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      And look at him now, old, not exactly feeble yet--no, not
      that yet, not quite!--but life weary and almost indifferent
      All these years he had wanted, wanted--wanted--an
      understanding mind, a tender heart, the some one woman--she
      must exist somewhere--who would have sympathized with all
      the delicate shades and meanings of his own character, his
      art, his spiritual as well as his material dreams-- And yet
      look at him! Mrs. Haymaker had always been with him,
      present in the flesh or the spirit, and--so--
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he could not ever say that she was disagreeable to
      him in a material way--he could not say that she had ever
      been that exactly--still she did not correspond to his idea
      of what he needed, and so-- Form had meant so much to him,
      color; the glorious perfectness of a glorious woman's body,
      for instance, the color of her thoughts, moods--exquisite
      they must be, like his own at times; but no, he had never
      had the opportunity to know one intimately. No, not one,
      though he had dreamed of her so long. He had never even
      dared whisper this to any one, scarcely to himself. It was
      not wise, not socially fit. Thoughts like this would tend
      to social ostracism in his circle, or rather hers--for had
      she not made the circle?
    </p>
    <p>
      And here was the rub with Mr. Haymaker, at least, that he
      could not make up his mind whether in his restlessness and
      private mental complaints he were not even now guilty of a
      great moral crime in so thinking. Was it not true that men
      and women should be faithful in marriage whether they were
      happy or not? Was there not some psychic law governing this
      matter of union--one life, one love--which made the
      thoughts and the pains and the subsequent sufferings and
      hardships of the individual, whatever they might be, seem
      unimportant? The churches said so. Public opinion and the
      law seemed to accept this. There were so many problems, so
      much order to be disrupted, so much pain caused, many
      insoluble problems where children were concerned--if people
      did not stick. Was it not best, more blessed--socially,
      morally, and in every other way important--for him to stand
      by a bad bargain rather than to cause so much disorder and
      pain, even though he lost his own soul emotionally? He had
      thought so--or at least he had acted as though he thought
      so--and yet-- How often had he wondered over this!
    </p>
    <p>
      Take, now, some other phases. Granting first that Mrs.
      Haymaker had, according to the current code, measured up to
      the requirements of a wife, good and true, and that at
      first after marriage there had been just enough of physical
      and social charm about her to keep his state from becoming
      intolerable, still there was this old ache; and then newer
      things which came with the birth of the several children:
      First Elwell--named after a cousin of hers, not his--who
      had died only two years after he was born; and then Wesley;
      and then Ethelberta. How he had always disliked that
      name!--largely because he had hoped to call her Ottilie, a
      favorite name of his; or Janet, after his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously the arrival of these children and the death of
      poor little Elwell at two had somehow, in spite of his
      unrest, bound him to this matrimonial state and filled him
      with a sense of duty, and pleasure even--almost entirely
      apart from her, he was sorry to say--in these young lives;
      though if there had not been children, as he sometimes told
      himself, he surely would have broken away from her; he
      could not have stood it. They were so odd in their infancy,
      those little ones, so troublesome and yet so
      amusing--little Elwell, for instance, whose nose used to
      crinkle with delight when he would pretend to bite his
      neck, and whose gurgle of pleasure was so sweet and
      heart-filling that it positively thrilled and lured him. In
      spite of his thoughts concerning Ernestine--and always in
      those days they were rigidly put down as unmoral and even
      evil, a certain unsocial streak in him perhaps which was
      against law and order and social well-being--he came to
      have a deep and abiding feeling for Elwell. The latter, in
      some chemic, almost unconscious way, seemed to have arrived
      as a balm to his misery, a bandage for his growing
      wound--sent by whom, by what, how? Elwell had seized upon
      his imagination, and so his heartstrings--had come, indeed,
      to make him feel understanding and sympathy there in that
      little child; to supply, or seem to at least, what he
      lacked in the way of love and affection from one whom he
      could truly love. Elwell was never so happy apparently as
      when snuggling in his arms, not Ernestine's, or lying
      against his neck. And when he went for a walk or elsewhere
      there was Elwell always ready, arms up, to cling to his
      neck. He seemed, strangely enough, inordinately fond of his
      father, rather than his mother, and never happy without
      him. On his part, Haymaker came to be wildly fond of
      him--that queer little lump of a face, suggesting a little
      of himself and of his own mother, not so much of Ernestine,
      or so he thought, though he would not have objected to
      that. Not at all. He was not so small as that. Toward the
      end of the second year, when Elwell was just beginning to
      be able to utter a word or two, he had taught him that
      silly old rhyme which ran "There were three kittens," and
      when it came to "and they shall have no--" he would stop
      and say to Elwell, "What now?" and the latter would gurgle
      "puh!"--meaning, of course, pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, those happy days with little Elwell, those walks with
      him over his shoulder or on his arm, those hours in which
      of an evening he would rock him to sleep in his arms!
      Always Ernestine was there, and happy in the thought of his
      love for little Elwell and her, her more than anything else
      perhaps; but it was an illusion--that latter part. He did
      not care for her even then as she thought he did. All his
      fondness was for Elwell, only she took it as evidence of
      his growing or enduring affection for her--another evidence
      of the peculiar working of her mind. Women were like that,
      he supposed--some women.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came that dreadful fever, due to some invading
      microbe which the doctors could not diagnose or isolate,
      infantile paralysis perhaps; and little Elwell had finally
      ceased to be as flesh and was eventually carried forth to
      the lorn, disagreeable graveyard near Woodlawn. How he had
      groaned internally, indulged in sad, despondent thoughts
      concerning the futility of all things human, when this had
      happened! It seemed for the time being as if all color and
      beauty had really gone out of his life for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man born of woman is of few days and full of troubles,"
      the preacher whom Mrs. Haymaker had insisted upon having
      into the house at the time of the funeral had read. "He
      fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; so little Elwell had fled, as a shadow, and in his own
      deep sorrow at the time he had come to feel the first and
      only sad, deep sympathy for Ernestine that he had ever felt
      since marriage; and that because she had suffered so
      much--had lain in his arms after the funeral and cried so
      bitterly. It was terrible, her sorrow. Terrible--a mother
      grieving for her first-born! Why was it, he had thought at
      the time, that he had never been able to think or make her
      all she ought to be to him? Ernestine at this time had
      seemed better, softer, kinder, wiser, sweeter than she had
      ever seemed; more worthy, more interesting than ever he had
      thought her before. She had slaved so during the child's
      illness, stayed awake night after night, watched over him
      with such loving care--done everything, in short, that a
      loving human heart could do to rescue her young from the
      depths; and yet even then he had not really been able to
      love her. No, sad and unkind as it might seem, he had not.
      He had just pitied her and thought her better, worthier!
      What cursed stars disordered the minds and moods of people
      so? Why was it that these virtues of people, their good
      qualities, did not make you love them, did not really bind
      them to you, as against the things you could not like? Why?
      He had resolved to do better in his thoughts, but somehow,
      in spite of himself, he had never been able so to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, at that time he seemed to realize more keenly
      than ever her order, industry, frugality, a sense of beauty
      within limits, a certain laudable ambition to do something
      and be somebody--only, only he could not sympathize with
      her ambitions, could not see that she had anything but a
      hopelessly common-place and always unimportant point of
      view. There was never any flare to her, never any true
      distinction of mind or soul. She seemed always, in spite of
      anything he might say or do, hopelessly to identify doing
      and being with money and current opinion--neighborhood
      public opinion, almost--and local social position, whereas
      he knew that distinguished doing might as well be connected
      with poverty and shame and disgrace as with these other
      things--wealth and station, for instance; a thing which she
      could never quite understand apparently, though he often
      tried to tell her, much against her mood always.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at the cases of the great artists! Some of the
      greatest architects right here in the city, or in history,
      were of peculiar, almost disagreeable, history. But no,
      Mrs. Haymaker could not understand anything like that,
      anything connected with history, indeed--she hardly
      believed in history, its dark, sad pages, and would never
      read it, or at least did not care to. And as for art and
      artists--she would never have believed that wisdom and art
      understanding and true distinction might take their rise
      out of things necessarily low and evil--never.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take now, the case of young Zingara. Zingara was an
      architect like himself, whom he had met more than thirty
      years before, here in New York, when he had first arrived,
      a young man struggling to become an architect of
      significance, only he was very poor and rather unkempt and
      disreputable-looking. Haymaker had found him several years
      before his marriage to Ernestine in the dark offices of
      Pyne &amp; Starboard, Architects, and had been drawn to him
      definitely; but because he smoked all the time and was
      shabby as to his clothes and had no money--why, Mrs.
      Haymaker, after he had married her, and though he had known
      Zingara nearly four years, would have none of him. To her
      he was low, and a failure, one who would never succeed.
      Once she had seen him in some cheap restaurant that she
      chanced to be passing, in company with a drabby-looking
      maid, and that was the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you wouldn't bring him here any more, dear," she
      had insisted; and to have peace he had complied--only, now
      look. Zingara had since become a great architect, but now
      of course, owing to Mrs. Haymaker, he was definitely
      alienated. He was the man who had since designed the
      &AElig;sculapian Club; and Symphony Hall with its delicate
      fa&ccedil;ade; as well as the tower of the Wells Building, sending
      its sweet lines so high, like a poetic thought or dream.
      But Zingara was now a dreamy recluse like himself, very
      exclusive, as Haymaker had long since come to know, and
      indifferent as to what people thought or said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps it was not just obtuseness to certain of the
      finer shades and meanings of life, but an irritating
      aggressiveness at times, backed only by her limited
      understanding, which caused her to seek and wish to be
      here, there and the other place; wherever, in her mind, the
      truly successful--which meant nearly always the materially
      successful of a second or third rate character--were, which
      irritated him most of all. How often had he tried to point
      out the difference between true and shoddy distinction--the
      former rarely connected with great wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no. So often she seemed to imagine such queer people to
      be truly successful, when they were really not--usually
      people with just money, or a very little more.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the matter of rearing and educating and marrying
      their two children, Wesley and Ethelberta, who had come
      after Elwell--what peculiar pains and feelings had not been
      involved in all this for him. In infancy both of these had
      seemed sweet enough, and so close to him, though never
      quite so wonderful as Elwell. But, as they grew, it seemed
      somehow as though Ernestine had come between him and them.
      First, it was the way she had raised them, the very stiff
      and formal manner in which they were supposed to move and
      be, copied from the few new-rich whom she had chanced to
      meet through him--and admired in spite of his warnings.
      That was the irony of architecture as a profession--it was
      always bringing such queer people close to one, and for the
      sake of one's profession, sometimes, particularly in the
      case of the young architect, one had to be nice to them.
      Later, it was the kind of school they should attend. He had
      half imagined at first that it would be the public school,
      because they both had begun as simple people; but no, since
      they were prospering it had to be a private school for
      each, and not one of his selection, either--or hers,
      really--but one to which the Barlows and the Westervelts,
      two families of means with whom Ernestine had become
      intimate, sent their children and therefore thought
      excellent!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Barlows! Wealthy, but, to him, gross and mediocre
      people who had made a great deal of money in the
      manufacture of patent medicines out West, and who had then
      come to New York to splurge, and had been attracted to
      Ernestine--not him particularly, he imagined--because
      Haymaker had built a town house for them, and also because
      he was gaining a fine reputation. They were dreadful
      really, so <i>gauche,</i> so truly dull; and yet somehow
      they seemed to suit Ernestine's sense of fitness and worth
      at the time, because, as she said, they were good and
      kind--like her Western home folks; only they were not
      really. She just imagined so. They were worthy enough
      people in their way, though with no taste. Young Fred
      Barlow had been sent to the expensive Gaillard School for
      Boys, near Morristown, where they were taught manners and
      airs, and little else, as Haymaker always thought, though
      Ernestine insisted that they were given a religious
      training as well. And so Wesley had to go there--for a
      time, anyhow. It was the best school.
    </p>
    <p>
      And similarly, because Mercedes Westervelt, senseless, vain
      little thing, was sent to Briarcliff School, near White
      Plains, Ethelberta had to go there. Think of it! It was all
      so silly, so pushing. How well he remembered the long,
      delicate campaign which preceded this, the logic and
      tactics employed, the importance of it socially to
      Ethelberta, the tears and cajolery. Mrs. Haymaker could
      always cry so easily, or seem to be on the verge of it,
      when she wanted anything; and somehow, in spite of the fact
      that he knew her tears were unimportant, or timed and for a
      purpose, he could never stand out against them, and she
      knew it. Always he felt moved or weakened in spite of
      himself. He had no weapon wherewith to fight them, though
      he resented them as a part of the argument. Positively Mrs.
      Haymaker could be as sly and as ruthless as Machiavelli
      himself at times, and yet believe all the while that she
      was tender, loving, self-sacrificing, generous, moral and a
      dozen other things, all of which led to the final
      achievement of her own aims. Perhaps this was admirable
      from one point of view, but it irritated him always. But if
      one were unable to see him- or herself, their actual
      disturbing inconsistencies, what were you to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      And again, he had by then been married so long that it was
      almost impossible to think of throwing her over, or so it
      seemed at the time. They had reached the place then where
      they had supposedly achieved position together, though in
      reality it was all his--and not such position as he was
      entitled to, at that. Ernestine--and he was thinking this
      in all kindness--could never attract the ideal sort. And
      anyhow, the mere breath of a scandal between them,
      separation or unfaithfulness, which he never really
      contemplated, would have led to endless bickering and
      social and commercial injury, or so he thought. All her
      strong friends--and his, in a way--those who had originally
      been his clients, would have deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their wives, their own social fears, would have compelled
      them to ostracize him! He would have been a scandal-marked
      architect, a brute for objecting to so kind and faithful
      and loving a wife. And perhaps he would have been, at that.
      He could never quite tell, it was all so mixed and tangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take, again, the marriage of his son Wesley into the De
      Gaud family--George de Gaud <i>p&egrave;re</i> being nothing more
      than a retired real-estate speculator and promoter who had
      money, but nothing more; and Irma de Gaud, the daughter,
      being a gross, coarse, sensuous girl, physically attractive
      no doubt, and financially reasonably secure, or so she had
      seemed; but what else? Nothing, literally nothing; and his
      son had seemed to have at least some spiritual ideals at
      first. Ernestine had taken up with Mrs. George de Gaud--a
      miserable, narrow creature, so Haymaker thought--largely
      for Wesley's sake, he presumed. Anyhow, everything had been
      done to encourage Wesley in his suit and Irma in her
      toleration, and now look at them! De Gaud <i>p&egrave;re</i> had
      since failed and left his daughter practically nothing.
      Irma had been interested in anything but Wesley's career,
      had followed what she considered the smart among the
      new-rich--a smarter, wilder, newer new-rich than ever
      Ernestine had fancied, or could. To-day she was without a
      thought for anything besides teas and country clubs and
      theaters--and what else?
    </p>
    <p>
      And long since Wesley had begun to realize it himself. He
      was an engineer now, in the employ of one of the great
      construction companies, a moderately successful man. But
      even Ernestine, who had engineered the match and thought it
      wonderful, was now down on her. She had begun to see
      through her some years ago, when Irma had begun to ignore
      her; only before it was always the De Gauds here, and the
      De Gauds there. Good gracious, what more could any one want
      than the De Gauds--Irma de Gaud, for instance? Then came
      the concealed dissension between Irma and Wesley, and now
      Mrs. Haymaker insisted that Irma had held, and was holding
      Wesley back. She was not the right woman for him.
      Almost--against all her prejudices--she was willing that he
      should leave her. Only, if Haymaker had broached anything
      like that in connection with himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet Mrs. Haymaker had been determined, because of what
      she considered the position of the De Gauds at that time,
      that Wesley should marry Irma. Wesley now had to slave at
      mediocre tasks in order to have enough to allow Irma to run
      in so-called fast society of a second or third rate. And
      even at that she was not faithful to him--or so Haymaker
      believed. There were so many strange evidences. And yet
      Haymaker felt that he did not care to interfere now. How
      could he? Irma was tired of Wesley, and that was all there
      was to it. She was looking elsewhere, he was sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take but one more case, that of Ethelberta. What a name! In
      spite of all Ernestine's determination to make her so
      successful and thereby reflect some credit on her had she
      really succeeded in so doing? To be sure, Ethelberta's
      marriage was somewhat more successful financially than
      Wesley's had proved to be, but was she any better placed in
      other ways? John Kelso--"Jack," as she always called
      him--with his light ways and lighter mind, was he really
      any one!--anything more than a waster? His parents stood by
      him no doubt, but that was all; and so much the worse for
      him. According to Mrs. Haymaker at the time, he, too, was
      an ideal boy, admirable, just the man for Ethelberta,
      because the Kelsos, <i>p&egrave;re</i> and <i>m&egrave;re,</i> had money.
      Horner Kelso had made a kind of fortune in Chicago in the
      banknote business, and had settled in New York, about the
      time that Ethelberta was fifteen, to spend it. Ethelberta
      had met Grace Kelso at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now see! She was not unattractive, and had some
      pleasant, albeit highly affected, social ways; she had
      money, and a comfortable apartment in Park Avenue; but what
      had it all come to? John Kelso had never done anything
      really, nothing. His parents' money and indulgence and his
      early training for a better social state had ruined him if
      he had ever had a mind that amounted to anything. He was
      idle, pleasure-loving, mentally indolent, like Irma de
      Gaud. Those two should have met and married, only they
      could never have endured each other. But how Mrs. Haymaker
      had courted the Kelsos in her eager and yet diplomatic way,
      giving teas and receptions and theater parties; and yet he
      had never been able to exchange ten significant words with
      either of them, or the younger Kelsos either. Think of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      And somehow in the process Ethelberta, for all his early
      affection and tenderness and his still kindly feeling for
      her, had been weaned away from him and had proved a limited
      and conventional girl, somewhat like her mother, and more
      inclined to listen to her than to him--though he had not
      minded that really. It had been the same with Wesley before
      her. Perhaps, however, a child was entitled to its likes
      and dislikes, regardless.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why had he stood for it all, he now kept asking
      himself. Why? What grand results, if any, had been
      achieved? Were their children so wonderful?--their lives?
      Would he not have been better off without her--his children
      better, even, by a different woman?--hers by a different
      man? Wouldn't it have been better if he had destroyed it
      all, broken away? There would have been pain, of course,
      terrible consequences, but even so he would have been free
      to go, to do, to reorganize his life on another basis.
      Zingara had avoided marriage entirely--wise man. But no,
      no; always convention, that long list of reasons and
      terrors he was always reciting to himself. He had allowed
      himself to be pulled round by the nose, God only knows why,
      and that was all there was to it. Weakness, if you will,
      perhaps; fear of convention; fear of what people would
      think and say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always now he found himself brooding over the dire results
      to him of all this respect on his part for convention,
      moral order, the duty of keeping society on an even keel,
      of not bringing disgrace to his children and himself and
      her, and yet ruining his own life emotionally by so doing.
      To be respectable had been so important that it had
      resulted in spiritual failure for him. But now all that was
      over with him, and Mrs. Haymaker was ill, near to death,
      and he was expected to wish her to get well, and be happy
      with her for a long time yet! Be happy! In spite of
      anything he might wish or think he ought to do, he
      couldn't. He couldn't even wish her to get well.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too much to ask. There was actually a haunting
      satisfaction in the thought that she might die now. It
      wouldn't be much, but it would be something--a few years of
      freedom. That was something. He was not utterly old yet,
      and he might have a few years of peace and comfort to
      himself still--and--and-- That dream--that dream--though it
      might never come true now--it couldn't
      really--still--still-- He wanted to be free to go his own
      way once more, to do as he pleased, to walk, to think, to
      brood over what he had not had--to brood over what he had
      not had! Only, only, whenever he looked into her pale sick
      face and felt her damp limp hands he could not quite wish
      that, either; not quite, not even now. It seemed too hard,
      too brutal--only--only-- So he wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; in spite of her long-past struggle over foolish things
      and in spite of himself and all he had endured or thought
      he had, he was still willing that she should live; only he
      couldn't wish it exactly. Yes, let her live if she could.
      What matter to him now whether she lived or died? Whenever
      he looked at her he could not help thinking how helpless
      she would be without him, what a failure at her age, and so
      on. And all along, as he wryly repeated to himself, she had
      been thinking and feeling that she was doing the very best
      for him and her and the children!--that she was really the
      ideal wife for him, making every dollar go as far as it
      would, every enjoyment yield the last drop for them all,
      every move seeming to have been made to their general
      advantage! Yes, that was true. There was a pathos about it,
      wasn't there? But as for the actual results--!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, the second after his talk with Doctor
      Storm, found him sitting once more beside his front window
      in the early dawn, and so much of all this, and much more,
      was coming back to him, as before. For the thousandth or
      the ten-thousandth time, as it seemed to him, in all the
      years that had gone, he was concluding again that his life
      was a failure. If only he were free for a little while just
      to be alone and think, perhaps to discover what life might
      bring him yet; only on this occasion his thoughts were
      colored by a new turn in the situation. Yesterday
      afternoon, because Mrs. Haymaker's condition had grown
      worse, the consultation between Grainger and Storm was
      held, and to-day sometime transfusion was to be tried, that
      last grim stand taken by physicians in distress over a
      case; blood taken from a strong ex-cavalryman out of a
      position, in this case, and the best to be hoped for, but
      not assured. In this instance his thoughts were as before
      wavering. Now supposing she really died, in spite of this?
      What would he think of himself then? He went back after a
      time and looked in on her where she was still sleeping. Now
      she was not so strong as before, or so she seemed; her
      pulse was not so good, the nurse said. And now as before
      his mood changed in her favor, but only for a little while.
      For later, waking, she seemed to look and feel better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later he came up to the dining room, where the nurse was
      taking her breakfast, and seating himself beside her, as
      was his custom these days, asked: "How do you think she is
      to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He and the night nurse had thus had their breakfasts
      together for days. This nurse, Miss Filson, was such a
      smooth, pink, graceful creature, with light hair and blue
      eyes, the kind of eyes and color that of late, and in
      earlier years, had suggested to him the love time or youth
      that he had missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter looked grave, as though she really feared the
      worst but was concealing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No worse, I think, and possibly a little better," she
      replied, eying him sympathetically. He could see that she
      too felt that he was old and in danger of being neglected.
      "Her pulse is a little stronger, nearly normal now, and she
      is resting easily. Doctor Storm and Doctor Grainger are
      coming, though, at ten. Then they'll decide what's to be
      done. I think if she's worse that they are going to try
      transfusion. The man has been engaged. Doctor Storm said
      that when she woke to-day she was to be given strong beef
      tea. Mrs. Elfridge is making it now. The fact that she is
      not much worse, though, is a good sign in itself, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haymaker merely stared at her from under his heavy gray
      eyebrows. He was so tired and gloomy, not only because he
      had not slept much of late himself but because of this
      sawing to and fro between his varying moods. Was he never
      to be able to decide for himself what he really wished? Was
      he never to be done with this interminable moral or
      spiritual problem? Why could he not make up his mind on the
      side of moral order, sympathy, and be at peace? Miss Filson
      pattered on about other heart cases, how so many people
      lived years and years after they were supposed to die of
      heart lesion; and he meditated as to the grayness and
      strangeness of it all, the worthlessness of his own life,
      the variability of his own moods. Why was he so? How
      queer--how almost evil, sinister--he had become at times;
      how weak at others. Last night as he had looked at
      Ernestine lying in bed, and this morning before he had seen
      her, he had thought if she only would die--if he were only
      really free once more, even at this late date. But then
      when he had seen her again this morning and now when Miss
      Filson spoke of transfusion, he felt sorry again. What good
      would it do him now? Why should he want to kill her? Could
      such evil ideas go unpunished either in this world or the
      next? Supposing his children could guess! Supposing she did
      die now--and he wished it so fervently only this
      morning--how would he feel? After all, Ernestine had not
      been so bad. She had tried, hadn't she?--only she had not
      been able to make a success of things, as he saw it, and he
      had not been able to love her, that was all. He reproached
      himself once more now with the hardness and the cruelty of
      his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinion of the two physicians was that Mrs. Haymaker
      was not much better and that this first form of blood
      transfusion must be resorted to--injected straight via a
      pump--which should restore her greatly provided her heart
      did not bleed it out too freely. Before doing so, however,
      both men once more spoke to Haymaker, who in an excess of
      self-condemnation insisted that no expense must be spared.
      If her life was in danger, save it by any means--all. It
      was precious to her, to him and to her children. So he
      spoke. Thus he felt that he was lending every force which
      could be expected of him, aside from fervently wishing for
      her recovery, which even now, in spite of himself, he could
      not do. He was too weary of it all, the conventional round
      of duties and obligations. But if she recovered, as her
      physicians seemed to think she might if transfusion were
      tried, if she gained even, it would mean that he would have
      to take her away for the summer to some quiet mountain
      resort--to be with her hourly during the long period in
      which she would be recovering. Well, he would not complain
      now. That was all right. He would do it. He would be bored
      of course, as usual, but it would be too bad to have her
      die when she could be saved. Yes, that was true. And yet--
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down to his office again and in the meantime this
      first form of transfusion was tried, and proved a great
      success, apparently. She was much better, so the day nurse
      phoned at three; very much better. At five-thirty Mr.
      Haymaker returned, no unsatisfactory word having come in
      the interim, and there she was, resting on a raised pillow,
      if you please, and looking so cheerful, more like her old
      self than he had seen her in some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once then his mood changed again. They were amazing,
      these variations in his own thoughts, almost chemic, not
      volitional, decidedly peculiar for a man who was supposed
      to know his own mind--only did one, ever? Now she would not
      die. Now the whole thing would go on as before. He was sure
      of it. Well, he might as well resign himself to the old
      sense of failure. He would never be free now. Everything
      would go on as before, the next and the next day the same.
      Terrible! Though he seemed glad--really grateful, in a way,
      seeing her cheerful and hopeful once more--still the
      obsession of failure and being once more bound forever
      returned now. In his own bed at midnight he said to
      himself: "Now she will really get well. All will be as
      before. I will never be free. I will never have a day--a
      day! Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next morning, to his surprise and fear or comfort,
      as his moods varied, she was worse again; and then once
      more he reproached himself for his black thoughts. Was he
      not really killing her by what he thought? he asked
      himself--these constant changes in his mood? Did not his
      dark wishes have power? Was he not as good as a murderer in
      his way? Think, if he had always to feel from now on that
      he had killed her by wishing so! Would not that be
      dreadful--an awful thing really? Why was he this way? Could
      he not be human, kind?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Doctor Storm came at nine-thirty, after a telephone
      call from the nurse, and looked grave and spoke of horses'
      blood as being better, thicker than human blood--not so
      easily bled out of the heart when injected as a
      serum--Haymaker was beside himself with self-reproaches and
      sad, disturbing fear. His dark, evil thoughts of last night
      and all these days had done this, he was sure. Was he
      really a murderer at heart, a dark criminal, plotting her
      death?--and for what? Why had he wished last night that she
      would die? Her case must be very desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must do your best," he now said to Doctor Storm.
      "Whatever is needful--she must not die if you can help it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mr. Haymaker," returned the latter sympathetically.
      "All that can be done will be done. You need not fear. I
      have an idea that we didn't inject enough yesterday, and
      anyhow human blood is not thick enough in this case. She
      responded, but not enough. We will see what we can do
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haymaker, pressed with duties, went away, subdued and sad.
      Now once more he decided that he must not tolerate these
      dark ideas any more, must rid himself of these black
      wishes, whatever he might feel. It was evil. They would
      eventually come back to him in some dark way, he might be
      sure. They might be influencing her. She must be allowed to
      recover if she could without any opposition on his part. He
      must now make a further sacrifice of his own life, whatever
      it cost. It was only decent, only human. Why should he
      complain now, anyhow, after all these years! What
      difference would a few more years make? He returned at
      evening, consoled by his own good thoughts and a telephone
      message at three to the effect that his wife was much
      better. This second injection had proved much more
      effective. Horses' blood was plainly better for her. She
      was stronger, and sitting up again. He entered at five, and
      found her lying there pale and weak, but still with a
      better light in her eye, a touch of color in her cheeks--or
      so he thought--more force, and a very faint smile for him,
      so marked had been the change. How great and kind Doctor
      Storm really was! How resourceful! If she would only get
      well now! If this dread siege would only abate! Doctor
      Storm was coming again at eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, how are you, dear?" she asked, looking at him
      sweetly and lovingly, and taking his hand in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent and kissed her forehead--a Judas kiss, he had
      thought up to now, but not so to-night. To-night he was
      kind, generous--anxious, even, for her to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, dearest; very good indeed. And how are you?
      It's such a fine evening out. You ought to get well soon so
      as to enjoy these spring days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to," she replied softly. "I feel so much better.
      And how have you been? Has your work gone all right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded and smiled and told her bits of news. Ethelberta
      had phoned that she was coming, bringing violets. Wesley
      had said he would be here at six, with Irma! Such-and-such
      people had asked after her. How could he have been so evil,
      he now asked himself, as to wish her to die? She was not so
      bad--really quite charming in her way, an ideal wife for
      some one, if not him. She was as much entitled to live and
      enjoy her life as he was to enjoy his; and after all she
      was the mother of his children, had been with him all these
      years. Besides, the day had been so fine--it was now--a
      wondrous May evening. The air and sky were simply
      delicious. A lavender haze was in the air. The telephone
      bell now ringing brought still another of a long series of
      inquiries as to her condition. There had been so many of
      these during the last few days, the maid said, and
      especially to-day--and she gave Mr. Haymaker a list of
      names. See, he thought, she had even more friends than he,
      being so good, faithful, worthy. Why should he wish her
      ill?
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down to dinner with Ethelberta and Wesley when they
      arrived, and chatted quite gayly--more hopefully than he
      had in weeks. His own varying thoughts no longer depressing
      him, for the moment he was happy. How were they? What were
      the children all doing? At eight-thirty Doctor Storm came
      again, and announced that he thought Mrs. Haymaker was
      doing very well indeed, all things considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her condition is fairly promising, I must say," he said.
      "If she gets through another night or two comfortably
      without falling back I think she'll do very well from now
      on. Her strength seems to be increasing a fraction.
      However, we must not be too optimistic. Cases of this kind
      are very treacherous. To-morrow we'll see how she feels,
      whether she needs any more blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away, and at ten Ethelberta and Wesley left for the
      night, asking to be called if she grew worse, thus leaving
      him alone once more. He sat and meditated. At eleven, after
      a few moments at his wife's bedside--absolute quiet had
      been the doctor's instructions these many days--he himself
      went to bed. He was very tired. His varying thoughts had
      afflicted him so much that he was always tired, it
      seemed--his evil conscience, he called it--but to-night he
      was sure he would sleep. He felt better about himself,
      about life. He had done better, to-day. He should never
      have tolerated such dark thoughts. And yet--and yet--and
      yet--
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay on his bed near a window which commanded a view of a
      small angle of the park, and looked out. There were the
      spring trees, as usual, silvered now by the light, a bit of
      lake showing at one end. Here in the city a bit of sylvan
      scenery such as this was so rare and so expensive. In his
      youth he had been so fond of water, any small lake or
      stream or pond. In his youth, also, he had loved the moon,
      and to walk in the dark. It had all, always, been so
      suggestive of love and happiness, and he had so craved love
      and happiness and never had it. Once he had designed a
      yacht club, the base of which suggested waves. Once, years
      ago, he had thought of designing a lovely cottage or
      country house for himself and some new love--that wonderful
      one--if ever she came and he were free. How wonderful it
      would all have been. Now--now--the thought at such an hour
      and especially when it was too late, seemed sacrilegious,
      hard, cold, unmoral, evil. He turned his face away from the
      moonlight and sighed, deciding to sleep and shut out these
      older and darker and sweeter thoughts if he could, and did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he dreamed, and it was as if some lovely spirit
      of beauty--that wondrous thing he had always been
      seeking--came and took him by the hand and led him out, out
      by dimpling streams and clear rippling lakes and a great,
      noble highway where were temples and towers and figures in
      white marble. And it seemed as he walked as if something
      had been, or were, promised him--a lovely fruition to
      something which he craved--only the world toward which he
      walked was still dark or shadowy, with something sad and
      repressing about it, a haunting sense of a still darker
      distance. He was going toward beauty apparently, but he was
      still seeking, seeking, and it was dark there when--
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Haymaker! Mr. Haymaker!" came a voice--soft, almost
      mystical at first, and then clearer and more disturbing, as
      a hand was laid on him. "Will you come at once? It's Mrs.
      Haymaker!"
    </p>
    <p>
      On the instant he was on his feet seizing the blue silk
      dressing gown hanging at his bed's head, and adjusting it
      as he hurried. Mrs. Elfridge and the nurse were behind him,
      very pale and distrait, wringing their hands. He could tell
      by that that the worst was at hand. When he reached the
      bedroom--her bedroom--there she lay as in life--still,
      peaceful, already limp, as though she were sleeping. Her
      thin, and as he sometimes thought, cold, lips were now
      parted in a faint, gracious smile, or trace of one. He had
      seen her look that way, too, at times; a really gracious
      smile, and wise, wiser than she was. The long, thin,
      graceful hands were open, the fingers spread slightly apart
      as though she were tired, very tired. The eyelids, too,
      rested wearily on tired eyes. Her form, spare as always,
      was outlined clearly under the thin coverlets. Miss Filson,
      the night nurse, was saying something about having fallen
      asleep for a moment, and waking only to find her so. She
      was terribly depressed and disturbed, possibly because of
      Doctor Storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haymaker paused, greatly shocked and moved by the
      sight--more so than by anything since the death of little
      Elwell. After all, she had tried, according to her light.
      But now she was dead--and they had been together so long!
      He came forward, tears of sympathy springing to his eyes,
      then sank down beside the bed on his knees so as not to
      disturb her right hand where it lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ernie, dear," he said gently, "Ernie--are you really
      gone?" His voice was full of sorrow; but to himself it
      sounded false, traitorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted the hand and put it to his lips sadly, then
      leaned his head against her, thinking of his long, mixed
      thoughts these many days, while both Mrs. Elfridge and the
      nurse began wiping their eyes. They were so sorry for him,
      he was so old now!
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he got up--they came forward to persuade him
      at last--looking tremendously sad and distrait, and asked
      Mrs. Elfridge and the nurse not to disturb his children.
      They could not aid her now. Let them rest until morning.
      Then he went back to his own room and sat down on the bed
      for a moment, gazing out on the same silvery scene that had
      attracted him before. It was dreadful. So then his dark
      wishing had come true at last? Possibly his black thoughts
      had killed her after all. Was that possible? Had his
      voiceless prayers been answered in this grim way? And did
      she know now what he had really thought? Dark thought.
      Where was she now? What was she thinking now if she knew?
      Would she hate him--haunt him? It was not dawn yet, only
      two or three in the morning, and the moon was still bright.
      And in the next room she was lying, pale and cool, gone
      forever now out of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up after a time and went forward into that pleasant
      front room where he had so often loved to sit, then back
      into her room to view the body again. Now that she was
      gone, here more than elsewhere, in her dead presence, he
      seemed better able to collect his scattered thoughts. She
      might see or she might not--might know or not. It was all
      over now. Only he could not help but feel a little evil.
      She had been so faithful, if nothing more, so earnest in
      behalf of him and of his children. He might have spared her
      these last dark thoughts of these last few days. His
      feelings were so jumbled that he could not place them half
      the time. But at the same time the ethics of the past, of
      his own irritated feelings and moods in regard to her, had
      to be adjusted somehow before he could have peace. They
      must be adjusted, only how--how? He and Mrs. Elfridge had
      agreed not to disturb Doctor Storm any more to-night. They
      were all agreed to get what rest they could against the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time he came forward once more to the front room to
      sit and gaze at the park. Here, perhaps, he could solve
      these mysteries for himself, think them out, find out what
      he did feel. He was evil for having wished all he had, that
      he knew and felt. And yet there was his own story, too--his
      life. The dawn was breaking by now; a faint grayness shaded
      the east and dimly lightened this room. A tall pier mirror
      between two windows now revealed him to himself--spare,
      angular, disheveled, his beard and hair astray and his eyes
      weary. The figure he made here as against his dreams of a
      happier life, once he were free, now struck him forcibly.
      What a farce! What a failure! Why should he, of all people,
      think of further happiness in love, even if he were free?
      Look at his reflection here in this mirror. What a
      picture--old, grizzled, done for! Had he not known that for
      so long? Was it not too ridiculous? Why should he have
      tolerated such vain thoughts? What could he of all people
      hope for now? No thing of beauty would have him now. Of
      course not. That glorious dream of his youth was gone
      forever. It was a mirage, an ignis fatuus. His wife might
      just as well have lived as died, for all the difference it
      would or could make to him. Only, he was really free just
      the same, almost as it were in spite of his varying moods.
      But he was old, weary, done for, a recluse and ungainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the innate cruelty of life, its blazing ironic
      indifference to him and so many grew rapidly upon him. What
      had he had? What all had he not missed? Dismally he stared
      first at his dark wrinkled skin; the crow's-feet at the
      sides of his eyes; the wrinkles across his forehead and
      between the eyes; his long, dark, wrinkled hands--handsome
      hands they once were, he thought; his angular, stiff body.
      Once he had been very much of a personage, he thought,
      striking, forceful, dynamic--but now! He turned and looked
      out over the park where the young trees were, and the lake,
      to the pinking dawn--just a trace now--a significant thing
      in itself at this hour surely--the new dawn, so wondrously
      new for younger people--then back at himself. What could he
      wish for now--what hope for?
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so his dream came back to him--that strange dream
      of seeking and being led and promised and yet always being
      led forward into a dimmer, darker land. What did that mean?
      Had it any real significance? Was it all to be dimmer,
      darker still? Was it typical of his life? He pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Free!" he said after a time. "Free! I know now how that
      is. I am free now, at last! Free! . . . Free! . . .
      Yes--free . . . to die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So he stood there ruminating and smoothing his hair and his
      beard.

    </h1>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot day in August. The parching rays of a summer
      sun had faded the once sappy green leaves of the trees to a
      dull and dusty hue. The grass, still good to look upon in
      shady places, spread sere and dry where the light had
      fallen unbroken. The roads were hot with thick dust, and
      wherever a stone path led, it reflected heat to weary body
      and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert McEwen had taken a seat under a fine old beech tree
      whose broad arms cast a welcome shade. He had come here out
      of the toil of the busy streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time he gave himself over to blank contemplation of
      the broad park and the occasional carriages that jingled
      by. Presently his meditation was broken by an ant on his
      trousers, which he flipped away with his finger. This awoke
      him to the thought that there might be more upon him. He
      stood up, shaking and brushing himself. Then he noticed an
      ant running along the walk in front of him. He stamped on
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess that will do for you," he said, half aloud, and
      sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now only did he really notice the walk. It was wide and
      hard and hot. Many ants were hurrying about, and now he saw
      that they were black. At last, one more active than the
      others fixed his eye. He followed it with his glance for
      more than a score of feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This particular ant was progressing urgently, now to the
      right, now to the left, stopping here and there, but never
      for more than a second. Its energy, the zigzag course it
      pursued, the frequency with which it halted to examine
      something, enlisted his interest. As he gazed, the path
      grew in imagination until it assumed immense proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he bestirred himself, took a single glance and
      then jumped, rubbing his eyes. He was in an unknown world,
      strange in every detail. The branched and many-limbed trees
      had disappeared. A forest of immense flat swords of green
      swayed in the air above him. The ground between lacked its
      carpet of green and was roughly strewn with immense
      boulders of clay. The air was strong with an odor which
      seemed strange and yet familiar. Only the hot sun streaming
      down and a sky of faultless blue betokened a familiar
      world. In regard to himself McEwen felt peculiar and yet
      familiar. What was it that made these surroundings and
      himself seem odd and yet usual? He could not tell. His
      three pairs of limbs and his vigorous mandibles seemed
      natural enough. The fact that he sensed rather than saw
      things was natural and yet odd. Forthwith moved by a sense
      of duty, necessity, and a kind of tribal obligation which
      he more felt than understood, he set out in search of food
      and prey and presently came to a broad plain, so wide that
      his eye could scarce command more than what seemed an
      immediate portion of it. He halted and breathed with a
      feeling of relief. Just then a voice startled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything to eat hereabout?" questioned the newcomer in a
      friendly and yet self-interested tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," he said, "I have just--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terrible," said the stranger, not waiting to hear his
      answer. "It looks like famine. You know the Sanguine&aelig; have
      gone to war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," answered McEwen mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the other, "they raided the Fusc&aelig; yesterday.
      They'll be down on us next."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that the stranger made off. McEwen was about to
      exclaim at the use of the word <i>us</i> when a ravenous
      craving for food, brought now forcibly to his mind by the
      words of the other, made him start in haste after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came another who bespoke him in passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't found a thing to-day, and I've been all the way
      to the Pratensis region. I didn't dare go any further
      without having some others with me. They're hungry, too, up
      there, though they've just made a raid. You heard the
      Sanguine&aelig; went to war, didn't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he told me," said McEwen, indicating the retreating
      figure of the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Ermi. Yes, he's been over in their territory. Well,
      I'll be going now."
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen hastened after Ermi at a good pace, and soon
      overtook him. The latter had stopped and was gathering in
      his mandibles a jagged crumb, almost as large as himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" exclaimed McEwen eagerly, "where did you get that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," said Ermi.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you give me a little?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not," said the other, and a light came in his eye
      that was almost evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," said McEwen, made bold by hunger and yet
      cautious by danger, "which way would you advise me to
      look?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wherever you please," said Ermi, "why ask me? You are not
      new at seeking," and strode off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The forest was better than this," thought McEwen; "there I
      would not die of the heat, anyhow, and I might find food.
      Here is nothing," and he turned and glanced about for a
      sight of the jungle whence he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far to the left and rear of him he saw it, those great
      up-standing swords. As he gazed, revolving in his troubled
      mind whether he should return or not, he saw another like
      himself hurrying toward him out of the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He eagerly hailed the newcomer, who was yet a long way off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" asked the other, coming up rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know where I can get something to eat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that why you called me?" he answered, eyeing him
      angrily. "Do you ask in time of famine? Certainly not. If I
      had anything for myself, I would not be out here. Go and
      hunt for it like the rest of us. Why should you be asking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been hunting," cried McEwen, his anger rising. "I
      have searched here until I am almost starved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No worse off than any of us, are you?" said the other.
      "Look at me. Do you suppose I am feasting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went off in high dudgeon, and McEwen gazed after him in
      astonishment. The indifference and sufficiency were at once
      surprising and yet familiar. Later he found himself falling
      rapidly into helpless lassitude from both hunger and heat,
      when a voice, as of one in pain, hailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho!" it cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello!" he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come!" was the feeble reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen started forward at once. When he was still many
      times his own length away he recognized the voice as that
      of his testy friend of a little while before, but now sadly
      changed. He was stretched upon the earth, working his
      mandibles feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" asked McEwen solicitously. "What ails you?
      How did this happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said the other. "I was passing along here
      when that struck me," indicating a huge boulder. "I am done
      for, though. You may as well have this food now, since you
      are one of us. The tribe can use what you do not eat," he
      sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing of the sort," said McEwen solicitously, the
      while he viewed the crushed limbs and side of the sufferer.
      "You'll be all right. Why do you speak of death? Just tell
      me where to take you, or whom to go for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the other, "it would be no use. You see how it
      is. They could do nothing for me. I did not want your aid.
      I merely wanted you to have this food here. I shall not
      want it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that," returned McEwen. "You mustn't talk about
      dying. There must be something I can do. Tell me. I don't
      want your food."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, there isn't anything you could do. There isn't any
      cure, you know that. Report, when you return, how I was
      killed. Just leave me now and take that with you. They need
      it, if you do not."
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen viewed him silently. This reference to a colony or
      tribe or home seemed to clarify many things for him. He
      remembered now apparently the long road he had come, the
      immense galleries of the colony to which he belonged under
      the earth, the passages by which he had made his way in and
      out, the powerful and revered ant mother, various larv&aelig; to
      be fed and eggs to be tended. To be sure. That was it. He
      was a part of this immense colony or group. The heat must
      have affected his sensory powers. He must gather food and
      return there--kill spiders, beetles, grubs, and bring them
      back to help provision the colony. That was it. Only there
      were so few to be found here, for some reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sufferer closed his eyes in evident pain, and trembled
      convulsively. Then he fell back and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen gazed upon the now fast stiffening body, with all
      but indifference, and wondered. The spectacle seemed so
      familiar as to be all but commonplace. Apparently he had
      seen so many die that way. Had he not, in times past,
      reported the deaths of hundreds?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he dead?" asked a voice at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said McEwen, scarcely bringing himself out of his
      meditation sufficiently to observe the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, he will not need this, I guess," said the
      other, and he seized upon the huge lump with his mandibles,
      but McEwen was on the alert and savage into the bargain, on
      the instant. He, too, gripped his mandibles upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was called by him to have this, before he died," he
      shouted "and I propose to have it. Let go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I will not," said the other with great vigor and
      energy. "I'll have some of it, at least," and, giving a
      mighty wrench, which sent both himself and McEwen
      sprawling, he tore off a goodly portion of it and ran,
      gaining his feet so quickly that he was a good length off
      before McEwen arose. The latter was too hungry, however, to
      linger in useless rage, and now fell to and ate before any
      other should disturb him. Then, feeling partially
      satisfied, he stretched himself languorously and continued
      more at his leisure. After a time he shook himself out of
      his torpor which had seized on him with his eating, and
      made off for the distant jungle, in which direction, as he
      now felt, lay the colony home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in one of the darkest and thickest portions of the
      route thither when there was borne to him from afar the
      sound of feet in marching time, and a murmuring as of
      distant voices. He stopped and listened. Presently the
      sounds grew louder and more individual. He could now tell
      that a great company was nearing him. The narrow path which
      he followed was clear for some distance, and open to
      observation. Not knowing what creatures he was about to
      meet, he stepped out of it into a thicket, at one side and
      took up a position behind a great boulder. The tramp of
      many feet was now so close as to bode contact and
      discovery, and he saw, through the interstices of green
      stalks, a strange column filing along the path he had left.
      They were no other than a company of red warriors--slave
      makers like himself, only of a different species, the
      fierce Sanguine&aelig; that Ermi had spoken of as having gone to
      war.
    </p>
    <p>
      To war they certainly had been, and no doubt were going
      again. Nearly every warrior carried with him some mark of
      plunder or of death. Many bore in their mandibles dead
      bodies of the enemy or their larv&aelig; captured from a Fuscan
      colony. Others bore upon their legs the severed heads of
      the poor blacks who had been slain in the defense of their
      home, and whose jaws still clung to their foes, fixed in
      the rigor of death. Still others dragged the bodies of
      their victims, and shouted as they went, making the long,
      lonely path to ring with uncanny sounds as they disappeared
      in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen came furtively out after a time and looked after
      them. He had gotten far to the left of the warriors and
      somewhat to the front of them, and was just about to leave
      the shadow of one clump of bushes to hurry to a neighboring
      stone, when there filed out from the very shelter upon
      which he had his eye fixed, the figure of one whom he
      immediately recognized as Ermi. The latter seemed to await
      a favorable opportunity when he should not be observed, and
      then started running. McEwen followed. In the distance
      could be seen a group of the Sanguine&aelig;, who had evidently
      paused for something, moving about in great excitement, in
      groups of two or three, gesticulating and talking. Some of
      those not otherwise engaged displayed a sensibility of
      danger or a lust of war by working their jaws and sawing at
      heavy stones with their mandibles. Presently one gazed in
      the direction of Ermi, and shouted to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately four warriors set out in pursuit. McEwen
      hastened after Ermi, to see what would become of him.
      Discreetly hidden himself, he could do this with
      considerable equanimity. As he approached, he saw Ermi
      moving backward and forward, endeavoring to close the
      entrance to a cave in which he had now taken refuge.
      Apparently that warrior had become aware that no time was
      to be lost, since he also could see the pursuing Sanguine&aelig;.
      With a swiftness born of daring and a keen realization of
      danger, he arranged a large boulder at the very edge of the
      portal as a key, and then others in such position that when
      the first should topple in the others would follow. Then he
      crawled deftly inside the portal, and pulling the keystone,
      toppled the whole mass in after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was hardly done when the Sanguine&aelig; were upon him. They
      were four cruel, murderous fighters, deeply scarred. One,
      called by the others Og, had a black's head at his thigh.
      One of his temples bore a scar, and the tip of his left
      antenna was broken. He was a keen old warrior, however, and
      scented the prey at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi, you!" he shouted to the others. "Here's the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then another drew near to the portal which Ermi had
      barricaded. He looked at it closely, walked about several
      times, sounded with his antenn&aelig; and then listened. There
      was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hist!" he exclaimed to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they came up. They also looked, but so well had Ermi
      done his work that they were puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not sure," said Og, "it looks to me more like an
      abandoned cave than an entrance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tear it open, anyway," advocated Ponan, the second of the
      quartette, speaking for the first time. "There may be no
      other exit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha!" cried Og, "Good! We will see anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on!" yelled Maru, a third, seizing the largest
      boulder, "Mandibles to!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out with him!" cried Om, jumping eagerly to work. "We will
      have him out in a jiffy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not an easy task, as the boulders were heavy and
      deep, but they tore them out. Later they dragged forth
      Ermi, who, finding himself captured, seized the head of
      Maru with his mandibles. Og, on the other hand, seized one
      of Ermi's legs in his powerful jaws. The others also had
      taken hold. The antennae of all were thrown back, and the
      entire mass went pushing and shoving, turning and tumbling
      in a whirl.
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen gazed, excited and sympathetic. At first he thought
      to avoid it all, having a horror of death, but a moment
      later decided to come to his friend's rescue, a feeling of
      tribal relationship which was overwhelming coming over him.
      Springing forward, he clambered upon the back of Og, at
      whose neck he began to saw with his powerful teeth. Og,
      realizing a new adversary, released his hold upon Ermi's
      limb and endeavored to shake off his new enemy. McEwen held
      tight, however. The others, however, too excited to observe
      the newcomer, still struggled to destroy Ermi. The latter
      had stuck steadily to his labor of killing Maru, and now,
      when Og's hold was loosened, he gave a powerful crush and
      Maru breathed his last. This advantaged him little,
      however, for both Ponan and Om were attacking his sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take that!" shouted Om, throwing himself violently upon
      Ermi and turning him over. "Saw off his head, Ponan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ponan released his hold and sprang for Ermi's head. There
      was a kicking and crushing of jaws, and Ponan secured his
      grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kill him!" yelled Om. "Come, Og! Come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this very moment Og's severed head fell to the ground,
      and McEwen leaping from his back, sprang to the aid of
      Ermi.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come!" he shouted at Ponan, who was sawing at Ermi's head.
      "It's two to two now," and McEwen gave such a wrench to
      Ponan's side that he writhed in pain, and released his hold
      on Ermi.
    </p>
    <p>
      But recovering himself he leaped upon McEwen, and bore him
      down, sprawling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fight was now more desperate than ever. The combatants
      rolled and tossed. McEwen's right antenna was broken by his
      fall, and one of his legs was injured. He could seem to get
      no hold upon his adversary, whom he now felt to be working
      toward his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let go!" he yelled, gnashing at him with his mandibles,
      but Ponan only tightened his murderous jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Better fortune was now with Ermi, however, who was a more
      experienced fighter. Getting a grip upon Om's body, he
      hurled him to the ground and left him stunned and
      senseless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing McEwen's predicament, he now sprang to his aid. The
      latter was being sadly worsted and but for the generous aid
      of Ermi, would have been killed. The latter struck Ponan a
      terrific blow with his head and having stunned him, dragged
      him off. The two, though much injured, now seized upon the
      unfortunate Sanguinea and tore him in two, and would have
      done as much for Om, had they not discovered that that
      bedraggled warrior had recovered sufficiently to crawl away
      and hide.
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen and Ermi now drew near to each other in warm
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come with me," said Ermi. "They are all about here now and
      that coward who escaped will have them upon us. There is a
      corridor into our home from here, only I was not able to
      reach it before they caught me. Help me barricade this
      entrance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they built up the stones more effectually than
      before, and then entered, toppling the mass in behind them.
      With considerable labor, they built up another barricade
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You watch a moment, now," said Ermi to McEwen, and then
      hurried down a long passage through which he soon returned
      bringing with him a sentinel, who took up guard duty at the
      point where the fight had occurred. "He will stay here and
      give the alarm in case another attack is made," he
      commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come now," he added, touching McEwen affectionately with
      his antenn&aelig;. Leading the way, Ermi took him along a long
      winding corridor with which, somehow, he seemed to be
      familiar, and through various secret passages into the
      colony house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," he said to McEwen familiarly, as they went,
      "they could not have gotten in here, even if they had
      killed me, without knowing the way. Our passageways are too
      intricate. But it is as well to keep a picket there, now
      that they are about. Where have you been? You do not belong
      to our colony, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen related his experiences since their meeting in the
      desert, without explaining where he came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that he was a member of some other colony of this
      same tribe without being sure of which one. A strange
      feeling of wandering confusion possessed him, as though he
      had been injured in some way, somewhere, and was lost for
      the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you might as well stay with us, now," said Ermi.
      "Are you hungry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very," said McEwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we will eat at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen now gazed upon a domed chamber of vast proportions,
      with which, also, he seemed familiar, an old inhabitant of
      one such, no less. It had several doors that opened out
      into galleries, and corridors leading to other chambers and
      store rooms, a home for thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many members of this allied family now hurried to meet
      them, all genially enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have had an encounter with them?" asked several at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing to speak of," said Ermi, who, fighter that he was,
      had also a touch of vanity. "Look after my friend here, who
      has saved my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I!" cried McEwen warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could not explain, however, before they were seized by
      their admirers and carried into a chamber where none of the
      din of preparation penetrated, and where was a carpet of
      soft grass threads upon which they might lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Injured though they were, neither could endure lying still
      for long, and were soon poking about, though unable to do
      anything. McEwen was privileged to idle and listlessly
      watch an attack on one portal of the cave which lasted an
      entire day, resulting in failure for the invaders. It was a
      rather broken affair, the principal excitement occurring
      about the barricaded portals and secret exits at the end of
      the long corridors, where McEwen often found himself in the
      way. The story of his prowess had been well told by Ermi,
      and he was a friend and hero whom many served. A sort of
      ambulance service was established which not only looked to
      the bringing in of the injured, but also to the removal of
      the dead. A graveyard was prepared just outside one of the
      secret entrances, far from the scene of the siege, and here
      the dead were laid in orderly rows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The siege having ended temporarily the same day it began,
      the household resumed its old order. Those who had remained
      within went forth for forage. The care of the communal
      young, which had been somewhat interrupted, was now
      resumed. Larv&aelig; and chrysalis, which had been left almost
      unattended in the vast nurseries, were moved to and fro
      between the rooms where the broken sunlight warmed, and the
      shadow gave them rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is war ahead," said Ermi to McEwen one day not long
      after this. "These Sanguine&aelig; will never let us alone until
      we give them battle. We shall have to stir up the whole
      race of Shining Slave Makers and fight all the Sanguine&aelig;
      before we have peace again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good," said McEwen. "I am ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So am I," answered Ermi, "but it is no light matter. They
      are our ancient enemy and as powerful as we. If we meet
      again you will see war that is war."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after this McEwen and Ermi, foraging together,
      encountered a Sanguinea, who fought with them and was
      slain. Numerous Lucidi, of which tribe he found himself to
      be a member, left the community of a morning to labor and
      were never heard of again. Encounters between parties of
      both camps were frequent, and orderly living ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the entire community was in a ferment, and a
      council was called. It was held in the main saloon of the
      formicary, a vast chamber whose hollowed dome rose like the
      open sky above them. The queen of the community was
      present, and all the chief warriors, including Ermi and
      McEwen. Loud talking and fierce comment were indulged in to
      no point, until Yumi, long a light in the councils of the
      Lucidi, spoke. He was short and sharp of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must go to war," he said. "Our old enemies will give us
      no peace. Send couriers to all the colonies of the Shining
      Slave Makers. We will meet the Red Slave Makers as we did
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said an old Lucidi, who stood at McEwen's side, "that
      was a great battle. You don't remember. You were too young.
      There were thousands and thousands in that. I could not
      walk for the dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are we to have another such?" asked McEwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the rest of us come. We are a great people. The Shining
      Slave Makers are numberless."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then another voice spoke, and Ermi listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us send for them to come here. When the Sanguine&aelig;
      again lay siege let us pour out and destroy them. Let none
      escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us first send couriers and hear what our people say,"
      broke in Ermi loudly. "The Sanguine&aelig; are a vast people
      also. We must have numbers. It must be a decisive battle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay," answered many. "Send the couriers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith messengers were dispatched to all parts, calling
      the hordes of the Shining Slave Makers to war. In due
      course they returned, bringing information that they were
      coming. Their colonies also had been attacked. Later the
      warriors of the allied tribes began to put in an
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a gathering of legions. The paths in the forests
      about resounded with their halloos. With the arrival of the
      first cohorts of these friendly colonies, there was a minor
      encounter with an irritant host of the Sanguine&aelig; foraging
      hereabout, who were driven back and destroyed. Later there
      were many minor encounters and deaths before the hosts were
      fully assembled, but the end was not yet. All knew that.
      The Sanguine&aelig; had fled, but not in cowardice. They would
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one problem with this vast host, now that it was
      assembled, was food. Eventually they expected to discover
      this in the sacked homes of the Sanguine&aelig;, but temporarily
      other provision must be made. The entire region had to be
      scoured. Colonies of Fusc&aelig; and Schauffusi living in nearby
      territory were attacked and destroyed. Their storehouses
      were ransacked and the contents distributed. Every form of
      life was attacked and still there was not enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both McEwen and Ermi, now inseparable, joined in one of
      these raids. It was upon a colony of Fusc&aelig;, who had their
      home in a neighboring forest. The company went singing on
      their way until within a short distance of the colony, when
      they became silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us not lose track of one another," said McEwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Ermi, "but they are nothing. We will take all
      they possess without a struggle. See them running."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said this, he motioned in the direction of several
      Fusc&aelig; that were fleeing toward their portals in terror. The
      Lucidi set up a shout, and darted after, plunging into the
      open gates, striking and slaying as they went. In a few
      minutes those first in came out again carrying their booty.
      Others were singly engaged in fiercest battle with large
      groups of the weaker Fusc&aelig;. Only a few of the latter were
      inclined to fight. They seemed for the most part dazed by
      their misfortunes. Numbers hung from the topmost blades of
      the towering sword-trees, and the broad, floor-like leaves
      of the massive weeds, about their caves where they had
      taken refuge, holding in their jaws baby larv&aelig; and cocoons
      rescued from the invaders, with which they had hurriedly
      fled to these nearest elevated objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Singly, McEwen pursued a dozen, and reveled in the sport of
      killing them. He tumbled them with rushes of his body,
      crushed them with his mandibles, and poisoned them with his
      formic sting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you need help?" called Ermi once, who was always near
      and shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," called McEwen scornfully, "bring me more of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the deadly work was over and the two comrades,
      gathering a mass of food, joined the returning band,
      singing as they went
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow," said Ermi, as they went along, "we will meet
      the Sanguine&aelig;. It is agreed. The leaders are conferring
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen did not learn where these latter were, but somehow
      he was pleased. An insane lust of combat was now upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will not be four to two this time," he laughed
      exultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, and we will not be barricading against them, either,"
      laughed Ermi, the lust of war simmering in his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they came near their camp, however, they found a large
      number of the assembled companies already in motion.
      Thousands upon thousands of those who had arrived were
      already assembled in one group or another and were prepared
      for action. There were cries and sounds of fighting, and
      long lines of Lucidi hurrying hither and thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" asked Ermi excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Sanguine&aelig;," was the answer. "They are returning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly McEwen became sober. Ermi turned to him
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," he said solemnly, "courage. We're in for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A tremendous hubbub followed. Already vast legions of the
      Lucidi were bearing away to the east. McEwen and Ermi, not
      being able to find their own, fell in with a strange
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Order!" shouted a voice in their ears. "Fall in line. We
      are called."
    </p>
    <p>
      The twain mechanically obeyed, and dropped behind a regular
      line. Soon they were winding along with other long lines of
      warriors through the tall sword trees, and in a little
      while reached a huge, smooth, open plain where already the
      actual fighting had begun. Thousands were here, apparently
      hundreds of thousands. There was little order, and scarcely
      any was needed apparently, since all contacts were
      individual or between small groups. It all depended now on
      numbers, and the results of the contests between
      individuals, or at the most, these small groups. Ermi,
      McEwen, and several other Lucidi were about to seize upon
      one Sanguinea, who was approaching them, when an amazing
      rush of the latter broke them, and McEwen found himself
      separated from Ermi with a red demon snapping at his
      throat. Dazed by the shock and clamor, he almost fell a
      prey to this first charge. A moment later, however, his
      courage and daring returned. With a furious bound, he
      recovered himself and forced himself upon his adversary,
      snapping his jaws in his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take that!" he said to the tumbling carcass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no sooner ended one foe, however, than another
      clutched him. They were on every hand, hard, merciless
      fighters like himself and Ermi who rushed and tore and
      sawed with amazing force. McEwen faced his newest adversary
      swiftly. While the latter was seeking for McEwen's head and
      antenn&aelig; with his mandibles, the former with a quick snap
      seized his foe by the neck. Turning up his abdomen, he
      ejected formic acid into the throat of the other. That
      finished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the battle continued on every hand with the same
      mad vehemence. Already the dead clogged the ground. Here,
      single combatants struggled--there, whole lines moved and
      swayed in deadly combat. Ever and anon new lines were
      formed, and strange hosts of friends or enemies came up,
      falling upon the combatants of both sides with murderous
      enthusiasm. McEwen, in a strange daze and lust of death,
      seemed to think nothing of it. He was alone now--lost in a
      tossing sea of war, and terror seemed to have forsaken him.
      It was wonderful, he thought, mysterious--
    </p>
    <p>
      As enemy after enemy assailed him, he fought them as he
      best knew, an old method to him, apparently, and as they
      died, he wished them to die--broken, poisoned, sawed in
      two. He began to count and exult in the numbers he had
      slain. It was at last as though he were dreaming, and all
      around was a vain, dark, surging mass of enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, four of the Sanguine&aelig; seized upon him in a group,
      and he went down before them, almost helpless. Swiftly they
      tore at his head and body, endeavoring to dispose of him
      quickly. One seized a leg, another an antenna. A third
      jumped and sawed at his neck. Still he did not care. It was
      all war, and he would struggle to the last shred of his
      strength, eagerly, enthusiastically. At last he seemed to
      lose consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he opened his eyes again, Ermi was beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" said Ermi.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" answered McEwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were about done for, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was I?" he answered. "How are things going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell yet," said Ermi. "All I know is that you
      were faring badly when I came up. Two of them were dead,
      but the other two were killing you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should have left me to them," said McEwen, noticing
      now for the first time Ermi's wounds. "It does not matter
      so much--one Lucidi more or less--what of it? But you have
      been injured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--oh, nothing. You are the one to complain. I fear you
      are badly injured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I," returned McEwen heavily, feeling at last the
      weight of death upon him, "I am done for. I cannot live. I
      felt myself dying some time ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes and trembled. In another moment--
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      * * * * *
    </p>
    <p>
      McEwen opened his eyes. Strangely enough he was looking out
      upon jingling carriages and loitering passersby in the
      great city park. It was all so strange, by comparison with
      that which he had so recently seen, the tall buildings in
      the distance, instead of the sword trees, the trees, the
      flowers. He jumped to his feet in astonishment, then sank
      back again in equal amaze, a passerby eyeing him curiously
      the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been asleep," he said in a troubled way. "I have
      been dreaming. And what a dream!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shut his eyes again, wishing, for some strange
      reason--charm, sympathy, strangeness--to regain the lost
      scene. An odd longing filled his heart, a sense of
      comradeship lost, of some friend he knew missing. When he
      opened his eyes again he seemed to realize something more
      of what had been happening, but it was fading, fading.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his feet lay the plain and the ants with whom he had
      recently been--or so he thought. Yes, there, only a few
      feet away in the parched grass, was an arid spot, over-run
      with insects. He gazed upon it, in amazement, searching for
      the details of a lost world. Now, as he saw, coming closer,
      a giant battle was in progress, such a one, for instance,
      as that in which he had been engaged in his dream. The
      ground was strewn with dead ants. Thousands upon thousands
      were sawing and striking at each other quite in the manner
      in which he had dreamed. What was this?--a revelation of
      the spirit and significance of a lesser life or of his
      own--or what? And what was life if the strange passions,
      moods and necessities which conditioned him here could
      condition those there on so minute a plane?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I was there," he said dazedly and a little
      dreamfully, "a little while ago. I died there--or as well
      as died there--in my dream. At least I woke out of it into
      this or sank from that into this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping closer he could see where lines were drawn, how in
      places the forces raged in confusion, and the field was
      cluttered with the dead. At one moment an odd mad
      enthusiasm such as he had experienced in his dream-world
      lay hold of him, and he looked for the advantage of the
      Shining Slave Makers--the blacks--as he thought of the two
      warring hosts as against the reds. But finding it not, the
      mood passed, and he stood gazing, lost in wonder. What a
      strange world! he thought. What worlds within worlds, all
      apparently full of necessity, contention, binding emotions
      and unities--and all with sorrow, their sorrow--a vague,
      sad something out of far-off things which had been there,
      and was here in this strong bright city day, had been there
      and would be here until this odd, strange thing called
      <i>life</i> had ended.

      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The city editor was waiting for one of his best reporters,
      Elmer Davies by name, a vain and rather self-sufficient
      youth who was inclined to be of that turn of mind which
      sees in life only a fixed and ordered process of rewards
      and punishments. If one did not do exactly right, one did
      not get along well. On the contrary, if one did, one did.
      Only the so-called evil were really punished, only the good
      truly rewarded--or Mr. Davies had heard this so long in his
      youth that he had come nearly to believe it. Presently he
      appeared. He was dressed in a new spring suit, a new hat
      and new shoes. In the lapel of his coat was a small bunch
      of violets. It was one o'clock of a sunny spring afternoon,
      and he was feeling exceedingly well and good-natured--quite
      fit, indeed. The world was going unusually well with him.
      It seemed worth singing about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read that, Davies," said the city editor, handing him the
      clipping. "I'll tell you afterward what I want you to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter stood by the editorial chair and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>

      <blockquote>Pleasant Valley, Ko., April 16.<br />
<br />



      "A most dastardly crime has just been reported here. Jeff
      Ingalls, a negro, this morning assaulted Ada Whitaker, the
      nineteen-year-old daughter of Morgan Whitaker, a well-to-do
      farmer, whose home is four miles south of this place. A
      posse, headed by Sheriff Mathews, has started in pursuit.
      If he is caught, it is thought he will be lynched."</blockquote>

    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter raised his eyes as he finished. What a
      terrible crime! What evil people there were in the world!
      No doubt such a creature ought to be lynched, and that
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better go out there, Davies," said the city
      editor. "It looks as if something might come of that. A
      lynching up here would be a big thing. There's never been
      one in this state."
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies smiled. He was always pleased to be sent out of
      town. It was a mark of appreciation. The city editor rarely
      sent any of the other men on these big stories. What a nice
      ride he would have!
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went along, however, a few minutes later he began to
      meditate on this. Perhaps, as the city editor had
      suggested, he might be compelled to witness an actual
      lynching. That was by no means so pleasant in itself. In
      his fixed code of rewards and punishments he had no
      particular place for lynchings, even for crimes of the
      nature described, especially if he had to witness the
      lynching. It was too horrible a kind of reward or
      punishment. Once, in line of duty, he had been compelled to
      witness a hanging, and that had made him sick--deathly
      so--even though carried out as a part of the due process of
      law of his day and place. Now, as he looked at this fine
      day and his excellent clothes, he was not so sure that this
      was a worthwhile assignment. Why should he always be
      selected for such things--just because he could write?
      There were others--lots of men on the staff. He began to
      hope as he went along that nothing really serious would
      come of it, that they would catch the man before he got
      there and put him in jail--or, if the worst had to
      be--painful thought!--that it would be all over by the time
      he got there. Let's see--the telegram had been filed at
      nine a.m. It was now one-thirty and would be three by the
      time he got out there, all of that. That would give them
      time enough, and then, if all were well, or ill, as it
      were, he could just gather the details of the crime and
      the--aftermath--and return. The mere thought of an
      approaching lynching troubled him greatly, and the farther
      he went the less he liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the village of Pleasant Valley a very small affair
      indeed, just a few dozen houses nestling between green
      slopes of low hills, with one small business corner and a
      rambling array of lanes. One or two merchants of K--, the
      city from which he had just arrived, lived out here, but
      otherwise it was very rural. He took notes of the whiteness
      of the little houses, the shimmering beauty of the small
      stream one had to cross in going from the depot. At the one
      main corner a few men were gathered about a typical village
      barroom. Davies headed for this as being the most likely
      source of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In mingling with this company at first he said nothing
      about his being a newspaper man, being very doubtful as to
      its effect upon them, their freedom of speech and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole company was apparently tense with interest in the
      crime which still remained unpunished, seemingly craving
      excitement and desirous of seeing something done about it.
      No such opportunity to work up wrath and vent their
      stored-up animal propensities had probably occurred here in
      years. He took this occasion to inquire into the exact
      details of the attack, where it had occurred, where the
      Whitakers lived. Then, seeing that mere talk prevailed
      here, he went away thinking that he had best find out for
      himself how the victim was. As yet she had not been
      described, and it was necessary to know a little something
      about her. Accordingly, he sought an old man who kept a
      stable in the village, and procured a horse. No carriage
      was to be had. Davies was not an excellent rider, but he
      made a shift of it. The Whitaker home was not so very far
      away--about four miles out--and before long he was knocking
      at its front door, set back a hundred feet from the rough
      country road.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm from the <i>Times</i>," he said to the tall, raw-
      boned woman who opened the door, with an attempt at being
      impressive. His position as reporter in this matter was a
      little dubious; he might be welcome, and he might not. Then
      he asked if this were Mrs. Whitaker, and how Miss Whitaker
      was by now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's doing very well," answered the woman, who seemed
      decidedly stern, if repressed and nervous, a Spartan type.
      "Won't you come in? She's rather feverish, but the doctor
      says she'll probably be all right later on." She said no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies acknowledged the invitation by entering. He was very
      anxious to see the girl, but she was sleeping under the
      influence of an opiate, and he did not care to press the
      matter at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did this happen?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About eight o'clock this morning," said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She started to go over to our next door neighbor here, Mr.
      Edmonds, and this negro met her. We didn't know anything
      about it until she came crying through the gate and dropped
      down in here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you the first one to meet her?" asked Davies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I was the only one," said Mrs. Whitaker. "The men had
      all gone to the fields."
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies listened to more of the details, the type and
      history of the man, and then rose to go. Before doing so he
      was allowed to have a look at the girl, who was still
      sleeping. She was young and rather pretty. In the yard he
      met a country man who was just coming to get home news. The
      latter imparted more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're lookin' all around south of here," he said,
      speaking of a crowd which was supposed to be searching. "I
      expect they'll make short work of him if they get him. He
      can't get away very well, for he's on foot, wherever he is.
      The sheriff's after him too, with a deputy or two, I
      believe. He'll be tryin' to save him an' take him over to
      Clayton, but I don't believe he'll be able to do it, not if
      the crowd catches him first."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, thought Davies, he would probably have to witness a
      lynching after all. The prospect was most unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does any one know where this negro lived?" he asked
      heavily, a growing sense of his duty weighing upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, right down here a little way," replied the farmer.
      "Jeff Ingalls was his name. We all know him around here. He
      worked for one and another of the farmers hereabouts, and
      don't appear to have had such a bad record, either, except
      for drinkin' a little now and then. Miss Ada recognized
      him, all right. You follow this road to the next crossing
      and turn to the right. It's a little log house that sets
      back off the road--something like that one you see down the
      lane there, only it's got lots o' chips scattered about."
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies decided to go there first, but changed his mind. It
      was growing late, and he thought he had better return to
      the village. Perhaps by now developments in connection with
      the sheriff or the posse were to be learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, he rode back and put the horse in the hands of
      its owner, hoping that all had been concluded and that he
      might learn of it here. At the principal corner much the
      same company was still present, arguing, fomenting,
      gesticulating. They seemed parts of different companies
      that earlier in the day had been out searching. He wondered
      what they had been doing since, and then decided to
      ingratiate himself by telling them he had just come from
      the Whitakers and what he had learned there of the present
      condition of the girl and the movements of the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a young farmer came galloping up. He was
      coatless, hatless, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They've got him!" he shouted excitedly. "They've got him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A chorus of "whos," "wheres" and "whens" greeted this
      information as the crowd gathered about the rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mathews caught him up here at his own house!"
      exclaimed the latter, pulling out a handkerchief and wiping
      his face. "He must 'a' gone back there for something.
      Mathews's takin' him over to Clayton, so they think, but
      they don't project he'll ever get there. They're after him
      now, but Mathews says he'll shoot the first man that tries
      to take him away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which way'd he go?" exclaimed the men in chorus, stirring
      as if to make an attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cross Sellers' Lane," said the rider. "The boys think
      he's goin' by way of Baldwin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoopee!" yelled one of the listeners. "We'll get him away
      from him, all right! Are you goin', Sam?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet!" said the latter. "Wait'll I get my horse!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord!" thought Davies. "To think of being (perforce) one
      of a lynching party--a hired spectator!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He delayed no longer, however, but hastened to secure his
      horse again. He saw that the crowd would be off in a minute
      to catch up with the sheriff. There would be information in
      that quarter, drama very likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's doin'?" inquired the liveryman as he noted Davies'
      excited appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're after him," replied the latter nervously. "The
      sheriff's caught him. They're going now to try to take him
      away from him, or that's what they say. The sheriff is
      taking him over to Clayton, by way of Baldwin. I want to
      get over there if I can. Give me the horse again, and I'll
      give you a couple of dollars more."
    </p>
    <p>
      The liveryman led the horse out, but not without many
      provisionary cautions as to the care which was to be taken
      of him, the damages which would ensue if it were not. He
      was not to be ridden beyond midnight. If one were wanted
      for longer than that Davies must get him elsewhere or come
      and get another, to all of which Davies promptly agreed. He
      then mounted and rode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the corner again several of the men who had
      gone for their horses were already there, ready to start.
      The young man who had brought the news had long since
      dashed off to other parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies waited to see which road this new company would
      take. Then through as pleasant a country as one would wish
      to see, up hill and down dale, with charming vistas
      breaking upon the gaze at every turn, he did the riding of
      his life. So disturbed was the reporter by the grim turn
      things had taken that he scarcely noted the beauty that was
      stretched before him, save to note that it was so. Death!
      Death! The proximity of involuntary and enforced death was
      what weighed upon him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about an hour the company had come in sight of the
      sheriff, who, with two other men, was driving a wagon he
      had borrowed along a lone country road. The latter was
      sitting at the back, a revolver in each hand, his face
      toward the group, which at sight of him trailed after at a
      respectful distance. Excited as every one was, there was no
      disposition, for the time being at least, to halt the
      progress of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's in that wagon," Davies heard one man say. "Don't you
      see they've got him in there tied and laid down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right," said another. "I see him now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What we ought to do," said a third, who was riding near
      the front, "is to take him away and hang him. That's just
      what he deserves, and that's what he'll get before we're
      through to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" called the sheriff, who seemed to have heard this.
      "You're not goin' to do any hangin' this day, so you just
      might as well go on back." He did not appear to be much
      troubled by the appearance of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's old man Whitaker?" asked one of the men who seemed
      to feel that they needed a leader. "He'd get him quick
      enough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's with the other crowd, down below Olney," was the
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somebody ought to go an' tell him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clark's gone," assured another, who hoped for the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies rode among the company a prey to mingled and
      singular feelings. He was very much excited and yet
      depressed by the character of the crowd which, in so far as
      he could see, was largely impelled to its jaunt by
      curiosity and yet also able under sufficient motivation on
      the part of some one--any one, really--to kill too. There
      was not so much daring as a desire to gain daring from
      others, an unconscious wish or impulse to organize the
      total strength or will of those present into one strength
      or one will, sufficient to overcome the sheriff and inflict
      death upon his charge. It was strange--almost
      intellectually incomprehensible--and yet so it was. The men
      were plainly afraid of the determined sheriff. They thought
      something ought to be done, but they did not feel like
      getting into trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathews, a large solemn, sage, brown man in worn clothes
      and a faded brown hat, contemplated the recent addition to
      his trailers with apparent indifference. Seemingly he was
      determined to protect his man and avoid mob justice, come
      what may. A mob should not have him if he had to shoot, and
      if he shot it would be to kill. Finally, since the company
      thus added to did not dash upon him, he seemingly decided
      to scare them off. Apparently he thought he could do this,
      since they trailed like calves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop a minute!" he called to his driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter pulled up. So did the crowd behind. Then the
      sheriff stood over the prostrate body of the negro, who lay
      in the jolting wagon beneath him, and called back:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go 'way from here, you people! Go on, now! I won't have
      you follerin' after me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give us the nigger!" yelled one in a half-bantering,
      half-derisive tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give ye just two minutes to go on back out o' this
      road," returned the sheriff grimly, pulling out his watch
      and looking at it. They were about a hundred feet apart.
      "If you don't, I'll clear you out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give us the nigger!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you, Scott," answered Mathews, recognizing the
      voice. "I'll arrest every last one of ye tomorrow. Mark my
      word!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The company listened in silence, the horses champing and
      twisting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got a right to foller," answered one of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give ye fair warning," said the sheriff, jumping from
      his wagon and leveling his pistols as he approached. "When
      I count five I'll begin to shoot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a serious and stalwart figure as he approached, and
      the crowd fell back a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Git out o' this now!" he yelled. "One--Two--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The company turned completely and retreated, Davies among
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll foller him when he gits further on," said one of the
      men in explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's got to do it," said another. "Let him git a little
      ways ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff returned to his wagon and drove on. He seemed,
      however, to realize that he would not be obeyed and that
      safety lay in haste alone. His wagon was traveling fast. If
      only he could lose them or get a good start he might
      possibly get to Clayton and the strong county jail by
      morning. His followers, however, trailed him swiftly as
      might be, determined not to be left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's goin' to Baldwin," said one of the company of which
      Davies was a member.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's that?" asked Davies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Over west o' here, about four miles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is he going there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's where he lives. I guess he thinks if he kin git 'im
      over there he kin purtect 'im till he kin git more help
      from Clayton. I cal'late he'll try an' take 'im over yet
      to-night, or early in the mornin' shore."
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies smiled at the man's English. This countryside lingo
      always fascinated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the men lagged, hesitating as to what to do. They did
      not want to lose sight of Matthews, and yet cowardice
      controlled them. They did not want to get into direct
      altercation with the law. It wasn't their place to hang the
      man, although plainly they felt that he ought to be hanged,
      and that it would be a stirring and exciting thing if he
      were. Consequently they desired to watch and be on hand--to
      get old Whitaker and his son Jake, if they could, who were
      out looking elsewhere. They wanted to see what the father
      and brother would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quandary was solved by one of the men, who suggested
      that they could get to Baldwin by going back to Pleasant
      Valley and taking the Sand River pike, and that in the
      meantime they might come upon Whitaker and his son en
      route, or leave word at his house. It was a shorter cut
      than this the sheriff was taking, although he would get
      there first now. Possibly they could beat him at least to
      Clayton, if he attempted to go on. The Clayton road was
      back via Pleasant Valley, or near it, and easily
      intercepted. Therefore, while one or two remained to trail
      the sheriff and give the alarm in case he did attempt to go
      on to Clayton, the rest, followed by Davies, set off at a
      gallop to Pleasant Valley. It was nearly dusk now when they
      arrived and stopped at the corner store--supper time. The
      fires of evening meals were marked by upcurling smoke from
      chimneys. Here, somehow, the zest to follow seemed to
      depart. Evidently the sheriff had worsted them for the
      night. Morg Whitaker, the father, had not been found;
      neither had Jake. Perhaps they had better eat. Two or three
      had already secretly fallen away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were telling the news of what had occurred so far to
      one of the two storekeepers who kept the place, when
      suddenly Jake Whitaker, the girl's brother, and several
      companions came riding up. They had been scouring the
      territory to the north of the town, and were hot and tired.
      Plainly they were unaware of the developments of which the
      crowd had been a part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sheriff's got 'im!" exclaimed one of the company, with
      that blatancy which always accompanies the telling of great
      news in small rural companies. "He taken him over to
      Baldwin in a wagon a coupla hours ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which way did he go?" asked the son, whose hardy figure,
      worn, hand-me-down clothes and rakish hat showed up
      picturesquely as he turned here and there on his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Cross Seller' Lane. You won't git 'em that-a-way,
      though, Jake. He's already over there by now. Better take
      the short cut."
    </p>
    <p>
      A babble of voices now made the scene more interesting. One
      told how the negro had been caught, another that the
      sheriff was defiant, a third that men were still tracking
      him or over there watching, until all the chief points of
      the drama had been spoken if not heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly suppers were forgotten. The whole customary order
      of the evening was overturned once more. The company
      started off on another excited jaunt, up hill and down
      dale, through the lovely country that lay between Baldwin
      and Pleasant Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      By now Davies was very weary of this procedure and of his
      saddle. He wondered when, if ever, this story was to
      culminate, let alone he write it. Tragic as it might prove,
      he could not nevertheless spend an indefinite period
      trailing a possibility, and yet, so great was the
      potentiality of the present situation, he dared not leave.
      By contrast with the horror impending, as he now noted, the
      night was so beautiful that it was all but poignant. Stars
      were already beginning to shine. Distant lamps twinkled
      like yellow eyes from the cottages in the valleys and on
      the hillsides. The air was fresh and tender. Some peafowls
      were crying afar off, and the east promised a golden moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently the assembled company trotted on--no more than a
      score in all. In the dusk, and with Jake ahead, it seemed
      too grim a pilgrimage for joking. Young Jake, riding
      silently toward the front, looked as if tragedy were all he
      craved. His friends seemed considerately to withdraw from
      him, seeing that he was the aggrieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an hour's riding Baldwin came into view, lying in a
      sheltering cup of low hills. Already its lights were
      twinkling softly and there was still an air of honest
      firesides and cheery suppers about it which appealed to
      Davies in his hungry state. Still, he had no thought now of
      anything save this pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in the village, the company was greeted by calls of
      recognition. Everybody seemed to know what they had come
      for. The sheriff and his charge were still there, so a
      dozen citizens volunteered. The local storekeepers and
      loungers followed the cavalcade up the street to the
      sheriff's house, for the riders had now fallen into a
      solemn walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't get him though, boys," said one whom Davies
      later learned was Seavey, the village postmaster and
      telegraph operator, a rather youthful person of between
      twenty-five and thirty, as they passed his door. "He's got
      two deputies in there with him, or did have, and they say
      he's going to take him over to Clayton."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first street corner they were joined by the several
      men who had followed the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He tried to give us the slip," they volunteered excitedly,
      "but he's got the nigger in the house, there, down in the
      cellar. The deputies ain't with him. They've gone somewhere
      for help--Clayton, maybe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We saw 'em go out that back way. We think we did, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred feet from the sheriff's little white cottage,
      which backed up against a sloping field, the men parleyed.
      Then Jake announced that he proposed to go boldly up to the
      sheriff's door and demand the negro.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he don't turn him out I'll break in the door an' take
      him!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right! We'll stand by you, Whitaker," commented
      several.
    </p>
    <p>
      By now the throng of unmounted natives had gathered. The
      whole village was up and about, its one street alive and
      running with people. Heads appeared at doors and windows.
      Riders pranced up and down, hallooing. A few revolver shots
      were heard. Presently the mob gathered even closer to the
      sheriff's gate, and Jake stepped forward as leader.
      Instead, however, of going boldly up to the door as at
      first it appeared he would, he stopped at the gate, calling
      to the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, Mathews!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh, eh, eh!" bellowed the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The call was repeated. Still no answer. Apparently to the
      sheriff delay appeared to be his one best weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their coming, however, was not as unexpected as some might
      have thought. The figure of the sheriff was plainly to be
      seen close to one of the front windows. He appeared to be
      holding a double-barreled shotgun. The negro, as it
      developed later, was cowering and chattering in the darkest
      corner of the cellar, hearkening no doubt to the voices and
      firing of the revolvers outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, and just as Jake was about to go forward, the
      front door of the house flew open, and in the glow of a
      single lamp inside appeared first the double-barreled end
      of the gun, followed immediately by the form of Mathews,
      who held the weapon poised ready for a quick throw to the
      shoulder. All except Jake fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Mathews," he called deliberately, "we want that
      nigger!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can't git 'im!" replied the sheriff. "He's not
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what you got that gun fer?" yelled a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathews made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better give him up, Mathews," called another, who was safe
      in the crowd, "or we'll come in an' take him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No you won't," said the sheriff defiantly. "I said the man
      wasn't here. I say it ag'in. You couldn't have him if he
      was, an' you can't come in my house! Now if you people
      don't want trouble you'd better go on away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's down in the cellar!" yelled another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you let us see?" asked another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathews waved his gun slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better go away from here now," cautioned the
      sheriff. "I'm tellin' ye! I'll have warrants out for the
      lot o' ye, if ye don't mind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd continued to simmer and stew, while Jake stood as
      before. He was very pale and tense, but lacked initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He won't shoot," called some one at the back of the crowd.
      "Why don't you go in, Jake, an' git him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure! Rush in. That's it!" observed a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He won't, eh?" replied the sheriff softly. Then he added
      in a lower tone, "The first man that comes inside that gate
      takes the consequences."
    </p>
    <p>
      No one ventured inside the gate; many even fell back. It
      seemed as if the planned assault had come to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not go around the back way?" called some one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try it!" replied the sheriff. "See what you find on that
      side! I told you you couldn't come inside. You'd better go
      away from here now before ye git into trouble," he
      repeated. "You can't come in, an' it'll only mean
      bloodshed."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was more chattering and jesting while the sheriff
      stood on guard. He, however, said no more. Nor did he allow
      the banter, turmoil and lust for tragedy to disturb him.
      Only, he kept his eye on Jake, on whose movements the crowd
      seemed to hang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed, and still nothing was done. The truth was that
      young Jake, put to the test, was not sufficiently
      courageous himself, for all his daring, and felt the
      weakness of the crowd behind him. To all intents and
      purposes he was alone, for he did not inspire confidence.
      He finally fell back a little, observing, "I'll git 'im
      before mornin', all right," and now the crowd itself began
      to disperse, returning to its stores and homes or standing
      about the postoffice and the one village drugstore.
      Finally, Davies smiled and came away. He was sure he had
      the story of a defeated mob. The sheriff was to be his
      great hero. He proposed to interview him later. For the
      present, he meant to seek out Seavey, the telegraph
      operator, and arrange to file a message, then see if
      something to eat was not to be had somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time he found the operator and told him what he
      wanted--to write and file a story as he wrote it. The
      latter indicated a table in the little postoffice and
      telegraph station which he could use. He became very much
      interested in the reporter when he learned he was from the
      <i>Times,</i> and when Davies asked where he could get
      something to eat said he would run across the street and
      tell the proprietor of the only boarding house to fix him
      something which he could consume as he wrote. He appeared
      to be interested in how a newspaper man would go about
      telling a story of this kind over a wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You start your story," he said, "and I'll come back and
      see if I can get the <i>Times</i> on the wire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies sat down and began his account. He was intent on
      describing things to date, the uncertainty and turmoil, the
      apparent victory of the sheriff. Plainly the courage of the
      latter had won, and it was all so picturesque. "A foiled
      lynching," he began, and as he wrote the obliging
      postmaster, who had by now returned, picked up the pages
      and carefully deciphered them for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right. I'll see if I can get the <i>Times</i>
      now," he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very obliging postmaster," thought Davies as he wrote, but
      he had so often encountered pleasant and obliging people on
      his rounds that he soon dropped that thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The food was brought, and still Davies wrote on, munching
      as he did so. In a little while the <i>Times</i> answered
      an often-repeated call.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Davies at Baldwin," ticked the postmaster, "get ready for
      quite a story!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let 'er go!" answered the operator at the <i>Times,</i>
      who had been expecting this dispatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the events of the day formulated themselves in his mind,
      Davies wrote and turned over page after page. Between
      whiles he looked out through the small window before him
      where afar off he could see a lonely light twinkling
      against a hillside. Not infrequently he stopped his work to
      see if anything new was happening, whether the situation
      was in any danger of changing, but apparently it was not.
      He then proposed to remain until all possibility of a
      tragedy, this night anyhow, was eliminated. The operator
      also wandered about, waiting for an accumulation of pages
      upon which he could work but making sure to keep up with
      the writer. The two became quite friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, his dispatch nearly finished, he asked the
      postmaster to caution the night editor at K-- to the
      effect, that if anything more happened before one in the
      morning he would file it, but not to expect anything more
      as nothing might happen. The reply came that he was to
      remain and await developments. Then he and the postmaster
      sat down to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eleven o'clock, when both had about convinced
      themselves that all was over for this night anyhow, and the
      lights in the village had all but vanished, a stillness of
      the purest, summery-est, country-est quality having settled
      down, a faint beating of hoofs, which seemed to suggest the
      approach of a large cavalcade, could be heard out on the
      Sand River pike as Davies by now had come to learn it was,
      back or northwest of the postoffice. At the sound the
      postmaster got up, as did Davies, both stepping outside and
      listening. On it came, and as the volume increased, the
      former said, "Might be help for the sheriff, but I doubt
      it. I telegraphed Clayton six times to-day. They wouldn't
      come that way, though. It's the wrong road." Now, thought
      Davies nervously, after all there might be something to add
      to his story, and he had so wished that it was all over!
      Lynchings, as he now felt, were horrible things. He wished
      people wouldn't do such things--take the law, which now
      more than ever he respected, into their own hands. It was
      too brutal, cruel. That negro cowering there in the dark
      probably, and the sheriff all taut and tense, worrying over
      his charge and his duty, were not happy things to
      contemplate in the face of such a thing as this. It was
      true that the crime which had been committed was dreadful,
      but still why couldn't people allow the law to take its
      course? It was so much better. The law was powerful enough
      to deal with cases of this kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're comin' back, all right," said the postmaster
      solemnly, as he and Davies stared in the direction of the
      sound which grew louder from moment to moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not any help from Clayton, I'm afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George, I think you're right!" answered the reporter,
      something telling him that more trouble was at hand. "Here
      they come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke there was a clattering of hoofs and crunching
      of saddle girths as a large company of men dashed up the
      road and turned into the narrow street of the village, the
      figure of Jake Whitaker and an older bearded man in a wide
      black hat riding side by side in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's Jake," said the postmaster, "and that's his father
      riding beside him there. The old man's a terror when he
      gets his dander up. Sompin's sure to happen now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies realized that in his absence writing a new turn had
      been given to things. Evidently the son had returned to
      Pleasant Valley and organized a new posse or gone out to
      meet his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the place was astir again. Lights appeared in
      doorways and windows, and both were thrown open. People
      were leaning or gazing out to see what new movement was
      afoot. Davies noted at once that there was none of the
      brash enthusiasm about this company such as had
      characterized the previous descent. There was grimness
      everywhere, and he now began to feel that this was the
      beginning of the end. After the cavalcade had passed down
      the street toward the sheriff's house, which was quite dark
      now, he ran after it, arriving a few moments after the
      former which was already in part dismounted. The
      townspeople followed. The sheriff, as it now developed, had
      not relaxed any of his vigilance, however; he was not
      sleeping, and as the crowd reappeared the light inside
      reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the light of the moon, which was almost overhead, Davies
      was able to make out several of his companions of the
      afternoon, and Jake, the son. There were many more, though,
      now, whom he did not know, and foremost among them this old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was strong, iron-gray, and wore a full beard. He
      looked very much like a blacksmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your eye on the old man," advised the postmaster, who
      had by now come up and was standing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were still looking, the old man went boldly
      forward to the little front porch of the house and knocked
      at the door. Some one lifted a curtain at the window and
      peeped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello, in there!" cried the old man, knocking again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want?" asked a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want that nigger!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can't have him! I've told you people that once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring him out or I'll break down the door!" said the old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do it's at your own risk. I know you, Whitaker, an'
      you know me. I'll give ye two minutes to get off that
      porch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want that nigger, I tell ye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If ye don't git off that porch I'll fire through the
      door," said the voice solemnly. "One--Two--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man backed cautiously away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come out, Mathews!" yelled the crowd. "You've got to give
      him up this time. We ain't goin' back without him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the door opened, as if the individual within were
      very well satisfied as to his power to handle the mob. He
      had done it once before this night, why not again? It
      revealed his tall form, armed with his shotgun. He looked
      around very stolidly, and then addressed the old man as one
      would a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye can't have him, Morgan," he said. "It's ag'in' the law.
      You know that as well as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Law or no law," said the old man, "I want that nigger!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you I can't let you have him, Morgan. It's ag'in'
      the law. You know you oughtn't to be comin' around here at
      this time o' night actin' so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll take him then," said the old man, making a
      move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand back!" shouted the sheriff, leveling his gun on the
      instant. "I'll blow ye into kingdom come, sure as hell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A noticeable movement on the part of the crowd ceased. The
      sheriff lowered his weapon as if he thought the danger were
      once more over.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You-all ought to be ashamed of yerselves," he went on, his
      voice sinking to a gentle neighborly reproof, "tryin' to
      upset the law this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The nigger didn't upset no law, did he?" asked one
      derisively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the law's goin' to take care of the nigger now,"
      Mathews made answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give us that scoundrel, Mathews; you'd better do it," said
      the old man. "It'll save a heap o' trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll not argue with ye, Morgan. I said ye couldn't have
      him, an' ye can't. If ye want bloodshed, all right. But
      don't blame me. I'll kill the first man that tries to make
      a move this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shifted his gun handily and waited. The crowd stood
      outside his little fence murmuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the old man retired and spoke to several others.
      There was more murmuring, and then he came back to the dead
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We don't want to cause trouble, Mathews," he began
      explanatively, moving his hand oratorically, "but we think
      you ought to see that it won't do any good to stand out. We
      think that--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies and the postmaster were watching young Jake, whose
      peculiar attitude attracted their attention. The latter was
      standing poised at the edge of the crowd, evidently seeking
      to remain unobserved. His eyes were on the sheriff, who was
      hearkening to the old man. Suddenly, as the father talked
      and when the sheriff seemed for a moment mollified and
      unsuspecting, he made a quick run for the porch. There was
      an intense movement all along the line as the life and
      death of the deed became apparent. Quickly the sheriff drew
      his gun to his shoulder. Both triggers were pressed at the
      same time, and the gun spoke, but not before Jake was in
      and under him. The latter had been in sufficient time to
      knock the gun barrel upward and fall upon his man. Both
      shots blazed harmlessly over the heads of the crowd in red
      puffs, and then followed a general onslaught. Men leaped
      the fence by tens and crowded upon the little cottage. They
      swarmed about every side of the house and crowded upon the
      porch, where four men were scuffling with the sheriff. The
      latter soon gave up, vowing vengeance and the law. Torches
      were brought, and a rope. A wagon drove up and was backed
      into the yard. Then began the calls for the negro.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Davies contemplated all this he could not help thinking
      of the negro who during all this turmoil must have been
      crouching in his corner in the cellar, trembling for his
      fate. Now indeed he must realize that his end was near. He
      could not have dozed or lost consciousness during the
      intervening hours, but must have been cowering there,
      wondering and praying. All the while he must have been
      terrified lest the sheriff might not get him away in time.
      Now, at the sound of horses' feet and the new murmurs of
      contention, how must his body quake and his teeth chatter!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd hate to be that nigger," commented the postmaster
      grimly, "but you can't do anything with 'em. The county
      oughta sent help."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's horrible, horrible!" was all Davies could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved closer to the house, with the crowd, eager to
      observe every detail of the procedure. Now it was that a
      number of the men, as eager in their search as bloodhounds,
      appeared at a low cellar entryway at the side of the house
      carrying a rope. Others followed with torches. Headed by
      father and son they began to descend into the dark hole.
      With impressive daring, Davies, who was by no means sure
      that he would be allowed but who was also determined if
      possible to see, followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, in the farthest corner, he espied Ingalls. The
      latter in his fear and agony had worked himself into a
      crouching position, as if he were about to spring. His
      nails were apparently forced into the earth. His eyes were
      rolling, his mouth foaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my Lawd, boss," he moaned, gazing almost as one blind,
      at the lights, "oh, my Lawd, boss, don't kill me! I won't
      do it no mo'. I didn't go to do it. I didn't mean to dis
      time. I was just drunk, boss. Oh, my Lawd! My Lawd!" His
      teeth chattered the while his mouth seemed to gape open. He
      was no longer sane really, but kept repeating monotonously,
      "Oh, my Lawd!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here he is, boys! Pull him out," cried the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negro now gave one yell of terror and collapsed,
      falling prone. He quite bounded as he did so, coming down
      with a dead chug on the earthen floor. Reason had forsaken
      him. He was by now a groveling, foaming brute. The last
      gleam of intelligence was that which notified him of the
      set eyes of his pursuers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies, who by now had retreated to the grass outside
      before this sight, was standing but ten feet back when they
      began to reappear after seizing and binding him. Although
      shaken to the roots of his being, he still had all the cool
      observing powers of the trained and relentless reporter.
      Even now he noted the color values of the scene, the red,
      smoky heads of the torches, the disheveled appearance of
      the men, the scuffling and pulling. Then all at once he
      clapped his hands over his mouth, almost unconscious of
      what he was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my God!" he whispered, his voice losing power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sickening sight was that of the negro, foaming at the
      mouth, bloodshot as to his eyes, his hands working
      convulsively, being dragged up the cellar steps feet
      foremost. They had tied a rope about his waist and feet,
      and so had hauled him out, leaving his head to hang and
      drag. The black face was distorted beyond all human
      semblance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my God!" said Davies again, biting his fingers
      unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd gathered about now more closely than ever, more
      horror-stricken than gleeful at their own work. None
      apparently had either the courage or the charity to gainsay
      what was being done. With a kind of mechanical deftness now
      the negro was rudely lifted and like a sack of wheat thrown
      into the wagon. Father and son now mounted in front to
      drive and the crowd took to their horses, content to
      clatter, a silent cavalcade, behind. As Davies afterwards
      concluded, they were not so much hardened lynchers perhaps
      as curious spectators, the majority of them, eager for any
      variation--any excuse for one--to the dreary commonplaces
      of their existences. The task to most--all indeed--was
      entirely new. Wide-eyed and nerve-racked, Davies ran for
      his own horse and mounting followed. He was so excited he
      scarcely knew what he was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the silent company now took its way up the Sand
      River pike whence it had come. The moon was still high,
      pouring down a wash of silvery light. As Davies rode he
      wondered how he was to complete his telegram, but decided
      that he could not. When this was over there would be no
      time. How long would it be before they would really hang
      him? And would they? The whole procedure seemed so unreal,
      so barbaric that he could scarcely believe it--that he was
      a part of it. Still they rode on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they really going to hang him?" he asked of one who
      rode beside him, a total stranger who seemed however not to
      resent his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what they got 'im fer," answered the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      And think, he thought to himself, to-morrow night he would
      be resting in his own good bed back in K--!
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies dropped behind again and into silence and tried to
      recover his nerves. He could scarcely realize that he,
      ordinarily accustomed to the routine of the city, its
      humdrum and at least outward social regularity, was a part
      of this. The night was so soft, the air so refreshing. The
      shadowy trees were stirring with a cool night wind. Why
      should any one have to die this way? Why couldn't the
      people of Baldwin or elsewhere have bestirred themselves on
      the side of the law before this, just let it take its
      course? Both father and son now seemed brutal, the injury
      to the daughter and sister not so vital as all this. Still,
      also, custom seemed to require death in this way for this.
      It was like some axiomatic, mathematic law--hard, but
      custom. The silent company, an articulated, mechanical and
      therefore terrible thing, moved on. It also was axiomatic,
      mathematic. After a time he drew near to the wagon and
      looked at the negro again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, as Davies was glad to note, seemed still out of
      his sense. He was breathing heavily and groaning, but
      probably not with any conscious pain. His eyes were fixed
      and staring, his face and hands bleeding as if they had
      been scratched or trampled upon. He was crumpled limply.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Davies could stand it no longer now. He fell back, sick
      at heart, content to see no more. It seemed a ghastly,
      murderous thing to do. Still the company moved on and he
      followed, past fields lit white by the moon, under dark,
      silent groups of trees, through which the moonlight fell in
      patches, up low hills and down into valleys, until at last
      a little stream came into view, the same little stream, as
      it proved, which he had seen earlier to-day and for a
      bridge over which they were heading. Here it ran now,
      sparkling like electricity in the night. After a time the
      road drew closer to the water and then crossed directly
      over the bridge, which could be seen a little way ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this the company now rode and then halted. The wagon
      was driven up on the bridge, and father and son got out.
      All the riders, including Davies, dismounted, and a full
      score of them gathered about the wagon from which the negro
      was lifted, quite as one might a bag. Fortunately, as
      Davies now told himself, he was still unconscious, an
      accidental mercy. Nevertheless he decided now that he could
      not witness the end, and went down by the waterside
      slightly above the bridge. He was not, after all, the
      utterly relentless reporter. From where he stood, however,
      he could see long beams of iron projecting out over the
      water, where the bridge was braced, and some of the men
      fastening a rope to a beam, and then he could see that they
      were fixing the other end around the negro's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the curious company stood back, and he turned his
      face away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you anything to say?" a voice demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer. The negro was probably lolling and
      groaning, quite as unconscious as he was before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the concerted action of a dozen men, the lifting
      of the black mass into the air, and then Davies saw the
      limp form plunge down and pull up with a creaking sound of
      rope. In the weak moonlight it seemed as if the body were
      struggling, but he could not tell. He watched, wide-mouthed
      and silent, and then the body ceased moving. Then after a
      time he heard the company making ready to depart, and
      finally it did so, leaving him quite indifferently to
      himself and his thoughts. Only the black mass swaying in
      the pale light over the glimmering water seemed human and
      alive, his sole companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down upon the bank and gazed in silence. Now the
      horror was gone. The suffering was ended. He was no longer
      afraid. Everything was summery and beautiful. The whole
      cavalcade had disappeared; the moon finally sank. His
      horse, tethered to a sapling beyond the bridge, waited
      patiently. Still he sat. He might now have hurried back to
      the small postoffice in Baldwin and attempted to file
      additional details of this story, providing he could find
      Seavey, but it would have done no good. It was quite too
      late, and anyhow what did it matter? No other reporter had
      been present, and he could write a fuller, sadder, more
      colorful story on the morrow. He wondered idly what had
      become of Seavey? Why had he not followed? Life seemed so
      sad, so strange, so mysterious, so inexplicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he still sat there the light of morning broke, a tender
      lavender and gray in the east. Then came the roseate hues
      of dawn, all the wondrous coloring of celestial halls, to
      which the waters of the stream responded. The white pebbles
      shone pinkily at the bottom, the grass and sedges first
      black now gleamed a translucent green. Still the body hung
      there black and limp against the sky, and now a light
      breeze sprang up and stirred it visibly. At last he arose,
      mounted his horse and made his way back to Pleasant Valley,
      too full of the late tragedy to be much interested in
      anything else. Rousing his liveryman, he adjusted his
      difficulties with him by telling him the whole story,
      assuring him of his horse's care and handing him a
      five-dollar bill. Then he left, to walk and think again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since there was no train before noon and his duty plainly
      called him to a portion of another day's work here, he
      decided to make a day of it, idling about and getting
      additional details as to what further might be done. Who
      would cut the body down? What about arresting the
      lynchers--the father and son, for instance? What about the
      sheriff now? Would he act as he threatened? If he
      telegraphed the main fact of the lynching his city editor
      would not mind, he knew, his coming late, and the day here
      was so beautiful. He proceeded to talk with citizens and
      officials, rode out to the injured girl's home, rode to
      Baldwin to see the sheriff. There was a singular silence
      and placidity in that corner. The latter assured him that
      he knew nearly all of those who had taken part, and
      proposed to swear out warrants for them, but just the same
      Davies noted that he took his defeat as he did his danger,
      philosophically. There was no real activity in that corner
      later. He wished to remain a popular sheriff, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was sundown again before he remembered that he had not
      discovered whether the body had been removed. Nor had he
      heard why the negro came back, nor exactly how he was
      caught. A nine o'clock evening train to the city giving him
      a little more time for investigation, he decided to avail
      himself of it. The negro's cabin was two miles out along a
      pine-shaded road, but so pleasant was the evening that he
      decided to walk. En route, the last rays of the sinking sun
      stretched long shadows of budding trees across his path. It
      was not long before he came upon the cabin, a one-story
      affair set well back from the road and surrounded with a
      few scattered trees. By now it was quite dark. The ground
      between the cabin and the road was open, and strewn with
      the chips of a woodpile. The roof was sagged, and the
      windows patched in places, but for all that it had the glow
      of a home. Through the front door, which stood open, the
      blaze of a wood-fire might be seen, its yellow light
      filling the interior with a golden glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hesitating before the door, Davies finally knocked.
      Receiving no answer he looked in on the battered cane
      chairs and aged furniture with considerable interest. It
      was a typical negro cabin, poor beyond the need of
      description. After a time a door in the rear of the room
      opened and a little negro girl entered carrying a battered
      tin lamp without any chimney. She had not heard his knock
      and started perceptibly at the sight of his figure in the
      doorway. Then she raised her smoking lamp above her head in
      order to see better, and approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something ridiculous about her unformed figure
      and loose gingham dress, as he noted. Her feet and hands
      were so large. Her black head was strongly emphasized by
      little pigtails of hair done up in white twine, which stood
      out all over her head. Her dark skin was made apparently
      more so by contrast with her white teeth and the whites of
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies looked at her for a moment but little moved now by
      the oddity which ordinarily would have amused him, and
      asked, "Is this where Ingalls lived?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl nodded her head. She was exceedingly subdued, and
      looked as if she might have been crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has the body been brought here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, suh," she answered, with a soft negro accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did they bring it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dis moanin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you his sister?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, suh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, can you tell me how they caught him? When did he
      come back, and what for?" He was feeling slightly ashamed
      to intrude thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In de afternoon, about two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what for?" repeated Davies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To see us," answered the girl. "To see my motha'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, did he want anything? He didn't come just to see
      her, did he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, suh," said the girl, "he come to say good-by. We doan
      know when dey caught him." Her voice wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, didn't he know he might get caught?" asked Davies
      sympathetically, seeing that the girl was so moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, suh, I think he did."
    </p>
    <p>
      She still stood very quietly holding the poor battered lamp
      up, and looking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what did he have to say?" asked Davies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn' have nothin' much to say, suh. He said he wanted
      to see motha'. He was a-goin' away."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl seemed to regard Davies as an official of some
      sort, and he knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I have a look at the body?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not answer, but started as if to lead the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When is the funeral?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tomorra'."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl then led him through several bare sheds of rooms
      strung in a row to the furthermost one of the line. This
      last seemed a sort of storage shed for odds and ends. It
      had several windows, but they were quite bare of glass and
      open to the moonlight save for a few wooden boards nailed
      across from the outside. Davies had been wondering all the
      while where the body was and at the lonely and forsaken air
      of the place. No one but this little pig-tailed girl seemed
      about. If they had any colored neighbors they were probably
      afraid to be seen here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as he stepped into this cool, dark, exposed outer
      room, the desolation seemed quite complete. It was very
      bare, a mere shed or wash-room. There was the body in the
      middle of the room, stretched upon an ironing board which
      rested on a box and a chair, and covered with a white
      sheet. All the corners of the room were quite dark. Only
      its middle was brightened by splotches of silvery light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies came forward, the while the girl left him, still
      carrying her lamp. Evidently she thought the moon lighted
      up the room sufficiently, and she did not feel equal to
      remaining. He lifted the sheet quite boldly, for he could
      see well enough, and looked at the still, black form. The
      face was extremely distorted, even in death, and he could
      see where the rope had tightened. A bar of cool moonlight
      lay just across the face and breast He was still looking,
      thinking soon to restore the covering, when a sound, half
      sigh, half groan, reached his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      At it he started as if a ghost had made it. It was so eerie
      and unexpected in this dark place. His muscles tightened.
      Instantly his heart went hammering like mad. His first
      impression was that it must have come from the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oo-o-ohh!" came the sound again, this time whimpering, as
      if some one were crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly he turned, for now it seemed to come from a
      corner of the room, the extreme corner to his right, back
      of him. Greatly disturbed, he approached, and then as his
      eyes strained he seemed to catch the shadow of something,
      the figure of a woman, perhaps, crouching against the
      walls, huddled up, dark, almost indistinguishable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh, oh!" the sound now repeated itself, even more
      plaintively than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies began to understand. He approached slowly, then more
      swiftly desired to withdraw, for he was in the presence of
      an old black mammy, doubled up and weeping. She was in the
      very niche of the two walls, her head sunk on her knees,
      her body quite still. "Oh, oh, oh!" she repeated, as he
      stood there near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davies drew silently back. Before such grief his intrusion
      seemed cold and unwarranted. The guiltlessness of the
      mother--her love--how could one balance that against the
      other? The sensation of tears came to his eyes. He
      instantly covered the dead and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the moonlight he struck a brisk pace, but soon
      stopped and looked back. The whole dreary cabin, with its
      one golden eye, the door, seemed such a pitiful thing. The
      weeping mammy, alone in her corner--and he had come back to
      say "Good-by!" Davies swelled with feeling. The night, the
      tragedy, the grief, he saw it all. But also with the cruel
      instinct of the budding artist that he already was, he was
      beginning to meditate on the character of story it would
      make--the color, the pathos. The knowledge now that it was
      not always exact justice that was meted out to all and that
      it was not so much the business of the writer to indict as
      to interpret was borne in on him with distinctness by the
      cruel sorrow of the mother, whose blame, if any, was
      infinitesimal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get it all in!" he exclaimed feelingly, if
      triumphantly at last. "I'll get it all in!"

      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      They lived together in a part of the country which was not
      so prosperous as it had once been, about three miles from
      one of those small towns that, instead of increasing in
      population, is steadily decreasing. The territory was not
      very thickly settled; perhaps a house every other mile or
      so, with large areas of corn- and wheat-land and fallow
      fields that at odd seasons had been sown to timothy and
      clover. Their particular house was part log and part frame,
      the log portion being the old original home of Henry's
      grandfather. The new portion, of now rain-beaten,
      time-worn slabs, through which the wind squeaked in the
      chinks at times, and which several overshadowing elms and a
      butternut-tree made picturesque and reminiscently pathetic,
      but a little damp, was erected by Henry when he was
      twenty-one and just married.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was forty-eight years before. The furniture inside,
      like the house outside, was old and mildewy and reminiscent
      of an earlier day. You have seen the what-not of cherry
      wood, perhaps, with spiral legs and fluted top. It was
      there. The old-fashioned four poster bed, with its
      ball-like protuberances and deep curving incisions, was
      there also, a sadly alienated descendant of an early
      Jacobean ancestor. The bureau of cherry was also high and
      wide and solidly built, but faded-looking, and with a musty
      odor. The rag carpet that underlay all these sturdy
      examples of enduring furniture was a weak, faded,
      lead-and-pink-colored affair woven by Ph&oelig;be Ann's own
      hands, when she was fifteen years younger than she was when
      she died. The creaky wooden loom on which it had been done
      now stood like a dusty, bony skeleton, along with a broken
      rocking-chair, a worm-eaten clothes-press--Heaven knows how
      old--a lime-stained bench that had once been used to keep
      flowers on outside the door, and other decrepit factors of
      household utility, in an east room that was a lean-to
      against this so-called main portion. All sorts of other
      broken-down furniture were about this place; an antiquated
      clothes-horse, cracked in two of its ribs; a broken mirror
      in an old cherry frame, which had fallen from a nail and
      cracked itself three days before their youngest son, Jerry,
      died; an extension hat-rack, which once had had porcelain
      knobs on the ends of its pegs; and a sewing- machine, long
      since outdone in its clumsy mechanism by rivals of a newer
      generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orchard to the east of the house was full of gnarled
      old apple-trees, worm-eaten as to trunks and branches, and
      fully ornamented with green and white lichens, so that it
      had a sad, greenish-white, silvery effect in moonlight. The
      low outhouses, which had once housed chickens, a horse or
      two, a cow, and several pigs, were covered with patches of
      moss as to their roof, and the sides had been free of paint
      for so long that they were blackish gray as to color, and a
      little spongy. The picket-fence in front, with its gate
      squeaky and askew, and the side fences of the
      stake-and-rider type were in an equally run-down condition.
      As a matter of fact, they had aged synchronously with the
      persons who lived here, old Henry Reifsneider and his wife
      Ph&oelig;be Ann.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had lived here, these two, ever since their marriage,
      forty-eight years before, and Henry had lived here before
      that from his childhood up. His father and mother, well
      along in years when he was a boy, had invited him to bring
      his wife here when he had first fallen in love and decided
      to marry; and he had done so. His father and mother were
      the companions of himself and his wife for ten years after
      they were married, when both died; and then Henry and
      Ph&oelig;be were left with their five children growing
      lustily apace. But all sorts of things had happened since
      then. Of the seven children, all told, that had been born
      to them, three had died; one girl had gone to Kansas; one
      boy had gone to Sioux Falls, never even to be heard of
      after; another boy had gone to Washington; and the last
      girl lived five counties away in the same State, but was so
      burdened with cares of her own that she rarely gave them a
      thought. Time and a commonplace home life that had never
      been attractive had weaned them thoroughly, so that,
      wherever they were, they gave little thought as to how it
      might be with their father and mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Henry Reifsneider and his wife Ph&oelig;be were a
      loving couple. You perhaps know how it is with simple
      natures that fasten themselves like lichens on the stones
      of circumstance and weather their days to a crumbling
      conclusion. The great world sounds widely, but it has no
      call for them. They have no soaring intellect. The orchard,
      the meadow, the cornfield, the pig-pen, and the chicken-lot
      measure the range of their human activities. When the wheat
      is headed it is reaped and threshed; when the corn is
      browned and frosted it is cut and shocked; when the timothy
      is in full head it is cut, and the hay-cock erected. After
      that comes winter, with the hauling of grain to market, the
      sawing and splitting of wood, the simple chores of
      fire-building, meal-getting, occasional repairing, and
      visiting. Beyond these and the changes of weather--the
      snows, the rains, and the fair days--there are no
      immediate, significant things. All the rest of life is a
      far-off, clamorous phantasmagoria, flickering like Northern
      lights in the night, and sounding as faintly as cow-bells
      tinkling in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Henry and his wife Ph&oelig;be were as fond of each
      other as it is possible for two old people to be who have
      nothing else in this life to be fond of. He was a thin old
      man, seventy when she died, a queer, crotchety person with
      coarse gray-black hair and beard, quite straggly and
      unkempt. He looked at you out of dull, fishy, watery eyes
      that had deep-brown crow's-feet at the sides. His clothes,
      like the clothes of many farmers, were aged and angular and
      baggy, standing out at the pockets, not fitting about the
      neck, protuberant and worn at elbow and knee. Ph&oelig;be
      Ann was thin and shapeless, a very umbrella of a woman,
      clad in shabby black, and with a black bonnet for her best
      wear. As time had passed, and they had only themselves to
      look after, their movements had become slower and slower,
      their activities fewer and fewer. The annual keep of pigs
      had been reduced from five to one grunting porker, and the
      single horse which Henry now retained was a sleepy animal,
      not over-nourished and not very clean. The chickens, of
      which formerly there was a large flock, had almost
      disappeared, owing to ferrets, foxes, and the lack of
      proper care, which produces disease. The former healthy
      garden was now a straggling memory of itself, and the vines
      and flower-beds that formerly ornamented the windows and
      dooryard had now become choking thickets. A will had been
      made which divided the small tax-eaten property equally
      among the remaining four, so that it was really of no
      interest to any of them. Yet these two lived together in
      peace and sympathy, only that now and then old Henry would
      become unduly cranky, complaining almost invariably that
      something had been neglected or mislaid which was of no
      importance at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ph&oelig;be, where's my corn-knife? You ain't never minded
      to let my things alone no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you hush, Henry," his wife would caution him in a
      cracked and squeaky voice. "If you don't, I'll leave yuh.
      I'll git up and walk out of here some day, and then where
      would y' be? Y' ain't got anybody but me to look after yuh,
      so yuh just behave yourself. Your corn knife's on the
      mantel where it's allus been unless you've gone an' put it
      summers else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Henry, who knew his wife would never leave him in any
      circumstances, used to speculate at times as to what he
      would do if she were to die. That was the one leaving that
      he really feared. As he climbed on the chair at night to
      wind the old, long-pendulumed, double-weighted clock, or
      went finally to the front and the back door to see that
      they were safely shut in, it was a comfort to know that
      Ph&oelig;be was there, properly ensconced on her side of
      the bed, and that if he stirred restlessly in the night,
      she would be there to ask what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Henry, do lie still! You're as restless as a
      chicken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can't sleep, Ph&oelig;be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yuh needn't roll so, anyhow. Yuh kin let me sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      This usually reduced him to a state of somnolent ease. If
      she wanted a pail of water, it was a grumbling pleasure for
      him to get it; and if she did rise first to build the
      fires, he saw that the wood was cut and placed within easy
      reach. They divided this simple world nicely between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the years had gone on, however, fewer and fewer people
      had called. They were well-known for a distance of as much
      as ten square miles as old Mr. and Mrs. Reifsneider,
      honest, moderately Christian, but too old to be really
      interesting any longer. The writing of letters had become
      an almost impossible burden too difficult to continue or
      even negotiate via others, although an occasional letter
      still did arrive from the daughter in Pemberton County. Now
      and then some old friend stopped with a pie or cake or a
      roasted chicken or duck, or merely to see that they were
      well; but even these kindly minded visits were no longer
      frequent.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in the early spring of her sixty-fourth year Mrs.
      Reifsneider took sick, and from a low fever passed into
      some indefinable ailment which, because of her age, was no
      longer curable. Old Henry drove to Swinnerton, the
      neighboring town, and procured a doctor. Some friends
      called, and the immediate care of her was taken off his
      hands. Then one chill spring night she died, and old Henry,
      in a fog of sorrow and uncertainty, followed her body to
      the nearest graveyard, an unattractive space with a few
      pines growing in it. Although he might have gone to the
      daughter in Pemberton or sent for her, it was really too
      much trouble and he was too weary and fixed. It was
      suggested to him at once by one friend and another that he
      come to stay with them awhile, but he did not see fit. He
      was so old and so fixed in his notions and so accustomed to
      the exact surroundings he had known all his days, that he
      could not think of leaving. He wanted to remain near where
      they had put his Ph&oelig;be; and the fact that he would
      have to live alone did not trouble him in the least. The
      living children were notified and the care of him offered
      if he would leave, but he would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I kin make a shift for myself," he continually announced
      to old Dr. Morrow, who had attended his wife in this case.
      "I kin cook a little, and, besides, it don't take much
      more'n coffee an' bread in the mornin's to satisfy me. I'll
      get along now well enough. Yuh just let me be." And after
      many pleadings and proffers of advice, with supplies of
      coffee and bacon and baked bread duly offered and accepted,
      he was left to himself. For a while he sat idly outside his
      door brooding in the spring sun. He tried to revive his
      interest in farming, and to keep himself busy and free from
      thought by looking after the fields, which of late had been
      much neglected. It was a gloomy thing to come in of an
      evening, however, or in the afternoon and find no shadow of
      Ph&oelig;be where everything suggested her. By degrees he
      put a few of her things away. At night he sat beside his
      lamp and read in the papers that were left him occasionally
      or in a Bible that he had neglected for years, but he could
      get little solace from these things. Mostly he held his
      hand over his mouth and looked at the floor as he sat and
      thought of what had become of her, and how soon he himself
      would die. He made a great business of making his coffee in
      the morning and frying himself a little bacon at night; but
      his appetite was gone. The shell in which he had been
      housed so long seemed vacant, and its shadows were
      suggestive of immedicable griefs. So he lived quite
      dolefully for five long months, and then a change began.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one night, after he had looked after the front and
      the back door, wound the clock, blown out the light, and
      gone through all the selfsame motions that he had indulged
      in for years, that he went to bed not so much to sleep as
      to think. It was a moonlight night. The
      green-lichen-covered orchard just outside and to be seen
      from his bed where he now lay was a silvery affair, sweetly
      spectral. The moon shone through the east windows, throwing
      the pattern of the panes on the wooden floor, and making
      the old furniture, to which he was accustomed, stand out
      dimly in the room. As usual he had been thinking of
      Ph&oelig;be and the years when they had been young
      together, and of the children who had gone, and the poor
      shift he was making of his present days. The house was
      coming to be in a very bad state indeed. The bed-clothes
      were in disorder and not clean, for he made a wretched
      shift of washing. It was a terror to him. The roof leaked,
      causing things, some of them, to remain damp for weeks at a
      time, but he was getting into that brooding state where he
      would accept anything rather than exert himself. He
      preferred to pace slowly to and fro or to sit and think.
    </p>
    <p>
      By twelve o'clock of this particular night he was asleep,
      however, and by two had waked again. The moon by this time
      had shifted to a position on the western side of the house,
      and it now shone in through the windows of the living-room
      and those of the kitchen beyond. A certain combination of
      furniture--a chair near a table, with his coat on it, the
      half-open kitchen door casting a shadow, and the position
      of a lamp near a paper--gave him an exact representation of
      Ph&oelig;be leaning over the table as he had often seen her
      do in life. It gave him a great start. Could it be she--or
      her ghost? He had scarcely ever believed in spirits; and
      still He looked at her fixedly in the feeble half-light,
      his old hair tingling oddly at the roots, and then sat up.
      The figure did not move. He put his thin legs out of the
      bed and sat looking at her, wondering if this could really
      be Ph&oelig;be. They had talked of ghosts often in their
      lifetime, of apparitions and omens; but they had never
      agreed that such things could be. It had never been a part
      of his wife's creed that she could have a spirit that could
      return to walk the earth. Her after-world was quite a
      different affair, a vague heaven, no less, from which the
      righteous did not trouble to return. Yet here she was now,
      bending over the table in her black skirt and gray shawl,
      her pale profile outlined against the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ph&oelig;be," he called, thrilling from head to toe and
      putting out one bony hand, "have yuh come back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure did not stir, and he arose and walked
      uncertainly to the door, looking at it fixedly the while.
      As he drew near, however, the apparition resolved itself
      into its primal content--his old coat over the high-backed
      chair, the lamp by the paper, the half-open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said to himself, his mouth open, "I thought
      shore I saw her." And he ran his hand strangely and vaguely
      through his hair, the while his nervous tension relaxed.
      Vanished as it had, it gave him the idea that she might
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another night, because of this first illusion, and because
      his mind was now constantly on her and he was old, he
      looked out of the window that was nearest his bed and
      commanded a hen-coop and pig-pen and a part of the
      wagon-shed, and there, a faint mist exuding from the damp
      of the ground, he thought he saw her again. It was one of
      those little wisps of mist, one of those faint exhalations
      of the earth that rise in a cool night after a warm day,
      and flicker like small white cypresses of fog before they
      disappear. In life it had been a custom of hers to cross
      this lot from her kitchen door to the pig-pen to throw in
      any scrap that was left from her cooking, and here she was
      again. He sat up and watched it strangely, doubtfully,
      because of his previous experience, but inclined, because
      of the nervous titillation that passed over his body, to
      believe that spirits really were, and that Ph&oelig;be, who
      would be concerned because of his lonely state, must be
      thinking about him, and hence returning. What other way
      would she have? How otherwise could she express herself? It
      would be within the province of her charity so to do, and
      like her loving interest in him. He quivered and watched it
      eagerly; but, a faint breath of air stirring, it wound away
      toward the fence and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third night, as he was actually dreaming, some ten days
      later, she came to his bedside and put her hand on his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Henry!" she said. "It's too bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused out of his sleep, actually to see her, he
      thought, moving from his bed-room into the one living-room,
      her figure a shadowy mass of black. The weak straining of
      his eyes caused little points of light to flicker about the
      outlines of her form. He arose, greatly astonished, walked
      the floor in the cool room, convinced that Ph&oelig;be was
      coming back to him. If he only thought sufficiently, if he
      made it perfectly clear by his feeling that he needed her
      greatly, she would come back, this kindly wife, and tell
      him what to do. She would perhaps be with him much of the
      time, in the night, anyhow; and that would make him less
      lonely, this state more endurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In age and with the feeble it is not such a far cry from
      the subtleties of illusion to actual hallucination, and in
      due time this transition was made for Henry. Night after
      night he waited, expecting her return. Once in his weird
      mood he thought he saw a pale light moving about the room,
      and another time he thought he saw her walking in the
      orchard after dark. It was one morning when the details of
      his lonely state were virtually unendurable that he woke
      with the thought that she was not dead. How he had arrived
      at this conclusion it is hard to say. His mind had gone. In
      its place was a fixed illusion. He and Ph&oelig;be had had
      a senseless quarrel. He had reproached her for not leaving
      his pipe where he was accustomed to find it, and she had
      left. It was an aberrated fulfillment of her old jesting
      threat that if he did not behave himself she would leave
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I guess I could find yuh ag'in," he had always said. But
      her cackling threat had always been:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yuh'll not find me if I ever leave yuh. I guess I kin git
      some place where yuh can't find me."
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning when he arose he did not think to build the
      fire in the customary way or to grind his coffee and cut
      his bread, as was his wont, but solely to meditate as to
      where he should search for her and how he should induce her
      to come back. Recently the one horse had been dispensed
      with because he found it cumbersome and beyond his needs.
      He took down his soft crush hat after he had dressed
      himself, a new glint of interest and determination in his
      eye, and taking his black crook cane from behind the door,
      where he had always placed it, started out briskly to look
      for her among the nearest neighbors. His old shoes clumped
      soundly in the dust as he walked, and his gray-black locks,
      now grown rather long, straggled out in a dramatic fringe
      or halo from under his hat. His short coat stirred busily
      as he walked, and his hands and face were peaked and pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, hello, Henry! Where're yuh goin' this mornin'?"
      inquired Farmer Dodge, who, hauling a load of wheat to
      market, encountered him on the public road. He had not seen
      the aged farmer in months, not since his wife's death, and
      he wondered now, seeing him looking so spry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yuh ain't seen Ph&oelig;be, have yuh?" inquired the old
      man, looking up quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ph&oelig;be who?" inquired Farmer Dodge, not for the
      moment connecting the name with Henry's dead wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my wife Ph&oelig;be, o' course. Who do yuh s'pose I
      mean?" He stared up with a pathetic sharpness of glance
      from under his shaggy, gray eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wall, I'll swan, Henry, yuh ain't jokin', are yuh?" said
      the solid Dodge, a pursy man, with a smooth, hard, red
      face. "It can't be your wife yuh're talkin' about. She's
      dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead! Shucks!" retorted the demented Reifsneider. "She
      left me early this mornin', while I was sleepin'. She allus
      got up to build the fire, but she's gone now. We had a
      little spat last night, an' I guess that's the reason. But
      I guess I kin find her. She's gone over to Matilda Race's;
      that's where she's gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      He started briskly up the road, leaving the amazed Dodge to
      stare in wonder after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll be switched!" he said aloud to himself. "He's
      clean out'n his head. That poor old feller's been livin'
      down there till he's gone outen his mind. I'll have to
      notify the authorities." And he flicked his whip with great
      enthusiasm. "Geddap!" he said, and was off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reifsneider met no one else in this poorly populated region
      until he reached the whitewashed fence of Matilda Race and
      her husband three miles away. He had passed several other
      houses en route, but these not being within the range of
      his illusion were not considered. His wife, who had known
      Matilda well, must be here. He opened the picket-gate which
      guarded the walk, and stamped briskly up to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mr. Reifsneider," exclaimed old Matilda herself, a
      stout woman, looking out of the door in answer to his
      knock, "what brings yuh here this mornin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Ph&oelig;be here?" he demanded eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ph&oelig;be who? What Ph&oelig;be?" replied Mrs. Race,
      curious as to this sudden development of energy on his
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my Ph&oelig;be, o' course. My wife Ph&oelig;be. Who
      do yuh s'pose? Ain't she here now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lawsy me!" exclaimed Mrs. Race, opening her mouth. "Yuh
      pore man! So you're clean out'n your mind now. Yuh come
      right in and sit down. I'll git yuh a cup o' coffee. O'
      course your wife ain't here; but yuh come in an' sit down.
      I'll find her fer yuh after a while. I know where she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old farmer's eyes softened, and he entered. He was so
      thin and pale a specimen, pantalooned and patriarchal, that
      he aroused Mrs. Race's extremest sympathy as he took off
      his hat and laid it on his knees quite softly and mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had a quarrel last night, an' she left me," he
      volunteered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Laws! laws!" sighed Mrs. Race, there being no one present
      with whom to share her astonishment as she went to her
      kitchen. "The pore man! Now somebody's just got to look
      after him. He can't be allowed to run around the country
      this way lookin' for his dead wife. It's turrible."
    </p>
    <p>
      She boiled him a pot of coffee and brought in some of her
      new-baked bread and fresh butter. She set out some of her
      best jam and put a couple of eggs to boil, lying
      whole-heartedly the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now yuh stay right there, Uncle Henry, till Jake comes in,
      an' I'll send him to look for Ph&oelig;be. I think it's
      more'n likely she's over to Swinnerton with some o' her
      friends. Anyhow, we'll find out. Now yuh just drink this
      coffee an' eat this bread. Yuh must be tired. Yuh've had a
      long walk this mornin'." Her idea was to take counsel with
      Jake, "her man," and perhaps have him notify the
      authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bustled about, meditating on the uncertainties of life,
      while old Reifsneider thrummed on the rim of his hat with
      his pale fingers and later ate abstractedly of what she
      offered. His mind was on his wife, however, and since she
      was not here, or did not appear, it wandered vaguely away
      to a family by the name of Murray, miles away in another
      direction. He decided after a time that he would not wait
      for Jake Race to hunt his wife but would seek her for
      himself. He must be on, and urge her to come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll be goin'," he said, getting up and looking
      strangely about him. "I guess she didn't come here after
      all. She went over to the Murrays', I guess. I'll not wait
      any longer, Mis' Race. There's a lot to do over to the
      house to-day." And out he marched in the face of her
      protests taking to the dusty road again in the warm spring
      sun, his cane striking the earth as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two hours later that this pale figure of a man
      appeared in the Murrays' doorway, dusty, perspiring, eager.
      He had tramped all of five miles, and it was noon. An
      amazed husband and wife of sixty heard his strange query,
      and realized also that he was mad. They begged him to stay
      to dinner, intending to notify the authorities later and
      see what could be done; but though he stayed to partake of
      a little something, he did not stay long, and was off again
      to another distant farmhouse, his idea of many things to do
      and his need of Ph&oelig;be impelling him. So it went for
      that day and the next and the next, the circle of his
      inquiry ever widening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process by which a character assumes the significance
      of being peculiar, his antics weird, yet harmless, in such
      a community is often involute and pathetic. This day, as
      has been said, saw Reifsneider at other doors, eagerly
      asking his unnatural question, and leaving a trail of
      amazement, sympathy, and pity in his wake. Although the
      authorities were informed--the county sheriff, no less--it
      was not deemed advisable to take him into custody; for when
      those who knew old Henry, and had for so long, reflected on
      the condition of the county insane asylum, a place which,
      because of the poverty of the district, was of staggering
      aberration and sickening environment, it was decided to let
      him remain at large; for, strange to relate, it was found
      on investigation that at night he returned peaceably enough
      to his lonesome domicile there to discover whether his wife
      had returned, and to brood in loneliness until the morning.
      Who would lock up a thin, eager, seeking old man with
      iron-gray hair and an attitude of kindly, innocent inquiry,
      particularly when he was well known for a past of only
      kindly servitude and reliability? Those who had known him
      best rather agreed that he should be allowed to roam at
      large. He could do no harm. There were many who were
      willing to help him as to food, old clothes, the odds and
      ends of his daily life--at least at first. His figure after
      a time became not so much a common-place as an accepted
      curiosity, and the replies, "Why, no, Henry; I ain't see
      her," or "No, Henry; she ain't been here to-day," more
      customary.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several years thereafter then he was an odd figure in
      the sun and rain, on dusty roads and muddy ones,
      encountered occasionally in strange and unexpected places,
      pursuing his endless search. Undernourishment, after a
      time, although the neighbors and those who knew his history
      gladly contributed from their store, affected his body; for
      he walked much and ate little. The longer he roamed the
      public highway in this manner, the deeper became his
      strange hallucination; and finding it harder and harder to
      return from his more and more distant pilgrimages, he
      finally began taking a few utensils with him from his home,
      making a small package of them, in order that he might not
      be compelled to return. In an old tin coffee-pot of large
      size he placed a small tin cup, a knife, fork, and spoon,
      some salt and pepper, and to the outside of it, by a string
      forced through a pierced hole, he fastened a plate, which
      could be released, and which was his woodland table. It was
      no trouble for him to secure the little food that he
      needed, and with a strange, almost religious dignity, he
      had no hesitation in asking for that much. By degrees his
      hair became longer and longer, his once black hat became an
      earthen brown, and his clothes threadbare and dusty.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all of three years he walked, and none knew how wide
      were his perambulations, nor how he survived the storms and
      cold. They could not see him, with homely rural
      understanding and forethought, sheltering himself in
      hay-cocks, or by the sides of cattle, whose warm bodies
      protected him from the cold, and whose dull understandings
      were not opposed to his harmless presence. Overhanging
      rocks and trees kept him at times from the rain, and a
      friendly hay-loft or corn-crib was not above his humble
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The involute progression of hallucination is strange. From
      asking at doors and being constantly rebuffed or denied, he
      finally came to the conclusion that although his
      Ph&oelig;be might not be in any of the houses at the doors
      of which he inquired, she might nevertheless be within the
      sound of his voice. And so, from patient inquiry, he began
      to call sad, occasional cries, that ever and anon waked the
      quiet landscapes and ragged hill regions, and set to
      echoing his thin "O-o-o Ph&oelig;be! O-o-o Ph&oelig;be!" It
      had a pathetic, albeit insane, ring, and many a farmer or
      plowboy came to know it even from afar and say, "There goes
      old Reifsneider."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing that puzzled him greatly after a time and
      after many hundreds of inquiries was, when he no longer had
      any particular dooryard in view and no special inquiry to
      make, which way to go. These cross-roads, which
      occasionally led in four or even six directions, came after
      a time to puzzle him. But to solve this knotty problem,
      which became more and more of a puzzle, there came to his
      aid another hallucination. Ph&oelig;be's spirit or some
      power of the air or wind or nature would tell him. If he
      stood at the center of the parting of the ways, closed his
      eyes, turned thrice about, and called "O-o-o Ph&oelig;be!"
      twice, and then threw his cane straight before him, that
      would surely indicate which way to go for Ph&oelig;be, or
      one of these mystic powers would surely govern its
      direction and fall! In whichever direction it went, even
      though, as was not infrequently the case, it took him back
      along the path he had already come, or across fields, he
      was not so far gone in his mind but that he gave himself
      ample time to search before he called again. Also the
      hallucination seemed to persist that at some time he would
      surely find her. There were hours when his feet were sore,
      and his limbs weary, when he would stop in the heat to wipe
      his seamed brow, or in the cold to beat his arms.
      Sometimes, after throwing away his cane, and finding it
      indicating the direction from which he had just come, he
      would shake his head wearily and philosophically, as if
      contemplating the unbelievable or an untoward fate, and
      then start briskly off. His strange figure came finally to
      be known in the farthest reaches of three or four counties.
      Old Reifsneider was a pathetic character. His fame was
      wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near a little town called Watersville, in Green County,
      perhaps four miles from that minor center of human
      activity, there was a place or precipice locally known as
      the Red Cliff, a sheer wall of red sandstone, perhaps a
      hundred feet high, which raised its sharp face for half a
      mile or more above the fruitful cornfields and orchards
      that lay beneath, and which was surmounted by a thick grove
      of trees. The slope that slowly led up to it from the
      opposite side was covered by a rank growth of beech,
      hickory, and ash, through which threaded a number of
      wagon-tracks crossing at various angles. In fair weather it
      had become old Reifsneider's habit, so inured was he by now
      to the open, to make his bed in some such patch of trees as
      this to fry his bacon or boil his eggs at the foot of some
      tree before laying himself down for the night.
      Occasionally, so light and inconsequential was his sleep,
      he would walk at night. More often, the moonlight or some
      sudden wind stirring in the trees or a reconnoitering
      animal arousing him, he would sit up and think, or pursue
      his quest in the moonlight or the dark, a strange,
      unnatural, half wild, half savage-looking but utterly
      harmless creature, calling at lonely road crossings,
      staring at dark and shuttered houses, and wondering where,
      where Ph&oelig;be could really be.
    </p>
    <p>
      That particular lull that comes in the systole-diastole of
      this earthly ball at two o'clock in the morning invariably
      aroused him, and though he might not go any farther he
      would sit up and contemplate the darkness or the stars,
      wondering. Sometimes in the strange processes of his mind
      he would fancy that he saw moving among the trees the
      figure of his lost wife, and then he would get up to
      follow, taking his utensils, always on a string, and his
      cane. If she seemed to evade him too easily he would run,
      or plead, or, suddenly losing track of the fancied figure,
      stand awed or disappointed, grieving for the moment over
      the almost insurmountable difficulties of his search.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the seventh year of these hopeless
      peregrinations, in the dawn of a similar springtime to that
      in which his wife had died, that he came at last one night
      to the vicinity of this self-same patch that crowned the
      rise to the Red Cliff. His far-flung cane, used as a
      divining-rod at the last cross-roads, had brought him
      hither. He had walked many, many miles. It was after ten
      o'clock at night, and he was very weary. Long wandering and
      little eating had left him but a shadow of his former self.
      It was a question now not so much of physical strength but
      of spiritual endurance which kept him up. He had scarcely
      eaten this day, and now exhausted he set himself down in
      the dark to rest and possibly to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously on this occasion a strange suggestion of the
      presence of his wife surrounded him. It would not be long
      now, he counseled with himself, although the long months
      had brought him nothing, until he should see her, talk to
      her. He fell asleep after a time, his head on his knees. At
      midnight the moon began to rise, and at two in the morning,
      his wakeful hour, was a large silver disk shining through
      the trees to the east. He opened his eyes when the radiance
      became strong, making a silver pattern at his feet and
      lighting the woods with strange lusters and silvery,
      shadowy forms. As usual, his old notion that his wife must
      be near occurred to him on this occasion, and he looked
      about him with a speculative, anticipatory eye. What was it
      that moved in the distant shadows along the path by which
      he had entered--a pale, flickering will-o'-the-wisp that
      bobbed gracefully among the trees and riveted his expectant
      gaze? Moonlight and shadows combined to give it a strange
      form and a stranger reality, this fluttering of bog-fire or
      dancing of wandering fire-flies. Was it truly his lost
      Ph&oelig;be? By a circuitous route it passed about him, and
      in his fevered state he fancied that he could see the very
      eyes of her, not as she was when he last saw her in the
      black dress and shawl but now a strangely younger
      Ph&oelig;be, gayer, sweeter, the one whom he had known
      years before as a girl. Old Reifsneider got up. He had been
      expecting and dreaming of this hour all these years, and
      now as he saw the feeble light dancing lightly before him
      he peered at it questioningly, one thin hand in his gray
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden there came to him now for the first time in
      many years the full charm of her girlish figure as he had
      known it in boyhood, the pleasing, sympathetic smile, the
      brown hair, the blue sash she had once worn about her waist
      at a picnic, her gay, graceful movements. He walked around
      the base of the tree, straining with his eyes, forgetting
      for once his cane and utensils, and following eagerly
      after. On she moved before him, a will-o'-the-wisp of the
      spring, a little flame above her head, and it seemed as
      though among the small saplings of ash and beech and the
      thick trunks of hickory and elm that she signaled with a
      young, a lightsome hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Ph&oelig;be! Ph&oelig;be!" he called. "Have yuh really
      come? Have yuh really answered me?" And hurrying faster, he
      fell once, scrambling lamely to his feet, only to see the
      light in the distance dancing illusively on. On and on he
      hurried until he was fairly running, brushing his ragged
      arms against the trees, striking his hands and face against
      impeding twigs. His hat was gone, his lungs were
      breathless, his reason quite astray, when coming to the
      edge of the cliff he saw her below among a silvery bed of
      apple-trees now blooming in the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O Ph&oelig;be!" he called. "O Ph&oelig;be! Oh, no, don't
      leave me!" And feeling the lure of a world where love was
      young and Ph&oelig;be as this vision presented her, a
      delightful epitome of their quondam youth, he gave a gay
      cry of "Oh, wait, Ph&oelig;be!" and leaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some farmer-boys, reconnoitering this region of bounty and
      prospect some few days afterward, found first the tin
      utensils tied together under the tree where he had left
      them, and then later at the foot of the cliff, pale,
      broken, but elate, a molded smile of peace and delight upon
      his lips, his body. His old hat was discovered lying under
      some low-growing saplings, the twigs of which had held it
      back. No one of all the simple population knew how eagerly
      and joyously he had found his lost mate.

      <blockquote>SHIRLEY DEAR:<br />
<br />



      You don't want the letters. There are only six of them,
      anyhow, and think, they're all I have of you to cheer me on
      my travels. What good would they be to you--little bits of
      notes telling me you're sure to meet me--but me--think of
      me! If I send them to you, you'll tear them up, whereas if
      you leave them with me I can dab them with musk and
      ambergris and keep them in a little silver box, always
      beside me.<br />
<br />



      Ah, Shirley dear, you really don't know how sweet I think
      you are, how dear! There isn't a thing we have ever done
      together that isn't as clear in my mind as this great big
      skyscraper over the way here in Pittsburgh, and far more
      pleasing. In fact, my thoughts of you are the most precious
      and delicious things I have, Shirley.<br />
<br />



      But I'm too young to marry now. You know that, Shirley,
      don't you? I haven't placed myself in any way yet, and I'm
      so restless that I don't know whether I ever will, really.
      Only yesterday, old Roxbaum--that's my new employer
      here--came to me and wanted to know if I would like an
      assistant overseership on one of his coffee plantations in
      Java, said there would not be much money in it for a year
      or two, a bare living, but later there would be more--and I
      jumped at it. Just the thought of Java and going there did
      that, although I knew I could make more staying right here.
      Can't you see how it is with me, Shirl? I'm too restless
      and too young. I couldn't take care of you right, and you
      wouldn't like me after a while if I didn't.<br />
<br />



      But ah, Shirley sweet, I think the dearest things of you!
      There isn't an hour, it seems, but some little bit of you
      comes back--a dear, sweet bit--the night we sat on the
      grass in Tregore Park and counted the stars through the
      trees; that first evening at Sparrows Point when we missed
      the last train and had to walk to Langley. Remember the
      tree-toads, Shirl? And then that warm April Sunday in
      Atholby woods! Ah, Shirl, you don't want the six notes! Let
      me keep them. But think of me, will you, sweet, wherever
      you go and whatever you do? I'll always think of you, and
      wish that you had met a better, saner man than me, and that
      I really could have married you and been all you wanted me
      to be. By-by, sweet. I may start for Java within the month.
      If so, and you would want them, I'll send you some cards
      from there--if they have any.<br />
<br />



      Your worthless,<br />
<br />



      ARTHUR.</blockquote>

    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat and turned the letter in her hand, dumb with
      despair. It was the very last letter she would ever get
      from him. Of that she was certain. He was gone now, once
      and for all. She had written him only once, not making an
      open plea but asking him to return her letters, and then
      there had come this tender but evasive reply, saying
      nothing of a possible return but desiring to keep her
      letters for old times' sake--the happy hours they had spent
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happy hours! Oh, yes, yes, yes--the happy hours!
    </p>
    <p>
      In her memory now, as she sat here in her home after the
      day's work, meditating on all that had been in the few
      short months since he had come and gone, was a world of
      color and light--a color and a light so transfiguring as to
      seem celestial, but now, alas, wholly dissipated. It had
      contained so much of all she had desired--love, romance,
      amusement, laughter. He had been so gay and thoughtless, or
      headstrong, so youthfully romantic, and with such a love of
      play and change and to be saying and doing anything and
      everything. Arthur could dance in a gay way, whistle, sing
      after a fashion, play. He could play cards and do tricks,
      and he had such a superior air, so genial and brisk, with a
      kind of innate courtesy in it and yet an intolerance for
      slowness and stodginess or anything dull or dingy, such as
      characterized-- But here her thoughts fled from him. She
      refused to think of any one but Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting in her little bedroom now, off the parlor on the
      ground floor in her home in Bethune Street, and looking out
      over the Kessels' yard, and beyond that--there being no
      fences in Bethune Street--over the "yards" or lawns of the
      Pollards, Bakers, Cryders, and others, she thought of how
      dull it must all have seemed to him, with his fine
      imaginative mind and experiences, his love of change and
      gayety, his atmosphere of something better than she had
      ever known. How little she had been fitted, perhaps, by
      beauty or temperament to overcome this--the
      something--dullness in her work or her home, which possibly
      had driven him away. For, although many had admired her to
      date, and she was young and pretty in her simple way and
      constantly receiving suggestions that her beauty was
      disturbing to some, still, he had not cared for her--he had
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as she meditated, it seemed that this scene, and
      all that it stood for--her parents, her work, her daily
      shuttling to and fro between the drug company for which she
      worked and this street and house--was typical of her life
      and what she was destined to endure always. Some girls were
      so much more fortunate. They had fine clothes, fine homes,
      a world of pleasure and opportunity in which to move. They
      did not have to scrimp and save and work to pay their own
      way. And yet she had always been compelled to do it, but
      had never complained until now--or until he came, and
      after. Bethune Street, with its commonplace front yards and
      houses nearly all alike, and this house, so like the
      others, room for room and porch for porch, and her parents,
      too, really like all the others, had seemed good enough,
      quite satisfactory, indeed, until then. But now, now!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in their kitchen, was her mother, a thin, pale, but
      kindly woman, peeling potatoes and washing lettuce, and
      putting a bit of steak or a chop or a piece of liver in a
      frying-pan day after day, morning and evening, month after
      month, year after year. And next door was Mrs. Kessel doing
      the same thing. And next door Mrs. Cryder. And next door
      Mrs. Pollard. But, until now, she had not thought it so
      bad. But now--now--oh! And on all the porches or lawns all
      along this street were the husbands and fathers, mostly
      middle-aged or old men like her father, reading their
      papers or cutting the grass before dinner, or smoking and
      meditating afterward. Her father was out in front now, a
      stooped, forbearing, meditative soul, who had rarely
      anything to say--leaving it all to his wife, her mother,
      but who was fond of her in his dull, quiet way. He was a
      pattern-maker by trade, and had come into possession of
      this small, ordinary home via years of toil and saving, her
      mother helping him. They had no particular religion, as he
      often said, thinking reasonably human conduct a sufficient
      passport to heaven, but they had gone occasionally to the
      Methodist Church over in Nicholas Street, and she had once
      joined it. But of late she had not gone, weaned away by the
      other commonplace pleasures of her world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then in the midst of it, the dull drift of things, as
      she now saw them to be, he had come--Arthur Bristow--young,
      energetic, good-looking, ambitious, dreamful, and
      instanter, and with her never knowing quite how, the whole
      thing had been changed. He had appeared so swiftly--out of
      nothing, as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous to him had been Barton Williams, stout,
      phlegmatic, good-natured, well-meaning, who was, or had
      been before Arthur came, asking her to marry him, and whom
      she allowed to half assume that she would. She had liked
      him in a feeble, albeit, as she thought, tender way,
      thinking him the kind, according to the logic of her
      neighborhood, who would make her a good husband, and, until
      Arthur appeared on the scene, had really intended to marry
      him. It was not really a love-match, as she saw now, but
      she thought it was, which was much the same thing, perhaps.
      But, as she now recalled, when Arthur came, how the scales
      fell from her eyes! In a trice, as it were, nearly, there
      was a new heaven and a new earth. Arthur had arrived, and
      with him a sense of something different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mabel Gove had asked her to come over to her house in
      Westleigh, the adjoining suburb, for Thanksgiving eve and
      day, and without a thought of anything, and because Barton
      was busy handling a part of the work in the despatched
      office of the Great Eastern and could not see her, she had
      gone. And then, to her surprise and strange, almost
      ineffable delight, the moment she had seen him, he was
      there--Arthur, with his slim, straight figure and dark hair
      and eyes and clean-cut features, as clean and attractive as
      those of a coin. And as he had looked at her and smiled and
      narrated humorous bits of things that had happened to him,
      something had come over her--a spell--and after dinner they
      had all gone round to Edith Barringer's to dance, and there
      as she had danced with him, somehow, without any seeming
      boldness on his part, he had taken possession of her, as it
      were, drawn her close, and told her she had beautiful eyes
      and hair and such a delicately rounded chin, and that he
      thought she danced gracefully and was sweet. She had nearly
      fainted with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you like me?" he had asked in one place in the dance,
      and, in spite of herself, she had looked up into his eyes,
      and from that moment she was almost mad over him, could
      think of nothing else but his hair and eyes and his smile
      and his graceful figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mabel Gove had seen it all, in spite of her determination
      that no one should, and on their going to bed later, back
      at Mabel's home, she had whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Shirley, I saw. You like Arthur, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he's very nice," Shirley recalled replying, for
      Mabel knew of her affair with Barton and liked him, "but
      I'm not crazy over him." And for this bit of treason she
      had sighed in her dreams nearly all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the next day, true to a request and a promise made by
      him, Arthur had called again at Mabel's to take her and
      Mabel to a "movie" which was not so far away, and from
      there they had gone to an ice-cream parlor, and during it
      all, when Mabel was not looking, he had squeezed her arm
      and hand and kissed her neck, and she had held her breath,
      and her heart had seemed to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now you're going to let me come out to your place to
      see you, aren't you?" he had whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she had replied, "Wednesday evening," and then written
      the address on a little piece of paper and given it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now it was all gone, gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      This house, which now looked so dreary--how romantic it had
      seemed that first night <i>he</i> called--the front room
      with its commonplace furniture, and later in the spring,
      the veranda, with its vines just sprouting, and the moon in
      May. Oh, the moon in May, and June and July, when he was
      here! How she had lied to Barton to make evenings for
      Arthur, and occasionally to Arthur to keep him from contact
      with Barton. She had not even mentioned Barton to Arthur
      because--because--well, because Arthur was so much better,
      and somehow (she admitted it to herself now) she had not
      been sure that Arthur would care for her long, if at all,
      and then--well, and then, to be quite frank, Barton might
      be good enough. She did not exactly hate him because she
      had found Arthur--not at all. She still liked him in a
      way--he was so kind and faithful, so very dull and
      straightforward and thoughtful of her, which Arthur was
      certainly not. Before Arthur had appeared, as she well
      remembered, Barton had seemed to be plenty good enough--in
      fact, all that she desired in a pleasant, companionable
      way, calling for her, taking her places, bringing her
      flowers and candy, which Arthur rarely did, and for that,
      if nothing more, she could not help continuing to like him
      and to feel sorry for him, and, besides, as she had
      admitted to herself before, if Arthur left her--*****
      Weren't his parents better off than hers--and hadn't he a
      good position for such a man as he--one hundred and fifty
      dollars a month and the certainty of more later on? A
      little while before meeting Arthur, she had thought this
      very good, enough for two to live on at least, and she had
      thought some of trying it at some time or other--but
      now--now--
    </p>
    <p>
      And that first night he had called--how well she remembered
      it--how it had transfigured the parlor next this in which
      she was now, filling it with something it had never had
      before, and the porch outside, too, for that matter, with
      its gaunt, leafless vine, and this street, too, even--dull,
      commonplace Bethune Street. There had been a flurry of snow
      during the afternoon while she was working at the store,
      and the ground was white with it. All the neighboring homes
      seemed to look sweeter and happier and more inviting than
      ever they had as she came past them, with their lights
      peeping from under curtains and drawn shades. She had
      hurried into hers and lighted the big red-shaded parlor
      lamp, her one artistic treasure, as she thought, and put it
      near the piano, between it and the window, and arranged the
      chairs, and then bustled to the task of making herself as
      pleasing as she might. For him she had gotten out her one
      best filmy house dress and done up her hair in the fashion
      she thought most becoming--and that he had not seen
      before--and powdered her cheeks and nose and darkened her
      eyelashes, as some of the girls at the store did, and put
      on her new gray satin slippers, and then, being so arrayed,
      waited nervously, unable to eat anything or to think of
      anything but him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at last, just when she had begun to think he might not
      be coming, he had appeared with that arch smile and a
      "Hello! It's here you live, is it? I was wondering. George,
      but you're twice as sweet as I thought you were, aren't
      you?" And then, in the little entryway, behind the closed
      door, he had held her and kissed her on the mouth a dozen
      times while she pretended to push against his coat and
      struggle and say that her parents might hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, oh, the room afterward, with him in it in the red glow
      of the lamp, and with his pale handsome face made handsomer
      thereby, as she thought! He had made her sit near him and
      had held her hands and told her about his work and his
      dreams--all that he expected to do in the future--and then
      she had found herself wishing intensely to share just such
      a life--his life--anything that he might wish to do; only,
      she kept wondering, with a slight pain, whether he would
      want her to--he was so young, dreamful, ambitious, much
      younger and more dreamful than herself, although, in
      reality, he was several years older.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then followed that glorious period from December to
      this late September, in which everything which was worth
      happening in love had happened. Oh, those wondrous days the
      following spring, when, with the first burst of buds and
      leaves, he had taken her one Sunday to Atholby, where all
      the great woods were, and they had hunted spring beauties
      in the grass, and sat on a slope and looked at the river
      below and watched some boys fixing up a sailboat and
      setting forth in it quite as she wished she and Arthur
      might be doing--going somewhere together--far, far away
      from all commonplace things and life! And then he had
      slipped his arm about her and kissed her cheek and neck,
      and tweaked her ear and smoothed her hair--and oh, there on
      the grass, with the spring flowers about her and a canopy
      of small green leaves above, the perfection of love had
      come--love so wonderful that the mere thought of it made
      her eyes brim now! And then had been days, Saturday
      afternoons and Sundays, at Atholby and Sparrows Point,
      where the great beach was, and in lovely Tregore Park, a
      mile or two from her home, where they could go of an
      evening and sit in or near the pavilion and have ice-cream
      and dance or watch the dancers. Oh, the stars, the winds,
      the summer breath of those days! Ah, me! Ah, me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, her parents had wondered from the first about
      her and Arthur, and her and Barton, since Barton had
      already assumed a proprietary interest in her and she had
      seemed to like him. But then she was an only child and a
      pet, and used to presuming on that, and they could not
      think of saying anything to her. After all, she was young
      and pretty and was entitled to change her mind; only,
      only--she had had to indulge in a career of lying and
      subterfuge in connection with Barton, since Arthur was
      headstrong and wanted every evening that he chose--to call
      for her at the store and keep her down-town to dinner and a
      show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur had never been like Barton, shy, phlegmatic,
      obedient, waiting long and patiently for each little favor,
      but, instead, masterful and eager, rifling her of kisses
      and caresses and every delight of love, and teasing and
      playing with her as a cat would a mouse. She could never
      resist him. He demanded of her her time and her affection
      without let or hindrance. He was not exactly selfish or
      cruel, as some might have been, but gay and unthinking at
      times, unconsciously so, and yet loving and tender at
      others--nearly always so. But always he would talk of
      things in the future as if they really did not include
      her--and this troubled her greatly--of places he might go,
      things he might do, which, somehow, he seemed to think or
      assume that she could not or would not do with him. He was
      always going to Australia sometime, he thought, in a
      business way, or to South Africa, or possibly to India. He
      never seemed to have any fixed clear future for himself in
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dreadful sense of helplessness and of impending disaster
      came over her at these times, of being involved in some
      predicament over which she had no control, and which would
      lead her on to some sad end. Arthur, although plainly in
      love, as she thought, and apparently delighted with her,
      might not always love her. She began, timidly at first (and
      always, for that matter), to ask him pretty, seeking
      questions about himself and her, whether their future was
      certain to be together, whether he really wanted her--loved
      her--whether he might not want to marry some one else or
      just her, and whether she wouldn't look nice in a pearl
      satin wedding-dress with a long creamy veil and satin
      slippers and a bouquet of bridal-wreath. She had been so
      slowly but surely saving to that end, even before he came,
      in connection with Barton; only, after <i>he</i> came, all
      thought of the import of it had been transferred to him.
      But now, also, she was beginning to ask herself sadly,
      "Would it ever be?" He was so airy, so inconsequential, so
      ready to say: "Yes, yes," and "Sure, sure! That's right!
      Yes, indeedy; you bet! Say, kiddie, but you'll look sweet!"
      but, somehow, it had always seemed as if this whole thing
      were a glorious interlude and that it could not last.
      Arthur was too gay and ethereal and too little settled in
      his own mind. His ideas of travel and living in different
      cities, finally winding up in New York or San Francisco,
      but never with her exactly until she asked him, was too
      ominous, although he always reassured her gaily: "Of
      course! Of course!" But somehow she could never believe it
      really, and it made her intensely sad at times, horribly
      gloomy. So often she wanted to cry, and she could scarcely
      tell why.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, because of her intense affection for him, she had
      finally quarreled with Barton, or nearly that, if one could
      say that one ever really quarreled with him. It had been
      because of a certain Thursday evening a few weeks before
      about which she had disappointed him. In a fit of
      generosity, knowing that Arthur was coming Wednesday, and
      because Barton had stopped in at the store to see her, she
      had told him that he might come, having regretted it
      afterward, so enamored was she of Arthur. And then when
      Wednesday came, Arthur had changed his mind, telling her he
      would come Friday instead, but on Thursday evening he had
      stopped in at the store and asked her to go to Sparrows
      Point, with the result that she had no time to notify
      Barton. He had gone to the house and sat with her parents
      until ten-thirty, and then, a few days later, although she
      had written him offering an excuse, had called at the store
      to complain slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think you did just right, Shirley? You might have
      sent word, mightn't you? Who was it--the new fellow you
      won't tell me about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Shirley flared on the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing it was? What's it to you? I don't belong to you
      yet, do I? I told you there wasn't any one, and I wish
      you'd let me alone about that. I couldn't help it last
      Thursday--that's all--and I don't want you to be fussing
      with me--that's all. If you don't want to, you needn't come
      any more, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that, Shirley," pleaded Barton. "You don't mean
      that. I won't bother you, though, if you don't want me any
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      And because Shirley sulked, not knowing what else to do, he
      had gone and she had not seen him since.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then sometime later when she had thus broken with
      Barton, avoiding the railway station where he worked,
      Arthur had failed to come at his appointed time, sending no
      word until the next day, when a note came to the store
      saying that he had been out of town for his firm over
      Sunday and had not been able to notify her, but that he
      would call Tuesday. It was an awful blow. At the time,
      Shirley had a vision of what was to follow. It seemed for
      the moment as if the whole world had suddenly been reduced
      to ashes, that there was nothing but black charred cinders
      anywhere--she felt that about all life. Yet it all came to
      her clearly then that this was but the beginning of just
      such days and just such excuses, and that soon, soon, he
      would come no more. He was beginning to be tired of her and
      soon he would not even make excuses. She felt it, and it
      froze and terrified her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, soon after, the indifference which she feared did
      follow--almost created by her own thoughts, as it were.
      First, it was a meeting he had to attend somewhere one
      Wednesday night when he was to have come for her. Then he
      was going out of town again, over Sunday. Then he was going
      away for a whole week--it was absolutely unavoidable, he
      said, his commercial duties were increasing--and once he
      had casually remarked that nothing could stand in the way
      where she was concerned--never! She did not think of
      reproaching him with this; she was too proud. If he was
      going, he must go. She would not be willing to say to
      herself that she had ever attempted to hold any man. But,
      just the same, she was agonized by the thought. When he was
      with her, he seemed tender enough; only, at times, his eyes
      wandered and he seemed slightly bored. Other girls,
      particularly pretty ones, seemed to interest him as much as
      she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the agony of the long days when he did not come any
      more for a week or two at a time! The waiting, the
      brooding, the wondering, at the store and here in her
      home--in the former place making mistakes at times because
      she could not get her mind off him and being reminded of
      them, and here at her own home at nights, being so
      absent-minded that her parents remarked on it. She felt
      sure that her parents must be noticing that Arthur was not
      coming any more, or as much as he had--for she pretended to
      be going out with him, going to Mabel Gove's instead--and
      that Barton had deserted her too, he having been driven off
      by her indifference, never to come any more, perhaps,
      unless she sought him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it was that the thought of saving her own face by
      taking up with Barton once more occurred to her, of using
      him and his affections and faithfulness and dulness, if you
      will, to cover up her own dilemma. Only, this ruse was not
      to be tried until she had written Arthur this one letter--a
      pretext merely to see if there was a single ray of hope, a
      letter to be written in a gentle-enough way and asking for
      the return of the few notes she had written him. She had
      not seen him now in nearly a month, and the last time she
      had, he had said he might soon be compelled to leave her
      awhile--to go to Pittsburgh to work. And it was his reply
      to this that she now held in her hand--from Pittsburgh! It
      was frightful! The future without him!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Barton would never know really what had transpired, if
      she went back to him. In spite of all her delicious hours
      with Arthur, she could call him back, she felt sure. She
      had never really entirely dropped him, and he knew it. He
      had bored her dreadfully on occasion, arriving on off days
      when Arthur was not about, with flowers or candy, or both,
      and sitting on the porch steps and talking of the railroad
      business and of the whereabouts and doings of some of their
      old friends. It was shameful, she had thought at times, to
      see a man so patient, so hopeful, so good-natured as
      Barton, deceived in this way, and by her, who was so
      miserable over another. Her parents must see and know, she
      had thought at these times, but still, what else was she to
      do?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a bad girl," she kept telling herself. "I'm all wrong.
      What right have I to offer Barton what is left?" But still,
      somehow, she realized that Barton, if she chose to favor
      him, would only be too grateful for even the leavings of
      others where she was concerned, and that even yet, if she
      but deigned to crook a finger, she could have him. He was
      so simple, so good-natured, so stolid and matter of fact,
      so different to Arthur whom (she could not help smiling at
      the thought of it) she was loving now about as Barton loved
      her--slavishly, hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as the days passed and Arthur did not write any
      more--just this one brief note--she at first grieved
      horribly, and then in a fit of numb despair attempted,
      bravely enough from one point of view, to adjust herself to
      the new situation. Why should she despair? Why die of agony
      where there were plenty who would still sigh for
      her--Barton among others? She was young, pretty, very--many
      told her so. She could, if she chose, achieve a vivacity
      which she did not feel. Why should she brook this
      unkindness without a thought of retaliation? Why shouldn't
      she enter upon a gay and heartless career, indulging in a
      dozen flirtations at once--dancing and killing all thoughts
      of Arthur in a round of frivolities? There were many who
      beckoned to her. She stood at her counter in the drug store
      on many a day and brooded over this, but at the thought of
      which one to begin with, she faltered. After her late love,
      all were so tame, for the present anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then--and then--always there was Barton, the humble or
      faithful, to whom she had been so unkind and whom she had
      used and whom she still really liked. So often
      self-reproaching thoughts in connection with him crept over
      her. He must have known, must have seen how badly she was
      using him all this while, and yet he had not failed to come
      and come, until she had actually quarreled with him, and
      any one would have seen that it was literally hopeless. She
      could not help remembering, especially now in her pain,
      that he adored her. He was not calling on her now at
      all--by her indifference she had finally driven him
      away--but a word, a word-- She waited for days, weeks,
      hoping against hope, and then--
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The office of Barton's superior in the Great Eastern
      terminal had always made him an easy object for her
      blandishments, coming and going, as she frequently did, via
      this very station. He was in the office of the assistant
      train-despatcher on the ground floor, where passing to and
      from the local, which, at times, was quicker than a
      street-car, she could easily see him by peering in; only,
      she had carefully avoided him for nearly a year. If she
      chose now, and would call for a message-blank at the
      adjacent telegraph-window which was a part of his room, and
      raised her voice as she often had in the past, he could
      scarcely fail to hear, if he did not see her. And if he
      did, he would rise and come over--of that she was sure, for
      he never could resist her. It had been a wile of hers in
      the old days to do this or to make her presence felt by
      idling outside. After a month of brooding, she felt that
      she must act--her position as a deserted girl was too much.
      She could not stand it any longer really--the eyes of her
      mother, for one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was six-fifteen one evening when, coming out of the
      store in which she worked, she turned her step
      disconsolately homeward. Her heart was heavy, her face
      rather pale and drawn. She had stopped in the store's
      retiring-room before coming out to add to her charms as
      much as possible by a little powder and rouge and to smooth
      her hair. It would not take much to reallure her former
      sweetheart, she felt sure--and yet it might not be so easy
      after all. Suppose he had found another? But she could not
      believe that. It had scarcely been long enough since he had
      last attempted to see her, and he was really so very, very
      fond of her and so faithful. He was too slow and certain in
      his choosing--he had been so with her. Still, who knows?
      With this thought, she went forward in the evening, feeling
      for the first time the shame and pain that comes of
      deception, the agony of having to relinquish an ideal and
      the feeling of despair that comes to those who find
      themselves in the position of suppliants, stooping to
      something which in better days and better fortune they
      would not know. Arthur was the cause of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached the station, the crowd that usually filled
      it at this hour was swarming. There were so many pairs like
      Arthur and herself laughing and hurrying away or so she
      felt. First glancing in the small mirror of a weighing
      scale to see if she were still of her former charm, she
      stopped thoughtfully at a little flower stand which stood
      outside, and for a few pennies purchased a tiny bunch of
      violets. She then went inside and stood near the window,
      peering first furtively to see if he were present. He was.
      Bent over his work, a green shade over his eyes, she could
      see his stolid, genial figure at a table. Stepping back a
      moment to ponder, she finally went forward and, in a clear
      voice, asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I have a blank, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The infatuation of the discarded Barton was such that it
      brought him instantly to his feet In his stodgy, stocky way
      he rose, his eyes glowing with a friendly hope, his mouth
      wreathed in smiles, and came over. At the sight of her,
      pale, but pretty--paler and prettier, really, than he had
      ever seen her--he thrilled dumbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, Shirley?" he asked sweetly, as he drew near,
      his eyes searching her face hopefully. He had not seen her
      for so long that he was intensely hungry, and her paler
      beauty appealed to him more than ever. Why wouldn't she
      have him? he was asking himself. Why wouldn't his
      persistent love yet win her? Perhaps it might. "I haven't
      seen you in a month of Sundays, it seems. How are the
      folks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're all right, Bart," she smiled archly, "and so am I.
      How have you been? It has been a long time since I've seen
      you. I've been wondering how you were. Have you been all
      right? I was just going to send a message."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he had approached, Shirley had pretended at first not to
      see him, a moment later to affect surprise, although she
      was really suppressing a heavy sigh. The sight of him,
      after Arthur, was not reassuring. Could she really interest
      herself in him any more? Could she?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, sure," he replied genially; "I'm always all right.
      You couldn't kill me, you know. Not going away, are you,
      Shirl?" he queried interestedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I'm just telegraphing to Mabel. She promised to meet
      me to-morrow, and I want to be sure she will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't come past here as often as you did, Shirley," he
      complained tenderly. "At least, I don't seem to see you so
      often," he added with a smile. "It isn't anything I have
      done, is it?" he queried, and then, when she protested
      quickly, added: "What's the trouble, Shirl? Haven't been
      sick, have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She affected all her old gaiety and ease, feeling as though
      she would like to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," she returned; "I've been all right. I've been
      going through the other door, I suppose, or coming in and
      going out on the Langdon Avenue car." (This was true,
      because she had been wanting to avoid him.) "I've been in
      such a hurry, most nights, that I haven't had time to stop,
      Bart. You know how late the store keeps us at times."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered, too, that in the old days she had made time
      to stop or meet him occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know," he said tactfully. "But you haven't been to
      any of our old card-parties either of late, have you? At
      least, I haven't seen you. I've gone to two or three,
      thinking you might be there."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was another thing Arthur had done--broken up her
      interest in these old store and neighborhood parties and a
      banjo-and-mandolin club to which she had once belonged.
      They had all seemed so pleasing and amusing in the old
      days--but now-- * * * * In those days Bart had been her
      usual companion when his work permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she replied evasively, but with a forced air of
      pleasant remembrance; "I have often thought of how much fun
      we had at those, though. It was a shame to drop them. You
      haven't seen Harry Stull or Trina Task recently, have you?"
      she inquired, more to be saying something than for any
      interest she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head negatively, then added:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I did, too; here in the waiting-room a few nights
      ago. They were coming down-town to a theater, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face fell slightly as he recalled how it had been their
      custom to do this, and what their one quarrel had been
      about. Shirley noticed it. She felt the least bit sorry for
      him, but much more for herself, coming back so
      disconsolately to all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you're looking as pretty as ever, Shirley," he
      continued, noting that she had not written the telegram and
      that there was something wistful in her glance. "Prettier,
      I think," and she smiled sadly. Every word that she
      tolerated from him was as so much gold to him, so much of
      dead ashes to her. "You wouldn't like to come down some
      evening this week and see 'The Mouse-Trap,' would you? We
      haven't been to a theater together in I don't know when."
      His eyes sought hers in a hopeful, doglike way.
    </p>
    <p>
      So--she could have him again--that was the pity of it! To
      have what she really did not want, did not care for! At the
      least nod now he would come, and this very devotion made it
      all but worthless, and so sad. She ought to marry him now
      for certain, if she began in this way, and could in a
      month's time if she chose, but oh, oh--could she? For the
      moment she decided that she could not, would not. If he had
      only repulsed her--told her to go--ignored her--but no; it
      was her fate to be loved by him in this moving, pleading
      way, and hers not to love him as she wished to love--to be
      loved. Plainly, he needed some one like her, whereas she,
      she--. She turned a little sick, a sense of the sacrilege
      of gaiety at this time creeping into her voice, and
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!" Then seeing his face change, a heavy sadness come
      over it, "Not this week, anyhow, I mean" ("Not so soon,"
      she had almost said). "I have several engagements this week
      and I'm not feeling well. But"--seeing his face change, and
      the thought of her own state returning--"you might come out
      to the house some evening instead, and then we can go some
      other time."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face brightened intensely. It was wonderful how he
      longed to be with her, how the least favor from her
      comforted and lifted him up. She could see also now,
      however, how little it meant to her, how little it could
      ever mean, even if to him it was heaven. The old
      relationship would have to be resumed in toto, once and for
      all, but did she want it that way now that she was feeling
      so miserable about this other affair? As she meditated,
      these various moods racing to and fro in her mind, Barton
      seemed to notice, and now it occurred to him that perhaps
      he had not pursued her enough--was too easily put off. She
      probably did like him yet. This evening, her present visit,
      seemed to prove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, sure!" he agreed. "I'd like that. I'll come out
      Sunday, if you say. We can go any time to the play. I'm
      sorry, Shirley, if you're not feeling well. I've thought of
      you a lot these days. I'll come out Wednesday, if you don't
      mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled a wan smile. It was all so much easier than she
      had expected--her triumph--and so ashenlike in consequence,
      a flavor of dead-sea fruit and defeat about it all, that it
      was pathetic. How could she, after Arthur? How could he,
      really?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make it Sunday," she pleaded, naming the farthest day off,
      and then hurried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her faithful lover gazed after her, while she suffered an
      intense nausea. To think--to think--it should all be coming
      to this! She had not used her telegraph-blank, and now had
      forgotten all about it. It was not the simple trickery that
      discouraged her, but her own future which could find no
      better outlet than this, could not rise above it
      apparently, or that she had no heart to make it rise above
      it. Why couldn't she interest herself in some one different
      to Barton? Why did she have to return to him? Why not wait
      and meet some other--ignore him as before? But no, no;
      nothing mattered now--no one--it might as well be Barton
      really as any one, and she would at least make him happy
      and at the same time solve her own problem. She went out
      into the train-shed and climbed into her train. Slowly,
      after the usual pushing and jostling of a crowd, it drew
      out toward Latonia, that suburban region in which her home
      lay. As she rode, she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have I just done? What am I doing?" she kept asking
      herself as the clacking wheels on the rails fell into a
      rhythmic dance and the houses of the brown, dry, endless
      city fled past in a maze. "Severing myself decisively from
      the past--the happy past--for supposing, once I am married,
      Arthur should return and want me again--suppose! Suppose!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Below at one place, under a shed, were some
      market-gardeners disposing of the last remnants of their
      day's wares--a sickly, dull life, she thought. Here was
      Rutgers Avenue, with its line of red street-cars, many
      wagons and tracks and counter-streams of automobiles--how
      often had she passed it morning and evening in a
      shuttle-like way, and how often would, unless she got
      married! And here, now, was the river flowing smoothly
      between its banks lined with coal-pockets and
      wharves--away, away to the huge deep sea which she and
      Arthur had enjoyed so much. Oh, to be in a small boat and
      drift out, out into the endless, restless, pathless deep!
      Somehow the sight of this water, to-night and every night,
      brought back those evenings in the open with Arthur at
      Sparrows Point, the long line of dancers in Eckert's
      Pavilion, the woods at Atholby, the park, with the dancers
      in the pavilion--she choked back a sob. Once Arthur had
      come this way with her on just such an evening as this,
      pressing her hand and saying how wonderful she was. Oh,
      Arthur! Arthur! And now Barton was to take his old place
      again--forever, no doubt. She could not trifle with her
      life longer in this foolish way, or his. What was the use?
      But think of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it must be--forever now, she told herself. She must
      marry. Time would be slipping by and she would become too
      old. It was her only future--marriage. It was the only
      future she had ever contemplated really, a home, children,
      the love of some man whom she could love as she loved
      Arthur. Ah, what a happy home that would have been for her!
      But now, now--
    </p>
    <p>
      But there must be no turning back now, either. There was no
      other way. If Arthur ever came back--but fear not, he
      wouldn't! She had risked so much and lost--lost him. Her
      little venture into true love had been such a failure.
      Before Arthur had come all had been well enough. Barton,
      stout and simple and frank and direct, had in some
      way--how, she could scarcely realize now--offered
      sufficient of a future. But now, now! He had enough money,
      she knew, to build a cottage for the two of them. He had
      told her so. He would do his best always to make her happy,
      she was sure of that. They could live in about the state
      her parents were living in--or a little better, not
      much--and would never want. No doubt there would be
      children, because he craved them--several of them--and that
      would take up her time, long years of it--the sad, gray
      years! But then Arthur, whose children she would have
      thrilled to bear, would be no more, a mere memory--think of
      that!--and Barton, the dull, the commonplace, would have
      achieved his finest dream--and why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Because love was a failure for her--that was why--and in
      her life there could be no more true love. She would never
      love any one again as she had Arthur. It could not be, she
      was sure of it. He was too fascinating, too wonderful.
      Always, always, wherever she might be, whoever she might
      marry, he would be coming back, intruding between her and
      any possible love, receiving any possible kiss. It would be
      Arthur she would be loving or kissing. She dabbed at her
      eyes with a tiny handkerchief, turned her face close to the
      window and stared out, and then as the environs of Latonia
      came into view, wondered (so deep is romance): What if
      Arthur should come back at some time--or now! Supposing he
      should be here at the station now, accidentally or on
      purpose, to welcome her, to soothe her weary heart. He had
      met her here before. How she would fly to him, lay her head
      on his shoulder, forget forever that Barton ever was, that
      they had ever separated for an hour. Oh, Arthur! Arthur!
    </p>
    <p>
      But no, no; here was Latonia--here the viaduct over her
      train, the long business street and the cars marked
      "Center" and "Langdon Avenue" running back into the great
      city. A few blocks away in tree-shaded Bethune Street,
      duller and plainer than ever, was her parents' cottage and
      the routine of that old life which was now, she felt, more
      fully fastened upon her than ever before--the lawn-mowers,
      the lawns, the front porches all alike. Now would come the
      going to and fro of Barton to business as her father and
      she now went to business, her keeping house, cooking,
      washing, ironing, sewing for Barton as her mother now did
      these things for her father and herself. And she would not
      be in love really, as she wanted to be. Oh, dreadful! She
      could never escape it really, now that she could endure it
      less, scarcely for another hour. And yet she must, must,
      for the sake of--for the sake of--she closed her eyes and
      dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked up the street under the trees, past the houses
      and lawns all alike to her own, and found her father on
      their veranda reading the evening paper. She sighed at the
      sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back, daughter?" he called pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother is wondering if you would like steak or liver
      for dinner. Better tell her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it doesn't matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried into her bedroom, threw down her hat and
      gloves, and herself on the bed to rest silently, and
      groaned in her soul. To think that it had all come to
      this!--Never to see him any more!--To see only Barton, and
      marry him and live in such a street, have four or five
      children, forget all her youthful companionships--and all
      to save her face before her parents, and her future. Why
      must it be? Should it be, really? She choked and stifled.
      After a little time her mother, hearing her come in, came
      to the door--thin, practical, affectionate, conventional.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wrong, honey? Aren't you feeling well tonight? Have
      you a headache? Let me feel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thin cool fingers crept over her temples and hair. She
      suggested something to eat or a headache powder right away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm all right, mother. I'm just not feeling well now.
      Don't bother. I'll get up soon. Please don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you rather have liver or steak to-night, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, anything--nothing--please don't bother--steak will
      do--anything"--if only she could get rid of her and be at
      rest!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother looked at her and shook her head
      sympathetically, then retreated quietly, saying no more.
      Lying so, she thought and thought--grinding, destroying
      thoughts about the beauty of the past, the darkness of the
      future--until able to endure them no longer she got up and,
      looking distractedly out of the window into the yard and
      the house next door, stared at her future fixedly. What
      should she do? What should she really do? There was Mrs.
      Kessel in her kitchen getting her dinner as usual, just as
      her own mother was now, and Mr. Kessel out on the front
      porch in his shirt-sleeves reading the evening paper.
      Beyond was Mr. Pollard in his yard, cutting the grass. All
      along Bethune Street were such houses and such
      people--simple, commonplace souls all--clerks, managers,
      fairly successful craftsmen, like her father and Barton,
      excellent in their way but not like Arthur the beloved, the
      lost--and here was she, perforce, or by decision of
      necessity, soon to be one of them, in some such street as
      this no doubt, forever and--. For the moment it choked and
      stifled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She decided that she would not. No, no, no! There must be
      some other way--many ways. She did not have to do this
      unless she really wished to--would not--only--. Then going
      to the mirror she looked at her face and smoothed her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's the use?" she asked of herself wearily and
      resignedly after a time. "Why should I cry? Why shouldn't I
      marry Barton? I don't amount to anything, anyhow. Arthur
      wouldn't have me. I wanted him, and I am compelled to take
      some one else--or no one--what difference does it really
      make who? My dreams are too high, that's all. I wanted
      Arthur, and he wouldn't have me. I don't want Barton, and
      he crawls at my feet. I'm a failure, that's what's the
      matter with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, turning up her sleeves and removing a fichu which
      stood out too prominently from her breast, she went into
      the kitchen and, looking about for an apron, observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't I help? Where's the tablecloth?" and finding it
      among napkins and silverware in a drawer in the adjoining
      room, proceeded to set the table.

      Take a smoky Western city. Call it Omaha or Kansas City or
      Denver, only let the Mississippi flow past it. Put in it
      two rival morning papers--two, and only two--the
      <i>Star</i> and the <i>News,</i> the staffs of which are
      rather keen to outwit each other. On the staff of the
      <i>News</i>, slightly the better of the two newspapers, put
      Mr. David Kolinsky, alias (yes, alias) David, or "Red"
      Collins (a little shift of nomenclature due to the facts
      that, first: he was a South Russian Jew who looked exactly
      like a red-headed Irishman--that is a peculiarity of South
      Russian Jews, I believe--and secondly: that it was more
      <i>distingu&eacute;,</i> as it were, to be Irish in Omaha or
      Denver or Kansas City than it was to be a South Russian
      Jew). Give him a slithery, self-confident, race-track or
      tout manner. Put on him "loud" or showy clothes, a diamond
      ring, a ruby pin in his tie, a yellowish-green Fedora hat,
      yellow shoes, freckles, a sneering contemptuous "tough"
      smile, and you have Mr. "Red" Collins as Mr.--
    </p>
    <p>
      But wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the <i>Star,</i> slightly the lesser of these two great
      dailies that matutinally thrashed the city to a foam of
      interest, place Mr. Augustus Binns, no less, young (not
      over twenty-two), tall, college-y, rather graceful as young
      college men go, literary of course, highly ambitious, with
      gold eye-glasses, a wrist watch, a cane--in short, one of
      those ambitious young gentlemen of this rather un-happy go
      un-lucky scribbling world who has distinct ideals, to say
      nothing of dreams, as to what the newspaper and literary
      professions combined should bring him, and who, in
      addition, inherently despised all creatures of the "Red"
      Collins, or racetrack, gambler, amateur detective, police
      and political, type. Well may you ask, what was Mr.
      Collins, with his peculiar characteristics, doing on a
      paper of the importance and distinction of the <i>News.</i>
      A long story, my dears. Newspapers are peculiar
      institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this same paper not long since had harbored the truly
      elegant presence of Mr. Binns himself, and so excellent a
      writer and news gatherer was he that on more than one
      occasion he had been set to revise or rewrite the tales
      which Mr. "Red" Collins, who was then but tentatively
      connected with the paper as a "tipster," brought in. This
      in itself was a crime against art and literature, as Mr.
      Binns saw it, for, when you come right down to it, and in
      the strict meaning of the word, Mr. Collins was not a
      writer at all, could not write, in fact, could only "bring
      in" his stories, and most interesting ones they were,
      nearly all of them, whereas about the paper at all times
      were men who could--Mr. Binns, for instance. It insulted if
      not outraged Mr. Binns's sense of the fitness of things,
      for the <i>News</i> to hire such a person and let him
      flaunt the title of "reporter" or "representative," for he
      admired the <i>News</i> very much and was glad to be of it.
      But Collins! "Red" Collins!
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was one of those "hard life," but by no means
      hard luck, Jews who by reason of indomitable ambition and
      will had raised himself out of practically frightful
      conditions. He had never even seen a bath-tub until he was
      fifteen or sixteen. By turns he had been a bootblack,
      newsboy, race-track tout, stable boy, helper around a
      saloon, and what not. Of late years, and now, because he
      was reaching a true wisdom (he was between twenty-five and
      six), he had developed a sort of taste for gambling as well
      as politics of a low order, and was in addition a police
      hanger-on. He was really a sort of pariah in his way, only
      the sporting and political editors found him useful. They
      tolerated him, and paid him well for his tips because,
      forsooth, his tips were always good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Batsford, the capable city editor of the <i>News,</i> a
      round, forceful, gross person who was more allied to
      Collins than to Binns in spirit, although he was like
      neither, was Binns's first superior in the newspaper world.
      He did not like Binns because, for one thing, of his wrist
      watch, secondly, his large gold glasses--much larger than
      they need have been--and thirdly, because of his cane,
      which he carried with considerable of an air. The truth is,
      Binns was Eastern and the city editor was Western, and
      besides, Binns had been more or less thrust upon him by his
      managing editor as a favor to some one else. But Binns
      could write, never doubt it, and proved it. He was a
      vigorous reporter with a fine feeling for words and, above
      all, a power to visualize and emotionalize whatever he saw,
      a thing which was of the utmost importance in this rather
      loose Western emotional atmosphere. He could handle any
      story which came to him with ease and distinction, and
      seemed usually to get all or nearly all the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Collins, for all his garishness, and one
      might almost say, brutality of spirit, was what Batsford
      would have called a practical man. He knew life. He was by
      no means as artistic as Binns, but still--Batsford liked to
      know what was going on politically and criminally, and
      Collins could always tell him, whereas Binns never could.
      Also, by making Binns rewrite Collins's stories, he knew he
      could offend him horribly. The two were like oil and water,
      Mussulman and Christian.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Batsford first told Collins to relate the facts of a
      certain tale to Binns and let him work it out, the former
      strolled over to the collegian, his lip curled up at one
      corner, his eye cynically fixed on him, and said, "The
      Chief says to give youse this dope and let youse work it
      out"
    </p>
    <p>
      Youse!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, for a large, bright broad ax!
    </p>
    <p>
      Binns, however, always your stickler for duty and order,
      bent on him an equally cynical and yet enigmatic eye,
      hitched up his trousers slightly, adjusted his wrist watch
      and glasses, and began to take down the details of the
      story, worming them out of his rival with a delicacy and
      <i>savoir faire</i> worthy of a better cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after, however, it was brought to the horrified
      ears of Mr. Binns that Mr. Collins had said he was a
      "stiff" and a "cheap ink-slinger," a la-de-da no less, that
      writers, one and all, college and otherwise, didn't count
      for much, anyhow, that they were all starving to death, and
      that they "grew on trees"--a phrase which particularly
      enraged Mr. Binns, for he interpreted it to mean that they
      were as numerous as the sands of the sea, as plentiful as
      mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Allah! That such dogs should be allowed to take the
      beards of great writers into their hands thus!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless and in spite of all this, the fortunes of Mr.
      Collins went forward apace, and that chiefly, as Mr. Binns
      frequently groaned, at his expense. Collins would come in,
      and after a long series of "I sez to him-s" and "He sez to
      me-s," which Mr. Binns (per the orders of Mr. Batsford)
      translated into the King's best Britannica, he having in
      the meanwhile to neglect some excellent tale of his own,
      would go forth again, free to point the next day to a
      column or column-and-a-half or a half-column story, and
      declare proudly, "My story."
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it! That swine!
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an end to all things, however, even life and
      crime. In due time, as per a series of accidents and the
      groundless ill-will of Mr. Batsford, Mr. Binns was
      perforce, in self-respect, compelled to transfer his
      energies to the <i>Star,</i> a paper he had previously
      contemned as being not so good, but where he was now made
      very welcome because of his ability. Then, to his
      astonishment and disgust, one day while covering a police
      station known as the South Ninth, from which emanated many
      amazing police tales, whom should he encounter but "Red"
      Collins, no less, now a full-fledged reporter on the
      <i>News,</i> if you please, and "doing police." He had a
      grand and even contemptuous manner, barely deigning to
      notice Binns. Binns raged.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he noticed at once that Collins was far more <i>en
      rapport</i> with the various sergeants and the captain, as
      well as all that was going on in this station, than ever he
      had dreamed of being. It was "Hello, Red," here and "Hi,
      sport," there, while Collins replied with various "Caps"
      and "Charlies." He gave himself all the airs of a newspaper
      man proper, swaggering about and talking of this, that, and
      the other story which he had written, some of them having
      been done by Binns himself. And what was more, Collins was
      soon closeted intimately with the captain in his room,
      strolling in and out of that sanctum as if it were his
      private demesne, and somehow giving Binns the impression of
      being in touch with realms and deeds of which he had never
      heard, and never would. It made Binns doubly apprehensive
      lest in these secret intimacies tales and mysteries should
      be unfolded which should have their first light in the
      pages of the <i>News,</i> and so leave him to be laughed at
      as one who could not get the news. In consequence, he
      watched the <i>News</i> more closely than ever for any
      evidence of such treachery on the part of the police, while
      at the same time he redoubled his interest in any such
      items as came to his attention. By reason of this, as well
      as by his greater skill in writing and his undeniable
      imagination, on more than one occasion he gave Mr. Collins
      a good drubbing, chancing to make good stories out of
      things which Mr. Collins had evidently dismissed as
      worthless. <i>Au contraire,</i> now and then a case
      appeared in the columns of the <i>News</i> with details
      which he had not been able to obtain, and concerning which
      the police had insisted that they knew nothing. It was thus
      that Mr. Collins secured his revenge--and very good revenge
      too, it was at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Binns managed to hold his own, as, for instance,
      late one August afternoon when a negro girl in one of those
      crowded alleys which made up an interesting and even
      amazing portion of O-- was cut almost to shreds by an
      ex-lover who, following her from river-city to river-city
      and town to town, had finally come up with her here and had
      taken his revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a glistering tale this. It appeared (but only after
      the greatest industry on the part of Mr. Binns) that some
      seven or eight months before [the O-- papers curiously were
      always interested in a tale of this kind] this same girl
      and the negro who had cut her had been living together as
      man and wife in Cairo, Illinois, and that later the lover
      (a coal passer or stevedore, working now on one boat and
      now on another plying the Mississippi between New Orleans
      and O--), who was plainly wildly fond of her, became
      suspicious and finally satisfying himself that his
      mistress, who was a real beauty after her kind, was
      faithless to him, set a trap to catch her. Returning
      suddenly one day when she imagined him to be away for a
      week or two of labor, and bursting in upon her, he found
      her with another man. Death would have been her portion as
      well as that of her lover had it not been for the
      interference of friends, which had permitted the pair to
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lacerated by the double offenses of betrayal and desertion,
      he now set out to follow her, as the cutting on this
      occasion proved. Returning to his task as stevedore and
      working his way thus from one river-city to another, he
      arrived by turns in Memphis, Vicksburg, Natchez and New
      Orleans, in each case making it a point to disguise himself
      as a peddler selling trinkets and charms, and in this
      capacity walking the crowded negro sections of all these
      cities calling his wares. Ambling up one of these stuffy,
      stifling alleys, finally, in O-- which bordered on this
      same police station and where so many negroes lived, he
      encountered this late August afternoon his quondam but now
      faithless love. In answer to his cry of "Rings! Pins!
      Buckles! Trinkets!" his false love, apparently not
      recognizing his voice, put her head out of a doorway. On
      the instant the damage was done. Dropping his tray, he was
      upon her in a flash with his razor, cris-crossing and
      slashing her until she was marred beyond recognition. With
      fiendish cruelty he cut her cheeks, lips, arms, legs, back,
      and sides, so much so that when Binns arrived at the City
      Hospital where she had been taken, he found her unconscious
      and her life despaired of. On the other hand, the lover had
      made good his escape, as had her paramour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously, this story captured the fancy of Mr. Binns as it
      did that of his city editor later, completely. It was such
      a thing as he could do, and do well. With almost deft
      literary art he turned it into a rather striking black
      tragedy. Into it, after convincing his rather fussy city
      editor that it was worth the telling, he had crowded a bit
      of the flavor of the hot waterfronts of Cairo, Memphis,
      Natchez, and New Orleans, the sing-song sleepiness of the
      stevedores at their lazy labors, the idle, dreamy character
      of the slow-moving boats, this rickety alley, with its
      semi-barbaric curtain-hung shacks and its swarming, idle,
      crooning, shuffling negro life. Even an old negro refrain
      appropriate to a trinket peddler, and the low, bold negro
      life two such truants might enjoy, were pictured. An old
      negro mammy with a yellow-dotted kerchief over her head who
      kept talking of "disha Gawge" and "disha Sam" and "disha
      Marquatta" (the girl), had moved him to a poetic frenzy.
      Naturally it made a colorful tale, and his city editor felt
      called upon to compliment him on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the <i>News,</i> owing possibly to Collins's
      inability to grasp the full significance, the romance, of
      such a story as this, it received but a scant stick--a low
      dive cutting affray. His was not the type of mind that
      could see the color here, but once seen he could realize
      wherein he had been beaten, and it infuriated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think you're a helluva feller, dontcha?" he snarled
      the next day on sight, his lip a-curl with scorn and rage.
      "You think you've pulled off sompin swell. Say, I've been
      up against you wordy boys before, and I can work all around
      you. All you guys can do is get a few facts and then pad
      'em up. You never get the real stuff, never," and he even
      snapped his fingers under the nose of the surprised Mr.
      Binns. "Wait'll we get a real case some time, you and me,
      and then I'll show you sompin. Wait and see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good fellow," Mr. Binns was about to begin, but the
      cold, hard, revengeful glare in the eyes of Mr. Collins
      quite took his breath away. Then and there Mr. Collins put
      a strange haunting fear of himself into Mr. Binns's mind.
      There was something so savage about him, so like that of an
      angry hornet or snake that it left him all but speechless.
      "Is that so?" he managed to say after a time. "You think
      you will, do you? That's easy enough to say, now that
      you're beaten, but I guess I'll be right there when the
      time comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, go to hell!" growled Collins savagely, and he walked
      off, leaving Mr. Binns smiling pleasantly, albeit vacantly,
      and at the same time wondering just what it was Mr. Collins
      was going to do to him, and when.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sequel to this was somewhat more interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Binns came in one morning fresh from his bath and
      breakfast, his new city editor called him into his office.
      Mr. Waxby, in contrast with Mr. Batsford, was a small,
      waspish, and yet affable and capable man whom Binns could
      not say he admired as a man or a gentleman, but who, he was
      sure, was a much better city editor than Batsford, and who
      appreciated him, Binns, as Batsford never had, i.e., at his
      true worth. Batsford had annoyed him with such a dog as
      Collins, whereas Waxby had almost coddled him. And what a
      nose for news!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Waxby eyed him rather solemnly and enigmatically on
      this occasion, and then observed: "Do you remember, Binns,
      that big M.P. train robbery that took place out here near
      Dolesville about six months ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you remember that the Governor of this state and
      his military staff, all in uniform, as well as a half dozen
      other big-wigs, were on board, and that they all reported
      that there had been seven lusty bandits, all heavily armed,
      some of whom went through the train and robbed the
      passengers while others compelled the engineer and fireman
      to get down, uncouple the engine, and then blow open the
      express car door and safe for them and carry out the money,
      about twenty or thirty thousand dollars all told?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Binns remembered it well. He had been on the <i>News</i> at
      the time, and the full-page spread had attracted his
      keenest attention. It was illustrative, as he thought, of
      the character of this region--raw and still daring. It
      smacked so much of the lawlessness of the forties, when
      pack-train and stage-coach robberies were the rule and not
      the exception. It had caused his hair to tingle at the
      roots at times so real was it. Never had he been so close,
      as it were, to anything so dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, I remember it very well," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you remember how the newspapers laughed over the
      fact that the Governor and his military staff had crawled
      into their berths and didn't come out again until the train
      had started?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well now, Binns, just read this," and here Mr. Waxby
      handed him a telegram, the while his eyes gleamed with a
      keen humorous light, and Mr. Binns read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>

      <blockquote>"Medicine Flats, M. K.<br />
<br />



      "Lem Rollins arrested here to-day confesses to
      single-handed robbery of M. P. express west of Dolesville
      February 2d last. Money recovered. Rollins being brought to
      O-- via C. T. &amp; A. this p. m. Should arrive
      six-thirty."</blockquote>

    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apparently," cackled Mr. Waxby, "there was nothing to that
      seven-bandit story at all, Binns. There weren't any seven
      robbers, but just one, and they've caught him, and he's
      confessed," and here he burst into more laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Binns," went on Waxby, "if this is really true, it is
      a wonderful story. You don't often find one man holding up
      a whole train anywhere and getting away with twenty or
      thirty thousand dollars. It's amazing. I've decided that we
      won't wait for him to arrive, but that you're to go out and
      meet him. According to this time-table you can take a local
      that leaves here at two-fifteen and get to Pacific fifteen
      minutes ahead of the express on which he is coming in, and
      you've just about time to make it. That will give you all
      of an hour and a half in which to interview him. It's just
      possible that the <i>News</i> and the other papers won't
      get wind of this in time to send a man. Think of the
      opportunity it gives you to study him! No seven robbers,
      remember, but just one! And the Governor and his whole
      staff on board! Make him tell what he thinks of the
      Governor and his staff. Make him talk. Ha! ha! You'll have
      him all to yourself. Think of that! And they crawled into
      their berths! Ha! Ha! Gee whiz, you've got the chance of a
      lifetime!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Binns stared at the telegram. He recalled the detailed
      descriptions of the actions of the seven robbers, how some
      of them had prowled up and down outside the train, while
      others went through it rifling the passengers, and still
      others, forward, overawed the engineer and fireman, broke
      open and robbed the express car safe in the face of an
      armed messenger as well as mailman and trainmen, and how
      they had then decamped into the dark. How could one man
      have done it? It couldn't be true!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless he arose, duly impressed. It would be no easy
      task to get just the right touch, but he felt that he
      might. If only the train weren't over-run with other
      reporters! He stuffed some notepaper into his pocket and
      bustled down to the Union Station--if Mr. Binns could be
      said to <i>bustle.</i> Here he encountered his first hitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      On inquiring for a ticket to Pacific, the slightly
      disturbing response of "Which road?" was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are there two?" asked Mr. Binns.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--M.P. and C.T. &amp; A."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They both go to Pacific, do they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which train leaves first?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "C.T. &amp; A. It's waiting now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Binns hesitated, but there was no time to lose. It
      didn't make any difference, so long as he connected with
      the incoming express, as the time-table showed that this
      did. He paid for his ticket and got aboard, but now an
      irritating thought came to him. Supposing other reporters
      from either the <i>News</i> or one of the three afternoon
      papers were aboard, especially the <i>News</i>! If there
      were not he would have this fine task all to himself, and
      what a beat! But if there were others? He walked forward to
      the smoker, which was the next car in front, and there, to
      his intense disgust and nervous dissatisfaction, he spied,
      of all people, the one man he would least have expected to
      find on an assignment of this kind, the one man he least
      wanted to see--Mr. Collins, no less, red-headed, serene,
      determined, a cigar between his teeth, crouched low in his
      seat smoking and reading a paper as calmly as though he
      were not bent upon the most important task of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" exclaimed Mr. Binns irritably and even bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to his seat nervous and ill composed, all the
      more so because he now recalled Collins's venomous threat,
      "Wait'll we get a real case some time, you and me." The low
      creature! Why, he couldn't even write a decent sentence.
      Why should he fear him so? But just the same he did fear
      him--why, he could scarcely say. Collins was so raw,
      savage, brutal, in his mood and plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why, in heaven's name, he now asked himself as he
      meditated in his seat as to ways and means, should a man
      like Batsford send a man like Collins, who couldn't even
      write, to interpret a story and a character of this kind?
      How could he hope to dig out the odd psychology of this
      very queer case? Plainly he was too crude, too
      unintellectual to get it straight. Nevertheless, here he
      was, and now, plainly, he would have this awful creature to
      contend with. And Collins was so bitter toward him. He
      would leave no trick unturned to beat him! These country
      detectives and sheriff and railroad men, whoever they were
      or wherever they came from, would be sure, on the instant,
      to make friends with Collins, as they always did, and do
      their best to serve him. They seemed to like that sort of
      man, worse luck. They might even, at Collins's instigation,
      refuse to let him interview the bandit at all! If so, then
      what? But Collins would get something somehow, you might be
      sure, secret details which they might not relate to him. It
      made him nervous. Even if he got a chance he would have to
      interview this wonderful bandit in front of this awful
      creature, this one man whom he most despised, and who would
      deprive him of most of the benefit of all his questions by
      writing as though he had thought of and asked all of them
      himself. Think of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The dreary local sped on, and as it drew nearer and nearer
      to Pacific, Binns became more and more nervous. For him the
      whole charm of this beautiful September landscape through
      which he was speeding now was all spoiled. When the train
      finally drew up at Pacific he jumped down, all alive with
      the determination not to be outdone in any way, and yet
      nervous and worried to a degree. Let Collins do his worst,
      he thought. He would show him. Still--just then he saw the
      latter jumping down. At the same time, Collins spied him,
      and on the instant his face clouded over. He seemed fairly
      to bristle with an angry animal rage, and he glared as
      though he would like to kill Binns, at the same time
      looking around to see who else might get off. "My enemy!"
      was written all over him. Seeing no one, he ran up to the
      station-agent and apparently asked when the train from the
      West was due. Binns decided at once not to trail, but
      instead sought information from his own conductor, who
      assured him that the East-bound express would probably be
      on time five minutes later, and would certainly stop here.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We take the siding here," he said. "You'll hear the
      whistle in a few minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It always stops here, does it?" asked Binns anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they talked, Collins came back to the platform's edge
      and stood looking up the track. At the same time this train
      pulled out, and a few minutes later the whistle of the
      express was heard. Now for a real contest, thought Binns.
      Somewhere in one of those cars would be this astounding
      bandit surrounded by detectives, and his duty, in spite of
      the indignity of it, would be to clamber aboard and get
      there first, explain who he was, ingratiate himself into
      the good graces of the captors and the prisoner, and begin
      his questioning, vanquishing Collins as best he
      might--perhaps by the ease with which he should take
      charge. In a few moments the express was rolling into the
      station, and then Binns saw his enemy leap aboard and, with
      that iron effrontery and savageness which always irritated
      Binns so much, race through the forward cars to find the
      prisoner. Binns was about to essay the rear cars, but just
      then the conductor, a portly, genial-looking soul, stepped
      down beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Lem Rollins, the train robber they are bringing in from
      Bald Knob, on here?" he inquired. "I'm from the
      <i>Star,</i> and I've been sent out to interview him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're on the wrong road, brother," smiled the conductor.
      "He's not on this train. Those detective fellows have
      fooled you newspaper men, I'm afraid. They're bringing him
      in over the M.P., as I understand it. They took him across
      from Bald Knob to Wahaba and caught the train there--but
      I'll tell you," and here he took out a large open-face
      silver watch and consulted it, "you might be able to catch
      him yet if you run for it. It's only across the field
      there. You see that little yellow station over there? Well,
      that's the depot. It's due now, but sometimes it's a little
      late. You'll have to run for it, though. You haven't a
      minute to spare."
    </p>
    <p>
      Binns was all aquiver on the instant. Suppose, in spite of
      Collins's zeal and savagery, he should outwit him yet by
      catching this other train while he was searching this one!
      All the gameness of his youth and profession rose up in
      him. Without stopping to thank his informer, he leaped like
      a hare along the little path which cut diagonally across
      this lone field and which was evidently well worn by human
      feet. As he ran he wondered whether the genial conductor
      could possibly have lied to him to throw him off the track,
      and also if his enemy, seeing him running, had discovered
      his error by now and was following, granting that the
      conductor had told him the truth. He looked back
      occasionally, taking off his coat and glasses as he ran,
      and even throwing away his cane. Apparently Collins was
      still searching the other train. And now Binns at the same
      time, looking eagerly forward toward the other station, saw
      a semaphore arm which stood at right angles to the station
      lower itself for a clear track for some train. At the same
      time he also spied a mail-bag hanging out on a take-post
      arm, indicating that whatever this train was and whichever
      way it might be going, it was not going to stop here. He
      turned, still uncertain as to whether he had made a mistake
      in not searching the other train. Supposing the conductor
      had deliberately fooled him! Suppose Collins had made some
      preliminary arrangements of which he knew nothing? Suppose
      he had! Supposing the burglar were really on there, and
      even now Collins was busy with the opening questions of his
      interview, while he was here, behind! Oh Lord, what a beat!
      And he would have no reasonable explanation to offer except
      that he had been outwitted. What would happen to him? He
      slowed up in his running, chill beads of sweat bursting out
      on his face as he did so, but then, looking backward, he
      saw the train begin to move and from it, as if shot out of
      a gun, the significant form of Collins leap down and begin
      to run along this same path. Then, by George, the robber
      was not on it, after all! The conductor had told him the
      truth! Ha! Collins would now attempt to make this other
      train. He had been told that the bandit was coming in on
      this. Binns could see him speeding along the path at top
      speed, his hat off, his hands waving nervously about. But
      by now Binns had reached the station a good three minutes
      ahead of his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desperately he ran into it, a tiny thing, sticking his
      eager perspiring face in at the open office window, and
      calling to the stout, truculent little occupant of it:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When is the East-bound M.P. express due here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," replied the agent surlily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it stop?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it don't stop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can it be stopped?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it <i>cannot</i>!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean to say you have no right to stop it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean I won't stop it."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they spoke there came the ominous shriek of the
      express's whistle tearing on toward them. For the moment he
      was almost willing that Collins should join him if only he
      could make the train and gain this interview. He must have
      it. Waxby expected him to get it. Think of what a beat he
      would have if he won--what Waxby would think if he failed!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would five dollars stop it?" he asked desperately, diving
      into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will ten?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might," the agent replied crustily, and rose to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop it," urged Binns feverishly, handing over the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agent took it, and grabbing a tablet of yellow order
      blanks which lay before him, scribbled something on the
      face of one and ran outside, holding it up at arm's length
      as he did so. At the same time he called to Binns:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run on down the track! Run after it. She won't stop
      here--she can't. She'll go a thousand feet before she can
      slow up. Get on down there, and after you're on I'll let
      'er go."
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved the yellow paper desperately, while Binns, all
      tense with excitement and desire, began running as fast as
      he could in the direction indicated. Now, if he were lucky,
      he would make it, and Collins would be left behind--think
      of it! He could get them to go ahead, maybe, before Collins
      could get aboard. Oh, my! As he ran and thought, he heard
      the grinding wheels of the express rushing up behind him.
      In a thought, as it were, it was alongside and past, its
      wheels shrieking and emitting sparks. True enough, it was
      stopping! He would be able to get on! Oh, glory! And maybe
      Collins wouldn't be able to! Wouldn't that be wonderful? It
      was far ahead of him now, but almost stock-still, and he
      was running like mad. As he ran he could hear the final
      gritty screech of the wheels against the brakes as the
      train came to a full stop farther on, and then coming up
      and climbing aboard, breathless and gasping painfully, he
      looked back, only to see that his rival had taken a
      diagonal course across the common, and was now not more
      than a hundred feet behind. He would make the train if he
      kept this up. It could scarcely be started quickly enough
      to leave him behind, even if Binns paid for it. Instead of
      setting himself to the stern task of keeping Mr. Collins
      off the train, however, as assuredly Mr. Collins would have
      done--with his fists or his feet, if necessary, or his
      money--Mr. Binns now hesitated, uncertain what to do. On
      the rear platform with him was a brakeman newly stepped
      forth and, coming out of the door, the conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let her go!" he cried to the conductor. "Let her go! It's
      all right! Go on!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't that other fellow want to get on?" asked the latter
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no!" Binns exclaimed irritably and yet pleading.
      "Don't let him on! He hasn't any right on here. I arranged
      to stop this train. I'm from the <i>Star.</i> I'll pay you
      if you don't let him on. It's the train robber I want. Go
      ahead," but even as he spoke Mr. Collins came up, panting
      and wet, but with a leer of triumph and joy over his
      rival's discomfiture written all over his face as he pulled
      himself up the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You thought you'd leave me behind, didn't you?" he sneered
      as he pushed his way upward. "Well, I fooled you this time,
      didn't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now was the crucial moment of Mr. Binns's career had his
      courage been equal to it, but it was not. He had the
      opportunity to do the one thing which might have wrested
      victory from defeat--that is, push Mr. Collins off and keep
      him off. The train was beginning to move. But instead of
      employing this raw force which Mr. Collins would assuredly
      have employed, he hesitated and debated, unable in his
      super-refinement to make up his mind, while Mr. Collins,
      not to be daunted or parleyed with, dashed into the car in
      search of the robber. In the sudden immensity of his
      discomfiture, Binns now followed him with scarcely a
      thought for the moment, only to see Collins bustling up to
      the bandit in the third car ahead who, handcuffed to a
      country sheriff and surrounded by several detectives, was
      staring idly at the passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee, sport," the latter was saying as Mr. Binns sat down,
      patting the burglar familiarly on the knee and fixing him
      with that basilisk gaze of his which was intended to soothe
      and flatter the victim, "that was a great trick you pulled
      off. The paper'll be crazy to find out how you did it. My
      paper, the <i>News,</i> wants a whole page of it. It wants
      your picture, too. Say, you didn't really do it all alone,
      did you? Well, that's what I call swell work, eh, Cap?" and
      now he turned his ingratiating leer on the country sheriff
      and the detectives. In a moment or two more he was telling
      them all what an intimate friend he was of "Billy" Desmond,
      the chief of detectives of O-- and Mr. So-and-So, the chief
      of police, as well as various other dignitaries of that
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plainly, admitted Binns to himself, he was beaten now, as
      much so as this burglar, he thought. His great opportunity
      was gone. What a victory this might have been, and now look
      at it! Disgruntled, he sat down beside his enemy, beginning
      to think what to ask, the while the latter, preening
      himself in his raw way on his success, began congratulating
      the prisoner on his great feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The dull stuff!" thought Mr. Binns. "To think that I
      should have to contend with a creature like this! And these
      are the people he considers something! And he wants a whole
      page for the <i>News!</i> My word! He'd do well if he wrote
      a half-column alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, to his intense chagrin, he could not fail to see
      that Mr. Collins was making excellent headway, not only
      with the country sheriff, who was a big bland creature, but
      the detectives and even the burglar himself. The latter was
      a most unpromising specimen for so unique a deed--short,
      broad-shouldered, heavy- limbed, with a squarish,
      inexpressive, even dull-looking face, blue-gray eyes, dark
      brown hair, big, lumpy, rough hands, and a tanned and
      seamed skin. He wore the cheap, nondescript clothes of a
      laborer, a blue "hickory" shirt, blackish-gray trousers,
      brownish-maroon coat, and a red bandana handkerchief in
      lieu of a collar. On his head was a small round brown hat
      pulled down over his eyes after the manner of a cap. He had
      the still, indifferent expression of a captive bird, and
      when Binns finally faced him and sat down, he seemed
      scarcely to notice either him or Collins, or if so with
      eyes that told nothing. Binns often wondered afterward what
      he really did think. At the same time he was so incensed at
      the mere presence of Collins that he could scarcely speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter had the average detective-politician-gambler's
      habit of simulating an intense interest and an enthusiasm
      which he did not feel, his face wreathing itself in a
      cheery smile, the while his eyes followed one like those of
      a hawk, attempting all the while to discover whether his
      assumed enthusiasm or friendship was being accepted at its
      face value or not. The only time Binns seemed to obtain the
      least grip on this situation, or to impress himself on the
      minds of the detectives and prisoner, was when it came to
      those finer shades of questioning which concerned just why,
      for what ulterior reasons, the burglar had attempted this
      deed alone. But even here, Binns noticed that his confr&egrave;re
      was all ears, and making copious notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But always, to Binns's astonishment and chagrin, the
      prisoner as well as his captors paid more attention to
      Collins than they did to himself. They turned to him as to
      a lamp, and seemed to be really immensely more impressed
      with him than with himself, although the principal lines of
      questioning fell to him. After a time he became so dour and
      enraged that he could think of but one thing that would
      really have satisfied him, and that was to attack Collins
      physically and give him a good beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, by degrees and between them, the story was finally
      extracted, and a fine tale it made. It appeared that up to
      seven or eight months preceding the robbery, possibly a
      year, Rollins had never thought of being a train robber but
      had been only a freight brakeman or yard-hand on this same
      road at one of its division points. Latterly he had even
      been promoted to be a sort of superior switchman and
      assistant freight handler at some station where there was
      considerable work of this kind. Previous to his railroad
      work he had been a livery stable helper in the town where
      he was eventually apprehended, and before that a farmhand
      somewhere near the same place. About a year before the
      crime, owing to hard times, this road had laid off a large
      number of men, including Rollins, and reduced the wages of
      all others by as much as ten per cent. Naturally a great
      deal of labor discontent ensued, and strikes, riots, and
      the like were the order of the day. Again, a certain number
      of train robberies which were charged and traced to
      discharged and dissatisfied employees now followed. The
      methods of successful train robbing were then and there so
      cleverly set forth by the average newspaper that nearly any
      burglar so inclined could follow them. Among other things,
      while working as a freight handler, Rollins had heard of
      the many money shipments made by express companies in their
      express cars, their large amounts, the manner in which they
      were guarded, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road for which he worked at this time, the M.P., was,
      as he now learned, a very popular route for money shipments
      both East and West. And although express messengers (as
      those in charge of the car and its safe were called) were
      well and invariably armed owing to the many train robberies
      which had been occurring in the West recently, still these
      assaults had not been without success. Indeed, the deaths
      of various firemen, engineers, messengers, conductors, and
      even passengers, and the fact that much money had recently
      been stolen and never recovered, had not only encouraged
      the growth of banditry everywhere, but had put such an
      unreasoning fear into most employees connected with the
      roads that but few even of those especially picked guards
      ventured to give these marauders battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just the same, the psychology which eventually resulted
      in this amazing single-handed attempt and its success was
      not so much that Rollins was a poor and discharged railroad
      hand unable to find any other form of employment, although
      that was a part of it, or that he was an amazingly cold,
      cruel and subtle soul, which he was not by any means, but
      that he was really largely unconscious of the tremendous
      risks he was taking. He was just mentally "thick"--well
      insulated, as it were. This was a fact which Binns had to
      bring out and which Collins noted. He had never, as it now
      developed, figured it out from the point of danger, being
      more or less lobster-like in his nervous organism, but
      solely from the point of view of success. In sum, in his
      idleness, having wandered back to his native region where
      he had first started out as a livery hand, he had now
      fallen in love with a young girl there, and then realizing,
      for the first time perhaps, that he was rather hard pressed
      for cash and unable to make her such presents as he
      desired, he had begun to think seriously of some method of
      raising money. Even this had not resulted in anything until
      latterly, another ex-railroad hand who had been laid off by
      this same company arrived and proposed, in connection with
      a third man whom he knew, to rob a train. At this time
      Rollins had rejected this scheme as not feasible, not
      wishing to connect himself with others in any such crime.
      Later, however, his own condition becoming more pressing,
      he had begun to think of train robbing as a means of
      setting himself up in life, only, as he reasoned, it must
      be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why alone? queried Binns.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the point all were so anxious to discover--why
      alone, with all the odds against him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he couldn't say exactly. He had just "kind o' sort o'
      thort," as he expressed it, that he might frighten them
      into letting him alone! Other bandits (so few as three in
      one case of which he had read) had held up large trains.
      Why not one? Revolver shots fired about a train easily
      frightened all passengers as well as all trainmen, so the
      other robbers had told him, and anyhow it was a life to
      death job either way, and it would be better for him, he
      thought, if he worked it out alone instead of with others.
      Often, he said, other men "squealed," or they had girls who
      told on them. He knew that Binns looked at him, intensely
      interested and all but moved by the sheer courage, or
      "gall," or "grit," imbedded somewhere in this stocky frame
    </p>
    <p>
      But how could he hope to overcome the engineer, fireman,
      baggage man, express messenger, mailmen, conductor,
      brakeman and passengers, to say nothing of the Governor and
      his staff? How? By the way, did he know at the time that
      the Governor and his staff were on board? No, he hadn't
      known that until afterward, and as for the others, well, he
      just thought he could overawe them. Collins's eyes were
      luminous as Rollins said this, his face radiant. Far more
      than Binns, he seemed to understand and even approve of the
      raw force of all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner in which Rollins came to fix on this particular
      train to rob was also told. Every Thursday and Friday, or
      so he had been told while he was assistant freight handler,
      a limited which ran West at midnight past Dolesville
      carried larger shipments of money than on other nights.
      This was due to week-end exchanges between Eastern and
      Western banks, although he did not know that. Having
      decided on the train, although not on the day, he had
      proceeded by degrees to secure from one distant small town
      and another, and at different times so as to avoid all
      chance of detection, first, a small handbag from which he
      had scraped all evidence of the maker's name: six or seven
      fused sticks of giant powder such as farmers use to blow up
      stumps; two revolvers holding six cartridges each, and some
      cartridges; and cord and cloth, out of which he proposed to
      make bundles of the money if necessary. Placing all of
      these in his bag, which he kept always beside him, he next
      visited Dolesville, a small town nearest the spot which he
      had fixed on in his mind as the place for his crime, and
      reconnoitering it and its possibilities, finally arranged
      all his plans to a nicety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at the outskirts of this hamlet, as he now told Binns
      and Collins, which had been selected because of its
      proximity to a lone wood and marsh, stood a large
      water-tank at which this express as well as nearly all
      other trains stopped for water. Beyond it, about five
      miles, was the wood with its marsh, where he planned to
      have the train stopped. The express, as he learned, was
      regularly due at about one in the morning. The nearest town
      beyond the wood was all of five miles away, a mere hamlet
      like this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night in question, between eight and nine, he
      carried the bag, minus its revolvers and sticks of giant
      powder, which were now on his person, to that exact spot
      opposite the wood where he wished the train to stop, and
      left it there beside the railroad track. He then walked
      back the five miles to the water-tank, where he concealed
      himself and waited for the train. When it stopped, and just
      before it started again, he slipped in between the engine
      tender and the front baggage car, which was "blind" at both
      ends. The train resumed its journey, but on reaching the
      spot where he felt sure the bag should be, he could not
      make it out. The engine headlight did not seem to reveal
      it. Fearing to lose his chance and realizing that he was at
      about the place where he had left it, he rose up, and
      climbing over the coal-box, covered the two men in the cab,
      and compelled them to stop the train, dismount and uncouple
      the engine. Then, revolver in hand, he drove them before
      him to the express car door where, presenting one with a
      fused stick of giant powder, he forced him to blow open the
      door; the messenger within, still refusing to open it
      although he would not fire, for fear of killing either the
      engineer or fireman. Both engineer and fireman, at his
      command, then entered the car and blew open the money safe,
      throwing out the packages of bills and coin at his word,
      the while Rollins, realizing the danger of either trainmen
      or passengers coming forward, had been firing a few shots
      backward toward the rear coaches so as to overawe the
      passengers, and at the same time kept calling to purely
      imaginary companions to keep watch there. It was these
      shots and calls that had presumably sent the Governor and
      his staff scurrying to their berths. They also put the fear
      of death into the minds of the engineer and fireman and
      messenger, who imagined that he had many confr&egrave;res on the
      other side of the express car but for some reason, because
      he was the leader, no doubt, preferred to act alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't kill anybody, boys, unless you have to," is what
      Rollins said he called, or "That's all right, Frank. Stay
      over there. Watch that side. I'll take care of these." Then
      he would fire a few more shots, and so all were deluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the express car door and safe had been blown open and
      the money handed out, he had now compelled the engineer and
      fireman to come down, recouple the engine, and pull away.
      Only after the train had safely disappeared in the distance
      did he venture to gather up the various packages, only
      since he had lost his bag and had no light, he had to
      fumble about and make a bag of his coat for them. With this
      over his shoulder, he eventually staggered off into the
      wood and marsh, concealing it under muck and stones, and
      then making for safety himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as it turned out, two slight errors, one of
      forgetfulness and one of eyesight, caused him to finally
      lose the fruit of his victory. The loss of the bag, in
      which he had first placed and then forgotten an initialed
      handkerchief belonging to his love, eventually brought
      about his capture. It is true that he had gone back to look
      for the bag, without, however, remembering that the
      handkerchief was in it, but fearing capture if he lingered
      too long, had made off after a time without it. Later a
      posse of detectives and citizens arriving and finding the
      bag with the initialed handkerchief inside, they were
      eventually able to trace him. For, experts meditating on
      the crime, decided that owing to the hard times and the
      laying-off of employees, some of the latter might have had
      a hand in it, and so, in due time, the whereabouts and
      movements of each and every one of them was gone into,
      resulting in the discovery finally that this particular
      ex-helper had returned rather recently to his semi-native
      town and had there been going with a certain girl, and that
      even now he was about to marry her. Also, it was said that
      he was possessed of unusual means, for him. Next, it was
      discovered that her initials corresponded to those on the
      handkerchief. Presto, Mr. Rollins was arrested, a search
      made of his room, and nearly all of the money recovered.
      Then, being "caught with the goods," he confessed, and here
      on this day was he being hurried to O-- to be jailed and
      sentenced, while Mr. Binns and Mr. Collins, like harpies,
      hovered over him, anxious to make literary capital of his
      error. The only thing that consoled Mr. Binns, now that
      this story was finally told, was that although he had
      failed to make it impossible for Collins to get it, when it
      came to the writing of it he would be able to outdo him,
      making a better and more connected narrative. Still, even
      here he was a little dubious. During this interview Collins
      had been making endless notes, putting down each least
      shade of Binns's questioning, and with the aid of one or
      several of the best men of the <i>News</i> would probably
      be able to work it out. Then what would be left?
    </p>
    <p>
      But as they were nearing O-- a new situation intruded
      itself which soon threatened on the face of it to rob Binns
      of nearly, if not quite, all his advantage. And this
      related, primarily, to the matter of a picture. It was most
      essential that one should be made, either here or in the
      city, only neither Waxby nor himself, nor the city editor
      of the <i>News</i> apparently, had thought to include an
      artist on this expedition. Now the importance of this
      became more and more apparent, and Collins, with that keen
      sense he had for making tremendous capital of seeming
      by-products, suggested, after first remarking that he
      "guessed" they would have to send to police headquarters
      afterward and have one made:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How would it do, old man, if we took him up to the
      <i>News</i> office after we get in, and let your friends
      Hill and Weaver make a picture of him?" (These two were
      intimates of Binns in the art department, as Collins
      happened to know.) "Then both of us could get one right
      away. I'd say take him to the <i>Star,</i> only the
      <i>News</i> is so much nearer" (which was true), "and we
      have that new flash-light machine, you know" (which was
      also true, the <i>Star</i> being but poorly equipped in
      this respect). He added a friendly aside to the effect that
      of course this depended on whether the prisoner and
      officers in charge were willing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no!" replied Binns irritably and suspiciously.
      "No, I won't do that. You mean you want to get him into the
      <i>News</i> office first. Not at all. I'll never stand for
      that. Hill and Weaver are my friends, but I won't do it. If
      you want to bring him down to the <i>Star,</i> that's
      different. I'll agree to that. Our art department can make
      pictures just as good as yours, and you can have one."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Collins's face fell, but he soon returned to
      the attack. From his manner one would have judged that he
      was actually desirous of doing Binns a favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why not the <i>News?"</i> he insisted pleasantly.
      "Those two boys are your friends. They wouldn't do anything
      to hurt you. Think of the difference in the distance, the
      time we'll save. We want to save time, don't we? Here it is
      nearly six-thirty, and by the time we get back to the
      office it'll be half-past seven or eight. It's all right
      for you, because you can write faster, but look at me. I'd
      just as lief go down there as not, but what's the
      difference? Besides the <i>News</i> has got a better plant,
      and you know it. Either Hill or Weaver'll make a fine
      picture, and they'll give you one. Ain't that all right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At once he sensed what it was that Collins wanted. What he
      really understood was that if Collins could get this great
      train robber into the office of the <i>News first,</i> it
      would take away so much of the sheer necessity he would be
      put to of repeating all he had heard and seen en route. For
      once there, other staff members would be able to take the
      criminal in hand and with the aid of what Collins had to
      report, extract such a tale as even Binns himself could not
      better. In addition, it would be such a triumph of
      reporting--to go out and bring your subject in!
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it's not," replied Binns truculently, "and I won't do
      it. It's all right about Hill and Weaver. I know they'll
      give me a picture if the paper will let them, but I know
      the paper won't let them, and besides, you're not doing it
      for that reason. I know what you want. You want to be able
      to claim in the morning that you brought this man to the
      <i>News first.</i> I know you."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Collins appeared to be quieted by this, and
      half seemed to abandon the project. He took it up again
      after a few moments, however, seemingly in the most
      conciliatory spirit in the world, only now he kept boring
      Binns with his eyes, a thing which he had never attempted
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, come on," he repeated genially, looking Binns squarely
      in the eyes. "What's the use being small about this? You
      know you've got the best of the story anyhow. And you're
      goin' to get a picture too, the same as us. If you don't,
      then we'll have to go clear to your office or send a man
      down to the jail. Think of the time it'll take. What's the
      use of that? One picture's as good as another. And you
      can't take any good pictures down there to-night, anyhow,
      and you know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he talked he held Binns's eyes with his own, and all at
      once the latter began to feel a curious wave of warmth,
      ease and uncertainty or confusion creep over him in
      connection with all this. What was so wrong with this
      proposition, anyhow, he began to ask himself, even while
      inwardly something was telling him that it was all wrong
      and that he was making a great mistake. For the first time
      in his life, and especially in connection with so trying a
      situation, he began to feel an odd sense of ease and
      comfort, or as if surrounded by a cloud of something that
      was comfortable and soothing. This scheme of Collins's was
      not so bad after all, he thought. What was wrong with it?
      Hill and Weaver were his friends. They would make a good
      picture and give him one. Everything Collins was saying
      seemed true enough, only, only-- For the first time since
      knowing him, and in spite of all his opposition of this
      afternoon and before, Binns found himself not hating his
      rival as violently as he had in the past, but feeling as
      though he weren't such an utterly bad sort after all.
      Curiously, though, he still didn't believe a word that
      Collins said, but--
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the <i>News,</i> sure," he found himself saying in a
      dumb, half-numb or sensuously warm way. "That wouldn't be
      so bad. It's nearer. What's wrong with that? Hill or Weaver
      will make a good picture seven or eight inches long, and
      then I can take it along," only at the same time he was
      thinking to himself, "I shouldn't really do this. I
      shouldn't think it. He'll claim the credit of having
      brought this man to the <i>News</i> office. He's a big
      bluff, and I hate him. I'll be making a big mistake. The
      <i>Star</i> or nothing--that's what I should say. Let him
      come down to the <i>Star."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime they were entering O--, the station of
      which now appeared. By now, somehow, Collins had not only
      convinced the officers, but the prisoner himself. Binns
      could even see the rural love of show and parade a-gleam in
      their eyes, their respect for the <i>News,</i> the larger
      paper, as opposed to the <i>Star.</i> The <i>Star</i> might
      be all right, but plainly the <i>News</i> was the great
      place in the sight of these rurals for such an exhibition
      as this. What a pity, he thought, that he had ever left the
      <i>News!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      As he arose with the others to leave the train he said
      dully, "No, I won't come in on this. It's all right if you
      want to bring him down to the <i>Star,</i> or you can take
      him to police headquarters. But I'm not going to let you do
      this. You hear now, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But outside, Collins laying hold of his arm in an amazingly
      genial fashion, seemed to come nearer to him humanly than
      he had ever dreamed was possible before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You come up with me to the <i>News</i> now," Collins kept
      saying, "and then I'll go down with you to the <i>Star,</i>
      see? We'll just let Hill or Weaver take one picture, and
      then we'll go down to your place--you see?"
    </p>

      Although Mr. Binns did not see, he went. For the time,
      nothing seemed important. If Collins had stayed by him he
      could possibly have prevented his writing any story at all.
      Even as Binns dreamed, Collins hailed a carriage, and the
      six of them crowded into it and were forthwith whirled away
      to the door of the <i>News</i> where, once they had reached
      it and Collins, the detectives, and the bandit began
      hurrying across the sidewalk to that familiar door which
      once had meant so much to him, Binns suddenly awoke. What
      was it--the door? Or the temporary distraction of Collins?
      At any rate, he awoke now and made a frantic effort to
      retrieve himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait!" he called. "Say, hold on! Stop! I won't do this at
      all. I don't agree to this!" but now it was too late. In a
      trice the prisoner, officers, Collins and even himself were
      up the two or three low steps of the main entrance and into
      the hall, and then seeing the hopelessness of it he paused
      as they entered the elevator and was left to meditate on
      the inexplicability of the thing that had been done to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it? How had this low brute succeeded in doing this
      to him? By the Lord, he had succeeded in hypnotizing him,
      or something very much like it. What had become, then, of
      his superior brain, his intellectual force, in the face of
      this gross savage desire on the part of Collins to win? It
      was unbelievable. Collins had beaten him, and that in a
      field and at a task at which he deemed himself unusually
      superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great heavens!" he suddenly exclaimed to himself. "That's
      what he's done, he's beaten me at my own game! He's taken
      the prisoner, whom I really had in my own hands at one
      time, into the office of our great rival, and now in the
      morning it will all be in the paper! And I allowed him to
      do it! And I had him beaten, too! Why didn't I kick him off
      the train? Why didn't I bribe the conductor to help me? I
      could have. I was afraid of him, that's what it is. And
      to-morrow there'll be a long editorial in the News telling
      how this fellow was brought first to the <i>News</i> and
      photographed, and they'll have his picture to prove it. Oh,
      Lord, what shall I do? How am I to get out of this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Disconsolate and weary, he groaned and swore for blocks as
      he made his way toward the office of the <i>Star</i>. How
      to break it to Waxby! How to explain! The exact truth meant
      disgrace, possibly dismissal. He couldn't tell really, as
      he had hoped he might, how he had all but prevented Collins
      from obtaining any interview. Waxby would have sniffed at
      his weakness in a crisis, put him down as a failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the office, he told another kind of story which
      was but a half truth. What he could and did say was that
      the police, being temperamentally <i>en rapport</i> with
      Collins, had worked with him and against the <i>Star;</i>
      that in spite of anything he could do, these rural officers
      and detectives had preferred to follow Collins rather than
      himself, that the superior position of the <i>News</i> had
      lured them, and that against his final and fierce protest
      they had eventually gone in there, since the <i>News</i>
      was on the natural route to the jail, and the <i>Star</i>
      was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was Waxby's turn to rage, and he did--not at Binns,
      but at the low dogs of police who were always favoring the
      <i>News</i> at the expense of the <i>Star.</i> They had
      done it in the past, as he well knew, when he was city
      editor of the <i>News.</i> Then it had pleased him--but
      now--
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll fix them!" he squeaked shrilly. "I'll make them
      sweat. No more favors from me, by--," and rushing a
      photographer to the jail he had various pictures made,
      excellent ones, for that matter--only, what was the good?
      The fact that the <i>News</i> had the honor of making the
      first picture of this celebrity under its own roof, its own
      vine and fig-tree, was galling. As a matter of fact, Waxby
      by now was blaming himself for not having sent an artist
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Binns the sad part was that Collins had him beaten,
      and that in the face of his self-boasted superiority. In
      spite of the fact that he might slave over the text, as he
      did, giving it, because of his despair and chagrin, all his
      best touches, still, the next morning, there on the front
      page of the <i>News,</i> was a large picture of the bandit
      seated in the sanctum sanctorum of the <i>News,</i>
      entirely surrounded by reporters and editors, and with a
      portion of the figure, although not the head, of the
      publisher himself in the background. And over it all in
      extra large type was the caption:
    </p>
    <p>
      "LOAN TRAIN ROBBER VISITS OFFICE OF <i>NEWS</i> TO PAY HIS
      RESPECTS" while underneath, in italics, was a full account
      of how <i>willingly</i> he had visited the <i>News</i>
      because of its immense commercial, moral and other forms of
      superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Binns beaten?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, rather!
    </p>
    <p>
      And did he feel it?
    </p>
    <p>
      He suffered tortures, not only for days, but for weeks and
      months, absolute tortures. The very thought of Collins made
      him want to rise and slay him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To think," he said over and over to himself, "that a low
      dog like Collins on whom I wouldn't wipe my feet
      intellectually, as it were, could do this to me! He
      hypnotized me, by George! He did! He can! Maybe he could do
      it again! I wonder if he knows? Am I really the lesser and
      this scum the greater? Do writers grow on trees?"!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sad thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      And some weeks later, meeting his old enemy one day on the
      street, he had the immense dissatisfaction of seeing the
      light of triumph and contempt in his eyes. The latter was
      so bold now, and getting along so well as a
      <i>reporter,</i> or "newspaper man," that he had the
      hardihood to leer, sniff and exclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
      "These swell reporters! These high-priced ink-slingers!
      Say, who got the best of the train robber story, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Binns replied--
    </p>
    <p>
      But never mind what Binns replied. It wouldn't be fit to
      read, and no publisher would print it anyhow.

    <h1>
      <a name="a7" id="a7">OLD ROGAUM AND HIS THERESA</a>
    </h1>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      In all Bleecker Street was no more comfortable doorway than
      that of the butcher Rogaum, even if the first floor was
      given over to meat market purposes. It was to one side of
      the main entrance, which gave ingress to the butcher shop,
      and from it led up a flight of steps, at least five feet
      wide, to the living rooms above. A little portico stood out
      in front of it, railed on either side, and within was a
      second or final door, forming, with the outer or storm
      door, a little area, where Mrs. Rogaum and her children
      frequently sat of a summer's evening. The outer door was
      never locked, owing to the inconvenience it would inflict
      on Mr. Rogaum, who had no other way of getting upstairs. In
      winter, when all had gone to bed, there had been cases in
      which belated travelers had taken refuge there from the
      snow or sleet. One or two newsboys occasionally slept
      there, until routed out by Officer Maguire, who, seeing it
      half open one morning at two o'clock, took occasion to look
      in. He jogged the newsboys sharply with his stick, and
      then, when they were gone, tried the inner door, which was
      locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to keep that outer door locked, Rogaum," he
      observed to the phlegmatic butcher the next evening, as he
      was passing, "people might get in. A couple o' kids was
      sleepin' in there last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach, dot iss no difference," answered Rogaum pleasantly.
      "I haf der inner door locked, yet. Let dem sleep. Dot iss
      no difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better lock it," said the officer, more to vindicate his
      authority than anything else. "Something will happen there
      yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was never locked, however, and now of a summer
      evening Mrs. Rogaum and the children made pleasant use of
      its recess, watching the rout of street cars and
      occasionally belated trucks go by. The children played on
      the sidewalk, all except the budding Theresa (eighteen just
      turning), who, with one companion of the neighborhood, the
      pretty Kenrihan girl, walked up and down the block,
      laughing, glancing, watching the boys. Old Mrs. Kenrihan
      lived in the next block, and there, sometimes, the two
      stopped. There, also, they most frequently pretended to be
      when talking with the boys in the intervening side street.
      Young "Connie" Almerting and George Goujon were the bright
      particular mashers who held the attention of the maidens in
      this block. These two made their acquaintance in the
      customary bold, boyish way, and thereafter the girls had an
      urgent desire to be out in the street together after eight,
      and to linger where the boys could see and overtake them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mrs. Rogaum never knew. She was a particularly fat, old
      German lady, completely dominated by her liege and portly
      lord, and at nine o'clock regularly, as he had long ago
      deemed meet and fit, she was wont to betake her way upward
      and so to bed. Old Rogaum himself, at that hour, closed the
      market and went to his chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that all the children were called sharply, once from
      the doorstep below and once from the window above, only
      Mrs. Rogaum did it first and Rogaum last. It had come,
      because of a shade of lenience, not wholly apparent in the
      father's nature, that the older of the children needed two
      callings and sometimes three. Theresa, now that she had
      "got in" with the Kenrihan maiden, needed that many calls
      and even more.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was just at that age for which mere thoughtless,
      sensory life holds its greatest charm. She loved to walk up
      and down in the as yet bright street where were voices and
      laughter, and occasionally moonlight streaming down. What a
      nuisance it was to be called at nine, anyhow. Why should
      one have to go in then, anyhow. What old fogies her parents
      were, wishing to go to bed so early. Mrs. Kenrihan was not
      so strict with her daughter. It made her pettish when
      Rogaum insisted, calling as he often did, in German, "Come
      you now," in a very hoarse and belligerent voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came, eventually, frowning and wretched, all the
      moonlight calling her, all the voices of the night urging
      her to come back. Her innate opposition due to her urgent
      youth made her coming later and later, however, until now,
      by August of this, her eighteenth year, it was nearly ten
      when she entered, and Rogaum was almost invariably angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I vill lock you oudt," he declared, in strongly accented
      English, while she tried to slip by him each time. "I vill
      show you. Du sollst come ven I say, yet. Hear now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll not," answered Theresa, but it was always under her
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mrs. Rogaum troubled at hearing the wrath in her
      husband's voice. It spoke of harder and fiercer times which
      had been with her. Still she was not powerful enough in the
      family councils to put in a weighty word. So Rogaum fumed
      unrestricted.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other nights, however, many of them, and now
      that the young sparks of the neighborhood had enlisted the
      girls' attention, it was a more trying time than ever.
      Never did a street seem more beautiful. Its shabby red
      walls, dusty pavements and protruding store steps and iron
      railings seemed bits of the ornamental paraphernalia of
      heaven itself. These lights, the cars, the moon, the street
      lamps! Theresa had a tender eye for the dashing Almerting,
      a young idler and loafer of the district, the son of a
      stationer farther up the street. What a fine fellow he was,
      indeed! What a handsome nose and chin! What eyes! What
      authority! His cigarette was always cocked at a high angle,
      in her presence, and his hat had the least suggestion of
      being set to one side. He had a shrewd way of winking one
      eye, taking her boldly by the arm, hailing her as, "Hey,
      Pretty!" and was strong and athletic and worked (when he
      worked) in a tobacco factory. His was a trade, indeed,
      nearly acquired, as he said, and his jingling pockets
      attested that he had money of his own. Altogether he was
      very captivating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, whaddy ya want to go in for?" he used to say to her,
      tossing his head gayly on one side to listen and holding
      her by the arm, as old Rogaum called. "Tell him yuh didn't
      hear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I've got to go," said the girl, who was soft and plump
      and fair--a Rhine maiden type.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yuh don't have to go just yet. Stay another minute.
      George, what was that fellow's name that tried to sass us
      the other day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Theresa!" roared old Rogaum forcefully. "If you do not now
      come! Ve vill see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got to go," repeated Theresa with a faint effort at
      starting. "Can't you hear? Don't hold me. I haf to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, whaddy ya want to be such a coward for? Y' don't have
      to go. He won't do nothin' tuh yuh. My old man was always
      hollerin' like that up tuh a coupla years ago. Let him
      holler! Say, kid, but yuh got sweet eyes! They're as blue!
      An' your mouth--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now stop! You hear me!" Theresa would protest softly, as,
      swiftly, he would slip an arm about her waist and draw her
      to him, sometimes in a vain, sometimes in a successful
      effort to kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule she managed to interpose an elbow between her
      face and his, but even then he would manage to touch an ear
      or a cheek or her neck--sometimes her mouth, full and
      warm--before she would develop sufficient energy to push
      him away and herself free. Then she would protest mock
      earnestly or sometimes run away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, I'll never speak to you any more, if that's the way
      you're going to do. My father don't allow me to kiss boys,
      anyhow," and then she would run, half ashamed, half smiling
      to herself as he would stare after her, or if she lingered,
      develop a kind of anger and even rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, cut it! Whaddy ya want to be so shy for? Dontcha like
      me? What's gettin' into yuh, anyhow? Hey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime George Goujon and Myrtle Kenrihan, their
      companions, might be sweeting and going through a similar
      contest, perhaps a hundred feet up the street or near at
      hand. The quality of old Rogaum's voice would by now have
      become so raucous, however, that Theresa would have lost
      all comfort in the scene and, becoming frightened, hurry
      away. Then it was often that both Almerting and Goujon as
      well as Myrtle Kenrihan would follow her to the corner,
      almost in sight of the irate old butcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him call," young Almerting would insist, laying a
      final hold on her soft white fingers and causing her to
      quiver thereby.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," she would gasp nervously. "I can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go on, then," he would say, and with a flip of his
      heel would turn back, leaving Theresa to wonder whether she
      had alienated him forever or no. Then she would hurry to
      her father's door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Muss ich all my time spenden calling, mit you on de
      streeds oudt?" old Rogaum would roar wrathfully, the while
      his fat hand would descend on her back. "Take dot now. Vy
      don'd you come ven I call? In now. I vill show you. Und
      come you yussed vunce more at dis time--ve vill see if I am
      boss in my own house, aber! Komst du vun minute nach ten
      to-morrow und you vill see vot you vill get. I vill der
      door lock. Du sollst not in kommen. Mark! Oudt sollst du
      stayen--oudt!" and he would glare wrathfully at her
      retreating figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Theresa would whimper, sometimes cry or sulk. She
      almost hated her father for his cruelty, "the big, fat,
      rough thing," and just because she wanted to stay out in
      the bright streets, too! Because he was old and stout and
      wanted to go to bed at ten, he thought every one else did.
      And outside was the dark sky with its stars, the street
      lamps, the cars, the tinkle and laughter of eternal life!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" she would sigh as she undressed and crawled into her
      small neat bed. To think that she had to live like this all
      her days! At the same time old Rogaum was angry and equally
      determined. It was not so much that he imagined that his
      Theresa was in bad company as yet, but he wished to
      forefend against possible danger. This was not a good
      neighborhood by any means. The boys around here were tough.
      He wanted Theresa to pick some nice sober youth from among
      the other Germans he and his wife knew here and there--at
      the Lutheran Church, for instance. Otherwise she shouldn't
      marry. He knew she only walked from his shop to the door of
      the Kenrihans and back again. Had not his wife told him so?
      If he had thought upon what far pilgrimage her feet had
      already ventured, or had even seen the dashing Almerting
      hanging near, then had there been wrath indeed. As it was,
      his mind was more or less at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      On many, many evenings it was much the same. Sometimes she
      got in on time, sometimes not, but more and more "Connie"
      Almerting claimed her for his "steady," and bought her
      ice-cream. In the range of the short block and its
      confining corners it was all done, lingering by the
      curbstone and strolling a half block either way in the side
      streets, until she had offended seriously at home, and the
      threat was repeated anew. He often tried to persuade her to
      go on picnics or outings of various kinds, but this,
      somehow, was not to be thought of at her age--at least with
      him. She knew her father would never endure the thought,
      and never even had the courage to mention it, let alone run
      away. Mere lingering with him at the adjacent street
      corners brought stronger and stronger admonishments--even
      more blows and the threat that she should not get in at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well enough she meant to obey, but on one radiant night
      late in June the time fled too fast. The moon was so
      bright, the air so soft. The feel of far summer things was
      in the wind and even in this dusty street. Theresa, in a
      newly starched white summer dress, had been loitering up
      and down with Myrtle when as usual they encountered
      Almerting and Goujon. Now it was ten, and the regular calls
      were beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, wait a minute," said "Connie." "Stand still. He won't
      lock yuh out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he will, though," said Theresa. "You don't know him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if he does, come on back to me. I'll take care of
      yuh. I'll be here. But he won't though. If you stayed out a
      little while he'd letcha in all right. That's the way my
      old man used to try to do me but it didn't work with me. I
      stayed out an' he let me in, just the same. Don'tcha let
      him kidja." He jingled some loose change in his pocket
    </p>
    <p>
      Never in his life had he had a girl on his hands at any
      unseasonable hour, but it was nice to talk big, and there
      was a club to which he belonged, The Varick Street
      Roosters, and to which he had a key. It would be closed and
      empty at this hour, and she could stay there until morning,
      if need be or with Myrtle Kenrihan. He would take her there
      if she insisted. There was a sinister grin on the youth's
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      By now Theresa's affections had carried her far. This youth
      with his slim body, his delicate strong hands, his fine
      chin, straight mouth and hard dark eyes--how wonderful he
      seemed! He was but nineteen to her eighteen but cold,
      shrewd, daring. Yet how tender he seemed to her, how well
      worth having! Always, when he kissed her now, she trembled
      in the balance. There was something in the iron grasp of
      his fingers that went through her like fire. His glance
      held hers at times when she could scarcely endure it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll wait, anyhow," he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longer and longer she lingered, but now for once no voice
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to feel that something was wrong--a greater
      strain than if old Rogaum's voice had been filling the
      whole neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got to go," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gee, but you're a coward, yuh are!" said he derisively.
      "What 'r yuh always so scared about? He always says he'll
      lock yuh out, but he never does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but he will," she insisted nervously. "I think he has
      this time. You don't know him. He's something awful when he
      gets real mad. Oh, Connie, I must go!" For the sixth or
      seventh time she moved, and once more he caught her arm and
      waist and tried to kiss her, but she slipped away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yuh!" he exclaimed. "I wish he would lock yuh out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At her own doorstep she paused momentarily, more to soften
      her progress than anything. The outer door was open as
      usual, but not the inner. She tried it, but it would not
      give. It was locked! For a moment she paused, cold fear
      racing over her body, and then knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she rattled the door, this time nervously, and was
      about to cry out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she heard her father's voice, hoarse and
      indifferent, not addressed to her at all, but to her
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let her go, now," it said savagely, from the front room
      where he supposed she could not hear. "I vill her a lesson
      teach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hadn't you better let her in now, yet?" pleaded Mrs.
      Rogaum faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," insisted Mr. Rogaum. "Nefer! Let her go now. If she
      vill alvays stay oudt, let her stay now. Ve vill see how
      she likes dot."
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was rich in wrath, and he was saving up a good
      beating for her into the bargain, that she knew. She would
      have to wait and wait and plead, and when she was
      thoroughly wretched and subdued he would let her in and
      beat her--such a beating as she had never received in all
      her born days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the door rattled, and still she got no answer. Not
      even her call brought a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, strangely, a new element, not heretofore apparent in
      her nature but nevertheless wholly there, was called into
      life, springing in action as Diana, full formed. Why should
      he always be so harsh? She hadn't done anything but stay
      out a little later than usual. He was always so anxious to
      keep her in and subdue her. For once the cold chill of her
      girlish fears left her, and she wavered angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right," she said, some old German stubbornness
      springing up, "I won't knock. You don't need to let me in,
      then."
    </p>
    <p>
      A suggestion of tears was in her eyes, but she backed
      firmly out onto the stoop and sat down, hesitating. Old
      Rogaum saw her, lowering down from the lattice, but said
      nothing. He would teach her for once what were proper
      hours!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner, standing, Almerting also saw her. He
      recognized the simple white dress, and paused steadily, a
      strange thrill racing over him. Really they had locked her
      out! Gee, this was new. It was great, in a way. There she
      was, white, quiet, shut out, waiting at her father's
      doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting thus, Theresa pondered a moment, her girlish
      rashness and anger dominating her. Her pride was hurt and
      she felt revengeful. They would shut her out, would they?
      All right, she would go out and they should look to it how
      they would get her back--the old curmudgeons. For the
      moment the home of Myrtle Kenrihan came to her as a
      possible refuge, but she decided that she need not go there
      yet. She had better wait about awhile and see--or walk and
      frighten them. He would beat her, would he? Well, maybe he
      would and maybe he wouldn't. She might come back, but still
      that was a thing afar off. Just now it didn't matter so
      much. "Connie" was still there on the corner. He loved her
      dearly. She felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting up, she stepped to the now quieting sidewalk and
      strolled up the street. It was a rather nervous procedure,
      however. There were street cars still, and stores lighted
      and people passing, but soon these would not be, and she
      was locked out. The side streets were already little more
      than long silent walks and gleaming rows of lamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner her youthful lover almost pounced upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Locked out, are yuh?" he asked, his eyes shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment she was delighted to see him, for a nameless
      dread had already laid hold of her. Home meant so much. Up
      to now it had been her whole life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she answered feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let's stroll on a little," said the boy. He had not
      as yet quite made up his mind what to do, but the night was
      young. It was so fine to have her with him--his.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the farther corner they passed Officers Maguire and
      Delahanty, idly swinging their clubs and discussing
      politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis a shame," Officer Delahanty was saying, "the way
      things are run now," but he paused to add, "Ain't that old
      Rogaum's girl over there with young Almerting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," replied Maguire, looking after.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm thinkin' he'd better be keepin' an eye on her,"
      said the former. "She's too young to be runnin' around with
      the likes o' him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maguire agreed. "He's a young tough," he observed. "I never
      liked him. He's too fresh. He works over here in Myer's
      tobacco factory, and belongs to The Roosters. He's up to no
      good, I'll warrant that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Teach 'em a lesson, I would," Almerting was saying to
      Theresa as they strolled on. "We'll walk around a while an'
      make 'em think yuh mean business. They won't lock yuh out
      any more. If they don't let yuh in when we come back I'll
      find yuh a place, all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      His sharp eyes were gleaming as he looked around into her
      own. Already he had made up his mind that she should not go
      back if he could help it. He knew a better place than home
      for this night, anyhow--the club room of the Roosters, if
      nowhere else. They could stay there for a time, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      By now old Rogaum, who had seen her walking up the street
      alone, was marveling at her audacity, but thought she would
      soon come back. It was amazing that she should exhibit such
      temerity, but he would teach her! Such a whipping! At
      half-past ten, however, he stuck his head out of the open
      window and saw nothing of her. At eleven, the same. Then he
      walked the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first wrathful, then nervous, then nervous and wrathful,
      he finally ended all nervous, without a scintilla of wrath.
      His stout wife sat up in bed and began to wring her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lie down!" he commanded. "You make me sick. I know vot I
      am doing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she still at der door?" pleaded the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said. "I don't tink so. She should come ven I
      call."
    </p>
    <p>
      His nerves were weakening, however, and now they finally
      collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She vent de stread up," he said anxiously after a time. "I
      vill go after."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slipping on his coat, he went down the stairs and out into
      the night. It was growing late, and the stillness and gloom
      of midnight were nearing. Nowhere in sight was his Theresa.
      First one way and then another he went, looking here,
      there, everywhere, finally groaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach, Gott!" he said, the sweat bursting out on his brow,
      "vot in Teufel's name iss dis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought he would seek a policeman, but there was none.
      Officer Maguire had long since gone for a quiet game in one
      of the neighboring saloons. His partner had temporarily
      returned to his own beat. Still old Rogaum hunted on,
      worrying more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he bethought him to hasten home again, for she must
      have got back. Mrs. Rogaum, too, would be frantic if she
      had not. If she were not there he must go to the police.
      Such a night! And his Theresa-- This thing could not go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned into his own corner he almost ran, coming up
      to the little portico wet and panting. At a puffing step he
      turned, and almost fell over a white body at his feet, a
      prone and writhing woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach, Gott!" he cried aloud, almost shouting in his
      distress and excitement. "Theresa, vot iss dis? Wilhelmina,
      a light now. Bring a light now, I say, for himmel's sake!
      Theresa hat sich <i>umgebracht.</i> Help!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had fallen to his knees and was turning over the
      writhing, groaning figure. By the pale light of the street,
      however, he could make out that it was not his Theresa,
      fortunately, as he had at first feared, but another and yet
      there was something very like her in the figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Um!" said the stranger weakly. "Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The dress was gray, not white as was his Theresa's, but the
      body was round and plump. It cut the fiercest cords of his
      intensity, this thought of death to a young woman, but
      there was something else about the situation which made him
      forget his own troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rogaum, loudly admonished, almost tumbled down the
      stairs. At the foot she held the light she had brought--a
      small glass oil-lamp--and then nearly dropped it. A fairly
      attractive figure, more girl than woman, rich in all the
      physical charms that characterize a certain type, lay near
      to dying. Her soft hair had fallen back over a good
      forehead, now quite white. Her pretty hands, well decked
      with rings, were clutched tightly in an agonized grip. At
      her neck a blue silk shirtwaist and light lace collar were
      torn away where she had clutched herself, and on the white
      flesh was a yellow stain as of one who had been burned. A
      strange odor reeked in the area, and in one corner was a
      spilled bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach, Gott!" exclaimed Mrs. Rogaum. "It iss a vooman! She
      haf herself gekilt. Run for der police! Oh, my! oh, my!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rogaum did not kneel for more than a moment. Somehow, this
      creature's fate seemed in some psychic way identified with
      that of his own daughter. He bounded up, and jumping out
      his front door, began to call lustily for the police.
      Officer Maguire, at his social game nearby, heard the very
      first cry and came running.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter here, now?" he exclaimed, rushing up
      full and ready for murder, robbery, fire, or, indeed,
      anything in the whole roster of human calamities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A vooman!" said Rogaum excitedly. "She haf herself
      <i>umgebracht.</i> She iss dying. Ach, Gott! in my own
      doorstep, yet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vere iss der hospital?" put in Mrs. Rogaum, thinking
      clearly of an ambulance, but not being able to express it.
      "She iss gekilt, sure. Oh! Oh!" and bending over her the
      poor old motherly soul stroked the tightened hands, and
      trickled tears upon the blue shirtwaist. "Ach, vy did you
      do dot?" she said. "Ach, for vy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Officer Maguire was essentially a man of action. He jumped
      to the sidewalk, amid the gathering company, and beat
      loudly with his club upon the stone flagging. Then he ran
      to the nearest police phone, returning to aid in any other
      way he might. A milk wagon passing on its way from the
      Jersey ferry with a few tons of fresh milk aboard, he held
      it up and demanded a helping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give us a quart there, will you?" he said authoritatively.
      "A woman's swallowed acid in here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure," said the driver, anxious to learn the cause of the
      excitement. "Got a glass, anybody?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Maguire ran back and returned, bearing a measure. Mrs.
      Rogaum stood looking nervously on, while the stocky officer
      raised the golden head and poured the milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, now, drink this," he said. "Come on. Try an' swallow
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, a blonde of the type the world too well knows,
      opened her eyes, and looked, groaning a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink it," shouted the officer fiercely. "Do you want to
      die? Open your mouth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Used to a fear of the law in all her days, she obeyed now,
      even in death. The lips parted, the fresh milk was drained
      to the end, some spilling on neck and cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were working old Rogaum came back and stood
      looking on, by the side of his wife. Also Officer
      Delahanty, having heard the peculiar wooden ring of the
      stick upon the stone in the night, had come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach, ach," exclaimed Rogaum rather distractedly, "und she
      iss oudt yet. I could not find her. Oh, oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a clang of a gong up the street as the racing
      ambulance turned rapidly in. A young hospital surgeon
      dismounted, and seeing the woman's condition, ordered
      immediate removal. Both officers and Rogaum, as well as the
      surgeon, helped place her in the ambulance. After a moment
      the lone bell, ringing wildly in the night, was all the
      evidence remaining that a tragedy had been here.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know how she came here?" asked Officer Delahanty,
      coming back to get Rogaum's testimony for the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," answered Rogaum wretchedly. "She vass here
      alretty. I vass for my daughter loog. Ach, himmel, I haf my
      daughter lost. She iss avay."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rogaum also chattered, the significance of Theresa's
      absence all the more painfully emphasized by this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer did not at first get the import of this. He was
      only interested in the facts of the present case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say she was here when you come? Where was you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say I vass for my daughter loog. I come here, und der
      vooman vass here now alretty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. What time was this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only now yet. Yussed a half-hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Officer Maguire had strolled up, after chasing away a small
      crowd that had gathered with fierce and unholy threats. For
      the first time now he noticed the peculiar perturbation of
      the usually placid German couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about your daughter?" he asked, catching a word as to
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both old people raised their voices at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She haf gone. She haf run avay. Ach, himmel, ve must for
      her loog. Quick--she could not get in. Ve had der door
      shut."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Locked her out, eh?" inquired Maguire after a time,
      hearing much of the rest of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," explained Rogaum. "It was to schkare her a liddle.
      She vould not come ven I called."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, that's the girl we saw walkin' with young Almerting,
      do ye mind? The one in the white dress," said Delahanty to
      Maguire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "White dress, yah!" echoed Rogaum, and then the fact of her
      walking with some one came home like a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you hear dot?" he exclaimed even as Mrs. Rogaum did
      likewise. <i>"Mein Gott, hast du das gehoert?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He fairly jumped as he said it. His hands flew up to his
      stout and ruddy head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whaddy ya want to let her out for nights?" asked Maguire
      roughly, catching the drift of the situation. "That's no
      time for young girls to be out, anyhow, and with these
      toughs around here. Sure, I saw her, nearly two hours ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach," groaned Rogaum. "Two hours yet. Ho, ho, ho!" His
      voice was quite hysteric.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go on in," said Officer Delahanty. "There's no use
      yellin' out here. Give us a description of her an' we'll
      send out an alarm. You won't be able to find her walkin'
      around."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her parents described her exactly. The two men turned to
      the nearest police box and then disappeared, leaving the
      old German couple in the throes of distress. A time-worn
      old church-clock nearby now chimed out one and then two.
      The notes cut like knives. Mrs. Rogaum began fearfully to
      cry. Rogaum walked and blustered to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a queer case, that," said Officer Delahanty to
      Maguire after having reported the matter of Theresa, but
      referring solely to the outcast of the doorway so recently
      sent away and in whose fate they were much more interested.
      She being a part of the commercialized vice of the city,
      they were curious as to the cause of her suicide. "I think
      I know that woman. I think I know where she came from. You
      do, too--Adele's, around the corner, eh? She didn't come
      into that doorway by herself, either. She was put there.
      You know how they do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right," said Maguire. "She was put there, all
      right, and that's just where she come from, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two of them now tipped up their noses and cocked their
      eyes significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go around," added Maguire.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went, the significant red light over the transom at 68
      telling its own story. Strolling leisurely up, they
      knocked. At the very first sound a painted denizen of the
      half-world opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Adele?" asked Maguire as the two, hats on as
      usual, stepped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's gone to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell her to come down."
    </p>
    <p>
      They seated themselves deliberately in the gaudy mirrored
      parlor and waited, conversing between themselves in
      whispers. Presently a sleepy-looking woman of forty in a
      gaudy robe of heavy texture, and slippered in red,
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're here about that suicide case you had tonight. What
      about it? Who was she? How'd she come to be in that doorway
      around the corner? Come, now," Maguire added, as the madam
      assumed an air of mingled injured and ignorant innocence,
      "you know. Can that stuff! How did she come to take
      poison?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what you're talking about," said the woman
      with the utmost air of innocence. "I never heard of any
      suicide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, come now ," insisted Delahanty, "the girl around the
      corner. You know. We know you've got a pull, but we've got
      to know about this case, just the same. Come across now. It
      won't be published. What made her take the poison?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the steady eyes of the officers the woman hesitated,
      but finally weakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why--why--her lover went back on her--that's all. She got
      so blue we just couldn't do anything with her. I tried to,
      but she wouldn't listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lover, eh?" put in Maguire as though that were the most
      unheard-of thing in the world. "What was his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. You never can tell that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was her name--Annie?" asked Delahanty wisely, as
      though he knew but was merely inquiring for form's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--Emily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, how did she come to get over there, anyhow?"
      inquired Maguire most pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "George took her," she replied, referring to a
      man-of-all-work about the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then little by little as they sat there the whole miserable
      story came out, miserable as all the wilfulness and error
      and suffering of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How old was she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, twenty-one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, where'd she come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, here in New York. Her family locked her out one night,
      I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the way the woman said this last brought old
      Rogaum and his daughter back to the policemen's minds. They
      had forgotten all about her by now, although they had
      turned in an alarm. Fearing to interfere too much with this
      well-known and politically controlled institution, the two
      men left, but outside they fell to talking of the other
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We ought to tell old Rogaum about her some time," said
      Maguire to Delahanty cynically. "He locked his kid out
      to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it might be a good thing for him to hear that,"
      replied the other. "We'd better go round there an' see if
      his girl's back yet. She may be back by now," and so they
      returned but little disturbed by the joint miseries.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Rogaum's door they once more knocked loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your daughter back again?" asked Maguire when a reply
      was had.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach, no," replied the hysterical Mrs. Rogaum, who was
      quite alone now. "My husband he haf gone oudt again to loog
      vunce more. Oh, my! Oh, my!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's what you get for lockin' her out," returned
      Maguire loftily, the other story fresh in his mind. "That
      other girl downstairs here tonight was locked out too,
      once." He chanced to have a girl-child of his own and
      somehow he was in the mood for pointing a moral. "You
      oughtn't to do anything like that. Where d'yuh expect she's
      goin' to if you lock her out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rogaum groaned. She explained that it was not her
      fault, but anyhow it was carrying coals to Newcastle to
      talk to her so. The advice was better for her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair finally returned to the station to see if the call
      had been attended to.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure," said the sergeant, "certainly. Whaddy ya think?"
      and he read from the blotter before him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Look out for girl, Theresa Rogaum. Aged 18; height, about
      5, 3; light hair, blue eyes, white cotton dress, trimmed
      with blue ribbon. Last seen with lad named Almerting, about
      19 years of age, about 5, 9; weight 135 pounds.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other details even more pointed and conclusive.
      For over an hour now, supposedly, policemen from the
      Battery to Harlem, and far beyond, had been scanning long
      streets and dim shadows for a girl in a white dress with a
      youth of nineteen,--supposedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Officer Halsey, another of this region, which took in a
      portion of Washington Square, had seen a good many couples
      this pleasant summer evening since the description of
      Theresa and Almerting had been read to him over the
      telephone, but none that answered to these. Like Maguire
      and Delahanty, he was more or less indifferent to all such
      cases, but idling on a corner near the park at about three
      a.m., a brother officer, one Paisly by name, came up and
      casually mentioned the missing pair also.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bet I saw that couple, not over an hour ago. She was
      dressed in white, and looked to me as if she didn't want to
      be out. I didn't happen to think at the time, but now I
      remember. They acted sort o' funny. She did, anyhow. They
      went in this park down at the Fourth Street end there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing we beat it, then," suggested Halsey, weary for
      something to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure," said the other quickly, and together they began a
      careful search, kicking around in the moonlight under the
      trees. The moon was leaning moderately toward the west, and
      all the branches were silvered with light and dew. Among
      the flowers, past clumps of bushes, near the fountain, they
      searched, each one going his way alone. At last, the
      wandering Halsey paused beside a thick clump of flaming
      bushes, ruddy, slightly, even in the light. A murmur of
      voices greeted him, and something very much like the sound
      of a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" he said mentally, drawing near and
      listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you come on now?" said the first of the voices
      heard. "They won't let you in any more. You're with me,
      ain't you? What's the use cryin'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer to this, but no sobs. She must have been crying
      silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on. I can take care of yuh. We can live in Hoboken. I
      know a place where we can go to-night. That's all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a movement as if the speaker were patting her on
      the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the use cryin'? Don't you believe I love yuh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer who had stolen quietly around to get a better
      view now came closer. He wanted to see for himself. In the
      moonlight, from a comfortable distance, he could see them
      seated. The tall bushes were almost all about the bench. In
      the arms of the youth was the girl in white, held very
      close. Leaning over to get a better view, he saw him kiss
      her and hold her--hold her in such a way that she could but
      yield to him, whatever her slight disinclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a common affair at earlier hours, but rather
      interesting now. The officer was interested. He crept
      nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you two doin' here?" he suddenly inquired, rising
      before them, as though he had not seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl tumbled out of her compromising position,
      speechless and blushing violently. The young man stood up,
      nervous, but still defiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, we were just sittin' here," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes? Well, say, what's your name? I think we're lookin'
      for you two, anyhow. Almerting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's me," said the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yours?" he added, addressing Theresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Theresa Rogaum," replied the latter brokenly, beginning to
      cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you two'll have to come along with me," he added
      laconically. "The Captain wants to see both of you," and he
      marched them solemnly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" young Almerting ventured to inquire after a
      time, blanched with fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind," replied the policeman irritably. "Come along,
      you'll find out at the station house. We want you both.
      That's enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the other end of the park Paisly joined them, and, at
      the station-house, the girl was given a chair. She was all
      tears and melancholy with a modicum possibly of relief at
      being thus rescued from the world. Her companion, for all
      his youth, was defiant if circumspect, a natural animal
      defeated of its aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better go for her father," commented the sergeant, and by
      four in the morning old Rogaum, who had still been up and
      walking the floor, was rushing station-ward. From an
      earlier rage he had passed to an almost killing grief, but
      now at the thought that he might possibly see his daughter
      alive and well once more he was overflowing with a mingled
      emotion which contained rage, fear, sorrow, and a number of
      other things. What should he do to her if she were alive?
      Beat her? Kiss her? Or what? Arrived at the station,
      however, and seeing his fair Theresa in the hands of the
      police, and this young stranger lingering near, also
      detained, he was beside himself with fear, rage, affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You! You!" he exclaimed at once, glaring at the
      imperturbable Almerting, when told that this was the young
      man who was found with his girl. Then, seized with a sudden
      horror, he added, turning to Theresa, "Vot haf you done?
      Oh, oh! You! You!" he repeated again to Almerting angrily,
      now that he felt that his daughter was safe. "Come not near
      my tochter any more! I vill preak your effery pone, du
      teufel, du!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a move toward the incarcerated lover, but here the
      sergeant interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop that, now," he said calmly. "Take your daughter out
      of here and go home, or I'll lock you both up. We don't
      want any fighting in here. D'ye hear? Keep your daughter
      off the streets hereafter, then she won't get into trouble.
      Don't let her run around with such young toughs as this."
      Almerting winced. "Then there won't anything happen to her.
      We'll do whatever punishing's to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, what's eatin' him!" commented Almerting dourly, now
      that he felt himself reasonably safe from a personal
      encounter. "What have I done? He locked her out, didn't he?
      I was just keepin' her company till morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we know all about that," said the sergeant, "and
      about you, too. You shut up, or you'll go downtown to
      Special Sessions. I want no guff out o' you." Still he
      ordered the butcher angrily to be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Rogaum heard nothing. He had his daughter. He was
      taking her home. She was not dead--not even morally injured
      in so far as he could learn. He was a compound of wondrous
      feelings. What to do was beyond him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner near the butcher shop they encountered the
      wakeful Maguire, still idling, as they passed. He was
      pleased to see that Rogaum had his Theresa once more. It
      raised him to a high, moralizing height.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't lock her out any more," he called significantly.
      "That's what brought the other girl to your door, you
      know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vot iss dot?" said Rogaum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say the other girl was locked out. That's why she
      committed suicide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ach, I know," said the husky German under his breath, but
      he had no intention of locking her out. He did not know
      what he would do until they were in the presence of his
      crying wife, who fell upon Theresa, weeping. Then he
      decided to be reasonably lenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She vass like you," said the old mother to the wandering
      Theresa, ignorant of the seeming lesson brought to their
      very door. "She vass loog like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I vill not vip you now," said the old butcher solemnly,
      too delighted to think of punishment after having feared
      every horror under the sun, "aber, go not oudt any more.
      Keep off de streads so late. I von't haf it. Dot loafer,
      aber--let him yussed come here some more! I fix him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said the fat mother tearfully, smoothing her
      daughter's hair. "She vouldn't run avay no more yet, no,
      no." Old Mrs. Rogaum was all mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you wouldn't let me in," insisted Theresa, "and I
      didn't have any place to go. What do you want me to do? I'm
      not going to stay in the house all the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fix him!" roared Rogaum, unloading all his rage now on
      the recreant lover freely. "Yussed let him come some more!
      Der penitentiary he should haf!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he's not so bad," Theresa told her mother, almost a
      heroine now that she was home and safe. "He's Mr.
      Almerting, the stationer's boy. They live here in the next
      block."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you ever bother that girl again," the sergeant was
      saying to young Almerting as he turned him loose an hour
      later. "If you do, we'll get you, and you won't get off
      under six months. Y' hear me, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, I don't want 'er," replied the boy truculently and
      cynically. "Let him have his old daughter. What'd he want
      to lock 'er out for? They'd better not lock 'er out again
      though, that's all I say. I don't want 'er."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beat it!" replied the sergeant, and away he went.

    <p>
      It was a sweltering noon in July. Gregory, after several
      months of meditation on the warning given him by his
      political friend, during which time nothing to substantiate
      it had occurred, was making ready to return to the seaside
      hotel to which his present prosperity entitled him. It was
      a great affair, the Triton, about sixty minutes from his
      office, facing the sea and amid the pines and sands of the
      Island. His wife, 'the girl,' as he conventionally referred
      to her, had been compelled, in spite of the plot which had
      been revealed or suggested, owing to the ailing state of
      their child, to go up to the mountains to her mother for
      advice and comfort. Owing to the imminence of the fall
      campaign, however, he could not possibly leave. Weekdays
      and Sundays, and occasionally nights, he was busy ferreting
      out and substantiating one fact and another in regard to
      the mismanagement of the city, which was to be used as
      ammunition a little later on. The mayor and his "ring," as
      it was called, was to be ousted at all costs. He, Gregory,
      was certain to be rewarded if that came to pass. In spite
      of that he was eminently sincere as to the value and even
      the necessity of what he was doing. The city was being
      grossly mismanaged. What greater labor than to worm out the
      details and expose them to the gaze of an abused and
      irritated citizenship?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the enemy itself was not helpless. A gentleman in the
      publishing business of whom he had never even heard called
      to offer him a position in the Middle West which would take
      him out of the city for four or five years at the least,
      and pay him six or seven thousand dollars a year. On his
      failure to be interested some of his mail began to
      disappear, and it seemed to him as though divers strange
      characters were taking a peculiar and undue interest in his
      movements. Lastly, one of the politicians connected with
      his own party called to see him at his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Gregory, it's this way," he said after a short
      preamble, "you have got a line as to what's going on in
      connection with that South Penyank land transfer. The mayor
      is in on that, but he is absolutely determined that the
      public is not going to find it out, and so is his partner,
      Tilney--not until after the election, anyhow. They are
      prepared to use some pretty rough methods, so look out for
      yourself. You're fond of your wife, are you? Well, keep her
      close beside you, and the kid. Don't let them get you away
      from her, even for a moment, where you shouldn't be. You
      saw what happened to Crothers two or three years ago,
      didn't you? He was about to expose that Yellow Point Ferry
      deal, but of course no one knew anything about that--and
      then, zip!--all at once he was arrested on an old charge of
      desertion, an old debt that he had failed to pay was
      produced and his furniture seized, and his wife was induced
      to leave him. Don't let them catch you in the same way. If
      you have any debts bring them to us and let us see what we
      can do about them. And if you are interested in any other
      woman, break it off, send her away, get rid of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory viewed him with an irritated, half-pitying smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There isn't any other woman," he said simply. Think of his
      being faithless to "the girl" and the kid--the blue-eyed,
      pink-toed kid!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't think I'm trying to pry into your affairs," went on
      the politician. "I'm just telling you. If you need any
      further advice or help, come to me. But whatever you do,
      look out for yourself," and with that he put on his high
      silk hat and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory stood in the center of his office after his visitor
      had gone, and gazed intently at the floor. Certainly, from
      what he had discovered so far, he could readily believe
      that the mayor would do just what his friend had said. And
      as for the mayor's friend, the real estate plunger, it was
      plain from his whispered history that no tricks or
      brutalities were beneath him. Another politician had once
      said in describing him that he would not stop short of
      murder, but that one would never catch him red-handed or in
      any other way, and certainly that appeared to be true. He
      was wealthier, more powerful, than he had ever been, much
      more so than the mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since he and his wife had come to this seaside hotel
      several things had occurred which caused him to think that
      something might happen, although there was no evidence as
      yet that his suspicions were well-founded. An unctuous,
      over-dressed, bejeweled, semi-sporty widow of forty had
      arrived, a business woman, she indicated herself to be,
      conducting a highly successful theatrical agency in the
      great city, and consequently weltering in what one of
      Gregory's friends was wont to describe as "the sinews of
      war." She abounded in brown and wine-colored silks, brown
      slippers and stockings, a wealth of suspiciously lustrous
      auburn hair. Her car, for she had one, was of respectable
      reputation. Her skill and willingness to risk at whist of
      good report. She was, in the parlance of the hotel clerks
      and idlers of the Triton veranda, a cheerful and liberal
      spender. Even while Mrs. Gregory was at Triton Hall, Mrs.
      Skelton had arrived, making herself comfortable in two
      rooms and bath on the sea front, and finding familiar
      friends in the manager and several stalwart idlers who
      appeared to be brokers and real estate dealers, and who
      took a respectable interest in golf, tennis, and the Triton
      Grill. She was unctuous, hearty, optimistic, and neither
      Gregory nor his wife could help liking her a little. But
      before leaving, his wife had casually wondered whether Mrs.
      Skelton would be one to engage in such a plot. Her
      friendliness, while possible of any interpretation, was
      still general enough to be free of suspicion. She might be
      looking for just such a situation as this, though--to find
      Gregory alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do be careful, dear," his wife cautioned. "If you become
      too doubtful, leave and go to another place. At least that
      will compel them to provide another set of people." And off
      she went, fairly serene in her faith in her husband's
      ability to manage the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, much against his will, at first, Gregory found
      himself alone. He began to wonder if he should leave, or
      weather it out, as he expressed it to himself. Why should
      he be driven from the one comfortable hotel on this nearest
      beach, and that when he most needed it, away from a region
      where he was regularly encountering most of his political
      friends, particularly at week-ends? For so near a place it
      had many advantages: a delightful golf course, several
      tennis courts, food and rooms reasonably well above
      complaint, and a refreshing and delightful view of the sea
      over a broad lawn. Besides it was absolutely necessary for
      him to be in the near-by city the greater portion of every
      single working day. His peculiar and pressing investigation
      demanded it and a comfortable place to rest and recuperate
      at night was also imperative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's beautiful here," he said to himself finally, "and
      here is where I stick. I haven't a car, and where is there
      any other place as convenient? Besides, if they're going to
      follow me, they're going to follow me."
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence, he traveled meditatively back and forth
      between this place and the city, thinking of what might
      happen. Becoming a little doubtful, he decided to call on
      Frank Blount and talk it over with him. Blount was an old
      newspaper man who had first turned lawyer and then broker.
      Seemingly clientless the major portion of the time, he
      still prospered mightily. A lorn bachelor, he had three
      clubs, several hotels, and a dozen country homes to visit,
      to say nothing of a high power car. Just now he was held
      unduly close to his work, and so was frequenting this
      coast. He liked golf and tennis, and, incidentally,
      Gregory, whom he wished to see prosper though he could not
      quite direct him in the proper way. Reaching the city one
      morning, Gregory betook him to Blount's office, and there
      laid the whole case before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, that's the way it is," he concluded, staring at the
      pink cheeks and partially bald head of his friend, "and I
      would like to know what you would do if you were in my
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Blount gazed thoughtfully out through the high towers of
      the city to the blue sky beyond, while he drummed with his
      fingers on the glass top of his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he replied, after a time, scratching his cheekbone
      thoughtfully, "I'd stick it out if I were you. If there is
      to be a woman, and she is attractive, you might have some
      fun out of it without getting yourself in any trouble. It
      looks like a sporty summer proposition to me. Of course,
      you'll have to be on your guard. I'd take out a permit to
      carry a revolver if I were you. They'll hear of it if
      they're up to anything, and it won't cheer them any. In the
      next place, you ought to make out a day-to-day statement of
      your exact movements, and swear to it before a notary. If
      they hear of that it won't cheer them any either, and it
      may make them try to think up something really original.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," he went on, "I haven't so very much to do
      evenings and week-ends, and if you want me to I'll just be
      around most of the time in case of trouble. If we're
      together they can't turn much of anything without one of us
      knowing something about it, and then, too, you'll have an
      eye-witness." He was wondering whether the lady might not
      be interesting to him also. "I'm over at Sunset Point, just
      beyond you there, and if you want me I'll come over every
      evening and see how you're making out. If any trick is
      turned, I'd like to see how it is done," and he smiled in a
      winsome, helpful manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just the thing," echoed Gregory thoughtfully. "I
      don't want any trick turned. I can't afford it. If anything
      should happen to me just now I'd never get on my feet again
      politically, and then there's the wife and kid, and I'm
      sick of the newspaper business," and he stared out of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, don't be worrying about it," Blount insisted
      soothingly. "Just be on your guard, and if you have to stay
      in town late any night, let me know and I'll come and pick
      you up. Or, if I can't do that, stay in town yourself. Go
      to one of the big hotels, where you'll feel thoroughly
      safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      For several days Gregory, to avoid being a nuisance,
      returned to the hotel early. Also he secured a permit, and
      weighted his hip pocket with an unwieldy weapon which he
      resented, but which he nevertheless kept under his pillow
      at night. His uncertainty worked on his imagination to such
      an extent that he began to note suspicious moves on the
      part of nearly everybody. Any new character about the hotel
      annoyed him. He felt certain that there was a group of
      people connected with Mrs. Skelton who were watching him,
      though he could not prove it, even to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is ridiculous," he finally told himself. "I'm acting
      like a five-year-old in the dark. Who's going to hurt me?"
      And he wrote laughing letters to his wife about it, and
      tried to resume his old-time nonchalance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't quite possible, however, for not long after that
      something happened which disturbed him greatly. At least he
      persuaded himself to that effect, for that was a
      characteristic of these incidents--their openness to
      another interpretation than the one he might fix on. In
      spite of Blount's advice, one night about nine he decided
      to return to Triton Hall, and that without calling his
      friend to his aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the use?" he asked himself. "He'll be thinking I'm
      the biggest coward ever, and after all, nothing has
      happened yet, and I doubt whether they'd go that far,
      anyhow." He consoled himself with the idea that perhaps
      humanity was better than he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just the same, as he left the train at Triton and saw
      it glimmering away over the meadows eastward, he felt a
      little uncertain as to his wisdom in this matter. Triton
      Station was a lonely one at nearly all times save in the
      morning and around seven at night, and to-night it seemed
      especially so. Only he alighted from the train. Most people
      went to and fro in their cars by another road. Why should
      he not have done as Blount had suggested, he now asked
      himself as he surveyed the flat country about;--called him
      to his aid, or stayed in the city? After all, hiring a car
      would not have been much better either, as Blount had
      pointed out, giving a possible lurking enemy a much sought
      point of attack. No, he should have stayed in town or
      returned with Blount in his car, and telling himself this,
      he struck out along the lonely, albeit short, stretch of
      road which led to the hotel and which was lighted by only a
      half dozen small incandescent globes strung at a
      considerable distance apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      En route, and as he was saying to himself that it was a
      blessed thing that it was only a few hundred yards and that
      he was well-armed and fairly well constructed physically
      for a contest, a car swerved about a bend in the road a
      short distance ahead and stopped. Two men got out and, in
      the shadow back of the lights, which were less flaring than
      was usual, began to examine a wheel. It seemed odd to him
      on the instant that its headlights were so dim. Why should
      they be so dim at this time of night and why should this
      strange car stop just here at this lonely bend just as he
      was approaching it? Also why should he feel so queer about
      it or them, for at once his flesh began to creep and his
      hair to tingle. As he neared the car he moved to give it as
      wide a berth as the road would permit. But now one of the
      men left the wheel and approached him. Instantly, with
      almost an involuntary urge, he brought the revolver out of
      his hip pocket and stuffed it in his coat pocket. At the
      same time he stopped and called to the stranger:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay right where you are, Mister. I'm armed, and I don't
      want you to come near me. If you do I'll shoot. I don't
      know who you are, or whether you're a friend or not, but I
      don't want you to move. Now, if there's anything you want,
      ask it from where you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger stopped where he stood, seemingly surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was going to ask you for a match," he said, "and the way
      to Trager's Point."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I haven't a match," returned Gregory savagely, "and
      Trager's Point is out that way. There's the hotel...if
      you're coming from there, why didn't you ask for directions
      there, and for matches, too?" He paused, while the man in
      the shadow seemed to examine him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, all right," he returned indifferently. "I don't want
      anything you don't want to give," but instead of returning
      to the car, he stood where he was, following Gregory with
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory's skin seemed to rise on the back of his neck like
      the fur of a cat. He fairly tingled as he drew his revolver
      from his pocket and waved it ominously before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, I'm going to walk around you two," he called, "and I
      want you to stand right where you are. I have you covered,
      and at the first move I'll shoot. You won't have any
      trouble out of me if you're not looking for it, but don't
      move," and he began orienting his own position so as to
      keep them directly in range of his eyes and weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't move!" he kept calling until he was well up the
      road, and then suddenly, while the men, possibly in
      astonishment, were still looking at him, turned and ran as
      fast as he could, reaching the hotel steps breathless and
      wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the last lone trip for me," he said solemnly to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he spoke to Blount about it the latter seemed inclined
      to pooh-pooh his fears. Why should any one want to choose
      any such open place to kill or waylay another? There might
      have been other passengers on the train. A stray auto might
      be coming along there at any time. The men might have
      wanted a match, and not have been coming from the hotel at
      all. There was another road there which did not turn in at
      the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Gregory was inclined to believe that harm had been
      intended him--he could scarcely say why to himself--just
      plain intuition, he contended.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then a day or two later--all the more significant now
      because of this other incident--Mrs. Skelton seemed to
      become more and more thoughtful as to his comfort and
      well-being. She took her meals at one of the tables
      commanding a view of the sea, and with (most frequently)
      one or the other, or both, broker friends as companions, to
      say nothing of occasional outside friends. But usually
      there was a fourth empty chair, and Gregory was soon
      invited to occupy that, and whenever Blount was present, a
      fifth was added. At first he hesitated, but urged on by
      Blount, who was amused by her, he accepted. Blount insisted
      that she was a comic character. She was so dressy, sporty,
      unctuous, good-natured--the very best kind of a seaside
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, man, she's interesting," the latter insisted one
      night as they were taking a ride after dinner. "Quite a
      sporty 'fair and forty,' that. I like her. I really do.
      She's probably a crook, but she plays bridge well, and
      she's good at golf. Does she try to get anything out of
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a thing, that I can see," replied Gregory. "She seems
      to be simple enough. She's only been here about three
      weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we'd better see what we can find out about her. I
      have a hunch that she's in on this, but I can't be sure. It
      looks as though she might be one of Tilney's stool pigeons.
      But let's play the game and see how it comes out. I'll be
      nice to her for your sake, and you do the same for mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the warming influence of this companionship, things
      seemed to develop fairly rapidly. It was only a day or two
      later, and after Gregory had seated himself at Mrs.
      Skelton's table, that she announced with a great air of
      secrecy and as though it were hidden and rather important
      information, that a friend of hers, a very clever Western
      girl of some position and money, one Imogene Carle of
      Cincinnati, no less, a daughter of the very wealthy Brayton
      Carle's of that city, was coming to this place to stay for
      a little while. Mrs. Skelton, it appeared, had known her
      parents in that city fifteen years before. Imogene was her
      owny ownest pet. She was now visiting the Wilson Fletchers
      at Gray's Cove, on the Sound, but Mrs. Skelton had
      prevailed upon her parents to let her visit her here for a
      while. She was only twenty, and from now on she, Mrs.
      Skelton, was to be a really, truly chaperone. Didn't they
      sympathize with her? And if they were all very nice--and
      with this a sweeping glance included them all--they might
      help entertain her. Wouldn't that be fine? She was a
      darling of a girl, clever, magnetic, a good dancer, a
      pianist--in short, various and sundry things almost too
      good to be true. But, above all other things, she was
      really very beautiful, with a wealth of brown hair, brown
      eyes, a perfect skin, and the like. Neither Blount nor
      Gregory offered the other a single look during this
      recital, but later on, meeting on the great veranda which
      faced the sea, Blount said to him, "Well, what do you
      think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I suppose it's the one. Well, she tells it well. It's
      interesting to think that she is to be so perfect, isn't
      it?" he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later the fair visitor put in an appearance, and
      she was all that Mrs. Skelton had promised, and more. She
      was beautiful. Gregory saw her for the first time as he
      entered the large dining room at seven. She was, as Mrs.
      Skelton had described her, young, certainly not more than
      twenty-one at most. Her eyes were a light gray-brown, and
      her hair and skin and hands were full of light. She seemed
      simple and unpretentious, laughing, gay, not altogether
      fine or perfect, but fairly intelligent, and good to look
      at--very. She was at Mrs. Skelton's table, the brokers
      paying her marked attention, and, at sight, Blount liked
      her, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say," he began, "some beauty, eh? I'll have to save you
      from yourself, I fancy. I'll tell you how we'll work it.
      You save me, and I'll save you. The old lady certainly
      knows how to select 'em, apparently, and so does Tilney.
      Well now, my boy, look out!" and he approached with the air
      of one who was anxious to be a poor stricken victim
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory had to laugh. However much he might be on his
      guard, he was interested, and as if to heighten this she
      paid more attention to Mrs. Skelton and her two friends
      than she did to Gregory or Blount. She was, or pretended to
      be absolutely sincere, and ignorant of her possible role as
      a siren, and they in turn pretended to accept her at her
      own valuation, only Blount announced after dinner very
      gaily that she might siren him all she blanked pleased. He
      was ready. By degrees, however, even during this first and
      second evening, Gregory began to feel that he was the one.
      He caught her looking at him slyly or shyly, or both, and
      he insisted to himself stubbornly and even vainly enough
      that he was her intended victim. When he suggested as much
      to Blount the other merely laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be so vain," he said. "You may not be. I wish I were
      in your place. I'll see if I can't help take her attention
      from you," and he paid as much attention to her as any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Gregory's mind was not to be disabused. He watched
      her narrowly, while she on her part chattered gaily of many
      things--her life the winter before in Cincinnati, the
      bathing at Beachampton where she had recently been, a
      yachting trip she had been promised, tennis, golf. She was
      an expert at tennis, as she later proved, putting Gregory
      in a heavy perspiration whenever he played with her, and
      keeping him on the jump. He tried to decide for himself at
      this time whether she was making any advances, but could
      not detect any. She was very equitable in the distribution
      of her favors, and whenever the dancing began in the East
      room took as her first choice one of the brokers, and then
      Blount.
    </p>
    <p>
      The former, as did Mrs. Skelton and the brokers, had
      machines, and by her and them, in spite of the almost
      ever-present Blount, Gregory was invited to be one of a
      party in one or the other of their cars whenever they were
      going anywhere of an afternoon or evening. He was
      suspicious of them, however, and refused their invitations
      except when Blount was on the scene and invited, when he
      was willing enough to accept. Then there were whist,
      pinochle, or poker games in the hotel occasionally, and in
      these Gregory as well as Blount, when he was there, were
      wont to join, being persistently invited. Gregory did not
      dance, and Imogene ragged him as to this. Why didn't he
      learn? It was wonderful! She would teach him! As she passed
      amid the maze of dancers at times he could not help
      thinking how graceful she was, how full of life and animal
      spirits. Blount saw this and teased him, at the same time
      finding her very companionable and interesting himself.
      Gregory could not help thinking what a fascinating, what an
      amazing thing, really, it was (providing it were true) that
      so dark a personality as Tilney could secure such an
      attractive girl to do his vile work. Think of it, only
      twenty-one, beautiful, able to further herself in many ways
      no doubt, and yet here she was under suspicion of him, a
      trickster possibly. What could be the compulsion, the
      reward?
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy, you don't know these people," Blount was always
      telling him. "They're the limit. In politics you can get
      people to do anything--anything. It isn't like the rest of
      life or business, it's just politics, that's all. It seems
      a cynical thing to say, but it's true. Look at your own
      investigations! What do they show?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, but a girl like that now--" replied Gregory
      solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after all, as he insisted to Blount, they did not
      <i>know</i> that there was anything to all this. She might
      and she might not be a siren. It might be possible that
      both of them were grossly misjudging her and other
      absolutely innocent people.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, all that they had been able to find out concerning
      Mrs. Skelton was that she was, as she represented herself
      to be, the successful owner and manager of a theatrical
      agency. She might have known the better days and
      connections which she boasted. Gregory felt at times as
      though his brain were whirling, like a man confronted by
      enemies in the dark, fumbling and uncertain, but he and
      Blount both agreed that the best thing was to stay here and
      see it through, come what might. It was a good game even as
      it stood, interesting, very. It showed, as Blount pointed
      out to him, a depth to this political mess which he was
      attempting to expose which previously even he had not
      suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stick by," the other insisted sport-lovingly. "You don't
      know what may come of this. It may provide you the very
      club you're looking for. Win her over to your side if you
      can. Why not? She might really fall for you. Then see what
      comes of it. You can't be led into any especial trap with
      your eyes open."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory agreed to all this after a time. Besides, this very
      attractive girl was beginning to appeal to him in a very
      subtle way. He had never known a woman like this
      before--never even seen one. It was a very new and
      attractive game, of sorts. He began to spruce up and
      attempt to appear a little gallant himself. A daily report
      of his movements was being filed each morning, though.
      Every night he returned with Blount in his car, or on an
      early train. There was scarcely a chance for a compromising
      situation, and still there might be--who knows?
    </p>
    <p>
      On other evenings, after the fashion of seaside hotel life,
      Gregory and Imogene grew a little more familiar. Gregory
      learned that she played and sang, and, listening to her,
      that she was of a warm and even sensuous disposition. She
      was much more sophisticated than she had seemed at first,
      as he could now see, fixing her lips in an odd inviting
      pout at times and looking alluringly at one and another,
      himself included. Both Blount and himself, once the novelty
      of the supposed secret attack had worn off, ventured to
      jest with her about it, or rather to hint vaguely as to her
      mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, how goes the great game to-night?" Blount once asked
      her during her second or third week, coming up to where she
      and Gregory were sitting amid the throng on the general
      veranda, and eyeing her in a sophisticated or smilingly
      cynical way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What game?" She looked up in seemingly complete innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, snaring the appointed victim. Isn't that what all
      attractive young women do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you referring to me?" she inquired with considerable
      hauteur and an air of injured innocence. "I'd have you know
      that I don't have to snare any one, and particularly not a
      married man." Her teeth gleamed maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Gregory and Blount were watching her closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course not. Not a married man, to be sure. And I
      wasn't referring to you exactly--just life, you know, the
      game."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know," she replied sweetly. "I'm jesting, too."
      Both Gregory and Blount laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she got away with it without the tremor of an
      eyelash, didn't she?" Blount afterward observed, and
      Gregory had to agree that she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, it was Gregory who attempted a reference of this
      kind. She had come out after a short instrumental
      interpretation at the piano, where, it seemed to him, she
      had been posing in a graceful statuesque way--for whose
      benefit? He knew that she knew he could see her from where
      he sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's pretty hard work, without much reward," he suggested
      seemingly idly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is? I don't quite understand," and she looked at him
      questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No?" he smiled in a light laughing manner. "Well, that's a
      cryptic way I have. I say things like that. Just a light
      hint at a dark plot, possibly. You mustn't mind me. You
      wouldn't understand unless you know what I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is it you know, then, that I don't?" she
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing definite yet. Just an idea. Don't mind me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, you are very odd, both you and Mr. Blount. You are
      always saying such odd things and then adding that you
      don't mean anything. And what's cryptic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory, still laughing at her, explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, you're exceedingly interesting to me as a
      type. I'm watching you all the while."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" she commented, with a lifting of the eyebrows and a
      slight distention of the eyes. "That's interesting. Have
      you made up your mind as to what type I am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not quite yet. But if you're the type I think you are,
      you're very clever. I'll have to hand you the palm on that
      score."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, you puzzle me," she said seriously. "Truly, you
      do. I don't understand you at all. What is it you are
      talking about? If it's anything that has any sense in it I
      wish you'd say it out plain, and if not I wish you wouldn't
      say it at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory stared. There was an odd ring of defiance in her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't be angry, will you?" he said, slightly
      disconcerted. "I'm just teasing, not talking sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      She arose and walked off, while he strolled up and down the
      veranda looking for Blount. When he found him, he narrated
      his experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's just possible that we are mistaken. You never
      can tell. Give her a little more rope. Something's sure to
      develop soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      And thereafter it seemed as if Mrs. Skelton and some others
      might be helping her in some subtle way about something,
      the end or aim of which he could not be quite sure. He was
      in no way disposed to flatter himself, and yet it seemed at
      times as if he were the object of almost invisible
      machinations. In spite of what had gone before, she still
      addressed him in a friendly way, and seemed not to wish to
      avoid him, but rather to be in his vicinity at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smug, dressy, crafty Jew of almost minute dimensions
      arrived on the scene and took quarters somewhere in the
      building, coming and going and seeming never to know Mrs.
      Skelton or her friends, and yet one day, idling across some
      sand dunes which skirted an adjacent inlet, he saw them,
      Imogene and the antlike Jew, walking along together. He was
      so astounded that he stopped in amazement. His first
      thought was to draw a little nearer and to make very sure,
      but realizing, as they walked slowly in his direction, that
      he could not be mistaken, he beat a hasty retreat. That
      evening Blount was taken in on the mystery, and at dinner
      time, seeing the Hebrew enter and seat himself in state at
      a distant table, he asked casually, "A newcomer, isn't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Skelton, Imogene, and the one broker present, surveyed
      the stranger with curious but unacquainted indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't the slightest idea," answered the broker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never saw him before. Cloaks and suits, I'll lay a
      thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looks as though he might be rich, whoever he is,"
      innocently commented Imogene.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he came Thursday. He doesn't seem to be any one in
      particular, that's sure," added Mrs. Skelton distantly, and
      the subject was dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory was tempted to accuse the young woman and her
      friends then and there of falsehood, but he decided to wait
      and study her. This was certainly becoming interesting. If
      they could lie like that, then something was surely in the
      air. So she was a trickster, after all, and she was so
      charming. His interest in her and Mrs. Skelton and their
      friends grew apace.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came the matter of the mysterious blue racer, or
      "trailer," as Gregory afterward came to call it, a great
      hulking brute of a car, beautifully, even showily, made,
      and with an engine that talked like no other. There was a
      metallic ring about it which seemed to carry a long way
      through the clear air and over the sands which adjoined the
      sea. It was the possession, so he learned later through
      Mrs. Skelton, of one of four fortunate youths who were
      summering at the next hotel west, about a mile away. The
      owner, one Castleman by name, the son and heir to a very
      wealthy family, was a friend of hers whom she had first met
      in a commercial way in the city. They came over after
      Imogene's arrival, she explained, to help entertain, and
      they invariably came in this car. Castleman and his
      friends, smart, showy youths all, played tennis and bridge,
      and knew all the latest shows and dances and drinks. They
      were very gay looking, at least three of them, and were
      inclined to make much of Imogene, though, as Mrs. Skelton
      cautiously confided to Gregory after a time, she did not
      propose to allow it. Imogene's parents might not like it.
      On the other hand, Gregory and Blount, being sober men both
      and of excellent discretion, were much more welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost every day thereafter Mrs. Skelton would go for a
      ride in her own car or that of Castleman, taking Gregory if
      he would, and Imogene for companions. Blount, however, as
      he explicitly made clear at the very beginning, was opposed
      to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't ever be alone with her, I tell you, or just in the
      company of her and her friends anywhere except on this
      veranda. They're after you, and they're not finding it
      easy, and they're beginning to work hard. They'll give
      themselves away in some way pretty soon, just as sure as
      you're sitting there. They want to cut me out, but don't
      let them do it--or if you do, get some one in my place. You
      don't know where they'll take you. That's the way people
      are framed. Take me, or get them to use my machine and you
      take some other man. Then you can regulate the conditions
      partially, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory insisted that he had no desire to make any other
      arrangements, and so, thereafter, whenever an invitation
      was extended to him, Blount was always somehow included,
      although, as he could see, they did not like it. Not that
      Imogene seemed to mind, but Mrs. Skelton always complained,
      "Must we wait for him?" or "Isn't it possible, ever, to go
      anywhere without him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory explained how it was. Blount was an old and dear
      friend of his. They were practically spending the summer
      together. Blount had nothing to do just now. . . . They
      seemed to take it all in the best part, and thereafter
      Blount was always ready, and even willing to suggest that
      they come along with him in his car.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the more these accidental prearrangements occurred, the
      more innocently perverse was Mrs. Skelton in proposing
      occasional trips of her own. There was an interesting walk
      through the pines and across the dunes to a neighboring
      hotel which had a delightful pavilion, and this she was
      always willing to essay with just Gregory. Only, whenever
      he agreed to this, and they were about to set out, Imogene
      would always appear and would have to be included. Then
      Mrs. Skelton would remember that she had forgotten her
      parasol or purse or handkerchief, and would return for it,
      leaving Imogene and Gregory to stroll on together. But
      Gregory would always wait until Mrs. Skelton returned. He
      was not to be entrapped like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      By now he and Imogene, in spite of this atmosphere of
      suspicion and uncertainty, had become very friendly. She
      liked him, he could see that. She looked at him with a
      slight widening of the eyes and a faint distention of the
      nostrils at times, which spelled--what? And when seated
      with him in the car, or anywhere else, she drew near him in
      a gently inclusive and sympathetic and coaxing way. She had
      been trying to teach him to dance of late, and scolding him
      in almost endearing phrases such as "Now, you bad boy," or
      "Oh, butterfingers!" (when once he had dropped something),
      or "Big, clumsy one--how big and strong you really are. I
      can scarcely guide you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And to him, in spite of all her dark chicane, she was
      really beautiful, and so graceful! What a complexion, he
      said to himself on more than one occasion. How light and
      silken her hair! And her eyes, hard and gray-brown, and yet
      soft, too--to him. Her nose was so small and straight, and
      her lip line so wavily cut, like an Englishwoman's, full
      and drooping in the center of the upper lip. And she looked
      at him so when they were alone! It was disturbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as to the Blue Trailer on these careening nights.
      Chancing one night to be invited by Mrs. Skelton for a
      twenty-five-mile run to Bayside, Blount accompanying them,
      they had not gone ten miles, it seemed to him, when the hum
      of a peculiarly and powerfully built motor came to him. It
      was like a distant bee buzzing, or a hornet caught under a
      glass. There was something fierce about it, savage. On the
      instant he recalled it now, recognized it as the great blue
      machine belonging to young Castleman. Why should he be
      always hearing it, he asked, when they were out? And then
      quite thoughtlessly he observed to Imogene:
    </p>
    <p>
      "That sounds like Castleman's car, doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does, doesn't it?" she innocently replied. "I wonder if
      it could be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing caused him to think any more about it just then,
      but another time when he was passing along a distant road
      he heard its motor nearby on another road, and then it
      passed them. Again, it brought its customary group to the
      same inn in which he and Blount and Imogene and Mrs.
      Skelton were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it came to him just what it meant. The last time
      he had heard it, and every time before that, he now
      remembered, its sound had been followed by its appearance
      at some roadside inn or hotel whenever he Imogene and
      Blount happened to be in the same party; and it always
      brought with it this selfsame group of young men ("joy
      riders," they called themselves), accidentally happening in
      on them, as they said. And now he remembered (and this fact
      was corroborated by the watchful Blount) that if the car
      had not been heard, and they had not appeared, either Mrs.
      Skelton or Imogene invariably sought the ladies' retiring
      room once they had reached their destination, if they had
      one, when later the car would be heard tearing along in the
      distance and the "joy riders" would arrive. But what for?
      How to compromise him exactly, if at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      One night after Mrs. Skelton had left them in one of these
      inns, but before the joy riders had arrived, Gregory was
      sitting at the edge of a balcony overlooking a silent grove
      of pines when suddenly it seemed to him that he heard it
      coming in the distance, this great rumbling brute, baying
      afar off, like a bloodhound on the scent. There was
      something so eerie, uncanny about it or about the night,
      which made it so. And then a few moments later it appeared,
      and the four cronies strolled in, smart and summery in
      their appearance, seemingly surprised to find them all
      there. Gregory felt a bit cold and chill at the subtlety of
      it all. How horrible it was, trailing a man in this way!
      How tremendous the depths of politics, how important the
      control of all the great seething cities' millions, to
      these men--Tilney and his friends,--if they could find it
      important to plot against one lone investigating man like
      this! Their crimes! Their financial robberies! How well he
      knew some of them--and how near he was to being able to
      prove some of them and drive them out, away from the public
      treasury and the emoluments and honors of office!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was why he was so important to them now--he a
      self-established newspaperman with a self-established
      investigating bureau. Actually, it was villainous, so dark
      and crafty. What were they planning, these two smiling
      women at his side and these four smart rounders, with their
      pink cheeks and affable manners? What could they want of
      him really? How would it all end?
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Skelton, Imogene, Blount and himself were preparing
      to return, and Castleman and his friends were entering
      their own car, a third party hitherto unknown to Blount or
      Gregory appeared and engaged the two women in conversation,
      finally persuading them to return with them in their car.
      Mrs. Skelton thereupon apologized and explained that they
      were old friends whom she had not seen for a long time, and
      that they would all meet at the hotel later for a game of
      bridge. Blount and Gregory, left thus to themselves,
      decided to take a short cut to a nearby turnpike so as to
      beat them home. The move interested them, although they
      could not explain it at the time. It was while they were
      following this road, however, through a section heavily
      shaded with trees, that they were suddenly confronted by
      the blazing lights of another machine descending upon them
      at full speed from the opposite direction, and even though
      Blount by the most amazing dexterity managed to throw his
      car into the adjacent fence and wood, still it came so
      close and was traveling at such terrific speed that it
      clipped their left rear wheel as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Castleman's car!" Blount said softly after it had passed.
      "I saw him. They missed us by an inch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of that!" exclaimed Gregory cynically.
      "I wonder if they'll come back to see the result of their
      work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as they were talking, however, they heard the big car
      returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, this looks serious! I don't like the looks of it!"
      whispered Blount. "That car would have torn us to bits and
      never been scratched. And here they are now. Better look
      out for them. It's just as well that we're armed. You have
      your gun, haven't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other group approached most brazenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hello! Any trouble?" they called from a distance. "So
      sorry," and then as though they had just discovered it,
      "--well, if it isn't Gregory and Blount! Well, well,
      fellows, so sorry! It was an accident, I assure you. Our
      steering gear is out of order."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory and Blount had previously agreed to stand their
      ground, and if any further treachery were intended it was
      to be frustrated with bullets. The situation was partially
      saved or cleared up by the arrival of a third car
      containing a party of four middle-aged men who, seeing them
      in the wood and the other car standing by, stopped to
      investigate. It was Gregory's presence of mind which kept
      them there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mind staying by, Mister, until that other car
      leaves?" he whispered to one of the newcomers who was
      helping to extricate Blount's machine. "I think they
      purposely tried to wreck us, but I'm not sure; anyway, we
      don't want to be left alone with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding themselves thus replaced and the others determined
      to stay, Castleman and his followers were most apologetic
      and helpful. They had forgotten something back at the inn,
      they explained, and were returning for it. As they had
      reached this particular spot and had seen the light of
      Blount's car, they had tried to stop, but something had
      gone wrong with the steering gear. They had tried to turn,
      but couldn't, and had almost wrecked their own car. Was
      there any damage? They would gladly pay. Blount assured
      them there was not, the while he and Gregory accepted their
      apologies in seeming good part, insisting, however, that
      they needed no help. After they had gone Blount and
      Gregory, with the strangers as guards, made their way to
      the hotel, only to find it dark and deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an amazing thing it all was, Gregory said to himself
      over and over, the great metropolis threaded with plots
      like this for spoil--cold blooded murder attempted, and
      that by a young girl and these young men scarcely in their
      middle twenties, and yet there was no way to fix it on
      them. Here he was, fairly convinced that on two occasions
      murder had been planned or attempted, and still he could
      prove nothing, not a word, did not even dare to accuse any
      one! And Imogene, this girl of beauty and gayety,
      pretending an affection for him--and he half believing
      it--and at the same time convinced that she was in on the
      plot in some way. Had he lost his senses?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was for getting out now posthaste, feeling as he did
      that he was dealing with a band of murderers who were
      plotting his death by "accident" in case they failed to
      discredit him by some trick or plot, but Blount was of
      another mind. He could not feel that this was a good time
      to quit After all, everything had been in their favor so
      far. In addition, Blount had come to the conclusion that
      the girl was a very weak tool of these other people, not a
      clever plotter herself. He argued this, he said, from
      certain things which he had been able thus far to find out
      about her. She had once been, he said, the private
      secretary or personal assistant to a well known banker
      whose institution had been connected with the Tilney
      interests in Penyank, and whose career had ended in his
      indictment and flight. Perhaps there had been some papers
      which she had signed as the ostensible secretary or
      treasurer, which might make her the victim of Tilney or of
      some of his political friends. Besides, by now he was
      willing to help raise money to carry Gregory's work on in
      case he needed any. The city should be protected from such
      people. But Blount considered Imogene a little soft or
      easy, and thought that Gregory could influence her help him
      if he tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stick it out," he insisted. "Stick it out. It looks pretty
      serious, I know, but you want to remember that you won't be
      any better off anywhere else, and here we at least know
      what we're up against. They know by now that we're getting
      on to them. They must. They're getting anxious, that's all,
      and the time is getting short. You might send for your
      wife, but that wouldn't help any. Besides, if you play your
      cards right with this girl you might get her to come over
      to your side. In spite of what she's doing, I think she
      likes you." Gregory snorted. "Or you might make her like
      you, and then you could get the whole scheme out of her.
      See how she looks at you all the time! And don't forget
      that every day you string this thing along without letting
      them bring it to a disastrous finish, the nearer you are to
      the election. If this goes on much longer without their
      accomplishing anything, Tilney won't have a chance to frame
      up anything new before the election will be upon him, and
      then it will be too late. Don't you see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      On the strength of this, Gregory agreed to linger a little
      while longer, but he felt that it was telling on his
      nerves. He was becoming irritable and savage, and the more
      he thought about it the worse he felt. To think of having
      to be pleasant to people who were murderers at heart and
      trying to destroy you!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, however, he saw Imogene at breakfast,
      fresh and pleasant, and with that look of friendly interest
      in her eyes which more and more of late she seemed to wear
      and in spite of himself he was drawn to her, although he
      did his best to conceal it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't you come back last night to play cards with
      us?" she asked. "We waited and waited for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, haven't you heard about the latest 'accident'?" he
      asked, with a peculiar emphasis on the word, and looking at
      her with a cynical mocking light in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. What accident?" She seemed thoroughly unaware that
      anything had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't know, of course, that Castleman's car almost
      ran us down after you left us last night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" she exclaimed with genuine surprise. "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, just after you left us, in the wood beyond
      Bellepoint. It was so fortunate of you two to have left
      just when you did." And he smiled and explained briefly and
      with some cynical comments as to the steering gear that
      wouldn't work.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so, he examined her sharply and she looked at him
      with what he thought might be pain or fear or horror in her
      glance. Certainly it was not a look disguising a
      sympathetic interest in the plans of her friends or
      employers, if they were such. Her astonishment was so
      obviously sincere, confusing, revealing, in a way that it
      all but won him. He could not make himself believe that she
      had had a hand in that anyhow. It must be as Blount said,
      that she was more of a tool herself than anything else. She
      probably couldn't help herself very well or didn't know the
      lengths to which her pretended "friends" were prepared to
      go. Her eyes seemed troubled, sad. She seemed weaker, more
      futile, than at any time since he had known her, and this,
      while it did not add particularly to his respect, softened
      his personal animosity. He felt that under the
      circumstances he might come to like her. He also thought
      that she might be made to like him enough to help him. He
      had the emotional mastery of her, he thought, and that was
      something. He had described the incident with all the
      vividness of detail that he could, showing how he and
      Blount had escaped death by a hair's breadth. She seemed a
      little sick, and shortly after left the table. Gregory had
      taken good care to make it plain that the strangers in the
      other car had been informed as to the exact details of the
      case, and had offered their services as witnesses in case
      they were wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we don't propose to do anything about it," he said
      genially, "not now, anyhow," and it was that she seemed to
      become a little sick or faint, and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether owing to this conversation or the accident itself,
      or to circumstances concerning which he knew nothing, there
      now seemed to come a temporary lull in the activities of
      this group. The Blue Trailer disappeared as an active daily
      fact in their lives. Mrs. Skelton was called to the city on
      business for a few days, as well as Mr. Diamondberg, the
      "cloak and suit man," as Blount always called him, who in
      all the time he had been there had never publicly joined
      them. Mrs. Skelton came back later as cheerful and
      optimistic as ever, but in the meanwhile there had been an
      approach on the part of Imogene toward himself which seemed
      to promise a new order of things. She was freer, more
      natural and more genial than she had been hitherto. She was
      with him more, smiling, playful, and yet concerned, he
      thought. Because of their conversation the morning after
      the accident, he felt easier in her presence, more
      confidential, as though he might be able to talk to her
      about all this soon and get her to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had two hours together on the second afternoon of the
      absence of the others which brought them within sight of
      each other's point of view. It began after lunch, because
      Gregory had some reports to examine and was staying here to
      do it. She came over and stood beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm looking up some facts," he replied enigmatically,
      smiling up at her. "Sit down."
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell into conversation first about a tennis match
      which was being held here, and then about his work, which
      he described in part after observing that she knew all
      about it, or ought to.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you always talk to me that way about everything in
      connection with you?" she asked after a moment's pause.
      "You have such a queer way of speaking, as though I knew
      something I ought not to know about your affairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you do, don't you?" he questioned grimly, staring at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, there it is again! What do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really need to have me explain to you?" he went on
      in a hard cynical manner. "As though you didn't know! I
      don't suppose you ever heard of the Union Bank of Penyank,
      for instance? Or Mr. Swayne, its president? Or Mr. Riley,
      or Mr. Mears, the cashier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of these, as at the mention of the
      automobile accident, there was something which seemed to
      click like a camera shutter in her eyes, only this time
      there was no sign of pain, none even of confusion. She
      seemed, except for a faint trace of color, to be fairly
      calm and poised. She opened her mouth slightly, but more in
      an attempted smile of tolerance than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Union Bank? Mr. Swayne? Mr. Tilney? What are you
      talking about?" she persisted. "Who is Mr. Swayne, and
      where is the Union Bank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, now, Miss Carle," he said with a kind of dogmatic
      fury, "if you want me to have any regard of any kind for
      you in the future, quit lying about this. You know well
      enough what I mean. You know who Mr. Swayne is, all right,
      and why he left Eastridge. You also know Mr. Diamondberg,
      although I heard you say you didn't, and that right after I
      had seen you walking with him out here on the dunes three
      weeks ago. You don't remember that, I suppose?" this as she
      fluttered slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared, completely shaken out of her composure, and a
      real flush spread over her cheeks and neck. For the moment
      her expression hardened the least bit, then gave way to one
      of mingled weakness and confusion. She looked more or less
      guilty and genuinely distrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Mr. Gregory," she pleaded weakly, "how you talk!
      Positively, I haven't the slightest idea of what you mean,
      and I wish you wouldn't be so rough. I don't think you know
      what you're talking about, or if you do you certainly don't
      know anything about me. You must have me mixed up with some
      one else, or with something that I don't know anything
      about." She moved as if to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now listen to me a minute," he said sharply, "and don't be
      so ready to leave. You know who I am, and just what I'm
      doing. I'm running an investigation bureau on my own
      account with which I mean to break up the present city
      political ring, and I have a lot of evidence which might
      cause Mr. Tilney and the mayor and some others a lot of
      trouble this fall, and they know it, and that's why you're
      out here. Mr. Tilney is connected with the mayor, and he
      used to be a bosom friend of your friend, Jack Swayne. And
      Diamondberg and Mrs. Skelton are in his employ right now,
      and so are you. You think I don't know that Castleman and
      his friends were working with you and Mrs. Skelton, and
      Diamondberg and these 'brokers' also, and that Castleman
      tried to run into us the other night and kill me, and that
      I'm being watched here all the time and spied on, but I am,
      and I know it, and I'm not in the dark as to anything--not
      one thing--not even you," and he leered at her angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now wait a moment," he went on quickly as she opened her
      mouth and started to say something. "You don't look to me
      to be so crafty and devilish as all this seems, or I
      wouldn't be talking to you at all, and your manner all
      along has been so different--you've appeared so friendly
      and sympathetic, that I've thought at times that maybe you
      didn't know exactly what was going on. Now, however, I see
      that you do. Your manner the other morning at breakfast
      made me think that possibly you were not so bad as you
      seemed. But now I see that you've been lying to me all
      along about all this, just as I thought, only I must say
      that up to now I haven't been willing to believe it. This
      isn't the first time an attempt has been made to get people
      in this way, though. It's an old political trick, only
      you're trying to work it once more, and I don't propose
      that you shall work it on me if I can help it. Plainly, you
      people wouldn't hesitate to kill me, any more than Tilney
      hesitated to ruin Crothers three years ago, or than he
      would hesitate to ruin me or any other man or woman who got
      in his path, but he hasn't got me yet, and he's not going
      to, and you can tell him that for me. He's a crook. He
      controls a bunch of crooks--the mayor and all the people
      working with him--and if you're in with them, as I know you
      are, and know what you're doing, you're a crook too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh, oh! Don't!" she exclaimed. "Please don't! This is
      too terrible! To think that you should talk to me in this
      way!" but she made no attempt to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I want to tell you something more, Miss Carle--if
      that's your real name--" Gregory went on as she was putting
      her hands to her temples and exclaiming, and she winced
      again. "As I said before, you don't look to me to be as bad
      as you seem, and for that reason I'm talking to you now.
      But just see how it is: Here I am, a young man just
      starting out in the world really, and here you are trying
      to ruin me. I was living here with my wife and my little
      two-year-old baby peacefully enough until she had to go to
      the mountains because our little boy was taken sick, and
      then you and Mrs. Skelton and Diamondberg and Castleman and
      the 'brokers' and all the rest of the crowd that are and
      have been around here watching and spying, came and began
      to cause me trouble. Now I'm not helpless. And you needn't
      think I wasn't warned before you came, because I was. There
      are just as many influential men on my side of the fence
      right now as there are on Tilney's--will be--and he isn't
      going to get away with this thing as easily as he thinks.
      But just think of your part in all this! Why should you
      want to ruin me or help these people? What have I ever done
      to you? I can understand Tilney's wanting to do it. He
      thinks that I have facts which will injure him, and I have,
      and that because I haven't made any public statement the
      evidence is still in my hands, and that if I am put out of
      the way or discredited the whole thing will blow over and
      nothing will happen to him--but it won't. Not now any more.
      It can't. This thing will go on just the same, whether I am
      here or not. But that isn't the point either. I was told
      two months ago that you would come, not by Mrs. Skelton,
      but by friends of mine, and that an attempt would be made
      on my life," and at that she opened her eyes wide and sat
      there apparently amazed, "and here you are on schedule time
      and doing just as you were told, and apparently you aren't
      the least bit ashamed to do it. But don't you think it's a
      pretty shabby game for you to play?" He stared at her
      wearily and she at him, but now for the moment she said
      nothing, just sat there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That big blue machine that was to have killed me the other
      night," he went on, stretching matters a little in so far
      as his own knowledge was concerned, "was all arranged for
      long before you came down here. I haven't the slightest
      idea why you work for Tilney, but I know now that that's
      what you're doing, and I'm sick of you and the whole thing.
      You're just a plain little crook, that's all, and I'm
      through with you and this whole thing, and I don't want you
      to talk to me any more. What's more, I'm not going to leave
      this hotel, either, and you can take that news to Tilney if
      you want to, or Mrs. Skelton or whoever else is managing
      things here for him. I've kept a day-to-day record of
      everything that's happened so far, and I have witnesses,
      and if anything more happens to me here I'm going to the
      newspapers and expose the whole thing. If you had any sense
      of decency left you wouldn't be in on anything like this,
      but you haven't--you're just a shabby little trickster, and
      that lets you out, and that's all I have to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up and made as if to walk off, while Miss Carle
      sat there, seemingly dazed, then jumped up and called after
      him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Gregory! Please! Please! Mr. Gregory, I want to tell
      you something!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and turned. She came hurriedly up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't go," she pleaded, "not just yet. Wait a minute.
      Please come back. I want to talk to you." And though he
      looked at her rather determinedly, he followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't understand how it is," she pleaded, with a look
      of real concern in her eyes. "And I can't tell you either,
      just now, but I will some time if you will let me. But I
      like you, and I really don't want to do you any harm.
      Really, I don't. I don't know anything about these
      automobile things you're telling about--truly I don't.
      They're all terrible and horrible to me, and if they are
      trying to do anything like that, I don't know it, and I
      won't have anything more to do with it--really I won't. Oh,
      it's terrible!" and she clenched her hands. "I do know Mr.
      Diamondberg now, I admit that, but I didn't before I came
      down here, and Mr. Swayne and Mr. Tilney. I did come here
      to see if I could get you interested in me, but they didn't
      tell me just why. They told me--Mrs. Skelton did--that you,
      or some people whom you represented, were trying to get
      evidence against some friends of theirs--Mr. Tilney's, I
      believe--who were absolutely innocent, that you weren't
      happy with your wife, and that if some one, any one, were
      able to make you fall in love with her or just become very
      good friends, she might be able to persuade you not to do
      it, you see. There wasn't any plan, so far as I know, to
      injure you bodily in any way. They didn't tell me that they
      wanted to injure you physically--really they didn't. That's
      all news to me, and dreadful. All they said was that they
      wanted to get some one to get you to stop--make it worth
      your while in a money way, if I could. I didn't think there
      was anything so very wrong in that, seeing all they have
      done for me in the past--Mr. Tilney, Mrs. Skelton and some
      others. But after I saw you a little while I--" she paused
      and looked at him, then away, "I didn't think you were that
      kind of a man, you see, and so--well, it's different now. I
      don't want to do anything to hurt you. Really I don't. I
      couldn't--now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you admit now that you do know Mr. Tilney," he
      commented sourly, but not without a sense of triumph behind
      it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just told you that," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, and Gregory stared at her suspiciously. That
      she liked him was plain, and in a sense it was different
      from that of a mere passing flirtation, and as for
      himself--well, he couldn't help liking her in a genial way.
      He was free to admit that to himself, in spite of her
      trickery, and that she was attractive, and as yet she
      personally had not done anything to him, certainly nothing
      that he could prove. She seemed even now so young, although
      so sophisticated and wise, and much about her face, its
      smoothness, the delicate tracery of hair about her
      forehead, the drooping pout of the upper lip, sharpened his
      interest and caused him to meditate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he inquired after a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I wish you wouldn't turn on me so and leave me," she
      pleaded. "I haven't done anything to you, have I? Not yet,
      anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just the point--not yet. There's the whole story in
      a nutshell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but I promise you faithfully that I won't, that I
      don't intend to. Really I don't. You won't believe me, but
      that's true. And I won't, I give you my word,--truly. Why
      won't you still be friends with me? I can't tell you any
      more about myself now than I have--not now--but I will some
      time, and I wish you would still be friends with me. I
      promise not to do anything to cause you trouble. I haven't
      really, have I? Have I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How should I know?" he answered testily and roughly, the
      while believing that this was a deliberate attempt on her
      part to interest him in spite of himself, to get him not to
      leave yet. "It seems to me you've done enough, being with
      these people. You've led me into going about with them, for
      one thing. I would never have gone with them on most of
      these trips except for you. Isn't that enough? What more do
      you want? And why can't you tell me now," he demanded,
      feeling in a way the authority of a victor, "who these
      people are and all about them? I'd like to know. It might
      be a help to me, if you really wanted to do something for
      me. What are their plans, their game?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I can't tell you any more than I have, truly
      I can't. If I find out, maybe I will some time. I promise
      to. But not now. I can't, now. Can't you trust me that
      much? Can't you see that I like you, when I tell you so
      much? I haven't any plan to injure you personally, truly I
      haven't. I'm obliged to these people in one way and
      another, but nothing that would make me go that far. Won't
      you believe me?" She opened her eyes very wide in injury.
      There was something new in her expression, a luring,
      coaxing something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't any one who is really close to me any more," she
      went on, "not anybody I like. I suppose it's all my own
      fault, but--" her voice became very sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his precautions and the knowledge that his wife
      was the best and most suitable companion for him in the
      world, and that he was permanently fixed through his
      affection for his child and the helpful, hopeful mother of
      it, nevertheless he was moved by some peculiarity of this
      girl's temperament. What power had Tilney over her, that he
      could use her in this way? Think of it--a beautiful girl
      like this!
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about Mrs. Skelton?" he demanded. "Who is she,
      anyhow? And these three gardeners around here? What is it
      they want?" (There were three gardeners of the grounds who
      whenever he and Imogene had been alone together anywhere
      managed somehow to be working near the scene--an arrival
      which caused him always instanter to depart.) "And
      Diamondberg?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She insisted that in so far as the gardeners were concerned
      she knew absolutely nothing about them. If they were
      employed by Mrs. Skelton or any one, it was without her
      knowledge. As for Diamondberg, she explained that she had
      only met him since she had come here, but that she really
      did not like him. For some reason Mrs. Skelton had asked
      her to appear not to know him. Mrs. Skelton, she persisted,
      had known her years before in Cincinnati, as she had said,
      but more recently in the city. She had helped her to get
      various positions, twice on the stage. Once she had worked
      for Mr. Swayne, yes, for a year, but only as a clerk. She
      had never known anything about him or his plans or schemes,
      never. When Gregory wanted to know how it was that he was
      to be trapped by her, if at all, she insisted that she did
      not believe that he was to be trapped. It was all to have
      been as she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory could not quite make out whether she was telling
      him the exact truth, but it was near enough, and it seemed
      to him that she could not be wholly lying. She seemed too
      frank and wishful. There was something sensuously
      affectionate in her point of view and her manner. He would
      know everything in the future, she insisted, if he wanted
      to, but only not now--please not now. Then she asked about
      his wife, where she was, when she was coming back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you love her very much?" she finally asked naively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I love her. Why do you ask? I've a two-year-old
      boy that I'm crazy about."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him thoughtfully, a little puzzled or
      uncertain, he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      They agreed to be friends after a fashion before they were
      through. He confessed that he liked her, but still that he
      did not trust her--not yet. They were to go on as before,
      but only on condition that nothing further happened to him
      which could be traced to her. She frankly told him that she
      could not control the actions of the others. They were
      their own masters, and, after a fashion, hers, but in so
      far as she could she would protect him. She did not believe
      that they intended to try much longer. In so far as she was
      concerned, he might go away if he chose. She could see him
      anywhere, if he would. She was not sure if that would make
      any difference in their plans or not. Anyhow, she would not
      follow him if he did go unless he wished it, but she would
      prefer that he did. Perhaps nothing more would happen here.
      If she heard of anything she would tell him, or try to, in
      time. But she could not say more than that now. After a
      while, maybe, as soon as she could get out of here . . .
      there were certain things over which she had no control.
      She was very enigmatic and secretive, and he took it to
      mean that she was involved in some difficult situation and
      could not easily extricate herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't take too much stock in her, at that," Blount
      reflected when Gregory had told him about it. "Just keep
      your eyes open, that's all. Don't have anything to do with
      her in a compromising way. She may be lying to you again.
      Once a crook, always a crook." Such was his philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Skelton returned on the third day after his long
      conversation with Imogene, and in spite of the fact that
      they had seemed to come closer together than ever before,
      to have established a friendly semi-defensive pact, still
      he sensed treachery. He could not make out what it was. She
      seemed to be friendly, simple, gay, direct, even
      wooing--and yet--what? He thought at one time that she
      might be the unconscious psychologic victim of Mrs. Skelton
      or of some one else; at other times, an absolutely
      unprincipled political philanderer. While pretending to be
      "on the level," as he phrased it, with him, she was
      crossing his path in such odd ways, making him uncertain as
      to whether, in spite of all she had said and was saying,
      she was still engaged in trying to compromise him. The
      whole thing began to take on the fascination of a game with
      the unconquerable lure of sex at the bottom of it--steeled
      as he was against compromising himself in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus once, after a late card game, when he stepped out on a
      small veranda or balcony which graced the end of the hall
      nearest which his room was situated, and which commanded a
      splendid view of the sea, he found her just outside his
      door, alone, diaphanously attired, and very sympathetic and
      genial. Now that they were friends and had had this talk,
      there was something in her manner which always seemed to
      invite him on to a closer life with her without danger to
      himself, as she seemed to say. She would shield him against
      all, at her own expense. At the same time he was far--very
      far--from yielding. More than once he had insisted that he
      did not want to have anything to do with her in an
      affectional way, and yet here she was on this occasion, and
      although there might or there might not have been anything
      very alarming in that, he argued with himself afterward,
      yet since he had told her, this could be made to look as
      though she were trying to overpersuade him, to take him off
      his guard. Any guest of the hotel might have done as much
      (her room was somewhere near there), but Rule One, as laid
      down by Blount, and as hitherto practised by him, was
      never, under any circumstances which might be
      misinterpreted, to be alone with her. And besides, when he
      withdrew, as, he did at once, excusing himself lightly and
      laughingly, he saw two men turning in at a cross corridor
      just beyond, and one, seeing him turn back, said to the
      other, "It must be on the other side, Jim." Well, there
      might not have been anything very significant in that,
      either. Any two men might accidentally turn into a hall on
      an end balcony of which a maiden was sitting in very
      diaphanous array, but still--
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same whenever he walked along the outer or sea
      wall at night, listening to the thunder of the water
      against the rapp which sustained the walk, and meditating
      on the night and the beauty of the hotel and the shabbiness
      of politics. Imogene was always about him when she might be
      with safety, as he saw it, but never under such
      circumstances as could be made to seem that they were alone
      together. Bullen, one of the two brokers, who seemed not a
      bad sort after his kind, came out there one night with Mrs.
      Skelton and Imogene, and seeing Gregory, engaged him in
      conversation and then left Imogene to his care. Gregory,
      hating to appear asininely suspicious under such
      circumstances, was genuinely troubled as to what to do in
      such cases as these. Always now he was drawn to her,
      painfully so, and yet-- He had told her more than once that
      he did not wish to be alone with her in this way, and yet
      here she was, and she was always insisting that she did not
      wish him to be with her if he objected to it, and yet look
      at this! Her excuse always was that she could not help it,
      that it was purely accidental or planned by them without
      her knowledge. She could not avoid all accidents. When he
      demanded to know why she did not leave, clear out of all of
      this, she explained that without great injury to herself
      and Mrs. Skelton she could not, and that besides he was
      safer with her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this?" he asked on this occasion. "Another plan?"
      Feeling her stop and pull back a little, he felt ashamed of
      himself. "Well, you know what I've been telling you all
      along," he added gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't be so suspicious, Ed. Why do you always act
      so? Can't I even walk out here? I couldn't avoid this
      to-night, truly I couldn't. Don't you suppose I have to
      play a part too--for a time, anyhow? What do you expect me
      to do--leave at once? I can't, I tell you. Won't you
      believe me? Won't you have a little faith in me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, come on," he returned crossly, as much irritated
      with himself as any one. "Give me your arm. Give a dog a
      bad name, you know," and he walked her courteously but
      firmly in the direction of the principal veranda, trying to
      be nice to her at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, Imogene, I can't and I won't do this. You must
      find ways of avoiding these things. If not, I'm not going
      to have anything to do with you at all. You say you want me
      to be friends with you, if no more. Very well. But how are
      we going to do it?" and after more arguments of this kind
      they parted with considerable feeling, but not altogether
      antagonistic, at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet by reason of all this finally, and very much to his
      personal dissatisfaction, he found himself limited as to
      his walks and lounging places almost as much as if he had
      been in prison. There was a little pergola at one end of
      the lawn with benches and flowering vines which had taken
      his fancy when he first came, and which he had been
      accustomed to frequent as a splendid place to walk and
      smoke, but not any more. He was too certain of being picked
      up there, or of being joined by Mrs. Skelton and Imogene,
      only to be left with Imogene, with possibly the three
      gardeners or a broker as witnesses. He could not help
      thinking how ridiculous it all was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He even took Imogene, he and Blount, in Blount's car, and
      Mrs. Skelton with them or not, as the case might be--it was
      all well enough so long as Blount was along--to one place
      or another in the immediate vicinity--never far, and always
      the two of them armed and ready for any emergency or fray,
      as they said. It seemed a risky thing to do, still they
      felt a little emboldened by their success so far, and
      besides, Imogene was decidedly attractive to both of them.
      Now that she had confessed her affection for Gregory she
      was most alluring with him, and genial to Blount, teasing
      and petting him and calling him the watchdog. Blount was
      always crowing over how well he and Gregory were managing
      the affair. More than once he had pointed out, even in her
      presence, that there was an element of sport or fascinating
      drama in it, that she "couldn't fool them," all of which
      was helping mightily to pass the time, even though his own
      and Gregory's life, or at least their reputation, might be
      at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, go on, is my advice," Blount kept saying now that
      he was being amused. "Let her fall in love with you. Make
      her testify on your behalf. Get a confession in black and
      white, if you can. It would be a great thing in the
      campaign, if you were compelled to use it." He was a most
      practical and political soul, for all his geniality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory could not quite see himself doing that, however. He
      was too fond of her. She was never quite so yielding, so
      close to him, as now. When he and Blount were out with her,
      now, the two of them ventured to rag her as to her part in
      all this, asking her whether the other car were handy,
      whether the gardeners had been properly lined up, and as to
      who was behind this tree or that house. "There'd be no use
      in going if everything wasn't just right," they said. She
      took it all in good part, even laughing and mocking them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better look out! Here comes a spy now," she would
      sometimes exclaim at sight of a huckster driving a wagon or
      a farm-hand pushing a wheelbarrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      To both Blount and Gregory it was becoming a farce, and yet
      between themselves they agreed that it had its charm. They
      were probably tiring her backers and they would all quit
      soon. They hoped so, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then one night, just as they had concluded that there
      might not be so very much to this plot after all, that it
      was about all over, and Mrs. Gregory was writing that she
      would soon be able to return, the unexpected happened. They
      were returning from one of those shorter outings which had
      succeeded the longer ones of an earlier day, Blount and
      Gregory and Imogene, and true to his idea of avoiding any
      routine procedure which might be seized upon by the enemy
      as something to expect and therefore to be used, Blount
      passed the main entrance and drove instead around to a side
      path which led to a sunk-in porch flanked on either side by
      high box hedges and sheltered furry pines. True also to
      their agreed plan of never being separated on occasions
      like this, they both walked to the door with Imogene,
      Blount locking his car so that it could not be moved during
      his absence. On the steps of this side porch they chaffered
      a little, bantering Imogene about another safe night, and
      how hard it was on the gardeners to keep them up so late
      and moving about in the dark in this fashion, when Imogene
      said she was tired and would have to go. She laughed at
      them for their brashness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You two think you're very smart, don't you?" she smiled a
      little wearily. "It would serve you right if something did
      happen to both of you one of these days--you know so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?" chuckled Blount. "Well, don't hold any
      midnight conferences as to this. You'll lose your beauty
      sleep if you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Gregory added, "Yes, with all this hard work ahead
      of you every day, Imogene, I should think you'd have to be
      careful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hush, and go on," she laughed, moving toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they had not gone more than a hundred and fifty feet
      down the shadowy side path before she came running after
      them, quite out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh dear!" she called sweetly as she neared them, and they
      having heard her footsteps had turned. "I'm so sorry to
      trouble you, but some one has locked that side door, and I
      can't open it or make them hear. Won't one of you come and
      help me?" Then, as the two of them turned, "That's right. I
      forgot. You always work in pairs, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Blount chortled. Gregory smiled also. They couldn't help
      it. It was so ridiculous at times--on occasions like this,
      for instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see how it is," Gregory teased, "the door may be
      very tightly closed, and it might take the two of us to get
      it open."
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Blount was really coming, he changed his mind.
      "I guess I can get it open for her. Don't bother this time.
      I'll have to be going in, anyhow," he added. The thought
      came to him that he would like to be with Imogene a little
      while--just a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blount left them after a cautioning look and a cheery good
      night. In all the time they had been together they had not
      done this, but this time it seemed all right. Gregory had
      never felt quite so close to Imogene as he did this
      evening. She had seemed so warm, laughing, gay. The night
      had been sultry, but mellow. They had tittered and jested
      over such trifling things, and now he felt that he would
      like to be with her a while longer. She had become more or
      less a part of his life, or seemingly so, such a genial
      companion. He took her arm and tucked it under his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was nice over there at the Berkeley," he commented,
      thinking of an inn they had just left. "Beautiful
      grounds--and that music! It was delightful, wasn't it?"
      They had been dancing together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear," she sighed, "the summer will soon be over, and
      then I'll have to be going back, I suppose. I wish it would
      never end. I wish I could stay here forever, just like
      this, if you were here." She stopped and looked at the
      treetops, taking a full breath and stretching out her arms.
      "And do look at those fire-flies," she added, "aren't they
      wonderful?" She hung back, watching the flashing fire-flies
      under the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not sit down here a little while?" he proposed as they
      neared the steps. "It isn't late yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really mean it?" she asked warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, I'm beginning to be so foolish as to want to
      trust you. Isn't that idiotic? Yes, I'm even going to risk
      fifteen minutes with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish you two would quit your teasing, just once," she
      pleaded. "I wish you would learn to trust me and leave
      Blount behind just once in a while, seeing that I've told
      you so often that I mean to do nothing to hurt you without
      telling you beforehand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory looked at her, pleased. He was moved, a little
      sorry for her, and a little sorrier for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself, his wife and baby, as he now saw, he
      had come along a path he should not have, and with one whom
      he could not conscientiously respect or revere. There was
      no future for them together, as he well knew, now or at any
      other time. Still he lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, here we are," he said, "alone at last. Now you can
      do your worst, and I have no one to protect me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would serve you right if I did, Mr. Smarty. But if I
      had suggested that we sit down for a minute you would have
      believed that the wood was full of spies. It's too funny
      for words, the way you carry on. But you'll have to let me
      go upstairs to change my shoes, just the same. They've been
      hurting me dreadfully, and I can't stand them another
      minute. If you want to, you can come up to the other
      balcony, or I'll come back here. I won't be a minute. Do
      you mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," he assented, thinking that the other balcony
      would not be as open as this, much too private for him and
      her. "Certainly not. Run along. But I'd rather you came
      back here. I want to smoke, anyhow," and he drew out his
      cigar and was about to make himself comfortable when she
      came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you'll have to get this door open for me," she said.
      "I forgot about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, that's right."
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached it, looking first for the large key which
      always hung on one side at this hour of the night, but not
      seeing it, looked at the lock. The key was in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was trying before. I put it there," she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid hold of it, and to his surprise it came open
      without any effort whatsoever, a thing which caused him to
      turn and look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you said it wouldn't open," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it wouldn't before. I don't know what makes it work
      now, but it wouldn't then. Perhaps some one has come out
      this way since. Anyhow, I'll run up and be down right
      away." She hurried up the broad flight of stairs which
      ascended leisurely from this entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory returned to his chair, amused but not conscious of
      anything odd or out of the way about the matter. It might
      well have been as she said. Doors were contrary at times,
      or some one might have come down and pushed it open. Why
      always keep doubting? Perhaps she really was in love with
      him, as she seemed to indicate, or mightily infatuated, and
      would not permit any one to injure him through her. It
      would seem so, really. After all, he kept saying to
      himself, she was different now to what he had originally
      thought, and what she had originally been, caught in a
      tangle of her own emotions and compelled by him to do
      differently from what she had previously planned. If he
      were not married as happily as he was, might not something
      come of this? He wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black-green wall of the trees just beyond where he was
      sitting, the yellow light filtering from the one bowl lamp
      which ornamented the ceiling, the fireflies and the sawing
      katydids, all soothed and entertained him. He was beginning
      to think that politics was not such a bad business after
      all, his end of it at least, or being pursued even. His
      work thus far had yielded him a fair salary, furnishing as
      it had excellent copy for some of the newspapers and
      political organizations--the best was being reserved for
      the last--and was leading him into more interesting ways
      than the old newspaper days had, and the future, outside of
      what had happened in the last few weeks, looked promising
      enough. Soon he would be able to deal the current
      administration a body blow. This might raise him to a high
      position locally. He had not been so easily frustrated as
      they had hoped, and this very attractive girl had fallen in
      love with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while he stared down the black-green path up which
      they had come, and then fixed his eyes in lazy
      contemplation on one of the groups of stars showing above
      the treetops. Suddenly--or was it suddenly?--more a whisper
      or an idea--he seemed to become aware of something that
      sounded, as he listened more keenly, like a light footfall
      in the garden beyond the hedge. It was so very light, a
      mere tickle of the grass or stirring of a twig. He pricked
      up his ears and on the instant strained every muscle and
      braced himself, not that he imagined anything very dreadful
      was going to happen, but--were they up to their old tricks
      again? Was this the wonderful gardeners again? Would they
      never stop? Removing the cigar from his mouth and stilling
      the rocker in which he had been slowly moving to and fro,
      he decided not to stir, not even to move his hands, so well
      concealed was he from the bushes on either side by the
      arrangement of the posts, one of which was to the left of
      him. In this position he might see and not be seen. Did
      they know he was there? How had they found out? Were they
      always watching yet? Was she a part of it? He decided to
      get up and leave, but a moment later thought it better to
      linger just a little, to wait and see. If he left and she
      came back and did not find him there--could it be that
      there was some new trick on foot?
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was thus swiftly meditating, he was using his ears
      to their utmost. Certainly there was a light footfall
      approaching along the other side of the hedge to the left,
      two in fact, for no sooner was one seemingly still, near at
      hand, than another was heard coming from the same
      direction, as light and delicate as that of a cat--spies,
      trappers, murderers, even, as he well knew. It was so
      amazing, this prowling and stalking, so desperate and
      cruel, that it made him a little sick. Perhaps, after all,
      he had better have kept Blount with him--not have lingered
      in this fashion. He was about to leave, a nervous thrill
      chasing up and down his spine, when he heard what he took
      to be Imogene's step on the stair. Then she was coming
      back, after all, as she had said. She was not a part of
      this as he had feared--or was she? Who could tell? But it
      would be foolish to leave now. She would see that he was
      wholly suspicious again, and that stage had somehow seemed
      to be passing between them. She had promised on more than
      one occasion to protect him against these others, let alone
      herself. Anyhow he could speak of these newcomers and then
      leave. He would let her know that they were hanging about
      as usual, always ready to take advantage of his good
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, her step having reached the bottom of the stair
      and ceased, she did not come out. Instead, a light that was
      beside the door, but out at this hour, was turned on, and
      glancing back he could see her shadow, or thought he could,
      on the wall opposite, to the right. She was doing
      something--what? There was a mirror below the light. She
      might be giving her hair a last pat. She had probably
      arrayed herself slightly differently for him to see. He
      waited. Still she did not come. Then swiftly, a sense of
      something treacherous came over him, a creeping sensation
      of being victimized and defeated. He felt, over his taut
      nerves, this thrilling fear which seemed to almost convey
      the words: Move! Hurry! Run! He could not sit still a
      moment longer, but, as if under a great compulsion, leaped
      to his feet and sprang to the door just as he thought he
      heard additional movements and even whispers in the dark
      outside. What was it? Who? Now he would see!
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside he looked for her, and there she was, but how
      different! When she had gone upstairs she had been arrayed
      in a light summery dress, very smart and out-door-ish, but
      here she was clothed in a soft clinging housedress such as
      one would never wear outside the hotel. And instead of
      being adjusted with her customary care, it was decidedly
      awry, as though she might have been in some disturbing and
      unhappy contest. The collar was slightly torn and pulled
      open, a sleeve ripped at the shoulder and wrist, the hang
      of the skirt over the hips awry, and the skirt itself torn,
      a ragged slit over the knee. Her face had been powdered to
      a dead white, or she herself was overcome with fear and
      distress, and the hair above it was disarranged, as though
      it had been shaken or pulled to one side. Her whole
      appearance was that of one who had been assailed in some
      evil manner and who had come out of the contest disarranged
      as to her clothes and shaken as to her nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brief as his glance was, Gregory was amazed at the
      transformation. He was so taken aback that he could not say
      anything, but just what it all meant came to him in an
      intuitive flash. To fly was his one thought, to get out of
      the vicinity of this, not to be seen or taken near it. With
      one bound he was away and up the easy stair three at a
      time, not pausing to so much as look back at her, meeting
      her first wide half-frightened stare with one of
      astonishment, anger and fear. Nor did he pause until he had
      reached his own door, through which he fairly jumped,
      locking himself in as he did so. Once inside, he stood
      there white and shaking, waiting for any sound which might
      follow, any pursuit, but hearing none, going to his mirror
      and mocking at himself for being such a fool as to be so
      easily outwitted, taken in, after all his caution and
      sophisticated talk. Lord! he sighed. Lord!
    </p>
    <p>
      And after all her protests and promises, this very evening,
      too, he thought. What a revelation of the unreliability and
      treachery of human nature! So she had been lying to him all
      the time, leading him on in the face of his almost boastful
      precautions and suspicions, and to-night, almost at the
      close of the season, had all but succeeded in trapping him!
      Then Tilney was not so easily to be fooled, after all. He
      commanded greater loyalty and cunning in his employees than
      he had ever dreamed. But what could he say to her, now that
      he knew what she really was, if ever he saw her again? She
      would just laugh at him, think him a fool, even though he
      had managed to escape. Would he ever want to see her again?
      Never, he thought. But to think that any one so young, so
      smooth, so seemingly affectionate, could be so ruthless, so
      devilishly clever and cruel! She was much more astute than
      either he or Blount had given her credit for.
    </p>
    <p>
      After moving the bureau and chairs in front of the door, he
      called up Blount and sat waiting for him to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, as he saw it now, she had meant to stage a
      seeming assault in which he would have been accused as the
      criminal and if they had sufficient witnesses he might have
      had a hard time proving otherwise. After all, he had been
      going about with her a great deal, he and Blount, and after
      he had told himself that he would not
    </p>
    <p>
      Her witnesses were there, close upon him, in the dark. Even
      though he might be able to prove his previous good
      character, still, considering the suspicious fact that he
      had trifled with her and this treacherous situation so
      long, would a jury or the public believe him? A moment or
      two more, and she would have screamed out that he was
      attacking her, and the whole hotel would have been aroused.
      Her secret friends would have rushed forward and beaten
      him. Who knows?--they might even have killed him! And their
      excuse would have been that they were justified.
      Unquestionably she and her friends would have produced a
      cloud of witnesses. But she hadn't screamed--there was a
      curious point as to that, even though she had had ample
      time (and she had had) and it was expected of her and
      intended that she should! Why hadn't she? What had
      prevented her? A strange, disturbing exculpating thought
      began to take root in his mind, but on the instant also he
      did his best to crush it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! I have had enough now," he said to himself. "She
      did intend to compromise me and that is all there is to it.
      And in what a fashion. Horrible. No, this is the end. I
      will get out now to-morrow, that is one thing certain, go
      to my wife in the mountains, or bring her home." Meanwhile,
      he sat there trembling, revolver in hand, wiping the sweat
      from his face, for he did not know but that even yet they
      might follow him here and attempt the charge of assault
      anyhow. Would they--could they? Just then some one knocked
      on his door, and Gregory, after demanding to know who it
      was, opened it to Blount. He quickly told him of his
      evening's experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Blount, heavily and yet amusedly, "she
      certainly is the limit. That was a clever ruse, say what
      you will, a wonder. And the coolness of her! Why, she joked
      with us about it! I thought you were taking a chance, but
      not a great one. I was coming around to thinking she might
      be all right, and now think of this! I agree with you that
      it is time for you to leave. I don't think you'll ever get
      her over to your side. She's too crafty."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Gregory was up early and on the veranda
      smoking and meditating as to his exact course. He would go
      now, of course, and probably never see this girl with her
      fiend's heart again. What a revelation! To think that there
      were such clever, ruthless, beautiful sirens about in the
      same world with such women as his wife! Contrast them--his
      wife, faithful, self-sacrificing, patient, her one object
      the welfare of those whom she truly loved, and then put on
      the other side of the scale this girl--tricky, shameless,
      an actress, one without scruples or morals, her sole object
      in life, apparently, to advance herself in any way that she
      might, and that at the expense of everybody and everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to leave without seeing her, but in spite of
      himself he sat on, telling himself that it would do no harm
      to have just one last talk with her in order to clear up
      whether she had really intended to scream or no--whether
      she was as evil as he really thought now, confront her with
      her enormous treachery and denounce her for the villainess
      she was. What new lie would she have on her tongue now, he
      wondered? Would she be able to face him at all? Would she
      explain? Could she? He would like to take one more look at
      her, or see if she would try to avoid him completely. This
      morning she must be meditating on how unfortunately she had
      failed, missed out, and only last night she had taken his
      hand and smoothed it and whispered that she was not so bad,
      so mean, as he thought her to be, and that some day he
      would find it out. And now see!
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited a considerable time, and then sent up word that
      he wanted to see her. He did not want to see this thing
      closed in this fashion with no chance to at least berate
      her, to see what new lie she would tell. After a while she
      came down, pale and seemingly exhausted, a weary look about
      her eyes as though she had not slept. To his astonishment
      she came over quite simply to where he was sitting, and
      when he stood up at her approach as if to ward her off,
      stood before him, seemingly weaker and more hopeless than
      ever. What an excellent actress, he thought! He had never
      seen her so downcast, so completely overcome, so wilted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he began as she stood there, "what new lie have you
      fixed up to tell me this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No lie," she replied softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Not a single lie? Anyhow, you'll begin by shamming
      contrition, won't you? You're doing that already. Your
      friends made you do it, of course, didn't they? Tilney was
      right there--and Mrs. Skelton! They were all waiting for
      you when you went up, and told you just what to do and how
      it had to be done, wasn't that it? And you had to do it,
      too, didn't you?" he sneered cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you I didn't have anything to say," she answered.
      "I didn't do anything--I mean I didn't intend to--except to
      signal you to run, but when you burst in on me that way--"
      He waved an impatient hand. "Oh, all right," she went on
      sadly. "I can't help it if you won't believe me. But it's
      true just the same. Everything you think, all except that
      automobile plot, and this is true, but I'm not asking you
      to believe me any more. I can't help it if you won't. It's
      too late. But I had to go through my part anyhow. Please
      don't look at me that way, Ed--not so hard. You don't know
      how really weak I am, or what it is that makes me do these
      things. But I didn't want to do anything to hurt you last
      night, not when I left you. And I didn't. I hadn't the
      slightest intention, really I hadn't. Oh, well, sneer if
      you want to! I couldn't help myself, though, just the
      same--believe it or not. Nothing was farther from my mind
      when I came in, only--oh, what a state my life has come to,
      anyhow!" she suddenly exclaimed. "You don't know. Your
      life's not a mess, like mine. People have never had you in
      any position where they could make you do things. That's
      just the trouble--men never know women really." ("I should
      say not!" he interpolated.) "But I have had to do so many
      things I didn't want to do--but I'm not pleading with you,
      Ed, really I'm not. I know it's all over between us and no
      use, only I wish I could make you believe that as bad as I
      am I've never wanted to be as bad to you as I've seemed.
      Really, I haven't. Oh, honestly--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, cut that stuff, please!" he said viciously. "I'm sick
      of it. It wasn't to hear anything like that that I sent for
      you. The reason I asked you to come down here was merely to
      see how far you would face it out, whether you would have
      the nerve to come, really, that was all--oh, just to see
      whether you would have a new lie to spring, and I see you
      have. You're a wonder, you are! But I'd like to ask you
      just one favor: Won't you please let me alone in the
      future? I'm tired, and I can't stand it any longer. I'm
      going away now. This fellow Tilney you are working for is
      very clever, but it's all over. It really is. You'll never
      get another chance at me if I know myself." He started to
      walk off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ed! Ed!" she called. "Please--just a minute--don't go yet,
      Ed," she begged. "There's something I want to say to you
      first. I know all you say is true. There's nothing you can
      say that I haven't said to myself a thousand times. But you
      don't understand what my life has been like, what I've
      suffered, how I've been pushed around, and I can't tell you
      now, either--not now. Our family wasn't ever in society, as
      Mrs. Skelton pretended--you knew that, of course,
      though--and I haven't been much of anything except a slave,
      and I've had a hard time, too, terrible," and she began
      dabbing her eyes. "I know I'm no good. Last night proved it
      to me, that's a fact. But I hadn't meant to do you any harm
      even when I came alone that way--really I didn't. I
      pretended to be willing, that was all. Hear me out, Ed,
      anyhow. Please don't go yet. I thought I could signal you
      to run without them seeing me--really I did. When I first
      left you the door was locked, and I came back for that sole
      reason. I suppose they did something to it so I couldn't
      open it. There were others up there; they made me go
      back--I can't tell you how or why or who--but they were all
      about me--they always are. They're determined to get you,
      Ed, in one way or another, even if I don't help them, and
      I'm telling you you'd better look out for yourself. Please
      do. Go away from here. Don't have anything more to do with
      me. Don't have anything more to do with any of these
      people. I can't help myself, honestly I can't. I didn't
      want to, but--oh--" she wrung her hands and sat down
      wearily, "you don't know how I'm placed with them, what it
      is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes? Well, I'm tired of that stuff," Gregory now added
      grimly and unbelievingly. "I suppose they told you to run
      back and tell me this so as to win my sympathy again? Oh,
      you little liar! You make me sick. What a sneak and a crook
      you really are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ed! Ed!" she now sobbed. "Please! Please! Won't you
      understand how it is? They have watched every entrance
      every time we've gone out since I came here. It doesn't
      make any difference which door you come through. They have
      men at every end. I didn't know anything about it until I
      went upstairs. Really, I didn't. Oh, I wish I could get out
      of all this! I'm so sick of it all. I told you that I'm
      fond of you, and I am. Oh, I'm almost crazy! I wish
      sometimes that I could die, I'm so sick of everything. My
      life's a shabby mess, and now you'll hate me all the time,"
      and she rocked to and fro in a kind of misery, and cried
      silently as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregory stared at her, amazed but unbelieving.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he insisted, "I know. The same old stuff, but I
      don't believe it. You're lying now, just as you have been
      all along. You think by crying and pretending to feel sad
      that you might get another chance to trick me, but you
      won't. I'm out of this to-day, once and for all, and I'm
      through with you. There's no use in my appealing to the
      police under this administration, or I'd do that. But I
      want to tell you this. If you follow me any longer, or any
      of this bunch around here, I'm going to the newspapers.
      There'll be some way of getting this before the courts
      somewhere, and I'll try it. And if you really were on the
      level and wanted to do anything, there's a way, all right,
      but you wouldn't do it if you had a chance, never, not in a
      million years. I know you wouldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Ed! Ed! You don't know me, or how I feel, or what I'll
      do," she whimpered. "You haven't given me a chance. Why
      don't you suggest something, if you don't believe me, and
      see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can do that easily enough," he replied sternly. "I
      can call that bluff here and now. Write me out a confession
      of all that's been going on here. Let me hear you dictate
      it to a stenographer, and then come with me to a notary
      public or the district attorney, and swear to it. Now we'll
      see just how much there is to this talk about caring for
      me," and he watched her closely, the while she looked at
      him, her eyes drying and her sobs ceasing. She seemed to
      pause emotionally and stare at the floor in a speculative,
      ruminative mood. "Yes? Well, that's different, isn't it? I
      see how it is now. You didn't think I'd have just the thing
      to call your bluff with, did you? And just as I thought,
      you won't do it. Well, I'm onto you now, so good day. I
      have your measure at last. Good-by!" and he started off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ed!" she called, jumping up suddenly and starting after
      him. "Ed! Wait--don't go! I'll do what you say. I'll do
      anything you want. You don't believe I will, but I will.
      I'm sick of this life, I really am. I don't care what they
      do to me now afterwards, but just the same I'll come.
      Please don't be so hard on me, Ed. Can't you see--can't you
      see--Ed--how I feel about you? I'm crazy about you, I
      really am. I'm not all bad, Ed, really I'm not--can't you
      see that? Only--only--" and by now he had come back and was
      looking at her in an incredulous way. "I wish you cared for
      me a little, Ed. Do you, Ed, just a little? Can't you, if I
      do this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with mingled astonishment, doubt,
      contempt, pity, and even affection, after its kind. Would
      she really do it? And if she did what could he offer her in
      the way of that affection which she craved? Nothing, he
      knew that. She could never extricate herself from this
      awful group by which she was surrounded, her past, the
      memory of the things she had tried to do to him, and he--he
      was married. He was happy with his wife really, and could
      make no return. There was his career, his future, his
      present position. But that past of hers--what was it? How
      could it be that people could control another person in
      this way she claimed, especially scoundrels like these, and
      why wouldn't she tell him about it? What had she done that
      was so terrible as to give them this power? Even if he did
      care for her what chance would he have, presuming her
      faithfulness itself, to either confront or escape the horde
      of secret enemies that was besetting him and her just now?
      They would be discovered and paraded forth at their worst,
      all the details. That would make it impossible for him to
      come forth personally and make the charge which would
      constitute him champion of the people. No, no, no! But why,
      considering all her efforts against him, should she come to
      his rescue now, or by doing so expect him to do anything
      for her by way of return? He smiled at her dourly, a little
      sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Well, Imogene, I can't talk to you about that now,
      not for the present, anyhow. You're either one of the
      greatest actresses and crooks that ever lived, or you're a
      little light in the upper story. At any rate, I should
      think that you might see that you could scarcely expect me
      to like you, let alone to love you, all things considered,
      and particularly since this other thing has not been
      straightened out. You may be lying right now, for all I
      know--acting, as usual. But even so--let's first see what
      you do about this other, and then talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, then away over the sea to where some
      boats were coming towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Ed," she said sadly, observing his distracted gaze,
      "you'll never know how much I do care for you, although you
      know I must care a lot for you, to do this. It's the very
      worst thing I can do for me--the end, maybe, for me. But I
      wish you would try and like me a little, even if it were
      only for a little while."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Imogene, let's not talk about that now," he replied
      skeptically. "Not until we've attended to this other,
      anyhow. Certainly you owe me that much. You don't know what
      my life's been, either--one long up-hill fight. But you'd
      better come along with me just as you are, if you're
      coming. Don't go upstairs to get any hat--or to change your
      shoes. I'll get a car here and you can come with me just as
      you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him simply, directly, beatenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Ed, but I wish I knew how this is going to end.
      I can't come back here after this, you know, if they find
      it out. I know I owe this to you, but, oh dear, I'm such a
      fool! Women always are where love is concerned, and I told
      myself I'd never let myself get in love any more, and now
      look at me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They went off to the city together, to his office, to a
      notary, to the district attorney's office--a great triumph.
      She confessed all, or nearly so, how she had formerly been
      employed by Mr. Swayne; how she had met Mr. Tilney there;
      how, later, after Swayne had fled, Tilney had employed her
      in various capacities, secretary, amanuensis, how she had
      come to look upon him as her protector; where and how she
      had met Mrs. Skelton, and how the latter, at Mr. Tilney's
      request (she was not sure, only it was an order, she said)
      had engaged--commanded, rather--her to do this work, though
      what the compulsion was she refused to say, reserving it
      for a later date. She was afraid, she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he had this document in his possession, Gregory was
      overjoyed, and still he was doubtful of her. She asked him
      what now, what more, and he requested her to leave him at
      once and to remain away for a time until he had time to
      think and decide what else he wished to do. There could be
      nothing between them, not even friendship, he reassured
      her, unless he was fully convinced at some time or other
      that no harm could come to him--his wife, his campaign, or
      anything else. Time was to be the great factor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet two weeks later, due to a telephone message from
      her to his office for just one word, a few minutes,
      anywhere that he would suggest, they met again, this time
      merely for a moment, as he told himself and her. It was
      foolish, he shouldn't do it, but still-- At this interview,
      somehow, Imogene managed to establish a claim on his
      emotions which it was not easy to overcome. It was in one
      of the small side booths in the rather out-of-the-way Grill
      Parzan Restaurant in the great financial district.
      Protesting that it was only because she wished to see him
      just once more that she had done this, she had come here,
      she said, after having dropped instantly and completely out
      of the life at Triton Hall, not returning even for her
      wardrobe, as he understood it, and hiding away in an
      unpretentious quarter of the city until she could make up
      her mind what to do. She seemed, and said she was, much
      alone, distrait. She did not know what was to become of her
      now, what might befall her. Still, she was not so unhappy
      if only he would not think badly of her any more. He had to
      smile at her seemingly pathetic faith in what love might do
      for her. To think that love should turn a woman about like
      this! It was fascinating, and so sad. He was fond of her in
      a platonic way, he now told himself, quite sincerely so.
      Her interest in him was pleasing, even moving, "But what is
      it you expect of me?" he kept saying over and over. "You
      know we can't go on with this. There's 'the girl' and the
      kid. I won't do anything to harm them, and besides, the
      campaign is just beginning. Even this is ridiculously
      foolish of me. I'm taking my career in my hands. This lunch
      will have to be the last, I tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Ed," she agreed wistfully, looking at him at the
      very close of the meal, "you have made up your mind,
      haven't you? Then you're not going to see me any more? You
      seem so distant, now that we're back in town. Do you feel
      so badly toward me, Ed? Am I really so bad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Imogene, you see for yourself how it is, don't you?"
      he went on. "It can't be. You are more or less identified
      with that old crowd, even though you don't want to be. They
      know things about you, you say, and they certainly wouldn't
      be slow to use them if they had any reason for so doing. Of
      course they don't know anything yet about this confession,
      unless you've told them, and I don't propose that they
      shall so long as I don't have to use it. As for me, I have
      to think of my wife and kid, and I don't want to do
      anything to hurt them. If ever Emily found this out it
      would break her all up, and I don't want to do that. She's
      been too square, and we've gone through too much together.
      I've thought it all over, and I'm convinced that what I'm
      going to do is for the best. We have to separate, and I
      came here to-day to tell you that I can't see you any more.
      It can't be, Imogene, can't you see that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even for a little while?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even for a day. It just can't be. I'm fond of you, and
      you've been a brick to pull me out of this, but don't you
      see that it can't be? Don't you really see how it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, then at the table for a moment, and then
      out over the buildings of the great city.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Ed," she reflected sadly, "I've been such a fool. I
      don't mean about the confession--I'm glad I did that--but
      just in regard to everything I've done. But you're right,
      Ed. I've felt all along that it would have to end this way,
      even the morning I agreed to make the confession. But I've
      been making myself hope against hope, just because from the
      very first day I saw you out there I thought I wouldn't be
      able to hold out against you, and now you see I haven't.
      Well, all right, Ed. Let's say good-bye. Love's a sad old
      thing, isn't it?" and she began to put on her things.
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped her, wondering over the strange whirl of
      circumstances which had brought them together and was now
      spinning them apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could do something more for you, Imogene, I
      really do," he said. "I wish I could say something that
      would make it a little easier for you--for us both--but
      what would be the use? It wouldn't really, now would it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she replied brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her to the elevator and down to the sidewalk, and
      there they stopped for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Imogene," he began, and paused. "It's not just the
      way I'd like it to be, but--well--" he extended his hand
      "--here's luck and good-by, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him pleadingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ed," she said, "Ed--wait! Aren't you--don't you want to?"
      she put up her lips, her eyes seemingly misty with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came back and putting his arm about her, drew her
      upturned lips to his. As he did so she clung to him,
      seeming to vent a world of feeling in this their first and
      last kiss, and then turned and left him, never stopping to
      look back, and being quickly lost in the immense mass which
      was swirling by. As he turned to go though he observed two
      separate moving-picture men with cameras taking the scene
      from different angles. He could scarcely believe his
      senses. As he gazed they stopped their work, clapped their
      tripods together and made for a waiting car. Before he
      could really collect his thoughts they were gone--and
      then--
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I live!" he exclaimed. "She did do this to me after
      all, or did she? And after all my feeling for her!--and all
      her protestations! The little crook! And now they have that
      picture of me kissing her! Stung, by George! and by the
      same girl, or by them, and after all the other things I've
      avoided! That's intended to make that confession worthless!
      She did that because she's changed her mind about me! Or,
      she never did care for me." Grim, reducing thought!) "Did
      she--could she--know--do a thing like that?" he wondered.
      "Is it she and Tilney, or just Tilney alone, who has been
      following me all this time?" He turned solemnly and
      helplessly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now after all his career was in danger. His wife had
      returned and all was seemingly well, but if he proceeded
      with his exposures as he must, then what? This picture
      would be produced! He would be disgraced! Or nearly so.
      Then what? He might charge fraud, a concocted picture,
      produce the confession. But could he? Her arms had been
      about his neck! He had put his about her! Two different
      camera men had taken them from different angles! Could he
      explain that? Could he find Imogene again? Was it wise?
      Would she testify in his behalf? If so what good would it
      do? Would any one, in politics at least, believe a morally
      victimized man? He doubted it. The laughter! The jesting!
      The contempt! No one except his wife, and she could not
      help him here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sick at heart and defeated he trudged on now clearly
      convinced that because of this one silly act of kindness
      all his work of months had been undone and that now, never,
      so shy were the opposing political forces, might he ever
      hope to enter the promised land of his better future--not
      here, at least--that future to which he had looked forward
      with so much hope--neither he nor his wife, nor child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fool! Fool!" he exclaimed to himself heavily and
      then--"fool! fool!" Why had he been so ridiculously
      sympathetic and gullible? Why so unduly interested? but
      finding no answer and no clear way of escape save in denial
      and counter charges he made his way slowly on toward that
      now dreary office where so long he had worked, but where
      now, because of this he might possibly not be able to work,
      at least with any great profit to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tilney! Imogene! The Triton!" he thought--what clever
      scoundrels those two were--or Tilney anyhow--he could not
      be sure of Imogene, even now, and so thinking, he left the
      great crowd at his own door, that crowd, witless, vast,
      which Tilney and the mayor and all the politicians were
      daily and hourly using--the same crowd which he had wished
      to help and against whom, as well as himself, this little
      plot had been hatched, and so easily and finally so
      successfully worked.

      <a name="a9" id="a9">THE CRUISE OF THE "IDLEWILD"</a>
    </h1>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to say just how the trouble aboard
      the <i>Idlewild</i> began, or how we managed to sail
      without things going to smash every fifteen minutes; but
      these same constitute the business of this narrative. It
      was at Spike, and the weather was blistering hot. Some of
      us, one in particular, were mortal tired of the life we
      were leading. It was a dingy old shop inside, loaded with
      machines and blacksmithing apparatus and all the
      paraphernalia that go to make up the little depots and
      furniture that railways use, and the labor of making them
      was intrusted to about a hundred men all told--carpenters,
      millwrights, woodturners, tinsmiths, painters, blacksmiths,
      an engineer, and a yard foreman handling a score of
      "guineas," all of whom were too dull to interest the three
      or four wits who congregated in the engine room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old John, the engineer, was one of these--a big, roly-poly
      sort of fellow, five foot eleven, if he was an inch, with
      layers of flesh showing through his thin shirt and tight
      trousers, and his face and neck constantly standing in
      beads of sweat. Then there was the smith, a small, wiry man
      of thirty-five, with arms like a Titan and a face that was
      expressive of a goodly humor, whether it was very brilliant
      or not--the village smith, as we used to call him. Then
      there was Ike, little Ike, the blacksmith's helper, who was
      about as queer a little cabin boy as ever did service on an
      ocean-going steamer or in a blacksmith's shop--a small
      misshapen, dirty-faced lad, whose coat was three, and his
      trousers four, times too large for him--hand-me-downs from
      some mysterious source; immensely larger members of his
      family, I presume. He had a battered face, such as you
      sometimes see given to satyrs humorously represented in
      bronze, and his ears were excessively large. He had a big
      mouthful of dirty yellow teeth, two or three missing in
      front. His eyes were small and his hands large, but a
      sweeter soul never crept into a smaller or more misshapen
      body. Poor little Ike. To think how near he came to being
      driven from his job by our tomfoolishness!
    </p>
    <p>
      I should say here that the <i>Idlewild</i> was not a boat
      at all, but an idea. She evolved out of our position on
      Long's Point, where the Harlem joins the Hudson, and where
      stood the shop in which we all worked, water to the south
      of us, water to the west of us, water to the north of us,
      and the railroad behind us landward, just like the four--or
      was it the six? hundred--at Balaklava. Anyhow, we got our
      idea from the shop and the water all around, and we said,
      after much chaffering about one thing and another, that we
      were aboard the <i>Idlewild,</i> and that the men were the
      crew, and that the engineer was the captain, and I was the
      mate, just as if everything were ship-shape, and this were
      a really and truly ocean-going vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have said before. I do not know exactly how the idea
      started, except that it did. Old John was always admiring
      the beautiful yachts that passed up and down the roadstead
      of the Hudson outside, and this may have had something to
      do with it. Anyhow, he would stand in the doorway of his
      engine room and watch everything in the shape of a craft
      that went up and down the stream. He didn't know much about
      boats, but he loved to comment on their charms, just the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That there now must be Morgan's yacht," he used to say of
      a fine black-bodied craft that had a piano-body finish to
      it, an' "That there's the <i>Waterfowl</i>, Governor
      Morton's yacht. Wouldn' ja think, now, them fellers'd feel
      comfortable a-settin' back there on the poop deck an'
      smokin' them dollar cigars on a day like this? Aw, haw!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It would usually be blistering hot and the water a flashing
      blue when he became excited over the yacht question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right-o," I once commented enviously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aw, haw! Them's the boys as knows how to live. I wouldn'
      like nothin' better on a day like this than to set out
      there in one o' them easy chairs an' do up about a pound o'
      tobacco. Come now, wouldn't that be the ideal life for your
      Uncle Dudley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It truly would," I replied sadly but with an inherent
      desire to tease, "only I don't think my Uncle Dudley is
      doing so very badly under the circumstances. I notice he
      isn't losing any flesh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I dunno. I'm a little stout, I'll admit. Still, them
      conditions would be more congenial-like. I ain't as active
      as I used to be. A nice yacht an' some good old fifty-cent
      cigars an' a cool breeze'd just about do for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're too modest, John. You want too little. You ought to
      ask for something more suited to your Lucullian instincts.
      What do you say to a house in Fifth Avenue, a country place
      at Newport, and the friendship of a few dukes and earls?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm not backward," he replied. "If them things was
      to come my way I guess I could live up to 'em. Aw, haw!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, truly, John, you're quite right, but you might
      throw in a few shovelfuls of shavings just to show that
      there are no hard feelings between you and the company
      while you're waiting for all this. I notice your steam is
      getting low, eh? What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang the steam! If the road was decent they'd give a man
      coal to burn. It takes a hundred tons of shavin's a day to
      keep this blinged old cormorant goin'. Think of me havin'
      to stand here all day an' shovelin' in shavin's! Seems to
      me all I do here is shovel. I'm an engineer, not a fireman.
      They ought to gimme a man for that, by rights."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so! Quite so! We'll see about that later--only, for
      the present, the shavings for yours. Back to the shovel,
      John!" The tone was heavily bantering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the steam was gettin' a little low," John would
      cheerfully acknowledge, once he was able to resume his
      position in the doorway. It was these painful interruptions
      which piqued him so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of such chaffering and bickering as this it was that
      the spirit of the <i>Idlewild</i> finally took its rise. It
      came up from the sea of thought, I presume.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter with us having a boat of our own, John?"
      I said to him one day. "Here we are, out here on the
      bounding main, or mighty near it. This is as good as any
      craft, this old shop. Ease the thing around and hoist the
      Jolly Roger, and I'll sail you up to White Plains. What's
      the matter with calling her the <i>Idlewild?</i> The men
      will furnish the idle, and the bosses will furnish the
      wild, eh? How's that for an appropriate title?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw! Haw!" exclaimed stout John. "Bully! We'll fix 'er up
      to-day. You be the captain an' I'll be the mate an'--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far be it from me, John," I replied humbly and generously,
      seeing that he had the one point of vantage in this whole
      institution which would serve admirably as a captain's
      cabin--with his consent, of course. It was more or less
      like a captain's cabin on a tug-boat, at that, picturesque
      and with a sea view, as it were. "You be the captain and
      I'll be the mate. Far be it from me to infringe on a good
      old sea dog's rights. You're the captain, all right, and
      this is a plenty good enough cabin. I'm content to be mate.
      Open up steam, Cap, and we'll run the boat up and down the
      yard a few times. Look out the window and see how she
      blows. It's ho! for a life on the bounding main, and a
      jolly old crew are we!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right-o, my hearty!" he now agreed, slapping me on the
      back at the same time that he reached for the steamcock and
      let off a few preliminary blasts of steam--by way of
      showing that we were moving, as it were. The idea that we
      were aboard a real yacht and about to cruise forth actually
      seized upon my fancy in a most erratic and delightsome way.
      It did on John's, too. Plainly we needed some such idyllic
      dream. Outside was the blue water of the river. Far up and
      down were many craft sailing like ourselves, I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside of fifteen minutes we had appointed the smith,
      bos'n, and little Ike, the smith's helper, the bos'n's
      mate. And we had said that the carpenters and turners and
      millwrights were the crew and that the "guineas" were the
      scullions. Mentally, we turned the engineroom into the
      captain's cabin, and here now was nothing but "Heave ho-s"
      and "How does she blow thar, Bill-s?" and "Shiver my
      timbers-s" and "Blast my top-lights-s" for days to come. We
      "heaved ho" at seven o'clock in the morning when the engine
      started, "lay to and dropped anchor" at noon when the
      engine stopped, "hoisted and set sail" again at one, for
      heaven knows what port, and "sighted Spike" and "put hard
      to port" at six. Sometimes during the day when it was hot
      and we were very tired we took ideal runs to Coney and
      Manhattan Beach and Newport, where the best of breezes are,
      in imagination, anyhow, and we found it equally easy to
      sail to all points of the compass in all sorts of weather.
      Many was the time we visited Paris and London and Rome and
      Constantinople, all in the same hour, regardless, and our
      calls upon the nobility of these places were always a
      matter of light comment. At night we always managed to
      promptly haul up at Spike, which was another subject of
      constant congratulation between the captain and the mate.
      For if we had missed our trains and gotten home late!--
      Regardless of the fact that we were seafaring men, we
      wanted our day to end promptly, I noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the days which followed we elaborated our idea, and
      the <i>Idlewild</i> became more of a reality than is to be
      easily understood by those who have not indulged in a
      similar fancy. We looked upon the shop as a trusty ship
      with a wheel at the stern, where the millwright, an
      Irishman by the name of Cullen, ran the giant plane, and an
      anchor at the prow, where the engine-room was. And there
      was a light in the captain's eye at times which, to me at
      least, betokened a real belief. It is so easy to enter upon
      a fancy, especially when it is pleasing. He would stand in
      the doorway of his small, hot engine-room, or lean out of
      the window which commanded the beautiful sweep of water so
      close to our door, and at times I verily believe he thought
      we were under way, so great is the power of self-hypnotism.
      The river was so blue and smooth these summer days, the
      passing boats so numerous. We could see the waters race to
      and fro as the tides changed. It was such a relief from the
      dull wearisome grind of shoveling in shavings and carrying
      out ashes or loading cars, as I was occasionally compelled
      to do--for my health, in my own case, I should explain. I
      am sure that, as an ordinary
      fifteen-cent-an-hour-shaving-carrier, I valued my title of
      mate as much as I ever valued anything, and the smith, "the
      village smith," was smilingly proud to be hailed as
      "Bos'n." Little Ike being of an order of mind that fancied
      the world ended somewhere abruptly in the Rocky Mountains,
      and that you really could shoot buffaloes after you left
      Buffalo, New York, did not grasp the meaning of it all at
      once, but at last it dawned upon him. When he got the idea
      that we really considered this a ship and that he was the
      bos'n's mate with the privilege of lowering the boats in
      case of a wreck or other disaster, he was beside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hully chee!" he exclaimed, "me a bos'n's mate! Dat's de
      real t'ing, ain't it! Heave ho, dere!" And he fell back on
      the captain's locker and kicked his heels in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to remember, though, Ike," I said, once in an
      evil moment--what small things regulate the good and evil
      fortunes of all things!--"that this is the captain's cabin
      and bos'n's mates are not much shucks on a vessel such as
      the <i>Idlewild.</i> If you want to retain your position
      you want to be respectful, and above all, obedient. For
      instance, if the captain should choose to have you act as
      stoker for a few minutes now and then, it would be your
      place to rejoice at the request. You get that, do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not on yer life," replied Ike irritably, who understood
      well enough that this meant more work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right, though," chimed in big John, pleased beyond
      measure at this latest development. "I'm captain here now,
      an' you don't want to forget that. No back lip from any
      bos'n's mate. What the mate says goes. The shovel for
      yours, bos'n, on orders from the captain. Now jist to show
      that the boat's in runnin' order you can chuck in a few
      shovelfuls right now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Na! I will not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Ike," I said, "no insubordination. You can't go back
      on the captain like that. We have the irons for
      recalcitrants," and I eyed a pile of old rusty chains lying
      outside the door. "We might have to truss him up, Cap, and
      lay him down below," and to prove the significance of my
      thought I picked up one end of a chain and rattled it
      solemnly. The captain half choked with fat laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right. Git the shovel there, Ike."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ike looked as if he doubted the regularity of this, as if
      life on the briny deep might not be all that it was cracked
      up to be, but for the sake of regularity and in order not
      to be reduced to the shameful condition of a scullion, or
      worse, "irons," which was the only alternative offered, he
      complied. After he had thrown in eight scoopfuls we both
      agreed that this was true order and that the organization
      and dignity of the <i>Idlewild</i> might well be looked
      upon now as established.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things went from good to better. We persuaded Joe, who was
      the millwright's assistant, back at the "wheel," that his
      dignity would be greatly enhanced in this matter if he were
      to accept the position of day watch, particularly since his
      labors in that capacity would accord with his bounden
      duties as a hireling of the road; for, if he were stationed
      in the rear (front room, actually) anyhow, and compelled,
      owing to the need of receiving and taking away various
      planks and boards as they came out of the planes and
      molding machines, to walk to and fro, it would be an easy
      matter to notice any suspicious lights on the horizon
      forward and to come aft at once, or at least at such times
      as the boss was not looking, or when he came to heat his
      coffee or get a drink, and report.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amiable Joe! I can see him yet, tall, ungainly,
      stoop-shouldered, a slight cast in one eye, his head
      bobbing like a duck's as he walked--a most agreeable and
      pathetic person. His dreams were so simple, his wants so
      few. He lived with his sister somewhere in Eleventh Avenue
      downtown in a tenement, and carried home bundles of
      firewood to her at night all this great distance, to help
      out. He received (not earned--he did much more than that)
      seventeen and a half cents an hour, and dreamed of what? I
      could never quite make out. Marriage? A little cheap flat
      somewhere? Life is so pathetic at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Light on the starboard bow," or "Light on the port bow,"
      were the chosen phrases which we told him he was in duty
      bound to use, adding always "Sir," as respectful
      subordinates should. Also we insisted on his instantly
      making known to us at such times as we twain happened to be
      in the engine-room together, all bell buoys, whistle buoys,
      lighthouses, passing vessels and most of all the monthly
      pay car as it rounded the curve half a mile up the track
      about the fifteenth of every month. The matter of reporting
      the approach of the pay car was absolutely without
      exception. If he failed to do that we would be compelled,
      sad as it might be and excellent as his other services had
      been, to put him in irons. Here we showed him the irons
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe cheerfully accepted. For days thereafter he would come
      back regularly when the need of heating his coffee or
      securing a drink necessitated, and lifting a straight
      forefinger to his forehead, would report, "Light on the
      port bow, Sir. I think it's in the steel works jist up the
      track here," or "Light on the starboard, Sir. It's the fast
      mail, maybe, for Chicago, jist passin' Kingsbridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No thinks, Joseph," I used to reprimand. "You are not
      supposed to give your thinks. If the captain wishes to know
      what it is, he will ask. Back to the molding machine for
      yours, Joseph."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph, shock-headed, with dusty hair, weak eyes and a
      weaker smile, would retire, and then we would look at each
      other, the captain and I, and grin, and he would exclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty fair discipline, mate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I think we've got 'em going, Captain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothin' like order, mate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right, Cap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suppose the mate'd ever condescend to take orders
      like that, eh, mate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, hardly, Cap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, you don't want to forget that I'm captain, mate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you don't want to forget that I'm mate, Captain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we would badger one another until one of the scullion
      crew arrived, when without loss of dignity on either side
      we could easily turn our attention to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these scullions! What a dull crew! Gnarled, often
      non-English-speaking foreigners against or in front of whom
      we could jest to our hearts' content. They could not even
      guess the amazing things we were ordering them to do on
      penalty of this, that, and the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things went from better to best. We reached the place where
      the fact of the shop's being a ship, and the engineer the
      captain, and I the mate, and the smith the bos'n, <i>ad
      infinitum,</i> came to be a matter of general knowledge,
      and we were admired and congratulated and laughed with
      until nearly all the workers of the shop, with some
      trifling and unimportant exceptions, the foreman for one,
      began to share our illusion--carpenters, cabinet-makers,
      joiners, all. The one exception, as I say, was the foreman,
      only he was a host in himself, a mean, ill-dispositioned
      creature, of course, who looked upon all such ideas as
      fol-de-rol, and in a way subversive of order and good work.
      He was red-headed, big-handed, big-footed, dull. He had no
      imagination beyond lumber and furniture, no poetry in his
      soul. But the crew, the hundred-headed crew, accepted it as
      a relief. They liked to think they were not really working,
      but out upon a blue and dancing sea, and came back one by
      one, the carpenters, the tinsmiths, the millwrights, one
      and all, with cheerful grins to do us honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you're the captain, eh?" lazy old Jack, the partner of
      car-loading Carder, asked of the engineer, and John looked
      his full dignity at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I am, Jack," he replied, "only able seamen ain't
      supposed to ask too many familiar questions. Are they,
      mate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I should say not," I replied, arriving with a basket
      of shavings. "Able seamen should always salute the captain
      before addressing him, anyhow, and never fail to say
      <i>Sir.</i> Still, our crew is new. It's not very
      <i>able</i> and the seamen end of it is a little <i>on the
      fritz,</i> I'm thinking. But, all things considered, we can
      afford to overlook a few errors until we get everything
      well in hand. Eh, Captain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right, mate," returned the captain genially. "You're
      always right--nearly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before I could start an argument on this score, one of the
      able seamen, one who was thus discourteously commented on,
      observed, "I don't know about that. Seems to me the mate of
      this here ship ain't any too much shucks, or the captain
      either."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain and I were a little dismayed by this. What to
      do with an able seaman who was too strong and too dull to
      take the whole thing in the proper spirit? It threatened
      smooth sailing! This particular person was old Stephen
      Bowers, the carpenter from the second floor who never to us
      seemed to have quite the right lightness of spirit to make
      a go of all this. He was too likely to turn rough but
      well-meant humor into a personal affront to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Captain, there you are," I said cautiously, with a
      desire to maintain order and yet peace. "Mutiny, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does look that way, don't it?" big John replied, eyeing
      the newcomer with a quizzical expression, half humorous,
      half severe. "What'll we do, mate, under such
      circumstances?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lower a boat, Captain, and set him adrift," I suggested,
      "or put him on bread and water, along with the foreman and
      the superintendent. They're the two worst disturbers aboard
      the boat. We can't have these insubordinates breaking up
      our discipline."
    </p>
    <p>
      This last, deftly calculated to flatter, was taken in good
      part, and bridged over the difficulty for the time being.
      Nothing was taken so much in good part or seemed to soothe
      the feelings of the rebellious as to include them with
      their superiors in an order of punishment which on the very
      first day of the cruise it had been decided was necessary
      to lay upon all the guiding officers of the plant. We could
      not hope to control them, so ostensibly we placed them in
      irons, or lowered them in boats, classifying them as
      mutineers and the foreman's office as the lock-up. It went
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no, oh no, I don't want to be put in that class," old
      Bowers replied, the flattering unction having smoothed his
      ruffled soul. "I'm not so bad as all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then," I replied briskly. "What do you think,
      Captain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter looked at me and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think we kin let him go this wunst?" he inquired of
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure, sure," I replied. "If he's certain he doesn't want
      to join the superintendent and the foreman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Bowers went away smiling, seemingly convinced that we
      were going to run the boat in shipshape fashion, and before
      long most of the good-natured members of the crew consented
      to have themselves called able seamen.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly a month thereafter, during all the finest summer
      weather, there existed the most charming life aboard this
      ideal vessel. We used the shop and all its details for the
      idlest purposes of our fancy. Hammers became belaying pins,
      the machines of the shop ship's ballast, the logs in the
      yard floating debris. When the yard became too cluttered,
      as it did once, we pretended we were in Sargasso and had to
      cut our way out--a process that took quite a few days. We
      were about all day commenting on the weather in nautical
      phrases, sighting strange vessels, reporting disorders or
      mutiny on the part of the officers in irons, or the men, or
      announcing the various "bells," lighthouses, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an evil hour, however, we lit upon the wretched habit of
      pitching upon little Ike, the butt of a thousand quips.
      Being incapable of grasping the true edge of our humor, he
      was the one soul who was yet genial enough to take it and
      not complain. We called upon him to shovel ashes, to split
      the wood, to run aft, that was, to the back gate, and see
      how the water stood. More than once he was threatened with
      those same "irons" previously mentioned, and on one
      occasion we actually dragged in a length, pretending to
      bind him with it and fasten him to the anvil (with the
      bos'n's consent, of course), which resulted in a hearty
      struggle, almost a row. We told him we would put him in an
      old desk crate we had, a prison, no less, and once or
      twice, in a spirit of deviltry, John tried to carry out his
      threat, nailing him in, much against his will. Finally we
      went to the length of attempting to physically enforce our
      commands when he did not obey, which of course ended in
      disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this way. Ike was in the habit of sweeping up his
      room--the smith's shop--at three o'clock in the afternoon,
      which was really not reasonable considering that there were
      three hours of work ahead of all of us, and that he was
      inclined to resent having his fine floor mussed up
      thereafter. On the other hand I had to carry shavings
      through there all this time, and it was a sore temptation
      to drop a few now and then just for the devil's sake. After
      due consultation with the captain, I once requested him to
      order that the bos'n's mate leave the floor untouched until
      half past four, at least, which was early enough. The
      bos'n's mate replied with the very cheering news that the
      captain could "go to the devil." He wasn't going to kill
      himself for anybody, and besides, the foreman had once told
      him he might do this if he chose, heaven only knows why.
      What did the captain think that he (the bos'n's mate) was,
      anyhow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here at last was a stiff problem. Mutiny! Mutiny! Mutiny!
      What was to be done? Plainly this was inconveniencing the
      mate and besides, it was mutiny. And in addition it so
      lacerated our sense of dignity and order that we decided it
      could not be. Only, how to arrange it. We had been putting
      so much upon the bos'n's mate of late that he was becoming
      a little rebellious, and justly so, I think. He was always
      doing a dozen things he need not have done. Still, unless
      we could command him, the whole official management of this
      craft would go by the board, or so we thought. Finally we
      decided to act, but how? Direct orders, somehow, were
      somewhat difficult to enforce. After due meditation we took
      the bos'n, a most approving officer and one who loved to
      tease Ike (largely because he wanted to feel superior
      himself, I think), into our confidence and one late
      afternoon just after Ike had, figuratively speaking,
      swabbed up the deck, the latter sent him to some other part
      of the shop, or vessel, rather, while we strewed shavings
      over his newly cleaned floor with a shameless and lavish
      hand. It was intensely delicious, causing gales of laughter
      at the time--but--. Ike came back and cleaned this up--not
      without a growl, however. He did not take it in the
      cheerful spirit in which we hoped he would. In fact he was
      very morose about it, calling us names and threatening to
      go to the foreman [in the lock-up] if we did it again.
      However, in spite of all, and largely because of the
      humorous spectacle he in his rage presented we did it not
      once, but three or four times and that after he had most
      laboriously cleaned his room. A last assault one afternoon,
      however, resulted in a dash on his part to the foreman's
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not goin' to stand it," he is declared to have said by
      one who was by at the time when he appeared in front of
      that official. "They're strewin' up my floor with shavin's
      two an' three times every day after I've cleaned it up for
      the day. I'll quit first."
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman, that raw, non-humorous person previously
      described, who evidently sympathized with Ike and who, in
      addition, from various sources, had long since learned what
      was going on, came down in a trice. He had decided to stop
      this nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you fellows to cut that out now," he declared
      vigorously on seeing us. "It's all right, but it won't do.
      Don't rub it in. Let him alone. I've heard of this ship
      stuff. It's all damn nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain and mate gazed at each other in sad solemnity.
      Could it be that Ike had turned traitor? This was anarchy.
      He had not only complained of us but of the ship.--the
      <i>Idlewild!</i> What snakiness of soul! We retired to a
      corner of our now storm-tossed vessel and consulted in
      whispers. What would we do? Would we let her sink or try to
      save her? Perhaps it was advisable for the present to cease
      pushing the joke too far in that quarter, anyhow. Ike might
      cause the whole ship to be destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, even yet there were ways and ways of keeping
      her afloat and punishing an insubordinate even when no
      official authority existed. Ike had loved the engineroom,
      or rather, the captain's office, above all other parts of
      the vessel because it was so comfortable. Here between
      tedious moments of pounding iron for the smith or blowing
      the bellows or polishing various tools that had been
      sharpened, he could retire on occasion, when the boss was
      not about and the work not pressing (it was the very next
      room to his) and gaze from the captain's door or window out
      on the blue waters of the Hudson where lay the yachts, and
      up the same stream where stood the majestic palisades. At
      noon or a little before he could bring his cold coffee,
      sealed in a tin can, to the captain's engine and warm it.
      Again, the captain's comfortable locker held his coat and
      hat, the captain's wash bowl--a large wooden tub to one
      side of the engine into which comforting warm water could
      be drawn--served as an ideal means of washing up. Since the
      bos'n's mate had become friendly with the captain, he too
      had all these privileges. But now, in view of his
      insubordination, all this was changed. Why should a
      rebellious bos'n's mate be allowed to obtain favors of the
      captain? More in jest than in earnest one day it was
      announced that unless the bos'n's mate would forego his
      angry opposition to a less early scrubbed deck--
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, mate," the captain observed to the latter in the
      presence of the bos'n's mate, with a lusty wink and a leer,
      "you know how it goes with these here insubordinates, don't
      you? No more hot coffee at noon time, unless there's more
      order here. No more cleanin' up in the captain's tub. No
      more settin' in the captain's window takin' in the cool
      mornin' breeze, as well as them yachts. What say? Eh? We
      know what to do with these here now insubordinates, don't
      we, mate, eh?" This last with a very huge wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right, Captain. Very right," the mate replied.
      "You're on the right track now. No more favors--unless--
      Order must be maintained, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, all right," replied little Ike now, fully in earnest
      and thinking we were. "If I can't, I can't. Jist the same I
      don't pick up no shavin's after four," and off he strolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it, final and complete mutiny, and there was
      nothing more really to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      All we could do now was to watch him as he idled by himself
      at odd free moments down by the waterside in an odd corner
      of the point, a lonely figure, his trousers and coat too
      large, his hands and feet too big, his yellow teeth
      protruding. No one of the other workingmen ever seemed to
      be very enthusiastic over Ike, he was so small, so queer;
      no one, really, but the captain and the mate, and now they
      had deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was tough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet still another ill descended on us before we came to the
      final loss, let us say, of the good craft <i>Idlewild.</i>
      In another evil hour the captain and the mate themselves
      fell upon the question of priority, a matter which, so long
      as they had had Ike to trifle with, had never troubled
      them. Now as mate and the originator of this sea-going
      enterprise, I began to question the authority of the
      captain himself occasionally, and to insist on sharing as
      my undeniable privilege all the dignities and emoluments of
      the office--to wit: the best seat in the window where the
      wind blew, the morning paper when the boss was not about,
      the right to stand in the doorway, use the locker, etc. The
      captain objected, solely on the ground of priority, mind
      you, and still we fell a-quarreling. The mate in a stormy,
      unhappy hour was reduced by the captain to the position of
      mere scullion, and ordered, upon pain of personal assault,
      to vacate the captain's cabin. The mate reduced the captain
      to the position of stoker and stood in the doorway in great
      glee while the latter, perforce, owing to the exigencies of
      his position, was compelled to stoke whether he wanted to
      or no. It could not be avoided. The engine had to be kept
      going. In addition, the mate had brought many morning
      papers, an occasional cigar for the captain, etc. There was
      much rancor and discord and finally the whole affair, ship,
      captain, mate and all, was declared by the mate to be a
      creation of his brain, a phantom, no less, and that by his
      mere act of ignoring it the whole ship--officers, men,
      masts, boats, sails--could be extinguished, scuttled, sent
      down without a ripple to that limbo of seafaring men, the
      redoubtable Davy Jones's locker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was not inclined to believe this at first. On
      the contrary, like a good skipper, he attempted to sail the
      craft alone. Only, unlike the mate, he lacked the curious
      faculty of turning jest and fancy into seeming fact. There
      was a something missing which made the whole thing seem
      unreal. Like two rival generals, we now called upon a
      single army to follow us individually, but the crew, seeing
      that there was war in the cabin, stood off in doubt and, I
      fancy, indifference. It was not important enough in their
      hardworking lives to go to the length of risking the
      personal ill-will of either of us, and so for want of
      agreement, the ship finally disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she went down. The <i>Idlewild</i> was gone, and with
      her, all her fine seas, winds, distant cities, fogs,
      storms.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time indeed, we went charily by each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still it behooved us, seeing how, in spite of ourselves, we
      had to work in the same room and there was no way of
      getting rid of each other's obnoxious presence, to find a
      common ground on which we could work and talk. There had
      never been any real bitterness between us--just jest, you
      know, but serious jest, a kind of silent sorrow for many
      fine things gone. Yet still that had been enough to keep
      everything out of order. Now from time to time each of us
      thought of restoring the old life in some form, however
      weak it might be. Without some form of humor the shop was a
      bore to the mate and the captain, anyhow. Finally the
      captain sobering to his old state, and the routine work
      becoming dreadfully monotonous, both mate and captain began
      to think of some way in which they, at least, could agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember the <i>Idlewild</i>, Henry?" asked the ex-captain
			one day genially, long after time and fair weather
      had glossed over the wretched memory of previous quarrels
      and dissensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I do, John," I replied pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great old boat she was, wasn't she, Henry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was, John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' the bos'n's mate, he wasn't such a bad old scout, was
      he, Henry, even if he wouldn't quit sweepin' up the
      shavin's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He certainly wasn't, John. He was a fine little fellow.
      Remember the chains, John?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw! Haw!" echoed that worthy, and then, "Do you think the
      old <i>Idlewild</i> could ever be found where she's lyin'
      down there on the bottom, mate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she might, Captain, only she'd hardly be the same
      old boat that she was now that she's been down there so
      long, would she--all these dissensions and so on? Wouldn't
      it be easier to build a new one--don't you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know but what you're right, mate. What'd we call
      her if we did?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, how about the <i>Harmony,</i> Captain? That sounds
      rather appropriate, doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The <i>Harmony,</i> mate? You're right--the
      <i>Harmony</i>. Shall we? Put 'er there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put her there," replied the mate with a will. "We'll
      organize a new crew right away, Captain--eh, don't you
      think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right! Wait, we'll call the bos'n an' see what he says."
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the bos'n appeared, smiling goodnaturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what's up?" he inquired, noting our unusually
      cheerful faces, I presume. "You ain't made it up, have you,
      you two?" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what we have, bos'n, an' what's more, we're
      thinkin' of raisin' the old <i>Idlewild</i> an' renamin'
      her the <i>Harmony,</i> or, rather, buildin' a new one.
      What say?" It was the captain talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm mighty glad to hear it, only I don't think you
      can have your old bos'n's mate any longer, boys. He's gonna
      quit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gonna quit!" we both exclaimed at once, and sadly, and
      John added seriously and looking really distressed, "What's
      the trouble there? Who's been doin' anything to him now?"
      We both felt guilty because of our part in his pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Ike kind o' feels that the shop's been rubbin' it
      into him of late for some reason," observed the bos'n
      heavily. "I don't know why. He thinks you two have been
      tryin' to freeze him out, I guess. Says he can't do
      anything any more, that everybody makes fun of him and
      shuts him out."
    </p>
    <p>
      We stared at each other in wise illumination, the new
      captain and the new mate. After all, we were plainly the
      cause of poor little Ike's depression, and we were the ones
      who could restore him to favor if we chose. It was the
      captain's cabin he sighed for--his old pleasant
      prerogatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, we can't lose Ike, Captain," I said. "What good would
      the <i>Harmony</i> be without him? We sorely can't let
      anything like that happen, can we? Not now, anyhow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right, mate," he replied. "There never was a better
      bos'n's mate, never. The <i>Harmony's</i> got to have 'im.
      Let's talk reason to him, if we can."
    </p>
    <p>
      In company then we three went to him, this time not to
      torment or chastise, but to coax and plead with him not to
      forsake the shop, or the ship, now that everything was
      going to be as before--only better--and--
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we did.

    </p>
    <p>
      In connection with their social adjustment, one to the
      other, during the few months they had been together, there
      had occurred a number of things which made clearer to Duer
      and Marjorie the problematic relationship which existed
      between them, though it must be confessed it was clearer
      chiefly to him. The one thing which had been troubling Duer
      was not whether he would fit agreeably into her social
      dreams--he knew he would, so great was her love for
      him--but whether she would fit herself into his. Of all his
      former friends, he could think of only a few who would be
      interested in Marjorie, or she in them. She cared nothing
      for the studio life, except as it concerned him, and he
      knew no other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of his volatile, enthusiastic temperament, it was
      easy to see, now that she was with him constantly, that he
      could easily be led into one relationship and another which
      concerned her not at all. He was for running here, there,
      and everywhere, just as he had before marriage, and it was
      very hard for him to see that Marjorie should always be
      with him. As a matter of fact, it occurred to him as
      strange that she should want to be. She would not be
      interested in all the people he knew, he thought. Now that
      he was living with her and observing her more closely, he
      was quite sure that most of the people he had known in the
      past, even in an indifferent way, would not appeal to her
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take Cassandra Draper, for instance, or Neva Badger, or
      Edna Bainbridge, with her budding theatrical talent, or
      Cornelia Skiff, or Volida Blackstone--any of these women of
      the musical art-studio world with their radical ideas,
      their indifference to appearances, their semisecret
      immorality. And yet any of these women would be glad to see
      him socially, unaccompanied by his wife, and he would be
      glad to see them. He liked them. Most of them had not seen
      Marjorie, but, if they had, he fancied that they would feel
      about her much as he did--that is, that she did not like
      them, really did not fit with their world. She could not
      understand their point of view, he saw that. She was for
      one life, one love. All this excitement about
      entertainment, their gathering in this studio and that,
      this meeting of radicals and models and budding theatrical
      stars which she had heard him and others talking about--she
      suspected of it no good results. It was too feverish, too
      far removed from the commonplace of living to which she had
      been accustomed. She had been raised on a farm where, if
      she was not actually a farmer's daughter, she had witnessed
      what a real struggle for existence meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in Iowa, in the neighborhood of Avondale, there were no
      artists, no models, no budding actresses, no incipient
      playwrights, such as Marjorie found here about her. There,
      people worked, and worked hard. Her father was engaged at
      this minute in breaking the soil of his fields for the
      spring planting--an old man with a white beard, an honest,
      kindly eye, a broad, kindly charity, a sense of duty. Her
      mother was bending daily over a cook-stove, preparing
      meals, washing dishes, sewing clothes, mending socks, doing
      the thousand and one chores which fall to the lot of every
      good housewife and mother. Her sister Cecily, for all her
      gaiety and beauty, was helping her mother, teaching school,
      going to church, and taking the commonplace facts of
      mid-Western life in a simple, good-natured, unambitious
      way. And there was none of that toplofty sense of
      superiority which marked the manner of these Eastern
      upstarts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duer had suggested that they give a tea, and decided that
      they should invite Charlotte Russell and Mildred Ayres, who
      were both still conventionally moral in their liberalism;
      Francis Hatton, a young sculptor, and Miss Ollie Stearns,
      the latter because she had a charming contralto voice and
      could help them entertain. Marjorie was willing to invite
      both Miss Russell and Miss Ayres, not because she really
      wanted to know either of them but because she did not wish
      to appear arbitrary and especially contrary. In her
      estimation, Duer liked these people too much. They were
      friends of too long standing. She reluctantly wrote them to
      come, and because they liked Duer and because they wished
      to see the kind of wife he had, they came.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no real friendship to be established between
      Marjorie and Miss Ayres, however, for their outlook on life
      was radically different, though Miss Ayres was as
      conservative as Marjorie in her attitude, and as set in her
      convictions. But the latter had decided, partly because
      Duer had neglected her, partly because Marjorie was the
      victor in this contest, that he had made a mistake; she was
      convinced that Marjorie had not sufficient artistic
      apprehension, sufficient breadth of outlook, to make a good
      wife for him. She was charming enough to look at, of
      course, she had discovered that in her first visit; but
      there was really not enough in her socially, she was not
      sufficiently trained in the ways of the world, not
      sufficiently wise and interesting to make him an ideal
      companion. In addition she insisted on thinking this
      vigorously and, smile as she might and be as gracious as
      she might, it showed in her manner. Marjorie noticed it.
      Duer did, too. He did not dare intimate to either what he
      thought, but he felt that there would be no peace. It
      worried him, for he liked Mildred very much; but, alas!
      Marjorie had no good to say of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Charlotte Russell, he was grateful to her for the
      pleasant manner in which she steered between Scylla and
      Charybdis. She saw at once what Marjorie's trouble was, and
      did her best to allay suspicions by treating Duer formally
      in her presence. It was "Mr. Wilde" here and "Mr. Wilde"
      there, with most of her remarks addressed to Marjorie; but
      she did not find it easy sailing, after all. Marjorie was
      suspicious. There was none of the old freedom any more
      which had existed between Charlotte and Duer. He saw, by
      Marjorie's manner, the moment he became the least exuberant
      and free that it would not do. That evening he said,
      forgetting himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hey, Charlotte, you skate! Come over here. I want to show
      you something."
    </p>
    <p>
      He forgot all about it afterward, but Marjorie reminded
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honey," she began, when she was in his arms before the
      fire, and he was least expecting it, "what makes you be so
      free with people when they call here? You're not the kind
      of man that can really afford to be free with any one.
      Don't you know you can't? You're too big; you're too great.
      You just belittle yourself when you do it, and it makes
      them think that they are your equal when they are not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who has been acting free now?" he asked sourly, on the
      instant, and yet with a certain make-believe of manner,
      dreading the storm of feeling, the atmosphere of censure
      and control which this remark forboded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you have!" she persisted correctively, and yet
      apparently mildly and innocently. "You always do. You don't
      exercise enough dignity, dearie. It isn't that you haven't
      it naturally--you just don't exercise it. I know how it is;
      you forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      Duer stirred with opposition at this, for she was striking
      him on his tenderest spot--his pride. It was true that he
      did lack dignity at times. He knew it. Because of his
      affection for the beautiful or interesting things--women,
      men, dramatic situations, songs, anything--he sometimes
      became very gay and free, talking loudly, using slang
      expressions, laughing boisterously. It was a failing with
      him, he knew. He carried it to excess at times. His
      friends, his most intimate ones in the musical profession
      had noted it before this. In his own heart he regretted
      these things afterward, but he couldn't help them,
      apparently. He liked excitement, freedom,
      gaiety--naturalness, as he called it--it helped him in his
      musical work, but it hurt him tremendously if he thought
      that any one else noticed it as out of the ordinary. He was
      exceedingly sensitive, and this developing line of
      criticism of Marjorie's was something new to him. He had
      never noticed anything of that in her before marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to the time of the ceremony, and for a little while
      afterward, it had appeared to him as if he were lord and
      master. She had always seemed so dependent on him, so
      anxious that he should take her. Why, her very life had
      been in his hands, as it were, or so he had thought! And
      now--he tried to think back over the evening and see what
      it was he had done or said, but he couldn't remember
      anything. Everything seemed innocent enough. He couldn't
      recall a single thing, and yet--
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what you're talking about," he replied
      sourly, withdrawing into himself. "I haven't noticed that I
      lack dignity so much. I have a right to be cheerful,
      haven't I? You seem to be finding a lot that's wrong with
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now please don't get angry, Duer," she persisted, anxious
      to apply the corrective measure of her criticism, but
      willing, at the same time, to use the quickness of his
      sympathy for her obvious weakness and apparent helplessness
      to shield herself from him. "I can't ever tell you anything
      if you're going to be angry. You don't lack dignity
      generally, honey-bun! You only forget at times. Don't you
      know how it is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was cuddling up to him, her voice quavering, her hand
      stroking his cheek, in a curious effort to combine
      affection and punishment at the same time. Duer felt
      nothing but wrath, resentment, discouragement, failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't," he replied crossly. "What did I do? I don't
      recall doing anything that was so very much out of the
      way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wasn't that it was so very much, honey; it was just the
      way you did it. You forget, I know. But it doesn't look
      right. It belittles you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did I do?" he insisted impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it wasn't anything so very much. It was just when you
      had the pictures of those new sculptures which Mr. Hatton
      lent you, and you were showing them to Miss Russell. Don't
      you remember what you said--how you called her over to
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he answered, having by now completely forgotten. He
      was thinking that accidentally he might have slipped his
      arm about Charlotte, or that he might have said something
      out of the way jestingly about the pictures; but Marjorie
      could not have heard. He was so careful these days, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you said: 'Hey, Charlotte, you skate! Come over
      here.' Now, what a thing to say to a girl! Don't you see
      how ugly it sounds, how vulgar? She can't enjoy that sort
      of remark, particularly in my presence, do you think? She
      must know that I can't like it, that I'd rather you
      wouldn't talk that way, particularly here. And if she were
      the right sort of girl she wouldn't want you to talk to her
      at all that way. Don't you know she wouldn't? She couldn't.
      Now, really, no good woman would, would she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Duer flushed angrily. Good heaven! Were such innocent,
      simple things as this to be made the subject of comment and
      criticism! Was his life, because of his sudden, infatuated
      marriage, to be pulled down to a level he had never
      previously even contemplated? Why--why-- This catechising,
      so new to his life, so different to anything he had ever
      endured in his youth or since, was certain to irritate him
      greatly, to be a constant thorn in his flesh. It cut him to
      the core. He got up, putting Marjorie away from him, for
      they were sitting in a big chair before the fire, and
      walked to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see that at all," he said stubbornly. "I don't see
      anything in that remark to raise a row about. Why, for
      goodness' sake! I have known Charlotte Russell--for years
      and years, it seems, although it has only been a little
      while at that. She's like a sister to me. I like her. She
      doesn't mind what I say. I'd stake my life she never
      thought anything about it. No one would who likes me as
      well as she does. Why do you pitch on that to make a fuss
      about, for heaven's sake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't swear, Duer," exclaimed Marjorie anxiously,
      using this expression for criticising him further. "It
      isn't nice in you, and it doesn't sound right toward me.
      I'm your wife. It doesn't make any difference how long
      you've known her; I don't think it's nice to talk to her in
      that way, particularly in my presence. You say you've known
      her so well and you like her so much. Very well. But don't
      you think you ought to consider me a little, now that I'm
      your wife? Don't you think that you oughtn't to want to do
      anything like that any more, even if you have known her so
      well--don't you think? You're married now, and it doesn't
      look right to others, whatever you think of me. It can't
      look right to her, if she's as nice as you say she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Duer listened to this semipleading, semichastising harangue
      with disturbed, opposed, and irritated ears. Certainly,
      there was some truth in what she said; but wasn't it an
      awfully small thing to raise a row about?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should she quarrel with him for that? Couldn't he ever
      be lightsome in his form of address any more? It was true
      that it did sound a little rough, now that he thought of
      it. Perhaps it wasn't exactly the thing to say in her
      presence, but Charlotte didn't mind. They had known each
      other much too long. She hadn't noticed it one way or the
      other; and here was Marjorie charging him with being vulgar
      and inconsiderate, and Charlotte with being not the right
      sort of girl, and practically vulgar, also, on account of
      it. It was too much. It was too narrow, too conventional.
      He wasn't going to tolerate anything like that permanently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to say something mean in reply, make some
      cutting commentary, when Marjorie came over to him. She saw
      that she had lashed him and Charlotte and his generally
      easy attitude pretty thoroughly, and that he was becoming
      angry. Perhaps, because of his sensitiveness, he would
      avoid this sort of thing in the future. Anyhow, now that
      she had lived with him four months, she was beginning to
      understand him better, to see the quality of his moods, the
      strength of his passions, the nature of his weaknesses, how
      quickly he responded to the blandishments of pretended
      sorrow, joy, affection, or distress. She thought she could
      reform him at her leisure. She saw that he looked upon her
      in his superior way as a little girl--largely because of
      the size of her body. He seemed to think that, because she
      was little, she must be weak, whereas she knew that she had
      the use and the advantage of a wisdom, a tactfulness and a
      subtlety of which he did not even dream. Compared to her,
      he was not nearly as wise as he thought, at least in
      matters relating to the affections. Hence, any appeal to
      his sympathies, his strength, almost invariably produced a
      reaction from any antagonistic mood in which she might have
      placed him. She saw him now as a mother might see a great,
      overgrown, sulking boy, needing only to be coaxed to be
      brought out of a very unsatisfactory condition, and she
      decided to bring him out of it. For a short period in her
      life she had taught children in school, and knew the
      incipient moods of the race very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Duer," she coaxed, "you're not really going to be
      angry with me, are you? You're not going to be 'mad to
      me'?" (imitating childish language).
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't bother, Marjorie," he replied distantly. "It's
      all right. No; I'm not angry. Only let's not talk about it
      any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are angry, though, Duer," she wheedled, slipping her
      arm around him. "Please don't be mad to me. I'm sorry now.
      I talk too much. I get mad. I know I oughtn't. Please don't
      be mad at me, honey-bun. I'll get over this after a while.
      I'll do better. Please, I will. Please don't be mad, will
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not stand this coaxing very long. Just as he
      thought, he did look upon her as a child, and this pathetic
      baby-talk was irresistible. He smiled grimly after a while.
      She was so little. He ought to endure her idiosyncrasies of
      temperament. Besides, he had never treated her right. He
      had not been faithful to his engagement-vows. If she only
      knew how bad he really was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Marjorie slipped her arm through his and stood leaning
      against him. She loved this tall, slender
      distinguished-looking youth, and she wanted to take care of
      him. She thought that she was doing this now, when she
      called attention to his faults. Some day, by her persistent
      efforts maybe, he would overcome these silly, disagreeable,
      offensive traits. He would overcome being undignified; he
      would see that he needed to show her more consideration
      than he now seemed to think he did. He would learn that he
      was married. He would become a quiet, reserved, forceful
      man, weary of the silly women who were buzzing round him
      solely because he was a musician and talented and
      good-looking, and then he would be truly great. She knew
      what they wanted, these nasty women--they would like to
      have him for themselves. Well, they wouldn't get him. And
      they needn't think they would. She had him. He had married
      her. And she was going to keep him. They could just buzz
      all they pleased, but they wouldn't get him. So there!
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been other spats following this--one relating to
      Duer not having told his friends of his marriage for some
      little time afterward, an oversight which in his easy going
      bohemian brain augured no deep planted seed of disloyalty,
      but just a careless, indifferent way of doing things,
      whereas in hers it flowered as one of the most unpardonable
      things imaginable! Imagine any one in the Middle West doing
      anything like that--any one with a sound, sane conception
      of the responsibilities and duties of marriage, its
      inviolable character! For Marjorie, having come to this
      estate by means of a hardly won victory, was anxious lest
      any germ of inattentiveness, lack of consideration, alien
      interest, or affection flourish and become a raging disease
      which would imperil or destroy the conditions on which her
      happiness was based. After every encounter with Miss Ayres,
      for instance, whom she suspected of being one of his former
      flames, a girl who might have become his wife, there were
      fresh charges to be made. She didn't invite Marjorie to sit
      down sufficiently quickly when she called at her studio,
      was one complaint; she didn't offer her a cup of tea at the
      hour she called another afternoon, though it was quite time
      for it. She didn't invite her to sing or play on another
      occasion, though there were others there who were invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I gave her one good shot, though," said Marjorie, one day,
      to Duer, in narrating her troubles. "She's always talking
      about her artistic friends. I as good as asked her why she
      didn't marry, if she is so much sought after."
    </p>
    <p>
      Duer did not understand the mental sword-thrusts involved
      in these feminine bickerings. He was likely to be deceived
      by the airy geniality which sometimes accompanied the
      bitterest feeling. He could stand by listening to a
      conversation between Marjorie and Miss Ayres, or Marjorie
      and any one else whom she did not like, and miss all the
      subtle stabs and cutting insinuations which were exchanged,
      and of which Marjorie was so thoroughly capable. He did not
      blame her for fighting for herself if she thought she was
      being injured, but he did object to her creating fresh
      occasions, and this, he saw, she was quite capable of
      doing. She was constantly looking for new opportunities to
      fight with Mildred Ayres and Miss Russell or any one else
      whom she thought he truly liked, whereas with those in whom
      he could not possibly be interested she was genial (and
      even affectionate) enough. But Duer also thought that
      Mildred might be better engaged than in creating fresh
      difficulties. Truly, he had thought better of her. It
      seemed a sad commentary on the nature of friendship between
      men and women, and he was sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, nevertheless, Marjorie found a few people whom she
      felt to be of her own kind. M. Bland, who had sponsored
      Duer's first piano recital a few months before, invited
      Duer and Marjorie to a--for them--quite sumptuous dinner at
      the Plaza, where they met Sydney Borg, the musical critic
      of an evening paper; Melville Ogden Morris, curator of the
      Museum of Fine Arts, and his wife; Joseph Newcorn, one of
      the wealthy sponsors of the opera and its geniuses, and
      Mrs. Newcorn. Neither Duer nor Marjorie had ever seen a
      private dining-room set in so scintillating a manner. It
      fairly glittered with S&egrave;vres and Venetian tinted glass. The
      wine-goblets were seven in number, set in an ascending row.
      The order of food was complete from Russian caviare to
      dessert, black coffee, nuts, liqueurs, and cigars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation wandered its intense intellectual way from
      American musicians and singers, European painters and
      sculptors, discoveries of ancient pottery in the isles of
      the &AElig;gean, to the manufacture of fine glass on Long Island,
      the character of certain collectors and collections of
      paintings in America, and the present state of the Fine
      Arts Museum. Duer listened eagerly, for, as yet, he was a
      little uncertain himself of his position in the art world.
      He did not quite know how to take these fine and able
      personages who seemed so powerful in the world's affairs.
      Joseph Newcorn, as M. Bland calmly indicated to him, must
      be worth in the neighborhood of fifteen million dollars. He
      thought nothing, so he said, of paying ten, fifteen,
      twenty, thirty thousand dollars for a picture if it
      appealed to him. Mr. Morris was a graduate of Harvard,
      formerly curator of a Western museum, the leader of one of
      the excavating expeditions to Melos in the Grecian
      Archipelago. Sydney Borg was a student of musical history,
      who appeared to have a wide knowledge of art tendencies
      here and abroad, but who, nevertheless, wrote musical
      criticisms for a living. He was a little man of Norse
      extraction on his father's side, but, as he laughingly
      admitted, born and raised in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. He
      liked Duer for his simple acknowledgment of the fact that
      he came from a small town in the Middle West, and a drug
      business out in Illinois.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's curious how our nation brings able men from the
      ranks," he said to Duer. "It's one of the great, joyous,
      hopeful facts about this country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Duer; "that's why I like it so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Duer thought, as he dined here, how strange America was,
      with its mixture of races, its unexpected sources of
      talent, its tremendous wealth and confidence. His own
      beginning, so very humble at first, so very promising
      now--one of the most talked of pianists of his day--was in
      its way an illustration of its resources in so far as
      talent was concerned. Mr. Newcorn, who had once been a
      tailor, so he was told, and his wife was another case in
      point. They were such solid, unemotional, practical-looking
      people, and yet he could see that this solid looking man
      whom some musicians might possibly have sneered at for his
      self-complacency and curiously accented English, was as
      wise and sane and keen and kindly as any one present,
      perhaps more so, and as wise in matters musical. The only
      difference between him and the average American was that he
      was exceptionally practical and not given to nervous
      enthusiasm. Marjorie liked him, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this particular dinner that the thought occurred
      to Marjorie that the real merit of the art and musical
      world was not so much in the noisy studio palaver which she
      heard at so many places frequented by Duer, in times past
      at least--Charlotte Russell's, Mildred Ayres's and
      elsewhere--but in the solid commercial achievements of such
      men as Joseph Newcorn, Georges Bland, Melville Ogden
      Morris, and Sydney Borg. She liked the laconic "Yes, yes,"
      of Mr. Newcorn, when anything was said that suited him
      particularly well, and his "I haf seen dat bardicular
      berformance" with which he interrupted several times when
      Grand Opera and its stars were up for consideration. She
      was thinking if only a man like that would take an interest
      in Duer, how much better it would be for him than all the
      enthusiasm of these silly noisy studio personalities. She
      was glad to see also that, intellectually, Duer could hold
      his own with any and all of these people. He was as much at
      ease here with Mr. Morris, talking about Greek excavations,
      as he was with Mr. Borg, discussing American musical
      conditions. She could not make out much what it was all
      about, but, of course, it must be very important if these
      men discussed it. Duer was not sure as yet whether any one
      knew much more about life than he did. He suspected not,
      but it might be that some of these eminent curators, art
      critics, bankers, and managers like M. Bland, had a much
      wider insight into practical affairs. Practical affairs--he
      thought. If he only knew something about money! Somehow,
      though, his mind could not grasp how money was made. It
      seemed so easy for some people, but for him a grim, dark
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this dinner it was that Marjorie began to feel that
      Duer ought to be especially careful with whom he
      associated. She had talked with Mrs. Newcorn and Mrs.
      Morris, and found them simple, natural people like herself.
      They were not puffed up with vanity and self-esteem, as
      were those other men and women to whom Duer had thus far
      introduced her. As compared to Charlotte Russell and
      Mildred Ayres or her own mother and sisters and her Western
      friends, they were more like the latter. Mrs. Newcorn,
      wealthy as she was, spoke of her two sons and three
      daughters as any good-natured, solicitous mother would. One
      of her sons was at Harvard, the other at Yale. She asked
      Marjorie to come and see her some time, and gave her her
      address. Mrs. Morris was more cultured apparently, more
      given to books and art; but even she was interested in
      what, to Marjorie, were the more important or, at least,
      more necessary things, the things on which all art and
      culture primarily based themselves--the commonplace and
      necessary details of the home. Cooking, housekeeping,
      shopping, sewing, were not beneath her consideration, as
      indeed they were not below Mrs. Newcorn's. The former spoke
      of having to go and look for a new spring bonnet in the
      morning, and how difficult it was to find the time. Once
      when the men were getting especially excited about European
      and American artistic standards, Marjorie asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you very much interested in art, Mrs. Morris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so very much, to tell you the truth, Mrs. Wilde. Oh, I
      like some pictures, and I hear most of the important
      recitals each season, but, as I often tell my husband, when
      you have one baby two years old and another of five and
      another of seven, it takes considerable time to attend to
      the art of raising them. I let him do the art for the
      family, and I take care of the home."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was sincere consolation for Marjorie. Up to this time
      she appeared to be in danger of being swamped by this
      artistic storm which she had encountered. Her arts of
      cooking, sewing, housekeeping, appeared as nothing in this
      vast palaver about music, painting, sculpture, books and
      the like. She knew nothing, as she had most painfully
      discovered recently, of Strauss, Dvor&aacute;k, Debussy, almost as
      little of C&eacute;zanne, Goguin, Matisse, Van Gogh, Rodin, Ibsen,
      Shaw and Maeterlinck, with whom the studios were apparently
      greatly concerned. And when people talked of singers,
      musicians, artists, sculptors, and playwrights, often she
      was compelled to keep silent, whereas Duer could stand with
      his elbow on some mantel or piano and discuss by the half
      hour or hour individuals of whom she had never
      heard--Verlaine, Tchaikowsky, Tolstoy, Turgenieff, Tagore,
      Dostoyevsky, Whistler, Velasquez--anybody and everybody who
      appeared to interest the studio element. It was positively
      frightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      A phase of this truth was that because of his desire to
      talk, his pleasure in meeting people, his joy in hearing of
      new things, his sense of the dramatic, Duer could catch
      quickly and retain vigorously anything which related to
      social, artistic, or intellectual development. He had no
      idea of what a full-orbed, radiant, receptive thing his
      mind was. He only knew that life, things,
      intellect--anything and everything--gave him joy when he
      was privileged to look into them, whereas Marjorie was not
      so keenly minded artistically, and he gave as freely as he
      received. In this whirl of discussion, this lofty
      transcendentalism, Marjorie was all but lost; but she clung
      tenaciously to the hope that, somehow, affection, regard
      for the material needs of her husband, the care of his
      clothes, the preparation of his meals, the serving of him
      quite as would a faithful slave, would bind him to her. At
      once and quickly, she hated and feared these artistically
      arrayed, artistically minded, vampirish-looking maidens and
      women who appeared from this quarter and that to talk to
      Duer, all of whom apparently had known him quite well in
      the past--since he had come to New York. When she would see
      him standing or leaning somewhere, intent on the rendering
      of a song, the narration of some dramatic incident, the
      description of some book or picture, or personage, by this
      or that delicately chiseled Lorelei of the art or music or
      dramatic world, her heart contracted ominously and a
      nameless dread seized her. Somehow, these creatures,
      however intent they might be on their work, or however
      indifferent actually to the artistic charms of her husband,
      seemed to be intent on taking him from her. She saw how
      easily and naturally he smiled, how very much at home he
      seemed to be in their company, how surely he gravitated to
      the type of girl who was beautifully and artistically
      dressed, who had ravishing eyes, fascinating hair, a
      sylphlike figure, and vivacity of manner--or how naturally
      they gravitated to him. In the rush of conversation and the
      exchange of greetings he was apt to forget her, to stroll
      about by himself engaging in conversation first with one
      and then another, while she stood or sat somewhere gazing
      nervously or regretfully on, unable to hold her own in the
      cross-fire of conversation, unable to retain the interest
      of most of the selfish, lovesick, sensation-seeking girls
      and men.
    </p>
    <p>
      They always began talking about the opera, or the play, or
      the latest sensation in society, or some new singer or
      dancer or poet, and Marjorie, being new to this atmosphere
      and knowing so little of it, was compelled to confess that
      she did not know. It chagrined, dazed, and frightened her
      for a time. She longed to be able to grasp quickly and
      learn what this was all about. She wondered where she had
      been living--how--to have missed all this. Why, goodness
      gracious, these things were enough to wreck her married
      life! Duer would think so poorly of her--how could he help
      it? She watched these girls and women talking to him, and
      by turns, while imitating them as best she could, became
      envious, fearful, regretful, angry; charging, first,
      herself with unfitness; next, Duer with neglect; next,
      these people with insincerity, immorality, vanity; and
      lastly, the whole world and life with a conspiracy to cheat
      her out of what was rightfully her own. Why wouldn't these
      people be nice to her? Why didn't they give of their time
      and patience to make her comfortable and at home--as
      freely, say, as they did to him? Wasn't she his wife, now?
      Why did Duer neglect her? Why did they hang on his words in
      their eager, seductive, alluring way? She hated them and,
      at moments, she hated him, only to be struck by a
      terrifying wave of remorse and fear a moment later. What if
      he should grow tired of her? What if his love should
      change? He had seemed so enamored of her only a little
      while before they were married, so taken by what he called
      her naturalness, grace, simplicity and emotional pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one of these occasions, or rather after it, when they
      had returned from an evening at Francis Hatton's at which
      she felt that she had been neglected, she threw herself
      disconsolately into Duer's arms and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter with me, Duer? Why am I so dull--so
      uninteresting--so worthless?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of her voice was pathetic, helpless, vibrant with
      the quality of an unuttered sob, a quality which had
      appealed to him intensely long before they were married,
      and now he stirred nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what's the matter with you now, Margie?" he asked
      sympathetically, sure that a new storm of some sort was
      coming. "What's come over you? There's nothing the matter
      with you. Why do you ask? Who's been saying there is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing, nothing--nobody! Everybody! Everything!"
      exclaimed Marjorie dramatically, and bursting into tears.
      "I see how it is. I see what is the matter with me. Oh! Oh!
      It's because I don't know anything, I suppose. It's because
      I'm not fit to associate with you. It's because I haven't
      had the training that some people have had. It's because
      I'm dull! Oh! Oh!" and a torrent of heart-breaking sobs
      which shook her frame from head to toe followed the
      outburst and declamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duer, always moved by her innate emotional force and charm,
      whatever other lack he had reason to bewail, gazed before
      him in startled sympathy, astonishment, pain, wonder, for
      he was seeing very clearly and keenly in these echoing
      sounds what the trouble was. She was feeling neglected,
      outclassed, unconsidered, helpless; and because it was more
      or less true it was frightening and wounding her. She was,
      for the first time no doubt, beginning to feel the tragedy
      of life, its uncertainty, its pathos and injury, as he so
      often had. Hitherto her home, her relatives and friends had
      more or less protected her from that, for she had come from
      a happy home, but now she was out and away from all that
      and had only him. Of course she had been neglected. He
      remembered that now. It was partly his fault, partly the
      fault of surrounding conditions. But what could he do about
      it? What say? People had conditions fixed for them in this
      world by their own ability. Perhaps he should not have
      married her at all, but how should he comfort her in this
      crisis? How say something that would ease her soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Margie," he said seriously, "you know that's not
      true! You know you're not dull. Your manners and your taste
      and your style are as good as those of anybody. Who has
      hinted that they aren't? What has come over you? Who has
      been saying anything to you? Have I done anything? If so,
      I'm sorry!" He had a guilty consciousness of
      misrepresenting himself and his point of view even while
      saying this, but kindness, generosity, affection, her legal
      right to his affection, as he now thought, demanded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! No!" she exclaimed brokenly and without ceasing her
      tears. "It isn't you. It isn't anybody. It's me--just me!
      That's what's the matter with me. I'm dull; I'm not
      stylish; I'm not attractive. I don't know anything about
      music or books or people or anything. I sit and listen, but
      I don't know what to say. People talk to you--they hang on
      your words--but they haven't anything to say to me. They
      can't talk to me, and I can't talk to them. It's because I
      don't know anything--because I haven't anything to say! Oh
      dear! Oh dear!" and she beat her thin, artistic little
      hands on the shoulders of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duer could not endure this storm without an upwelling of
      pity for her. He cuddled her close in his arms, extremely
      sad that she should be compelled to suffer so. What should
      he do? What could he do? He could see how it was. She was
      hurt; she was neglected. He neglected her when among
      others. These smart women whom he knew and liked to talk
      with neglected her. They couldn't see in her what he could.
      Wasn't life pathetic? They didn't know how sweet she was,
      how faithful, how glad she was to work for him. That really
      didn't make any difference in the art world, he knew, but
      still it almost seemed as if it ought to. There one must be
      clever, he knew that--everybody knew it. And Marjorie was
      not clever--at least, not in their way. She couldn't play
      or sing or paint or talk brilliantly, as they could. She
      did not really know what the world of music, art, and
      literature was doing. She was only good, faithful,
      excellent as a housewife, a fine mender of clothes, a
      careful buyer, saving, considerate, dependable, but--
    </p>
    <p>
      As he thought of this and then of this upwelling depth of
      emotion of hers, a thing quite moving to him always, he
      realized, or thought he did, that no woman that he had ever
      known had anything quite like this. He had known many women
      intimately. He had associated with Charlotte and Mildred
      and Neva Badger and Volida Blackstone, and quite a number
      of interesting, attractive young women whom he had met here
      and there since, but outside of the stage--that art of
      Sarah Bernhardt and Clara Morris and some of the more
      talented English actresses of these later days--he
      persuaded himself that he had never seen any one quite like
      Marjorie. This powerful upwelling of emotion which she was
      now exhibiting and which was so distinctive of her, was not
      to be found elsewhere, he thought. He had felt it keenly
      the first days he had visited her at her father's home in
      Avondale. Oh, those days with her in Avondale! How
      wonderful they were! Those delicious nights! Flowers,
      moonlight, odors, came back--the green fields, the open
      sky. Yes; she was powerful emotionally. She was compounded
      of many and all of these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true she knew nothing of art, nothing of music--the
      great, new music--nothing of books in the eclectic sense,
      but she had real, sweet, deep, sad, stirring emotion, the
      most appealing thing he knew. It might not be as great as
      that exhibited by some of the masters of the stage, or the
      great composers--he was not quite sure, so critical is
      life--but nevertheless it was effective, dramatic,
      powerful. Where did she get it? No really common soul could
      have it. Here must be something of the loneliness of the
      prairies, the sad patience of the rocks and fields, the
      lonesomeness of the hush of the countryside at night, the
      aimless, monotonous, pathetic chirping of the crickets. Her
      father following down a furrow in the twilight behind
      straining, toil-worn horses; her brothers binding wheat in
      the July sun; the sadness of furrow scents and field
      fragrances in the twilight--there was something of all
      these things in her sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appealed to him, as it might well have to any artist. In
      his way Duer understood this, felt it keenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Margie," he insisted, "you mustn't talk like that!
      You're better than you say you are. You say you don't know
      anything about books or art or music. Why, that isn't all.
      There are things, many things, which are deeper than those
      things. Emotion is a great thing in itself, dearest, if you
      only knew. You have that. Sarah Bernhardt had it; Clara
      Morris had it, but who else? In 'La Dame aux Camelias,'
      'Sapho,' 'Carmen,' 'Mademoiselle de Maupin,' it is written
      about, but it is never commonplace. It's great. I'd rather
      have your deep upwelling of emotion than all those cheap
      pictures, songs, and talk put together. For, sweet, don't
      you know"--and he cuddled her more closely--"great art is
      based on great emotion. There is really no great art
      without it. I know that best of all, being a musician. You
      may not have the power to express yourself in music or
      books or pictures--you play charmingly enough for me--but
      you have the thing on which these things are based; you
      have the power to feel them. Don't worry over yourself,
      dear. I see that, and I know what you are, whether any one
      else does or not. Don't worry over me. I have to be nice to
      these people. I like them in their way, but I love you. I
      married you--isn't that proof enough? What more do you
      want? Don't you understand, little Margie? Don't you see?
      Now aren't you going to cheer up and be happy? You have me.
      Ain't I enough, sweetie? Can't you be happy with just me?
      What more do you want? Just tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing more, honey-bun!" she went on sobbing and cuddling
      close; "nothing more, if I can have you. Just you! That's
      all I want--you, you, you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hugged him tight. Duer sighed secretly. He really did
      not believe all he said, but what of it? What else could he
      do, say, he asked himself? He was married to her. In his
      way, he loved her--or at least sympathized with her
      intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And am I emotionally great?" she cuddled and cooed, after
      she had held him tight for a few moments. "Doesn't it make
      any difference whether I know anything much about music or
      books or art? I do know something, don't I, honey? I'm not
      wholly ignorant, am I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, sweetie; how you talk!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will you always love me whether I know anything or
      not, honey-bun?" she went on. "And won't it make any
      difference whether I can just cook and sew and do the
      marketing and keep house for you? And will you like me
      because I'm just pretty and not smart? I am a little
      pretty, ain't I, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're lovely," whispered Duer soothingly. "You're
      beautiful. Listen to me, sweet. I want to tell you
      something. Stop crying now, and dry your eyes, and I'll
      tell you something nice. Do you remember how we stood, one
      night, at the end of your father's field there near the
      barn-gate and saw him coming down the path, singing to
      himself, driving that team of big gray horses, his big
      straw hat on the back of his head and his sleeves rolled up
      above his elbows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Marjorie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember how the air smelled of roses and
      honeysuckle and cut hay--and oh, all those lovely scents of
      evening that we have out there in the country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied Marjorie interestedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you remember how lovely I said the cowbells sounded
      tinkling in the pasture where the little river ran?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the fireflies beginning to flash in the trees?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that sad, deep red in the West, where the sun had gone
      down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I remember," said Marjorie, crushing her cheek to his
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now listen to me, honey: That water running over the
      bright stones in that little river; the grass spreading
      out, soft and green, over the slope; the cow-bells
      tinkling; the smoke curling up from your mother's chimney;
      your father looking like a patriarch out of Bible days
      coming home--all the soft sounds, all the sweet odors, all
      the carolling of birds--where do you suppose all that is
      now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," replied Marjorie, anticipating something
      complimentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's here," he replied easily, drawing her close and
      petting her. "It's done up in one little body here in my
      arms. Your voice, your hair, your eyes, your pretty body,
      your emotional moods--where do you suppose they come from?
      Nature has a chemistry all her own. She's like a druggist
      sometimes, compounding things. She takes a little of the
      beauty of the sunset, of the sky, of the fields, of the
      water, of the flowers, of dreams and aspirations and
      simplicity and patience, and she makes a girl. And some
      parents somewhere have her, and then they name her
      'Marjorie' and then they raise her nicely and innocently,
      and then a bold, bad man like Duer comes along and takes
      her, and then she cries because she thinks he doesn't see
      anything in her. Now, isn't that funny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O-oh!" exclaimed Marjorie, melted by the fire of his
      feeling for beauty, the quaintness and sweetness of his
      diction, the subtlety of his compliment, the manner in
      which he coaxed her patiently out of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I love you, Duer dear! I love you, love you, love you!
      Oh, you're wonderful! You won't ever stop loving me, will
      you, dearest? You'll always be true to me, won't you, Duer?
      You'll never leave me, will you? I'll always be your little
      Margie, won't I? Oh, dear, I'm so happy!" and she hugged
      him closer and closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," and "Yes, yes," assured Duer, as the occasion
      demanded, as he stared patiently into the fire. This was
      not real passion to him, not real love in any sense, or at
      least he did not feel that it was. He was too skeptical of
      himself, his life and love, however much he might
      sympathize with and be drawn to her. He was questioning
      himself at this very time as to what it was that caused him
      to talk so. Was it sympathy, love of beauty, power of
      poetic expression, delicacy of sentiment?--certainly
      nothing more. Wasn't it this that was already causing him
      to be hailed as a great musician? He believed so. Could he
      honestly say that he loved Marjorie? No, he was sure that
      he couldn't, now that he had her and realized her defects,
      as well as his own--his own principally. No; he liked her,
      sympathized with her, felt sorry for her. That ability of
      his to paint a picture in notes and musical phrases, to
      extract the last ringing delicacy out of the keys of a
      piano, was at the bottom of this last description. To
      Marjorie, for the moment, it might seem real enough, but
      he--he was thinking of the truth of the picture she had
      painted of herself. It was all <i>so--</i>every word she
      said. She was not really suited to these people. She did
      not understand them; she never would. He would always be
      soothing and coaxing, and she would always be crying and
      worrying.

    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      When William Walton, of Colonial prestige, left his
      father's house, St George's Square, New York, in the spring
      of 1801, it was to spend a day of social activity, which,
      in the light of his ordinary commercial duties, might be
      termed idleness. There were, among other things, a luncheon
      at the Livingstone Kortright's, a stroll with one Mlle.
      Cruger to the Lispenard Meadows, and a visit in the evening
      to the only recently inaugurated Apollo Theater, where were
      organized the first permanent company of players ever
      transported to America. Under the circumstances, he had no
      time for counting-house duties, and had accordingly decided
      to make a day of it, putting the whole matter of commerce
      over until such time as he could labor uninterrupted, which
      was to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came out of the door over which was a diamond-pane
      lunette for a transom, he was a striking example of the new
      order of things which had come with the Declaration of
      Independence and the victory of the colonies over the
      British. Long trousers of light twilled cloth encased his
      legs, and were fastened under his shoes by straps. A
      flower-ornamented pink waistcoat and light blue dress coat
      of broadcloth, shared with brass buttons, yellow gloves,
      and an exceedingly narrow-brimmed silk hat, in giving his
      appearance that touch of completeness which the fashion of
      the day demanded. In the face of those of the older order,
      who still maintained the custom of wearing knee breeches
      and solemn, black waistcoats, he was a little apt to appear
      the exaggerated dandy; but, nevertheless, it was good form.
      My Madame Kortright would expect it at any luncheon of
      hers, and the common people knew it to be the all-desirable
      whenever wealth permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In lower Pearl Street, below Wall, which direction he took
      to reach the Bowling Green and the waterfront, he
      encountered a number of the fashionable, so far as the
      commercial world was concerned, who were anything but idle
      like himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Master Walton, are you neglecting business so early
      in the morning?" inquired Robert Goelet, whose
      iron-mongering business was then the most important in the
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For this day only," returned Walton, smiling agreeably at
      the thought of a pleasant day to come. "Several engagements
      make it unavoidable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to the Collect, then, possibly?" returned
      Goelet, looking in the direction of the old water
      reservoir, where all of the city's drinking supply was
      stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the other, "I had not thought of it. What is
      there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some one, I understand, who has a boat he wishes to try.
      It is said to go without sail. I should think one with as
      many ships upon the water as you have would have heard of
      any such invention as that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes," answered young Walton, "I have heard of men who
      are going to sail in the air, also. I will believe that a
      vessel can go without sail when I see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the other, "I do not know. These inventors are
      strange adventurers, at best, but there might be no harm in
      looking at it. I think I shall go myself later."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I should also like to see it," said the other,
      "providing I have time. When is it to sail, do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About eleven," answered Goelet. "The <i>Post</i> tells of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many thanks for the information," returned the other, and,
      with a few commonplaces as to ships expected and the news
      from France, they betook their separate ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the many fine yards which spread before the old
      mansions below Wall Street, he beheld John Adams, the
      newly-elected President of the States, busy among his
      flowers. The elder statesman bowed gravely to the younger
      gentleman and returned to his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fine gentleman," thought the latter, "and well worthy to
      be the chief of this good government."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he neared the Bowling Green, he observed that there was
      no one of the many residents about taking advantage of the
      pleasant sunlight to enjoy an hour at that favorite
      pastime, and so continued his way to the Astor docks
      adjoining the Whitehall slip, where never yet had the
      commercial New Yorker, interested in the matter of
      shipping, failed to find a crowd. Messrs. John Jacob Astor
      and William Van Rensalaer were already upon the ground, as
      he could see at a distance, the distinct high hat of the
      one and the portly figure of the other standing out in
      clear relief against the green waters of the bay. Elder
      Johannis Coop was there, he of the vast ship chandlery
      business, and Opdyke Stewart, importer of the finest stuffs
      woven in Holland. Old Jacob Cruger and Mortimer Morris, the
      lean Van Tassel and Julius van Brunt, merchants all and
      famous men of the city, chatted, smiled, and laughed
      together as they discussed the probabilities of trade and
      the arrival of the <i>Silver Spray</i> and the <i>Laughing
      Mary</i>, both in the service between New York and
      Liverpool. Almost every worthy present was armed with his
      spy-glass, as the three-foot telescopes were then called,
      and now and then one would take a look down the bay and
      through the distant narrows to see if any sign of a
      familiar sail were present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how is Master Walton?" asked the elder Astor,
      recognizing the scion of the one exceedingly wealthy family
      of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, thank you," returned the other, surveying the
      company, whose knee breeches and black coats presented a
      striking contrast to his modern trousers and fancy jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These modern fashions," exclaimed Cruger, the elder,
      coming forward, "make us old fellows seem entirely out of
      date. They are a wretched contrivance to hide the legs. If
      I were a young woman I would have no man whose form I could
      not judge by his clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I were a young man," put in the jovial John Jacob,
      "I would put on no clothes which a young woman did not
      approve of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, well," said the other, smiling, "these fashions are
      strange contrivances. Not ten years since a man would have
      been drummed out of New York had he appeared in such finery
      as this, and now, by heaven, it is we old fellows who are
      like to be shown the door for dressing as our fathers
      taught us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so bad as that, surely," said Walton. "Full dress
      commands the old style yet at evening. This is but daylight
      custom. But how about the Bowling Green; is no one to play
      there this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not when two ships like the <i>Silver Spray</i> and the
      <i>Laughing Mary</i> are like to show their noses at any
      moment," observed Cruger stoutly. "I have fifty barrels of
      good India ale on the <i>Silver Spray.</i> Astor, here, has
      most of the hold of the <i>Laughing Mary</i> filled with
      his dress goods. No bowling when stocks must be unpacked
      quickly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a weary watch, this, for these dogged vessels,"
      added Astor reflectively. "There is no good counting wind
      or wave. The Spaniard, too, is not dead yet, worse luck to
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw that about the <i>Polly</i>," said young Walton
      interestedly. "Perhaps the government will wake up now to
      our situation. The Spaniard can wipe our vessels off the
      seas and hide behind the piracy idea. We need more war
      vessels and that quickly, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, too," said Astor. "But we are like to have them
      now. Only to-day Congress voted to buy more land across the
      East River there," and he waved his spy-glass in the
      direction of the green outlines of Long Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that reminds me," said Walton, pulling out his
      timepiece by the fob attached to it; "I but now met Goelet,
      who says there is to be a boat tried at the Collect which
      goes without sail. It is to be run by steam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed Cruger, have no time for such nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard of it," remarked Astor. "Possibly there is
      something to it. There could be no harm in going to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going," said Walton, "and by-the-bye, it is high time
      I was on my way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you have no objection I go with you," said Astor,
      who was seriously interested to know if there was anything
      to this idea or not. Others hearing this joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus secured companionship, young Walton proceeded
      up the Whitehall slip to the Bowling Green, whence, with
      his friends, he now turned into the Broadway, and so out
      past the fine residences and occasional stores of that new
      thoroughfare to the old White residence, where later was to
      be White Street, and thence eastward, across the open
      common, to the Collect, where is now the Tombs. Quite a
      formidable company of sightseers had gathered, the
      aristocracy, gentry, and common rabble forming in separate
      groups. A very plain and homely looking individual of the
      older school, clad in swallowtail and knee breeches, was
      there with a contrivance large enough to sustain his own
      weight in the water, which he was endeavoring with a
      wrench, a hammer, and an oil can to put in final shape for
      the very important experiment of traveling without sail.
      Naturally he had the undivided and even pushing and prying
      attention of all present.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the citizens thus gazed, awaiting in comfortable
      idleness for something of the marvelous to happen, there
      came a clattering sound along the east road toward the
      city, where suddenly appeared the outlines of Van Huicken's
      water wagon, a great hogshead on wheels, which, by its
      rumbling haste, suggested fire. Close after followed the
      Almerich, another vehicle of the same kind, which secured
      its name from its owner. Both drivers hailed the crowd
      while yet a distance off with shouts of "Fire!" and then
      from distant Fulton Street were heard the sounds of a bell
      tolling out the same intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody now wavered uncertainly between the possibility
      of witnessing a marvelous invention and the certainty of
      seeing a splendid conflagration, with the result that
      certainty triumphed. Instantly upon learning the nature of
      the fire, both commonry and gentry departed, leaving Astor
      and Walton, with their associates, gazing at the tinkering
      wonder-worker alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That must be near the President's house," observed Walton,
      who was looking toward the city. "It may spread."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This fellow will get nothing out of his machine to-day, I
      fear," returned Astor, moved by the thought of a dangerous
      and yet interesting fire as he gazed rather unfavorably
      upon the quiet inventor, who had not remained unaware of
      this public defection. "Let us go back."
    </p>
    <p>
      With somewhat more of eagerness than was conformable with
      their general stately bearing, this rather important local
      company now took up the trail of the water wagons and
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In William Street, just off the Old Boston Road and near
      the newly-named Liberty Street, were many signs of public
      excitement. The fine residence of the Athorps, recently
      leased by the French minister, had taken fire, and was
      rapidly burning. Although nine of the fourteen water-pumps
      of the city were upon the scene of action, and eight men
      were toiling at each handle, little progress was making.
      Bucket brigades were also in operation, the volunteer
      citizens drawing upon every well in the neighborhood for
      blocks about; but to small result. The flames gained apace.
      Men ran looking for Goiter's water conveyance, which had
      not yet been pressed into action, and Huicken's Broadway
      sprinkler, which, however, had already been sent to the
      Collect for more water. There was a deal of clatter and
      confusion, coupled with the absolute certainty of
      destruction, for no pumping could throw the water beyond
      the second story. More than once the tank supply, as
      rattled forward from the Collect and the East River, was
      totally suspended, while the flames gained new ground. This
      latter was due to the badness of the roads and the
      inadequacy of the help at the supply end, where, since all
      thought to gaze upon the fire, none were remaining to help
      the lone Huicken or the energetic Goiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this last company of volunteer fire fighters arrived,
      with their buckets and other contrivances for fighting a
      blaze, the flames had gained such headway that there was
      little to be done. Walton wasted half an hour discussing
      fire protection, and then bethought himself of his luncheon
      engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be out of this," he said to Astor, as they stood
      gazing upon the flames and the surging throng. "I am late
      as it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      The genial forefather scarcely heard him at all. So
      interested was he that his own luncheon mattered not at
      all. Quietly Walton withdrew then, and getting back into
      Boston Road and the Broadway, betook himself toward the
      Bowling Green and Madame Kortright's.
    </p>
    <p>
      That lady's mansion was to the west of the old playground,
      looking out over lawn and lane to some space of water to be
      seen in the East River and a boat or two at anchor in the
      bay. As he tapped upon the broad door with its brazen
      knocker, a liveried servant opened to him, bowing
      profoundly in greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will Master Walton give me his hat and gloves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Master Walton," remarked the hostess, who now entered
      smiling. "I had almost doubted your punctuality, though you
      have good reason. Whose house is it burning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Count Rennay's," answered Walton, mentioning the French
      representative to our government.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have sent a servant to discover it for me, but he has
      not yet returned. It must have fascinated him also. We must
      sit to lunch at once, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the hostess said this, she turned about in her great
      hoops, now but recently, like long trousers, come into
      fashion, and led the way. Her hair was done in the curls of
      the post-revolution period, three at each side, about the
      ears, and a tall chignon that was almost a curl in itself.
      With stately grace she led the way to the dining chamber
      and bowed him to his place. Eulalia, a daughter, and
      Sophia, a friend, entered almost at the same moment with
      them through another door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the long, oaken table there were already
      standing the two black table servants of this dignified
      household, splendid imported Africans, trained in Virginia.
      My lady's table was a-gleam with much of the richest plate
      and old Holland china in the city. An immense silver
      candelabra graced the center, and at every corner were
      separate graven gold sticks making a splendid show.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the greatest terror of fire anywhere in our city,"
      began the hostess, even as young Walton was bowing. "We
      have so little protection. I have urged upon our selectmen
      the necessity of providing something better than we have--a
      water tower or something of the sort but so far nothing has
      come of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were at the fire, Master Walton?" inquired the
      handsome Eulalie archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came that way with several friends from the Collect," he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the Collect?" asked the hostess, who was now seated
      with the two blacks towering above her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a man there who has a boat which is to go without
      sail, as I understand it, providing his idea is correct. It
      is to go by steam, I believe, only he did not succeed in
      making it so do to-day, at least not while I was there. It
      may have gone, though. I could not wait to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh marvelous," exclaimed Eulalie, putting up a pair of
      pretty hands, "and really is it a boat that will travel
      so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot vouch for that," returned the youth gravely. "It
      was not going when we visited it. The fire and my
      engagement took the entire audience of the inventor away,"
      and he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have no faith in any such trap as that until I see
      it," observed Madame Kortright. "Fancy being on the water
      and no sail to waft you. Mercy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy it will be some time before men will venture afar
      on any such craft," returned the youth; "but it is a bit
      curious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dangerous, I should say," suggested Mistress Sophia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Walton, "not that, I think. My father has often
      told me that Master Franklin predicted to him that men
      should harness the lightning before many years. That is
      even more strange than this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may all be true," said Madame Kortright, but it has
      not come to pass yet. It will never be in our time, I fear.
      But did you hear of the case of jewels at Maton's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he imported something new?" inquired Eulalie smartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last ship brought a case of gems for him, I hear,"
      continued the hostess. "That should be of interest to you,
      Master Walton."
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth flushed slightly at the implication involved. His
      attentions to Mistress Beppie Cruger were becoming a
      subject of pleasing social comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is," he said gaily, as he recovered his composure.
      "I shall look in upon Maton this very afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I should like to see what is new in France," said the
      ruddy Sophia seriously. "I have not an earring or a pin in
      my collection that is not as old as the hills--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor any the less valuable, I venture," answered Walton,
      with an impressive air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would give them for new ones, believe me," returned the
      girl quaintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this gossiping company the two blacks waited with
      almost noiseless accuracy, one serving at each side in
      answer to silent looks and nods from the hostess. Walton
      watched them out of the corner of his eye, gossiping the
      while. In his new home, he thought, whenever the fair lady
      consented, there should be two such lackeys gracing her
      more tender beauty. He could not help thinking how much
      more effective they would appear behind her than his
      present hostess, who, however, was attractive enough. It
      made him restless to depart, for certainly this afternoon
      he should definitely, if he could, learn his fate. The
      jewels would be one excuse. He would take her to look at
      the jewels before the evening called them to the theater,
      and then he would see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he was free of the entertainment provided, he hurried
      away into Wall Street, the spire of Trinity already
      beginning to cast a short eastward shadow. About the
      building occupied as the new National Capitol a few
      dignitaries from the colonies were to be seen. The new
      mixture of stores among the residences was beginning to
      make lovely Wall Street less conservative. A bank had
      opened just below the Capitol, its entrance reaching out to
      the very sidewalk and hedging in the view of the gardens
      beyond. Soon, if the city kept on growing, all the fine old
      gardens would have to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered, as he walked, until he came to a certain
      gateway below William Street, where he entered. From a
      window looking out upon a small balcony above a face
      disappeared, and now he was greeted by another pompous
      servant at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My compliments," he said, "to Mistress Cruger, if she
      pleases, and I am waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant bowed and retired. In a few moments more there
      fluttered down into the large reception room from above the
      loveliest embodiment of the new order of finery that he had
      ever seen. Such daintiness in curls and laces, such
      lightness in silken flounces displayed upon spreading
      hoops, he felt to be without equal. With a graceful
      courtesy she received his almost ponderous bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother gives you her greeting, and she cannot come with us
      to-day," she said. "She has a very severe headache."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry to hear that," he replied sympathetically,
      "but you will come? The weather has favored us, and I fancy
      the meadows will be beautiful to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I will come," she returned smiling. "It is not
      quite three, however," she added. "You are early."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," he answered, "but we may talk until then. Besides
      there is something I wish you to see before theater
      time--no, I will tell you of it later. Henry will be on
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      They seated themselves very respectfully distant and took
      up the morning's commonplaces. Had he heard of the fire and
      where the French minister was now being entertained? Cards
      had but this morning come from the Jacob Van Dams for a
      reception at their new house in Broome Street. The Goelets
      were to build farther out in Pearl Street
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it is a shame," she said, "the way they are
      deserting us in this street. We shall have to go also very
      shortly, and I like Wall Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When your turn comes perhaps you will not mind it so
      much," he returned, thinking of the proposal he hoped to
      find the courage to make. "Broome Street is certainly
      pleasing after the new style."
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought of all the fine residences being erected in
      that new residence section, and for some, to him,
      inexplicable reason, smiled. Outside, through the
      vine-festooned window, she could see a broad, open barouche
      turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is the carriage," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they came out of the quiet chamber into the open
      sunlight, part of their stilted reserve vanished. Once in
      the carriage beside him, she smiled happily. As they rolled
      into William Street and up the Old Boston Road into the
      green shaded Bowery, she laughed for the very joy of
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is good to feel spring again," she said, "the cold days
      are so many."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they traveled, an occasional citizen before his doorway,
      or pleasure seeker upon horseback, greeted them. The
      distinguished Aaron Burr was here prancing gaily
      countryward. Old Peter Stuyvesant's mansion was kept as
      rich in flowers as when he had been alive to care for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are not the fields beautiful about here?" he observed,
      after they had passed the region of the Collect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lovely," she returned. "I never see them but I think of
      dancing, they are so soft."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us get out and walk upon them, anyhow," he answered.
      "Henry can wait for us at the turn yonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pointing to a far point, where, through a dump of
      trees, the winding footpath, leading out from here, joined
      Broadway, now a lane through the woods and fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaily she acquiesced, and he helped her down. When the
      servant was out of hearing, he reached for a dandelion, and
      pressing his lips to it said, "Here is a token."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what?" she said shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What should it be?" he asked wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spring, probably."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And nothing else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Youth," she answered, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And nothing else?" he questioned, drawing close with a
      tenderness in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How should I know?" she said, laughing and casting it
      down, because of her fear of the usual significance of the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't throw it away," he said stooping. "Keep it.
      I'll tell you what it means. I--I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See the wild roses!" she exclaimed, suddenly increasing
      her pace. "I should rather have some of those for a token,
      if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      He relaxed his tension, and hastened for that which she
      desired. When he returned to hand them to her, she was
      laughing at something.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you laugh," he said sadly. "I think I know why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is because of the day," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow he could make no progress with his declaration
      until it was too late. Already they were near the carriage,
      and south along the road a quarter of a mile was the
      Lispenard country house. Her relatives, the Lispenards,
      were there as owners. He scarcely had time for what he
      wished to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we stop there?" he asked in a subdued murmur, as in
      driving again they neared the long piazza where guests were
      seated enjoying the prospect of the meadows beyond. "It is
      four now, and the play begins at six. There are some new
      jewels from France at Maton's, which I thought you might
      like to see before then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jewels from France! Oh, yes, I should like to see those.
      Let us go there," she answered. "But I must have time to
      dress, too, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the guests then, bowing as they passed, they returned a
      smiling nod, and meeting others in carriages and chairs,
      extended this same courtesy as they went along. Walton
      brooded in a mock-dreary manner, but finding that it
      availed nothing thought to tempt her considerateness with
      jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What trinkets are these you have from France of which I
      hear?" he inquired of Maton as they entered that sturdy
      jeweler's shop in Maiden Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the very last packet," explained the latter, spreading
      the best of his importations upon a black velvet cloth
      before them. "You will not see the like of these six
      diamonds in New York again for many years, I warrant you.
      Look at this."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held up an exquisitely wrought ring of French
      workmanship, in which a fine stone was gleaming, and smiled
      upon it approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look," he said, "it is very large. It is cut by Toussard.
      Did you ever see such workmanship?" He turned it over and
      over, and then held it lovingly up. "The band itself is so
      small," he added, "that I believe it would fit the lady's
      finger--let us see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Coquettishly she put out her hand, and then seeing that it
      marvelously slipped on and fitted, opened her eyes wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, is not that beautiful!" exclaimed the jeweler. "What
      a gem! The finest of any that I have imported yet, and it
      fits as though it had been ordered for her." He cast a
      persuasive smile upon Walton whose interest in the fair
      Beppie he well knew. The latter pretended not the slightest
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well cut," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the loveliest you have ever worn," added Walton
      hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      By her side, in front of the counter and between their
      bodies, he was endeavoring to take her free hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let it stay," he said gently, when he had secured it, and
      was signalling the significance of the ring to her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," she said, smiling as if she were only jesting, "you
      are too daring. I might!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a ring!" said the jeweler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will then," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, Master Maton," said Walton, "you need only send the
      bill to me," and he laughed as he pushed the remaining
      display away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they came out, after having vaguely picked over the
      others, the young lover was all elation. Upon the narrow
      side-path a servant wheeling a trunk to the Liverpool dock
      upon a barrow brushed him rudely, but he did not notice.
      Only a newsboy crying out the <i>Gazette,</i> the blast of
      the bugle of the incoming stage coach from Boston, the dust
      of the side-path, where the helper of the Apollo was
      sweeping the lobby preparatory to the performance of the
      night, attracted and pleased him. He helped his fianc&eacute;e
      gaily into the carriage and half bounded with joy to the
      seat beside her, where he smiled and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may not wear it, though,<sup>"</sup> said his betrothed,
      now that the remarkable episode was over, and she held up a
      dainty finger; "because, as you know, you have not spoken
      to my father as yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep it, nevertheless," he answered. "I will speak to him
      fast enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you good-day, Master Walton," said the
      distinguished Jefferson as they passed from William into
      Wall Street, near where that statesman made temporary
      stopping-place when in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master Jefferson, William," cried his fianc&eacute;e softly,
      using for the first time his given name. "Master Jefferson
      has bid you good-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening!" cried Walton, all deference in a moment
      because of the error which his excitement had occasioned,
      "good evening to you, sir!" and he bowed, and bowed very
      gracefully again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I be so mindful, though, of all these
      formalities," he said explanatorily as he turned once more
      to his fair intended, "when I have you? It is not to be
      expected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But necessary, just the same," she said. "And if you are
      to begin thus quickly neglecting your duties, what am I to
      think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer he took her hand. Elatedly then they made their
      way to the old homestead again, and there being compelled
      to leave her while she dressed for the theater, he made his
      way toward the broad and tree-shaded Bowery, where was the
      only true and idyllic walk for a lover. The older houses
      nearest the city, redolent in their Dutch architecture of
      an older and even quainter period; the wide paths and broad
      doorways, rich in both vines and flowers; the rapidly
      decreasing evidences of population as one's steps led
      northward--all combined to soothe and set dreaming the
      poetic mind. Here young Walton, as so many before him,
      strolled and hummed, thinking of all that life and the
      young city held for him. Now, indeed, was his fortune truly
      made. Love was his, the lovely Beppie, no less. Here then
      he decided to build that mansion of his own--far out,
      indeed, above Broome Street, but in this self-same
      thoroughfare where all was so suggestive of flowers and
      romance. He had no inkling, as he pondered, of what a
      century might bring forth. The crush and stress and
      wretchedness fast treading upon this path of loveliness he
      could not see.
