<h3>NEW SERIAL STORY FOR "THE ADVERTISER" </h3>

<p class="first"><i>The new serial story by Arthur Gask, the
Adelaide author, which will begin in "The Advertiser" next week,
is entitled "The House on the Island," and concerns the exploits
of Gilbert Larose a member of the New South Wales detective
force, while doing exchange duty at Scotland Yard. Readers of
"The Advertiser" are already familiar with Larose, who was the
central figure in the fascinating story by the same author, "The
Shadow of Larose," which appeared in these columns a few months
ago.</i></p>

<p><i>In the previous tale Larose conducted his operations in
South Australia. In the new story the setting is a lonely island
off a stretch of the Essex coast; unnumbered narrow creeks up
which the tides surge like carrion beasts ravening for their
prey, and long wastes of marshland with their girdles of black
mud&mdash;the fitting home and hiding place of crime. For many
months a band of criminals had been harrying the English
countryside, defying all efforts of the authorities to uncover
them. Then Larose arrived in England and speedily got upon their
trail. </i></p>

<p><i>It is a thrilling story of mystery and adventure, featuring Gilbert Larose at his best.</i></p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; THE JUNGLE OF CRIME.</h2>

<p class="first">THE Chief Commissioner of Police was sitting in
his pleasant room in Scotland Yard overlooking the Thames
Embankment, but he looked anything but pleasant himself. Instead,
he was scowling angrily as he perused the newspaper in his
hands.</p>

<p>"Listen to this, Carter," he exclaimed scornfully to a tall
spare man about forty years of age, who was gazing meditatively
out of the window, "for downright nonsense it's hard to beat." He
read slowly so that his subordinate could take in every word.</p>

<p>"Now we want a word with Scotland Yard, and it is time for
some plain speaking. We pay our rates and taxes and we are
supposed thereby to be living under the protection of the
authorities whose salaries and expenses we provide. That is what
we imagine, but in reality it would seem that we are living in no
security at all. From all that is happening around us we may any
day, any hour, any one of us, be among the victims of dark crime.
The long arm of the law has ceased to function, and life and
property are now apparently the playthings of any miscreant who
comes along. For six months the towns and country-side of the
Eastern Counties have been terrorised by a bandit who robs and
kills upon the slightest provocation. Upon eleven separate
occasions since January last we have had to record his deeds of
crime. He has attacked banks and private dwelling places and his
successes have been as monotonous as have been the failures of
the police to apprehend him. Now,&mdash;we have a right to ask
and we intend to press home our question,&mdash;who is this man
who hovers like a baleful shadow over the land, what are his
resources that he can ride every time through the cordon that
surrounds him, and who are his confederates that they can baffle
all attempts at their uncovering? We repeat, we have a right to
ask, and we add, too, that we have a right to receive a reply.
Can it be possible that no answer will be forthcoming, and it
will be openly admitted that in this fair land of ours there be
jungles of crime from which ferocious beasts of prey may stalk
unchallenged, that they may foul their maws in blood and
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Commissioner tossed the newspaper contemptuously on to his
desk.</p>

<p>"Bah!" he sneered, "the idiots! Do they imagine then that we
keep a private zoo or can turn Crime off with a tap when they
become insistent?"</p>

<p>"I think, Sir," sighed his lanky companion. "I
think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've no business to think, Carter," snapped the
Commissioner, "it's not laid down in the police regulations.
You've&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door and a constable entered and
handed a letter to the Commissioner.</p>

<p>"Bearer waiting, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"All right," said the Commissioner sharply. "I'll attend to it
in a minute," and the constable went out.</p>

<p>"But it is unfortunate, sir," frowned the tall man, "and I
don't call to mind when we've been so beaten before. I've put in
a solid five weeks now on it myself and yet I cannot say that
I've struck anything worth mentioning at all. They just come and
go and we just clear up after them," he smiled humorously, "like
the housemaids when there's been a party overnight."</p>

<p>"But five murders!" ejaculated the Commissioner. "And the
three counties from Norwich to Romford like an armed camp. It's
incredible that we can't find out anything."</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute and then the Commissioner,
shrugging his shoulders, picked up and opened the letter on his
desk.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "from the C.I.D. people in Sydney about
the man they've sent over in exchange for our Thomson, for a
year." He read down the letter and then he elevated his eyebrows
and looked up with a smile.</p>

<p>"Now, Carter," he said drily, "we've got it at last. They've
sent over the very man we need. Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>The tall man sniffed audibly and looked out of the window
again.</p>

<p>"The bush-man," he remarked without interest, "the chap that
trails them through the desert sand." He screwed up his eyes.
"Then I suppose you'll work him at Margate or Southend, sir?"</p>

<p>The Commissioner laughed. "Don't be jealous, Carter. It's no
sin that the poor man isn't as clever as you.
Still&mdash;&mdash;" And his face took on a serious look. "Still,
the fellow's supposed to be quite a genius in his work. Major
Boyne told me, in this very room last year, that there never had
been such a tracker of crime before. Why, it's proverbial in
Australia that Larose can reason back as quickly as he can reason
forward, and they say that when a murder's been committed, no
matter how long after, he can still see the very shadow that the
murderer cast upon the wall." The Commissioner's eyes twinkled.
"But, mind you, I don't vouch for that as a fact. I only just
mention it as indicating the hold that Larose's successes have
given him upon the minds of the people in the Commonwealth." He
shook his head. "And, mind you again, Carter, they're a tough,
hard-bitten lot over there, and in the wide and uncramped spaces
among which they live they have more scope for the play of the
instinct than we have over here."</p>

<p>Elias Carter did not seem much impressed.</p>

<p>"Then try him out, sir," he said grimly. "We shall soon see."
And he resumed his contemplative meditation through the
window.</p>

<p>"And he's a mighty master of disguise, too," went on the
Commissioner. "We shall learn a lot from him there. They say he
can so alter his appearance by just moving the muscles of his
face that his best friends fail to recognise him, even when
within a few feet." He touched the bell upon his desk.</p>

<p>"Find out," he said, when the constable appeared, "if Mr.
Stone is in the Yard, and, if so, tell him I shall be obliged if
he will come here at once."</p>

<p>The man retired, and then Carter took out his watch.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he said, "I think I'll be going if you have
nothing more for me."</p>

<p>"Oh! but I have," exclaimed the Commissioner. "I want you, of
course, to meet this Larose. You and Stone, too. You're two of
the stars over here, and it would be ungracious not to introduce
you to a brother star. Sit down, man, until we are all here."</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later, and an alert-looking man entered
the room. He was big and stout, with the real bulldog type of
face, and he looked very sure of himself, as if he were always
confident and afraid of nothing in the world.</p>

<p>The Commissioner explained the situation.</p>

<p>"I've heard of him," boomed the big, stout man, who answered
to the name of Stone. "The best pistol-shot in Australia, they
say." He grinned. "He can have a shot at Carter here, sir, with
your permission, and if he's not too particular."</p>

<p>"But be polite to him," smiled the Commissioner as he put his
finger on the bell, "for I expect he'll be a bit nervous when he
knows who you both are."</p>

<p>A minute later, and a boyish-looking man was ushered in. He
was of medium height and appeared to be in the late twenties. He
had a happy, smiling face, and it seemed just now that he was
amused.</p>

<p>With a quick glance he took in the little group before him,
and then he stepped straight forward to the Commissioner and took
the proffered hand which the latter at once held out to him.</p>

<p>"Oh! then you know me," smiled the Commissioner, "and
probably, then, these gentlemen, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Larose. "They are two of the Big
Four&mdash;Mr. Stone and Mr. Carter."</p>

<p>"Goodness, gracious!" exclaimed the surprised Commissioner.
"Then I suppose you've got all the rest of the Rogues' Gallery at
your fingers' ends. But how on earth do you come to have us all
so pat?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied the young man modestly, "I was hanging about
outside the Yard for a few minutes one day last week, with a
friend of mine, and he pointed out to me all the celebrities," he
smiled happily, "and I don't often forget a face."</p>

<p>There was a thoughtful smile all round, and then Larose, after
having shaken hands with the two detectives, was invited to sit
down. The detectives eyed him with amused and friendly good
humor.</p>

<p>"So, so," said the Commissioner; "then, if you were
sightseeing last week, you must have been over here a little
time. I was thinking you had only come by the mail boat that
arrived yesterday."</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Larose; "I've been in England a fortnight
now. It was part of my holiday, and I was told I needn't report
until to-day."</p>

<p>"Well," smiled the Commissioner, "and what do you think of
England? Had any adventures yet?"</p>

<p>The detective from Australia laughed. "I had my pocket picked,
sir&mdash;if you would call that one."</p>

<p>The Commissioner looked sympathetic. "Now, that's real bad
luck," he said. "I hope you didn't lose much."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, he didn't get away with anything.
I got back what he had snatched. I saw what he was intending to
do, and was ready for him."</p>

<p>"And you gave him in charge?" said the Commissioner.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," exclaimed Larose as if rather surprised. "I took him
to dinner with me and since then we've been about quite a lot
together." He looked rather sheepish. "You see, sir, it was such
an opportunity for me to learn from the opposite camp how you
gentlemen here work, for I was able to go into places I could not
have got into in any other way; indeed, my light-fingered friend
would never have trusted me as he did, if I had not been able to
convince him positively by my passport that I was from the
Commonwealth, and had only just arrived." Larose sighed. "He
believed I was in the same profession as himself, and he
introduced me to a relative of his, whom I understand to be a
most reliable fence."</p>

<p>"And I suppose," commented the Commissioner with a grin, "that
this gentleman then was the friend who pointed us all out to you
outside the Yard?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Larose, "and he seemed to know everyone. He
had nicknames, too, for most of you."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the burly Stone, highly amused, "and did he
call me 'Smike'?"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Larose, "and Mr. Carter, 'Smudge.'" They all
joined in the general laughter, and then the Commissioner
asked&mdash;-</p>

<p>"And from what you've read," he bowed and smiled, "and from
what you've seen, how do you think crime here compares with crime
in Australia? Very much the same kind of stuff, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Yes, much the same, sir, except that the team-work here is more dangerous, and appears to be much more
difficult to uncover. The high-class gangsters with us are nearly
all importations, and we get news of their coming and so are able
to keep an eye on them from the first moment when they disembark.
Besides, they haven't the same facilities for moving about that
they have here. Now take this present trouble you are having in
the eastern counties, for instance. It seems&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" interrupted the Commissioner, "then you are interested
in our little local affairs, are you? You have heard of the Iron
Man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Larose, smiling. "We got plenty of details
over in Australia, and besides&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated a
moment, "I spent my first two days here going through the
newspaper files. The problem is most interesting."</p>

<p>"Too interesting," sighed the Commissioner sadly. He tapped
the newspaper on his desk. "The public are thirsting for our
blood."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, may I ask," said Larose respectfully, "have you
any information that is not known outside?"</p>

<p>The Commissioner regarded him very thoughtfully, as if he were
weighing him up.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Larose," he said after a moment, "I'll be quite frank
with you, as you are going to be one of us. We have found out
nothing at all, absolutely nothing, and if you have read the
newspapers, then&mdash;&mdash;" he sighed again, "you are quite
as well informed as we are, in every respect. This man is quite
unknown to us. He and his associates rob and kill, and
then&mdash;&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders, "they just vanish
away as if they had never been. But listen," he went on, "and
I'll state the exact position from out point of view, and then
perhaps you'll appreciate the difficulty we are in." He settled
himself back in his chair and spoke impressively. "Now these men,
we are sure, constitute a highly organised band, and are men of
courage and resource. They are apparently led by an individual
whom the public shudder delightedly to call 'The Iron Man.' He is
known as that, because upon three occasions one of the band, and
the one undoubtedly directing operations, has been seen with his
face masked in a covering of the color of rusty iron. Now, these
men specialise in holding up lonely country houses. They have
robbed two branch banks certainly, but in all the other instances
it has been houses standing in their own grounds that have
received their attentions. Lonely houses, I say, and in the
eastern counties they could not possibly have chosen a better
field for their operations, for in Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk we
have hundreds of old-world villages with each one giving shelter
in its vicinity to one or more park-like estates in the
possession of people of means. Well, these wretches strike like
lightning, hold up a house at any hour of the night, abstract all
the valuables they are after, proceed to instant violence if they
meet with any opposition&mdash;they have five murders to their
credit&mdash;and then immediately decamp without leaving a trace
of their identity behind. Sometimes, twice, they have burgled a
mansion without the occupants being aware of anything unusual
until they have got up the next morning. But in all cases it has
been the same. A lightning stroke and a lightning disappearance,
and not a clue to be picked up anywhere. And they strike in all
directions, too, as you have read. East Dereham, and North
Walsham, in Norfolk, Wickham Market and Debenham, in Suffolk, and
seven times in different places in Essex." The Commissioner
thumped his first upon the desk. "And do our utmost, we can light
on nothing that can help us to uncover their trail. For many
weeks now it has not been a matter of the country constabulary
only; it has been raised to the importance of a general call, and
the best talent we have in the Yard and the most astute brains in
the kingdom have been called into requisition to find out who
they are. Yes, who are these men, we ask ourselves; how do they
get away, and where is the lair in which they hide?"</p>

<p>The Commissioner spread out his hands. "It is not as if we
were not prepared. It is not as if we were now caught unawares.
We act every night now as if we were expecting another raid, and
between dusk and dawn you could not cross any main arterial road
in the three counties without being challenged and having to give
an account of yourself. We can't think how they manage to get
away, for from the widely separated places where they have
operated they must some nights have travelled long distances to
get under cover when their foul work is done." The Commissioner
sighed for the third time. "It is most perplexing."</p>

<p>Larose spoke very quietly. "I notice, Sir," he said
hesitatingly, "I notice that now they seem to be working further
south and are avoiding any places near the big towns."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Commissioner grimly, "and you want to see
the houses that have been raided lately to realise how easy it
was to isolate them from immediate help. One snip at the
telephone wires and the victims were prevented from getting in
touch with our men for the best part of an hour." He raised his
voice angrily. "And the devilish part is, the wretches always
appear to have everything so well prepared. They know when there
is anything worth taking, they apparently have got the plans of
every house that they enter, and they go straight to their mark
with the least delay possible." He frowned at Larose. "But you
shall be taken to one or two of the places and then you will see
the difficulties we have to meet." He smiled sadly. "It will be
an education for you."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, and then Larose gave a slight
cough.</p>

<p>"But I've seen some of them already, Sir," he said; he
hesitated, "in fact I've visited them all except one. At Thorpe
Court the gates were chained and the lodge-keeper was very rude
and refused to let me in."</p>

<p>All eyes were turned instantly upon the speaker and the
Commissioner sat bolt upright in his chair.</p>

<p>"You've been to see them!" he exclaimed. "When? What for?"</p>

<p>The Australian detective got rather red. "Well, sir," he said
slowly, "it was like this. I was most interested in the matter
for it was a problem after my own heart. I had a week to spare,
and so I thought I couldn't do better than make a few
investigations and see the English countryside at the same
time."</p>

<p>A moment's frown and then the Commissioner looked with some
amusement at his subordinates.</p>

<p>"Our friend is a live wire, gentlemen," he said smilingly,
"and if we don't look out, he'll beat us on our ground."</p>

<p>The detectives smiled, too, and then the meditative Carter
asked drily.</p>

<p>"And did you find out anything then, Mr. Larose, anything
worth noting?"</p>

<p>Gilbert Larose looked blandly at his interrogator.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he replied innocently, "one or two things struck
me, but, of course I hadn't the time to follow them up. I thought
I might do that later."</p>

<p>The Commissioner looked down his nose as if he were
amused.</p>

<p>"And what were they, Mr Larose?" he asked. "That is, of
course, if you don't mind us cross-examining you?" He flashed a
quick look at Elias Carter. "You may have picked up something
that has escaped us."</p>

<p>"Well," said Larose slowly. "I saw that three of those country
houses had been painted recently and that the chimney cowls on
two of them were new and of the same pattern."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the Commissioner, and then there was a puzzled
silence in the room.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Larose. "Laytham Hall, near Hadleigh, the Manor
House in Sudbury, and White Notley Towers have all had the
decorators in since Christmas, and when I enquired in the
villages, I found in all three cases that it was the same firm in
Colchester that had done the work, Smith and Rattery, of Wall-street." His voice became almost apologetic in its tones. "I was
thinking, therefore, that perhaps it might be one of their
workmen who had prepared the plans of these houses for the
burglaries. The coincidences struck me as peculiar, particularly
so, because the three houses I have mentioned are situated such a
long distance apart."</p>

<p>"Ah," again from the Commissioner and it seemed as if his
colleagues were now holding in their breaths.</p>

<p>"Then, another thing," said Larose, and he spoke softly and
almost as if he were meditating to himself, "in reading that
account of the raid at Witham Court where the dancers were held
up in the ballroom by the Iron Man, one of the guests told a
pressman afterwards that the robber, as he menaced them with his
pistol, stood very firmly on his feet. That means, of course,
that he stood with his legs rather wide apart, and it suggested
to me at once a man who has followed the sea. Seafaring men, I
have always noticed, are given to standing that way, no doubt to
accommodate themselves to the swaying of the ship. So my thoughts
were turned at once to boats and moving waters, and I saw then
that all the last seven raids had occurred at places within
reasonable distance of somewhere where easy access could be got
to the sea when the tides were high. There was always some river
or some creek not very far away. Then I found&mdash;&mdash;" and
here Larose smiled with the happiness of a boy. "I found that
they had all happened near the top of a flowing tide. I mean all
the raids had taken place when the tide was coming in up the
rivers and the inlets of the sea and was nearly at its highest
point. Never when the tide was low or had been going down for
some time. So I thought&mdash;&mdash;" he looked smilingly
around, "I thought that perhaps our criminal friends had got
their headquarters somewhere near some river bank or some
estuary, and that therefore whenever they had been operating
anywhere, they had afterwards made straight for some boat or
motor launch moored in some lonely spot, and, helped by the state
of the tide, had got down to the sea somewhere and had ultimately
reached home by water without having had to face the risks of
traversing any main patrolled roads." Larose shrugged his
shoulders. "At least, those were the ideas that came to me."</p>

<p>He stopped speaking, and a long silence followed. Elias Carter
had lost interest in what was going on outside the window, and
was sitting now with his eyes fixed intently upon Larose. The
burly Stone was frowning and staring hard at Larose, too, and the
Commissioner had got a look that was almost an angry one, upon
his face. He was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>"Give me down the special map of Essex, Mr. Carter," he said
brusquely, "and the book of the tides, too. They are both over
there on the shelf."</p>

<p>He spread out the map upon his desk, and then turned to
Larose.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," he said sharply, "kindly come over here," he
nodded to the other detectives, "and you gentlemen, too. We'll
soon see how this idea works out. It seems to me there may be
something in it."</p>

<p>They all bent over the map. It was a large ordnance one, a
mile to the inch and Larose saw it was marked in places with
circles and crosses in red ink. There was also some writing on
it, and what looked like notes and memoranda down the sides.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Larose," said the Commissioner grimly, "this
constitutes as far as Essex is concerned, the dossier of the Iron
Man's crimes. Those circles mark the places where he has made his
raids, and the figures in them show their sequence, the dates,
and, as far as we can determine with any accuracy, the exact hour
when in each case he appeared upon the scene." He spoke with
suppressed excitement. "Now, we'll test your theory. Witham Court
was the first house to be held up, and there, he killed as well
as robbed. He pistolled Colonel Holt, because he didn't at once
hold up his hands. A dastardly action, because the old man was
very deaf, and didn't hear the order given. Well, Witham Court,
first." He pointed with his pencil, and then ran it down the map.
"Collier's Reach on the River Blackwater, nearest water, and
about nine miles away Collier's Beach, two miles from town of
Maldon." He pointed again to the red circle. "Raid took place on
Thursday, March 13, at 10.45 p.m. Now for the state of the tide."
He turned quickly over the pages of the book of 'Tides.' "J. K.
O. M.&mdash;here we are Maldon. Now for the date,&mdash;March
11th. 12th. 13th. March 13th.&mdash;High water, 11.50 p.m. Now
for the raid number two. Sir Joseph Webster's place near Bures
Green, on April 3. River Stour probably the take-off here, and
Seafield Creek the nearest spot, about sixteen miles away. The
town of Manningtree, three miles from Seafield Creek. Raid at Sir
Joseph's, in the middle of the night at 2.30 a.m." He consulted
the Tide Book. "High water at half-past four. Now for the raid
number three. Great Baddon Manor House this time. April 26 the
date. Clement's Green creek on River Crouch, nearest water
about&mdash;say nine miles away. Raid at 9 p.m. exactly, when the
servants were having supper, and high water at Burnham-on-Crouch
at 10.25."</p>

<p>And then, one by one, the Commissioner ticked off his circles
with comments and references to the Tide Book until they were all
done, and then he drew a long breath and sighed heavily. He leant
back in his chair, and, turning round his head, stared
thoughtfully out of the window, as if his only interest in life
now were the majestic waters of the Thames. A hushed stillness
followed, to be broken presently, however, by a gruff chuckle
from the detective, Stone.</p>

<p>"A bull's-eye, sir," he exclaimed to the Commissioner; "in
fact two of them, I believe." He smiled humorously at Larose.
"This young fellow is a credit to the little place where he was
born."</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner awoke abruptly from his reverie, and,
for the moment, frowned as if he were annoyed in some way; then,
he, too, smiled, and in a gracious movement inclined his head
towards Larose.</p>

<p>"Excellent, Mr. Larose," he said. "You've given us something
to think over, and both your ideas shall be followed up. At any
rate, now we don't seem to be at quite such a dead-end. What do
you say, Mr. Carter? You've been on the business, as you reminded
me a few minutes ago, exclusively for over five weeks, and you
ought to know."</p>

<p>The solemn-looking Carter spoke very deliberately. "Mr. Larose
is a thinker, sir," he said, "and he's seen things, too, that we
have overlooked. I shall be glad to have him help if you'll put
him with me."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will," replied the Commissioner, "and he shall
start at once."</p>

<p>Elias Carter went on. "I don't want to make any excuses, sir,
but in fairness to myself and those who have worked under me, Mr.
Larose has had an advantage that we never had. He has seen all
the outrages as a complete whole, whereas we saw them one by one,
and did not consequently get the same clear perspective that he
did."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so," said Larose quickly. "The ideas would have
never come to me if I hadn't, so to speak, seen the places all at
once." He shook his head doubtfully. "Besides, I may be quite
wrong."</p>

<p>"No, lad, I don't think you are," said Carter grimly. "It
strikes me you're darned right."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Commissioner, briskly, "you know every inch
of Essex, Mr. Carter. Now, whereabouts do you think they ran
to?"</p>

<p>"Know every inch of Essex!" growled Carter. "Fifteen hundred
and thirty square miles, with a hundred miles and more of
coastline with more creeks, too, than there are days of the year;
creeks of unexplored mud and slime. You know every inch of
Essex!"</p>

<p>"Well," laughed the Commissioner, "you soon ought to. You and
Mr. Larose can quickly cover a lot of ground with the energy
you've both got."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Carter gravely, "if there's anything in what
our friend has suggested, we are faced with a very big problem to
trail these men, for some of the spots you have mentioned as the
likely places where they took to the water are a mighty distance
apart. Seafield Bay, on the River Stow, opposite Manningtree, for
instance, is separated from Benfield Creek below Leigh-on-sea by
at least eighty miles of water frontage, eighty miles of river-bank and coast, and every mile, almost, indented with little
muddy creeks that run up into the land until they peter out, a
day's tramp away, in some dirty little ditch. These men, if they
have their hiding-place in some creek, as Mr. Larose thinks, and
as I now am inclined to think, too, have a comparatively speaking
easy job to run to cover after each raid. They can drift down
some river or creek as the tide ebbs and then make at leisure for
their den, hours after when the tide is flowing in again." He
shook his head. "No, the first clue we must follow is that of the
man in the employ of the decorating firm. We must uncover him if
possible, and through him, get to the others. At least that's
what I think."</p>

<p>The Commissioner looked thoughtful. "But how do we imagine,"
he asked, "they get to the water after each raid? What is your
idea, Mr. Larose?"</p>

<p>"Push bikes, perhaps," answered Larose, "or in some very
ordinary and inconspicuous way. A high-powered motor car would be
the last thing that I should think they would use. Probably they
separate, too, and go singly by different ways."</p>

<p>The telephone on the Commissioner's desk tinkled suddenly, and
he picked it up. His face darkened instantly, and he flashed a
look round on the others in the room.</p>

<p>"Another one!" he exclaimed hoarsely, with the receiver still
to his ear. "Raid number twelve and in Essex, again."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said into the mouthpiece. "Great Oakley. The
private asylum belonging to Dr. Shillington. Good God! What a
place to choose!" There was silence for a minute, and he
pencilled quickly on his blotting pad. "Yes, we'll come straight
away. Now, listen, this is urgent. Send out a special call
instantly for every private launch or sailing boat coming from
seaward and passing Harwich, Brightlingsea, or up the Blackwater
or the Crouch, to be stopped and gone through, unless their
occupants are known locally. No, no&mdash;hold on a
minute&mdash;&mdash;" The Commissioner turned to the detectives
and spoke rapidly. "Now, is that wise? We may be too late this
time. The raid was made last night, they say, and a man was
murdered, but the news has only just come through. Now if we draw
blank, we shall spoil all future chances, for it will be found
out in which direction we are working, and it will put the
wretches on their guard. No, I'll alter that." He spoke into the
receiver again. "No, no stopping anyone, but pass the call for
any incoming launches to be secretly marked down and their
direction and probable destinations specially noted. Got that? No
launches or sailing boats to know that they have been watched.
All right, then, we'll be coming at once." He hung up the
receiver.</p>

<p>"More trouble, more trouble," he sighed, "and the public will
be getting their knives into us deeper than ever." His face
brightened, and he went on briskly&mdash;"But, at any rate, now,
we've got another chance, a typical outrage carried out in their
usual way. They raided Dr. Shillington's private asylum near
Great Oakley, it is believed late last night, murdering the
butler and getting away with some very valuable old silver. The
murder and burglary were only discovered this morning at half-past 8, and it was not until 9.15 that they got the news in
Colchester. Now where exactly is Great Oakley?" and he looked
down on the map.</p>

<p>"There it is," pointed Elias Carter promptly, "about two miles
from the coast and three miles south of the River Stour, and one
of the most Godforsaken places you could ever want. It's right
out of the world. I've been near the village, though, once when I
was on a holiday and I heard all about the asylum."</p>

<p>"And Shillington's our biggest mental specialist?" went on the
Commissioner. "I know him myself."</p>

<p>"And I do, too," said Stone drily. "An unpleasant man. I met
him in the Hawtrey case last year. He's a Harley-street
consultant, but the asylum belongs to him. It's a big place I
understand, and he's got 30 or 40 patients down there, and they
all pay through the nose. He only touches rich people."</p>

<p>The Commissioner rose to his feet. "Well, off you go, Mr.
Carter, at once, and I think as you know Dr. Shillington, you'd
better go, too, Mr. Stone, if you will." He turned to Larose.
"And you, of course, sir, you'll go as well. I'll assign you to
Mr. Carter, and you'll work with him." He smiled. "But I expect
he'll give you as free a hand as you may want, for he's a
reasonable man, and not half as foolish as you might imagine from
his appearance."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; DR. SHILLINGTON'S ASYLUM.</h2>

<p class="first">A FEW minutes later, and tightly wedged in
between the two English detectives, Larose found himself in a big
police car bowling along at a good pace through the London
streets. He certainly admired the dexterity with which the driver
threaded his way along the crowded thoroughfares, but at the same
time it was not without some feelings of trepidation that he
viewed the chances the man took in proceeding so rapidly upon his
way.</p>

<p>Presently the burly Stone, turning round, seemed to sense
something of what was passing in the Australian's mind.</p>

<p>"Good driver, this," he remarked carelessly, "he's not had an
accident now for a fortnight." He eyed Larose solemnly. "But as
ten days is about his average, we mustn't feel too aggrieved if
he has one now.</p>

<p>"No, of course not," agreed Larose, speaking in the same vein.
"Still, if anything does happen, we can crawl out from underneath
and take a tram. I understand the police ride free over here." He
smiled and added, "nice car, this."</p>

<p>"Nice car!" echoed Stone, as if surprised. "For sure it is, or
Carter and I wouldn't be riding in it. We're the brains of the
Yard, my lad,"&mdash;he winked his eye and spoke very
loudly&mdash;"or rather I am. Carter's not up to much. Too fond
of drink and women to be much good." He looked sternly at Larose.
"But, I say, young fellow, are you carrying a gun?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Larose, "a little Bayard."</p>

<p>"Got a licence?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"No-o," replied Larose, as if rather taken aback by the
question. "I thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind what you thought," cried Stone truculently, and he
leant across to his colleague. "Carter, do you hear? This young
man's carrying a gun without a licence. Should we turn back at
once and acquaint the Chief? Now, what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Give our minds to the business we are on," said the tall
detective sternly, "and stop fooling." He turned apologetically
to Larose. "This stout man, Mr. Larose, is not quite the
mountebank he would like you to believe, and somewhere in his
gross body, in his stomach I imagine it must be, he gives
shelter, as you may learn soon, to one of the acutest brains we
have in the Force. In some ways there's not a man in the Yard
that can touch him." He turned and spoke in matter-of-fact tones
to his colleague. "Now, Charlie, be serious and tell us about
this Dr. Shillington of yours."</p>

<p>Stone winked again at Larose and pretended to sigh before
replying.</p>

<p>"Well, Elias," he said casually, "this Shillington's rather a
big nob in the mad world, and he's written two of three books on
why people go potty and all that. He's got a very high-class
consulting practice, and attends half the aristocracy, the judges
and bishops and the clergy. He's about fifty years of age and has
been associated with mental work ever since he qualified, for his
father specialised in the same way before him. He's supposed to
be very rich, and to only run the asylum as a hobby. Personally,
he's a big, fine man like myself, but he's run more to fat than I
have because, I suppose, he's been better fed."</p>

<p>"He's a collector, then," said Carter, "if they came after his
old silver."</p>

<p>"Well, he's not collected anything off me," replied the
incorrigible Stone, "so I can't answer for that. At any rate I've
never had occasion to pay him any fees."</p>

<p>The big car ate up the miles at a tremendous pace, and with
the exhilaration of the keen air rushing on his face Gilbert
Larose began to enjoy himself thoroughly. He was, however,
thinking hard. He was now, he knew, in the company of two of the
greatest detectives of the old country, and he was about to
measure his capacity alongside with theirs. In his own country he
was quite aware he was esteemed a master, but how would he fare
now he wondered, with these men working on their own ground. At
any rate, he consoled himself, human passions were much the same
all the world over, and crime worked for its ends, in kindred
fashions under all skies.</p>

<p>Colchester was reached in not many minutes over the hour, and
then at the direction of Carter, the car turned out of the main
road and shot like a bullet down some narrow winding lanes.</p>

<p>"This is a short cut," he shouted, "and it'll save us a few
miles. Take note of the kind of country we are passing and some
idea may perhaps come to us as to in what way these men cross
through. We shall soon have water all around. You can smell the
sea now."</p>

<p>Without any appreciable slackening of pace they roared through
sleepy little villages, across wide stretches of green meadows
and over dreary wastes of flat marshlands. The tang of salt was
strong upon the air and soon they could hear the crash of distant
waves.</p>

<p>Carter stood up in the car. "That's Great Oakley," he said,
"over there, and Dr. Shillington's asylum is about a mile further
on. Oakley Court, it's called."</p>

<p>Three minutes later and a high forbidding-looking wall loomed
up before them, and skirting round it for some hundreds of yards,
the car was pulled up suddenly before two big iron gates.</p>

<p>The gates were inhospitably closed, but there was a lodge just
inside and apparently hearing the noise of the car a policeman
and another man immediately appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"We're from the Yard," Carter called out and at once the
policeman saluted and motioned to his companion to open the
gates.</p>

<p>"The Chief Constable's up at the house, sir," he said, as the
car drove in. "Bear round to the left," and the gates were
clanged to behind them.</p>

<p>A drive of about two hundred yards led up to the asylum and it
passed at first through a winding avenue of trees that blocked
all view of the buildings. Then the trees gave way to a long
vista of well trimmed lawns and ornamental flower beds, with a
big, rambling looking mansion in the background.</p>

<p>"That's the asylum," said Carter. "It was a nobleman's
residence once, and it's got over fifty rooms in it, they say.
Lord Roddam built it, and that ivy has been growing for more than
a hundred years. And there's the doctor's private
house&mdash;well away from the asylum you see, no doubt, so that
he shan't hear the shrieks." He nodded his head approvingly. "As
nice a little place as you could wish, and I bet he's got every
comfort there just as if he were up in town!"</p>

<p>The car drew up before the entrance of the house he had
pointed out, and the three detectives immediately alighted.</p>

<p>The big Stone nudged Larose's arm. "Sniff, you young
bloodhound," he whispered, "sniff," and although there was
jocularity in his mode of speech, there was certainly nothing of
humor in the steely eyes with which he regarded his young
companion.</p>

<p>The front door stood open, and upon seeing the detectives, a
tall, soldier-looking man immediately came down the steps.</p>

<p>"The Chief Constable of Essex," Stone whispered to Larose.
"Major Hartley&mdash;a V.C."</p>

<p>"You've been quick, gentlemen," said the Major; "I didn't
expect you for half an hour yet," and he shook hands with Carter
and Stone. Then his eyes wandered to Larose.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gilbert Larose," promptly announced Carter; "on exchange
from the Commonwealth of Australia. He's helping me."</p>

<p>The eyes of the Chief Constable narrowed, and he looked
curiously at Larose. Then he smiled kindly, and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Larose," he said. "I've heard of
you, of course," and he turned back at once to Carter. "Bad
business again," he went on quickly, "and as I expect you know,
there's been a kill. The butler's dead. They've got a haul of
valuable silver, and, as usual&mdash;&mdash;" he frowned and
shrugged his shoulders, "they got off unmolested."</p>

<p>"When did they come?" asked Carter sharply.</p>

<p>"No one knows," replied the Chief Constable. "Nothing was
discovered until the lodge-keeper saw the butler's body behind
some shrubs as he was coming up the drive with the letters this
morning. That was at 7.25, I am told. Then Dr. Shillington was
called, and it was found that the house had been burgled,
too."</p>

<p>"Telephone wires cut I suppose?" said Carter.</p>

<p>The Chief Constable smiled grimly. "Of course. One of the
asylum attendants bicycled down to the village and rang us up."
He shrugged his shoulders. "But I've not been here myself ten
minutes yet, and have only got just the heads of everything from
the doctor. I didn't start any formal investigation, knowing you
were on the way. I've sent a couple of my men, however, to go
round the wall to try and find out where they got over, so as not
to waste any time."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Carter, "then we'll go to the doctor at once.
He's here of course."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Chief Constable, "he's in his study. I've
just come from there. He's not a very good-tempered man. These
mental chaps seldom are."</p>

<p>"Oh! one moment," went on Carter as the Chief Constable was
turning away. "How was the butler killed?"</p>

<p>"Battered on the head," was the reply, "but we can confirm
that in a few minutes, for we shall have the police surgeon here.
I've managed to get him on the 'phone from the village."</p>

<p>"Nothing been touched, of course?" asked Carter.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Chief Constable frowning, "the body's been
brought in. Dr. Shillington had it done before we arrived."</p>

<p>"Damn," swore Carter angrily, "and a doctor ought to have
known better. Where's it been put?"</p>

<p>"On a table in the laundry. I've got one of my men looking
after it now."</p>

<p>They walked into the house, and the Chief Constable bade a
frightened-looking maid inform her master. She tapped timidly on
a door that stood half ajar and immediately, as if he had been
awaiting the summons, a stout and big-framed man appeared.</p>

<p>"From Scotland Yard, Dr. Shillington," said the Chief
Constable indicating his companions. "Chief Inspectors Carter and
Stone and Detective-Inspector Larose."</p>

<p>The doctor eyed the newcomers with a frown. As Stone had told
them in the car, he was a big man, but ponderous would perhaps
have been the better adjective to use. He was well over six feet
in height, and was built on massive lines. He had a large
impressive face with a big mouth and heavy cheeks that sagged
over a determined jaw. His eyes, however, were on the small side,
and dark and beady, they peered out from under bushy brows.
Altogether he looked like a man of considerable mental and moral
force even if physically he were now beginning to run to seed.
Gilbert Larose thought he was not unlike a dangerous and ill-tempered bear.</p>

<p>Without turning round or taking his eyes off the detectives,
the doctor pulled to and closed the door behind him and then he
pointed to a room opening on the other side of the hall.</p>

<p>"We'll go in there," he said gruffly, and he led the way
himself. "Sit down," he went on when they were all inside the
room, and then he added. "But I've nothing much to tell you,
except that I've been robbed as well as having my servant
murdered." He frowned angrily. "What good are you police, I
ask?"</p>

<p>"Well, unhappily, we can't be everywhere Doctor," said Carter
suavely, "and this appears to be probably more work of the gang
that we are finding especially hard nuts to crack." He spoke in
cold official tones. "But will you please now tell us, as far as
you know what happened."</p>

<p>"And it's precious little I can tell," said the doctor. He
leant back in his chair and went on pompously. "I had just
finished making my toilet this morning and was about to come
downstairs when my housemaid informed me precipitately that my
butler Jakes was lying dead behind some shrubs off the drive. I
investigated the matter at once and found it was as she had said.
I then returned to the house and saw that various articles of my
silver were missing&mdash;&mdash;" he pointed with his hand,
"from the sideboard there. My King Charles' salt cellars, my
candlesticks of Louis Quatorze, and two valuable snuffboxes of
George the First."</p>

<p>He paused a moment and Carter asked, frowning&mdash;-</p>

<p>"And was that all that was taken then? They didn't get much of
a haul!"</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington sat bolt upright in his chair. "Not much!" he
snarled. He laughed contemptuously. "A mere trifle of about
&pound;3,000 and in so compact a compass, too, that everything
could have been carried away in the pockets of one man. Not
much!" He snarled again. "Why, sir&mdash;my salt-cellars alone
were worth &pound;250 an ounce."</p>

<p>The detective made no further comment on that score.</p>

<p>"And you had the body moved, Doctor," he said. "You had it
brought into the house." He shook his head reprovingly. "You know
you oughtn't to have done that. You should have waited until the
police came."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the doctor incredulously, "and I was to leave
a corpse right in front of the windows of my institution was I?
For all my patients to see."</p>

<p>"You might have covered it over," said Carter sternly, "with a
rug or a sheet."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't," said the doctor brusquely. "I ordered that
it should be carried in." He smiled sarcastically. "The man was
just as dead wasn't he, on the laundry table as behind the shrubs
in the drive? He would continue dead wherever he was,
surely?"</p>

<p>The detective ignored the question. "And what was the position
of the body when you found it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In dorsal decubitus. He was lying on his back."</p>

<p>"And when had you last seen him, Dr. Shillington?"</p>

<p>The doctor appeared to think for a moment. "When he came into
the study at about 10 o'clock last night. He came, as usual, with
my cup of cocoa that he had prepared."</p>

<p>"How long has he been in your employ?" asked Carter.</p>

<p>"Three years," was the reply, "ever since I purchased the
institution and before that, I understand, he had served my
predecessor for over eighteen years." The doctor's lips curled to
a sneer. "So if you think he was in collusion with the
lawbreakers, you are probably mistaken."</p>

<p>"And did you hear no unusual sounds during the night. Dr.
Shillington?" asked the detective. "Nothing struck you as
happening, out of the ordinary?"</p>

<p>The doctor sighed as if he were tired of all the questioning.
"I was asleep," he said coldly, "before eleven and nothing
disturbed me until my parlor-maid knocked on my door this morning
at half-past seven."</p>

<p>"And how do you suggest," persisted Carter, "that these men
got into the ground and into the house?"</p>

<p>The doctor yawned. "I don't suggest anything," he said,
"except that the authorities show themselves woefully incompetent
when such outrages as these occur." He raised his voice in anger.
"Anything it seems may now happen in this country if we can be
murdered in our beds like this."</p>

<p>The deep voice of Stone was heard for the first time. "And did
your butler then, Dr. Shillington," he asked quietly, "usually
take his rest at night behind these shrubs in the drive? Was that
his usual bed?"</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington's beady eyes flickered angrily as he turned
them on the speaker.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed slowly, "we've met before. I remember you
by the impertinent nature of your interrogations&mdash;then, as
now."</p>

<p>Carter interposed hurriedly, "But what was your butler doing
in the grounds, Doctor? What had he gone outside at all for?"</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington withdrew his eyes reluctantly from the
offending Stone.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said brusquely, "I tell you it's all a
mystery to me. I heard the man go upstairs to bed a few minutes
after he had satisfied my requirements and the next thing noted
was this morning when the parlor-maid found the front door on the
latch, when she came down."</p>

<p>"Oh! then," said Carter, "she found the front door open when
she came down?"</p>

<p>The doctor inclined his head. "So she says," he said, coldly,
"and I see no reason to doubt her word."</p>

<p>There was a knock upon the door and the girl in question
entered to announce that the Chief Constable was wanted in the
hall by a Dr. Hume, from Colechester.</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Carter, rising at once to his feet. "The
police surgeon." He turned to the doctor. "I think we'll view the
body all together now, please, Dr. Shillington."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington rose at once, too, and with a curt gesture
motioned to everyone to follow him from the room.</p>

<p>"A nice specimen," breathed Stone into Larose's ear as they
were filing out, "I'd like to punch his head."</p>

<p>"He's a liar," whispered back Larose. "He never slept all
through the night. He looks dead tired now, and his trousers are
all rumpled and out of shape as if he'd been lying down without
taking them off."</p>

<p>The humor died instantly from the big detective's face, and
with his lips slightly parted, for quite an appreciable number of
seconds he stared hard at Larose, then, frowning heavily, he
turned and without a word followed after the others into the
hall.</p>

<p>The laundry was at the back of the house, and Dr. Shillington,
with the importance of a man dealing with his inferiors, led the
way in through the kitchen. The body of the dead man, covered
with a sheet, was stretched upon a table in front of a large
window, and a policeman in uniform, sitting unconcernedly upon a
wash tub, was engaged in the perusal of a newspaper. He sprang up
and stood stiffly to attention when the party came in.</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington strode forward and lifted off the sheet. "A
good servant," he remarked in a judicial tone; "I shall have
difficulty in replacing him."</p>

<p>They all came up and stood round the table for a moment in
complete silence.</p>

<p>The body before them was fully clothed and was that of a
medium sized man between fifty and sixty years of age. It was
lying stiffly on its back with its arms stretched straight down.
The head was, however, turned slightly to one side. The jaw
sagged a little, the eyes were half open and the face was mottled
over in places with black blood. The front of the clothing was
bloody, too.</p>

<p>The police surgeon spoke first.</p>

<p>"Hum! Not pretty," he remarked, and he proceeded to take off
his coat and tuck up his shirt sleeves. Then he passed his hands
rapidly over the body.</p>

<p>"Been dead a long time," he said, "probably more than twelve
hours. Found in the grounds, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Carter. "Dr. Shillington had it brought in at
half-past eight this morning."</p>

<p>The surgeon turned to Dr. Shillington. "Was the rigor quite
pronounced then, doctor?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the doctor carelessly, "at any rate, in the
arms. I just lifted one. I didn't touch the lower limbs."</p>

<p>The surgeon nodded. "Well, it was probably complete, for the
night was chilly and as I say, he's been dead a long while." He
turned back to the body. "Yes," he went on, "bones of nose
broken, but not from direct blow, for there is no abrasion of the
skin. Blow, on the cheek. That will probably account for some of
that blood in the mouth, with inside of cheek cut against the
teeth." He turned the body partly over on to one side and peered
intently at the back of the head. "Ah!" he exclaimed, "now,
here's something. Heavy blow on the back of the neck, pretty high
up, just below the head. See the bruising. Not done with anything
hard, because the skin's not broken. Probably a blow from the
fist." He let the body fall back gently, and then again examined
the nose. "Yes, that's it. He was struck from behind and jerked
forwards with considerable violence on to the ground. The fall
broke his nose and caused all that blood we see,
then&mdash;&mdash;" he paused just a moment and carefully
scrutinised the front of the neck, "then he was suffocated before
he had regained consciousness."</p>

<p>The silence that ensued was broken by a deep sigh from the
Chief Constable. A soldier only, he was not so accustomed as the
others were to cold-blooded analysis of sudden death. And this
was a killing done horribly, too, by stealth in the dark hours of
the night. He repressed a shudder.</p>

<p>The police surgeon went on.</p>

<p>"Of course, I am only speaking in the light of a very cursory
examination, but still I am sure the post-mortem will confirm in
the main what I am telling you now. There are all signs present
that there was firm pressure on the nose and mouth with some kind
of cloth&mdash;see, for one thing, those unnatural indentations
of the teeth upon the lower lip&mdash;and that bluey tinge
everywhere points indisputably to the fact that just previous to
the actual supervention of death there was no air getting into
the lungs." He looked very thoughtfully at the body. "But I don't
think there was any struggling. That blow on the nape of the neck
and the fall knocked him completely out, and he just died from
suffocation without fully coming to." He smiled at the
detectives. "Well, gentlemen, that's all from me for the present
from my particular angle of view, and it's up to you now to
follow on with the discoveries that don't come within my
province."</p>

<p>"But about what time should you say he was killed, Dr. Hume?"
asked Carter.</p>

<p>The police surgeon hesitated. "Well, that's difficult to say,
sir. You see we have to take into consideration so many things.
Still&mdash;&mdash;" he brightened up, "we can form a pretty good
idea, for when Dr. Shillington lifted the arm this morning at
half-past 8 he tells us he found rigor mortis was there. He
didn't touch the legs, so we can't learn from him whether the
rigor was complete over the whole body, but you can certainly
find out that from those who brought the poor chap in. They'll
remember, of course, if he was stiff all over when they lifted
him. Well, provided he was stiff, which I think most probable, we
can be pretty sure that he was killed before midnight. Of course,
as I say, there are several things that we must bear in mind. He
was a man, well-nourished, and apparently in good health; he died
from suffocation, and although he died by violent means, he died
without a struggle. I mean there was no strenuous exertion just
before he died. Also, he died in his clothes. All these things
would tend to delay the rigor mortis setting in, but on the other
hand he has been lying out all night in the open air, and the
night was chilly&mdash;very." The surgeon picked up a piece of
soap and turned on the water in one of the washing troughs.
"Yes," he concluded, "we can say with fair accuracy, he was
killed between 10 and 12 last night."</p>

<p>No one seemed desirous of asking any further questions, and
after a moment's silence, he turned to the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>"I'll manage the post-mortem this afternoon, Major," he said,
"if you'll have it brought in."</p>

<p>The Chief Constable nodded. "It shall be in Colchester within
a couple of hours. I'll 'phone up for the ambulance to come at
once. Oh! I forgot," he added, "the wire's been cut here, of
course. We'll have to ring up, then, from the village."</p>

<p>"But I'll lend you a lorry, Major Harvey," said Dr.
Shillington, speaking much more amiably than he had as yet
spoken. "We have one here, and the body can go at once."</p>

<p>The Chief Constable shook his head. "Thank you, Doctor," he
replied. "I'm much obliged to you, but our ambulance will be
best. You see, we have to take special precautions that the body
isn't bumped at all in transit, for it will have to undergo a
very minute examination when we get it in to Colchester."</p>

<p>"And we shall want to go over it again, too," added Stone
sternly, "before it leaves the table here." He flashed a
significant look at the constable on duty. "So it's not to be
touched by anyone until we give orders," and he picked up the
sheet and drew it again over the body.</p>

<p>Carter turned to Dr. Shillington. "Well interview the maids
now, please, Doctor," he said, "and then we'll go over the house
and see if we can find how they got in."</p>

<p>The doctor made no reply, and the little party filed back into
the hall. There they found the parlor-maid speaking to a man clad
in motor bicycle overalls. He was holding a bag in his hand.</p>

<p>"To see about the telephone, sir," explained the girl timidly
to her master. "They rang up from the village that ours was out
of order."</p>

<p>"All right," said the doctor curtly, "show him where it
is."</p>

<p>"One moment, please," said Carter, and he spoke directly to
the young man. "When you've found where the fault it, don't start
any repair until we've seen what's wrong. We're connected with
the police," he added, "and there's been a murder done here."</p>

<p>The girl led the man away, the police surgeon walked with the
Chief Constable into the drive, while the three detectives went
back with Dr. Shillington into the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Now, Doctor, please," said Carter, "we'll just have a few
words with the maids. But you needn't wait, sir, if you're busy.
We don't want to trespass unduly on your time."</p>

<p>"I'll be present," said the doctor curtly; "I'm free for the
moment," and he touched the bell.</p>

<p>"Now, Smithers," he said, "these&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated,
"these gentlemen want to question you. When you came down this
morning, what did you&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh! if you please, Doctor," interrupted Carter, "we'll ask
her what we want. It will be quicker."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington subsided with dignity into his armchair. He
yawned as if he were bored, and then his eyes wandered round and
fell upon Larose. The latter was apparently uninterested in what
the girl would have to tell, and instead was engaged in staring
fixedly at each and every different article in the room, one by
one. The chairs, the sofa, the sideboard&mdash;he stared very
long there&mdash;the window curtains, and pieces of china upon
some shelves, the carpet&mdash;he seemed to search the carpet all
over as if he were looking for a lost pin&mdash;the wainscoting,
the table, the tablecloth, but here he might have sensed that the
doctor was looking at him, for he closed his eyes, and then
rubbed them vigorously as if he were very tired.</p>

<p>Carter's examination of the maid was soon over. She could tell
nothing except that she shared a bedroom with the housemaid, had
gone to bed at half-past nine, had heard nothing unusual during
the night, and had come down just before seven to find the hall
door open. She had not thought the latter fact very startling,
for the deceased butler occasionally went down early to the lodge
to pick up the morning papers, which were generally thrown over
the gate about half-past six.</p>

<p>The housemaid followed, and she had nothing at all of any
moment to tell. Then came the cook, and to her also the night had
been quite uneventful, except that under cross-examination it was
elicited she had wakened up once after she had dropped off to
sleep and remembered thinking that she had heard the butler
moving about in his room. She could not say what time in the
night it was when she had wakened up, nor what was the exact
nature of the sound that she had heard. She thought now that it
might have been the moving of a chair. She had nibbled a piece of
chocolate&mdash;she always kept a piece handy, and had gone
straight off to sleep again.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, what next?" asked Dr. Shillington of Carter when
the cook had gone out, and he spoke in a tired, long-suffering
tone.</p>

<p>"The premises, please," said Carter briskly, "we'll just run
over the house. We'll take the ground floor first. We'll go
straight round."</p>

<p>But in the hall there was a delay for a couple of minutes. The
telephone man was waiting for them there.</p>

<p>"Found what's wrong, sir," he said, "the wire was cut just
under the box."</p>

<p>The telephone was in a small cloakroom leading out from the
far end of the hall, and it was at once inspected by the
detectives, with the chief constable and the doctor close
behind.</p>

<p>"Hacked away," enunciated Carter as he held the torn wires in
his hand. "No chance of any finger prints here." He looked at
Stone. "He can mend it straight away, eh?"</p>

<p>Stone nodded, and they returned into the hall. The doctor's
study was the first room to be inspected, but apparently to the
fastenings of the windows only did the detectives give much
attention.</p>

<p>"Always bolt them at night, doctor?" asked Carter.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Dr. Shillington, "and as you heard from
Smithers, they were bolted when she came in this morning."</p>

<p>Room by room they went over the ground floor. Carter, the
doctor, and the chief constable invariably going first, with
Stone and Larose following behind.</p>

<p>"His lordship's taken a dislike to you for some reason,"
whispered the big detective presently to Larose. "I notice he
keeps his eyes on you more than anyone else. How have you come to
annoy him?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" Larose whispered back, and then he went on rapidly.
"Look here, if you don't mind. I won't go upstairs with you. I
want to get a word with those girls when he isn't present. Just
say you've sent me back to the car for a camera if they miss me,
will you?"</p>

<p>Stone grinned. "That's right, sonny, make yourself at home.
You and me are the brains in this case." He nodded. "All O.K.,
I'll tell the necessary lies."</p>

<p>So a few minutes later when the others were going upstairs,
Larose slipped away and darted in the direction of the kitchen.
He slowed down abruptly, however, when he reached the door, and
it was a very leisurely young man with plenty of time on his
hands who stepped in.</p>

<p>He smiled in the friendliest manner possible at the three
girls, who regarded him with uneasy eyes.</p>

<p>"May I come through this way?" he asked. "No, I've not come to
worry you any more. You must be sick of us all by now."</p>

<p>The girls recovered their composure at once and smiled back.
Here was a man not a bit like a detective, he had such a kind and
pleasant face.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Larose, "and I thought you all answered our
questions remarkably well, but my word&mdash;&mdash;" and he
smiled more than ever, "what splendid consciences you must all
have, to sleep as you did. Fancy none of you waking up at all,
all night."</p>

<p>"But I woke up once," said the cook, archly, "as I told the
gentleman."</p>

<p>"Ah! so you did," said Larose. "I had forgotten that." He
pretended to be struck with sudden interest. "Now I wonder what
woke you. You must have heard some noise."</p>

<p>But the cook shook her head. "No, I don't think it was that."
She hesitated a moment and went on thoughtfully, "it might have
been, I think now, because I was imagining I was smelling
something. I have a terribly keen nose for a smell."</p>

<p>"Oh! you smelt something?" asked Larose. "Now, what did you
smell?"</p>

<p>"Something burning, I thought at first," replied the cook,
"and I sat up in bed to make sure." She shook her head again,
"But I smelt nothing then."</p>

<p>"Curious," said Larose, looking very puzzled, "and what did
the first smell remind you of, tobacco?"</p>

<p>"No, no," replied the cook, "something unusual, more like
burning cloth. For an instant I think I imagined the house was on
fire and I was going to jump up, but I couldn't smell anything
more, so I turned over again and went to sleep."</p>

<p>Larose was silent for a moment and looked very sad. "Ah,
well," he sighed, "it's a dreadful business. This poor chap was a
splendid fellow, I hear."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the parlor-maid, "he was that, and always a
perfect gentleman, too."</p>

<p>"Was he of a happy disposition?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the girl. She hesitated, and then added, "at
any rate until a little while ago." She turned to the cook. "He's
seemed worried lately, hasn't he, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the cook, "ever since he gave the master notice
to leave."</p>

<p>"Oh! He was leaving then?" asked Larose. "Has he got the
sack?"</p>

<p>"No; it was him who gave the notice," said the cook, "and the
master was furious. Mr. Jakes was leaving in about a fortnight's
time."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Larose. "Why did he want to go?"</p>

<p>"No one knows." said the parlor-maid. "He wouldn't tell the
master, even, and that made him so wild."</p>

<p>"Did the doctor ever ask any of you if you knew the cause?"
said Larose.</p>

<p>The girls all laughed. "Ask us," said the parlor-maid. "Why,
he hardly speaks to any of us, he's much too grand."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you tell him I've talked to you," laughed back
Larose.</p>

<p>"No fear," said the cook, "we'd all get the sack."</p>

<p>Larose asked another question. "Did Mr. Jakes write a letter
to anyone last night, do you know?"</p>

<p>The cook looked around at the others. "We didn't see him with
any letter," she said, "but he was writing in his book. He kept a
diary and used to write down everything that happened."</p>

<p>"What on earth for?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"So that he could always remember what had happened, he told
us," answered the cook. "At any rate, it was often very useful,"
she went on, "and sometimes helped the master, too. He asked Mr.
Jakes last month, when the lodge gates were last painted, and he
went to his book and found out at once."</p>

<p>They talked on for a few minutes and then Larose took out his
watch. "Well, I shall have to go now," he said, "and as you've
kept me here gossiping,&mdash;&mdash;" he smiled, "I can't do
what I intended to and shall have to go back." He pretended to
shiver. "But, I say, isn't it awfully cold and damp down here? I
was frozen in the car coming down. Do you have fires here every
night at this time of the year?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, no," replied the cook, "and I don't suppose
it's colder with us than it is in London. Of course, there's
always a fire here in the kitchen," she added, "but not usually
anywhere else." She turned to the parlor-maid. "The master didn't
have a fire last night, did he?"</p>

<p>"But he did," replied the girl, "and burned a bit of coal,
too. The box was nearly empty this morning."</p>

<p>With a bright smile Larose bade them good-bye, but once
outside in the passage again the smile faded instantly from his
face.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he whispered, "then it looks as if this old devil
Shillington did it." He wiped the perspiration from his face.
"But, cripes, I must be darned careful in the company I'm now in.
If I make a fool of myself&mdash;&mdash;" but he stopped
whispering and, tip-toeing through the hall, made for the waiting
car outside. Then he pounced on a camera that he had noticed in
one of the pockets and when a couple of minutes or so later the
party descended from the upper rooms, it was a very dull-witted
and innocent-looking young man that stood awaiting them in the
hall.</p>

<p>"A country bumpkin," the big Stone told him afterwards, "a
regular sook."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE AVENGERS.</h2>

<p class="first">A QUARTER of an hour later having minutely
examined the place where the body had been found in the drive,
the Chief Constable and the three detectives were alone together
in the laundry with the body of the dead man.</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington had started to return with them as a matter of
course, but Carter had told him bluntly and decisively that their
deliberations would be private now, and that they must conduct
their examination alone.</p>

<p>"But I'm a medical man," the doctor had protested angrily.</p>

<p>"But not a policeman," Carter had replied firmly, "and we
shall be dealing now with the criminal side."</p>

<p>So they had shut themselves in the laundry and with the police
constable keeping guard outside, they were assured they would not
be disturbed.</p>

<p>The sheet was flung back, and for a long minute they stood in
silence over the body. Then Stone made an expression of disgust
and turned with a scowling face to Larose.</p>

<p>"Your baptism into crime over here, my boy," he said. "A
harmless and inoffensive old man scientifically suffocated whilst
he was unconscious." His voice shook in anger. "There's the peace
of God now on that bloody face, but it calls for bloody war from
us on the wretch that placed it there." He turned up his sleeves
and subsided instantly to matter-of-fact and businesslike tones.
"We'll go through his pockets, first."</p>

<p>But the pockets yielded nothing of much account. Some silver
and a few coppers, a short stump of pencil, a half-emptied packet
of cheap cigarettes, a box of matches, a penknife, an old silver
watch, and that was all.</p>

<p>"Watch stopped at half-past three," checked the big detective
curtly. He twisted the winder. "Not been wound up," he went on,
"therefore deceased had not got ready to go to bed." He bent over
the body. "Now for his clothes. Coat was all buttoned up, every
button, before we undid them&mdash;therefore deceased was killed
when performing his normal duties. If he had been killed when at
his leisure, some of the buttons at least would have been undone
for the coat is tight-fitting, and it would have soon got out of
shape if kept buttoned when he was sitting down. But it isn't out
of shape, and yet it isn't new. Man particular about his clothes.
See, trousers well worn but not baggy at the knees&mdash;remember
trouser presser in his bedroom and note collar and cuffs of
shirt. No fraying anywhere, and as clean as you would expect
after a day's wear. Look at his shoes. Thin, indoor ones. No dust
on them&mdash;therefore he didn't walk far in the
grounds&mdash;&mdash;" the big detective paused thoughtfully, and
then added, "if indeed he walked there at all." He turned
abruptly to Carter. "Now, Elias, what say you?"</p>

<p>"Look at his hands," said Carter. "See how clean they are. He
must have washed them almost the minute before he died, and when
he was struck down he must have been struck so suddenly that he
never put them out even to protect himself and break his fall.
They really appear to have never been brought into contact with
anything since he died." The lanky detective bent down and
scrutinised the dead man's right hand. "He'd been writing
recently, however, I see, and there's a little brown stain on his
middle finger, here."</p>

<p>"Cocoa, I think," broke in Larose gently, and then he got
rather red. "I understand he always made the doctor a cup of
cocoa after the others had gone to bed. Also, the maids tell me
that he was writing last night when they went to their rooms."
The Australian spoke now with more assurance. "You see, I noticed
those marks on the fingers when we were in here a little while
ago and I asked indirectly about them when I was talking in the
kitchen when you were upstairs just now."</p>

<p>The burly Stone looked frowningly at him. "Oh! you're here,
are you?" he said, "I had quite forgotten about you, my
friend."</p>

<p>Carter took a small magnifying glass out of his pocket and
examined the fingers.</p>

<p>"Yes, you're right, I think," he said after a moment, nodding
to Larose. "It looks like cocoa powder certainly." He turned back
to Stone. "Well that shows that he practically handled nothing
after he had made Dr. Shillington's cocoa for him."</p>

<p>"Unless he'd made some afterwards for himself," growled Stone,
"later on in the evening."</p>

<p>"But he never drank cocoa," said Larose. "I thought of that
and asked the maids. He was of a bilious nature and never touched
it."</p>

<p>The frowning face of Stone relaxed. "You are going to be
irrepressible I can see, young man." He smiled grimly. "Now what
are your ideas. No, no," he went on with a flash of his old
levity as Larose appeared to be hesitating, "don't be afraid of
Carter here. I'll hold you safe. You can speak out."</p>

<p>But Larose did not smile back.</p>

<p>"Well," he said slowly, "we should learn something from those
blood smears and the way they're smudged upon his neck." He
pointed to a black blotch below one of the dead man's ears.
"See&mdash;the cloth that suffocated him was used afterwards for
another purpose when he was dead. It was wrapped round the whole
head then and where it smeared some of the blood clots over the
face, it left a pattern on them when they stuck in another place.
And it's a pretty coarse pattern too, so the cloth must have been
thick." He pointed again. "There's blood too on the hair almost
to the back of the head on that side, and as it's only on the
surface, and where there's no wound, then it must have been
smeared there too when the head was wrapped up."</p>

<p>"But what the devil should his head have been wrapped up for?"
asked Carter, frowning.</p>

<p>"To protect whoever carried him out into the drive to that
bush," replied Larose, "from bloodying his own clothes. We are
all agreed," he added, "that the killing was not done there."</p>

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated Carter&mdash;and Stone just glared as if his
eyes would drop out of his head.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Larose pensively, "and last night on the two
tables in Dr. Shillington's study there were two small
tablecloths." He sighed as if he were very puzzled. "And this
morning there is only one."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" rapped out Stone.</p>

<p>"I saw there was only one there when we went in the study just
now," replied Larose, looking innocently at the big detective,
"and, mentioning it to the housemaid, she said the second cloth
was gone when she did the study before breakfast. She noticed its
absence, and couldn't understand it then, but she thought
afterwards, when it was known that the silver had been taken,
that the thieves must have taken the cloth, too, to wrap the
silver in."</p>

<p>"And why the devil didn't she tell that to us?" growled Carter
savagely, "when we were questioning her? She said then she knew
nothing at all."</p>

<p>"She didn't think of it then, she told me," said Larose. He
sighed again. "And the cook didn't mention, either, to you that
she thought she smelt burning cloth when she woke up in the
night." He went on meditatively, "And the housemaid says Dr.
Shillington burnt a lot of coal in the study last night, and yet
she hadn't put a match to the fire until after dinner. He used up
all the coal there was in the coal scuttle, and so, if he was in
bed and asleep before eleven, as he told us, then he must have
stoked up pretty well before he went to his room."</p>

<p>There was a long silence, and then the chief constable broke
in, speaking for the first time.</p>

<p>"But it's incredible that Dr. Shillington had anything to do
with the murder," he gasped. "What should he kill his butler
for?"</p>

<p>Larose shrugged his shoulders. "Who knows?" he replied softly.
"At any rate, they were not on good terms. The butler had given
notice and was leaving in a fortnight."</p>

<p>"What for?" snapped Carter with a frown.</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No one knows," he said. "The man would
not even tell his master why, and the maids say the doctor was
furious in consequence."</p>

<p>"Now, why did Shillington keep that back?" scowled Stone. He
squared his jaw threateningly. "We'll have to talk to him
again."</p>

<p>"But the butler kept a diary," said Larose, "and the girls say
he was writing in it last night, so if only we could get hold of
that we might learn something without letting the doctor suspect
that the maids have been talking behind his back."</p>

<p>"A diary!" ejaculated Carter incredulously. "The butler kept a
diary, they said?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Larose, "and as they told me, he'd been worried
and had seemed very upset lately, so if he put his thoughts down,
we should find out why he was leaving."</p>

<p>"But look here!" said Carter, addressing himself frowningly to
Larose. "If Shillington did the murder in his study, as you seem
to want to make out&mdash;&mdash;" he pointed to the body on the
table&mdash;"then there must be blood about, for the man bled
profusely from that broken nose."</p>

<p>"I noticed a large bottle of peroxide as we were passing
through the bathroom just now," said Larose gently, and then he
added contemplatively, "And hydrogen peroxide's a wonderful thing
to get bloodmarks out with, particularly if they're fresh. The
bottle was nearly empty, too, and yet from the look of the label
on it, it doesn't seem to me as if it had been opened long."</p>

<p>Carter smiled grimly. "You've a wonderful imagination, young
man," he said, "and you travel pretty fast."</p>

<p>"But I believe he's right," broke in Stone vehemently. "Yes,
by Jove, I do. This Shillington was only playing with us just
now, and when you think a moment, he can't possibly be the
pompous ass he was trying to make out he was. He's well known as
a shrewd and clever man, Shillington. Why, in his own line he's
got one of the biggest reputations in the medical world, and he's
loaded up with all sorts of university degrees. The Lunacy
Commission even call him into consultation sometimes." The stout
detective shook his head vigorously. "No, no, he was play-acting
with us to hide his real feelings, which are probably those of
fear. That's what I believe, at all events."</p>

<p>"But if he killed him, what's the motive, Stone?" asked Carter
coldly.</p>

<p>"We've got to find out," replied Stone with some heat, "and
maybe it'll turn out to be a pretty sinister motive when we do."
He turned to the Australian. "What do you say, Larose?"</p>

<p>"I'm puzzled," said Larose slowly. "Very puzzled." He spoke
with more confidence. "But one thing stands out clearly, very
clearly. Whoever did the murder, did it deliberately, knowing
quite well what he was about. He might certainly have struck down
the man in a fit of passion, but the suffocating was done in cold
blood, and done undoubtedly to prevent the butler telling
something that he knew." The voice of Larose hardened sternly.
"Yes, he took two secrets with him, that butler, when he died.
One, the secret of who killed him, and the other, the secret of
why he was killed."</p>

<p>Carter frowned and smiled at the same time. "Excellent," he
commented, thoughtfully. "As I remarked before, you've a great
imagination, Mr. Larose." The smile died from his face. "But I'm
not certain that some imagination is not exactly what we are
wanting here."</p>

<p>"The murderer was no ordinary thief," went on Larose
persuasively, "or he wouldn't have gone to all the trouble of
carrying out the body to behind the bush. No, he carried it there
because if it had been found on the exact spot where the murder
had been done, suspicion would have pointed definitely to one
person. A murderer from outside would surely have left the body
just where he had murdered the man. With him&mdash;&mdash;"
Larose shrugged his shoulders again, "it would have been, just
'kill and run.'"</p>

<p>"And he was killed somewhere indoors," added Stone
emphatically, "or there'd have been more dirt in his wounds and
about his head."</p>

<p>Carter sighed as if he were very troubled.</p>

<p>"But to come down to bedrock now," he said rather irritably,
"what scrap of direct evidence have you, Mr. Larose, against Dr.
Shillington that he committed this murder?"</p>

<p>"Not one scrap whatever," replied Larose instantly, "but all
the same&mdash;he's suspect." The Australian spoke rapidly. "He's
hiding something, he's got a secret, and for some reason he's
trying to throw dust in our eyes. He never told us, for instance,
that the butler was leaving in a fortnight, and he implied at
this very table that the murderer had robbed him of a good
servant. He's lying to us, too. He told us he was in bed, and
asleep, before 11 last night, but as the housemaid says he used a
large scuttleful of coal in his study, therefore he must have
been up very late. The man looks dead tired, too, and I don't
believe he took his clothes off or slept a wink." Larose shook
his head. "No, no, his actions are peculiar, and as I
say&mdash;he's suspect."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll go up to the butler's room again," said Carter,
"and get that diary at once. We may learn something from it."</p>

<p>"But we'll not find it, I'm very much afraid," commented
Larose sadly. "Dr. Shillington knew about it, and if there was
damning evidence in it, he'll have taken it away."</p>

<p>Filing out of the laundry, the burly Stone sidled up to
Larose.</p>

<p>"Any of your people come from Leeds by any chance, young man?"
he asked in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," replied Larose very puzzled. "Why?"</p>

<p>The stout man looked disappointed. "Because I thought perhaps
we might be related." He nodded his head emphatically. "You've
got a brain like mine."</p>

<p>Passing out through the kitchen into the hall, there was no
sign anywhere of Dr. Shillington, and for a moment they stood
listening.</p>

<p>"Knock on his door," said Larose sharply. "Perhaps he's not
here, and, suiting the action to the word, he darted up and
tapped twice.</p>

<p>"He's out!" he ejaculated, and in an instant he had opened the
door and was in the room. The others followed; Carter frowning,
the Chief Constable looking uncomfortable, and Stone breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>Larose flung himself down upon his knees.</p>

<p>"It'll be here between his desk and the door," he whispered.
"The butler would have been turning to walk out when he was
knocked over," and he began to pass his hands over the surface of
the carpet.</p>

<p>"Here, here it is!" he exclaimed almost instantly, "feel, it's
quite damp," and he whipped an envelope out of the breast pocket
of his coat and rubbed it vigorously over the carpet. "See, the
moist smear," he went on. "No, unfortunately, it's not blood. The
stains would have been washed out too thoroughly for that, but
still&mdash;&mdash;" he nodded swiftly to Carter, "it supports
what I said."</p>

<p>He jumped to his feet. "See, there's the other
tablecloth&mdash;a thick serge one, and note the second table's
bare. Now, for the fireplace, but I'm afraid&mdash;&mdash;Quick,
quick!" he called out, and he pointed to the window; "there's
Shillington coming across from the Asylum, we mustn't be found
here," and he almost pushed the bewildered Chief Constable, who
happened to be nearest to him, out of the room.</p>

<p>"Upstairs!" said Stone curtly, when they were all back in the
hall. "And old Shillington will think we're still in the laundry,
and we'll be left alone."</p>

<p>Hurriedly running up the stairs, they tip-toed into the dead
man's room, and Carter swiftly pushed to the door.</p>

<p>"Now," he said sharply, "this is going to be quite a different
look-over from the one we made a little while ago. Then, we were
only trying to find out if entrance into the house could have
been effected this way, but this time,"&mdash;he smiled
grimly&mdash;"we are going to elaborate some of the theories of
our young friend here." He turned to Larose. "Now, sir, take a
good look round on your own before we begin."</p>

<p>And Larose certainly was taking a good look round. He stood
with half-closed eyes and stared from one thing to another, over
everything in the room. The room was sparsely but neatly
furnished. A narrow bed in one corner, a hanging wardrobe in
another, a table in front of the window with some papers and
half-a-dozen or so of neatly-arranged small boxes on it, a small
chest of drawers, a comfortable-looking armchair, an old-fashioned washstand, a mirror and two pictures on the wall, two
shelves of books, a biggish leather trunk, and the inventory was
complete.</p>

<p>Larose strode to the table and began opening the boxes.</p>

<p>"Shells!" he exclaimed. "He collected shells&mdash;and he
pressed flowers, too; wild flowers they look to me. Then he was a
botanist, and look&mdash;he's got a little microscope. Quite a
good one, too. It must have cost him something." He ran through
the boxes. "Painstaking, methodical, everything neat and precise.
One moment," and he smiled at Carter, "let us look at his books."
He addressed the company generally. "I'm always very great on a
man's books; they point so well to his tastes and the
inclinations of his mind." He tip-toed softly to the book-shelf.
"The Wildflowers of England," I thought so. "Bunyan's 'Pilgrim's
Progress,' Ingersoll's 'Mistakes of Moses.' 'Sermons' by Charles
Haddon Spurgeon, Winwood Reade's 'Martyrdom of Man.' Dear me!
Dear me! A real seeker after truth. 'Crossword Puzzles,' 'Two
Thousand Riddles,' 'The Riddle of the Sands.' Ah! He slipped
there. 'Tales of Mystery and Imagination,' by Edgar Allan Poe.
'Famous Trials of the Nineteenth Century,' 'Crime and the
Criminal.' Come, come; surely he was getting out of his depth.
'Pepys Diary,' and 'Memoirs of a Physician.'"</p>

<p>Larose rubbed his hands together delightedly. "Really, now, we
have the whole epitome of the man's life here, and his whole
character and temperament stand out before us. A lover of wild
flowers, a man of principle, and&mdash;probably of piety. An
analytical mind, in its cramped and simple way. He liked mystery
and puzzles, and doubtless, then, he would look for them about
him and devote his energies to their solution when they came
along. For he was imitative&mdash;note 'Pepys Diary.' Probably
that gave him the idea of writing a diary of his own. His
memoirs, the memoirs of his life down here, his
thoughts&mdash;&mdash;" The Australian frowned suddenly. "Ah!
That reminds me. Well, where is that diary, now?"</p>

<p>Stone winked at Carter. "A dreamer, Elias," he whispered, "and
he works in a different way to you and me."</p>

<p>Carter returned a slow grim smile, and then, bending down,
dragged the big leather trunk into the centre of the room.</p>

<p>"It's locked," he said, after a moment, "and where'll we find
the key?"</p>

<p>"Shillington's got it," growled Stone, "if it was he whom the
girls heard prowling about up here during the night." He strode
over to the hanging wardrobe. "But well go through his other
clothes."</p>

<p>"Try the chest of drawers first," suggested Carter quickly.
"Shillington's not subtle enough to have thought of putting it in
another pocket. He's too hasty, and besides"&mdash;the lanky
detective smiled drily&mdash;"I imagine he wouldn't fancy
touching any of his butler's garments."</p>

<p>Stone instantly changed his direction, and, pulling open the
top drawer of the piece of furniture indicated, thrust his hand
down inside and immediately produced a bunch of keys.</p>

<p>"Very simple," he sneered sarcastically, "and just the very
place where anyone would hide his keys if he didn't want them to
be found. Right on the very top of everything, too, and where no
one would ever think of looking, of course." He checked off the
keys. "His own trunk, front door key, and,"&mdash;he hesitated
&amp; moment&mdash;"probably the key of the gate in the drive.
It's bigger, and has an outdoor look."</p>

<p>In a few seconds the lid of the trunk had been thrown back and
they were gazing on the dead butler's effects.</p>

<p>The contents were in some confusion, but four books of a
uniform size immediately caught their eyes.</p>

<p>"The diaries!" ejaculated Carter, and instantly he bent down
and lifted them out. They were just ordinary diaries with black
cloth covers, and ones that could be bought anywhere at any good-class stationers' shop. They were interleaved with blotting
paper, and there was a page for each day.</p>

<p>"But there's one missing," exclaimed Carter. "This year's is
not here."</p>

<p>He rummaged among the other things in the trunk, and then
straightened himself up and looked at Larose.</p>

<p>"You're right, sir," he said, frowning, "unless&mdash;" he
looked round the room&mdash;"unless he left it downstairs."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Larose, shaking his head, "the girls say he was
most secretive about his writing lately, and they have never, any
of them, had a chance of reading what he wrote. He was very
careful, and indeed never wrote in the kitchen at all, except
when it was too cold for him to write up here."</p>

<p>"Well, what's he got here?" said Stone, and he picked up a
small sheaf of newspaper cuttings, held together with a large
pin. "Hullo! all about the Iron Man." He turned them over
rapidly. "Yes, all of them about him. He's been filing the
accounts of the raids, one by one. Here, Elias, have a look."</p>

<p>Carter made a quick scrutiny.</p>

<p>"There are not half of them there," he said, frowning. "He's
got nothing about any of the first six. This earliest one is
about Benfield Towers&mdash;raid number seven, on June 28th." He
sighed heavily. "It'll be a deuced long time before I'm able to
forget any of those dates." He passed the cuttings over to
Larose. "Your turn, young man."</p>

<p>Larose, too, regarded them with a frown. "There's a reason
always for everything," he said thoughtfully, "and it might
interest us quite a lot perhaps if we knew why he only began to
collect them when he did."</p>

<p>They went through the other things in the trunk and then
Carter took out a hard object wrapped round in what was
apparently, from its thickness, the entire issue of a
newspaper.</p>

<p>"Binoculars," he said, when he had unrolled the paper, "and
they look quite new," and he undid the strap of the little
leather case and held up a pair of small aluminium glasses. After
a moment's inspection, he was returning them to the trunk when
Larose stretched out his hand.</p>

<p>"Let's have a look," he said, and he took the newspaper as
well. "Yes, they are almost new," he went on, "but not quite, for
from the markings there, made by the brass stud in the strap, the
case had been fastened and unfastened a good many times." He
looked at the newspaper. "Ah!" he exclaimed, "now this tells us
surely when he bought the binoculars. 'Colchester Evening News,'
Tuesday, July 2nd." He turned over the newspaper and examined it
carefully. "Yes, they've been wrapped and unwrapped in it so
often that the paper's got quite a natural bend in it and the
lettering is worn off at the bends." He frowned. "Now, why did he
wrap up these binoculars so carefully every time in newspaper
when they would have been quite all right in their leather case,
and why did he keep them locked up at all and tuck them right at
the bottom of the trunk?" Larose waved his hand round the room.
"Look, he's the kind of man who was proud of all his little
belongings and liked to have them about him before his eyes. Look
at those nickel backed brushes, look at that chess board and box
of men, look at his microscope, look at his little
camera&mdash;all lying out for anyone to see, and
then&mdash;&mdash;" he frowned again, "look at these binoculars,
wrapped up in newspaper every time and locked away at the bottom
of his trunk." The Australian shook his head. "I tell you, I
don't understand it. I'm puzzled in some way."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Larose," said the Chief Constable politely, "surely
it's a matter of no importance at all where the man kept his
glasses. It can have no significance for us in any way."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Larose quickly, "there is nothing in this room
that may not be without its significance if we can but pick it
out." His tone was very solemn. "This is no ordinary house now,
we must remember. It is a house of blood, for murder has been
done and we are groping for the murderer. We are trying to get
him by uncovering the motive for the crime, and any moment, then,
the apparently most trivial observation may lead us to some clue
we want. That poor wretch in the laundry will certainly speak no
more, but any one of these inanimate things in his room here may
suddenly shout out their secret to us if only we can so attune
our senses that we may understand." He smiled as if he would
apologise for his earnestness. "But please pardon me, if I seem
to be too insistent. I am new to your ways over here. I
am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all," broke in the Chief Constable
protestingly. "Everything you have brought up, directly you have
explained it, has seemed most reasonable to me, and it has been
most educational, I assure you, to follow your deductions." He
smiled in the most friendly way. "So go on, please, Mr. Larose,
and don't think I am criticising you because I am asking
questions."</p>

<p>"Well," said Larose, "what I meant to lead up to was this.
Here, all around us, this countryside is being smitten as with a
pestilence, with a series of dreadful crimes. They have been
occurring now during a period of time longer than six months, and
the solving of their mystery, at the moment, seems as far away as
ever. Now, with the stage set in exactly the same surroundings,
comes this murder here, and we are suspicious&mdash;" the
Australian detective dropped his voice to an intense whisper,
"that it was not mere burglary that has occasioned it. We are
becoming convinced with every step that what happened last night
was only the culminating act of the drama, and that the murder
was not an isolated happening on its own, due to the chance
encounter of the butler with the robbers, but was a happening
that followed as a natural corollary upon certain definite events
that had preceded it." Larose raised his voice again. "Here we
have a servant who has been in the same situation for over twenty
years and who has been undoubtedly, up to a certain time, content
with his life in his own simple way. He was happy in his hobbies,
in his books, in his botanising and his collection of shells, and
he was of an age, too, when routine begins to count for
everything, and when one is strongly disinclined to summarily
alter all one's habits and surroundings. But what happened?
Suddenly the man's whole disposition seemed to alter. From being
open and free and happy, he became all at once secretive and
morose and ill at ease. He was worried and disturbed, his fellow-servants say. He kept his affairs to himself until strung up by
something to some point, he at last made known his intention of
breaking with the associations of more than a third of the
duration of his life. But he refused to say why, and he refused
even to the extent of making his employer angry." Larose frowned
as if he were very puzzled. "Now when a man has been murdered in
surroundings of mystery we are always bound to be intensely
curious about him and to want to learn as much as possible about
everything that went before. There is nothing that would not be
interesting to us and nothing as I say, that would be so trivial
and insignificant that it might not help us in some way. So now,
amongst other things&mdash;" and his face relaxed to a sad smile,
"we want to know why this poor man started to collect cuttings
about these raids on Saturday, June the 29th last, why he bought
a pair of binoculars upon the following Tuesday, and why every
time apparently after he had used them, he wrapped them up in
newspaper and hid them at the bottom of his trunk."</p>

<p>"But if he kept them locked away in his trunk," said the Chief
Constable frowning, "wrapping them in a newspaper wouldn't keep
them any safer from prying eyes. The wrapping was quite
unnecessary, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Quite," agreed Larose instantly, "and that's what makes the
action the more significant. No, the man was obsessed evidently
that he must take all precautions that no one should know he
possessed glasses, and he probably argued to himself that if
anyone did get at his keys and open his trunk, then the
binoculars might still escape observation wrapped up in newspaper
as they were&mdash;unless, of course, anybody was actually
looking for them." The Australian walked to the window. "Well, so
much for that. Now I wonder if he bought them to use up
here."</p>

<p>He raised the glasses to his eyes and swept them slowly round.
The window was well above the height of the asylum walls and
faced seawards. The country on every side was flat and almost
treeless, and about a mile or so away two arms of the sea curled
in and made a small island. The island was separated from the
mainland by only about 50 yards of mud and water, and there was
one solitary house upon it. The land everywhere looked green and
marshy. A narrow winding road led down to the island.</p>

<p>"A deary-looking prospect," remarked Stone, "and if he saw
much there to interest him, then he must have been easily
pleased."</p>

<p>"But we'll go downstairs now," said Carter suddenly, "and have
a talk outside. We've seen all we can here."</p>

<p>Passing again through the hall the sound of a voice, slightly
raised, came to them from Dr. Shillington's study.</p>

<p>"Hark!" whispered Larose. "He's in there, and he's
telephoning," and they all stood still to listen.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;of course," came the doctor's voice clearly,
and he spoke in sharp and businesslike tones. "I tell you I'm
prepared to wait for him if his lordship won't spare him
before.... But I can't go three weeks without anyone... No, quite
impossible. Well, can you do it?... But, mind, I don't want
anyone who's no good sent down, and I'm very particular about my
clothes ... Yes, he must be able to valet me as well. Sure he's
all right?... Well, by the mid-day train to-morrow. Leaves
Liverpool-street at a quarter past 12.... He shall be met at
Colchester then by my car.... Tell him to wait by the
bookstall.... Yes, my chauffeur's in livery, of course ... What
name did you say?... Mason, Frederick Mason. All right, good
morning," and the talking ceased, and they heard the doctor hang
up the receiver.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick," said Larose, "outside before he learns we have
been listening. He's been engaging a temporary butler,"&mdash;his
eyes gleamed&mdash;"and I'll take on the job."</p>

<p>They walked out into the drive to almost run into the parlor-maid, who was bringing in some freshly cut flowers. She singled
out Larose directly she saw them and smiled slightly.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the by," said the Australian, smiling back, "do you
happen to know where we can borrow a pair of field-glasses, now?
We shall have to examine all the top of the wall to try and see
where they got over, and it will save a lot of climbing if we can
get some glasses somewhere."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "No," she said thoughtfully, "I'm
sorry; I don't know anyone who's got any. I've never seen any
here."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Larose, and he made no further comment.</p>

<p>The girl was passing on, when Stone said, laughingly. "But,
look here, young lady, this young man's not going to get all the
smiles. What about us old fogies, now? We're much better looking
too." His voice became more serious. "But I want to ask you
something myself."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the girl, and in spite of the big detective's
friendly manner she looked disturbed.</p>

<p>"Now," said Stone, "about this poor Mr. Jakes. Was he of a
happy and contented disposition, should you say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," replied the girl, "he was always bright and
joking&mdash;" she hesitated, "until recently, when he's not been
well."</p>

<p>"What's been the matter with him?" asked Stone, smiling.</p>

<p>"We don't know. He would never tell us," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Well, what were his symptoms?" went on the detective. "Had he
any pain anywhere, or did he get faint or anything like
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no," replied the girl at once. "He wasn't ill like that.
But we could see he was worried about something. He had become so
quiet and he didn't talk, and he spent such a lot of his time
alone in his room."</p>

<p>"Didn't he go out at all then," went on Stone, "when he had
his time off?" He smiled. "I suppose he had time off?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the girl replied. "Every day he was free from just
after lunch until five. He used to go for walks sometimes, but
not so much lately. Instead, as I've told you, he's stopped up in
his room."</p>

<p>"Was he ever away the whole day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he had every other Tuesday off, and then sometimes he'd
go by the bus into Colchester."</p>

<p>The detective was silent for a moment, and then he asked. "And
about this famous diary of his; did he ever show you girls any of
it?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "He used to, quite a lot once," she replied,
"but he hasn't lately, since he's not been well. We've hardly
seen it the last few weeks."</p>

<p>"But what did he write in it?" asked the detective, frowning,
"only about all your lives here?"</p>

<p>For the first time the girl laughed. "Oh! no, he used to put
in bits about things that were happening everywhere," she
replied. "About cricket and football and Parliament and when
people died," she made a little grimace, "and about murders and
robberies, too."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Stone, smiling again, "and was he interested
in the Iron Man, for instance?"</p>

<p>The girl seemed to shudder. "Yes, he talked a lot about him at
one time," she replied, "but he's said nothing lately." Her voice
shook a little. "We thought he was getting afraid."</p>

<p>"Why?" snapped Stone.</p>

<p>She hesitated. "Because at night when he went to bed he'd
taken to locking his door. He never used to do that at one
time."</p>

<p>Stone looked very thoughtful. "Did he do his own room?" he
asked. "Make the bed and tidy it and all that, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he did everything except scrub the floor, and one of us
girls did that once a week."</p>

<p>"One more question," said Stone, "and then I've done. Did you
ever see his keys lying about?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "No, never; he always had them in his
pocket."</p>

<p>"Sure?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"Certain," she replied. "He was very particular about them
always."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all," said Stone. He looked at her confidingly.
"And you be a good girl and oblige us by not mentioning to a soul
the things that I've been asking you. Not even to the other
girls. You promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the girl, and with a flash of her eyes
towards Larose she went into the house.</p>

<p>"Damn you, young man," frowned Stone, as they got back into
their car, "you've been trying to mash that girl, Gilbert
Larose."</p>

<p>But Larose only smiled sadly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; PICKING UP THE TRAIL.</h2>

<p class="first">THE car was driven swiftly out of the grounds,
but directly it was round the corner and out of sight of the
lodge gates, at a sign from Carter, it was turned a little way up
a side lane and pulled up to one side of the road.</p>

<p>"We'll get out," he said, "and have a talk. You wait here," he
went on to the driver, "and keep your eyes skinned as to what
cars pass coming from the asylum way. I don't expect you'll see
anyone, but, at any rate, look out for that fat doctor chap, and
if he passes give us a whistle. Understand?"</p>

<p>They moved off for about a hundred yards, and then sat down on
a bank under a tree.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Carter, "what are we going to do? For if
there's any truth in what we suspect now, it's no good trying to
pick up any clues here outside."</p>

<p>"Waste of time," grunted Stone. "Shillington's in it up to the
neck." He eyed Larose good-humoredly. "You're smart, young chap.
You tumbled to it, first."</p>

<p>"Yes, you're an acquisition, Mr. Larose," agreed Carter
cordially. "You're a bit quicker in your strike than we are, but
mind you," and he frowned slightly, "if you hit out always as
quickly as you did this morning, I'm not certain your blows will
always be as true. Slow and sure is our motto over here. Now
isn't it, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Slow be damned," growled Stone, "if you see a dial before
you, punch it, is what I say." He frowned heavily. "Now what's
going to be our next move? We must decide quickly."</p>

<p>"Well," said Larose gently, "subject to your approval, I'd
like to be that temporary butler he's engaging."</p>

<p>"But how?" asked Carter sharply.</p>

<p>"We'll find out from the village here," replied Larose, "as to
where he made his call&mdash;it was to a registry office, of
course&mdash;and then you'll go there and get me taken on or else
we'll bribe that butler to-morrow, or kidnap him if he's not
bribeable, and then I'll take his place."</p>

<p>The two older men looked fixedly at one another, and then a
slow grin spread across their faces.</p>

<p>"But, good gracious man," said Carter, after a moment, "the
police don't do things like that over here. We can't kidnap
respectable citizens, and we don't bribe people either."</p>

<p>"We haven't the money for one thing," supplemented Stone
sadly, "we're too badly paid. Besides, we police are fairly
decent as a force&mdash;" he lowered his voice to a stage
whisper&mdash;"except for Carter, here."</p>

<p>Larose hastened to put himself right.</p>

<p>"Oh! of course," he said getting rather red, "you'll know best
what to do, but still I thought this business was so serious that
any means would justify the end." He spoke with great
earnestness. "You see, although I hardly dare to say it, I
believe we're treading now very near the kingdom of the Iron
Man."</p>

<p>"So do I," added Stone impulsively, with all traces of his
levity gone. "That wretched butler stumbled on some discovery and
he died so that this discovery might not become known." He shook
his head frowningly. "I've been in the police for over five and
twenty years now, and I tell you," his eyes swept over the bleak
and marshy countryside, "this damned place fairly reeks of
crime."</p>

<p>"Well, how could you arrange for me to take that butler's
place?" urged Larose persuasively. "You could go to the registry
office people, couldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we could do that, certainly," admitted Carter slowly. He
looked at the Australian doubtfully. "But you're not a butler or
a valet, are you?"</p>

<p>"Both," replied Larose promptly, and he added with a smile, "I
was two months once in the employ of an American millionaire when
he was visiting Sydney, and he never dreamed I was in the C.I.D."
He laughed reminiscently. "He wanted to take me away with him
when he left Australia, too."</p>

<p>Carter took out his watch and then rose instantly to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll go into Colchester at once, now," he said, "and
try and follow up that clue about the house decorator's men. I
don't know the firm you mentioned, but we'll soon find them.
We'll call at the post office here though first."</p>

<p>Pulling up at the village post office, it was Stone, being
nearest to the door, who went in.</p>

<p>"Police," he said to the girl in charge and he showed her his
card. "No, don't be frightened, I'm always nice to anyone with a
pretty face." He smiled in a fatherly manner. "Now all I want to
ask you is, how many trunk calls did you put through
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Five," replied the girl after a moment's thought.</p>

<p>"Got the numbers?" asked the detective. "Well, give them to
me." He glanced at the paper the girl found for him. "Not much
good," he said. "Nothing here. Good morning," and he turned to go
out, but then stopped suddenly. "Oh, I forgot, any trunk calls
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "one for London. Marylebone 3075. Just
now, from the asylum."</p>

<p>The detective sighed. "No good either." He glanced sharply at
the girl. "Been on duty all the time today?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I take all the calls."</p>

<p>"Good girl," said the detective smiling, and he waved his
hand. "Good luck! Good-bye."</p>

<p>He jumped back in the car. "Marylebone 3075, young man," he
said, "and don't you forget it. Jot it down."</p>

<p>Half an hour later and having left the big police car in the
station yard at Colchester, the three detectives made their way
on foot to the building and decorating firm of Smith &amp;
Rattery.</p>

<p>Passing a small jeweller's and optician's shop in the main
street, Larose caught sight of some aluminium field glasses in
the window.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed, pointing out the glasses to his
companions, "they're the very spit of the ones the butler had.
Let's go and see if he bought his here."</p>

<p>They went into the shop and at Larose's request a pair of the
glasses was taken from the window.</p>

<p>"No," said the detective, after a moment's inspection. "I'm
afraid they're not powerful enough for what I want."</p>

<p>"But, of course, sir," replied the proprietor of the shop,
"you realise that they are quite inexpensive. You can hardly
expect much for thirty shillings. They are only a job line, but
they're good value for the money."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," smiled Larose affably, "they're cheap, right
enough," and then he added. "I think you sold one to a man I know
at Great Oakley. A Mr. Jakes, if you remember him."</p>

<p>The shop man nodded his head. "Quite well," he replied. "Dr.
Shillington's butler, you mean. I've known him for many years. We
attend to the clocks at the asylum." He seemed apologetic. "Of
course, as I say again, these glasses are not high-class ones,
but&mdash;" and he smiled, "they would answer Mr. Jake's purpose.
He said he only wanted them for just about a mile."</p>

<p>They left the shop and then Larose whistled. "Now that makes
things much easier," he exclaimed. "Only a mile! Great Scot! I
must get that situation."</p>

<p>They were at Smith &amp; Rattery's in another hundred yards.
It was quite a fair-sized establishment in a side street just off
the main one, and it was faced in front by a large shop, in the
window of which were displayed a selection of baths, basins,
fireplaces and other articles appertaining to the building
trade.</p>

<p>"Let's walk by first," said Larose quickly. "I want to see
what it's like outside. Go slowly, please."</p>

<p>They walked by as the Australian suggested, and then when
turning to retrace their steps, Stone asked curiously, "What the
devil was that for now? One builder's shop is much the same as
another, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"But I wanted to see if it was a lockup one," replied Larose,
"and it is."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll go in now," he said. "We've a lot to do, and we
mustn't waste time."</p>

<p>But Larose suddenly laid his hand upon the detective's
arm.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said hurriedly, "is it absolutely necessary,
do you think, that we take these men into our confidence? They
may mean to act quite all right with us, but they may be
indiscreet and give the whole thing away." He spoke with great
earnestness. "You see, we're risking everything, letting them
know anything at all."</p>

<p>Carter regarded him with a frown. "But what else can we do,
young man," he said, "if we are to get the information that we
want?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought&mdash;" replied Larose, and he hesitated, "I
thought perhaps I might be able to act on my own without
troubling anybody." He inclined his head in the direction of the
builders' shop. "That's only a lockup place, you know, and I
could get in to-night and go through the books. They're certain
to keep proper wages lists, a big firm like that."</p>

<p>"But how get in?" asked Carter aghast. "Break in, do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly," replied Larose, looking slightly
embarrassed, "but you see, I'm rather handy with a bit of wire,
and as there's a skylight over the shop, I notice, I shouldn't
have much difficulty in getting in. I could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, young man," interrupted Carter, sharply, "but
that's not our way over here." He smiled grimly "I don't doubt
your capacity for a moment, but&mdash;&mdash;" he shook his head,
"we can't let you do that," and he started to walk back in the
direction of the shop.</p>

<p>Stone winked at Larose. "You're a nice prize-packet," he
whispered, and then he buttoned up his coat tightly and pretended
to look alarmed. "Now I hope you haven't taken a fancy to my
watch, by any chance, thinking it may keep better time than
yours." He nodded his head vigorously. "Well, if I miss it I
shall know where it's gone."</p>

<p>But Larose did not laugh; he sighed instead. "You're slow over
here," was his only comment.</p>

<p>The three detectives advanced into the shop and enquired for
the head of the firm.</p>

<p>"This way," said an assistant, and he led them to a
comfortably furnished office at the back of the shop.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rattery," he called out, "gentlemen, to see you," and
with no further ceremony he ushered them into the office and
closed the door behind them. A stout man immediately rose up from
a desk and at once came forward. He was bright and happy looking.
He had a round face with a good fresh complexion and big blue
eyes. His expression was open and frank.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, gentlemen?" he asked respectfully.</p>

<p>"You're one of the heads of the firm?" queried Carter,
sharply.</p>

<p>The stout man bowed. "I am the head." He smiled. "Mr. Smith's
been dead many years. I'm the firm."</p>

<p>Carter handed him his card. "Well, we're from Scotland Yard,"
he said; and then, to soften down the shock he saw he was
undoubtedly giving, he smiled affably and added, "We've come on a
very confidential mission, Mr. Rattery, and to ask a great favor
of you."</p>

<p>The builder looked nervous. "From Scotland Yard!" he
ejaculated. He shook his head. "I've no idea why you've come." He
motioned towards some chairs. "But please sit down,
gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Rattery," said Carter very solemnly when they were
all seated, "we're trusting you a lot in coming here, for we're
putting you in possession of information that, as yet, no one in
all England knows, except we three. You understand?"</p>

<p>"I'm honored," said Mr. Rattery, recovering a little, "I'm
honored, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"And we're nothing to do with the Essex police," went on
Carter. "We're headquarters' men, and we've come direct from
London, here."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mr. Rattery, and he opened his blue eyes very wide.
"It's something grave, then."</p>

<p>"Yes, the trouble is this," said Carter, and he lowered his
voice to quiet and confidential tones. "We're on the special
investigation of those crimes that have been occurring recently
about here. The robberies and murders at those country
houses&mdash;at Layham Hall, for instance, at the Manor House in
Sudbury, and at White Notley Towers."</p>

<p>"I know them all," said the stout builder, now very pale in
the face, "I've been doing work there, at every one of those
places."</p>

<p>"Of course you have," smiled Carter, "and that's why we've
come to you. That's the very reason why we're here now. You see,
it's like this, Mr. Rattery," and he raised his hand to emphasise
his point. "When these houses were robbed they were done so by
wretches who knew exactly how to find their way about. They were
gone through by robbers who knew all the situations of every
room, who knew every staircase and every corridor, who were
acquainted as to how the doors and windows opened and also as to
where the alarms were set. In brief, these men must have been
supplied with plans somehow, and what we think&mdash;&mdash;" the
detective's voice grew very stern, "what we have reason to
believe is, that it was one of your men who furnished them with
these plans."</p>

<p>The builder looked frightened.</p>

<p>"But I can't believe," he said shakily, "that any of my
employees would act like that. I'm so particular whom I employ
and I've never had any complaints before." A note of pride crept
into his voice. "I have had a very large connection in the
district for many years, and I work for some of the best people
in the shire."</p>

<p>"We know you do," said Carter warmly, "and we know the
respect, too, in which your firm is held, but
still&mdash;&mdash;" and he smiled sadly, "I'm afraid a black
sheep must have crept somehow into your flock." His voice became
brisk and matter of fact. "Well, Mr. Rattery, what we want of you
is this. Now, you employ a good many men, don't you?"</p>

<p>"From fifty to a hundred in the busy times," replied the
builder, "but I haven't so many on my books just now."</p>

<p>"Well, can you tell us," said the detective, "can you give us
the names of any men who worked at all those three houses I
mentioned? At Layham Hall, in Sudbury, and at White Notley
Towers."</p>

<p>"Certainly, I can," replied the builder, "if indeed any of my
men happened to have been sent to all of those places in turn
which, for my sake, I hope not, and which I think also is wholly
improbable, for I had a great rush of work in the early months of
the year," and he rose from his chair and took down a big ledger
from off a shelf.</p>

<p>He began looking from one page to another in the book, and
there was complete silence in the room.</p>

<p>Larose hardly breathed. His theory was about to be put to the
test, and if it were found wanting he would be toppling from his
little pedestal at once. He watched the builder's face with
anxious eyes.</p>

<p>For a few moments Mr. Rattery looked quite undisturbed; he was
smiling, even, with a confident air. But suddenly he frowned;
then it was obvious that he was uneasy, and finally his jaw
dropped and he gave a great sigh.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry to say you're right to begin with," he said.
"Two of the same men were on all those three jobs. Tom Rutley and
Fred Duke." He smiled wanly. "But one of them's quite impossible
at all events. Old Tom's worked for us for over thirty years, and
I would stake my life on his honesty. He's a most respectable
family man."</p>

<p>"Tell us where he lives, then," said Carter, "and we'll make
some enquiries on our own. But about this other man,
Duke&mdash;what of him?"</p>

<p>"He's a good workman," replied the builder slowly, "and very
intelligent, and I've been employing him now, on and off, for
over a year. He's about thirty, and a single man, I believe."</p>

<p>"Well, we must have a look at them both," said Carter. "Are
they working for you now?"</p>

<p>The builder gave a quiet laugh. "Yes," he replied, "and
funnily enough, they're both working together close here at the
present moment." He looked at his watch. "Yes, if you go to the
Mid-Essex bank just opposite the Cups Hotel, you'll find them
both on the outside of the building there. They're painters, and
you can't mix them up." He smiled. "Rutley's stout like me, and
Duke is a slight dark man, quiet and rather refined looking."</p>

<p>The detectives rose up to go, and then Carter said very
solemnly&mdash;-</p>

<p>"But we can depend on you, Mr. Rattery, can't we? Not a word
even to your wife, you promise?"</p>

<p>The builder nodded. "Quite all right, sir," he said quietly.
"No one shall get a word out of me."</p>

<p>"But I distrust that man," remarked Larose when they were out
in the street. "I wish you had let me do as I wanted to, and find
out in my own."</p>

<p>Carter turned on him in a flash. "Distrust him!" he snarled.
"Well, you're not much of a judge of character then. Why, one
look at the man and you can see he's as open as the day."</p>

<p>"That's just what I meant," replied Larose meekly. "He won't
be able to look this Duke in the face now, and if Duke's got an
uneasy conscience, he'll see there's something up at once."</p>

<p>Carter snorted, but made no comment. Stone chuckled, and on
the quiet gave the Australian a dig in the ribs.</p>

<p>They were at the Bank in a very few minutes, and there right
enough they saw the two men, painting. The latter were suspended
in a cradle from the coping of the roof, but as the cradle was
not far off from the ground, the detectives could take in
everything about them quite easily. The street was the main one
in the town and wide, and full of people, so there was no danger
of their quarry noticing them as they watched.</p>

<p>They picked out Duke at once. He was slim and wiry-looking,
and was smoking a cigarette. He had big brown eyes, and as he
plied his brush, they roved interestedly from side to side upon
the passers by on the pavement beneath him.</p>

<p>"He doesn't miss much," growled Stone, "and he's got the
restless look of a man who knows he's got to step carefully
wherever he goes."</p>

<p>"He's a painter," remarked Carter drily, "and as he often has
to work at heights, that would naturally make him careful,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Now don't you be jealous, Elias," said Stone reprovingly,
"because the idea came to me before it did to you." He grinned at
Larose. "We're all in co. on this job, remember."</p>

<p>They watched the two men at their work for a minute or so and
then Stone said suddenly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, I've got another brain-wave and I'm going to try it out.
You two get to the other side of the road and keep an eye on our
friends from there. I'm going up the street a bit but I'll be
back in two shakes and you'll see what I mean," and taking it for
granted that they would follow his directions, he left them at
once and moved off among the pedestrians.</p>

<p>"Better do what he says," grunted Carter, "as I told you he's
got more sense than you'd think and there's probably something in
what he's going to do," and they crossed the road and took up
their station just in front of 'The Cups' Hotel.</p>

<p>With a better point of view of the whole street now, they saw
Stone go up to a policeman about a hundred yards away. A short
colloquy followed and then the big detective rejoined them,
looking as if he were very amused about something.</p>

<p>"Smart chap, that constable," he grinned. "He recognised me
almost before I made myself known, and he took his instruction
without any explanations, like a lamb. Now you watch. He's going
to walk three times past that bank in as many minutes and I bet
you, friend Duke never takes his eyes off him once. If he's a
crook, he'll know the police are his natural enemies and he'll be
interested in any one of them, at any time, accordingly, and he
won't be able to keep himself from showing it."</p>

<p>And three minutes later Charlie Stone rubbed his hands
together and chuckled.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;wasn't I right?" he said. "The beggar never took
his eyes off him once after he'd caught sight of him. And did you
notice he dropped his cigarette even, in his excitement when
Robert went by the third time."</p>

<p>"If I had that man," commented Carter solemnly, "for ten
minutes to myself, I'd turn him inside out and see down to the
very bottom of his soul. He's got a weak chin and&mdash;&mdash;"
the lanky detective squared his jaws together "by Gad! I've half
a mind to try."</p>

<p>"No, no, Elias," objected Stone hastily, "not yet. We must be
deeper in it before we show our hands. He might be harder to deal
with than you think, for if he's a member of this gang, you can
bet your life that they wouldn't be trusting their skins to a man
who was too much of a fool. Besides, if he has got a weak chin,
which I grant you, he's not got a bad facial angle, and he's got
good eyes. No it'd be too much of a gamble to tackle him straight
away now. We must shadow him first."</p>

<p>"Well," said Carter grudgingly, "we know where he lives, and
we'll put Stevens on him before night." He thought for a moment.
"Yes, Stevens would be best. He's been in the building line
himself, once."</p>

<p>They returned to the police station and picking up their car,
five minutes later were proceeding at a rapid pace towards
London.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE NEW BUTLER.</h2>

<p class="first">THAT same evening, a few minutes before 5
o'clock, the two detectives, Carter and Stone, followed at a
respectful distance by a quietly dressed man, who exhibited all
over him the unmistakable stamp of 'gentleman's servant,' entered
the palatial vestibule of the Elite Service Bureau in South
Audley-street, and enquired of the uniformed attendant for the
proprietor.</p>

<p>"Appointment at five," said the lanky detective curtly. "Name
of Carter."</p>

<p>"Take a seat, gentlemen, will you please," replied the
attendant, "and I'll inform Mr. Channing at once."</p>

<p>The detectives seated themselves upon a rich tapestry-covered
divan, but their companion was content to remain standing a short
distance away. There were a few other callers waiting, and they
eyed the newcomers interestedly.</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Stone, looking round at the beautiful
decorating and smart furnishings of the place. "What a swanky
show! They must make some money here to keep up all this. Nothing
cheap about, anywhere."</p>

<p>"The swellest registry office in London," grunted Carter.
"They cater only for the aristocracy and the big county families,
and they charge like hell. Run by an ex-service man and a bit of
an aristocrat, too, himself, they say." His eyes in turn wandered
round. "Yes, and by gosh, he's got some taste."</p>

<p>Stone chuckled suddenly. "But look at that young devil," he
whispered, pointing to their silent companion, "he was born in
some pantry, I'll swear, and he's been kept all his life
polishing forks and spoons. Did you ever see anything like him
now, and the way he looks the part?"</p>

<p>"He's an actor, Charlie," sighed Stone, "and he beats you and
me there. We've no one to come up to him in the Yard."</p>

<p>The attendant re-appeared. "This way, please, gentlemen," he
said. "Mr. Channing will see you at once," and the detectives,
now closely followed by their sedate companion, were conducted
along a thickly carpeted passage to a large room.</p>

<p>A man was seated before a big desk of many pigeon-holes, but
he rose at once when his visitors were announced. He was good-looking and of an aristocratic appearance. He had a strong,
reliant face, with big, calm, grey eyes. He was about forty years
of age, and he held himself like a soldier.</p>

<p>The two detectives, with no ceremony, advanced briskly to the
desk, but their companion, who had apparently now lost all his
recent alertness, remained standing deferentially by the door. An
acute observer, however, would have noticed that he had
unobtrusively made quite sure that the door was securely closed
behind him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Channing?" asked Carter, and the man at the desk inclined
his head gravely.</p>

<p>"At your service, gentlemen. What can I&mdash;&mdash;" he
began, and then his eyes stared wonderingly behind Carter. His
lips parted, a wave of surprise seemed to surge over his face,
and then he suddenly darted forward with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Quartermaster," he exclaimed delightedly, "how do you do,
Charlie Stone?" He laughed merrily. "Now don't say you've
forgotten me. You haven't, surely?"</p>

<p>"Good Lord! No, Major," gasped the big detective, and his
voice trembled. "But fancy you're being here," and they gripped
hands together, as if they would never leave go.</p>

<p>"Never seen you since that day before Amiens," went on Stone
huskily. "You remember that time, sir?"</p>

<p>"Bless your heart, yes," laughed the grey-eyed man. "We were
in that dugout, and you gave me a bottle of beer."</p>

<p>"No, no," laughed back Stone, "only half, Sir, if you
recollect. We shared the bottle together."</p>

<p>"Ah! so we did, Quartermaster," said the ex-major, and then
his face was suddenly very solemn, "and we both nearly went West
directly after!"</p>

<p>"And it would have been 'quite'&mdash;not 'nearly,' Sir," said
Stone with equal seriousness, "if you hadn't been so ready with
your pistol." He nodded his head gravely. "Four, with four shots
wasn't bad, you know. You were on the mark every time."</p>

<p>The grey-eyed man laughed again. "And as my memory serves me,
Quartermaster, you were pretty handy too, with that bayonet you
picked up. You didn't give the other three much chance, now did
you?"</p>

<p>They talked on animatedly for a couple of minutes or so, with
both of them, apparently, quite oblivious of their surroundings,
but then Mr. Channing stopped suddenly in the middle of a
sentence and turned apologetically to the other detective.</p>

<p>"Forgive us, Mr. Carter," he said, smiling. "We are old
comrades-in-arms, you see, and such a rush of memories stirred
through me when I recognised him just now." He beamed once more
on Stone, and then resuming his seat, his voice became at once
cold and matter-of-fact. "But now to business, gentlemen, what
can I do for you?"</p>

<p>Carter came at once to the point. "You are sending down a
butler to Dr. Shillington, of Oakley Court, to-morrow," he said,
sharply. "Are you not?"</p>

<p>"A temporary one," Mr. Channing replied, "until the permanent
one I have selected for the post is free." He frowned. "But how
do you come to know it?"</p>

<p>Carter ignored his question. "And are you aware," he asked,
"exactly under what circumstances this unexpected need for a
temporary butler has arisen?"</p>

<p>Mr. Channing nodded. "Yes, Dr. Shillington informed me that
his butler had died very suddenly last night."</p>

<p>Carter sniffed. "Yes, very suddenly," he remarked drily. He
looked the ex-major straight in the face. "The man was murdered,
sir."</p>

<p>"Good God!" ejaculated Mr. Channing. "And why didn't the
doctor tell me?"</p>

<p>"But haven't you seen this evening's paper, then?" asked the
detective.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, "not yet. I don't get one generally until
I leave the office."</p>

<p>Carter spoke in a quick, decisive tone. "Yes, Mr. Channing,"
he went on, "the butler was murdered last night, and it is that,
that brings us here. We are concerned now with the discovery of
the murderer, and with that object in view we want to substitute
one of our own men for the butler you are sending down to Oakley
Court to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh!" commented Mr. Channing, "if that be all, it should
easily be arranged. We have only to get Dr. Shillington's
permission, and then I am completely in your hands," and he
stretched towards the telephone upon his desk.</p>

<p>"But one moment, please," exclaimed Carter hastily, and his
jaws went together in a snap. "Dr. Shillington is the last man on
earth that should know what we are doing."</p>

<p>Mr. Channing frowned. "What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I mean," said Carter quietly, "that the identity of the man
who goes down to the asylum must be kept from the doctor at all
costs."</p>

<p>Mr. Channing looked puzzled. "I don't understand," he said.
"Will you please explain?"</p>

<p>The detective's voice was very stern. "It's like this, Mr.
Channing," he said. "Murder has been done in that house and we
have formed very definite suspicions about someone. We are pretty
sure we are on the right track, but in order to verify our
suspicion we want to get one of our men into the house so that he
can carry out certain investigations, unknown to any of the
inmates. Now we learnt by chance that you are sending a temporary
butler down for three weeks." Carter smiled persuasively, "and we
thought it would give us the very opportunity that we
wanted."</p>

<p>The handsome face of the proprietor of the Elite Service
Bureau was quite expressionless. "And so, as I understand it, Mr.
Carter," he said very quietly, "you suggest that I shall take a
fee from Dr. Shillington for furnishing him with a servant
suitable to his requirements, and&mdash;" a note of scorn crept
into his voice, "and plant a spy into his household, instead." He
shook his head indignantly. "No, sir. It can't be done. It's
against all my principles. That's not the way in which I conduct
this bureau."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Channing," said Carter sternly, "you don't
understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put all the cards on the table, Elias," broke in Stone
abruptly. "The major's as white as they make 'em, and we can
trust him all the way. Half confidences are no good here."</p>

<p>For just a moment Carter hesitated, but then apparently
realising that there was no help for it, he did as his colleague
had suggested and frankly put the Service Bureau proprietor in
possession of all that had happened that day.</p>

<p>Mr. Channing seemed at first inclined to hold to his
indignation, but as the recital wore on, the hard look on his
features relaxed, and in the end he was regarding the detective
with amiability again.</p>

<p>"My word," he exclaimed when Carter had finished, "but what a
charge to bring against Dr. Shillington, with the position that
he holds in his profession. He is easily the foremost mental
specialist in the kingdom, and although I admit I've never liked
the man, there can be no doubt as to his importance in the
medical world."</p>

<p>"He's mad probably." said Carter. "They say you can always
pick out an asylum doctor from among any number of his brethren.
From living so much among crook people, they get mental
themselves."</p>

<p>Mr. Channing looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I shall have to agree," he said reluctantly,
"although I very much dislike the part you are making me play,"
he smiled again at Stone, "and I think, if it were not for my old
quartermaster here, I really should even now refuse."</p>

<p>"But you're not compromising yourself dishonorably in any
way," smiled back Stone, "for if Dr. Shillington is guilty you've
rendered a distinct public service, and, if he's
innocent,"&mdash;the big man shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"well,
you're helping us to clear him of a very serious charge."</p>

<p>"And in the latter case," added Carter, "we promise you he
shall never know that you have intervened. He will never learn
who the temporary butler was."</p>

<p>"But, look here, gentlemen," said Mr. Channing, and he
frowned, "if under your importunities I am willing to throw my
own private honor into the melting pot, please understand that I
am not willing at any cost to belittle the reputation of this
service bureau of mine." He smiled drily. "So I tell you,
frankly, that the man whom you select to go down to Dr.
Shillington's must be an efficient one and fully capable of
carrying out all his duties or else&mdash;he does not go down at
all." He spoke most emphatically. "One thing I always do
guarantee to my clients and that is&mdash;capacity. So I'll have
no clumsy amateur, please, with false whiskers representing the
bureau. The doctor is a shrewd man and would fire any bungler at
once, and then I should have done violence to all my principles
and injured my business without any compensating results
whatsoever."</p>

<p>"Oh! you needn't worry there, Mr. Channing," said Carter
confidently. "This man we've brought here with us will do you
credit, I promise you, and you can put him through his paces
now."</p>

<p>"Hum!" muttered Mr. Channing, and for the first time since his
visitors had arrived he bent his gaze reflectively across the
long room towards the man who was standing by the door. "So
that's he, is it?" he said very quietly. "Well, I must say, he
doesn't look too intelligent. He doesn't appear to me to have
much kick."</p>

<p>"I've not known him yet 12 hours, sir," sighed Carter
mournfully, "but I'd exchange my brain for his, any day. He's
most extraordinary."</p>

<p>Mr. Channing beckoned with his hand and the man who had been
standing so quietly by the door, came deferentially forward. The
service bureau proprietor took careful stock of him for a long
moment, and the inspection was apparently satisfactory.</p>

<p>"So you are a gentleman's servant?" he snapped. "You're a
butler, already?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the man with great respect.</p>

<p>"Know all your duties?" asked Mr. Channing. "Understand
pantry-work and cellar-work, beside waiting on table? Can valet
as well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Where was your last place?"</p>

<p>"In Sydney, New South Wales, with the Chief Commissioner of
Police."</p>

<p>"Ah! An Australian. Then how long have you been in
England?"</p>

<p>"A fortnight since yesterday, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Channing frowned. "Then who over here can speak for your
efficiency?"</p>

<p>Carter broke in quickly. "We'll stand for his character, Mr.
Channing," he said. "He's well known to headquarters here."</p>

<p>"But his capacity, Mr. Carter?" said Mr. Channing with
irritation. "I must know something about that."</p>

<p>"Sir," interrupted the man himself very gravely, "I should not
be offering myself if I were not quite capable, for I am aware it
is a dangerous house I am going into and that I am running
considerable risk. I do not forget how the last butler met his
death, and if our suspicions are correct, then the slightest slip
on my part and I may come to the same end."</p>

<p>"So, so," said Mr. Channing with a suspicion of sarcasm in his
voice, "then you have dabbled in crime work, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the man.</p>

<p>Mr. Channing stared hard for quite a long time, and then he
rapped out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what's your name, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"William Wilkin&mdash;&mdash;" began the man, but Carter broke
in sharply.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said sternly, and he addressed himself direct to
Mr. Channing, "that's not his name. It's Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>The ex-major sat up with a jerk, his eyes opened wide, and he
stared wonderingly at the shabby-looking man in black. Then for
the second time that evening he stepped impulsively forward and
held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Gilbert Larose, the detective, of New South Wales!" he
exclaimed, and his face was now all wreathed in smiles.
"Delighted to meet you, I'm sure. I know a lot about and of the
marvellous things you've done. I was in Sydney four years ago,
just after you'd caught the Botanical Gardens murderer, and
everyone was talking about you then." He turned reproachfully to
Carter&mdash;"But why didn't you tell me at once who he was and
I'd have accepted him as a matter of course, without demur. His
reputation in Australia is so good that I could not have
refused."</p>

<p>"But we never knew that you were likely to have heard of him,"
frowned Carter. "He was a fairy tale to me even before
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll get everything ship-shape now," said Mr. Channing
briskly, "without any further delay. Sit down, please, Mr.
Larose, and I'll tell you about the man whose place you will be
taking to-morrow. There are several things it will be necessary
for you to know."</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that Gilbert Larose caught the
Colchester express at Liverpool-street next day, to embark, had
he only known it, upon one of the most dangerous expeditions of
his adventurous career.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; THE HOUSE WITH A SECRET.</h2>

<p class="first">IT was a sad-eyed and very meek-looking man who
the following afternoon stood waiting by the bookstall at
Colchester Station, and no one who paused to regard him
critically could possibly have been very far out in determining
exactly what he was. He was a man accustomed to receive orders,
to do what he was told, and to watch, without envy, whilst others
partook of the good things of life. 'In service,' was surely how
he earned his daily bread and to be at someone's beck and call
was undoubtedly the only vocation meet and proper for the
temperament that was so obviously his.</p>

<p>"A regular turnip," was how Jameson, Dr. Shillington's
chauffeur, summed him up when he first caught sight of him and
guessed it was the man he had been sent to meet.</p>

<p>"Your name Fred Mason?" he asked roughly. "You're going to
Oakley Court?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the meek and mild man gently. "I was told to
wait here."</p>

<p>"Right-o!" said the chauffeur, "you're set. Follow me," and he
strode off to a big limousine that was parked in the station
yard. "Get in," he added laconically, "throw your luggage into
the back." He looked surprised. "But is that all you've got, that
parcel there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the man. "I've only come for three weeks, and I
haven't brought much."</p>

<p>"Three weeks!" echoed the chauffeur and he laughed coarsely,
"It mayn't even be as long as that. Butlers don't live long down
here." He eyed the man intently. "You've heard something, I
expect."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the man meekly. "I read the newspaper this
morning."</p>

<p>"And you're not afraid?" asked the chauffeur, puckering up his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"No," replied the man, "I don't expect it will happen another
time, and the wages are good."</p>

<p>The chauffeur grinned and seemed inclined to modify his first
opinion. "Well, you've got some pluck in you, old bean; more than
I would have said from the look of your dial." He became more
friendly. "No, I was only joking. You'll be quite safe with us.
The police are too darned busy, now the birds have flown."</p>

<p>They drove leisurely through the crowded streets and were well
out of the town before the chauffeur spoke again.</p>

<p>"Teetotal?" he asked, looking round at the silent figure by
his side.</p>

<p>"No-o," replied Larose, "not exactly."</p>

<p>"Nor me either," affirmed the chauffeur emphatically. "I take
a drop when I feel inclined, which usually happens when there's
any about." He smacked his lips. "We'll have one now."</p>

<p>They pulled up at a little village inn, and the chauffeur
ordered two beers, which they each consumed in their own
different ways. The chauffeur as if it were a duty to be got over
quickly, and the new butler timidly, and as if it were an
unaccustomed treat.</p>

<p>"Now, will you have one with me," said the latter gently,
noticing that the chauffeur was staring gloomily at the empty
glasses.</p>

<p>"Too right I will, and we'll sit down, if you don't mind. My
pins is not too steady to-day. I had a skinful last night.
There's no hurry. Old Shillington always has a snooze after
lunch, and we'll be home long before he's awake."</p>

<p>They sat down in a corner of the tap-room, and Larose eyed the
chauffeur covertly. He was not prepared to take any risks unduly,
and he had to be deadly sure as to how far the man might be in
his master's confidence. But if the detective were cautious he
was no laggard in making up his mind, and a very few minutes
sufficed to convince him that the chauffeur was harmless. Here
was no plotter, he told himself; no finely tempered steel out of
which to fashion a dagger for intrigue. No, no one would trust
great issues to this fellow. He was good-natured, but weak and
alcoholic, and all the acting in the world could not simulate
that trembling mouth and those tired bleary eyes.</p>

<p>So Larose opened the ball promptly, and, bringing up the
murder, was quickly in possession of all the local gossip.</p>

<p>The doctor was not a bit upset about what had happened, he was
informed; and, indeed, seemed to regard the butler's death almost
as if it were an ordinary everyday affair, but then Shillington
was always callous, accustomed as he was to knocking the loonies
about. But he wasn't a bad master, and left you alone as long as
you did your work. He never took much notice of anyone. He was a
little god inside the asylum walls, and everybody was afraid of
him. No, it hadn't been found out how the robbers had got in, but
the general opinion was they had come quietly through the lodge
gates with a faked key, after the lodge-keeper and his missus had
gone to bed. They hadn't got over the walls anyhow, because the
damned police had been all round with magnifying glasses and had
found no scratchings anywhere. Jakes wasn't a bad fellow, quite a
simple chap, and the Lord only knew what had taken him out into
the drive where he was killed. No, no one heard noises, but he,
the chauffeur, imagined now that he had heard a rat moving about
in the garage sometime during that night. Yes, he slept over the
garage and had quite a decent room. Shillington often had
visitors in to lunch, and occasionally in to dinner. The lunch
visitors were mostly those who were relations of the loonies.
Shillington always did things in style, and had the best of foods
and wines, even when he was alone. The three girls at the house
weren't bad, but they thought a lot of themselves, and Smithers,
the parlor-maid, had boxed his ears once when he got a bit spoony
with her.</p>

<p>All these and many other interesting little bits of
information were poured into the willing ears of Larose, and,
indeed, he proved so intelligent a listener that it was with
extreme reluctance when, after a fourth glass of beer, the
chauffeur announced finally that they must go.</p>

<p>The journey to the asylum was then continued in great heart,
and following apparently upon their refreshment at the inn, of so
swift and fearless a nature was their progress through the narrow
lanes that the detective really began to believe that by far the
most hazardous portion of his investigations must surely have
been accomplished when he was deposited safe and sound at the
asylum door.</p>

<p>Smithers, the parlor-maid, then at once took charge of him and
having been instructed during the afternoon as to his various
duties, at dinner time, his intimate association with Dr.
Shillington began.</p>

<p>The doctor was dining by himself that night and after a brief
word and a hard stare at his new menial, he sank into a
contemplative silence as if he were quite alone in the room.</p>

<p>Deftly and noiselessly Larose ministered to his wants and so
quiet and peaceful and orderly was the whole atmosphere of the
room that many times the detective found himself wondering if his
suspicions could possibly have any solid foundation of fact.</p>

<p>Here was a room where everything spoke of the refinement of
life. The expensive Jacobean table and chairs, the shining silver
and bright cutlery, the crystal glasses and the beautiful
flowers, the dainty mats, the pictures upon the walls, the carpet
into which one imagined one sank ankle deep&mdash;everything
struck the right note and contributed to suggest a perfect
harmony of content and peace.</p>

<p>And then the man himself. A gentleman&mdash;cold, dignified
and proud, with the ease and confidence inherited from many
forebears who in their times, too, had possessed qualities and
advantages that had lifted them above their fellows. A man of
education and culture, a man of eminence in his profession, a
man&mdash;but Larose blinked his eyes hard and reminded himself
brutally how often had not the most criminal of minds been found
in association in just such surroundings as these.</p>

<p>And the detective would no doubt have congratulated himself
upon the practical commonsense of his conclusions had he been the
fly upon the wall in Dr. Shillington's study later in the
evening.</p>

<p>At half-past eight a visitor called to see the doctor. He was
a well-dressed man about five and thirty, and he had a handsome,
but rather dissipated face, with bright flashing eyes. He did not
look in over strong health, however. He regarded Larose
interestedly.</p>

<p>"I'm Colonel Jasper, a friend of Dr. Shillington," he said in
a pleasant, even voice, with a slight drawl. "He'll see me if you
tell him that I'm here."</p>

<p>"Very good, Sir," replied Larose and he bade him wait a moment
while he informed the doctor.</p>

<p>"Show him in," said Dr. Shillington, "and then put out the
spirits and some glasses. I shan't want you any more to-night
after that."</p>

<p>The colonel was ushered in and he and the doctor greeted each
other in a friendly way. They chatted in ordinary conversational
tones whilst Larose was getting out the tantalus and arranging
the glasses upon the table, but the instant the door was closed
behind him, the colonel sidled up to Dr. Shillington, and,
dropping his voice to a whisper, demanded quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"And what the hell's been going on here?"</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington's eyes were round as saucers. "I had to do
it," he whispered back hoarsely. "The man knew about us, and he
was as dangerous as a bomb."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper's face blanched a little under his tan. "Knew
about us?" he echoed frowningly. "What do you mean? What did he
know?"</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington lifted his hand. "You needn't worry," he said
quickly, "it's all right now. The danger's gone." He looked
intently at the colonel. "But he'd guessed something and I had to
silence him&mdash;in the only way I could."</p>

<p>The colonel sank into an armchair. "I'm not frightened," he
said slowly. "Nothing frightens me, as you ought to know. But to-day's not one of my good days, and I'm feeling chippy,
somehow."</p>

<p>"Have some brandy, then," said Dr. Shillington, and he poured
out a stiff measure and handed it over. "Now I'll explain," he
went on, "and although I know I ran some risk in getting rid of
Jakes as I did, yet I'm sure you'll all agree that I acted
rightly."</p>

<p>"It rattled us," drawled the colonel, his color now coming
back, "and Sarle cursed like hell when we got the papers this
afternoon. We'd not heard a word about it before, and
then&mdash;good God! to think that the damned 'tecs had been
ferreting about within half a mile of us. Yes, it rattled us, and
I've come over to find out everything."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington drew his chair up close to his
companion's.</p>

<p>"Jasper," he said in some excitement, and his eyes roamed
round into every corner of the room, "you tell them we were
living in a paradise of fools, and it was imagination only that
made us think no one could find things out." He leant forward and
laid his hand upon the colonel's arm. "Jakes found things out.
Yes, Jakes, the simple fool, stumbled blindly upon what the
police would give their right hands to know. He guessed I had
something to do with the Iron Man, and that you and Sarle and
Edgehill were mixed up in it, too."</p>

<p>"But how, man?" asked Colonel Jasper irritably. "Did you talk
in your sleep?"</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington glared at the speaker.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Jasper," he said testily, "the matter's been
far too serious I tell you." He pursed up his lips. "And even now
things may not turn out to be too pleasant for us. There's the
inquest to come yet, and the police surgeon saw at once that some
technical knowledge had been used in getting rid of Jakes. I
knocked him down and tried to suffocate him when he was stunned.
But he began to come to and struggled, and in consequence he was
slightly cyanosed when he died. There was a bluish tinge about
him that looked ugly."</p>

<p>"But how had he found anything out?" scowled the colonel. "You
haven't told me that yet."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington lifted his hand again. "He kept a diary,
Jasper. A silly, childish book of everything that happened in his
humdrum life and alongside what occurred here, he put down things
too that he read day by day in the newspapers. He put down every
date when I went away and every time when it was recorded that
there had been raids at those different country houses." The
doctor lowered his voice again to a whisper. "And one day about
two months ago, he suddenly noticed certain strange coincidences.
He became aware that I was always away from home when these
attacks had occurred, that you had always come for me in your
motor car the day before, and that you and Sarle and Edgehill
invariably visited here a day or two after I got back. And
then&mdash;his suspicions awakened, he took to watching round
your house. He watched you and Sarle and Edgehill across the
marsh yonder, and he noticed that the motor launch had never been
in the boat house whenever a raid had been made. Then one day
again, he was lying hidden among the reeds, and he saw me leaving
with you in the launch, when I was supposed to be up in London at
my consulting rooms, and the next day he read that the Iron Man
had been at work again. All these things he put down in his
wretched book&mdash;I found it and burnt it when he was
dead&mdash;and then he got frightened that, in his own words, he
was living in a den of crime, and he gave notice to leave. He
wouldn't say why, although I pressed him. He was obstinate in his
refusal to give any explanation, and he continued obstinate until
the night before last, and then&mdash;&mdash;" the doctor glanced
round again at the windows and the door, "he blurted everything
out. He had brought in my cocoa as usual, and put it on the
table. I was writing at the desk here, but, looking up suddenly,
I saw he was staring at me with an extraordinary expression upon
his face, so extraordinary that I asked him sharply what he
meant. He pulled himself up with an effort and said 'Nothing.'
Then I told him he was lying, and he burst out, 'Better be a liar
than a criminal or a murderer anyhow.' I stared at him
thunderstruck, and he went on excitedly that he knew what he was
saying. He kept a diary, he said, and everything was written
down. This was an evil house. Crime was being hatched here, and
either you or I or Sarle or Edgehill were the Iron Man. He wasn't
going to stay on any longer, he should leave the next morning and
it was his duty to tell the police. I heard him out in silence
and then, when shaking all over, he turned to leave the room, I
struck him down. It didn't kill him, but&mdash;&mdash;I was
taking no risks and three minutes later he was dead."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington paused to wipe the perspiration from his
forehead.</p>

<p>"It was unfortunate that I had to do it here in this room, for
it messed up the carpet, and I was a long time getting out the
stains."</p>

<p>"Your methods were rather crude, doctor," drawled Colonel
Jasper frowning, "though they were certainly effective. But go
on."</p>

<p>"They were not crude," snapped the doctor irritably. "Another
30 seconds of unconsciousness and there would have been no
certain indication as to exactly how he had died. He wouldn't
have been cyanosed at all then, and it would have been assumed
that he had died from shock following upon an ordinary common
blow." He looked with some reproach upon his companion.
"Remember, I had to decide everything on the instant, without any
time for reflection, and it's easy enough for you to criticise me
now."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Doctor," drawled the Colonel. "I apologise. I am sure
you are a great artist in dispatching butlers, and did everything
that was best."</p>

<p>"Then," went on Dr. Shillington, as if he were totally
oblivious of any sarcasm in his companion's remark, "I carried
him out into the drive, as you must have read, and, returning,
searched his room. I had to be quick about it, however, for I
heard one of the maids stirring, and it would have been fatal for
me to have been found up there. But I took his diary, as I say,
and burnt it. It was damning in its simplicity, and would have
hanged us all. Then I hid away some pieces of my silver,
and&mdash;" the doctor sighed as if he were very sorry for
himself, "passed a sleepless night."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said the Colonel sympathetically, "after all you
had been through. It was enough to have shaken anybody." He
looked intently at the doctor. "And then yesterday you had the
cream of England's detectives up here. Two of the Big Four, I
see." A note of slight anxiety crept into his voice. "And how did
you get on with them at close quarters?"</p>

<p>"Oh! they were all right," said Dr. Shillington, frowning, "at
least Carter and Stone and the Chief Constable were. Them I could
easily manage." His frown deepened, "But there was another one
with them I didn't like. He was younger than they were, and I
admit he made me feel a bit uneasy. I thought all the time that
he was watching me&mdash;without looking at me, though&mdash;as I
am accustomed to watch a patient when I am determining if I shall
certify him as insane." The doctor shook himself as if he were
feeling cold. "Yes, curse him&mdash;it was imagination, of
course&mdash;but I thought, I thought somehow that his was a
master mind like mine."</p>

<p>The Colonel smiled covertly. "Nerves, my dear friend, and a
conscience that was not wholly innocent, so to speak." He helped
himself to some more brandy. "But who was he, did you learn?"</p>

<p>"No," sighed the doctor thoughtfully. "I know nothing about
him except that I heard the Chief Constable once call him 'Mr.
Larose.'"</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper started to his feet. "Larose! Larose!" he
exclaimed hoarsely "if it's the Sydney man it couldn't be worse.
He's a terrible one to have on your track." His drawl dropped
from him in his excitement. "Why, the C.I.D. chap in Sydney who
got Sarle's brother hanged three years ago, was called Larose.
Gilbert Larose, and it's been the dream of Sarle's life ever
since to go over to Australia some day and wipe him out." He sank
back into his chair. "No, no, it can't be the one, but
still&mdash;" He nodded his head. "I'll tell Sarle, and if
they're not keeping it secret we'll soon find out. Then if it
turns out to be the same man&mdash;" he dropped back into his
drawl, "Heaven help the poor wretch if Sarle gets him, for Sarle
is not over nice in his ways of killing, as you know."</p>

<p>And at that very moment, all unknowing of the interest he was
occasioning to Dr. Shillington's visitor, Larose was enjoying a
fragrant and satisfying meal of bread and cheese and onions in
the kitchen not fifty yards away.</p>

<p>He had soon installed himself in the good graces of the maids,
and the cook had already given it as her opinion that he was a
most gentlemanly man.</p>

<p>"About forty, I should say, dear," she whispered to the
parlor-maid, "and you mark my words, he's been crossed in love.
Very quiet, and he's got such a sad gentle smile. He's single, he
says."</p>

<p>Larose accepted the offer of a glass of ale and the generous
liquor appearing in part to soften his reserve, he began to enter
more into their conversation.</p>

<p>"It was a Colonel Jasper I opened the door to just now," he
remarked, "a friend of Dr. Shillington, he said he was."</p>

<p>"A great friend," smiled the cook, "Colonel Jasper lives at
the Priory, on the island just across the marshes, about a mile
from here. He's such a nice man, but, poor fellow, he's
consumptive, and some days he's got an awful cough."</p>

<p>Larose pricked up his ears at once. He had been already
wondering why the doctor and his visitor had so suddenly dropped
their voices the very instant he had left the room. As a matter
of pure routine he had stopped to listen for a few moments at the
door directly he had shut it, but all he had got for his pains
was a very faint muttering of their voices, although he had
plainly heard the sound as if one of them in the room had moved
in his chair. He had not dared to remain listening long.</p>

<p>"Yes, I noticed that he didn't look strong," he replied now to
the cook. "But does he live by himself?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, no," laughed the cook. "There are three other
gentlemen there, with an old woman to cook for them. You can see
the house from your bedroom window. It's a very old one, and they
say some monks used to live there once."</p>

<p>"How interesting!" remarked Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is interesting," said the parlor-maid. "You can, of
course, only get to the house by boat at high water, but at low
water you can drive a car over the stone causeway at the bottom
of the river. It's most romantic, I think."</p>

<p>"But it must be very awkward," said Larose, "for them to get
home when the tide's high. How do they manage it in a car
then?"</p>

<p>"Oh! there's a shed on this side," replied the girl, "and they
leave the car there then and cross over in a rowing boat. They've
got a fine motor launch, too, on the other side."</p>

<p>"It must be very lonely," said Larose. "What do they do?"</p>

<p>"Oh! shoot and fish, and they've got a golf course over on the
island." She laughed. "Yes, they enjoy themselves right enough,
and Colonel Jasper's always in the open-air, for his
consumption."</p>

<p>Larose soon dropped into the ways of the house, performing all
his duties deftly and in a fashion apparently quite satisfactory
to Dr. Shillington. At any rate, the great man made no
complaints, and, indeed, he hardly ever took any notice of his
servant at all. He never said good morning or good night, never
spoke to him except in the curtest manner possible, and accepted
all his ministrations without thanks and as if he were an
automaton or a thing of wood.</p>

<p>And Larose took it all in good part, and did not repine. For
were not all butlers supposed to be of different flesh and blood
from their employers, and had not Nature in her own wise way
ordained all down the ages that there should be always be orders
such as they two. The one who ordered and the one who served. The
great and the small. The master and the man.</p>

<p>For three days then, he seemed to get no further. He got
nothing definite for his role of service. There were plenty of
things that added to his suspicions, however, and the belief in
him strengthened almost with every hour that there was some dark
undercurrent of mystery running through Dr. Shillington's
life.</p>

<p>The man was by no means the intensely preoccupied student of
mental diseases that the world imagined, and he was not absorbed
only in the consideration of broken minds. Instead, he was a
restless and uneasy person, and he always seemed to be waiting
for something, Larose thought. He seized on the morning
newspapers directly they arrived, and then he would rapidly run
down the columns of the principal pages, apparently reading the
headings only, just as if he were on the look-out for some
particular item of news. Added to that, and contrary to all usual
custom, so Larose heard, the chauffeur was now sent into
Colchester every night to obtain the evening papers&mdash;a
journey of eight or nine miles each way.</p>

<p>Another thing, too, the doctor was always on the alert when
the telephone rang, and when Larose went in to his room to give
him a message or to tell him he was wanted, he was invariably
ready, and waiting, sometimes only just across the threshold. He
always had a troubled look of expectation, too, then, as if he
were prepared to hear some unpleasant piece of news.</p>

<p>On the third night a very significant thing happened. He
ordered his cocoa at 9 o'clock, an hour earlier than was his
wont, and upon Larose taking it in, he informed him that he
should not be requiring him any more that night, as he was going
to do some writing, and did not want to be disturbed. If the
telephone rang, he added, Larose was to say he was away from
home, no matter who the caller was, and the same answer was to be
given to anyone who came to the front door.</p>

<p>He did not look at Larose when he gave these orders, and the
detective was at once suspicious. Therefore, just after 10
o'clock, and when the maids had gone up to their rooms, Larose
tiptoed to the study door and listened. The lights were burning,
he could see from underneath the door, but not the slightest
sound came from inside the room. So Larose set fire to a small
piece of rag in the hall to create the smell of something
burning, and then knocked at the door with the excuse ready that
he was afraid something was on fire&mdash;a spark, perhaps, that
had jumped from the grate on to the carpet which the doctor
hadn't noticed.</p>

<p>But there was no answer to his knocking, so after a moment or
two he boldly opened the door, to find that the room&mdash;was
empty. He did not dare to wait long, not knowing how soon the
doctor might be returning, but, at any rate, he waited long
enough to see that there was no sign of any writing material upon
the desk, that the ink on all the pens was dry, and that the long
French window behind the thick curtains was unbolted both at the
top and the bottom. The doctor had undoubtedly gone out that
way.</p>

<p>Then for three solid hours Larose waited in the dark at the
top of the stairs until he saw the doctor finally come out of his
study and tip-toe to his bedroom, and the next morning there were
traces of black mud under the instep of his shoes. The uppers
appeared to have been given some attention to make than look
passably clean.</p>

<p>After breakfast Larose was sent round to the garage to tell
the chauffeur to be ready with the car at 9.30 sharp, and he
found his bibulous friend cursing and swearing because his best
screwdriver was missing.</p>

<p>"Blarst someone," the man swore. "How the hell am I to have
everything all right when my tools are sneaked? That's the only
screwdriver I can tighten my windscreen with."</p>

<p>"Where are you going to to-day, mate?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"London," growled the chauffeur. "There'll be a room full of
loonies waiting for us up there by eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>"What a tiring journey!" sympathised Larose. "What time'll you
be back?"</p>

<p>"Six o'clock," said the chauffeur, and he returned to the
grouch about his missing screwdriver.</p>

<p>Larose's heart beat high with hope as he returned to the
house. At last the coast would be clear for him to go through the
doctor's rooms. Ever since he had arrived his hands had been
itching to introduce certain cunningly fashioned little bits of
wire that he had brought with him into the keyholes of the
drawers of the doctor's desk but hitherto he had had no chance.
He was basing everything upon finding somewhere in some hiding
place the missing silver that the doctor had made out had been
taken upon the night of the murder, and he was confident he would
find it, too, not far away.</p>

<p>The doctor went off sharp at half-past nine as he had
ordained, and Larose returned to the carrying out of his usual
morning duties. He knew it would not be safe to tackle the
doctor's study until after lunch, when the parlor-maid would have
finished turning out the room, and his absence from the kitchen
could be accounted for by his being no longer on duty.</p>

<p>So, lunch over, he announced that he was going out for his
usual breath of fresh air and leaving openly by the back door, he
walked round the house, to double back when he saw there was no
one near, to the French windows of the doctor's study.</p>

<p>In two seconds he was inside the room, and to prevent surprise
was inserting a wooden wedge underneath the door.</p>

<p>"Better that, anyhow," he muttered, "than being caught red-handed. If by chance Smithers does try to come in, she'll think
something's gone wrong with the lock, and then, ten chances to
one, she'll wait for me." He grinned to himself and sighed.
"Really, if I stop here long I can see complications in the
kitchen. Cookie gave me the best rasher of bacon this morning,
and Smithers distinctly pushed her foot against mine at
lunch."</p>

<p>He produced a stout piece of wire from his pocket and bent
down before the big Cutler desk, but the first drawer was
unlocked and his eyebrows almost clicked together directly he
opened it.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he ejaculated, "an oily screwdriver!" He stared at it
with dilated eyes and then added, nodding his head slowly,
"perhaps&mdash;perhaps the very one that the chauffeur lost."</p>

<p>He chuckled happily. "Yes, yes, it must be so. The doctor
crept into the garage and borrowed it that night. He was the rat
that the teetotal chauffeur said he had heard moving about." His
eyes wandered swiftly round the study. "Now this should simplify
matters a lot. Where are there any screws to undo?"</p>

<p>He wrenched up one corner of the carpet, and ran his hand
along the floor-boards. "Nails, nails," he muttered, and he
quickly stamped down the carpet again. He crawled round the
wainscotting. "Still nails," he went on. He examined the table,
the sideboard, the desk, and the chairs, one by one. "Plenty of
screws," was his frowning comment, "but none of them have been
touched lately. I am sure of that."</p>

<p>He stood perplexed, with one finger on his lips, in the middle
of the room.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he did not hide them, here," he said slowly, and then
he shook his head. "But I should have done so and he would also
have done so surely, if possible, for it would have been
dangerous to move about too much at that time of night, when
lights on anywhere but in this room would have seemed to anyone
who might have noticed them outside, as most unusual."</p>

<p>He stared round for a long time, and then suddenly his face
lightened. "Ah!" he exclaimed, "those little windows. Now, their
framework will be screwed."</p>

<p>In two seconds he was standing before a little window above
the doctor's desk, and softly but swiftly lifting up the lower
part.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed again, "screws and scratches round the
woodwork." He felt the screw heads with his finger. "They've been
turned rather clumsily, too, and this dust round them now is much
too thick to be natural."</p>

<p>He snatched up the screwdriver, and went quickly to work upon
the lower part of the window-frame. The screws turned easily, and
he was soon able to lift out the panel. Then, thrusting his hand
down in the space between the bricks, he gave vent to a low
whistle. He pulled out some small but weighty articles tied up in
an almost clean dinner napkin.</p>

<p>A delighted smile crossed his face. "Good old Australia!" he
muttered. "They turn out some fine policemen there, anyhow." He
felt through the napkin. "My King Charles's salt cellars," he
grinned pompously, "my candle-sticks of Louis Quatorze and my two
valuable snuff-boxes of George the First."</p>

<p>But his merriment was short-lived, and putting back the napkin
and its contents as quickly as possible he screwed down the panel
again, and covering up all traces of his work, tiptoed softly
from the room.</p>

<p>"Exactly ten minutes," he remarked to himself as he was
passing through the window, "and that isn't a bad time for
putting a halter round any man. Now, I must think what I must do
next. I'll get in touch with the Yard soon, anyhow."</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; AT NIGHT ON THE ISLAND.</h2>

<p class="first">TWO days later, Carter and Stone were closeted
together in the room of the former at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"But he was too secretive with me, Charlie," said the lanky
detective frowningly, "and he didn't even tell me where he'd
found Shillington had cached the missing silver. He just said he
had located it and had left it undisturbed where it had been
placed. Of course, I knew he had to be very guarded in what he
said, speaking as he was from Manningtree, not seven miles from
Shillington's place, but he left me quite in the dark as to his
reasons for wanting us to stay our hands everywhere, and let him
remain on at Oakley Court. All he said was, that he was flying at
much higher game than Shillington now, and that he believed
Shillington to be only playing quite a minor role." Carter shook
his head. "I don't like it, Charlie. It's irregular to leave so
much responsibility to one man."</p>

<p>Stone hesitated a moment before he spoke. "And I don't like it
either, Eli," he said thoughtfully. "That lone hand business is
not the safe thing when dealing with a gang. It may be all right,
man to man, but when there's a parcel of them to be wiped up,
it's piling up the odds against us unnecessarily." His face
brightened, and he put his hand affectionately upon his
colleague's shoulder. "But come, Eli, don't let's be old women
and start worrying, now. That lad won't let us down, I've an
instinct. Remember, he's been right every time so far, and we are
surely quite justified in giving him his head a bit. But what
else did he tell you about Oakley Court?"</p>

<p>"Only that the wine was very good," replied Carter drily, "and
that if he didn't take care he was afraid the cook would be
making him an offer of marriage before very long."</p>

<p>"Excellent," exclaimed Stone, rubbing his hands, "then he's
being well fed, and remember, Elias, as Napoleon said, an army
marches on its belly. But any word from Colchester yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Carter, and his face lost a little of its
worried look. "Stevens seems to be getting at grips with
something there, and although he reports no definite discovery as
yet, still he appears to be quite convinced there was
justification for us sending him down." He picked up a paper off
the desk. "Here is what he writes; it came this morning."</p>

<p>"Have now had Fred Duke under observation for five days, and
am certain he is on the crook. His actions are highly suspicious.
He is difficult to follow, for he never walks far anywhere,
without turning, to look back, and whenever he stops, he gives
the once over most carefully to everybody standing by. He lives a
quiet life, hardly speaks to anyone, and appears to have no
friends. When he leaves his lodgings every morning, he goes
straight to work, and when his work is finished, he goes straight
home. But sharp at a quarter to seven every night he comes out
again and walks up the High-street to Cole's Book Arcade. There
he stops, looking in the window until the Town Hall clock has
struck seven. Then immediately, to the tick, he starts to walk
home again. It seems he's got a date there with someone who
hasn't turned up as yet. He's posted two letters, one last Monday
and the other tonight, and each time he's posted them at the head
office, although he'd have caught the same mail if he'd used the
pillar-box in the street where he is living. I noticed, too, that
both times he waited until other people were posting letters
until he put his own into the slit. He acts all the time as if he
was suspicious of being watched and I should like another man
sent down to help, for if he does meet someone outside the
bookshop, then one of us will be ready to trail number two.
According to instructions I have made no attempt to speak to him
and have made no enquiries at his lodgings. He is a shy bird and
must be very carefully approached.'</p>

<p>"Quite a solid man, Stevens," was Stone's comment, "and this
fellow Duke is acting just as we might expect. If he's one of the
Iron Man gang, he'll be wary and suspicious, exactly as Stevens
reports." The big detective looked troubled. "But I confess I'm a
little anxious about Larose, for if Shillington, with a cold-blooded murder to his credit, is only, as Larose puts it, in a
minor role, then what the hell must the parts of the other actors
in this little play be like?" He shook his head. "And the boy'll
be all on his own, as I say, with no help at hand if he should
make one single slip." He looked intently at his companion. "And
those marshes are lonely, remember Elias, and that black mud
could keep its secrets well." He sighed with resignation. "Still,
now we can only wait and see. One thing, however, the lad's a
quick worker and our suspense will not be for long."</p>

<p>And certainly Larose was a quick worker, for although he had
been only a few days at Oakley Court and was now absolutely
certain that Dr. Shillington was the murderer of the butler,
Jakes, yet he had definitely dismissed that discovery as being in
no wise the termination of his quest and was simply regarding it
as a stepping-stone to further discoveries that might turn out to
be of a much more important nature than this single crime against
one man.</p>

<p>That he was at the gates of some black underworld of crime had
become the obsession of his mind, and certainty was avalanching
upon suspicion, that if he could only uncover it, there was some
dark conspiracy of evil close at hand.</p>

<p>Oakley Court sheltered one criminal, he knew, and everything
pointed to there being sympathy and understanding between that
criminal and the inmates of the house across the marshes, on the
island.</p>

<p>Something was going on between them and something that
demanded elaborate precautions should be taken, too, to prevent
its being brought to light.</p>

<p>He had learnt a lot about the island people from the maids,
and it had struck him at once as being most peculiar that
although all of the four men there were supposed to be great
friends of the doctor, yet three of them had never at any time
come up to the Court except at night, and, indeed although they
lived so near and all their tastes and inclinations were supposed
to be to the direction of sport and recreation in the open air,
yet never once had they been known to cross the river except
during the hours of darkness.</p>

<p>They had been up to the court several times to dinner and
often to spend the evening, but the cook and the housemaid did
not even know them yet by sight.</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper they all knew, but then another singular thing
there. Although the colonel was a most presentable sort of man
and of so obviously companionable a nature, yet whenever he had
come up unexpectedly and there had been strangers about the
Court, he had always been bustled away quickly or else had been
put into a room by himself to wait until the visitors had
gone.</p>

<p>Larose was certain there was some mystery about these men upon
the island, and that they all in a greater or lesser degree had
good reasons for keeping out of the public eye. Added to that, he
was quite certain again that it was to them Dr. Shillington had
been paying a visit when that night he had secretly left the
house through the window of his study, leaving the lights,
however, to burn on there during the whole time he was away, in
order, no doubt, to give the illusion that he was still working
in his room.</p>

<p>Larose had not forgotten either the black mud upon the
doctor's shoes the next morning, black river mud he was sure, and
the obvious attempt that had been made to give them an ordinary
every-day appearance by scraping the excess mud off.</p>

<p>Then why all this secrecy he asked himself, and what was this
mystery that was going on?</p>

<p>To those whose life work it was to deal with crime, secrecy
and mystery were suspicious at any time, but when they were
persisting when dreadful murder had just been done
then&mdash;good God! it meant that the waters of violence had not
yet subsided and that the end of evil had not yet come.</p>

<p>So, full of these ideas, Larose set about making a closer
acquaintanceship with the island and he set off for there openly,
one afternoon when he was off duty.</p>

<p>He heard the village butcher mentioning to the cook just after
their midday meal, that he had been delivering meat there, so he
knew the tide must be low and the causeway uncovered.</p>

<p>He walked slowly along the marsh road as if he were only out
for an idle constitutional, and approaching the river bank, he
glanced interestedly at the small shed where, he had been told,
Colonel Jasper garaged his car when the water was too high for
him to cross over. The shed was substantially built he saw, with
the door secured with a big padlock.</p>

<p>"Quite easy to open," was his comment, "but there'll never be
anything suspicious to be found there."</p>

<p>The river bank dropped steeply down and he reckoned the
causeway would be covered twelve feet deep at high water. When on
the causeway itself, he was out of sight of all habitations, and
at the bottom, as it were, of a broad deep ditch with long vistas
of black slimy mud everywhere. He wondered at the presence of so
much mud so near the sea until he noticed upon the landward side
of the river quite a number of small riverlets, trickling into
the river bed.</p>

<p>"And then that's why there's always some water here," he
ruminated. "The marsh land is drained through those dykes. I
don't wonder old Shillington got his boots muddy the other night,
for, even with a torch, on these slippery stones it would be
difficult in the darkness to cross over perfectly dry."</p>

<p>Gaining the farther bank, he gave one long and naturally
interested look at the big house about a couple of hundred yards
distant, but then as if his curiosity were quite satisfied, he
turned off along the river bank, as if he were intending to take
a walk round the island. He had seen two men sitting in deck
chairs, just before the house, but they were too far away for him
to form any idea as to what they were like.</p>

<p>He walked slowly on in the direction of the sea, and then when
about half a mile away from the house, stretched himself down
between two low hummocks as if to enjoy a rest. Out of sight
then, as he believed, from all prying eyes, he produced a small,
but powerful pair of binoculars from his pocket and many, many
times, went carefully over every yard of the long straggling
buildings before him.</p>

<p>The house was undoubtedly very old, for the brickwork was
weather beaten and fretted and much of the mortar in it had
crumbled away. It was two stories high, but the upper one was to
all appearances unoccupied, for all the windows of it were
boarded up. Fifteen boarded windows Larose counted on the side of
the house facing him. There were a few small outhouses scattered
about, but they were obviously quite modern and in much better
condition.</p>

<p>The whole island appeared to be lifeless, except that there
was a cow grazing not far from the house and a horse was enclosed
in a small paddock.</p>

<p>"No dogs," sighed Larose with satisfaction, "and I could
approach quite safely in the dark. Good, then," he went on, "and
as there's no time like the present. I'll do it to-night." He
looked out towards the sea. "And if Smithers is right and the
tide goes out almost to that buoy, then with it receding as it is
now, it should be a very long while before it flows in high
enough again to make the causeway impassable. The wind's off
shore, too, and that will tend to hinder the water banking up."
He looked at his watch and made a rapid calculation. "Yes, I
shall easily have until eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>Making his way back by the other side of the island he had a
good look at a commodious boat house that he passed. Here the
structure looked of very recent date.</p>

<p>"Not been put up six months yet, I'll swear," he muttered, and
then his breath began to come a little quicker. "Oh! how
everything can be made to fit in with my idea as to the
surroundings of where the gang of the Iron Man are hiding. A
lonely spot right out of the world, a place where no one would
ever be watching, and a good approach at high water, too." He
looked thoughtfully at the steep banks of mud on either side.
"Yes, only at high water, for I'll swear again that there'll be
only very few minutes at the extreme top of the tide when they
can get a launch in, in safety here." He frowned. "Well, I must
have a good look at that launch, but I'm afraid I shan't have
time to-night."</p>

<p>Returning leisurely home, he resumed his duties at the Court,
and just before 10 carried in the doctor's cocoa, receiving then
the usual curt information that his services would be no more
required that night.</p>

<p>He went up to his bedroom at once then, as if he were
intending to go straight to bed, but bed was the last thing in
his mind.</p>

<p>Waiting a few minutes to make certain that the maids were
finally settled in their rooms, he crept downstairs and without a
sound let himself out of the back door and made straight for the
gardener's shed. He picked the padlock there, and then, helping
himself to a pair of pincers and a screwdriver from the
gardener's tool box, he laid hands on a 12-foot ladder, which he
proceeded to carry to the foot of the asylum wall. Then, in less
than two minutes, he was over the wall and walking briskly
towards the island, still, however, carrying the ladder with him.
It was a dark night, but there were faint stars overhead, and
with his eyes now accustomed to the blackness, he could pick his
way easily, as he had anticipated, along the marsh road.</p>

<p>Reaching the causeway over the river bed, he saw that he would
not have very much time before him, as the tide was beginning now
to flow in steadily.</p>

<p>Walking warily upon the grass, he approached the house and was
at first inclined to believe that its inmates had all gone to
bed, for even at a short distance away the whole place appeared
to be in pitch darkness, but arriving before the window nearest
to the front door, he heard laughter and the sound of talking,
and at once grasped how things were. There were thick curtains
before the windows, and only at the very top of one of them could
there be seen a single ray of light.</p>

<p>Losing not a moment of time, he lifted up his ladder and leant
it upon the brickwork high above the middle of the window. Then
climbing swiftly up he was delighted to find that the window was
open for about four inches at the top. Hesitating just a second,
he took the screwdriver he was carrying out of his pocket and
leaning over, he thrust it forward very gently and slowly parted
the curtains inside the room. At once he got a clear view of
everything.</p>

<p>It was a very large room, oak-panelled and oak-ceilinged, and
it was very lofty, almost to the height of the two stories of the
house. It looked as if it had been the banquetting hall of the
Priory, once. It had a very big fireplace, and there was a bright
fire burning in it now.</p>

<p>Three men were playing cards at the far end, a fourth was
reading in a big armchair, and a bent old woman, with her head
done up in a shawl, was arranging a table in the centre for a
meal.</p>

<p>The three players were intent upon their game. One, Larose
saw, was Colonel Jasper, and the other two he guessed were the
men whom the parlor-maid had referred to by the names of Sarle
and Edgehill. There was no doubt about the fourth man; he was
Broome.</p>

<p>Sarle was easy enough to pick out from the parlor-maid's
description. A cynical, thin-lipped man with a fine, clean-cut
profile, and dreamy-looking, almond-shaped eyes. A handsome man
with an air of distinction and refinement about him, but
cruel&mdash;very cruel. He was of medium size, but gave the
impression of strength and of being as lithe as a panther.</p>

<p>The third player, Edgehill, was of much bigger build. He
looked coarse and rather of the swaggering type, but he had a
strong capable face, and was undoubtedly every inch a fighter. He
had a bold and insolent expression.</p>

<p>The fourth man, the one reading in the chair, was very
different from the others, and looked like a scholar. He was tall
and thin, with a high forehead and deep set eyes. His mouth was
like a straight line, and he held his lips tightly shut.</p>

<p>"Three men there who would stick at nothing," was the comment
of Larose, "and a fourth who would look on and say nothing. Four
nice beauties for Shillington to be mixed up with. Two fine
gentlemen of crime, a one-time varsity man who has gone to the
devil, and a callous-looking crank with a grievance probably
against all the world. But I'd like to get their fingerprints,"
he added thoughtfully, "especially those of that thin-lipped
chap. He looks a man with a prison history, and that complexion
of his has got a smack of prison walls."</p>

<p>"Damn you, Sarle," suddenly he heard Edgehill call out, "but
it was risky playing that queen."</p>

<p>"And I like risks." replied Sarle coolly, "or I shouldn't be
here."</p>

<p>"But I didn't know you'd got the nine of hearts left," said
Colonel Jasper. "I thought the nine was the card you played when
you played the seven."</p>

<p>"Then you should wear your glasses, man," sneered Edgehill.
"And then you'd see the cards properly. It's only because of your
damned vanity that you don't use them always."</p>

<p>"My worthy Edgehill," sighed the colonel carelessly. "I don't
mind thinking that I shall die of T.B. sometime, but I do object
to the idea that I am getting old."</p>

<p>Edgehill thumped violently upon the table. "Where's the syphon
of soda," he shouted loudly. "Damn that old hag of yours, Jasper,
she forgets everything now."</p>

<p>"Don't rouse at her, Edgehill," said the colonel quietly. "The
old woman's not been looking at all well lately." He smiled
drily. "No, she's not heard you, so you'd better get up and get
it yourself. There's a fresh one in the cupboard." He frowned.
"She's deafer than ever to-day, and, as I say, she doesn't look
well."</p>

<p>"She makes me feel sick," growled Edgehill, "and I never look
at her."</p>

<p>"Nor I either," added Sarle, in his cultured voice. "A close
scrutiny of her would put me off my food." He turned towards the
man in the chair. "And isn't it the same with you, Broome?"</p>

<p>The reader looked up with a frown. "The same with me?" he
asked irritably. "What's the same now with me?"</p>

<p>"I have just remarked," said Sarle, calmly, "that a too long
contemplation of Mother Heggarty does not conduce to appetite,
and I suggested that perhaps it might be the same with you?"</p>

<p>Broome scowled as if he were annoyed at his reading being
interrupted. "I never noticed her at all," he said sharply. "To
me she doesn't exist," and he turned back instantly to his
book.</p>

<p>"Really," drawled Colonel Jasper; "but how could one expect
such a great mind to notice common people. I
think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Larose did not wait to hear any more. He slipped down the
ladder, and laying it gently upon the grass, proceeded on a quick
tour of investigation all round the house. With all its known
inmates gathered in the big room, he felt quite secure from
observation outside, and he used his electric torch freely.</p>

<p>"Only the ground floor in occupation, as I thought," he
muttered, "and every window thickly curtained. They're not afraid
of burglars evidently, by the look of the fastenings, but they're
taking darned good care no one shall get a glimpse inside
anywhere. Now for the upper story, it would make a fine place for
keeping an eye on them from, if they never go up there."</p>

<p>He brought his ladder round to the far end of the building,
and propped it up so that he could climb up on to the sill of the
window nearest to the sea. Then very quickly he was prising up
the bottom end of one of the long pieces of planking that for
many years, apparently, had been nailed down across the gutted
window frame. It came up easily, for the salt-laden air had well
and truly rusted the big nails, and the wood was soft and rotted
where they held.</p>

<p>Lifting up the board only just sufficiently to allow of him
squeezing under, he was soon standing inside the room. A dank and
mouldy smell filled the air, and flashing his light round he saw
that he was in a big empty room given over everywhere to layers
of thick dust.</p>

<p>"No one been here for donkey's years," was his comment, "and
the flooring may be pretty shaky, too, so I must be careful that
I don't fall through."</p>

<p>He tiptoed across to the door, and found it was unlocked.
Opening it very gently, and waiting until his eyes were again
accustomed to the darkness, he saw that a long passage ran before
him, with rooms opening out on to it on either side. He heard the
sound of voices in the distance.</p>

<p>Not daring to proceed farther until he knew exactly where he
was going to plant his feet, he chanced it and flashed his light
again. It was all right. The flooring was quite sound, and
everything was still covered over thickly with dust.</p>

<p>Mindful of the slowly rising water on the causeway, he knew
that whatever he was going to do, he must do quickly, so with no
hesitation at all he proceeded farther into the passage, keeping
all the time, however, very close to one side of the wall and
taking good care at every step to make sure that the flooring
beneath him was quite sound. The talking became louder and more
distinct with every foot that he advanced.</p>

<p>The passage was a long one, about seventy or eighty yards, he
judged, and he passed thirteen rooms on his way. Then he was
brought up against another door. It seemed that he was very near
to the big room below, now, for he could hear quite plainly the
clatter of knives and forks.</p>

<p>Holding his breath in his excitement, and unmindful of the
soiling of his clothes, he dropped gently down and placed his ear
upon the floor. Yes, he must be very close to the living room,
for not only could he hear distinctly what they were saying, but
also there was a strong smell of cooking, and with his eyes at
that level he could see a thin line of light, too, under the
wainscotting.</p>

<p>He rose very quietly to his feet, and flashing his torch up
saw that there was a trapdoor in the wall, about eight feet above
where he stood.</p>

<p>"Good," he smiled gleefully, "and that will lead to under the
roof. I could get up there and through the cracks between the
beams see everything that was going on below. One couldn't want
for a better spot, for one could see and hear there as well." His
face became serious. "But now for a quick getaway before I am
obliged to swim for it."</p>

<p>He was soon on to his ladder again, and pushing to the board
so that no sign of his visit should remain. Then suddenly a
thought struck him.</p>

<p>"But how shall I get up here if I come again?" he asked
himself, and he flashed his torch against the brickwork. "Yes,
yes, the mortar's pretty rotten and there's plenty of room for
fingers and toes. At any rate, I could get up, somehow."</p>

<p>He had a quick look into three of the nearest outhouses. One
was a stable with a hayloft above it, another was filled with
bundles of straw, and the third, a large tool shed, contained six
bicycles.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he ejaculated, "it gets clearer and clearer. Now I
wonder if anyone round here ever saw any of these fine gentlemen
using a bicycle?" He shook his head and grinned. "No, I don't
think so, but at any rate, I can soon enquire."</p>

<p>He ran back, and picking up his ladder, very soon reached the
causeway again, to find, however, that the water was flowing with
alarming swiftness, and was now not very far off three feet
deep.</p>

<p>"No help for it," he muttered, "I'll get a soaking, but still
it might have been worse. It'll be all right as long as I don't
get the upper part of me wet, too."</p>

<p>Taking instant action, he whipped off his coat and waistcoat
and hung them on the top of the ladder, then steadying himself
with the other end, he waded boldly in. The current was very
strong, and he had great difficulty in escaping being swept off
his feet, but he gained the other side at last, and thankfully
climbed up on to the road, although by this time he was well
soaked through.</p>

<p>"Ah! but I'm wet," he grimaced. "What a good thing it was I
took my coat and waistcoat off. No, I'll not put them on again
just yet. I'll wait until some of the water has dripped off me or
they'll quickly be both soaking, too. Now I'll run all the way
home and then I shan't catch cold," and with the ladder balanced
high up upon his shoulder and with his coat and waistcoat
dangling at the top, he set off at a quick trot along the marsh
road.</p>

<p>And then suddenly he heard the sound of a motor car behind
him, and instantly everything in front was bathed in a beam of
ghostly light. Only for a few seconds, however, and then the beam
swerved round in another direction. He threw himself down flat
upon the ground, with his ladder dropped anywhere, and the beam
snapped out and the roar of the motor stopped. Then another light
appeared, a smaller one, but very mobile. It swept slowly round
and lingered, and swept slowly round again. It did this several
times, and then its movements were accelerated and it stabbed the
darkness spasmodically in every direction. Finally it went out,
and after a moment, the motor roared again.</p>

<p>With eyes that were almost starting from his head, Larose
stared back upon the island. A motor car was crossing along it
lengthways, in the direction of the sea. He watched fascinated.
Slowly the car proceeded, rising and falling over the uneven
ground, then it turned at right angles, and winding between some
low hummocks dropped all at once out of sight and the lights went
out.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" ejaculated Larose, "what a scare!" His teeth were
chattering, and groping hurriedly for his coat and waistcoat, he
hustled them quickly on.</p>

<p>"But I guess what happened," he continued. "They were getting
out their car, and as they came out the garage their lights
picked me up. Only for a second, however, and they weren't
certain what they saw. So they dashed on the searchlight and
tried to get me again. But they evidently didn't see anything
then and so probably they're thinking now that they didn't see
anything at all."</p>

<p>He picked up the ladder and then, turning for a last look, he
frowned heavily.</p>

<p>"But what the devil were they doing now with the car out at
this time of night and where on earth could they be going?"</p>

<p>He stood staring for a long minute, and then realising that he
was shivering violently, he swung the ladder again upon his
shoulder and started at a sharp run for home.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he was in bed, and lying with his eyes wide
open was trying to sum up the situation.</p>

<p>"Well, I've quite made up my mind now," he told himself, "and
I'm going to shadow those four chaps straight away. I'll ring up
the Yard to-morrow and have an urgent message 'phoned to me here
that somebody is dying and I am to leave at once. Then I'll get a
few things together&mdash;a fingerprint camera will be the first
one&mdash;and go back to the island by night. I ought to soon
find out what's wrong, if I can get into the place again. Yes,
yes, that's what poor Jakes bought his binoculars for. He found
out something and started to watch, and he got a blue-black face
and six feet of earth for his pains." The detective gritted his
teeth together. "But I'm not minded for such luxuries yet and
they won't get me as easily, I'll take care." He frowned in the
darkness. "But I must be careful. If they're what I think, I
mustn't underrate them. They're not mugs by any means, and one
false slip&mdash;" he grinned, "the eels will have me and I shall
be swapping news with Jakes."</p>

<p>He turned over on to his side and, making his mind a blank,
composed himself tranquilly for sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE PERIL OF LAROSE.</h2>

<p class="first">THE next morning, discussing a succulent plate
of ham and eggs, but with the cook bustling round him and
disposed to be so very friendly that at moments he could not
really tell whether it was egg or ham that he had got in his
mouth, Larose was groping about in his mind for a tale good
enough to pitch to Dr. Shillington.</p>

<p>"Darn the woman," he frowned to himself, "hasn't she learnt
yet that breakfast is the one meal at which no one ever does any
courting? It's much too early in the day for love, and she's
taking all the taste out of my food. I wish to goodness she'd
leave me alone."</p>

<p>He wanted to get away from Oakley Court as speedily as
possible, and as he had just heard that the doctor was
unexpectedly to start for London at half-past nine, he was hard
put to it to determine exactly what he should say.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, the advent of the parlor-maid into the
kitchen, in ten seconds made him alter all his plans and caused
him to discard the idea of leaving, for at least another forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>"Dinner party to-morrow, cook," she announced briskly, "four
coming, and as it isn't until half-past eight, I expect it's the
gentlemen from the island. Doctor wants to speak to you at once,
please."</p>

<p>Smoothing down her apron, the cook went out, to return,
however, in a very few minutes. She beamed at Larose.</p>

<p>"Good dinner, Mr. Mason," she said. "Now, you'll see what we
can do. Turtle soup, turbot, saddle of mutton, and lots of nice
things." She smiled indulgently. "And there'll be a snack of
everything for us, too." She looked round in a motherly way at
the others. "There generally is, girls, isn't there?"</p>

<p>The day was almost an uneventful one for Larose. In the
afternoon he walked round the grounds and had a chat with some of
the patients who were out taking the sun. He was considerably
flattered when one gentleman asked him if he were the Emperor of
Russia, but was a little bit downcast when an old lady was sure
that she remembered him as one of the cowmen in the Chelmsford
Agricultural Show.</p>

<p>He waited as usual upon Dr. Shillington at dinner in the
evening, and it made him a little thoughtful afterwards that it
seemed the great man had been rather more interested in him than
hitherto. The meal had been conducted in perfect silence, but
several times he would have sworn that covert glances had been
flashed at him, and he was almost positive that the doctor had
deliberately shifted his chair a couple of inches or so, to bring
himself in line with the mirror over the fireplace, from whence
he could command the reflected view of his butler, as he was
standing like a statue by the sideboard.</p>

<p>"Nerves, Gilbert," he told himself. "You're getting old and
imagine things. Except for that little weakness of murdering his
butlers your master is probably as innocent as a baby."</p>

<p>But as the doctor, having finished his meal, rose up to leave
the room, he favored his servant with a long and searching
stare.</p>

<p>"There'll be five of us for dinner tomorrow, Mason," he said
very slowly, much more slowly than the occasion warranted, Larose
thought&mdash;"and we'll have the burgundy from No. 18 bin. Serve
it in the cradle, of course, and six bottles should be enough.
Also well have two bottles of the '47 Port."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," replied Larose.</p>

<p>The following night a few minutes before half-past eight, the
four guests duly arrived in a car, and taking their coats, Larose
ushered them into the study and proceeded at once to serve
cocktails. Dr. Shillington was not in, he informed them, having
been called over to the asylum on a very urgent matter, which
would, however, only occupy a few minutes.</p>

<p>They were all in evening dress, and if the detective had not
masked his face with an expression of such respect and servility,
he would have frowned in perplexity. They all looked so
distinguished and so gentlemanly, and there was about three of
them, at least, that subtle air of refinement that is invariably
associated with good birth.</p>

<p>The four of them eyed him interestedly, and when he had left
the room the tallest of them said thoughtfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good physiognomy, but very stupid expression. A combination I
have often noticed in the lower classes."</p>

<p>"One there for you, Broome," laughed Colonel Jasper. "That was
the very opinion I formed when I saw him the other night." He
grinned at the other. "Really, this is one of your good days to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the tall man complacently, "very little escapes me
when I give my mind to it, as you ought to know already."</p>

<p>Just when the cook was beginning to despair, Dr. Shillington
hurried in and dinner was served immediately.</p>

<p>Now in the dark and meagre days that followed, Larose thought
often of that dinner, and contrasted it with the surroundings
that were holding him then. It was like a glorious Hallelujah
Chorus, followed later by silence of the tomb.</p>

<p>All was harmony and happiness at that moment, and the bringing
together of beautiful and desirable things.</p>

<p>There was the sumptuously furnished room, with its
appointments of ease and luxury on every side. There was the long
table with its wealth of silver and crystal ware, and the soft
lights that the candles threw, accentuating the restful shadows
in the corners of the room. There were the flowers that gave
suggestion of refinement, and of minds that would appreciate the
ennobling influences of life. There was the aroma of rich foods,
and finally, the incense of old wine, whose fragrance was the
love story of some vineyard, where the sun had told its passion
to the vines in the summer of those years of long ago.</p>

<p>And then there was the joy and happiness in men's hearts.
There were the smiling countenances of men at peace with all the
world. There was the hum of care-free conversation, the lightning
flash of wit, and the roll of laughter as the jest went home.
Five English gentlemen enjoying their ease and comfort as five
such fortunate gentlemen should.</p>

<p>The dinner was a lengthy one and it was quite late before
Larose had left the diners to the nuts and port.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for you, Mr. Mason," smiled the cook when he came
back into the kitchen. "We girls shall all be in bed in three-quarters of an hour, but they'll keep you going until one or two
o'clock in the morning." She laughed meaningly. "I wonder who'll
be driving the car home? I suppose they're getting quite jolly
now."</p>

<p>But in the dining-room, had the cook been only there to see,
the jollity had all suddenly died down. The host and his guests
had all at once become different men.</p>

<p>They had pulled their chairs up close together. Their faces
were serious and Colonel Jasper had thrown away his
cigarette.</p>

<p>"Now for business," had said Dr. Shillington sharply. "We've a
lot to arrange. But one thing first," he frowned, "this man of
mine, here, I'm doubtful about him."</p>

<p>"And so am I," said Sarle promptly. "So are we all."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Dr. Shillington with his eyes opened very
wide. "What do you know about him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much," was the reply, "but we're suspicious, that's
all," and Sarle's lips snapped together like a trap of steel.</p>

<p>"Suspecting what?" asked the doctor quickly. "Suspicious,
why?"</p>

<p>Sarle spoke very deliberately. "Yesterday, Dr. Shillington,
your butler came on to the island intending undoubtedly to give
the impression that he was wandering about in quite an aimless
manner, but he dropped between two hummocks on the east side and
for twenty minutes by my watch, in a most businesslike way,
searched everything within his view. I was looking at him with my
glasses, standing upon the kitchen table, well back in the room,
and I saw his face quite plainly between the tufts of grass. He
appeared very much in earnest."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Dr. Shillington, and there was a wealth of
expression in his "ah."</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Sarle evenly, "and shortly after eleven last
night Edgehill says he had an experience." He glanced over his
shoulder with just the suspicion of a smile. "But tell him
yourself, Edgehill."</p>

<p>"I went out in the car after supper to look at my rabbit
traps," said Edgehill gruffly, "and as I was coming out of the
shed, the lights picked up the marsh road and I saw a man walking
on stilts, there." He looked straight at Sarle and there was a
note of challenge in his voice. "I'm certain I did. The lights
picked him up distinctly, but the car was turning in a half
circle and I lost him before I could stop. So I put the search
light on and&mdash;he was gone."</p>

<p>"A man on stilts!" exclaimed Dr. Shillington, looking very
puzzled. "What's the idea?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Edgehill with some heat, "but I'm sure
I saw him. He was eight or nine feet high, I'm certain of
it."</p>

<p>There was a dead silence, and then Colonel Jasper drawled, "It
was after supper, of course, Doctor."</p>

<p>"You damned fool!" snarled Edgehill. "You're
never&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh don't argue, you two," interrupted Sarle sharply, and he
turned again to the doctor. "You see, Shillington," he went on,
"in the ordinary way, we shouldn't have thought twice about it,
but this morning Broome noticed some peculiar markings on the top
of the bank above the Causeway, and we are sure they are not
ours. They look as if a pole or two poles have been dragged along
and there are faint footprints, too, at one side." He regarded
Dr. Shillington intently. "These things coming immediately upon
your man's curiosity in us are naturally making us think."</p>

<p>Again there was a silence, and then Colonel Jasper
asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"And this chap, doctor, where did you pick him up?"</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington came out of a reverie. "At the usual place,"
he said, "a registry office in North Audley-street, where I've
been going for years. A Major Channing's the proprietor, a most
reliable person."</p>

<p>"Then what are you suspicious about?" asked Sarle.</p>

<p>The doctor frowned. "I met this Channing by chance yesterday,"
he said slowly, "and his manner was peculiar. He wouldn't look
straight at me, and he seemed nervous about something. It was so
marked that I've been thinking about it ever since."</p>

<p>"But, good Lord!" ejaculated Colonel Jasper, "do you imagine,
then, they've planted a 'tec on you because of that Jakes
business?"</p>

<p>"Mason, a 'tec!" sneered the doctor, "why, out of his work
he's only a fool. He was reading a boy's penny dreadful the other
day. He'd left it on one of the garden seats, and I picked it up
after he had gone."</p>

<p>"Where was he in his last situation?" asked Edgehill.</p>

<p>"I made no enquiries," replied the doctor. "He's come to me
only for three weeks until another man I've engaged is free. I
took it from Channing that he was all right. Channing told me on
the 'phone that he'd been with Sir John Dyce-Brown for five
years, until the baronet died."</p>

<p>"Then your Channing's a liar," broke in Colonel Jasper with
some vehemence. "This chap has never been near the Dyce-Browns,
I'll swear. I can tell by the way he served the wines just now.
He filled the port glasses too full for one thing, and for
another he walked too quickly as he brought in that vintage
burgundy. Every time I could see that he was shaking up the
wine." The colonel sat up stiffly in his excitement. "Why,
Shillington, Dyce-Brown had one of the finest cellars in the
kingdom, and the serving of the wine was a ritual with him." He
laughed scoffingly. "He wouldn't have kept this man a week. This
chap knows nothing about old wine."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington addressed himself to Sarle. "Well, what shall
we do?" he asked, frowning, "I don't like this."</p>

<p>"Have him in again," snapped the thin-lipped man, "and we'll
look him over in earnest this time."</p>

<p>Hesitating just a moment, the doctor touched the bell and then
began talking loudly. "But then I tell you, Nature always takes
with one hand as she gives with the other. She endowed woman with
the gift of maternity and at the same time she took from her in
other ways. Woman has no initiative. Man is the seed and woman
but the soil through which life filters. Plant an acorn and up
will come an oak, plant a cabbage seed and&mdash;&mdash;" the
door opened and Larose came quietly in. No one looked at him, he
saw. All eyes were fixed upon his master.</p>

<p>"Bring-me-that-box-of-cigarettes-upon-my-desk," said the
doctor, very slowly, and with the first word Larose sensed that
there was some new atmosphere in the room. All eyes had clicked
towards him instantly and Colonel Jasper, now, had got his
glasses on. No one moved a muscle, and they all sat stiffly in
their chairs.</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought Larose. "Now, they've been talking about me, and
what the deuce does that mean?"</p>

<p>He fetched the cigarettes, and upon the doctor's instructions
handed them round. No one's eyes were upon him now, but Sarle he
noticed, looked hard at his hands. He went back very thoughtfully
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Well," said the doctor very quietly, the moment the door was
closed, "and what do you think of him?"</p>

<p>"I believe he is dangerous," said Sarle emphatically, and he
looked round at the others. "He's no ordinary butler. Didn't you
see the tan on his hands?" He snapped his teeth together. "Well,
we'll talk of him later. We've got some other things to think of
now. I've rather disquieting news."</p>

<p>He drew his chair up to the table and took a letter out of his
pocket. "This is from Duke," he said. "We got it this morning,"
and he at once commenced to read.</p>

<p>"I send you the plans of the bank. There are alarms on the
windows I have marked 'A,' but there is a skylight over the room
G., and there are no wires there. It could be approached easily
from the roof of the fishmonger's shop at the back. The manager
lives over the bank, and sleeps in the room M. He is a small man,
and lives alone. He sleeps badly, and there are white tablets in
his room in a phial marked 'Dial Hypnotic.' There are two
servants, but they never go out at the same time, at night. The
housemaid has Wednesdays off, from two o'clock, and comes home at
eleven. The cook goes off on Sundays. She drinks. There are two
locks on the strongroom door. The chief clerk is Edgar Young. He
is unmarried, and boards at 17, Jeffer-street. There are two
other people in his house, and it is lonely, at the end of a road
by some waste lands. He goes out every night alone, and generally
takes a walk by the river. He is young and strong. There is no
dog there. Now for something that worries me. I believe I am
being watched. A man is shadowing me. At least, I think so, for I
have three times seen him in our street at night, and he was in
the High-street when I went to work this morning. Also, the boss
at the shop is very funny. Rattery, I mean. He stares at me a
lot, and never looks at me now when I am looking at him.
Yesterday he asked me where I had worked before I came to him. I
don't think I'd better come down for a week or two. If anyone is
keeping an eye on me, I'll wait until things clear up. I'll go up
to the usual place every evening, however, but if I've got my hat
on one side let everyone keep away. They'll know something's up,
then. If you want to speak to me urgently, write and make a date
for very early one morning and then I'll meet you, say, just
before five, by the King's statue in the park. I can give anyone
the slip then who's watching my house, by getting over the back
fence in the dark. There's nothing they can find here if they
search, but I've got the wind up and feel nervy."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the doctor drily, "and at the first pressing
he'll give us all away. If he got into the hands of the police,
he'd break like a rotten stick."</p>

<p>"I know that," said Sarle frowning, "but I know also that
he'll never squeak voluntarily. He's got too much on his own
account to hide. He's still wanted for his wife's death, don't
you forget!"</p>

<p>"We ought never to have used him," frowned back Dr.
Shillington; "I was against it from the first."</p>

<p>"He's very intelligent." said Sarle, "and he's been a great
help."</p>

<p>"Well, he's dangerous now," growled the doctor, "and if, as he
thinks, he's attracted the attention of the police, then we must
get him right away at once from this part of the country, or
else&mdash;&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Or else?" asked Sarle, and his eyes were narrowed to two
slits.</p>

<p>"We must silence him as I did Jakes," finished the doctor,
stubbornly. "Half measures are no good when we are threatened
like this."</p>

<p>Sarle looked thoughtful. "But I don't possibly see how Duke
can have aroused any suspicion," he said. "He's been kept
absolutely clear of everything and he's never had a finger in any
of our work. It's incredible that the police can be trying to
link him up with us."</p>

<p>"I'm of the opinion," said Edgehill, idly flicking the aches
from his cigarette, "that he's been doing some job on his own,
and the police are after him for that. He's a sly little beast,
and we mayn't know half of his dirty little life. At any rate I'm
in with Shillington, the matter's serious, and Duke's number is
up."</p>

<p>No one spoke for a moment, and then Sarle turned and as if he
were slightly amused, looked questionably at Edgehill.</p>

<p>"And what's your proposal, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>Edgehill nodded. "Oh! I'll do it," he said carelessly. He
frowned. "But I wish the park were nearer the river. There'll be
a devil of a row when his body's found." He looked round
scornfully. "But I get all the dirty work."</p>

<p>Sarle shook his head. "No, not all, Edgehill," he said
quietly. "There are three kills out against me, and both Jasper
and Shillington have got one." He smiled sarcastically. "Broome's
the only maiden here."</p>

<p>Broome laughed. "I do my work in a different way," he said,
"and there's been no need for unpleasant episodes with me. I'm
the scientific mind of this firm." A note of resentment crept
into his voice. "But don't you forget, I've never shirked
anything, and I've been in as much risk as anyone here. And I'm
not squeamish either. Didn't I offer to break in and put cyanide
of potassium in that whisky at Chelmsford, and didn't
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! shut up, Broome," reproved Colonel Jasper, frowning.
"Sarle's only making fun of you, and you never can take a joke.
You're most useful to us, and you can be sure if you hadn't
been," he smiled drily, and his voice dropped into a drawl.
"Friend Edgehill here would have been making a date with you by
the river, and you wouldn't be so full of burgundy as you are
now. Yes, yes," he went on irritably, "you're quite as big a
degenerate as any of us, only you're not quite as sane."</p>

<p>Broome subsided into silence as if quite satisfied, and then
Sarle said quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now we'll discuss those two other matters we've got in
hand."</p>

<p>For nearly two hours then they talked earnestly with their
heads close together. They consulted memoranda from a sheaf of
papers that Sarle produced from his pocket, and for a long time
they poured over a large ordinance map spread out upon the table.
Then gradually the conversation waned, the interjections grew
fewer and finally Sarle got up and threw nearly all the papers
into the fire.</p>

<p>"Then that's that," he announced, as he vigorously broke up
the ashes with the poker, "and we've got everything cut and
dried!" He resumed his place at the table and looked intently at
Dr. Shillington. "And now about this butler of yours; what are we
going to do?"</p>

<p>It was Edgehill who answered. He looked flushed, as if he had
had plenty to drink, and with very little provocation would
become quarrelsome. He took out his watch. "It's a quarter past
one," he said rather thickly, "and it's as good an hour as any in
the twenty-four to do a job neatly. The actions of the man are
suspicions, and we cannot allow for any risks. Therefore he must
vanish." He waved an arm round dramatically. "Exit butler No. 2.
R.I.P."</p>

<p>Sarle frowned and shook his head. "Shillington's under a cloud
already," he said sharply, "and we mustn't have the police here
again&mdash;of all places. Besides, when I consider it, although
I admit I am uneasy, I really don't see that we've got anything
very definite against him. It may have been only curiosity that
made him watch us through his glasses, and Shillington may be
quite mistaken about the peculiar conduct of the registry office
man." He looked sternly at Edgehill. "Now, we don't want to use a
sledge-hammer on a fly."</p>

<p>"But, damn it all, Sarle," protested Edgehill, angrily.
"Jasper's caught him out already about the Dyce-Browns. He's here
under false pretences at any rate, and it wants looking into." He
sneered. "You're getting weak now, but I'm for instant
action."</p>

<p>"Then get him in again, Shillington," said Sarle brusquely.
"We'll make up our minds this time."</p>

<p>In the meantime Larose had spent a very thoughtful two hours
alone in the kitchen. Every sense in him was acutely on the
alert, for he was sure evil was brewing under that very roof, and
he had deduced it to his own satisfaction in a very simple
manner.</p>

<p>Shillington was a man of crime, and invariably birds of a
feather flock together. Shillington had four friends with him,
and they had been closeted uninterrupted in the dining-room for
more than two hours. They had been talking all the time in very
low voices&mdash;Larose had crept to the door twice and
listened&mdash;and moreover they had hung something over the
keyhole so that no one should see through.</p>

<p>Therefore they had some very good reasons for secrecy, and
secrecy was the natural environment of crime. They were busy
hatching something.</p>

<p>And Larose himself had not been altogether idle.</p>

<p>He had carefully examined all their overcoats and hats, and
one very significant thing had struck him. Every mark of
identification everywhere had been taken out. All the tags from
every one of the coats had been unstitched and torn away, and
even the maker's names in the hats had been removed.</p>

<p>He had turned out the pockets of the overcoats and in the
right-hand ones of those of Sarle and Edgehill he had noticed two
similar things. They both smelt slightly of oil, and on the
linings there were faint grease marks, also it was plain that the
pockets sagged a little. "Machine oil and pistols," had been his
comment. "They've been carrying automatics."</p>

<p>He was sitting before the fire and thinking of these things
when suddenly the bell pinged.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, getting up, "and I suppose that means
they're going. Now I expect they'll want another good stare at
me." He frowned. "But I'd like to know what's in their minds.
They're thinking something, I'm sure." He looked at the kettle
simmering on the hob. "Well, I'll have a cup of tea before I go
to bed. I shall be back in a minute."</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. It was not destined that he should ever
come back.</p>

<p>He knocked at the dining-room door and entered and instantly
he sensed rather than saw that all eyes were upon him. Edgehill
was nearest, and he was lolling back with his chair against the
table, with his legs sprawled out.</p>

<p>"Bring some more glasses," said Dr. Shillington curtly, "and
the hot water and lemons."</p>

<p>"Very good sir," replied Larose, and he turned to go out.</p>

<p>"Oh! one moment," continued Dr. Shillington, "you were in
service with Sir John Dyce-Brown, I understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Larose, and his heart gave a great
bound.</p>

<p>"Where were his horses trained then, do you remember?" frowned
the doctor.</p>

<p>The face of Larose was bland and open as a little child's.
"No, sir," he replied promptly. "I was not interested in racing
Sir, and I didn't hear." He regarded the doctor without the
flicker of an eyelid. "I'm sorry, Sir."</p>

<p>There was a short silence, a silence crowded for Larose with a
hundred lightning thoughts, and then&mdash;the avalanche swept
upon him.</p>

<p>A fierce blow struck him behind both knees, his legs sank
under him, and he crashed backwards, as if he had been shot. His
head impinged upon the floor with a resounding thud.</p>

<p>"Seize his legs, quick," he heard someone shout, and a great
weight descended on his chest and his arms were pinioned to the
ground.</p>

<p>A horrible nausea came upon him, everything for the moment was
black before his eyes, and the voices he heard were very far
away. But he did not lose consciousness, and soon, very soon, his
brain began to function in its normal way.</p>

<p>"Trapped!" was his first thought. "I've been trapped. I was
ham-strung by that beast Edgehill, just like a horse. They were
too smart for me."</p>

<p>Then he heard Sarle say. "You dammed fool what have you
done?"</p>

<p>"Damned fool, yourself," came the voice of Edgehill. "I tell
you I felt the beating of his heart against the table. It was
going like a piston, and I knew then he was a 'tec."</p>

<p>A violent tug came at his trousers, and there was a hoarse
chuckle from Edgehill. "Ha! a pistol. A Bayard automatic!" A note
of triumph swelled into his voice. "Now, who's the damned fool,
Sarle, you or me?"</p>

<p>A minute later Larose opened his eyes weakly. He had been
dragged away from the table, and there were faces all about him.
Edgehill was holding him down, Colonel Jasper was elevating his
legs up in the air, and Sarle, with a grim smile, was tying his
ankles with two table napkins knotted together. Dr. Shillington
was looking at him with hate, and Broome was regarding him
curiously as a rare sort of animal that had just been caught.
Then he was jerked violently to his feet and thrown rather than
lifted into an armchair.</p>

<p>"Make a sound," gritted Sarle, between his teeth, "and I'll
wind you in the stomach. So keep quiet, it will be best for you.
Turn him over," he went on, "we'll tie his wrists now behind his
back. No, you don't," he snapped, and he shook Larose violently.
"He was making his muscles taut," he explained to the others.
"He's an old hand, sure enough. You were right, Edgehill, for
once."</p>

<p>And then Larose was turned round to face his adversaries, and
Sarle drew a chair up close to him and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Plenty of time," he laughed suavely, "we've all the night
before us." His expression changed and a deadly note crept into
his voice. "We're going to get at the bottom of this." His hand
shot out and he pointed his finger at the bound man. "Now, who
are you?"</p>

<p>Larose swallowed hard. He felt sick and giddy, and his head
was singing from the effects of the blow he had received, but his
mind was quite clear and he made no mistake at all to the peril
he was in. At the dead of night and with no help near he was now
a prisoner in the hands of a gang of crooks. He was completely at
their mercy and they were of that type of men, he knew, to whom
murder would be a very small matter where their safety was
concerned.</p>

<p>His condition could not be more desperate, but hopeless though
it seemed, he told himself he would not lose hope. He had been in
corners quite as tight before, he remembered, and he had yet
lived to see the sun rise and to triumph over his enemies. He
would grip the situation and continue to play the game. He would
admit nothing.</p>

<p>He blinked his eyes and looked round stupidly.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" reiterated Sarle savagely and he drew back a
hand that was clenched tightly.</p>

<p>Larose blinked harder man ever. "Frederick Mason, sir," he
replied. "I'm Fred Mason."</p>

<p>"You're a liar," returned Sarle, and his voice was low and
menacing.</p>

<p>Larose looked very frightened. "Yes, sir," he replied as
though he had not understood. "My name's Fred Mason."</p>

<p>Sarle breathed hard as if he were restraining himself with an
effort.</p>

<p>"What are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A butler, sir," Larose replied shakily. "Dr. Shillington's
butler, here."</p>

<p>Sarle snatched at the automatic that was lying on the table
and held it up.</p>

<p>"And you were carrying this gun!" he sneered. "A butler
carrying a gun."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Larose, and his voice quavered. "It's
mine."</p>

<p>"And what were you carrying it for then?" was the instant
question.</p>

<p>Larose looked very apologetically at Dr. Shillington. "I had
heard there had been trouble here, sir," he replied hesitantly,
"and I brought it down to protect myself."</p>

<p>Sarle regarded him with steely eyes. "You're lying," he said
slowly between set teeth. "You're not a butler. You come from the
police. You're a spy."</p>

<p>Larose's lips quivered. "Dr. Shillington engaged me, sir," he
said tremblingly, "from the service bureau. I'm here for three
weeks, I'm only the butler and I don't know why you're doing this
to me." His voice choked. "It frightens me."</p>

<p>A scowl crossed into Sarle's face and he looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"How long have you been a butler?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Sixteen years, sir," replied Larose.</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Forty-two, sir."</p>

<p>Broome interrupted suddenly. "That's not true," he said
emphatically. "He's much younger than that, you can tell by the
skin on his neck. He's not yet got a crease or a wrinkle there. I
should say he's not yet thirty."</p>

<p>Edgehill picked up a napkin and dashing some water upon it,
rubbed it roughly over Larose's face. Then he held it up for
inspection.</p>

<p>"A butler!" he sneered. "And look at his makeup. Why, he's got
no crows feat now. He's ten years younger."</p>

<p>"Who sent you here?" asked Dr. Shillington sternly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Channing, sir," replied Larose, and his voice shook in
earnest now. He felt the ground was in truth slipping from under
his feet.</p>

<p>"And you were butler at Dyce-Hall for five years, you say?"
snorted the doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Larose.</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper thrust himself forward. "Leave this to me," he
said quickly. "I'll settle things in two minutes. Now, Mr.
Mason," and his voice was very suave and polite, "you were five
years with Sir John, you tell us?" He paused a moment until
Larose had nodded "Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, what was he like?"</p>

<p>"Very tall, sir. He was Scotch and he had red hair."</p>

<p>"And he spoke with a Scotch accent?"</p>

<p>"With a very slight one, sir," replied Larose promptly, but
for all his promptitude he had not the remotest idea as to
whether he was stating a fact or not.</p>

<p>"And what is Dyce-Hall celebrated for?"</p>

<p>Larose looked puzzled. "It had very many beautiful things,
sir," he answered slowly. "It was a show place
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know that," interrupted Colonel Jasper irritably. "I have
been there myself. Now, no prevaricating. I asked you what it was
specially celebrated for? Come, come," for he saw Larose was
hesitating, "what does everyone notice directly they come into
the hall?"</p>

<p>"Oh! the paintings, sir," hazarded Larose, believing that any
answer would be better than none.</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper turned round to the others.</p>

<p>"That settles it," he said quietly, "the man's never been near
Dyce Hall. Everyone knows that the marble staircase there is the
most beautiful one in England, and Sir John has no Scotch accent
at all." He looked back at Larose with no feelings of antagonism
and smiled. "You're an impostor, Mr. Mason. That's plain."</p>

<p>A moment of intense silence followed, and for Larose it was as
if a blast of icy air had entered the room. It was a chamber of
death, and they were only considering the method of execution.
The end was very near.</p>

<p>"Slit his gizzard!" exclaimed Edgehill coarsely. "He's fairly
caught out and we're wasting time."</p>

<p>"Shooting's a dainty death," said Colonel Jasper reflectively.
"It's nicer for everyone, and leaves no unpleasant memories
behind."</p>

<p>"I vote for the hypodermic," said Broome, "and the way he dies
will add to our scientific knowledge, too."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington made a motion with his head, and he and Sarle
moved up to the end of the room.</p>

<p>"He's got to go," said the doctor in a low tone, "but you
can't do it here. You must take him away. I can't have any more
trouble in this house."</p>

<p>"Of course not," agreed Sarle readily. "We'll finish him but
we've got to get his secret first." His eyes glinted with the
cruelty of a devil. "I'll make him speak. If he's from Scotland
Yard we must get to know exactly why he came here."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington looked rather white. "Then it's serious if
they're on my trail."</p>

<p>"It's you they're after," said Sarle confidently. "It's about
Jakes that he's come here. They can have no idea of us. I'm not
worrying."</p>

<p>"Then he must disappear," said Dr. Shillington emphatically.
"I'll get all his things together at once and you must take them
away with him. Then to-morrow I'll ring up the registry office
and complain that he's left without notice. Come up with me to
his room now and help." He sighed heavily. "I shall be glad when
I'm in bed."</p>

<p>Sarle turned to Edgehill and Broome.</p>

<p>"You two go and get the car ready and don't make any noise.
Push it down the drive for fifty yards and don't start the engine
until we come. You, Jasper, look after that fool, and if he makes
a sound, stun him. Don't hesitate, hit him with the poker."</p>

<p>And so Colonel Jasper and Larose were left alone together, and
the latter sighed with relief that even for a few brief moments
at least, he was free from the malignant glances of Sarle. Sarle
he judged rightly, was the leader of the gang and he it would be,
who later would be the arbiter of his, Larose's, fate.</p>

<p>And Larose had no illusions at all as to what that fate would
be. He would be put to death after he had been tortured to
disclose what he knew. Then the black mud would be his winding
sheet and the deeps of the sea his tomb.</p>

<p>He looked round the room. It had a dissipated air as if it
were all suddenly turning from the decency and respectabilities
of life. The candles were guttering in their holders. There were
cigar ends and tobacco ashes spilt upon the table. The chairs
were disarranged anyhow and there was broken glass upon the
floor, from a decanter that Edgehill had knocked over when he had
struck his lightning blow.</p>

<p>Larose sighed heavily, wondering exactly how the end would
come, and then looking round, he found that Colonel Jasper was
regarding him intently.</p>

<p>"Sorry, young fellow," drawled the colonel, and he smiled in
quite a friendly fashion. "I regret I had to bowl you out, but
you're a danger to us and in consequence you've got to go." He
spoke in matter-of-fact tones. "You came after Shillington, of
course, but unluckily for you, you extended your enquiries, and
your meddling has involved you in consequences you must now be
prepared to face." He shook his head reprovingly. "You made a
grave error, my friend, in using your glasses on the island, just
as if we had not got glasses too. We were watching the same as
you were." He laughed. "Yes, that was a bad slip for a detective
from Scotland Yard, and it made us suspicious at once. Then
Edgehill took too much to drink and happened to score a bull's
eye by his brutality in knocking you down. We were intending only
to keep a fatherly eye on you until then for we were dubious
about you&mdash;you were acting so well." He shrugged his
shoulders. "But, of course, you know now what's going to happen,
and as a brave man, which I can see you are, it won't unduly
distress you." He paused a moment and suppressed a yawn with
difficulty. "You're going to die."</p>

<p>There was along silence, and Larose regarded him with burning
eyes. The fate that he now heard was intended for him, was, after
all, only the fate he was expecting, but yet the announcement of
it so baldly and in such an offhand manner, struck a chord of
dreadful horror in him, and almost froze his blood to ice. He
moistened his dry lips with his tongue, and in spite of all his
self-control, could not repress a shudder. He knew too, that his
cheeks were already blanching to the sickly hue of death.</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper turned his eyes away from him, but in a moment
began to talk in a quiet, conversational manner.</p>

<p>"And you take my advice, young fellow, and just you don't give
any trouble. You're a beaten man and so just give in, and when
Mr. Sarle questions you, tell him all we want to know. It will be
better for you in every way, although, of course, it won't make
the slightest difference in the end." He looked back at Larose.
"I mean you'll snuff it just the same, but you'll die quietly,
then. Just a prick of the hypodermic and you'll drop off to sleep
with your last thought perhaps that you've got the &pound;2,000
reward for the discovery of the Iron Man." He dropped his voice
warningly. "But if you're stubborn and won't speak, then it'll be
damned rotten for you, for Sarle has lived in the East and there
are ways that he knows of, of unloosening the tongue. I tell you,
Sarle's inhuman sometimes, and the cruellest beast I've ever
met." He looked pityingly at Larose. "Poor devil! I'm sorry for
you. Have a drink?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. Thirst was assailing him now, and he felt
rather faint.</p>

<p>"Whisky or brandy?" asked the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Brandy," replied Larose, and mixing a stiff dose, the Colonel
brought it over and held it up to his lips.</p>

<p>"Steady, don't gulp it," he said. "Ah! that's right. Feel
better? Now would you like a cigarette? No, no," he went on
quickly, "I'd better not do that. It might make Sarle vindictive.
He can be very spiteful, sometimes."</p>

<p>The door opened softly and Sarle and Dr. Shillington came in;
the latter was carrying Larose's suitcase.</p>

<p>"Look here, Jasper," laughed Sarle sardonically, "a nice
innocent butler this!" and he held up various articles for the
Colonel's inspection. "A bunch of skeleton keys, steel wires for
opening locks, half a box of pistol ammunition, and a little
memorandum book in code, with entries for every blessed day that
he's been here." He glared evilly at Larose. "It will be
interesting when he tells us what these entries mean&mdash;" he
nodded his head slowly, "in about half an hour when we get him
over at our place."</p>

<p>"I'd better give him a fiftieth of hyosine," said Dr.
Shillington thoughtfully. "That will keep him quiet."</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed Sarle instantly. "I don't want him fuddled
in any way. I want him mentally alert and&mdash;&mdash;" a
devilish expression crossed into his face, "as sensitive to pain
as possible. We'll gag him before we go out."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington suddenly strode over to Larose and bending
down, stared hard into his face.</p>

<p>"Why! I believe," he gasped in astonishment, "I
believe&mdash;no, damnation, I'm sure. It's the man that came
down with Carter and Stone the other day. He's the other
detective from Scotland Yard, and the one whom they called
'Larose.' Jasper says he's an Australian." Dr. Shillington's eyes
blazed with fury, and he seized viciously at a handful of
Larose's hair. "Look he can alter the shape of his face."</p>

<p>Larose wilted under the pain and kicking violently at the
doctor's shins made him leave go, but the latter, livid with
rage, swung up his fist for revenge when Sarle leaped forward and
pushed him violently back.</p>

<p>"No, he's not yours," he panted, and he could hardly get his
breath. "If he's Larose, he's mine. He got my brother hanged in
Sydney, and the only hands that hurt him shall be mine. But are
you sure," he asked anxiously, "are you sure this is the man they
called Larose?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," snarled Dr. Shillington. "I recognise him plainly
now that the lines are off his face."</p>

<p>Sarle sighed very gently, he was evidently holding himself in
with a great effort.</p>

<p>"This is wonderful," he said slowly, "he's come twelve
thousand miles to meet me, and now&mdash;&mdash;" He narrowed his
eyes gloatingly and wreathed his features in the smile of a
mocking devil. "I shall torture him until life will seem the
cruellest thing on earth and sudden death the highest form of
ecstasy." He snapped his teeth together, and clenching his fist
drew back his arm with slow deliberation.</p>

<p>But Colonel Jasper pulled him roughly to one side.</p>

<p>"Don't strike him here, you fool," he cried sharply. "If he
calls out, the maids may hear him and remember. Shillington's got
to bear the brunt of this to-morrow. All Scotland Yard will be
here within two hours when it's known this man is missing. Larose
is not an ordinary policeman, and they'll not take his
disappearance kindly by any means."</p>

<p>"Then we'll gag him," snapped Sarle. "Get another napkin."</p>

<p>"But you'll do nothing here," persisted the colonel doggedly.
"I won't have it. Damn it all man, before you take your private
vengeance, you've got to consider the rest of us. We want you to
find out what this fellow knows, why he came down, and what
they're suspecting at the yard. Don't you forget we're all in it
up to the neck, and it's not your private affairs by a long
chalk."</p>

<p>Sarle hesitated a moment. "All right," he said suddenly. "Have
your own way." He flashed a baleful glance at Larose. "My
business will wait."</p>

<p>The door opened and Edgehill appeared. "All ready," he said.
"We've pushed the car down the drive."</p>

<p>Sarle inclined his head curtly towards Larose. "Gag him,
Jasper," he said, "and you and Edgehill bring him along. Nip his
throat if he makes a sound. He can walk with short steps if you
hold his arms," and picking up the suitcase and followed by Dr.
Shillington, he very quietly left the room.</p>

<p>Tying a large knot in the middle of a napkin, Colonel Jasper
approached Larose.</p>

<p>"Open your mouth," he said sharply, "and bite on this. Don't
monkey about, and I won't tie it too tightly." He adjusted the
napkin to his satisfaction. "Now, up you come, and mind&mdash;no
tricks. We're not going to carry you, and you won't stumble if
you go slowly."</p>

<p>But apparently it was not as easy for Larose to walk as the
colonel had predicted, for the detective had not taken a dozen
steps before he slipped and fell heavily upon his back. Edgehill
jerked him to his feet with a curse.</p>

<p>"Damn you for a clumsy fool. Do that again when we're in the
hall and you'll have a kick that'll make you wince."</p>

<p>But Larose did not fall a second time, and gripped on either
side the journey was safely negotiated until they reached the
hall door.</p>

<p>The night was almost pitch dark, and his guards stood still
for a moment to get their bearings.</p>

<p>"There's the car," said Edgehill at last, and he began to tug
Larose roughly forward.</p>

<p>"No, I think we'll carry him now," said the colonel. "We don't
want any shuffle marks on the gravel to be seen when it gets
light." His voice was hoarse in his earnestness. "No, by gosh, we
don't. We shall have some of the sharpest eyes in England round
this place within twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"But Shillington needn't say anything," growled Edgehill. "Let
those who are interested in the brute find out."</p>

<p>"Oh! that won't do," replied the colonel emphatically.
"Shillington must ring up the registry office people at once, for
it'll look suspicious if he doesn't. He must get in first. Come
on, you take his shoulders, and I'll have his legs. You're
stronger than I."</p>

<p>And so Larose was carried to the car and bundled down roughly
on to the floor at the back.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll ring up," he heard Dr. Shillington say, "and
complain of the way I've been treated. I'll say he got
intoxicated last night and was insolent when I reproved him. Then
I'll tell them he stole the key of the gates&mdash;I'll leave it
in the lock after I've shown you out&mdash;and decamped with all
his things before anyone was up."</p>

<p>"That'll do," replied Colonel Jasper; "but be sure you make a
great fuss. Curse them like hell for sending such a chap down;
tell them they ought to have known better."</p>

<p>They all got into the car with Sarle at the wheel, but it was
some minutes before the car would start. The self-starter was
ineffective, and finally Edgehill had to get out and swing the
handle.</p>

<p>"Damn," swore Sarle, "there's water in the carburetter and
we're making enough noise to wake the whole asylum."</p>

<p>They got away at last, and after Dr. Shillington had seen them
through the lodge gates, the car crept slowly along the marsh
road. A mist had risen, and they had to proceed carefully.</p>

<p>Larose's head was just by Colonel Jasper's feet, and the
latter, bending down at a moment when the others were talking
loudly, whispered to the detective.</p>

<p>"Now, you do as I tell you, and answer every question that we
ask you, then if Sarle is making you suffer too much, I'll pistol
you, I promise you." He patted Larose on the cheek. "I won't see
you badly tortured."</p>

<p>But with Larose there was no certainty at all that he was
going to be tortured, for he was very hopeful that he had not as
yet, by any means, exhausted all the possibilities of the
situation.</p>

<p>He was wondering, in which pocket Edgehill had got the little
automatic, and he was gently slashing at the napkin round his
wrists with the piece of broken decanter that he had picked up
when he had deliberately thrown himself down upon the dining-room
floor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE RESOURCE OF LAROSE.</h2>

<p class="first">IT was little more than a mile from the asylum
gates to the bank of the river, but their progress was slow, for
Sarle was obliged to drive most carefully. The road was narrow,
and the surface so slippery, that even a slight skid might have
landed them instantly axle-deep into the soft marshlands over the
side.</p>

<p>No one spoke for a minute or two, all of them being apparently
engrossed in peering ahead for the incidence of some possible
mishap. A slight rain was falling, and it was very dark inside
the car.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Broome, who, along with Colonel Jasper, was
occupying the back seat, flashed his torch upon the prostrate
figure of the detective on the floor of the car.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked the colonel sharply when the scrutiny had
persisted for quite an appreciable number of seconds.</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing particular," replied Broome carelessly. "But I
was only just wondering whether his shoes would fit me. They look
in good condition, and the stitching's come undone in one of
mine."</p>

<p>"And what about his trousers?" sneered the colonel. "Why not
take them, too?"</p>

<p>"They'd be much too short," said Broome, appearing to take his
companion's remark quite seriously, "and I don't fancy them,
either. It's funny," he went on meditatively. "If he were a real
butler now, the very idea of his shoes would be quite
unthinkable, but with a detective, I shall have no compunction.
Something of the idea of the spoils of war, I suppose."</p>

<p>The colonel made no comment, but bending down over Larose
untied the napkin about his mouth. "You can shout as much as you
like now, young shaver," he remarked, and he tossed the napkin
over to Broome. "And here's another thing you can have, Broome,"
he sneered. "It'll do for a pocket handkerchief."</p>

<p>They reached the river bank at last. It was just after high
tide, and the swollen waters were rushing back towards the sea.
Edgehill got out to open the doors of the shed.</p>

<p>"Damn!" swore Sarle, "the engine's stalled. We'll push the car
in, and take off the carburetter to-morrow. I'm not going to be
bothered with any more trying to start the engine now at this
time of night." He turned to Colonel Jasper. "Get the boat ready
and take that brute down with you. He'll never undo those knots I
tied, but still, don't let him out of your sight for a second.
He's got the reputation of being a monkey for his tricks. So look
out."</p>

<p>The colonel and Broome pulled Larose out of the car, and the
former was for making him walk the few intervening yards between
them and the boat.</p>

<p>"No," protested Broome quickly; "let's carry him. It's no good
getting those shoes muddy. They're indoor ones, remember."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper snorted, but with no remark, picked up Larose's
legs while Broome took the weight of the shoulders.</p>

<p>The detective was bumped roughly into the bottom of a boat
that was drawn up out of reach of the water. It was a large,
roomy boat, built for sea work, obviously. Its sides were high
and it smelt strongly of fish.</p>

<p>"We'll push it down," said Colonel Jasper, "and get out the
oars. Then it'll be all ready and Sarle will have nothing to work
himself into a temper about. He's just crazy to get his hands on
this chap. You shall row across."</p>

<p>They pushed the boat into the water and Broome got in ready,
whilst the Colonel stood holding the painter. The water was
running strongly and the latter twisted the rope round a mooring
post.</p>

<p>"Hell," he exclaimed, "but the old river's high to-night. I
shouldn't like to have to swim across."</p>

<p>And then suddenly they heard Edgehill shout. "I say, one of
you chaps come up and help. We can't get the car out of the
mud."</p>

<p>"You go, Broome," said the Colonel, "I'm not feeling too good.
Late hours don't suit me and I'm fagged out." He grinned. "I
won't pinch his shoes."</p>

<p>Without a word then Broome got out of the boat and walked
leisurely up in the direction of the car with the Colonel
watching him with an amused smile. Up to now Larose had been
lying quite still at the bottom of the boat. He had got his hands
free at last, at the price of one slightly cut wrist, but he had
been hesitating about any attack upon the napkin that bound his
ankles because of Broome's torch and the fear that it might be
flashed again.</p>

<p>But now with Broome out of the way, he sat up instantly and
began to slash feverishly at the napkins, to realise, however,
that his piece of glass was an altogether ineffective instrument
now. He had broken the edges and it was too blunt to be of any
service at all. He drew in a deep breath of disappointment. It
was no good, he was quite certain, to attempt tackling the knots
in the dark. They were true sailor knots, as he had seen when
they were being tied, and would take much longer to undo than the
short time that he was sure would be allowed him.</p>

<p>His thoughts coursed like lightning through him.</p>

<p>He reckoned that he had at most about three minutes to act
before they would have got the car shut up in the shed and be
down themselves by the boat. He must throw himself into the
river, of course, and if he could not unshackle his legs, then he
must risk it and take to the water as he was.</p>

<p>Ah! But he couldn't expect to get into the riven even, without
the Colonel seeing him and the alarm being given. The Colonel was
barely twelve feet away and with his face turned sideways as it
was, any movement above the boat level would draw his eyes round
at once. Yes, he, Larose, would have time to jump in the river
right enough, but then&mdash;what would happen?</p>

<p>They would all come rushing down and there could be but one
end to his venture.</p>

<p>They would know for certain the only possible direction in
which he could have gone, for no one could swim upstream against
that current, running as it was now. They would be sure then that
he must be escaping down the river.</p>

<p>So, instantly they would put out in the boat to follow after
him, and in that narrow stream, with Broome's electric torch, and
with his own pistol in the possession of Edgehill, what possible
chance had he of escaping discovery, and at best, a sudden
death?</p>

<p>There seemed to be no hope at all for him, he thought, but
then all at once his heart began to beat furiously, as another
idea swept like an avalanche into his mind. Whatever they might
do, they should not follow him in the boat, at any rate.</p>

<p>Very softly he groped for the oars. He passed his hand along
and gripped one in the middle, then crouching down he lifted it
just above the side of the boat, and dropped it gently over into
the river. It fell with a sound that was hardly perceptible above
the gurgling of the water. Then he did the same with the
other.</p>

<p>Then with his burning eyes fixed intently upon the silent
figure by the mooring-post, he began feeling for the plug that he
knew such a boat as he was in would have. He found it at once,
where he expected it, and with a vigorous twist it came out into
his hand. Instantly the water began rushing in, and he shuddered
to feel how chilly it was. He whipped off his coat, and with his
heart beating more fiercely than ever, was about to rise to his
feet and plunge into the river when yet another thought struck
him.</p>

<p>No, he would still do nothing for a few moments. He saw that
they had now got the car on the move, and he would wait, if
possible, until it was safely garaged in the shed. He remembered
the searchlight and the fierce beam it had thrown the other
night. It would pick him out easier than a hundred torches when
he was floating down the liver, but if the car were in the shed,
then they would not be able to turn it on in time to be of any
use.</p>

<p>He waited one minute&mdash;two&mdash;and the boat was now
settling down so quickly in the water that in another sixty
seconds almost, he reckoned, he would be able to slip over
without being seen. Then suddenly Colonel Jasper turned his head.
Perhaps it might have been that he just looked round casually to
see how the prisoner was getting on, or, perhaps, it came to him
that there was no pull now on the rope round the mooring-post,
and sub-consciously he was wondering why. At any rate, he looked
round, and he was galvanised into action at once.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick!" he shouted, "the boat's sinking," and he
sprang forward to make sure of Larose.</p>

<p>But he was just two seconds too late, for Larose, retaining
his presence of mind, and intending to give the impression that
he was still held fast by his bonds, with his hands clasped tight
behind him, had rolled over the boat-side into the river. The icy
waters closed over him without a sound, and with all the air
expelled from his lungs he sank like a stone.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick!" shouted Colonel Jasper again. "He's got away.
He's thrown himself into the river."</p>

<p>Instantly there were loud answering shouts from the direction
of the shed, and the others came tearing down.</p>

<p>"Hell!" shouted Edgehill. "Give me the torch, quick. Quick,
you damned fool," and he snatched it from Broome. He flashed it
all round the fast-filling boat, and then down upon the
river.</p>

<p>But there was no sign of Larose anywhere. Only the black,
sullen waters and the oily banks of mud.</p>

<p>"Follow him down," roared Sarle, and his voice was hoarse with
fury. "He must come up in a moment, and we'll see him then."</p>

<p>Larose held his breath until he felt that his chest was almost
at the bursting point, and then he rose gently to the surface. He
found that he was close to the bank on the marsh-side, and he
heard shouting and hoarse voices behind him. He dived again
instantly, to make diagonally now across the river, and, as
before, remained under as long as he could. When he came up this
second time he was well under the island bank, and he saw dim
figures running along the marsh, led by one who was flashing the
torch. To his delight they had passed him, and were now a good
fifty yards lower down the river.</p>

<p>He was chilled to the bone, and a feeling of faintness was
coming over him, but with a great effort he pulled himself on to
the bank, and tottering a few yards, dropped down exhausted upon
the grass.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he heard a shout of triumph, and then the sound
of rapid firing. Six shots he counted and then came loud excited
voices.</p>

<p>"It's my coat they've shot," he grinned weakly, "and of course
they're thinking I'm inside it." He closed his eyes again for a
few seconds, but then sat up shakily and drew in a deep
breath.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Gilbert," he murmured, "this won't do. You must
make a move quickly, or you'll catch your death of cold. Besides,
they may be back any minute now, and if they happen to flash
their torch this way, they may catch sight of you yet." He sighed
heavily. "Now for these darned napkins. They'll be the deuce of a
job to untie with my frozen fingers."</p>

<p>But to his surprise the knots came undone quite easily. The
soaked linen was soft, and yielding, and in a minute he was
standing up, freed from his bonds.</p>

<p>"Now for a quick run," he told himself, and at first, very
falteringly, but with increasing strength every moment as the
blood began to circulate more strongly, he ran in the direction
of where he knew the island house must lie.</p>

<p>It seemed to him quite a matter of course that he should make
for this house, for with his enemies, at any rate for the moment,
out of action, all its contents would be at his disposal, and he
would be able to get a change of dry clothes straight away.</p>

<p>He had a great horror of catching cold, and, indeed, he feared
pneumonia far more than he did any automatic pistol. Even when he
had been many feet down in the muddy water of the river, he had
been speculating as to where later, if he escaped, he should be
getting dry clothes, and as he ran now his chief thought was as
to whose spare garments, Sarle's or Colonel Jasper's, would fit
him the better. The idea of either Edgehill's or Broome's he had
dismissed at once. The former was too stout, and the latter too
tall.</p>

<p>And then suddenly he burst into a hearty laugh. How completely
were the tables turned, and how surely now was he holding them
all in the hollow of his hand.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;on the surface how dreadful everything seemed
for him.</p>

<p>He was on a lonely island in the dead of night. A bitter wind
was blowing, and he was hatless and coatless, with soaking
garments clinging to him and with the water squelching in his
shoes at every stride. He was slimed all over in black mud from
head to foot. He was surrounded by enemies, and he had no weapon,
and his fingers were so frozen that he could not possibly have
made use of one if it had been there. There was no help near; he
had no friends, and any salvation that would come to him he must
work out for himself.</p>

<p>Ah! but there was the other side of the picture, and how
different it was to look upon.</p>

<p>He was close near a nice comfortable house, and big warm fire.
There was no one in the house but a deaf old woman, and she would
certainly have been in bed and fast asleep, hours ago. The house
had a massive iron-studded door, but he was not expecting that it
would be locked, for its occupants, from the lonely nature of
their surroundings, were living in fancied security, as he had
already seen by the flimsy nature of the fastenings upon their
windows. Well, he would creep into that house, he would shoot the
heavy bolts upon that door, and he would take off his awful
garments before that big, warm fire. He would be quite safe for a
little, for that very water that had soaked him and that very mud
that had slimed him, now stretched like an inviolate girdle
between him and those who wished him ill.</p>

<p>Well, he would warm himself deliciously; he would mix himself
a stiff brandy and soda, and then he would creep round into the
bedrooms and find come nice warm clothes somewhere.</p>

<p>Yes, and he would arm himself, too. He would no longer be
without a means of defence. There would be pistols there in
plenty, one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;he was sure. And he would
take them all, and he would see that they were loaded, and
then&mdash;then he would unbolt that massive door and in the
shadows of the room await the coming of his enemies.</p>

<p>When the river had gone down, in two hours, perhaps three, in
the ghostly light of the grey dawn his enemies would walk into an
ambush, and his only regret would be that he would not be able to
let them linger in their horrible surprise.</p>

<p>He reached the house, and for a few moments stood outside,
squeezing as much of the water as he could out of his clothes. It
was in his mind that there should be as few indications as
possible that any stranger had crossed the threshold. He looked
back over the river, and saw that the flashlight was now bobbing
up and down almost opposite to where he now stood. His pursuers
were evidently now returning to the jettisoned boat.</p>

<p>He gently turned the handle of the door, and as he expected
the door yielded to his hand.</p>

<p>Pushing it open only just sufficiently to admit of his body
squeezing in, he passed inside and pulled it to behind him.</p>

<p>He found himself in a small porch with another door opening
from it into the house. There was a streak of light showing
underneath this door.</p>

<p>The front door boasted two massive bolts which, however, from
their appearance, looked as if they had not been used for many
years, and an enormous key in a big lock. He turned the key with
some difficulty.</p>

<p>"Now, at any rate, I'm safe for the moment," he muttered, "and
they won't come upon me unawares. In this charming little drama
we are playing, it will be for me to speak next. Now what's
behind this other door?" and with a quickly beating heart he
turned the handle. The door opened outwards, and pulling it
towards him he was faced by a large curtain. He stealthily pulled
the curtain aside, to find that the room was untenanted.</p>

<p>He smiled to himself. There was the bright fire that he had
anticipated, and there was the spirit tantalus upon the
table.</p>

<p>In a few seconds he had stripped off his soaking garments, and
was luxuriously bringing back the warmth to his frozen body. It
had evidently been washing day in the house, for in one corner of
the room there was a big clothes horse and upon it, amongst other
things, was hanging a large bath towel.</p>

<p>"Excellent," he exclaimed gleefully, "they might almost have
been aware that I should come," and he began to rub himself down
vigorously, looking round intently at the same time upon
everything in the room.</p>

<p>Now that he came to take it in fully and his attention was not
distracted by anybody in it, he saw that in spite of its large
size it was essentially a cosy room. All draughts everywhere were
excluded by thick curtains, and the stained wood flooring was
covered generously with thick rugs. In addition to a large sofa,
there were half a dozen big armchairs, and the whole appearance
of the place was one of solid comfort rather than of show.</p>

<p>He dried himself quickly, and after the stiff brandy and soda
that he had promised himself, he thought it time that he should
begin to look about for some clothes.</p>

<p>"I mustn't underrate them again," he frowned, "and it's quite
likely they may raise the boat and then one of them swim over and
get another pair of oars. They are sure to have spares in the
boathouse, and there'll be a dinghy, too, belonging to the motor
launch. No, I mustn't underrate them. They may turn up at any
moment, now."</p>

<p>He wrapped the bath towel round him and, picking up one of
three electric torches that he saw upon the mantelshelf, he
tiptoed to the other curtain on the far side of the room and
pulled it to one side.</p>

<p>A long, dark passage stretched before him, with many rooms
opening out on either side.</p>

<p>"Now I wonder which is Sarle's bedroom," he whispered, "and
where the old woman sleeps."</p>

<p>He crept down the passages. Some of the doors were ajar, but
he dared not use his torch, so after a few yards he stood still,
listening, and then&mdash;he smiled. He had heard the
unmistakeable sound of a snore.</p>

<p>"Now I'm all right," was his comment. "I know where she
sleeps," and he quickly pushed open the first door, opposite to
him, and flashed his light.</p>

<p>It was quite a well-furnished bedroom that met his eye. A good
carpet, dainty modern furniture, and pictures on the wall. A
shining brass bedstead, a big roll-top desk, and a wardrobe of
capacious size. Nothing of the hermit-bachelor type about it, it
was as comfortable a bedroom as any man could wish.</p>

<p>There was a row of bottles on a shelf and a large box of cough
lozenges on a table before the window.</p>

<p>"Jasper's," exclaimed Larose gleefully, "and his clothes will
just about fit me," he pulled open the wardrobe door, "and there
are tons of them here to choose from, too."</p>

<p>A thought struck him. "But I must have a pistol first!" he
frowned. "I'm like a rat in a trap until I get that."</p>

<p>He tried the desk, but it was locked, and then the chest of
drawers, but he had no luck, and at once he became anxious.</p>

<p>"I'll find Edgehill's room," he muttered. "He'll be more
careless, perhaps," and he darted into the passage.</p>

<p>But the next room, equally as well furnished, was undoubtedly
Sarle's. The clothes there belonged to a man whose figure was
slim, there was a plug of tobacco upon the table, a sextant and a
telescope upon the chest of drawers, and two pictures of ships up
on the wall.</p>

<p>"My sailor-man," he ejaculated, smiling, "and the leader of
the gang, the Iron Man."</p>

<p>There was a desk here, as in the other room, before the
window, but it was open, and he began to pull feverishly at the
drawers. The first contained only papers, but with the opening of
the second, his heart leaped. There were more papers, but right
on top of them was lying an automatic. He snatched it up
thankfully. It was loaded.</p>

<p>"Now, for the spare ammunition!" he whispered. "It isn't
likely to be far away."</p>

<p>But it was not anywhere in that drawer nor in the next, but in
the lowest one, the largest, he was amply rewarded, for, in
addition to the ammunition he was looking for, he found to his
astonishment a perfect armory of lethal weapons. Three brand new
automatics in their cardboard boxes, three others that evidently
had seen service, and a large cavalry revolver.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he whistled, "and I suppose he doles them out to the
gang when they're going into action, and perhaps he takes on
extra hands, like a contractor, when he's got a big job on." He
frowned thoughtfully. "Now what the devil am I going to do?" He
began to shiver. "But I'll think when I'm dressing. I'm getting
cold."</p>

<p>He darted back into Colonel Jasper's room and was quickly
selecting some clothes. The colonel was evidently most
extravagant in his habits, and there was a wide profusion of
garments at his choice. "He's got more than he can keep count
of," was Larose's comment, "and he'll not notice if any of them
are missing. Now for the shoes, and here, I think&mdash;&mdash;"
he smiled grimly. "I'll call on friend Broome for a pair. It
seems we take about the same size."</p>

<p>He picked out Broome's room without difficulty, for an indoor
shoe with an unstitched seam was one of a pair by the bed that
immediately caught his eye. He quickly found what he thought
would suit him and then grinned to himself. "He'll miss these, of
course, but then he appears to be so darned untidy that he'll
probably think he's mislaid them somewhere." He looked round the
room. "Oh! but I'd like to have half an hour here. Chemicals,
fuses, and books on explosives! Then he's the bank expert of the
firm. I was wondering what use they could have for him. He's
quite a different type of criminal to the others."</p>

<p>He was back in the big living-room the next minute and then he
paused and frowned.</p>

<p>"But what am I to do?" he asked himself. "I've got to make an
instant decision now, and what's it going to be? I can get away
without difficulty and bring the Yard down upon them like a pack
of wolves, I know that. But what's going to happen then? What's
going to be the charge we have against them. They seized me and
meant murder, but where's the proof? My bare word against theirs,
and even then, what could we do?" He screwed his eyes up in
perplexity. "And if we make a search here what shall we find?
Pistols and ammunition, but their possession doesn't constitute a
crime. And what else? Nothing that will actually incriminate
them, I'm sure, or they wouldn't be leaving this place open like
they do. No, any booty that they may have taken will have been
parted with to the fences at once, quick and lively. It's not
likely to be hidden here. And then the men themselves? It's all
supposition as yet on my part when I say they've got a history,
and when we do find out exactly who they are, we may be no better
off. Sarle may certainly turn out to be an old lag&mdash;he looks
it more than any of the others, but then he may have served his
time, and as far as the law's concerned, may have entirely purged
the offence. Jasper may be a swell mobsman, but there may be no
charge now hanging over him, and the same with Edgehill and
Broome as well. They may be all suspect, all known bad
characters&mdash;but I can hardly think that of Broome&mdash;and
that is simply why they are lying hid. That may be the sole
reason for their living in this lonely place. Each of them,
singly, they may be arguing, will not be unduly interesting to
the authorities, but once it is known that they are all together,
then they are perhaps afraid that suspicion may be aroused at
once that they have some job on."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head, and a stern look came into his
eyes.</p>

<p>"No, no, it's not the time to strike now. This is a house of
evil, and we must uncover its guilty secret for the world. I must
not ring down the curtain upon this little drama, yet. The play
has only just begun. I'll watch them and see what they are at, so
I'll stay and live with them for a little while. I'll be their
star boarder, unbeknown." He rubbed his hands gleefully together.
"And I could not surely be going to be taken into the family
under more agreeable conditions. No references demanded, no
payment in advance, and no suggestion that my luggage is
inadequate in any way."</p>

<p>A clock upon the mantel-shelf struck two, and the amusement
died instantly from his face.</p>

<p>"Ah! but I must be quick, and run to earth now." He glanced
round the room. "Yes, I'll have to sleep here to-night at
whatever risk. I can't go out into the cold again. Behind that
sofa will do for me. It'll be nice and warm, and it's in the
shadows, too. They'll never dream of looking anywhere. They'll
come home like bears with sore heads, and after more drink,
they'll tumble into bed. I know them and their kind."</p>

<p>He took off his shoes again. "But I must see first if I can
get upstairs without having to go outside. It will simplify
matters a lot if I can manage it."</p>

<p>He ran into the passage and up the staircase, but found, to
his disappointment, that the stout door at the top was locked,
and there was no sign of any key.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he sighed, "but if only I had time! The key is probably
somewhere quite handy, if only I knew where. And that door will
be always a menace to me while they've got the key. I shall think
of them creeping upon me when I'm asleep."</p>

<p>Three minutes later he had completed all his preparations for
the remainder of the night.</p>

<p>He had made a bundle of the wet things he had taken off, and
tucked them behind the sofa. He had taken a large blanket, one of
many that were there, from a big linen cupboard, and a pillow
from one of the several beds in what was obviously the spare
room.</p>

<p>He had annexed one of the automatics in the cardboard boxes,
leaving, however, the box still there to retard any discovery of
the loss. He had helped himself also to a spare fifty rounds of
ammunition and loaded the pistol. Then he had gone back
everywhere and as far as possible had removed all traces of his
having touched anything. Finally he had taken a couple of Colonel
Jasper's aniseed cough lozenges to ease his throat, that he now
imagined was beginning to feel sore. Then he unlocked the front
door again and prepared to ensconse himself snugly down behind
the sofa.</p>

<p>He paused for one moment, however, when passing before the
fire, reluctant to withdraw even a short distance away from its
genial warmth, and then suddenly&mdash;his hair stood up on end
and his heart almost stopped beating.</p>

<p>He heard a sound coming from somewhere in the passage. It was
a slow, shuffling sound, just behind the curtain, and he acted
like lightning.</p>

<p>There was not time to gain his hiding-place behind the sofa,
and so he slid down into a high-backed armchair that was close
near him. He whipped out his automatic and, in a crouching
position with hard, staring eyes, peered out round the chair
towards the far end of the room.</p>

<p>The oil lamp hanging from the ceiling was turned very low, and
it was the firelight mainly that lit up the room. There were
shadows everywhere.</p>

<p>He heard the sound again, and slowly, very slowly then, a
gnarled hand came round the curtain and pulled it aside. A bent
old woman came limping into the room. She was attired in a faded
old dressing gown and her head was wrapped round in a big shawl.
Her eyes were screwed up tightly, and she walked falteringly as
if she were not very sure of her steps.</p>

<p>"Old Mother Heggarty," whispered Larose, and he slipped the
automatic at once back into his pocket.</p>

<p>The old woman walked unsteadily to the mantelshelf and peered
closely into the face of the clock. Then she picked up a lump of
coal and dropped it on the fire.</p>

<p>"It's cold, it's cold," she crooned, "but I'm always cold
now."</p>

<p>She suddenly lifted up her head and sniffed, then she took a
step forward and bent down over the chair that was sheltering the
huddled-up Larose.</p>

<p>"You're late, Master Alan," she muttered thickly. "Better be
in bed, like me." She began to shuffle away slowly, "I'm always
tired."</p>

<p>"Whew!" murmured Larose. "She smelt the cough lozenge." He
sighed heavily. "Really, I'm making a lot of mistakes."</p>

<p>Waiting only just until the old woman had disappeared behind
the curtain, the detective sprang up and crossed over to his
improvised bed behind the sofa.</p>

<p>"But no more chances, Gilbert," he frowned. "You're up to the
neck in trouble as it is." He pulled the blanket round him and
closed his eyes. "And I'll have just a little sleep now until my
family come home."</p>

<p>And then silence fell upon the house, the long lonely house in
its evil setting of rain, darkness, and the moaning sea.</p>

<p>Larose slept for about half an hour, a quiet, refreshing
sleep, made all the sweeter by his last waking memory of the
uncomfortable conditions outside.</p>

<p>Then he awoke with a start. He had heard voices in the
distance, and instantly he was on the alert. From his position
under the sofa he could command a good view of the greater part
of the room.</p>

<p>The front door was opened noisily, and the four men tramped
in.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" swore Edgehill. "Shut that door quick, Broome,
and don't let the draught in. You're looney again to-night and
quite off your nut."</p>

<p>They took off their dripping overcoats and flung them
anywhere. Then the lamp was turned up and they all helped
themselves to a drink. After that they sat down and pulled their
chairs up to the fire. Three of them at any rate, were in a vile
temper, and they each showed it in a different way.</p>

<p>Sarle was ghastly pale and his lips were compressed tightly.
Edgehill was scowling sullenly, and Colonel Jasper was flushed
and with a sneering devil-may-care expression on his face. It was
only Broome who looked quite imperturbable, and it was he who
spoke first.</p>

<p>"I say, Jasper," he said, "that old woman of yours has been
appropriating your cough lozenges. Aniseed has at all times a
very overpowering smell and it is obtained from an annual plant
whose leaves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! shut up!" burst out Sarle angrily. "You go to bed,
Broome. It's nearly three o'clock, and we've got something
important to talk over. If we don't look out, you'll be in
Dartmoor within a month."</p>

<p>"Climate salubrious in summer," commented Broome, "but too
unpleasantly rigorous in winter. I've seen the prison there," and
then as if Sarle's words had accidentally reminded him that bed
was a desirable place at that time of the night, he sauntered
carelessly from the room.</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments, and then Sarle, speaking
obviously with a great effort at restraint, said
slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what are we going to do? In my opinion, the position's
serious."</p>

<p>Edgehill had gulped down his second whisky and seemed now in a
slightly more cheerful frame of mind.</p>

<p>"It's no good us grousing," he said judicially. "The thing's
done, and we've got to make the best of it. We're all to blame a
bit. I ought to have given Jasper the pistol. He ought never to
have taken his eyes off the bird, and you oughtn't to have
frightened the beggar so, that he preferred suicide to the
torture you were promising him." He shook his head emphatically.
"But he's dead now, so what does it matter?"</p>

<p>"But can we be sure that he's dead," sneered Sarle, "You've
told us that several times, but&mdash;&mdash;" he looked
thoughtfully into the fire, "you've not convinced me."</p>

<p>"But I tell you again," ejaculated Edgehill irritably. "I saw
his legs jerk up as he went down, and I distinctly saw then those
damned cloths that you'd tied round his legs." He turned back in
his chair. "And didn't you, Jasper, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the colonel wearily, and as if he were tired of
discussing it, "you hit him twice, and by now he's well out to
sea."</p>

<p>"And, good Lord!" protested Edgehill, turning back again to
Sarle, "you know what I can do with a pistol, and do you think
that I could possibly have missed? Why, man, it wasn't an inch
above ten yards."</p>

<p>The angry face of Sarle relaxed and he looked more
amiable.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll leave it at that," he said. "Perhaps you may be
right." He turned to Colonel Jasper. "Sorry, Jasper," he went on,
"but you can understand why I was riled. I've never been more
disappointed in all my life."</p>

<p>"You've got a rasp of a tongue, Sarle," replied the colonel
coldly, "and there's nothing of the gentleman about you when
you're in a rage." He looked contemptuously at him. "So, in
future, please, when I offend you, I shall esteem it a favor if
you do not apply the adjective diseased to me. All the other
things you mentioned, I may quite possibly be. I don't complain
there, but my state of health," he yawned wearily, "is a private
matter for me alone, and does not add to the force of your
arguments in any way."</p>

<p>"All right," said Sarle tersely. "I repeat, I'm sorry." He
smiled again. "I can't afford to quarrel with you. We shall both
be hanged together one day. But now," he went on sternly, "this
business to-night is, as I say, serious, and we must change all
our plans."</p>

<p>"We shall have to lie low," said Colonel Jasper carelessly,
"at any rate for a while."</p>

<p>"Yes," added Sarle quickly, "and it'll be a miracle almost if
we're not dragged in now." He shook his head frowningly. "As you
said, Jasper, the Yard won't take this lying down, and directly
it is known that Larose has disappeared, they'll spread their net
far wider than Shillington and his damned asylum."</p>

<p>"Shillington bungled," growled Edgehill, "and he's let us in
for all this."</p>

<p>"Yes, he bungled right enough," agreed Sarle, "but we don't
know where, and I'm sure they can have no suspicion at present of
Shillington himself. They only sent their crack man down to the
Court because the butler was killed in this marked area of Essex.
Then, something Shillington or the servants said or from
something Shillington had done which he hasn't mentioned to us,
their suspicions were aroused that the man's death was a local
affair, and so they straightaway planted Larose in the house to
find out. What I mean is that up to now they can have no
suspicion of either Shillington or us, and so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But Larose had suspicions," interrupted Edgehill, "or what
made him come spying here?"</p>

<p>"But we can wipe Larose out now," replied Sarle irritably, "if
he's dead as you say, and bother ourselves about him no longer.
Whatever suspicions he had, died with him, and what I'm trying to
weigh up now is, how shall we stand at nine o'clock this morning
when Scotland Yard learns that Larose has disappeared. How shall
we be affected?"</p>

<p>"They'll be down within two hours," said Colonel Jasper
calmly. "They won't lose a minute, for they'll know perfectly
well what the disappearance means." He spoke with no trace of
emotion. "They'll know he's dead."</p>

<p>"So I think," said Sarle gloomily, "although they won't dare
to say so. Until they find out something more, they won't show
down a card."</p>

<p>"Then they'll cross-examine Shillington," went on the colonel
as if Sarle had not spoken, "pretty severely, and then they'll
come over to us. Ostensibly their visit will be quite friendly
and they'll make out perhaps that they only just want us to
corroborate what Shillington said, but in reality&mdash;their
coming will mean that they intend to find out what sort of people
we are."</p>

<p>"And we shall have to see them," said Sarle, frowning.</p>

<p>"I shall," corrected Colonel Jasper "as the owner of the
place. But you and Edgehill can be away to-morrow. Edgehill's got
to go into Colchester anyhow, and he'd better leave here early
before they arrive. You can go fishing, and Broome&mdash;" he
smiled drily "well, Broome doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"But you're dangerous, too," said Sarle thoughtfully. "They
may remember your name."</p>

<p>"Hardly likely to," replied Colonel Jasper, and then he added
carelessly, "You see, a so-called 'Society Card Scandal' does not
particularly interest the police. It was a private matter
entirely."</p>

<p>"But there were other things, too," frowned Sarle. "You forget
them."</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said the colonel sharply, "but I was never
charged there, and I am not even aware that the police were ever
approached. So that, at any rate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! That's enough, Jasper," broke in Edgehill impatiently.
"You'll bluff them all right if they come, I'm not afraid of
that, but what I don't like is the prospect of the increased
reward that the damned police will be offering now one of their
own number is scragged. They're bound to believe Larose tumbled
up against something, and be certain that these two last deaths
in Essex, and the disappearance of Shillington's damned
candlesticks, are all the work of the Iron Man. So they'll offer
something big now, and I'm not sure we're safe." He looked
significantly at Sarle. "Duke's not our only danger now."</p>

<p>Sarle nodded. "I was coming to that," he said, grimly, "and I
tell you straight, I'm out for a clean sweep." He paused for a
moment. "Isaacstein must go."</p>

<p>"And Tilley and his wife," added Edgehill, with emphasis, "and
that man who did our car."</p>

<p>"And the doctor in Epping who dressed my cuts," went on Sarle
calmly. "He saw the tattoo marks on my wrists, and I've been
uneasy about him ever since."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper gave a low chuckling laugh.</p>

<p>"You devils!" he exclaimed. "But you're losing your heads now,
and wanting to strike everywhere in a panic."</p>

<p>"No, we're not," said Sarle angrily, "but we recognise, as you
apparently don't, that now the danger's real." He raised his hand
in emphasis. "For the first time in all that we have done, to-day
we shall be at grips with the police. We shall be in actual
contact with them, and although they can't realise how near they
are, yet the slightest slip on our part and their eyes will be
opened with a vengeance."</p>

<p>"All right, all right," said the colonel, "have your own way,"
and then he added flippantly. "Let 'em all die, I say."</p>

<p>"I shan't go fishing to-morrow," said Sarle sharply. "I shall
go up and deal with the Jew myself." He turned frowningly to
Edgehill. "What have you done with my sharpening hone?"</p>

<p>"It's back in your drawer," replied Edgehill, "and I put it
there, days ago."</p>

<p>"But the best fence in London," exclaimed the colonel, lifting
his hands, "and we've always found him so reliable."</p>

<p>"He'll sell us though," said Sarle, gritting his teeth, "if he
gets the chance, and the price is good enough. I'm sure of it,
and an instinct tells me, too, that he knows more about us than
we think." He scowled, "Yes, he was curious about me last time I
went to him. Too curious for my liking, in several ways, and he
turned his eyes down when he asked me if I lived by the sea. I'd
got my old fishing jacket on. Also, as I've told you before, I'm
not certain I didn't hear a camera click somewhere when I was in
his room. He'd have got my finger prints too, if I hadn't wiped
round the glass I'd been drinking from. He was annoyed and showed
it. Yes, he must go."</p>

<p>"But you'll be running a damned risk," said Colonel Jasper
warningly. "His line of business will keep him always on his
guard."</p>

<p>"But he won't be on his guard with me," said Sarle sharply and
then he laughed a mocking laugh. "I'll take twelve drops of
belladonna, and he'll think I'm doped. That's why I won't shoot.
His room looks almost sound proof, but I can't use a gun with
eyes dilated like an owl's."</p>

<p>"And about the others?" asked Edgehill.</p>

<p>Sarle thought for a moment. "I'd best see Bull," he said
slowly. "He'll do anything if we pay heavily enough and he's as
deep in it as any of us already, so there'll be no worry there."
He clenched his fist viciously. "I tell you no risk is too great
to take now to make sure that there are no traces they can
follow. We are safe and undisturbed to-day, but it's in my mind
that within forty-eight hours, this island may be like a
beleaguered city and not even a bird will fly over it then
without being marked." He sighed gloomily. "I hope I'm
wrong."</p>

<p>They talked on for a few minutes and then Sarle rose to his
feet and announced that he was going to bed.</p>

<p>"We can have about three hours' sleep," he said, turning to
Edgehill. "I'll set the alarm for seven and we must be off by
eight, and remember, you've got to take down that carburetter,
first."</p>

<p>Edgehill rose to accompany him, but Colonel Jasper pulled his
chair up closer to the fire and settled himself down again.</p>

<p>"I shall stay here a little while," he said, "and get warm. I
was chilled to the bone. I think I've taken cold. I'll put the
light out. I feel damned bad."</p>

<p>"Oh! and one thing more," said Sarle turning back suddenly.
"We must lock that damned door in future, every night," and to
the mortification of Larose, the big key was turned noisily in
the lock.</p>

<p>"Lord!" whispered the detective breathlessly, "what devils and
what a den of crime!" He clicked his tongue very softly. "But
what a catch for the Yard if we can only draw the net in!" He
shivered. "But this means I must go out into the cold again, and
not a wink more sleep. I, too, must alter all my plans. I must
get away at once and 'phone up the Yard within an hour. Sarle and
Edgehill must both be shadowed and there'll be plenty of time to
arrange everything if I'm quick." He frowned in perplexity. "But
how am I going to get out? I can't use the door for the noise of
that key turning would wake the dead. No, no, my only chance now
is a window in one of those back rooms, but it'll be a deadly
business working without a light." He peered scowlingly round the
edge of the sofa. "Now, when the devil is that Jasper going to
bed?"</p>

<p>But the Colonel showed no signs at all of going to bed. He was
lying back, huddled up in the big armchair, and was staring
thoughtfully into the fire. There was quite a gentle expression
upon his face, the detective thought, but he looked ill and every
now and then he wrinkled up his forehead and pressed his hand
upon his chest as if he were in pain.</p>

<p>The minutes crept by&mdash;five, ten, a quarter of an hour,
but the colonel sat on. Half an hour passed and then he got up,
but to the mortification of Larose, it was only to replenish the
fire.</p>

<p>"Damn," swore the detective softly as he looked at the clock.
"It's twenty minutes to five, and it'll be light before half-past. Why doesn't he go off to bed?"</p>

<p>But the strange vigil went on. The watcher by the fire and the
watcher in the shadows of the room.</p>

<p>Sarle and Edgehill slept peacefully in their comfortable beds.
They had no thoughts of the peril that lurked within a few yards
of them, no dreams probably of prison nor of the condemned cell,
and no knowledge, surely, that their guardian angel was just a
tired consumptive man who could not sleep because of the pains
stabbing through his chest.</p>

<p>And so the night passed. The darkness waned and slowly light
began to struggle through the chinks above the curtain.</p>

<p>Larose chafed like a wild animal caught in a trap. In his
life's work he was always prepared to take all reasonable risks
and the imminence of danger never cowed him, but he was not
reckless, and he realised most painfully now, that any movement
in the present circumstances meant disaster both for himself and
all his plans.</p>

<p>And so he lay still and watched the grey dawn filter into the
room.</p>

<p>Just before six the curtain by the passage was pulled aside
and the old woman came in. She replenished the fire and in a
prefunctory manner tidied the room and then proceeded to lay the
table for a meal.</p>

<p>Larose thought that at last the colonel was asleep, but he saw
him stretch presently for the brandy and then, after a drink,
relapse into stillness again.</p>

<p>Shortly after seven, Sarle and Edgehill came in, and with a
grunted good morning, the colonel got up and left the room.</p>

<p>The old woman brought in the breakfast.</p>

<p>"None too good, poor old Jasper, this morning," commented
Edgehill, sitting down. "He looks very crook. That Burgundy of
Shillington's was all right when you were drinking it, but it
makes one feel damned seedy now." He pressed his hand feelingly
to his forehead. "And Broome's gone quite dotty this morning. I
went into his room for a boot-lace just now and he cursed like
hell, and told me to go and get his trousers pressed." Edgehill
grinned. "He thought he was back in the asylum again."</p>

<p>Sarle smiled carelessly. "Sometimes, I think," he said slowly,
"that Shillington ought not ever to have let him come out. He's
never quite normal, and the cold last night has probably upset
him."</p>

<p>The detective behind the sofa pricked up his ears and could
not resist looking furtively round the sofa, and in a way he was
rewarded for his daring.</p>

<p>Both Sarle and Edgehill now looked very different from the men
he had waited upon the previous evening. They were roughly
dressed in poor quality working clothes. Sarle had a smutted
face, and looked like a motor mechanic, and Edgehill would have
passed anywhere for a casual laborer or as a porter in one of the
markets. There was nothing conspicuous about either of them, and
there would have been nothing to pick them out by in a crowd.</p>

<p>Larose frowned disapprovingly. "Very difficult to describe,"
he muttered. "One might pass them a hundred times without
noticing them."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper came in as they were finishing their meal. He
had washed and shaved, and looked more like his usual self,
except that his eyes were heavy and there were dark rings under
them.</p>

<p>"Broome's a bit off his nut this morning," he remarked
carelessly. "He's complaining no one's pressed his trousers
yet."</p>

<p>"Edgehill's just said he's queer," replied Sarle, frowning,
"and it's worrying it should happen at this time." He eyed the
colonel intently. "Do you think it will be safe for those men to
see him if they come to-day?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," laughed the Colonel, "in fact, it will be better
if anything. He'll be as close as an oyster with all strangers,
and devilish haughty if they speak to him."</p>

<p>The object of their remarks came in at that moment. He favored
them with a cold stare, and then demanded truculently why his
breakfast wasn't ready.</p>

<p>"Sorry, my lord," said Edgehill grinning, "but the menials of
the palace are at present otherwise engaged. Old Mother
Heggarty's gone out to feed the chickens, and your majesty will
have to wait."</p>

<p>"Come across and help us with the carburetter, Broome," said
Sarle, evidently with the intention of mollifying the aggrieved
engineer. "You understand it better than we do," and he made a
motion with his head to Colonel Jasper to follow. "Better not
anger him," he whispered to the latter. "We can't afford to give
away any chances to-day."</p>

<p>A minute later and they all went out. Larose sprang instantly
from his hiding place, and, rolling all his things into a bundle,
tucked them under his arm.</p>

<p>"The back door will be all right," he whispered, "and with the
old woman feeding the chickens, I shall be able to climb up to
that window without being seen. I'll go up there and think what I
must do next, it's not safe for me down here."</p>

<p>He paused for a minute by the table and helped himself to a
long drink of milk.</p>

<p>"Plenty here," he remarked, "and they wont miss it. I'll take
something to eat as well," and he cut off a chunk of bread and
two slices of ham. Then with a bottle of beer which he snatched
hurriedly from a case as he was passing through the kitchen, he
ran outside.</p>

<p>As he had anticipated, he had no difficulty in climbing up the
window, and he soon prized up the board again. He thrust his
bundle in underneath, and then proceeded to squeeze in himself.
He was almost inside when suddenly the board swung in towards the
window sill and jammed his foot. He fell forward into the room,
and all the weight of his body was thrown upon the imprisoned
ankle. The pain was excruciating, and a faint cry escaped him.
For the moment he could not free himself, but then, with a great
effort, he regained the window sill and pushed the board back. He
drew in his leg and then almost fainting, dropped down on to the
floor. He was down and out for the time.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE SILENCE OF THE DEAD.</h2>

<p class="first">AT exactly twelve minutes past nine that same
morning Elias Carter, in his room in Scotland Yard, received a
communication over the 'phone, and, hardened campaigner though he
was, his face paled. His voice was quite steady, however, and he
snapped out instantly&mdash;</p>

<p>"His exact words. Give me his exact words, please. Well, give
me them as near as you can. One moment, please, and I'll write
them down. Now&mdash;&mdash;" and he wrote slowly "That man Mason
you sent me has behaved abominably. He has left here without a
word of apology or explanation. After a dinner party I gave last
night I found he had been drinking heavily, and when I
remonstrated with him he was insolent. This morning it was found
out that he had taken himself off bag and baggage during the
night. He used disgusting language."</p>

<p>Carter lifted his pencil. "And you received this message three
minutes ago? Ah! he seemed very angry. Of course, of course, he
would. What do I think?" the detective's voice hardened grimly,
"I think Larose is dead."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, and then Carter went on quickly.
"Well, thank you, Major Channing, I am much obliged to you. You
shall hear from us again. We may come round shortly," and he hung
up the receiver with a jerk.</p>

<p>A minute later and he burst into Stone's room. The big man was
reading a newspaper, and the frown which he had assumed upon the
unceremonious breaking in upon his privacy changed instantly to
an indulgent smile when he perceived who was interrupting
him.</p>

<p>"You're in a deuce of a hurry, Eli," he said. "What's up?"</p>

<p>Carter made no attempt now to steady his voice, and gasped
out, "They've got him, Charlie, they've got Gilbert Larose.
Shillington's phoned that he's disappeared."</p>

<p>"What!" ejaculated Stone, and his face paled, even as Carter's
had done, "What's happened to him?"</p>

<p>Carter steadied himself with an effort. "Major Channing's just
had a 'phone from Shillington, and this is what he said. They are
the exact words, as near as possible," and he thrust over the
notes that he had jotted down.</p>

<p>The face of Stone was a perfect study of self-control. Cold,
calm and emotionless he seemed quite unperturbed, and yet a close
observer would have noticed that the hand that held the paper was
trembling.</p>

<p>"Good," he said after a moment, and his voice was strained and
husky. "We'll go down at once." He looked intently at his
companion. "We'll take a search warrant, of course."</p>

<p>He glanced again at the paper in his hand and sighed. "It
means, Eli, that in all human probability now we shall hear no
more of Larose. If Shillington had simply said that he had
disappeared then we might have hoped, but with the information
tacked on that Larose was drunk, we know that Shillington is
lying, and if he considers it necessary to lie, then he is
endeavoring to cover over something he has done with that lie,
and that something can only be that he is responsible himself for
the disappearance."</p>

<p>He snapped his jaws together, and there was suppressed fury in
his tones. "Damn him. He's done in Larose in some way, and it's
all over and finished."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll take Tony and Williams," said Carter viciously,
"and get away at once."</p>

<p>"Tony and Williams!" echoed Stone, and his eyes blazed like
red hot coals. "We'll take a dozen men, the big car full of them,
and we'll search every hole and cranny of that vile place.
We'll&mdash;&mdash;" and then suddenly he paused, the fury died
from his face, and he put his finger to his lips. "Hush! Wait a
moment, wait." He glanced round as if to make sure that they were
quite alone, and lowered his voice to a whisper. "What was it the
boy told you? He was flying at something higher than Shillington,
he said. He had discovered more, than only about him." The big
man glared into his companion's face. "You remember, Eli?"</p>

<p>Carter's voice shook. "Yes," he nodded slowly. "He said that
Shillington was only a pawn in the game."</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Stone fiercely, "we're not going to let his
work die, are we? We're not going after the carrion crow when the
vultures are about? No, no, Eli, we are going to pick up that
trail that he found, and we are going to follow until it leads us
to where his genius would have led him." He gripped his companion
by the arm. "Why man, we have grown old together in the ways of
crime, we are old dogs for the trail, you and I, and we are not
surely going to be false to the memory of that boy by stopping
when we know he would have gone on."</p>

<p>"And you mean?" asked Carter frowning, "that we are going to
get at the greater criminal unknown, through the lesser criminal,
known, Shillington?" He turned up his eyes piously. "And the Lord
help us to find a criminal greater than Shillington."</p>

<p>"But we'll go after the men of that dinner party," went on
Stone quickly. "Shillington's friends. That's where we must start
now." He thought for a moment. "And it won't be much good
searching Shillington's house, for if their suspicions have been
aroused we can bet our lives there'll be no evidence there now."
His voiced choked a little. "And we shan't find the body
anywhere, either. Those black marshes would have been the devil's
own pit for a hurried burial of the dead. But let's go off
quickly now, and we'll talk over things going down, and on second
thoughts I suggest we only take one man beside the driver. We
shan't be making any arrests this journey."</p>

<p>"All right," said Carter, "but I think, anyhow, I'll telephone
Shillington that we're coming down. He's sure to be expecting it,
and it can't do any harm. I'll say we'll arrive about one,
but&mdash;&mdash;" he looked at his watch, "we'll get there by
eleven, and hope perhaps he may be in the asylum doing his
rounds. Then we'll have a talk with the maids, first."</p>

<p>It was an almost silent drive down to Oakley Court. The two
detectives were full of their own thoughts, and both seemed
disinclined to talk.</p>

<p>The big car wound swiftly through the traffic, and once in the
open country, roared like a thing possessed. Thirty, forty,
fifty, and with the hood down, the keen air stung like a thousand
flicking whips. Only once in the first hour was a word spoken,
and then, just before they were approaching Chelmsford.</p>

<p>"I feel psychic, Eli," Stone shouted in Carter's ear. "I feel
we are very near our enemies now."</p>

<p>Carter nodded and smiled. He was watching a car that was
approaching them at a great pace. It flashed by like a bullet
from a gun. It was a low, black car, and the hood and side
curtains were up, but he had time to see that there was only one
man in it.</p>

<p>Sarle was in a hurry. He had had trouble with the carburetter
again, and reckoned he was nearly an hour late.</p>

<p>Just after 11 the police car pulled up before the big iron
gates of Oakley Court.</p>

<p>"We won't take the car in, Jarvis," Carter said to the driver.
"Pull back and wait under those trees. I have no idea how long we
shall be," and he rang the bell.</p>

<p>The gatekeeper came out at once from the lodge, and admitted
the two detectives and their assistant.</p>

<p>"You remember us!" smiled Carter. "We are from Scotland
Yard."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," smiled back the man, and he proceeded to
close and lock the gates behind them.</p>

<p>"Now, what's this about the butler going off?" asked Carter,
frowning. "We want a word with you."</p>

<p>"One moment, sir," said the gatekeeper, and he made to move
back into the lodge.</p>

<p>"But where are you going?" asked Carter sharply.</p>

<p>"Only for a moment, sir," replied the man; "I'm just going to
telephone through to the doctor. He is in the asylum, and I had
orders to tell him directly you arrived."</p>

<p>"Oh! never mind about that," said Carter. "We'll go up and see
him ourselves in a couple of minutes."</p>

<p>"But I must obey orders, sir," smiled the man; "I'm an old
soldier."</p>

<p>"Well, don't be an old fool," broke in Stone brusquely. "Here,
have a drink with this," and he passed over a piece of silver.
"If the doctor hears you didn't ring up at once, say we wouldn't
let you." He looked very sternly at him. "We're policemen, you
understand?"</p>

<p>The man made a gesture of reluctance but all the same
proceeded promptly to pocket the money.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Carter sharply, "we've come, as I say, about
the disappearance of this Fred Mason. After the murder of the
other butler it's a very serious matter in our opinion, and you
are all involved." He glared menacingly at the gatekeeper. "What
do you know?"</p>

<p>The man's face paled. "Nothing, sir," he said stoutly. "I've
only seen him about half a dozen times, and we were quite good
friends."</p>

<p>"You didn't let him out during the night?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I didn't leave my bed here between just after ten
last night and nearly seven this morning, and the wife can tell
you so."</p>

<p>"Could he have climbed over the gates without you hearing
him?"</p>

<p>The man hesitated. "Yes, he could. We sleep with our window
open, but if he had been quiet, we shouldn't have heard him."</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear any noises at all then during the night?"
asked Carter.</p>

<p>"Only when a car went out with some visitors who had been
spending the evening up at the house, just before half-past one,"
replied the man.</p>

<p>"Who opened the gates for them then?"</p>

<p>The gate-keeper shrugged his shoulders. "Dr. Shillington, I
suppose." He paused a moment. "Yes, of course, it was the doctor,
for I heard him afterwards going back up the drive. I know his
step."</p>

<p>Carter frowned. "And this dinner party," he asked, "did you
let them in last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, just before half-past eight."</p>

<p>"And who were they?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"The doctor's friends from the Priory, over on the island."
replied the man, "Colonel Jasper, Mr. Sarle, Mr. Edgehill and Mr.
Broome."</p>

<p>"What are their occupations?" asked Carter. "What do they
do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied the gate-keeper, "they are all private
gentlemen and don't work at all. They shoot and fish. They're
very great on fishing, and go out in their launch for days
together at a time sometimes." He hesitated a moment. "Colonel
Jasper's not very strong. He's got consumption, people say."</p>

<p>"Do they come here often then, these chaps?" asked Carter.</p>

<p>The man shook his head. "No, only Colonel Jasper," he replied.
"I've never seen the others, except when they've come up to spend
an evening here." He nodded his head. "They're very rich, I
believe."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. "And that's all you can tell
us then?" said Carter.</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>"Very well," went on the detective, "and now we'll go up to
the house." He took out his watch, "You'll give us twenty
minutes, my friend, and then you can ring up the doctor." The man
grinned. "In the meantime we'll leave this gentleman, our
assistant, here&mdash;" the man's face fell, "to ensure that you
keep to the contract."</p>

<p>Three minutes later and the two detectives were standing in
the hall of Dr. Shillington's private house and interviewing the
smart parlor-maid, Smithers.</p>

<p>"Yes, young lady," said Carter smiling genially, "we know
quite well that the doctor is out, but it's you and the other
girls we want to see first, and we'll go into the kitchen I
think, so that we can talk to you all together." The girl
hesitated, and he went on sternly. "The matter we want to speak
to you about is a very, very grave one, and we mustn't waste a
minute. We're afraid there's been another death here."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes opened very wide, and her face went white as a
sheet, but without a word she led the way into the kitchen. The
two other girls were sitting there with cups of tea before them,
but they rose up at once when they saw whom their visitors
were.</p>

<p>Carter put on his best smile again. "Very sorry to disturb
you," he said, "but as I've just told Miss Smithers, the matter
is very urgent." The smile died from his face. "We think
something dreadful has happened to poor Mr. Mason."</p>

<p>The cook gasped and looked terrified, and the housemaid sank
back into her chair as if she were going to faint.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Carter, "we're police officers, as you know,
and following so quickly upon what happened to Mr.
Jakes&mdash;&mdash;" his voice was grave and solemn, "we are very
worried about what may have come now to Mr. Mason."</p>

<p>"But why did he go away?" asked the cook tremblingly. "Why did
he leave here at all, like this?"</p>

<p>"That's what we want to find out," snapped the detective, and
all his genial manner had disappeared, "and I'm going to ask you
some questions about it. Please answer quickly." He looked round
at the three maids. "Now when was it that you first learned he
had disappeared?"</p>

<p>The parlor-maid took it upon herself to be spokeswoman. "At
half-past eight this morning," she said. "He hadn't come down to
breakfast, and we thought he had overslept himself. I knocked
several times on the door, and then opened it. I saw the room was
empty and the bed hadn't been slept in and that all his clothes
were gone."</p>

<p>"Was the room disarranged?" asked Carter sharply.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, "you can see it for yourself. Nothing's
been touched."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked the detective, "what happened next?"</p>

<p>"I came down and told cook, and then went into the master. He
was having his breakfast."</p>

<p>"And what did he do?"</p>

<p>Smithers gave a nervous laugh. "He just glared at me, and then
swore. He said 'damn,' and then he was going on with his
breakfast, when he asked me if any of the silver or anything was
missing?"</p>

<p>"And was it?" asked Carter sharply.</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "No, everything was quite all right."
She paused a moment. "But I found later, that four of the table
napkins had gone."</p>

<p>"Table napkins?" echoed Carter, frowningly. "What table
napkins?"</p>

<p>"The ones that the gentlemen had used," replied the girl. "The
ones that they had at dinner last night."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the detective, and he looked thoughtfully upon
the ground. A short silence followed, and then he went on
quickly. "And did you tell the doctor that?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "I only found it out a short time
ago."</p>

<p>"Well," went on Carter, "and who amongst you was the last one
to see Mr. Mason last night?"</p>

<p>"We all saw him together," was the reply. "We said 'good-night' to him just after 11, and went off to bed."</p>

<p>"And was he quite sober when you left him?" was the next
question. "Was he in any way under the influence of drink?"</p>

<p>The three girls gasped.</p>

<p>"Sober!" exclaimed the cook indignantly, "of course he was."
She glared angrily at the detective. "Mr. Mason was always a most
proper man. A real gentleman he was."</p>

<p>"So I have always heard," exclaimed Carter warmly, assuming
indignation too, "but Dr. Shillington told the Registry Office
people over the 'phone this morning that Mr. Mason got drunk last
night, and used disgusting language to him as well."</p>

<p>The cook went scarlet in her anger. "It isn't true, Mr.
Detective, whoever said it. It's quite impossible." She laughed
scornfully. "Why, it's far more likely that the master himself
had taken too much. You should see the empty bottles that Miss
Smithers put in the scullery this morning."</p>

<p>Carter grinned covertly to himself. He was quite sure that all
the maids would be on his side now.</p>

<p>"Well, when you came down here into the kitchen this morning,"
he went on, "you found no evidence of any drinking at all?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied the cook. "There was no glass or
bottle about. Mr. Mason had evidently been intending to make
himself a cup of tea, for he had got a cup and saucer, and the
milk and sugar and everything ready on the table." She looked a
little bit embarrassed. "And he had put the small tin kettle on
the fire." A choke came into her voice. "Poor man, something made
him forget it, and the kettle boiled dry. It was still on the
fire this morning, and it's quite ruined."</p>

<p>"Ah!" came again from the detective, and there was a long
silence now. Presently he said, very slowly&mdash;"So, it would
seem he was called away suddenly, and&mdash;&mdash;" he paused
dramatically&mdash;"he never came back."</p>

<p>The cook began to cry softly.</p>

<p>"But, come now," said the detective sharply, and he tactfully
addressed himself to the parlor-maid&mdash;"Did any of you hear
any noise in the night, any sound of voices or of people
quarrelling?"</p>

<p>The girls looked round at one another, and then all shook
their heads.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I didn't," said the parlor-maid. "I know I was dead
tired, and dropped off the moment I touched the pillow; besides,
our rooms are a long way from the rest of the house, and anyone
would have to shout for us to hear."</p>

<p>Stone spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>"Now, I want to ask you all something," he said. He beamed on
them with his big, kindly smile. "You see, you've had Mr. Mason
with you here for nine days, and we can be quite sure from what
you've been telling us that you've summed up his character and
habits pretty accurately. Well&mdash;&mdash;" and the big man
became very serious&mdash;"now what would you say had interested
him most since he came down here? I mean, of course, what seemed
to him to be most interesting among the persons and things that
he would be hearing about or seeing in this place? What did he
talk to you about, what was he most curious of and about what did
he ask the most questions? Come, come," he smiled, as none of the
girls seemed ready to answer him, "I'm sure you can tell me, if
you only think."</p>

<p>A moment of silence followed, and then the young housemaid
said shyly, "Well, I remember one thing, Sir. He often asked us
about the house on the island here. He seemed very interested
about that."</p>

<p>"So he was," exclaimed the cook quickly. "Of course, I
remember now, and he used to ask us a lot about Colonel Jasper
and the other gentlemen who lived there, too. And he went over on
to the island himself one afternoon. Now let me think when it
was." Her voice quavered a little. "Why it was only three days
ago. Not yesterday, but the day before that. He came home with
his boots so muddy and he took them off in the scullery." Tears
came into her eyes. "He was always such a considerate man and so
thoughtful."</p>

<p>The parlor-maid smiled. "Yes, he told us he had been on the
island, but we would have known it, if he hadn't said a word. You
can always recognise the black marsh mud."</p>

<p>"And he was always so sympathetic, too," added the cook
tearfully. "He used to ask a lot about Colonel Jasper and his
consumption."</p>

<p>"So he was really interested in these people?" asked Stone.
"He often talked about them to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the parlor-maid, "when I think about it now, I
can see he was. He was interested in them I suppose because we
had told him they were the master's greatest friends."</p>

<p>"Well, well," again said Carter after a long moment, "and how
did you find the dining-room this morning, Miss Smithers? Was
anything in it disarranged?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the girl hesitatingly, "except that a decanter
had been knocked on to the floor and broken and some wine
spilt."</p>

<p>The detective looked at his watch and then immediately walked
to the kitchen door.</p>

<p>"If you please, Miss Smithers," he said, "you can take us to
the dining-room now. We only gave ourselves twenty minutes, and a
quarter of an hour has already gone." He smiled grimly. "Dr.
Shillington will be here like a raging lion almost any moment
now, and we want to see things for ourselves before he comes." He
turned back to the other two girls. "And if you don't mind, young
ladies, keep as much as you can of our little talk to yourselves,
will you? It will help us such a lot if you do, for we want to
find this poor Mr. Mason, or if we can't find him&mdash;" his
voice hardened sternly, "we want to punish those who are
responsible for his death."</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Smithers," he said, when half a minute later they
were in the dining-room, "I see everything's been nicely tidied
here, but I want you to tell me exactly where things were when
you came in this morning. What was on the table, where the chairs
were, and all about that broken decanter? And be very quick,
please. But, first of all, tell me what these gentlemen who had
dinner here last night are like." He smiled all over his face. "I
always trust a woman's intuition you see, especially if that
woman happens, as in the present instance, to be a most
intelligent one."</p>

<p>The girl blushed and looked very pleased with the compliment.
"But what do you want to know, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, what's your impression of Colonel Jasper, to begin
with?" he asked. "Give me all your ideas? I'm sure they'll be
worth listening to."</p>

<p>She hesitated just a moment. "Well, sir, he seems to me to be
a very kind sort of man and quite a gentleman, but I don't think
you'd call him a good man. He's a real soldier and very brave and
all that, but still&mdash;&mdash;" she shook her head, "he's not
a good man, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"And this Mr. Sarle, what about him?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand him at all. I think he's been a sailor,
for I saw a tattoo mark once just above his wrist. He's very
clever, but he's got a cruel face and would be very unkind, I am
sure, if you offended him. Somehow, I think the others always do
what he tells them, even Mr. Edgehill." She made a little
grimace, "I don't like Mr. Edgehill at all, although he's a
gentleman, too, like Colonel Jasper. He was at Cambridge
University, I heard him say once, and had played cricket for them
there. But he would do anything wicked, I think, and he's cruel,
too. He killed their pig the other day, on the island, when the
butcher was ill and couldn't come."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Broome?" asked the detective, smiling, amused at her
descriptions.</p>

<p>"Oh! he's like a schoolmaster, and half the time doesn't seem
to be listening to what the others say." She lowered her voice.
"I believe he was a mental case once, but he wasn't at this
asylum."</p>

<p>Five minutes later and the two detectives were seated in the
morning room, awaiting the coming of Dr. Shillington.</p>

<p>"A clear case, Charlie," whispered Carter, "but how the devil
can we bring it home to them? We've no direct proof anywhere
unless we start off with the supposition that they're guilty and
work backwards. Then everything we touch, strengthens our hands.
Shillington's lie about him being drunk, that boiled-out kettle,
that decanter knocked over in some struggle, and then those four
table napkins, used to gag and bind him whilst they took him
away."</p>

<p>"But he's not a prisoner anywhere, Eli," said Stone gloomily.
"They're not that kind of men. They took him and finished him off
away from here. There would be no reason at all for their keeping
him either, and from what we know of Shillington ourselves, and
from the simple descriptions that girl just gave us of the
others, we can guess they're all killers." He leant forward and
placed his hand upon his companion's arm. "But you've no doubt,
Eli, have you?" His eyes blazed. "We're at grips at last with the
Iron Man. This sinister part of Essex&mdash;this house upon that
lonely island&mdash;the sea and river for those untracked paths
to crime&mdash;this little gang of men&mdash;Sarle with his
tattoo marks, the sailor man&mdash;&mdash;" the big detective
rose up in his excitement. "By Gad, the boy was right every time.
He told us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush," interrupted Carter, "Shillington's here. He's
talking to the girl in the hall."</p>

<p>"Well, pitch it into him hot, Eli," whispered Stone. "Make him
believe it's only him we suspect, and then he won't be worrying
about the others."</p>

<p>The door was flung open, and the doctor burst in. He glared at
the two detectives with the animosity of a wild animal about to
charge, and made no pretence at any preliminary politeness.
Neither did they.</p>

<p>"So you're here again," he blustered, and his small eyes
blinked viciously. He looked round the room and sneered. "But
only two of you this time."</p>

<p>"Yes, we're here again," said Carter calmly, "and I warn you
at once that our mission is a very serious one this time."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" the doctor remarked sarcastically. "It is, is
it?"</p>

<p>"It is," went on Carter, "for I tell you frankly that we view
with very grave suspicion the disappearance of this man, Mason."
His voice vibrated a little. "We are not satisfied with the
information you are furnishing to the Service Bureau."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sneered the doctor again, and he looked at his watch as
if he were in a hurry, "then let me tell you it does not interest
me one little bit whether you are satisfied or not."</p>

<p>"But it will interest you, Dr. Shillington," continued Carter
coldly, "when I suggest to you that we may be in possession of
certain information that will justify us in applying forthwith
for a warrant for your arrest."</p>

<p>"Arrest!" gasped the doctor in amazement, and all in a second
his face paled to a sickly hue. "Arrest! What the hell for?"</p>

<p>"We are not quite children up at the Yard," replied Carter
quietly, "and you don't surely think that our enquiries with
regard to the murder of Edmund Jakes stopped with our last visit
here." His face was very stern. "We were not satisfied with what
you told us then, and now, with this second trouble here, our
doubts have become intensified at once." He spoke with the utmost
sternness. "We are suspicious about you, sir."</p>

<p>"Suspicious!" bellowed the doctor, with his face twitching
violently. "Confound you, what do you mean? Suspicious about
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Carter firmly, "and we may have some awkward
questions to ask you when the adjourned inquest is resumed."</p>

<p>It seemed that the doctor could hardly get his breath.</p>

<p>"But, you damned fools," he panted, "what interest should I
have in my butler's death, and what the hell is it to do with me
that the other man took himself off? Damn you, I say."</p>

<p>"Dr. Shillington," said Carter quietly, "in our time we have
been often sworn at by men such as you, and yet," he shrugged his
shoulders, "we have lived later to see these same men having
their last talk with the chaplain just before eight o'clock." His
voice was cold and contemptuous. "So abuse does not affect us in
any way."</p>

<p>"Who said it did?" replied the doctor truculently, and now
beginning to recover himself. "Men of your trade can have no
finer feelings at all." He calmed down all at once and reverted
to his former sneering tone. "I swore for my own satisfaction,
not for yours. Damn you, I say again."</p>

<p>"Well, now, perhaps," said Carter grimly, "you'll please
answer some questions we're going to ask you or
else&mdash;&mdash;" His voice hardened. "I tell you frankly we
shall go straight into Colchester and discuss with the Chief
Constable there, the advisability of effecting your immediate
arrest."</p>

<p>The doctor took out a cigarette&mdash;he was now apparently
quite at his ease. "You don't frighten me in the least," he
smiled scornfully. "On the strength of some tittle-tattle you may
have heard, there's no magistrate in the kingdom who would dare
sign a warrant for my arrest." His anger began to rise again.
"Why, man, do you know I'm a justice of the peace myself, besides
being,"&mdash;he dropped his voice to staid professional
tones&mdash;"an educated man and a man of the world as well?"</p>

<p>Carter frowned in annoyance. The doctor was calling his bluff,
and he realised instantly that it would be unwise to continue in
that direction any further. He spoke very quietly.</p>

<p>"And that being so, doctor," he said, "as an educated man and
a man of the world, you will, of course, see the desirability of
assisting the preservers of law and order in every possible way.
I repeat, after what happened to your butler, Jakes, the
disappearance of your butler Mason suggests to us foul play as
well."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington looked bored. "And how then can I help you?"
he asked condescendingly.</p>

<p>"You said he was drunk," said Carter frowning.</p>

<p>"Not at all," snapped the doctor quickly. "Under the influence
of liquor, was the expression I used, he was not drunk, he was
only fresh."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then carter asked, "And
what had he been drinking then?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" ejaculated the doctor, as if astounded at the
question. "And how on earth should I know?" He sneered
derisively. "Surely you don't imagine that I am cognisant of all
my servants' taste in liquors, do you?"</p>

<p>"Well, what time was this," asked the detective, "when you
found he was what you called 'fresh?'"</p>

<p>The doctor appeared to consider. "Some time after midnight, I
should say," he replied. "I had been giving a dinner party, as,
of course, the service people told you, and I rang for Mason to
show my guests out. But he didn't answer the bell, and, going
into the servants' quarters later, I found him in the condition I
have mentioned. He was abusive to me."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"Then," replied the doctor, "I left him."</p>

<p>"And that's all you can tell us?" said Carter.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the doctor. "I never saw him again."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then Carter
asked&mdash;"And had any of your guests noticed his condition
then?"</p>

<p>"How do I know?" snapped the doctor sharply. "Guests don't
usually make remarks about the servants to their hosts, do they?"
He sneered. "They don't in the circles in which I move,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"And who were those guests, Dr. Shillington?" he asked
quietly.</p>

<p>The doctor instantly bridled up again. "What's that to do with
you?" he asked angrily. "You don't think they took the man away
in their pockets, do you?"</p>

<p>"But we shall have to see them," said the detective firmly.
"As police officers we shall have speech with everybody who was
brought in contact with him before he disappeared." He took out a
pencil and a small memorandum book from his pocket. "Now, who
were they, please?"</p>

<p>The doctor sighed in resignation. "Friends of mine," he said
wearily, "from the Priory across on the island, here. Colonel
Jasper, Mr. Sarle, Mr. Edgehill, and a Mr. Broome."</p>

<p>"And their occupations?" asked Carter, making some notes.</p>

<p>"Colonel Jasper, retired army man, but I should hardly say it
was the Salvation Army one; Messrs. Sarle and Edgehill do
nothing, and Mr. Broome, engineer&mdash;generally a very uncivil
one."</p>

<p>Stone suppressed a grin, but there was no humor on Carter's
face.</p>

<p>"And one thing more?" he asked. "Did you find the man a good
servant?"</p>

<p>"Quite good," replied the doctor instantly, "and until last
night I could not have wished for a better one." His old sneering
tone returned. "And now my final remark is&mdash;" he held open
the door for the detectives to go out. "I consider it perfectly
ridiculous that you should have bounced down here just because an
angry fuddled butler upon being reprimanded took himself off in a
huff." He laughed scornfully. "Why, the man is probably back in
his own home by now."</p>

<p>The detectives made no comment, but nodding curtly to him,
passed out through the hall and left the house.</p>

<p>"He recognised Larose," sighed Stone when they were some way
down the drive. "They knew he was Larose. I'm quite sure of it."
He swore softly to himself. "Did you notice the brute could not
keep the triumph out of his voice when he said there were only
two of us here to-day, instead of three. He was absolutely
gloating."</p>

<p>"Yes," scowled Carter, "and the elaborate way in which he
pretended to look round gave him away as well. The instant he
came in, he could have seen we were alone." The lanky detective
nodded his head grimly. "But we can wait, Charlie, can't we.
We've done it many a time before and yet come out on top in the
end."</p>

<p>They picked up their assistant at the car. "Find out
anything," asked Carter laconically.</p>

<p>"Only that we shan't catch all the birds over on the island at
home today," replied the man. "The gatekeeper told me he saw
their car go by about a quarter past eight this morning. The side
curtains were up, but he thought there were two men in it, and he
says from the way it was being driven that the owner wasn't
there. That Colonel Jasper owns it, and he drives very
carefully."</p>

<p>"All right," said Carter, "and you got a description of the
car?"</p>

<p>The man nodded and with no delay they drove off over the
marsh. It was a delightfully sunny day, and the surface of the
road was nearly dry.</p>

<p>Stone looked round and sighed. "What a difference the sun
makes," he exclaimed. "This looks quite a nice spot now, and one
could weave romance about everything instead of brooding over the
secret that these foul marshes probably hold."</p>

<p>They soon reached the bank above the causeway, and the car was
pulled up.</p>

<p>"This is only a shed," the third detective explained, "and the
gatekeeper told me the island people only use it for their car
when the causeway is under water. We can drive across now."</p>

<p>"But I don't think we will," said Carter thoughtfully. "We'll
go the rest of the way on foot. It will give us time to look
about a bit. You cross over with us and then leave us and have a
squiz all round."</p>

<p>The two detectives walked leisurely up to the house. Broome
was lying back in a big deck chair just outside, and was reading
a book. He took no notice, however, of their approach.</p>

<p>"Good day," said Carter, "we want to see Colonel Jasper,
please."</p>

<p>Broome just lifted his eyes for one moment from his book. "Go
round to the back door," he said brusquely, "if you've anything
to sell." He dropped his eyes again. "But we're not requiring any
coal, wood or potatoes, so it's waste of time if you have come
about them."</p>

<p>"Quite a good actor," whispered Stone.</p>

<p>"No," whispered back Carter, "he's the dotty one."</p>

<p>The detective raised his voice. "Can we see Colonel Jasper,
please?"</p>

<p>Broome put down his book and regarded them insolently. "I
suppose you can," he said slowly, "that is, of course, if your
eyesight's all right. As far as I know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A voice came from inside the hall, "Don't be rude, Broome,"
and immediately Colonel Jasper appeared in front of the door.
"What is it you want?" he asked politely of the detectives.</p>

<p>"Colonel Jasper?" asked Carter, and his eyebrows straightened
suddenly into a frown.</p>

<p>"At your service," replied the Colonel, and then he in turn
frowned as he glanced down at the card that the detective
immediately presented.</p>

<p>"From Scotland Yard!" he ejaculated, and then he smiled
whimsically. "What's up?"</p>

<p>"We want a word with you, please," said Carter, "if you can
spare us a minute or two."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the Colonel, "come in, will you," and he
stood aside for them to pass. "Take a seat now, and don't mind
the old woman, she's quite deaf."</p>

<p>Mother Heggarty was busy tidying up the room, but she took no
notice of the detectives and continued on with her work.</p>

<p>"And what can I do for you?" asked Colonel Jasper when they
were seated.</p>

<p>The detectives eyed him very intently.</p>

<p>"We understand," said Carter in staccato policeman-like tones,
"that you and some friends were dining at Oakley-court last
night?"</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper frowned as if he were puzzled. "Yes," he
replied, "all four of us residing in this house were there."</p>

<p>"Well," snapped out the detective, "and did you notice
anything peculiar about the butler there?"</p>

<p>"The butler," ejaculated Colonel Jasper. "How&mdash;peculiar
about him?" and then a startled look came into his face, and he
gasped out. "Good God! but you don't say he's done Shillington
in?"</p>

<p>Carter looked annoyed, the surprise seemed so genuine, and the
startled appearance so real that they in no wise fitted in with
the almost certainty of guilt that they, the detectives, were
entertaining.</p>

<p>"No," replied the detective sharply. "Nothing's happened,
except that the butler has disappeared." He paused for a moment.
"But we regard this disappearance as being so sinister that we
have come down immediately from London to investigate."</p>

<p>The Colonel took out his handkerchief and wiped over his
forehead. "But I don't understand," he said quietly. "What do you
know has happened, and why do you come to me?"</p>

<p>"We know nothing," said Carter quickly, "but following upon
the violent death of Dr. Shillington's former butler, we expect
anything, and&mdash;&mdash;" his frowning eyes were fixed sternly
upon the colonel's face, "we approach you because you and your
friends were the last persons to be in contact with the man
before he disappeared."</p>

<p>"But I know nothing," said Colonel Jasper, looking puzzled.
"He waited upon us at dinner, and that is all either I or my
friends can possibly tell you."</p>

<p>"What time did you leave Oakley-court this morning?" asked the
detective.</p>

<p>"Somewhere about one, I should say," was the reply, "but I'm
not quite certain."</p>

<p>"And the butler waited upon you up to the very last?"</p>

<p>The colonel thought for a moment. "Yes, I should say so," he
replied, "at any rate, as far as I remember." He smiled slyly at
the detective. "You see, we had been spending a very pleasant
evening together, and towards the end&mdash;&mdash;" he looked
rather embarrassed, "I really don't remember what happened." He
sighed and passed his hand up to his forehead. "The doctor had
some perfectly wonderful burgundy up there, but I fancy now it
must have been devilish strong."</p>

<p>"Well," asked Carter sharply, "did you notice anything at all
strange in the butler's manner? Dr. Shillington says the man had
had too much to drink."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed the colonel, smiling in amusement, "and
so had we all. That was what I was trying delicately to explain
to you. Why, Shillington himself was so dopy that he could hardly
get on his hind legs to help us on with our coats. And my friend
Mr. Sarle, who was driving us home, nearly bogged the car by the
shed over there." He laughed in the most friendly manner
possible. "Boys will be boys, you see." His merriment sobered
down instantly, however, and he passed his hand against his
chest. "But by gad, it doesn't suit me. I've got a bad lung
here."</p>

<p>The two detectives looked most sympathetic. "But we should
like to see Mr. Sarle and your other friends," said Carter
politely. "They may have noticed something about the man that you
didn't." He frowned. "You understand, it's just on the cards he
may have committed suicide. Yes, we should like to have a word
with your friends."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper looked amused. "You've already had a word with
one of them," he smiled. "That was Mr. Broome, outside." His
smile broadened to a grin. "He's always like that the morning
after the night when he's been doing himself well."</p>

<p>"But this Mr. Sarle," said Cartel, "and your other
friend?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm very sorry, but they're away to-day, and won't be
back until to-morrow," said the colonel. "They're motoring on a
visit to some friends, but you shall hear what Mr. Broome says at
once."</p>

<p>"Broome, Broome," he called out. "I want you for a minute,"
and after quite an appreciable delay, Broome appeared. He came in
walking very slowly, with one finger between the pages of his
book. He seemed annoyed at being disturbed.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" he asked peevishly. He looked with
suspicion at the detectives. "I don't want to buy anything, I
tell you."</p>

<p>"They're not asking you to," said the colonel frowning.
"They're detectives from Scotland Yard, and want to know about
Dr. Shillington's butler. He's disappeared."</p>

<p>"We want to ask you," said Carter very politely, "if you
noticed anything at all peculiar in the man's demeanor last
night."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," snapped Broome rudely, "and what's more I
never notice servants at any time. They don't interest me," and
he turned on his heel and walked out.</p>

<p>"Sorry," said the colonel apologetically, "but he's often like
that. He's a very temperamental man."</p>

<p>"An engineer, Dr. Shillington told us," said Carter.</p>

<p>"And one of the cleverest," replied the colonel. "If he hadn't
had money left him he'd have made a great name." He rose from his
chair. "But have something to drink, will you? I've got some fine
old whisky here."</p>

<p>Carter hesitated a moment, and then smiled his acquiescence.
The colonel placed a tantalus and a syphon of soda before
them.</p>

<p>"And what do you think of the murder?" he asked carelessly,
when they were sampling the whisky. "Found out anything?"</p>

<p>Carter was non-committal. "We're busy," he said, "but Rome
wasn't built in a day." He smiled. "What do you think of it,
yourself?"</p>

<p>The colonel lit a cigarette before he replied. "I've a
theory," he said slowly, "although it's perhaps hardly fair to
Shillington to mention it. I believe&mdash;&mdash;" he lowered
his voice to a whisper&mdash;"I believe one of his damned
lunatics did it. He's got some awful cases up there."</p>

<p>They chatted for a few minutes and then the detectives rose to
go.</p>

<p>"Well," said Carter, "we shall be down here again, I expect,
and then perhaps we may call in and see your friends."</p>

<p>"Any time," said the colonel heartily. "We're nearly always
about, unless we're out fishing." A note of enthusiasm came into
his voice. "We're great fishermen, all of us here. We've got a
dinghy, a sailing boat and a motor launch and another boat out on
the beach to use when the river here is low."</p>

<p>They went outside and Carter remarked carelessly&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, we'll go for a little walk round your
island. It'll stretch our legs a bit and give us a breath of the
sea air."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the colonel. "Go wherever you like and if
you pass the boathouse, just squint your eye over my little
launch. She's a real beauty in fine weather, but as dirty a
little devil as you could want, when it's rough. We never dare to
take her more than a mile or two from here. She's positively
dangerous in a bad sea."</p>

<p>They shook hands and then the two detectives walked over
towards the sea.</p>

<p>"Well, Eli," said Stone when they were well away from the
house, "and what do you think of it now?"</p>

<p>"I know the man," said Carter grimly. "I recognised him
instantly. He's a cousin of Lord Wain, and he's that Colonel Alan
Jasper who was mixed up in the Hatherleigh card scandal, about
four years ago. Don't you remember he had to resign his
commission in the army and there were all sorts of rumours about
other things he'd done."</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Stone. "Of course, of course. I can place him
now. Why, he was said to be a blackmailer and there was an ugly
tale about him and the suicide of Lady Tudor Wills."</p>

<p>"That's the man, Charlie," said Carter, "and how right that
parlor-maid girl was. A real aristocrat and a fine
soldier&mdash;he ought to have received the V.C. many times over,
so people said, in one of those Indian border wars&mdash;and yet
what a blackguard he is at the same time!"</p>

<p>"But let's sit down in a minute or so," said Stone, frowning,
"when we get to a quiet spot. I want to take this all in and sum
up exactly what it all means."</p>

<p>They found a suitable place just near the sea-shore and
throwing themselves down, for a long time then there was silence
between them.</p>

<p>"It's a hard case, Eli," said Stone presently, with a big
sigh, "and never have I been so certain that we are near our
goal, and yet never so puzzled as to how actually to reach
it."</p>

<p>"Same here, Charlie," said Carter gloomily. "We've all the
good cards in our hands, and yet we daren't put down one."</p>

<p>"The worst of it is," said Stone, "they know we're after them
and they'll make no move now in any direction."</p>

<p>"Except to cover their tracks," added Carter instantly. He
frowned thoughtfully. "And there must be a devil of a lot of
tracks to cover if we only knew." He nodded his head slowly. "You
see, these chaps here won't constitute the whole of the gang. No,
not by a long chalk. They must have confederates and helpers
somewhere, and now they'll all have to be warned. Sarle and
Edgehill probably scuttled off to-day to pass the word along that
we had come into the picture, leaving Jasper here to hold the
fort."</p>

<p>"And he held it damn well," said Stone, with a grim smile,
"although he'd got the wind up at first. I heard a glass clink
inside the house when we were talking to Broome, and man, he just
reeked of brandy when he asked us to go in."</p>

<p>"He was acting all the time," said Carter. "He was much too
familiar with us for a man of his class."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Stone; "and did you notice how he went out of
his way to lie to us when he said they daren't take their launch
far away, and yet the lodge-keeper said they went long voyages
and were away for days together."</p>

<p>Carter sighed. "It's a sure thing, Charlie, but how the deuce
are we going to prove it now? Where are you going to begin?"</p>

<p>There was another long silence, and then he rose briskly to
his feet.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, "we'll set a watch round this place at
once, and chance we may pick up some trail from someone who
visits here. In the meantime, we'll get hold of that man Duke at
once. We must risk everything now, and I shall be very much
astounded if he's not easy to squeeze. But we must get hold of
Stevens first, for there's just a chance he may have found out
something that may strengthen our hands. He's not reported for
two days now."</p>

<p>But it was not destined that they should get hold of Stevens
that day, for proceeding into Colchester with no delay, they
found he was not at his lodgings, and had been away from the
early morning.</p>

<p>They hung about until three o'clock, and then reluctantly set
out upon their return journey to the city.</p>

<p>At the Mansion House there was a block in the traffic, and a
paper boy came rushing by, flourishing a big contents-bill.</p>

<p>"TWO MORE MURDERS IN ESSEX," it ran, and Stone, leaning out of
the car, snatched a paper from the newsboy's hand. There were
large, startling headlines on the front page.</p>

<p>"THE TOLL OF CRIME CONTINUES UNCHECKED," he read. "A DOCTOR
MURDERED IN EPPING, AND A PAWNBROKER ON STRATFORD BROADWAY,
BLUDGEONED TO DEATH. DREADFUL DETAILS."</p>

<p>"Good God, Eli!" he exclaimed hoarsely, "this is our doing.
We've scared them, and they're striking before they run to earth.
They're making sure to cover up their tracks." His voice shook.
"But this is not the end, I feel it. There'll be more murder
done, yet."</p>

<p>And next morning news came through from Colchester that a man
had been stabbed to death there, in the park. Later it was
announced that he was a painter by trade, and that his name was
Fred Duke. His murderer had not been apprehended.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. &mdash; THE DREADFUL ISLAND.</h2>

<p class="first">IN the meantime it would speedily have become
apparent to any watcher upon the island that a veritable nest of
hornets had been stirred into activity by the discovery of the
gang that Dr. Shillington's new butler had been Gilbert
Larose.</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper had seen the two detectives, Carter and Stone,
pass back over the causeway, and had breathed a great sigh of
relief when at length their car had disappeared into the
distance.</p>

<p>"Well, thank goodness, they've gone," he remarked to himself,
and then he nodded his head thoughtfully. "They're shrewd men,
for policemen, those fellows, especially the stout one. He's got
eyes all over his head, and is as wary as an old fox. He was
untrusting, too&mdash;very. He didn't touch that whisky until I'd
had a drink first. Thought there was poison in it, probably." He
sighed again. "Well, I'll go and get a bit of sleep now. Damn
this rotten lung of mine!"</p>

<p>He passed back into the hall, and then noticed Mother Heggarty
who was sitting back in an arm-chair in the corner. Her attitude
was one of great weariness. He put on his glasses and regarded
her critically.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Nan?" he shouted. "Aren't you well?" She
shook her head feebly. "I've a pain here," she replied, and she
pressed her hand to her left side.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" he shouted, "that's nothing, only wind." He patted her
shoulder kindly. "But I'll get Dr. Shillington to give you a
tonic. He'll be coming down to see us soon."</p>

<p>She smiled tremulously. "You always were good to me, Master
Alan," she said, and her old eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>He passed slowly into his room, and pouring himself out a dose
of medicine from a large bottle that stood upon the mantelshelf,
dropped back wearily upon the bed and closed his eyes. He tossed
uneasily for quite a long time, but then his restlessness
gradually subsiding, he sank off to sleep.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon before he came out of his room
again, and then it was with very shaky steps that he walked into
the hall.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he muttered with a wry smile, "the old girl and I are
going to croak together. We must go slow." He glanced out through
the window. "But, by James! How dark it's getting. There's going
to be a hell of a storm soon."</p>

<p>He walked out to the doorway, and stood idly regarding the
scene before him. The beautiful morning had given place to an
afternoon of quite a different character, and a storm was on the
verge of breaking.</p>

<p>Big angry clouds had banked themselves up over the marshes,
and the sky was black as night. All sounds of life were hushed,
and an oppressive stillness filled the air.</p>

<p>"Thunder coming," was his comment, and even as he spoke the
lightning flashed. Then, as the thunder pealed, he saw a motor
car shoot out like a bullet upon the marsh road. It was
travelling at a great pace, the evident intention of its driver
being to gain shelter before the storm broke. But he was a few
seconds too late, for just when the car reached the river bank
the wind rose with an enormous sigh, and then the rain crashed
down like a solid sheet of water.</p>

<p>He sprang back into the house and slammed to the door.</p>

<p>"Stiff luck," he muttered. "Brother Sarle has got it in the
neck." He shook his head frowningly. "A bad homecoming, an omen
of evil for us all."</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later and Sarle entered. He flung off a
dripping coat and cap and then, with a curt nod to Colonel
Jasper, mixed himself a stiff brandy and soda and tossed it down
with a gulp.</p>

<p>"An unpleasant ending to a pleasant day," he remarked quietly
as he put down the glass. "The damned rain caught me just on the
causeway, and I had to drive blind up the bank, couldn't see a
yard." He began to unlace his shoes. "And my feet now, are
soaking."</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the colonel after a moment.</p>

<p>"All's well," replied Sarle, and he moved across the hall
towards the passage. "But I'll talk to you in a minute. I must
wash my hands first. They've been annoying me all the way home."
He grinned. "They're sticky&mdash;or at least the right one is."
He laughed with enjoyment at the look of disgust that he saw at
once spread over the colonel's face, and then added sharply. "But
put a match to the fire, will you? I shall have to burn this coat
now. One of the sleeves has got a stain on it that would be
difficult to explain if I were questioned," and he disappeared
behind the curtain.</p>

<p>The colonel sighed, but lit the fire as he had been requested,
and then sat staring as the sparks from the burning wood flew up
the chimney.</p>

<p>The room was still in semi-darkness, and the rain lashed
fiercely upon the windows. Another flash of lightning and another
peal of thunder followed, right over the house this time, it
seemed.</p>

<p>"And I hope he likes it," muttered the colonel grimly. "He is
afraid of thunder, although he'll never own it, and he's damned
superstitious, too, like all sailors. He'll believe this storm
means bad luck, coming now as it has."</p>

<p>Sarle appeared again in a few minutes, and rolling up the coat
that he was carrying, placed it carefully at the back of the
fire.</p>

<p>"Well, that's done with," he remarked with satisfaction, "and
there's one strand less in the rope that's going to hang me." He
looked intently at Colonel Jasper. "And you've had them here, I
see. There are big wheel marks on the road."</p>

<p>The colonel nodded. "Three of them," he replied, "but only two
came up to the house." He held Sarle's eyes with his own. "They
were that Carter and that Stone, the ones who called on
Shillington with Larose."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Sarle, and he frowned uneasily as another
flash of lightning lit up the room. He did not speak for a
moment, and then went on. "So, they honor us. Two of the Big Four
again." He nodded his head. "Yes, I thought they'd take it
seriously. But did you have any unpleasantness with them?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the colonel carelessly, "not a bit. Just a few
questions, and then they had a drink and went." He spoke very
quietly. "But what happened with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! everything was quite all right," replied Sarle. "They are
both dead, and I got clear away. I'll tell you about it in a
minute, but I want to hear first about these men." He frowned
again. "Although we expected it, I confess I don't like it that
they came down here so quickly. It looks as if they thought they
knew exactly where to put their hands."</p>

<p>"You devil!" ejaculated the colonel, who had apparently only
just taken in the first part of Sarle's remark. "You'd have no
qualms in murdering anyone."</p>

<p>"No, none whatever," returned Sarle lightly, "and it's lucky,
too, for all of you that I haven't. I do and act when you would
only talk and dream. I'm thorough." He laughed contemptuously.
"Why, Edgehill and I in a crisis are worth a dozen of such as
you."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper sighed. "There are deaths&mdash;and deaths,
Sarle," he said solemnly, "and although I, in my calling, have
put paid to more poor devils than you, still I like to think
sometimes that the other fellow always had some sort of a
chance." He shook his head. "But with you, he never gets
any."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up," said Sarle rudely. "I know, of course, that
you're always a paragon of chivalry. You're&mdash;&mdash;" but
something in the expression on the colonel's face made him cut
short what he was going to say, and he went on in quite a
conciliatory tone. "Now, don't let's argue. I'll justify
everything I've done in a few minutes, but I want to know first,
exactly what these men said when they came here. I'm anxious, I
tell you, as to what happened to-day."</p>

<p>For the moment it looked as if the colonel were not going to
accept the olive branch that Sarle held out, but he evidently
thought better of it, for he smiled coldly, and settled himself
back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Nothing much happened," he replied. "They came and introduced
themselves, and then stated that following upon the death of one
butler, they naturally viewed with suspicion the disappearance of
the other. They had got word from Shillington that we had dined
at the Court last night, and they wanted to know if we had
noticed the man was drunk."</p>

<p>"And you told them?" asked Sarle.</p>

<p>The colonel looked amused. "That as we were all of us more or
less in that condition, we should not have particularly noticed
him if he were so as well."</p>

<p>"Was that wise?" asked Sarle frowning.</p>

<p>"Egad! yes," replied the colonel with a sigh. "I was sodden
with brandy when they came this morning, and must have just
looked the part. My lung had been giving me hell, and I had had
four drinks after you left."</p>

<p>"And they asked for us, of course?" commented Sarle.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I told them you were out for the day. They spoke to
Broome, however, and he was just decently off hand to them
without being downright insolent." The colonel laughed. "If they
had had any suspicion of us Broome would have disarmed them, I am
sure. He was in one of his, I'm a-gentleman-and-you're-not-moods,
and looked as innocent as a child."</p>

<p>"And do you think they had any suspicion then?" asked Sarle
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Might have had at first," replied the Colonel, "but they soon
thawed, and, as I say, had a drink with me." He frowned. "But
they looked shrewd men, who would never say much. The thin man,
Carter, did all of the talking, but the stout one was all eyes
and ears and I should fear him the more. I could see he was
taking in everything. They said, by-the-by, that as they were
likely to be in the neighborhood, they might call again."</p>

<p>"Oh! will they?" snapped Sarle, "then I'll be away, as I was
to-day. I'm not afraid," he added, scornfully, "but it's foolish
to run any unnecessary risks." His face brightened. "Well, we've
got over two dangers today. Isaacstein sleeps, with his fathers,
and the doctor from Epping will poison no more patients. They are
both&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But there was a loud peal of thunder, and the walls of the
house seemed to shake, and then for the time the roar of the wind
and the lashing of the hail against the windows made further
speech quite impossible.</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper leaned forward in his chair and stared out
wide-eyed across the darkened room, but Sarle sat back with his
hands clenched and his eyes tightly closed.</p>

<p>Several minutes followed, and then the hail ceased, the wind
died down, and the violence of the storm began to abate.</p>

<p>"Gad! what a wind!" Colonel Jasper exclaimed. "I thought the
windows were coming in."</p>

<p>Sarle nodded carelessly. "Pretty rough, certainly." He yawned,
as if he were bored. "But it's a good thing it didn't happen
earlier in the day. It would have upset all my plans."</p>

<p>The Colonel regarded him curiously. "And you killed them
both?" he asked slowly, "and got away without being seen?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Sarle, and he flicked the ashes from his
cigarette. "Both quite neat jobs, too. Isaacstein died within ten
seconds of us being alone and the doctor within half a minute.
For just one second the Jew knew that he was going to die&mdash;I
saw it in his eyes&mdash;but the doctor had no idea at all. I
struck him behind the ear, and then finished him when he was upon
the ground." He smiled grimly. "Both happy deaths. Just exactly
what I would wish myself, Jasper. No suffering, no tedious
anticipation of disease, none of the unpleasant incidents of
sickness. Just one lightning stroke, and it was all over." He
puffed at his cigarette. "Really, I was doing a kindness. I am a
benefactor of my kind."</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Colonel Jasper, curtly.</p>

<p>"Very little beyond what I've told you," replied Sarle. "The
Jew took me into his private room and as he turned from closing
the door I struck him. Then, within a minute I was out through
the window and walking away along the back street." He frowned.
"I would dearly have loved, however, to stop and look over his
room a little&mdash;I heard his keys jingle in his pocket as he
fell, but it wouldn't have been wise and I left well alone. As
for the doctor, I saw no one but him at his house. I went into
the waiting room and sat down, and then after a minute or two, he
came out of his surgery and beckoned me in. He was just sitting
down when I saw his eyebrows come sharply together. He had
recognised me. 'Oh, beg pardon, one moment,' he said. 'I've got
to speak to a patient on the phone.'" Sarle's eyes glinted
venomously. "I knew what he was going to do. It was to the police
he was going to speak. No rotten patient." Sarle pursed up his
lips. "But he didn't speak on the phone. He never spoke again. I
got him as he passed me, and it was all over in ten seconds."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper stirred uneasily in his chair. "And you came
away unseen?" he asked slowly.</p>

<p>Sarle nodded. "Just rode off on my bicycle, picked up my car
again in the forest, had an uneventful journey down, and here I
am." A note of enthusiasm crept into his voice. "Yes it has been
a great day, a great artist and his work."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then the colonel sighed heavily.
"We are all mad, every one of us," he said slowly. "We are
mentally and morally warped. You take human life as a normal man
would swat flies. Shillington murders as if it were a matter of
duty. Edgehill kills with the complacency of a butcher felling an
ox, and I&mdash;&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders, "just drift
along in the evil company I am in." He sank back in his chair.
"We are beasts of the jungle, nothing more nothing less."</p>

<p>Sarle laughed in amusement. "Well, very capable beasts, at all
events, for we escape capture every time."</p>

<p>"But what do we get out of it?" asked the colonel sharply.
"What rest or peace shall we ever have now?"</p>

<p>"What do I get out of it?" echoed Sarle and a rapt expression
crossed his face. "I get a lot, I tell you." He nodded his head
vigorously. "Why, never before has life given me such a thrill as
it gave when I got Isaacstein to-day." He raised his voice in his
enthusiasm. "Listen. I have killed four robbers single-handed on
a lonely track in the Punjab, withheld my fire until a charging
tigress was within a dozen feet of where I stood, and dived in
shark-infested waters to rescue a man who was my friend, but
never was there that intense ecstacy of achievement as when the
Jew fell down at my feet this morning, and&mdash;I got unscathed
away." He bent forward and touched the colonel on the arm. "Why
just think of it, Jasper. I snatched him up with unlocked doors
only between me and three of his servants, not fifty feet away.
Through the open window came the roar of the traffic as I struck,
and on the pavements outside were hundreds of people passing. The
police station was within shouting distance, and I had seen there
was actually a police officer standing outside the shop as I went
in." He laughed scornfully. "Yes, the might of the law was
everywhere, and under its protection the common herd were living
out their little humdrum lives&mdash;and yet I made a mock of
everything. I just walked info the Jew's place, gave him sleep
everlasting, and then just walked out again. I was above them
all. I was the master."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper shook his head. "You are mad, Sarle," he
repeated. "We are all mad, we are beasts of the jungle, everyone
of us, I say."</p>

<p>Sarle rose to his feet. "Well, I'm a hungry one," he smiled.
He looked round the room, and then his smile turned into a scowl.
"But why isn't the table laid and where's the old woman?"</p>

<p>"She's not well, and has gone to her bedroom," replied the
colonel. "We shall have to get our meal ourselves to-night."</p>

<p>"And why the hell don't you get rid of her?" asked Sarle.</p>

<p>"She has nowhere to go to, and she's old," replied Colonel
Jasper.</p>

<p>"There's the workhouse," said Sarle brutally. "Dump her there
to-morrow and get someone else. It'll be quite safe now. We
shan't be doing anything for some while."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the colonel very quietly; "but she's been in
our family&mdash;as I believe you know&mdash;for over fifty
years. She is dependent upon me."</p>

<p>"Well, what is there to eat?" grumbled Sarle. "I've not had a
bite since I left here this morning."</p>

<p>"Broome caught some whiting this morning. I saw a dishful in
the kitchen just now. He'll cook them for us." The colonel raised
his voice. "Broome," he called out, "come here, will you? I want
you."</p>

<p>A moment's silence followed, and then they heard a door open,
the curtains parted, and Broome came into the room.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked crossly. "You're
always&mdash;&mdash;" But he suddenly stopped speaking and
sniffed hard. "What's that burning?" he asked sharply.
"Something's on fire."</p>

<p>"Only some pieces of old rag," replied Sarle carelessly. "I
threw them on the fire."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Broome, and he looked curiously at him. "But
it's a jacket you're burning. I smell the bone buttons. There's
never any mistaking that characteristic smell. I always
know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind now what you know," interrupted Colonel Jasper,
glancing with some amusement at Sarle, "but Mother Heggarty's
ill, and we want you to cook those whiting you caught."</p>

<p>"I'm not a cook," snapped Broome haughtily.</p>

<p>"But you are," smiled the colonel, "and a far better one than
anyone here. Come on, now," he went on persuasively, "and be a
good chap. You've had a beautiful catch to-day."</p>

<p>"I caught an eel, too," muttered Broome, as if speaking to
himself, "and it was over six feet long."</p>

<p>"Over six feet long!" ejaculated Sarle frowning. "Where the
devil is it?"</p>

<p>"I let it go," replied Broome calmly.</p>

<p>"Let it go!" repeated Sarle with his eyes screwed up. "What
the devil for?"</p>

<p>"I didn't want it," said Broome. "It smelt fishy." There was a
dead silence, and then he turned to leave the room. "All right,
I'll cook the whiting."</p>

<p>The curtain fell behind him, and Sarle and the colonel looked
meaningly at each other.</p>

<p>"He caught no six foot eel," scoffed Sarle. "He's going dotty
to lie to us like that."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the colonel, and he frowned thoughtfully,
"we'll have to speak to Shillington about him. He was strange too
this morning. He told me he'd seen a fox go into the woodshed and
when I went with him to look, of course there wasn't one
there."</p>

<p>"Do you think he's dangerous?" asked Sarle quickly. "If he
goes mental again he might tell everything."</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed the Colonel hurriedly as if he sensed
further violence. "Shillington's always told us that he'd been a
melancholic and they never open their mouths, so we're quite safe
there."</p>

<p>They had their meal in silence and with it over, Broome
immediately got up and retired into his room.</p>

<p>"The storm's all gone," remarked Sarle looking out of the
window. "It's beautifully clear now and I'm half inclined to go
out and set some night lines. The tide'll just be right."</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard the noise of a car and in a minute a motor
horn sounded outside.</p>

<p>"Shillington," exclaimed Colonel Jasper. "I thought we'd see
him. I suppose the storm kept him from coming earlier."</p>

<p>The door opened and the doctor entered the room. Twilight had
begun to fall and the place was full of shadows.</p>

<p>"For God's sake light the lamp," he exclaimed irritably. "The
place is like a cellar," and when Sarle had compiled, he asked
eagerly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, what happened here? They came to bluster with me. Did
they see you, Sarle?"</p>

<p>Sarle shook his head. "No, I was away," he replied grimly. "I
only got back this afternoon just as the storm began."</p>

<p>"Well what happened?" repeated the doctor, and then Colonel
Jasper once more related all that had taken place.</p>

<p>"I had to give your names," explained Dr. Shillington, "but
later, I found they knew them before they asked me. They had been
cross-examining Barton at the Lodge." He frowned. "They are very
suspicious about something." He looked uneasily at Sarle. "These
two men are very dangerous. They are the very best they've got at
Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"Exactly," commented Sarle coldly, "and it's you who've
brought them down upon us, Shillington. Take that in, my
friend."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," exclaimed the doctor angrily. "I had a dreadful
situation to deal with and I handled it in the best way possible.
Looking back I don't see how I could have done anything different
from what I did."</p>

<p>"But you bungled somewhere," said Sarle gloomily. "You did or
said something that aroused their suspicions and you've brought
them down upon us."</p>

<p>"But I tell you," insisted the doctor sharply, "they are not
ordinary men, these two, and it's their trade to be suspicious
about everyone. When you've met them yourself, you'll see." He
puckered up his eyebrows suddenly and lowered his voice almost to
a whisper.</p>

<p>"But I was forgetting. What did you get out of Larose?"</p>

<p>There was an embarrassed silence and then Colonel Jasper
laughed uneasily&mdash;</p>

<p>"I got a damn bad cold," he said, "Sarle got a bout of evil
temper, Edgehill has another death to answer for, and Broome has
been mental ever since." His voice dropped to an ordinary
conversational tone. "Larose threw himself out of the boat into
the river, and Edgehill had to shoot him." He shrugged his
shoulders. "No, we got nothing out of him. We never had an
opportunity to ask him a single question."</p>

<p>"Damn," swore Dr. Shillington in amazement, "and he got away
from the lot of you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," drawled the colonel, "he did us there, right enough."
And he proceeded to tell what had taken place the previous
night.</p>

<p>The doctor's face was the picture of disgust. "And you had the
key of everything in your possession," he snarled, "and you let
it slip out of your hands. Why, we could have learnt exactly how
much they suspected, and where our danger was, and
now&mdash;&mdash;" he scowled angrily, "we are as much in the
dark as ever." He looked intently at Sarle. "And where were you
when those men came here to-day?"</p>

<p>"I was busy," said Sarle slowly, "in closing down certain
other avenues of investigation that I thought these supermen of
yours might possibly approach. In other words, I was slitting
throats."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the doctor, scowling again. "Come
down to facts."</p>

<p>And then Sarle did come down to facts, detailing with ill-concealed pride, all that had happened to him during the day.</p>

<p>At first Dr. Shillington sat listening open-mouthed, the only
expression on his face being that of amazement, but as the
recital proceeded, it was obvious that he was uneasy, and finally
when Sarle had finished, he rose with an oath to his feet.</p>

<p>"Damnation," he swore bitterly, "and you called me a bungler.
Why, man, you couldn't have done worse." His voice rose in anger.
"There'll be the devil to pay for this."</p>

<p>"I don't follow," said Sarle coldly.</p>

<p>"Don't follow!" exclaimed the doctor angrily, "why, can't you
see these fellows will regard this as a direct answer to their
sending Larose down here. They will know at once now that they
scored a bull's-eye when that damned detective was planted in my
house. They'll say to themselves, 'We're right on the spot, we
hit them somewhere, and they're squeaking now.' Call me a
bungler?" he snarled. "Why, you've focused a searchlight on this
house. They'll connect up all these killings together now."</p>

<p>"And what if they do?" asked Sarle coldly. "They won't get any
good out of it. At least, it can be only surmise on their parts.
They haven't a shred of proof."</p>

<p>"Oh! haven't they?" replied the doctor. "Don't you be too sure
of it. You may have been well taken stock of today."</p>

<p>Sarle shook his head. "No one noticed me in the shop," he
replied decisively. "I am sure of that, because when I went in
all the assistants were busy with customers, and, after a quick
word with Isaacstein, I was led instantly into the private
office. It all happened within a few seconds, and
besides&mdash;no one could give any identifying description of me
as I wore those big glasses and my cap was right down over my
eyes. As for Epping&mdash;&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders,
"there was no one about to see me. I saw no one and no one saw
me."</p>

<p>But the doctor was in no wise convinced. "And even if we're
all safe up to now," he said, with his small eyes twinkling
viciously, "what about when Bull goes for the Tilleys, as you've
paid him to? He's not so experienced a cutthroat as you are by
any means, and one slip may mean the black cap for every one of
us. No, no, you're going no-trumps on a bad club hand."</p>

<p>"I have every trust in Bull," said Sarle coolly.</p>

<p>"Trust," replied the doctor, raising his voice angrily. "Who's
talking about trust? I wasn't. It was competence I was referring
to; competence, cleverness, finesse." He sneered. "Bull is a good
butcher, I grant you, and if you truss up an animal before him,
he'll kill as bloodily as anyone could wish. But he's not a
hunter. He's not light-footed, and he can't catch the animal
first. He'll make a mess of it on his own and then&mdash;&mdash;"
he sighed disgustedly. "But what's the good of talking. It's done
now."</p>

<p>Sarle laughed contemptuously. "You've got the jumps, Doctor.
Those 'tecs rattled you this morning."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper stood up between them.</p>

<p>"Well, that's enough," he said firmly. "What is done is done,
and it's no good arguing about it. So we'll just drop it,
please." He turned to Dr. Shillington. "There are three patients
for you here to-night. The old woman's crook, Broome's going
balmy, and my damned lung hurts like hell. Come and see Mother
Heggarty first."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later and Dr. Shillington had examined
all his patients and gone off again in the car.</p>

<p>"Well, what did he say?" asked Sarle. "I didn't want to speak
to the old fool again. He annoyed me, tonight."</p>

<p>"Oh, he didn't say much," replied the Colonel carelessly. "He
wasn't too interested in any of us. Mother Heggarty's old enough
to die anytime now, he says; Broome may get better or he may get
worse, and I'm to go on with the morphia." He smiled in dry
amusement. "Funny chap. Shillington. As our host last night he
couldn't do too much for us, but as our medical adviser&mdash;he
just doesn't care one little damn. He'll not be giving us another
thought."</p>

<p>But the Colonel was mistaken there, for had he only known it,
Dr. Shillington was giving them quite a lot of thought that
night. He was thinking about them all and about Sarle in
particular, and hardened criminal though the latter was, he
surely would have shuddered not a little if he could but have
known what was passing in the doctor's mind.</p>

<p>The night was chilly and the great specialist sat meditating
before a big, bright fire. An expensive cigar was in his mouth
and a decanter of rare old port stood at his elbow.</p>

<p>The room was that of a man who delved in the beautiful and
spiritual things of life, and culture and refinement were
undoubtedly the keynotes there. The walls were lined everywhere
with books, great master works of the greatest human minds.</p>

<p>Biographies of great men who had been of service to the world,
and whose lives were as a shining light for the lesser ones to
follow. Histories of all the happenings of time, and with the
lessons that they gave to guide and point the way to happiness
and truth. Treatises on all the ills that flesh is heir to, and
telling how best to palliate the pains and sufferings of mankind.
Books on philosophy, books on poetry, on music, and on art.</p>

<p>Yes, culture and refinement were all about him, and yet,
surely a brute beast of prey could not have had more dreadful
thoughts, nor have been dreaming more dreadful dreams than
he.</p>

<p>"I am tired of these men," was the burden of his thoughts.
"They have become a bore and a nuisance to me. Once it was
excitement for me to work with them, to organise, to prepare, and
to lead them upon adventure on the precipice side. Now, however,
their coarseness palls, and they are involving me in foolish
dangers that may end finally if I do not take care, in bringing
me, in the eyes of the world, down to a common felon's level in
the dock. Therefore, I must cut myself adrift from them before
it's too late. It is a pity they are not all dead. They are none
of them healthy, and from the way they are ordering their lives,
they can none of them expect to live to a ripe old age. Sarle's
blood pressure is dangerously high; Edgehill will have a
cirrhosed liver before very long; Jasper is doomed already, and
Broome has undoubtedly strong suicidal tendencies. Yes, in any
case, they will not live very long, and there are many ways now
that suggest themselves to me of anticipating things a little, so
I will consider which one would be practical and best."</p>

<p>He stared thoughtfully into the fire.</p>

<p>"Now, where did I see those amanita mushrooms the other day,
the beautiful-looking, poisonous ones, all red-flecked and white?
Ah! I remember. By the church yard wall, when we were burying the
archdeacon last week. Now, I wonder if anybody's trodden them
down. I'll go and see to-morrow, and as an excuse I'll take some
flowers to put on the old man's grave. He was a good preacher,
and if he did talk a lot of nonsense, still, he had a fine flow
of words. Yes, they are deadly, those fungi, and Voronoff says
even a small portion will kill in a couple of hours. And it
should, too, for chemically their poison is indistinguishable
from that of the rattlesnake. Certainly their outer coloring is
unusual, but if I peeled some of them, and placed a number among
some ordinary mushrooms, who would notice there was anything
wrong?"</p>

<p>He stared on into the fire.</p>

<p>"Yes, and if I can't get them, I can use hyosine. I could dose
a bottle of whisky, and change it for one of their's, one day
when they are out. Two good nips then, and they would be knocking
at the doors of kingdom come." He sighed. "But I should prefer
mushrooms if I could get them; it would excite less comment
afterwards, I think," and he poured himself out another glass of
port.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. &mdash; THE HOUNDS ON THE TRAIL.</h2>

<p class="first">THE following morning Sarle was up betimes and
scanning anxiously across the marsh road. "Seven o'clock," he
muttered, frowning, "he ought to be here by now, even if he had
to take a detour round. Two hours should have been quite long
enough and he was to meet the man at five." He swore savagely.
"Damn, if anything should have gone wrong."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper joined him presently and with a very wearied
expression on his face, stood blinking in the sun.</p>

<p>"The lamb not returned to the fold yet?" he yawned, and then
he grinned maliciously. "Perhaps the naughty butcher's caught him
and cut his little throat."</p>

<p>Sarle scowled but made no reply, and then walking over to the
wood pile he picked up an axe and began to hack viciously at some
logs.</p>

<p>"Getting nervy," commented the Colonel, and then he sighed,
"So are we all." He looked out across the marshes. "Shouldn't be
a bit surprised now if a Black Maria turned up here any day.
We've had a good run of luck, but it wasn't going to last for
ever, we might have known."</p>

<p>They had breakfast in silence, Broome having prepared the meal
as a matter of course, there being no appearance of Mother
Heggarty, and then they went outside again and sat just off the
porch in the sun. Sarle fidgetted about but made no reference to
the matter that was undoubtedly uppermost in his mind; Broome
read and Colonel Jasper lay back in his chair with half-closed
eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Sarle suddenly when they had been sitting
there for fully an hour. "Here he is at last."</p>

<p>"And he's got a new bicycle," said Broome, lifting his eyes
lazily from his book, "and it's much too small for him, too."</p>

<p>Edgehill, riding up at a smart pace over the causeway, wheeled
his machine at once into one of the sheds and then returning to
where they were all sitting, asked nonchalantly for a
cigarette.</p>

<p>"It's done," he said carelessly, when he had settled himself
down beside them, "but I was seen and had to run for it. I had a
devil of a job to get away and came back through Manningtree for
safety." He took a crumpled newspaper out of his pocket and
tossed it over to Sarle. "But I see you got on all right. They've
given you half of the front page. Read what they say of you."</p>

<p>Sarle just glanced at the newspaper and then looked back at
Edgehill.</p>

<p>"But what happened?" he asked. "You were to meet him this
morning at five."</p>

<p>Edgehill nodded. "I posted the letter," he said, "so that he
got it by last night's post. Then before it was light this
morning I was in the park and hiding my bicycle behind some trees
not far from the statue. Duke came up a little after five just as
it had got light. I didn't notice anyone about and after a word
or two, suggested we should talk among the trees. He turned to go
that way and I got him instantly between the shoulders. He must
have been dead in two seconds. I heard a shout and saw a man
running for me and yelling with all his might. I didn't know that
there mightn't be others about, and so decided to bolt, but the
devil of it was the man was between me and my bicycle, and in
consequence I had to bolt on foot. I daren't risk either going
out of the park by any of the gates, in case anyone coming in
should hear the shouting behind me. So I climbed the fence and
got out on to the road through some private gardens."</p>

<p>"A damned woman saw me then, quite close. She was in her back
yard hanging out some clothes." Edgehill gritted his teeth. "I
would have gone for her, too, but I had thrown my knife into a
pond as I ran&mdash;it was too dangerous to keep on me&mdash;and
there was nothing handy to finish her off with. So I just passed
her and ran on. Well, I got on to the road, and then, a piece of
luck, a milkman drew up in his cart and hopped up the drive of
the house opposite, with his pail. Directly he was round the
corner I borrowed his turnout and drove it for a good two miles
until I was right on the other side of the city. Then I left it
in a lane and took a newspaper boy's bicycle that I saw standing
outside a house. I chucked all the papers off the carrier except
that one, rode out through Manningtree, took it quite quietly,
zigzagging through all the by-lanes I could, and here I am."</p>

<p>Sarle frowned. "Certain you killed him?" he asked.</p>

<p>Edgehill laughed scornfully. "Certain," he replied, "as
certain as you must have been yesterday after your own little
jobs." He pointed to the newspaper. "But read what they say about
you there."</p>

<p>That afternoon, after their mid-day meal, the dwellers in the
Priory proceeded to hold a solemn council of war and take stock
of their position. Sarle and Edgehill, however, did most of the
talking, for Colonel Jasper appeared to be too tired to be much
interested in anything, and Broome was engrossed in the perusal
of a book on 'Vegetable Poisons.'</p>

<p>"Shillington's been trying to frighten us," growled Sarle,
summing up the situation, "for he makes out the police are bound
to view all these kills together as a whole, and because the
butler's death and Larose's disappearance both took place down
here, then we in consequence shall be in the limelight in a
damned unpleasant way. He argues Scotland Yard will say, 'That
butler died in Great Oakley, we sent Larose down to find out why,
and he met the same fate. Therefore some condition of dealing out
sudden death continues to exist there. We are right over the spot
of some underworld of crime. We are hot on the scent of
something. We are on someone's trail.'" Sarle frowned heavily.
"That's Shillington's idea."</p>

<p>Edgehill sniffed. "Don't think much of it," was his comment.
"The police are too stodgy, for one thing, and besides, if they
had any imagination, how in the name of fortune could there be
any linking up the death of a pawnbroking old Jew on Stratford
Broadway with that of a house-painter in Colchester, fifty miles
away?"</p>

<p>"That's what I say," exclaimed Sarle eagerly. "Shillington is
working himself into a state of funk."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's becoming a nuisance," said Edgehill bluntly, "and
it wouldn't be a bad thing for everyone if his own wooden
overcoat came along now." He looked intently at Sarle. "I suggest
we invite him to go fishing and then scuttle the boat. The old
quack says he can't swim."</p>

<p>Sarle trod heavily on Edgehill's foot, and flashing a quick
note of warning, frowned in the direction of the apparently half-slumbering Colonel Jasper.</p>

<p>"Yes, Shillington's a fool," he said, frowning. "But we
needn't worry over him, nor, I am sure, about anybody else,
either. As I take it, all we've got to do is to sit tight. Let
the damned police think what they like, they've nothing definite
against us when it comes down to bed-rock. We can snap our
fingers at them if we only keep our heads."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington came over in his car in the afternoon, and
contrary to the expectations of Sarle, was amiability itself.
Apparently he had quite forgotten the unpleasantness of the
previous evening, and he listened with amusement to Edgehill's
recital of what had happened at Colchester that morning.</p>

<p>"Excellent," was his comment. "That man was a real menace to
us, and it's a relief to think that he's out of the way."</p>

<p>He had brought with him a bottle of old port for Colonel
Jasper, and was most solicitous as to how the latter felt.
Broome, too, came in for some attention, but in this latter case
the attention was by no means well received. The patient was
taciturn and sulky, and hardly spoke a word.</p>

<p>"A little disturbing, his condition," commented the doctor to
the others, when later he was taking his leave. "I'm afraid we
may have to get him put away again. I don't like those lies he's
been telling. They're a bad sign. He may sink into profound
melancholia and refuse to take his food. He was like that for
over two years, and had to be nasal fed for the whole time. I'll
come over again, however, to-morrow and see how he is. I can come
openly now, having three patients to attend, and the more open we
are the better."</p>

<p>That evening an air of peace and even gaiety prevailed in the
Priory. Mother Heggarty seemed better, and sat dozing in her
accustomed chair in the corner; Broome read assiduously in a
world of his own; and the others played dummy bridge, and when
they were tired of that discussed in detail their adventures of
the previous months. Colonel Jasper enjoyed several glasses of
the port that Dr. Shillington had brought, which Sarle and
Edgehill, however, resolutely refused to touch.</p>

<p>"No, Jasper," said the former smilingly, "it's your dope, and
it was given specially to you. Whisky's quite good enough for
us."</p>

<p>But if that evening they had been happy and care-free, the
next morning decidedly brought its disturbing thoughts.</p>

<p>The butcher appeared just after breakfast, and, as usual, when
he made an early delivery, he carried with him the London
newspapers.</p>

<p>Sarle took them from him, and his face paled and his hands
shook as his eyes fell upon the middle page of the one he
opened.</p>

<p>"Damn!" he ejaculated. "What the devil's this?" for, under big
staring headlines he read&mdash;</p>

<p>"MURDERER OF EPPING DOCTOR SEEN. FULL DESCRIPTION GIVEN TO THE
POLICE. OUR SPECIAL COMMISSIONER MAKES STARTLING
DISCOVERIES."</p>

<p>And certainly they were startling discoveries that the 'Daily
Microphone' in great jubilation proceeded to spread over three
columns of its most important page.</p>

<p>A young married couple residing about a mile and a half out of
Epping had been unearthed by one of their star reporters and this
was the story that they had told.</p>

<p>They were on their honeymoon, and on the day of the murder
they had been roaming idly in the forest, on pleasure bent.</p>

<p>At five minutes to two on that afternoon, they were quite
certain of the exact time, they had came upon a two-seater Jehu
car parked in a lonely glade in the forest, less than a mile from
the town. The car was not three hundred yards distant from the
main London road, but it was hidden from view of anyone passing
by upon the road by the thick undergrowth and the trees. It could
only have been left there for a few minutes before they found it,
for the radiator was almost too hot, even then, for them to touch
with their hands. They were surprised that anyone should have
chanced leaving it there unprotected, for on the back seat there
were articles of clothing spread about, and a suit case, and a
good Trilby hat. They had inspected the car interestedly, but
unhappily had no recollection at all of the figures on the
number-plates. After a few minutes' discussion as to who could
have left it there, they had come away and proceeded to walk
slowly home, stopping every now and then to gather flowers upon
their way. Then just before they had reached the house where they
were residing, and now walking on the main road, they had heard a
motor car coming up behind them from the direction of Epping,
and, turning round, they had seen at once that it was the very
car they had so recently left in the forest glade. They were
quite sure it was the same car, because not only were all the
curtains up, which was peculiar upon so sultry a day, but the end
one was unfastened, which they had noticed before, and it was now
flapping in the wind.</p>

<p>The car was coming along quite leisurely, and stepping off on
to the side of the road to let it pass, they had ample
opportunity to take stock of its driver. He was between thirty
and forty years of age; he was not a big man; he had dark eyes,
and his complexion was very sallow. He was then wearing the
Trilby hat they had seen earlier lying on the back seat. They
were quite sure they would recognise him again, anywhere.</p>

<p>Then the representative of the journal, very much alive to the
fact that there was a good story to be fashioned out of the
information he had received, had started to make investigations
on his own, and very quickly he had been amply rewarded for his
pains.</p>

<p>The hiding away of the car in that lonely glade had seemed to
him suggestive, and mindful of the fact that the only clue to the
doctor's murder that the police so far possessed was the
statement of the woman in the baker's shop opposite to the
doctor's house, that just about the time when the murder must
have been committed, she had seen a man ride off on a bicycle
from the doctor's surgery door&mdash;he was intrigued with the
idea that there was some connecting link between the undoubtedly
guilty cyclist and the mysterious motorist of the forest
glade.</p>

<p>Therefore he had argued to himself that if he were right and
the bicyclist and the motorist were one and the same individual,
then the criminal and his incriminating machine would part
company at the earliest possible moment. He was sure the murderer
would never have dared to drive off with that bicycle in the back
of his car, knowing full well that the discovery of the murder
could have been only at most a matter of minutes, and with the
telephones set ringing everywhere, he would have been liable at
any moment to be held up and questioned on the road.</p>

<p>So the 'Daily Microphone' representative had gone back with
the newly married couple to the forest glade, and making a wide
cast round, had started upon a systematic search among the
undergrowth, and within a few minutes he had found what he
expected.</p>

<p>Under a thick bush, not a hundred yards from where the car had
been parked, he had discovered a bicycle, and that it had been
there almost only a matter of hours was evidenced by the fact
that the saddle of it was quite dry, and there was no tarnish
anywhere on the bright parts of the machine.</p>

<p>"Now," said the 'Daily Microphone' in conclusion, "we leave
the rest to the authorities, and in no spirit of boastfulness we
nevertheless do take credit that amid all the dreadful mystery
surrounding the perpetration of this crime in Epping, we have
been enabled to give real help and service to the forces of law
and order. We have supplied them with distinct and definite clues
to follow, for instead of an undescribed man upon an unknown make
of bicycle, we now give them a four-seater Jehu car and an
individual of medium build, dark eyes, and sallow complexion. So
let them see to it that the investigations of our special
commissioner have not been in vain."</p>

<p>Sarle read through the article to its conclusion, and then
composing his features to an expression of careless unconcern,
passed over the newspaper without a word of comment to
Edgehill.</p>

<p>The latter frowned heavily, and then in turn went through the
article without speaking a word.</p>

<p>"Bad luck," he remarked when he had finished, and he looked
quickly at Sarle. "Do you remember passing them?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," replied Sarle quietly, "the man was small and
delicate looking, and the woman was almost a child." He
considered for a moment. "Yes, and I remember their house, too.
It would have been only about a couple of hundred yards further
on from where I passed them, and it stood off well back from the
road." He spoke very quietly. "It is a very lonely house."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper came up to where they were sitting, and
Edgehill handed him the paper.</p>

<p>"So, so, a fly in the ointment," he smiled. "A rift in the
lute. Then Sarle was seen, after he had jiggered in that
doctor."</p>

<p>He sat down and proceeded to peruse the article. Sarle watched
him intently.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the colonel thoughtfully, when he had
finished; "then for one thing, Sarle must freshen up his
complexion at once. We'll have no sallow-looking individuals
here. We've got some cochineal in the house, and artistically
applied, it is better than all these modern concoctions that
women buy now. I've used cochineal myself after a thick night
when I was in the army." He looked across to Sarle. "But if we
were consistent," he added sighing, "these young people would be
buried shortly. They will be dangerous to our peace of mind."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Sarle grimly, and he stared out across the
marshes. "I was thinking of that. I shall put Bull on to them.
He'll do anything for money&mdash;cash down."</p>

<p>"And while there's any killing on, put him on to the baker,
too," added the Colonel, sarcastically. "His bread's been damned
bad lately, and not fit for the pigs to eat."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington made another appearance that afternoon and
blinked his small eyes maliciously as he handed over a copy of
the 'Daily Microphone' to Sarle.</p>

<p>"Seen it already," said the latter sharply. "It's annoying,
but it isn't vital. There are thousands of Jehu cars about, and
it won't help them a bit. They can't be certain of anything. I'm
not the only sallow-faced man in the country, am I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," agreed the doctor readily, and as if for some
reason he was particularly anxious to appear most friendly, "and
regarded in its right perspective, it shouldn't worry us at all."
He looked curiously at him. "But what have you been doing to
yourself. What have you got on your face?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I've opened a beauty parlor here," explained the Colonel
with a grin, "and Sarle is my first client. He's not going to be
sallow-looking any more. To anyone who sees him for the first
time now, he's only just got the ordinary fresh appearance of a
healthy out-of-doors man. You see, he's going to be on view for
the sleuth-hounds of the law when they next come down."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm to face the music." said Sarle carelessly. "We've
thought it over and believe that will be best. We can't go on
being out always; it will make them suspicious."</p>

<p>"And Edgehill?" asked the doctor drily, "is he going to whiten
his face?"</p>

<p>"Edgehill's clipped his eyebrows," laughed the Colonel, "and
he's going about in future all togged up like the real Varsity
man that he is. He's wearing his blazer and his colors, and he's
going to shave every day." He turned up his eyes piously. "Thank
goodness, Brother Edgehill wasn't shaved yesterday when the woman
who was hanging up her clothes saw him. He looked a real hooligan
when he came back here."</p>

<p>"And how's Broome?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"Oh, just so-so," replied the Colonel. "Hardly speaks, and
when he does, it's generally to tell us something that hasn't
happened. He's become a champion liar. The excitement of that
night upon the causeway seems to have knocked him right out. But
you shall see him. He's in his room. Broome, Broome," he called
out. "Dr. Shillington wants to speak to you."</p>

<p>Broome appeared with the inevitable book in his hand. "What's
up?" he asked crossly; "I'm not going to do any more cooking, I'm
sick of it. Great dietists say we should eat raw food, and I
agree with them. So that's final," and he turned to go back into
his room.</p>

<p>"One moment," said Dr. Shillington, and he crossed over and
placed his hand upon Broome's arm. "How are you feeling to-day,
my friend?"</p>

<p>"Quite well," snapped Broome, "except&mdash;&mdash;" and he
glared angrily at Colonel Jasper, "these gluttons here would keep
me going all day long at the kitchen fire. I'm not a cook, I'm a
chemist and an engineer."</p>

<p>"And how do you sleep?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>Instantly, then, the expression on Broome's face altered, his
anger all died down, and his eyes took on a puzzled look.</p>

<p>"Rottenly," he exclaimed, and he lowered his voice to a
whisper. "I keep waking up all night." He put his finger to his
lips and drew the doctor to one side. "There's something going on
in this house that's very strange. I hear noises when they're all
asleep as if someone were crawling overhead. I heard footsteps
distinctly last night and then there was snoring too." He put his
lips close to the doctor's ears, "Yes, there's someone living
above us, here in the roof."</p>

<p>The doctor looked at him thoughtfully. "Well," he said, "why
don't you go up and see?"</p>

<p>Broome drew himself up haughtily and his old curt manner
returned. "It's not a gentleman's work," he replied. "There's too
much dust. It would spoil my clothes."</p>

<p>"All right," said the doctor after a moment, "then I'll give
you something that will make you sleep. Go and lie down now and
read your book."</p>

<p>"Any danger there, Shillington?" asked Sarle when Broome had
gone out. "Is he likely to talk, do you think."</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. "None whatever," he replied. "If he
gets worse, then he'll lose his memory altogether and won't speak
of anything that's past." He looked puzzled. "But I don't
understand this relapse coming on so suddenly. Broome was
perfectly normal at my place the other night and now those noises
he's been hearing are a very bad sign."</p>

<p>"Well, have a look now at Mother Heggarty," said the colonel.
"She's dressed and sitting in her own room, but she's looking
very weak to me, and she seems to eat nothing at all. She's not
been able to work for two days."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington frowned. "I can do nothing there, I tell you.
She's old and may die any time. She oughtn't to be here." He
turned back to Sarle.</p>

<p>"And so you've decided to see these men if they come, you and
Edgehill?"</p>

<p>Sarle nodded. "Yes, we think it will be best. After all,
they're not likely to have seen my face, or Edgehill's either.
You see, they're both London men." He yawned as if he were quite
indifferent to the whole matter. "But, myself, I don't believe
they'll come."</p>

<p>"Oh! won't they?" said the doctor emphatically. "I'm sure they
will. They're obstinate brutes and they must know the only clue
to Larose's disappearance is to be picked up here." He nodded his
head. "Yes, they'll come down here again before they've
done."</p>

<p>And Dr. Shillington was quite right, for sure enough just
before eleven the next morning, the big police car was seen
nosing its way over the marsh.</p>

<p>"Here they are," called out Colonel Jasper. "Now pull
yourselves together and play a cautious game. Be friendly to
them, but not over-interested and whatever you do, don't appear
to be annoyed because they've come."</p>

<p>And then to a psychologist, had he but been a spectator of the
intense little drama that followed, would have surely come, one
of the most interesting studies of his life. There were five
actors, and they were all so efficient in the parts that they had
to play.</p>

<p>There were the two detectives, polite and smiling, masking
their dark suspicions and deadly purpose under the careless air
of men just engaged upon some formal and unimportant mission.
Carter, pleasant and almost deferential in his speech, and Stone,
big and jolly, drinking in all the beauty of the island with the
delighted joy of a jaded Londoner out upon a holiday.</p>

<p>And then, Sarle, a well-travelled, educated gentleman, with
smiling eyes and an attractive courtly manner. And Edgehill,
bluff and open-hearted with the distinguished mien, however, of a
man who in his days had mixed with the best in all the land, and
finally, Colonel Jasper who was a credit both in speech and
conduct to the fine traditions of his Majesty's army.</p>

<p>Indeed, a goodly company, but had the truth been known, there
should have been yet another actor there to complete the cast,
the hangman from one of his Majesty's gaols.</p>

<p>The detectives asked a few questions about the dinner party at
Dr. Shillington's, which both Sarle and Edgehill answered frankly
enough. No, they had neither of them noticed anything peculiar
about the butler that evening, indeed as far as they remembered,
he had seemed a very capable servant and certainly up to the
conclusion of the meal had shown no signs of any alcoholic
excess.</p>

<p>Then Carter adroitly brought the conversation round to their
own lives, and here, too, they were equally as frank. They were
all friends together on the island, they none of them now
followed any settled occupations, and they just lived the simple
life and were devoted to outdoor sports. They played tennis, they
golfed, they went shooting, they went out in their launch and
they fished.</p>

<p>Then Colonel Jasper suggested a little refreshment, and Stone,
taking the lead for the first time, accepted with
alacrity&mdash;he told Carter afterwards that it was most
important that he should see Sarle in his home
environment&mdash;and so they adjourned to the lounge hall. The
Colonel produced whisky and biscuits and lifting their glasses
they all drank to one another's healths.</p>

<p>"I see you've got plenty of lethal weapons here," remarked
Stone presently pointing to some rifles arranged upon the wall.
"You could put up a pretty good fight if anyone invaded the
island."</p>

<p>Sarle smiled engagingly. "They're mostly mine," he laughed.
"Shooting's been one of my hobbies all my life. I've been a
sailor you see, and travelled a lot. I've been after big game in
many parts of the world."</p>

<p>"And those targets there?" asked Stone pointing to a small
cardboard one whose circular markings were just protruding beyond
the edges of a book upon a mantelshelf. "You're good with a
pistol, too?"</p>

<p>Just for one moment perhaps the ghost of a fleeting shadow
passed across Sarle's face, but instantly he was all smiles
again, and, rising from his chair, he stepped up to the
mantleshelf and took down half a dozen little targets that were
behind the book that Stone had noticed.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, smiling, "my pistol work is pretty good, but
I'm not in any way the equal of Mr. Edgehill here. We had a match
yesterday, and I was beaten easily." He handed over one of the
targets to the detective. "Five bulls out of six shots. An inch
bullseye, I admit, but, then, the distance was twenty yards, and
it was rapid firing with a West automatic."</p>

<p>"Splendid," ejaculated Stone with enthusiasm. He looked at
Edgehill and smiled. "Why, you might be the Iron Man, sir, from
the way you shoot."</p>

<p>"So I might be," laughed Edgehill, "but then I should be much
richer than I am now." He became serious. "But, I say, why the
devil haven't you cleaned up those chaps yet? They've had a long
run."</p>

<p>"Too long," agreed Stone readily. "But they've been too clever
for us so far. They've never left any clues."</p>

<p>"And do you think you'll ever get them now, Mr. Stone?" asked
Sarle.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do," replied Stone emphatically. "We're
broadcasting the offer of a big reward to-day, and that should
break them up." He curled his lips in contempt. "There are always
men in a gang like that who will sell their own brothers if they
get paid enough for it. Contrary to general belief, there never
is any honor among thieves. They're a cowardly, despicable lot,
and only brave when they've got a gun, and the other man has
not." He snapped his jaws together. "Yes, directly we get in
touch with one of them it'll mean the end of the whole lot.
They'll be all whimpering and splitting on each other then to
save their own skins. I know their mongrel kind."</p>

<p>A dead silence followed. Sarles rose abruptly to his feet and,
turning his back upon everyone, reached to the mantelshelf for a
match and proceeded leisurely to light a cigarette. Edgehill,
with no expression on his face, sat with his eyes cast down upon
the ground, and it was only Colonel Jasper who seemed to have
taken in what the detective had said. He looked rather amused,
and he spoke presently, very quietly.</p>

<p>"But I don't quite agree with you there, Mr. Detective," he
said. "I've known what you call thieves who were among the
bravest of the brave. On the frontiers of India, for distance,
I've met Pathans who would rob and pillage as a matter of daily
habit, and yet, however, who when detected and caught would
never, under the most dire forms of punishment, give their
comrades away. They had a code of honor that was a religion to
them and lifted them above all suffering or hope of gain."</p>

<p>Stone laughed scornfully. "But the law-breakers are not like
that over here," he said. "They are the scum of the population,
the very dregs of the men of depraved minds."</p>

<p>Another silence followed, and then, as no one seemed disposed
for further argument, the two detectives, after a glance at each
other, rose to their feet.</p>

<p>"Well, I think we must be going," said Carter. "Unhappily
there's always a lot for us to do."</p>

<p>They all went outside again, and then Sarle, showing his
strong white teeth in a pleasant smile said suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! just wait a moment, will you? We'll show you something
before you go." He turned to Edgehill and winked. "Get your
automatic and two lemons will you, old man. We'll give Mr. Stone
here a little treat."</p>

<p>Edgehill looked puzzled. "Lemons!" he said, "what the devil
for?"</p>

<p>"Get them," said Sarle laughing. "You'll find plenty in the
dish, and bring the pistol you were shooting with yesterday."</p>

<p>For just one moment Edgehill hesitated, and then, going back
into the house, returned as he had been bidden with two lemons
and a small automatic pistol.</p>

<p>"Now," exclaimed Sarle, taking the two lemons from him, "we'll
give you an exhibition of real skill." He spoke with great
animation, appearing for some reason to be addressing himself
directly to Stone. "You see that post there. It's exactly twenty
yards away. Well, I'm going to stand there with a lemon, and Mr.
Edgehill will hit it as I hold it in my hand. No," he went on,
"I'm not going to hold it upon my outstretched hand. I'm going to
hold it pressed close against my side. One half of it will
protrude between my fingers, and Mr. Edgehill will pink that
protruding half when he fires. Of course, if my friend shoots
wide, he will miss the lemon altogether, but on the other hand,
if he shoots too close&mdash;&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders
and smiled, "he will plough through my abdomen in an unpleasant
manner." A defiant note crept into his voice. "It's a test of
courage&mdash;&mdash;" he corrected himself quickly, "it's a test
of nerve and skill."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," said Colonel Jasper angrily. "You may get
your pelvis smashed and your internals bored through."</p>

<p>"I'm content," replied Sarle calmly. "I'm prepared to take the
risk."</p>

<p>"But we are police officers," broke in Carter sharply, "and
we'll not be party to any such foolery. We'll not countenance
it."</p>

<p>"But I don't see how you can help it," said Sarle mockingly,
"unless, indeed, you run away. It's my stomach and my lemon, and
Mr. Edgehill here is firing at my request." He turned to the
latter. "You'll shoot, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Edgehill with a grin, "anything to
oblige."</p>

<p>"It's not our funeral, Eli," said Stone grimly. "There's no
necessity for us to interfere."</p>

<p>Sarle stepped briskly up to the post he had indicated and then
stood like a statue holding the lemon in the way he had indicated
he would. Edgehill watched him frowningly with the lowered
automatic in his hand.</p>

<p>"Show a little more fruit, Sarle," he called out "I can only
just see the top of the damned lemon."</p>

<p>"But it's quite enough," said Sarle calmly, and he remained as
he was, perfectly still.</p>

<p>A moment's intense silence followed, and then Edgehill brought
his automatic up sharply and fired. The spectators held their
breaths, but Sarle looked down unconcernedly at his hand, and
then came forward with the lemon held out for inspection.</p>

<p>"Very pretty," he remarked. "See the juice all over my
fingers. The bullet went almost through the very centre." He
looked reprovingly at Edgehill. "But you fired rather close,
didn't you? I distinctly felt the wind upon my hand."</p>

<p>No one made any comment, and then Sarle took the second lemon
out of his pocket, and with a bow held it out smilingly to the
stout detective.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," he said with a laugh, "it's your turn. Hold the
lemon exactly as I did. Keep quite still, and then you'll be
perfectly all right. Close your eyes if you have any doubt about
being able to stand still."</p>

<p>Stone got rather red. "No, thank you," he said, curtly
declining the proffered lemon. "Personally I have no interest at
all in pantomime tricks like these."</p>

<p>Sarle elevated his eyebrows as if in surprise.</p>

<p>"But, surely you're not afraid," he ejaculated, and a sneer
crept into his voice. "I thought, according to you, that it was
only the criminal classes that had no courage."</p>

<p>"It isn't a question of courage," replied the detective
warmly. "It's just that I don't feel justified in running a risk
for no good purpose whatever."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Sarle sarcastically, "then when it suits you,
you gentlemen play for safety just like everybody else."</p>

<p>"We don't play at all when we're at work," snapped the
detective sternly. "We go straight ahead then and do our duty at
whatever cost."</p>

<p>Sarle laughed mockingly, and then suddenly, his whole
expression altered. "Well, take the lemon at all events," he
smiled. "It'll make a nice soft drink for you when you get home,"
and he held it out again to Stone.</p>

<p>Stone smiled back; he had quite recovered his equanimity, and
he pocketed the lemon with no further protest.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said. "Mr. Carter and I will squeeze it into a
drop of Scotch when we get home."</p>

<p>They returned to the big police car, and after polite
farewells, with a wave of their hands, drove away.</p>

<p>"Can't place either of them," remarked Carter when they were
over the causeway. "Can you?" and then when Stone shook his head,
he went on slyly, "But he rather scored over you there, Charlie,
although it was clever of you all the same to have taken the line
you did. You certainly uncovered them by the slanging that you
gave the criminal classes. They're the gang right enough, and
Sarle and Edgehill, particularly, are the ones we want." He
chuckled. "But I should be very interested to hear the remarks
that are being made about us in the Priory, now."</p>

<p>And the remarks of one individual there would certainly have
interested them.</p>

<p>A man was lying up among the rafters over the hall&mdash;a
dishevelled and grimy-looking man. His clothes were crushed and
rumpled as if he had not taken them off for many days, and he was
covered almost from head to foot in dust. His face was drawn and
haggard, but the expression on it nevertheless was quite
serene.</p>

<p>"They're wise old dogs," he muttered, "for they've managed to
pick up the trail somehow and sure they didn't come on another
journey down here for nothing. Every word that they spoke showed
that they knew who these men are, and old Stone only slanged into
the criminal classes to see how that brute Sarle would take it."
The grimy-looking man sighed heavily. "But I'm in a difficult
position now. The longer I stay here the more evidence I am
accumulating to convict the whole gang, and yet if this man
'Bull' they keep talking about comes down, I must find a way
somehow of putting the Yard wise at once, so that he doesn't get
near that honeymoon couple. They are vital to the identification
of Sarle." He shook his head. "Yes, yes, my hand will be forced
then." He shifted his position slightly with an involuntary
grimace of pain "Oh, confound this foot of mine; I couldn't get
over the causeway and crawl a mile and a half to the village now,
if the devil himself were after me." He sighed heavily again.
"Yes, things are awkward, Gilbert, very."</p>

<p>That evening, as dusk fell, a violent wind rose up from over
sea-wards, and by 7 o'clock it was blowing great guns. The wind
roared round the old Priory, rattling the windows like castanets,
and moaning down the wide chimneys like a beast in pain.</p>

<p>"A rough night," remarked Sarle frowning, "and it may prevent
Bull from coming up. I expected him at latest to-night. There'll
be no water on the causeway until after 10 o'clock."</p>

<p>They commenced their customary game of cards. Sarle, Edgehill,
and the Colonel. Broome read as usual, and Mother Heggarty sat
dozing in the corner.</p>

<p>The noise of the wind outside made it necessary for the
players to raise their voices when they had to speak, but there
were long intervals of silence during the progress of the
game.</p>

<p>Presently Broome began to fidget, and from time to time he
lifted his eyes from his book and turned them round frowningly in
the direction of the door and windows.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Colonel Jasper presently, noticing his
restlessness. "Hear any of those spooks you were telling the
doctor about to-day?"</p>

<p>Broome looked at him with contempt. "There's been someone
tapping on the door for quite 10 minutes," he replied coldly,
"and he's been scraping on the windows as well."</p>

<p>Sarle rose up in a fury. "You damned fool," he cried, "why the
hell didn't you say so before?"</p>

<p>"You have ears as well as I have, haven't you?" replied
Broome, and he turned again to his book.</p>

<p>Sarle strode to the door, and opening it against the wind, let
in a man who had his cap drawn low down upon his face, and his
overcoat buttoned up tightly to his chin.</p>

<p>"Thought you were all dead," growled the newcomer irritably,
"but I saw the light above the curtain there."</p>

<p>"We didn't hear you," said Sarle apologetically. "The wind
makes such a damned noise." He pointed to a chair. "Sit down and
have a drink."</p>

<p>The man sat down as directed, and drained in one breath the
stiff tumbler of whisky that was handed to him.</p>

<p>He was a big, coarse-looking man with a big bullet head set
upon his shoulders, with a very short neck. He had a large square
nose and a strong massive jaw, and the expression of his face
generally was that of some fighting animal whom it would be
difficult to frighten and quite impossible to tame. From the
lines about his eyes they seemed to be set in one continual
frown.</p>

<p>Sarle looked at him curiously. "How did you come down?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Bicycled from Harwich," was the brusque reply. "Hid my bike
in the marsh and crossed over the causeway on foot." He glanced
round at the curtained windows. "No good anybody making
themselves conspicuous at these times. You never know who may be
on the look-out now. There's a hell of a stir now among the
police."</p>

<p>"Well," asked Sarle frowningly as the man had subsided into
silence, "any news, Bull?"</p>

<p>"Yes," grunted the man, "I want &pound;200 off you." He looked
significantly at Sarle. "Tilley and his wife had bad luck. They
both got drowned last night."</p>

<p>"Ah!" commented Sarle, and his face brightened. "How did you
manage it?"</p>

<p>"Took 'em down to Limehouse," replied Bull carelessly. "Said
there was some stuff we could pinch off a barge there. Got them
in a boat. Thick fog. Upset the boat as I pretended to get in.
Had to hit Mother Tilley over the head with the oar, but Tilley
was damned drunk and drowned himself. Both went under, hardly any
noise, and all over in two minutes."</p>

<p>"But how do you know they are actually dead?" frowned
Sarle.</p>

<p>"Must have been," replied Bull with emphasis. "They couldn't
swim. I stunned the woman, I tell you, and Tilley was drunk.
Besides, neither of them had returned home by this afternoon. I
went round there specially to see, and found the neighbors were
looking after the children." He spat vigorously into the fire.
"Yes, the brats are orphans now."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper made a sharp expression of disgust, and then
without a word got up and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>Bull looked contemptuous. "I'd have wrung the kids' necks too,
for another tenner," he said. "It wouldn't have worried me." A
thought seemed to strike him suddenly, and tugging a newspaper
out of his pocket he handed it across to Sarle.</p>

<p>"Seven rewards offered," he remarked gruffly, "and each of
them for a thousand pounds. Five of them are for our jobs." He
looked sharply at him. "And that affair at Epping was yours,
wasn't it?" He grunted at Sarle's nod. "Well, I guessed so."</p>

<p>A long silence followed. Sarle was engrossed with the
newspaper, Edgehill stared stonily into the fire as if he were
not inclined to be too intimate with the visitor and Broome's
eyes were glued upon his book. Apparently the latter was most
catholic in his tastes for he was now perusing Drummond's
'Natural Law in the Spiritual World.'</p>

<p>Presently Bull spoke and he addressed himself quietly to
Edgehill&mdash;</p>

<p>"What about that Jew in Stratford?" he asked in a hoarse
whisper and he jerked his thumb in the direction of Sarle. "Was
that the gov'nor, too?"</p>

<p>"What Jew?" replied Edgehill without interest and yawning as
if he were sleepy.</p>

<p>"Bah!" said Bull snapping his massive jaws together, "then if
you answer like that&mdash;it was the gov'nor." He laughed
sneeringly. "Just as if you wouldn't have read every line about
the old Jew. You can't shut me in the dark."</p>

<p>Sarle looked up suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You read what was in the 'Daily Microphone,' Bull," he asked
sharply, "after I'd been to Epping that day?"</p>

<p>"My oath, yes," replied Bull, "every damn word, and that's why
I thought it was you." He ticked off on his fingers. "Dark
eyes&mdash;sallow skin. Trilby hat, Jehu car. It fitted in
exactly. Every word that married couple said, and&mdash;&mdash;"
he added significantly, "it would be awkward," he said slowly,
"if they got the chance to identify me, and&mdash;&mdash;" he
added significantly, "it might be bad for us all."</p>

<p>"Damned bad," agreed Bull. "If the police get you, they'll be
nosy about all of us. Anyone who's had anything to do with you,
anyone who's spoken to you, anyone who's seen you, almost." He
leant back in his chair and growled. "It won't be healthy for any
of us."</p>

<p>Sarle reached down for a writing pad that was on the
mantelshelf and then took a pencil out of his pocket.</p>

<p>"I'll draw you," he said slowly, "the exact position on the
London road of the place where the couple live." He looked
straight at Bull. "It's a very lonely house."</p>

<p>Bull frowned harder than ever. "Oh! you mean that, do you?" he
said, blinking his eyes. "Well, it'll be very risky and I shall
want more than &pound;200 this time."</p>

<p>"What are the couple like?" asked Bull presently. "What sort
of chap is the man?"</p>

<p>"Small and weak," assured Sarle, "and the girl can't be over
twenty. Neither will put up a fight. You should have no trouble
at all. You could shoot through one of the windows away from the
road. As far as I remember, the forest comes right up to the back
of the house. I'll lend you an automatic, and close up you can't
miss."</p>

<p>Bull shook his head. "No, no," he said, sharply; "I never
carry a gun. It's dangerous and makes too much damned noise. I do
my jobs in a quieter way." He looked thoughtful. "Probably I'll
club them and then burn down the house."</p>

<p>They talked on for some time, and then Bull, looking at the
clock, rose up to go. The wind was still blowing hard, and as he
buttoned up his coat he glanced apprehensively at the curtains
swaying before the windows.</p>

<p>"I shall have a devilish ride back to Harwich," he said. "The
wind'll be dead against me the whole way." He turned to Sarle.
"Well, I'll be back here in a couple of days or so. If it's got
to be done, then the quicker the better. Keep an eye on the
newspapers." And with a curt nod to Edgehill he walked to the
door.</p>

<p>Sarle went with him to let him out, and then, closing and
bolting the door behind him, returned to his armchair and sank
back into it without remark.</p>

<p>Silence then again prevailed in the hall, with Sarle staring
meditatively into the fire, Edgehill lying back with closed eyes,
as if he were asleep, and Broome reading assiduously on. And
outside, the wind continued to sweep thunderously round the
building, and the roar of the sea came up across the marshes like
some wolf mother calling to her cubs.</p>

<p>Suddenly, then, Broome started, and his book fell with a loud
thud upon the floor. His mouth gaped, and with a tense expression
on his face he sat bolt upright&mdash;listening.</p>

<p>Sarle looked round angrily.</p>

<p>"And what the hell's the matter with you now?" he sneered.
"Has another ghost bitten you?"</p>

<p>"I heard something," replied Broome, with dignity; "something
outside."</p>

<p>"And so did everybody, you damn fool!" said Sarle. "The wind's
loud enough to wake the dead."</p>

<p>Broome picked up his book. "But it wasn't only the wind I
heard," he remarked quietly, and then, with a shrug of his
shoulders, he resumed his reading.</p>

<p>"He gets on my nerves," Sarle muttered to Edgehill, "I shall
speak to Shillington to-morrow and see if he can't take him
away."</p>

<p>But the next afternoon, upon his arrival at the Priory, the
doctor altogether pooh-poohed the idea. "He's not bad enough for
that yet," he said; "and I could never get another practitioner
to certify him with me. Besides&mdash;&mdash;" and he looked
curiously at Sarle&mdash;"he's quite inoffensive and won't do
anybody any harm."</p>

<p>"But he annoys me," insisted Sarle, "and I've got sick of the
sight of him."</p>

<p>"We've all got the jumps here," remarked Colonel Jasper
gloomily; "and old Broome happens to be the scapegoat just now."
He smiled whimsically. "But if it really came to the point, I'm
sure we should all be sorry to lose him; he's such a darned good
cook."</p>

<p>"Ah! That reminds me," exclaimed the doctor genially; "I've
got a dish of mushrooms for you in the car. They are all cleaned
and peeled, ready for cooking, too. I had them given to me but
I've got some faint gastric disturbance and daren't think of
touching mushrooms to-day."</p>

<p>"Many thanks to you doctor," replied the colonel heartily.
"We're all fond of mushrooms, and we'll have them this evening.
Broome, Broome," he called out and he grinned round at the
others. "Here's another job for you. Mushrooms, this evening for
tea."</p>

<p>Broome appeared in the hall and took the dish that the doctor
in the meantime had brought out from the car. The dish was tied
round with a linen cloth and placing it upon the table, Broome
nonchalantly started to unwrap it.</p>

<p>But the doctor thrust himself forward. "Don't uncover them,
man," he exclaimed hastily. "Keep the air from them to the last
moment until you're actually ready to start cooking them. They're
peeled, you understand, and they'll go stale now, directly they
are exposed to the air. Stew them in milk, I should. Tip them in
a saucepan two hours before you want them and let them simmer
slowly. Don't boil them. Then serve them in the milk just as they
are."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper laughed. "And fancy telling Broome that! Why,
he's as good as a chef any day and a real artist in cooking
mushrooms anyhow."</p>

<p>Broome looked scornfully at the doctor, and whisking up the
dish, disappeared in the direction of the kitchen.</p>

<p>The doctor chatted amiably for a few minutes and then took his
leave.</p>

<p>"And he annoys me too, now," said Sarle, looking frowningly
after the departing car. "What the devil's made him so polite
lately. Butter wouldn't have melted in his mouth this afternoon,
and yet, generally, he's such a boor."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper frowned too. "He seemed nervous to me," he said
thoughtfully, "as if he'd got something on his mind."</p>

<p>"And why wouldn't he hear of taking Broome now?" went on
Sarle. "He's changed right around from what he was the other day.
Then, he said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Edgehill stood up and stretched himself. "Oh! damn you both,"
he interrupted rudely. "You're getting like a couple of old women
with your ideas. I saw nothing funny about Shillington this
afternoon except that he was a good sort to bring those mushrooms
down. As for Broome, I can't see why you want to get rid or him.
He's darned useful and interferes with nobody."</p>

<p>"But he may become a danger to us," said Sarle, "and I look
ahead."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Edgehill, "talking about danger. I wonder what
Bull's been doing to-day. He might be back with news, even to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sarle, his mind turning instantly upon the new
train of thought. "To-night or to-morrow, we shan't have to wait
long. Everything may have happened to-day."</p>

<p>And Sarle was not the only one who was expectant of unusual
happenings that day.</p>

<p>That night at nine o'clock Dr. Shillington was sitting again
in his study, and although the room was warm and cosy, there were
beads of cold perspiration upon his face. He imagined that he was
smoking, but the cigar had gone out and he was chewing viciously
at a cold butt.</p>

<p>He looked up at the clock.</p>

<p>"Three hours," he muttered hoarsely, "then&mdash;they are all
dead. There were enough amanita among the other ones to ensure
that they would all get a lethal dose." He counted with his
fingers. "They would have started their tea at six, they are
always very punctual. Sarle sees to that, and then within an
hour&mdash;by seven," he took out his handkerchief and mopped
over his face, "the symptoms would commence." His hands shook and
his mouth was very dry. "Yes, they are all dead, and it would be
Jasper who would have died first. He could have stood very little
in his condition, and the end would have come very soon. Then
Edgehill would go next. He was strong and muscular, but his
resistance to the toxins would be bad. Then Broome. He would not
complain much, but his self-repression would take it out of him
and his heart would fail the quicker. Sarle would be the last.
Yes, Sarle was wiry, and he would fight and struggle to the last.
I can see how he would look. His face would be drawn up horribly,
his eyes would blaze, his forehead&mdash;&mdash;" But the doctor
made a gesture of repugnance and abruptly closed his
meditations.</p>

<p>He rose up from his chair, and for a long while paced
restlessly up and down; then hearing the clock strike ten and
almost immediately after, the maids go upstairs to bed, he waited
a few minutes and crept up to his former butler's room.</p>

<p>There he stood in the darkness, straining his eyes across the
marshes towards where the house on the island stood. He could
just see the house as a faint blur against the background of the
sea, but there were no lights in any of the windows, and all was
still and silent as the grave.</p>

<p>"And a grave it is," he muttered, as he turned away, "for if
the old woman didn't have any of the mushrooms herself she has,
nevertheless, almost certainly died of shock. She was fond of
Jasper, I know."</p>

<p>He put himself to bed about an hour later, but found it
impossible to sleep. Then just before midnight, he looked at his
watch&mdash;he thought he heard the faint sounds of gunshots, two
in quick succession, from the direction of the island. He was up
and out of bed in an instant, and creeping upstairs again to the
butler's room. But then as before he saw nothing unusual, except
that now a hazy moon had risen, and the outline of the Priory was
more distinct.</p>

<p>He stood listening for quite ten minutes, but there was no
repetition of the sounds, and once again he put himself to
bed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Sarle may be lingering on," was his thought, "and he
fired those two shots to bring him help. The poison may take
longer to kill than Voronoff said." He shook his head. "But he'll
be dead before morning comes in, anyhow."</p>

<p>It was hours before he sank off to sleep, and then only after
he had given himself an hypnotic. Then he slept heavily, and it
was the parlor-maid who awoke him by tapping on the door at 8
o'clock.</p>

<p>"Damn," he swore angrily, "and I meant to have gone up and
looked to make sure that there were none of them about. Now, when
shall I know exactly what has happened?"</p>

<p>He thought of what must be his next move whilst he was
dressing, and he was still thinking about it as he made the
pretence of eating his breakfast.</p>

<p>"Now I must be very careful," he told himself, frowning, "for
those fellows from Scotland Yard will be down again, and there
must be nothing to bring me in, in the remotest way. No, I must
find out nothing, myself. I must learn everything from
outsiders."</p>

<p>He had just finished his meal when he saw the butcher's cart
go by the window, and half a minute later the parlor-maid came
in.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," she said, "may Mr. Harkness speak to
you. He says he's got a message for you from the island."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington's heart beat wildly, but he drew in his
features to the expression of a mask.</p>

<p>"Show him in then," he replied curtly.</p>

<p>Some dreadful moments for the doctor followed, and with a
mighty effort only, was he able to assume an appearance of
equanimity.</p>

<p>Smithers ushered the village butcher in. He had a round
smiling face, and he touched his forehead respectfully when he
saw the doctor. He was carrying two wild ducks.</p>

<p>"I've just come from the Priory, sir," he said. "Mr.
Edgehill's compliments, and he's sent you these ducks. He shot
them last night on the marshes. He told me to give them to you
himself, and say they're a return for the mushrooms which they
enjoyed very much."</p>

<p>Dr Shillington's face was the picture of incredulity and
amazement.</p>

<p>In the meantime, all unconscious of the bomb that the butcher
had thrown at the doctor's feet, the inmates of the Priory were
going about their usual daily occupations.</p>

<p>They had breakfasted early as was their wont, and then Broome
had been dispatched to go and get some fish, for in spite of his
superior ways, he was undoubtedly the best fisherman of the
party, possessing as he did an almost uncanny sense of
determining the exact places where the fish would bite.</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper, who had sent him off, expected him to be away
at least an hour, but he was back in less than ten minutes, and
appeared in the living room where Sarle, Edgehill and the colonel
were talking together. They saw that he was carrying a pair of
boots.</p>

<p>"And what's up with you now," called out Sarle angrily, "and
where are those damned fish you were sent for?"</p>

<p>Broome ignored the question. "Bull's come back," he said
quietly. "He's on the sands now by the black rocks."</p>

<p>Sarle snapped his jaws together. "And why the hell then
doesn't he come in?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He can't," replied Broome, "he's been shot in the head."</p>

<p>Sarle flared up in a fury, and springing forward, shook his
fist in Broome's face.</p>

<p>"You're lying," he shouted. "It's another of your damned
lies."</p>

<p>"It isn't," said Broome stoutly. "I've got his boots on. I
thought they'd fit me, but&mdash;&mdash;" and he looked down at
his feet. "I find they're too big."</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; THE BRAINS OF SCOTLAND YARD.</h2>

<p class="first">THREE days later, and in the morning, early, the
Chief Commissioner of Police received an important visitor in the
person of the Secretary of State for Home Affairs. He was a
dapper looking little man with a pleasant smile, and he wagged
his finger playfully at the Chief Commissioner as he came in.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said laughing, "I have not come to order you to
instant execution, but I have had notice of a question that is
going to be asked in the House tonight, and I want to be in the
position of being able to say that I've been in communication
with you personally."</p>

<p>"Very pleased to see you," replied the Chief Commissioner,
smiling. "I'm always at your service, as you know."</p>

<p>"Of course it's about these murders that I've come," said the
Home Secretary, and the smile dropped on his face. He hesitated
just a moment. "I want to be able to assure the House that all
that is possible is being done, and that you are not insensible
to the uneasiness of the public generally."</p>

<p>"Quite so," replied the Commissioner, and his voice hardened
coldly, "and you can assure them that with perfect truth."</p>

<p>"You see," went on the Home Secretary, and there was apology
in his tone, "the public are very disturbed at the immunity these
wretches are enjoying, and there is a feeling among the ignorant
and unthinking that there is bad management somewhere that
something should not have been found out by now. Of course," he
added quickly, for he saw a frown deepening upon the face of the
Commissioner, "they don't understand the difficulties under which
you gentlemen labor."</p>

<p>"No, they certainly don't," replied the Commissioner shortly,
"England is a big country to hunt about in, and when a crime has
been committed the perpetrators of it unkindly omit to leave
their names and addresses. We police have to find out everything
for ourselves."</p>

<p>"But six months is a long time," said the Home Secretary, his
face reddening a little, for he did not quite like the tone of
the Commissioner's voice.</p>

<p>"A very short time," corrected the Commissioner coldly, "when
we are faced with such an organisation as these men possess."</p>

<p>"But what am I to say tonight?" asked the Home Secretary
rather irritably. "What could I tell the House?"</p>

<p>"You could tell them, sir," replied the Commissioner slowly,
and his voice was even and emotionless, "you could tell them that
we know who the criminals are."</p>

<p>"What!" exploded the high official, and he almost bounced out
of his chair. "I can tell them you know who they are." He rose to
his feet in his excitement. "Then you've arrested them just
now?"</p>

<p>The Commissioner waved him back. "Not at all," he said
quietly. "Not at all. They're still quite free and undisturbed
and living the lives of respectable country gentlemen. They golf
and go fishing and play tennis, and to all appearances have the
best of everything to eat and drink."</p>

<p>The dapper-looking little man sank back into his chair. It was
his face that had hardened now, and he looked all at once the
fighting animal that had won a half score of fiercely contested
elections and forced its way by sheer grit on to the Treasury
Bench.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand you," he said curtly. "Please
explain."</p>

<p>"I said you could tell the House," smiled the Commissioner
pleasantly, "but, of course, you won't, for what I am disclosing
is for your private satisfaction alone, and if the slightest
inkling of it leaked out&mdash;&mdash;" he shrugged his
shoulders, "all our grip of the situation would be gone."</p>

<p>"But you actually know them?" gasped the Home Secretary. "You
know the gang of the Iron Man?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the Commissioner, "four of them are living in an
old Priory on an island just off the Essex Coast, about ten miles
from Colchester, and it is from there that they have made their
raids. We know for certain it is they."</p>

<p>"And why haven't you arrested them then," commented the
Cabinet Minister quickly.</p>

<p>"All in good time, Mr. Mortlock," said the Commissioner,
completely at his ease. "We are not quite ready yet." He smiled
confidently. "You must understand that, although we are quite
sure it is they, yet up to the present moment the only evidence
we have against them is all purely circumstantial, and we cannot
act until we obtain direct convincing proof."</p>

<p>"And in the meantime," exclaimed the Minister, disgustedly,
"they may get away."</p>

<p>The Commissioner shook his head. '"No, no," he said
emphatically. "We are sure about that." There was a grim look
upon his face. "Not a rat could leave that island now without
being seen, not a bird, almost, fly over it without being marked
down, and certainly not a man or woman could pass on to the
mainland without being intercepted directly they were out of
sight of the island itself."</p>

<p>"But do these men then know they are being watched?" asked the
bewildered Home Secretary.</p>

<p>The Commissioner frowned thoughtfully. "We are not quite sure
about that," he replied, "and that's why we have to be so
careful." His face brightened. "But at any rate we are certain
that they can have no idea how much we have found out. They are
entirely in the dark, for instance, that we know them to be the
gang of the Iron Man."</p>

<p>"And these last murders were theirs?" gasped the Home
Secretary again. "All three of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all three," replied the Commissioner gravely. "The men
they killed knew more about them than was safe, and they struck
in consequence, to close their mouths. They found out we were
moving, and they left nothing to chance." He sighed and added
very slowly, "Only the dead do not speak."</p>

<p>"But, good God!" exclaimed the perspiring Cabinet Minister,
"are there really monsters about like that?"</p>

<p>"Plenty, in the underworlds of all great cities," smiled the
Commissioner, "and it requires only some particular combination
of circumstances to bring them out." He lifted up the receiver of
the telephone upon his desk. "But just wait a moment. You may be
able to learn at first hand something of how we poor incompetent
police go about our work, and what we have discovered in these
present cases." He spoke into the receiver. "Are either Mr.
Carter or Mr. Stone in the Yard, do you know, please? Oh! only
Mr. Stone, then put me through, please." A moment's silence
followed, and then he spoke again. "Chief speaking. I have a
visitor here&mdash;Mr. Mortlock, the Secretary of State for Home
Affairs. He would like to have a word with you, please. Bring the
dossiers of the Isaacstein, the Dr. Logan and the Fred Duke
cases. Yes, at once, please," and he hung up the receiver with a
humorous smile upon his face.</p>

<p>"Now you're going to have a treat, Mr. Mortlock," he said.
"Our Mr. Stone is not only one of the ablest detective officers
we have, but he is a fine racounteur as well, and with a great
sense of the dramatic. He is in part charge of all these cases
and everything about them has passed through his hands." His face
was mildly amused. "Yes, you will learn now about what we police
have to do."</p>

<p>A minute later and Stone entered the room. He was carrying a
thick portfolio, and he bowed gravely to the Home Secretary when
he was introduced.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the Chief Commissioner, and when the big man
had pulled forward a chair, he went on quietly:&mdash;"Now, Mr.
Stone, the position is like this. Tonight, Mr. Mortlock is going
to be interrogated in the House regarding the many outrages and
homicidal acts that have occurred lately, and the immunity that
their perpetrators are still enjoying. He maintains that the
public are becoming very restless, that what is popularly known
as the gang of the Iron Man have not been apprehended, and he
puts it to me very delicately and very nicely, and indeed without
actually mentioning it, that if this condition of things
continues much longer, he fears there will be such an outcry of
public opinion that a change in the personnel of the Yard here,
must inevitably follow."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Sir Francis," broke in the Home Secretary, getting
red; "I didn't exactly say that at all, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it was in your mind, Mr. Mortlock," smiled the Chief
Commissioner good humoredly, "for no doubt you yourself, to some
extent, share in the general idea of our incompetence." He turned
again to the big detective. "So now, Mr. Mortlock has come direct
to me in the hope that I may be able to tell him of some real
progress we are making, so that tonight he may be able to assure
his interrogator truthfully that we are not standing still but
are getting a grip of the situation, unsatisfactory although
everything may appear to outsiders."</p>

<p>"But," glared Stone, and he unconsciously hugged the thick
portfolio closely to his chest, "not a whisper of what's here
must get out or all our work will be lost. We are not prepared
yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! don't think about that for a moment sir," interrupted the
Home Secretary hurriedly. "Whatever you tell me will not pass to
anyone, you may be perfectly sure of that." He suddenly drew up
his small body to a pose of importance and authority, and smiled
with quiet dignity. "If what I hear from you in any way detracts
from my uneasiness, then I shall send at once privately for the
member who is asking the question and suggest to him, in the
interest of the public generally, that he postpone his
interrogation until it will do no harm. He is quite a sensible
fellow, and will do what I ask at once, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Very good, then," said Stone solemnly. He turned to the Chief
Commissioner. "But where am I to begin, sir?"</p>

<p>"I have told Mr. Mortlock," said the Commissioner, "that we
know who the gang of the Iron Man are, and where they are living,
but that we are unwilling to strike yet, because we lack certain
material evidence that will carry conviction in a court of law."
He nodded his head. "Yes, I have spoken to him quite openly, so
you can go straight ahead and withhold nothing,"&mdash;he
hesitated just a moment&mdash;"except, of course, names." He went
on quickly. "But it's about these last three outrages
particularly that I have called you in. I want Mr. Home Secretary
to learn something of police methods and the difficulties of our
work." He smiled. "Take your time, Mr. Stone, and tell the story
in your own way."</p>

<p>"I am a shipowner, you see, Mr. Stone," smiled the Home
Secretary, he shrugged his shoulders, "and quite an innocent
where you gentlemen of the police are concerned."</p>

<p>The big detective eyed him solemnly. "Well, it's quite an
interesting story, I can tell you, sir," he began in his rich,
deep voice, "and it is certainly as involved a one as we have
ever had here before us at the Yard." He put his portfolio down
upon the table before him. "But, to begin with, as far as these
three last murders are concerned, you must first postulate four
miscreants of the gang of the Iron Man living on a lonely island
just off the coast of Essex and another malefactor, the fifth,
living close by. For six months and more, as you are aware, these
men have been ravaging the countryside, and so clever have been
their methods and so well arranged their organisation, that with
all the resources at our command, until a couple of weeks or so
ago we could not pick up one single clue. On no occasion have
they left the ghost of a trail behind them. Then, thanks to the
self-sacrifice of a comrade,"&mdash;his voice vibrated here just
a little&mdash;"who paid for his temerity with his life, we at
last got upon their track and got upon it, too, without them
knowing we are after them."</p>

<p>He nodded his head emphatically. "Yes, they are not aware that
we know them to be the gang of the Iron Man, and they can have no
idea that we are identifying them with the outrages committed at
those country houses in Essex and the other two eastern counties.
They do know, however, that we are interested in them, but they
believe only in connection with that murder of Dr. Shillington's
butler at Oakley Court, and there, as these four on the island
had nothing whatever to do with it,"&mdash;he smiled
enigmatically&mdash;"They know they are quite safe. But eight or
nine days ago they guessed we should be enquiring about them, and
alive at once to where our enquiries might possibly lead us, they
instantly took measures to silence certain persons who could
possibly furnish incriminating facts about them in other ways.
Those big rewards and the free pardon that you offered frightened
them, too, and so at once the reign of the knife and the bludgeon
began."</p>

<p>"But if you were watching them." interrupted the Home
Secretary, "how could they get away to do these things?"</p>

<p>"They were just a few hours ahead of us," replied the
detective sadly, "and they struck before we were on guard. They
had the advantage of knowing we had picked up the beginning of
their trail before we knew that trail was going to lead us to
them."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then Stone went
on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, a week ago yesterday we were called, one after another,
within a few hours, to those last three murders, and from the
places where they were committed and from other things as well we
knew practically at once that they were the work of the same
gang. Abe Isaacstein, the pawnbroker, was killed at Stratford,
Essex, Dr. Logan in Epping, and the painter, Fred Duke, in
Colchester."</p>

<p>He took a sheaf of papers from the portfolio. "We will take
the case of the pawnbroker first, and if I tell you things which,
of course, you already know, you will understand that I only do
so in order to make my general statement the more clear. The
public are so often told things that are not true. Now, Abe
Isaacstein was a jeweller and pawnbroker in a good way of
business on Stratford Broadway. He kept three assistants, all of
whom had been with him over a number of years. The head one,
Thomas Bloxham, is an ex-pugilist, and was undoubtedly engaged on
account of his fighting ability, for Stratford Broadway is a
rough place at times. All of these men had a real affection for
their master, for he had all along been most considerate and
generous in his treatment of them. There is no doubt as to their
genuine horror at what happened. Well, last Tuesday week just
about half-past eleven, a man came into Isaacstein's shop, and,
going straight up to him, he was standing near the door at the
time, said a few words very quietly. The pawnbroker evidently
knew the man, for without replying, he nodded, and at once led
the way into his private office at the back of the shop, and the
door closed behind them.</p>

<p>"Then nothing happened, Bloxham says, for quite half an hour,
until another visitor arrived to see the pawnbroker.</p>

<p>"Bloxham went at once to acquaint his master and knocked
loudly at the door. I must here explain that there are two doors
to the office, the outer one is just an ordinary wooden door, but
the inner one is thickly padded over with felt, making the
office, as far as ordinary speaking voices are concerned,
practically soundproof. Well, Bloxham knocked loudly on the outer
door, but waiting for longer than a minute and getting no answer,
he suddenly became uneasy and so, opening it without more ado,
and the other door as well, he burst into the private room. He
found his master murdered, one of the windows open, and the
visitor gone. Our men were quickly on the scene and the
investigations began." The detective shrugged his shoulders and
pursed up his lips. "But there was at first sight absolutely
nothing to tell us who the assassin was or why the murder had
been done. Nothing had apparently been taken, nothing had been
disarranged. The pawnbroker had simply been murdered, and that
was all."</p>

<p>"He had been stabbed in the neck, a ghastly circular gash that
had severed the main vessels, and the assault had all signs of
having been of so furious a nature that the victim had probably
never cried out. As I say, the murderer had apparently taken
nothing, but his work accomplished, he had dropped out of the
window into a small yard, and scaling a low wall there, had
escaped along a back street. There were no finger marks anywhere,
and the weapon used had not been left behind."</p>

<p>"Dreadful!" commented the Home Secretary, "dreadful!"</p>

<p>The detective went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"We got a good description of the assassin from Bloxham, the
only one, apparently, of the assistants who had particularly
noticed him. He described him as being dark, of medium height, of
slight build, wearing a cap and colored glasses, rather shabbily
dressed and looking as if he were a working man."</p>

<p>"As far as all outward appearances went, as I say, we could
see no motive for the crime and indeed according to all report,
Isaacstein was by no means the type of man one would associate
with such a grim tragedy of such a mysterious kind. Of excellent
reputation, he had been in business there on the Broadway for
more than twenty years, was respected by all who knew him and was
noted for the honest and straightforward nature of his dealings.
The local police spoke highly of him and upon several occasions
when stolen articles had been pledged with him, he had gone out
of his way to give them all the assistance that he possibly
could."</p>

<p>"To our surprise, however, we found that his private life was
an unknown quantity to everybody, even to his assistants who had
been with him for all those years. He was a most reserved and
secretive man and they knew nothing at all as to what he did or
where he went after business hours."</p>

<p>"He did not live on the premises for all the rooms were used
in the business, but where his home was, they had no idea. They
left him in the shop every evening when they had put up the
shutters a few minutes after six o'clock and they found him
waiting for them every morning when they came to work at half
past eight. The place was particularly well protected against
burglars, it is not a hundred yards distant, by-the-bye, from the
police station, there are burglar alarms fixed everywhere, and
there are massive steel shutters to all the windows and the
doors."</p>

<p>Stone paused again and then a slow smile crossed into his
face.</p>

<p>"Well, as I have told you," he went on, "directly we heard of
this outrage we put it down at once to the gang of the Iron Man,
but I must admit that when we went down, personally to
investigate, my colleague Mr. Carter and I, we did not at first
see how things fitted in. A respectable tradesman, there was
nothing on the surface to associate him in any way with
wrongdoing of any kind. Yes, we police were stumped again." He
looked humorously at the Home Secretary.</p>

<p>"But in a little while we began to have doubts about this
Isaacstein. Those double doors were peculiar. There was no
necessity for them that we could see, and the inner one was so
padded with thick layers of felt that as I say, as far as voices
were concerned it made his office quite sound-proof. Such secrecy
in our opinion did not suggest above-board and honest
transactions. Then there was a stout bolt on this inner door too,
we noticed, that could be operated from a wire under the desk. It
could be operated either way when Isaacstein was seated at his
desk and ensured when he do wished it, that no one could break in
upon his privacy."</p>

<p>"Then, the position of one of the chairs made us think a bit,
and the fact that its legs were clamped down on to the floor so
that it could not be moved. It was slightly to one side of the
desk where Isaacstein was accustomed to sit, and whoever would be
occupying it would be in the strong clear light of a window
above. Just where we would place a man, we thought, if we were to
take his photograph."</p>

<p>"And then we examined a row of books above the desk and found,
as we were half-expecting, that one was no book at all, but
simply a camouflaged camera. And the ball that operated the
shutter had been carried down until it was just under the knee-hole of the desk, so Isaacstein had only to squeeze it quickly at
the right moment and then the camera above would give him a
photograph of whoever at that moment was sitting in the chair.
The camera was fully loaded when we found it."</p>

<p>"Then we cross-examined the assistants again, especially the
pugilistic-looking one, and we wrung from him reluctantly that
his master did, from time to time, receive visitors in his
private office about whose business, he, the assistant, knew
nothing. He would not, however, admit the possibility of anything
unlawful in the visits, for his master, he averred, was always so
scrupulously straight-forward in all his dealings with everyone
that it was unthinkable that he could be connected with anything
dishonest in any way.</p>

<p>"His own idea was that Isaacstein, who was of Russian
extraction, was secretly helping political refugees, and we left
it at that because it was obvious that Bloxham was not an
individual of very keen intelligence, and besides, had no
imagination at all.</p>

<p>"But we badly wanted the photographs we knew the pawnbroker
had been taking, and after a long search we found them. They were
in a cunningly-contrived secret drawer at the bottom of his desk,
and there were thirty-four of them."</p>

<p>Stone stopped speaking, and began turning over the pages of
the portfolio before him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on after a moment, "there were thirty-four of
them, and some of them are quite good snaps as you shall see.
Twenty-three of the gentlemen they portray have not been
recognised by any of us up to now, but eleven of them we know
quite well, and no less than five of them, at the present
time&mdash;&mdash;" he paused a long moment, "are undergoing
penal servitude in various of his Majesty's prisons."</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the excited Home Secretary, "then this
pawnbroker was a member of the gang, himself."</p>

<p>Stone shook his head. "No, I don't think so," he said. He
thumped his fist upon the table. "But he was the most
enterprising receiver of stolen goods in the kingdom, and we have
been looking for him for years."</p>

<p>The Home Secretary mopped his face with his pocket
handkerchief, and Stone went on.</p>

<p>"We showed the photographs to the assistant, Bloxham, and he
at once picked out one of them, although, unfortunately, it is
not a very clear one, as that of the man whom his master had
taken into his office just before he had been killed. One of the
other assistants, too, says he remembers the face as that of a
visitor who had called upon at least two occasions previously,
the last time, he thought, being about a month ago. Upon the back
of the photograph was pencilled in Isaacstein's handwriting the
name 'White,' with a note of interrogation, however, after
it."</p>

<p>"Very interesting," commented the Home Secretary. "Most
interesting, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Well," went on Stone, "we were convinced then that Isaacstein
had been a fence in a big way, but, search as we did, there was
not the very slightest trace of evidence to support that
conviction. Every piece of jewellery we found on the premises had
its perfectly recorded history, was numbered and ticketed, and
the date of its purchase or pledging put down in the ledgers, in
black and white. Naturally, then, we were of the opinion that the
proceeds of the illicit side of his business would be cached in
his private residence, and we at once took energetic steps to
find where that residence was."</p>

<p>The detective smiled grimly at the Cabinet Minister.</p>

<p>"And then here, sir," he said, "we were faced with one or
those ordinary easy problems with which we poor, unthinking
police have so often to grapple. With apparently nothing to help
us, we had yet to find out which particular one among the hundred
thousand and more houses in the surrounding districts of
Stratford Broadway sheltered the private life of the pawnbroker
Isaacstein and&mdash;&mdash;" he took and lighted a cigarette
from the case that the Chief Commissioner held out to
him&mdash;"we found it within eight and forty hours."</p>

<p>The Home Secretary made a wry face.</p>

<p>"Don't rub it in, Mr. Stone," he said. "I don't insist on your
incompetence, remember. I'm not the general public. How did you
find it now?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Stone, "the position seemed very hopeless at
first. Stratford Broadway, surrounded by densely populated
districts, is one of the busiest traffic centres to be found
anywhere in the kingdom. Five lines of tramway converge there,
and hundreds of motor buses pass every hour, so Isaacstein had
every facility for getting away in any direction he might choose;
and we agreed, too, that he would live quite a distance away from
Stratford in order that in the vicinity of his private residence
he would minimise the chances of his being recognised by any of
the people who had dealings with him on the Broadway. So we
realised we must set about enquiring from all the tramcar and
motor bus conductors, most methodically.</p>

<p>"But first we must have a photo of Isaacstein to show them,
and we set out to prepare one at once.</p>

<p>"We propped up the body of the dead man, we took off his
spectacles&mdash;they were only of plain dark glass, and although
he was never seen for one moment without them in Stratford, they
were obviously of no service to him, except as a help to a
disguise; we washed the blood off his face, and then we pigmented
him up generally to the color of a living man, painting in new
eyes upon the eyelids that were closed. Then we took out the set
of false teeth that he was wearing and inserted a second set that
we found in the bag that from its other contents, he was
apparently in the habit of carrying daily to and fro. The teeth
in these plates were much more prominent and would, we saw,
entirely alter the shape of his mouth. Then we put on his hat and
as I say, took a photograph of him."</p>

<p>"Good God!" ejaculated the Home Secretary for the fourth time,
"what a horrible performance."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was unpleasant," remarked Stone carelessly, "but then
we often have to do unpleasant things. Well, we got a number of
these photos printed and within a couple of hours or so, had
nearly a score of our men interviewing every tramcar and motorbus
conductor who passed through the Broadway. But all that day we
had no success. No conductor from citywards or from Ilford, or
Leyton, or Leytonstone, or Upton Park recognised the photographs
as being that of a man who was in the habit of riding with him.
But we were not disheartened and at once began trying the tram
and bus routes farther away, the routes I mean that did not touch
Stratford at all. And almost immediately we were rewarded. A tram
conductor on the Barking-Aldgate service recognised the
photograph as that of a passenger he was in the habit of picking
up every morning at 7.25 at the first stop, about 250 yards from
the Barking terminus and whom he always dropped later, at the
corner of Greet-street, Upton Park. Then, we saw the cunning of
the man. He never touched any public conveyance until he was well
over a mile and a half from the Broadway. Well, the rest was
easy. The tram conductor said the man was carrying a newspaper
every morning, and at the first paper shop we enquired at, the
photograph was recognised again. It was that of a Mr. Heber we
were told, a commercial traveller, and his house was pointed out
down the street."</p>

<p>"We knocked at the door and were received by a middle-aged
woman who announced herself as the housekeeper. She was
tremendously shocked when she learnt who we were, and what our
mission was. Her emotion was quite genuine, and we were soon
assured that like the newsagent, she genuinely believed her
master to be Mr. Solomon Heber and a commercial traveller who
worked for a firm of tea merchants in the city. She had been with
him for about four years."</p>

<p>"We then proceeded to search the house and were very
disappointed. It was just an ordinary modern house, comfortably
furnished and with no suggestion about it anywhere of secret
hiding places. We went through everywhere most carefully for we
were certain that there was a hidden safe somewhere, one of the
keys on Isaacstein's bunch, a Yale one, being unaccounted for,
but&mdash;we found nothing."</p>

<p>"Then suddenly we noticed some large empty paint tins in the
yard, and the color of the paint they had contained, we saw, was
different to the color of anything about the house. We asked the
housekeeper what they had been used for and her reply was that
Mr. Heber had been touching up one of his other properties. It
was the hobby of his Sundays and Saturday afternoons."</p>

<p>"We were on the alert at once, and learnt then that Isaacstein
was the owner of two houses in the adjoining street. One was let
to the local superintendent of police, but the other had been
vacant ever since his housekeeper had been with him. There had
been many applications for it, she explained, but her master had
required too high a rent for it, and so it had remained empty.
The house agents had become tired of sending people to go over
it."</p>

<p>"Asking where the keys were, she said she had them in her bag,
but had strict orders never to give them up to anybody unless
they came with a written order to view from the agent."</p>

<p>"We were soon inside the unoccupied house, and here again it
seemed at first we were going to be disappointed. The house was
an old one, but in perfectly clean and well-kept condition, and
everything appeared innocent about it. But, realising that this
was our last hope, we made a most exhaustive search, and, to cut
a long story short, we found at last, in a cupboard in one of the
back rooms, behind some odds and ends, principally pieces of old
wallpaper that looked quite out of place in accordance with the
general tidiness of the house, a small sliding panel, and,
pulling it to one side, we found what we were after."</p>

<p>"And what was it?" asked the Home Secretary, for the detective
had taken a moment's rest.</p>

<p>"We found," replied Stone solemnly, "a large safe, the
contents of which furnished the most damning evidence about
everything that we wanted. There was convincing proof that
Isaacstein had been the receiver-in-chief of the gang of the Iron
Man, for the safe contained many articles of the proceeds of
their raids. The diamond necklace of Lady Ponsford was there, the
pearls taken from Mr. Ratton in the raid at White Notley, the
emeralds that were snatched from Miss Whiteford across the dead
body of Colonel Holt at Witham Court, and a host of other
valuables that have not been identified yet, and perhaps never
will be."</p>

<p>"And the silver candlesticks of my friend, Dr. Shillington?"
asked the Home Secretary, rubbing his hands together delightedly,
"and the other things he lost at the same time?"</p>

<p>The detective smiled a slow inscrutable smile. "No. They were
not there," he replied, and then he frowned, "but maybe we shall
get hold of them yet." He turned to his portfolio and picked out
another paper. "And now we come to the next outrage, and here the
facts are very straightforward and plain. Isaacstein was murdered
about 11.30, and the Epping doctor met his death just before two
o'clock upon the same day. Dr. Logan had been in practice there
for about two years. He was a bachelor and kept two maids. One of
them, the house parlor-maid, says that about twelve o'clock she
answered an enquiry on the 'phone as to what time the doctor was
generally to be found in after lunch, and she replied that he
could be seen in his surgery about two o'clock. Just before two,
then, she heard the surgery bell ring, and, glancing through the
glass panel of the waiting-room door, saw a man sitting in there
alone, with his face tied up in a scarf. She could give no
description of him afterwards except that he was not very big,
and was wearing a light dust coat. She went and informed the
doctor that a patient was waiting, and shortly afterwards she
heard the doctor speaking and then the closing of the surgery
door. Then at that moment the back door bell rang and she went
along the passage to answer it. It was the butcher who had
called, and she tells us that she stood chatting for a couple of
minutes or so before she went back into the kitchen. The other
maid was out in the wash-house at the time. Then nothing more
happened for about ten minutes, until the telephone rang with a
message for the doctor to go out at once to High Ongar. She
knocked at the surgery door and received no answer, and hearing
no sound of voices, thought the doctor must have already gone
out. Thereupon she went into the surgery and found her master
lying upon the floor in a pool of blood, dead. He had been first
bludgeoned with a fearful blow upon the head, and then obviously
to make sure, his throat had been cut as he was lying upon the
floor. The local police were upon the scene in less than five
minutes, but all they could learn was that a woman in the baker's
shop opposite&mdash;the doctor's house is situated right in the
main street&mdash;had seen a man ride off upon a bicycle in the
direction of London about ten minutes before they had arrived.
She could give no description of him at all, except that he was
not a big man. Of course the roads were at once scoured in every
direction, but no man on a bicycle nor any suspicious person was
encountered, and so here again the assassin got away
unfollowed."</p>

<p>The detective took out another paper from his portfolio and
frowned angrily.</p>

<p>"And then, as of course you know, next day that honeymoon
couple came forward, and the devil of it was, that instead of
going off to the local police, they wrote first to a newspaper
and it was broadcast everywhere that they had seen the murderer.
Their tale was, you will remember, that about a quarter to two on
the afternoon of the day of the murder, they had come across a
black Jehu motor car parked in a sheltered glade of Epping Forest
about three hundred yards off the London road, and about a mile
from the town of Epping itself. There was no one in the car, and
they had wondered at the time that anyone should be so trustful
as to leave it and its contents unprotected there, for amongst
other things, they had remarked a suitcase inside upon the back
seat. They walked on slowly to return home to the cottage where
they were living, it is a lonely one upon the side of the London-road, and then about half an hour later they heard a car coming
up behind them, and, turning round, recognised it as the one they
had seen in the glade. They are quite sure it was the same car,
for the curtains were all up and it struck them as peculiar, it
being such a lovely day. The car was coming at quite a moderate
speed, and they got a good look at the driver. They described him
as dark and sallow-looking, and both say they would know him
again."</p>

<p>The detective looked impressively at the Home Secretary. "You
know also, of course, about the finding later of the bicycle.
Well, so much," he went on, "for the murder of Dr. Logan, and we
know quite well why he died."</p>

<p>"Not one of the gang surely?" queried the Home Secretary
incredulously. "He was only a young fellow I read, just fresh
from hospital."</p>

<p>Stone shook his head. "No, not one of the gang," he replied
gravely, "but one evening in June last he was returning home in
his car late at night from Maldon, where he had gone for a bathe,
and midway between that town and Hatfield Peveral, in turning a
sharp corner, he ran into and upset one of two bicyclists who
were coming in the opposite direction. The bicyclist was half-stunned and badly cut about one wrist, and in spite of the
strenuous and even angry protestations of his companion, the
doctor would insist on taking the wounded man in to Hatfield
Peveral to get the hurts attended to at the surgery of another
medical man, a friend of his, who lived there. But the other
doctor was out and so Dr. Logan dressed the cuts in the surgery
himself. The man then said he felt quite all right again, and,
remounting his bicycle, rode off with his friend. He left Dr.
Logan thinking hard, however, for the doctor was suspicious about
two things; the impatient hurry of both men to get away and the
fact that when he, the doctor, had lifted the half unconscious
man into his car, he had distinctly felt a heavy, bulky object in
the fellow's pocket, that he was sure afterwards could have only
been a pistol of some kind. The next evening the doctor read in
the newspapers of the raid at Witham Court, the previous night,
and he wrote at once to us here at the Yard an account of his
adventure, stating that he should be able to recognise the men at
any time, and also that his patient was tattooed upon both
forearms about two inches above the wrists. The description, too,
that he gave of the wounded man tallied almost exactly with that
which Bloxham gave of the murderer of Isaacstein, and the
honeymoon couple gave of the man they saw driving the Jehu
car."</p>

<p>Stone sighed. "Yes, Dr. Logan died because they knew he would
have been a damning witness against them if ever they were put on
trial. Unhappily, he told them his name and where he lived."</p>

<p>"But I want to know," interrupted the Home Secretary frowning,
"do the descriptions that Dr. Logan gave of the cyclist he
knocked down, that the pawnbroker's assistant gave of the man who
murdered his master, and that the honeymoon couple gave of the
man they saw in the car, all tally with that of one of the gang
whom you say are now upon that island?"</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the detective impressively, "there is a man
there who, if the color went out of his face, and his figure were
much slimmer, would exactly fit the bill. He is dark-eyed and of
a medium height, and, if I am any judge of temperament and
physiognomy&mdash;" Stone gritted his teeth here, "there are all
possibilities of his being the cool-headed and murderous creature
who carried out these crimes. He is the leader among them there,
too. There is no mistake about that."</p>

<p>"Then you have been there?" asked the Home Secretary, opening
his eyes, "to the house upon the island? You have visited them in
person, yourself?"</p>

<p>"Twice," replied Stone calmly. "My colleague, Mr. Carter and
I, together. We had to go twice because upon the first occasion,
this particular gentleman, along with another of them living
there, was not at home. They had gone motoring for the day, we
were told." He added drily. "That was last Tuesday week, sir, the
day you will remember, upon which two of the murders were
done."</p>

<p>The Home Secretary frowned again. "But if the man's appearance
as he looks now," he asked, "does not exactly answer to that of
the one we want, how does all this help us in any way?"</p>

<p>"But his appearance might answer, sir," the detective smiled
back, "if his face were washed over with alcohol and any surplus
undergarments removed, for even now he is not unlike the
photograph that the pawnbroker took."</p>

<p>The Home Secretary was silent for a moment, and then he asked,
"But how do you know in the first instance that these men are the
gang? You haven't explained to me." The tone of his voice became
a little petulant. "And that's the main thing I want to
know."</p>

<p>"One minute, sir, and I'll satisfy you," said Stone. "I will
only just mention first, so that I don't have to hark back, that
we have established beyond all doubt that these two murders we
have just been discussing were the work of the same hand. We
found that a Jehu car containing a suitcase on the back seat was
left at a garage in Ilford just before eleven on the morning of
the murders. It was called for again just before twelve, and the
description of the man who left it tallies with the other
descriptions that were given by the parties, who we contend
encountered him that day."</p>

<p>"But the bicycle?" asked the Home Secretary. "He rode away
from Epping on a bicycle, you said, not in a motor car."</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied Stone, "and the conviction is that he came
up from beyond Colchester in the morning with a bicycle in the
back of the car, hid the bicycle somewhere in some lonely country
lane off the main road before he reached Ilford, and then picked
it up again before he finally parked his car in that glade in the
forest near Epping."</p>

<p>"Well, go on," said the Home Secretary, after a moment's
thought, "the idea is quite plausible."</p>

<p>"Now," went on Stone, "we come to this third murder that
occurred in the public park at Colchester just after daybreak the
next morning."</p>

<p>He turned to his portfolio again. "Fred Duke was the man's
name, he was a painter by trade, and for more than seven months
he had been in the employ of the same building and decorating
firm in Colchester. He had been under our special observation for
some days before he was murdered because we suspected him of
having supplied plans of and information about a number of the
houses in Essex that had been attacked by the raiders." The
detective's voice vibrated just a little here. "In a general
survey of the outrages that had taken place in Essex it had been
remarked that three of the houses where these outrages had
occurred had been painted and decorated within the previous six
months, and enquiries revealed the significant fact that all
these renovations had been carried out by the same firm in
Colchester. That set us enquiring, and we learnt that this man
Duke had worked on every one of them. What was more probable
then, we asked ourselves, than that he had all along been a
member of the gang and supplying the information needed before
the residences could be successfully attacked? So we shadowed him
and should have been actually shadowing at the very time of the
murder, if he had not, unfortunately for himself, secretly left
his lodgings that morning before it was light. He was killed in
the public park about ten minutes to five, stabbed to the heart
among a clump of trees just by the King's statue, and left
weltering in his blood. But his murderer was seen, as it
happened, and had to run for it. Ordinarily speaking, there would
not have been a soul near the spot at that time of the morning,
but just by chance a man was making a short cut across the park
to the railway-station, and at about a hundred and fifty yards'
distance he saw the murder done. He shouted out, but the murderer
ran for his life and quickly disappeared among the trees. He
described the man as being strong and athletic looking, with a
square face. But we got a better description later from a woman
who came forward and said she had seen a man getting over the
park fence about a mile from the scene of the murder exactly as
the town clock was striking five. The man crossed her back yard
to get into the road and we got a minute description of him from
her.</p>

<p>"Well, the murdered man was speedily identified and his
lodgings were searched and all information obtained about him
that we could gather from his landlady. But she could really tell
us very little, for her lodger had been a quiet and very reserved
man, with no friends visiting him and rarely going out himself.
In the past three months, except for his work, she said, he had
only been away for the day twice, and then both times it had been
on a Sunday. He had not told her where he was going, but she
remembered he had come back on both occasions with black mud on
his boots. The information we got was very meagre, and when we
came to search his rooms things seemed to be very much in the
same way. Nothing for a long time to connect him with anyone and
then at last we found out one significant thing. His candle
fitted badly in the candle-stick, and round the bottom was
pinched a crushed and dirty piece of paper that had once formed
part of a paper bag. We smoothed it out and could just decipher
'P. Helps, Baker, Great Oakley'&mdash;," the detective paused a
long moment&mdash;"and Great Oakley, Sir, is the village nearest
to the island where the gang live, about a mile and a half away,
and you cross over to it at low water by a stone causeway always
muddy&mdash;with black river mud."</p>

<p>The Home Secretary made no comment and the detective went
on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then we learned the murdered man had received a letter by
post the previous evening, but as he had taken the letter in
himself and it had not been found upon him after his death, that
information was no help to us, but asking, if to her knowledge he
had himself written any letters lately, his landlady replied,
'Yes, two days ago,' and that he had borrowed her writing pad to
write it upon. Then we at once asked for the pad, and at first
inspection it seemed quite useless to us. There were, however,
very faint marks upon it where a pen had impressed through on to
the page underneath, and smoking the blade of a knife above the
chimney of a lamp, we smutted the paper well over,
and&mdash;&mdash;" a note of triumph swelled into the detective's
voice as he whipped out a page from his portfolio, "this is what
we read when we held it to the light."</p>

<p>"Now for something that worries me. I believe I am being
watched. A man is shadowing me. At least I think so, for I have
three times seen him in our street at night, and he was in the
High-street when I went to work this morning. I don't think I'd
better come down for a week or two. I'll wait until things clear
up. If you want to speak to me urgently, write and make a date
for very early one morning, and then I'll meet you, say just
before 5 by the King's Statue in the park. I can give anyone
who's watching the slip then by getting over the back fence in
the dark. There's nothing they can find here if they search, but
I've got the wind up and feel nervy."</p>

<p>Stone leant back in his chair, and a dead silence followed.
Then the Home Secretary turned and beamed upon the Commissioner
of Police.</p>

<p>"Excellent, excellent," he exclaimed. "You are well served,
sir." He drew in a deep breath. "I can visualise it as a whole
now. This dreadful organisation with its tentacles spread out
like an octopus and dragging its victims down to death. And all
the while you are closing in, secretly, silently, and careless of
the censure of the public, because on you lies the responsibility
not to strike until you are ready." He smiled apologetically.
"Really, I'm ashamed I came to worry you."</p>

<p>"Not at all," laughed the Commissioner. "It's each one to his
own trade, you see, and in our work we simply can't tell the
public how we are getting on. It would spoil everything."</p>

<p>"Indeed it would," agreed the Home Secretary. He screwed up
his face and looked very puzzled. "But why was this man Duke
killed if he were a member of their own gang?"</p>

<p>"He let them know that he was under police surveillance,"
replied the Commissioner, "and they realised then that he could
never be of any further service to them in consequence. Worse
than that, he had become a positive danger, for by following him
they probably argued we might find them. They were in retreat, so
to speak, and he was just like a wounded man who was hampering
their flight, so&mdash;they just killed him."</p>

<p>"It was sound policy," growled Stone, "for this Duke was a
weak-natured chap and we would have got everything out of him.
You saw in his letter that he said he was nervy."</p>

<p>"And this man who killed him?" asked the Home Secretary, "have
you identified him with one of them on the island?"</p>

<p>Stone nodded grimly. "There is a man there, sir," he said,
"who would answer exactly to the description that the woman in
the garden gave, if he did not shave for a few days, and were
dressed in working clothes."</p>

<p>"Then, good God!" burst out the Home Secretary, "why haven't
you raided the place already and taken the lot?"</p>

<p>The Commissioner shook his head. "We are not ready, Mr.
Mortlock," he said. "We want more than these two men; we want the
whole of the gang."</p>

<p>"But there are the others there," exclaimed the bewildered
official, "and surely they would turn out to be incriminated in
some way."</p>

<p>"We have no evidence against them," replied the Commissioner,
shaking his head, "and as things are at present, we are not in
the position of being able to bring home to any person any single
one of those outrages committed by the gang of the Iron Man at
those country houses."</p>

<p>"Yet you are sure, you say," frowned the Home Secretary, "that
you have now marked down the wretches who have been harrying us
all this year."</p>

<p>"Quite sure," said the Commissioner confidently. "We have no
doubt about it at all." He pulled his chair forward and leant
over across the desk. "To sum up the whole position, it is like
this. We are confident that we are right upon the trail of the
gang. These men upon the island, knowing that our attention is
being focussed upon them, but we are sure, imagining it to be
quite accidental and only because of the murder of that butler of
Dr. Shillington's happening in their neighborhood," he held up
his hand to emphasise his point, "are yet almost in a state of
panic as to where our investigations may lead us and are striking
right and left to silence all who might possibly become sources
of danger to that gang." He leant back again in his chair. "You
see what I mean, don't you? We strike at those men on the island,
but it is the gang of the Iron Man who instantly strike back, for
in each of those three last murders we see unmistakably the
bloody fingerprints of their hand. Everything dovetails in
together. They kill Isaacstein, who was their fence&mdash;the
Epping doctor because he knew two of them by sight&mdash;and
Duke, the painter, who was in their employ, because he was a
weakling and had fallen under our suspicion." The Commissioner
was most emphatic. "So we can afford to wait, I insist. We are
justified in waiting, and, more than that, it is our duty, in
spite of the anxiety the public are in, to hold our hands."</p>

<p>"But on that island," asked the Home Secretary as if still
only partially convinced, "couldn't they escape by sea? Have they
no boats there?"</p>

<p>"A dinghy," replied the Commissioner carelessly, "a sailing
boat, a small rowing boat on the shore, and a most serviceable
looking motor launch."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the Home Secretary. "Then they have
an open get-away by the sea, any time."</p>

<p>"No, hardly," said the Chief Commissioner shaking his head.
"Harwick is not ten miles away, and they could not get a boat out
of the river without being marked down, besides," and he smiled
drily, "I fancy that launch of theirs is not in good nick just
now. We had an expert working on it for half an hour one night,
and it's just possible when they next use it, there may be
trouble in several ways."</p>

<p>The Home Secretary made a wry face again. "And we fancy you
police have no imagination."</p>

<p>"We've too much," laughed the Commissioner. "I was imagining I
should lose my job just now." His face grew serious again. "And
there's another thing that we must consider and indeed one that
we can never lose sight of. These men are desperate men,
remember; men who will glory in fighting to the death before
being taken, and so when we decide to effect their arrests, the
element of surprise must be wholly on our side or the community
will again suffer heavily. Our best men only, will be relegated
for the work, and it will be a bloody business if we bungle
anywhere. We must take them completely by surprise, and that is
why we are so chary now of occasioning them alarm." He spoke very
sternly. "Yes, we must still wait, but I don't somehow think it
will be for very long now."</p>

<p>"But what do you expect to gain now by waiting?" asked the
Home Secretary.</p>

<p>"The uncovering of some of their outside members," was the
instant reply. "They must have a biggish organisation to have
done what they have done so successfully, and if we don't alarm
them any further, we shall probably soon find them communicating
with one another by their usual channels. There will be visitors
most likely to the island, and then we may find these visitors
easier to deal with than the gentlemen we have already seen." He
smiled drily. "We may then recognise some old friends perhaps,
and be able to put the screw on straight away." He laughed. "In
our work, Mr. Mortlock, we often get the heads&mdash;through the
tails."</p>

<p>They talked on for some time and then the Home Secretary rose
up to go.</p>

<p>"Well, I think I am quite satisfied," he said, "and I shall
get that question postponed." He smiled genially at Stone. "You
are a great detective, my friend."</p>

<p>"Just sixteen stone, sir," was the reply delivered with the
utmost gravity. "Not an ounce more nor an ounce less."</p>

<p>A minute later when they were alone the detective said to his
superior officer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was just coming to you, sir, when you rang me. The body
found near the East India Dock on Tuesday was identified. It is
that of a man in Barking-road, and we learn now that his wife
also is missing under very suspicious circumstances. I am going
straight away to enquire about it."</p>

<p>"Essex again!" signed the Commissioner. "Shall we ever get a
clean bill of health there again? A reign of terror and a rain of
blood. God have mercy on us all!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; AT BAY.</h2>

<p class="first">THERE were days of gloom that followed now for
the inmates of the house upon the island, and even the confident
and thick-skinned Edgehill lost something of his equanimity and
of his indifference as to what the future might be holding in
store for him.</p>

<p>The return of Bull as a sea-soaked corpse upon the sands with
a bullet through his head and with his pockets picked had fallen
like a bomb among them, and had left them numb and almost
speechless in their bewilderment.</p>

<p>Who was it who could have killed him? they asked themselves,
and what, possibly, could have been the killer's motive for his
action? It was so inexplicable from whatsoever angle they
regarded it; for hardened law-breakers themselves, they were
apparently now confronted with a contempt for law in every way
the equal to their own, and with a ruthlessness, moreover, that
they themselves had never exceeded in the perpetration of all
their dark episodes of dreadful crime.</p>

<p>It could not, on the face of it, be Scotland Yard, they
contended, and yet who else, they argued, could be interested in
them to the extent of inflicting a sudden and violent death upon
one of their associates.</p>

<p>The face of Sarle was one continual frown, Edgehill gnawed his
fingernails to the very quick, and Colonel Jasper was weighed
down with presentiment, like a fighter who was fighting
hopelessly with his back against the wall.</p>

<p>But in spite of their depression, they were prompt and
businesslike in their disposal of the body.</p>

<p>"We can't leave it lying here for anyone else to see," said
Sarle savagely. "An inquest would be unthinkable, so we must get
rid of it at once. We must sink it out to sea. We'll take it out
beyond McKinnon's buoy. There are a hundred fathoms of water
there."</p>

<p>And so Sarle and Edgehill, jumping hastily into their boat,
towed the body to a mile and more distant from the shore. Then
they lashed to it part of the shaft of a disused plough, and let
it go.</p>

<p>It was a strange enough burial for any human being, and no
beast of the jungle would have been disposed of in a more
heartless and summary manner.</p>

<p>There was no sorrow expressed that a comrade had passed away,
and no word of regret spoken that a life had been cut off in so
untimely a manner. The mourners mourned only that they had had to
pull so far out to sea, and the dead man was consigned with
curses to his eternal rest. He was handled roughly, and was
grudged even the piece of rope that was attached to the iron that
was to drag him down.</p>

<p>"Our best piece of manilla," snarled Sarle, "and I bought it
in Colchester only a couple of weeks ago. Damn him, he ought to
have seen that someone was after him, and not allowed himself to
be butchered like a sheep." He frowned angrily. "Now we shall
always have to face the risk of that Epping couple recognising me
whenever they see me."</p>

<p>They went back into the Priory and with jerky sentences,
between long intervals of silence, spoke of the dangers that were
now so obviously encompassing them.</p>

<p>One thing stood out clearly, they agreed. They were no longer,
as they had hitherto so confidently imagined, the masters of the
situation; they were no longer in complete control of the forces
that were surrounding them.</p>

<p>They were being watched it was now certain, but by whom and
with what object, rack their brains as they might, they could not
determine.</p>

<p>Broome was sent up to the village for the London newspapers,
but there was nothing there of any particular interest to them,
and indeed, it seemed now that all the excitement about the three
murders had died down. There was no further reference to them,
and instead, the 'Daily Microphone' in big headlines was now
frantically tickling the palates of its readers with well-spiced
details of an abortive attempt to poison the favorite for the
Manchester November Handicap.</p>

<p>The next day, however, Harkness, the Great Oakley village
butcher, brought down some rather disquieting news.</p>

<p>A holiday camp, he said, had been set up on the village side
of the marshes, and a dozen or more individuals were there under
canvas, living the simple life.</p>

<p>"Mad, I call them," had been his comment. "The end of
October's no time for anyone to be sleeping out in tents, and
besides," he sneered, "they don't look as if they are the kind of
people to be enjoying that sort of holiday. Great, hefty chaps,
more like policemen than folks out for a bit of fun." He grinned.
"But the village pub's doing well, and so am I. They eat a devil
of a lot of meat, and it's all good for trade."</p>

<p>"They're Scotland Yard men, of course," said Sarle frowning,
when Colonel Jasper brought in the news, "and they're there to
watch us." His voice took on a contemptuous tone. "Well, let them
watch and wait until they all get pneumonia in these damned
fogs." He puffed complacently at his cigarette. "It's perfectly
clear, however, that they have nothing definite against us or
they wouldn't be wasting time by watching. They'd have struck
long before now if they had evidence at all. They're just
suspicious for some reason, and if we stick tight, our position
is quite unassailable." He looked thoughtfully at Broome. "The
citadel can be only betrayed from within."</p>

<p>But in spite of his brave words, as day by day went by, the
gloom over the Priory deepened, and in the end the nerves of
Edgehill as well as those of Sarle and the colonel became
obviously on edge. They were irritable and jumpy, and swore at
one another upon the slightest provocation. The most trivial
disagreement brought them almost to the verge of a serious
quarrel. They had no inclination either for their nightly game of
bridge, and instead, sat staring moodily into the fire and
listening, although they would never have admitted it, for any
sounds outside heralding the arrival of the police.</p>

<p>Only Broome was unperturbed, and he seemed to be living in a
world quite of his own. He listened abstractedly to the
conversation of the others, but took no part in it, indeed he
hardly ever spoke, and then when he did, it was only to report
some event that had apparently never happened. There was no sense
in a lot of what he said, but, uncannily enough, every remark
that he made was pointed with some barb to rankle in and further
excite the already highly strung Sarle.</p>

<p>"An aeroplane had alighted upon the sands behind the house,"
he told them. "It was a fighting one and carried two machine
guns. Every night he heard the sound of muffled oars; there were
boats patrolling round the island. He had seen huge dogs among
the reeds upon the other side of the river and they looked like
bloodhounds to him. They had enormous ears. There were people
hiding night and day upon the marshes, for the wild ducks flew
very high and never now came down to rest."</p>

<p>All this was bad enough to annoy his companions, but at meal
times he made things much worse. He had taken to making noises as
he ate his food, unpleasant gurgling noises that were half like
snores.</p>

<p>Sarle cursed him with every bad word that he could lay his
tongue to, and ultimately made him sit at another table, but
Edgehill laughed a mirthless laugh, as if anxious to find
distraction in anything.</p>

<p>"He thinks he's back in the loony house," he guffawed, "and
taking his tucker again through his nose."</p>

<p>"But I shall end in killing him," said Sarle viciously once,
when Broome had left the room. "When he's in the boat I'll knock
him over and let him drown."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper made no comment; he was looking very ill and
listless, but Edgehill said meditatively:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I don't understand the beggar at all. He's taken to
stealing things now and eating them on the sly. Quite a lot of
that ham, for instance, went yesterday after breakfast, and every
day we're using more bread now. Also I'll swear he's helping
himself to the eggs and putting water in the milk to make up for
what he's drunk. Then my cigarettes go much more quickly&mdash;he
only smokes Virginians&mdash;and he had a big nobbler of whisky
the other day when we were out. I happened to notice it because I
had only recently opened a new bottle."</p>

<p>"Curse him," swore Sarle. "Something'll happen if Shillington
doesn't take him. We're not going to be annoyed like this."</p>

<p>One morning early, the river being high, the three went
fishing on the causeway. Mother Heggarty was ill again, and they
left Broome with orders to clear up and do the housework.
Strangely enough, with all his dignity and assumption of fine
airs, the latter accepted as a matter of course that most of the
menial jobs should fall to him, and accordingly, without comment,
he set about the work in an expeditious and experienced
manner.</p>

<p>Within an hour everything was finished to his satisfaction,
and then taking down a fishing rod, he, too, disappeared
outside.</p>

<p>A few minutes after and Mother Heggarty came into the hall.
She was in her ordinary every-day clothes and her head, as usual,
was enveloped in a shawl. An onlooker would have had difficulty
in determining how she looked, for the shawl covered most of her
face, but her walk was tottery, and it was with very feeble steps
that she groped her way to the fireplace and took the kettle off
the hob. She disappeared into the kitchen to return very shortly
with a cup of tea. Placing the cup upon the table, she sank into
an armchair nearby and held her hands out to the warmth of the
fire. Then she leant back and apparently forgetting altogether
about the cup of tea, in a few seconds was fast asleep.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, and
then there was the sound of a faint movement upon the stairs, and
a few moments later, the curtains by the passage parted, and a
man peered cautiously into the hall.</p>

<p>He stared for a long time in the direction of the recumbent
Mother Heggarty, and then apparently satisfied at last that she
was really asleep, passed across the hall behind her to the
window facing the causeway. He limped a little with his left
foot, but his movements were quite silent, and even if the old
woman had not been very deaf he would not have disturbed her.</p>

<p>Looking out of the window, he saw Sarle, Edgehill, and the
Colonel fishing from a boat just near the causeway, and about a
hundred yards lower down, Broome fishing from the river bank.</p>

<p>He went into the kitchen and helped himself to a good portion
of ham and bread and butter. Then he ladled out two cupfuls of
milk from a big pan in the cool safe, afterwards putting in two
cupfuls of water. Then, he borrowed a few cigarettes from a large
box that he saw on the kitchen dresser, and finally, he picked up
a newspaper and sat interestedly reading upon the edge of the
table.</p>

<p>He read for quite a long while, but was then about to put the
paper down, when suddenly he heard the front door open sharply
and quick footsteps passing across the hall.</p>

<p>His jaw dropped and the pupils of his eyes dilated, but he
acted promptly, and slipping off the table, glided, rather than
crept to behind the kitchen door. Notwithstanding his lame foot,
his movements again made no sound.</p>

<p>"Damn," he swore swiftly, "but I've been caught napping, and
this is the only place I could have got to in time." His face
brightened suddenly. "But thank the Lord, it's only Broome. I'd
know his footsteps anywhere."</p>

<p>Flattening himself against the wall he looked through the
chink of the door and saw Broome pass through the curtains and
march towards his bedroom. Then suddenly the engineer stopped
dead in his tracks, and with a puzzled frown upon his face and
with his head lifted high up in the air, sniffed deeply three or
four times. He was then not half a dozen feet from where the
hidden man was standing.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" ejaculated the latter, "he's smelt the dust upon
my clothes. He's great on smells, confound him."</p>

<p>Broome stood still, sniffing hard, and then he turned abruptly
into the kitchen and walked with long strides to a big dresser
there. He pulled open a drawer and from the sounds that followed,
was evidently choosing among some keys.</p>

<p>Then apparently having found what he was seeking, he slammed
to the drawer, and with his eyes straight before him marched out
of the kitchen and up the stairs.</p>

<p>The man behind the door wiped over a grimy forehead with his
sleeve.</p>

<p>"And now I'm in the soup," he panted. "What's going to
happen?"</p>

<p>Three or four minutes followed, and he heard Broome going
through all the rooms upstairs. Then there was a short silence,
and finally the door at the top of the stairs was clanged to, and
with easy measured steps Broome came down again. He went straight
into his bedroom, reappearing, however, almost immediately with a
little bundle of fishhooks, which he scanned interestedly as he
walked along the passage. He crossed the hall, without looking up
from his hooks, and opening the front door, went out and closed
it to gently behind him.</p>

<p>In a flash, the man behind the kitchen door was out from his
hiding place, and darting along the passage, and across the hall,
was standing peering breathlessly through the window. His face
was white and tense in its excitement.</p>

<p>"Now it all depends on what he does," he muttered hoarsely.
"He's loony, and may have taken nothing in. If he goes and speaks
to the others straight away, then with my lame foot, it will be
all up with me; but if he doesn't&mdash;&mdash;" he shrugged his
shoulders and smiled grimly&mdash;"then I shall have a couple of
hours or so to consider how to get out of one of the worst messes
I have ever been in, in all my life."</p>

<p>But the watcher through the window had but few seconds of
immediate anxiety.</p>

<p>"Good!" he muttered to himself; "he's not going anywhere near
them. He's going to fish again on his own. Then I've got probably
until this evening before they know, and even then he mayn't say
anything at all." He shook his head frowningly. "No, no, knowing
all I do, I daren't risk it. I must make for that police camp
directly I can get over the causeway without being seen, however
awful a journey it'll be for me with my bad foot. Surely my
work's done here. I've got heaps of evidence. I've&mdash;&mdash;"
he hesitated. "But I'd have loved to have been able to see things
out to the very end, and I ought to, too. I ought to be here when
they make the arrests, for I might save a lot of useful lives.
Sarle and Edgehill will fight like tigers, and they'll never give
in, if once they are warned. Yet, from outside it will be quite
impossible to get them unawares." He turned away from the window.
"But what the devil am I going to do now? I think I'll hide among
the reeds somewhere until it gets dark. I'll get some things
together and quit. I can get out without being seen through the
door at the back." He sighed. "Oh! If I had only someone here to
take a message now."</p>

<p>He started to limp noiselessly across the hall, and then just
when he was passing behind the sleeping Mother Heggarty, he
noticed the untouched cup of tea.</p>

<p>He paused with a puzzled look upon his face, and then creeping
up, he stealthily dipped one finger into the cup. The tea was
stone cold.</p>

<p>He hesitated for a long moment, and then, holding his breath,
he bent down and gently tapped the old woman upon the arm.</p>
<hr> <p>It was nearly 5 o'clock before anyone came home, and then
it was Sarle, Edgehill, and the colonel who appeared first.
Edgehill threw down a heavy basket of fish, and at once shouted
for Broome.</p>

<p>"Damn him, where is he?" he growled, as he received no answer.
"I thought he'd come in long ago."</p>

<p>"Try his bedroom," said Sarle, "perhaps he's sulking and won't
come out."</p>

<p>Edgehill flung open the bedroom door, but the room was empty,
and then, as he was hungry, after a vindictive glance at Mother
Heggarty, who was dozing placidly in her accustomed chair in the
corner, he flung himself into the kitchen and proceeded to clean
and cook the fish.</p>

<p>They had their meal in silence, Sarle and Edgehill eating with
good appetites, but Colonel Jasper taking practically nothing at
all.</p>

<p>"You look chippy, Jasper," said Sarle presently, noticing that
the colonel was only picking at his food.</p>

<p>"And I feel it, too," replied the latter listlessly. "I feel
damned bad."</p>

<p>"I wonder why Shillington's not been here lately," frowned
Sarle. "We've not seen him for nearly a week."</p>

<p>"Not since that day when he brought us the mushrooms," added
Edgehill. "I wonder if the old quack's ill?"</p>

<p>"He ought to have come," said the colonel, angrily, "and I
don't understand why he hasn't. He can't do me any good, but he
ought to have seen Mother Heggarty." A thought seemed suddenly to
strike him, and turning round he called out loudly, "How are you
to-night, mother? Feel any better now?"</p>

<p>But apparently the old woman had not heard him, for she made
no response, and so, with a shrug of his shoulders, he subsided
into his chair.</p>

<p>Broome came in at that moment, and bumping down his fishing
basket, proceeded to hang his rod upon the wall.</p>

<p>"Do any good?" asked Edgehill. "We got seventeen."</p>

<p>"Twenty-one," replied Broome, "and I threw five big ones away.
I thought they would be coarse."</p>

<p>"Liar," said Sarle, and he spat contemptuously into the fire.
Broome made no comment, but sitting down at the end of the table,
helped himself to some of the fish remaining in the dish and
commenced to eat.</p>

<p>For once he ate silently, and Sarle, who from his attitude and
the expression on his face, was only waiting to work himself into
a rage, could find no excuse for further invective.</p>

<p>Conversation languished, and then Edgehill, who was feeling
bored, asked suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Any adventures, Broome?"</p>

<p>Broome looked up with an important air. "I saw nine
geese&mdash;&mdash;" he began, when Sarle burst out savagely.
"Oh! Shut up, you fool!" and snatching up a book from the
mantelshelf, he threw it point blank at him.</p>

<p>With a resounding thud, it caught Broome squarely on the face
and the pain or the indignity of receiving the blow made him go
white as a sheet. He put his hand up to his lip and found that it
was bleeding. At once then his pallor passed and he got very red,
and for just one second it looked as though he were going to
retaliate in some way, but he evidently thought better of it, for
his face instantly calmed down, and picking up his knife and fork
again, he tranquilly resumed his meal as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>"Stop it, Sarle," said Colonel Jasper angrily. "Damn it, man,
keep yourself more under control."</p>

<p>Broome ate on steadily without further molestation, stopping,
however, every now and then to wipe the blood that trickled from
his lip. Then, his meal finished, he got up and as a matter of
course began to clear away, and a few minutes later from the
sounds that came from the kitchen, he was washing up.</p>

<p>"A damned good servant," sighed Colonel Jasper, but the others
made no remark.</p>

<p>Finishing his work in the kitchen, Broome went into his
bedroom, reappearing, however, in a few minutes in the hall with
the inevitable book in his hand. It was seen then that he had had
a wash and brushed his hair and changed his coat. He looked like
a university professor.</p>

<p>He sat down in the chair he usually occupied and at once
commenced to read.</p>

<p>Edgehill eyed him lazily. "Look at the beggar's shoes," he
said presently. "We've not seen them before."</p>

<p>"They're new ones," remarked Broome, at once glancing up, "the
stitches in my old ones had come undone."</p>

<p>"But where did you get them from?" asked Edgehill curiously.
"You've not bought any lately."</p>

<p>"From a dead man I found," replied Broome. "I only got them
to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh!" remarked Edgehill, grinning, "and where's the dead
johnny you took them from?"</p>

<p>"He was offensive," replied Broome, "and I threw him in the
sea this morning. He must have been dead some days. He died in
one of the rooms upstairs." He looked down upon the shoes. "But
they fit me beautifully, as I told Jasper they would, the night
when we shot Larose."</p>

<p>The colonel, hearing his name spoken, opened his eyes
dreamily. For one moment he looked half asleep, but the next he
started up, his eyes blazed, and his voice came like a shot from
a gun.</p>

<p>"Where the hell did you get those shoes from?" he shouted.
"They were on that man Larose when he was drowned. Where did you
get them from, you fool?"</p>

<p>"I found them on the man upstairs," replied Broome, quite
unconcerned, "this morning, when you were all out."</p>

<p>"But they're Larose's," almost shrieked the colonel. "I know
them by the red linings and the wide laces there. I saw them on
him when he was lying in the car."</p>

<p>"Quite possibly," said Broome coolly, "and the dead man then,
was Larose. I thought his face seemed familiar to me, but there's
dust everywhere upstairs and the body was thick with it."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper sat back exhausted into his chair, the emotion
had been too much for him, and he looked on the verge of
collapse.</p>

<p>Edgehill took up the tale.</p>

<p>"Look here, Broome," he said quietly, "we all know you are the
biggest liar that any old hag could have ever foaled, but I ask
you straight, is there any truth in this? If there
isn't&mdash;&mdash;" and his voice hardened, and he rose up
menacingly from his chair, "I'm going to give you as big a hiding
as any man ever had. Now, say yes or no."</p>

<p>Broome looked at him without flinching. "Go upstairs," he said
quietly. "The door's unlocked and you won't want a key. There's
been a man living there for days. You'll find his clothes, some
empty bottles of beer, the remains of the food he's eaten, and a
lot of cigarette ends." He paused for a moment and all at once
the sane expression seemed to go out of his face. His mouth
twitched, his eyes opened very wide, and he drew himself up
haughtily as if he were speaking to an inferior. "Yes, Thomas
Edgehill, it's you and Jasper and that brute Sarle who've been
the fools all along, and it is I who have been always right. I
have heard the man moving above us day after day, and night after
night, and I told Dr. Shillington so." He dropped his voice
suddenly to an awed whisper. "And I heard the shot, too, that
killed Bull on that night of the storm. I am sure of it."</p>

<p>Edgehill glared as if he were restraining himself with an
effort. "And if you're lying," he said slowly, "you understand
what I'm going to give you." he paused to let his words sink in.
"A bit of hell."</p>

<p>"I'm not lying," replied Broome indignantly. He made a gesture
of contempt. "If I am, where did I get these shoes from?"</p>

<p>"Very good, then," snapped Edgehill. "Well go up and see." He
picked up an electric torch from the mantelshelf and turned to
the others. "Coming, both of you?"</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper shook his head. "Too tired," he said weakly.
"Sarle will go."</p>

<p>"But I'm damned if I will," came from the latter angrily.
"I'll wait here until you come down again, and then I'll see you
half kill Broome."</p>

<p>Edgehill turned without a word and disappeared through the
curtains and complete silence then reigned in the hall. Broome
had resumed his book as if he had no interest at all in any
subsequent proceedings, and Sarle and Colonel Jasper just leant
back in their chairs as if they were not aware that anything was
happening.</p>

<p>They heard Edgehill walk leisurely up the stairs, they heard
him open the door at the top and then his quick footsteps as he
walked up the passage. Then for perhaps ten seconds there was no
sound. Then an excited shout came&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come up, you chaps, come up, at once."</p>

<p>Sarle's face went ashen grey. Colonel Jasper sighed heavily
and with an effort uplifted himself from his chair then they both
in turn passed through the curtains and Broome and Mother
Heggarty were left alone.</p>

<p>Broome smiled&mdash;a slow inscrutable smile, but he did not
lift his eyes from his book; he was now reading 'The Confessions
of a Thug.'</p>

<p>A minute passed and Mother Heggarty got up from her chair and
shuffled into the kitchen. She cut herself a piece of cheese and
some bread and butter.</p>

<p>There was the sound of low voices upstairs, a tramping of feet
from room to room and the buzz of a long, intent
confabulation.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later, Sarle, Edgehill and Colonel Jasper
came down. The two first walked back in a decidedly subdued
manner to their chairs, but the Colonel planted himself
deliberately in front of Broome.</p>

<p>"Now look here," he said sharply, "we are going to get to the
bottom of this. You must tell us all you know."</p>

<p>Broome looked up with a frown. "I've told you everything,
haven't I?" he asked. "There's nothing more to tell."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," exclaimed the Colonel curtly. "You've told us
hardly anything as yet." He looked very sternly at him. "Now did
you really find a dead man upstairs?"</p>

<p>Mother Heggarty came back from the kitchen and shuffled again
into her chair.</p>

<p>"Certainly I did," replied Broome as if surprised that the
question had been asked. "I told you so, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the Colonel, "and I ask you then, did you
really throw him into the sea?"</p>

<p>"I did," replied Broome. "He was offensive and going bad."</p>

<p>"Whereabouts did you throw him in, then?"</p>

<p>"Over by the black rocks, exactly where I found Bull. The tide
was going out and he was swept away at once."</p>

<p>"How did you carry him all that way'"</p>

<p>"In the blanket that he had got in the room where I found him.
He was emaciated and very light."</p>

<p>"What clothes had he got on?"</p>

<p>"A shirt, his pants, his socks and his shoes. His other
clothes are lying about upstairs now&mdash;as he left them."</p>

<p>The Colonel frowned. "And what made you go up there at all?"
he asked.</p>

<p>For the first time Broome looked really annoyed. "I tell you,
man, he was offensive," he snapped. "My sense of smell warned me
and I knew something must be wrong."</p>

<p>Colonel Jasper paused as if he were thinking what further
question to ask, when Sarle broke in roughly.</p>

<p>"Well, you go off to your room now, Broome. You're a damned
fool anyhow and we're sick of you. So just make yourself
scarce."</p>

<p>For a moment Broome made no attempt to obey and then without a
word, he got up quickly and left the hall.</p>

<p>"Now," said Sarle scowling, "we'll consider what it all
means." But no one spoke for a long time, and then Colonel Jasper
sighed&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was Larose, of course," he said wearily. "He escaped
somehow that night, when we thought he was drowned, and found his
way to the rooms above." He shook his head slowly. "But how he
managed it, God only knows."</p>

<p>"But I hit him," insisted Edgehill sharply, "and he died
ultimately from his wounds. Yes, he was hurt somehow, and could
not get away to bring the police down upon us."</p>

<p>"Damn!" swore Sarle sullenly. "Was there ever such a mess up?
And it all comes from that old fool, Shillington, strangling his
butler. We've had nothing but trouble ever since."</p>

<p>"But think of Larose being there above us, all that time,"
sighed the Colonel again. "And what he must have seen and heard."
He lowered his voice to a whisper. "I'm not convinced yet that
Broome really threw anybody into the sea, and the devil of it is,
we have no means of finding out whether he did or not. Larose may
not be dead at all. He may not have been wounded either, but may
have just been biding his time until he could clear off safely
and bring the police down upon us."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall soon know that," said Sarle viciously, "and
one thing&mdash;from this moment, I can tell you my gun's never
going to leave my pocket." He snapped his teeth together. "I'm
never going to be put on trial again, and I'll give anyone who
tries to take me quite a hell of a run for his money."</p>

<p>They talked until long into the night, and finally it was a
very weary trio who sought their beds. Mother Heggarty had
shuffled into her bedroom hours before, and the light in Broome's
room had been extinguished very early.</p>

<p>And so sleep came at last to all within the Priory, but sleep
with disturbing dreams, for most of them who were sleeping
there.</p>

<p>Sarle dreamed that he was arguing with someone who wore an
odd-looking black cap; Edgehill dreamed that he was carving a ham
with a knife that had dried blood upon the hilt; Colonel Jasper
felt stabbing pains in his chest, even though he was asleep; and
Broome tossed in his slumbers because he could remember no sure
antidote for the rattle-snake bite.</p>

<p>Larose, too, was uneasy all night long, and woke up many times
to see if daylight were not yet come. Only old Mother Heggarty
had no dreams. She slept deeper than them all, calmly and in
perfect peace.</p>

<p>The next morning they were all up late, but the old woman was
the first about, putting them all to some semblance of tidiness,
and then going into the kitchen to make herself a cup of tea.
Broome came in while she was there and lifted his head
disdainfully as he passed her. He had come for the pail,
preparatory to going out and milking the cow.</p>

<p>After breakfast Sarle and Edgehill had a short conversation in
low voices, and then called to Broome and ordered him
peremptorily to take them to the exact spot upon the rocks from
where he said he had thrown the body in, the previous morning.
They suggested that Colonel Jasper should come too, but he
declined without interest, declaring that he felt too ill.</p>

<p>After they had gone, Mother Heggarty disappeared into her
room, and the colonel was left alone in the big hall. He leant
back in an arm chair drawn up close to the fire, and closed his
eyes as if he were going to have a sleep. But his chest hurt him
and he fidgetted about, trying to fit himself into a comfortable
position. He gave it up presently, however, and picking up a
newspaper stood up to get his glasses from the corner of the
mantelshelf, where he usually kept them. But he found someone had
put a heavy ash tray on them and they were broken.</p>

<p>"Curse," he swore weakly, "it's that fool Edgehill. He's like
a clumsy cart horse everywhere."</p>

<p>He turned to sink back into his chair, and then suddenly,
without the slightest warning, a violent fit of coughing seized
him, and instantly he was almost suffocated with a gush of blood.
He slipped down helplessly upon the floor, and the paroxysms
continuing, in a few seconds his head was lying in a crimson
pool. An expression of mortal terror held his face, his eyes were
wide and starting from his head, and he clenched his hands
together until the veins in them stood out like knotted cords.
His pallor was accentuated by the brightness of his blood.</p>

<p>A minute passed, and then the fit of coughing passing, his
eyes closed and his breathing almost stopped, as if he were on
the verge of death. The room was very still.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the curtains by the passage parted, and Mother
Heggarty came into the hall. She shuffled quickly, and without
hesitation up to where the colonel was lying upon the floor and
then stood over him, half bending down. Her attitude was one of
horror. Colonel Jasper opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Help me," he said faintly. "I'm bleeding to death. Get me on
to the bed, if you can."</p>

<p>The old woman's limbs were shaking, but clasping him by the
shoulders she half carried and half dragged him to his room.</p>

<p>She got him on the bed somehow, and then dipping a towel in
water she wiped the blood away from his mouth. He opened his eyes
and looked intently up into her face.</p>

<p>"Good old Nan," he whispered. "You'll be sorry if no one else
is. You'll&mdash;&mdash;" a scared and startled look leapt into
his face, to be replaced almost instantly, however, by an amazed
smile. "Good God! The jest of life," he stuttered. "The
jest&mdash;&mdash;" His eyes bulged in terror again. "Oh! it's
coming back. I shall die now. I shall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His body shook with another paroxysm, there was greater
hemorrhage even than before, and instantly&mdash;his head fell
back, and he was dead.</p>

<p>The others returned presently, and breathlessly tracked the
bloodstains across the hall and down the passage to the colonel's
room.</p>

<p>They stood in awed silence for perhaps a quarter of a minute,
and then Sarle went out and mixed himself a stiff brandy and
water. Edgehill followed suit, but Broome lingered a little
longer and covered the dead man with a sheet. Mother Heggarty was
lying down in her room.</p>

<p>"Well, that's that," said Sarle when he had gulped down his
drink, "and it's good business for us that he has gone. He's
weakened a lot in the last week, and he'd have been no use any
more to us." He looked significantly at his companion and lowered
his voice. "Now if Broome and Shillington went off, too, we'd be
quite set." A thought seemed to strike him suddenly. "What's that
damned Broome doing now?"</p>

<p>Edgehill disappeared through the curtains to return, however,
very quickly.</p>

<p>"In his own room," he informed Sarle. He grinned. "The
beggar's pretending to be reading, but he's holding his book
upside down and I believe he's crying. I've told him to clean up
the floor at once."</p>

<p>"Well," said Sarle, frowning, "we must tell Shillington
immediately, and then he'll arrange about the funeral." He smiled
grimly. "And directly that's over, the old woman'll go, too.
She'll be cleared out to the workhouse quick and lively now.
She's a filthy encumbrance here."</p>

<p>Edgehill made himself tidy and went up to Oakley Court, but he
found it was one of Dr. Shillington's consulting days in London,
and that the great man would not be back until evening, so he
wrote a brief note explaining what had happened, and handed it to
the parlor-maid with strict injunctions to give it to the doctor,
the moment he came in.</p>

<p>They passed a very subdued afternoon then at the Priory, and
in spite of the opinions of Sarle and Edgehill that it was a good
thing that Colonel Jasper was dead, although the day was cold and
cheerless, they both took care to remain as little as possible
inside the house. Instead, they sat on the bench outside,
speaking very little to one another. Broome went out fishing as
usual, and Edgehill grinned when he noticed that he was now
wearing a black tie.</p>

<p>Mother Heggarty remained in her room during the whole of the
day, and no one apparently thought it was worth the trouble to go
and inform her that her master was dead.</p>

<p>About seven in the evening Dr. Shillington was driven down and
he jumped out of the car in a great hurry, almost before his
chauffeur had brought the car to a standstill.</p>

<p>His manner was rather constrained, and it almost seemed as if
he were annoyed because the death of Colonel Jasper had been so
sudden.</p>

<p>"I shall have to get another medical man to come with me to
certify the cause of death," he said irritably, "for after all
that's happened, it would not do for me to appear in the matter
by myself. So I'll come down again with Dr. Bellhouse, of
Kelvedon, early tomorrow, and I'll arrange with my usual
undertakers, Samuelson &amp; Beane, of Colchester, to make all
proper arrangements for the funeral. We want as little fuss as
possible, and they shall take away the body to their own mortuary
after dark to-morrow. They shall be here, say, at 7 o'clock
sharp." He addressed himself particularly to Sarle. "You've been
through all his papers, of course?"</p>

<p>Sarle shook his head. "No, we've not touched anything," he
said. He frowned as if he were rather embarrassed. "As a matter
of fact, we've not been in the bedroom again since we discovered
he was dead."</p>

<p>"But Good Lord! man," exclaimed the doctor testily, "it's the
first thing you should have done. There may be his will, and it's
vital to know where he's left his property. We can't keep his
death secret any time at all, for he had relations and was in
constant communication with one niece, I know. He has lawyers too
in London, and they may come nosing about, as well.
Besides&mdash;&mdash;" and Dr. Shillington appeared quite angry
now, "we don't know what dangerous documents he may not have been
hiding. He might for instance have been keeping memoranda about
the places we have raided, and after that fool butler of mine
keeping a diary, I should never be astonished if he had one as
well." He glared at Sarle and Edgehill. "Yes it was very
thoughtless not to have gone through his things at once. I don't
understand you."</p>

<p>The two seemed quite taken aback at the doctor's vehemence.
They had passed a very unpleasant day and their nerves were not
by any means up to concert pitch.</p>

<p>"I did think of it," Edgehill said sullenly, "but his keys are
in his pocket and he's too damn messy to go over. His clothes are
stiff with blood."</p>

<p>The doctor looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Messy!" he sneered, "and you, who knifed that poor painter in
Colchester the other day are afraid of a little blood!
You&mdash;afraid?"</p>

<p>"We don't mind the blood of our own kills, Shillington," said
Sarle calmly, "but it's your damned trade to fiddle among the
clothes of a diseased wretch who's coughed himself to death.
Yours and that of the police." His voice rose a sudden fury. "So
stop your ranting and do your dirty work if you want to,
yourself."</p>

<p>The doctor calmed down instantly. There was a menace in
Sarle's face that he did not like.</p>

<p>"All right," he said curtly. "I'll do it straight away," and
he walked at once to the direction of the dead man's room.</p>

<p>And outside, Bob Jameson, the doctor's chauffeur sat
fidgetting in the car. It was a cold and bitter night and he
wanted his tea badly. He had done the fifty and odd miles from
London since five o'clock, and then just when he had put away the
car and been in the very act of opening a bottle of beer, round
to the garage had come Dr. Shillington and ordered this instant
journey to the island. It was so inconsiderate of his employer.
He would never wait a moment when he wanted anything for himself,
everything must be done at once.</p>

<p>And now, his master was over here on this blinking island, it
might be an hour and more before he would be ready to return
home. He would have no thoughts for his hungry chauffeur. He
would be only thinking of himself again.</p>

<p>The chauffeur kept glancing round at the massive door of the
Priory. He longed ardently for the sight of a wide widening gleam
of light. It might mean his master coming out or it might
mean&mdash;it had happened once or twice before&mdash;a stiff
dose of good whisky from the generous Colonel Jasper, who always
treated everyone as a perfect gentleman should.</p>

<p>But no&mdash;no light came from the front door, it was as dark
and gloomy as the entrance to a cellar&mdash;preferably to the
imagination of Bob Jameson, a wine cellar, or a cellar where big
cool casks of beer were kept.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;suddenly from the darkness on the other side of
the car came a low voice, and the chauffeur heard someone
say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dim your lights down, old man, will you? I've got a
particular message to give you in the dark. Dim them down,
quick."</p>

<p>Astonished at being addressed from the darkness, the chauffeur
nevertheless did as he was bidden, and then a face thrust itself
through the window of the car.</p>

<p>"Recognise who I am?" asked its owner, and then as the
chauffeur started back, it went on quickly, "No, don't move, old
chap. I'm Fred Mason, and it's quite all right. I wouldn't harm a
mouse, let alone a good pal like you. Look here," and the voice
was now only a hissing whisper, "do you want to earn
&pound;50?"</p>

<p>"Gord!" exclaimed the astonished chauffeur. "It's you, is it?
And why the blazes did you bunk away? The police have been
looking all over the place for you, and they say there's a reward
out, too."</p>

<p>"And &pound;50 of it is yours," snapped the supposed Mason
quickly, "if you only do as I tell you, and it's as easy as
opening a bottle of beer."</p>

<p>The delicious comparison went home like the scoring of a
bull's eye, and the chauffeur of Oakley Court was instantly at
his ease.</p>

<p>"And I'll do it," he swore earnestly. "I'll do it, I promise
you."</p>

<p>"Well, listen," whispered Larose, "and remember every word I
say. You're free directly you get back, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, directly I've had my tea," admitted the chauffeur
cautiously, "I shall be free then."</p>

<p>"Oh! damn your tea," said Larose, sharply. "What's your tea
compared to fifty quid?" He put his lips close to the chauffeur's
ear. "Go into Colchester on your bicycle instantly after you get
back and put a London call through from the General Post-Office
there. It's a deadly secret I'm trusting you with and you mustn't
breathe a word to a single soul." He thrust a paper through the
window. "Ask for that number, and when you get it, ask to speak
to either of the two men whose names are at the top of the paper
there. If they are not in, leave the message written underneath
for them, to be given them the instant they come in. Give the
message slowly, word by word, and for God's sake don't you make a
mistake." Larose made his voice quiver. "I'm calling for help,
old man, and if I don't get it, I shall be cold meat by this time
to-morrow night. It all depends on you."</p>

<p>"But what's up?" asked Jameson, rather frightened. "Why don't
you come back with the governor and me, now?"</p>

<p>"Good God," exclaimed Larose in real consternation. "If he
knew anything about me I should be as good as dead already." A
stern note crept into his voice. "He's a bad man, Jameson, that
master of yours."</p>

<p>"Too right he is," exclaimed the chauffeur fervently. "A
regular swine."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Larose sternly, and his words rapped out now
like bullets from a machine gun, "I'll be quite frank with you,
Jameson, I'm not a butler at all. I'm a detective from Scotland
Yard, and I am down here looking for the murderer of poor Jakes."
He gritted his teeth menacingly. "I'm a detective, you
understand, and by gosh, now, after I've told you that, it'll be
ten years penal servitude for you if you let us down." He gripped
the chauffeur fiercely by the arm. "Take that in, you're one of
us now, and if you fail us, it's treason against the Crown."</p>

<p>"All right, all right," said the chauffeur trembling. "I'll
play fair. I'll do everything you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Larose sternly, "not a drink now&mdash;not a drop
until after 7 o'clock to-morrow night, and then you can swim in
it. And not a word, I tell you, to a soul. If you speak, then I
shall be murdered and you will be responsible for my death, and a
murderer in the eyes of the law. There will be no mercy for you,
there&mdash;&mdash;" but the door of the Priory opened suddenly,
and like a shadow he glided away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV. &mdash; THE MARSH GIVES UP ITS DEAD.</h2>

<p class="first">DR. SHILLINGTON was very thoughtful as he was
being driven away from the Priory, and many times his small eyes
blinked frowningly under his bushy puckered brows.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a good thing at any rate that Jasper's gone," he
mused, "for there's one less of them now to deal with, but I
don't understand at all why there were no papers of importance in
that safe. On the face of it, it looked to me as if it had been
hurriedly rifled directly he was dead, and yet I don't believe
for a moment that either Sarle or Edgehill did it. They were not
acting when they denied touching the body, for they're both
obviously bound by that strange mental kink that one sees in so
many people of their kind. No fear of the living, but an absolute
terror of the dead." He stirred uneasily in his well-padded seat.
"Well, if not Sarle or Edgehill, was it Broome or the old woman."
He shook his head. "No, quite unthinkable with both of them.
Broome in his present state is incapable of any secretive
actions, and the old hag's mentally dead already." He sighed
heavily. "Yes, it's very mysterious and there's another mystery
there, too,&mdash;&mdash;" He was scowling blackly now. "Why the
devil didn't they all die last week when they ate those
mushrooms. Edgehill's message was that they had eaten them and
enjoyed them, and he's much too heavy minded to be sarcastic.
Then if they ate them, why didn't they die? There were enough
poisonous ones there to kill a dozen people. I'm sure I got the
right ones, for there's no mistaking those red spots, and
churchyards are always the favored places where they grow." He
shook his head again. "And they certainly can have no idea what I
intended for them, either. They never discovered anything for
they showed no animosity against me just now. Sarle was only rude
and irritable because his nerves are upset, and Edgehill was just
the same as usual. Broome never spoke to me, but then I didn't
expect he would. Broome&mdash;&mdash;" The doctor's thoughts were
turned suddenly into another channel. "Now, why didn't Sarle say
anything about Broome's mental state, and why didn't he bring up
again about his being put away. Sarle's as obstinate as a mule
when he's got any idea to his head, and he can't have forgotten
it. And why, too, didn't he give me any news about Bull? Well,
well, I suppose he can't think of nothing now but Jasper's death.
A man who has followed the sea hates to have a corpse to the
house. He's got the superstitions of a servant girl."</p>

<p>Suddenly the doctor scowled again. "But I'm tired of them, and
they're a menace to me. I must find some way of getting rid of
them quickly. I should be quite safe then, but as it is, with
them here, there are several things that make me uneasy. What are
the Scotland Yard people doing, and why is the resumption of the
inquest being postponed for so long? Why doesn't the chief
constable ever ring me up now, and why have all the newspapers
with one accord ceased any reference to everything that we've
ever done? Why does Smithers stare at me when she thinks I'm not
looking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The car gave a sudden swerve to one side of the road, "and why
the hell does the fool here drive like that? He wobbles about as
if his nerves were all unstrung, too."</p>

<p>The car drew up at last before the front door of the court and
Dr. Shillington got out.</p>

<p>"Don't leave the garage, Jameson," he said coldly, "I may want
you again tonight."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," mumbled the chauffeur, but his master could
certainly not have thought it 'very good' if he had seen his
servant's face.</p>

<p>The man was ghastly, and his lips were tremulous as if he were
in drink.</p>

<p>He drove the car into the garage without mishap, however, but
then made no attempt to get out, continuing to sit on where he
was.</p>

<p>"And what the blazes am I to do now?" he asked himself
hoarsely. "The old swine says I'm not to leave the garage, and
yet I swore to that 'tec chap I'd go straight into Colchester at
once."</p>

<p>He sat thinking for some minutes, and then, as if still
uncertain what to do, he got out of the car, and walking shakily
over to a cupboard, took out a bottle of beer and a glass.</p>

<p>"Can't please both of them," he remarked with a sigh, "but at
any rate I'll have a drink before I do anything. Blow the damned
'tec, he'll never know."</p>

<p>He had one glass, then another, and finally he finished the
bottle.</p>

<p>The generous liquor upon an empty stomach made a different man
of him. His face lost its pallor, his lips ceased trembling, and
a confident and assured air took possession of him.</p>

<p>"Fifty quid," he remarked cheerfully, "and I'll be a rich man.
I'll risk it, anyhow, and old Shillington can go to hell if he
wants me. I'll slip away at once before he gets the chance of
finding me."</p>

<p>So he wheeled his bicycle quickly out of the garage and in
such a hurry was he to get away that he forgot to turn out the
lights of the garage, and instead left them all burning.</p>

<p>His dinner over, Dr. Shillington went to the telephone and
rang up Kelvedon. It was his intention to drive over there and
see Dr. Bellhouse straight away, but he wanted to make sure first
that the latter was at home.</p>

<p>He was told, however, that Dr. Bellhouse had motored up to
London that afternoon, and would not be back until after
midnight, so leaving a message that he would be obliged if his
friend would ring him up early in the morning he went into his
study and started to read before the fire.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he had a call to go over to see one of the
patients in the asylum, who had been suddenly taken ill, and
walking across the drive he noticed that the lights were on in
the chauffeur's quarters by the garage. He smiled grimly to
himself.</p>

<p>"Good," he remarked, "then by making him stay in, I've
probably saved his pocket several shillings. He'd have been down
at the public-house all the evening, otherwise."</p>

<p>It was well after 11 before the chauffeur returned, and his
condition then was such that, had Larose but seen it, he would
have been desperately worried as to how the mission he had
entrusted to him had been carried out.</p>

<p>The man was covered in mud, was minus his bicycle, and drunk.
He had wanted to fight the sleepy gatekeeper when the latter had
been roused reluctantly from his bed to let him in, and long
after the lodge door had been banged to in his face, he had
carried on a noisy and one-sided argument as to who was the
better man, imparting at the same tine many strange and varied
items of startling information.</p>

<p>He was a 'tec now, he had shouted, a blooming Scotland Yard
man, and he was arresting him, the gatekeeper, on the morrow at
seven p.m. sharp. Old Shillington had corpsed it, and it was a
damned good thing for everyone, too. The butler, Freddy Mason,
had come back, and was being buried in the morning, and he
(Jameson) was to be the best man. He must set a couple of bob
somehow to buy a wreath and he wasn't going to spare any expense
either, because he had got ten fifty-pound notes in his other
trousers up at the garage. He was a blasted millionaire.</p>

<p>He had banged and shouted until happily for the gatekeeper's
desire for sleep, it had suddenly commenced to pour with rain,
and disconcerted then by the drenching he was receiving, he had
zig-zagged home to the garage and finally rolled just as he was
into bed.</p>

<p>The paper Larose had given him he had dropped in the last of
several public-houses he had visited upon his way home, and the
curious publican and his wife had puzzled over it for quite a
long, long time after the house was closed. But they could make
nothing of it, and in the end had come to the conclusion that it
must have something to do with some crossword puzzle or some
society treasure hunt.</p>

<p>In the meantime Detective Inspector Carter had received one of
the greatest shocks of his life, and with the least possible
delay had passed on that shock to his friend and colleague,
Detective Inspector Stone.</p>

<p>Entering his room in the Yard a few minutes after nine that
night, he had found a message for him lying upon the desk, and as
he read it he had stood speechless and dumbfounded in his
amazement.</p>

<p>"Message 'phoned at 8.53 p.m. from a public call office in
Colchester, it ran. 'Given by man who refused to furnish any
name, and who seemed from his voice and speech to be slightly
under the influence of liquor. Man asked for Mr. Eli Carter or
Mr. Charles Stone, and then upon being informed they were
unavailable, had left message to be given to either of them at
the earliest opportunity. Insisted message was urgent. Message as
follows':&mdash;</p>

<p>"Written in haste by young man who had not taken out a licence
for his gun, and is now lame in one foot but full of pep.
Consumptive broke blood vessel and died this morning.
Undertakers, second and eighteenth letters of the alphabet,
coming tomorrow evening at seven sharp. Finalise matters boldly
at same time. Lunatic and old woman harmless, but others very
dangerous. Remember lemons. No suspicion, however, as yet, and no
watch kept. Back door will be unlocked and all O.K. if you see
milk pail outside. Pounds will take care of themselves, but
reason backwards and seize other coins without hesitation. Have
evidence all complete. Stratford, Epping and Colchester. Hope it
will be your chauffeur's lucky fortnight. Fifty pounds cash for
the man who 'phones this. He is a fine fellow. Message ends."</p>

<p>"My God!" he exclaimed. "It's from Larose and he's alive."</p>

<p>Clapping on his hat, he rushed out of the building, and in
half a minute was being driven furiously to where Stone lived in
Finsbury Park.</p>

<p>He found his colleague in the bosom of his family and just
finishing a savory supper of tripe and onions.</p>

<p>"Quick, Charlie," he exclaimed breathlessly, "I must speak to
you at once," and accustomed to all sorts of interruptions,
without a word Stone led him immediately out into another
room.</p>

<p>"Now, Charlie," said the lanky detective, "I found this on my
desk,"&mdash;he looked at his watch&mdash;"just twelve minutes
ago." An anxious look crossed into his face. "What do you make of
it?"</p>

<p>Stone took the paper that was held out; and instantly, as his
eyes fell upon the first words, his face hardened to a frozen
mask of immobility. He stood like an image, and it seemed almost
that he hardly breathed.</p>

<p>For a long time then there was silence, and Carter sank down
into an armchair, without, however, for one second taking hie
eyes off his companion's face. He watched with the intenseness of
a man who had a great issue at stake.</p>

<p>Presently Stone looked up, he drew a deep breath, nodded his
head gently, and then smiled a slow, dry smile.</p>

<p>"He's risen from the dead, Eli," he said, with a suspicion of
a choke in his voice. "It's the boy, all right, of course."</p>

<p>"It's no fake, Charlie?" queried Carter, frowning. "You think
it's all right?"</p>

<p>"Certain," replied Stone emphatically. "Note the personal
touches which only you and I can understand. 'Young man who had
not taken out a licence for his gun'&mdash;remember how I chipped
him that first day when we were going down to Oakley Court in the
car? And then, 'Hope it will be chauffeur's lucky
fortnight'&mdash;that refers to what I told him about our man
running over someone every other seven days. Both things put in
on purpose to convince us of the genuineness of the message." the
big man frowned as if he were very puzzled; "but how he comes to
be alive to send it to us, God only knows."</p>

<p>Carter looked very puzzled too. "Well, give us a cigarette,
old man," he said, "and sit down. We'll go through it word by
word and think what it all means."</p>

<p>Stone sat down beside him and then, with their heads very
close together, they went through the message again.</p>

<p>"You see, Eli," said Stone after a few moments, "it's as clear
as daylight that Larose didn't hand in this message himself, and
it's perfectly certain that the man who handed it in was not in
his confidence. In everything he's wanting to tell us, he's
covered up his meaning so that it will convey as little as
possible to any chance person who may get hold of it. He tells us
he is lame to explain to us why he is not able to get in touch
with us himself. The consumptive is, of course, that Colonel
Jasper. The undertakers are a firm whose names commence with the
second and eighteenth letters of the alphabet&mdash;that means B
and S, of course, and he leaves it to our gumption to find out
whom the firm are. The medical man who attended Jasper would
naturally suggest which undertakers to call in, and so they will
be Shillington's without doubt, and either in Colchester or
Chelmsford, or somewhere near, we shall find the 'B and S' firm
we want. Then he tells us to get into the Priory as the
undertakers' men and make the arrests. Also, that reference to
pounds taking care of themselves and reasoning backwards to seize
other coins, means&mdash;" the stout detective hesitated,
"means&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Arrest Shillington at the same time," snapped Carter.
"Shillings come behind pounds, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," exclaimed Stone, smiling. "We are to seize all the
gang."</p>

<p>"But it's a great risk our striking now in this way, Charlie,"
said Carter thoughtfully. "We are trusting everything to that
young man. As far as our knowledge goes, up to the present, there
are many links in the chain of evidence to be picked up before we
are sure."</p>

<p>For a few moments Stone made no reply. He drummed restlessly
with his fingers upon the table, and was evidently thinking hard.
Then he looked round at Carter and said very slowly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Eli. Let you and I just try and get a good
grip of the whole situation. With that message of Larose before
us, let us try and determine in some way what his surroundings
were when he wrote it; why he left so many blanks for us to fill
in ourselves, and finally whether we are justified or not in
staking both our reputations as he advises us to, upon this one
single throw."</p>

<p>The stout detective paused as if to weigh his words most
carefully, and then went on. "Now Larose has been missing for
exactly sixteen days, and the first thing we shall ask ourselves
is, where has he been all the time. Has he been held as a
prisoner or has he been voluntarily absenting himself from us?
Take this latter supposition first."</p>

<p>"I don't think he's kept away on purpose," commented Carter
promptly, "for when he tells us he is lame, as you say, he is
giving us the reason for his inaction."</p>

<p>"Exactly," exclaimed Stone again; "it can't mean anything
else. Then if he's not communicated with us before, simply
because he wasn't able to do so on account of a lame foot, then
he's not been the prisoner of these men. That's clear. The two
things can't have been preventing him at one and the same time.
Now, can they?"</p>

<p>Carter shook his head, and Stone went on. "No, I'm certain
he's not been a prisoner, and yet it's impossible for us from the
information at present in our possession to in any way surmise
what actually can have happened to him to make everything fit in
with that message. That gang were responsible in some way for his
disappearing, we have agreed long ago, if only on account of the
lies that Shillington told us as to what happened on the night of
the dinner party." He frowned in perplexity. "Well, if they
didn't kill him, and he's not been their prisoner, then what the
devil has happened?"</p>

<p>There was a long silence again, and then suddenly Stone's face
cleared, and he rubbed his hands together like a delighted
child.</p>

<p>"Ah! it comes to me," he exclaimed triumphantly. "I'm
beginning to see light." He grinned across to his companion.
"This gross body of mine is functioning properly now, and my old
brain has got the right wave-lengths at last." He leant forward
and tapped his colleague confidently on the arm. "He's not a
prisoner, Eli, and, what's more, the gang don't know either that
he's alive or where he is."</p>

<p>"Oh," commented Carter, rather sarcastically, "they don't know
where he is, and you do?"</p>

<p>"Sure," replied Stone, in great good humor. "I can locate him
within fifty yards." He looked round as if to make sure they were
alone, and lowered his voice to a whisper. "He's living there in
the Priory among them&mdash;in one of those empty rooms."</p>

<p>Carter spoke very quietly. "You're no fool, Charlie, and no
one knows that better than I do." He frowned irritably. "But what
the hell do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Look here," said Stone sharply. "Why is his message so
mysterious, and why doesn't he start off at once by telling who
and where he is? Why doesn't his message read, 'I'm Gilbert
Larose, I'm speaking from such-and-such a place, and I've got
Sarle, Edgehill &amp; Co. all boxed in and ready for you to come
and truss them up?' Now why doesn't he speak to us like that?"
Stone glared impressively at his colleague and slowly punctuated
every word. "Simply because if his message had miscarried, Eli,
if it had fallen into wrong hands, the plain and naked
information it would have conveyed would have come boomeranging
back, and everything would have been all up with him at once." He
thumped on the table. "Yes, he's too near the gang to risk
anything, and he gave them no chance of enlightenment if the
message went wrong. It was to be made impossible for them to
learn who was speaking, and where he was speaking from if the
message were thrust even under their very eyes." The detective's
voice was very solemn. "They believe Larose is dead."</p>

<p>Carter looked doubtful. "And you mean, Charlie," he said
slowly, "that if the gang had got hold of this message they would
have been no wiser as to who had sent it or where the sender was?
They would have no idea in either case?"</p>

<p>Stone smiled. "Yes, that's what I mean," he replied, "and
also, that his hiding-place is so near to them that the utmost
precaution had to be taken."</p>

<p>"But how do you know he's living with them in the Priory,"
asked Carter, frowning, "in those shuttered rooms, above?"</p>

<p>"By the information that he gives us," replied Stone, without
an instant's hesitation. "To tell us what he does, he must be in
some position where he can both see and hear everything that is
going on, and that can surely only be in the very house among
them."</p>

<p>"Humph!" remarked Carter drily, "you've a very nimble brain,
Charlie Stone."</p>

<p>"He knows Jasper is dead," snapped Stone quickly, "and how he
died. He hears the names of the undertakers given, and the time
when they are to come for the body. He is aware of the murders at
Stratford, Epping and Colchester, and also we may confidently
presume from his mentioning these places, who committed them. He
warns us Sarle and Edgehill are dangerous, and Broome and the old
woman harmless." The big detective raised his hand impressively.
"Well, that means continued observation, doesn't it, and a good
knowledge of their habits and dispositions for a man of Larose's
caution to speak with such assurance. Then what else does he say?
Remember lemons. Now what can that mean but that he was an actual
eye-witness somewhere of the whole shooting incident? And then he
tells us that the back door will be unlocked for us when we come
and he will put a pail outside to assure us that all is right. He
adds also that the gang have no suspicion as yet, and that
moreover they keep no watch." Stone thumped again with his hand
upon the table. "Why, it's as clear as daylight that he's been
shadowing the gang all this time, and in that case he can only
have been doing it from those empty rooms above. Now, can you
think of any other place?"</p>

<p>Carter sighed. "It's deducing a great deal from a very little,
Charlie, isn't it, but then&mdash;" and his face broke into an
approving smile, "I wouldn't like to say you're very wrong."</p>

<p>"I'm not wrong at all," said Stone emphatically, "so we'll go
straight ahead now and make all arrangements to do as he says. We
shall know at once if we're on the right track directly we get in
touch with those undertakers. We shall see
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But one moment, Charlie," interrupted Carter quickly. "One
thing I will not agree to, and that is arresting Shillington,
yet." He shook his head emphatically. "We have not enough
evidence to justify us there, and must wait first and see what
cards Larose holds. Shillington's far too big a man to lay hands
upon until we're quite sure. The Chief was telling me this
afternoon that he'd just been talking over the 'phone to the Home
Secretary, and the Secretary had mentioned incidentally that
Shillington's name would probably be found in the forthcoming
honor's list, for eminent services rendered to the State. They
had been talking about the butler's murder at Oakley Court."</p>

<p>Stone looked rather crestfallen. "Whew!" he whistled, "that's
awkward." He snapped his fingers together. "But all the same, I
have every faith in Larose, and after two words with him, I am
sure we shall be able to add the great man to our bag." He looked
at his watch. "But now to details, Brother, we have a lot to
arrange and I guess it will be late before either of us get to
bed."</p>

<p>Exactly twelve hours later, Sarle and Edgehill were standing
outside the Priory awaiting Dr. Shillington's car that at that
moment was coming down over the marshes.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's got another man with him," said Sarle as the car
reached the farther bank, "and I suppose it's the other doctor
from Kelvedon." He turned sharply to his companion. "Now, mind,
not a word to Shillington either about Bull or Larose. He ignored
us for a whole week for some reason and I'm not disposed now to
tell him anything more than we can help. He'd only have another
of his blue funks, and&mdash;damn him&mdash;I don't somehow trust
him any longer. I'm sure he'd like to get rid of us. He's a
danger to us now."</p>

<p>"Well, you know my views," said Edgehill carelessly, "and when
Broome's back in an asylum, we must do in the old quack in some
way." He waved round to the long vistas of glistening mud on
either side of the causeway. "Was there ever a better dumping
ground anywhere to dispose of a body?"</p>

<p>The car drew up before the Priory, and Dr. Shillington and
another man got out. The latter carried the usual professional
black bag.</p>

<p>"My friend, Dr. Bellhouse, of Kelvedon," introduced the
doctor. "He's very kindly come over at once."</p>

<p>The men shook hands and Sarle led the way into the house.</p>

<p>"Anyone cleaned up the body?" whispered Dr. Shillington to
Edgehill, as they followed behind. "I meant to have told you last
night to have it done."</p>

<p>Edgehill nodded curtly. "The old woman's done it, I believe,"
he replied. "I heard her whimpering in his room this morning, and
I shouted to her to give him a wash. I heard her pouring water
into a basin later, so I expect she did it."</p>

<p>The two doctors went into the dead man's room.</p>

<p>"One of Shillington's flunkeys," sneered Sarle. "You can see
he's frightened of him; he'll do anything he says."</p>

<p>The two medical men came out in a few minutes, and Dr.
Bellhouse referred sympathetically to what had occurred.</p>

<p>"It must have been a shocking hemorrhage," he said, "and he
couldn't have lived for more than a couple of minutes afterwards.
Dreadful thing, tuberculosis. Your friend was a fine man,
once."</p>

<p>They stood chatting together for a few minutes, and then all
went outside.</p>

<p>"Very lonely place you've got here," remarked Dr. Bellhouse,
looking round. "It must be very bleak in the winter."</p>

<p>"Plenty of fresh air," remarked Sarle grimly. "Come and look
at the sea at the back. You don't often find big rocks on the
Essex coast," and the four strolled round in the direction
suggested.</p>

<p>In the meantime Jameson, Dr. Shillington's chauffeur, had been
left waiting in the car in anything but a happy frame of mind.
He'd got a splitting headache, the legacy of the previous night's
debauch; but apart from that he was very worried.</p>

<p>In spite of his continual grumbling he was quite aware that,
all things considered, he had got a very comfortable situation at
the court, and he was fearful now that in taking in that message
to Colchester the previous evening he had done something that
would imperil his position, should it become known.</p>

<p>Fred Mason, the one-time butler, had said bluntly that the
doctor, of all people, was not to know about the message, and
that meant without a doubt that it was something of which the
doctor would not approve.</p>

<p>Well, then, was he, Bob Jameson, being made a catspaw of, and
would it end in him getting the sack with nothing to show on the
other side? Of course, he had not forgotten the promised fifty
pounds, but that was only a promise, and when he came to think of
it, he doubted if Fred Mason were worth fifty pounds. He had
never looked like it, certainly, and he had never, indeed, looked
like a 'tec, either; he had always looked to him, Bob Jameson, a
regular softy and worth, at the most, a couple of pints of
beer.</p>

<p>Yes, the chauffeur was very worried, and he was half-inclined
to make a clean breast of everything to his master the very next
time when he got him alone.</p>

<p>Broome came out of the house at that moment and interrupted
his train of thought. He came straight up to the car and spoke
curtly.</p>

<p>"Got a newspaper?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the chauffeur, and he stared curiously,
wondering if this man, too, were in the plot.</p>

<p>Broome made no comment, but he did not go away. Instead he sat
down on the footboard on the far side of the car, away from the
house, and picking up a piece of string, began twiddling with it
with his fingers. He stared out over the marshes and blinked his
eyes as if he were very tired.</p>

<p>Then suddenly another shock came to the worried chauffeur, as
he heard a stern hard voice speaking from somewhere behind the
car.</p>

<p>"Don't move," it said sharply. "Don't turn your head. Keep
exactly as you are and when you answer me don't move your lips.
It's Fred Mason speaking." There was a second's pause, and then
the voice went on. "Now did you take that message I gave you last
night?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur shivered. He was a weak man, and when sober the
slave of the last person who got hold of him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he mumbled. "I took it in."</p>

<p>"And did you speak to either of the men I wanted?" went on the
voice.</p>

<p>"No," almost groaned the chauffeur. "But the chap I spoke to
said he'd see they would be told at once."</p>

<p>"And did you repeat the message exactly?" came next, "word for
word as it was written down?"</p>

<p>"Yes," whispered, the chauffeur, "I never made one
mistake."</p>

<p>"All right then. You'll get fifty pounds to-morrow," and the
voice faded away.</p>

<p>The chauffeur knew that Broome must have heard every word, and
a horrible sick feeling came to him in the pit of his stomach. He
wiped over a clammy forehead with a clammy hand, and wondered
tremblingly what was going to happen next. But he was not given
much time to consider for his master and Edgehill at that moment
came sauntering round the corner of the house, whereupon Broome
got up at once and strolling over to the form by the porch,
seated himself there in a bored and absent-minded manner. He was
still twiddling with the piece of string.</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington and Edgehill brought themselves to a
standstill, but they made no attempt at conversation. Edgehill
yawned an immense yawn.</p>

<p>"Heard anything from Bull yet?" asked the doctor presently,
and he frowned as if some unpleasant memory had been stirred in
his mind.</p>

<p>"No," replied Edgehill slowly, "things have been very quiet
here."</p>

<p>The conversation languished, and then Edgehill said suddenly,
"What's the matter with that damned chauffeur of yours? He's
staring at us as if he were terrified about something."</p>

<p>"He was drunk last night," replied the doctor drily, "and I
expect that's his trouble. It is extraordinary," he added, "but
his potations never make any difference to his driving. I found
that out soon after he came to me, or I shouldn't have continued
to employ him."</p>

<p>Edgehill frowned and walked up to the car; the doctor followed
after him.</p>

<p>"What are you glaring at me for?" asked Edgehill truculently.
"Is there anything about me you don't like?"</p>

<p>Broome rose up quietly from the form and stood close near to
the open door of the Priory. He seemed hesitating whether to go
inside.</p>

<p>The chauffeur was very shaky. "No-o, sir," he stammered, and
he looked anxiously at his master.</p>

<p>"Well, what are you afraid of then?" asked Edgehill. "You're
frightened about something?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Then what the devil is it, man?"</p>

<p>"It's Colonel Jasper, sir," and Bob Jameson looked as if he
were almost going to slide out of his seat. "I'm always afraid
when anyone dies."</p>

<p>Instantly then Dr. Shillington thrust himself up close to the
car. "And how do you know colonel Jasper is dead?" he asked
fiercely. "Who told you he was, now?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur took a good grip of the door of the car. "You've
got your book of death certificates with you, sir," he said
faintly. He pointed behind him. "It's on the seat there. Colonel
Jasper looked very ill when I saw him the other day, and these
two last times when we've called here he's not come out, so I
thought&mdash;" he almost broke down, "I
thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're lying," broke in the doctor savagely. "Someone's been
gossiping here. Now, who is it? Say, at once."</p>

<p>The chauffeur's voice shook. "I don't know, sir. I
really&mdash;" his voice wavered. "I was took all of a heap last
night when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dr. Bellhouse and Sarle appeared round the corner, and the
former was holding his watch in his hand.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, Dr. Shillington," he said, speaking very
hurriedly and with an apologetic air. "But I ought to be going at
once. I'm due at Mark's Tey at Eleven. I have an anaesthetic case
there then. I had no idea the time was getting on so."</p>

<p>For the moment Dr. Shillington could not restrain a gesture of
annoyance at being interrupted, but instantly again he wreathed
his face in agreeable lines.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said smiling, and he opened the car door. "We
don't delay another minute."</p>

<p>Broome moved back to the form and sank down again.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," called out Dr. Shillington, "I'll come in to-night." Dr. Bellhouse raised his hand and off the car went across
the marsh road.</p>

<p>"Damn!" swore Edgehill, as he and Sarle returned into the
house, "that Kelvedon chap's left his box of tricks behind," and
he picked up the black professional bag.</p>

<p>It was unlocked, and opening it curiously, he saw that amongst
other things it contained a large bottle of ether, almost full,
and a much smaller bottle labelled 'Chloroform.'</p>

<p>"Gee-whiz!" he exclaimed in heavy humor, "now what about
putting Broome and the old woman to sleep and adding them to the
undertaker's bag tonight. We've got all the dope here."</p>

<p>"Bah!" replied Sarle, scornfully. "It wouldn't be worth it.
We'll be rid of them both as it is in twenty-four hours. I'll put
the screw on Shillington this evening, and it'll be the asylum
and the workhouse for them tomorrow. I'll stand no nonsense now
Jasper's dead." He took down a rod from off the wall. "Come on,
and let's go out and fish. This damned house smells like a
butcher's shop to me."</p>

<p>They went outside and passed Broome, who was still sitting on
the form. Sarle gave him a vicious kick on the shin as he went
by, and Edgehill supplemented it with a hard pull on the ear, but
the object of their indignities took not the slightest notice.
His face had a stupid, vacant look, and he continued to play on
with his piece of string.</p>

<p>"It's funny," remarked Edgehill, as he walked away, "but as
Shillington says, a lunatic never feels much pain. You should
have kicked harder if you wanted to make any impression."</p>

<p>"I did my best," replied Sarle carelessly, and then suddenly
he scowled and gritted his teeth. "But I'm thinking I'll black
his eyes for him tonight when they've all gone. I'll get back
some of my own and make the idiot squeal."</p>

<p>"Good!" remarked Edgehill. "I shall enjoy it. It'll be a bit
of fun."</p>

<p>He looked back over his shoulder. Broome was still playing
with the piece of string.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; BROOME SPEAKS.</h2>

<p class="first">AT twenty minutes to seven that night Dr.
Shillington 'phoned sharply for his car, and five minutes later
was being driven down to the Priory.</p>

<p>He had not referred again to the matter of his chauffeur's
knowledge of the death of Colonel Jasper on the island, and the
latter was devoutly hoping that he had forgotten it. At any rate,
Bob Jameson, fortified now with a hearty tea which had included a
heady bottle of strong beer, was quite a different being from the
panicky and empty-stomached creature of the morning. He was
inspired again, too, with faith in his old pal, Fred Mason, and
in consequence was prepared now to father as many more lies as
might be necessary. Already he felt a crisp &pound;50 note
rustling in his pocket.</p>

<p>The night was warm and muggy, and a ghost-like mist steamed up
from the marshes and wrapped round the island. There was a faint
moon showing, but, seen through the haze it accentuated the
dreariness and desolation of everything.</p>

<p>"The very night for carting stiff 'uns away," was Mr.
Jameson's mental comment, and he thanked his gods for the
comforting qualities of good beer.</p>

<p>"A quarter to seven," he added, looking at the clock upon the
dashboard, "and now we shan't be long. Something's going to
happen, and Bob Jameson, Esquire, will be in the front row."</p>

<p>The tide was off the causeway, and the tyres squelched
unpleasantly in the mud as the car crossed over.</p>

<p>"Hoot once," said Dr. Shillington sharply, "and then park away
from the door. There'll be another car here almost at once."</p>

<p>The door of the Priory opened, and a beam of light shot
through the mist. Dr. Shillington entered the house, and the door
was closed to behind him.</p>

<p>"I thought it would look better if I came," he said. "It was
not necessary, but people talk; and, after all, Jasper was one of
my friends; also I want Dr. Bellhouse's bag. He's 'phoned me he
left it here this morning."</p>

<p>"It's there," grunted Edgehill, pointing to a side table.
"There is a bottle of ether and a bottle of chloroform in it.
They are stinking the room out now."</p>

<p>Dr. Shillington opened the bag and took a perfunctory look at
its contents. Then he put it down upon the floor against the
wall. "Well, mind I don't forget it," he said, and sitting
himself down, he lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>A strained silence followed.</p>

<p>Sarle fidgeted about in his big armchair, Edgehill threw
himself back upon the settee, changing his position uncomfortably
every moment, and the old woman in the corner sat with bowed
head, as if she were saying her prayers.</p>

<p>There was no fire and the only illuminant was the big oil lamp
suspended by a long chain from the ceiling.</p>

<p>Suddenly the curtains by the passage parted, and Broome walked
into the hall. His appearance, among the untidied surroundings of
the place was startlingly incongruous for he was in immaculate
evening dress. His coat was cut in the latest fashion, the crease
of his trousers was exactly in the middle, and his collar and tie
were of the most recent styles. As far as his clothes were
concerned, he looked the perfect type of a refined and courtly
English gentleman.</p>

<p>His face, however, belied his otherwise general
attractiveness, for its expression was vacant and almost that of
an imbecile. His eyes were heavy and half closed, his mouth
gaped, and he looked altogether in the grip of a profound
melancholia.</p>

<p>He walked slowly to the chair he usually occupied, and sinking
down into it, folded his hands together and stared listlessly
before him.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" ejaculated Edgehill, leaning upon his elbow in
his excitement. "Now, just look at that. Did you ever see
anything like it, and to think that he'll be frying fish in a few
minutes."</p>

<p>Sarle turned his head away in contempt, but Dr. Shillington
regarded Broome with an interested professional stare.</p>

<p>"What's he been like lately?" he asked after a moment's hard
scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Getting worse and worse every day," Edgehill replied. "He
does some work sometimes when we kick him to it, but he doesn't
speak much now. Today I don't think he's said a single word."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said the doctor after a pause, "I'll get
him certified. He shall be taken away."</p>

<p>Sarle looked round at once. "But not tonight, Shillington," he
said quickly. He flashed a meaning look at Edgehill. "Tomorrow
will be soon enough."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," said the doctor, with his eyes still
upon Broome. "I shall have to get Dr. Bellhouse in again. He'll
sign the certificate with me." He looked round at Edgehill. "But
how did he get that cut on his lip, do you know?"</p>

<p>"That cut on his lip!" repeated Edgehill, as if he had not
noticed it before. "Oh! Yes, I remember. He hit himself against
the door yesterday. He's been very clumsy lately, and is always
knocking himself about." He winked slily at Sarle. "He must be
covered with bruises, especially on his shins, but he doesn't
seem to feel any pain, for he never complains."</p>

<p>"Ah!" remarked the doctor, and he stared hard at Broome
again.</p>

<p>The minutes passed in silence, and then Sarle, looking up at
the clock exclaimed irritably&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ten minutes past seven, Shillington, and I thought you said
they would be here at seven, sharp."</p>

<p>The doctor looked at his watch. "You're thirteen minutes fast,
my friend," he remarked calmly. "It is still three minutes to the
hour. They are a most reliable firm, and never fail me. I am
confident they will be here on time."</p>

<p>Sarle glanced over his shoulder and scowled. "Well, some
damned fool's left the back door open," he said. "I can smell the
mist coming in," and he rose up sharply from his chair and passed
out through the curtains.</p>

<p>"He's jumpy," remarked Edgehill with an uneasy grin. "He
doesn't like a corpse being in the house."</p>

<p>"Death is a very natural thing," remarked the doctor
ponderously, "and it is a mistake to regard it as anything
unusual."</p>

<p>"Oh! is it?" replied Edgehill, with an attempt at jocularity.
"Well, it hasn't struck me in that light yet, and when it happens
to me I shall regard it as the most unusual episode in all my
life." He jerked his thumb in the direction of Broome. "That
damned fool said the other day that there was a death coming here
because he'd seen a rook upon the window sill."</p>

<p>"Really!" smiled the doctor contemptuously. "The angel of
death, I presume, about to flap its wings. Well, there was a rook
at my study window yesterday, and&mdash;&mdash;" he shrugged his
shoulders, "I am still alive. The superstitions of even
intelligent men are often&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off suddenly
and lifted his hand, "Hark! here they are."</p>

<p>The droning sound of a motor was heard in the distance; it
grew louder, its note changed as the car dropped into the
causeway, it increased in volume again, and finally the grinding
of brakes announced that a car had come to a standstill
outside.</p>

<p>Edgehill flung open the doors and the light shone upon quite a
big sized black van.</p>

<p>A solemn looking man stepped briskly down from the seat next
to the driver, and taking off his hat, approached respectfully to
where Dr. Shillington was standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>"To the minute, sir, as you ordered," he said, "and we've
brought the closed van. It will attract less attention as you
wished."</p>

<p>"All right," said the doctor, "we don't want any fuss."</p>

<p>The driver dimmed his lights and got down, there were sounds
of movements at the back of the van, and a minute later, a big
coffin was being borne in slings into the Priory. It's four
bearers walked with their heads bent down, and in the slow and
measured footsteps of their trade.</p>

<p>An awed silence, the awed silence of death gripped upon
everybody in the hall, and the old woman in the corner bowed her
shawled head lower than ever.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there was a startled exclamation, and the voice
of Edgehill rang out like a clarion call&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look out, Sarle," he roared, "they're not undertakers. Mayer,
the detective's here," and in the splitting of a second he had
put the table between him and the bearers of the coffin, and was
tugging at his hip for his automatic.</p>

<p>But if he had been quick, the solemn looking man who had been
following behind the bearers was quicker. He literally flung
himself across the table, and impinging sideways upon Edgehill
with great violence, brought him down upon the floor. Edgehill
was unbalanced by the imprisonment of his right hand in his hip
pocket.</p>

<p>Then for a few seconds pandemonium reigned. The coffin was
lowered to the floor with a celerity that suggested careful
rehearsal, and the four brawny men were upon Edgehill, too. He
had no chance at all. He was gripped as in a vice, he was jerked
to his feet, his wrists were handcuffed behind him, and one of
the detectives, producing a length of cord, proceeded deftly to
tie his ankles.</p>

<p>Carter and Stone came rushing in. "Got them?" shouted the
former anxiously.</p>

<p>"One," replied the solemn looking man, breathing hard. "He
spotted Mayer and was drawing his gun. We had to go for him."</p>

<p>Stone took a lightning glance at Edgehill.</p>

<p>"Guard the door, one of you," he shouted, "and the rest of you
follow me; the other man's in the house in the back there," and
with his automatic ready, he started to rush across the hall.</p>

<p>But a voice of thunder came from behind the curtains that
concealed the entrance into the passage.</p>

<p>"Stop!" it cried fiercely. "Stop, everyone of you, and hands
up, or I fire. Stop, I tell you. I've got you all covered, and
you're dead men if you take another step."</p>

<p>Stone gasped in consternation, but instantly he pulled himself
up with a jerk and stood stock still. The other detectives
followed suit. They were all brave men and proved in danger, many
times, but they measured with their eyes the twenty and odd feet
or so that stretched between them and the curtains, and in a
lightning flash reckoned up the odds against them.</p>

<p>They would have to go round the big table, they were in the
full light of the lamp; their enemy was in darkness, and,
moreover, they did not know exactly where he stood.</p>

<p>Stone went ghastly in his rage. His eyes glared, his nostrils
dilated, and his face exhibited the baffled ferocity of a wild
beast that had suddenly found itself caught in a trap.</p>

<p>"Hands up!" roared the voice again. "Hands up, or I fire.
One&mdash;two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put 'em up, boys," called out Carter briskly. "He's got the
drop on us, and it'll be only wasting good lives;
besides&mdash;&mdash;" and his voice was stern and menacing, "he
can't get away, the place is surrounded everywhere by now."</p>

<p>In obedience to his command, but with scowling faces, they all
held up their hands, and then the voice came sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Drop that gun, Stone. I see you. Drop&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stone's automatic fell on to the floor with a crash.</p>

<p>Quite a long silence followed, and then the curtains parted
slowly and Sarle stepped into the hall.</p>

<p>His face was deathly pale and glistened in perspiration. His
lips were tightly closed, his eyes burnt like live coals, and he
looked the very incarnation of a devil without mercy. He held a
large automatic pistol before him, a little above waist high.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he sneered, "the Iron Man and the unrepentent
perpetrator of many crimes!" His tone changed, and his words
rapped out like shrapnel. "Unloose my friend instantly. You,
there, with the red hair, and no tricks, or I'll shoot you in the
stomach."</p>

<p>And then suddenly the amazing thing happened.</p>

<p>Old Mother Heggarty sprung up from her chair. "Rush him!" she
shrieked, "rush him, his gun's no good." and tearing off the
shawl that enveloped her head, she darted forward to suit her
action to her words.</p>

<p>But in her eagerness she tripped up in her skirts, and
crashing heavily to the ground, her head struck the leg of the
table and she lay still.</p>

<p>Two seconds followed, not more, and then a wild exultant shout
came from Stone.</p>

<p>"It's Larose, boys," he roared, "and it's all right if he says
so; come on."</p>

<p>He dropped his hands and leapt forward in one movement,
charging round the table to reach Sarle.</p>

<p>Sarle's arm came up like lightning, and he pressed on the
trigger of his automatic. Once, twice, and then a look of blank
consternation crossed into his face. He pulled on the trigger a
third time, and then in furious rage he hurled the useless weapon
point blank at the head of the oncoming detective. But Stone
ducked, and it missed him, and the next second the two were
grappling together.</p>

<p>But it was an unequal struggle, and soon over, for the other
detectives had followed hot-foot after Stone, and quicker almost
than it takes to tell, Sarle was handcuffed and trussed up in the
same way as Edgehill.</p>

<p>Immediately then, Stone rushed over to the prostrate Larose,
and gently lifted him up on the sofa.</p>

<p>"Poor lad," he said, with a suspicion of huskiness in his
voice, "but, good God! how ill he looks."</p>

<p>"I'm not hurt much," said Larose faintly. "I'll talk to you in
a minute." He tried to lift up his head. "But look after
Shillington," he muttered. "Don't let him go."</p>

<p>"All right, laddie," nodded Stone. "We're seeing to that.
We've got our eyes on him." He bent down and whispered, "But are
there any more in the place now? Have we got them all?"</p>

<p>Larose gave a faint smile. "Yes, Charlie," he whispered back,
"you've cleaned up the lot."</p>

<p>And in the meantime Dr. Shillington had been an astounded
spectator of all that had happened. The appearance of the police
and the arrests of Sarle and Edgehill had been like the fall of a
thunderbolt before him, but the resurrection of Larose had for
the moment bereft him entirely of coherent thought, and all he
could do now was to stand blinking furiously and biting upon his
lips.</p>

<p>But the voice of Carter roused him from his stupor. "Don't go,
please, Dr. Shillington," called out the detective sharply. "We
want to speak to you first."</p>

<p>Instantly then he pulled himself together. His life's work
among the insane had trained him to act quickly in all
emergencies, and now with the first shock over, thought rushed
back furiously into his numbed brain, and he was at once the cold
and clear-thinking doctor of the asylum again.</p>

<p>He reddened in anger at the peremptory tone in which the
detective was addressing him, but he sat down coolly into a chair
and took out a cigarette.</p>

<p>"I had no intention of going," he replied calmly, "for I shall
be interested, without doubt, when I am enlightened as to what
this all means." He added with dignity&mdash;"I am here, I would
beg you to understand; purely in my capacity as a medical
man."</p>

<p>"Very good," replied Carter drily, and then he turned and
pointed Broome out to one of the detectives. "Well take him, too.
He's half a lunatic, I understand, but we may be able to get
something out of him for all that. Handcuff him, as well."</p>

<p>And then came another surprise, and a surprise that this time
included everybody in the hall.</p>

<p>Broome rose up from the chair where he had been sitting, a
calm spectator of all the proceedings, and smilingly approached
the tall detective.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Carter," he said, with a polite bow,
"but I would have you know that I am quite as sane as you are at
the present moment. It is unhappily a fact that I was a mental
case last year, but there has been no relapse since. I assure
you, and to-night&mdash;&mdash;" He looked round and
smiled&mdash;-"I am in as perfect possession of all my faculties
as any of you here." He drew himself up with dignity. "There is
no need to handcuff me. I shall be quite quiet, and it is my
intention to help you all I can."</p>

<p>Carter started in astonishment at him, and half suspecting
some trick, was at first minded to repeat his curt order to his
assistants, but Broome's appearance was altogether so gentlemanly
and so prepossessing that he hesitated, being unwilling to
inflict unnecessarily the indignity of the handcuffs. Glancing
round then to find what Stone's opinion might be, his eyes
happened to fall upon the bound prisoners, and then instantly his
thoughts were switched off into quite another direction.</p>

<p>He saw that both Sarle and Edgehill were looking so
surprised.</p>

<p>They were staring fixedly at Broome, and the incredulity upon
their faces were now super-imposed, even upon the expressions of
sullen fury that had hitherto possessed them. Edgehill, in
particular, looked the very picture of astonishment. He had got
his mouth wide open like a dumbfounded child.</p>

<p>"Good," thought Carter, "then, at any rate, they are not in
the joke," and he turned back again at once to Broome.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the latter quietly, "I admit I have been acting
lately with the express purpose of making everyone believe that I
was qualifying again for the asylum, and I've certainly had to
put up with a very unpleasant time in consequence." His voice
rose in anger, and he pointed sternly to Sarle. "That man there
is one of the cruellest criminals unhanged, and he was thinking
that he would inflict dire physical sufferings upon me after the
undertakers had gone to-night. He's been gloating over the idea
all day."</p>

<p>"Oh! And you were going to submit to it?" asked Carter
curiously, and sparring for time, because he could not still make
up his mind.</p>

<p>Broome laughed scornfully. "I didn't believe I was in any
danger," he replied, "for I didn't think he'd get the chance. I
expected something was going to happen to him tonight, as I knew
your Mr. Larose had sent out a message for help by Dr.
Shillington's chauffeur. I heard them talking about it this
morning and the man said then, that the message had got through.
He's going to receive fifty pounds for taking it."</p>

<p>The silence in the room was almost painful, and Broome was the
centre of all eyes. Larose was in a sitting position now, and was
staring at him as if he were a ghost.</p>

<p>"And besides," went on Broome in an even conversational tone.
"I was sure that things must be happening very soon now, for Mrs.
Heggarty's been dead more than forty-eight hours and her body
under the straw behind the wash-house is beginning to be
unpleasant. It couldn't remain undiscovered much longer."</p>

<p>The veins on Sarle's forehead stood out like knotted cords and
it looked almost as if he were going to have a fit.</p>

<p>"Good God!" groaned Larose audibly, "but what a fool I've
been."</p>

<p>"Not at all, Mr. Larose," smiled Broome politely, turning
round. "You impersonated the old woman very well. But you made
two mistakes. I smelt you had been smoking once when I passed
you, and again, I saw you put sugar in your tea, which Mrs.
Heggarty never did." He shrugged his shoulders. "Little things,
of course, but they helped to give you away."</p>

<p>He stopped speaking for a moment, and again a hush fell upon
everyone. The face of Sarle was now as inscrutable as that of a
sphinx, but Dr. Shillington was gnawing savagely at his lower
lip.</p>

<p>"Well," went on Broome briskly, "I'm going to turn King's
evidence now and earn some of those thousand pounds rewards. I've
done no violence anyhow, and the worst you can lay to my charge
is the blowing up of a few safes. Oh! one thing," he added
quickly. "Don't let Dr. Shillington go. He's as deep in
everything as any of them. He murdered his butler right enough,
and only last week he tried to kill us all here with poisonous
mushrooms. He brought down a dishful for our consumption, but I
was suspicious about them, and picked out the dangerous ones.
I've got them in my bedroom, still. He's a very bad man."</p>

<p>"And you've been with the gang, then, all along?" said Carter
sternly, breaking into the further silence that followed.</p>

<p>"Yes, most of the time," admitted Broome quite frankly, "but
upon the night when they were going to murder Mr.
Larose&mdash;Sarle here would have tortured him if he hadn't
escaped&mdash;I made up my mind to break with them. Things were
getting too bad, even for a man whose finer feelings had been
blunted in an asylum, and as I have explained to you, I laid my
plans accordingly." He nodded towards Sarle and Edgehill. "Now, I
can put you in the way of securing evidence enough to convict
those gentlemen many times over." He hesitated a moment. "I might
perhaps have been inclined to hold my tongue but they've been so
brutal to me that I'll keep back nothing now."</p>

<p>"And who are they, then?" asked Stone quickly. "Are Sarle and
Edgehill their real names?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Broome at once. "I'm certain of that, although I
can't tell you who they are. But Sarle's been in prison in France
for five years, and Edgehill's been convicted for some offence in
Carlisle. I've heard them talk about the prisons they've been
in."</p>

<p>Stone regarded him very sternly. "And where has that big man
gone who came here on the night of Tuesday of last week?" he
asked. "He came on a bicycle which he left in the marshes, and he
never went back. We took his bicycle, and we are sure he's not
left the island since."</p>

<p>"That was Bull, another murderer," replied Broome instantly.
"He came to tell them that he'd drowned a man and woman called
Tilley, and he claimed a hundred pounds each, which Sarle was to
give him for the murders."</p>

<p>"Well, where is he?" asked Stone.</p>

<p>"But didn't one of your men shoot him?" exclaimed Broome,
looking surprised. "We found his body upon the sands two days
afterwards, and he'd been shot through the back of the head."</p>

<p>"Found his body upon the sands!" ejaculated Stone
incredulously. "Two days after he'd come here, and he'd been
pistolled, you say."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Broome, "and we all thought it was one of your
lot who had shot him."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Stone. "We don't do things in that way." He
jerked his head round in the direction of the handcuffed men.
"Now didn't they kill him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied Broome emphatically. "He was working
for them and left here that night, after all details had been
thought out, with the avowed intention of killing a married
couple at Epping who had seen Sarle after he had murdered a
doctor there. Sarle was to give him &pound;200 if he got rid of
them, and he and Edgehill were both terribly frightened when they
saw his body."</p>

<p>"Oh! they were, were they?" said Stone thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, very frightened," replied Broome. He looked
questioningly at the stout detective. "Then if you didn't kill
him, somebody else did."</p>

<p>Stone flashed a quick glance at Carter and then lowered his
eyes. "What did they do with the body then?" he asked after a
moment's pause.</p>

<p>"Towed it out to sea and sank it," replied Broome. "Sarle said
there must not be an inquest at any cost. They
took&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But suddenly Dr. Shillington sprang to his feet and, swinging
up his arm, dashed something with great violence to the floor in
the middle of the room. There was a crash of broken glass.</p>

<p>"Look out!" he shouted excitedly. "That's ether vapor and it
will catch fire. It's worse than petrol. Put out the lamp
instantly or we shall all be burnt to death.
Quick&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>The sickening smell of ether filled the air, and with a curse
Carter, who was nearest to the lamp, pulled down the
extinguisher, and the room was plunged immediately into total
darkness.</p>

<p>"Flash your torches," he roared. "Look after the prisoners and
grab Shillington, someone. Open the door and windows and there'll
be no danger then. We shan't be sent to sleep."</p>

<p>But the surprise had been so sudden that they none of them had
got their torches ready, and they all shouted directions and got
in each other's way.</p>

<p>When finally order had been restored and the lights were
flashed, it was found then that the asylum doctor was nowhere to
be seen.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; THE WAYS OF DEATH.</h2>

<p class="first">THE mist had closed down and it was very thick
outside, and Dr. Shillington had no difficulty in getting away
unseen from the precincts of the house.</p>

<p>He knew the lie of the land quite well, and, plunging
confidently into the solid wall of vapor, was swallowed up
immediately. Three yards away he would have been invisible to
anyone who had tried to follow, and so, with no apprehension that
he was in danger, and clutching tightly to a bottle of chloroform
that a minute before had been reposing in Dr. Bellhouse's bag, he
ran at an easy pace in the direction of the sea.</p>

<p>A couple of hundred yards or so from the house, however, he
slackened down to a quick walk.</p>

<p>"And so this is the end," he said with a choke in his voice.
"I must destroy myself." He spoke quietly and with no bitterness.
"With the evidence of that man, Larose, corroborated as it will
now be by Broome, it would be madness for me to harbor the
slightest hope that I could evade complicity in most of what has
taken place." He tried the cork of the chloroform bottle to make
sure that it would come out easily, "Well, I am fortunate in
having this. Chloroform narcosis is a pleasant form of dying, and
five minutes now should see the end of everything." He frowned
angrily. "But what an ignominious phase of my career! A man of my
attainments to be running hatless from uncultured policemen like
a common thief. But I deserve it. I ought to have cut myself
adrift from the Priory people long ago. I see now that I have
been out of my element among them all along." An unpleasant
thought came into his mind. "But I suppose any brother alienist
becoming aware of my association with them at all, would have
considered me as mental any time during the past year." He
sighed. "Well, perhaps he would have been right. Possibly I have
been mental and am still. Certainly, my powers are failing or I
should not have been deceived as I was by that clown, Broome. It
was terrible judgment on my part to be taken in, and quite
unpardonable in a man of my experience." He sighed again and more
heavily this time. "Yes, with my reputation as the greatest
alienist of my generation as yet unchallenged, it is best that my
life's work should be done. I will end off here."</p>

<p>He reached the sea shore; the mist was much thinner there, and
a hundred yards away he could see the outlines of some big rocks.
He looked stealthily round, but he was quite alone.</p>

<p>He quickened his pace again, and at a sharp run reached the
rocks. Then, knee-deep, he waded into the sea and climbed up upon
the rock that was farthest from the shore. It was a long flat one
standing about a foot out of the water.</p>

<p>"Now, let me make no mistake," he muttered. "There must be no
scandal brought upon my profession, and I should not like my
sister to know either, that I have been the companion of men who
are going to be hanged. I must just disappear and with any good
fortune my body will never be found. The water is low now, but
the tide is coming in. In half an hour it will take my body and
the undercurrent should sweep me out to sea." He went quickly
through his pockets. "No, there is nothing here that can give any
clue to my identity, and two days among the conger eels should
make me quite unrecognisable."</p>

<p>He took off his coat and folded it up quickly into the shape
of a square cushion. Then he undid his braces and, slipping them
off, tied the coat close upon his face. Then stretching himself
down at full length upon the rock, he uncorked the bottle of
chloroform and, without a second's hesitation, poured out its
whole contents upon the folded coat.</p>

<p>"Now for it," he muttered, and his heart beat quicker. He drew
in deep heavy breaths as if he were eager to get everything over.
"Only a man who has not used his reason," he went on, "is afraid
of death, for death is peace and rest, and there is no pain
there." He smiled grimly. "But how easily are we all brought to
an equality, the great ones and the small. A few whiffs of
synthetic vapor, a few grains wrung from the metallic substances
of the earth, a few minims distilled from the common flowers of
the field, and we are at once all stiffening flesh together, like
the felled ox or the sheep after the knife." His voice became
drowsy. "But to think of a man of my distinction having to die
like this&mdash;I who am the greatest master in my field of work.
I have been a benefactor to human kind. I&mdash;&mdash;" a swift
spasm wrinkled up his face, "but I have been their enemy as well
and, judged by common standards, I suppose my decease is
overdue." His thoughts came much more slowly, but with an effort
he shook his head. "Yes, of course I have been mad&mdash;mad to
have touched crime and lawlessness at all. It is clear to me now.
I have lived all my life among madmen and I have become as they
are, myself." His voice sank lower and lower. "Yes, I have
touched pitch and&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;defiled."</p>

<p>His muttering ceased, his breathing became more shallow, and
finally he lay quite still. His jaw dropped and all his muscles
relaxed.</p>

<p>He was as motionless as the rock upon which he lay.</p>

<p>The sea came up presently and flowed over him. It washed him
from the rock and he disappeared.</p> <hr> <p>The following
morning Larose had a long interview at Scotland Yard with the
Chief Commissioner of the Police. Carter and Stone were present,
and the Chief had a report of the former before him.</p>

<p>"Well, I must say, Mr. Larose," smiled the Commissioner
presently, "that you have done yeoman service for us. We shall be
able now to trace back everything that the gang have done and
arraign these two men upon many more charges than are necessary
to ensure that they shall suffer the extreme penalty." He looked
thoughtful. "But are you quite sure that the evidence of this
third man, Broome, will be reliable?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," replied Larose at once. "He will make an
excellent witness, too, for he is the most intelligent of them
all." The detective sighed. "It will always rankle in me how I
was deceived there."</p>

<p>"And you had no idea then at any time," smiled the
Commissioner, "that he was aware the woman was dead, and that you
were impersonating her?"</p>

<p>"No, none whatever, sir," replied Larose ruefully. "You see, I
took him all along for exactly what he intended the others should
take him for, a man with a bad mental history, gradually
reverting to his old condition again, and when the woman died and
I was in her place I felt more secure with him than with anybody
else."</p>

<p>"You ran a great risk," said the Chief Commissioner shaking
his head. "Your life would not have been worth a moment's
purchase if they had found you out."</p>

<p>"But not so great a risk as you might think, sir," answered
Larose, "Sarle and Edgehill detested the old woman, and never
looked at her. They said she put them off their food when they
did, and besides," and he grinned cheerfully, "I had the only
serviceable automatic in the Priory. I had filed the hammers of
all the other ones, so that they were quite useless."</p>

<p>The Commissioner laughed heartily. "You are a great artist,
Mr. Larose," he said, "and put in some very finished work. Your
sojourn in that house as an uninvited guest is almost an epic in
its way, and I admit quite frankly that I cannot think of one of
our men here who would have had the imagination to have
undertaken it."</p>

<p>"But I had to, sir," Larose laughed back. "It was forced upon
me for as I have told you I was too lame to get away."</p>

<p>"Well, you were ready to make of each set-back some great
achievement," said the Commissioner. "I'll put it that way. Every
misfortune that Fate handed to you, you made a stepping stone to
some success." He suddenly became thoughtful "But I'd like to
know now who killed that man, Bull?"</p>

<p>Larose was serious at once. "But he deserved to die, sir," he
said slowly. "He was a murderer twice over upon his own
confession, and his mission when he left the Priory that night
was to murder again. He was beyond the pale of any pity."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know that," commented the Commissioner sharply,
"but your support of Broome's story that neither Sarle nor
Edgehill killed the man, leaves us with an unsolved mystery." He
frowned in perplexity. "Now, who could have killed him, then?" He
turned round to Carter. "Our men heard a shot fired that night,
you say, at the time mentioned by Mr. Larose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, at twelve minutes past ten," replied the tall
detective, "but it was very misty, and they saw no pistol
flash."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the Commissioner. "Then it all fits in." He
turned back smilingly to Larose. "You see what intrigues me,
don't you? Thanks mainly to you, we have done so splendidly that
I am unwilling there should be even one single problem left
unsolved." He shrugged his shoulders. "We can explain everything
except the death of this man, and it is in my mind that one force
for violence is still at large and unaccounted for. I should like
to wind off the whole business so that we have complete
understanding everywhere. Now, what do you say?"</p>

<p>But Larose said nothing. He just looked innocently at the
Commissioner and blinked his eyes.</p>

<p>"And you, gentlemen?" asked the Commissioner, turning to the
other detectives, "have you no ideas, either?"</p>

<p>Carter shook his head, and Stone looked away without meeting
his superior's eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, one thing more," said the latter after a few moments'
pause, "I should not be sorry&mdash;" he hesitated. "I should not
be sorry if Dr. Shillington never fell into our hands." He
sighed. "The scandal would be so great."</p>

<p>"But he's dead, sir, I am sure," said Larose earnestly. "He's
had twelve hours of freedom, and as many minutes would have given
him sufficient time to take his own life." The detective spoke
with supreme confidence. "You see, sir, when I was acting as
butler at Oakley Court I had complete opportunity of forming an
estimate of Dr. Shillington's character, and of one thing I am
certain, he would go to any lengths rather than fall into our
hands. He was quite mad, of course, in his association with the
gang, but he was sane enough in other things, and he was very
proud. He would never face disgrace."</p>

<p>"And you think that he never escaped from the island, then?"
asked the Commissioner.</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "It was impossible, sir, that he could
have crossed the river," he replied. "Mr. Carter will tell you
that."</p>

<p>Carter nodded. "Yes, quite impossible," he said. "He got a
bare minute's start, and the causeway was closed to him even
before that&mdash;long before he could have had time to run as
far. There were two service cars stationary on the further bank,
with lights full on, and even with the fog, not a dog could have
got by. Then in ten minutes the fog had lifted and we were able
to flash lights over the surface of the whole river bed. The mud
was quite unbroken, and as he would have had to wade waist high
to get across, we should have seen clear indications of his
passing." The tall detective was emphatic. "No, there was only
one way he could have escaped, and that was by the open sea. All
night there was a cordon round the island on the river side and
at daybreak every foot of the island itself was gone over."</p>

<p>"And you are quite certain," asked the Commissioner, "that he
didn't get away in a boat?"</p>

<p>"Quite," said Larose, answering this time. "I know there have
never been more than three boats on the island, and they are
still all there now."</p>

<p>"And your suggestion of self-destruction," asked the
Commissioner, "what of that?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Larose, "there is a bottle of chloroform missing
from that Kelvedon doctor's bag, and it could be only Dr.
Shillington who took it. He knew it was there along with the
bottle of ether, for after Edgehill had mentioned it, not a
quarter of an hour before, everything happened, I saw him open
the bag and glance at its contents." The detective lowered his
voice impressively. "Then if he took the chloroform he could only
have done it in those few seconds of darkness after the lamp had
been extinguished and before the torches were flashed, and if he
did take it then, he took it at the dreadful risk of not being
able to get away with it afterwards."</p>

<p>"You mean," said the Commissioner, frowning, "that he
considered it so vital to get possession of the chloroform that,
risking everything, he delayed his flight until he had groped for
the bag in the dark and got out the bottle."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Larose, "that's what I mean."</p>

<p>"With the purpose in his mind, of course," added the
Commissioner, "that he was going to bring about his own
destruction immediately."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Larose again. "He risked everything for
that."</p>

<p>The Commissioner's eyes twinkled. "And mightn't he have had
the bottle in his pocket all the time, Mr. Larose? Mightn't he
have snatched it out of the bag at the same time as he took the
ether?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Larose emphatically. "Talking it over, we
are all agreed that when he shouted to us to put out the lamp he
was standing empty-handed. Besides, Detective Mayer, who was
nearest to him, says that when the doctor first opened the bag he
bent down to make only one lightning grab and then he sprang
erect and hurled the ether."</p>

<p>"Humph!" remarked the Commissioner, "then upon this eagerness
of Dr. Shillington at all risks to obtain this chloroform, you
base the certainty that he is not now miraculously in hiding, but
is dead?"</p>

<p>"Upon that and my knowledge of his character, sir," replied
Larose.</p>

<p>"Very good, then," said the Commissioner, "and now where's his
body?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that, too, sir," replied Larose, "and am
sure it must have been carried out to sea. The tide was just on
the flow last night at the time when he escaped, and if he put
himself to sleep by the margin of the waves, long before the tide
was high it would have swept him round the point and into the big
deeps out to sea." The detective made a wry face. "I have not
lived for a fortnight above three enthusiastic fishermen without
learning something about the currents round that coast. They are
very strong, and there is a great undertow."</p>

<p>There was a silence for a few moments and then the
Commissioner said thoughtfully. "Well, we'll hope for the best,
and for the sake of his profession, that Dr. Shillington does not
turn up again, alive or dead." He shook his head. "He was a great
doctor, but a very bad man."</p>

<p>And the Chief Commissioner of the Police had no further
anxiety on that score, for nothing more was ever heard of the
master of Oakley Court. The sea was faithful to it's trust, and
the conger eels did not give up their dead.</p>

<p>In due time both Sarle and Edgehill were tried, convicted, and
hanged. Sarle for the murders of Isaacstein the Jew, and the
Epping doctor, and Edgehill for the murder of the painter at
Colchester.</p>

<p>They received the extreme penalty of the law within a few days
of each other.</p>

<p>Sarle met his death in contemptuous silence. He gave neither a
good word nor a bad one to anyone, and appeared up to the very
last to be bored with the whole proceedings.</p>

<p>But Edgehill went out in a very different way. Laughing and
joking with the warders, he ate heartily and enjoyed his
breakfast as if he were in a restaurant instead of the condemned
cell, and with his last breath he sent his kind regards to "that
prince of crime-trackers, the mug-faced looking Gilbert
Larose."</p>
