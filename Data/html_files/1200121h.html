WITH CARRINGTON THROUGH RHODESIA</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand),
August 14, 1900</h3>

<p class="cp">GOING UP BY THE MASHONALAND RAILWAY</p>

<p>Twelve people in a railway carriage, bound northward&mdash;a
carriage constructed exactly like a London tram-car, only not
half as comfortable, with a narrow seat running down either side,
and a still narrower luggage rack above. A sleepy negro boy in
limbo and fez squatting on the platform at the end of the
carriage, and as the train turns a curve a glimpse of a dozen
plumed khaki figures in an open truck ahead.</p>

<p>This is on the road to Marandellas, Sir Frederick Carrington's
first camp, and is somewhere between Bamboo Creek and
Mandegos.</p>

<p>The passengers are: three Portuguese officials, who swap lies
with many gesticulations and much noise&mdash;stories generally
of how they got the better of Somebody Else, illustrated by
killing imitations of Somebody Else's voice, manner, despair, or
indignation, delivered with raucous gusto; two nondescript
individuals who "know every inch of the country" and are walking
gazetteers of Rhodesia, but are otherwise perfectly harmless;
three fever-stricken railway men stretched out on rugs spread on
the floor of the carriage&mdash;uncomplaining, haggard Englishmen
on their way to the Umtali Hospital with their annual dose of
malaria; a Buluwayo stockbroker returning from England; a German
lady tricked up in faded finery who speaks English, French, and
Portuguese with suspicious fluency; and myself.</p>

<p class="cp">WHERE HAVE WE MET?</p>

<p>Does the lady object to smoking? The lady does not, and on the
strength of that tries to open a conversation. Hadn't she met me
at Beira? No; then perhaps it was in Paris&mdash;then perhaps in
London? I emphatically deny ever having met her either in London
or in Paris, or, in Timbuktoo&mdash;or in Port Said either; which
last crushed her and caused her to relapse into silence for at
least ten minutes. The nondescripts open a tin of lunch tongue,
and the elder and more decayed finds a bottle of
brandy&mdash;these are their provisions for the three days'
journey to Salisbury. They had also some aged crabs, which they
stored beneath the seat and forgot all about. The passengers
detected these during the night and thought it was the swamp.</p>

<p>"You remember the Massi-Kassi raid, don't you, sir?"</p>

<p>This, after the third application of the three-starred
reviver, and is addressed to the stockbroker.</p>

<p>"You talk about raids," went on nondescript senior, glaring at
the unoffending and unconscious Portuguese trio, " why, when the
blooming Portygese raided our blessed territory what did we
do?"</p>

<p>Nobody volunteered to answer this.</p>

<p>"I know,"&mdash;triumphantly&mdash;"because I was with Colonel
Heyman&mdash;and it was only in '90. Why; if we had our rights
the whole of the Portygese territory would be
Rhodesia&mdash;though Heaven knows it is only fit for dagoes and
niggers."</p>

<p class="cp">NATURE IN ABANDON</p>

<p>One looks out on the country rolling past. Great stretches of
grassy land, with here and there a clump of trees and the gleam
of a distant river winding through the mangoes. Very beautiful
for the eye to see, but the grass hides a swamp reeking with
malaria, and every night brings the fever-laden miasma. Now the
train winds through a tangled mass of jungle and
undergrowth&mdash;a veritable botanical garden run wild. Here
rises from the interlacing bush bamboo, and creeper, the gaunt,
white, lifeless branches of a thorn tree; here, growing amidst
the bananas and wild tomatoes, is a clump of lordly palms: It is
Nature in abandon. A covey of partridges rises with a whirr from
beneath the very wheels of the locomotive, and a zebra crashes
through the jungle and appears for an instant on the crest of a
rise, and is gone.</p>

<p>"There was forty of us," went on the speaker, pausing a moment
to protest against the nondescript minor's appetite, "or it might
have been forty-one. Jim Harvey was there. You remember Jim
Harvey, the butcher of Salisbury, don't you, 'Arry? Turned miner
and blowed hisself up with a dynamite cartridge down at the
Geelong&mdash;or it might have been at Shangani&mdash;anyhow,
he's dead. Well, there was forty of us, and up come the Portygese
army, and that about 900 strong, with six machine guns, while we
only had a seven-pounder."</p>

<p>This was interesting, for my friend the stockbroker had given
me a confirmation of these facts in an undertone.</p>

<p>"We was on a hill, somewhere north of Massi-Kassi&mdash;old
Massi-Kassi, I mean, not the place they call Macequece
now&mdash;go easy with that meat, Jim, we shan't get anymore this
side of Umtali&mdash;and when the colonel saw the army coming he
hid the seven-pounder in a tent, and made all of us except
seventeen lie down in the bush."</p>

<p class="cp">FEVER</p>

<p>One of the sick men on the floor groaned, and clasped his head
between his long white hands.</p>

<p>Nondescript junior leant over and felt the dry, burning skin
with a touch begotten of experience.</p>

<p>"Hi, boy "&mdash;this to the squatting attendant on the
platform&mdash;"<i>Manzi.</i>"*</p>

<p class="footnote">[<i>Manzi</i> (Zulu)&mdash;water. ]</p>

<p>Then he fumbled in his pockets till he discovered the remedy,
which, being put up in 5-grain tabloids, is easy to carry.</p>

<p>"Quinine is a useful thing," went on the elder man, "if you
don't take too much. I take whisky myself. Well, up come the
Portygese Governor, and he kow-tows to the Colonel. 'Hullo!' he
says&mdash;he had left his army at the foot of the hill. 'Hullo,'
he says. 'Do you know where you are?' &mdash;and all the time he
was looking round to see how many guns we had.</p>

<p>"'Rather fancy I do,' says the Colonel, winkin' at me. 'I
haven't taken the sun yet, but I'm under the impression that I'm
somewhere off the stormy isle of Massi-Kassi.'"</p>

<p class="cp">A QUESTION OF FRONTIERS</p>

<p>"'You'll find it pretty, stormy if you don't clear,' says the
Gov'nor, having reckoned up our strength on his fingers and seven
of his brass buttons. 'Don't you know you're in Portygese
territory,' he says.</p>

<p>"'Can't say that I do,' says the Colonel.</p>

<p>"'Well, consult your map,' says the Gov'nor.</p>

<p>"'Don't put no faith in maps says the Colonel; 'fact is, I'm
in the map-making line myself. Many's the little bit if Africa
I've helped to make red,' he says.</p>

<p>"'Well,' says the Gov'nor, thinking of his six machine guns at
the foot of the hill and cursing hisself for not having brought a
war correspondent along with him to describe his glorious victory
in the morning. 'Well,' he says, 'the top of this hill will be
red enough if you ain't gone by sun-up.'</p>

<p>"'I'll think about it.' says the Colonel.</p>

<p>"'You'd better,' says the Gov'nor. 'Good afternoon.'</p>

<p>"'Won't you have a drink before you go,' says the chief. So
they had a whisky-and-soda, and as they drunk each other's health
each says to hisself, 'To-morrow morning I'll cook your goose, my
boy.' What station's this?"</p>

<p class="cp">A HALT FOR FUEL</p>

<p>It isn't a station, but a fuel halt. The fuel used on the
Mashonaland Railway is wood. At every few miles along the line
the train passes great stacks of logs placed ready for on-loading
and now and again a little saw-mill buzzing away merrily in the
forest. Timber is very plentiful in the Portuguese territory, and
this alone makes the railway workable. One strange feature of the
line is that nowhere&mdash;as far as I could see&mdash;are wood
and water loaded together.</p>

<p>We start off again with that jerk, inseparably associated with
African railways. It is getting towards evening, and the aspect
of the country has already undergoing a change. The smooth, wide
grassy plain has given place to more uneven ground from which
rise high tree-covered so many exaggerated ant-hills.</p>

<p>Through the valleys and creeping along the lowland a miasma
sluggishly laves the base of the hills and covers the swamp
ground till the kopjes* are Alps above the clouds, and one can
almost picture the slumbering village ten thousand feet
below.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<i>Kopje</i> (Afrikaans, literally "little
head")&mdash;a small hill rising up from the African veldt. ]</p>

<p>Nondescript the elder is not poetical; he eyes the mist and
shivers, and resorts once more to the cognac.</p>

<p>"I got caught in a mist like that one night, and had to sleep
in it. It was round in the Zoutpans district in the Transvaal,
and was in 1881, long before the Transvaal was worth fighting
about, and I was in the Kimberley Hospital for five months. Well,
about the Portygese raid. That night there was happiness and
revelry in the dagoes' camp while we sat dark and silent with a
double allowance of whisky, just like the old Saxons and Normans
at the battle of Hastings.</p>

<p>"Next morning before daybreak we had the 7-pounder in position
and all the men with ammunition to hand waiting for the Gov'nor's
army to eat us up.</p>

<p class="cp">FEARFUL ODDS</p>

<p>"Up came the army&mdash;skinny little men with yellow faces
that hadn't been shaved for a month&mdash;on they came, having
first tried their machine guns to see if they would go off. I
expect the Gov'nor made a speech&mdash;'On top of the hill, my
children, there are seventeen desperate raiders. In spite of our
overwhelming odds we will attack them.'</p>

<p>"So up they came, firing wildly and charging the front of the
kopje just as though they were under an English general. Well,
somehow, they stopped when they was halfway up, and after waiting
a little while to see if we really meant it, or if it was all by
way of a joke, they went back again; leaving all their nice new
machine-guns at the bottom of the hill&mdash;we've got one in
Buluwayo to this day. After that we had a little peace, although
the war was carried on down Beira way, where the Portygese man-
o'-war fired three shots at an English ship, but gave up after
the third shot because the shock of the gun going off broke the
captain's looking-glass. Then the <i>Magicienne</i> came round
from Simonstown and wanted to know what all the trouble was
about, and the Portygese skipper looked up the <i>Magicienne</i>
in the Navy List, and finding she was a second- class cruiser
with six guns realised the horrors of war, and said he only fired
for a lark. Then a commission sat on the boundary line and gave
out that Massi-Kassi was Portuguese territory, and they're
welcome to it, for of all the fever-stricken cribs I've ever been
in the Macequece district takes the bun."</p>

<p>I have taken down my fellow-traveller's narrative almost as he
gave it. There are, I find on inquiry, many inaccuracies in it,
but the main facts are as he gave them.</p>

<p>Living among the people who helped to make history in these
parts, one learns to appreciate the labours of the many Judsons
for the English.</p>

<p class="cp">AT MANDEGES</p>

<p>The train is now rushing through the lowlands, and the white,
sticky, clinging mists swirl and sway on either side. A pale moon
stares wanly down; the plumed Queenslanders in the truck ahead
are singing appropriately enough&mdash;for we are passing through
the fly-belt&mdash;<i>The Place Where The Old Horse Died</i> and
the German lady, under the encouraging influence of Portuguese
admiration, has recovered her volubility. The train jars into a
siding which may be found marked on any respectable map of the
world as "Mandeges."</p>

<h2><a id="art02" name="art02">
THE ELAND'S RIVER GARRISON</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), September 27, 1900</h3>

<p class="cp">MEN WHO PRAYED TO BE PUT IN A TIGHT PLACE.</p>

<p>To say that they were extremely annoyed would be describing
their feelings too mildly.</p>

<p>They were very savage, they forgot themselves slightly, and
swore with force and originality. They cursed Rhodesia, they
cursed Fate, they cursed their various Governments, but mostly
they cursed their Governments&mdash;for they are a very political
people these Australians, weaned on manifestoes and reared on
Parliamentary debates. They cursed their Governments, knowing by
heart their weaknesses, and ever ready to attribute the non-
success of any undertaking&mdash;be it political, social or
warlike-to the dilatory action of certain members of the divers
Cabinets.</p>

<p>"The Government ought never to have sent us up here at all
"&mdash;a Queenslander spoke with great earnestness&mdash;"if
they wanted us to see any fighting. Got to Beira in
April&mdash;now it's June, and&mdash;"</p>

<p class="cp">THEY WERE "OUT OF IT"</p>

<p>Pretoria was occupied. This was the news which had spread the
wave of pessimism! over the little way-side camp on the Buluwayo
Road&mdash;a camp on the fringe of the long, white road which
wound south and dipped north.</p>

<p>The Sabakwe River trickled through the land, a stone's throw
from the white tilted waggons, drawn tail-board to pole to form a
rough <i>laager</i>,* and the heavy-eyed oxen stood knee-deep in
its sluggish waters.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>laager</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;a military
encampment. ]</p>

<p>North&mdash;or rather north-east&mdash;several nights away,
was Marandellas. South of that, and far, was Beira, and it was
two months ago since they had left. Two months, and Mafeking had
been relieved, Johannesburg entered, Pretoria occupied. Therefore
the Bushmen, who dreamt not of Eland's River, and to whom Zeerust
was a name in a gazetteer, grew despondent.</p>

<p>"Do you think there is a chance of fighting, sir?"</p>

<p>I could not answer the Victorian who asked, nor did I have the
heart to reprove the Tasmanian who swore</p>

<p class="cp">CAME OUT FOR A FIGHT</p>

<p>"Well," remarked the Queenslander, "all I can say is, that if
we don't see any fighting it will be a shame." He qualified
shame. "We didn't come out here to be piffled through this
country." There was an adjective before country. "If I wanted to
admire scenery I'd have stayed in Queensland. If I wanted gold
I'd have gone to Rockhampton. As for land! Well, if any of you
fellers want land I'll sell you a run of 6000 acres of the best
land in the world!"</p>

<p>They are peculiar, the men who are holding Eland's River; they
are not soldiers as we in London know soldiers; they don't like
shouldering arms by numbers, and they vote squad drill "dam
silly." They are poor marching men, for they have been used to
riding; they ride firmly, but not gracefully. The horses they
prefer are great, rough up-standing brutes that buck themselves
into inverted V's when they are mounted, and stand on their hind
legs to express their joy. The Bushman will rid a horse for a
hundred miles without thinking it anything extraordinary, and
bring it in in good condition, but he cannot go for a couple of
miles without galloping the poor brute to death. He is very
careful how he feeds his mount, and would sooner go without food
himself than his dumb friend should be hungry, but it takes a
troop sergeant-major and three corporals to make a bushman groom
his horse.</p>

<p class="cp">MEN WHO PRACTICE PATIENCE</p>

<p>They are very patient, these men; their training makes them
so. They have learnt to sit by water holes and watch sheep,
dividing their time between week-old papers and day-old lambs.
Politics interest them; war&mdash; ordinary, every-day war that
does not call for their active interference&mdash; interests
them; but the price of wool interests them more than all these
things. Russian famines distress them, Indian plagues alarm them,
but the blue staring sky and the rain that comes not make lines
around their eyes, and puts grey into their beards.</p>

<p>They have got their own method of going out to fight, and that
method is as distinct from that of the regular Tommy, as Tommy's
is foreign, to the C.I.V.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* C.I.V.&mdash;City of London Imperial
Volunteer. ]</p>

<p class="cp">WORKMANLIKE "TOMMY" AND PICTURESQUE C.I.V.</p>

<p>Tommy goes forth to battle in a workmanlike manner. He seldom
writes farewell letters, but grabs a hunk of biscuit, gives his
water-bottle a shake to see how much he has got, buckles on his
pouches and bayonet, and, with the instinct bred on a dozen
barrack squares, smooths the creases out of his stained khaki
jacket. Then he picks up his rifle and eyes it critically, jerks
back the bolt and squints up the barrel&mdash;Tommy, the workman,
is careful of his tools&mdash;pushes back the bolt, mechanically
snaps the trigger, fixes his helmet firmly on his head, and steps
out to join his company.</p>

<p>The C.I.V., when I knew him first, was somewhat self-
conscious. His rifle was clean, his bandolier was ready to put
on, his coat was nicely rolled, his puttees were evenly fixed;
long before the fall-in bugle sounded he was ready for
parade&mdash;for he was very keen. When the bugle sounded he
picked up his rifle, not carelessly, as did his brother of the
line, but reverently and with care. He adjusted his broad-brimmed
hat, he patted his bayonet to see if it was there, and went out
to face the pock-marked trenches with the proud consciousness
that, at the worst, he would make a picturesque casualty.</p>

<p class="cp">A MATCH FOR THE BOER</p>

<p>The Bushman knows his rifle as the City man knows his walking-
stick. He feels neither contempt nor awe for it. It is a
commercial asset, a domestic property. Perhaps he keeps his wife
in dresses by shooting kangaroos; perhaps he keeps himself in
whisky by tracking wallabies. His equipment is scanty. He has a
bandolier, perhaps a pouch, possibly a mess-tin, certainly a
"billy." When the parade-call goes, he falls in with his fellows
and numbers off from the right somewhat sheepishly. On parade he
is a unit and has to do as he's told, and he isn't quite used to
submitting his will to those of others in authority.</p>

<p>"Fours right!"</p>

<p>He wheels round awkwardly. If he makes a slip he causes his
horse to buck to cover his confusion.</p>

<p>"Walk&mdash;march!"</p>

<p>He is off, and he feels easier. Then comes the splitting up of
his squadron into little independent patrols, and he breathes
freely, for with a couple of kindred spirits on a scouting trip
he is a man once more with a soul of his own. He sees most things
and acts quickly. Before the "ping" of the sniper's bullet has
died away he is off his horse and under cover. Then, if the
sniper is an intelligent man, he won't move about much, for when
a Bushman has located his quarry he can lie quite still for an
hour at a stretch, his cheek touching the stock, his finger
resting lightly on the trigger.</p>

<p>These are the men who are holding Eland's River&mdash;men who
live on "damper"* and tea&mdash;and whose progress through
Rhodesia was marked by many dead horses and much profanity.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Damper</i>&mdash;A traditional
Australian soda bread prepared by swagmen, drovers, stockmen and
other travelers. ]</p>

<p>They wanted to fight badly. They prayed that they might get
into a tight place. Their prayer is answered.</p>

<p>If you knew the Eland's River garrison, you would not pity
them&mdash;you would rejoice with them.</p>

THE REBEL AND THE PSALMIST</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Poverty Bay Herald</i> (New Zealand),
February 23, 1901</h3>

<p class="cp">PORT ELIZABETH, Cape Colony</p>

<p>I have been to church&mdash;to a church in a little dorp* on
the Port Elizabeth-Graaff Reinet line, a white-washed, square-cut
kirk and ugly. A village where a handful of khaki-clad militiamen
play at guarding a bridge, and the stories of Transvaal
atrocities are believed as the Gospel.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Dorp</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;a village, a
small town. ]</p>

<p>What I heard there can be heard in any Dutch Reformed church
in South Africa&mdash;in Graaff Reinet, in Uitenhage, in Somerset
East, even, it is whispered, in effect in Capetown.</p>

<p>The dream of a United Afrikander nation is dying hard.</p>

<p>The Dutch colonists are only now grasping the significance of
their shadowy ideal and the vague, shapeless vision of a separate
national life has, in the moment of the realisation of its
hopelessness, assumed a certain tangibility. Nothing is more
patent to the most casual observer than the fact that it is only
during the past two months that the leaders of the "New National"
movement in the Cape Colony have seen the impossibility of the
fulfilment of their dream.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war a general rising throughout the
colony would have put altogether a different complexion upon
matters, but the malcontents were confident of the success of the
Republican forces and, at the worst, of European intervention,
and so they played that waiting game which so happily fits the
backveldt indolent.</p>

<p class="cp">IN THE HOUSE OF THE CHOSEN</p>

<p>Now it is that, with all the impotent rage of strong men
caught napping, platform, pulpit, and Press thunder forth
denunciation of the conqueror. Now it is that every method that
human ingenuity can devise, every effort that leaders and
interested organisers can put forth, every malignant lie
calculated to fire the blood of the unlearned and intensify the
already existing hatred, is being employed to the undoing of the
English.</p>

<p>Curious to see for myself what manner of thing a political
sermon is, I attended an evening service not far from here.</p>

<p>The church, grim and bleak, was half filled. There was no
great display of colour, no attempt at anything startling in
shape of dress. Black was the hue and home-made severity the cut.
The worshippers sat bolt upright in their uncomfortable pews, and
the boot-squeak of the comer and the occasional sniff or
apologetic cough were the only sounds that broke the silence.
There were elderly men in irreproachable broad-cloth with sombre
banded hats. There were young men greatly daring in fanciful
suits, lacking originally in cravats. Stout Boer women in
brocaded silk, and plump Dutch girls with expressionless eyes.
They came in, keeping step to the monotonous clang of the church
bell, in twos, singly, in parties, and in families, recognising
with a glance such of their friends as were already seated.</p>

<p>The bell stopped, and a little harmonium droningly asserted
itself. And then, accompanied by one of the deacons, the
<i>predikant</i> himself entered and ascended the pulpit. The
organ wailed itself into sleep, and the <i>predikant</i>*
adjusted his glasses.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Predikant</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;a
preacher. ]</p>

<p class="cp">NO NAMES</p>

<p>There were spirit and life in the hymns, many of which were
sung without as much as a glance at the book, for the
congregation had beguiled many a long evening on lonely farms and
isolated homesteads, singing them over, not so much from any
great religious zeal or piety as from that desire to kill time
which moves the convict to master the contents of his Prayer
Book.</p>

<p>Then there were lessons and prayers, chapters from the Old
Testament of people in bondage and their delivery, prayers that
this Trouble which is in the Land may pass, that the heart of the
Oppressor might be softened, that the Vengeance of the Lord might
descend and smite the Destroyer, that Israel be delivered from
the hands of its enemies, that the Philistines might be swept
into the sea&mdash;yea, even as the wind sweeps the locust.</p>

<p>The <i>predikant</i> prayed with fervour, with hands clasping
and unclasping, in agony of spirit. In his prayers he did not
refer by name to the Boer Republic; he simply asked for Divine
intervention for the Lord's Chosen. He did not speak of England;
he said Philistines and Amalekites. He did not refer directly to
Sir Alfred Milner nor Mr. Chamberlain, but with all the passion
he could command he called for vengeance on the false counsellors
who had initiated the persecution of the people of the land. He
prayed, and the congregation punctuated his prayers with deep
sighs and amens, and I, a Philistine in the House of the Chosen,
sat and wondered why this fervour, this undoubted earnestness,
had hot been directed towards Paul Kruger in the days when a word
from the Dutch churches in South Africa would have prevented the
war.</p>

<p class="cp">THE PULPIT SLANDERER</p>

<p>Then came the sermon. No particular verse of the Scripture was
taken&mdash;the text was a Psalm in the whole. There was no
"secondly" and very little "lastly." Verse by verse the Palmist's
song was spoken to illustrate the depravity of the British. Each
injustice to Israel had a parallel to-day. Each passionate appeal
of David had application to the case of Chamberlain's victims in
the North. It was the fourteenth psalm he took as a subject. The
fool had said in his heart that the cause of the <i>burgher</i>
was a lost cause; that the Lord was not behind His people; that
the accursed tyranny of the oppressor should prevail.</p>

<p>And what of these oppressors? These people who tried to hide
themselves from ! the rifles of the <i>burghers</i> by arraying
their bodies in mud-colored cloth? The congregation murmured with
a sympathetic appreciation of this sarcasm. What of these men?
Truly, the Psalmist said, they were corrupt, they had done
abominable things, there was not one who had done good; no, not
one. What of the wasted lands in the north? What of the
dishonored homes and the blackened walls of the once prosperous
farmhouse? What of&mdash;?&mdash;again that awful
story&mdash;that Horror, made doubly authentic by reason of the
place of delivery.</p>

<p>He told the story, the bald, crude tale, carrying to a white
Englishman its own refutation in every syllable, and the
congregation held its breath.</p>

<p>He told the story, so that a man seated in the next pew to
myself half rose from his seat and, like a man who tries to shout
in a dream and finds that he can but whisper, muttered: "There is
time yet, there is time yet."</p>

<p>So that a young girl rose from her seat, tittering and
whimpering, and was led out.</p>

<p class="cp">"FRIENDS!"</p>

<p>And the sermon went on. The Lord had looked down upon the
Oppressor, and had visited him with affliction, with disaster
upon disaster. Colenso, Stormberg, Magersfontein had come like a
thunderbolt upon the world. It was the Divine warning to turn
from the path of oppression, to open the eyes of a blind nation.
And how had the warning been taken? Had the nation heeded the
voice? No. It had prosecuted its unrighteous designs, its unholy
object. It had gone from worse to worst; it had become
filthy.</p>

<p>Had they no knowledge, these iniquitous people, who had
brought war and desolation to the country, whose path had been
marked by much blood and burning? These people, who are dead to
all dictates of conscience, to all honor and pity? Did they not
realise that at the eleventh hour the Lord would save His people?
Or that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion! Did his
brethren understand what that passage meant?</p>

<p>The <i>predikant</i> paused and leant forward over the pulpit,
and there was a silence. Did they understand that the people of
the captivity looked to their own kindred for deliverance from
their bondage?</p>

<p>Another pause, and the congregation shifted uneasily in their
seats. Thus abruptly the sermon ended, and the people dispersed,
some walking, some riding, some driving. Group by group they
scattered, parting with limp shakes of great horny
hands&mdash;the elder men in gloomy silence, the younger men with
mutterings of threats and hints of startling things to be.</p>

<p>I passed down towards the little village that staggers from
the church at one end and to the naked veldt at the other, passed
by the little camp, answering the sentry's challenge. There was a
rattle of wheels behind me. It was the <i>predikant</i> driving
back with one of his flock. I stood on one side to allow them to
pass. As the trap neared the little roadside camp a bayonet
glittered in the moonlight, and the horses were pulled up
sharp.</p>

<p>"Halt! Who goes there?"</p>

<p>Back came the answer, prompt, and clear, and glib&mdash;</p>

<p>"Friends!"</p>

THE BIRTH OF A CORPS<br>
THE STORY OF KITCHENER'S FIGHTING SCOUTS</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Wanganui Chronicle</i> (New Zealand),
March 27, 1901</h3>

<p class="cp">MATJESFONTEIN, January 16, 1901</p>

<p>You may be pardoned for the natural curiosity which prompts
you when you read, that Somebody's "Horse," newly raised, has
been doing good work, to inquire from the most likely informant
the history of the raising of that corps, how it was raised, why,
and how it got the name that it bears. Roberts, Strathcona,
Driscoll, Warren, Bethune, Paget, Thorneycroft, Cameron, Marshal,
Orpen, Rimington, Brabant, Loch, Lovat, and last, not least in
war, Kitchener, have given their names to horses or scouts, while
corps like the South African Light Horse and the Imperial Light
Horse have managed very well without the backing of an
illustrious patronymic. They came into being, these corps, and
you at home know nothing of the labour and travail that attended
the birth. You did not know of swearing adjutants, sweating
remount officers, despairing C.O.s, of recruits without
discipline, who had ideas to be knocked out of them, of hastily
acquired equipment, of gloomy forebodings that the war would be
over before they were ready to take the field.</p>

<p class="cp">FIRST THE PROLOGUE</p>

<p>They came to you first in the list of casualties, which, being
official, took precedence of the Press report that came later,
and while you were reading the <i>Special</i>'s account of the
mad desperate rush, or the grim, bitter resistance, of the new-
made soldiers, they themselves were wiping the marks of battle
from their brand-new equipment, and thanking Heaven that the
British army had a corps like theirs to fall back upon in the
hour of danger.</p>

<p>In most cases these forces bear the names of the men to whom
they owe their inception&mdash;men who have given, in addition to
their names, service, fortune, and, in the case of poor
Montmorency, that charming gentleman who fell with his Guides,
life.</p>

<p>The story of Kitchener's Fighting Scouts is necessarily a
short one. Indeed, the prologue is scarcely written, but the
interest of that portion of the story deserves attention.</p>

<p>A few months ago the world of sport&mdash;that world that is
not satisfied with shooting over preserves, but looks towards
Somaliland and Rhodesia for the pleasures of life&mdash;was
grieved to learn of the sudden death of Mrs. Colenbrander, a
splendid sportswoman who had taken up her gun I against the
Matabele impis, and had fought side by side with her husband in
the dark days of '96.</p>

<p>She it was who, with Mr. Colenbrander, had accompanied Mr.
Rhodes in his daring <i>indaba</i> in the Matoppos, and her fame
throughout Rhodesia was no less than that of Johannes
Colenbrander&mdash;that mighty hunter whose name is a passport
from the Swaziland border to the Zambesi. Her tragic death came
like a thunderbolt upon Johannes, and finding life under the old
conditions unbearable, he resolved to sell out his every
possession in Rhodesia and find distraction in the Transvaal. He
was not long in Johannesburg before Lord Kitchener, who knew him
by repute, sent for him, and in the half-hour's conversation
between them the corps that bears the name of the Commander-in-
Chief was born.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Indaba</i> (Zulu)&mdash;A council or
meeting of indigenous peoples of southern Africa to discuss an
important matter. ]</p>

<p class="cp">A HUSBAND DESOLATE</p>

<p>"What are you doing, and where are you going?" was Kitchener's
peremptory demand.</p>

<p>"I am looking out for a new home, and I am going to England to
attend a board meeting," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Better join me," advised the strong man. "They tell me you
know every inch of the Swaziland border?"</p>

<p>"I know Zululand and Swaziland like a book."</p>

<p>Kitchener thought for a while.</p>

<p>"Will you take command of a force to patrol the Swaziland
border?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I will raise a force on one condition," responded Mr.
Colenbrander&mdash; "if you give , me leave to recruit."</p>

<p>Now at that time every irregular regiment in the field had
opened recruiting offices in all the large towns of the Colony
and Natal. There was not a hoarding in Capetown, Port Elizabeth.
East London, Grahamstown, Durban, or Maritzburg that did not bear
a dozen invitations to the youth of the colony to step up lively
and join the Imperial Light Horse, or the South African Light
Horse, or B.P.'s Police, or Marshall's, Nesbitt's, Brabant's, or
other regiments of Light Horse.</p>

<p>The Pioneer Regiments, the local volunteers, in fact, every
corps on service, were soliciting recruits, and every dorp or
town throughout South Africa had its recruiting office.
Consequently Colenbrander's offer to raise an entirely new force
was a somewhat daring one.</p>

<p>"Where will you recruit?" said the General.</p>

<p>"Everywhere&mdash;Capetown, Durban, Port Elizabeth, and
Bulawayo."</p>

<p>Kitchener pointed out that recruiting in Bulawayo had been
going on for some considerable time&mdash;in fact, he thought
that the Rhodesian supply of recruits was exhausted.</p>

<p>"After you have finished recruiting, said Colenbrander calmly,
"I will undertake to raise 300 men from Rhodesia alone."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Lord Kitchener promptly, "put your ideas on
paper and bring them along to-morrow morning at 11."</p>

<p>As Colenbrander turned to go, he bethought him to ask what
name the corps should bear.</p>

<p>"What do you think?" asked the chief.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," was the instant, reply, "if you don't mind, I
think 'Kitchener's Scouts' would not be a bad name.</p>

<p>At this Lord Kitchener demurred.</p>

<p>"Can't you find another name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I couldn't find a better," was the quick response.</p>

<p class="cp">SCOUTS AND MORE</p>

<p>Kitchener smiled. "All, right," he said, "if you would like
it, be it so&mdash;but you are to be something more than scouts.
I want you to fight."</p>

<p>"Then 'Kitchener's Fighting Scouts' let it be," said the
newly-appointed commanding officer, and "Kitchener's Fighting
Scouts" it was.</p>

<p>The next day a rough plan for forming the corps was drawn up,
and the last of Colenbrander's conditions for raising the corps
was quaint. "No Imperial officer other than Lord Kitchener shall
have control over the regiment." Lord Kitchener laughed, and
agreed, and Colenbrander walked away with the embryo of a
regiment in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>Then Johannes Colenbrander sat still, and looked around for
his officers. His second in command was easily found. Major
Wilson was on Lord Kitchener's staff and he had a South African
record that many generals might envy. Wilson had the eye and mind
for organisation. Colenbrander had the love and trust of his
fellows throughout South Africa. Both were brave, strong men.
Between them they chose their officers.</p>

<p>They were men who had "shot for the pot" from their youth
up&mdash;men who had wandered away from time to time from the
beaten tracks, and made paths through the unknown wilderness of
the north.</p>

<p>Pioneers who had carved their names in the primeval forests,
and had set their monograms down in cleared townships. They were
men who were wont to disappear at intervals from the Bulawayo
Club and turn up a few months later with a new stock of
reminiscences, and the fag end of an attack of fever.</p>

<p>The officer commanding one squadron was down at Massi-Kassi in
the days of the Portuguese raid, and his subaltern calls
Barotseland "home."</p>

<p>Wilson was on the Shangani in '93&mdash;and they have all been
through the '96 rebellion.</p>

<p>And so with the men. Forty per cent of them wear the orange-
and blue-barred ribbon '96. They, too, know the bad backland, and
carry tabloids of quinine in their pockets. They are here in
Matjesfontein, with their two spare horses and their Cape carts,
with their native scouts and pom-poms. If they by any good luck
get the order to chase De Wet they will get him, for they have
the pick of the horses, and reject twice as many as they accept
from the remount officer.</p>

<p>They will not take anything that has a suspicion of "crock" in
his composition, and in consequence they will be the finest
mounted force that has ever chased a Boer commando.</p>

<p>In the meantime Webber, who is the remount officer, is turning
grey.</p>

THE BETTER PATH</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Wanganui Chronicle</i>, April 20,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">LOYALTY, LOOT, AND COMPENSATION.</p>

<p>Prince Albert road, Cape Colony, February 3, 1901</p>

<p>It was at the trial of an alleged rebel yesterday at
Matjesfontein. He was a storekeeper charged with contravening
Proclamation 1a of 1899, and he had elected to give evidence on
his own behalf.</p>

<p>He was being subjected to a stiff cross-examination of one of
the ablest of staff officers, Captain G.F. Marker, of the
Coldstream Guards, and in answering a question pressed by the
prosecutor, the prisoner put the case for the British Government
in a nutshell.</p>

<p>The prisoner had a store in Sutherland, and when the
peripatetic commando halted the while at the sun-bathed dorp, its
commandant had found him a very useful substitute for a supply
officer, and his store not a bad imitation of a supply base. The
evidence showed that the prisoner was not an unwilling agent in
the matter; that he offered no resistance, handing over stores,
food, forage, and clothing at the commandant's pleasure</p>

<p class="cp">TO DISCOUNT BOER DRAFTS</p>

<p>He was being commandeered, he was being "looted"--and would
the hateful enemy mind signing for all they took, so that the
British Government should know all was fair and above board?</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," asked the prosecuting officer, in
amazement, "that you obtained a Boer commandant's signature in
order to obtain payment from the British Government?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the ingenuous answer of this representative of a
simple pastoral people.</p>

<p>A proclamation has just been issued laying down rules and
restrictions regarding payment of compensation for damages
sustained by the Cape colonists; and if the above candid
confession does not justify the most stringent reservations,
nothing does.</p>

<p>From time to time the Government of this colony issue certain
statements pertaining to the military situation, and it is
seldom, if ever, that these documents do not finish up with the
smug and comfortable assurance that "the invader is gaining
little assistance from the colony."</p>

<p>There is nothing more deceiving than this statement, as I have
already pointed out by cable.</p>

<p>It is worded so as to make the people of England believe that,
so far from receiving support or assistance from the Cape Dutch,
the invaders are being discouraged in every way from their
nefarious purpose.</p>

<p>That fewer Dutchmen are taking up arms and joining the invader
than was anticipated is, undoubtedly, a fact. Also, so long as
there was a possibility that the arrival of a Boer commando would
mean a considerable carrying over to the profit and loss account
in the books of the Boer storekeeper, that there was some
resentment shown on the part of these worthies is also a fact.
But then there arose the glorious vision of compensation. They
learned--Heavens knows how --that the officers in charge of the
commando were willing and anxious to sign for all the stock they
took; indeed, for a few sovereigns they would give a receipt for
&pound;500 more than value received. And then came peace.</p>

<p class="cp">LOYAL AND LOOTED</p>

<p>Let the Boers come; if they looted the farm or the homestead
or the store they would give receipts. With the generosity of men
contracting debts for others to pay, they would give the looted
one credit for twice the amount of goods they had taken. There
was no need to join the enemy, no need to take up arms and suffer
the discomforts of a campaign.</p>

<p>Also they were happy to supply the Boers with information.
Whether the nearest town was occupied by the British; how many
troops there were; whether any English soldiers had passed by
that morning; strength of patrols, locality of outposts--any
little thing like that; any scrap of information they possessed
or could acquire they were happy to give, and it was a thousand
chances to one against their being detected. So the motto of the
Dutch in this country has been--the new year resolution, in fact-
-"It pays to be loyal and be looted, it hurts to be rebel and be
shot."</p>

<p>The leniency with which we have dealt with our rebellious
subjects in this war is a subject so frequently approached that
one grows sick of the reiteration. I think it is now quite
apparent to every man and woman that the adoption of severe
methods of dealing with traitors in the beginning of the war
would have saved much blood and sweat; but it is as well not to
lose sight of the fact that there is still opportunity for
enforcing a more vigorous regime in this matter.</p>

<p>The machinery now in use for dealing with the gentry who act
as intelligence officers to the Boer forces is so complex that
any ordinary liar--and the backveldt population are well above
the average--may, in the time intervening between his arrest and
his trial, hope to clear himself and even sue the Government for
unlawful imprisonment.</p>

<p class="cp">DISLOYAL AND FORGIVEN</p>

<p>A civilian commits an offence which probably jeopardises the
safety of a column. The offence is such that no military court
would hesitate in sentencing him to death. Perhaps he has ridden
twenty miles to give information to the invader to the effect
that we are laying in wait for him at a convenient
<i>spruit</i>.* The officer commanding the column learns from
smart loyalist of the betrayal and arrests the traitor. Perhaps
in being arrested the man shows fight and strikes a soldier. He
is taken to the base, and instead of being tried by court-martial
he undergoes a preliminary examination conducted by a magistrate,
and probably a month after the committal of the offence he is
committed for trial--on a charge of assaulting the captor!</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Spruit</i> (Afrikaans)--a watercourse.
]</p>

<p>The treatment allotted to the individual traitor should be
swift and severe, and that to the passive enemy within our walls
such as will render him harmless till he recovers his senses.</p>

<p>It would require, however, a nice discrimination to punish a
rebellious people, were it not for the fact that they have
differentiated themselves from the loyalists of the colony, and
have associated with a common object, and that, the ousting of
Britain, her interests, her language, and her influence from
South Africa.</p>

<p>The days have passed since we regarded the <i>Afrikander
Bond</i> as a purely political association existing for the
amelioration of the South African farmer's lot. We now know it is
a power; a great, strong, subtle power, intensifying racial
hatred, and aiming for a United South Africa under a Republican
flag.</p>

<p>However fine this ideal may have been--and traitorous ideals
may be fine--it was nonetheless traitorous, whether it was to be
realised by constitutional methods or by a recourse to arms, and
the far-reaching efforts of the Bond's teaching has beyond doubt
swollen the ranks of the Republican forces in the earlier stages
of the war, and encouraged our enemy to a still more stubborn!
resistance.</p>

<p>Because of this, and because every Bondsman in this country
sympathises with and, when the opportunity offers, helps the
enemy, without malice I say that no claim for compensation on the
part of a Bondsman should be entertained.</p>

<p>The <i>Afrikander Bond</i> has been more than a political
association.</p>

<p>Good people at home who think of it at the worst as a
ferocious sort of Radical club would do better if they thought of
it rather as a dangerous type of the Clanna-Gael, with a hundred
thousand armed members.</p>

THE COMING OF DE WET</a></h2>

<p class="cp">HIS FIRST CHECK<br>
A TRIBUTE TO VICTORIAN TROOPS</p>

<p>PHILIPSTOWN, February 13, 1901</p>

<p>There is not a hundred miles from De Aar an Intelligence
officer.</p>

<p>You may never have met his like at home, because in Pall Mall
Intelligence officers are only ordinary people who go to office
from ten till four, eat dinners, and see plays, just as you or I
would, and, wearing no particular uniform other than the uniform
of the regiment to which they belong, they pass unnoticed in the
red-tabbed crowd on the "military side" of the War Office. My
Intelligence officer, however, is a civilian, and wears khaki and
a mustard-coloured cap.</p>

<p>He has a large staff and spends his time opening private
letters that pass through De Aar, so that should one Boer general
write to another Boer general, giving him information regarding
his plans, strength or disposition&mdash;such being the method
usually adopted by Boer commandants to convey their intentions to
one another&mdash;that Intelligence officer immediately knows,
and, acting on the information thus acquired, puts a stop to the
indiscreet correspondent's little game.</p>

<p class="cp">"OPENED UNDER MARTIAL LAW"</p>

<p>Or it may be that the letters are opened with the idea of
ascertaining what Piet Faure of Paarl thinks of Christian De Wet
of Dewetsdorp. At any rate, the staff, is employed in opening
letters from morning to night, and the re-sealing and fastening
down with neat red labels "Opened under martial law."</p>

<p>Consequently, when I wrote at midnight last Monday night that
all was quiet on the Orange River, I had no reason to doubt that
so methodical and painstaking a department could possibly be
mistaken in thinking the district was quiet. But even as I
wrote&mdash;and while yet the Intelligence Office, moved by a
stern sense of duty, was probably poring over the clumsy
sentences of an amorous Dutchman, trying to read, in the crude,
ill-turned sentences, some traitorous sentiment&mdash;the Boer
scouts were seated on the kopjes outside Philipstown waiting for
daylight that they might enter the town.</p>

<p>They knew&mdash;for their un-uniformed Intelligence department
confined their attentions to the enemy's movements
only&mdash;that Philipstown was held by the smallest of Yeomanry
patrols, and they counted the task of taking the town an easy
one.</p>

<p>De Wet was across the border, and he had made up his mind to
accomplish that mission he had set for Commandant Hertzog.</p>

<p class="cp">IGNORANCE SOMETIMES PAYS</p>

<p>Philipstown was the first town on the list, and occupying
Philipstown as generally counted by the enemy as only something a
trifle more fatiguing than going to a picnic.</p>

<p>Philipstown is disloyal beyond salvation, and its inhabitants
usually keep a holiday suit of clothes handy to don when the
Boers ride through.</p>

<p>If disloyalty were a pestilence and sedition a plague, no
honest man could come within ten miles of Philipstown and
live.</p>

<p>Therefore, the invaders were perfectly justified in thinking
that Philipstown was in their own country, and the invasion
proper started south of there.</p>

<p>With the dawn of the 12th&mdash;yesterday&mdash;the advance
party of a commando numbering 400 men moved towards the town, and
the Yeomanry patrol took up a position in the gaol and prepared
to defend themselves.</p>

<p>The functions of a cavalry patrol do not seem to be clearly
understood. It is its duty to act as the eyes of the army, to
report suspicious movements of the enemy, and generally to keep
out of sight and see as much as it can.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances the patrol would probably have done
more good had it retired from Philipstown and reported the Boer
movements to the main body or. to the brigade to which it
belonged.</p>

<p>However, the officer commanding the patrol entered the gaol,
and putting it in a state of defence made a most gallant fight,
and succeeded in keeping a portion of the town clear of the
enemy.</p>

<p class="cp">ADVANCE AUSTRALIA</p>

<p>A few miles from Philipstown and on the De Aar road was a
strong patrol of the Victorian Imperial Regiment, about sixty men
under Captain Tivey, who had been sent from De Aar the previous
day by Colonel Henniker, with instructions to patrol within
striking distance, of Philipstown, and to him the officer
commanding the goal sent a message asking for assistance.</p>

<p>At the same time as Captain Tivey got the message, the Boers
resolved to occupy a very strong position south of the town, and
commanding the De Aar and Houtkraal roads. Unfortunately for
Commandant Van der Merwe, the Victorians resolved on achieving
the same object, and immediately on both sides of the ridge,
unseen by the other, were two bodies of men galloping for their
very lives towards the natural fortress that overlooks the
town.</p>

<p>The Australians got there first&mdash;as the enemy discovered
later. It was not what one would call a great battle&mdash;the
enemy lost a few and we lost none&mdash;but it was a brilliant
little fight, and it proved the Australian commander to be as
resourceful as he and his men were courageous. All day long the
fight continued, and in the evening, on the arrival of Major
Granville Smith with the rest of the Victorians under Major
Clark, the Boers fled, leaving the <i>Dopper</i>* and the Dutch
Reformed ministers to bury their dead.</p>

<p class="footnote">{*<i>Dopper</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;a member of
the most conservative Afrikander Church, which practises a strict
Calvinism. ]</p>

<p>Such was the battle of Philipstown&mdash;nothing very great as
battles go, but sufficient to hold De Wet's main body for at
least six hours and turn him back on the pursuing columns. It was
his first check south, and it was fitting that the men from the
colonies, who at this time are coming forward so readily at the
call of the Mother Country, and the Yeomen of England should have
been the men who gave De Wet his first check.</p>

CAPETOWN TO-DAY<br>
THE CITY OF REFUGE</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Evening Post</i> (New Zealand), March 2, 1901</h3>

<p>After you have left the ship and have strolled round the town
you will return again and ask the purser to let you remain as a
boarder for the few days the mail boat is in dock.</p>

<p>You will do this in preference to camping out on the beach or
contenting yourself with the shakiest of shakedowns in the
dirtiest of third-rate Capetown hotels.</p>

<p>There will be a room empty in a day or so perhaps, but at
present they are full up. The guinea-a-day hostelry and the five-
pounds-a-month lodging house have one story to tell&mdash;"full
up." Every week the boats from England bring fresh boarders, and
every week aimless young men in Baden-Powell hats trudge the red-
hot pavements of the capital in search of accommodation.</p>

<p>Capetown in these days is necessarily a khaki town.</p>

<p>It is rather depressing, this dirty yellow uniform,
particularly when you have worn it yourself, marched in it,
fought in it, and slept in it for the greater part of a year. The
novelty of the tint wore off months before these gay youths who
sport it to-day in cab, caf&eacute;, and bar thought of doffing
their broadcloth for the mustard-hued tunic.</p>

<p class="cp">WHISKERED, AND NOT ASHAMED</p>

<p>Also it is difficult for one who has a nodding acquaintance
with dress regulations to reconcile himself to the artistic get-
up of the Capetown warrior, for the Capetown warrior is a being
beautiful. He is an imitative exquisite, and, like the genius he
'is, he has improved greatly upon the hard and fast rules that
War Office fogies have laid down regarding the manner in which
officers of Her Majesty's Army shall array themselves when in Her
Majesty's highways.</p>

<p>In the field the British officer troubles very little
concerning his personal appearance, carrying his fastidiousness
only to the point of desiring clean shirts at frequent intervals;
but in Adderley-street the British officer is a thing of beauty
and a joy for the whole morning. The khaki tunic which several
distinct regulations direct shall be fastened is carefully turned
down at the throat to show the snowiest of hunting-cravats, or
even an immaculate collar and tie! His boots of white buckskin
are newly pipeclayed; and the helmet which filled the bills at
Meerut and Atbara is now discarded for the soft felt "smasher,"
which has the advantage of supplying, better than any other
article of attire, the local colour necessary for the South
African campaigner.</p>

<p>One sees many regiments represented in Capetown. Bushmen
jostle men of the Guards, New Zealanders fraternise with Imperial
Yeomen. In the smoking-room of the City Club, painfully youthful
subalterns of Militia expound ponderous theories on war and its
conduct to good-natured captains of irregular horse, men who wear
weird whiskers and are unashamed.</p>

<p class="cp">POLICE! POLICE!</p>

<p>These khaki men have all been somewhere north. They have all
marched or ridden, and shot hopelessly at bushes which had, it
was alleged, hidden Boers. They have all instinctively ducked as
the wailing little messengers of death sang over their heads. Now
the war is over&mdash;to them. They still wear their uniforms,
and in a vague sort of way identify themselves with the front,
which has now become a place for which the 9 o'clock train leaves
nightly.</p>

<p>After all, the war is over. It is now a brigandage, our enemy
is a moonlighter, his colonial sympathiser a boycotter. We are
sending our generals home and are increasing our police
force&mdash;which exactly explains the situation.</p>

<p>The Boer army has to all intents and purposes ceased to exist.
It has dissolved into murdering particles. Flying columns have
dwindled down to marauding bands. Night attacks have sunk to the
level of cowardly assassinations, and the cry of South Africa is
no longer a wail for flank attacks, but rather that with which
the denizens of Suburbia have made us long familiar: "Give us
more police."</p>

<p>At the corner of Adderley-street, by the Standard Bank, a man
sits at a table&mdash;a table littered with dusty pamphlets and
covered with nice clean newspapers. A placard pinned to the edge
of the table calls upon the passer-by to sign a petition to the
Queen. It is the new reform movement. It is the new grievance of
the new <i>Uitlander</i>.* Kruger has passed, and with him his
corrupt regime. The franchise bogie has vanished into thin air.
Now it is the capitalist, the demon capitalist, who is going to
crush the <i>Uitlander</i>&mdash;the hateful capitalist whom Lord
Roberts, has placed in positions of trust in the gold reef
city.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Uitlander</i>
(Afrikaans)&mdash;foreigner (lit. "outlander"); the name given to
expatriate migrant workers during the initial exploitation of the
Witwatersrand gold fields in the Transvaal. ]</p>

<p class="cp">THE FOCUS OF DISLOYALTY</p>

<p>I rather think it is not a real danger, but the refugee is
getting short of money, and anything that appears in the
slightest degree to be suggestive of further privations produces
a kind of panic&mdash;the panic of desperate men hard up.</p>

<p>Soon the refugee will begin returning to the Rand, and the
questions which are now of life and death will resolve themselves
into those mild phases of social and economic legislation, the
discussion of which enlivens the proceedings of town
councils.</p>

<p>At present the reformers' troubles are very high politics.</p>

<p>There is in Capetown a class of refugee which probably will
never trouble the relief committee, and takes only the most
languid interest in the possibilities of a speedy opening of the
Rand: a class which is only moved to gleeful excitement by
intelligence of a setback&mdash;however temporary&mdash;to
British arms.</p>

<p>Good souls, these deported Hollander families and their
Capetown friends. The ladies are so charming, so frankly
disloyal, and yet so ready to bow to the inevitable, that the
officers of the garrison who turn up in time for afternoon tea
vote them "no end of good sorts, don't you know!"</p>

<p>If I were asked what is the most dangerous centre of sedition
in South Africa, I should without hesitation award the
questionable honour to Capetown. There are the same old
rebellious circles&mdash;stronger numerically than they were of
yore&mdash; babbling the same traitorous sentiments with
increased bitterness. There is the some coterie of traitorous
women binding themselves into a thousand and one highfalutin'
leagues&mdash;little rocks of discontent that serve to indicate
the hidden reefs of hate and treason.</p>

<p class="cp">FOOLISH AND LOYAL</p>

<p>Yet in spite of their unmistakable detestation of everything
that is British, and their alleged love for their
country&mdash;which in all cases means Pretorian social
circles&mdash;there is nothing of the Joan of Arc about these
bellicose dames. Perhaps a Charlotte Corday might be found who,
strengthened in her purpose by the knowledge of kid-glove
military retribution, would be willing to risk a month's
imprisonment in the Mount Nelson Hotel, or some equally dreadful
punishment devised by staff college graduates, by slaying a
general or two, or even a correspondent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the loyal refugees&mdash;the foolish
ones&mdash;increase in number daily. Almost day by day as the
ships arrive, but mostly on the big mail days, they come flocking
in from England, till one feels inclined to stop the stream of
men that straggle from the docks to the town and ask them if they
can read&mdash; if they do not understand that the Rand is still
closed, and the Refugees Relief Funds are running low; to ask
them if they do not realise that unless they have funds to last
them for at least six months they might as well return to England
again by the next steamer.</p>

<p>And so week by week the town is hidden by the new-come swarm.
It is full, it is more than full, but a titanic hand seems to
shake it into compactness, and then there is room for the last
newcomers. Room, though they overflow and some slip over the edge
into the vague "up country." Overcrowded, but still room for all.
Tightly packed and trickling into Suburbia, but still
room&mdash;and then&mdash;well then a little blue and red flag
crawls lazily up to the flagstaff on Signal Hill, another liner
has been sighted, and the shaking up begins all over again.</p>

OUT ON THE VELDT</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The West Coast Times</i> (New Zealand), April 26, 1901</h3>

<p class="cp">THE DEATH OF QUEEN VICTORIA</p>

<p>Mr Edgar Wallace describes in the <i>Daily Mail</i> the
anxious, watching on the veldt for the news of the Queen. We
quote the following:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">
"TICK&mdash;TICK&mdash;TICK&mdash;PRINCE&mdash;WALES&mdash;
TELEGRAPHS&mdash;LIFE&mdash;BELOVED&mdash;QUEEN&mdash;
GREAT&mdash;DANGER."</p>

<br>

<p>An Australian patrol has come in from Damslaagte, and the men
have trotted their horses up to the door of the office.</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;what's the news? It isn't really true, is it?"</p>

<p>They are grimy, unshaven, and white with dust of the trek.
They are tired men, who have ridden forty miles since "sun up",
but they have forgotten their fatigue, forgotten their hardships
of the past week, forgotten even to report that they bad been
sniped at, oblivious to all things save that somewhere six
thousand miles north, in a place they did not know, somebody whom
they had never seen was passing into the shadow.</p>

<p>The night passes; a troublesome night, and silent save for the
sough of the wind and the tick of the tape. A night in the centre
of an unpeopled world, among restless shades and whimpering,
whispering voices. Now and again a form appears from nowhere in
particular, and an anxious voice demands the latest news, and
then disappears unsatisfied. If the word "empire" bonds the
hearts of people of the seven seas together, surely this sorrow
which is pressing on us to-night is knitting the very souls of
men into one. In our loneliness we experience the companionship
of kindred suffering, and to-night we are one with Brisbane as we
are with Ottawa</p>

<p>And she has played so great a part in this war&mdash;if you at
home will only realise it. Hers was the word that numbed the
sting of the rebuff. Hers was the message that put hope and life
and a new courage into the battered brigades that struggled back
from the scene of the disaster. Her thanks and solicitudes were
the crowning triumphs of the hard-won field.</p>

<p>"It's the Queen's gift to me," said a hard-faced private of
the line when I approached him at the Modder River with a view to
purchasing his chocolate box; "it's the Queen's gift to me, and
money wouldn't buy it."</p>

<p>She has ever been a sacred subject among the rank and file cf
the Army. They are very broad-minded, the men who served and
loved her; Papist or Buddhist or Jew are one with our Protestant
selves. This is the rule of the barrack room. Talk lightly of
creeds, of faiths, or of strange gods; but there is one who must
not be brought within the range of controversy. They require no
regulations to guide them in this matter. They are governed in
their thoughts toward her person by a love which cannot be
commanded.</p>

<p>"Tick&mdash;tick&mdash;tick." Message after message comes
up.</p>

<p>The clerk drops the festoon of tape and listens to the
instrument. He is reading by ear, and as the chattering sounder
speaks he raises a tremulous hand to his lips to hide a tell-tale
shiver.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty died last night."</p>

<p>Outside the wind had dropped, the veldt was silent and
peaceful, and the eastern sky was gold and crimson. So I left the
clerk with his bowed head on his arm and went and told his
men.</p>

<h2><a id="art09" name="art09">
KITCHENER&mdash;THE GENERAL</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Poverty Bay Herald</i> (New Zealand), May 14, 1901</h3>

<p class="cp">THOROUGH, UNCONVENTIONAL, AND COOL</p>

<p>As you know him at home, a general is an elderly person in a
tightly-buttoned frock coat and a befeathered cocked hat who
walks with solemn stride along the stiffened ranks of a regiment
in review order and discusses the civil side of the War Office
with the regimental C.O. in language of a peculiar asperity. He
is, moreover, a person of whom the most irreverent cavalry
subaltern stands in awe, and his coming&mdash;of which a month's
notice is given&mdash;causes junior line officers to devote
themselves to mastering the intricacies of the sword practice
with great earnestness. When he is not in uniform he opens
bazaars, attends war games, presents prizes to charity schools,
and writes letters to the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>Abroad and in war time he is another person, and where no
house is available ne lives in a tent over which floats a red
flag.</p>

<p class="cp">ONE BY HIMSELF</p>

<p>In these days he is a power&mdash;and, strangely enough, is
less a supreme unapproachable than a comrade. He has his bath in
the morning and fights steadily from sun-up to sun-down, when he
knocks off to write his despatches. If he is consistently
successful you at home call him familiarly by his surname, and
cigarette makers use his photograph for advertising purposes. If
he is unsuccessful, and disastrously so, he goes home on sick
leave&mdash;for he is usually very sick.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener is not like other generals; and indeed, it is
well that no stereotyped officer is at the helm in South Africa,
and I say this without in any way desiring to reflect upon the
wisdom, capacity, or administrative abilities of any other
general officer&mdash;for the situation calls rather for the
specialist than the general practitioner.</p>

<p>A great strategist would be wasted in Africa. There is no need
for delicate adjustment of forces or elaborately prepared
counter-moves. The overthrow of the remnant of the Boer army
requires little strategy. It is a matter for brute force and
physical endurance.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener realises this, and has realised it for many
months. He knows that if the war is to be brought to a
satisfactory conclusion, that end will only be arrived at by
plodding dogged perseverance, and by playing the Boers at their
own game, and damaging them in the most effective manner.</p>

<p class="cp">THE WORK AND THE MAN</p>

<p>You cannot defeat the Boer by calling him names. He runs away
and glories in it. You cannot get near enough to call him a
coward, nor would that epitaph sting him to the fighting point.
It is a part of Brother Boer's tactics to run, and he makes us
run after him; it is a part of the tiring-out process, and the
dominating maxim of the outlying commando is:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Ye who fight and run away,<br>
Live to fight with De la Rey."</p>

<br>

<p>Kitchener knows this, and where another general might have
been covering sheets of foolscap with general ideas for
surrounding and capturing the flying burghers, Kitchener is
calmly and steadily removing to well-guarded centres the means of
flight.</p>

<p>Firstly, the burghers must have food&mdash; so we are bringing
the food in. Then they must have horses, so the country from the
Orange to the Crocodile is being denuded of horses.</p>

<p>The horses must have forage, and the forage of the country is
stored or burnt.</p>

<p>Imagine if you can Kitchener's task. Think of the enormous
tract of country over which our operations are extended, and you
will realise to some extent that in Pretoria is the only possible
general for the work in hand&mdash;a work that demands better
generalship than would be required of the commander of an army
corps in a European war.</p>

<p class="cp">HEAD, MIDDLE, AND FEET</p>

<p>In South Africa Kitchener is the head, middle, and feet of the
army. He runs everything and knows everything. He has divisions,
brigades, and columns moving in all directions over an area not
less than 300,000 square miles, and he knows the whereabouts of
every one. He has some columns that are 250 miles from any
railway line, and as far from telegraphic communication. His
grasp of detail is perfect. He knows how many Cape carts
Henniker's column has, and he is aware that there are three sick
Yeomen in hospital at Buluwayo.</p>

<p class="cp">THE MAN AND HIS MEN</p>

<p>His attitude towards his subordinates is peculiar, for he
values man only as a more or less perfect machine, and the more
perfect he is the better he treats him. Kitchener has no use for
fops of any sort, but he is not so prejudiced by appearance as to
order a man home because he wears an eyeglass, as some people
would have you believe. Indeed, some of his best officers have an
affection for the monocle.</p>

<p>If his manner were translated into words, it would run
something like this:- -</p>

<p>"I am your superior officer; you have taken service under me,
and the world will judge you according to your progress. I have
great power entrusted: to me by the King through his Parliament,
and whoever you are or whatever position you fill in the social
world I can make or mar you. I want you to do your duty, and your
duty is to do as you are told. If you do as I bid, you shall have
all the credit for the success in obtaining which I used you as
an instrument. If my plans miscarry I will take the
blame&mdash;unless it miscarries through your inefficiency. I
don't care who your tailor is or how many clubs you may be a
member of providing you can lead your men into action with a
maximum of dash to a minimum of risk. I don't want heroes who
will lead their companies up to the cannon's mouth and reduce the
strength of their regiments accordingly, but steady men who will
take cover and shoot away obstruction from the shelter of a nice
convenient boulder."</p>

<p>Nor does Kitchener spare himself, as the recent chase of De
Wet testifies. If he is not at Pretoria sitting at the end of a
telegraph wire he is somewhere down the line seeing things for
himself, and De Wet had not been long in the Colony before
Kitchener was at De Aar, talking to the commandant of Hopetown
about the horses that had not been removed from the Hopetown
district. On such occasions "K of K" has a fine flow of
language.</p>

<h2><a id="art10" name="art10">
WHY WE LOST DE WET<br>
THREE GOOD REASONS</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), May 16,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">COLESBERG TOWN, March 4, 1901</p>

<p>De Wet being now safely across the river, and the odds against
his returning being about 1000 to l, Colesberg is full of troops.
White, Bruce-Hamilton, Plumer, Pilcher and others I cannot
remember have been in and out for the last few days, and
Henniker, Crabbe, Thorneycroft, and Monro are camped about the
base of Suffolk Hill waiting for orders. De Wet has passed, he
has swum the river in flood, losing about twenty men in the act,
and he is moving to Fauresmith for all he is worth.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that our operations have been most
successful, and I am not trying to explain away the fact that we
have lost the guerrilla chief when I say that we have
accomplished all Lord Kitchener set us to do&mdash;namely, to
drive De Wet back again to the Orange River Colony, to prevent
him at all hazards penetrating south. On two occasions we might
have caught him&mdash;or cornered his commando, for I doubt now
whether De Wet himself will ever be taken&mdash;and on both
occasion we failed for the same reason, viz., the total absence
of any organised system of communication between the various
columns.</p>

<p class="cp">A COMPLETE CORDON</p>

<p>De Wet's last few days in Cape Colony were the most fateful
days he has ever spent, for it was touch-and.go with him whether
he would be completely surrounded. Henniker, after leaving
Petrusville with Crabbe, followed up De Wet to the Zand Drift,
Thorneycroft being on Henniker's left. Hickman, moving up from
Philipstown, came in touch with the enemy, but only with his
rearguard, unfortunately. Haig and Williams were further south,
and the question now was, Where was Byng?</p>

<p>Byng, as far as the columns knew, should be exactly in front,
and this would have completed the cordon, Haig and Williams
making a break south an impossibility. Byng had left Colesberg
and, unknown to us, had struck De Wet's foreguard at a farm
called Goodehoepe. He then sent a message to De Aar informing
General Lyttelton, who commanded, and who seventy miles away was
directing operations, and received either from that officer or
from Pretoria direct an order to retire south to prevent De Wet
moving in that direction. De Wet then moved over the ground which
had been vacated, and reaching Lilliefontein crossed the
river.</p>

<p>This in brief is what happened, and the question is, what
would have prevented it and made De Wet's capture possible? I am
informed that for two or three days Hickman, desirous of
conveying and receiving information, had tried in vain to attract
the attention of the officer commanding at Colesburg by
heliograph. Coleskop, famous by reason of the guns French mounted
thereon, is a landmark, and from, certain aspects can been seen
for forty or fifty miles. Who, then, can blame Colonel Hickman
for imagining that on this eminence, which is in a garrison town,
there should be a staff of signallers?</p>

<p class="cp">THE SIGNAL THAT FAILED</p>

<p>There can be no doubt at all that had a signaller been
stationed on Coleskop De Wet would have been caught. From such an
eminence&mdash;using Coleskop as the exchanging
medium&mdash;columns would have been able to communicate one with
the other, instead of being forced to resort to the laborious,
dangerous, and time-wasting method of sending messages through by
despatch riders. To locate De Wet is simple enough, to place a
cordon round him&mdash;that is, to put a force of men east, west,
south and north of him&mdash;is not so very difficult. To
instruct these men or columns to leave camp at a certain date and
move in a given direction is the easiest thing in the world, but
once let these columns get thirty miles from their starting
points without means of rapid communication one with the other,
and you have set a dozen blindfolded mutes from the four sides of
a square to catch a wide-awake man in the centre.</p>

<p class="cp">WANTED CO-OPERATION</p>

<p>The telegraph line is unreliable, if, indeed, not impossible,
in a district through which a hostile force is marching, and it
is to the little circular mirror on the tripod that we must look
for help.</p>

<p>There is no reason why a complete heliograph service should
not be inaugurated throughout South Africa at least from De Aar
northward. Each heliograph post could be held by reason of its
position on the mountain by a company of infantry, and Lord
Kitchener would be independent of the wire.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of mountains suitable for the purpose. I
have already mentioned Coleskop, from which by two stages one is
able to communicate with Thaba N'chu, in the east of Orange River
Colony. The failure to capture De Wet may be traced to three
sources.</p>

<p>The first, and most important, is the absolute failure of
communication between columns and headquarters.</p>

<p>The second, the impossibility of a general conducting
operations from a distance varying from thirty to seventy miles
under such conditions.</p>

<p>The third, the temptation among column commanders to make the
campaign against De Wet a competition rather than, a cooperated
movement.</p>

<h2><a id="art11" name="art11">A NICE WAR</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), May 24,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">STRAINING THE QUALITY OF MERCY</p>

<p class="cp">MIDDELBURG (Cape Colony), March 13, 1901</p>

<p>In the years that are to be, you, my friends, may pat one
another on the back and remark:</p>

<p>"Whatever may be said of the Anglo-Boer war of 1899-1902, it
must be confessed that never was war waged where so much humanity
was displayed on both sides as in that war; we never needlessly
look life; we were very careful about hurting the feelings of our
enemy; if we killed him we erected a monument over his grave; if
we took him a prisoner we were careful to feed him on the very
best&mdash;even though our own troops were on quarter rations;
and when we temporarily exiled him we sent him off to the
loveliest spot in the world in a ship warranted not to roll!"</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, in those days the doctrines of humanity will
have become such a factor in our daily lives that we shall regard
him as a perfect judge whose sentences are the lightest, and we
shall reserve our Chief justiceship for the judge who weeps and
forgives tie repentant burglar and converts the Hooligan through
the medium of afternoon teas and jam tarts. If you are anxious to
be in a position to say the words that I have put into your
mouth, you may very easily. You have only to prosecute, the war
to an amiable finish, and at the back end of 1902 or 1903, or,
perhaps, 1904, you will be in that happy state of mind. If Botha
surrenders&mdash;and I doubt whether he will, except in the
manner Cronje surrendered&mdash;the war will be ended. Not
virtually ended, not as good as ended, nor nearly ended, but just
ended.</p>

<p class="cp">NICENESS AND NICENESS</p>

<p>Botha is the recognised Commander-in-Chief, and with him is
Schalk Burger, the recognised president of the late Republic, and
the surrender of these two men will signify that as Governments
the Transvaal and Orange Free-State have laid down their arms and
are prepared to sue for peace.</p>

<p>Consequently, the war, which was declared by the sometime
South African Republic, and to which the Orange Free State was a
party so long as the Transvaal Government was engaged in
hostilities with Great Britain, will be ended, and the De Wets
and De la Reys and Hertzogs and Brands and Kruitzingers will be
in very truth banditti&mdash;train-wreckers, looters, marauders,
whom any honest man may very rightly shoot on sight. If Botha
does surrender and this thing comes about, humanity of the faint-
at-blood type may demand that the wealth of England shall be
squandered for yet another year, or even two, sooner than we
should depart from our policy of fatuous Niceness, a policy which
has swelled our casualty lists considerably.</p>

<p>There is niceness and niceness, and the act of mercy need not
be confounded with the act of folly. Two weeks ago&mdash;the day
before De Wet crossed the Orange River on his return
home&mdash;Captain Dallimore, of the Victorian Imperial Regiment,
while scouting with a patrol of fifteen men, got on the track of
a party of Beers twice as strong numerically as his own small
party. With that skill which only the Australians seem to possess
he followed the enemy without letting his own party expose
themselves, and night found him with his little band posted along
a ridge overlooking the Boer camp, which was in the angle of the
Sea Cow and Orange Rivers.</p>

<p class="cp">CONTRASTED VARIETIES</p>

<p>All night long in the drizzling rain the Victorians waited,
and at last dawn broke and showed, the sleeping forms of the
enemy slumbering quite oblivious of the presence of our men. Had
he been so willed, Captain Dallimore might have shot every
sleeper as he lay, but he did a thing for which every man with
the instincts of an Englishman will praise him&mdash;he ordered a
volley to be fired over their heads, so that they might wake and
have a fight for their lives. That was mercy&mdash;and, good
sportsmen, it was The Game.</p>

<p>Take another case. At one of the big fights in the earlier
days of the war an officer commanding a battery of artillery was
ordered to shell the spur of a range of hills which constituted
the enemy's right. From the base of the hill stretched out, for a
dozen miles, a plain as level as Green Park. Suddenly a white
flag was hoisted on the enemy's left, and firing ceased all along
the Boer lines. Then, when the flag had been hoisted for a few
minutes, the Boer main body, taking advantage of the cessation of
the firing, was seen streaming away across the plain to their
right, making good their retreat. The artillery officer's duty
was very obvious: it was to open fire upon the fugitives, who
were splendidly within range. This, however, he would not do,
remarking to his amazed juniors that he could not shell a
retreating foe.</p>

<p>This was not mercy, it was folly&mdash;nay, it was criminal,
for every burgher who escaped death or capture through his
neglect was an instrument, willing and eager to bring about the
destruction of that officer's comrades.</p>

<p class="cp">THE KIND GENERAL</p>

<p>Some time ago, operating in the north-west of the Transvaal,
was a nice general. He was a good tactician, a clever leader of
men, and a charming old gentleman.</p>

<p>He was very nice indeed, and his sympathies were wide, and he
believed most of the things that neutral Boer farmers told him,
from the depredations of the soldiery to the innocence of the
farm in the matter of secreted rifles and ammunition. As he moved
through the country he granted to the farmers, left and right,
passed to remain on their farms, being assured by their vows that
the proximity of roving commandoes would have no weakening effect
on their allegiance&mdash;stalwarts that they were.</p>

<p>A day's march behind the nice general, and moving in the fame
direction, was another British column, commanded by a great,
gruff, hairy-chested colonial, who swore at his officers and
nursed his horses. He was not a nice man: he had been a police
officer in Bechuanaland before the war, and in dealing with the
enemy he started off with one unshakeable principle, which
was&mdash; "All Dutchmen are liars."</p>

<p>Had he been an Imperial officer he might have been overawed by
the general's signature, which appeared on every pass, but his
sense of reverence for British administration having died
young&mdash;he was with Evelyn Wood in 1881&mdash; he collected
all the passes, arrested, all the farmers, and, overtaking the
nice general after a few days, handed them over without any other
explanation than that they were a source of danger to the
country.</p>

<p class="cp">HIS MEN PAID</p>

<p>The general was furious, for, like many other folk, he was
only polite to people outside of his family, and immediately
ordered back the prisoners to their farms, apologising for the
inconvenience they had suffered in the days of their
captivity.</p>

<p>So they returned to their, farms, with the airs of martyrs,
and the next time the nice general passed through that district
he finished his report to headquarters in this wise:&mdash;"I
regret to report the following casualties&mdash;":and the farmers
who had dug up their rifles had gone, for the convenient commando
has passed through.</p>

<p>It Botha's surrender is at hand, then the end of the war is
also at hand, and whosoever fights after the war is ended does so
at the risk of being treated as the Germans treated the <i>franc-
tireurs</i>. The surrender of Botha would bring, about quite a
different condition of things to what now exists. To recognise
every moving band of fifty marauders as a Boer army, and to treat
them accordingly, would be folly of the maddest kind. To take
every third man of the party and stick him up against a wall
would not&mdash;well, it would not be "nice"! Neither is it
"nice" to hang murderers, flog garroters, imprison thieves, or
birch the youthful Hooligan.</p>

<p>Somehow I think niceness is just as much out of place in
warfare.</p>

<h2><a id="art12" name="art12">PROFIT AND LOSS</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), May 28,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">THE INVASION ACCOUNT</p>

<p class="cp">NAAUWPOORT, March 17, 1901</p>

<p>De Wet has gone, Brand has gone, Hertzog has gone, and only
Kruitzinger, with his mischievous lieutenants, is left to trouble
the minds of us who at the first regarded the advent of the
invading commandoes with apprehension&mdash;and Kruitzinger is
going.</p>

<p>It is now over three months since De Wet instructed
Kruitzinger and Brand to co-operate with him in entering the
colony, and it would be well if we who chafe over the escape of
the Boer leader would stop a while and consider carefully the
advantages our friend the enemy has acquired by his exertions in
our midst.</p>

<p>Also to count our own losses and balance&mdash;good commercial
people that we are&mdash;the profit and loss of the invasion.</p>

<p class="cp">DISMAL FAILURE</p>

<p>To do this thoroughly, do not lose sight of the primal object
of the Boer movement. A correspondent at Pretoria tells us that
it was to obtain munitions of war which were, so to speak, "left
till called for" at St Helen's Bay; but if this were so, it does
not speak too highly for our system of naval patrolling that a
ship should remain in a pretty well frequented harbourage for the
three months intervening between the first and second attempts of
the Boer leader, and until the statement is officially confirmed
I, for one, shall doubt its authenticity.</p>

<p>To my mind, there can be no doubt as to the object of the
raid, which was, as I have already said&mdash;and that three
months ago&mdash;to tap the rebel districts of the Cape Colony
and raise sufficient fighting men to fill up the gaps in the Boer
ranks, and to enable De Wet to continue the struggle&mdash;which
in these days is mainly a struggle to keep comfortably ahead of
pursuing columns. Knowing this to be the main object of the raid,
and all others being of secondary importance, the intelligent
Briton will see at a glance how dismal a failure in every sense
the Cape invasion has been. Neither men nor munitions have
resulted, and such of the invaders as are now on the way to
Ceylon have returned, or are returning, to the Orange River
Colony in a far worse plight than when they arrived.</p>

<p>To better realise tie failure, analyse the work of the various
commandoes&mdash;looking at their work from an English point of
view, and imagining that De Wet, Hertzog, and Kruitzinger were
English generals set to do certain work, and being severely
critical accordingly.</p>

<p class="cp">CHEERS&mdash;AND NOTHING MORE</p>

<p>First in importance comes Hertzog, for he accomplished more
and penetrated further west than any other of the Boer leaders,
and he it was who came within a hundred miles of the capital, so
that Capetown rose in indignation and put a little short of
10,000 men in the field, and girt itself about with emplacements
and forts and barbed wire entanglements.</p>

<p>Marching west, Hertzog and Brand, occupied in turn all the
towns of note in the North-Western Province. Philipstown,
Britstown, Carnarvon, Williston, Sutherland and Calvinia "fell"
to the investors. The procedure in every case was the same. A
patrol clattering through the tree-shaded street; a crowd of
<i>doppers</i> in their best clothes gathered near the public
offices, curious and admiring; the singing of the
<i>Volkslied</i>; a looted store; cheers for the
invader&mdash;but no recruits.</p>

<p>After comes the dusty advance guard of the British column, and
the holiday-makers disperse to their several homes, sullen and
silent, and the guns of the pursuing column rattle through a
silent and deserted street.</p>

<p>Hertzog may, perhaps, count the splendid remounts he picked up
on his way to Calvinia as equivalent in some degree to success;
but the horses he got on his way in he wore to death on his way
out. It was not for horses alone that Hertzog moved through the
worst rebel districts of Cape Colony, and the thirty recruits he
obtained could not have fulfilled his most gloomy anticipations.
Nor can the paucity of recruits be regarded in any way as
indicative of the loyalty of the Dutch in these districts, so
much as a result of the proclamation and vigorous application of
martial law, and Lord Kitchener's excellent precautionary
warnings.</p>

<p class="cp">"MY EYE IS ON YOU!"</p>

<p>The material most suitable for your active rebel (activity in
this case having reference to the joining with the King's enemies
in the open field rather than to trans-Channel Saturday-to-Monday
trips for the purpose of consulting with Krugerite emissaries,
and the taking up of a rifle rather than the faking-up of a
letter) is not the wealthy landowner who has some sort of an
education&mdash;and has much to lose. It is the <i>bywoner</i>,
the ignorant, unlettered, dog-foolish <i>bywoner</i>,* who makes
the best or worst rebel, and so long as he knows or thinks that
he is not being watched, and so long as be is not warned of the
consequence of his rebellious acts, he is ready and willing to
take the invader's rifle and use his stolen hores for the
destruction of the <i>rooinek</i>.&dagger;</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Bywoner</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;A poor
tenant farmer who labours for the owner and does some farming of
his own.<br> &dagger;<i>Rooinek</i> (Afrikaans, derogatory;
literally "red-neck")&mdash;An Englishman. ]</p>

<p>Consequently, the proclamation of martial law and the warning
he received were to him a personal message from Lord Kitchener to
this effect: "I have got my eye on you. Piet Marais, or Jan
Faure, or Petrus van Heerden!" and he remained loyal
accordingly.</p>

<p>Hertzog is back in the Orange River Colony, having achieved
nothing. He has lost in killed and wounded half as many again as
we, and man for man he is a considerable loser. Kruitzinger is
making for the Orange River Colony with as unfortunate a record.
And what of De Wet? His record is worse than unfortunate; it is
disastrous.</p>

<p class="cp">DE WET'S DISASTERS</p>

<p>De Wet was the hope of the family: he was to have retrieved
the shattered fortunes of Boerdom, and Paarl looked towards De
Wet and to his coming for a new era. De Wet was to come, join
forces with the other wandering commandoes, and marching through
Cape Colony was to sit at the gates of Cape Town and dictate
terms of the British. This is no flight of imagination: this was
the belief of the Western Province Dutch, as I have personally
ascertained.</p>

<p>Somehow these good souls fancied De Wet would manage the whole
business off his own bat. In a vague sort of way they knew that
he would require some outside help, but each man looked to his
neighbour for such active patriotism. De Wet would come: he had
been baulked once by the rains&mdash;which was an indubitable
sign from the heavens that the time was not then ripe for the
venture, but he would come, and lo! the news flashed along the
wire to Paarl, to Stellenbosch, Malmsbury, Worcester, Robertson,
Swellendam, Ceres and Capetown, De Wet had crossed the Orange and
had entered the colony&mdash;so they waited with patience.</p>

<p>But De Wet's reception was not a pleasant one. Paarl would
have been kinder. Worcester would have been less severe, but the
deputation which, headed by Plumer, met him on his arrival, was
hardly less severe than the committee which Henniker sent to give
him a send-off. De Wet came to the colony with a convoy, which he
left behind. He brought three guns, which he did not take back,
and three hundred of his men have exchanged the <i>laager</i> for
the prison camp. He lost two score killed, while we did not lose
a single man. Altogether, the invasion has been a frost, a
fizzle, a&mdash;let me use a Tommy phrase&mdash;a wash-out!</p>

<h2><a id="art13" name="art13">
TRAGEDY&mdash;A SOUTH AFRICAN SKETCH</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), June 1,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">DE AAR</p>

<p>Evening at De Aar. An awed hush has fallen upon a place of
great unquiet, for there is stern, grim work afoot, and the
breathlessness of impending tragedy has brought a sombrous
peacefulness.</p>

<p>There is no clanking crash of shunting trucks, no whistle of
engine, no clatter of detraining troops. De Aar stands, still and
is silent in the face of the quick of the one minute; who shall
be the dead of the next? The hills about are mellowing in the
golden haze of eventide, and night will come very quickly.</p>

<p>But the men who are falling in quietly before De Aar's many
tents are not preparing for night picket, and as they march
silently off to the east of the camp you can see they number too
many for the ordinary routine duties. Silently they march, no
badinage from file to file, no lightly-given jest, but each man
marching with grave face and that set look that comes to the
soldier when man's work is required of him. As silently they form
into hollow square and wait. They form three aides only, and on
the fourth are three chairs placed at intervals, and before each
chair is an ominous slit in the earth.</p>

<p>Where the even, sullen, <i>kopjes</i> are most gloomy, and the
gaunt <i>rands</i>* with boulder-bristling backs are most
foreboding, is Taaibosch. De Aar, and even the hills that mark De
Aar, are out of view, and Taaibosch stands solitary, a dejected,
eerie little siding amidst great vastness. North of Taaibosch
siding, towards De Aar, the line threads along for a hundred
yards between gaping ballast holes. It is a weird, wild country,
although the driver of the goods train that left Taaibosch siding
a month ago could see little more than a dozen yards before his
engine.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>rand</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;a rock-strewn
area of land. ]</p>

<p class="cp">THE CRIME</p>

<p>It was night; the rainy, gusty night when the driving wheels
slip on the greasy metals and the snorting engine emits steamy
roars protestingly.</p>

<p>If it was uncomfortable for the driver and his mate, it was
worse for the few soldiers crouching under tarpaulin, or
sheltering themselves as well as they could beneath the Cape
carts and waggons on the open trucks behind. Worse for them; for
the fine, searching rain insinuated itself through crack and
crevice, rent and tear. But the streaming road led to De Aar, and
beyond De Aar was Cape Town, and beyond was England, for they
were invalided soldiers homeward bound.</p>

<p>On a farm near the ballast holes were six men unconsciously
enjoying all the privileges incidental and peculiar to registered
voters of his Majesty's Colony of the Cape of Good Hope. They
were Dutch, and naturally they were&mdash;well, they sympathised
with the erstwhile republics. Commandoes had passed through the
district, but they had not joined, perhaps because they ware
afraid of disfranchisement, possibly because they could not
afford to pay the &pound;10 they would be fined for shooting
soldiers. Now, they were resolved upon a great deed, something
heroic&mdash;and safe.</p>

<p>They would wreck a train.</p>

<p>So they chose a goods train, which, would be more or less
unattended, and was considerably less dangerous to tackle than a
troop- or armoured train&mdash;the passengers of which have an
unpleasant habit of searching the darkness around by means of
low-aimed volleys.</p>

<p>The driver of the goods train knew nothing of their
intentions, nor his mate, nor the crouching soldiers beneath the
waggons.</p>

<p>And so there was murder.</p>

<p>An overturned engine, with a dying fireman lying between
tender and boiler; a wrecked train with brave men pinned
helplessly and dying like beetles on a pin. A roaring, scalding,
tumbled wreck, with dropping shots from the gallant wreckers. A
slaughtering of defenceless natives, an emptying of dead men's
purses, and a great stealing of money. This happened a
month&mdash;ago, and Taalbosch as beyond the hills crimsoning
southward.</p>

<p class="cp">PAYMENT</p>

<p>The murderers are coming up from the gaol on an ambulance, and
the firing parties marshal before the chairs.</p>

<p>Death will come sudden, but it will be painless. For them no
entanglement in shot-bored wreckage. No lingering on, hoping
against hope for timely succour. No impotent struggling for life
in the awful darkness.</p>

<p>They have had a trial, where they stood white and anxious, or
sullen and lowering, between two Guardsmen who fixed bayonets.
They had seen their comrade who had turned King's evidence slip
in and out the door&mdash;a little, pasty-faced man with a fringe
of whisker&mdash;a man who kept has eyes averted from the faces
of the men he had destroyed, and mouthed hideous grimaces in his
nervousness. They had waited for the decision of the Court, and
it had come: death for three, penal servitude for two, freedom
for the informer.</p>

<p>They had made a mistake, and they were to suffer. They had
thought it was a part of the game of war.</p>

<p>War was to them as the suspension of order. Murder was war,
theft was war, train-wrecking was war. War gave them license to
slay and burn and steal. They saw, with many hundreds of their
fellows in the Cape Colony, an opportunity for doing something
with impunity for which, in peace time, the penalty would be
death.</p>

<p>"Murder, high treason, robbery!"</p>

<p>In clear tones the commandant reads out the crimes for which
they are to suffer.</p>

<p>I do not like to think of the Yeoman pinned down with a bolt
through his side and dying slowly and consciously and alone, and
it is not Christian-like to let it rise in one's mind as the
three men, alighting from the ambulance, are blindfolded and led
to the chairs.</p>

<p>The sun drops behind the hill, and one last ray gleams along
the barrels of the levelled trifles and bathes the murderers in a
flood of golden light.</p>

THAT VICTORIAN!&mdash;A SOUTH AFRICAN SKETCH</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), June 3,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">KALKFONTEIN, North of Steynsburg, March 22,
1901</p>

<p>The S.M.O.&mdash;which in plain English means Senior Medical
Officer&mdash;drew aside the curtains of the tent and interrupted
my shaving operations.</p>

<p>We are late risers this morning, for we are waiting for
instructions from somebody, and only that a persistent individual
had been amusing himself by intermittently banging a piece of
galvanised iron on a neighbouring kopje to the banishment of all
sleep, I should have yet been dozing.</p>

<p>The S.M.O. is a genial Coldstreamer who, having served his
term in India, is privileged to swear in Hindustani, and he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Come along, <i>Roz-Roz</i>, if you want to see a little
fight." <i>Roz-Roz</i> is an abbreviation of <i>Roz-Roz dak</i>,
which is the nearest equivalent for <i>Daily Mail</i> that the
<i>bat</i>* will provide. Outside the camp kettles are steaming
and breakfast is ready&mdash;but Atkins is gathered in little
groups, eyeing a distant ridge curiously&mdash;and the centre of
each little group is a pile of arms.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Bat</i> (Hindi)&mdash;language, speech.
]</p>

<p>"Clik-clok, clik-clok, clik-clok!" No doubt about that, is
there, C.I.V.?</p>

<p>You know the old "clik-clok," and the whine of the bullet
overhead. You heard it that time Diamond Hill was the subject of
your weekly letter home.</p>

<p>You heard it just before something gave you a smack in the
side, and your knees went weak and the darkness came.</p>

<p>And you heard the R.A.M.C. orderly using violent language
concerning it, as you woke to consciousness and a stretcher.</p>

<p>So it wasn't somebody banging galvanised iron after all, and I
hurried forth in time to see that Victorian come.</p>

<p class="cp">WHAT FOLLOWS HIM</p>

<p>That Victorian came, unshaven and unkempt, his horse's flanks
aheave, and his short story was about a man who belonged to a
patrol which sighted the Boers.</p>

<p>And the Boers were very many in number, but as they were only
six times the strength of the patrol, of course the patrol felt
it couldn't creditably retire, and so it was sitting tight at the
foot of a kopje, waiting for Colonel Henniker to sally out, when
it had no doubt that everything would end more or less unhappily
for the Boers.</p>

<p>It was one of the true little stories that the nursing Scouts
tell the restless column to beep it quiet. And so we moved out:
Henniker, burly and alert, Powell, the gunner, cheerful and
unconcerned, the Victorian gleeful and profane, and all the time
from the ridge ahead the spasmodic clap of the Mauser sounded,
"Clik-clok, clik-clok!"</p>

<p>We are forming a lane, which is a variation of the cordon.</p>

<p>When you put half-a-dozen columns round De Wet at a distance
of a score of miles one from the other, except at one point where
the gap is forty miles in width, you call it a cordon, and the
big gap you refer to as the line of least resistance.</p>

<p>When you take a long stretch of country and line two sides of
at with columns, you call it a lane, and if the enemy doesn't
advance straight up the centre of that lane, and give everybody a
chance of falling on him and devouring him, it is because he has
no conception of his duty as a sportsman.</p>

<p>We are on the left side of the lane; Codrington is at
Venterstadt, Crabbie is at Vlakfontein, and Henniker is further
south and in line.</p>

<p class="cp">A REARGUARD ACTION</p>

<p>The burghers we have struck are not trying to break
through&mdash; not a bit. They, are simply coming up behind us,
almost on the same road; we are in their way, and they are trying
to push us off&mdash;hence the disturbance.</p>

<p>"Clik-clok-clok-clok-clok!"</p>

<p>A fusillade; the Yeomanry and Victorians that moved from camp
in solid chunks are stretching themselves into long skinny
skirmishing lines, and are galloping for protecting ridges,
swerving and wheeling slightly leftward, for the Boers' position
lies diagonally commanding the road. Powell's guns have halted,
and the foremost Victorians are firing steadily from behind the
walls of a heaven-sent Kraal.</p>

<p>The gunners have not stopped to admire the scenery, and a
tiny, white woolly ball catching on to the shoulder of the kopje
which shelters the enemy proclaims the proximity of percussion
shrapnel.</p>

<p>We know it is a rear-guard action; that the main body of the
Boers is miles away; we know that, probably by the time our guns
get into action the ridge does not shelter more than twenty
Boers.</p>

<p>If the mountain was not there, if the country leading up to
the mountain was not a succession of ridges each commanding the
other, if there were no other kopjes for the Boers to retire
on&mdash;in fact, if it were not South Africa we were fighting
in, but Salisbury Plain, we should send out a corporal's picket
and arrest "the enemy." As it is, we shell them till the sniping
ceases&mdash;and that Victorian comes and tells us that the
commando had broken clear. That Victorian always comes.</p>

<p class="cp">THE WAY HE COMES AND GOES</p>

<p>From the flanks, or the front, or from the rear he arrives,
and he has always got a story worth telling, and doubly worth
hearing. As the column chases along at the breakneck speed of
three-and-a-half miles an hour, he drops down from the top of a
kopje and bumps into the advance guard.</p>

<p>And he tells the officer commanding that force many things;
there are Boers on the farm three miles ahead!, or a Boer convoy
is five miles to the left front.</p>

<p>Sometimes he is flicked across the firm line of the horizon
and slides down to the main body with news, and suspicions and
opinions.</p>

<p>You can call him "The Scout," but he is a sort of nurse that
has the infant column in his charge, and he feels his
responsibility.</p>

<p>For days he will ride&mdash;a mote on the sky-line, and then
he will come tearing down to the trailing troops, and jerking up
his horse will gaze approvingly on us as we pass him. He will
ride miles and miles away from the road and never lose himself
once, that Victorian, and he sees lots and lots that the column
never sees or dreams of.</p>

<p>Out he goes to the dark unknown, with a lighted pipe between
his teeth and his sooty billy clattering at his saddle, and when
he comes back he will know more about the farms within a ten-mile
radius, their values, their possibilities as forage providers,
and the loyalty of their owners than the smartest Intelligence
Officer that ever wore a khaki yachting cap, and he will
certainly have a better idea of the topography of the country
than the Government surveyor who prepares the maps we march by.
Sometimes he stays out all night&mdash;the gay dog!&mdash;and
turns up in the morning after a night's debauch on rain-sodden
biscuit and doubtful bully beef. Sometimes he doesn't turn up at
all, and then Crooke-Lawless sends an ambulance out for
him&mdash;and under the driver's seat is a spade.</p>

<h2><a id="art15" name="art15">MRS. RESERVIST</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Evening Post</i> (New Zealand), June 29, 1901</h3>

<p class="cp">WITH THE LIMELIGHT OFF</p>

<p class="cp">BETHULIE, April 12, 1901</p>

<p>And what of Mrs. Reservist Atkins all this time? In the first
act&mdash;or was it the prologue&mdash;she figured prominently
enough, but to-day she is the "voice without," sans glitter, sans
limelight, and uninteresting. Mrs. Atkins "on the strength" is
another person. She is separated from her husband truly, but so
is her sister in the officers' quarters. Her husband is possibly
in great danger, from shot and disease, but so are the husband's
sweethearts, brothers, or sons of a million.</p>

<p>It is Mrs. Reservist Atkins who is suffering to-day, and her
case seems well-nigh desperate. The wife of the soldier married
on the strength of the regiment is parted from him, but she is in
comfortable Government quarters, or is drawing allowances for
such. She is bereft of his presence, but she draws one-half of
his pay, and bread and meat and fuel and lighting.</p>

<p class="cp">WIVES WHO SUFFER</p>

<p>Because of these advantages she possesses I would not for a
moment attempt to belittle the unselfish devotion and self-
sacrifice of the soldier's wife, nor would I suggest that the
shilling a day she receives together with the tree quarters and
rations, places her in a position of affluence, but I do wish to
differentiate between the two wives.</p>

<p>I must confess that I gave little thought to the subject until
very recently. The deep-rooted satisfaction engendered by the
action of this journal at the beginning of the war and other
private enterprises on the soldiers' behalf had not disappeared.
If one's thoughts reverted at all to the "little things left
behind" it was with a feeling of thankfulness that they were not
being left to the cold-blooded mercy of the Commissioners of the
Patriotic Fund, but were cared for by warm-hearted business men
who would not hesitate to give a sovereign to a starving woman
without demanding her birth certificate, her marriage lines, and
particulars of her baby's teething.</p>

<p>The other day I jokingly asked my soldier servant whether he
had not saved a small fortune during the war.</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered grimly, "so small that I could put it in my
eye and see through it! Fortune! Why, for the last six months
I've had all my work cut out to prevent my wife starving and my
kids from going into the workhouse."</p>

<p class="cp">A SHILLING A WEEK</p>

<p>For some time I could not believe but that Atkins was speaking
figuratively. However, I soon discovered that what he had told me
was not only too true, but that his case was one of thousands
similar.</p>

<p>He had been employed in a very good situation, and at the time
he was called up to join his corps was in receipt of 36s a week.
His employers, with the generosity which consistently marked
their behaviour towards their men at the beginning of the war,
guaranteed to keep his billet open for him during the time he was
away on active service, which they estimated would be six months,
and promised to give his wife half-pay during that period. Six
months passed, and the end of the war was not in sight, and the
employers cheerfully extended the period for another three
months, and at the end of that time a still further term.</p>

<p>At the end of that time; however, the situation was filled,
and the firm was reluctantly compelled to stop the half-pay. At
this stage of the proceedings the situation became alarming for
the Reservist's wife.</p>

<p>The meagre savings of her husband were soon absorbed, and the
8s a week he was able to send her did little more than pay I the
rent of the two rooms she occupied. So she applied for relief to
the commissioners of a fund which I will call the Society for
Providing Aged Colonels with Charitable Employment. After she had
made several applications, and had instructed many decrepit
senior officers with particulars regarding her past, her views on
Transubstantiation and her Religious Convictions, and had
listened to divers lectures on the Improvidence of Early
Marriages, she was gravely informed that the society had
considered her case favourably and was prepared to endow her with
the munificent sum of 2s per week, paid weekly&mdash;and sign
here!</p>

<p class="cp">EVERYWHERE THE SAME STORY</p>

<p>She fell ill, however, and was unable to appear in person to
draw the "allowance," which was accordingly reduced to 1s.</p>

<p>"And she wrote out to me," said Atkins, wrathfully, "asking me
what she should do with the shilling, an' I wrote "back and told
her to tell 'em to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Well, Atkins's message to his wife was one which I am sure no
wife, however obedient, would repeat to such charitable
gentlemen.</p>

<p>After hearing this I never lost an opportunity of learning
from the men of the Reserve who had wives how matters stood at
home.</p>

<p>From all I have heard the same story. Some&mdash;a very
few&mdash;were still drawing half-pay; some swore by the
"Absentminded Beggar" Fund; but were all agreed that no one
private enterprise could hope to cope with the ever-increasing
sum of distress among Reservists' wives. If I am to believe the
stories I have heard from the men themselves&mdash;and I do
believe them&mdash;stories told in despairing notes with gestures
of hopelessness, of poverty and starvation in homes which before
the war were models of comfort and plenty; if my opinion is to be
influenced by the husky apology of the soldier for the tear which
will come&mdash;then I should say to you stalwarts of Empire, who
would give your last cents for the maintenance of its dominion,
to you ultrasensitive pro-Boers who wax hysteric over a charge of
dynamite deftly inserted into the corner of a rebel's
farm&mdash;here is a recipient for your wealth, here is a subject
for your pity.</p>

<p class="cp">THE NATIONAL DUTY</p>

<p>Now what are you going to do about it? I have said before that
no one enterprise can hope to relieve the distress. It is clearly
a matter which the Government should take in hand, not for now,
but for always. In his reorganisation of the Army, Mr. Brodick
will do well to take into account, and make provision for the
wife that the British soldier, released from the restrictions of
military life takes unto himself.</p>

<p>A sum weekly should be guaranteed to the wife of a Reservist
who is called away from his position of breadwinner, and it would
be ridiculous to pretend that the Government could not afford the
extra outlay. A Government that can pay the irregular troops at
the Cape 5s a day could surely afford to guarantee two or three
shillings extra <i>per diem</i> to the wives of men who risk
their lives for a half-penny an hour! I am sure that such a
provision will have to be made if we ever contemplate mobilising
the Army Reserve on any future occasion.</p>

<p>A man who runs away and leaves his wife chargeable to the
parish is a scoundrel. A soldier who is drawn from his civilian
avocation to fight his country's battles and leaves his wife
destitute is willy-nilly a patriot, and the Reservist of the
future may question whether the price of patriotism is not too
high. In the meantime, the Government has a million to spare. No?
Wasn't there some talk of devoting a million towards making Happy
Homes for Weary Burghers?</p>

A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE WAR</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Bush Advocate</i> (New Zealand), July 9, 1901</h3>

<p class="cp">SOLID PROGRESS IN MANY QUARTERS</p>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG, May 11, 1901</p>

<p>The situation is more encouraging, although the aspect of
affairs throughout the two colonies cannot truthfully be termed
completely satisfactory.</p>

<p>North of Pretoria communication with Pietersburg remains
uninterrupted, but a considerable number of the enemy are
scattered throughout the Zoutspanberg bush veldt. Of the columns
sent to clear the Eastern Transvaal only one or two met with
resistance, which was very slight, the Boers making off or
doubling round.</p>

<p>In the Western Transvaal the country between Pretoria and
Mafeking is still regarded as dangerous for convoys unless they
are strongly guarded. Lord Methuen's splendid doggedness,
however, is bearing fruit, and a number of surrenders in that
district show that the Boers are being worn down by his
persistence. Da la Rey's burghers hang round Johannesburg while
he himself is in the neighbourhood of Wolmaranstadt.</p>

<p>In Orange River Colony the Boer forces have been divided into
small parties, each having a section of the railway line to
harass. Their mode is to sleep twenty miles away from their
sections, and ride at night, either to make an attack on a small
bridge guard or attempt to blow up the line. De Wet lately
superintended a commando thus engaged, which recently captured a
small railside garrison.</p>

<p>The new blockhouses which are being built all over both
colonies will enable much smaller garrisons than already exist
for the purpose of guarding bridges, culverts, and roads to hold
any amount of Boers in check.</p>

<p>There is a probability that Hertzog and Brand, who appear to
be in the south of Orange River Colony, will attempt again to
enter Cape Colony shortly, and there is a possibility that De
Wet, who is relieved to be moving towards the Orange, will
accompany them, but in a subordinate position.</p>

<p>The activity of the officers in charge of the sections of the
railway between Bloemfontein and Viljoen's Drift renders the work
of railside raiders almost impossible, so that the train-wrecking
will soon be a thing of the past. It is significant, however,
that while a year ago trains ran regularly from Capetown to
Bloemfontein they are now detained during the night at Nauuwpoort
and Springfontein.</p>

<p>Regarding the insistent rumors about the condition of the
troops in the field, it cannot be too emphatically repeated that
the men are physically fit and perfectly willing to do anything.
By the withdrawal from South Africa of time-expired yeomen,
militiamen, and volunteers, and the replacement of these with new
drafts, much cause for discontent and dissatisfaction has been
removed, since those men who were detained over the specified
time grumbled. The only discontent now is among the Reservists,
many of whose wives are in distressed circumstances, and whose
civil situations are now filled up. An assurance from the
Government that provision would be made to assist these women and
a promise of aid to obtain employment, would restore the men's
equanimity.</p>

<p>There appears to be a suspicion at Home that the dragging on
of the war is caused by the staleness of the troops, but I would
point out the fact that for the most part new yeomen and fresh
colonial drafts are being utilised for active movements, while
infantry are used forming garrisons.</p>

<p>The Government should make every attempt to induce the
Australians, yeomen and Canadians who served previously to return
to service. These men are thoroughly recuperated, and their
renewed interest and practical knowledge of the country and its
conditions would be invaluable.</p>

<p>The best indication of the feeling here is the local
recruiting returns, which show an unfailing supply in response to
the military demand. The army cannot be stale while it is
receiving such a splendid leaven from the colonies.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the aspect of affairs is encouraging. I am
informed that Lord Kitchener is satisfied with the progress of
his operations. Those, people at Home who expect a dramatic
finish to the war by some decisive action will be
disappointed.</p>

<p>The end can only come by the constant wearing down of the Boer
forces. The winter, which promises to be severe, is a great
factor. The steady return of the refugees to the Rand will
necessarily discourage the Boers, and illustrate the futility of
resistance. Colonials agree that while England should maintain an
unshakable attitude on the essential points of the settlement,
sentimental concession might advantageously be made, for
instance, regarding the bitter objection of the Boers Io being
placed on the legislative level of the Kaffirs.</p>

<h2><a id="art17" name="art17">"KITCHENER'S THE BLOKE"</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), July 12,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">MR ATKINS DISCUSSES DE WET</p>

<p class="cp">SPRINGFONTEIN (Orange River Colony), May 4,
1901</p>

<p>Such a night as can only be experienced in South
Africa&mdash;the stars great, liquid, white points of fire in the
blue-black dome, and just enough moon to show where sky ends and
veldt begins.</p>

<p>Since this be the enemy's country, where treason is unknown
and only oath-breaking is heinous, we may not proceed other than
in the light of day, lest the cunning mind of the small commando
devise destruction in the form of a gun-barrel choked with
nitroglycerine, with wires and caps and artful clockwork
arrangements designed to operate with suddenness, bringing
disorder, wrack, death, mutilation, and great beastliness to poor
devils travelling first-class on Press tickets.</p>

<p>Therefore the train is drawn up by Springfontein platform, and
dinner having been served at 5.30 instead of 7.30 owing to the
refreshment-room keeper having in engagement at the latter hour,
I have nothing, to do but to sit and listen to Atkins discussing
questions of the day&mdash;for Atkins is gathered outside the
shuttered window of my saloon, and he holds views.</p>

<p class="cp">THE BIG QUESTIONS</p>

<p>The agenda of the Platform Debating Society was prolific in
subjects, and contained, among others: Should soldiers receive
5s. a day in war time? Shall we ever catch De Wet? Are the
Yeomanry good soldiers? Does a single eyeglass assist the
eyesight? Will the Militia ever go home? When will the war end?
and, Is Kitchener a great general? Some of the subjects
dovetailed into others, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Voice from Without</i>: 'E's the man to finish the war. No
'arf larks about 'im. Can't stand no eyeglasses, 'e can't; no
'umbug an' no old buck. Buller goes up to 'im an' says, "I'm
general 'ere," 'e says.</p>

<p><i>Another Voice (superiorly)</i>: Where was this?</p>

<p><i>First Voice (vaguely)</i>: Up in Natal somewhere.</p>

<p><i>Superior Voice</i>: Kitchener wasn't never in Natal.</p>

<p><i>First Voice (sternly)</i>: Never mind where he was. Buller
comes up to 'im an' says, "Look 'ere, I'm general 'ere," 'e says,
"and I'll thank you to get orf the battlefield whilst I'm a-
conductin' my operations." "Oh!" says Kitchener, "p'raps you
don't know that I'm a Lord, while you're only a Sir," 'e
says.</p>

<p><i>Superior Voice</i>: That don't make no difference.</p>

<p><i>First Voice</i>: Wot don't?</p>

<p><i>Superior Voice (scathingly)</i>: Sirs an' Lords ain't no
rank, fat 'ead, else you'd 'ave the Dook o' Westminster
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p><i>Third Voice (huskily)</i>: My opinion you're torkin' out of
the back of your 'ead.</p>

<p><i>Smithy (bitterly):</i> P'raps you're tellin' this yarn, an'
p'raps I ain't; any'ow, whether it makes no difference about
bein' a Lord or Sir or not, that's wot Kitchener told
Buller&mdash;'t any rate. Kitchener's the bloke to end this
war.</p>

<p class="cp">"WHY DOES'NT HE CATCH DE WIT?"</p>

<p>Several voices, hitherto silent, rise to acclaim this
sentiment.</p>

<p><i>Smithy (waxing enthusiastic at his support)</i>: Why e's
got more sense in 'is little finger
than&mdash;than&mdash;(<i>lamely</i>) twenty Botha's, and he'd no
more think twice about shootin' you or me than I would about
killin' a fly.</p>

<p>The Greek chorus asserts itself.</p>

<p><i>Youthful Voice (well modulated)</i>: Why doesn't he catch
De Wet, then?</p>

<p><i>Three Voices (mockingly and scornfully)</i>: Why doesn't 'e
catch De Wet?</p>

<p><i>Smithy (finely sarcastic)</i>: Why don't 'e catch De Wet?
Look 'ere, you're a Yeoman, ain't you?</p>

<p><i>Modulated Voice (nervously)</i>: Yes.</p>

<p><i>Smithy (indignantly)</i>: And just come out, take my oath.
Thought you was. Why don't 'e catch De Wet, my lad? Why, because
'e can't trust the Yeomanry with anyone else.</p>

<p>Roars of laughter and a mild voice asking for a fuller
explanation.</p>

<p><i>Smithy</i>: Well, 'ow does a soldier learn to be a
soldier&mdash;by experience, ain't that it? And no Yeoman ain't a
real Yeoman till 'e's been captured twice&mdash;ain't that so?
An' where will you find a commandant as'll treat a Yeoman so nice
an' kind an' gentle as De Wet? Why don't 'e catch De Wet? Why, De
Wet's a bloomin' field trainin' an' Aldershot manoeuvres to a
Yeoman!</p>

<p class="cp">ON EYEGLASSES</p>

<p>After a pause, during which the mild young Yeoman presumably
retires, somebody asks why Kitchener objects to the monocle, but
relied on conveying the sense of his question by referring to it
as "a pane of glass."</p>

<p>Smithy: Cos 'e's a soldier an' likes to see everything reg'lar
an' well balanced. If 'e 'ad 'is way, sergeants would 'ave
stripes on each arm an' soldiers 'ave medals on both breasts.
Wot's a single eyeglass but unreg'lar? One side of the face is
all glass, an' the other side's all&mdash;all face. If they'd
wear spectacles it'd be all right but the young officers won't
wear spectacles for fear of being mistaken for colonels and
drafted to the Army Pay Corps.</p>

<p><i>Husky Voice (suspiciously)</i>: Wot are you gettin'
at&mdash;wot's the Army Pay Corps got to do with it?</p>

<p>Smithy (pleasantly): Oh, it's only a bit of a joke of
mine&mdash;sarcasm.</p>

<p>Here follow several earnest appeals to Smithy not to dislocate
his jaw using long words.</p>

<p>By easy stages the debate became theological, with many and
weird premises, with divers curious and unprintable
deductions.</p>

<p>Dear old Atkins!</p>

<p>Here were a dozen men who had probably seen more battles in
one year than most generals see in a lifetime, and yet their talk
was not of war, or bloodshed, or great daring, but just the
subjects, the self-same subjects, they would argue out in times
of peace over common beer at the bar of the "Green Man."</p>

<p>It seemed more than incongruous at times to hear&mdash;here in
the loneliness of the rolling veldt, with the black peaks of the
distant hills, sooty bulks against the velvet-black sky-line,
with death lurking in the darkness about, and over all the solemn
hush of even&mdash;it seems strange, not to say unnatural, when
Tommies, who, in keeping with the scene, should by rights be
speaking in awed whispers of golden deeds and glorious
sacrifices, are arguing in strident cockney on the legitimacy of
the birth of Moses.</p>

<p>"Found 'im in the bulrushes&mdash;yuss, that's wot she
said."</p>

VELDT ALDERSHOT<br>
A PICTURE OF BLOEMFONTEIN</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), July 20,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">THE TWO CONTRASTED</p>

<p>What is there about Bloemfontein that suggests Aldershot so
vividly?</p>

<p>There is something&mdash;a something that grows on you as you
walk through the streets of the town or saunter about the
suburbs. Perhaps it is only the military element to be found to-
day here; or perhaps it is the architecture, the solid
utilitiarianism of the public buildings, the many blood-red
blocks&mdash;ah! that is it! It is the redness of Bloemfontein
that suggests Aldershot.</p>

<p>The private houses, the flamboyant public offices, the ruddy-
faced bureau&mdash;that is Aldershot. "Imagine
Aldershot&mdash;the Aldershot that starts north of the cavalry
barracks and runs to the Farnborough Road. Imagine it unkempt and
untidy, with a sprinkling of the old huts still standing, and you
have, Bloemfontein. Rather a far-fetched resemblance, you will
tell me; but I am dealing only in impressions, and that is how
Bloemfontein impresses me.</p>

<p class="cp">CAMP BUSTLE</p>

<p>Leave the architecture alone, and the resemblance is more
impressive. A military policeman stands at every corner, there is
a ceaseless procession of orderlies and staff officers moving
through the streets, and an intermittent tramp, tramp of armed
parties coming and going across the Market Square.</p>

<p>Guards returning from Naval Hill Redoubt; guards going out to
the Boer refugee camp; reliefs tramping off to No.9 general
hospital; pickets returning from the outlying lines&mdash;but a
little stretch of the imagination, and they are musketry parties
with Ash Ranges behind them.</p>

<p>There is a lazy feeling in the air; let us idle. Let us dawdle
along the shop fronts and see what commercial Bloemfontein tempts
us with. A grocer's: Preserved rations, tinned meat, chocolate
food, portable kitcheners (you can carry them in your pocket).
Here is a tailors; Khaki serge in all shades and qualities,
collar tabs a specialty, badges of rank, field service caps,
staff caps, and military gloves. H'in. Here is a shoemaker's:
Field boots and Stohwasser puttee leggings. A watchmaker and
jeweller's: Zeiss glasses and compasses in one window, and C.I.V.
scarf-pins in the other. A stationer's: Army forms and passes in
accordance with King's Regulations. A photographer's show case:
Military groups and cabinets of staff officers. Bloemfontein is
military.</p>

<p class="cp">THE VANISHED ENEMY</p>

<p>We are in the heart of the enemy's country, really and truly
the enemy's country. Not the country of the enemy's friend, but
in the heart of his very own country, in the very town where war
was made, and on the deep-fronted desk from which Steyn launched
his thunders en R.A.M.C. man has set up a patent filter as a sign
of our presence. And yet it is very unreal; it does not seem like
Bloemfontein, and it does seem like Aldershot. A kopje overlooks
the town, and the zig-zag streak of red gouged in the face of it
is a road leading up to a 4.7 gun&mdash;but the guns on Dober
Pier are as interesting. Over there beyond the outlying belt of
camps with which we are girt about, the veldt is still red where
the retreating burghers tramped off the green as they rushed for
Driefontein&mdash;but Caesar made the Old Kent Road. It seems so
long ago, this time of Bloemfontein's martial importance, so
long, indeed, that you would not feel surprised to turn up the
story of the occupation in a musty tome and read that&mdash;"My
Lord Robertf fent in a meffenger to demand the furrender of the
town."</p>

<p>That is just the feeling you get in Bloemfontein&mdash; a
sense of unfitness of things; you know you are in the midst of it
all, and yet you feel out of it; you are like a blind man at a
ballet. The good folk of Bloemfontein seem to know nothing about
the war; all the news they get comes from England, and appears in
the <i>Post</i> four days late, for the <i>Post</i>&mdash;our old
acquaintance <i>The Friend</i> under another title&mdash;is
cursed with a censorship. So they have got used to feeling at
peace. When they hear that the Boers have wrecked a hospital
train, they say, "Dear me! How very dreadful!" and intelligence
of a little bloodshed causes them to peer over their spectacles
and exclaim, "What are we coming to? Where's the police?" But
perhaps this, too, is an impression.</p>

<p class="cp">POLICE WAITING FOR PEACE</p>

<p>On the hill, under the shadow of the great overtowering fort,
are the green- and orange-striped sentry boxes of the South
African Constabulary&mdash;B.-P.'s Own. I am told that, so
confident is Pretoria that the war is going to end soon, that
this force is held in hourly readiness to go out and scour the
country&mdash;since a proclamation of peace, attendant upon the
surrender of Botha, will be regarded, and rightly so, as placing
all roving bands&mdash;gallant hospital-train-wrecking, food-
poisoning souls!&mdash;as without the pale.</p>

<p>South of here the country is quiet; that is to say, it is as
quiet as the midland districts of Cape Colony. There are small
scattered parties of Boers about, hanging round Thaba N'chu,
keeping in touch with the railway line, but generally out of all
touch with our troops. We have meagre garrisons strung out
between this place and Norval's Pont, and one or two roving
columns hustling round such bodies of Boers, concentrated of
sufficient strength to justify the movement of a large force of
our troops. Though weak, the railside garrisons are each little
fortresses. Every piece of rising ground is capped by earthworks,
every kopje of any commanding eminence adjacent to the line is
manned and gunned, and by the bridges, grim, granite-faced block
houses, loop-holed and cunning of interior, are rising daily.</p>

<p class="cp">NOT TO BE COUNTED ON</p>

<p>In spite of the comparative calm which now prevails it will
not be many days, I take it, before the south of the Orange River
Colony will be again agitated, for the advent of Kruitzinger with
his lieutenants will of course bring about a recrudescence of
that activity which De Wet in his palmiest days inspired.
Kruitzinger's retirement from the Cape Colony will set free a
number of columns, Scobell's, Grenfell's, Haigh's, Henniker's,
Crewe's and De Lisle's, and these would have a better chance of
dealing with the marauder here, in this country denuded alike of
horses and food, than in the well-stocked, traitor-infested
districts south of the Orange River. This is all by the way, and
is told with the object of justifying myself should, by the time
this letter is in print, the Orange River Colony be in such a
state of uproar as to render my remarks on its pacific condition,
ridiculous in the sight of man and me a fool before my kind.</p>

<p>There is one place about Bloemfontein which suggests war, and
must always be remembered as something strangely and terribly
new, and that because it is linked with disaster. For the memory
of disasters always lives; so that Majuba must stand before
Boomplaats, Magersfontein be remembered when Modder River will be
forgotten, and Pieter's Hill and its gallant dead be for ever
overshadowed by Spion Kop and its ghastly blunders.</p>

<p>East of Bloemfontein and north the rolling plain humps itself
into an irregular hill&mdash;on the other side of that is
Sannah's Post. It was at the base of the hill that British
commanders threshed out a question of military etiquette; it was
on the other side that we lost our guns. Without the glamour of
romance that Sannah's Post sheds; military Bloemfontein is
commonplace, cheap, and tawdry.</p>

<p>Why, in the drapers' shops you can buy Baden-Powell hats and
khaki neckties!</p>

<h2><a id="art19" name="art19">THAT TIRED FEELING!</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), July 27,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">HOW TOMMY FEELS&mdash;NOT STALE BUT "FED-UP"</p>

<p class="cp">KLERKSDORP, May 11, 1901</p>

<p>It would be ridiculous on my part if I asked you whether you
were tired of the war, if you were sick to death of its crawling
progress, if you were bored to extinction with its monotony. Of
course you are.</p>

<p>You may not have been fighting yourself. Your acquaintance
with the dangers and hardships and pathos of campaigning may be
strictly biographic, so that your cognisance of bloodshed was
confined to a 4.7 gun in action&mdash; sandwiched between the
Texas Fire Brigade and a falling smoke-stack. Whether you viewed
the progress of events in South Africa from a stall at the
Palace, or from the back of an ungroomed Cape pony, it comes to
about the same thing&mdash;you are weary of it.</p>

<p>Your whole soul cries aloud in its satisfaction: "For heaven's
sake give us famine or a great fire in the city, or a fall in
Yankee Rails, or an outsider's Derby&mdash;anything but war!"</p>

<p class="cp">BUT NOT STALE</p>

<p>You seem a very inconsistent people, for you have only to
weaken a little, only show by public meeting and demonstration
that you are tired, really tired of the war, and the strongest
Ministry that ever answered questions would be obliged to put an
end to your weariness and bring the war to a finish. You have
only got to give unmistakable evidence of your determination to
get peace at almost any price, and you may purchase for
yourselves a halcyon calm which will last three or four months,
if, indeed, not for a whole year.</p>

<p>Yet I know, and the Army knows, that you would not purchase
peace in this way; that when you are asked to vote another ten
millions, or twenty millions, or forty millions, you will put
your hands in your pockets and pay. That is because you have lost
your temper, but have not lost your spirit. You have lost
interest in the minor incidents of the struggle, but have not
lost any of the vigour which inspires you in your determination
to see the thing through to the bitter end.</p>

<p>In fact and in fine, your attitude aptly illustrates the
difference between Tiredness and Staleness, so long as you
realise the difference between these qualities. The stories of
Tommy Atkins's "tiredness," which seem to have been enjoying
quite a vogue at Home just now, need not alarm you.</p>

<p>Tommy is tired, but he is not stale. He is "fed up" with the
war, with the constant marching and counter-marching, the
occasional short rations and the frequent rains, the blank
monotony of life on the veldt. He chafes at the dragging on of
the war, and views with dismay its prolongation. He is more
patient than you, however, and when they dump him down by the
side of the railway line and tell him to keep his eye on an
adjacent bridge he settles himself down to the prospect of six
months' duty by the ugly girdered span in the midst of a
featureless plain with more fortitude than most men will display
who have to wait five minutes for an unpunctual train.</p>

<p class="cp">MONOTONY OF BRIDGE GUARD</p>

<p>He clears a space by the side of the line and traces out the
name of his company and regiment in little white stones, for the
information of the daily mail train, the passengers of which
chuck him out week-old newspapers. In a month he knows all the
girders of the bridge as if they were old friends. You see no
difference in any part of the plain. He is acquainted with every
stone visible. He has counted every rivet the bridge has, and
knows there are three more on one side than on the other. He
wonders why this is so, and he and his tent-fellows argue the
question out nightly.</p>

<p>Sometimes, while he is counting for the thousandth time the
mortar lines in the stone pier, and while he is multiplying these
by the number of sleepers and dividing the result by the number
of rails on his beat, a girder rings musically, and he looks
round to see how much paint the sniper's bullet takes off. This
is the sort of life he lives. For weeks together his is a
colourless, dreary, dull existence; there are interesting
intervals, when the Boer tries to murder him at two thousand
yards; there are gay nights, when he lies out in the open for the
sniper in a patiently murderous mood; but these days do not come
very often.</p>

<p>Supposing instead of doing bridge guard he is with a column
chasing De la Ray, or hustling Botha, or pursuing De Wet. In the
first place, as a rule he doesn't know why he is ordered to
parade at daybreak with three days' rations. He is not told why
he is marched out. He has no idea of the distance he is to be
marched the first day or how long he will remain at his first
camping place. He speculates more or less idly on the object of
the march, But so many times previously has he been taken out in
the self-same manner that he does not care whether he is to round
in cattle, burn a farm, capture a <i>laager</i>, or occupy a
town.</p>

<p>His company or squadron officer is a good sort, and will tell
him as much as is good for him to know, but the chances are that
the officer will know less than the man of the general's
intentions, and, being blessed with a higher order of
intelligence than his humble comrade, his speculations will be
even wilder and more original than Tommy's.</p>

<p class="cp">THEN MR. ATKINS GETS CROSS</p>

<p>Perhaps after the column starts, a rumour runs from horseman
to horseman that the trek is to be ten miles, and Tommy
accordingly forms plans for washing shirts and sewing on buttons.
Ten miles are covered, and more, and no sign or indication of the
commander's intention to halt. Tommy gets restless. A few miles
more and he is irritable, and is inwardly damning the war into
little heaps. He is now in the mood when an unsophisticated
journalist of pro-Boer proclivities could find in his
conversation ample material for an article on "Is Our Army
Mutinous?" A few more miles and the news goes round that the
day's trek is to be twenty-five miles, and Tommy abandons all
hope of washing his shirt and remarks with conviction that its a
warmth of pity that the corpuscled general hasn't got a qualified
mind of his own.</p>

<p>Twenty-five miles are covered, and a dogged, tired, bad-
tempered Tommy does not even raise his eyebrows when he is
informed that thirty-five miles is to be the sum of his days
exertion Suddenly the long skirmishing, line which has been
screening the column's advance buckles and squirms, and
disappears to cover. Then comes the melancholy thump, thump,
thump of a pom pom&mdash;and Tommy is a new man. He may have
heard the sound a thousand times before, he may have been an old
soldier in the Ladysmith days, but as the enemy's one-pound
shells cough through the air he is another man.</p>

<p>Tired he is&mdash;tired as a man can be of the unbroken
monotony of things, but not stale. Not stale, do you hear? See
the hands that fidget excitedly with the lock of the rifle that
rests on his thigh; they are the same hands that a few minutes
before swung listlessly by his sides. See the lowered brow and
the eager eyes, and the compressed lips. It is the same face that
frowned, the same eyes that dozed, the same lips that hinted
darkly of chucking the Army and joining a "bally" circus.</p>

<p>Tired, but not stale. Fitter now than ever, and as willing. He
can march further than he could in the first days of the war. Was
he stale then? He is just as willing to risk death and mutilation
to-day as he was when he took Pieter's Hill or lay out all those
fiery, thirsty hours when Modder River lay between us and our
bivouac. Was he stale then?</p>

<p class="cp">OFFICER'S DIMINISHED ZEAL</p>

<p>Whether his officer is as keen now as then is another matter;
but there is no lack of zeal among the men of the lower ranks. It
is quits the thing nowadays to collect all the odium which we
feel the Army merits and stick it on to the officer. If an attack
goes wrong we blame the officer. We call him an Uneducated Fool,
an Empty-headed Fashion- plate; and if we write stories about the
war we delicately refer to him as Captain Glasseye.</p>

<p>If by chance he is a Staff College man, educated in warfare,
we say: "Pooh! What's the good of a Military Pundit? Give me an
uneducated colonial who doesn't know a re-entrant from a
bastion."</p>

<p>I do not wish, with all due respect to you, to be pricked in
number with the fashionable, since it is the fashion to lay all
blame on the officer; but I will say that the curse of the
campaign is the one or two men who are to be found in most
regiments who want to get home in time for the shooting, or
hunting, or racing. One such man, by constantly harping on the
subject, will make a whole regiment discontented.</p>

<p>Perhaps he manages to get home, and then, to justify his
presence in England, he says that he is not the only one who
wanted to get home&mdash;"The whole bally Army's stale,
sir&mdash;stale as ditch-water, sir; everybody's sick of it,
everybody's anxious to get home, I assure you. Otherwise I should
not be here."</p>

A SUNDAY MORNING CITY<br>
INTO JOHANNESBURG BY THE STAGE DOOR</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), August 6,
1901</h3>

<p>A mine to the left, then a few miles run over a rolling,
grassy down, and a mine to the right. This and the occasional
espial of a smoke stack on the horizon are the hints the
traveller receives of approaching Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Then the permanent way broadens, and the one line of rails
becomes two, the two become four, and the mines become thicker,
and galvanised-iron houses and shanties slouch about the
landscape. Then the four lines widen into a labyrinth of points
and sidings, and fussy puffing little engines, local to the spot,
snort approvingly to the dust-covered main-line brother, who,
greatly daring, has penetrated safely from the outer
wilderness.</p>

<p class="cp">ELANDSFONTEIN JUNCTION</p>

<p>By rights this should be Johannesburg, for everything suggests
the bustle and the untidy hurry of a miners' town. The delver's
presence is manifest. On either side and all about, the evidence
of his craft blocks out the circling horizon, and stands in the
great white tailing heaps, and the trolley lines that feed them;
in the overpowering ugliness of hauling gear, in the bleak,
unbeautiful batteries. This is Elandsfontein, the Transvaal De
Aar. You change here for Pretoria or Johannesburg or Ladysmith.
From Elandsfontein the line curves westward to Johannesburg.</p>

<p>The names of the little wayside stations seem familiar. The
first one you have heard before, but where on earth was it? Has
it a connection with a battle, or a disaster, or a speech, or a
policy? The second puts your mind at rest&mdash;it is a familiar
name, and you have seen it in the "latest closing prices."
"Simmer and Jack " station it is, and like its fellows on the
line is a broad-platformed, red-roofed, tidy little model
station, and an Atkins in khaki wags a white flag, and
manipulates the foreign-looking signals. It was almost dark
when</p>

<p>I set out from Elandsfontein. Chimneys and battery-houses, and
the weblike entanglement of hauling gear stood silhouetted black
- against the strip of orange sky; here and there, like great
earth-stars, or as though the crust of the earth had been
punctured and all the glory of high-day was struggling through
the pinholes, white arc lights spangled the distant Rand. Some of
the chimneys belched black smoke that trailed across the sky, but
they were few.</p>

<p class="cp">SURPRISES AT JOHANNESBURG</p>

<p>Suddenly, and without, the long-drawn screech with which the
mail train usually heralds its coming, we drew alongside a
platform.</p>

<p>"Johannesburg Park!" Surely this cannot be Johannesburg? This
is not the greatest terminus in South Africa? This is a place of
tall, overshadowing trees, of red country roads, of placid
ruralness, or ordered quiet. It is the pretty station of
Somewhere-on-Sea&mdash;there are clamouring fly-men at the
station gate to heighten the illusion.</p>

<p>It is Johannesburg right enough, and as you drive through its
darkening streets you get a glimpse of its size and a hint of its
probabilities. In the white, strong light of morning the town,
lies bare to your criticism: sordidness and grandeur, lofty
fineness and sickening meanness are its characteristics. Many
turreted emporia rub shoulders with clumsily-built tin stores,
gaping at every angle, unpainted and neglected. The dignity of
the newly-erected pile, splendid in plate-glass and polished
stone and electric light, is balanced by the tumble-down
craziness of the fit-up one-storied eating house it jostles out
of sight. Pritchard Street, Commissioner Street, and Market
Street hold a succession of architectural parvenus, striving
frantically to atone for the down-at-heels condition of poor
relations. It is a city cf shocking contrasts: of princely villas
and squalid slums; of air, which is to London air as a diamond is
to a hunk cf coal; of dust-storms that are a revelation to the
Modder River campaigner.</p>

<p class="cp">THE HANDFUL BACK ON THE RAND</p>

<p>In these times Johannesburg is a deserted city. Not the
deserted city that the "occasional correspondent" led me to
expect&mdash;the dead city, grass growing in the streets and the
footfall of the solitary pedestrian reverberating strangely
through untrodden ways. Not that exactly, but the air of semi-
desolation that is peculiar to the City of London on Sunday
morning. Just a few people to be met with here and there; just a
cab trundling slowly through the uneven streets, and another cab
trundling more slowly in the distance. A few shops open, with a
meagre display of stock; much evidence of limited supply to meet
an uncertain demand.</p>

<p>The population of the Rand is yet a military one. Even the
civilians play at soldiers. Mine managers, miners, compound
managers, and engineers have become Mine Guards, and Rand Rifles,
and Mounted Rifles. "Misters" are majors, "Bills" are privates.
This is the price they pay&mdash;this military service&mdash;for
the privilege of coming into Johannesburg by the Early Door. Not
quite the early door either, but rather the Stage Door; since
they have been admitted to assist the Management, while the
thousands and tens of thousands who desire admittance in the
ordinary way are waiting, by turns good-humouredly and by turns
petulantly, at the thrice-barriered entrance at Cape Town, Port
Elizabeth, East London, and Durban. Who are back on the Rand? A
sprinkling of mine managers, a few businessmen, few clerks
connected with the banks and insurance offices, a few heads of
Departments&mdash; that is all.</p>

<p class="cp">EXCESS OF CAUTION</p>

<p>For my part I think the Government is losing opportunities in
delaying the return of the refugees to Johannesburg, for nothing
is calculated to discourage the Boers so much as the knowledge
that the land is again settling down to work... To them it would
be an outward and visible sign of our confidence in the certainty
of the issue. So long as Johannesburg is untenanted they know
that it is because we do not consider our position is
sufficiently assured in the Transvaal to allow of the return of a
large commercial population.</p>

<p>We may drop one or two stamps, set one or two batteries at
work, but we do it with the air of the small boy who knocks at
the door of a reputed haunted house. We start a mine going, then
look around with a scared face, ready to apologise or acclaim our
own boldness&mdash;according to the results of our intrepidity.
This is the time for resolute action. The resumption; of work on
the Rand will be fifty times more significant to the Boer than
its occupation. Look at the case from Brer Boer's point of view,
and you will see which is the more discouraging, the mere
military occupation of a depopulated town, or the rehabilitation
of its industries.</p>

<p>There can be no question of a prolonged siege of Johannesburg,
no fear of a starving, beleaguered town with a hundred thousand
hungry civilian mouths to be fed with military rations. With the
present proportion cf Britons and Boers in the field, with the
loss of the enemy's heavy guns, a siege would be impossible, and
fed as it is from three seaports by three separate lines of
railways, the possibilities of a failure of food-stuffs are
almost as remote.</p>

<p class="cp">WHEN WILL IT BE TIME?</p>

<p>Supposing' we do not let the bulk of the
Johannesburger&mdash;many of them are subsisting on the charity
of the coast-port colonials&mdash;return to the Rand until the
war is really ended and the country has quietened down, how long
do you think they will have to wait? Will you think I am an
alarmist if I say two years? Perhaps that is an extreme view, but
at any rate I should say it will be well into 1903 before the
country is quite settled. In the meantime you have this enormous
population either diverted from its proper avocation, or, as I
say, living on the mercy of charitable folks.</p>

<p>And do not forget, good friends, that these people are engaged
in the industry which is to contribute towards the costs of the
war&mdash;not the gold industry only, but the hundred and one
subsidiary industries&mdash;and the British taxpayer has the
right to demand that any machinery that can be put in motion to
lighten his burden, should so be.</p>

<p>Let the mines re-open, let the Johannesburgers return, and
every stamp that falls will do something more than discourage the
Boers: it will help to knock off that extra tuppence!</p>

<h2><a id="art21" name="art21">IN DEATH'S EYE</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Poverty Bay Herald</i> (New Zealand),
August 6, 1901</h3>

<p class="cp">VILJOEN'S DRIFT, May 25, 1901</p>

<p class="cp">A NIGHTS ADVENTURES</p>

<p>Of Atkins "doing nothing" I have told you: the patient, rain-
sodden, wind-chilled, cheerful Atkins, tramping desperately in
the grey rain, sleeping peacefully through the black downpour.
And I have sketched Atkins tired: the, listless, bored soldier
marching impatiently to an unknown destination, or counting flies
on a jam-pot by his lonely railside post.</p>

<p>There is no end of variety in Tommy.</p>

<p>Come with me, you people who have a hint of a suspicion that
Atkins is subject to funks. Have you ever faced Death? Not on a
sickbed, when your mind is clouded and dazed, and you have lost
the Grip of Things; not in the stupor of your crisis, when all
power of realisation of your danger had slipped from
you&mdash;but Death that comes to you in the broad light of day;
Death that comes at lunch-time, and it is a toss-up whether it
will be afternoon tea for yon or a funeral. Face Death that way,
stand on the very brink and look down&mdash;down&mdash;down; sway
and reel on the brink of Eternity and recover your footing on the
edge of Life with a gasp&mdash;that is what I mean by facing
Death. Do this not once in your life, but daily, and yon will
taste the real flavor of it.</p>

<p class="cp">ON THE GANGER'S TROLLEY</p>

<p>It is early morning, and bitterly cold. Only the
stars&mdash;frozen spangles of light&mdash;in the heavens; only a
white rime of frost on the ground, and between frost and stars an
empty silence, save that, from the engine of the mail train that
has been held up all night at the little veldt siding comes the
hiss and roar peculiar to its kind. A feather of steam shakes
impatiently at its safety valve, for the wakeful engine and the
sleepy passenger coaches behind are ready as soon as light shall
come to resume the interrupted journey to Pretoria.</p>

<p>But much may have happened in the night. Brother Boer may have
crept down in the darkness and shifted a rail, or worse, left a
packet of some unpleasant mess artfully hidden between rail and
ballast with the object of reducing the rolling stock of the
Imperial Military Railways. So we are going down the line on the
ganger's trolley to nose out these modest destroyers that hide
coyly behind sleepers and retire unobtrusively to the shelter of
fishplates.</p>

<p>Before Heaven and a critical public, I declare I am no hero,
although the men who were with me were. They knew the risk they
ran&mdash;I did not. Perhaps if I had known the risks I was about
to take I should not have gone; certain it is I will never go
again.</p>

<p>Three full privates, one corporal of Engineers, one war
correspondent of the <i>Daily Mail</i>&mdash; that was the
trolley's passenger list; and, as the night thought of her sins
and paled eastward, two of the Tommies gave the machine a shove,
and we were off on our ten miles' voyage of discovery. The "road"
was downhill and easy going for a mile, and the enemy's country
did not begin until we reached the foot of the slope. There we
passed the advanced post of the siding guard&mdash; a solitary
Tommy hidden somewhere in the semi-darkness, who challenged and
was silent.</p>

<p class="cp">WITH FACES TO THE GROUND</p>

<p>Then he march commenced. On the outer edges of the trolley the
corporal and a man stretched themselves full-length along a
wooden platform, their beads just over-reaching the fore end of
the trolley, their faces about 20 inches above the rail. The
other two men trundled the car along, now running alongside
pushing heavily, now sitting on the back of the platform
propelling the little track forward with an occasional kick at
the ground. I was seated amidships, facing forward, and the cold
air came to my mouth and nose for all the world like a dry ice
spray&mdash;if such a thing could be. There was now just enough
light for the two watchers to see pretty clearly twenty yards
ahead, and the uncanniness of the experience was passing. Atkins
who pushed on the right had a fine taste for gruesome anecdote,
more particularly in the matter of exploded mines, and his
conversation was not cheerful. His repertory included the stories
of the Injudicious Corporal, the Inquisitive Loyalist, the
Unfortunate Goat, and the Circumspect Boer.</p>

<p>The story of the Inquisitive Loyalist was about a Boer who
lived on a farm. And when the English came along this 'ere Boer
discovered that he had never been in favor of the war from the
very first, so was allowed to live on his farm provided he gave
up his arms. So this 'ere somethinged Boer handed in the Tower
musket with which he had been plugging Tommies at 2,000 yards and
upwards, and flint- lock, which was, so to speak, his second
barrel, and was allowed to live peacefully in sight of the
camp.</p>

<p>And as every day passed, his love for the British increased,
so that the amiable camp commandant allowed him to visit the camp
and sell the brutal soldiery milk and vegetables. But the amiable
commandant was not the fool his eyeglass and his drawl led you to
believe, and he had a notion that the new convert to Imperialism
was in the habit&mdash;and a disgusting habit it is&mdash;of
communicating with outside pals. And once a culvert was
mysteriously blown up, and nobody saw the Boers who did it. So
the commandant took that "&mdash; &mdash;" (I won't attempt to
tone down the adjectives) Boer into his confidence. The culvert
south of the siding had been blown up, he said, but had been
repaired; he was now having it carefully guarded. He did not
intend having the other culvert, which was north of the siding,
watched, as he did not think the Boers would experiment on that,
and, besides, he couldn't spare the men. And the Boer was touched
by the confidence the guileless Philistine reposed in him, and
wept.</p>

<p>That night the commandant sent for the farmer and held him in
conversation for two hours on agricultural prospects, what time
two engineers laid down a devilish contrivance near the northern
culvert.</p>

<p>And this is the way it was made. They dug a hole and placed
therein a camp kettle. Within that camp kettle was fifteen pounds
of dynamite. Inserted in that camp kettle was the muzzle of a
loaded Martini carbine, and attached to the trigger of that
carbine were wires that the foot of the most careful walker would
not fail to catch. Well, that night&mdash;</p>

<p>"STOP!"</p>

<p>The story stops suddenly, two pairs of hands grip the right-
hand brake, and the trolley jars to a standstill.</p>

<p class="cp">SOMETHING NEW</p>

<p>We are off in a second, and the corporal is gingerly scraping
away the earth piled round a thing that looks like a bottle with
the neck protruding. It is placed by the side of the rail, the
bottle raised to the rail's level, and had the truck gone another
dozen feet it would have smashed the neck.</p>

<p>"This," said the corporal, speaking with great niceness, and
picking his words as though some discordant phrase would be
sufficient to agitate the contents, "is a new fake. I'm not goin'
to take this along with me. Here, What's-your-name, take this
bottle out about three hundred yards, and stick it on a rock,
where we can see it."</p>

<p>What's-his-name tucked the bottle under his arm with as much
unconcern as if it were a bottle of beer, and strolled to the
required distance. I fancy it was half that distance, for the
bottle was quite distinct in the broadening light. When What's-
his-name had got back the four men took up their rifles from the
trolley floor, and, taking steady aim, opened fire. The third
shot took effect. The little black object, just visible, became
instantly a broad white fan of angry flaming light. Only for a
second, and then smoke was where flame had been, and the earth
shook with the roar of the explosion.</p>

<p>"One," said the corporal laconically, and the journey was
resumed. Back to the charge came the anecdotal Tommy.</p>

<p>Well, this blank blank Boer was found in a dozen different
places the next morning, he having profited by the commandant's
confidence to walk round the unguarded culvert in the early
morning with a dynamite cartridge and a wicked smile. Tommy
lapsed into fiction at this point to sketch the Boer's glee as he
walked to his work of destruction.</p>

<p class="cp">LITTLE STICKS OF DYNAMITE</p>

<p>Now we are at the top of the "bank," and there is a clear run
down to the next siding. Day is here now, and as we rattle down
the steep grade we disturb the thousand tiny creatures of the sun
that are waking to activity.</p>

<p>"Steady with that. Put the. brake on, you silly fool!"</p>

<p>This from the corporal, for we are moving at a great rate, and
the watchers stretched at full length put their hands up to turn
the wind from their eyes.</p>

<p>The brake falls on the wheel, but we have gained too great a
momentum, and the pace is not perceptibly slackened. The corporal
looks eagerly forward; the growing light has increased his range
of vision, but the speed of the trolley has lessened its
usefulness. Suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brake! Brake For God's sake!"</p>

<p>He has seen something on the line&mdash;something snuggling
close to the rail&mdash;an ominous, shapeless something that has
no right to be there. In a moment you see there is not time to
jump for it; you can hardly rise to your feet in the time. Then a
swift hand snatches up a rifle, the rifle is poised for a moment
before the whirring wheels of the trolley, then dropped crosswise
on to the metals. There is a jump, a bone-racking thud, thud,
thud as the wheels kick up against the sleepers; the next minute
there is an overturned trolley with wheels still running, and
five human beings sprawling unhurt upon the veldt; but the five
little sticks of dynamite with the upturned percussion cap are
untouched.</p>

<p>Only a broken rifle a few feet from them shows where the
trolley left the line.</p>

<h2><a id="art22" name="art22">
AMERICA'S BID FOR THE RAND</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), August 12,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG, May 28, 1901</p>

<p>Trade follows the flag.</p>

<p>This phrase&mdash;accepted as an axiom by some, and as a
mischievous solecism by a dour few&mdash;has hitherto suggested
to us one type of campaign And the peculiarity of that type of
campaign is that it has been a sort of three-months-to-the-day
affair, and its incidents have had a peculiar sameness. First an
interior, miles, away from the coast. Then an irreligious
potentate who warmly declined to be converted, or to exchange the
simple devil he knew for the subtle devil he did not know,
preferring wooden-faced Mumbo-Jumbo to the unclean serpent. Then
follow in rapid succession the inevitable consequences&mdash;a
murdered missionary, an Exchange cable, and a hastily organised
punitive expedition. Long marches and much fever, and a funeral
of two by the wayside. A little bush-fighting, an early morning
rush at a bristling stockade, a scramble over, a practical
demonstration of the utility of the short lunge, a little
burying, a little hanging, up with the bunting and "God Save the
King!"&mdash; with, a Bombay Lancer hauling at the lanyards, and
a Sudanese policeman holding the Marine C.O.'s horse. That is the
advent of the flag.</p>

<p class="cp">WHEN THE FLAG FOLLOWS TRADE</p>

<p>After come a Parsee, a Jew and a Scotch storekeeper, and trade
sits on the conqueror's grave and rooks the guileless conquered,
for bad whisky and a new code of ethics are trade's outward and
visible signs.</p>

<p>Sometimes trade gets ahead the flag; the Union Jack goes to
the front in a box of Birmingham gewgaws, but in that case it
does not go alone, and the allied forces are well represented,
and the supremacy of any one nationality is in ratio to the
gaudiness of its export. When the official flag comes along,
which it will do with the usual escort of "red" marines and the
portable Hotchkiss, there will arise certain complications, for
in the Hinterland the rights of kingship are less divine than
those of the Belgian trader.</p>

<p>This is by the way; and is suggested by a walk I have taken,
round Johannesburg's stores. I have been trying to discover to
what extent English trade will benefit by our new acquisition,
and, if the truth be told, the prospect is by no means an
encouraging one. That the mines will be ours&mdash;or rather that
the country in which the goldfields are situated will be under
British rule&mdash;may be taken for granted. That these large
corporations will for many years contribute a fair share towards
defraying the cost of the war is also within reason, but beyond
the direct income from this source it is difficult to see in what
manner England is to benefit commercially, if the existing
business modes obtain in the future, and if the schemes that are
now on foot in America and elsewhere go through.</p>

<p class="cp">UNCLE SAM TAKES HIS COAT OFF</p>

<p>For, be it known, commercial America is making a big bid for
the Rand, and commercial America is being aided and abetted in
its plans by a pathetic, worn-out, vitiated commercial England.
Nor is this trade-grabbing the most serious aspect of America's
attempt to secure by hustle and dollar that which we have earned
with bullet and fever.</p>

<p>"America," said a well-known Johannesburg stockbroker to me
the other evening, "is going to have a considerable say in the
development of the Rand. As it is, very few people are aware of
the enormous interests the States have in Johannesburg. Yes, I
know it has been denied, and that very few of the leading Wall
Street speculators have large holdings of Kaffir scrip, but there
are many very wealthy houses in America that never, or, at any
rate, seldom ever gamble, who are steadily buying up shares
whenever the opportunity offers. Of course, it isn't their game
to come in with a rush and send up the prices, but the buying
goes on nonetheless."</p>

<p>As it is, most of the machinery used on the Rand hails from
the other side, and the reason for this is not far to seek.</p>

<p>If you consult a list of the mines on the Rand, and, for that
matter, throughout South Africa, you will find that in almost
every instance the chief engineer is an American, and as
Americans of all classes, be they chief engineers or trolley-men,
have an unshakeable belief in the supremacy of home manufacturers
over all foreign trash, it would be unreasonable to expect them
to favour any other than those from the land of Old Glory.</p>

<p>This favouritism has already been so marked as to attract
attention, and with the added, incentive of sympathetic
directors, and the concordant votes of shareholders, the American
engineer will have it pretty well all his own way, to the
detriment of the unfortunate English manufacturer.</p>

<p class="cp">PROSPECTS OF A MINING TRUST</p>

<p>"Another thing," said my stockbroking friend, "that is
alarming is the prospect of consolidation. I had a 1etter from a
man in New York only last week, telling me that there is a
movement on foot to capture all the poorer mines and the deeps
and pool them&mdash;yes, a trust (a trust is the Yankee's idea of
commercial perfection). It wouldn't be a very big thing in the
way of trusts, but it would open up tremendous possibilities. The
amalgamation of the diamond mines of Kimberley had as much an
appearance of impossibility as a big gold combine here."</p>

<p>Desirous of discovering whether America's pushfulness was
being directed solely towards the mining industry I strolled
round the town, visiting several of the big business houses. The
first firm was that of the Peter Robinson class, and the manager
was emphatic.</p>

<p>"Where do we get our goods from? America, France, Germany and
England, but France and Germany run her very close. America isn't
able to compete with English manufacturers in that line, but in a
year or two I've no doubt she will. As to hardware, that mostly
all comes from America. Why? Well, it is cheaper in the first
place&mdash; both the initial cost and the shipment. Then, again,
the stuff is good, the orders are promptly complied with and
accurately carried out."</p>

<p class="cp">HIDEBOUND JOHN BULL</p>

<p>Another manager fold the same story:</p>

<p>"American shippers are prompt, courteous and obliging. They
are ending up boots now that compare very favourably with the
best Leicester or Vienna ever exported."</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>"English houses are so unobliging, they make certain things in
a certain way, whether the requirements of the customer are
suited or not. A traveller representing a well-known English firm
called with some samples. There was a dressing-bag that took my
fancy, but in place of the brass fittings I wanted. nickel. Do
you think he would take my order? Not a bit. He was very sorry,
but that was the class of goods his firm supplied. I could take
it or leave it. After he had left along came an American drummer
representing a firm that supplied many things, but certainly not
dressing-bags. I told him of my difficulty with the Englishman;
and do you know that that Yank took my order for dressing-bags
with nickel fittings, although his firm bad never made such a
thing before; and, what is more, I got 'em."</p>

<p>The hardware merchants of the Rand were unanimous. America was
the only possible market for tools and furniture. "I indented,"
said one, "for thirty ploughs from England and a like number from
America. I verily believe that the American ploughs were worn out
before the English articles arrived." Also, we were unanimous
upon one point: the English article was the best.</p>

<p>What is to blame for our commercial failure in South Africa?
Old, conservative, dogmatic methods, and an inability to
appreciate the present day necessities of the buyer. Not the
buyer, at any rate, for he is justified in going to the cheapest
and most expeditious, marketer. It is too much to expect that the
Rand merchant will wait six months for a plough when he can get a

SOPS TO SENTIMENT&mdash;SETTLEMENT PROBLEMS</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), August 15,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">PRETORIA, May 31, 1901</p>

<p>"...Mr Van Nieuenhoys, the Netherlands Consul, left here last
Saturday, for the purpose of interviewing General Botha, that
general having expresssd a desire to cable to President Kruger
with reference to a general surrender. Last night there was a
persistent rumour in town that Botha had asked for a three days'
armistice, which had been granted. The feeling here is distinctly
optimistic."</p>

<p>But the censor shook his head when I showed him the
message.</p>

<p>"Nothing about peace proposals can go through," he said, and
so I have wired you the last sentence of my message in the hope
that you may read into the somewhat bald and reiterated statement
of Pretoria's cheerfulness the fact that, for the hundredth time
since the war started, the End and Peace are in sight. This
possibly suggests once more the terms of settlement, about which
so much has been written&mdash;we had cut and dried proposals
ready for the battle of Glencoe!&mdash;that one feels the
impossibility of presenting the issues in any fresh light.</p>

<p class="cp">ACCEPTABLE TO LOYAL SOUTH AFRICA?</p>

<p>First and foremost, the opinions of loyal South Africa must be
respected, for the loyal South African is the man who is to live
here, making his home among the people who are now in the field
fighting against us. No policy and no terms, however pleasing to
the millions who are living six thousand miles from the land
which will see and feel the policy in operation, and will be
influenced in its future every-day life by the direction of the
settlement, can be possible unless they gain the approval of the
people who will be mostly affected. And, the person who will be
mostly affected&mdash;next to the Boer himself&mdash;will be the
loyal South African, who in thousands of instances has fought for
his political liberty with the best of the soldiers, and who in
all cases must make his home and raise his family side by side
with the people whose exact national status for all time must be
definitely settled before the war is really over.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most difficult thing to discover is, What are
loyal South Africa's demands? For there ore two classes of
loyalists in the country, and each is distinct from the other.
There is the practical and the sentimental; one who, with an eye
to the future, calls for a <i>modus vivendi</i>, and the other
who cries <i>Revanche!</i> and demands retaliatory measures,
having in his mind the injustice of the Krugerian regime, and
being for the time oblivious of the copy-book maxim which points
out the futility of attempting to obtain any shade of whiteness
by a combination of two or more uncompromising blacks.</p>

<p class="cp">WITH JEALOUS EYE</p>

<p>These people, who, smarting under their past wrongs, will
naturally take the most extreme views, will be, beyond doubt, be
the more difficult to please when, the actual settlement comes.
Profiting by past experience of Great Britain's pusillanimity in
colonial administration; remembering&mdash;and they cannot well
forget&mdash;how often they have been left to work out their own
salvation by Governments who regarded the colonies as inferior
Irelands, they will read into every piece of statesmanship which
concedes in the slightest degree to the Boer prejudice an
unexplainable attempt on the part of his Majesty's Government to
conciliate the Dutch at the expense of the British.</p>

<p>The practical section, however, dominates, and will be able to
discriminate between weakness and far-seeing
concession&mdash;always providing you do not call it
"magnanimity," which is a word that stinks in the nostrils of
every South African.</p>

<p>"I decline to discuss the question of independence," said Lord
Kitchener, and the fact that independence cannot be discussed in
the terms of settlement is very patent to the most ignorant
<i>bywoner</i>. They do not expect independence: Botha even told
one of the captured commandants that the hope of the two States
recovering their old position was outside the range of
possibility&mdash;and this in spite of his periodical appeals to
the burghers to fight to the death in defence of their beloved
independence. They know, Botha and Boer, that England cannot
withdraw from the position she has taken up in South Africa, and
still remain a nation, so that their parrot-like cry for
independence is becoming almost as meaningless as the heroics of
the schoolboy orator who ends his peroration with that
magnificent Americanism, "As for me, give me liberty or give me
death!"</p>

<p>Recognising the futility of resistance, why then prolong what
is beyond doubt for them a painful campaign?</p>

<p>The life of the Boer on commando is more than hard. Ill-fed,
ill-clad, with scarcely any transport and very little
clothing&mdash;so little indeed that some of the commandoes are
forced to save the skins of the sheep they kill to protect them
from the ravages of winter&mdash;bootless most of them, living a
life compared with which the lot of the humble herd-boy is
luxurious, surely there is something more vital than this
equivocal independence&mdash;this hopeless intangibility?</p>

<p class="cp">REAL QUESTIONS OF SENTIMENT</p>

<p>As it is with the loyalists, so it is with the Boers. There is
a large and predominating section of sentimentalists. The
questions whether their language shall be stamped out and whether
they shall be placed on the same electoral footing as the raw
Kaffir are very high politics to a majority of the men in the
field.</p>

<p>Only the other day one of the commandants addressed the men of
his commando: "If we surrender to the British, what will become
of <i>onze taal</i>?* It will be swept from the land, and you
will be obliged to talk to your mother in English; if we
surrender we shall have to say to our Kaffirs: '<i>Als u belieft,
Jan</i>!' (Please, John) and '<i>Danke, Jan</i>' (Thanks, John),
and we shall ask our boys if we may vote!"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>onze taal</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;our
language. ]</p>

<p>This native equality rankles in the Boer mind. For years the
native has been his good servant, and he had sufficient knowledge
of the working of the aboriginal mind to know how bad a master
the native will become if he is allowed to take any prominent
place the politics of the country. The native question is one
which will require the careful consideration of those entrusted
with the construction of the final settlement, for not only the
immediate pacification of the country will be involved in the
rigid niceness of the adjustment of the clauses dealing
therewith, but the future tranquillity of the whole of South
Africa, from the Mediterranean southwards, may be bound up in the
future status of the Transvaal native, for the tranquillity of
the native will depend on the attitude of the Dutch, and the
attitude of the Dutch will depend on the position of the native
politically.</p>

<p class="cp">TAAL MUST COME TO AN END</p>

<p>Whatever opinions one may have on the question of the
languages, one point seems to be of paramount importance, and
most people I have spoken with are agreed, whether they have been
British or Dutch, that English must be the official language in
the Transvaal, although there seems to be no very convincing
reason why Dutch should not be spoken in the Legislative
Assemblies of the two conquered provinces. It seems to me that we
recognised the right of two communities of almost equal size, but
differing in nationality, each to use its native tongue, when we
suggested, shortly before the war, that English should he allowed
to be used in debates in the <i>Raadzaal</i>,* and that the
Transvaal Government refused to sanction this is no reason why we
should deny to the Boer what we deemed due to the Briton.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Raadzaal</i>(Afrikaans)&mdash;The
Transvaal Parliament building.</p>

<p>The <i>taal</i> will die a natural death. Possessing no
traditions and no literature, its grammar conforming strictly to
the taste of the user, it needs just leaving alone. To attempt to
suppress it would be to endow it with new life. Let it be used as
in the Cape Colony, only don't encourage it as they do there, for
the <i>taal</i> is a compulsory subject for all matriculation,
examinations, and the spectacle of English students being set the
task of translating High Dutch into the <i>taal</i> is not
edifying. The <i>taal</i> is hideous and slovenly. It is so
coarse and vulgar that the British and Foreign Bible Society have
not printed a single Bible in the "language." It is a sort of
Billingsgate Dutch, with all the Billingsgate left in&mdash;and
the Boer wants to retain it, to read his <i>Volkstem</i>* in it,
to hear his sermons in it. Let him. His grandson will be an
educated man, and will speak English out of very decency. Don't
be afraid that Holland Dutch will become the language of the
land&mdash;the Boer prefers English.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>De Volkstem</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;"The
Voice Of The People", a Transvaal newspaper. ]</p>

<p>These are two points which will loom largely in the
settlement. A concession in either case would be as beneficial to
the English as to the enemy&mdash;don't forget that we are not as
yet in a position to dictate terms&mdash;and are such that we can
afford to give. They are sops thrown to sentiment: we can be
cheaply gracious.</p>

THE VLAKFONTEIN HORROR<br>
ENEMY MURDER OUR WOUNDED</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Poverty Bay Herald</i> (New Zealand),
August 22, 1901</h3>

<p class="note">A British army censor deleted the account of this
Boer atrocity from a report which Edgar Wallace cabled to the
<i>Daily Mail</i> in June 1901. The uncensored version of the
report eventually reached the newspaper by post. <i>The Poverty
Bay Herald</i> printed Wallace's account with the following
introductory material:</p>

<p class="note" style="text-align: center">OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION
OF THE STORY</p>

<p class="note">The allegations against the Boers of murdering
the British wounded at Vlakfontein in the fight of May 29 formed
the subject of a special statement in the House of Commons by Mr
Brodrick, the War Minister, on July 11.</p>

<p>In view of the War Office's denial of the statement in the
telegrams from South Africa that a British officer and a non-
commissioned officer were shot in cold blood because they refused
to show the Boers how to work the guns which they had temporarily
captured, and having regard also to the numerous letters which
the newspapers had published from time to time from soldiers who
actually took part in the fight, great public interest has been
manifested in the subject.</p>

<p class="note">There has, indeed, been, great anxiety to arrive
at the truth of this matter. And from, the statement which Mr
Brodrick made, there appears to be no manner of doubt that the
Boers were guilty of the atrocities ascribed to them in soldiers'
letters from the front. For it now turns out, after inquiry, that
Lord Kitchener telegraphed his denial on insufficient
information&mdash;that, so far, seven men have come forward and
testified that the Boers murdered British wounded. The Commander-
in-Chief has forwarded the statements of these eye-witnesses on
by mail, and further evidence on oath is to be taken. Here is the
text of Edgar Wallace's report:</p>

<p class="cp">ENEMY MURDER OUR WOUNDED</p>

<p>In the country round Wolmaranstadt and Hartebeestefontein, and
between Klerkdorp and the Bechuanaland border, the whole district
swarms with Boers, and it is here that Methuen goes when he feels
inclined to have a fight, which is, so swear the Bushmen, who
worship him&mdash;(did you know that?)&mdash;about seven days a
week.</p>

<p>General Dixon's column is one of the many that zig-zag about
the country establishing posts, building and garrisoning
blockhouses, burning and punishing, protecting and relieving as
occasion demands or justice dictates.</p>

<p>The country is of that deceptive kind where long grassy
undulations hide <i>dongas</i>* and waterways. On the day of the
fight, Dixon's force had been out farm-burning in the morning,
and was returning to camp at about 1.30 in the afternoon. To
guard as far as possible from surprise, the force was split up
into two wings, moving simultaneously in the same direction, but
a considerable distance apart. When the columns reached a point
which was presumably as far from the camp as each wing was from
the other, the two parties converged on to the point represented
by the camp, so that the lines of direction may be roughly
followed by placing a V sideways, the force moving down the upper
road consisting of two squadrons Imperial Yeomanry, two guns, 200
Derbys, and a few Scottish Horse. The pom-pom had also been with
this party, but was withdrawn before the fight, and was with the
main body, which was moving up the lower road.</p>

<p class="Footnote">[* <i>Donga</i> (Afrikaans from Zulu)&mdash;a
ditch formed by the erosion of soil. The word means "bank, side
of a gully" in Zulu. <i>Wikipedia</i>. ]</p>

<p>As the column advanced leisurely along the top road, the
scouts skirting the grass fire, some shadowy forms were seen to
be moving about. Through the smoke they were indistinguishable,
but they were challenged, and replied satisfactorily enough, "All
right; we are Scottish Horse," and as they seemed to be dressed
in khaki, and wore the regulation cocks' feathers in their hats,
very little notice was taken until a heavy gust of wind rent for
a moment the veil of smoke&mdash;and there was the Boer army!
With a yell the whole Boer force dashed forward, galloping
through the low, hanging smoke, the hoofs of a thousand horses
tramping down the fire. Firing from their saddles, the Boers came
on with a rush, and as the little English force fell back in
confusion the gunner officer, seeing that the fate of his guns
was settled, pistolled the horses.</p>

<p class="cp">KILLING THE WOUNDED</p>

<p>The confusion was only for a moment, for, rallied by fine
officers, the raw Yeomen, who two months ago had never fired a
rifle, took cover and held the Boers in play, while the good old
Derbys, grown wise in warfare, prepared to make an attempt to re-
take the guns. In the meantime the jubilant Boers had reached the
spot where the guns stood, the dying horses lying in the traces
and the victims of the first volley lying around, and demanded of
an officer who had not time to get away an immediate lesson in
gunnery. He refused to turn the guns on to his own
comrades&mdash;that goes without saying&mdash;and was shot for
his refusal. A sergeant-major of the battery met with the same
fate.</p>

<p>What happened then may be described in the words of my
informant.</p>

<p>"A couple of Boers armed with Martinis walked round the forms
of the dead and dying men who were stretched in every conceivable
attitude on the ground. Some they turned over to see if they were
dead. If they weren't, one or the other of the two Boers shot
them, just slipping a cartridge into the breach of the Martini
and shooting them as you'd shoot an ox. I saw four men killed in
this way. The Boers went up to Lieutenant &mdash;&mdash; of the
&mdash;&mdash; and turned him over. Then, thinking that he was
dead, they took off his spurs. One officer was lying wounded, and
a sergeant who was slightly wounded went across to him with some
water; a third Boer shot them both dead deliberately. One
youngster&mdash;I think he was a Yeoman&mdash;pleaded for his
life. I heard him say, '0 Christ&mdash;don't!' and then the bang
of the rifle." That is what happened.</p>

<p>Then came the other wing with their howitzer, and the Boers
managed to work the newly-captured guns, and got in half a dozen
shots.</p>

<p>By this time the Derbys were ready. Bayonets rattled on to
barrels, and with that jog-jog step that knows but one pace and
stops only at one objective, they came on with a rush. They say
that raw Yeomen and seasoned Tommies mingled together in the
final rush, but whoever else was there, the Derby Tommy was in
it, and the Boers, who for the moment had been the victors,
inflicting on us something which looked suspiciously like a
disaster, turned and fled, leaving their bayoneted dead to be
buried.</p>

<p class="cp">WHY MESSAGES ARE MUTILATED AND FALSIFIED</p>

<p class="cp">PRETORIA, Wednesday, June 12, 1901</p>

<p>In speaking last week of the Vlakfontein fight, I did so
believing that the description I had sent by cable had gone
through without mutilation.</p>

<p>The restrictions imposed on Press correspondents at the
beginning of the war were, under Lord Roberts's regime,
considerably relaxed, and I suppose I had fallen into a sense of
false security when I despatched to you on form A.K. of the
<i>Telegraafdienst, Z.A. Republiek</i>*, the story of the Boer
atrocities at Vlakfontein.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Telegraafdienst, Z.A. Republiek</i>
(Afrikaans)&mdash;Telegraph Service of the South African
Republic. ]</p>

<p>At any rate, I must confess to having received a rude shock on
Saturday, when, on paying a flying visit to Pretoria, I
discovered that that portion referring to the shooting of the
wounded Yeomen by Kemp's burghers had been struck out of my
message.</p>

<p>I do not rail against the censors, since most of those men who
have been appointed to the more important centres are educated,
courteous gentlemen, who do not mutilate news out of very
wantonness, but rather act either in conformity with an
inscrutable law, evidently based on the spasmodic whimsies of
some exalted military genius, whose claim to distinction is
apparently a total ignorance of public feeling and a lack of
acquaintance with the first principles of Logical Deduction, or
else are the dictation of Downing Street wire-pullers, who have a
political object in suppressing facts.</p>

<p>There are, of course&mdash;or rather have been&mdash;censors
who were neither educated, courteous nor gentlemanly; censors of
a day, so to speak, who have played the fool with the English
public as their caprices or their malice dictated.</p>

<p class="cp">TWO EXPERIENCES</p>

<p>Armed with a little brief authority, and accepting Lord
Wolseley's hasty definition! of the war correspondent&mdash;("The
curse of modern armies")&mdash;as an axiom; and Lord Kitchener's
alleged aversion to the Press as a sound backing, they have
bullied and threatened, and hacked and slashed, just as their
spite or stupidity inspired them.</p>

<p>There is a Colonel of an Irish Line Regiment, an immaculate,
eye-glassed individual, who spent one half of his time in writing
to Lord Kitchener to tell him the precautions he had taken to
ensure the safety of the camp, and the other half bullying
inoffensive railway passengers. This officer threatened to put me
in the guard-room for submitting a wire which was absolutely
true, but which he, as Intelligence officer, should have known
before me.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, when I was with Henniker on the trail
of the wily De Wet, there was a censor attached to General
Lyttelton's staff who carefully eliminated from a wire which
described the taking of De Wet's guns every reference to the
Yeomen, the Australians, and the irregular corps, and inserted in
their stead a statement which, not to put too fine a point on it,
was an absolute falsehood. What his object was in doing this,
Heaven only knows. But to me, taking an ordinary matter-of-fact
view of the case, it seemed very much like an exhibition of
jealousy, and an attempt to boycott corps which, in the piping
times of peace, do not figure in the Army List.</p>

<p class="cp">HOW THEY GET THERE</p>

<p>In dealing with censors and their methods in this letter I do
not wish to take into account those freaks of a day, those
irresponsible mutilators with whom impaired digestion takes the
place of literary ability, for they very often are men placed in
their positions on the fool-of-the-family principle.</p>

<p>"What shall we do with Captain Friendatcourt?" asks the staff
officer of his brigadier.</p>

<p>"Friendatcourt?" queries the General, "Who the devil's
he?"</p>

<p>"The man who came from Park Lane with a Letter of
Introduction," is the response.</p>

<p>"Oh!" says the chief, "make him Provost-Marshal."</p>

<p>"Not enough backbone, sir," answers the staff officer.</p>

<p>"Put him in charge of the transport," is the order.</p>

<p>The staff officer sniggers. "And be starved?" he inquires.</p>

<p>"Well," ponders the brigadier, "he can't signal, he can't"
write, he doesn't know even enough to be Intelligence
Officer&mdash;make him Press Censor!" And so he gets his
billet.</p>

<p>Now I do not intend dealing with this class of censor, since
his ways are governed by no earthly laws, but rather with the men
who fill these posts at places like Cape Town, Johannesburg,
Pretoria, Bloemfontein, and Kimberley. They are the people who
must be discussed, for from their ruling there is little or no
appeal, since they represent Lord Kitchener, and hold the sealed
patterns of his policy.</p>

<p class="cp">KITCHENER AS A STATESMAN</p>

<p>I am now dealing with Kitchener the Administrator, and the
policy of Kitchener the Administrator is the reflected policy of
his Majesty's Government. Read between the lines of a censored
message and you see Downing Street. A blue line drawn across a
dozen words&mdash;and a question in the House avoided. A sentence
erased&mdash;and a responsibility shirked. It seems to me that
the censorship which was originally constituted for purely
military purposes is being used for political ends, and that some
restrictions are placed on messages for this and for no other
reason. These, I might say, are not laid down in any written or
printed regulation to which the war correspondent has access, and
one only discover them by the mark of the censor's pencil. The
cabled message suffers, and the reason for the restrictions
imposed can only be adduced to one cause.</p>

<p>The English Government is weakening on the issues in South
Africa. You have but to see the items of news in the censor's
<i>index expurgatorius</i> to realise it. Members of the Cabinet
may make after-dinner speeches. They may put their hands to the
plough and never turn back three tames a week. They may address
their constituents wad reconstruct the Army with equal self-
assurance&mdash;but the policy which we understood to be purged
of abortive conciliation, which we understood would carry through
this war until we were in a position to dictate terms to the
enemy, has been replaced by a fearful desire to bring the war to
a finish without giving offence to the Boer and his friends.</p>

<p class="cp">WHY? WHY? WHY?</p>

<p>Why must not the correspondent say by telegraph that we have
burnt a farm from which a patrol was sniped? Why must he not tell
you that British columns are making the Eastern Transvaal
uninhabitable? Are you so falsely sensitive that you give your
sanction to a war of which you cannot countenance the terrible
incidents; or is it that the strongest Government of Other Times
lives in the fear of an Irish opposition?</p>

<p>Why must you not be told that our wounded soldiers were
brutally murdered? Is it because you would rather think of them
as having fallen in action&mdash;a wish to spare your feelings?
Or is it that your knowledge of the Boer character would block
the way of pet conciliation schemes that are ready to plaster up
the ragged ends of am unfinished war?</p>

<p>Why are the comings and goings of conciliating consuls, the
private meetings of Boer commandants and mutual friends kept
secret?</p>

<p>Because the Government knows you are sick to death of these
wordy engagements that end nowhere, that you want to fight to a
finish. You have opined that the soldiers on the field are stale;
you are mistaken; it is the Government that has grown stale, that
fearful, timorous, speech-making Government, so dear to the
applauding, unsuspecting electorate; so cheap, to the wily Boer,
who is waiting for his peace at almost any price.</p>

<p>No right-thinking man will blame Lord Kitchener for carrying
out the instructions of the Government, for Lord Kitchener the
High Commissioner has not got the free hand that Lord Kitchener
the Commander-in-Chief had.</p>

<p class="cp">WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH</p>

<p>The man who was strong enough to desecrate the tomb of the
Mahdi and strike a deadly blow at superstition and heathendom, to
the horror and puny wrath of tea-meetingdom, is strong enough to
shoot off traitors and devastate a country without fear of
criticism or out-of-office hysteria. Strong enough is "K.," but
weak, terribly weak is the knee-shaky Cabinet whose very
philosophy&mdash;so much in evidence at the outbreak of the
war&mdash;is deserting them. There is nothing to be gained by
keeping dark such things as I have enumerated. There is
everything to gain by a policy of frankness.</p>

<p>Are we afraid to say that we are making war in a warlike way?
Is it worthy of our national traditions that we should burn and
destroy the enemy's property which has been used against our
arms, and ravage the land that supports him, and be afraid to
tell the world that we are doing it? The war was a just war: an
inevitable war. We were not ashamed to wage it: why fear to let
even a flabby Opposition know the method of waging?</p>

<p>And about the shooting of the wounded and the many stories of
Boer atrocities which may not he sent by cable. Why this
solicitude? Instances have occurred times without number, but
times without number the greatest objection has been made to the
recording of these. Conciliating and whitewashing seem to be so
much the order of the day now that one hesitates at speaking
adversely of Brother Boer, lest an indignant Crown should
institute an action for criminal libel!</p>

A LETTER FROM BROTHER BOER</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Poverty Bay Herald</i> (New Zealand),
August 23, 1901</h3>

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>.&mdash;Lest this letter fall into the
hands of a civilian censor with no sense of humour, I do hereby
solemnly say that the following is a purely fictitious epistle,
addressed to an imaginary commandant by a non-existent Boer, and
is written with the object of calling the attention of the B.P.
to the humanity of British methods of making war.&mdash;E.W.<br>
The Laager, Vlaakhoer, Z.A.R., June 14, 1901.</p>

<p class="letter">My dear Commandant Marais,-</p>

<p class="letter">This comes hoping to find you quite well, as by
the Divine blessing I and my brave comrades are, but living
always in fear of the cursed and barbarous English, who have
Deluged the land in Blood, and have, as one of their greatest and
most statesmanlike writers said, let Hell loose by slaying their
Brother Boers, though personally I do not call an Englishman my
brother, but a Great Thief and a Bloody Monster.</p>

<p class="letter">You will be pleased to hear that we killed
sixty of the enemy last week, which brings up the average of the
enemy's slain and wounded, but would not have done had not Piet
van Heerden shot a few who were undecided whether to live or
die&mdash;so grievously were they wounded.</p>

<p class="letter">I had a letter from Louis Botha last week by
way of Ermelo, telling me that we must fight while there is one
man left to hold a rifle, and a single white flag remains in our
lines, and if we get too hard-pressed and see no way of escaping
from the hands of the Philistines, he will arrange for a week's
armistice to discuss peace terms, which my son (who is with me
and well) says is a much better way of gaining time than asking
for 24 hours to bury your dead&mdash;and my son was at
Stellenbosch training for the ministry, and is the slimmest kerl*
that ever shot a doctor.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>slimmest kerl</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;
naughtiest boy, most wicked chap. ]</p>

<p class="cp">THOSE KIND OFFICERS</p>

<p class="letter">We are ready and willing to die for our beloved
country, but the burghers' hearts are crying out, "How long, How
long, 0 Lord? How long shall the barbarian sit at the gates of
the Chosen? How long shall the reign of they that sit in darkness
carry fire and sword through all the Land of Israel?"</p>

<p class="letter">I forgot to tell you in my last letter that we
managed to blow up an ambulance train near Geneva. There were
more than eighty sick soldiers in it, and you could hear them
shout a mile away, so Andries, my brother, told me. I might tell
you that Andries is the life of the <i>laager</i>; he is such a
comical rascal, he goes out dressed in khaki, and rides up to the
enemy's patrol, and if the patrol is only one man, Andries shoots
him quite close and brings his boots back into camp. He has got
such a collection that I tell him he must start a
winkel*&mdash;so many boots has he got.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>winkel</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;a shop, a
store. ]</p>

<p class="letter">You must not be bang* for him, dear brother
Marais, because when the English, catch a Boer dressed in khaki
they do not shoot him, but ask him why he is dressed so, and when
he says that all his other clothes are worn out by continual
trekking, and that if he did not wear looted khaki he would have
to be in rags, the English officer says, "Poor devil!" and
reports to his general that the Boers are in a very bad way, and
that they might all surrender it any minute.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>bang</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;afraid.
]</p>

<p class="cp">BEWARE OF THE COLONIALS!</p>

<p class="letter">I have warned Andries not to get caught by the
Australians and the other colonials if he is dressed in khaki,
because several khaki burghers were captured by the Bushmen, and
I have not seen their names in the list of prisoner&mdash;and
that was six months ago.</p>

<p class="letter">You will be pleased to hear that we have our
services regularly twice every Sabbath, accept when we are on the
trek. Sometimes I read to the burghers, and sometimes Andries,
and sometimes old Oom van Streuben. We have Psalms and an
address.</p>

<p class="letter">Last Sunday Andries gave a beautiful address on
"The Earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of the earth is the
Lord's also." And he told us how it was ordained by the Almighty
that man should live by that which was extracted from the Land;
that the People of the Land were the chosen people of Israel. Not
those who dwelt in the cities, but those who dwelt on the farms,
were the chosen. The English, he said, lived in cities; we lived
in farms&mdash;the English, by robbing and cheating and leading
immoral lives; we, by the fruits of the soil and the bounties of
the soil which the Lord gave unto mankind. It was a good sermon,
but I do not think the burghers cared so much for it as they
might. They are, as you know, mostly cattle farmers and bywoners,
and have never grown mealies or corn in their lives.</p>

<p class="letter">Talking of the treasures of the earth, I could
not find the dynamite which you said in your last letter was
buried in this district. I found a Maxim at Witpoort, also some
ammunition; but the Maxim was so eaten up with rust and the
cartridges so perished that I left the gun for a British column
that was allowing me&mdash;you may have read the account of its
capture in the Cape papers.</p>

<p class="letter">We are all very well clad, and so far we have
not run short of ammunition, but we have no tobacco.</p>

<p class="cp">NO WORRY ABOUT THE WIFE</p>

<p class="letter">In spite of this we are all very happy. I have
nothing now to trouble about. My wife is in the women's laager,
near Kroonstad, also, my two children, and they are all living so
well and getting so fat that I shall not know them&mdash;so says
my wife in a letter to me which be sent out by Erasmus Cloete,
who, you know, is now in the employ of the English as a
<i>landdrost</i>,* or justice, or something, he having become
British, at I forget how much, a month.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>landdrost</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;an
official with local jurisdiction. ]</p>

<p class="letter">My son's wife is in Pretoria, where the English
Government allows her coals, and coffee, and meat, and meal, and
she says she is very friendly with the English soldiers, and they
like her very ouch, as she gives a few of them nice new bread to
eat, which they like much better than their biscuits.</p>

<p class="letter">I hear that the outlanders are not to be
allowed back to Johannesburg yet, for fear we attack the town,
and that even if the English did not fear this, the outlanders
could not come up, because all the rolling stock that is not
required to carry up soldiers is wanted for carrying the
prisoners of war, who are being returned to the country.</p>

<p class="letter">Have you heard of the latest English madness?
Surely they are all fools! Not only are they bringing back all
the prisoners they took away&mdash;from Ceylon, from India, and
from St. Helena&mdash;but they are going to give as many as
want&mdash;what to you think? A horse and a rifle and ammunition!
And why, do you think? They are to be sent out to hunt up
burghers' cattle and bring in the burghers' stock! Well, I don't
mind. I can do with a few recruits, and if they bring their own
rifles and ammunition, so much the better, say I.</p>

<p class="letter">But, perhaps, you know as much about all this
as I do&mdash;still there can be no harm in giving you these
tips. Byers is at Zand River Poort. He is well laagered, and they
do say that the whole British Army could not move him from his
position.</p>

<p class="cp">NEVER WAIT FOR METHUEN!</p>

<p class="letter">As for me, I am holding a kopje from which I
could defy two armies, but I am trekking to-night, for I hear
that Methuen is moving in this direction&mdash;and, brother
Marais, take this tip, never wait for Methuen. My! but he was did
about Spytkoppies (?Magersfontein), and he has been wild ever
since. Also be cautious of the Yeomen; they are not such fools as
I thought after reading that Pink English paper you sent
me&mdash;they cannot ride much, but they can shoot&mdash;also
they do not run. If you meet any of &mdash;&mdash; Horse, shoot
at them a little, and then go and take their horses and rifles,
but do not hurt them, for later they will be given new horses and
new rifles&mdash;and I want new rifles. Also do not try to rush a
blockhouse that is held by English foot-soldiers. Gert
Marais&mdash;he is no relation of yours, but you will remember
him, the tall Veld Cornet with the light- hair and the red
eyes&mdash;well, Gert Marais tried to do this by Heidelberg. He
took fifty men with him, as there were only ten holding the post,
and they started firing their rifles at sun-up, and then galloped
down towards the fort. I am sorry for Gert; he was a nice man,
but inclined to be quarrelsome. Will you tell his brother, who is
with you? Gert and ten others and a cross over each&mdash;the
English are good about these things.</p>

<p class="letter">I am sending this letter by my son Willem. He

<h2><a id="art27" name="art27">THE BASER KIND OF BOER</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Wanganui Chronicle</i> (New Zealand),
August 27, 1901</h3>

<p class="cp">STANDERTON, June 8, 1901</p>

<p>One of the idiosyncrasies of English temperament is the desire
to find fault with work well done because it has not been done
better.</p>

<p>However satisfied we are with the results of a battle, our
satisfaction is invariably tempered by the length of our casualty
list, while on the other hand, if we by any chance effect
movement with little or no loss to ourselves, the doubt will
probably occur in the minds of nine out of ten intelligent
critics, "Would not this movement of General Blank's have been
even more prolific in results had he moved with less caution?"
After all, it is only a superficial criticism; the thing that men
who open their morning papers in the train snap across the
carriage to one another.</p>

<p>In their innermost hearts they know we are doing our best out
here&mdash;that we don't throw away our lives to get our names
into the paper, or crawl on our hands and knees across the veldt
to avoid casualties. I say all this, because I do not know how
you will accept the Vlakfontein-Naauwpoort fight, accounts of
which I have cabled you.</p>

<p class="cp">IT WAS A VICTORY</p>

<p>I was near Pietersburg, about 200 miles away from the scene of
the fight, when it occurred, and by the greatest luck in the
world I heard of it within a couple of hours. As fast as a
joggling, rattling, South-Eastern-like goods train could carry me
I was on my way back to Krugersdorp a few hours afterwards. Until
I got to Krugersdorp I was not certain whether we were to call
this last affair of ours a disaster or a great victory, and a
victory in spite of our heavy casualty list. Not only did we
drive off an enemy outnumbering us by three to one, but by the
splendid dash of our infantry we have established the irrefutable
fact that, in spite of 20 months' hard fighting and tedious
trekking, and the lugubrious views of the <i>Times</i>
correspondent notwithstanding, the old hands are just as fit and
just as keen as ever.</p>

<p>And it was a moral victory also. Abandoning the old methods of
dropping the butt-end of a rifle on the wounded soldier's face,
when there was none to see the villainy, the Boer has done his
bloody work in the light of day, within sight of a dozen eye-
witnesses, and the stories we have hardly dared to hint, lest you
thought we had grown hysterical, we can now tell without fear of
ridicule. The Boers murder wounded men.</p>

<p>Yes, the gentle, bucolic Boer, who was forced to take up the
rifle, purchased for him a dozen years before by a paternal
Government, to guard the independence of his country, may be
placed in the same category as the Matabele, the Mashona, the
Dervish, the Afridi, and with every other savage race with whom
Britain has waged war. And the soldier who is stricken down on
the field is no more certain that his life will be spared by his
brother Boer than he was that brother Fussy would pass him
by.</p>

<p class="cp">A FREQUENT INCIDENT</p>

<p>You will say that the Boers have not consistently killed off
our wounded. Indeed, there are instances where they have treated
our men very well. That is so; under Commandant De la Rey's eye
these atrocities would never have been committed, and the wounded
soldier within view of that, or any other Boer commandant of his
order of intelligence, would have been as safe as any Christian
who sought sanctuary at the feet of Li Hung Chang.</p>

<p>The murdering of the wounded has been a common feature of the
war, but except in one or two cases we have had none other than
circumstantial evidence. On the day of the sortie from Kimberley
half a dozen men swore that the wounded who fell with Scott-
Turner had been deliberately murdered, and similar instances have
come to light during the campaign. What does this prove? It
proves the truth of a statement that has been made before, and
proves it better than the amount of abstract reasoning would
do&mdash;the Boer is half a savage. I make this statement
dispassionately, without feeling any greater resentment towards
the Boer than I should were I describing the cat as half a tiger.
He is a savage not from wickedness, nor from any criminal effort,
only just because, like Dr Watt's dog, it is his nature to.</p>

<p>Three stages marked the advance of primitive man from absolute
savagery to civilisation, the "finding," the "raising," and the
"making" stages. At present the Boer is but in the "finding." As
primitive man learned first to find and kill animals for his
consumption, and then with the first glimmerings of intellect
reasoned that it would not be at all a bad idea, if he herded or
stored some of the findings, and so became a cattle farmer; so
did the <i>voortrekker</i> turn from pot-hunting to herding, and
there he has stuck.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>voortrekker</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;a
pioneer, literally "one who treks ahead." ]</p>

<p class="cp">EXPLAINING HIS SAVAGERY</p>

<p>The average Boer is a cattle farmer pure and simple, very few
have learned to produce from the land for the market, and
consequently the aboriginal is further advanced economically than
he, for the native raises a considerable crop, having reached the
second stage, and his success in the third being merely a matter
for education and time to assure. I am speaking now of the
Transvaal and Orange River Colony Boers, since one industry in
the Cape Colony thrives languidly, as the wine farmers of the
Western Province will tell you. The Boer does not "raise" for the
market; indeed, he even depends on the native crops for his own
meagre requirements, and by this fact alone he must take second
place to the native in the standard of economic utility, since
the Kaffir can, apart from other sources, sustain an independent
existence, that is, he can live by his own winnings from the
soil.</p>

<p>The Krugerian regime is all to blame for this, not only for
the ignorance and unintelligence of the Boers in the two
Republics, but for the conservatism which made the burgher of the
Cape Colony reject any attempt to educate him. The Transvaal gave
the lead; it made the pace of progress. The dogmatism of its
orthodox educational methods was the faith of the Free State, and
the unassailable creed of the Afrikander. As fast as the South
African Republic moved along the road that leads to
enlightenment, and a wider and more comprehensive view of life
and men, so fast did the Free State and the Cape Colony move.
Only, unfortunately, the Transvaal did not move at all, and the
rest of Dutch Africa remained correspondingly stagnant. No
attempt was made by the Krugerian Government&mdash;no honest
attempt&mdash;to bring light to the enlightened. No effort was
made to educate the burghers to a knowledge of their
possibilities. They did not realise the potentialities with which
an accident of fortune had endowed them.</p>

<p>The discovery of gold at Johannesburg might have been for them
the gift of the gods had a wise and honest Administration been
theirs. The finding of gold, and the consequent influx of capital
and people into the country might have brought about a social
revolution, making the farmer a real factor in the development of
South Africa. Indeed, the gold discovery was the very challenge
of Fate.</p>

<p class="cp">STATE-AIDED BURGHERS</p>

<p>But the existence of the Krugerian regime rested solely on the
ignorance of the farmer, and the Boer, instead of being
encouraged to produce, was offered every inducement to stagnate.
A price was put on his indolence. He was told times without
number that, so long as his vote was given in the right
direction, the State would see that he did not want. He was
taught to look upon the <i>Uitlander</i> as the goose whose
golden eggs were to save him from worrying about the future.
President Kruger's system of teaching soon resulted in a very
fine crop of State-aided "poor burghers." What was farcically
termed the agricultural community of the Transvaal was in reality
a voting community. A man was not valued because he enriched the
land, or because he improved the breed of cattle, or because he
seriously attempted towards the amelioration of the farming
classes, but because he was a voting unit; he could be depended
on to return to Parliament some one who would legislate to the
<i>Uitlanders</i>' discomfort&mdash;and incidentally to the
Boer's advantage. Kruger crippled the farmer&mdash;or rather,
with all the innate cunning that characterised his rule, he
assisted the farmer to cripple himself.</p>

<p>So much has been written on the system by which the Pretorian
oligarchy was upheld that I have only touched on this aspect, and
that to adduce a reason for the many otherwise inexplicable
exhibitions of savagery which have from time to time "staggered
humanity." Education is not necessarily an elementary knowledge
of the arts; it is the cognisance and appreciation of
humanity&mdash;its laws, its emotions, its boundless
possibilities. And Kruger has stifled the Boers' education in its
birth, and the Javah of his well-thumbed Testament shall judge
him by his opportunities.</p>

<h2><a id="art28" name="art28">
HOW THE PUBLIC IS DEPRIVED OF NEWS</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), August 28,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">PRETORIA, June 19, 1901</p>

<p>They do not want war correspondents in South Africa; I don't
know whether "they" ever wanted them.</p>

<p>War correspondents have their uses, of course. They explain
things satisfactorily. They retouch the spotty negatives of
disasters, and make quite pretty pictures of them. They remark at
decent intervals that General So-and-so is a fine upstanding
gallant Englishman, worthy of the trust, confidence, and other
rewards of the British nation. Sometimes they break away from
beaten paths and say nasty things about Those in Authority, and
then they receive unofficial hints that if they will persist in
their Unholy and Abominable ways of life, the next time there as
a fat, comfortable, six weeks' war (illustrated) they won't be
given a free ticket, and will probably be forced by circumstances
to accept a position as war expert on a Radical morning
newspaper.</p>

<p>The war correspondent is the pest of the Army. He is not the
only pest, however; there are several others mentioned in the
<i>Soldier's Pocket-Book</i>, only they are not called pests, but
Acceptable Precepts. They would have remained Acceptable Precepts
to the end of time had it not been for this war; which has
proved, if it has proved anything, that you cannot wage war
successfully by a close adherence to rules contained in printed,
books.</p>

<p class="cp">THE EXODUS</p>

<p>When the war ended last August the army was freed from the
pestilence to a great extent. The contaminating influences went
home first-class, some to produce books, some to give lectures,
some to wander in Arcady and pipe the song of Pan, and
some&mdash;the more expensive&mdash;to enter Parliament and
advocate economy.</p>

<p>With the second edition of the war in November and December
came the return of two of the great correspondents; also about
that time I returned.</p>

<p>No others came back, however, and the correspondence of the
war was left in the hands of four London. journalists (for one,
and the best of us all, Howell Gwynne, of Reuter's Agency, had
not left his post) and by hundreds of local correspondents
scattered throughout South Africa&mdash;and these latter have
rendered much excellent service to the London reader. But the
local correspondent is a man who is making his home in the
country. His existence in the Transvaal must necessarily depend
on the terms he keeps with the military. He does not criticise
military operations adversely; he studiously keeps as far as
possible out of the range of polemics. He is practically under
the thumb of the censor.</p>

<p>I could quote many instances to demonstrate the fact that the
Government has it all its own way as far as the local
correspondents are concerned, that it is only from the London
special, who is prepared to say what he thinks without the fear
that his outspokenness will result in his ruin, that you can
expect to receive an honest criticism. The British Government
knows his, and it also knows that a newspaper can afford to keep
an expensive correspondent in the field just so long as that
correspondent as able to send by cable long and important cables
from the theatre of war.</p>

<p class="cp">THE "FREEZING-OUT" PROCESS</p>

<p>You cannot afford to keep correspondent in the field, costing
hundreds of pounds a month, if you get no other return for your
money than a meagre weekly message, from which every item of
interest has been carefully excised&mdash;and hence a new
regulation regarding the censoring of messages.</p>

<p>"In future the length of correspondents' wires will be in
proportion to the importance of the news contained therein."</p>

<p>This, in effect, is the gist of the new instructions. Just
think that means. The correspondent may attach himself to a
column operating against Botha, or De Wet, or Buyers. He may be
away from the wire-end for a fortnight or a month; all will
depend on what actions the agile enemy takes. At the end of that
time the column returns to the railway to refit, and the
correspondent may then cable. All the time he has been away he
has not sent a single message lest it should fall into the hands
of the Boers and prematurely reveal the General's plans. What is
he allowed to send now, after the fortnight's absence? Everything
now must depend on the success of the movement. If it has been
more than ordinarily successful, he may let himself go to the
extent of half a column; if the trek has been middlingly
productive, he must confine himself to half a dozen lines; if it
has been a fiasco, he had better wire about something
else&mdash;the weather, the state of the country, or the optimism
of the Headquarter Staff.</p>

<p class="cp">WHICH IS IT TO BE?</p>

<p>The Government seems to think that this is the time for a more
vigorous censorship, for at this period the situation is becoming
less military than political.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I am of the opinion, and it is an opinion
which will be shared by thousands, that at this stage the
censorship should be entirely removed, as far as Press
correspondence goes. As far as the military position is
concerned, there is absolutely nothing to justify the maintenance
of the censorship. A wire of mine to the effect that Colonel
Colenbrander had arrived at Pietersburg with sixty prisoners was
censored because it dealt with the movement of troops! Could
anything be more absurd and childish?</p>

<p class="cp">THE ROSE OF THE PRINCESS</p>

<p>When the war broke out, and for some time afterwards, it was
very necessary to conceal our movements. It was necessary once, I
believe, to put a sentry over a rose that a famous princess
admired. The rose faded and died, but the sentry remained. The
flowers were dug up and tomatoes planted in the place, but the
sentry remained for years after; and years after, when the
tomatoes had become cabbages, he still delivered over to his
relief the order, "Not to allow any person to pluck the rose of
the princess." And so the old restrictions, so necessary at the
beginning of the war, when Kruger had Delagoa Bay for his
purposes, and the cable worked, and envoys passed freely between
Lorenco Marquez, are still held as indispensable, at a time when
the Boers have no interest in the telegraph line other than as
something to cut.</p>

<p>The censorship has had its innings; it has served its purpose.
It can go. To use it now, when the only service it can render is
a political one, is creating a bad precedent. It savours somewhat
of Russia; nay, it is Krugerian. Personally, there is nothing
that I wish to say that I don't say&mdash;by letter. But I want
to say it by wire.</p>

<p class="cp">"THE TIME IS AT HAND"</p>

<p>It is right that England should know at the time what is
happening and what is felt. There is much that Lord Kitchener
does not think important enough to cable to Downing Street that I
think is of sufficiently interesting to send to Carmelite House.*
It is not fair that because Lord Kitchener is a poor
correspondent his unofficial rivals are to be prevented from
competing with him.</p>

<p>As for me, I do not wish to compete with the Headquarter
Staff. Casualty lists are hardly in my line, but I think the time
is close at hand when I shall want to wire something that Lord
Kitchener will not wish to send or the Government to receive.</p>

<h2><a id="art29" name="art29">WHY THE WAR DRAGS</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), September 5,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">"CANNOT&mdash;ACCEPT&mdash;RESPONSIBILITY"</p>

<p class="cp">PRETORIA, June 20, 1901</p>

<p>It was in answer to a wire of mine, which I had despatched to
a Press censor in the Orange River Colony, that I received this
laconic, but to me, significant, phrase, "Cannot accept
responsibility."</p>

<p>One of my messages to the <i>Daily Mail</i> had been stopped
in transit, and I had urged by telegraph that it should be
allowed to proceed.</p>

<p>"Cannot accept responsibility," said the censor, and the
message was presumably relegated to the waste-paper basket. It
was not, I might say, a world-shaking message, nor one calculated
to stir to its depths established society. Not even a peace-
negotiation-movement-of-troops-end-in-sight message. But I wanted
to get it "through," though my perseverance was due rather more
to the fear of being forestalled by other Press correspondents in
the delivery of my news than to the great value of the
intelligence I wanted to put on the wire.</p>

<p>I make this explanation lest I convey the impression that this
also is a criticism of the censorship. The censor's message,
however, is one which will bear speculating on, for therein lies
the secret of our non-success; for what is true of this
particular censor is true of 99 per cent of the officers employed
in South Africa. When I say non-success, I do so advisedly, since
one cannot shut one's eyes to the fact that the extent of the
country and the mobility of the Boer forces are not alone
responsible for the prolongation of the war. Indeed, it would be
unpatriotic in the extreme to encourage a national colour-
blindness which recognises only the crimson and gold of triumph
and ignores the blackness of humiliation and disaster.</p>

<p class="cp">MANY EXPLANATIONS</p>

<p>When the question has arisen, Why does the war drag? there has
always been a plentiful supply of apologists ready at hand to
explain away any onus that might attach to the Headquarter Staff;
to the generals, to the officers, to those responsible for the
newly-constructed Civil Administration. Why is not the war ended?
and a dozen special correspondents hasten to explain. It is
because the lies of the Boer leaders keep the burghers in the
field, said the <i>Times</i> Carolina correspondent a few weeks
back.</p>

<p>It is the incapacity of the officers; brainless dandies with
not two ideas in their shallow pates beyond Bridge and Polo. This
was the opinion&mdash;and probably is still of a gentleman who
should speak with authority, since he has been kicked out of more
messes than most men.</p>

<p>It has been our inability to grasp the essentials of South
African campaigning, light transport, and light horsemen. But
Cape Carts and Mounted Infantry have been adopted, and we are no
nearer the end now than we were when Botha and Buller discussed
peace terms, and cow guns* were <i>de rigueur</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>cow gun</i>&mdash;the popular name of a
5-inch artillery piece used during the Boer war. ]</p>

<p>To my mind, however, you have to look no further than the
censor's message, and in the fear of responsibility which is
peculiar to the British officer you will find the true cause for
the slowness of progression.</p>

<p>There was a column operating in the north of the Orange River
Colony. It had been trekking all day, and towards evening was
approaching the farm which the commanding officer had chosen for
his bivouac. Just before the farm was reached, the advanced
scouts retired on to the main body with the information that
about seven miles further on was a Boer
<i>laager</i>&mdash;evidently one of considerable size.</p>

<p>The commanding officer's Intelligence gave him no exact
information as to the composition and strength of the commando,
and he hesitated whether to attack and bring on an engagement, or
whether to leave the Boers severely alone, and wait for
instructions from the General conducting operations in the
district. He decided to do the latter. It subsequently proved
that, had he posted his men and made an attack on the following
morning, he must have at least captured the enemy's convoy, which
was a considerable one, if, indeed, he had not crippled! the
enemy. He would not take the risk of a casualty list; he would
not accept the responsibility. He was not afraid for his life or
the lives of the men under him, but he was greatly fearful for
his reputation.</p>

<p>The hastily-dug trench and the funeral service in the waning
light, these had no terrors for him; but to draw up a thousand-
word report, eight hundred of which referred to casualties, this
was a horror not to be faced. In fact, the grave was less
terrible than the Remount Camp at Stellenbosch.</p>

<p class="cp">WHAT IS THE HIGHEST COURAGE?</p>

<p>So long as the responsibility lies elsewhere, the British
officer is willing and able to do most things. Physically he is
the bravest of the brave. In moral courage he is not encouraged
to be strong.</p>

<p>So long as a man will not risk that which he values most he is
not playing the hero. Realise this: to the average officer Life
comes but third in the list of Precious Things. That intangible
and elastic quality, Honour, makes a good first, and if not
comprehended in that term, Reputation comes second.</p>

<p>And a very satisfactory state of affairs too, you say
complacently. Quite so, only remember that it is the
unwillingness of the officer to risk his reputation or the fear
of strangling it at its birth that is responsible for the
dragging on of the war. It is responsible for all the evils that
we call by other names&mdash;The Niceness of War, The
Magnanimity, The False Humanity.</p>

<p>The Boer cares less for his reputation than he does for his
native's soul, and as for his Honour, why there is no word in the
<i>taal</i> that adequately conveys the sense of the word. He
husbands life, and lets his reputation take care of itself. If he
does that which we would call disgraceful, he is not kicked out
of his club, because he has not got a club. He won't be cut in
the Row, because he has no Row, and his friends have not yet
acquired the gentle art of cutting. If he is riding along in the
vicinity of a railway line with a few pounds of dynamite in his
holsters, he does not "have the honour to request" the permission
of the <i>hoofdcommandant</i> to blow up the next troop-train
that passes. He just blows it up, and casually mentions the fact
the next time he meets his chief.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>hoofdcommandant</i>
(Afrikaans)&mdash;commander-in-chief. ]</p>

<p>The seeming inability to take the initiative has been one of
the depressing characteristics of the war. The stagnation which
has caused commercial England to become such a happy hunting-
ground for the hustling Yankee is very apparent in the Army. The
Boers have taught us many ingenious tricks of war. Inspectors of
fortifications would not have dared to suggest, before the war
that barbed wire would play so prominent a part in our defences
as it has. They would not have dared, for their reputation's
sake, to advise that we should make good the ground as fast as we
won it, by erecting a chain of blockhouses from one end of the
country to the other. Inspectors of Cavalry would have hesitated
before proposing the reforms that the light-riding Boer rendered
compulsory. We wait to be shown, to have practical demonstrations
before we improve our methods&mdash;only the demonstrator happens
to be the enemy, and while we are learning he is gaining
time.</p>

<p class="cp">THE SOLDIERS OF GENIUS</p>

<p>The war has not produced any very great generals. We have had
passable commanders who have managed to steer clear of blunders,
but the touch of greatness that distinguished Wellington, and
Napoleon, and Moltke is wanting. In two men only does the
Napoleonic fearlessness of consequences seem evident, and these
two men are French and Plumer.</p>

<p>French's performance before Colesberg was the finest piece of
generalship of the war. The splendid audacity with which be
manoeuvred his men&mdash;he held a line of thirty miles with a
few thousand troops. His magnificent dash: his foresight: his
originality and departure from iron-bound regulation methods.</p>

<p>And Plumer, too, has these qualities. I have seen him rush off
into the wilderness after a flying enemy with only two days'
supplies on his transport. He never hesitated, although every
day's march he put between himself and the supply base meant a
two day's wait for food. Calm, imperturbable, gentle always, he
never hesitates.</p>

<p>When he was following De Wet, the town guard of Hopetown
mistook his column for the enemy and opened a vigorous fire on
his advance guard. To wait until the zealous citizens could be
communicated with by flag of truce meant delay. Ninety-nine
commanders out of a hundred would hive risked the delay, and
would have cited the town guard's action as an excuse. Plumer did
not fear to take a little responsibility.</p>

<p>"A little pom-pom, please," he said in that gentle voice of
his. Yes, Plumer turned his pom pom upon the overzealous
defenders of Hopetown. Nobody was killed: somebody was badly
frightened&mdash;and there was no delay.</p>

<p>We periodically hold up the Colonial officer as a pattern of
all that an officer should be. The reasons we adduce for his
superiority over his regular comrade are various and amusing. It
is his knowledge of the country, his acquaintance with the
conditions of life in the bush, his ignorance of military regime,
his training as a hunter.</p>

<p>The real secret is this: the Colonial officer accepts
responsibility. He scores off his own bat. How many times could
not commanding officers have brought off coups during this war if
they had had the moral courage to act without written
instructions? What would have happened had Pilcher summarily
dealt with the Sunnyside rebels&mdash;the first rebels of the war
instead of referring them to Capetown? Supposing he had accepted
the responsibility of dealing with them, and had tried them by
court-martial and shot a few, do you think that there would have
been any threats of rebellion a year later?</p>

THE FORGOTTEN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Evening Post</i> (New Zealand), September 7, 1901</h3>

<p class="cp">"UNADVERTISED SOLDIERS"</p>

<p>Let us make holiday.</p>

<p>I am tired of the eternal trek, the everlasting veldt, where
rotting carcasses of sheep and oxen putrefy the air. I am sick of
the same hotels of corrugated iron and frowsy smoking-room; the
same broad, untidy streets, with the identical ugly church that I
left in the monotonously same town sixty miles away. Same
talk&mdash;war, Boers, and settlement. Same dress&mdash;khaki,
relieved now by the black armlet in memory of the 22nd January.
The self-same dinner, with the self-same sweet&mdash;rice
pudding. It all palls, it mostly sickens. Let us make holiday.
Where shall we go?</p>

<p class="cp">YOUR CHOICE OF CHANGE</p>

<p>It really all depends on how your fancy runs. Some there are
whose idea of holidays is very much that of the bus-driver who
spent his day off on the box of a friend's vehicle. Perhaps your
| taste runs to industrial exhibitions. What shall it be? Boots,
Leicester? You will find Leicester somewhere down Delagoa Bay
line. It is guarding the rail in the vicinity of Middelberg, and
lives in little tin blockhouses. It was in Ladysmith during the
siege, and as it had no false pride about taking cover when the
enemy was unusually active and usually accurate, it has not lost
so many men as its brave but misguided fellows of the line, and
in consequence it is not a Celebrated Regiment. And by Celebrated
Regiment I mean one that has figured in a music-hall chorus.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would prefer to go farther north. Let us go to
Carlisle. Carlisle is somewhere down by Klerksdorp, and Carlisle
has just had rather a bad time, for was it not at
Vlaakfontein?</p>

<p>Possibly you have a penchant for the Highlands, and the
Highlands are at Kroonstadt, and were at Modder River and
Magersfontein&mdash;and at Balaklava, where the descriptive
writer likened it to a thin red line.</p>

<p>Or Yorkshire? You will find Huddersfield at Warm Baths, and it
has not left its hospitality at home, for behind the barbed wire
apron and the six-foot trench you will be asked to stay to lunch,
and a very good lunch the West Ridings will give you.</p>

<p>As for me, I went to Kent, for it is my country. I wanted
white chalk roads, and orchards, and strong-scented hopfields,
and gardens and the upstanding stretch of the rugged Rag. I
wanted Kent, so I went there; for Kent lies at the fag end of the
Heilbron line, on the outskirts of the inevitable town from which
I was fleeing. Kent was there&mdash;Maidenstone, Tonbridge,
Bartford, Chatham, Rochester, Gravesend, Paddock Wood,
Woolwich&mdash;and Greenwich.</p>

<p class="cp">ALL KINDS OF KENT</p>

<p>You don't hear much about Kent at Home, or, as a matter of
fact, about Yorkshire, or Carlisle, or Argyll, or Sutherland. In
these days we are an Imperial people, and we think in Red. You
hear of Canada, and of Australia, and of New Zealand, and of
India; also you hear of China, but not of Kent.</p>

<p>Ottawa, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Auckland, Christchurch,
are more often on your tongues than is Maidstone, or Canterbury,
or Sevenoaks. Your new brooms are made of splendid material, but
the old articles that swept Russia from Sebastopol, and France
from Waterloo, they are wearing well. The men who had the science
of war ground into them at the Regimental Depots have done
well&mdash;never let that slip from your memory, for if you do
you will be unjust&mdash;criminally unjust, and you are not
unjust as a rule, only somewhat careless and forgetful.</p>

<p>So I have been to Kent&mdash;West Kent, Royal West
Kent&mdash;. Nay, I will give them their full and honourable
title. I have been to have a look at the Second Battalion of the
50th Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment. They were very pleased
to see me&mdash;the men&mdash;because we talked about Greenwich,
and the twenty-four-hour clock on Observatory Hill, and of
Blackheath in relation to bank holidays, and Shooter's Hill
Cemetery, and Woolwich Arsenal and the prospects of works thereat
after the war. And of Deptford Broadway, and Mill- lane, and
Church-street. Also of Bromley and blackberrying, and of public-
houses in the New-cross-road and their relative excellencies. And
we discussed the war, and Mr. Chamberlain and ex-President
Kruger, who excites the admiration of the Deptford section by
reason of his close adherence to his millions. And of Ancient
History we spake. Prinsloo's surrender, and grass fires, and
wounded men perishing in the flames&mdash;and all in Cockney
accents. The West Kents see the world across the well-filled bowl
of a favourite pipe, and are philosophical. They talked football,
and they reminded me that they had had the Army Cup once, and
nearly had it twice&mdash;nor did I need reminding, since every
good soldier knows that the men who wear the White Horse of Kent
are good sportsmen par excellence.</p>

<p>Why have I brought you here, good reader of the <i>Daily
Mail</i>? Why have I brought you to Kent via Heilbron when you
might have got there via Cannon-street&mdash;in a day or two?</p>

<p class="cp">REMEMBER THOMAS ATKINS OF THE LINE</p>

<p>It is to remind you that there are other soldiers in the field
than the irregulars so well advertised because of the uniqueness
of their entry into our rough Island Story. Patient, hardworking,
hard-fighting men, capable now as they were a year ago of doing
anything and at any time. The West Kents are not the only
regiment serving in South Africa, the presence of which the
outside public would never suspect. It is one of the many
regiments which have passed through the campaign&mdash;or a
portion of the campaign&mdash; without a display of fireworks or
the possession of a pet correspondent; so, let me for the day be
that pet correspondent, and drag them from the seclusion into
which they have retired through foolishly doing their duty.</p>

<p>This may read as though I have a regiment or regiments in my
eye which have adopted such a method&mdash;figuratively speaking,
of course&mdash;but this is not so, though nobody who has
campaigned in South Africa can be blind to the fact that not a
little of the notoriety of men and brigades has been owing to the
presence of a correspondent who has been so comfortably quartered
and so well treated that he has not had the slightest inclination
to leave, and has in consequence dealt so frequently with the
doings of some particular General or some brigade that his
repetitions have told, and the General or brigade has become as
famous as Beecham's Pills or Cuticura Soap. Then again, some
regiments are of themselves picturesque, and if I had to describe
an action in which the Black Watch and the Somerset Light
Infantry figured, I know which figure the special artist would
choose to illustrate an incident.</p>

<p>This doesn't matter very much so long as you do not forget the
existence of the regiments whose names do not recur. As a matter
of fact, I don't believe that they care the proverbial tuppence
whether you talk about them or not, only&mdash;well, they are
human. Think of them not as on parade with a Colonel on a
prancing horse and the band playing a march, but as little groups
of silent, thoughtful, smoking men, dotted about all over the
country, living in blockhouses&mdash;men from Kent and men from
Surrey, men from Hants and men from Durham. A hundred thousand
unadvertised soldiers, whose claim to renown is that there are
none better in the whole wide world.</p>

<h2><a id="art31" name="art31">A LITTLE PESSIMISM</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Poverty Bay Herald</i> (New Zealand),
September 24, 1901</h3>

<p class="cp">PRETORIA, July 11, 1901</p>

<p>Hopeful on Monday, distinctly Encouraging on Tuesday, Doubtful
on Wednesday, Gloomy on Thursday, Alarming on Friday, Hopeless on
Saturday, the South African situation viewed from Pretoria is as
variable in quality as an April day.</p>

<p>Hope, Encouragement, Doubt, Gloom, and Alarm, in rapid
succession; and over, and through all, an uneasiness that tempers
our optimism and justifies the forebodings of the chronic
pessimist.</p>

<p>It is now eight months since Lord Kitchener assumed charge of
operations in the three colonies. During a similar period, and
immediately preceding this, Lord Roberts captured Cronje,
occupied in turn Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, and Pretoria,
captured Prinsloo and his thousands, relieved Kimberley,
Ladysmith, and Mafeking, and defeated Louis Botha at Belfast.
Were I to draw any comparison between the work accomplished by
Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener, I should hold myself up a
splendid target for your ridicule; and, indeed, there can be no
comparison, for the task Lord Roberts set himself to do was by
far a lighter one than that which he banded over to his Chief of
Staff.</p>

<p>Lord Kitchener has had a hard, heartbreaking work to perform,
without having had any particular brilliant battles to
record&mdash;modest man that he is, he has even denied
one!&mdash; and whatever one may think of his execution, there
can be no question at all as to the difficulties of the
undertaking. I have merely called your attention to the time
lengths to impress upon you the term of Kitchener's stewardship,
a fact one may remember with advantage in considering the tale of
results. Prisoners we have taken; Boers we have killed; we have
driven De Wet out of Cape Colony with a "great loss of
prestige"&mdash;which we trust De Wet in his saner moments
realises&mdash;and by this last action the danger of a general
rising of the Dutch throughout the Cape Colony was averted, if,
indeed, not altogether crushed.</p>

<p>But a fact that should be borne in mind&mdash;and it is a
fact&mdash;is that the feeling among the Boer commandoes is not
less bitter, and the general desire for surrender no greater than
it was on the day Lord Roberts handed over his command. I will go
so far as to state that we are not so near a general handing in
of arms and a peaceful settlement as we were thirteen months ago,
and I am confident that there never will be a general surrender,
but that the war, if we then dignify it by that title, will
continue as long as there are fifty burghers to carry arms.</p>

<p>One thing seems certain, that no big movement against Botha
may be expected for at least three months&mdash;that is, if ever
another movement on a large scale is intended against the Boer
chief. I gather this from the fact that it has been found
absolutely necessary to reinforce General French in the Cape
Colony with the Cavalry brigade and other troops amounting to
15,000 men, and by the movement northward of the columns that
have lately been engaged in the neighborhood of Ermelo. This
latter presumably foreshadows a combined movement against Beyers,
who, with Brand, is holding a position near Zand River Poort, and
who recently directed the attack on the train on the Petersburg
line.</p>

<p>There are certain truths that we do not care to hear, certain
precious beliefs that we object to seeing ruthlessly shattered.
But this I tell you, that as an actual observer, and one
prejudiced rather to optimism than the reverse, I see no prospect
of a general surrender, and no promise of a state of affairs
sufficiently assuring to permit the withdrawal of a single
brigade from South Africa.</p>

<p>Nor am I alone in making this, for in a special order dated
Army Headquarters, July 3, and addressed to the General and
Officers commanding Columns in the Field, Lord Kitchener
confesses that as yet the Boers do not seem to have been brought
to a sense of the hopelessness of the struggle, and urges on
officers the necessity for renewed vigorous operations.</p>

<p>As far as purely military operations are concerned, Lord
Kitchener's principles seem sound enough. Unfortunately, the Boer
has the unhappy knack of nullifying rules laid down to meet
special tactics by adopting others. At the beginning of the war
we discovered that the enemy fought from the tops of convenient
kopjes. Elandslaagte, Glencoe, Belmont, and Graspan were fought
so, but by the time we had adjusted our methods of fighting to
meet this system, the Boers had learnt that a trench at the base
is worth two on the summit, and Magersfontein was the result.</p>

<p>Similarly, as I pointed out in a letter dealing with
Kitchener, the General, there came a time when we grasped the
momentous fact that a Boer, like any other human creature, could
not live without eating, that his horse needed forage, as he
needed flour. Consequently, borne on the top of these facts, came
the amazing discovery that the Boer could not ride if he had no
horse, that if he could not ride he would be forced to walk, and
if he had to walk we could catch him. Thus we reasoned
profoundly; and, acting on that reasoning, we made a systematic
attempt to denude the country of food, forage, and horseflesh.
This, as I pointed out at the time, was a very admirable action
on out part; and if theory played as great a part in the war of
war-time as it does in the war of peace-time, then,
theoretically, by now the Boer should be either a walking
skeleton or a streak of starvation riding a bag of bones.</p>

<p>But he isn't. He is a healthy-looking animal, somewhat dirty,
who gallops over the veldt on the nag he lifted from the cavalry
lines. He wears a warm khaki coat that he looted from the last
train that was captured; he has a watch and chain which came from
the same source, and when he gazes at the enamelled dial it is
not so much to count the minutes he can longer hold out without
dying of exhaustion. His greatest admirer must admit that the
Boer is not so much a soldier nowadays as a brigand. He does not
want to fight, he wants to loot, for the Boer ambition to-day
comprehends less a vision of dying for independence than keeping
alive and comfortable until the end of the war. Not very heroic
certainly, but if the conduct of these men is to be sneered at,
the expenditure of the millions weekly that this line of action
makes necessary is not.</p>

<p>I presume that both the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal
have been cleared both of foodstuffs and horseflesh, and as far
as we are concerned&mdash; that is, as far as our part of the
contract goes&mdash;we have done well, only the Boer does not
fulfil his part&mdash;he won't starve. It was felt, and I must
confess to being one of the sanguine, that what with the erection
of blockhouses along the railway and the making bare of the
country, the plight of the Boer would become well-nigh hopeless.
The long, winding ox-waggon convoy, with its corporal's guard,
had ceased to be the Boer Whiteley.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Whiteley</i>&mdash;an allusion to
London's first department store. ]</p>

<p>There was no more chance of a Boer commando pouncing down on
sufficient food to keep an army for a month, and enough warm
clothing to last it for a year. A well-watched railway line, with
strong blockhouses at every thousand yards, was to restore and
maintain an unhindered communication between the coast ports and
headquarters, and the day of the rushed convoy was to be a thing
of the past. And yet what do we find?</p>

<p>Within the past two weeks a train has been wrecked and looted
under the very nose of a blockhouse on the Johannesburg-
Klerksdorp line, its escort killed or wounded, and those who were
neither killed nor wounded were stripped and sent naked into the
nearest village. Within a few days the Boers have descended on
Roodepoort, a small station a few miles from Johannesburg, and
have driven off cattle; while northward on the Petersburg-
Pretoria line a train has been wrecked and looted, and that in a
country in which it has been officially stated "guerrilla warfare
has been effectually stamped out."</p>

<p>Nor, seemingly, does the Boer depend entirely upon the wrecked
train for his foodstuffs. There is always the "captured" cattle.
I venture to say that if the numbers of captured stock, both oxen
and sheep, were totalled and compared with State returns, it
would be discovered that since the outbreak of war we have
captured three times us much stock as ever was in the three
colonies. The reason is not far to seek. We cannot spare the
rolling stock to carry our captures into headquarters, nor can a
general or officer commanding a column afford to send a large
escort with captured stock. The consequence is that thousands of
oxen and sheep are driven by road into the nearest garrison, with
half-a-dozen men to guard them. It is not to be wondered at that
much of our loot never reaches its destination, and even while
official wires are being published in London that General Such-a-
one has made a splendid haul of 10,000 sheep, half the captures
are back again in the Boer lines.</p>

<p>I have not referred in this letter to the derailment of a
passenger train in the Orange River Colony, or the capture of
another train on the Middelburg line, or the disaster to a patrol
near Vereeniging whereby De Wet inflicted a loss of fifteen
killed and wounded and captured a gun, or the disaster the other
week to the Victorians when the enemy cut up our men and captured
two pom-poms, or the surprising fact that the Boers have now got
guns from somewhere. These are all unpleasant truths, and all
seem to point to the continuance of the war for another year.</p>

<p>There is, however, one bright spot in the general gloom, one
pleasant prospect that perhaps compensates for the surrounding
dreariness. The Boer refugees, who are waxing fat in the camps
along the line, have declared themselves perfectly satisfied with
the treatment they are receiving.</p>

<h2><a id="art32" name="art32">THE KING AND HIS ARMY</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), October 7,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">WANTED&mdash;A NEW ORDER</p>

<p>The other day I met a young staff officer with such a stretch
of rainbow-coloured ribbons across his left breast that when he
gets his South African medal and his colonial star, and the
C.M.G., to which, as a staff officer he is almost entitled, he
will have to start afresh on another tier.</p>

<p>He had ribbons representing five decorations, but alas! for
the hero worshipper, who would place him on a pedestal on the
strength of his medals, they represented but one fight, which is
known as the Battle of Omdurman. There was the blue and white
Jubilee ribbon, the crimson and blue Distinguished Service Order,
the green and red-fringed Medjidie,* and the two ribbons for the
Imperial and, Khedival decorations. Five ribbons, or say four for
one fight. How many fights will the regimental officer, the
average hard-working, foot slogging, saddle-raw regimental
officer, see and engage in for his one ribbon?</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Medjidie</i>&mdash;The Order of
Medjidie; instituted in 1851, the Order was awarded in five
classes, with the First Class being the highest. The Order was
issued in considerable numbers by Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid I as a
reward for distinguished service to members of the British Army
and the Royal Navy and the French Army who came to the aid of the
Ottoman Empire during the Crimean War against Russia.
<i>Wikipedia</i>.]</p>

<p>We have had a list of honours, and another has been promised,
and it will be interesting to note how the rank and file of the
officers&mdash;if the bull is permissible&mdash; will fare in the
distribution, and what share they will take of the enamelled
crosses and the many-pointed stars.</p>

<p>Were this France engaged in subduing the Boer army, and had
she through the dogged persistence and magnificent courage of her
line officers succeeded so satisfactorily, there can be little
doubt that every officer in the Army would become <i>ex
officio</i> a knight of the Legion of Honour, for France would
argue rather wisely that the bestowal of a decoration is easier,
more gratifying, and cheaper than a brevet which gives a few
years' seniority and in six months loses its significance. Not
that there has been any overwhelming number of brevets given to
the lower regimental ranks, but it does seem as though that sound
business institution, the War Office, takes a most commercial
view of things, and considers that a step in rank, which means an
extra few shillings a day, was the most desirable of rewards.</p>

<p class="cp">NEGLECTED LINESMEN</p>

<p>The regimental officer hitherto has not expected much. Reward
or kudos were not for him. His commanding officer, who has had
two brevets, a C.B., and the thanks of Parliament for teaching a
West African corps which end of a rifle the bang comes from,
tells him that duty well done brings its own reward, and the
subaltern, remembering the colonel's levies, who bolted the first
and last time they were in action, wonders if it does.</p>

<p>And so the regimental officer goes into action, and all the
time the bullets are chipping up the face of the earth around him
he is teaching has men to take cover and telling them what they
never knew before, that they are there to kill and not to be
killed. If the isn't killed, he attacks a kopje the next day, and
every Boer marksman within a thousand yards will do his level
best to give that officer's junior his promotion. When he gets
back to camp that night, tired and hungry and bewildered that he
is still alive, he will pass a young gentleman with red tabs on
the collar of his khaki coat. He will be squatting on the ground
writing out the general's despatch. In six months' time, when the
honours are out, the lean, wiry, yellow regimental officer, who
by this time will be sitting on top of a kopje at Forsakenfontein
with his company, some gunners, and a 4.7, will be forgotten, but
the young gentleman with the red tabs will get his D.S.O.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* D.S.O.&mdash;Distinguished Service Order.
]</p>

<p>"My able and brilliant Staff Officer, who carried out his
duties to my entire satisfaction," will be rewarded, but "an
officer whose name I have been, unable to ascertain" will be
sitting tight on his kopje, wishing his wife was on nodding terms
with an Adjutant-General.</p>

<p>I am contrasting these two cases with the desire of pointing a
moral rather than with any wish to suggest that the Staff Officer
does not earn his decoration. Marker, of the Coldstreamers, was
one of the smartest Staff Officers I have met, and by that I mean
that he was a brilliant theorist. But has smartness did not stop
at theory, for he was the officer who with three or four men
charged De Wet's guns when they were pointed directly at him and
the gunners were fumbling at the breech. And there are, of
course, many Staff Officers who, during the present campaign,
have done excellent work as regimental officers&mdash; though
whether their services would have gained recognition had they
remained in that capacity is problematical.</p>

<p class="cp">STICKING TO THE REGIMENT</p>

<p>In the Army it is understood that there is no chance for an
officer who is contented to identify himself with the ruck of the
regiment, who makes up his mind that he will stick to his
battalion and take his promotion as it falls due. If he has
patience he will retire with the rank of colonel, while the man
who passed out with him at Sandhurst, and who was seconded as a
lieutenant to the Gippy Army, will be deciding between accepting
a seat in the Cabinet and taking command of the forces in
Ireland.</p>

<p>Soldiering is not a profession that pays. Actual soldiering I
mean&mdash;parade, route march, and Ash Range soldiering, that
calls you from your bed at dawn and sends you round outlying
posts after midnight. It doesn't pay you to shine, it doesn't pay
you to excel, and it is certainly not profitable to attempt to
initiate reform or novelty into a regiment which has a colonel, a
second-in-command, two senior majors, and an adjutant. And in
consequence the regimental officer who has any snap or influence
or ambition takes the first opportunity of handing over his
company or squadron to a duller, patronless, or unambitious man,
and wires to his tailor for a Staff cap and an aiguillette, and
thus armed wins rank and distinction, stringing after his name in
succession A.D.C., D.A.A.G., and C.S.O.</p>

<p>Now I think you will agree with me that this is not a
satisfactory state of affairs. Qualifying for the command of real
human men, with hearts over their stomachs, requires something
more than, the ability to do the amiable at a General's dinner
party, or a book knowledge of procedure. You cannot become a
leader of men by being a reader of books, any more than the
contents of a dozen works on anatomy will qualify for a surgeon
the student who has never used a knife. But, on the other hand,
you will not induce men to to stay in regiments by passing them
over and ignoring their claims to recognition.</p>

<p>What claims can a man have to distinction who has never
fought? you ask; and I would answer that a dozen years' or twenty
years' devotion to a regiment should certainly qualify as much
for the King's honour as a six-weeks' campaign and a twenty
minutes' battle.</p>

<p class="cp">AN EDWARDIAN ORDER</p>

<p>But it is not those that have plodded without fighting that I
wish to particularise, but rather those who have plodded, fought,
and will fall back to the old regulation pace after the war is
over, without recognition, without thanks, and with nought to
mark their heroic sacrifices but the same medal and the same
ribbon that the Militiamen on the Channel Islands will wear.
Surely the case of the company leader and the junior officer is
one that calls for substantial recognition. A brevet thrown here
and there to be scrambled for does not meet the need, and the
award of the Distinguished Service Order will not be made
general&mdash;four to a regiment, I believe, is to be the
proportion.</p>

<p>Only one decoration is fitting for the officer who, at the
risk of life, leads his men forward under a heavy fire, and that
is the Victoria Cross; but as the V.C. has deteriorated into
something of a Royal Humane Medal, and is seldom awarded except
for saving life&mdash;queerest of all paradoxes!&mdash;the
occasion seems to call for a new decoration.</p>

<p>It may be urged that a decoration which was generally bestowed
would not be a distinction, and that the instances of heroism and
the number of officers entitled to the decoration are so many
that such awards would lose their value. But valour is not market
produce. It does not fluctuate in value in ratio to the output.
If five hundred men earned the Victoria Cross, five hundred men
would get it; it would not make the distinction less splendid,
hut rather glorify the nation that bestowed it, raising the
average of national gallantry. There will never be a better
opportunity for the institution of a new military order than the
present; and no military order would be as popular as one created
by, and in some way associated with the same of his Majesty King
Edward VII.</p>

<p>The King's popularity in the Army is a very real thing, and
the reason is not far to seek, since his Majesty possesses all
those qualities so dear to the heart of the officer. Apart from
has high office, which commands the loyalty and respect of his
subjects, King Edward is the good comrade and the good sportsman,
which combination represents the soldiers' idea of the premier
qualities of mankind. The creation of an Edwardian Order would be
more than popular. Not only because it would serve to meet the
cases that do not come within the scope of the V.C. and D.S.0.,
but because it would owe its institution to the grace, and be
identified with the name, of one whom the Army is honoured to
call King and Comrade.</p>

LORD KITCHENER'S PROCLAMATION</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), October 21,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">SOME COMMENTS</p>

<p class="cp">MIDDELBURG, August 10, 1901</p>

<p class="quote">Now, therefore, I, Kitchener of Khartoum, etc.,
under instructions from his Majesty's Government, proclaim and
make known as follows:</p>

<p class="quote">&mdash;All commandants, field-cornets, and
leaders of armed bands, being burghers of the late Republics,
still engaged in resisting his Majesty's forces, whether in the
Orange River Colony or Transvaal, or in any other portion of his
Majesty's South African dominions, and all members of the
Governments of the late Orange Free State and the late South
African Republic, shall, unless they surrender before Sept. 15
next, be permanently banished from South Africa. The cost of
maintenance of families of all burghers in the field who shall
not have surrendered by Sept. 15 shall be recoverable from such
burghers, and shall be a charge upon their property, movable and,
immovable, in the two colonies.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>Yes, there can be no doubt at all about it, the new
proclamation has been very favorably received. South Africa has
welcomed this exhibition of firmness on the part of the Imperial
Government, and the welcome has been all the more warm because
the people out here were beginning to despair of witnessing
anything approaching strength introduced into the policy of the
Home Government.</p>

<p>Personally, I am not particularly elated, because I do not
believe that it will bring about the surrender of one single
commandant of importance; but if this new proclamation has
excited any feeling at all within me, it is a feeling of intense
curiosity, for I am curious to see what proclamation ex-President
Steyn will issue as a counterblast.</p>

<p>When we have finished issuing
proclamations&mdash;proclamations that warn, proclamations that
entreat, proclamations that cajole, proclamations that
threaten&mdash;and when we have thoroughly realised the futility
of issuing the "whereas and therefore," and have been convinced
of the disadvantages of legal phraseology as compared with
military activity, perhaps we shall take down, from our walls
that charming motto, "The pen is mightier than the sword," and
endeavor to bring about the conclusion of the war by giving our
enemy a severe beating.</p>

<p>I do not think that it will be a very difficult matter to
sketch out the gist of Steyn's proclamation. It will dwell mostly
on the "barbarity" of Lord Kitchener's proclamation: will contain
divers well-meaning passages relative to his belief in the power
of right over might; will be sprinkled with platitudinous matter;
and will wind up with an invocation to Divine Justice.</p>

<p>It seems strange enough to you living in England, but after
all it is no stranger than the grotesque uses that Cromwell's
Ironsides made of the Name, and although the Boer leaders do not
call themselves Fear-the-Lord Botha or Walk-in-the-light
Steyn&mdash; and 1 do not wish to be flippant&mdash;yet I
personally have no doubt that these men are as genuine and
sincere in their belief in the special protection of Providence
as are the best of Calvinists. This is the proclamation Steyn or
Botha will issue, and September 16 will come and go, and Botha,
De la Rey, De Wet, Beyers, Kruitzinger, Hertzog, Steyn, Uys,
Kemp, and the other leaders will yet be in the field.</p>

<p class="cp">THE POWER OF TERRORISM</p>

<p>Now, what is the object of the proclamation? I suppose, to be
brutally frank, it is to terrorise the Boer commandants into
immediate submission You may take exception to that definition,
you good, loyal Britons, who want to wage war nicely. You may
protest vigorously that your motive, or the motive of the
Government, is of the very kindest. Dear, loyal Briton! Do you
not know that kindness only comes into a warlike policy as
pitiful weakness thinly disguised?</p>

<p>I must confess I have a profound contempt for people who
sanction the killing of men and then hold up their hands in
horror if we depart from killing him and only burn his farm, or
cease from slaying him for the moment in order to frighten him.
One of these days, dear friend, you will be dead, and if you have
sense enough to realise it you will be perfectly convinced as you
lie a-dying that you would very much rather that somebody burnt
your house or threatened to kick you out of the country than that
you should shuffle off this mortal coil. So I say, without
blushing for my country&mdash;and I will here add (in
parentheses) that throughout the whole of this campaign I have
never witnessed one act of my countrymen of which I have been
ashamed&mdash;that we are trying to terrorise the Boer
commandants into immediate submission, and if there was any
likelihood of our bringing about the desired results, I should
say that it was a very good move on the part of the Imperial
Government.</p>

<p>But I think there is very little chance of this. The fact is
the proclamation is not strong enough; indeed, it shows a decided
weakening on the original policy of the Home Government, since I
take it that those commandants and leaders of armed bands who
surrender before September 15 will be allowed to remain in South
Africa in terms of this proclamation&mdash;which was certainly
not the intention of the Government a year ago. But, waiving all
this, the wording of the new proclamation may, and will be,
construed into a threat, and the question is, "Is this threat
strong enough to pull up the Boer chiefs and make them realise
the hopelessness of the struggle,
and&mdash;incidentally&mdash;the great inconvenience a
prolongation of the struggle will entail upon themselves?" And I
say No.</p>

<p class="cp">PROFITABLE FIGHTING</p>

<p>The threat amounts to very little. As far as the greater men
are concerned&mdash;the leaders with their well-feathered nests,
the young commandants who have no desire to remain in a conquered
country, and who have a call upon the treasury, of which Dr Leyds
is custodian&mdash;to men like Steyn and De Wet this proclamation
means nothing. To be effective the penalties will have to be
greater; and I can only suppose that the Government has yet
another proclamation to come into force some time after
September. 15, which will arrange for the confiscation of
property of such commandants, field-cornets, and leaders of
armed; bands as do not surrender by a certain date.</p>

<p>I have a sneaking regard for Brother Boer, which may surprise
those elegant journalists who flung mud at me for saying that
"Boers murder wounded men." I have no desire to "vilify a brave
foe," but if speaking the truth is vilification then I may let it
go at that. I have a sneaking regard for his astuteness, just as
I admire the ferocity of the Fuzzy or the guile of the Matabele
or the austerity of the Afridi. I am aware that in criticising
this proclamation I may be doing a very unpopular thing, but if
what I say does not quite please you, will you believe me when I
say that I am trying to speak what I believe to be the
truth?&mdash;just the solid, unofficial truth.</p>

<h2><a id="art34" name="art34">
THE TREACHERY OF BOER WOMEN</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Southland Times</i> (New Zealand), October 16, 1901</h3>

<p>There have been many occasions since the war started (says
Edgar Wallace in the <i>Daily Mail</i>, writing from
Johannesburg) when I have wished most earnestly that the friends
of emancipated womanhood had had their way, and that the exact
status of woman had been made equal to that of man.</p>

<p>I have often wished her all the rights and privileges of her
opposite fellow. The right to wear his clothes, and adopt his
freedoms, to earn money, smoke cut cavendish, and wear a ring on
her little finger. Also to share man trials and hardships and
responsibilities. To lead men into action, to be always eligible
for the Victoria Cross, to be honoured for her
gallantry&mdash;and shot for her treachery.</p>

<p>Especially shot for her treachery.</p>

<p>I wonder how many graves Boer women have filled this past year
or so? How many brave fellows have given up their lives through a
woman's treachery?</p>

<p>Women have played a great part in this war, not so much the
part of heroine as spy. Not so much in the way of fighting in the
trenches as luring the unsuspecting to destruction. The symbol of
her patriotism is not the eagle of war, it is rather the decoy
duck.</p>

<p>There were, I believe, women fighting in the trenches against
Buller. Two of their dead were found after the fight at Pieters
Hill, but the Boer has sufficient regard for his women folk to
keep them well out of danger, and the ambition of the Boer Amazon
has found very little scope in the fighting line. Nor, I honestly
believe, has there been any organised attempt to utilise woman's
service for Boer ends, no secret service spies drawing large sums
of money from the Boer Treasury in payment for information
secured. Such women exist only in certain fertile
imaginations.</p>

<p>The women I speak of are the wives and sisters of the poorer
Boers, people who believe that the secret service fund is an
English myth and are actuated in their treachery only by their
hatred for the British, and the knowledge born of experience that
however badly a woman behaves we shall treat her with the same
courtesy and gentleness that we should employ towards her were
she our dearest friend instead of our unreasoning foe.</p>

<p>It has been one of the problems of the war, this question of
women enemies and what to do with them, and we have solved the
problem in the easiest and most gentlemanly way. We have decided
that we do not make war upon women and children, and if through
ill-nature women and children make weir on us, we loftily refuse
to take them seriously in fact, and after we have buried the
Tommies who foolishly accepted the woman's invitation to step in
and have a cap of coffee, and are shot from the window by
gentlemen friends of the hostess, we return the hospitable
invitation of the lady of the house, give her tea, and tell her
that we are awfully sorry, don't you know, but we are
confoundedly afraid she will have to be brought into camp.</p>

<p>So we take the murderess into a camp where she will be well
fed and kindly treated, and we don't burn her farm for fear Mr
Lloyd George or Mr Redmond shall ask questions in the House.</p>

<p>If I were to write down every story I have heard of Boer
women's treachery I should fill these columns, but here is a
peculiar instance.</p>

<p>Two mounted troopers were out on a patrol when they came to a
Boer farmhouse. They dismounted some distance from the house,
which apparently was deserted except by a woman, who, standing in
the stoep, beckoned the men to advance. This they did and walked
to within a few paces of the building, when the woman suddenly
disappeared from view through an open doorway,and the next moment
a volley was fired from the house.</p>

<p>Now I have cited this as peculiar, and the peculiarity is
this. Show this paragraph to your returned Yeomanry friend, or
your volunteer brother, and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
he will say, "Yes, that is perfectly true; it happened to
me&mdash; or to a friend of mine." And this he will say, not
because the story I have told is the very incident of which he is
thinking, but because this sort of thing has happened so often in
South Africa that there is no military unit now serving at the
front that has not had some such experience.</p>

<p>Very few people know that De Wet has not once, but often, owed
his wonderful escapes to the aid of women sympathisers When he
was last in the Cape Colony and we had driven him off northward
to the Orange River, the women on some of the farms in the
Hopetown district had arranged a signal whereby De Wet's hidden
scouts should be made aware of the proximity of our scouts. A
patrol of Victorians who rode up to a farmhouse was somewhat
astonished to see the good lady, who bad been taking a siesta on
the stoep, suddenly rise from her chair, and making for the door,
for apparently no other reason than to make a noise, violently
slam it twice. As she did so a horseman broke from the bushes a
few hundred yards beyond, and galloped for all be was worth. De
Wet, who was in the angle formed by the Brak and Orange Rivers,
waiting for one of the two streams to fall, moved that night
eastward, and Plumer, who was marching to intercept him, only
managed to get on to the tail of the enemy's column.</p>

<p>The arrival of a woman at a refugee camp does not mean that
her opportunities for evil-doing are ended. In the Orange River
Colony recently a plot was discovered, in which the prime movers
were women, for the rushing of the camp at night, and instances
are innumerable of the Boer women of the refugee camps having
systematically transmitted important military intelligence to the
commandoes outside.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately true, too, that the Boer women, and for
the matter of that, gentler sympathisers with the Boer cause,
have not confined their efforts to aiding the enemy practically.
The foulest of all the slanders which have been utilised to
inflame the passions of the Cape Dutch, and to excite the horror
and pity of the civilised world, have emanated from feminine
sources. Stories of murders, outrage, and suffering have
originated in the minds of women enjoying British protection and
have been glibly repeated by others who have received at our
hands all kindness and chivalrous attention.</p>

<p>In Capetown, the hub on which the whole organism of sedition
turns is a woman. In her salon are to be found England's
bitterest enemies&mdash;and here it is that propagandas are born,
new embarrassments for England are planned, and subscription-
lists for sedition-mongerers caught tripping, initiated. Here
gather the men who pull the strings, the Krugerian agents, the
subsidisers of the pro-Boer press. Here are the semi-millionaires
who inspire articles against capitalism; the ministers of
religion who weave devilish mendacities about our soldiers; the
hybrid crowd of journalists who, in varying degrees of
vituperative violence, shriek periodically for moderation. And
the woman gives them tea and inspiration.</p>

<h2><a id="art35" name="art35">THE GREAT WAR MUDDLE</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), October 22,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">MORE UNPLEASANT TRUTHS</p>

<p>It is always refreshing to turn from the dark evidences of
weakness and folly that lie around in South Africa, so that even
the careless unofficial observer may not pass them unnoticed, to
the cheery and joyous, not to say sanguine, optimism of Downing
Street.</p>

<p>Downing Street can see the end. It can work out on paper
exactly how long Boer army will hold out. I presume it does
little sums. "If 2000 burghers surrender in thirty days, how long
will it take 10,000 burghers to surrender?" and I should say the
result is eminently satisfactory and encouraging.</p>

<p>There are not wanting people in this colony who share in the
optimism of the Home Government, and these assert that by the
time General Lyttelton arrives in South Africa the war will be
practically ended, and Lord Kitchener will be justified in
handing over his command to General Lyttelton and returning
home.</p>

<p>Speaking of General Lyttelton reminds me of the fact that in
one of my recent letters I did that general an injustice. I said,
I think, that he, as general commanding the forces engaged in
cornering De Wet, was solely responsible for the failure to
capture the Boer leader. I have since learnt that these
operations were conducted from Pretoria (600 miles away!) by
wire, and that General Lyttelton was a mere figure-head without a
vestige of authority over the movements of the troops engaged. So
that for the failure to corner De Wet in February General Lord
Kitchener must accept full responsibility.</p>

<p class="cp">MERE GOVERNMENT GAZETTES</p>

<p>There is a view of the present situation in South Africa,
however, which is not a bright and a hopeful one, and is a view
which we cannot afford to ignore. This is the view of South
Africa's loyal but censored Press. The position of South Africa's
newspapers to-day is a peculiar one. Everything that red-tape and
the tyranny of the local commandant and the folly of incompetent
censors could do has been done, and the newspapers published in
Martial Law areas are little better than Government
Gazettes&mdash;opinionless advertisement sheets sprinkled with a
meagre supply of Reuter's cables.</p>

<p>If these papers wish to express an opinion they have to fight
for the privilege, and very often when it is conceded they print
their articles with the knowledge that if their outspoken
criticisms do not draw down upon their devoted heads the wrath of
the Headquarter Staff it will be remembered against them in the
future by the disloyalists of the districts in which the
newspapers flourish. Think of a Wesleyan paper, holding strong
Methodistic views, published in a Roman Catholic community, being
censored by an intolerant Mahommedan, and you have the
situation.</p>

<p>The <i>Tarka Herald</i> is a paper published in a martial law
district, and although I do not know the censor, I at least have
some idea of the district in which it circulates. This paper,
referring to the present military situation in South Africa, and
particularly in the Cape Colony, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The question for the military authorities now to consider and
to solve without delay if this: Are the means now employed likely
to bring about the desired end?... We have been led to these
remarks by the arrival in our midst of a long and heavy column,
consisting of waggons, carts, and horses innumerable carrying
large supplies of food for man and beast. 'Set a thief to catch a
thief' is a trite saying, and until we adopt the methods of the
enemy as far as their mobility is concerned we shall never
succeed in hunting these roving commandoes down and carrying them
away as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>"These weary months are a heavy expense to the country, and
ultimately to the taxpayer, who will feel the cost in a very
practical and unwelcome manner. John Bull is very long-suffering,
but he will one day begin to resent these continued appeals to
his patriotism and his pocket. It is invidious for a layman to
pass an opinion on military methods. We cannot forbear to say
that a change of plan will have to be adopted sooner or
later."</p>

<p class="cp">VIEWS LOCAL OR OTHERWISE</p>

<p>I make no apology for extracting yet again from the <i>Tarka
Herald</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We think the time has now arrived for the authorities to
carefully consider the question as to whether, with the forces
now at their command, they are in a position to successfully cope
with the difficulties of the situation. We think not. A glance at
the map shows that a considerable portion of the colony,
comprising principally the divisions of Graaff Reinet, Cradock,
Middelburg, Tarka, Somerset East, Albert and Queenstown, are more
or less overrun with marauding bands of ex-burghers and colonial
rebels. Further, that though the towns have, as a general rule,
escaped attack, again and again forays more or less successful
have been made on the farms of loyalists and wayside stores...
Time is precious, and every week as it goes by prolonging the
present state of insecurity adds very much to the sum total of
loss, direct and indirect, sustained by the community. We think
the time has certainly arrived when the military authorities
should consider very earnestly whether all that can be done to
end the war as speedily as possible is being done."</p>

<p>The writer seems to recognise that the end of the war can only
be brought about by our success in dealing with the invaders,
and, even allowing for the fact that this is the view of a man
possibly directly affected by the marauding band', there is much
in his opinion which commands acceptance.</p>

<p>The <i>East London Despatch</i> is not published in a martial
law area, and the writer of the paragraph I have subjoined cannot
be accused of having taken a local view of the situation, since
East London is almost as far removed from the scene of the
fighting as is Cape Town or Port Elizabeth:</p>

<p>"We have reached an end that is not an end, and the
intelligence received from time to time from the seat of war,
except where it is relieved by the bravery of our troops, is a
most disheartening record. Englishmen are becoming bitter in tie
contemplation of the slow movements of our forces, and the
shallow criticism of home-staying citizens and street-corner
generals bears the evidence of an exhausted patience and an
increasing asperity. We admit that it is difficult to keep the
temper continually in what is advertised to be the condition of a
common stick-phast, 'good and sweet always.' It is especially
difficult in the light of current events. The policy pursued by
the Boers is most irritating, and, to us, exasperatingly
successful. We hear of invincible combines being formed to crush
them, of extensive cordons that afford no loophole of escape, of
contracting circles that must imprison and finally destroy, but
the enemy elude them all without much strain or loss, and appear
elsewhere to inflict a severe blow upon some unsuspecting
contingent separated from the main guard."</p>

<p class="cp">OUTSPOKEN</p>

<p>Grahamstown is in a Martial Law area, and the <i>Journal</i>,
which is the oldest and soberest of all South African newspapers,
shows very little hesitancy in its criticism.</p>

<p>"We have no need to descant upon the inefficient way in which
operations have been conducted; but it is certain that grave
dissatisfaction has been caused to colonists whether on service
or at home, by the slow progress of the campaign. Great exception
is taken to the lumbered condition of the columns, which are for
ever prevented from overtaking the enemy by being encumbered with
ox-waggons, mule-waggons, and other bulky transport, whose slow
movements can be traced even by the dust, they raise twenty,
thirty, or fifty miles off by the amused Boer scouts. The angry
colonist who finds his homestead ravaged time after time by the
commandoes, whose industries are totally at a stand, and who goes
in danger of his life, is apt to designate this mode of warfare
as a picnic rather than a campaign."</p>

<p>Similarly, the <i>Daily Mail</i>'s namesake published in the
same town says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It bodes badly for the future control of the Dutch that
hitherto we have entirely failed to inspire them with salutary
fear. They deem us soft-headed, as well as softhearted. They
believe that our leaders are not shrewd enough to discover the
shortest road to the goal of complete victory and peace; or that
those leaders have not the moral courage to take the shortest
road. We have not a very high estimate of the morality of
Bismarckian politics; nor of Bonaparte's method of dealing with
his enemies. But certainly the moral scrupulousness and
humaneness of the British leaders in the present war are very
costly in money, men and even in reputation with the Boers.</p>

<p>"Every week's continuance of the war enhances the Boer
estimate of his own prowess, and renders more difficult the
pacification and durable settlement of the country."</p>

<p>The plaint from the <i>Port Elizabeth Telegraph</i> will find
an echo in many an editorial sanctum:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But we do complain of being left so absolutely in the dark
relative to all that is transpiring, and to being fed like
children on false assurances. We sometimes wonder whether the
commandants of districts are themselves aware of what is
happening in the areas over which they are placed. Only a week or
two ago a well-known commandant of one of the most important Cape
areas declared emphatically at a public meeting that, as a result
of a recent fight, his district was absolutely clear of Boers.
Almost at the moment he was making this assurance a raiding band
was wrecking a train in the very heart of his district, and
subsequent information has proved that the district is not, and
has not been for many months, clear of hostile Boers. Are we not,
in face of this, justified in protesting against the public being
fed upon information that is not reliable? The Press censor may
increase his vigilance, but be cannot prevent the general public
forming their own opinions on the conduct of the campaign."</p>

<p>There are many other extracts I should like to give had I but
the space at my command. I do not identify myself with all that
has been said regarding the conduct of the war, but I do think
that you at Home should know exactly how the Cape Colony feels
about the present situation, which has inspired so much optimism
in High Places.</p>

<h2><a id="art36" name="art36">AN ALARM AT CRADOCK</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Evening Post</i> (New Zealand), October 26, 1901</h3>

<p>The Dutch Reformed Church at Cradock (says Edgar Wallace in
the <i>Daily Mail</i>) is pretty, there is no gainsaying that. A
friend of mine has unkindly likened it to a Greek temple
surmounted by a fool's cap, but the tastes of my critical friend
are severely orthodox in the matter of architecture. It is a
pretty building of dressed stone, and its white spire freshens
the eye of the traveller approaching Cradock, and "the tourist
doesn't live there all along."</p>

<p>I seldom remain long enough in a South African town to fall
into line with the oldest inhabitants in my views on the natural
beauty of its surroundings, and I must confess that, as a rule,
the Dutch Reformed church is the very first thing that palls. It
is usually a great barn-like building as comfortless as it can
well be, and as ugly a structure as the hand of man can make
it&mdash;for the ornate enters not into Afrikander architecture
of any sort. Your Boer leads a drab, grey, dull sort of a life,
an existence as colourless as his summer-parched, winter-withered
veldt. If he troubles to paint his house at all, he splashes it
white&mdash;a dead, dull, depressing, eye-aching white&mdash;very
much suggestive of an East-end backyard on washing day.
Remembering this you would be greatly surprised to see Cradock's
church, for, ill-tempered criticism notwithstanding, it is
pretty.</p>

<p class="cp">IN THE HOSIER'S SHOP</p>

<p>But we are learning to utilise the beautiful, and the top of
Cradock's church is sand-bagged, and the steeple of Cradock's
church is an observation post, and when the "hooter" goes flags
wag from its summit and yellow-clad men in puttees take their
stations on the roof. I did not know very much about this for
some time after I had been in Cradock. The sand-bags I noticed,
and wondered at vaguely, but I did not realise the significance,
of them all until I went shopping the other day.</p>

<p>To be exact, I went, to buy socks, for, 0 Matrons of England,
such are the emoluments of a war correspondent that he can afford
to dispense with socks that need darning. So I went a-shopping,
and even while I was meditating on the relative merits of bright
scarlet merino and a sober blue woollen article, there was a long
moan in the distance which might have been the asthmatic whistle
of a railway engine, but certainly sounded like nothing that was
exciting or thrilling or anything suggestive of the romance of
war.</p>

<p>"I think I'll take a dozen pair of these," I said, indicating
the blue. For answer, the young man behind the counter looked
remarkably fierce and commenced taking off his coat. I was
startled, not to say alarmed, and hastened to appease his wrath.
"I'm awfully sorry if I've hurt your feelings," I assured him
hurriedly. "Of course, if you've any tender associations in which
red socks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="cp">THE TRANSFORMATION SCENE</p>

<p>He looked at me for a moment, and then, groping for a moment
in a dark corner, he produced a gun. It wasn't a gun in the
military sense of the word, but really a Lee-Enfield rifle. Then
he discovered a bandolier, then a haversack. I recovered my
equanimity, and when he had got himself into a khaki jacket I
understood. He was a Town Guardsman. I walked to the door of the
shop.</p>

<p>A little further along was a hardware store, and a youth with
a gun slung over his shoulder was rapidly taking down tin buckets
which had been hanging outside, while another youth, in khaki,
bandolier, and a golf cap, was putting up, or pulling down the
shutters. I strolled across the great square and met the young
man from the chemist's and the gentleman from the bank. They were
on their way to the trenches. Further still I went, passing the
stationer's assistant, who with his rifle between his knees was
making a rapid search through his pockets endeavouring to find
his pince-nez, which he feared he had left in his other clothes.
And as his shocking language had not ceased by the time I had
turned the corner that leads to the station, I have reasons to
believe that his fears were well-founded.</p>

<p class="cp">READY FOR KRUITZINGER</p>

<p>A jaunty child struggling manfully with a rifle informed me
that Kruitzinger was "outside," and the "hooter" had sounded to
call out the Town Guard, and the Town Guard was manning the
trenches, and the Town Guard was going to hurt Kruitzinger most
severely if Kruitzinger would only come near enough, and would I
be good enough to straighten the strap of the haversack, which
had got twisted somehow, and thank you very much, old chap, and
I'll do as much for you one of these days. Then the <i>Midland
News</i> gentleman came flying along on his freewheel, and he was
in khaki with a big red cross on his arm, and later came his
stretcher-bearers, also in khaki. They looked for all the world
like real <i>dhooli wallahs</i>,* but I recognised Ram Sammy and
Lal Sammy and several other Sammies who on various occasions had
imposed on me questionable bananas and fibrous oranges. But they
carried their stretchers neatly, and lowered them as well-drilled
stretcher-bearers would do, and their waterbottles and surgical
haversacks were business-like.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>dhooli wallahs</i> (Hindi)&mdash;Indian
litter-carriers. ]</p>

<p class="cp">THE COMPOSITOR IN KHAKI</p>

<p>Then the compositor who had set up a little poem of mine so
that I mistook it for an acrostic came along resplendent in
khaki, he also bound for the trenches, where he was as prepared
to mangle the Boer as he had cheerfully mangled my manuscript.
Backwards and forwards they moved across the square. Parties of
two, of three, of four, single individuals, father and son,
employer and employee. There was no hurry, but there was much
quickness. There seemed to be little uniformity of dress, but
there was a wonderful precision and alertness about this turnout
of the shop assistants. Men walked down the street in khaki suits
and straw hats, but there was nothing ludicrous in their
appearance, but rather something fine and inspiring. Where the
trenches where I do not know; they were located somewhere on the
fringe of the township. But I did not trouble to go along and
see, for I expected no attack, having grown callous of alarms
that have been resultless. But the cheery shop assistant went
along to the trenches, and he went with a wild hope that
Kruitzinger had at least determined to try conclusions with the
Cradock Town Guard.</p>

<p>And so the roof of Cradock's pretty church was garrisoned, and
a man in khaki wagged a flag from its steeple, and sober
businessmen shut up their shops and ran a "pull-through" through
their rifles, and the man who at 9 o'clock was serving out
butter, was at 10 o'clock serving out ammunition, and the "boots"
became a bugler, and the young man from the soft goods department
developed into a very martinet of a sergeant, and ordered about
and swore at young men from the hardware department as to the
manner born. And young gentlemen who shouted "Sign!" were , now
shouting "'Shun!" For the shop assistant was a power in the land,
as Kruitzinger evidently knew&mdash;for he did not come.</p>

<h2><a id="art37" name="art37">MORAL OF GOUGH'S DEFEAT</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Poverty Bay Herald</i> (New Zealand),
November 8, 1901</h3>

<p>Major Gough, who met with a reverse at the hands of General
Botha near Utrecht on September 17, is regarded as a brilliant
officer of great dash and courage.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that it is only by taking great risks
that the military commanders here can possibly hope to bring the
war to a conclusion.</p>

<p>It is absolutely impossible to effect a reconnaissance in the
country, when pursuing a flying enemy, where the appearance of
the advanced scouts has the effect of scaring the commando
against which the movement of the main body is directed. Want of
dash and over-caution have frequently been disastrous in their
after- effects.</p>

<p>The moral effect of the Boer success is unlikely to be great,
in view of the fact proved by the capture of correspondence from
various commandants that extravagant stories of Boer victories
are manufactured weekly, beside, which this genuine success is

<p class="cp">THE ARMY THAT DOES NOT FIGHT</p>

<p class="cp">KENHARDT (Cape Colony), September 6, 1901</p>

<p>He will scarcely confess to you !he has never been under fire,
that soldier friend of yours.</p>

<p>If he has been within a hundred miles of a battle, he will
cheerfully lie to you when describing that battle. That is, if he
has never been under fire at all. If he has been out on patrol
and has been sniped at, he will not make any claims to have been
present at a big battle. He will be content to exaggerate the
importance of his "engagement," but he will not claim to have
been at Colenso or Modder River or Nooitgedacht. But if he has
not been sniped at, and has never heard "clik-clok," then if he
imperils his immortal soul he will have to claim a battle to
avoid the stigma, of "never under fire."</p>

<p>And you do not blame him, do you? How would you like to have
come six thousand miles on the troop deck of a transport, one
thousand miles in a cattle truck, and have done duty by railside
and dorp for a year or so, and then, through force of
circumstances, be compelled, were you making a truthful
confession, to admit that you had never once seen anything but a
tame Boer, and had never once been shot at? And yet such is the
case with hundreds of the troops engaged in South Africa.</p>

<p>Owing to a succession of bad luck, or the positions they have
occupied, or the duties in which they have been engaged, they
have never once been within rifle or cannon shot of the enemy,
and will be forced to make, what is to them the humiliating
confession, that they have never once been under fire, and the
medals they are getting or have got are&mdash;to modify Atkins's
expressive term&mdash; "barefaced " medals.</p>

<p class="cp">NO NEED TO FEEL ASHAMED</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, there is nothing that is really
humiliating in such a confession. There has been much duty to be
done, well out of range, and hard, wearing, tedious duty, too. Mr
Kipling has rendered an inestimable service to some of these men,
by giving just a glimpse of the monotony and tedium of that
"details guarding the line" are called upon to endure. There is a
heroism which is not of the splash-dash kind, which is none the
less admirable. A patient waiting for nothing amid great
dreariness: that is to be appreciated and to be ranked equal with
the courage that guns are captured with. A performance of duty;
monotonous routine work, unrelieved by exciting incident. A life
made up of days following one another with such a grey sameness
one to the other that yesterday is only distinguished from this
day week by the state of the weather. Bridge guard on the Karoo,
with never a Boer to pot at the blockhouse and never a stray
commando to raise wild hopes, with only the knowledge that it is
a duty which must be done by somebody, and must be done just as
well as if the bridge was on the Barberton line&mdash;this is a
performance which calls forth, or should call forth, our loudest
expressions of admiration for men of whom it is no disparagement
to say that they are "never under fire."</p>

<p>Do you know Kenhardt? The C.I.V. infantry do. It is hundreds
of miles north of De Aar, and hundreds of miles west of the
railway line. Kenhardt is a nowhere sort of place, and before the
days of the second invasion was untroubled except by occasional
visits of small rebel commandoes that were wont to halt on the
other side of the Orange River and shout defiance at Kenhardt's
small garrison. For months Kenhardt's garrison never saw a Boer
except in the <i>Illustrated Mail</i>. For months&mdash;long,
dragging months of thirty-one days&mdash;Kenhardt's garrison were
never under fire. What was war to them? What was Mafeking night
to the keepers of the Eddystone Lighthouse? It was a something a
hundred&mdash;a thousand miles removed. And yet, here they sat,
by the Orange River, pawns in the big game; faithful watchers of
Empire; right worthy to rank with the stormers of kopjes and the
chargers of positions.</p>

<p class="cp">"NON-COMBATANTS"</p>

<p>There are twenty or so stationary hospitals in South Africa,
the staffs of which have seen little more of war than its bullet-
shattered victims&mdash;though this is the real and most terrible
side of warfare. Not for them the forced march and the assault at
dawn. Not for them "the clang and the clamour and dust of death."
The enemy they have fought has been the universal foe, the
destroyer of armies&mdash; enteric.</p>

<p>Patiently and bravely the men of the R.A.M.C. have done their
work, and little enough thanks have they got out of it at. No
corps has been more vilified, no set of officers have been more
systematically cold-shouldered by the Powers That Were. No corps
has had harder work and less reward. And these men, forming the
staffs of the general hospitals, have not, except in rare
exceptional cases, where the personnel has been recruited from
brigade bearer companies and field hospitals, been anywhere near
the fighting line. "Never under fire" applies to a very large
number of the Royal Army Medical Corps, as it does to other corps
in the army.</p>

<p>The Army Service Corps is a combatant unit. Unlike the
R.A.M.C., its duty carries it into the firing-line, and when it
does get a chance to put in a shot it never passes such an
opportunity by. But the strength of the Army Service Corps is so
inadequately small, that the demands of an army of a quarter of a
million have sorely tested its resources. The dapper little
driver in blue and white has been replaced by the Kaffir boy with
a long whip. A.S.C. Companies have been split up into
infinitesimal portions. There have not been enough men to go
round the various columns, and the A.S.C. man, if he did not get
his chance of seeing fighting in the early stages of the war,
stands a very poor chance of seeing it now. I am not thinking so
much of the Transport branch as the Supply when I speak of the
A.S.C. who are never under fire&mdash;the clerks at base camps,
the issuers, the bakers, and the other good tradesmen of the
Army.</p>

<p class="cp">EAGER TO FIGHT</p>

<p>Another unit is the Ordnance Corps. This is a corps which in
ordinary circumstances sees little fighting unless it happens to
get shut up in a beleaguered town, or is sniped on its passage
from town to town.</p>

<p>The men of the Army Pay Corps, the Treasury Department of the
Army, have little opportunity of seeing fighting.</p>

<p>How heartily sick of office work and dreary routine these
technical corps are may be guessed from the enormous number of
applications there were from the ranks of the corps I have named
for transfer to the regular line. Men who occupied good positions
and were in receipt of good salaries were anxious to exchange
their non-commissioned rank in departmental corps to that of
private in marching regiments.</p>

<p>The exigencies of the service, however, forbade such
transfers, and the men have remained at their old plodding tasks,
totalling figures, taking stock of biscuits, and counting broom-
handles. I think you must agree that, in spite of the apparent
meanness of their duties, as compared with the finer and more
applauded work of their comrades of the line, there is something
in their labours that dignifies their efforts. There is always
something fine in the faithful observance of ordinary everyday
duties; in the case of the soldier who works with his hammer or
his pen when he would much rather be working with his rifle and
bayonet it is in its degree heroic.</p>

THE GLORIOUS STORY OF ITALA<br>
HOW GENERAL BOTHA WAS CHECKED</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), December 7,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">"NOT HEROES"</p>

<p class="cp">PRETORIA, October 3, 1901</p>

<p>In the district of N'Kandhla, in the northern portion of
Zululand, is Itala Mountain. Northward runs the Umyanyeni River,
dividing Vryheid from the British territory. Westward and to the
north are the famous Ingogo heights; still further west
Isandhlwana; westward again the Blood River, with Rorke's Drift
and its ancient history.</p>

<p>Itala is one of the line of fortified posts established during
the past few weeks to hold in check the commando which, under
Louis Botha, had been threatening Natal.</p>

<p>After his success on the Blood River, where he captured
Colonel Gough's force, Botha moved eastward. To force the drifts
and march on Dundee had been his plan, but Natal, which at the
beginning of his march had been almost empty of troops, was, long
before he reached striking distance, garrisoned from end to end.
Columns which had been safe and snug in the south-east corner of
the Orange River Colony; columns that had been prowling round
Cape Colony looking for rebel farmers; columns that had been
resting in unheard-of dorps on the edge of Nowhere&mdash;they
were all in Natal when Botha knocked at the gate. Sweaty and
grimy engine-drivers, contemptuous of hidden mine or twisted
rail, had driven through the night from east, from west, from
south, from north, and long, nasty-smelling troop trains threw
off their mules and men, their waggons, their ambulances, and
their stores&mdash;the Scratch Army had arrived.</p>

<p class="cp">EASTWARD</p>

<p>So Botha moved towards the rising sun, for there are other
ways of entering Natal besides well-guarded front doors.
Zululand, for instance. Raids into Zululand had been easy enough
to accomplish. Unknown commandants had from time to time moved
about leisurely and without restraint. What had been done before
might be done again, and Botha moved eastward.</p>

<p>So also did British columns, and they arrived some days ahead
of Botha. And they spread themselves out along the border line
and waited for Botha.</p>

<p>It is advisable to stop and examine with some curiosity the
composition of the force that held the position at Itala. Not
with enthusiasm nor with reverence, but just with speculative
curiosity. To enthuse on matters military is bad form; reverence
for traditions which common people vulgarly term "splendid" is
also bad form&mdash;this from a military point of view, where the
desire for proficiency on the part of a young soldier in his
profession is the worst of all varieties of bad form. So regard
Chapman's force curiously, as you Would regard a pointer or a
hunter.</p>

<p class="cp">"THE MEN THAT FOUGHT AT MINDEN"</p>

<p>Right of the line of this little army were two guns of the
Royal Field Artillery. Gunners and Drivers, you understand, of
average courage and intelligence. Ordinary Woolwich-bred, sturdy,
spur-clinking, beef-fed, soldiers. Let not Mr Alfred Austin or
any misguided maker of verse imagine they were heroes. There are
no heroes nowadays except in the classical dictionary. Heroes are
bad form. There is a song about them somewhere, and if you have
not grown blas&eacute; with much daily intercourse with brave
men, you may sing it now with some feeling. It runs "Bravo"
something or other. I have only heard it sung once, and then by
an intoxicated and weedy youth in the New Cut.</p>

<p>Then there were men of the Middlesex Regiment. They call the
Middlesex Regiment "Die Hards" or some nonsense of that sort.
They are recruited in the Mile End Road, and are chiefly peculiar
by reason of the fact that they have not sufficient intelligence
to raise a white flag when they are in a tight corner;
preferring&mdash;such are their brutal instincts&mdash;to go on
fighting till something turns up.</p>

<p>The Dorsets were there represented. They boast, brassily and
in Latin, that they were in India before any other regiment knew
the difference between "rutee" and "pawnee."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>rutee</i>, <i>pawnee</i>
(Hindi)&mdash;bread, water. ]</p>

<p>The Lancashire Fusiliers, who gave themselves airs the day
after Minden&mdash;you won't find it on the South African
map&mdash;and all because at that battle "they behaved with great
gallantry, repulsing every charge of the enemy," they were there;
most of them, I venture to affirm, absolutely ignorant of the
situation of Minden and of the fact that their regiment was over
there. And there were men of the South Lancashire Regiment also;
two-and-twenty honours have the South Lancashire, stretching from
Louisberg to New Zealand.</p>

<p class="cp">FOUR TO ONE</p>

<p>Major Chapman's little force had a good backing of tradition;
and, with a hundred battles behind them, and good, stout
breastworks in front, his men awaited the arrival of Louis Botha
on the evening of Sept. 26. Three hundred men against twelve
hundred. It was a most encouraging proportion. Britons fight
their best under such conditions. It is only when they are on
equal terms with the enemy, or slightly superior in numbers, that
Somebody regrets to state that "the ammunition ran out, and
without my orders a white flag was raised."</p>

<p>The enemy came by way of Babanango and Wonder Kraal, and soon
after midnight of Sept. 25 a little outpost garrisoned by sixty
men under Lieutenant Kane, South Lancashire Regiment, and
Lieutenant Lefroy, Dublin Fusiliers, was attacked. This post had
been established on Itala Mountain, and a desperate fight ensued
for its possession. Numbers told, and Lieutenant Kane fell
mortally wounded, shouting "No surrender!"</p>

<p class="verse">"Never give in!" he cried, and he heard them
shout,<br> And grappled with death as a man who knows no
doubt.</p>

<p>What was the fate of the men of this little outpost we do not
know. Killed, wounded, or captured, they did their duty. Hardly
had the outposts fallen than the guns of the 69th Field Battery
and the Maxim were put out of action, and the attack had to be
met with rifle fire and the bayonet.</p>

<p class="cp">THE BRAVERY OF THE BOERS</p>

<p>Let us say this of the Boers, that they fought with all
disregard to danger. That they charged again and again, exposing
themselves to our fire, reckless of consequence, determined only
to take the little post that stood between them and their object.
For nineteen hours they fought with heroic madness. They
abandoned their usual tactics. They flung themselves again and
again upon the tiny dwindling British lines, and again and again
were flung back, battered and broken and maimed. So their tale of
dead rose, even as the supply of British ammunition failed. There
could be no hope of help from the other posts. Every post for
itself. To withdraw troops from one position to assist a post at
another would mean the abandonment of the post from which the
troops were drawn, and a gap left for the Boer commandant to slip
through.</p>

<p>Indeed, even as Itala was engaged, so also was Fort Prospect,
ten miles along the Melmoth Road, and held by Captain Rowley and
twenty men. The Ermelo commando of four hundred men under
Grebelaar attacked the post at daybreak, rushing to within a few
dozen yards of the defences, and continued the attack all day. So
Itala was left to work out its own salvation, and this it did,
fighting desperately for nineteen hours, waterless and short of
ammunition, and without artillery. In the evening Botha retired
towards the river, leaving his dead for our men to bury.</p>

<p>The cable has told you the number of the Boer casualties. They
run into hundreds. It has also told you that Major Chapman has
been recommended for the Victoria Cross, and that Lord Kitchener
has expressed his opinion that every man of the force should by
rights have one. In the early days of the war&mdash;before the
war bored you&mdash;you would call the men of Chapman's force
heroes. Even now, perhaps, you have sufficient enthusiasm left to
express yourself in accord with Lord Kitchener.</p>

<h2><a id="art40" name="art40">AT A TRIAL FOR TREASON</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), December 27,
1901</h3>

<p class="cp">ONE PENALTY OF AN INDISCRETION</p>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG, Sept. 12, 1901</p>

<p>Courthouses bear a striking resemblance one to the other all
the world over. There is a dinginess and a stuffiness and an air
of aggressive respectability. And furniture polished smooth with
much usage, and the smell of ink and the rustling of papers, and
the subdued babble of whispered talk from the public's standing-
place. It might be Bow Street or Marlborough Street, or Lambeth,
with its draped canopy, the raised dais, the cumbersome dock, and
the crescent-shaped table where counsel sit.</p>

<p>Only the Bench was constituted differently, and three officers
in khaki clasped a Bible and swore that they would well and truly
try the prisoner before the Court according to the evidence, and
that they would duly administer justice according to the Army Act
then in force, without partiality, favour or affection, and they
did further swear that they would not divulge the sentence of the
Court until it was duly confirmed, and that they would on no
account at any time whatsoever, disclose or discover the vote or
opinion of any particular member of the Court unless thereunto
required in due course of law, so help them God.</p>

<p class="cp">A PICTURE OF BROEKSMA</p>

<p>And the prisoner before the Court, haggard and wretched-
looking, stood between the file of stolid soldiers&mdash;little,
firm-knit men with fixed bayonets&mdash;and looked neither to
left nor right, but only groundwards, and later, when he was
allowed to sit in the well of the Court, he crossed his legs and
looked at his knee, and so he sat throughout the trial.</p>

<p>A hard-faced man, an intolerant, purposeful schemer&mdash;and
a fool. A man who devised methods of passing treasonable
correspondence through and past a dozen censors&mdash;yet was so
ill-witted as to keep copies of incriminating letters in his
house. Cunning enough in his way&mdash;the pamphlets he had
printed under his personal supervision, bore the imprint,
"Printed on the field-press of the Z.A.R." Yet his
printer&mdash;a Hollander youth who became a burgher for fifty
shillings, as he told the Court&mdash;gave him away in the very
innocence of his heart. Broeksma brought him the little book. It
was addressed to "all true Afrikanders," and was dedicated to
Louis Botha, and to Christian De Wet, and to all commandants,
veldt-cornets and fighting burghers&mdash;a sufficiently
comprehensive dedication.</p>

<p>They read this little book aloud in open Court. It was rather
a tedious task, but it was managed very well by relays of
officers, and, as Francis Davies read it, it read very well
indeed. The writer started with an apology for the fact that he
had taken the oath of neutrality, and endeavoured to explain away
his peculiar position. He quoted extensively from a book by "an
English officer"&mdash;apparently "English officers" and such of
their opinions as coincide with pro-Boer writers are no
inconsiderable factors in the arguments of our enemies; and this
book was all about the American War of Independence&mdash;which
was, I believe, a regrettable occurrence that happened long
before the Fourth of July Hotel Cecil dinners were
inaugurated.</p>

<p class="cp">WITHIN REACH OF THE GUNS</p>

<p>It told&mdash;this pamphlet&mdash;of parallel instances of the
American war with those of the Boer war. Of ill-clad, half-
starved American burghers fighting for their country. It told of
one Arnold, who went over to the English ranks, and it likened
him to Piet de Wet, and the surrendered Boers who are striving in
the interests of peace. It contained references to nameless
atrocities committed by British droops on Boer women and
children, of murders and outrages perpetrated by our men. It
suggested punishment for burghers who surrender and work for
peace, including the novel suggestion that they should be buried
alive.</p>

<p>Altogether, it was a poisonous little book. Not, be it known,
that it was any worse stuff than one sees printed in English and
Irish papers of a certain class. Many of the sentiments contained
in the pamphlet that was read in court, while the prisoner
studied his knee and flushed and paled alternately, were very
much like the matter I have read in European papers, but they
have said their say with impunity; they have been&mdash;let me
use a notable phrase&mdash;"intriguing beyond reach of the guns."
But here in Johannesburg there is a law that sends to their
deaths such men as try to encompass the destruction of our
soldiers by skillfully-worded encouragement held out to the
enemy. The words treachery and treason have a meaning here. It is
no newspaper term, and the educated men who for their own ends
and purposes, not only cause suffering to our own troops, but
misery to the poor ignorant fools whom they induced to rebel
against the authority of the Crown&mdash;for these men there is a
law, swift and sure and awful.</p>

<p>There were letters, too, that Broeksma wrote. Letters to
President Kruger, "at present on leave in Europe," to Mrs Steyn
at Bloemfontein, a letter which would have been innocent enough,
containing as it did a request that the lady and the President
should stand sponsor to a newly-arrived "burgheress," had the
writer not seized the opportunity of launching forth upon a flood
of verbal unpleasantnesses regarding Great Britain and her
methods. Then letters conveying stories of reverses and news of
the commandoes, and pathetic requests to "Dr L." for money to
carry on the work. And letters conveying messages from the
relatives of the fighting commandants to their friends in the
field. Then more letters with acknowledgment of cuttings from the
<i>Daily News</i> and requests that other "respectable" papers
should be sent to the writer wrapped up "Jingo papers."</p>

<p class="cp">THROUGH THE POST?</p>

<p>But how did the foe within get news from the foe without? How
is it that these letters were able to pass our censors? There are
rights which are respected by all civilised nations, and these
are the sacred rights of Foreign Ambassadors and Consuls. We do
not molest or touch the correspondence of any foreign Consul. The
contents of the consulate mailbags are held by us as sacred, and
above suspicion. And by some means or other, this correspondence
between the intriguers at Home and the Boers in the field has
been carried on by means and through the medium of the Consul for
the United States of America in Johannesburg, and the Consul for
the United States of America at the Hague. In whatever way these
gentlemen have been deceived, and to what extent they have bee a
utilised as tools, it is not for me to judge.</p>

<p>Further, I know that for some time past the Foreign Office
have been aware of the fact that some such thing was going on. It
was known that such correspondence was passing under cover of the
all-powerful sub-address "Care of the American Consul,
Johannesburg." It was Broeksma's indiscretion that he should
leave copies of his letters about in his house. Dr. Williamson,
at the Hague, with whom the prisoner corresponded, Mr Kruger, at
Hilversum, and others in London, will regret the publicity given
to what was intended as private correspondence.</p>

<p>As to Broeksma, by the time this appears in print he will have
paid the penalty for his treachery&mdash;and his
indiscretion.</p>

<h2><a id="art41"
name="art41">WHAT DOES THE END MEAN?</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Hawera &amp; Normanby Star</i> (New
Zealand), December 28, 1901</h3>

<p>Edgar Wallace, writing in the <i>Daily Mail</i>,
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>What does the phrase "the end of the war" mean to you?</p>

<p>It means one or more of three things. It signifies in your
mind, either (1) The date on which the legalised killing of men
will cease in South Africa; (2) The date on which some one who is
near and dear to you will be released from military service in
South Africa; or (3) The date on which it ceases to be necessary
to devote the funds of the nation to the up-keep of an army in
the field other than the garrisons usually employed under
ordinary peace conditions.</p>

<p>And this is my estimate of the periods intervening between the
present date and the three "ends" of the war:&mdash; (l) Nine
months the "fighting end." (2) Fourteen months the "military
end." (3) Two years the "financial end."</p>

<p>In making this estimate I know that I err on the side of
optimism. Send us out men by all means, and horses for Heaven's
sake, and spend as much money as you like, only be patient as you
have always been. Don't expect any quick result. If we out here
know that you are prepared to wait grimly for a year or two,
we&mdash;we generals and brigadiers and column
commanders&mdash;we shall not get flurried or worried, or lose
our heads. Be patient&mdash;that is the best way you can
help.</p>

PRO PATRIA&mdash;THE EMPIRE BUILDER</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), January 9,
1902</h3>

<p class="cp">A SOUTH AFRICAN SKETCH</p>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG, September 27, 1901</p>

<p>The veldt is young and green from the new rains. The sun has
just topped the horizon, and the world is a golden world; a
glorious, glittering, laughing world full of sparkle and colour
and warm lights. My horse is fresh and the veldt is easy going.
My pipe is an old pipe, and the tobacco has just arrived from
England, and it is the only tobacco in the world worth
smoking.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful world I am living in; the keen morning air
tingles the tips of my ears and fills any nostrils with
exhilarating coldness. It is a morning to think on the blessings
of life, and the particular blessing that I think of this
morning, as I touch my hat to the blockhouse guard and canter
into the eye of the sun, is Empire. It is such a good thing on a
morning like this to be a Briton. It is the sort of thought that
does not strike one very often. The bond that binds you to the
millions of the red maps is not always apparent. Home: there are
obvious bonds to that; kin; a penny stamp on a dirty envelope,
and it's hands across the sea!</p>

<p class="cp">NEVER QUESTIONED</p>

<p>"Dear Brother John" is a John Smith, auctioneer and appraiser.
An excellent gentleman or a mean thief, according to the manner
he has treated you in the past. It is not to an Englishman you
are writing; that fact is too apparent to appreciate. You are
writing to John Smith, the brother, and if you were questioned as
to his nationality, you would answer, with a lift of your
eyebrows, "Why, British, of course," wondering in your mind; why
such an absurd question should ever be asked, yet never before
having given the matter a moment's thought. That everybody
connected or associate with you is British, and that to be
British is something to be proud of, you accept as a matter of
course, without for one moment reflecting on what Britain's
greatness is built.</p>

<p>You accept the statement that Britain is great in about the
same manner that you accept the theory that the world is round,
without any more misgivings that our power could slip from us
than you have that this old globe would become of its own will
cubiform. Some hundreds of years ago, somebody or other smashed
up a Spanish fleet and gave England power over the sea. It was in
the English Channel or at Flores, in the Azores, or somewhere,
Oliver Cromwell beat the Dutch; or it may have been Queen Anne
beat the French. Then there was Trafalgar and Lord Nelson. This
you won't forget, because there are so many public-houses named
after that great man. And there was Waterloo. You do not know
much about Vimiera, or Talavera, or Bu&ccedil;aco, or Fuentes
d'Onor, or Ciudad Rodrigo&mdash;(a meerkat slips out of a hole
and glides across my path at this point of thought and sets my
horse a-bucking and a-swerving; the sun is getting higher; veldt
and kopje and distant ridge take new shapes in the strong, young
light, and the blockhouses are behind and out of sight)&mdash;and
you have never heard much about Vittoria, or Salamanca, or
Orthes, or Ava, because these names are difficult to remember.
Well, we won these battles, or lost them creditably, and England
became great and, of course, being great, cannot be less.</p>

<p>Our might is the might of the history book, and we do not
trouble to read Blue Books and Consular reports to correct our
opinions or realise that what we have gained by the sword we may
lose to the Mauser; that the power which Drake's red-hot
culverins built for us, the apathy of Blank, Dash, and Co., or
the rates of the Half Moon Steamship Company may piffle away.</p>

<p class="cp">DREAM PICTURES OF EMPIRE</p>

<p>So this morning being fair and inspiring, and the land being
good to look upon, and my tobacco being particularly fragrant,
and the motion of my horse remarkably easy, I think pleasantly on
Empire. Of the Drakes and the Marlboroughs, of the Effinghams and
Raleighs, and Benbows and Nelsons, and the Empire-makers working
blindly to ends they were fated never to behold. And of matters
making for Empire to-day. Of a great people ignorant of its
latent strength and fretful of its palpable weaknesses. Of hosts
that come from the four corners of the earth; of great steamers
bearing commerce under the red ensign; of millions on millions
flung with a lavish hand; of illimitable treasures; of a thousand
cities, some sweltering beneath a tropical sky, some lazing by
Southern seas, some ice-bound by frozen rivers, some harried by
typhoon, some buried by snowstorms. It is pleasant, this dream of
Empire. It is comforting, this dream of Empire. It is comforting,
this thought of great men and cities rising to Britain's need to
throw treasure and province and people into the common fund. It
is...</p>

<p>Hallo, what, is this?</p>

<p>The horse will be glad of a rest, so I dismount and loosen his
girths, and knee-halter him securely, to see what attracted my
attention. It is a little cairn. There are not many loose
boulders in the vicinity, and very few stones, and the material
for the cairn must have been brought with some pains from a
distance by those who made it. Dull, red stones they-are, and
have been long enough in their present position to allow a little
green creeping weed to throw one slender tendril up one side of
the mound and half-way down the other. And there are some wild
flowers, too, growing among the stones. Green slips tipped with
tiny white flowers. Shoots of maize already a foot high, and
swaying to every vagary of the soft winds.</p>

<p>Somebody's grave.</p>

<p>And two pieces of biscuit box have been nailed together to
form a cross, on which the maker has evidently started to carve
the name, but, being pressed for time or the rude tool failing,
finished off the inscription with black lead pencil.</p>

<p class="cp">"FOR KING AND COUNTRY"</p>

<p>"Pte. J.L&mdash;&mdash;" Rain and dust have obliterated the
hastily-written pencilled letters; but on the lower part of the
upright, and protected from the elements by a larger stone,
evidently placed to give stability to the symbol, is written in
pencil, "for king And countery."</p>

<p>So Pte. J.L &mdash;&mdash;, whoever he was, has died for King
and Country. Did he know it, I wonder, and did the writer of the
epitaph realise at all the significance of the inscription?
Perhaps he didn't. It may have been a line from some music-hall
ballad&mdash;such a one as may be heard at any hall being
addressed to the sentimental artisan. A trite little phrase, but
perfectly descriptive of the passing of him beneath the hastily
gathered stones. Hackneyed, heroic and threadbare pathos, tawdry
from long dwelling amid tinsel and grease paint, smelling of the
very orange-peel at the pit-door, but raised to its proper
dignity by fitting application.</p>

<p>So, here you are, and this is the end of all things, Private
J.L&mdash;&mdash;, whosoever you were, yokel or cockney sharp,
ne'er-do-well or gentleman. This is not the end you
pictured&mdash;if, indeed, your mind ever ran on the Great
Finality.</p>

<p>Poor tool, broken in the fashioning of Empire, and laid aside
for ever. Do the great ones of earth, who shall go down to
posterity as Empire-makers, who shall shine in the pages of
history because of this work you have done&mdash;do these know
your work, divine your worth, and place you at your true
valuation? I wonder, as I replace the stone and force upright the
drooping cross, how many lines of history you deserve, you poor
unit, who died for King and Country. How many hearts lie buried
here, broken and crushed and mangled for King and Country? I know
how you died, uncomplaining, undoubting the wisdom of God, half
wondering, perhaps, why no presentiment of death had come to you,
and strangely curious through all. I have seen your like, and the
death they died.</p>

<p>I could not wish you a resting-place more fitting. Nature is
silent hereabouts. God's Sanctuary, where world noises are hushed
and the circling hills are giants linked hand in hand to keep
back the crush and the fret and the hurry of life. Sleep well,
brother. There are those who will not forget who are the real
Empire-makers. I almost envy you this victorious quiet, this
splendid rest. No mausoleum of polished granite, no sculptured
stone, no graven praise, no tablet in the dim chancel. For you,
no churchyard by familiar lanes. Day breaks and night falls, and
no hoof-fall breaks the silence. The west glows and sleeps; the
east quickens and pales. Hesperus becomes Lucifer, and only the
wheeling hawk looks down upon the little red mound beneath which
lies this Private J.L&mdash;&mdash;, this maker of Empire.</p>

<h2><a id="art43" name="art43">FIGHTING IN THE MIST</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Poverty Bay Herald</i> (New Zealand),
January 21, 1902</h3>

<p>The blockhouses, which previously served purely for railway
protection, are now rapidly encircling vast tracts of country and
limiting the sphere of the operations of the commandoes thus
encircled. The advantage of this is in estimable, for the
blockhouses act as a sort of outer cordon through which there is
little possibility of the enemy breaking. Thus they prevent
communication between the commandoes and the arrival of
reinforcements from outside. The best example of this is found in
the line of blockhouses which runs from Norvals Pont to
Naauwpoort, De Aar, and Orange River, and along the river from
Norvals Pont. Thus it is evident that the commandoes now in Cape
Colony can hardly return or be reinforced from the north.</p>

<p>The size and remarkably different conditions of the country in
which operations are being conducted were manifested yesterday
week, when one column engaged the enemy near the shore of the
Atlantic and another was fighting 1,000 miles east on the borders
of Kaffirland, while 1,200 miles north Colonel Colebrander was
pursuing the enemy in the thick bush country.</p>

<p>The extraordinary conditions under which the troops fight wore
exemplified by Colonel Plumer's recent operations in the
Slangapiesberg and the Pongola bush, where both British and Boers
were hidden from one another by the thick mists peculiar to that
part of the country, in consequence of which the men often
approached within a dozen yards of the enemy, many of whom were
killed at point blank range.</p>

<p>Colonel Somerset's column was encamped high above the clouds.
The Boer snipers from the valley below were invisible, but their
shots piercing the cloud fell harmless owing to the great
elevation. In the midst of this country of large canyons a town
was discovered in which were women and children, and also shops,
wherein bootmakers, tailors, and wagonmakers were regularly
employed.</p>

<p>On every hand the columns are doing good, steady, plodding
work. I would again protest against the injustice of exaggerating
minor Boer successes and against the seeming inability of the
critics to set off against these our weekly total of captured,
none of whom were taken without fighting. The weekly summary but
inadequately conveys an idea of the progress made.</p>

<p>From January to the end of last October the following were the
Boer losses: Captured and surrendered, 15,000; killed 1,837; guns
captured 29; rifles captured 10,000.</p>

<p>That certain columns should be more useful than others is only
natural, and it is perfectly true that some columns are
considerably hampered by excess of impedimenta. Upon this
subject, however, Lord Kitchener has issued strict orders as to
the limitation of transport. It is only fair to point out that it
is hardly to be expected that men who have been two years in the
field should willingly endure the same privations and
restrictions which were unavoidable at the beginning of the
war.</p>

WAR&mdash;FROM A SALOON WINDOW</a></h2>

<p class="cp">I. &mdash; THE START</p>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), January 24,
1902</h3>

<p>This is Cape Town, and Cape Town at night. To be exact, at ten
minutes To nine at night. The grey bulk of Table Mountain is
veiled in mist and a drizzling rain drenches the long wooden
platform, on either Side of which stand the up-country trains,
which in ten and twenty minutes will be roaring northward.</p>

<p>From the street without the electric tram gong booms down the
wind, and a hundred paces northward the black waters of Table Bay
sough and gurgle along the foreshore. Blurred, flickering,
dancing, twinkling lights on the far waters&mdash;liner, tramp,
transport, collier, cattle boat, and ketch. One long white arm of
light stabbing a way through the drizzle and swinging languidly
north and south and east and west: up and down, high poised, and
searching vainly for the distant Koeberg Hills; depressed and
cutting through the dark, dead waters, a lane of living light.
This is his Majesty's Ship Something or Other using her
searchlight. Only a second or two, however, for appreciation of
the picturesque.</p>

<p class="cp">VERY MUCH LIKE HOME</p>

<p>"<i>Pas op, baas!</i>"*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Pas op, baas!</i>
(Afrikaans)&mdash;Watch your back, sir! ]</p>

<p>You jump round in time to avoid a heavily-laden trolley,
overtopping with mail bags, and trundled forward by two sweating
Kaffirs in the uniform of Cape Town's G.P.O. The mail vans are
open, and are already half filled with bulging bags. The moist
platform is crowded with passengers and their friends; porters
hurry to and fro, trucks laden with baggage collide and entangle
and generally mix up with trolleys piled with mails. A great
sack, marked "From London for the British Army, in South Africa "
slips on to the feet of a matron struggling with a bundle of
rugs, a bandbox, and a baby, and altogether it is very much like
Euston or King's Cross, with a suggestion of the departure of a
midnight "hopping excursion," only the saloons with their little,
well-lighted compartments and their dim narrow alley ways are
different, and the few natives in the third-class are
strange.</p>

<p>"By your leave, please!"</p>

<p>Uttered in that tone, the "please" sounds almost like a swear
word. Rumble, rumble, rumble, clank, clank, clank&mdash;this the
trolley or truck. Thud, thud, thud&mdash;umph! This the throbbing
dynamo in the end carriage, which sets the train a quiver.</p>

<p>"As for me," says the correspondent deprecatingly&mdash;the
disappointed correspondent who has come a thousand miles to
witness a great movement in the Malmesbury district, which has
proved something of a Great Fizzle&mdash;"As for me, one
district's as good as another. I am disappointed; I don't mind
confessing that. Pretoria to Malmesbury is a trifle over a
thousand miles, and I did expect a little excitement. What
happened? A thundering lot of horse thieves came down from Van
Ryn's Dorp to sneak horses, got a few hundred, occupied a dorp or
two, rushed an outpost or two, stole a rifle or two, and retired.
Troops were immediately on the spot, did you say? Of course they
were! See my telegraphic report when it comes out. 'Troops were
at once hurried to the scene of action, and the enemy retired,
etc.' Oh, yes, I wired all that. Many strange incidents in
connection with the invasion? Of course. Why, a colonel
commanding one of the columns operating against the enemy took
out with him two guns. What do you think he did? When he was
about a day's march out he sent the guns back to headquarters
again. Why? Oh, he said he was afraid he would lose 'em. Fact!
No, I didn't wire that, and for heaven's sake don't tell anybody;
they'll think I'm unpatriotic. Censors? Don't talk about 'em.
Why, the other day&mdash;"</p>

<p class="cp">THE PASSENGERS</p>

<p>Encourage a young father to talk about the smart sayings of
his first-born, or a suburban lady to descant on the enormities
of the latest domestic, but never draw the correspondent on the
subject of the Censorship.</p>

<p>"And tell Jack we shall be up on the Rand in a month."</p>

<p>A burly gentleman and his burly wife are seeing off another
burly gentleman and his singularly buxom better half. Both burly
gentlemen wear massive watch guards and diamond rings, and both
smoke offensively large cigars.</p>

<p>"If you see 'Arry up there," commented the large gentleman who
had spoken before, "tell 'im I'm waiting till the 'umming bird
sings&mdash;he'll know what I mean."</p>

<p>The other large gentleman and his spouse are evidently also in
the secret, as also is the speaker's wife, and the roar of
laughter that follows is worthy of all the wit in all the world,
rolled up though it be for the time into an esoteric reference to
a singing 'umming bird.</p>

<p>"My carriage, porter!"</p>

<p>He really says "portah," does the officer who, followed by a
few ladies, dodges his way down the choked platform, but that
sort of thing has been done to death, don't you think?- A
superfluous "haw" has somehow come to be regarded as a sign of
incompetence, and a monocle in the eye of an officer the cause of
disaster; so I decline to report phonetically, lest my object in
reporting at all be obscured.</p>

<p>It isn't the porter at all who responds to the officer's
appeal, but the suave, frock-coated conductor, looking for all
the world like a hall porter suddenly transported from Piccadilly
Club to the Cape Town railway station.</p>

<p>There is a seat already occupied in the compartment, and the
officer gentleman does not approve.</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;my compartment, I believe?" Good Englishman!
faithful to his national traditions, he wishes to travel his
thousand miles by his lonesome self. He objects to the presence
of another human being in the same saloon; indeed, he would be
much happier if there was no other man in the whole train. If the
truth be told the other passenger is just as wrathful at the
intrusion and objects just as strenuously. I know he does, for he
happens to be <i>me</i>.</p>

<p class="cp">INSULAR BRITON</p>

<p>I glare at him and suggest that, if he has reserved the
compartment, I shall be most happy to find another seat. He
glares at me, and remarks to his wife, who has come to the
carriage window, that the type of persons who travel first-class
in this &mdash;&mdash; country is extraordinary, and I pray for
the arrival of a friend to whom I can address as audible am aside
and as uncomplimentary. Bitter rage fills my heart, and a
profound contempt for officers of his Majesty's second line of
defence. Smarting under the injustice of his remarks, I almost
become pro-Boer. However, I don't, for previous experience has
taught me that before we are a dozen miles on our way we shall be
the best of pals, and by lunch time we shall be sharing lunch
baskets.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye. Hope, you'll have a pleasant trip, and all
that sort of thing. Sorry you haven't a nicer travelling
companion."</p>

<p>This from his wife. "Can't help that. Have to do the best I
can, I suppose. Hope you'll enjoy yourself at the
Jordans"&mdash;the name was not Jordan, of course. "They're
frightfully slow, and all that, and the old man is quite
impossible, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take your seats, please!"</p>

<p>This from the guard, followed by a request for permits from a
gentleman in a cutaway coat and a red armlet. Quite as formal is
the officer's leave-taking. He might be going to Scotland or
leaving a country house-party. Confound the man, why doesn't he
show some trace of emotion? There is all the material for "high
tragedy" here, all the elements for a coloured supplement for a
Christmas number, something thickly laid with tears and tense
faces, and drawn cheeks and droops and faints. Something of the
good-bye-soldier's-farewell order; but he kept one anxious eye on
the stowing away of a case of champagne, and she twiddled with
her long gold chain and looked bored.</p>

<p>But there is comedy enough, and at the last minute.</p>

<p>Enter belated Atkins, with a kit-bag slung over one shoulder,
a carbine gripped in one hand, and his helmet put on wrong side
in front. Atkins has been dining, and Atkins wants much of the
platform to himself. There is a ticket-inspector, who wants to
see Atkins's ticket, and as for Atkins himself, all he wants is
to find his train.</p>

<p><i>Ticket Inspector</i>: "Your ticket, please.</p>

<p><i>Atkins</i>: "Whoffer?"</p>

<p><i>T.I.</i>: "I want to see it."</p>

<p><i>Atkins</i> (jocularly): "Go hon! Where's my train?"</p>

<p><i>T.I.</i>: "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>(<i>Atkins</i> (severely): "Never you mind where I'm goin'.
Where's my train?"</p>

<p><i>T.I.</i>: "Let me see your ticket."</p>

<p><i>Atkins</i> (sternly polite): "Big ear?"</p>

<p>TI.: "Hey?"</p>

<p>(<i>Atkins</i> (grimly pleasant): "Thick lip?"</p>

<p><i>T.I.</i>: "What do you mean?"</p>

<p><i>Atkins</i> (dropping carbine and kit bag with a crash on
the platform, and throwing his helmet on to the roof of the
saloon): "D'you wanter big ear or thick lip? 'Cos if so, can
accommodate."</p>

<p><i>T.I.</i>: "None of your nonsense, me man.</p>

<p><i>Atkins</i>: "Never min' 'bout nonsense. Will you be so
kind's ter put up your 'ands for about two minutes?"</p>

<p>At this point enter the military police, who knowing Atkins
for a brother, gather together his traps, throw them into a
third-class compartment, and bundle their owner after them.</p>

<p>"Stand away, please!"</p>

<p>The flash of a green lamp and the long shrill of a whistle, an
answering hoot from the darkness ahead, and the train moves.</p>

<p>"Good-bye. Remember me to &mdash;&mdash;. Don't forget to tell
'Arry about the 'umming bird."</p>

<p>"I arst yer, man to man, do you want a big ear?" This from
Atkins, his body half-way out of the carriage window, and
addressing a station inspector, who is absolutely innocent of
offence against him.</p>

<p>"Good-bye; do write. Good-bye, old chap, mind the Boers don't
catch you!"</p>

<p>Boers! Why, of course, we are off to the front, travelling
first-class through the enemy's country, and seeing war from a
saloon window.</p>

of officers and men whom I had known. Some are dead, some are

remembered.</p>

<p>And so on to Wellington, where a gentleman comes round to
inspect the permits, and a very nice lady serves very indifferent
coffee.</p>

<p>The night is pitch dark, but the rain has ceased. One by one
out go the electric lights in the compartments, and the
passengers of the "4 Down" settle to sleep.</p>

<p>With many a roar and rattle and swish the train flies down the
gradients of the Hex Valley. Thundering through cutting, skimming
along narrow bank, whistling with hoarse rage at every red
warning, with many a grunt and cough, and clank of slipping
driving-wheel it climbs again. Great, dimly-outlined masses of
rock and tree slip from the darkness, focus the harsh roar of the
train for a second, and are gone.</p>

<p>Flying through corn-fields, the damp green of the young corn,
which comes straggling down to the rail edge, lit for the moment
by a blaze of light from the engine as the stoker throws open the
furnace-door for the moment to feed his iron-bellied baby.
Twisting and turning through the dark gorges of Tulbagh, the car
lights reflected in the waters of the mad little stream that
races fifty feet below. Sweeping cleanly round the bases of the
grey buttresses of the Hex River Range, and then clinging like
death to lip and ledge as the slow-going, snorting, grinding mass
laboriously wins a way up to 4,000 ft to the very crest of the
mountain.</p>

<p>All this is in the dark, with little lights showing faintly in
the black valley below, and the pale flush of coming day
whitening the topmost peaks above. Snort, snort, snort, puff,
puff, puff, foot by foot, and yard by yard, and so slowly that
one might alight from the front carriage, go to sleep, and wake
up in time to board the guard's van. Strain and tug, and grind,
and steadily the twenty-eight feet gradient becomes thirty, and
then fifty, and then sixty, and so till with one triumphant
squeal from its brass lips, the hauling engine feels level
ground, and halts like some animate thing to pant and sweat and
tremble.</p>

<p class="cp">"A SCRATCH TEAM"</p>

<p>Then, as the fan of light broadens eastward, and the molten
rim of the sun serves the whole visible world as it has been
serving the higher peaks for the last quarter of an hour, a
million diamonds flash on herb and bush and tree, and a dozen
rays of light force the wooden guard that bars the window. Ten
million dust motes in every streak of light, a hand groping
sleepily along the table for a watch, which hours since has been
shaken to the floor, a jarring of brakes, a long whistle, and
Touws River&mdash;and coffee.</p>

<p>Coffee tastes well in the early morning, and the first
cigarette tastes &mdash;no. it doesn't taste, it is a sensation,
the like of which no smoker of opium or eater of bhang has ever
experienced. My officer friend agrees with me, and remembers an
occasion in Mhow when&mdash;also I recollect a time in Marandalas
when&mdash;and so on for half an hour, and the train, moves not.
Why? A native porter outside who is appealed to doesn't know, but
thinks that the train is "going soon now." Questioned, the
stationmaster supplies startling news laconically. "Wire cut;
Boers fourteen miles down the line." And this is a trifle over a
hundred miles from Cape Town, at a time when, according to no
less than four Cabinet Ministers and at least one special
correspondent, the fabric of Boer resistance is tottering to its
fall.</p>

<p>You get a glimpse of the station commandant; as he passes. A
young, purposeful Kaffrarian Rifleman. He is here, there and
everywhere, moving quickly, yet without hurry. Two lines on his
forehead. One for the Boer commando that is approaching his post,
another for the handful of raw troops he has got to hold the
station.</p>

<p>Touws River stands, on the top step Of the Hinterland.
Fittingly enough, the garden of Cape Colony lies at the foot Of
the steps, and to push the metaphor still further, the commandant
is anxious to confine the disturbance to the house, and to
prevent a scandal in the Street of Nations by the brawlers
carrying their quarrel to the front garden.</p>

<p>There is a quick search along the train for reinforcements,
and the first man discovered is the pugnacious Atkins, who is
looking particularly cheap in the fresh tight of morning. The
search along the carriages is prolific. Two lancers, a dragoon,
three militiamen, an Imperial Light Horseman, one of the cyclist
corps, a Royal Engineer, a Cape Policeman, and a Guardsman are
quickly organised under an Artillery sergeant, an armoured truck
is improvised, and the little force, which in better days and
newer clothing, might well have stood as a group representative
of the British Army, climbs on board, and the armoured train
moves slowly towards the spot where the wire has been cut.</p>

<p class="cp">THE BOER HAS COME AND GONE</p>

<p>It is gone half an hour when from the high hill at the back of
the station a blue flag waves frantically, and is as furiously
answered by a signaller near the little camp. A pause, full of
speculation, and then from the engine-shed:
"Hoot&mdash;toot&mdash;toot&mdash;toot&mdash;too-o-o-o-t."</p>

<p>That is the inevitable hooter for the inevitable Town
Guard.</p>

<p>"A large body of Boers are approaching the station."</p>

<p>That is the news the flag has wagged, and the inevitable Town
Guardsman commences to arrive quickly. Touws River has a fairly
large railway population, say a hundred at the outside, and the
turn out of the Town Guard at Touws River was very much like a
turn out at any other place.</p>

<p>First a telegraph messenger boy, with a rifle as long as
himself, and a bandolier reaching down to his thighs. Then a very
dirty engine-cleaner, grinning whitely through the grime. Then a
foreman of sorts in dingy slouch hat and corduroy trousers, who
turned out later to be the sergeant-major. Then a very fat porter
in a golf cup and a bandolier that seemed imbedded in his adipose
tissues. Many youths smiling sheepishly, one elderly gentleman,
looking remarkably fierce, and in khaki, with a slouch hat tilted
rakishly over one eye, and the usual ruck of indifferent people,
all rifled and bandoliered, some with bayonets, and every one
looking singularly fit and cheerful. In parties of six and eight
they marched off to their appointed stations.</p>

<p>An hour passes&mdash;no Boers. Another&mdash; still no Boers.
Two more&mdash;and yet not a Boer, or the sign of a- Boer, and
then the armoured train returns. The Boers have cleared, the line
is untouched.</p>

<p>"Right behind."</p>

<p>Off once more, seven hours late, till we reach a place where
the wires droop to the ground, and the poles are bent and
broken.</p>

<p>The Boer has come and gone, and as we steal along we pass a
little group of men who, with bared heads, are lowering something
into a narrow slit of the earth.</p>

<h2><a id="art45" name="art45">IN SEARCH OF A FIGHT</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Taranaki Herald</i> (New Zealand), January 31, 1902</h3>

<p class="cp">THE HISTORY OF A PARAGRAPH</p>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG, November 22, 1901</p>

<p class="quote">"A small engagement is reported from
Rietfontein, where a patrol of the Transvaal Carbineers came in
touch with twenty of the enemy. Shots were exchanged, and the
Boers retired, leaving three wounded in our hands. The enemy lost
two killed. Our losses, one trooper wounded."</p>

<p>That is an unimportant enough paragraph, don't you think? It
is copied-with certain alterations from a wire I despatched to
the <i>Daily Mail</i>. And yet, you may not believe it, but it is
nevertheless a fact, that the minor engagement was once a big
battle. It was a British disaster: it was a Boer defeat. It was
the capture of two of our guns, and the killing of two Boer
commandants. Also it was an evenly-matched fight, with casualties
running to three figures on both sides. It was all these things,
at various times and in various localities. In Maritzburg it was
a reverse, and a bad reverse; in Pretoria it was a victory, and a
great victory. Johannesburg had heard of it, and Krugersdorp knew
the number of guns taken and the battery which, had lost
them.</p>

<p class="cp">SIFTED FIRST, THEN SENT</p>

<p>I went to find out all about this great fight, and after
reducing the evidence by comparative examination, I sent a wire
something like that above, and I fancy it is about correct.</p>

<p>The fight occurred on a Monday, and the first news was from a
blockhouse in view of the mountain near which the fighting took
place. The corporal in charge of the blockhouse telephoned "Heavy
firing in the direction of Rooiberg." Now there are two
Rooibergs, as indeed there are twenty (I am using a fictitious
locality for obvious reasons), and the commandant of the nearest
garrison jumped to the conclusion that it was a Rooiberg near
which Botha was known to be, and whither columns were hastening.
Immediately he wired that Botha was engaged. The mistake,
however, was soon discovered and rectified, and that incident, as
far as those chiefly interested were concerned, was closed. But
what time the little roadside garrison had been astir with the
news that Botha was heavily engaged, the Johannesburg train had
passed through the station. Only a few minutes, it stopped, but
Atkins on the platform had imparted his exclusive information to
such of the passengers as were interested, and the train moved
on,bearing in addition to passengers and baggage quite a
carriage-load of stories of "the great fight." To Johannesburg
came the rumour, and it trickled into the railway carriage in
which I was making my way to Pretoria.</p>

<p>"A big thing: a very big thing, I've heard," said my
travelling companion, an officer in an irregular regiment; "we've
lost&mdash;I don't know how many&mdash;and two guns&mdash;I'm
told. They lost just as many as we did, if wot more. Commandants
Marais and Du Plessis captured&mdash;so I understand."</p>

<p>You see, he had got hold of the "evenly-matched" story. The
"complete reverse" yarn I heard from an irate subaltern, of
Militia, who told me his father was an M.P. and would see about
it. He was a very young subaltern, and his clothes were quite
new.</p>

<p>"Where did you hear of it?"</p>

<p>That question generally elicited one reply. "Oh, a fellow told
me. don't you know. He heard it from a passenger on one of these
trains who saw the fight."</p>

<p class="cp">EMENDATIONS BY MR ATKINS</p>

<p>All this looked sound enough, and although the nearest
intelligence officer knew nothing about the engagement, I
prepared to get nearer to the scene of operation. Officially
Johannesburg knew nothing, as did Pretoria and Vereeniging; but
none the less there seemed every possibility of its truth, and it
was worth looking into.</p>

<p>It was somewhat of a shock to discover that the news had come
by the Cape train and not, as I had imagined, by the Natal mail,
which crosses the country in which Botha usually operates. Botha
seldom goes south of the Natal line, but anyhow there was nothing
to prevent him doing the unusual thing if he felt inclined. A few
minutes after the thought occurred to me, an officer hurrying
past stopped to tell me that Botha had crossed the Natal line and
was engaged south; So the story grew more feasible, and I
resolved on moving south towards Vereeniging. I passed the
garrison post whence the story had emanated, I passed the
blockhouse that had reported the firing, and, all unknowing of
the irony of it. I passed the handful of men who had been
engaged; and so I reached Vereeniging. Vereeniging knew the truth
of the matter, for this station possesses a real intelligence
officer. I was told the true story of the "great battle" and how
the mistake had arisen, and got back to Elandsfontein station in
time to hear a veritable Bill Adams of an Atkins telling an
admiring circle the story of the Battle of Rooiberg. He had been
one of the patrol and had brought the slightly wounded men into
Elandsfontein by means of a convenient train that had happened to
be coming the right way. Now the way Atkins told his story was
not as I told it in the telegram which heads this column. Nor was
it told as the widely exaggerated stories that first reached me
were told. This is the story as it fell from Atkins's lips and
taken down by me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Ere was them," said Atkins, indicating "them" with the butt
of his rifle on the station platform, "and there was
us"&mdash;"us" being by a weighing machine&mdash;"The Captin, 'e
says, 'I think we've got 'em now, me lads. All I want now is a
man to volunteer to go round the back of that kopje and see if
they've got anyone awaitin' be'ind to give us 'ell as soon as we
move on 'em. I want,' 'e sez, 'a trustworthy, reliable man,' 'e
sez, 'one that knows 'is dooty, and is an ole soldier,' 'e sez,
'none of your three months' service boys,' 'e sez. An' Sergeant
Jones&mdash;that's my sergeant&mdash;'e sez, 'Send Baker,' 'e
sez, ''e's a good soldier,' 'e sez&mdash;that's my name," added
Atkins modestly.</p>

<p class="cp">THE END OF THEIR TAILS</p>

<p>"I dessay," said a sarcastic listener. "And did you go?"</p>

<p>"I did," replied Atkins, "and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I s'pose your face frightened 'em" suggested the
interrupter.</p>

<p>"Shut up". Go on, cocky." This from the audience,</p>

<p>"Well, I crawls and I creeps, a-'idin' be'ind bushes and
rocks, till I gits beside the kopje, an' when I looks round there
was their nibs a-sittin', waitin' for the captin to come on. Nigh
on seven 'undred, I should say. As soon as I sees 'em I nips back
to the captin, an' I sez, 'There's about eight 'undred burjers a-
waitin' for you there, sir.' An' 'e sez, ''Ow many?' 'Eight
'undred,' I sez. 'Did you count 'em,' 'e sez. 'Yes.' sez I as
bold as brass. 'Well,' he sez, 'it strikes me, Baker, you've got
second sight,' 'e sez, 'an' if there's eight 'undred Boers round
there I'll eat my boots,' 'e sez. Any'ow, we got the squadron
divided into three sections, an' one went to the left, the other
to the right, and the other a'ead. Well, bimeby we give a yell
an' charged on the kopje, an' sure enough they started firin'
from the top, only it wasn't what you'd call an 'eavy fire, but
just a 'klik-klok, klik-klok,' just about as fast as I can say
it. Well, bimeby up went a white flag, and me an' Jimmy Sparks
went up with our rifles at the ready&mdash;you bet your life on
that&mdash;and there was three wounded Boers an' two dead 'uns,
an' the rest of the commando was gone. Then the Captin comes up,
an' he starts questionin' the wounded ones&mdash;that one," said
Atkins, pointing to one of the prisoners seated with his arm in a
sling on a bundle of blankets "&mdash;and then 'e asks 'im what
they called the kopje&mdash;the name of it, I mean&mdash;an' the
Boer, 'e sez, 'Baboon's Kop,' 'e sez. 'Are there any baboons
about "ere?' sez the Captin. 'Lots,' sez this 'ere Boer, 'Look
over there,' and may I be &mdash;&mdash; if there wasn't a young
thousand of 'em, chatterin' an' jorrin' along a ridge nearby. So
the Captin 'e laughs an' 'e sez, 'Oh, Baker,' 'e sez, 'where's
them eight 'undred Boers?' 'e sez. 'Didn't you notice they 'ad
tails on,' 'e sez."</p>

JUSTICE&mdash;HOW A TRAITOR DIED</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), February 4,
1902</h3>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 20, 1901</p>

<p>Familiar as we are with death that comes sudden and horrid,
callous as we have grown to the inevitable casualty, to the
shrunken mess, the vacant seat, to the comrade who has passed and
whose requiem is a "poor old boy" and a half-ashamed sigh, there
is always something extraordinary in the prearranged casualty,
the death that is as an engagement made three weeks ahead.</p>

<p>Men inured to scenes of carnage, hardened in warfare and
seasoned to death&mdash;I have seen them shudder at a little calm
and bloodless sentencing. It is not the value of the life to be
spilt, for in this, the Land of Little White Crosses, where
graves are more frequent than milestones, what is the value of a
life, be it prince's or private's? It is not pity, for what pity
can there be for a man who trafficks in treason, and is a chapman
selling men cheaply? It is perhaps the brokery of it all: the
fair trading of life for life; the bargaining of plea against
accusation; the final adjustment by the keen-witted arbitrator,
and the businesslike arrangements for a settling day. It is the
knowledge of the settling day, that there will be no carrying of
accounts, but a final settling for once and for all. No whirl and
clamour and delirium of battle. No joy of give and take, with all
the chances of immunity and little reck of death&mdash;only the
cold, helpless, trapped doing to death, with a grave dug
beforehand and the hour of the funeral arranged in advance.</p>

<p>I have told you before of a military execution; from time to
time I have tried to paint war in its true colours&mdash;which
are black and red and grey. Black for the sorrow and the gloom
and the suffering; red, blood-red for the quick, clean death; and
grey for the monotony and dreariness of it all.</p>

<p class="cp">HORRID WAR</p>

<p>You ought to know what war is, for it is a good thing to
avoid; yon should see that side which the war artist is blind to
and the decent photographer wisely passes by. You can do this in
cold print, since the writer may skip sickening details which the
camera places on record&mdash;and it is the detail that counts.
If there is a cheerful aspect to warfare, it is but one spoke in
the whole wheel, and all the rest are horrors. War! what does it
signify to you? I will tell you what it signifies to me.</p>

<p>I once met a dear old friend of mine&mdash;he was not old as
years go&mdash;and he asked me to breakfast with him. We were
trekking at the time, and he had joined the column during the
night, having brought in a convoy. We talked of old times and old
friends, and he talked about his wife and apologised for a
baby&mdash;he was ridiculously young. The column moved off and we
rode together for a distance, and he told me a funny story about
a brigade-major, which I jotted down as I rode for future
reference. He did not finish the story, for he was called away to
take his troop on ahead to reconnoitre the country.</p>

<p>The Boers were holding a position a few miles ahead, the usual
sort of thing; a ridge, a farmhouse, and a <i>donga</i>,* and it
took two hours' fighting, and hard fighting, to turn them out.
After the fight was over I went round with the ambulances to
collect the wounded. The first man I saw was H&mdash;&mdash;, my
poor friend, a bullet through his heart, a smile on his lips, and
eyes that stared blankly at the hot blue sky. And the word "war"
always recalls that picture, and- the" story of the brigade-major
that was never finished.</p>

<p class="Footnote">[* <i>Donga</i> (Afrikaans from Zulu)&mdash;a
ditch formed by the erosion of soil. The word means "bank, side
of a gully" in Zulu. <i>Wikipedia</i>. ]</p>

<p>And so now I tell you of another death, that you may see war
as it is, not as you would wish to see it.</p>

<p class="cp">THE CHARGE</p>

<p>Nearly three weeks ago, on November 4, to be exact, two men
were arraigned before a military court at Johannesburg. For some
time past the burgher camps had been utilised by a certain class
of burgher as convalescent homes for enervated burghers. Pleasant
rest camps, where captured Boers might recover from the fatigues
incidental to campaigning, and where, having thoroughly
recuperated, they might seize favourable opportunities for
slipping back again to the commandoes. True, they were obliged to
take the oath of neutrality if they wished to remain in these
camps. If they did not so chose, they were deported.</p>

<p>It was in consequence of this practice that:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">"David Garnus Wernich and Hendnck Meyer,
residing within the British lines in the burgher camp at
Johannesburg, in the Transvaal, were charged with:</p>

<p class="quote">Firstly, High Treason, in that they, both or one
or other of them, and at various dates between the months of July
and October 1901, (both months inclusive), did, at the said
burgher camp, incite and persuade by word of mouth certain
surrendered burghers residing at the said burner camp&mdash;that
is to say, among others, William Cornelius Mynhardt, Johannes
Jurgens Klopper, Hendrick Cornelius Nel, and Frederick Emil Metz,
to leave the burgher camp and join the King's enemies;</p>

<p class="quote">Secondly, breaking the Oath of Neutrality, in
that they both or one or other of them, on the dates and at the
place mentioned in the first charge, having previously taken the
oath of neutrality did incite and persuade by word of mouth,
certain burghers, namely, the said burghers mentioned in the
first charge, to leave the said burgher camp and join the King's
enemies;</p>

<p class="quote">Thirdly, inciting to break the Oath of
Neutrality, in that they, both or one or other of them, and on
the dates and in the places mentioned in the foregoing charges,
did incite and persuade, by word of mouth, certain burghers,
namely, the said burghers , namely, the said burghers mentioned
in the first charge, to leave the said burgher camp and join the
King's enemies."</p>

<p>Stripped of all the legal phraseology, they were charged with
holding a pro-Boer meeting. The court found Wernich guilty on all
counts, Meyer on charges one and three, and the court having
closed, the prisoners were led back to the cells. That was three
weeks ago, and neither man knew what his sentence was to be.</p>

<p class="cp">MERCIFUL SWIFTNESS</p>

<p>Yesterday morning Wernich knew. A raw morning and no sign yet
of the dawn. A terrific storm had passed over Johannesburg the
previous night, and the thunder still rumbled on the hills
around, and the lightning flared fitfully on the horizon. Here
and there a coated policeman, his rifle slung at his shoulder,
paced the dead streets, casting an eve upwards for a stray star
glittering through a momentary cloud break The streets silent,
save for the grumbling thunder roll, every house lifeless, every
window dark, and on the outskirts of the town the unquiet signal
lamps, blinking and winking from kopje to kopje. Then a clatter
of hoofs from the direction of the fort, and a horseman gallops
through the town to the charge-office, Johannesburg's central
police station. He has a message to deliver, a sealed envelope
for the chief gaoler Then he wheels his horse, for he has another
errand. This time it is a doctor to be roused. Then the horseman
rides back to the fort, and the iron-shod klip- klap grows
fainter and dies away. Once more silence the streets of
Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Inside the charge-office the gaoler has broken the seal, and
has proceeded to Wernich's cell. A muffled figure with rifle and
fixed bayonet steps on one side to allow the gaoler to pass into
the cell, and a man is wakened from his sleep to hear the
sentence of the court.</p>

<p class="cp">"To be shot at sunrise."</p>

<p>The condemned man does not understand; he is still half
asleep. It may be only a bad dream. Then he realises and bursts
into tears.</p>

<p>To be shot at six, and already it is past three! He dresses,
and the guard outside assemble to march him to the fort, the
place of execution. Dressed at last. Out into the deserted street
swings the little party.</p>

<p>Tramp, tramp, shuffle, shuffle; the prisoner is taking his
last walk.</p>

<p>Think of it This walk through the city of the dead, with never
a familiar face or the glint of pity from human eyes. Only the
unpeopled streets and the silent houses and the pale herald of
dawn in the eastern sky. What a morning for thoughts! Little
white boats on a sunny sea; fat kine browsing on a golden ridge.
Love and hope and the goodness of living. Then the fort and shut
doors behind, and the hours slip round faster than ever they
slipped before, and the minister's voice offering spiritual
consolation is a meaningless drone.</p>

<p>"Life everlasting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This is the life the poor wretch wants; and then he is led
outside and blindfolded, and two gaolers lead him by the arm to a
chair. He cannot see what is happening; he only knows that he
will be killed very quickly and very soon. If his eyes were
unbandaged he would see that even as he is placed against the
chair, and while yet the warders are at his elbows, ten men
facing him have raised their rifles to the present. Then,
unassisted, he sits, and the warders spring clear.</p>

<p>His body does not touch the seat before the rifles crash.</p>

THE ROCKS AHEAD<br>
LORD MILNER'S DIFFICULT TASK</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), February 6,
1902</h3>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG, Saturday, November 23, 1901</p>

<p>The war has gone on so long now that we have almost forgotten
the events that led up to the ultimatum, and quite forgotten the
exact conditions that existed in Johannesburg in the days of the
crisis.</p>

<p>The relations of master to man, or capital to labour, and the
real feeling of the Uitlander population were generally crowded
out or over-clouded by the more pretentious or serious issues on
which depended the position Great Britain should take in the
future in South Africa. British supremacy in South Africa was the
paramount issue, and the minor questions relating to the
regulations of the many conflicting interests which go to the
making of internal politics in the Transvaal, or more properly
speaking, in Johannesburg itself, were never factors in the
establishment of British rule, and as such never attained the
publio attention that such matters as the wording of the preamble
of the 1881 Convention succeeded in attaining.</p>

<p class="cp">HEIGHT OF HIS POPULARITY</p>

<p>That there were questions quite as important to the man in the
street of Johannesburg as the franchise, or, indeed, as the
suzerainty; that there were parties in Johannesburg as dissimilar
in their views as are Tories and Nationalists cannot be doubted;
and the fact that Lord Milner will have these questions to deal
with on the general return to the Rand is absolutely certain.</p>

<p>Lord Milner has now reached the zenith of his popularity, for
now it is that the people of South Africa, animated by a genuine
patriotism, take a broad Imperial view of his work. They view his
work from a distance, and they can admire his splendid powers,
because he is now, and, indeed, has been since he first arrived
in this country, grappling with the great national danger which
they but imperfectly understood, yet understood sufficiently to
appreciate. There will come a time when some immediate action
will be called for by the exigencies of the case, and when he
will have to deal with questions which, outside the sphere of
high politics, present more complex aspects than has done this
great South African question of Briton versus Boer.</p>

<p>Questions demanding legislation which must necessarily affect
adversely the many interests of the industrial community, and as
necessarily creating dissatisfaction amongst men who to-day
regard Lord Milner as an embodiment of every virtue. The wise
counsellor of to-day will, with a section of the population, be
the foolish, if indeed not criminal, counsellor of to-morrow. The
honest, fair-minded arbitrator of to-day will be suspected to-
morrow of bias and prejudice&mdash;the bias being in favour of
the suspicious party's opponent. No concession to capital but
will be accompanied by a loss of confidence on the part of
labour; no attempt at the amelioration of the lot of the
democracy which is not in some way offensive to the
plutocrat.</p>

<p class="cp">PERPLEXITIES BEFORE HIM</p>

<p>The rocks before Lord Milner are many. It may be urged that in
every British possession under the sun the same conditions
obtain; that there is no Colonial Governor who did not have to
contend against similar difficulties. In the case of the
Transvaal, however, it is quite different. There can be no
comparison made between South Africa and any other colony or
collection of colonies. Examine first causes, and appreciate the
difficulties of Lord Milner's position in the first days of his
rule.</p>

<p>The feeling that prevailed at the time of the Jameson Raid
among the Uitlander community was scarcely modified at the end of
1899, and Lord Milner knew that the ambition of a great majority
of Uitlanders was less centred in the Transvaal becoming merged
into the British Empire than that it should become an English-
speaking republic. Such a republic could not but exercise a most
pernicious effect, and could scarcely help dominating affairs in
the Cape Colony to the detriment of purely British interests. It
is by no means uncertain that had the Uitlanders been left to
work out their own salvation, on the death of President Kruger,
something approaching a revolution, in which many of the Dutch
would have taken sides with the Uitlanders, would have been
witnessed, and the balance of power been shifted from the heads
of the retrogressive party into those of progressives, many of
whom, as the "flag" incident of the Raid days testifies, were by
no means anxious to see the Union Jack raised in the Transvaal.
Here was a condition to start with which has no parallel in the
world. Then came the war and the exodus of the Uitlanders. The
war dragged on, and two years and a quarter find that 80 per cent
of these people are still away from their homes, and the majority
of them dependent upon charity for their existence.</p>

<p class="cp">THE RUINED ELEMENT</p>

<p>It will probably be nearer three years, before all these
people can return, and what does that mean? It means that some
forty to fifty thousand people who, three years ago, were in
comparatively comfortable circumstances, will return beggared.
Three years of idleness will have demoralised them; they will
return full of bitter grievances&mdash;many unreasonable, if you
like&mdash;against those who have been the cause of their
enforced holiday. They will be subject for some years to a heavy
taxation, and for some time will be ruled by a Crown Government,
which form is always the most exasperating and most resented.</p>

<p>Added to this, these people who have been rusting for three
years&mdash;eating their hearts out in the coast towns and
growing old at the rate of one year in four months&mdash;will be
called upon to compete with the eager new- comer, who, with
mountains of energy and not a little capital, has come out from
England or America to make his fortune. Other colonies, it is
true, have been under Crown Government for a considerable number
of years; but it must not be forgotten that no war preceded in
their cases, nor was there all the material to hand, not to say
machinery, for elective representation.</p>

<p>I shall never be surprised to learn that echoes of
dissatisfaction are reaching England regarding Lord Milner's
administration, and that from quarters whose loyalty is above
suspicion. Our great pro-Consul has done so much for the
Uitlander that the possibility of the Uitlander turning on him
does not seem worth thinking on; but in spite of the seeming
ingratitude of the action, there are many excuses which may be
found for the disaffected ones. That some dissatisfaction already
exists is certain, and that this will increase with the increase
of Johannesburg's population is more than likely.</p>

<p class="cp">BITTERNESS TO BE OVERCOME</p>

<p>In the first place, the refugee will return with the knowledge
that while he and his wife have been left to starve the
Government has been pampering the families of our enemy, who is
still fighting against us. That is a good basis for everlasting
grievances. Public men will return to find that the Government
which Lord Milner controls has forced upon it municipal reforms
costing over a million of money, which has to be paid by people
who have had no voice in the appointment of the men who voted the
money. Property-holders will find laws and proclamations so
ambiguously worded&mdash;as, for instance, the now famous
"beneficial occupation" clause&mdash;that can result in nothing
but endless litigation. It will be well to be prepared for some
strong expressions of public feeling which, while of only local
significance, may be easily construed by Lord Milner's enemies as
expressions of mistrust in his greater policy. The question of
Briton and Boer vying peacefully together in the same country is
less likely to cause the High Commissioner trouble than the
question of Briton and Briton residing amicably in the same
street.</p>

<p>It is during the next two years that Lord Milner will require
all the patience and strength that he has at his command, and all
the confidence and affection his countrymen can give him.</p>

JOHANNESBURG OF TODAY<br>
RETURN OF FIRST-CLASS REFUGEES</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), February 7,
1902</h3>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG, November 28, 1901</p>

<p>Three decently-crowded streets and half a hundred deserted
ones&mdash;that is Johannesburg to-day.</p>

<p>Commissioner Street, Pritchard Street, Market Square, and the
streets adjacent are alive enough between nine in the morning and
five in the afternoon; rickshaw-boys with a rattle and jingle
trot about in the white sunlight or seek shady and unfrequented
streets for a quiet "loaf." Dilapidated cabs, many having the
appearance of having been on commando, rattle through the uneven
streets. The tramway lines are almost hidden by the accumulation
of dust and the overspread of macadam.</p>

<p>Johannesburg is only half awake. It is a dozing town, having
bad dreams&mdash;a town that, if it speaks at all, speaks in its
sleep. A military town with mounted: orderlies and cyclists
innumerable, and budding Rand riflemen, irreproachably dressed in
Panama hats and carrying Lee-Enfield rifles.</p>

<p class="cp">A DESERTED CITY</p>

<p>In the middle of the day Johannesburg is deceptive. You see
business people hurrying backward and forward, You see a throng
round the counters of the banks. You lunch at the club in a
crowd. You take your place in a long queue at the censor's
window, and you think Johannesburg is pretty full. After dinner
stroll out in the town and look for the crowd. The streets are
empty, the windows are black, and dead, here and there a
policeman, here and there a solitary pedestrian, on the rank in
Market Square the gleam of a dozen cab lamps&mdash;Johannesburg
is a place of great emptiness.</p>

<p>The man in the street has not yet returned. The people who go
to make a crowd are still waiting their permits at the coast or
are yet in England. The men you see hurrying about in the
broiling sun at midday are the heads of departments, who in
ordinary times could not leave their offices, but the clerks and
the messengers are still at the coast. The men who have yet to
return&mdash;and they will soon&mdash;are they who have no money
to bank, no telegrams to send, who lunch cheaper than at the Rand
Club.</p>

<p>Take a stroll through the suburbs; visit Doornfontein,
Fordsburg, Braamfontein. If Johannesburg is a city half asleep,
these suburbs are dead. Here and there a house is inhabited, but
most of them are shuttered, blinded, and barricaded in the manner
in which they were left by their tenants. Weeds dominate the
gardens, dust covers the windows and lies inches thick in the
corners of verandahs. The roads are worn and uneven, the
sidewalks are painful to walk upon, and at all hours, day or
night, a deathly stillness reigns.</p>

<p class="cp">THE FIVE-SHILLING PEOPLE</p>

<p>Go to the poorer parts of Johannesburg, homes of the poor
whites. Sordid and wretched at the best of times, they are
dilapidation itself to-day. Rough planks torn from old packing-
cases nailed with crude workmanship across grimy
windows&mdash;Heaven alone knows what the poverty-stricken owners
feared to lose from their hovels. Battered lengths and half-
lengths of galvanised iron serving the same purpose, and across
each improvised shutter, be it wood or iron, the tattered
remnants of some alluring placard demanding in uproarious red or
threatening black, and in letters six inches long, recruits for
every irregular corps in the field, from Kitchener's Fighting
Scouts to the Rand Rifles. Sometimes it is an advertisement of an
entertainment, but these are few and far between. There is a
flaring poster on the hoarding opposite my hotel which tells that
for sweet charity's sake Dr Gerald Grace, own nephew to "W.G.,"*
will give an entertainment to-night at the Masonic Hall. The
seats are five shillings and the booking is enormous. It is the
five-shilling people who are back on the Rand. There is another
concert next week at ten shillings a seat, and the booking is
brisk. One of these days the people who do not rise above a
shilling will come back, and then Johannesburg will be
repopulated.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* "W.G."&mdash;the famous English cricket-
player William Gilbert Grace (1848-1915).]</p>

<p>I went for a walk this morning around the slums. Through long
streets of ugly one-storied shanties, with a storekeeper at one
corner and a Peruvian at the other. Through lanes of filthy,
crazy dwellings, leaning against each other for support, boasting
of one window and one door, all religiously boarded up where not
occupied, and all giving the idea that a small boy with a tack-
hammer could knock them to pieces. Past hideous erections on the
"model" plan, empty most of them&mdash;dirty blinds behind grimy
windows, and silence in the stifling little courtyard. The
caretaker, an Italian, offered me a room at &pound;6 a month, and
was visibly depressed when I declined his offer.</p>

<p class="cp">ABSENT AND PRESENT</p>

<p>From the deserted slums I sought the quarter where I was
informed dwelt in time of peace the artisan. There were tiny
cottages, weather-worn and soiled-looking, with a slip of tangled
garden in front, and just a bit of verandah. Some there were with
white curtains and men and women moving about in front, but
mostly they were poor, soulless things looking miserable and
forlorn. Evidently the Maker of Things is still absent, and so,
too, is the small shopkeeper who supplies his needs, for the
corner shops were mere hoardings for the local Willing.</p>

<p>From the home of the toiler to Johannesburg's
Belgravia&mdash;broad avenues, tree-shaded, and glimpses of red-
brick houses through the trees. Houses that stand back from the
road in aggressive modesty. Establishments rising storey upon
storey, with wings flung left and right&mdash;houses with
carriage- drives and servants' entrances. Houses of red and white
stone, polished windows and snowy curtains and glittering
brasses. The little roadways that lead through ornate iron gates
to the noble portals, these are clean and well-swept, for the
owner has returned. By night the soft glow of electric lamps and
the glitter of silver and glass&mdash;the owner is giving a
dinner-party, perchance to celebrate his return to the Rand,
lucky man that he is! It is a pleasure to walk round this suburb,
to see these mansions so beautiful and chaste and refreshing. To
think on these evidences of wealth and luxury, to note the trim
gardens and the well-stocked conservatories, the tennis-courts
and the croquet lawns, and it is with a feeling of pleasure that
you remember that the owner is not being kept from his beautiful
home by the unpleasant but necessary restrictions of the Civil
Permit Office. We are not doing business in Johannesburg these
days, there is no business to do, and yet there are quite a
number of people here, and two hundred families are returning
weekly.</p>

<p class="cp">WHEN THE THIRD-CLASS COMES</p>

<p>Go to the tea-rooms at five o'clock. The place is crowded, and
you will scarcely get a seat. A rustling of skirts, a babel of
talk, flushed waitresses hurrying to and fro, a string-band
hidden somewhere in the fernery playing "Florodora." Many
officers, a few ladies, and a sprinkling of civilians.</p>

<p>Leave the tea house, walk down Pritchard Street, cross the
Market Square, and through the chains to the Stock Exchange. Not
a soul here. The offices are boarded up, the saloons closed, and
the asphalted roadway knobbly and uneven. Business, real
business, the business that Johannesburg knows and lives
on&mdash; this is dead. But the refugees will return soon, and
the streets will fill and the town will hum, and between the
chains will only be less in its animation than Throgmorton
Street. The great wheel of useful life that sways now feebly to
and fro will turn again, albeit for a time creakily.</p>

<p>It is nearly time the Cape train was in: let us go down and
meet it. Here it is&mdash; punctual to the minute. Here are some
passengers whose faces you will know if you are an old
Johannesburger. Mr A&mdash;&mdash;, the head of the great firm of
A&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;- and Co., Mr F&mdash;&mdash;, the
financier, Mr G&mdash;&mdash; , the great stockbroker. Familiar
faces all of them. Yes, the return to the Rand has started; the
refugees are returning&mdash; the first-class carriages are all
full. They are acquisitions to the community, these first-class
folk, but Johannesburg will doze, will sleep, will languish,
until the third-class carriages discharge their load.</p>

CHRISTMAS DAY ON THE VELDT</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), February 10,
1902</h3>

<p class="cp">DINNER IN THE BLOCKHOUSES</p>

<p>A Merry Christmas to you, my good friend, whoever you be. On
behalf of the Army&mdash;let me arrogate to myself the position
of spokesman for the Army&mdash;on behalf of the Army I wish you
the best and the happiest of Yuletides. I cannot send you a
Christmas card, so I send you this.</p>

<p>It is turkey and round of beef and plum-pudding and mince-pie
for you to-day. It is festoons of paper chains and laurel and
holly and mistletoe and music and laughter. Waits at your
doors&mdash;"God rest ye, merry gentlemen." Perhaps skating,
possibly snow; certainly fog.</p>

<p>There are Christmas Days and Christmas Days. There is
Christmas in the country, with the hard field a-glitter with
hoarfrost and the little church smothered in frosty ivy, and the
little "nippers" in thick boots clattering up the aisle. There is
Christmas in town, with the unhappy West being bored to death and
the joyous East with little Christmas-trees in parlour windows,
the smell of cooking travelling up the passage and into the
street, and the impatient knot of children with jugs and men with
thirsts waiting at the corner pub for one o'clock. And there is
Christmas on the veldt.</p>

<p class="cp">THE PICTURE FAR AWAY</p>

<p>Turn up the gas, snuggle closer to the fire, and imagine us,
the Army. Imagine first a great plain; imagine dozens of great
stone heaps sparsely covered with bush. On the horizon a long,
blue, jagged strip of cloud. It is not cloud at all, as a matter
of fact, but it looks like cloud; in reality it is a range of
mountains. The plain would be green if it could, only the red old
earth wears through, and shows itself in patches, and mottles the
green untidily. Pick up a stone, there are plenty lying about.
You drop it again quickly, and stare at the angry red scorch on
your hand. Yes, it is very hot, and you have been transported so
quickly from smoky, dingy old London that you blink and wink and
shade your eyes from the strong white sunlight. It is light that
fills all space and searches every fissure. A light that turns
the sky brazen and chases the blue from the very horizon. It is a
light which blisters the paint of the blockhouse on the top of
the hill, and makes the men who lie on the-shady side of the
little iron building pant again.</p>

<p>To-day has been, an uneventful day for them, judging by our
idea of what goes to make art interesting day: to them it has
been a red-letter day. It is Christmas, and my friend Smithy, who
looks the hottest of the sprawling six, will tell you he has
quite enjoyed himself. What sort of a day have they had, these
men? This morning&mdash;this very morning that you read your
<i>Daily Mail</i>, and long before you dreamt of getting up, if,
indeed, it was not before you went to bed &mdash;a form creeps
through the little door of the blockhouse and gently shakes one
of the sleepers within.</p>

<p class="cp">GOOD WISHES BY HELIOGRAPH</p>

<p>"Nearly dawn, corporal," he says. The sleeper awakes and rubs
his eyes and yawns and stretches his arms, and throwing off the
one thin blanket that covers him, he rises to his feet and wakes
the others; one by one they rise, slip on their coats, buckle
their belts, sling their bandoliers, and creep through the hole
in the wall to join their comrade outside. The stars still
twinkle overhead, and the plain below is very quiet. Eastward the
dawn is coming, and the tiny garrison stand rifle in hand,
waiting for the Boer that comes with the dawn. Not in this
blockhouse alone air tired eyes watching the dawn. A thousand
yards away is another blockhouse, and another half a dozen
watchers. Farther along another, east and west, north and south,
the men of 2,000 blockhouses await the day, looking eastward
suspiciously. Then the east changes from dead white to primrose,
and from primrose to blush rose, and then golden, and then up
sprang the first dazzling rays of light like the sticks of a fan.
Then comes the sun, the pitiless, grilling, triumphant sun,
brushing away the shadows and filling the empty veldt with life.
The garrison piles its arms arid proceeds with its ablutions.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the edge of the horizon northward comes
diversion. An irregular star-light splash of light quivers for a
moment and is gone. Then it comes again and goes as quickly. Than
it quivers and dances and twinkles jerkily. The corporal produces
his note-book and jots down the message as one of the men reads
it off.</p>

<p>"W-i-s-h a-l-l r-e-g-i-in-e-n-t M-e-r-r-y C-h-r-i-s-t-in-a-
s."</p>

<p>It is from the headquarters of the regiment holding the
blockhouse line hereabouts. The helio dances merrily, and another
of its kind, living on the top of a flat-topped mountain ten
miles south, makes haste to return the compliment. Greetings
flash from hill to hill. They are short and condensed, for there
are messages other than complimentary to follow.</p>

<p>"One of my men sniped last night while patrolling line, died
during night; buried this morning "&mdash;thus flickers the
southern helio.</p>

<p>"I wonder who that is," says one of the men of our blockhouse.
"I know two chaps in No. 81 "&mdash;blockhouses are numbered.</p>

<p class="cp">A PUDDING FROM HOME</p>

<p>A helio in the west has sprung to life.</p>

<p>"A merry Christmas, and keep your eyes open. Small party Boers
slipped past here last night; making your way."</p>

<p>This news does not interfere with the breakfasts of the
garrison. Coffee, biscuits and jam, and a tin of tongue. The
coffee isn't bad, the biscuits are more than tough, the jam is
distinctly good, but who in the name of the unnameable opened
this 'ere potted tongue last might? Ten reproachful eyes look on
Smithy, and Smithy prepares to take an oath of exceptionable
force that he never set eyes on no blooming potted tongue, but he
was ignorant of its presence in the blockhouse. Five people
remember that Smithy was complaining last night of a great
hunger; five people distinctly recollect that Smithy had
suggested that the tongue should be opened for supper; five
scornful voices give Smithy the lie direct with five varieties of
adjectives. Smithy is indignant, injured, frank, and penitent by
turns. Confesses to feeling hungry in the night, pleads Christmas
time as an excuse and a justification, says he'll make up the
loss at the earliest opportunity, and throws himself on the mercy
of the court. It is Christmas Day, so there are no
wranglings.</p>

<p>In the little box that serves as a pantry is a Christmas
pudding, which the good people of England have sent out; there is
a prime cut of beef, which the Cold Storage Manager has arranged
for; there are vegetables, and a pint of beer a man&mdash;it came
last might on a gangers' trolley; and there are letters and
papers to be read&mdash;they came last might, too.</p>

<p>Phew! but it's hot. The blockhouse smells of warm paint and
warm food and old clothes. There is a fire in the tiny kitchen
dug-out, white smoke rises straightly, no breath of air moves on
the veldt, and the light of the fire is made nothing by the light
of the sun that beats down from the white-hot sky.</p>

<p class="cp">SEASONABLE VISITORS</p>

<p>"There's someone riding over the ridge, corporal."</p>

<p>This from the sentry who has sighted the stranger. The
corporal applies his glasses.</p>

<p>"Three of 'em," he says, "in khaki; might be our chaps and
might be Boers. Keep under cover you fellers; shove a round in
your rifle, sentry&mdash;can't be too careful."</p>

<p>The horsemen drew nearer. They have feathers in their broad-
brimmed hats, that the corporal can see.</p>

<p>"Scallywags," he murmurs, "or Boers."</p>

<p>Do you observe how suspicious Atkins has grown&mdash;do you
note Atkins's definition of an irregular corps? Nearer they draw,
their rifles in the buckets at their side. They are talking and
laughing; you can hear that plainly. The one of them waves his
hand, and a long "Coo-e-e-e!" wails across the plain.</p>

<p>"Bushmen," says the corporal, closing his binoculars. "All
right, sentry, give 'em a shout. Atkins does not "cooee," but he
has got a good pair of lungs, and "What ho!" roared lustily
carries a considerable distance. They ride to the hill on which
the blockhouse is perched, and stumbling up the boulder-strewn
slope, their horses picking a way, now slipping, now jumping, now
walking, till the little party reach the barbed-wire
entanglements and dismount.</p>

<p>"A merry Christmas to you, corporal."</p>

<p>"Same to you, cocky. You've just came in time for dinner."</p>

<p>An hour or so later they sit down to dinner. A blanket is
spread on the concrete floor, the meat is carved, the potatoes
are served, the pudding is cut, the beer is divided, and Smithy
the irrepressible proposes a toast&mdash;"The King, God bless
him!" I wonder how many blockhouses to-day will ring with that
anthem?</p>

<p>There is only another toast, and the Australian proposes
it&mdash;"The folks at home"; in other words, my friends, at this
very moment, or, say, at one o'clock to-day, thousands of tin
cups will be raised&mdash;to you.</p>

<h2><a id="art50" name="art50">THE ART OF CONSPIRACY</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), February 27,
1902</h3>

<p class="cp">KILLED BY THE SPREAD OF EDUCATION</p>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG, November 29, 1901</p>

<p>The history of the plain prosy historian is never as
interesting or acceptable as the history of the novelist.
Harrison. Ainsworth could give points to Macaulay, and the Guy
Faux* of novel and, ballad is a considerable advance on the Guy
Faux that the historian has pictured.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Guy Faux</i>&mdash;usually spelt "Guy
Fawkes." Wallace presumably chose the historical spelling for its
implications of falsehood and treachery. ]</p>

<p>I cite Guy Faux because he is one of the best known characters
of English history, the most famous of conspirators. We have made
little headway in the conspiracy business since the days of that
gentleman. We never conspire nowadays without writing to somebody
and telling him all about it. In South Africa this is
particularly noticeable. The chivalry of Mr Faux that prompted
him to give warning to one of those gentlemen who would otherwise
have been a victim led to hid undoing; and the few painful
scrawls that saved his friends brought the chivalrous one to the
stake. Conspiracy has never flourished since people learnt to
write.</p>

<p class="cp">DEATH IN THE INK BOTTLE</p>

<p>Last Tuesday week, while hurrying to my quarters in the
driving rain I heard two shots fired in rapid succession. Then
came a woman's scream and the sound of men running.</p>

<p>A friendly policeman at the corner of the street supplied me
with the explanation. A conspiracy has been discovered, and the
police were engaged in making arrests. I have heard no more about
the conspiracy, so I presume it is being dealt with quietly. I do
not know exactly how many conspiracies this makes which have been
unearthed in Pretoria or in Johannesburg. About seven, I think.
As far as I know, the Criminal Investigation Department have
discovered none. The conspirators have discovered themselves.
However subtle the conspirator, however close-mouthed he is,
whatever secret signs and antics he indulges in when he meets a
brother conspirator, give that man a clean sheet of paper and a
"J" nib, and he will start discovering his plot to the world at
the rate of five folios a day. Who dares to question the wisdom
of free education? What warped mind sees in the Board school a
forcing house for criminals? Education is rapidly making some
crimes impossible; the crime of conspiracy is one. Pothooks and
hangers have rendered more service to the Criminal Investigation
Department than the best detective who has ever strolled through
Whitechapel in plain clothes and policemen's boots.</p>

<p>This new conspiracy of ours was discovered in Botha's laager
that time he departed hurriedly, leaving his hat and his revolver
behind him. That there was a conspiracy in Johannesburg there can
be no doubt. Well under the noses of the Criminal Investigation
Department a plot had been hatched, and a great scheme had been
perfected, and nobody was any the wiser. It was a pretty little
plot, and comprehended not only the delivery of Johannesburg into
the hands of the Boers, but a wholesale shooting of Rand Rifle
officers and the execution of certain public officials who were
in some degree obnoxious to the promoters. So clever was the
whole, thing, and so pleased were they with their ingenuity, that
they there and then sat down and wrote and told Botha all about
it.</p>

<p class="cp">WRITTEN WORDS REMAIN</p>

<p>They were charmingly frank; they told the Boer general what
they intended to do, and they proposed to do it, and give hint
full particulars regarding the names of the conspirators and a
list of the condemned officials. Botha, presumably got the
letter, and we can only guess at the satisfaction he got out of
its perusal. Some time afterwards a small British force swooped
down on the farm in which Botha had been staying, and the
Commandant-General left hurriedly, leaving behind him, as I have
said, and as you must know, for they have passed into history
with Mr Steyn's trousers, his hat and his revolver. Also his
private papers. And among them one of the ingenuous epistles
indited by the conspirators. It was not a very important letter,
however, except in so far as it betrayed its writer. The police
of Johannesburg were communicated with and the writer of the
letter was arrested, and his house searched. What was found?
What, but letters from other conspirators&mdash;I feel almost
inclined to put conspirators in inverted commas&mdash; and not
only these, but the lists referred to and the names of all those
implicated in the plot. So there was a general arrest, and those
people who cannot plot without a dictionary, or scheme without a
stylographic pen are lodged at the Charge Office.</p>

<p>It is all very silly, but it is all very dangerous. The humour
of the thing does not detract from the serious character of the
crime. I was never so much amused as I was by the delicate humour
of a lunatic who was once under my charge; but one night when I
went to visit him he chased me up the ward with a poker, all the
time shouting the funniest of japes&mdash;and I never appreciated
his humour after that. Broeksma wrote letters, dangerous letters,
letters that brought him to his death. He knew how dangerous they
were, and left them unsigned, or else adopted a fictitious name.
He took every precaution to keep the thing quiet; he quite
expected to be raided by the police, and yet he kept copies of
all his correspondence in an unlocked drawer! Show me a
conspirator, and I will show you a fool. The fool element has
entered into all these conspiracies. The plot to blow up Lord
Roberts. The plot to kidnap the Commander-in-Chief. In the latter
case Cordura apparently discussed the matter as freely as you and
I would discuss the theatre we proposed spending Boxing Night
at.</p>

<p class="cp">HOW BROEKSMA WAS CAUGHT</p>

<p>The conspirators have eliminated the romance from their plots.
There is nothing of the secret stab, the midnight outrage, the
death that comes from nowhere. They have touched nothing deeper
than the ridiculous. They are clowns juggling with death.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting stories I have heard is the story
of how Broeksma was detected. Broeksma was known to have been
bitterly anti-English, but he was not suspected of treachery.
Some time before Broeksma's arrest, the Kaffir "boy" of one of
the men implicated, a well-known doctor of Johannesburg, applied
to the pass officer for a permit to visit outside the lines,
saving that his master wanted him to go on an errand. The pass
officer, knowing the doctor, gave the boy the necessary permit,
and then later, wondering whether the doctor really did want the
boy to go, or whether the boy had merely lied to get the pass, he
resolved to call on the doctor and ascertain for himself. He
called, and found the doctor at home. No, he bad not told the boy
to get the pass; in fact, he knew nothing about it. The pass
officer asked to see the boy and was taken into the kitchen.
Questioned, the boy first denied that it was he who called, and
then denied that he had said the permit was for his master's
errand. Cautioned, he became first impertinent and then violent,
and was promptly knocked down by the pass officer after he had
attempted to throw a pot of boiling rice at the officer's head.
Assistance was procured and the boy was arrested. At the police
court, the doctor tried to get the boy acquitted, but he was sent
to prison for a month. The boy must have been some sort of agent
of Broeksma's, on whose service he was probably bound when he
procured the pass. This the doctor knew&mdash; he has since been
deported&mdash;and it was this that made him so anxious to obtain
the boy's release. You must not sell a Kaffir or desert him in
distress if he knows anything to your discredit; and while in
gaol the boy informed on Broeksma, with the result that
Broeksma's house was raided and his seditious pamphlets and
correspondence found.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="art51" name="art51">
THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS&mdash;A JUSTIFICATION</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), March 8,
1902</h3>

<p class="cp">THE REPORT OF THE LADIES' COMMISSION<br>
PRO-BOER EXAGGERATIONS</p>

<p>The Ladies' Commission, appointed at the instance of Miss
Hobhouse, has gone Home via Zanzibar and Suez, and from sources
other than the Commission itself I learn (writes Mr Edgar
Wallace, the Pretoria correspondent of the <i>Daily Mail</i>)
that it is very well satisfied with the condition of the camps
generally, and that such recommendations as it has been pleased
to make will be acted on immediately and before the publication
of its report. The Commission has been careful to inquire into
the specific charges laid against the British troops by Miss
Hobhouse, and was quite prepared to endorse any of Miss
Hobhouse's recommendations if the necessity of the case
demanded.</p>

<p class="cp">THE RECOMMENDATIONS</p>

<p>The following are the recommendations which the Commission
shows most inclination to endorse:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That such inhabitants of concentration camps should be
allowed to leave as</p>

<p>(a) Have friends and relatives in the Cape Colony, providing
such are not military suspects or have been convicted of high
treason or any breach of Martial Law regulations.</p>

<p>(b) Have means to support themselves at any seaport bases.</p>

<p>(c) Are separated from their children; in this case
opportunity will be given them to rejoin their families and live
away from the concentration camps, subject to conditions (a) and
(b).</p>

<p>2. Equality of treatment, whether the men of the family are
fighting, imprisoned, dead, or surrendered, as recommended by
Miss Hobhouse, has generally been meted out to the people of the
camps. The Commission has found, however, that the greatest
distinction is made by the Boer women themselves, the families of
the men still fighting or captured in the field having a profound
contempt for the "handsuppers," or the men who have voluntarily
surrendered, which dislike is extended to the men's families, and
indeed is often the cause of internal dissension.</p>

<p>3. The appointment of a resident or visiting minister having
access to the camp at all times has the approval of the
Commission. As far as possible such appointments were made at the
time of the formation of the camps, and very soon after they got
into working order every effort was made to fill up
vacancies.</p>

<p>4. The suggestion of Miss Hobhouse which has received most
support from the members of the Commission is No.7 of her
recommendations forwarded to the War Office at the suggestion of
the Secretary of State for War. This was to the effect that
"considering the congested state of the line, and the great lack
of fuel, any new camp formed would be in a healthy spot in Cape
Colony, nearer supplies and charitable aid." Few new "camps" have
been formed since the arrival of the Commission in the country,
but the Commission has endorsed Miss Hobhouse's recommendations
up to this point, that camps should be reduced as far as
possible, and that the removal of the refugees to places nearer
the coast, and within easier reach of the supply base, should be
carried into effect. It was ever a self-evident fact that every
principle of economy and expediency demanded the removal of these
concentration camps to places nearer the sea, and just now the
military are moving the people of the camps down the line at the
rate of several hundreds a day.</p>

<p class="cp">THE FINDING</p>

<p>Briefly, the following will be the finding Of the
Commission:&mdash;</p>

<p>The camps were rendered necessary by the peculiar conditions
under which warfare was being waged, and were formed for</p>

<p>(a) The protection of the families of surrendered burghers
from the retaliatory measures threatened by Louis Botha.</p>

<p>(b) The protection of women and children from wandering
natives.</p>

<p>(c) The distribution of food and creature comforts to people
who, by the denuding of the country of food, live stock, and
grain, rendered necessary by the exigencies of warfare, would
otherwise have been left to starve.</p>

<p class="cp">SANITARY CONDITION OF CAMPS</p>

<p>The Commission found that generally the sanitary condition of
the camps was good, and the mode of life in the camps, from an
hygienic point of view, distinctly in advance or the normal
conditions of life on the farm. With the object of verifying
statements that had been made to this effect by authorities on
the subject, the Commission paid visits to farms, and, as far as
possible, typical residences of backveldt farmers, occasionally
remaining overnight. The Commission further enquired into the
working of the camps at the date of which Miss Hobhouse wrote,
and is of opinion that, while undoubtedly the inmates of the
camps suffered inconveniences engendered by the unpreparedness of
the military to accommodate the large number of women and
children brought into the camps, the circumstances were
considerably exaggerated, and authentic cases of suffering were
few.</p>

<p class="cp">OF CHILDREN</p>

<p>Sentimentally, this was the most important question the
Commission had to deal with, and the greatest difficulty it had
to contend with was the total absence of any reliable statistics
dealing with mortality returns previous to the outbreak of war.
It is a well-known fact that the ignorant Boer had the greatest
objection to rendering any information to the Government
regarding his private affairs. In consequence the old mortality
returns were very unreliable, and, compared with those prepared
with conscientious accuracy by the medical officers in charge of
the camps, they appear to be remarkably light.</p>

<p>The Commission is inclined to believe that while the infant
mortality is undeniably heavy, and while it appears probable that
it has been slightly increased by an altered mode of living and
the strange conditions of camp life, yet a heavy infant mortality
is a feature of the Boer life.</p>

<p>I have merely sketched the outlines of the finding of the
Ladies' Commission, and have not attempted to go into such
details as the water supply of camps, the scarcity of fuel, the
unsuitability of diet, etc. It will be found that the
Commission&mdash; which need never have been appointed&mdash;has
reported favourably upon the conduct of the camps generally, and
that its recommendations are neither drastic nor
revolutionary.</p>

<h2><a id="art52" name="art52">IN BLOCKHOUSE STREET</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Southland Times</i> (New Zealand), March 12, 1902</h3>

<p>Distance is without significance to the railway traveller in
South Africa; time does not count. You reckon progress by meals
eaten and meals due. You do this from the very start. Thus two
hours' travelling means 44 miles accomplished, which equals
supper; 160 miles brings early morning coffee, 196 miles and
breakfast, 280 miles and lunch, 340 miles is afternoon tea, 420
is dinner, 500 is De Aar and midnight coffee. We are 12 hours
late, however, and last night's coffee is to-day's lunch.</p>

<p>Once more it is "right away," and De Aar, sweltering and a-
quiver in the heated air, lies behind, as turning sharp to the
left the train passes the first house in Blockhouse street. As a
corner house it should by every right bear the sign "The
Blockhouse Arms," or the "Bandolier Inn." But it does not. It is
a private house pure and simple. A very respectable house, too.
Evidently, a sort of bachelors' bungalow, for four or five nice
quiet-looking young men are standing at the front gate. One of
them has a gun in his hand -probably a sportsman of sorts. The
little house painted a sober buff stands in its own neat grounds.
There are no flowers, and the fence which encircles the plot is
of barbed wire, and would be, I should say, a considerable danger
to the strange wayfarer, for it seems almost impossible to
approach the house without failing over or entangling oneself
with not only the four-foot fence but a confused tangle of wire
which has been carelessly left by the builders, and which almost
entirely encircles the house.</p>

<p>The squat, hexagonal bungalow is evidently a well-ventilated
building, for all round it and at the height of a man's eye there
are little oblong slits, in all about 16. This is the first of
the houses, and at first you think it is standing in a very
lonely position, entirely apart from all structural fellows. Even
as the thought strikes you, you observe yet another building of a
similar colour a little further down the line.</p>

<p>In a minute or so the train brings you to it, and you see that
it is exactly like that which you have passed. Barbed fence, buff
building, loop-holes, and water tank exactly the same. Also,
there are the same six young men&mdash;or six remarkably like
those you have left behind at the last house. Also, one of them
has a gun. You wave a passing salute and chuck out a few papers
which the quiet young men scramble for, and throw your eye ahead
to see if there are any more of these desirable residence in
sight. Yes, there is another, perched this time on a little
kopje, the base of which the line skirts. A thousand yards and
you are abreast of it. Same house, same fence, same grave young
men waving their hands solemnly, same quickening to life as a
handful of papers sprawls earthward.</p>

<p>Then you realise that you are in a street&mdash;a street of
houses, each a thousand yards distant from its neighbour, and
each monotonously alike one to the other, each with the same
number of inmates. I do not notice till I have passed the third
house that there is generally one grave young man attending
industriously to something boiling on a fire. He is a greasy,
grimy individual, and lifts off a lid gingerly and peers
anxiously into the steaming contents. This is the cook of the
house, and his kitchen is a hole in the ground. Nor did I notice
till I had passed some distance down the street that between each
house and the next ran a fence of barbed wire ten strands deep.
Nor did I notice that at regular intervals along this fence were
placed ingenious contrivances, which looked from the saloon
window remarkably like spring guns. These were connected with
divers trip wires, and were evidently fixed with the idea of
giving intruders who strayed across the railway line a very bad
time.</p>

<p>Some of the little houses had names, Not, be it known, such
fanciful and meaningless things as "Fairlawn," or "The Elms," or
"Linda Vista," but such suggestive titles as "Terror of the
Night," and "Lonely Lodge," and "Bulldog Bungalow." And they are
not black-lettered on modest brass plate are these names, but
picked out on the blood-red veldt with stones as big as your
fist. For 70 miles we pass along this street, from De Aar to
Naauwport.</p>

<p>Beyond that, northward to Pretoria, another street runs for
seven hundred miles, eastward to Port Elizabeth for 270 miles,
north-eastwards to Queenstown for 300 miles, from Stormberg
Junction to Springfontein, 100 miles, and each with its
blockhouse every thousand yards and its barbed wire fence
between. From De Aar northward to Kimberley rune another street,
from Elandsfontein to Klerksdorp runs another, from Pretoria to
Komatipoort another, from Elandsfontein to Ladysmith yet
another.</p>

<p>This street we pass down now owes its origin to De Wet's Cape
Invasion. It is the base of a square, the left side of which runs
from De Aar to Orange River Station, the top side consisting of a
chain of blockhouses running from Orange River Station to
Norvalspont&mdash;it really runs on to the Basutoland
border&mdash;the right side from Naauwpoort to Norvalspont. To
return to our street. Here is the typical string that keeps in
check the wandering commando; here is the thin electric thread on
which are strung the dull squat beads, each od itself deadly to
the unsuspecting hand touching it. Blockhouse and fence, fence
and blockhouse.</p>

<p>Blockhouses sitting tightly on rocky spurs, blockhouses
squinting over rocky ramparts. Some crouching in hollow
<i>dongas</i> in a web of wire, like monstrous spiders waiting
patiently for burgher flies. Some open and unashamed in the full
glare of the pitiless sun by day or silhouetted against the stars
by night. Some cunningly placed on kopje sides, so that you
cannot tell from a distance which is kopje and which is
blockhouse. Some hanging over the edge of the everlastingly dry
river, some within handshake distance of the lean red bridges
that span it.</p>

<p>And before each the man with the gun. The man who brings his
rifle to the shoulder as the train spins past, and smiles like an
angel when you throw him a paper.</p>

<p>To-night a commando may attempt to rush the little post. To-
night rockets may rush skywards from a dozen blockhouses as a
commando changes its direction, and the man with the gun and his
friends who are catching flies inside may be fighting for their
very lives. Perhaps not to-night&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;or the
next night&mdash;or never! That is the horror of it all, the
constant watching for the enemy who will not come. Everlastingly
on the alert for events that will not happen. Waiting, waiting,
waiting, with a white-hot bowl of a sky overhead and a sizzling,
shimmering, dancing, blistering desert around.</p>

<p>Blockhouse street is a street to remember in your prayers, a
deadly, soul-destroying, damnably dull street of galvanised iron
prisons, in each of which are six prisoners waiting for
execution.</p>

<p class="cp">THE SKILL OF HOSPITAL 13</p>

<p class="cp">A SOUTH AFRICAN SKETCH</p>

<p>The doctor pulled up his horse, and with his whip indicated
the lean black smokestack that towered above its grimy fellows,
lifting its thin body high over entanglement of head-gear, great
untidy heaps of slag, and the hundred-and-one staggering,
sprawling, round-roofed buildings that go to justify a quotation
in the daily share list.</p>

<p>"That is the tallest chimney in the country," he said proudly,
"and the hospital's just the other side." There may or there may
not be occasion for inordinate pride in being even remotely
associated with the highest chimney stack in South Africa. That
his hospital is pitched on a goldfield, and that his tent-pegs
find other people's claim pegs reside side by side, and that
untold wealth is beneath and about him, must naturally be a
source of vague gratification to your Royal Army Medical
Colonel.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, somewhat of a drawback to be in command of a
hospital numbered thirteen, but superstition does not flourish in
the dissecting-room, and ere the budding medico has learned to
distinguish between scalpel and scapula, he spills salt with
impunity, and passes under ladders without a second thought. They
are proud of their hospital, the staff of No. 13. They have some
opinion of themselves and the little town they have won from the
veldt. They have a drainage scheme that works; they have an
electric light installation with a dynamo driven by their own
steam engine. All kinds of queer appliances for abolishing the
danger of infection. They have an operating theatre, which is a
picture; an orderliness and a cleanliness which are very
wonderful. An X-ray tent which is very dark, and a huge bull that
wanders round the outskirts of the hospital, who is reported to
be very mad. Perhaps it is unfair to credit No. 13 with, the
bull; he rightly belongs to the mining company on whose ground
the hospital is pitched. I am going to the operating theatre.</p>

<p class="cp">THE OPERATING THEATRE</p>

<p>Come with me. Atkins, wounded in Benson's fight, is to be
operated, on. Atkins, whom I had met earlier in the day, is not a
little proud of the importance of the impending event.</p>

<p>Indeed, in thinking over the events the recording of which go
to the making of this article, I am almost inclined to call it "A
Matter of Pride." Atkins is a typical Atkins, not of the Kipling
type, but truer still, the Pett-Ridge article&mdash;not that Mr.
Pett-Ridge writes soldier stories&mdash;and his anxiety seems
mainly to secure bits of the things that the surgeons will
extract from his arm in the course of their operations.</p>

<p>The operating theatre is a well-lighted room: windows all
round and overhead, great glass irrigators on portable stands,
glass tables with white porcelain bowls and trays and dishes.
Silver-bright sterilisers, a cupboard, its half dozen shelves
covered with instruments, all neatly arranged and laid out to
hand. Knives by the dozen; queer little saws that look like
knives, strange things like corkscrews, thin strips of steel
weirdly suggestive of button-hooks, dainty little centre-bits,
silver-mounted&mdash; altogether a pretty devilish sort of a kit
for the nerveless workmen who use it.</p>

<p>It will be a neat operation, this of Atkins. My friend
Beachnut&mdash;that is not his name&mdash;is to be the operator,
and the colonel holds a watching brief on behalf of Atkins. Also
there are a few other younger officers who will assist on behalf
of Atkins. All things being ready, the narrow, padded table that
stands in the centre of the room is prepared for the reception. A
glance round to see if all is right, and then comes the measured
tramp of men carrying something heavy.</p>

<p>The door opens, and Mr Atkins, reclining uneasily on a
stretcher, appears. Up the steps of the operating
theatre&mdash;carefully&mdash;stretcher level and no jolting,
please. No occasion for anxiety, for the men who handle the
handles of the machine&mdash;handles worn smooth from much
use&mdash;have done this thing a hundred times before, and there
is no novelty in it all. Nothing calculated to produce tremulous
awkwardness. Lift the stretcher on to the table&mdash;the padded,
waterproof covered table. Now, hands beneath the body,, palms
uppermost, all together&mdash;lift. A swift hand withdraws the
stretcher, and Atkins is on the table, a little nervous, a little
amused, and very uncertain of what is going- to happen next. The
bearers will withdraw. This they do, their stretcher now rolled
and strapped, in accordance with I don't know how many printed
regulations, and the door is closed.</p>

<p class="cp">SURGEON AND PATIENT</p>

<p>The operator smiles encouragingly at Atkins.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" he asks.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir; pretty shaky. Will it hurt?"</p>

<p>The surgeon eyes the damaged arm, which, bandaged and splinted
and pinned out of any resemblance to a human limb, lies across
the mans breast. He touches it gently, and lightly passes his
hand over the bandages.</p>

<p>"Not a bit; you won't feel anything. You will have a little
chloroform, and it will be all over in a minute."</p>

<p>There is no sign of hurry anywhere. The other surgeons look on
almost apathetically. No show of theirs, thinks Atkins,
brightening; they've only came to look on. Too many operators,
the least sign of anxiety on their part, any business-like
preparation&mdash;all these are bad for the man on the table,
Blessed with an imagination imperfectly matured, and measuring
the unknown against the standard of a very limited experience,
too much activity in the operation room is apt to remind him of,
let us say, a butcher's shop. And so everybody is more or less
apathetic, only one of the onlookers takes from a table a little
bottle half full of some crystal liquid, and toys with a nose-
shaped arrangement of gauze.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he says reflectively, "you were in Rimington's
fight, were you not?"</p>

<p>"Benson's, sir," corrects the patient; keeping an apprehensive
eye on the bottle.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, of course, Benson's. You were one of the gunners
that stood to the guns,"&mdash;the patient nods&mdash;"you did
very well, naturally; the R.A. have done splendidly&mdash;this
won't hurt you&mdash;I think I know some of your officers, and
very good chaps they are. Just breathe naturally and draw as much
of this stuff into your lungs as you can."</p>

<p>The sickening smell of "this stuff" fills the room as the
little bottle drips, drips, drips on to the inhaler held just
over the man's nose and mouth.</p>

<p>"You must have had a bad time&mdash;you need not answer me,
only just breathe&mdash;a very bad time; but that's all over now,
and we shall have you as right as a trivet&mdash;take a deep
breath, don't be afraid&mdash;we shall have you as right as a
trivet in a minute or two."</p>

<p>Atkins breathes long and deep; now his breathing ceases for a
second or so, but the hand of the surgeon presses heavily on the
breast, and the respiration is resumed. Drip, drip, drip, and
Atkins's eyes are half closed, and Atkins begins in a half-
mumbling, half-sleepy tone to complain to his girl of her
remissness in writing. She had promised to write every week, and
he hadn't heard for a month. Pretty fine girl she was. "Well,
anyhow," he grumbles on, in the tone of a man talking in his
sleep, with now and then a loud and angry word dying down to an
unintelligible mumble&mdash;well, anyhow, let bygones be...
mumble, mumble, mumble... Woolwich or Charlton... mumble,
mumble...</p>

<p class="cp">MANIPULATING THE STRINGS OF LIFE</p>

<p>Where are the apathetic young surgeons who had been taking a
bored sort of half-interest in the proceedings? Their coats are
off; their sleeves are rolled back, and the operator himself, my
brown-eyed major, stands before the instrument cupboard selecting
quaint-shaped things of steel and silver. No apathy now. These
men are alert and quick, and cunning of hand. Here they are, what
they really are&mdash;delicate manipulators of the strings of
life. Something glitters at the man's arm. Snip! The blue gauze
bandages fall apart. A pair of forceps. The dressing is dropped
into a bucket, and the man's arm lies bare. There is nothing to
sicken, nothing to offend. A bruised arm, somewhat inflamed, and
a little red hole where the bullet went. On the inner side of the
arm the wound is larger.</p>

<p>"Where's the photograph, Hime?"</p>

<p>The photograph is placed on the side table, and four heads
bend over it. It looks a very unsatisfactory sort of photograph
if the truth must be told. It looks lake the badily-printed
picture of an amateur's first landscape. It looks like a time-
exposure photograph of a moving object. Hold it one way and it is
a landscape with a misty kopje in the background. Hold it another
and it is a falling chimney. Look into it, and it is the X-ray
print of a badly shattered arm, with little specks of bone in
places where any anatomical student will tell you no bone ought
to be. Knives and forceps and sponges. Pretty little knives that
have surely strayed from my lady's manicure case. Bright little
forceps that would not be out of place on the "Marquis of
&mdash;&mdash;'s dressing table.</p>

<p class="cp">THE RETURN OF CONSCIOUSNESS</p>

<p>You need not watch the operation unless you care to, but it is
much less terrible to watch than to think about. Not enough
light. One of the surgeons leaves the table and touches a string
at the wall. A green blind that covers the skylight springs
noiselessly up, and you see everything. It is good to watch these
hands, probing, fingering, pressing. To see the busy little
forceps slipping in and out of the red wreckage, and each time
triumphantly and unfailingly reappearing with something that is
much better outside. How quickly it is all done! Before you can
get your thoughts consecutively marshalled the arm has been
fixed. Wires and needles and ugly little bull-dog forceps
clinging tightly. Then&mdash;"Sponge, orderly!" Then white wool,
and pink wool, and blue bandages, and a quick cleaning up of what
the lady novelist calls "tell-tale stains," and then,
consciousness for Private Atkins.</p>

<p>Consciousness that comes gently, heralded by much bad language
addressed to somebody at the Crystal Palace, who refuses to let
him. get into a first-class railway carriage. Open your eyes,
Private Atkins, it is all over. The apathetic gentlemen have put
on their coats again, and are even more apathetic than ever. The
white-haired colonel with the smiling red face is talking to you,
Atkins. How rude of you to go on mumbling threats against this
fantastic enemy of yours&mdash;a phantom enemy conjured up by the
crystal fluid in the little bottle. Then Atkins recovers, and is
surprised that it's all over, and the colonel wipes his hands and
says, "Come along and look over the hospital," for the colonel is
very proud of the hospital, as well he might be. As for me, I do
not see that he need go outside his operating-room to find
subject matter for pride, if the possession of the best qualities
of hand and eye and heart be such.</p>

STORYETTES OF WAR<br>
THE HUMOUROUS SIDE OF THE CAMPAIGN</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), April 17,
1902</h3>

<p class="cp">BLOEMFONTEIN, January 12, 1902</p>

<p>There are thousands of incidents of war which are not of
sufficient importance to cable, which do not fit in exactly in
one's weekly letters, which do hot make in the slightest degree
for history, but which, nevertheless, have an interest peculiarly
their own, which renders their exclusion from printed record a
sheer waste of good material.</p>

<p>There is nothing particularly lurid in these stories which I
wish to tell you here, and, indeed, this letter is less a
collection of short stories than a lazy recalling of incidents of
war that at the time struck me as being out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>For instance, I remember what seemed to me to be a remarkable
exhibition of those powers with which the lamented Sherlock
Holmes made us familiar which was exhibited by the staff officer
of one of the columns to which I had the good fortune to be
attached.</p>

<p class="cp">STAFF OFFICER AS SHERLOCK HOLMES</p>

<p>We were hot after De Wet in the Gape Colony, and there seemed
to be some doubt as to whether we were on the track of the main
body, or whether the wily Boer had detached a small party to lead
us off his track. Every farmhouse we passed told us the same
story&mdash;no Boers had passed as far as the owner knew.</p>

<p>It was a straight-forward answer given in every case; and the
fact that the farmer's forage was in every case untouched gave
some sort of credence to the story. At last we came to a farm;
and the staff officer rode up to the stoep and made the usual
inquiry. No; no Boers had passed nor stopped at the farm. The
staff officer picked up something from the ground and examined it
for a moment.</p>

<p>"Have you any peaches?" he asked at length. Yes, the farmer
had some peaches, and quickly produced some, very glad to be of
service to the officer and happy to supply his needs.</p>

<p>"Do you have a good crop of peaches every year?" was the next
question.</p>

<p>"Not such a good crop." was the reply, the farmer by no means
sorry to get off the embarrassing question of the passage of
Boers and on to the less dangerous topic of horticulture.</p>

<p>"Do you eat many yourself?" was the next question. No, they
were all prepared for market.</p>

<p class="cp">TELL-TALE PEACH-STONES</p>

<p>The officer thought a while, then, said to the astonished
farmer: "Last night a large body of Boers came to your house and
asked for food. You had none, but you entertained them as well as
you could with the best you had to offer."</p>

<p>The farmer for a time protested innocence but eventually
admitted that something of the sort had occurred. Asked
afterwards how he had arrived at the truth of the story, the
staff officer pointed to some over-ripe peaches which had been
half bitten through and thrown away, and to a perfect litter of
peachstones in front of the farmer's stoep.</p>

<p>"I could see," he said, "that somebody had been having a royal
feast of peaches; an as the man said that neither he nor his
family ate the fruit, it was evident somebody else had, and a
good many somebodies too. Look at these rotten peaches; nobody
would bite these except in the dark, so it is evident that the
visitors called after sundown. A man who derives a certain amount
of his income from the sale of peaches does not usually offer any
amount to even his friends, and the inference is that the peaches
were given in place of some more substantial food demanded by the
visitors."</p>

<p>Equally successful, though the task was certainly far easier,
was the attempt of an irreverent and junior subaltern who,
lighting upon an old camping ground, saw in a dozen empty
champagne bottles and a few dozen <i>p&acirc;t&eacute; de foi
gras</i> pots traces of a certain crack cavalry regiment, and in
an abandoned chest-protector indication of a general staff.</p>

<p class="cp">KITCHENER STORIES</p>

<p>Naturally enough, Lord Kitchener is the centre of more than
one very good story. Asked by one of his staff whether he did not
regard the mobile columns under his command as the backbone of
his army, he replied laconically, "Yes, they are what one might
call spinal columns."</p>

<p>Few people are aware of the extent to which Lord Kitchener
"hustles" his own columns. No sooner does a column return from
trek and report its arrival in town than a wire something like
the following arrives from the chief. "When will you be ready to
go out again?" The following morning along comes another wire,
"Why are you waiting?" followed a few hours afterwards by "Why
have you not left?"</p>

<p>Then it is that the column commander, preferring the deadly
sniper to the relentless man in Pretoria, hastens to get himself
out of range of the telegraph wire.</p>

<p>A short time ago a well-known cavalry regiment arrived at Cape
Town and hastened to disembark. The disembarkation was carried
out successfully, and the regiment was quartered by nightfall at
Green Point Camp. Early the next morning came a "clear the line "
message from "K." "I hope you are exercising your horses and men.
I shall want you almost immediately." To this the commanding
officer replied,. "Propose exercising horses and men all day
long."</p>

<p>There was an interval of two hours, then "K.'s" second message
came to hand: "What do you propose doing at night?"</p>

<p class="cp">WELL EXPRESSED</p>

<p>Another personality that figures perhaps in more stories than
any other soldier is General T&mdash;&mdash;, whose vocabulary,
extensive and peculiar, is the subject of many stories.</p>

<p>In the general advance towards Pretoria one of the most
polished of our generals, I seeing a solitary horseman riding
about under a heavy fire, sent an orderly to tell "that fool" to
get under cover if he did not wish to be shot. The orderly
returned with the information that he had delivered his message,
and that the horseman had said many weird, things, among which
was the intelligence that he was General T&mdash;&mdash; .</p>

<p>The polite general was pained that he had made the mistake,
and asked the Orderly whether General T&mdash;&mdash; was much
offended. "Much offended; sir!" said Atkins gleefully; "why, he
told me to go to &mdash;&mdash;, that is to say, sir, he said
<i>you</i> were&mdash;well] to tell you the truth, sir, I
couldn't 'ave said it better meself!"</p>

<p>General T&mdash;&mdash; is a stickler for discipline, and
during his term of command in one of the big Free State towns, he
gave strict orders that officers arriving at the station should
report themselves either personally to him, or to his staff
officer, or to his A.D.C.</p>

<p>His staff officer at the time was a gentleman by no means
favoured of nature in the matter of good looks, added to which he
was a man of morose and taciturn disposition. The A.D.C. was a
gilded youth with a drawl and a vacant stare.</p>

<p class="cp">TRUE TO LIFE</p>

<p>There arrived in the town commanded by the general an officer
of one of the Bushman Corps, rough of language and fearless of
gold lace.</p>

<p>It happened he was taking a morning liquor at the club when
the general entered and was passing through the room in which the
Colonial stood, when he noticed that the Australian's face was
unfamiliar.</p>

<p>"Hi, you, sir," he roared, "who the devil are you?"</p>

<p>The Colonial rose and saluted. "Captain J&mdash;&mdash;, sir,"
he replied, "3rd Victorians."</p>

<p>"When did you arrive?" demanded the general.</p>

<p>"Yesterday, sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Why have you not reported yourself to me, sir?" demanded
T&mdash;&mdash;, adding a rider condemnatory to his listener's
visual organs.</p>

<p>The Colonial was riled. "I went to your office; you were not
in, but I saw two officers."</p>

<p>"Who were they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know their names," said the Colonial.</p>

<p>"Describe them, then," said General T&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Well, said the Colonial desperately, for he had no gift of
language, "one was an ugly looking devil with a beastly
temper&mdash;"</p>

<p>Good," interrupted T&mdash;&mdash;, "that's my staff
officer."</p>

<p>"And the other," continued the Australian, "was a silly ass of
a chap with an eyeglass."</p>

<p>"Right you are, my boy," said the satisfied general, "the
idiot's my A.D.C. Sorry to have troubled you."</p>

THE NIGHT OF THE DRIVE&mdash;IN A BLOCKHOUSE</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), April 26,
1902</h3>

<p>It was Smithy&mdash;Smithy who had been up to Wolverhoek with
the escort for a few tame burghers&mdash;who brought back the
news, and the blockhouse rejoiced thereat.</p>

<p>Smithy with his own eyes had seen it. First a puffing,
clanking, rushing pilot engine slipping over the rise from
Viljoen's Drift. A pilot engine hurrying desperately, and slowing
only that the grimy driver might clutch from the extended hand of
the stationmaster his travelling orders. Then the pilot engine
had rumbled on, and in its wake came another smoky speck, also
very much in a hurry. Not a pilot engine this, but a little train
with guard's van, two saloons, some armoured trucks, and some
very important Highlanders scanning the horizon for hostile
Boers.</p>

<p class="cp">A GLIMPSE OF "K."</p>

<p>And in one of the saloons, with pince-nez on nose and a
wicked-looking cigar bitten between square jaws, a man whom
Smithy did not recognise, partly because his photographic
presentments are remarkably unlike, and partly because the view
was fleeting. A man sitting before a table littered with papers,
heavy-eyed, grey, forbidding, aged almost. A face difficult to
describe, except that it was a strong face, an inscrutable face.
Smithy never saw him smile or Smithy would have been charmed, for
"K." has a pleasing smile, a smile that has almost made me regret
six chapters of a monumental work of mine. Smithy did not
recognise him, but the obliging postmaster told him, and Smithy
brought the news back to blockhouse on the other side of
Heilbron, and the blockhouse rejoiced, for the men, the common
men, who do not analyse policies nor criticise methods, but only
just love a man for the sake of his manhood&mdash;to these people
Lord Kitchener's presence is very helpful.</p>

<p>So tonight&mdash;really last night&mdash;Smithy's five pals we
very happy in the belief that something was going to happen.
Vague hints have come from Heilbron&mdash;whispers of great
movements somewhere eastward of the rolling hills, of driving
columns, of 10,000 mounted beaters searching the cover, promises
of De Wet's capture and the destruction of his commando, have all
helped to stimulate an atmosphere already overcharged with
excitement; and now the great Lord K. himself has arrived to
superintend.</p>

<p class="cp">IRON GIRDLE</p>

<p>No sleep for any of the blockhouse people to-night. The Boers
must on no account be allowed to pass through the blockhouse
lines, otherwise what is the use of Rawlinson with his twenty-
five hundred men, and Rimington (tiger-skin, pugareed hat and red
scarf knotted carelessly around neck, one can almost see the sun-
scorched, wild-seamed face staring westward through the
darkness), and Elliott and Byng? They form a sixty-mile line, and
move so that the left flank of the one column touches the right
flank of the other; a slowly moving press slipping down the sides
of the blockhouse lines. Nothing can pass the driving columns by
day. Nothing can break through the entrenched pickets by night.
On the blockhouse lines must come the strain, and the blockhouses
learn this tonight, first from a few clearly expressed,
uncompromising words from the man in the saloon carriage was up
the line, and them from Johnny Boer himself.</p>

<p>No sign of the enemy so far. The sun sinks, and the shadow of
the little tin fort lies half way to Frankfort. No sign of Boers.
It might be a sunset on the peaceful uplands of another land, so
golden and still is the land. The east is a steely blue, and a
deeper blue, and a filmy grey, and a bluish black; and then, save
for a high floating strip of orange in the west and a star or so
twinkling weakly through.the nimbus, the world is dark. The
corporal consults his watch by the aid of a lantern. Half-past
eight.</p>

<p>You are well into the first act by then, are you not? There
are cabs dropping people at Prince's and picking up people at the
Carlton, and there are late-comers treading on people's toes in
Drury Lane. Very vexatious indeed. Smithy remembers a night he
was chucked out of the "Brit" over a trifling trouble arising
from such a matter. A six-foot navvy admonished for his
carelessness had made improper references to the size of Smithy's
feet. They are not very much in the humour for anecdote, these
highly-strung friends of Smithy, and in the crude, homely
vernacular that obtains in the barrack-room, they intimate as
much. Not that Smithy minds very much; he is not offended, and
would continue, but the corporal says two words, and my garrulous
friend is silent.</p>

<p class="cp">WAITING</p>

<p>Hours pass, and the night is black. If anything, the earth is
blacker, and the difference between the two blacknesses is the
difference between a soot-bag and a velvet pall. Hours pass;
sixty seconds make one minute; sixty minutes one hour; there are
three thousand six hundred seconds in an hour, and a second is
quite a long time when you are waiting for something to happen.
Twelve &ouml;'clock now. Suppers, last trains and trim broughams
at stage-doors. Perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>What is that?</p>

<p>From the west a long, thin, ribbon of white unrolls swiftly.
Not a ribbon, either, but an unopened fan of rigid light. Now it
moves backward and forward. Now it sinks and sweeps, along
somewhere out of sight, the silhouetted hillocks, their crests in
a halo of light, alone giving indication of the beam's direction.
An armoured train somewhere between Wolverhook and Kroonstad. Its
searchlight is playing on the great net into which De Wet is
being driven. Then&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">"THERE THEY ARE!"</p>

<p>Can you imagine a hum staccato? Or a short, chesty grunt? That
is what it sounded like. Armoured train again, and this time
working its quick-firing gun. See, the searching light is now
steadfast. <i>Domp</i>! There goes the gun again, <i>domp!</i>
and again, and yet and yet again, then silence and the light
goes. Darkness once more on the veldt, but not for long. Quite
close at hand from the Heilbron fort leaps one straight purple
flash, and then a bang that shakes the earth.</p>

<p>Now, blockhouse, it is your turn! There is nothing to fire at,
but fire into the net. Crackle, crackle, crackle up and down the
line. Flash, flash, flash at intervals of a thousand yards.
Tonight is a Brocks benefit, a fireworks display of unprecedented
grandeur, only the Boers have not come, apparently. Pray Heaven,
says Smithy, in so many words that they have not gone in another
direction. There are some near at hand, for two miles away a
rocket sails slowly skyward and bursts. The Boers are at hand.
Perhaps a commando, possibly a hundred, more likely fifty. Who
knows, it may be De Wet himself with the proverbial handful of
men. The musketry fire crackles incessantly, and the naval gun
bangs intermittently, but the blockhouses on either side of the
fellow who sent up his warning rocket are looking carefully into
the night. Smithy's corporal gives few commands, but they are
much to the point. Suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"There they are!"</p>

<p>A black, bulky mass is sweeping over the plain between the
forts. On they come, forty or fifty of them, heedless of the
rifle fire, heedless of the rocket that hisses aloft, forgetful
of everything except that outside the line lies freedom. Oh the
mad, mad clatter of hoofs and the unswerving, blind dash on the
the wire entanglements! Crash! The tinkle and rattle of iron
against iron. The fence is down, and so is many a man and horse,
for the blockhouses fire steadily, and the stink of cordite fills
the little chambers, and the wail of bullets fills the air! Bang!
-And the big gun is dropping shells in the direction of the
desperate fugitives. They are over the fence and away; they are
galloping madly to cover again. They at least have got through
the iron girdle, leaving a few behind by the broken fence where
the squealing horses lie. Just a few; we shall pick them up and
bury them with the respect and homage which gallant men deserve
of gallant men.</p>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Poverty Bay Herald</i> (New Zealand), May 5, 1902</h3>

<p class="cp"><i>Daily Mail</i>, April 3, 1902</p>

<p>We print to-day an important despatch from Mr Edgar Wallace
dealing with the situation created by the Boer peace overtures.
Our war correspondent carefully abstains from exaggerated
optimism, but, despite the natural note of caution in his
remarks, it is clear that there is, as the <i>Daily Mail</i> has
consistently pointed out for some days past, ground for hope
that, with careful handling of the Boer susceptibilities, a
satisfactory outcome of the negotiations may be arrived at. We
also print the chief points on which the negotiations will
probably turn.</p>

<p class="cp">KROONSTAD (0.R.C.), Monday, March 31, 1902</p>

<p>The Boer peace delegates are still here, and the situation is
unchanged. In the meantime our columns are working with
undiminished energy, and the Boer negotiations have not resulted
in the least relaxation in any quarter of the vigor with which
the war is being prosecuted.</p>

<p>In continuation of my telegram from Johannesburg yesterday, I
may state that while it is by no means certain that the peace
negotiations are likely to terminate satisfactorily, yet there
are certain points which need urging in respect of a possible
settlement.</p>

<p>Many of the conditions of surrender of earlier days are now
overshadowed by larger and more important considerations. It is
possible that the question of the amnesty of all rebels may prove
not so important as such questions, for instance, as the
establishment of responsible government after the war, and a
general surrender of the Boer troops now in the field may
possibly be retarded by fear on the part of the burghers, who are
naturally most suspicious, that Great Britain does not intend to
grant to them equal eights with British-born subjects. The
burghers fear that Great Britain intends to make the Boers a sort
of subject race. This fear, I think, will be a great factor in
influencing the action of the commandoes in the field, and I
should say that, should anything come from the present
negotiations, a definite assurance from England, specifically
stating the Boers' status after the war, will assist in clearing
away a great obstacle.</p>

<p>Added to this, it must be remembered that our terms are now,
as ever, "unconditional surrender," and should the Boer chiefs
favour this view, they have still to justify themselves before
the commandoes. The promise of an early restoration of
responsible government would be sufficient justification. Those
unaware of the Boer character will probably take such a promise,
which is merely one we certainly intend to fulfil, to be
superfluous, but, however unnecessary the assurance may be
considered at home, it is undoubtedly important here.</p>

<p class="cp">POINTS AT ISSUE</p>

<p>We believe the following are among the chief points on, which
any peace negotiations will turn:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The approximate time which must elapse before the
restoration of responsible government is possible.</p>

<p>2. The status of the Boers after the war.</p>

<p>3. The banishment proclamation.</p>

<p>4. The question of amnesty.</p>

<p>To these may be now added the following most important
one:&mdash;</p>

<p>Advances by the British Government for rebuilding and
restocking Boer farms.</p>

<h2><a id="art57" name="art57">THE BACKBONE OF THE ARMY</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Southland Times</i> (New Zealand), May 27, 1902</h3>

<p>Who has heard about the sergeant since the war started? Who
has remembered the "backbone of the Army" we once heard so much
about? The sergeant is not an officer as you know officers; he is
not a Tommy Atkins in the strict sense of the word. He forms the
bourgeoise of the army; he is the medium between the brain and
the hand, and possessed of both himself. Officially he is not the
directing force; officially he does not work himself, but
oversees the working of others. As a matter of fact, he more
often directs than does his officer, and works just as hard, and
a sight more conscientiously than the private. In barracks and at
home he is the autocrat of the barrack-square; he is a well-
brushed, clean-shaved, pipe-clayed individual who turns up on
parade at seven in the morning as well groomed as though he were
dressed for an evening party. The recruits who have been turned
out of their beds with reluctance, and are half asleep and
unshaven&mdash;there is seldom an inspection on the early morning
parade&mdash;eye him with wonder and suspicion, and speculate on
the hour the sergeant rises, for smartness on the early morning
parade is to them an uncanny thing.</p>

<p>He is a person who inspects the barrack room before the
arrival of the orderly officer. He is a person who inspects the
company on parade before the arrival of the company officer: who
checks the kits of the men before the arrival of the commanding
officer; who stands for ever between the officer and the man. To
the officer he is a superior private; to the men he is an
inferior officer; to both he preserves an equability of temper
and an evenness of treatment.</p>

<p>This is the ideal sergeant, and in no rank or department of
life does the subject keep closer to the ideal than in the case
of the non-commissioned officer of the British Army. Of course
there are fools of sergeants, just as there are fools of
commissioned officers, and idiots of privates, and&mdash;Heaven
forgive us&mdash; blithering war correspondents. The exception
is, however, to find a really incompetent N.C.O.; nor is this to
be wondered at, since, moving between the Scylla of the mess-room
and Charybdis of the barrack-room, he must needs steer a careful
and efficient course if he wishes to float to that pension which
is his best summer isle. To some extent the sergeant has sunk his
identity since he has arrived in South Africa. In the first place
he wears no chevron on his arm, except in some cases when the
chevron is khaki and unnoticeable. Carefully bound round the
shoulder strap is that chevron, and you would pass nine out every
ten sergeants you met with no other thought than, "That's a fine-
looking, well-seasoned old soldier."</p>

<p>What has the non-commissioned officer done since he has been
in South Africa? Nothing, if one may judge by the reference to
his work that one can find in the daily press. And yet what has
he not done? Officers' work, leading, commanding, encouraging.
Tommies' work, working, fighting, enduring. There has been no
piece of work, however fine, however noble, however heroic, that
has not been performed as well by Sergeant Somebody-or-other as
it was by Captain Somebody-else. There has been no hardship
splendidly borne and lightly dismissed by Tommy that has not been
as silently endured and as quickly forgotten by the sergeant.
Quick to fill his fallen officer's place, as quick to step back
into the ranks to fill the gap rendered by the fallen Tommy;
watchful, alert; now encouraging, now bantering, now judiciously
swearing, he never fails to bring his men up to the scratch; the
men unconscious of the influence he holds over them; his officers
generally insensible to what they owe him for the discipline of
their men.</p>

<p>In South Africa, to all appearances, there is no greater
nonentity than the sergeant. In the first place, one seldom meets
him; in the second, one does not recognise him when met. Then,
again he is thrown still further into the background by the
legion of officers engaged in the war. Every second man one
meets, whether it be in Johannesburg or in Capetown, or in
Pretoria, has stars or crown upon his shoulder cord, so that one
insensibly gets to think about the sergeant as an ordinary Tommy,
of the same class, and of the same military value. As a matter of
fact, this is quite an erroneous view to take. So far as the
actual military value of the men is concerned we could very well
dispense with the services of six officers of the type one meets
in the big cities for every one sergeant. One good sergeant, from
a strict utilitarian aspect is worth forty newly-joined
subalterns.</p>

<p>A distinguished Australian officer told me a few months ago
that his ideal regiment was a corps of Australians, officered by
good sergeants of British infantry. "The men to officer
Australians," he said, "must be men who know their work, know how
to command other men, be perfectly capable of maintaining
discipline without irritating the men by adopting tin-goddish
airs."</p>

<p>At no period of the campaign has the sergeant played a more
important part than at the present stage. For now it is that the
blockhouse system is reaching a point of perfection, and the
sergeant finds himself in as responsible a position as he has
ever filled. The blockhouses are garrisoned as far as possible by
as many Guards, Line and Militia battalions as can be spared from
the actual striking or aggressive army, and with one battalion
strung out over thirty miles of railway, it is obviously
impossible for an officer to be left in charge of every post. It
devolves, therefore, upon the sergeants to take command of these
posts, and "stripey," as they call him in the marines, takes up
his new position of commander-in-chief of No. 777 Blockhouse as a
matter of course, and without any feeling that he is doing
anything out of the ordinary. His responsibilities are heavy, his
duties the dreariest imaginable. If anything goes wrong, if a
Boer commando cuts the barbed wire fence that connects his
blockhouse with the next, and succeeds in crossing the line he
holds, he will be tried by court-martial, and in all probability
be reduced. Not being an officer, he cannot buttonhole his
colonel and explain things away, and if he is tried&mdash;as he
certainly will be&mdash;the members of the court will be neither
his mess-mates nor men of his caste. He will grind, endure, and
suffer; perhaps he will contract enteric fever and die; perhaps
he will be shot to death by an enraged commando that has failed
to force his line, and turns its attention and its Mausers on the
littla yellow pepper-box of a blockhouse.</p>

<p>Perhaps he will come through the campaign all right, and in a
year or two will be back on the depot square with white cotton
gloves and a pacing-stick, teaching recruits to look like men. He
will be still plain Sergeant Somebody, unless his seniors are
dead or discharged, and he will be neither D.S.O. nor C.M.G., nor
a brevet-colour-sergeant, or hold any of the glorious positions
that his officer will hold, or wear any of the beautiful
decorations that his officer will wear. He expects nothing from
the war&mdash;promotion, honour, or decoration. The song of the
poet shall not praise him&mdash;for what inspiration has poet
ever found in the bourgeoise? He does not expect the leader-
writer to remember him, or the general to pick him out for
distinction when despatches come to be written. And yet our
sergeant is so often the saviour of the situation; so often the
snatcher of victory; so often the man who did the thing. A
century has passed, bringing many changes, upsetting many hoary
traditions, exploding many fat, comfortable theories. It has left
one tradition untouched&mdash;the sergeant is still the backbone
of the British army.</p>

HOME AGAIN&mdash;THE END OF A PERIOD</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Thames Star</i> (New Zealand), September 20, 1902</h3>

<p>Even as unrelenting fate, so does Smithy dog my footsteps. I
leave him at Heilbron guarding stores; and two days later his
strident voice hails me somewhere between Potchefstroom and
Klerksdorp with a demand for "'pipers." I was not surprised,
therefore, on boarding the good ship <i>Dunottar Castle</i> to
discover the pensive Smithy&mdash;no longer a common soldier, but
officer's servant with right to wear mufti&mdash;holding-forth to
a <i>confr&egrave;re</i> on the blessings of home life as
compared with life on the veldt, Kitchener as a strategist, and
De Wet as a fighter.</p>

<p>"'Ome! Think of it, cocky," said, Smithy, ecstatically, "no
more trek, no more biscuit an' beef, no more De Wettin', but
breakfast in bed, and a pub at every corner!"</p>

<p class="cp">ALL OF THEM HAPPY</p>

<p>There were 380 Smithies on board, not all as eloquent, as my
friend, but every man as happy. I watched them troop inboard from
the vantage place of the upper deck. Tanned, hardened, wiry
little men, released from work, released from school&mdash;that
hard, hard school where the art of taking cover and sleeping
comfortably in the rain is taught in the kindergarten stage. And
they were going back to England. "Think of it!" To England, where
you people live and work and play without ever thinking you are
doing wonderful things in a wonderful country. It was their
reward that they might be allowed to do and be what you are
doing, and what you have been unconscious of&mdash;your blessed
privileges.</p>

<p>There was a man on the quarterdeck in khaki, with heavy gold
lacing on the peak of his cap. A nice, comfortable, handsome
gentleman, a little inclined to stoutness. The Tommies on board
did not know him because they had never served under him. Smithy
knew him, and communicated the news to the troop deck, and four
days out Smithy, acting as a sort of deputation, from "forrard,"
waited on me with the question, "Is Charley Knox goin' to get a
big reception at Southampton?"</p>

<p>I opined not, and Smithy was bitter. "'Cos 'e ain't made a
song about what 'e's done like &mdash;&mdash;" said Smithy. The
general officer he mentioned I would not for the world name.</p>

<p class="cp">DOESN'T ADVERTISE</p>

<p>"Can't you put something in the paper about 'im?" asked
Smithy, almost tearfully, for the men who served under Knox are
very jealous for their general. I promised. Will you kindly
insert this?</p>

<p class="note">General Sir Chas. Knox, K.C.B., is the best of
our younger generals. He has won his way to the honors that have
been bestowed upon him by courage, endurance, and high military
qualities...</p>

<p>He doesn't care twopence for the buttering of newspaper
correspondents, and as the truth would sound like fulsome
flattery, I will refrain, my dear Smithy, from pursuing the
subject. Suffice that he captured more guns than any other
general, and never got his portrait into a biograph series. There
were other men of the Knox stamp on board, and their occupations
were various. Capper, for instance. You know Capper, who flogged
the rebels back from the edge of Capetown. Capper spent his time
in taking the sun with a sextant and working out impossible
longitudes. Once, off Sierra Leone, he made the alarming
discovery that we were thirty miles inland!</p>

<p class="cp">THE OTHERS THERE</p>

<p>Then there was Ewart&mdash;Colonel in the Army and kindly
gentleman wherever to be. Ewart in canvas slippers, doing nothing
in particular; reading a little, talking a little, is not the
Ewart I saw in December 1899, bringing back the battered ranks of
the Highland Brigade from Magersfontein, the man who that early
morning groped blindly forward in the dark, lit only by the
threads of fire that darted from the Boers' front trenches and
the fitful summer lightnings behind the looming kopjes. Not the
Ewart that stumbled in the trenches seeking his dying chief what
time Wauchope fell among his Highlanders. A strange change this
from that horrible field, bleak, sodden, carpeted with writhing
men, stinking with cordite, and humming with bullets, to this
graceful ship slipping so easily over the sunny seas.</p>

<p>Here is a man in pince-nez gravely bending over a chess-board.
He was with Methuen at Tweebosch, and could tell you things about
irregular cavalry. His opponent was a prisoner of De Wet, and
lived on mealie pap for two months. He, at any rate, is not an
enthusiastic pro-Boer.</p>

<p>Burly and bluff, a typical country gentleman, Spens revives
the glory of Hampshire, cricket with am oakum ball on a 20ft.
pitch. Private soldier and general officer, company officer and
junior subaltern, their work is done, and how well done!</p>

<p class="cp">"SOMETHING LIKE HOME"</p>

<p>It is home! A chilly enough morning, with low-lying land on
the port bow, and a yellow light glaring intermittently from a
slip of land to starboard. A hundred snowy seagulls sailing
placidly in the wake of the ship&mdash;a feathery escort for the
homeward-bound warriors who flock to the side and to the fo'c'sle
head for a glimpse of green. The engines slow and stop&mdash;a
dead stillness and then a shiver from bow to stern as they are
reversed. A little boat dances over the grey waters, a little
boat with a yellow light, and a rope ladder drops over our side.
A silence, and then again the beat of the propeller&mdash;the
pilot is aboard. And so past the Needles, white and solemn in the
early light. The channel narrows, and half speed becomes quarter
speed. Houses on both banks and tiny yachts lying at anchor till
a bend brings in view a dozen l steam yachts lying bow to stern,
and in the centre a black two-funnelled vessel of peculiar shape.
A man-o'-war, squat and aloof. A black, flat mass of metal
brooding on the waters. In her shadow another ship. A large
yacht&mdash;black, too, with three masts. Three masts that fly
three flags. We move abreast, and swing round to port. Down comes
our ensign slowly&mdash;we are dipping a salute to the black
yacht. Through your glasses you see the flag she flies. It is the
Royal Standard, and Atkins gazes with reverence. Smithy touches
my elbow. "This is something like home," he whispers, huskily.
"Good old England! I&mdash;I wonder how the King is?"</p>

<h2><a id="art59" name="art59">
BACK FROM THE WAR<br>
THE RETURN OF SMITHY</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), September 20,
1902</h3>

<p>I told Smithy I would call upon him as soon as I had got
(settled in London, so on Sunday I went down Bow way.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that I should arrive at five minutes after
one. Montague (this is Smithy's Christian name) had just this
very minute gone out, said Smithy's mother, apologetically. A
friend had called to see him, and he had just stepped round the
corner. Oh, no&mdash;the fact that his departure had synchronised
with the hour of the opening of the "Bear and Man" had absolutely
nothing to do with it. Would I wait?</p>

<p class="cp">WHERE HE LIVES.</p>

<p>I would, and the door of the front parlour having been
unlocked, the blind drawn up, and an antimacassar removed, I was
left to admire a cheap engraving of the Crucifixion, flanked on
either side by portraits of Smithy's ancestors&mdash; somewhat
faded about the clothing, but remarkably distinct about the hands
and beards; while Smithy's little brother was despatched to find
my friend. Smithy's small brother received his whispered
instructions in the passage, and Smithy's young brother, in the
innocence of his heart, repeated his instructions with audible
hoarseness.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother&mdash;no, mother&mdash;all right, mother: a
gentleman waitin' for 'im, an' e' must come at once, an' 'e can
go back an' 'ave 'is drink afterwards, an' don't tell the
gentleman 'e's bin in a pub, an' not to bring any of 'is low
friends back with 'im&mdash;an' say 'e's bin out visitin' 'is
friends."</p>

<p>And so Smithy's brother went on his errand speeded by the
shrill assurances of Mrs Smithy that if he didn't hurry up she'd
knock his blooming little head off. After this dreadful threat
Mrs Smithy came to entertain me. Having apologised for (1)
Smithy's absence; (2) her untidiness; (3) the disorder of the
"front room"; (4) the state of the weather; (5) the poverty of
the neighbourhood; (6) the people next door; (7) her
widowhood&mdash;"Mr Smithy dead an' gorn these twelve years, when
Monty was so 'igh"&mdash;my hostess proceeded to Smithy's
homecoming.</p>

<p class="cp">EXPERIENCES OF HERBERT EVANS</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, very glad to see him. What with enteric and
blockhouses an' one thing an' another, I never expected to see
him again. Well, he's finished' now, thank the Lord, and now he's
got to start and find some work to do. You can't get your living
by bein' an 'ero, can you, sir? Before Monty went away he had a
very good job. He was earnin' his thirty-five a
week&mdash;regular. That job's lorst. His master was very good, I
must say. He allowed me half his pay for twelve months, but even
a master-man's got to live, ain't he? The War Office? Bah! Stuff
and nonsense, I call the War Office. No, sir, Monty's got to find
some employment to work at. You can't, as I say, live on
your&mdash;your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Military reputation?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"That's it. I remember a young feller by the name of 'Erbert
'Evans that belonged to the people over the road&mdash;the house
with the brass plate&mdash;very respectable people, too. He come
home in the early part of the war, invalided from Ladysmith. You
should have seen the fuss they made of that young man. They tell
me that up in the City he was carried round the streets by real
gentlemen with high hats on. When he came outside his door in the
morning, dressed in the khaki that he brought home with him,
people used to take him into the 'Bear' and treat him to anything
he wanted. Beer, beer, beer all the morning&mdash;he might have
been a member of Parliament the way they treated him. Well, by
an' by people got tired of treating 'him, and he used to leave
off wearing of khaki, and wearing a big South African hat with
his civilian clothes. Then he took to cadging pennies, and people
started wondering when he was going to get some work to do."</p>

<p class="cp">TOO MUCH "SHERBET"</p>

<p>"Then somebody said they didn't "believe he was ever in
Ladysmith at all, and he used to have a fight every night, till
the landlord of the 'Bear' got him run in for creating a
disturbance. He got let off with a caution, and he left the
neighbourhood. He got into trouble in Hoxton, and got six months.
It upset his poor old mother dreadful&mdash;she is highly
respectable. You can see the brass plate on the door as you go
past."</p>

<p>"You don't want Smithy to be heroised?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I'd like him to be an 'ero for a week; after that
I'd like him to work for his living."</p>

<p>Enter Smithy. Very sorry he was out, Smithy was. Hoped he
hadn't kept me long, Smithy did. Couldn't understand what made
him forget I was coming, could Smithy. And what sort of a time
had he had? Strangely enough, his opinions coincided with those
of his mother.</p>

<p>"Time of my life," he said, with a considerable sigh, "but too
much 'sherbet'; it was all right the first day or two&mdash;but
it&mdash;what's the word?&mdash;yes, palls. I used to think that
old Bobs was a bit too particular about booze, but, Lord! it
makes you tired! 'Ave a drink&mdash;'Ave one with
me'&mdash;'What's yours?' from morning to night."</p>

<p>I think Smithy was genuine, but I was surprised, I admit.</p>

<p>"Time of my life, all the same. See me walkin' down the
street, an' 'ear the girl next door say 'Come quick, mother,
'ere's young Smithy wot's back from the war!'&mdash;fancy I don't
'ear 'em, but I do. All the kids stop playin' as I go along; one
says to the other, 'That's the bloke that's bin out to South
Africa a-fightin' the Boers,' an' another says, 'What! 'im? Why,
'e don't look as if 'e could fight cock sparrers!' I tell you,
the kids know a thing or two down our street," added Smithy, with
pride. "My girl was very glad to see me, too. I met 'er up in
'Igh Street; she was lookin' in a shop winder, and I goes up to
'er, gives 'er a dig. 'Ullo, you,' I says. 'Keep your 'ands to
yourself,' she says, not knowin' me. 'Don't you know me?' I says,
just like that; 'don't you know me?' 'Why, it ain't Monty, is
it?' she says, quite put about to see me. 'It is,' I says; 'ain't
you sorry to see me?' 'Not 'arf,? she says. So we went for a
walk."</p>

<p class="cp">AND THOSE LEFT BEHIND</p>

<p>What did Smithy intend doing now? "I am going after a carman's
job next Tuesday," said' he. "You see, it's all very well for old
'K.,' and French, and that lot; they're bein' asked out to
parties, an' quite right too, but drink soon knocks me over, an'
I've got to get work to go to."</p>

<p>"Somehow," added Smithy reflectively, as I rose to go,
"somehow I don't feel as if I ought to go boozing about. I s'pose
I'm gettin' childish, but I can't help thinkin' of the boys who
went out with me and who haven't come back. Don't smile, sir, I'm
genuine. I went to a music hall on Wednesday night, and a fat
girl in tights sang about 'The 'eroes who died for their
country,' or some rot like that, an' I got up an' walked
out&mdash;"</p>

<p>A little boy, shy and grubby of face, sidled into the room, a
rusty crape band on his arm. "What do you want, sonny?" asked
Smithy, kindly. "Mother wants to see you, Uncle Monty," said the
boy.</p>

<p>"All right, tell 'er I'm coming"; then, as the boy left the
room Smithy explained, "You don't remember 'Nobby' Clark, of A
Company, do you, sir? 'E was a Reservist, and lived in this
street. That nipper's 'is son. Poor old 'Nobby.' Let me see, what
fight- was 'e killed in?"</p>

<h2><a id="art60" name="art60">MR CHAMBERLAIN'S VISIT</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), December 31,
1902</h3>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG, October 27, 1902.</p>

<p class="cp">HOW JOHANNESBURG RECEIVES THE NEWS</p>

<p>Last night we had a storm.</p>

<p>Over the city, like a big blue pall, hung the clouds, and
forked lightning flickered along the tops of the buildings, fused
wires, and startled horses. Once or twice Johannesburg was
plunged into darkness. This morning the air is fresh and keen, a
champagne of an air, a very <i>elixir vitae</i>.</p>

<p>The sun shines, the raindrops glisten on the trees, and
Johannesburg goes forth to work in a white waistcoat and summer
suiting. From Parktown, which is aristocratic, from Doornfontein,
which is superior, they come.</p>

<p>Behind smart-stepping cobs, in rubber-tyred victorias, in
whirling, throbbing motor-cars, and skimming along on free-wheel
bicycles. Not the Johannesburg we knew a year ago, nor six months
ago, nor even three months ago; but a wide-awake Johannesburg in
yellow kid gloves, startled perhaps into reminiscences by the
trim London policeman who has taken the place of the
<i>Zarp</i>;* but beyond that forgetful of war, of long treks, of
the clik-clok of the Mausers, of the snappy reply of the Lee-
Enfields, of bully beef, biscuit and untidy weariness.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Zarp</i> (Afrikaans)&mdash;a member of
the <i>Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek Politie</i> (South African
Republic Police). ]</p>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG TO-DAY</p>

<p>This is Johannesburg of to-day. It is not even Johannesburg of
last week, for we change here as a budding flower, every hour and
imperceptibly. I almost forget what a barriered door or a window
covered with galvanised iron looks like. Grass grew in between
chains a little time ago. I know it; but I know it just as I knew
last night that I travelled from Southampton to Madeira in two
hours and took a cab from thence to Cape Town.</p>

<p>War and incidents of war are such dreams. Thus not a shop is
closed in Johannesburg; and if you want to make progress, you
walk in the roadway, and when you go to lunch you take a shilling
motorcab to your palatial residence, and read the second edition
of the evening paper on your way. All of which means that we are
going ahead.</p>

<p>This morning I went through the sunlit space which we
associate with high finance, and there was no grass between the
chains. There were a hundred knots of men talking mines, prices,
and prospects; there were exponents of deep levels, there were
enthusiasts dealing in Coronation Syndicates, there were experts
in real estate, and a crowd of men gathered round notices posted
up by the obliging editor of the Rand <i>Daily
Mail</i>&mdash;which is me&mdash;informing nervous Johannesburg
that Mr Chamberlain was coming out to put to rights their little
grievances, to make smooth the path of progress, and, in fact, to
do all those wonderful things which Cabinet Ministers have the
power to do.</p>

<p class="cp">"A DISTINCT SCORE"</p>

<p>Mr Chamberlain's visit, if one may gauge by the portents of
to-day, will nor only be successful; it will be a distinct score
for the British Government. Nothing could clear the air better
than an announcement of this intention. Our faith in Lord Milner
is in no way abated; our faith in his desire to further the
interests of this country is as strong and firm as ever it was.
To cast reflection on his ability or to question the hold he has
upon the public is to invite immediate unpopularity. But we get
ideas in this country, we people who are not overburdened with
confidence in Downing Street, that Lord Milner's ideas may not be
the ideas of the Home Cabinet, that what as politic in
Johannesburg and the Transvaal for the High Commissioner to
recommend may not be the policy for the Ministers in Downing
Street to accept and act upon.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible, I am convinced, for any man who was in
this country so lately as six months ago to have any conception
as to what are the feelings of the country to-day. If I may be
allowed to intrude my own personal experience, I may say I was
astounded, when I returned after a short absence, to discover
what new conditions prevailed, what new situations had been
created. When I left there had been no hint at a labour trouble,
and no suggestion that there was likely to be any. The political
association had not got beyond its dinner-party stage; the
effects of taxation had already been discounted after the
publication of Sir David Barbour's report; in fact, we did not
trouble to look forward into the future further than to merely
speculate upon the difficulties likely to arise under the
repatriation scheme.</p>

<p class="cp">A ROYAL WELCOME WAITING</p>

<p>I returned to find Boers forgotten and to find political
agitation rampant, to find labour movements in course of
engineering, and to find that over all and through all ran the
fear of excessive taxation, a fear which was momentarily
paralysing industry, and was in every way helping to strengthen
the hands of Lord Milner's would-be advisers.</p>

<p>I say would-be advisers, and by that I mean the gentlemen
whose confidence in Lord Milner was and is so weak that they
consider that their direction or correction is essential to the
well-being and prosperity of this country.</p>

<p>Mr Chamberlain's presence must have one result&mdash;it must
give refutation to the stories, widely spread, that dissension
exists between Lord Milner and the Colonial Secretary; it must
convince the people of the Transvaal of the <i>bona fides</i> of
the British Government to grapple with the situations which
exists there, and that whatever the taxation is and whatever line
Mr Chamberlain pursues with regard to this country, he does with
a clear and sane view from knowledge acquired on the spot as to
our best requirements.</p>

<p>I think I voice the opinion of Johannesburg when I say that no
colony ever started anew life under fairer conditions than will
the Transvaal after Mr Chamberlain's visit. And Johannesburg's
welcome to Mr Chamberlain will be one which is inspired by the
liveliest sense of gratitude, and a gratitude which is not
altogether that sense of favours to come which the enemies of
this country are pretty sure to suggest.</p>

<p>South Africa has a very warm place in its heart for the
Colonial Secretary. To us Joseph Chamberlain is a person who
saved South Africa, a man with the courage of his convictions,
and, what Johannesburg, properly enough respects above all
things, a business man. There is a royal welcome waiting for this
Minister of the King.</p>

<p class="cp">CAROLINA, June 6, 1903</p>

<p>The driver told me laconically enough that this was a good
place to outspan, and so I slipped from the cart in which for two
hours I had been jostled over the ribbon of road that binds
Carolina to civilisation &mdash;represented by the bleakest of
wayside stations on the Delagoa line. It was not an ideal
outspan. The rolling countryside was a black waste from my feet
to a smoky horizon. The farm was three roofless walls and a
chaotic heap of masonry, and what had at one time been a
flourishing fruit garden was now a bedraggled row of quince
trees.</p>

<p>Five women and a litter of children stood stolidly regarding
me as I walked to the farm door. Five women in rusty black of
varying ages. Seventy to fifteen&mdash;and all wives. The Dutch
speak no English hereabouts, unless it be "All right," or "Yes,
yes." They understand the meaning of "coffee," too, and after I
had exchanged a limp handshake with them all&mdash;solemnly and
with no glint of good humor to mar the sacred ceremony, they
motioned me to the armchair in the pokey little room and, sitting
around me on biscuit-boxes and upturned tins, regarded me blankly
and without comment.</p>

<p>There was a curious similiarity in their experiences. They all
regarded the British soldier as a very fine fellow; they had all
been inmates of concentration camps; they had all been treated
remarkably well; but&mdash;and eyes grew bright with
tears&mdash;they had each lost a child. A few hundred paces from
ihe forsaken camps, under the red earth, with only a glass bottle
stuck on a little mound, and inside the name off the child
written in sprawling characters on a half-sheet of common note-
paper, there lay the Boer women's tribute to, the war god. But
they did not hate the British; rather they spoke of us with
kindness. The coffee was excellent, and so was the home-baked
cake, as I politely remarked. The old lady sniffed and grumbled a
little at the compliment. Before the war she could have given me
better; in fact, before the war, when the homestead in which she
had lived for close on forty years was intact, when well-ordered
rows of fruit trees blossomed where now was desolation; when her
herds dappled the green of the rolling hills, she oould
have&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But, and this is the remarkable thing, she spoke no ill word
against the British. Her husband had died in India a few months
ago, her son had been killed, her farm destroyed, her cattle
stolen, her furniture burnt for firewood, and yet there was no
word spoken which might be offensive to me. And yet in that
withered old breast the fires of hate and passion burnt. In the
kindling eye and the trembling hand you could see it. Against
whom, if not against me, who without doubt had wrought the
mischief?...</p>

<p>There was a jabber of voices outside the door&mdash;men's
voices&mdash;and the thud of hoofs. Two impatient horses fretting
under a light rein stampled round and round, their riders talking
the while. The men had returned from visiting a neighboring farm,
and were exchanging excited sentences with the old vrouw.</p>

<p>"Where?" she asked, speaking in Dutch, and shading her eyes
from the white glare of the noonday sun.</p>

<p>One of the men pointed, and I followed the direction of the
man's outstretched finger. A solitary horseman came tripping over
the rise, and, catching sight of the group at the door of the
outhouse, checked his mount to a walk, and came slowly toward us.
The old lady spoke quickly and fiercely to the men about her,
and, clapping spurs to their horses, they galloped toward the
stranger. Curiosity made me follow them. For a time both parties
reined up within twenty yards of each other, and the conversation
was conducted in a series of shouts. Then they drew nearer each
other, and the interview proceeded in more normal tones. "What do
you want?"</p>

<p>The stranger was a fine-built Boer of about fifty. A brown
beard streaked with grey covered his breast, and a big pipe hung
from his lips. Evidently a well-to-do-man, if the gold watch-
guard that hung from pocket to pocket was any indication.</p>

<p>"I have run short of meal," he answered, pleasantly
enough.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to go to Carolina till tomorrow, so I
thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, have you any to spare?" The question was asked
carelessly, but the stranger eyed our man closely, and took a
firmer grip of his <i>sjambok</i>. Our man advanced a little
closer to the new-comer. Dutchmen, as a rule, are phlegmatic, but
our farmer's face was distorted with passion, and as he spoke his
face grew more and more livid.</p>

<p>"Meal for you! <i>Ne, Jan</i>! If you were lying out there on
the veldt dying of starvation I would not give you the smell of a
dishclout. If you were lying out on the veldt and a grass fire
licking round you, and you not able to move, I would die before I
lifted a hand to help you! You dog&mdash;you murderer,
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was half choked with his anger, and the man against whom
the invective was directed sat with bowed head, his pipe in his
hand, and never answered a word. Only when the second man started
with a flow of invective he looked up drearily and put up his
huge hand as though to stem the torrent of abuse.</p>

<p>"Is it to be always like this, and you my own sister's sons?"
he asked, as the second man exhausted himself.</p>

<p>"<i>Ja</i>!" was the quick answer from both men. "Always,
always!"</p>

<p>The stranger slowly turned his horse's head in the direction
from which he had come. I do not think I remember ever having
seen quite so dejected a picture as the man and beast
presented&mdash;he with his shoulders humped and his head bent,
it with its shambling walk and uncouth appearance. I was amazed
at what I had heard, and walked back in silence to the farm
behind the two brothers, for such I judged them to be.. Up till
now they had scarcely noticed me, but the old lady introduced me
to their notice. One of the men nodded his head.</p>

<p>"You are a Britisher?" he said in English. "We fight&mdash;you
fight, two, three years&mdash;finish. You thought you right, we
thought we right; we fight, we beaten&mdash; soh!" And the "soh"
was very expressive. "But," and the speaker shook his fist at the
retreating figure of his uncle, "he's Dutch Boer, who should he
fight?" I ventured to think the gentleman in question would have
been profitably employed in taking pot-shots at the British.
"Soh," said my companion grimly, "but he fight Boers&mdash;curse
him for a Nation'l Scout!"</p>

<h2> <a id="art62">
LORD MILNER&mdash;THE AUTOCRAT OF SOUTH AFRICA</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Southland Times</i> (New Zealand), September 19, 1903 </h3>

<p>In a few weeks Lord Milner starts on his holiday trip to
Europe. The people do not know upon what date, and strangely
enough the people do not seem to care.</p>

<p>Lord Milner's position is one which does not seem to bear
analytical, contemplation. It has become a habit almost of the
loyalist of other days to shrink from any attempt at analysis of
Lord Milner's policy. The men who a few years ago shouted
themselves hoarse in their praises of the great pro-consul: the
men whose support it was that strengthened the High
Commissioner's hand in the troublous times when it needed support
most&mdash;these men, representing the great political and
financial forces of South Africa, show a natural hesitation in
bringing forward either argument or influence against the
retention of his Excellency any longer in the sphere in which he
has worked so much good for the Empire.</p>

<p class="cp">THEN AND NOW</p>

<p>That Lord Milner has accomplished much, that he has shown
himself in the best sense a keen opportunist, that he has
displayed to a remarkable degree the power to assimilate
immediately the conditions which to former Ministers were merely
vague and shadowy, and to grasp at once popular
feeling&mdash;particularly when that feeling was one of
aggression towards an ancient enemy&mdash;there can be no
question. He has shared in his time a popularity which Rhodes at
the height of his fame did not surpass, and has enjoyed an
undivided confidence both with the British and the Colonial
people, which no plenipotentiary, and certainly no Cabinet
Minister has yet evoked. I And now? Now Lord Milner is regarded
by a section of the Colonists&mdash;and a section largely
composed of your Rule-Britannia-Uitlander-Colonists of prewar
days&mdash;in very much the same manner as Mr Chamberlain is
regarded by the ultra-Tory set at St. Stephen's. They were with
him&mdash;up to a certain point. Up to that point their interests
coincided. They had one cause and a common shibboleth&mdash;if
anything they shouted loudest. But that point has been reached
and passed. Lord Milner's gallant company of encouraging
loyalists recovering from their delirium recognised&mdash;as they
might have done before&mdash;that their officers, the men who had
shouted loudest with them, who had led the cheering, and who had
told them through recognised media what they thought and how,
thinking as they did, they should act&mdash;these men were men of
money.</p>

<p class="cp">THE GOVERNOR'S DIFFICULTY</p>

<p>So a large section repudiated their officers and stepped
aside, confident that the Governor would follow suit. Lord Milner
probably finds the same difficulty confronting him as his
supporters of other days find. You cannot repudiate the
capitalists of today who were the reformers of yesterday any more
than you can brand as "autocratic" the qualities you were once
pleased to applaud as "unswerving firmness." The malcontents note
the change of condition and fail to appreciate the absence of
change in men and qualities&mdash;and of their failure is born a
grievance which premises to make Lord Milner a most unpopular
Governor and incidentally a <i>casus belli</i> in the threatened
revolt of the democracy against the power of the omnipotent
capitalist. The fact that a great man's previous good works must
go for nothing; that the wearing labours which rescued South
Africa for the Empire should be lost sight of in a bitter
controversy which has its origin in the question of Asiatic
immigration; that popularity gained by firmness in advocating
"pro" should be extinguished by an equally firm advocacy of
"con," all this is very pitiable&mdash;and very natural. Public
opinion is a "fickle beastie" and such is Lord Milner's position
that I can see no way by which he can regain the confidence of
erstwhile supporters without forfeiting the trust reposed in him
by an influential minority&mdash;and unfortunately in the country
it is the moneyed minority that counts. If in the years to come,
when I am a dithering old man, I am asked by my great-
grandchildren who was the most honourable public man I have ever
met I shall, I am sure, answer without hesitation, "Lord Milner,
some time High Commissioner of South Africa."</p>

<p class="cp">THE STRONG MAN</p>

<p>I do not think I have ever met a man whose absolute integrity,
whose fine logical mind and noble principles have appealed to me
as do Lord Milner's. He is a strong man rather than a safe man,
for in his strength lies the weakness that renders him less safe
than sure. He is an autocrat. His best lovers must allow that. He
is amenable to argument, but not in essentials. He is an
architect of Empire, who will, on advice, alter the front
elevation of his edifice, but whom the very gods would not
persuade to deviate from the ground plan he has decided upon.
Personally a man of charming manners, suggesting the aristocratic
public servant or the dilettante <i>litterateur</i> rather than
the statesman, the High Commissioner, while accessible to anybody
who has reasonable excuse for interviewing him, is at the same
time unapproachable to those with whom his convictions clash. And
now he goes home on his holiday and Johannesburg, unstirred but
respectful, stands hat in hand watching with curious eyes the man
they all but worshipped a few years ago. Do they wish him to
return? I half think not.</p>

<p>There is no open rupture between the Governor and the people;
crowds still cheer him in the street, for I think they love the
man even as they are suspicious of the master. They do not want
to fight him; they would rather fight another man carrying out
his policy.</p>

<p>If he does not return Johannesburg will sigh regretfully but
thankfully, as the man sighs who has seen his loved ones over the
sea before the first shot is fired. If he returns&mdash;but that,
as somebody else would say, is another story.</p>

<h2> <a id="art63">AFRICA TO-DAY&mdash;THE BEATEN BOER</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), October 22, 1903</h3>

<p class="cp">JOHANNESBURG, August 1, 1903</p>

<p>It is considered rather bad form to talk about a war that
raged a few years ago. It used to be THE war&mdash;indeed, it
used to be war, the very embodiment and symbol of abstract
carnage. Sometimes, nowadays, a young&mdash;a refreshingly
young&mdash;ex-Yeoman turns up from England; full of enthusiasm
for the days that were; primed with recollection of pitched
battles, and an uncanny accuracy of detail; a young god of war,
descended from English skies to disturb our calm craft that float
upon the Lethe&mdash;and to remind us of days when shares stood
high on the market. We look at him. curiously, uncomfortably.</p>

<p class="cp">A PAINFUL SUBJECT</p>

<p>We try to change the conversation to weather, or the cost of
living. We grow pallid at his reckless approach of a forbidden
subject, or prickly warm at his unconscious solecisms. We do not
care to dwell upon our mistakes&mdash;as who does? We would
rather not think about our irretrievable blunders, and you have
only to go to Johannesburg to realise how much of a blunder the
people of that town think the war was, and now very glad they
would he if it had never occurred. This is&mdash;as I have
pointed out before&mdash;not so much because the good folks of
the Gold Reef City have become unpatriotic, not because they have
discovered a latent love for Krugerism, previously unsuspected,
but by reason of the fact that the years of famine are succeeding
the years of war, and the good citizens have healthy
appetites.</p>

<p>War is therefore a painful subject; in addition to which it is
a very stale subject; and, worse still, it is to seventy men out
of a hundred the veriest "shop." Long ago the average
Johannesburger discovered that it was impossible to brag about
his connection with the Imperial Light Horse and to tell the
thrilling story of Elandslaagte, without discovering in has
audience an unappreciative section consisting of a squadron
leader, a troop sergeant-major, and a couple of corporals of the
same distinguished regiment, and this, naturally, was to say the
least embarrassing. And so the heroes get weeded out, and the
newcomer wounded in six engagements and recommended for the V.C.
found very soon that he was a very commonplace person indeed. So
the great B**r w*r subject is one which we deal with in mental
asterisks, so to speak, and we are consequently grateful to our
friend the Boer that he is content to respect our reserve and co-
operate with us in this taboo.</p>

<p class="cp">WHY HE SURRENDERED</p>

<p>For the Boers talk less of war to-day than they have ever
talked in the course of their national life. At the time of their
surrender they realised that they were in a bad way. They did
no&pound; think they were badly beaten, and if their attitude
towards us was one of frank surrender, there was, if not
expressed, at least implied, a suggestion of magnanimity toward
an overpowering enemy that they had the power and half the
inclination to further harass. They surrendered because they were
tired of the war&mdash;ninety-nine out of every hundred burghers
would tell you that. It was the spontaneous excuse of the
incoming commandoes&mdash; simply given without qualification and
without amendment. "We are tired of the war&mdash;so we
surrender." It was a reply given in no tone of boastfulness: with
no suggestion of anything but a natural and logical reply to the
question, "Why did you give in?"</p>

<p>It was the hundredth man, the man who spoke good French or
German, and whose first act on arrival at the British camp war to
ask for a bath. He it was who shrugged his shoulders and answered
with a laugh: "Because we were hopelessly beaten!" The terms of
peace were signed, and the Boer was turned loose on the
country&mdash;and he talked. Not loudly or traitorously or
harmfully. He had surrendered, or rather his leaders had for him:
for his part he would just as soon have gone on fighting:
something might have happened. Who knows? A European war in which
Great Britain was embroiled might have been the Boer's
opportunity. He was now a faithful subject of King Edward, and he
would be sorry to see Russia or Germany fighting his own country;
but if he had not surrender&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">HIS FIRST IDEAS OF US</p>

<p>All of which pointed to one fact; and a very interesting fact
it was. The Boer, sharing a characteristic which is beautiful in
the Briton, but is a trifle alarming when in the Boer, did not
know when he was beaten. And the Boer out of the country&mdash;he
of St Helena, of India, of Ceylon&mdash;he came back. He was very
anxious to explain to the Boer in the country exactly how it was
he had been taken prisoner in the early days, and quite willing
to adopt the theory, already sub-consciously propounded, that the
war had ended because the fighting burghers were tired of the
constant trekking and the unsettled life of the commando.</p>

<p>The British were as tired&mdash;everybody knew that. So there
had been a formal surrender of the Boers, a mutual agreement that
hostilities should cease and amicable arrangements whereby the
dignity of neither should suffer. It was quite reasonable, this
view. You remember how we fell over one another in our desire to
weep on the necks of our late foes, how the splendid good-
fellowship of the British was made manifest. Our dearest friend
is not dearer than the foe we have just thrashed. That is a
national trait, but the Boer is no student, no thinker. According
to his lights there could be but one explanation for our
effusiveness. We were glad to get out of the mess at any price,
for, like him, we were tired of war, weary of our constant
reverses and the too frequent humiliations, for which our
periodic victories were a most inadequate compensation. After a
while he began to find things out, did the Boer. Every day that
passed robbed him of his complacency.</p>

<p class="cp">BITTER AWAKENING</p>

<p>The days of war were not very far behind him when he began to
realise a great truth, and it has so sobered him that he does not
seem like the Boer we knew of other days, but rather a civil,
quiet-spoken improvement on the old pattern&mdash;improved out of
recognition. For the truth that has come so slowly is the fact
that he is a badly-beaten man. The men whom he had expected to
meet, the brother, the father, the friend&mdash;what of them? He
had believed that they were with other commandoes, or at the
worst, in the hands of the hospitable British. When war was over,
he waited for them to appear, with all the pleasure of
anticipation. The missing ones came not, but in their place came,
or sent, the folks who had seen them die or had helped to bury
them. This was the first sobering draught that came to the Boer.
The Boer losses were much heavier than he had been led to
believe.</p>

<p>In Great Britain there are, unfortunately, many homes
desolated by war; there are vacancies which even time, that fell
destroyer of ideal who turns the beautiful to commonplace, can
never fill. But think of a nation no single member of which but
has lost a relative.</p>

<p>I think I am right in saving that no one Boer family in South
Africa came unscathed through the war, and not one-third of the
losses were ever realised until the war ended. The little village
cliques were broken and scattered, the little makeshifts for
society were devastated, the dorp oracles whose illogical periods
had filled the sunlit spaces where the drowsy oxen, dozed, whose
rude fingers had spun the wheel war-ward&mdash;what of these?
Dead, or, worse still, traitors. Leaders still remained, but they
were leaders whose life energies had been devoted to promoting
hostility to Britain, and whose faculties other than the
destructive had become atrophied by long disuse. Relationship,
comradeship, society, all had been changed. The national ideals
could no longer exist; they must be reconstructed. The homes they
had lived in, the towns they were born in, wrecked and levelled,
gave them no tangible hold on the past, afforded them no loose
end to which they might splice the new life to the old and
resume. It meant a fresh start all over again; new grooves, new
aspirations. The war had done more than kill, it had made chaos.
They were beaten, hopelessly, irreparably. The Boers realised
this very slowly, for it is not in the nature of things that they
should think quickly, and realising it they have become a
gentler, a better, and a more friendly people.</p>

<h2> <a id="art64">THE SLUMS OF JOHANNESBURG</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Southland Times</i> (New Zealand), November 7, 1903</h3>

<p>Take my arm and come with me. Swiftly through the streets of
Johannesburg, past the shops ablaze with light, past the
loitering crowd that saunters idly, past the thronged theatres
where bursts the melody and spasmodic cadences of applause reach
the ear through opening doors.</p>

<p>Keep out of the light&mdash;the cold, white steadfast lights
that line the mile-long streets; let us creep away, into the
side-ways where are the tumble-down tin shanty of Ramsammy and
the dirt-begrimed windows of Petriwski&mdash;Isaac, the son of
Joseph&mdash;behind which this very man is threading a needle by
the light of a flickering candle. You will see him still at work
when you return, this same Petriwski; well into the night he will
work, plying his needle and dreaming alone of&mdash;who knows
what? Then he will draw a filthy blanket over his greasy form and
sleep till the morning sun awakens him, and then again the needle
and the day-long dream and the candle's successor. But our
business is not with him; only we must pass the road in which he
dwells before we get to the east. He sits in his filth and his
toil, and the memory of Poland is a boundary post between East
and West, between Orient and Occident.</p>

<p class="cp">THE TIN TOWN</p>

<p>Beyond, the houses grow bewilderingly various. Shops,
leisurely started with some dim idea of being beautiful, have
finished by becoming patchily tin. The builder has never
finished. Unsentimental necessity grasped him by the throat,
thrusting him aside to make room for a hundred aliens.</p>

<p>They did not object to unfinished work. The window-sashes were
never painted, and some of the panes were never put in, and to-
day, behind red-painted sashes and glassless windows the
proscribed of Poland live happily enough. We are out of the range
of the white merciless arc light&mdash;that disciple of Truth
that emphasises our wrinkles and traces the patches on our
threadbare coats. Here the light is more mellow, more pleasing.
It is a yellow light and none too bright, and here the houses are
tin. They are bright enough. There is music here. Vice, gilded
thinly, has its votaries, its high priest, and its temples&mdash;
little tin-temples scented with Florida water.</p>

<p>The tin town continues beyond this, but the lower end is
silent. So silent that you might think you had by accident
happened upon a colony living up to the standard set by the moral
Mr Franklin. Early to bed they apparently are. No sound breaks
the silence of the quiet night, no light gleams in any window, no
smoke rises from the crazy courtyards. Early to rise you know
they are, for daybreak sees this little colony alive, with bamboo
rod and laden basket, chattering, running, loading, and trading.
For this is the Chinese quarter.</p>

<p>Knock softly on one of the iron gates. There is no answer.
Here is a door, "The Hoki Laundry." Knock here, and if anybody
comes invent some laundry urgently required by a fictitious
client. But nobody will come.</p>

<p class="cp">CHINATOWN</p>

<p>But I have not brought you here for the pleasure of knocking
at an unresponsive door. I knew all along that it would not be
opened to you. But in a few minutes the gates of Chinatown will
be opened to us, and Chinatown, obsequious and smiling, will
greet us with injured surprise and lamblike innocence. For the
police are very close at hand; all the while we have been walking
this way they have been shadowing us on either hand. You may not
have seen them, but they have been close enough. And now&mdash;
watch. They appear like magic from side-streets and unsuspected
alleys. In ones, in twos, in threes. And they are coming towards
us. Did I tell you we have one of the chiefs of police with
us?</p>

<p>There is no noise, no melodramatic whistle. A whispered word
of command, and two men have scaled the iron gateway and have
dropped into darkness on the other side. A second more, and the
gate grates open on rusty hinges, and we are inside. It is rather
disappointing at first. There is nothing suggestive of the
Flowery Land&mdash;no pagodas or tea- houses or joss-houses, only
three sides of a garbage-strewn square, ranged around which are
the sordid tea-shanties of John. But it strikes you immediately
that nobody is asleep. In fact, everybody is wide awake. A dozen
Chinamen of all sizes and ages are sitting around a red-hot
brazier, on which some mess is stewing, and all the little houses
that have not lights have smouldering wicks&mdash;which is
significant.</p>

<p>Somebody flashes an electric torch over the deserted hovel.
The hastily-extinguished candle still glows, and its smell fills
all space. There is a closed door in one corner of the apartment.
The sergeant puts his shoulder to it, and the sergeant being a
man of many pounds, it gives. There is a passage, and there are
some steps leading downward, and there is another door outlined
in light. This yields to a push.</p>

<p class="cp">THE GAME OF FAN-TAN</p>

<p>We&mdash;that is, you, the police, and I&mdash;do not
apologise, even though we have obviously broken up what promised
to be a successful evening. The curiously-coloured board
supported on a trestle table, and the weird, pawn-like pieces
scattered at our unceremonious intrusion, are implements employed
in the game of fantan. It is an institution that Ho Ki, the Chow,
carries away from his fatherland, it is the outward and visible
demonstration of his patriotism. John Ho Ki, Wun Hi, Ho Ku, and
Chow Ke, in no wise perturbed, sit around the wall of the dug-out
in which this classical game is played. There are four vacant
places at the board, and there is a trap door near the roof to
which a ladder ascends. The banker has departed. Gambling is a
crime, even in Johannesburg, and the players fall in, outside,
from whence they will march to the police-station with great
docility.</p>

<p>There is another door leading from the gambling-den. It is
locked, evidently from the other side, but the sergeant's
shoulder is better than a skeleton key. Crash! The room is bare
except for a frame bed and a table. On this is a candle
spluttering in its socket. On the bed lies a man who does not
move, his eyes are half-closed, his hand grasps a pipe, and the
sickening stench of opium fills the room.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Johnny, where's your pass, eh?"</p>

<p>Leave them to arouse him, and follow the police captain to the
joss-house. The priest opens the door of a tin shanty, in no wise
differing from the dozen about, except that the interior
resembles for all the world a large-sized tea-chest turned inside
out. Here, gold on black, certain moral precepts of Confucius
crawl up the walls like so many auriferous spiders. On the altar
is a small image of a black-bearded god. Before the altar, joss-
sticks, wooden swords, spears, and tinselled baubles. Not so very
inspiring, and certainly nothing to justify the unpleasant scowl
of the priestly custodian.</p>

<p>Now back again to the opium room. There is a group of
policemen round the bed of the dreamer.</p>

<p>"Can't you rouse him?" I asked.</p>

<p>Then I looked and saw how unnecessary was my question. The
Chinese have a pretty little cemetery of their own near
Braamfontein.</p>

<h2><a id="art65">
SOLDIERS OF MERCY
A BATTLEFIELD PEN PICTURE</a></h2>

<h3>Reproduced from <i>The Star</i> (New Zealand), July 25, 1905</h3>

<p>Sometimes elaborate military organisations fail. Army forms
are filled, requisitions prepared, orders signed in accordance
with regulations, but there is a hitch. A thousand miles away the
rope of routine may have jammed between a colonel's officialism
and a subaltern's enthusiasm, and the tug you give at this end
brings no response from the other.</p>

<p>When organisation fails in the Army you depend on the men.</p>

<p>After it is all over you say, "The men were splendid," then go
to work to fashion yet another unbreakable system, which will
cockle up at the critical moment as sure as Eve ate apples.</p>

<p>Because the men were splendid, to-day (May 25) the King is
going to the top of Gun Hill to unveil a grey granite obelisk to
the memory of a few hundred soldiers of the Royal Army Medical
Corps who gave their lives for their country.</p>

<p>I call them the Corps of Unconventional Heroes, because, as
everybody knows who has read his story-book or studied his
Christmas presentation plate, the only way for a soldier to die
in a war is on the field of battle with a rifle in his hand, and
a vision of his mother in the top left-hand corner.</p>

<p>About twenty of the corps died this way&mdash;without the
rifle&mdash;in order that convention should not be hopelessly
outraged, but the remainder died unpleasantly and uncleanly of
diseases contracted while nursing their comrades.</p>

<p class="cp">PROCESSION OF SICKNESS</p>

<p>The Boer war is ancient history. People have gone out of
mourning now, and many have married again. We talk familiarly
enough of the sacred dead; we have reached the point where the
talk of that dreadful war only conjures up a picture of an
increased income tax as its most horrible consequence. Therefore
I do not hope to arouse any enthusiasm for these men&mdash; good
men they were, poor fellows&mdash;who died at their posts, not
with the swiftness of they who...</p>

<p class="verse">
Had their battle cries<br>
To cheer and charm them to their death...</p>

<p>but slowly, painfully, heroically.</p>

<p>From sunrise to sundown they met the constant procession of
sickness and suffering that came to them.</p>

<p>They were the pioneers of mercy, they went to places where the
Sisters could not go; they, set their tents down on furrowed
battlefields and went out with lanterns to glean the harvest of
war.</p>

<p>All night long I have seen them, grim will-o'-the-wisps,
bobbing over the uneven face of the veldt, eclipsed in gullies,
rising faintly by boulder-strewn kopje. They went out
erratically, they came back steadily, painfully, slowly, walking
step by step and keeping time, and that which they swung between
them was a something that in the morning had been a laughing,
lusty man.</p>

<p class="cp">SURGERY BY CANDLELIGHT</p>

<p>They came reeling out of tents in the early hours of the dawn
with blood-caked arms and stiff fingers, with aching eyes.</p>

<p>With only a guttering candle stuck in the lantern to help them
they picked little knives from their velvet-lined cases, as the
surgeons asked for them.</p>

<p>There were fires burning nearer the tents, where a nodding
cook made coffee. The stragglers came up to the fire, smelling of
chloroform, gulped their coffee, and went back to their work.</p>

<p>They have traditions in the corps of officers and men who
dashed into the firing line to bring out the wounded. Traditions
that embrace the work of an officer who held on to the femoral
artery with his finger and thumb throughout one long, long night
and saved his man. But the greatest tradition of all is that the
men of the Royal Army Medical Corps worked patiently,
uncomplaining, in the fever-stricken camp at Bloemfontein,
working a minimum of eighteen and nineteen hours out of every
twenty-four, living with the men they nursed, dying with the men
they nursed, and sleeping the last sleep in the dreary graveyard
that lies outside the town.</p>

<p>Their heroism, their devotion, their divine unselfishness
cannot be exaggerated.</p>

<p>Trite it is to call him blessed who, in the hot passion of
battle or on the impulse occasioned by some sudden danger, lays
down his life for another; but what shall we say of men who saw
the death ahead and did not shirk, who had the danger calculated
with a mathematical nicety and did not fear?</p>

<p>Englishmen, who are proverbially undemonstrative, and who seek
from their vocabulary of sport their superlatives of eulogy, will
say truly and fittingly that they "played the game."</p> <hr>
