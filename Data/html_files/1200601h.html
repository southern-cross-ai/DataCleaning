  <h2>I</h2>

<p class="first">DRENTON DENN lounged into the editorial sanctum
of the <i>New York Post</i>, his hands plunged into the pockets
of a Norfolk jacket. In one corner of his mouth he wore a green
cigar, which he took no trouble to remove. The great man opposite
carried a short pipe between his teeth, also he was minus coat
and vest. All the same, Peregrine Pryde was a great man, and some
day might be president. Meanwhile he preferred to control the
destiny of perhaps the smartest paper on earth.</p>

<p>"Halloa, you turned up again?" he remarked.</p>

<p>"Cuba," Denn said, parenthetically. He slanted a dingy straw
hat over his left eye. "Got at scare article or two for you.
Costly work, though. That last cheque of yours for exes went no
way."</p>

<p>"Hang the money, so long as you get the stuff" said Pryde.
"I'm glad you've come back. all the same. "That your dog?"</p>

<p>Denn nodded and slightly beamed in the direction of a rough
nomadic terrier coiled up near his chair.</p>

<p>"Name's Prince," he explained; "does anything but talk, in
which he has the advantage of you and me. Got a job for me,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Rather. Wants lot of pluck and daring, but danger is one of
your weaknesses. You've heard of the 'Fire Bugs,' of course? No!
Well, at any rate, you are aware that the annual number of fires
in New York are out of all proportion to those in London, for
instance. Rumours have reached me from time to time that there is
an organized gang of ruffians, who make it their business to set
fire to premises in such a way that the brigade are unable to
prevent anything short of total loss. Of course, the game is to
insure a bogus stock, and then bleed the insurance
companies."</p>

<p>"And I'm to find out whether this is true or not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's true enough," Pryde exclaimed. "One of the gang told
me all that in this very office. That little bit of information
cost our old man five hundred dollars, and cheap at the
price."</p>

<p>"Why didn't the chap go to the police?"</p>

<p>"Said the sight of an officer always made him faint," Pryde
said, drily. "Besides, there was money in coming here, and
revenge, too, because Jacob Reski has quarrelled with the gang
and means to expose them&mdash;or, rather, he proposes to leave
the exposure to us. There's all the material for a big thing
here; and I'm putting it in your hands to exploit."</p>

<p>Denn was interested. There was all the material ready for a
pretty adventure, to say nothing of rare journalistic
<i>kudos</i> at the finish. And Denn was always ready to
sacrifice his dinner for an adventure. His sheer love of danger
made him the pearl of correspondents that he was.</p>

<p>When the <i>Post</i> people lent themselves to these classic
exposures money was quite a secondary consideration. With his
straw hat tilted over his eyes, Denn rapidly thought the matter
out.</p>

<p>"I shall have to take the role of a German Jew trader," he
said. "You must set me up in business with a bogus stock and a
big insurance. I shall leave you to make it all square with the
insurance people. All I ask you to do now is to bring Reski and
myself together."</p>

<p>In the course of a day or two the matter was arranged. In the
purlieus of New York Denn discovered a Semitic gentleman anxious
to return to Germany, and who was only too glad to dispose of his
lease and stock for a consideration. The insurance people were
naturally ready to fall in with any scheme calculated to put a
stop to the progress of the "Fire Bugs." Not only did they issue
a heavy policy to Nicholas Mayer&mdash;Denn's <i>nom de
guerre</i>&mdash;but they also considerately dated the policy
three years back, and gave Denn receipts for all premiums.</p>

<p>Denn deemed it prudent to potter about his newly-obtained
premises for a few days before he took any further steps.
Business troubled him not at all, for the simple reason that
there did not seem to be any. And the sixth evening, after dark,
Jacob Reski appeared.</p>

<p>He was a little man with a glittering, evil eye, and the
liquid speech of a born histrion. Within the hour he had imparted
to Denn information that caused the latter to long for immediate
action.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't assist you any further," Reski concluded.
"I'll show you where Moses Part and the rest of the gang make
their head-quarters. You'll easily manage it if you know your way
about."</p>

<p>Denn hastened to assure the speaker that his bump of locality
left nothing to be desired. An hour later, carefully disguised,
he found himself seated alone in one of the most evil and
unsavoury saloons in the Bowery. Some time elapsed before Denn
began to spot his men. They were exceedingly shy and suspicious
to begin with, but Denn was an adept at the game, and ere the
evening had passed he had convinced them that he was as great a
blackguard as anyone there.</p>

<p>It was an evening or two later before Denn dared to come to
the point. Moses Part, a picturesque ruffian with one eye, gave
him the lead. Altogether the "Fire Bugs" were five in number.
Taking them by and large, a more repulsive quintette it would
have been hard to imagine.</p>

<p>Denn listened to their exploits with a smile which concealed a
longing to whip out a revolver and clear the party on sight. If
all they said was true, the insurance companies must have been
robbed of millions of dollars. Many fires resulting in serious
loss of life were openly owned to by the ruffians around
Denn.</p>

<p>"I've half a mind," he said, hesitatingly, "to get you to
grease my little lot."</p>

<p>Moses Part pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>"And what have you got?" he asked, eagerly. "Ach, I knew it
was coming. I guessed what you was after the first night you was
here."</p>

<p>Denn admitted his store in Tiffany Street. There was
practically no stock, though at one time the business had been a
flourishing one, which statement Denn concluded with a cocking of
his little finger.</p>

<p>"Have you a bolicy?" Part asked, nasally.</p>

<p>"For ten thousand dollars," Denn responded. "A policy three
years old and all the premiums paid. You can see it for
yourself."</p>

<p>Part's eye gleamed over this treasure. Everything appeared to
be perfectly in order. And a policy three years old was a gem
rarely handled by the "Fire Bugs."</p>
<br>

<p class="caption">Part's eye gleamed over this treasure.</p>
</div>

<p>"Mine friendt," he said, earnestly, " dose dollars was already
in our bockets. Half for you and the rest between us. Not dat we
trust you altogether, ach no. You assign your stock and bolicy to
a friendt of mine first, and then we get to work. I will come to
your little place to-morrow after dark and plan out the thing
exactly."</p>
<hr>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="first">DRENTON DENN's professional instinct led him on
to a good thing as surely as a steady hound on the trail. And he
was now on one of the biggest "scoops" of his career. How deep
and wide were the ramifications of the "Fire Bugs" the New York
authorities never dreamed. That there was something wrong
somewhere they were vaguely aware, and more than one insurance
corporation writhed uneasy before the spectral dividend. Arson
was steadily gaining in popularity, being at the same time
remunerative and exceedingly hard to prove. That an organized
gang were working the thing scientifically was known only to the
select few.</p>

<p>Nor was Drenton Denn aware what a big thing it was until he
went carefully into figures. Per head of the population, the New
York fires were as four to one compared to London, even with the
latter handicapped by the deadly low flash-point, and the loss of
life owing to the conflagrations was in a still more startling
ratio.</p>

<p>Indeed, the "Fire Bugs" seemed to rather like sacrificing a
life or two. It lent realism to the crime and averted suspicion.
The more Denn dwelt on the matter, the clearer did he see that he
was on the brink of a tragedy calculated to move continents.</p>

<p>With the omnivorous appetite of the Pressman he wanted
everything for himself and his paper. The exposure of the doings
of the "Fire Bugs" and the hunting down of the gang must be all
his own. He knew quite enough now to cause the arrest and
conviction of Moses Part and his merry men, but, as to their
methods, Denn had yet a great deal to learn.</p>

<p>But that was all coming. In the part of Nicholas Mayer, Denn
could see everything when his establishment in Tiffany Street was
primed for the destroyer. The assurance policy had been duly
assigned, and, this being done, Moses Part set to work at once.
Two nights later a cart drove up to 611, Tiffany Street, and
deposited certain innocent-looking packages at Denn's ostensible
business premises. A little later on Part came along, followed by
the rest of the infamous gang. The packages contained a drum or
two of petroleum, some scores of yards of thick hay-bands, a few
shallow wooden tubs, and a basket or two of corks. Evidently the
"Fire Bug" business was an art.</p>

<p>"We'll get to work at once," said Part. "In a couple of hours'
time there won't be much left of this crazy old show."</p>

<p>Denn watched the proceedings with the greatest interest. The
four men worked silently together as if drilled to the part.
There were three floors to the house altogether, and it speedily
became evident to Denn that the idea was to set them aflame
instantaneously.</p>

<p>In the centre of the shop&mdash;or warehouse,
rather&mdash;situated at the back of the premises, Moses Part
placed one of the flat, shallow tubs. Into this one of his
confederates proceeded to pour a quantity of petroleum. On the
top of the blue spirit he sprinkled corks until the surface was
covered. Then the end of the fluffy hay-band was placed in the
tub and dragged across the floor. Into the hay-band naphtha had
been rubbed. Like a scaly snake the hay-band was carried up the
stairs and twisted in and out of the banisters until the next
floor was reached, and here another tub of paraffin, corks and
all, was similarly placed as below. Once more the same programme
was gone through, until the hay-band ended in a tub of petroleum
on the top floor. Around these two latter tanks Part and his men
collected shavings, pieces of paper, cardboard boxes, and the
like.</p>

<p>"All done," Part growled. "There's only one more thing
now."</p>

<p>Dunn looked up at the speaker. His hooked nose was curved over
his thick upper lip in a horrible smile. It seemed to Denn that
his eyes were aflame with anger. Then Part looked down again, and
the evil flame died out like a passing fire.</p>

<p>"What's that?" Denn asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"It's to set fire to the show," Part hastened to respond.
"That's all."</p>
<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="1200601h-images/TheFireBugs3.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">"It's to set fire to the show. That's all."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Denn remarked that he hadn't quite got the hang of it. He was
vaguely conscious that things were not altogether right, but as a
conscientious journalist he could not afford to neglect detail.
The popular voracity for detail he fully understood.</p>

<p>"Come down to the basement, and I'll show you," said Part.
"What we want to get is a fire in three places at once."</p>

<p>"I think I understand," said Denn.</p>

<p>Again that terrible smile came flashing over Part's face.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you will presently," he muttered. "Leading up to
yonder tub is a slow match. This will burn for half an hour
before it reaches the petroleum, and give us all a chance to get
away in safety. Directly the flame gets to the oil those casks
begin to blaze, and the sides of the tub are on fire also. As
they burn down the blazing oil runs all over the floor. Meanwhile
the hay-band carries the flame rapidly upstairs to the next tub,
and so on to the top floor of the house. Within ten minutes there
are three roaring fires going on three floors. You see, my
friendt?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," Denn responded, not without enthusiasm. "A most
ingenious idea! No wonder that your movements are hard to
follow."</p>

<p>"And there is nothing else we can tell you?"</p>

<p>Denn looked up suddenly. There was an ominous change in the
timbre of Part's voice, a ring that clearly spoke of danger. And
it seemed to Denn that the rest of the gang gathered
threateningly around him. As he glanced to the door, Part smiled
grimly.</p>

<p>"There is nothing else," said Denn.</p>

<p>"So; then you are completely satisfied? Now you know
everything of the method of the 'Fire Bugs.' As what you call
merely a guarantee of good faith, and not for publication."</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Ach! What a question to be asked by <i>Mr. Drenton
Denn</i>!"</p>

<p>Every muscle in Denn's body drew taut and trembling. He wasted
no time in words, for he was essentially a man of action. Almost
before Part had ceased to speak, Denn had flown at him like a
cat. A small, compact fist, shod with knuckles like steel, caught
Part fairly on the point of the jaw, and down he went like an
empty sack.</p>

<p>Denn flashed round, and another ruffian dropped sideways
before a tremendous blow behind the ear. Denn slipped for the
door. As he did so a foot shot out and locked his instep, and
Denn staggered and fell. Instantly the other two dropped a-top of
him.</p><br>

<div align="center">
<img src="1200601h-images/TheFireBugs4.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Denn flashed round, and another ruffian dropped sideways.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>It was a hopeless struggle from the first&mdash;a grim
silence, broken only by the heavy breathing of three panting
bodies, and the &middot; whining barking of Denn's dog quivering
in a distant corner. Denn fought with all the tenacious courage
of despair, till a bash, fairly between the eyes. caused the
stars to flash and dazzle, and induced a tendency to
drowsiness.</p>

<p>When Derm came to himself again his hands were securely
fastened by a thong of rawhide, as also were his feet. Part, with
an ugly grin on his face, and a mat of blood in his beard, was
busily engaged in hammering two strong staples into the black,
oaken floor.</p>

<p>"What's your game?" Denn asked, between his teeth.</p>

<p>"You'll find that out presently," Part retorted. "We've known
who you were for a day or two, for all your clever disguise. And
so you thought you were going to fnd out our secrets, and give us
away as you did Dick Daly's boys? Ach, you are a very clever man,
but not clever enough to know we should keep a close watch on
Jacob Reski. And when he went to your office&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough said," Denn interrupted. "What are these staples
for?"</p>

<p>"To fasten you down to the floor. Oh, we are going to give you
every opportunity of seeing how it's done. And we are going to
wind part of that hay-band round your body so that the fire will
pass all round you on its way to the next floor. A bit painful,
perhaps, but it's going to be done, And when the house is burnt
down and you with it, we shall just go and collect your insurance
money, Mr. Denn."</p>

<p>Denn checked a sudden desire to speak. Then he smiled grimly.
If he was to he tortured first and burnt alive afterwards, he
would die with one satisfaction in his heart. The man who called
to collect the insurance money on that assignment would have an
unpleasant surprise.</p>

<p>Bitterly Denn cursed his own imprudences. He might just as
well have had assistance close to hand in case of accident. But
professional pride and jealousy, the desire to do everything off
his own bat, had been his undoing. There was no help for it now.
Of fear, Denn gave no sign whatever. Nor was he afraid. The
dominating emotion was rage and anger at his own folly.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "do your worst. For the present I am
quite helpless. I am not afraid of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're not that," muttered Part. "Seems a pity to waste
so good a man. I only wish I'd got a dozen like you."</p>

<hr>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="first">DENN offered no opposition to the scoundrels.
Such a thing would be futile and childish, and might, moreover,
result in a tap on the head that would render him independent of
this mundane sphere for all time; whereas, whilst there is life
there is hope, and some chain of fate might yet temper the wind.
Denn's nature was, above all things, buoyant.</p>

<p>The loose slack of hay&mdash;band was twisted round and round
him up to the shoulders, so that presently he would be in a zone
of seething flame, and utterly powerless to arrest its progress
on its errand of destruction. He would have to lie there
quivering with the anguish of the diabolical torture until the
collapse of the house would bring merciful oblivion.</p>

<p>At the expiration of five minutes Denn was stretched out on
the floor taut and rigid, his feet and shoulders extended
painfully by the raw-hide straps that were attached to the
staples in the floor. His arms were pinned to his sides. There
was a touch of the tortures of Tantalus in this. The hope that
Denn might get his hands free would only add to his mental agony.
Part regarded his handicraft with grim satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I fancy you'll do now," he said. "If you do manage to escape
you'll have something to write about that will do the <i>Post</i>
good. Quite comfortable? "</p>

<p>Denn's eyes flashed like frosty stars. "I cannot sufficiently
thank you for all this attention," he snapped. "Do you think I am
going to show the white feather, you dog? Go and leave me to die
like a man. Be off with you."</p>

<p>Part backed away, with a mocking bow.</p>

<p>"Good night," he said. "It's a cold evening, and perhaps I
ought to have thrown a rug over you. Now, <i>do</i> you think you
will be warm enough?"</p>

<p>Denn laughed aloud&mdash;he would have been puzzled to say
why. In dire peril as he was, the grim humour of the speech was
not lost upon him. Then he heard footsteps echoing over the bare
floor, and the sullen bang of a door.</p>

<p>A sudden change of mood came over Denn. He tugged at his bands
until a chafed crimson outlined his wrists; then he desisted, and
burst into a fit of tears. Terrible tears they were&mdash;tears
of blood, of anger, and not of fear. Denn wept out of sheer
passionate impotence. Something warm lapped up the brine from his
cheeks. The slobbering, caressing touch soothed Denn strangely,
though he would have found it hard to say why. There was some
comfort in the unexpected presence of his terrier, but under the
circumstances a dog was not altogether an ally in the face of
danger.</p>

<p>"How did you get here, Prince?" Denn asked.</p>

<p>The dog whined and quivered from head to foot. His canine
intelligence told him that his master was in bad case.</p>

<p>"You are a comfort, certainly," Denn Went on, "the same as a
chaplain might be to a convict on the morn of his execution. Your
presence, Prince, may enable me to retain my senses&mdash;always
a valuable possession even to a man in extremes like myself There
is just a chance even for me. You are a clever dog, an
exceedingly clever dog, Prince, but there are limits to your
sagacity. If I could only make you understand the necessity of
gnawing away these thongs of mine, all would be well. As it is,
you can do nothing for me."</p>

<p>Out of the tail of his eye Denn noticed the sullen red spark
of the slow match Creeping on towards the tub of paraffin. In the
intense silence of the place he could hear the splutter of
saltpetre. Surely it must be more than an hour since Part's
departure.</p>

<p>The flame crept along like a snail. Denn watched it in a
dazed, fascinated kind of way. The slow monotony of it was
getting on his nerves. He caught himself almost longing for the
flash and the flare which sooner or later must come from the
tub.</p>

<p>Then another paroxysm of frenzy shook him to the soul. When
the desire to struggle had passed away, Denn was dripping from
head to foot. He smiled in bitter mockery of himself. Never had
his senses been so preternaturally clear as they were at that
present moment.</p>

<p>Taking his master's struggles as part of a game, Prince had
commenced to frisk around, barking loudly. Denn's endeavours had
caused the hay-band to wriggle slightly, and upon this Prince
pounced, shaking it as if it had been a rat. The acrid taste of
the paraffin was not pleasing, but Prince went at it again quite
angrily.</p>

<p>"Good God!" Denn cried. "The one hope lies there!"</p>

<p>There was a fizz and a flash, and immediately the room was
filled with a huge yellow flame. A dense black smoke rose to the
ceiling; fatty, smutty flakes fell like black snow. The first tub
of petroleum was on fire, and broke the silence with a sullen
roar.</p>
<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="1200601h-images/TheFireBugs5.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">There was a fizz and a flash...</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Denn grated his teeth together. He saw the end of the hay-band
slide from the edge of the tub and lie on the floor. There was
just a faint chance that it might not have caught the flame.</p>

<p>But that hope was instantly dissipated. A hissing blue flame
came dancing along in Denn's direction. Just for a moment the
whole universe reeled around him. The reaction threatened to
swamp his senses.</p>

<p>But only for a moment, and then his intense nervous energy
returned to him. A buoyant and virile nature like Denn's is not
easily crushed out. Hope, hope&mdash;there was always hope whilst
life lasted.</p>

<p>That he was about to be burnt, and badly burnt, Denn knew
perfectly well. The shock might kill him. But though this poor
human machinery of ours is easily thrown out of gear, it is
surprising what humanity can endure and still draw the breath of
life.</p>

<p>Denn could not die; he would not faint. The petroleum still
blazed fiercely; the blue popping flame from the corks rose and
fell. The dense cloud of smoke drifted round the room, eventually
finding an outlet by means of a window or skylight rather high up
in one corner. Part and his gang knew their business thoroughly,
and fully appreciated draught as an aid to their endeavours.</p>

<p>As the blazing point of flame struck his leg, Denn shivered.
Near and round him went the blaze, scorching his clothing and
leaving a huge white bladder spirally round his frame.</p>

<p>The agony was intense: so keen, and incisive, that Denn was
dripping from head to foot. Still he retained his senses. As the
zone of fire rose to his waist he controlled himself by an almost
superhuman effort to be still. Then he deliberately held his
hands to the blaze. There was a smell of singed leather, and
immediately the thongs that bound his wrists gave way. Only the
lierce exultation in the knowledge that he had won something kept
Denn going.</p>

<p>When his hands were free Denn threw his arms apart. With his
hands above his head he had no great difficulty in getting his
shoulders free.</p>

<p>Hope spurred him on like generous wine. He had only to rid
himself of the green thongs that confined his ankles to the
staples, and he would be free. Unfortunately, these bonds had not
suffered from the flames. Try as he would, Denn could not rid
himself of these. He had no knife in his pocket, and to try to
loosen the light, damp knots with fingers like white bladders was
impossible.</p>

<p>"Done, after all," Denn groaned. "I'm as fast bound here as a
convict fettered to the floor of his cell."</p>

<p>All this had been, more or less, the work of seconds. He saw
now that the first tub of oil was burning away, and the lighted
fluid was flowing over the hard oak floor. On the other side the
hay-band was carrying a red cone of fire towards the
staircase.</p>

<p>As it progressed, Prince followed, barking furiously. A sudden
idea occurred to Denn : there was just a chance yet.</p>

<p>"Worry, worry," he cried. "Rats, rats; pull him down,
Prince!"</p>

<p>The dog barked more furiously than ever. He grasped the
hay&mdash;band some way beyond the point of flame, and began to
tug vigorously. Prince had evidently made up his mind not to be
defeated. His sharp teeth mumbled and worried at the rope: there
came a sound of something tearing, and then&mdash;the band
parted!</p>

<p>A terrible, hoarse cry came from Denn's throat. Prince set up
and howled. Denn called the dog to him and kissed the shaggy
head.</p>

<p>"My lad," he said, hoarsely, "I guess you've about saved my
life. You shall have a gold collar set in diamonds and jewelled
in sixteen holes. What nonsense I am talking! At any rate, there
will be no fire now, since you have cut off the communication.
Yonder flowing petroleum wont do much harm upon the hard oak
floor. If you could only worry the thongs off my ankles for
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Denn said no more. The floor seemed to rise miles upwards and
then fall again, shooting the hapless man down into bottomless
space. Ten millions of stars danced before his eyes; there was a
roar like the sea in his ears.</p>

<p>The reaction had come, and Denn had fainted. Prince sat there
still and silent, his black nose quivering. The small body of the
terrier absolutely bristled with excitement and expectation.</p>

<p class="first">WHEN Denn came to himself it seemed to him
vaguely as if several years had elapsed since he had slipped from
consciousness. He passed his hand over his chin to feel for his
beard, as Rip Van Winkle might. But no beard was there, and no
flame was in the room either. The "Fire Bugs" had made a
misealculation so far as the ground floor was concerned, for the
paraffin in the tub had burnt away with no greater effect than a
deep excoriation of the stout oaken boards. A smell of burnt wood
came pungently to Denn's nostrils, but the air was clear of smoke
and the danger past.</p>

<p>The pain Denn suffered from his wounds was something dreadful.
But nothing could crush down the fierce exultation at his heart,
the knowledge that by sheer grit and fortunate chance he had
baffled his enemies.</p>

<p>Still, Denn was not out of the wood yet. The thongs about his
ankles still held him prisoner to the staple. Had his hands been
less swollen and blistered he might have freed himself, but with
all his pluck he could grasp nothing whatever, so far as his left
hand was concerned. The right was not so badly scorched.</p>

<p>"It's very disheartening," Denn muttered. "Those fellows are
not far off, and ere long one or more of them are certain to turn
up and investigate into the postponement of the fireworks. Then
where shall I be?"</p>

<p>All the same, Denn did not relax his efforts. An hour passed
with no very definite results, and then a draught of air
proclaimed the fact that the front door had been cautiously
opened.</p>

<p>Prince sat up quivering, his ears a-cock, and his teeth
displayed in a snarl.</p>

<p>Denn cuffed him gently.</p>

<p>"Down," he whispered, "down, sir. Not a sound."</p>

<p>Prince crouched obediently. Denn lay sideways as if dead. A
figure crept in, making no noise, in his india&mdash;rubber
slippers. He approached Denn and stood over him. The latter never
moved.</p>

<p>"He's done for," Part, for he it was, chuckled grimly. "The
charred remains of the unfortunate proprietor were found mit der
ruins! That is what the papers will say. No suspicion after that.
I suppose that hay-band must have parted in some way. A match
will put that all right. Good-bye, Mr. Drenton Denn."</p>

<p>And Part spurned the prostrate figure with his foot. A
fraction of a second later, and a yell of agony rang through the
house. The hidden vein of ferocity lying dormant in every man
rose in Denn at this moment.</p>

<p>There was just one tiny chance of safety, and Denn grasped it.
Like lightning, he grabbed Part by the feet and buried his teeth
like a dog in the ruffian's tendon Achilles.</p>

<p>With his other foot Part lashed out savagely. Denn caught him
by the instep and brought him crashing to the ground. Not for an
instant did the tension of those jaws relax on Part's
heel.</p>

<br>

<p>"Mein Gott, what agony!" Part screamed.</p>

<p>"And it's going to be agony," Denn mumbled, "until you cut the
strip that binds my ankles. I've got you at a disadvantage now,
you hound, and I mean to keep it. Out with your knife and do as I
tell you."</p>

<p>Trembling with anguish in every limb, Part drew a knife from
bispocket. As he was fumbling with the green hide, Denn
dexterouslyi managed to extract Part's revolver from his hip
pocket.</p>

<p>Denn's limbs were free at last. Stiff and sore as he was he
managed to regain his feet, only to see Part rushing upon him
knife in hand. But he was instantly covered with his own
revolver.</p>

<p>"Stand back or I fire," Denn cried. "It's my turn now, my
friend. You have some matches in your pocket, of course. On the
window-ledge you will find some candles. Light one."</p>

<p>Part sullenly obeyed. There was something crisp and metallic
in Denn's voice that precluded any debate upon the point. If Part
had only known how sick, and dazed, and dizzy Denn was feeling,
his discomfiture might have been less. As it was, the ruffian was
completely cowed.</p>

<p>"Now take a scrap of paper and a pencil. There's one on the
table. Of course, the other ruffians are awaiting your return in
the den of the Bowery. Now write what I tell you. Say: 'Something
wrong at Nicholas Mayer's. Come to me all of you as soon as you
get this!' By heavens, if you don't do as you are told I'll let
daylight into you." Part obeyed, sullenly. The letter was folded
and addressed to his second in command. Denn opened a window
looking on a side street, and hailed the first likely-looking
gutter-snipe that passed.</p>

<p>"Do you Want to earn a dollar?" he asked.</p>

<p>The arab raised no particular objection, and was sent on his
errand. He was simply to deliver the note, and nothing more. A
police-oliicer lounging down the street looked at Denn
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You've got it first time," Denn responded. "There's something
so wrong here that all America will be ringing with it in a day
or two. Go on to Patrick Road police-station and send four of
your best men here. And for the love of Heaven, lose no time
about it."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later four stalwart men were gathered round about
Denn and his discomfited companion, listening to the former's
tale.</p>

<p>Denn fainted twice during the recital, but he minded that not
in the least now. All the same, he had been terribly afraid of
this sickness during the time that he had found himself alone
with Part.</p>

<p>Hardly was the recital finished when Part's satellites came
bursting into the house, eager to know what was wrong. Before
they could realize the nature of the cruel trap laid for them the
whole gang were secured. The chief officer would have grasped
Denn eagerly by the hand.</p>

<p>"No, thanks," the latter said, hastily. "I'm not feeling quite
up to social amenities of that kind. You have your men and you
have your evidence, and when you find that insurance policy, your
case will be complete. And you now have the satisfaction of
ridding New York of perhaps the cleverest gang of pestiferous
scoundrels that ever disgraced civilization. God knows how many
innocent lives have been sacrificed to satisfy their greed."</p>

<p>"And meanwhile, Mr. Denn," said the inspector,
"you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will go straight to Barnabas Hospital," Denn said, promptly.
"I want a strong tonic to pull me together, and a smart type-
writer will do the rest. Once the <i>Post</i> is in possession of
all these facts, I shall take a rest. And I want you to know that
I need it."</p>

<p>The <i>Post</i> had it all the next morning, thanks to Denn's
pluck and determination. At what time New York was thrilling over
these revelations, Denn, with head shaven and temperature up to
103, tossed on his hospital bed babbling of strange things. The
"special" was there all the same. And as to the subsequent career
of the "Fire Bugs," are they not written in the annals of the New
York police, so that he who wills may read?</p>
