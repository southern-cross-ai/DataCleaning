his associates in crime. How, for years they defied all the
forces of law and order in the great Commonwealth of Australia,
how they plotted in the obscurity of a lonely bungalow by the sea
and how finally they were run to earth by minds more subtle even
than their own. A tale of thrilling interest, it tells how one
word spoken on a lonely road at night proved the undoing of the
whole band and loosed the avalanche that engulfed them
all.</i></p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; SOWING THE WIND</h2>

<p class="first">ONE beautiful summer's evening a young man was
bicycling slowly along the Military Road that runs between the
great Outer Harbour of South Australia and Glenelg. The road was
one very seldom used and wound a lonely, sinuous way among the
sandhills by the sea.</p>

<p>Dusk had just fallen and the young man was riding slowly and
anxiously along. He was not anxious because the surface of the
road was shockingly uneven and bad, but he was troubled because
he was riding without a light.</p>

<p>He had not expected to be out so late and there was no oil in
his lamp. He had ridden out from Adelaide early that afternoon
fully intending to be back long before night had fallen, but
twice he had had trouble with his tyres, and dusk had now caught
him seven miles at least from the city and on a road that was
quite unknown to him.</p>

<p>Indeed he was a stranger to all these parts. A medical student
from Sydney, two days before he had come alone to Adelaide, on
holiday, and was now amusing himself by touring the district on a
bicycle that he had brought with him to the city.</p>

<p>He pedalled slowly along.</p>

<p>Presently, and just as the road passed deeply in among the
blackness of two high sandhills, he heard low voices away in
front of him, and against the last lights in the sky caught sight
of two figures coming towards him. They were men, he saw at once,
and one, he thought, was wearing a policeman's helmet.</p>

<p>The young man frowned angrily at his bad luck, for he had no
mind for the annoyance of being brought up before the authorities
for riding a bicycle without a light.</p>

<p>Quickly, therefore, and without noise, he alighted from his
machine and then, lifting it carefully from the ground, he
tiptoed off across the road. There was a thick bush close near
upon the sands and, crouching low behind it, in a few seconds he
lay buried in the shadows.</p>

<p>Rather to his astonishment, for he had made quite certain he
had not been seen, the voices had stopped the same instant that
he had dismounted, and he was beginning to believe that both his
eyes and ears must have deceived him when two men, stepping
softly along in the dust that lay thick and deep on the side of
the road, drew level with him where he lay.</p>

<p>He was not five yards from them.</p>

<p>They stopped walking and stood absolutely still. In the dim
light he could just see from their attitudes that they were
listening&mdash;listening and peering hard along the way down
which he had just come.</p>

<p>Presently one of them spoke, very softly but very distinctly.
"You always were an ass, Phil, always on the jumps."</p>

<p>"Ass, yourself. Burke. Everyone's always ass or fool if they
don't think exactly with you. I know I saw someone distinctly,
just in front."</p>

<p>"Well, what if you did? There's nothing in that&mdash;the
road's public to anyone, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, there might be nothing in it if he'd passed us, but
where's he gone?&mdash;that's what I don't like."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you saw anyone. I'd got my eyes skinned same
as you, and I saw no one. It's just one of your damned ideas,
always giving everyone the creeps."</p>

<p>"Look here, Burke, I've had no drinks and I've got no creeps,
but I'll swear I saw someone coming towards us down that rise. I
saw him as plainly as I see you here. He saw us too, I'm sure
now, and that's why he disappeared. It's funny and I don't like
it."</p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't worry me and I'm going in."</p>

<p>"No, nothing worries you, and you've got no eyes. Nothing
worried poor old Rook, and he'd got no eyes. He'd have been here
now if he'd used his eyes. He'd not be doing seven years if he'd
seen the tram conductor follow him. You know that right
enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, chuck it, Phil. Come on now; the Smiter will be in one of
his rages if we're late," and greatly to the young man's
astonishment they turned off exactly at right angles to the road
and proceeded over the sandhills in the direction of the sea.</p>

<p>To the watcher in the bush the whole business seemed very
extraordinary and not without a certain sinister
significance.</p>

<p>That the men were evil-doers he somehow felt quite sure, but
then he fell to wondering what evil they could possibly be doing
in so lonely and so uninhabited a spot.</p>

<p>The young man was not afraid, but he shivered, as brave men
often do when exposed to a sudden and unexpected situation.</p>

<p>A close observer of physiognomy would not indeed have expected
any fear, for it was easy to see the watcher was no coward. His
face was the face of a man not unaccustomed to take risks. His
eyes were grave and deep set, his jaw was square and firm, and
there were lines about his mouth that had been carved there in
Gallipoli and France.</p>

<p>A tense two minutes' waiting, and he followed warily after the
two men. He was curious as to where they were going and his
curiosity was soon satisfied.</p>

<p>To his surprise again, in less almost than two hundred yards,
he came upon a low, flat bungalow built deep in the hollow
between two sandhills. It seemed quite a fair-sized building as
far as he could see in the dark, and a verandah ran all round the
sides.</p>

<p>There were no signs anywhere of the men he was following, but
just as he caught sight of the building he heard the clang of a
shutting door. There were lights in the place.</p>

<p>He turned back the way he had come, and making a wide detour,
in a few minutes approached the bungalow on the side facing the
sea.</p>

<p>Everything was quite still. All the windows were closely
shuttered, but he could see plainly the cracks of light from
within.</p>

<p>Silently he tiptoed up on to the verandah and very cautiously
and without noise placed his ear close to where the light was
coming from.</p>

<p>He could hear the hum of low voices, but to his disappointment
he could pick up no word of what was being said.</p>

<p>Then suddenly&mdash;so suddenly that there was not the
slightest chance of his preventing it&mdash;he received a
stunning blow on the back of the head and was sent sprawling on
his face to the verandah floor. Someone leapt on to his back and
pinioned his arms to the ground. At the same time an exultant
voice cried shrilly, "Come out, you beggars, quick. There's a
blasted spy here and I've downed him. Quick! quick!"</p>

<p>There was a great shuffling of feet and the noise of a chair
being overturned; then a door banged open and three men ran out.
They all fell on him at once, and in two minutes he had been
dragged inside the house, and, with his arms tied painfully and
tightly behind him, had been bundled roughly into a chair.</p>

<p>He found himself in a large room with a good-sized table
running down the centre. At one end of the table there was a heap
of articles that had apparently been hastily covered with a
cloth. His attention was drawn to this by one of his captors
frowningly adjusting the end of the cloth, so as to make sure he
should not possibly perceive what was underneath. The four men
sat down to the table and one of them, producing a revolver, laid
it significantly down just in front of him.</p>

<p>Then they all regarded him intently, without speaking, for
quite a long time.</p>

<p>The young man, in spite of himself, felt uneasy. The man who
had knocked him down was the first to speak, but it was to his
companions that he addressed his remark.</p>

<p>"So, I was an ass, was I?" he sneered exultingly, "and I had
got the jumps, eh? Where the devil would we all have been if I
hadn't stopped outside to make sure? I knew I'd seen someone out
on that road there, and directly he turned back I knew at once he
was a spy. It was you who were the damned fool, Burke, at any
rate this time."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, Phil. Never mind about that now. Who the hell is
this man?&mdash;that's what I want to know. Who are you, now?"
And half rising from his seat the speaker leaned frowningly
across the table to peer closer at the student.</p>

<p>The latter was still dazed and heavy with his fall, but he
answered coherently enough.</p>

<p>"I'm no one in particular," he said. "I'm a medical student
and my name is Page."</p>

<p>"You're in the police!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, I'm not. I'm a medical student I say, and I come from
Sydney."</p>

<p>"You followed us out here&mdash;you were spying."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I wasn't. It was quite an accident."</p>

<p>"Accident, be damned! We saw you in the road."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know that, but I thought you were policemen
yourselves. I am bicycling to Adelaide, and I've got no oil in my
lamp. I saw you coming and thought one of you had got a
policeman's hat. So I hid until you had gone by, that's all."</p>

<p>His interrogator sneered contemptuously.</p>

<p>"And that's why you came sneaking round the verandah; that's
why you went right round the other side of the sandhill, so as to
take us unawares! That's why you stood listening, too, under the
window! You fool! Again I ask you what did you follow us
for?"</p>

<p>The student hesitated a moment and then replied a little
lamely, "I wanted to see if I could borrow some oil."</p>

<p>There was a snarl of dangerous laughter, and then a third man
broke in.</p>

<p>"See what he's got about him, Phil; that'll help us a
bit."</p>

<p>The young man's pockets were quickly emptied of their contents
and his clothes searched generally. The man they called Phil
seemed purposely rough in his handling, but the victim bore
patiently with the roughness, realising perfectly well now that
things were in a dangerous way.</p>

<p>The search yielded nothing of interest. A little money, some
keys, a pocket knife, a few odds and ends, and nothing more. No
papers or letters of any kind. The student had left his
pocket-book and all his valuables locked in the trunk at his
hotel.</p>

<p>The searchers were dissatisfied. The very absence of any
papers seemed to them suspicious, and they glared darkly at the
young man.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the fourth man spoke for the first time, and the
student started as if he had been stung. He had not heard that
voice before and the cruelty in it struck at him like a blow. It
was a voice, cold, suave, and pitiless, without a trace of mercy
in its tone. It was the voice of a man who would hesitate at
nothing if he thought it necessary&mdash;a man with no scruples
whatsoever.</p>

<p>"See if he's got any name," he said quietly, "on the collar of
his shirt or in the pocket of his coat."</p>

<p>The student regarded him intently. He was a rather fat man
with a white flabby face, and neither short nor tall. He had a
square broad forehead, and his mouth was set in a hard straight
line. His eyes were sleepy-looking and appeared to have no
particular expression in them. The man reminded him strangely of
someone in his past life, but he could not remember whom.</p>

<p>They found no name either in his pocket or on his shirt, and
after a short silence the fourth man spoke again.</p>

<p>"Whom do you know in Adelaide?"</p>

<p>The student shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I know no one," he said; "I only arrived the day before
yesterday. I am stopping at the Southern Cross Hotel."</p>

<p>Again a short silence and the interrogation went on.</p>

<p>"You say you're a medical student."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in my third year."</p>

<p>"Tell me the branches of the carotid artery."</p>

<p>For a moment the student was amused&mdash;then he reeled them
off glibly.</p>

<p>"What's your father?"</p>

<p>"A bank manager in Sydney. Manager of the Coulter Street
branch of the Bank of New South Wales."</p>

<p>A significant glance passed between the men, and the student
distinctly saw the eyes of the man they called Phil turn quickly
to the covered-up end of the table.</p>

<p>The fourth man spoke again, coldly and deliberately as
before.</p>

<p>"I believe you're a liar."</p>

<p>For the first time the student was angry.</p>

<p>"What if I am? I've done you no harm. But I'm not. Everything
I've told you is true, except that I kept back that I was curious
to know what your two friends were about."</p>

<p>"What made you curious?"</p>

<p>"What I heard them say."</p>

<p>"Exactly, you're a spy."</p>

<p>The student bit his lip in vexation. He knew that like a fool
he had given himself away. He ought never to have let them know
that he had heard anything at all. Now, if they had got anything
to hide, they knew that they had aroused his suspicions and it
might be dangerous for them to let him go.</p>

<p>He looked at them from one to another, but three of them now
averted their eyes. Only the fourth man was looking at him
still.</p>

<p>There was a long, dreadful silence and the young man shivered.
He realised that he was in the presence of death.</p>

<p>Once before he remembered such a scene as this, in a little
village in the far-off days in France. He had been on orderly
duty, and they were examining a spy. The examination had been
concluded and there had been a moment's silence before the
officer had told the spy he was about to die. He sensed that
silence now.</p>

<p>The fourth man made a peculiar sign to the one they called
Phil.</p>

<p>"Take this young gentleman outside," he said suavely, "while
we think over what we must do. Don't unloose his arms. No," he
continued, turning back to the young man, "you'd better go
quietly. We're not going to hurt you, but we have valuable
properties here and we should like to be quite certain you didn't
come after them. We shall inquire into your story and see if it's
all true. The Southern Cross Hotel, I think you said. Well, we'll
phone up. We shan't keep you long."</p>

<p>The student got up stiffly. He knew quite well that the man
was lying, and that they were going to do something dreadful to
him, but he made a pretence of being relieved and smiled
confidently.</p>

<p>Still pinioned and with an escort on either side, he was
piloted through the house and across a small yard to a
substantial-looking motor shed on the far side. The moon had just
risen and he could plainly see the padlock on the door.</p>

<p>The man they had called Burke produced a key and, opening the
door only just wide enough to admit of his entering,
unceremoniously pushed the prisoner in and clanged and padlocked
the door again behind him.</p>

<p>It was almost dark inside and the vicious push he had received
caused the student instantly to overbalance. He fell painfully
upon a big heap of wood and for quite a minute lay dazed and
stunned exactly where he fell.</p>

<p>Then he rolled over in a feeble attempt to sit up, and the
first thing his hands touched was the cold, smooth blade of an
axe.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought nothing of it, and then it suddenly
flashed through him that if the blade were only moderately sharp
he could very quickly cut through the cord that held his wrists
so painfully together. At once he began rubbing the cord and
blade together.</p>

<p>The axe proved sharper even than he had dared to hope and
almost immediately he was free of his bonds and was breathlessly
chafing the blood back into his cold, numbed hands.</p>

<p>All the while he was looking intently about him. The moonlight
came in faintly between the chinks of the door and, more
accustomed now to the darkness, he could take in all his
surroundings without difficulty.</p>

<p>There was no car in the garage and it was apparently being
used as a wood shed only.</p>

<p>His thoughts succeeded one another quickly. He was sure he was
in great and deadly peril, for if ever he had seen murder in
anyone's eyes he had seen it in those of the white, flabby-faced
man who had questioned him last.</p>

<p>What their business was he could not imagine, but he believed
he had stumbled inadvertently upon some sinister secret, and that
it would not be safe therefore for them now to let him go.</p>

<p>He shuddered to think what they might be intending to do to
him, but if his four years in the war had given him courage, they
had also given him quickness and resource. Action followed almost
immediately upon thought.</p>

<p>Directly sensation had come back fully into his hands, he
stood back a few feet, well away from the wall, and swinging the
long axe over his head brought it down fiercely upon the
door.</p>

<p>Once, twice, three times he swung it and then, crash, the door
burst open and he sprang exulting into the moonlight.</p>

<p>There was no hesitation then about his actions. With a loud
cry of defiance, for he knew it would be quite hopeless to
imagine the breaking down of the door had not been heard, he
hurled his axe contemptuously upon the roof of the bungalow, and
raced like a greyhound for the sea.</p>

<p>He knew his only chance lay in flight, and he judged rightly
he could run best over the broad level sand at the margin of the
waves.</p>

<p>He reckoned that if he could get only a hundred yards from the
house he would be safe, for it would be quite improbable that
they would have a loaded rifle ready.</p>

<p>Racing over the yard and down towards the low fence that
bounded the long stretch of grass in the front of the house, he
heard voices shouting to him to stop and then three times in
quick succession someone from behind fired with a revolver. The
hiss of the bullets sounded unpleasantly close, but he was quite
unharmed.</p>

<p>He had reached the fence and was adjusting his stride to leap
over it when for the fourth time the revolver spoke. The bullet
missed him as before, but the report made him miscalculate his
jump. He sprang short and hitting the top rail fell with a heavy
crash back on to the ground. His forehead struck a jagged paling
and in an instant he was blinded with blood.</p>

<p>He felt terribly sick and made no attempt to rise. Two of his
late captors ran up.</p>

<p>"My God," cried one of them. "Smiter's hit him in the head.
He's killed him. Fetch the others quick."</p>

<p>But there was no need, for the other two came running down as
he spoke. There was a low and hurried consultation and then the
Smiter issued his orders like a man who was accustomed to be
obeyed.</p>

<p>"Put him in the sea," he said sharply; "with this tide running
he'll be out of the gulf by morning. Quick now; the shots may
have been heard. Lift him, don't drag him down. You needn't go in
deep. The tide'll be dead off shore."</p>

<p>With no further discussion the limp body of the student was
bundled up and hurried to the sea.</p>

<p>He was quite conscious and had missed no word of what had been
said, but he felt too sick to worry about anything. It crossed
into his mind that he was prepared to die.</p>

<p>A few stumbling yards and they were over the sands and by the
sea.</p>

<p>"Now swing him; one, two, three. .. .. ."</p>

<p>Instinctively he knew what was coming, and he took in a deep
breath.</p>

<p>Splash&mdash;he was free of them at last.</p>

<p>The sweet warm water of the sea closed over him, but instantly
as he sank his brain was cleared of its oppression, and the magic
love of life came back.</p>

<p>He felt revived at once.</p>

<p>Why should he die in any case? He had so much to live for,
and, after all, he could not be very much hurt.</p>

<p>With the sea warm as it can be on an Australian summer night,
he knew he could remain in it for hours without being chilled,
and he had only to drift gently with the tide speedily to draw
clear from the murderers.</p>

<p>He chuckled to himself at the simple way in which they had let
him go.</p>

<p>Very gently he allowed himself to rise to the surface, until
his face was just clear, and then he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>The moon was disappearing behind a cloud, and in a few seconds
it was almost pitch dark.</p>

<p>He was about twenty yards from the shore and dimly he could
see the figures of the two men who had thrown him in.</p>

<p>They were watching to see what had become of him.</p>

<p>He drifted very slowly away.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; A YEAR LATER</h2>

<p class="first">IT was the Christmas Cup Saturday at
Morphettville Racecourse, Adelaide, and old Andy McIver had got
his betting boots on and was doing well. A rich man and in no
need of money, he was, of course, winning all along the line.
After three races in succession he had gone up to draw money from
the paying-out windows of the totalisator.</p>

<p>He had had twenty-five pounds on Bottle King in the Hurdles
and it had returned him a dividend of over eight to one.</p>

<p>Then he had had fifty pounds on his own animal, Lightning, in
the Welter and, although it only came in second, his money was
returned to him exactly doubled.</p>

<p>He had next plunged heavily on Clara in the youngsters' race
and the beautiful little filly, coming like a whirlwind at the
finish, had pipped the favourite easily by a length. Nearly six
hundred pounds had then been added to the already thick wad of
notes in his breast pocket.</p>

<p>He was very pleased with himself, nor did he mind who knew
it.</p>

<p>"Splendidly, my boy," he called out loudly in answer to the
inquiry of a friend two rows in front of him on the grand stand,
"I'm picking them all out. It's as easy as shelling peas."</p>

<p>He walked out, and down to where the band was playing,
wondering what he should back for the Cup.</p>

<p>Suddenly, when turning round to admire two pretty girls who
were passing, he banged into a big stout man, almost knocking the
race glasses the latter was carrying out of his hand.</p>

<p>"Curse you, Andy," expostulated the corpulent individual
sharply. "What are you swerving all over the course for? Leave
the girls alone, can't you? I should have thought you were too
old for that sort of thing now&mdash;you wicked old gambler."</p>

<p>"Hullo, Charlie&mdash;beg pardon, old man, but weren't they
peaches? Pretty as two-year-olds and just about as skittish, too.
The little dark one smiled at me; I'll swear she did."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder either. Your old red face would make
anybody smile. I could grin myself any day when I see you; but
how are you doing to-day?"</p>

<p>The old man beamed with happiness like a boy. "Dinkum, dinkum,
Charlie, I'm drawing money every time. Now, bless me if I don't
back your animal in the Cup. I wanted a good outsider, but I
never thought of Boxer till I saw you. Any chance, do you
think?"</p>

<p>The owner of Boxer frowned.</p>

<p>"It'd win if they'd let it," he growled, "but, damn them, it
never gets a chance. You know the grudge they've all got against
me."</p>

<p>Old Andy knew it well enough. Boxer was a good stout horse and
beautifully bred, but for over a year now he had been under a
cloud. Back in his two-year old days he had been a hot favourite
once, in a classic race at Victoria Park. He had finished very
badly, however, and the irate owner, whom report said had backed
him heavily both off and on the course, had sworn that the horse
had been deliberately pulled and thereby prevented from
winning.</p>

<p>In a great rage, he had had the jockey up before the
Stipendiary Stewards, but the latter, upon deliberation, had
found no proof of pulling, and the rider had got off
unscathed.</p>

<p>A great to-do had been made about the matter at the time and
it was rumoured generally that all the jockeys had sworn among
themselves that Boxer should never win on an Adelaide racecourse
again.</p>

<p>It might, of course, have been only a rumour, but strangely
enough. Boxer never had won since.</p>

<p>A splendid galloper at exercise and on the track, and always
most highly spoken of by all the touts and sporting
correspondents who had watched him, he had, however, never been
able in many subsequent attempts to catch the judge's eye.</p>

<p>Something always seemed to happen to him when he came on to
the racecourse. Either he got off badly, or something bumped into
him at the start, or some other horse compelled him to run wide
at the turn, or he got boxed in at the finish and could not get
an opening to run through.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, intentional or not, he never seemed to get a
fair chance and was certainly the most unlucky horse in
training.</p>

<p>"He's been doing well on the track, hasn't he?" asked Andy. "I
saw Rapier wrote the other day that he'd never been going
better."</p>

<p>"He's fit to beat anything in the Cup," replied the other,
gloomily; "he's only got eight stone and the distance just suits
him. But there you are&mdash;some damned bad luck will come to
him as sure as we're talking here. I tell you, Andy, they won't
let him win."</p>

<p>"You've got young Lane riding him to-day? I read it
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm alright there. Lane's one of the most promising
riders in the West. It's quite by chance I got him, too. I heard
he was here on holiday with his father, and I asked the old man
if he'd let the boy ride. I know he's only an apprentice, but
he's a fine judge of pace and a clean, jolly little fellow
altogether."</p>

<p>"Well, let's have a word with him, Charlie. I'm going to back
your horse and chance it, anyhow."</p>

<p>They went round by the weighing-room and found the boy. He was
talking to his father. He certainly did look a nice little chap.
Old Andy was introduced.</p>

<p>"Mr. Andrew McIver?" queried the elder Lane. "I know you very
well by reputation, sir, for my brother worked on your station at
Woolaroo for many years, and a very good master he said you were.
He was never tired of telling us of your kindness and the way you
always treated all your men."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," replied old Andy with his red face redder now than
ever. "I remember Bob Lane well and a better man I'll never meet.
I could trust him anywhere; but look here now, we've come to you
about this race. Mr. Horrocks here is my great friend, and I'm
most anxious to see Boxer win. I'm backing him heavily myself,
too."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, my lad'll do his best. You can depend on Ted."</p>

<p>"I know that, but I expect you've heard by now that people say
Boxer's never going to be allowed to win. You've heard that,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>The jockey's father looked rather uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I've heard something," he replied, and then he
added proudly, "but my boy's no fool, although he looks a kid.
He'll see that no tricks are played. Won't you, Ted?"</p>

<p>The boy grinned.</p>

<p>"Got my riding orders, sir," he said. "Win almost from start
to finish if I can. I've had a spin on him and I don't want
anything better."</p>

<p>"Good boy, sonny," broke in old Andy admiringly. "I'll have a
packet on your mount and if you win there'll be a hundred of the
best to go into your money box, see?"</p>

<p>The boy grinned impishly this time.</p>

<p>"Well, don't give it to dad, sir. I'll come for it myself,
sure I will."</p>

<p>In high good humour Andy patted him on the back.</p>

<p>"By Jove, you'll do, I can see. I'll have to have an extra
fiver on the tote to pay for your present. I really do believe,
Horrocks, that we're going to win."</p>

<p>The bell rang and the little jockey ran off. It wanted twenty
minutes yet to the starting time, but business was already brisk
at the totalisator and the figures under the various horses'
names were changing and mounting almost with every second.</p>

<p>Already nearly &pound;3,000 had been invested and he would have been
a smart man who could have determined from the figures exactly
which horse was going to end up favourite.</p>

<p>There were sixteen runners, but four horses alone were being
heavily backed, and of these Rose Darling held just a slight
predominance over the others. Over &pound;500 had been posted to her
credit.</p>

<p>Andy McIver smiled knowingly when he saw the figures. "Boxer
at any rate has got a poor following," he said to that horse's
owner who was standing beside him. "Only &pound;52 so far. Why man,
it'll pay forty if it's no better backed than it is now."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to have fifty on," growled Horrocks; "that'll
make 'em think a bit."</p>

<p>"Don't have it on yet, Charlie; I'm going to have fifty on,
too, and perhaps a hundred. Wait till towards the end. Wait till
everybody's put down their money and then we'll go in together
for a good slapping win. Damn those jockeys, I say; it'll be the
sell of their lives if Boxer wins and I do believe he's going
to&mdash;something tells me he is."</p>

<p>"You're a real baby, Andy. I've had that feeling hundreds of
times in my life&mdash;and a nice penny it's cost me. But we'll
wait until the last three minutes and then we'll go on to the
rise and see our money lost."</p>

<p>Two minutes before the race was due to start Andy and his
friend hopefully advanced to the &5 window and a big jump of &pound;150
was immediately recorded to the investments on Boxer.</p>

<p>Confidence in Boxer even then looked rather small, less then
&pound;260 in a total of over &pound;6,000 being all that was under his
name.</p>

<p>The start took place just opposite the stands, and the sixteen
horses were getting ready to line up.</p>

<p>Boxer was drawn number eleven, and the two friends soon saw
that the youthful jockey had all his wits about him.</p>

<p>Pinkeye, drawn number ten, started kicking and plunging and
little Lane expostulated shrilly.</p>

<p>"Now then, keep your old bus away, will you? Have you drawn my
number as well as yours? Keep away now."</p>

<p>The other jockeys laughed good naturedly.</p>

<p>"Alright, baby," said one, "you shall have the whole course to
yourself in a minute when we've started&mdash;so don't worry
now."</p>

<p>"You want some of the lads from Perth here," went on the
little chap. "They'd teach you to line up properly anyhow."</p>

<p>The crowd round the rails were much amused.</p>

<p>"That's Boxer he's riding," said a tall thin woman who
appeared to know everything and everybody on the course.</p>

<p>"Yes, and Boxer'll get boxed in," replied her friend, equally
knowing; "he always does, you see. I wouldn't back him to-day at
a hundred to one."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nonsense. He'll win some day."</p>

<p>"Not till they let him," her friend replied meaningly, and she
lowered her voice. "Do you know, they say that whenever Boxer
runs there are two jockeys always told off specially to prevent
him winning."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've heard that, of course, but whether it's true or not
goodness only knows."</p>

<p>"Well, you see if I'm not right. He'll never get a look
in."</p>

<p>The start was delayed quite a long while. Several of the
horses seemed fractious and to be almost purposely refusing to
come into line. The newspapers said next day that Boxer was
certainly the worst offender, and perhaps they weren't far wrong.
Certainly young Lane appeared to be having a lot of trouble with
his mount, and time after time it was Boxer alone who prevented
the field being sent off.</p>

<p>The starter was most patient&mdash;perhaps partly because the
rider was a stranger to South Australia, and partly also because
he could not have been unaware of the cloud the horse was
under.</p>

<p>The boy did not seem a bit flurried, however, and took
everything most deliberately. He said afterwards that the jockeys
on either side squeezed in directly he came near&mdash;so he just
invariably made Boxer back out, and tried again.</p>

<p>Andy McIver was watching everything most intently. He smiled
gleefully at Horrocks.</p>

<p>"The little devil," he chuckled, "he's doing it on purpose.
With any luck he'll poach a flying start."</p>

<p>And a flying start he did poach. When for about the tenth time
Lane tried to take his allotted position without being squeezed,
and for the tenth time it seemed that purposely both his
neighbours closed in, the starter called out sharply to them to
keep their mounts straight, and then instantly after let the
tapes go up. Lane had been hustling the gelding forward quickly
to take the clear opening that had been made for him, and the
start caught him on the move.</p>

<p>He got off a clear length in front of everything else.</p>

<p>"Good boy," roared old Andy, "he's smart as paint. A fiver to
nothing now, he rides a good race."</p>

<p>The boy on Boxer was quite aware that so far the luck had been
all his way, and crouching low in his saddle he thankfully
regarded the clear open course before him. He was sure they had
been trying to beat him at the start.</p>

<p>The race was a mile and a half, and Horrocks's trainer had
given him implicit directions as to how to ride his mount.</p>

<p>"Keep well up, lad," he had said, "for the first half of the
journey; then ease him a bit and make your run two furlongs from
home. Boxer can sprint as well as stay. Don't be afraid if you're
laying back a bit just as you come round the bend, but if you've
escaped so far look out for trouble there. They'll try to run you
wide at the turn. Don't use your whip too much."</p>

<p>The boy was sensible enough to follow instructions, and
instantly he was clear began to make the most of his mount.</p>

<p>He urged Boxer along at good rattling pace, and it thrilled
every nerve of his wiry little body to feel the way the good
animal responded to his call. Boxer was only a four-year-old and
had not been over-raced. He had a beautiful even motion and
covered the ground in a fine devouring stride.</p>

<p>Half a mile from the start he was going like the wind, and
still in front. Out of the tail of his eye, however, Lane could
just see the fine black head of Beetle Boy looming on his flanks.
In the middle distance Boxer was still first, but Beetle Boy was
now level with his girths, with Rose Darling just about a head
farther behind.</p>

<p>"Has he shot his bolt, Charlie?" anxiously asked old Andy on
the stand.</p>

<p>"No, no," testily replied Horrocks, without taking the glasses
from his eyes. "Good boy, riding to orders, that's all."</p>

<p>Half a mile from home Boxer had dropped back to fourth on the
outside, but his jockey could feel him full of running, and had
eased him only because of the definite instructions he had
received.</p>

<p>He was running dead level with Repeater, alongside him, but
the latter was all out and Lane could see he was tiring and was
obviously a beaten horse.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a good fifty yards before the turn for home,
Repeater began to swerve badly, threatening to carry Boxer out
wide with him. His jockey appeared to have lost control.</p>

<p>In an instant Lane had seen his danger and throwing his
instructions to the wind, he suddenly urged on Boxer to topmost
speed. He struck him sharply with the whip and Boxer leapt
forward like an arrow from a bow.</p>

<p>He escaped interference by a hair's breadth and ruthlessly
cutting down his other opponents entered the straight for home a
good length ahead.</p>

<p>The boy felt rather frightened then at what he had done. He
knew he had commenced his final run quite two hundred yards
earlier than he had been told to, but he consoled himself with
the belief that he had done quite rightly. If he had not speeded
Boxer up he would inevitably have been driven out wide by the
fast-tiring Repeater, and would have then entered the straight in
an entirely hopeless position.</p>

<p>Now, at any rate, everything was clear and if Boxer were only
good enough, he should win.</p>

<p>He knew he could not ease his mount, even ever so little
again. He had started Boxer on his final run, and he judged it
best to keep what advantage he had gained by his sudden and
premature speeding-up.</p>

<p>All at once his anxiety left him. A born judge of a
thorough-bred, the glorious and perfect action of his mount
enthralled him. Boxer was putting in a tremendous pace, but he
was still running with a beautiful easy motion, and there was
no sign whatever of any tiring or distress.</p>

<p>A fierce excitement thrilled through the boy. Again, as when
they had first started, he was leading in front of them all and
again he had the great wide staring course open and free before
him. On, on the whole field thundered.</p>

<p>Crouching low against the tremendous rush of wind he rode the
gelding only with his hands.</p>

<p>The shouting from the stands came up to him like the roar of
some mighty hurricane, and then slowly and stealthily so it
seemed, the form of another horse loomed up close alongside of
him, on the rails.</p>

<p>He did not, however, turn his head. He just stared hard and
patiently at the black spot in the distance that he knew was the
judge's box. Every second it was getting bigger and bigger.</p>

<p>The horse near to him came farther into view. Its head reached
level with Boxer's girths, it came nearer and nearer still and
then it stopped.</p>

<p>Without turning he knew it was Rose Darling. Her jockey was
flogging her savagely with his whip. The judge's box was very
near now.</p>

<p>The boy was sorely tempted to strike Boxer, too, but instinct
told him the gelding was all out and a cut now might make him
swerve and lose the race. So he just held patiently on in a grim
agony of suspense.</p>

<p>Only about five yards farther to go now and still Rose Darling
was just by Boxer's neck. A mist came over the boy's eyes, and
for a moment his heart stood still.</p>

<p>A mighty roar of sound and it was over. Boxer had won by a
head.</p>

<p>Old Andy wiped the perspiration from his forehead and then
solemnly shook Boxer's owner by the hand.</p>

<p>"By gad," he almost whispered, "but what a race and what a
little artist the chap is! If he'd lifted his whip once, ever so
little, he'd have lost us the race."</p>

<p>The apprentice jockey received a tremendous ovation from the
crowd. Nearly all of them had lost their money over the race, but
the masterly way in which the little fellow had matched himself
against the jockey of Rose Darling, one of the finest riders in
the State, appealed vividly to their imaginations and they
cheered heartily when he came in.</p>

<p>The boy at first tried hard to appear bored, as he had seen
the crack jockeys always did, but his youth was not proof for
long against the cheering he received and he soon showed his
delight in a broad and impish grin.</p>

<p>Over &pound;7,000 had been invested in the totalisator, and Boxer
returned the handsome dividend of &pound;18 15s. 0d. for every pound
that had been invested on his chance.</p>

<p>Old Andy asked for his dividend in the largest notes
available, but even then he found his breast pocket
inconveniently small for all the money he had received.</p>

<p>Some of his friends remonstrated with him for drawing so large
a sum of money on the course.</p>

<p>"Why man," urged one of them reprovingly, "it's tempting
Providence to walk about with so much money here. Why on earth
didn't you leave it until next week and draw it at the offices in
the city? You're always pointed out as a dreadful gambler and
lots of people know by now that you've had two good wins."</p>

<p>Andy laughed happily.</p>

<p>"Let 'em all know it&mdash;I don't care. I want to handle the
money in good plain notes to see what I've won. None of your
uninteresting cheques for me. I get plenty of them every
day."</p>

<p>"But surely you're not going home alone."</p>

<p>"Certainly I am, and in my own good car. I'm driving myself
too. I've been here all this afternoon quite alone."</p>

<p><br>
But Andy McIver was mistaken here. He had never been quite
alone. The whole time long, Death in a dreadful form had been
hovering near him. Death at the hands of a pale-faced and
insignificant-looking man. He was disguised, this man, and he
wore a false beard. Never once had his eyes left Andy since he
had arrived on the course. He had followed him every minute of
the time. He had watched him laugh and talk and seen him gather
in his winnings with a dreadful smile. He knew all about Andy,
and he had marked him down.</p>

<p>Andy McIver was looking his last upon this gay scene, and it
was well he could take in the beauty and the happiness of it all,
for it was his last day on earth.</p>

<p>Never again would he come here in joyful health and strength,
never again would he blithely smile and greet his friends, never
again would he see the glory of those long low hills.</p>

<p>He had had a long life had Andy, but the sands were running
low now and Fate was calling him for his last race. His colours
were 'all black' and it was Death who rang the saddling bell.</p>

<p><br>
The racing was all over a few minutes after five, but it was
quite half an hour later before old Andy left the course. He had
found so many friends to chat with, that time had passed much
more quickly than he thought.</p>

<p>"By Jove," he exclaimed presently, looking suddenly at his
watch, "I shall catch it. We dine at six and there'll be the very
devil to pay if I am late," and with a final nod and wave of his
hand he bustled to his car.</p>

<p>A police inspector came by just as he was getting in.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Inspector," Andy called out genially; "how are you
to-day? Still the best-looking in the force, I see. My word, but
you've been quite a picture to-day."</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly turned sharply to see who was addressing him
so familiarly and then, recognising McIver, allowed his face to
break into a pleased and pleasant smile.</p>

<p>He certainly was a good-looking man, this Inspector of the
Adelaide police. He had a fine strong face with good clear-cut
features and a pair of very thoughtful grey eyes. He wore a
military moustache, with the ends slightly waxed, and carried
himself proudly as becomes a man who had fought with distinction
in the great war. He was about thirty-five years of age.</p>

<p>"Good evening to you, sir," he replied with his eyes
twinkling. "Yes, I'm still in the Beauty Competition, but I don't
seem to come in for any prizes somehow. Beauty unfortunately
doesn't count yet for promotion in the Force."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Inspector, it'll come soon. They can't pass over
a face like yours for ever. But, tell me, have you backed any
winners this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"No, I've had no luck, but I only had one bet. I backed Rose
Darling."</p>

<p>"Poor chap&mdash;and I backed Boxer."</p>

<p>"A very fine race, Mr. McIver. The little chap quite deserved
his win."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it was lucky for us he was riding. Do you know,
Inspector, I've won over &pound;2,000 here to-day and drawn it all in
cash. I've got my pocket absolutely full of notes."</p>

<p>The inspector frowned.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say, sir, that you've got over &pound;2,000 on you,
now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and it bulges me out quite uncomfortably too."</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"It's not wise, Mr. McIver; it's very foolish. Lots of people
must have heard you have won."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, they were looking out for it. I got an unexpected
cheque for &pound;300 yesterday and told several friends I was coming
here to-day to give it a run. I showed a lot of people my
tickets, too, before I cashed them; but bless your heart, I'm not
afraid. I've got a good automatic at home, and a big dog that
would account for anybody who dared to come prowling round. But
good night, Inspector, I must be going. My niece will raise the
roof off, if I'm late."</p>

<p>The inspector watched him thoughtfully as he drove away.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," he muttered, "that I oughtn't to give the
station at Glenelg a call to look after his house to-night. He's
a jovial old soul, but indiscreet&mdash;very."</p>

<p>Andy McIver's car was a speedy one, and in less than a quarter
of an hour the old man was at home and getting ready for
dinner.</p>

<p>He lived in a big substantial-looking house on the seafront
between Brighton and Glenelg. A far-seeing speculator, he had
years before bought a large stretch of land on the foreshore and
he was now reaping the benefit of his enterprise. Upon part of
the land he had built houses which he let to about a dozen
tenants, but upon the best portion he had erected a beautiful
house for his own enjoyment.</p>

<p>The house was built on slightly elevated ground and commanded
a magnificent view of the sea. A wall about seven feet high ran
all round the house and garden, and there was admittance to the
domain only through two gates. One entrance&mdash;the main
one&mdash;was at the back of the garden, and the other, a much
smaller one&mdash;faced the front of the house and led down
towards the sea.</p>

<p>The old man lived with his widowed sister, Mrs. Carter, and a
niece&mdash;the only daughter of a dead brother. There were three
maid-servants and a gardener-chauffeur.</p>

<p>Mr. McIver was very merry at dinner that night and
commiserated with his niece that she had not been at the races in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>His niece was a tall, stately-looking girl, in her twenty-third
year. A decided brunette, she was undeniably very good
looking. She had beautiful dark eyes, and a creamy olive
complexion. She was of a rather reserved disposition, however,
and people generally considered her cold and proud. Apart from
being an heiress, she had many admirers, but she appeared to have
very little interest in the other sex, and so far no one had
succeeded in engaging her affections. She was very fond of her
uncle and looked after him in a motherly sort of way.</p>

<p>"I won over &pound;2,000 to-day," announced Andy, "and if you had
been there you would have joined in the good luck."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, uncle," ejaculated his niece in pretty
surprise, "and what on earth are you going to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Put it in the safe, my girl. I'm too tired to count it
to-night; but what would you and your aunt like for a present?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter always had plenty of wants and the evening was for
the most part passed in animated consideration as to exactly how
many of these multitudinous requirements were going to be
supplied.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the old man retired as usual to his bedroom. It
was a large square room, luxuriously furnished. It had large
French windows that opened right to the ground and led into the
garden at the back.</p>

<p>He passed out into the garden, and crossing a narrow strip of
lawn made his way to a small building directly under the wall,
wherein was housed a big dog of the boar-hound type.</p>

<p>By day the dog was always kept strictly confined behind the
high bars that surrounded his exercise yard, but at night he was
always let free, to roam round the garden and the outside of the
house.</p>

<p>The dog was very ferocious-looking, but in the day-time he was
really quite a good-tempered animal. At nights, however, he was a
very different creature, and it would have gone ill with any
intruder whom he caught prowling round the place.</p>

<p>Andy McIver was very proud of the animal and always felt quite
safe under his protection in the hours of darkness.</p>

<p>He never troubled about locking any of the doors or windows of
the house.</p>

<p>The carriage gate and the little gate in front were the only
places that were ever locked at all.</p>

<p>The old man unloosed the dog and immediately he treated
himself as usual to a good scamper round the grounds. It was a
beautiful moonlight night and his master affectionately regarded
the great beast enjoying his run.</p>

<p>"You were quite mistaken, Mr. Good-looking Inspector," he
chuckled to himself, "quite mistaken. There'll be no danger to
anyone here as long as Vulcan's about. He's as good as a whole
squad of your police. Hullo, old chap, what is it, what is it?"
for the dog had suddenly stopped in his mad gallop and, instead,
was sniffing about in short circles on the lawn. "What have you
found? Come here, Vulcan, come here."</p>

<p>Reluctantly, so it seemed, the great beast advanced to his
master. "Good old Vulcan, you're a dear old thing, aren't you?"
and bending down he squeezed the great big head between his
hands. "So you love the old man, do you? Well, the old man must
go in now, for he's not as young as he used to be and wants his
bed. Good night, old boy, good night," and with a last look round
at the tranquil beauty of the scene Andy McIver went back into
the house.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE CRIME</h2>

<p class="first">IT was the next morning, Sunday morning, a few
minutes after eight. Inspector Romilly had just come on duty at
the Police headquarters in Victoria Square when the telephone
bell rang sharply. He picked up the receiver.</p>

<p>"Police headquarters, Inspector Romilly, what is it?
What&mdash;where&mdash;at Clyde House, Glenelg? At Mr.
McIver's&mdash;what, Mr. McIver himself? Good Lord! Who's
speaking?"</p>

<p>For about a minute the inspector stood intently listening;
then he rapped out quickly,</p>

<p>"All right, we'll be there in less than half an hour. Leave
everything exactly as it is and see that no one goes off the
premises till I come, you understand? Be very strict about it,"
and he hung up the receiver with a jerk.</p>

<p>"Murder, Sergeant," he said with a very white face to another
officer in the room, "at Clyde House, Glenelg. Old Mr. McIver
strangled in his sleep. I knew him well. I'm going at once. I
want three men with me. Ring up Dr. O'Grady and tell him I'm
calling for him on my way. Now be quick, please."</p>

<p>In five and twenty minutes at most a large police car pulled
up sharply at the gate of Clyde House.</p>

<p>The gates were shut but a policeman was on watch inside and
immediately opened them to admit the occupants of the car.</p>

<p>"How many of you are there here?" asked Inspector Romilly who
was the first to get out of the car.</p>

<p>"Three, sir," replied the man saluting. "Sergeant Crow's in
the house."</p>

<p>"Well, shut the gate again. We won't bring in the car," and
the inspector, accompanied by Dr. O'Grady, the Senior Surgeon of
the Police, approached the house.</p>

<p>A stout police sergeant met them at the door.</p>

<p>"You've been very quick, sir," he whispered, "I hardly
expected you so soon. Not the slightest thing's been moved and
everything is exactly as we found it. Everyone, too, who slept
here is still in the house."</p>

<p>Quickly but quietly the three men entered the chamber of
death.</p>

<p>There was a large bed in the middle of the room. The bedstead
was of plain brass and the rails were large and wide between.</p>

<p>On the bed lay a dreadful huddled form. The limbs were turned
and twisted and the face was swollen and of a blackish colour.
The body was at the top end of the bed with the head pulled close
up to the rails. One arm was bent back through the rails.</p>

<p>There was a thin cord round the neck, with the loose ends
trailing through the rails on to the floor at the back of the
bed.</p>

<p>The head was forced almost at right angles to the body and the
chin was bent forward towards the chest.</p>

<p>The inspector moistened his lips.</p>

<p>"Unpleasant form of death," enunciated the police surgeon
professionally; "see how he fought for breath. And yet&mdash;yet
he couldn't have been conscious very long." The surgeon pointed
with his finger&mdash;"See those knots in the cord there, one on
each side of his neck. Well, the man who tied those knew
something anyhow. They are pressing on the great vessels of the
neck and the pressure there would bring unconsciousness very
soon, much quicker than just squeezing the cord round. I don't
suppose the poor chap made even a sound."</p>

<p>The inspector drew in a deep breath.</p>

<p>"I knew him well," he said hoarsely. "I spoke to him yesterday
after the races. He had a lot of money on him. I warned him. I
warned him."</p>

<p>The surgeon went on with his examination.</p>

<p>"No rigor mortis yet, no stiffness: see, the body's hardly
cold. How old was he? About sixty-five. Well, he can't have been
dead much more than six hours: probably he was killed just before
dawn. I'm going to take off the cord now."</p>

<p>In a few seconds he held it up. "About five feet," he went on.
"It looks like window cord, but I leave that to you." He looked
thoughtfully at the body. "Yes, the pressure from those knots
would very quickly induce coma. There's about six or seven inches
between them and the distance is just right. Yes, a man with some
anatomical knowledge did this, I should say."</p>

<p>For some minutes there was silence in the room. "Well, I've
finished all I want to," said the surgeon at length.
"Everything's quite plain. I'll do the post mortem this
afternoon. Kindly find out for me what the deceased had for his
last meal and exactly what time he took it. That will help me to
determine the exact time he was killed. Now is there any way I
can help you, anything you'd like to know?"</p>

<p>"You might please just construct the exact way he was killed,
doctor," replied the inspector. "I take it the murderer must have
been a fairly strong man."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily anything very out of the ordinary. You see,
he had his victim so completely at his mercy that, once the cord
was on, everything was plain sailing. He came behind the bed here
and very gently adjusted the cord. You will probably find the
deceased was a heavy sleeper. Well, he crossed the cord over and
got it into the exact position before he exerted any pressure.
Then he pulled it tight suddenly and forced the head as you see
it, right up against the rails. He jerked the man up above the
pillow. He must have used some considerable force there, but if
he put his foot against the bottom rail here he was in an ideal
position for exerting all his strength. You follow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, doctor, but how long would he have to hold on?"</p>

<p>"Three minutes at the outside."</p>

<p>"And how would he know his man was dead?"</p>

<p>"By the relaxing of all the muscles of the body. He could very
easily tell when it was safe to leave go, the collapse would be
so complete." The surgeon delicately fingered the dead man's
neck. "Quite, quite scientifically done. Yes, I should say the
stranger was certainly no ignorant man."</p>

<p>For quite half an hour after the police surgeon had left, the
inspector remained by himself alone in the room. As far as
possible, without touching anything, he examined everything
minutely. Every part of the chamber he placed under review and
the reason for the particular position of each article of
furniture was carefully weighed up in his mind. For quite the
last ten minutes of his stay he stood perfectly still. Only his
eyes moved very thoughtfully round and round the room. Then he
pulled a sheet over the body of the dead man, and abruptly went
out.</p>

<p>He spoke a few hurried words to the sergeant in the hall and
then asked for one of the maids to be sent to him.</p>

<p>"Please ask Miss McIver," he said, when the girl almost
immediately appeared, "if I can speak to her for a minute. Tell
her it's Inspector Romilly of the Adelaide Police. I'll wait in
the dining-room."</p>

<p>The dining-room was a long room facing the sea and like all
other rooms of the house it told of the luxury and ease that
money alone can buy. The inspector was just sadly considering
from how many beautiful things the murdered man had been cut off
when Maude McIver came in.</p>

<p>She was ghastly pale and there was a look of frozen horror on
her face, but for all that she had lost none of her dignity, and
it was with the coldest little bow possible that she now greeted
the inspector.</p>

<p>"You asked for me," she said quietly, "I'm Miss McIver." The
inspector instantly took in everything about her. He noticed the
proud, clear-cut features, the beautiful dark eyes, and the
queenly head with its wealth of rich dark hair. He thought with a
pang that she was very lovely.</p>

<p>"Yes, I had to send for you," he replied gently. "It's my duty
to speak to you all. I have to see everybody who slept in the
house. It's a ghastly business for you, Miss McIver, but
unhappily it must be gone through. Now can you help me in any
way? You have four servants here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, none of them could have done it," she answered quickly.
"It would be impossible to think so."</p>

<p>"I don't think so, either, although I haven't seen them; but
please tell me about them."</p>

<p>"They've all been with us a long time."</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"The cook since I was a little girl, and the other two for
more than four years."</p>

<p>"And the chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"Since he was a boy&mdash;he's about twenty-five now."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to see them now, please, and afterwards I'll
have to bother you again. You, I expect, will be able to help me
more than the others."</p>

<p>The cook came in first. She looked very frightened.</p>

<p>"You're the cook here, aren't you?" said the inspector
pleasantly. "No, don't be frightened. I just want to ask you one
or two things. You were the first to go into your master's
room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You go in first always, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I take him his cup of tea at half-past seven."</p>

<p>"Well, what happened this morning? No, don't cry. Be a woman.
Remember we want to punish the man who hurt your master. Now tell
me, you went in as usual?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I knocked and opened the door and took in his cup
of tea."</p>

<p>"You didn't notice anything until after you had put down the
cup of tea on the table?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I never usually look at the master at all when I go
in. I just put the cup on the table and go out."</p>

<p>"Well, what made you look at him this morning?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite know, sir, but I think it was because the
curtains were pulled across the big French windows. Master never
does pull them in the summer. He says they keep the air out."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you do when you saw your poor master this
morning?"</p>

<p>"I ran at once and called Miss Maude."</p>

<p>"You didn't touch anything in the room?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, and I haven't been there since."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. Now can you think of anything to help me;
anything unusual. Did you hear any noise in the night?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, nothing at all."</p>

<p>The cook was dismissed and the two other girls called in. They
knew nothing, however, and the inspector passed quickly to
examine the gardener-chauffeur&mdash;Jack Iredale. He was an
open-faced, pleasant young fellow and at once impressed the
inspector favourably.</p>

<p>"Now, Jack," said the inspector coming at once to the point,
"tell me all you can to help me. We want to catch that damned
brute who killed your master, and perhaps the most trivial thing
you tell me may help me find him. You sleep over the garage,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, at the end of the garden."</p>

<p>"Well, what time did you go to bed last night?"</p>

<p>"Just before ten."</p>

<p>"Before your master?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Well, he never goes before ten and, besides, I heard him when
I was in bed talking in the garden."</p>

<p>"Who was he talking to?"</p>

<p>"Vulcan, the dog, sir; I heard him undo its gate when he let
him out."</p>

<p>"Did he always let him out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, always the last thing, so that he could run about the
garden during the night."</p>

<p>"Well, did you hear any noise during the night?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I slept until just before six and then I got up at
once."</p>

<p>"Who told you your master was dead?"</p>

<p>"Cook. She came running down as I was cleaning the car."</p>

<p>"You have charge of the dog, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I do everything for him, except to let him loose at
night, master always did that."</p>

<p>"You shut him up in the morning, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I always shut him up when I come down, and give him his
breakfast in the yard."</p>

<p>"Where was he when you came down this morning? Was he in the
garden I mean?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, he was asleep in his yard."</p>

<p>"Is that usual?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur hesitated for a moment and then replied slowly.
"No, sir, it isn't quite usual, as least not in fine weather like
this. In wet weather he always goes in, but when it's sunny I
generally find him out on the lawn."</p>

<p>"Then what do you think made him go in this morning?"</p>

<p>The man seemed puzzled. "I don't know," he replied lamely. "I
never thought."</p>

<p>"He's supposed to be a good watch dog, isn't he?"</p>

<p>The young fellow brightened up at once. "Oh yes, and he is
too. He won't let a cat even come into the garden at night. He
hears almost when a leaf falls and can smell ever so long after
if a stranger's gone up the path."</p>

<p>The inspector sniffed doubtfully. "How do you account then,"
he asked very sternly, "for the fact that he let some unknown man
come in last night and murder your master. Remember, whoever came
in crossed the garden twice, with an interval of perhaps ten
minutes between, and he had to cross over not only the lawn but
over the path as well. How could the dog not have heard?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur looked mystified and uncomfortable. "That's what
I can't make out. I don't understand it at all."</p>

<p>"The dog's all right this morning, isn't he?" went on the
inspector sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, at least I think so. He went at once to his food when
I put it down."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll go out and see."</p>

<p>The dog's enclosure was not fifty yards from the house and the
inspector was soon standing before the bars.</p>

<p>"Let him out," he said curtly, "we'll see what he does."</p>

<p>But the big hound showed no inclination to come out. He did
not get up even but just stared stonily at the two men.</p>

<p>"Why, he's not eaten any of his biscuit," exclaimed the
chauffeur suddenly; "it's just as I gave it to him. He's been
sick too and he looks funny."</p>

<p>"You great calf," snarled Inspector Romilly angrily, "can't
you see the brute's been doped? Look at the droop of his eyes.
Can't you see it yourself, man? Where's your intelligence? You're
a fool."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, sir."</p>

<p>"Sorry&mdash;what's the good of being sorry? It's men like you
that make it so easy for rogues to live. But come now, was he
like this last night? Was he doped then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I'm positive of that. He was quite lively and
jumping against the bars to be let out; besides, I heard him
growling."</p>

<p>"You heard him growling&mdash;when was he growling?"</p>

<p>"A little while before I went to bed, about a quarter to ten.
I thought he'd heard some cat."</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly eyed the young man icily up and down.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a bright young fellow, aren't you?" he sneered
bitterly. "Here I've been talking to you all this while and now
at the end you just mention casually and quite by chance what
ought to have stuck out in your mind from the very first. Your
master's been murdered and everybody's been considering and
puzzling how the murderer got in. You remember the dog growling
before he was let out and yet&mdash;you forgot to say anything
about it. Now isn't it enough to make even a policeman
swear?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur looked very crestfallen.</p>

<p>"I'm very upset, sir," he mumbled. "I can't think of anything
properly."</p>

<p>"Of course you've been upset," went on the inspector testily,
"but tell me, quickly now, did he growl for long?"</p>

<p>"No, only three or four times at the most. He couldn't have
seen anyone in the garden or he'd have made no end of a fuss. If
anyone had been over here getting into master's room, he'd have
seen him at once, for the moon last night made everything as
plain as day. Besides, if a stranger had passed anywhere here
Vulcan would have nosed it at once directly master let him out.
He can smell a strange track I say hours after, when anyone has
passed by."</p>

<p>The chauffeur waxed quite eloquent in his anxiety, to make his
point, and for the first time that morning the grim face of the
inspector relaxed into a smile.</p>

<p>"Good," he said encouragingly, "now at last you're beginning
to reason and think."</p>

<p>For some few minutes longer the two men remained in
conversation and then the inspector re-entered the house and
asked for Mrs. Carter. The examination here was very brief. Mrs.
Carter was quite hopeless, very hysterical, and rather rude. She
seemed to resent it as an insult that the inspector wanted to
question her at all.</p>

<p>The latter soon finished with her, and asked for Miss McIver
again.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry to distress you," said the inspector gently
when the girl appeared, "but I want you to come into the room
with me. No&mdash;everything's been covered on the bed. What I
want you for is this. I understand you always help the maids in
doing your uncle's room. Well, I want you to come and look
carefully round and tell me exactly what has been moved; to tell
me, in any way, what is different now from the usual order and
placing of everything. You see, the most trivial thing may any
time start us on the right trail."</p>

<p>The girl made no reply but at once led the way to her uncle's
room. She held her head up bravely and the inspector, as he
walked behind her, noted with admiration that there was no
trembling whatsoever about the beautiful white hand that hung
listlessly by her side.</p>

<p>They entered the chamber and the girl stood silently looking
round.</p>

<p>"Now don't be in a hurry," said the inspector, and he
purposely made his voice as business-like as he possibly could.
"Just look over everything carefully before you speak."</p>

<p>The girl stood for a long while quite still, and then in a low
voice she said wearily to the inspector,</p>

<p>"There's nothing very much different. The curtains are drawn
when they shouldn't be, that stool there is never so near the
wall, and my uncle never put his hair-brush on that side of the
dressing-table. His diamond ring is gone, too."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked the inspector quietly; "are you quite
sure?"</p>

<p>"The door of the safe's open, of course, and my uncle never
threw his clothes about like that, but," and she shook her head
and sighed, "I don't see anything else."</p>

<p>"Do the curtains make any noise when you draw them?" asked the
inspector thoughtfully. "Whoever came in would have to draw the
curtains if he was going to use any light&mdash;even an electric
torch, and he'd have to have a light to go through the safe."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they're so high that you have to swing them hard
when you draw them. The brass rings are big and they always
rattle on the rod."</p>

<p>"Then, if they were drawn in the usual way in the middle of
the night, the sound could be heard outside this room, even with
the door closed."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;easily. They make quite a noise."</p>

<p>The inspector walked up to the curtains and swung one of them
back. The rings clanged loudly on the brass rod.</p>

<p>"So the man had to stand on something to draw them without
making any noise," he said to the girl, "and if the stool's been
moved, as you say, he probably stood on that. Now why should he
bring that stool up, when the chair there was so much nearer? Let
me think."</p>

<p>He went over and examined the stool. "Yes, the cloth here's
been smoothed straight. He evidently didn't want to leave the
marks of his feet and show it had been used. But why didn't he
use the chair? it's about the same height. I should say he's
probably a heavy man, and the chair didn't appear solid enough to
bear his weight. Now I'll try the height."</p>

<p>He moved the stool to the side of the curtains and stood up on
it. He stretched up his arm and could just reach the curtain
rings.</p>

<p>"I'm five feet eleven," he went on, musingly, "and if he was
as tall as I am he could move them too. If he wasn't then he'd
have to have had something to help him. Ah! that's where the
brush would come in&mdash;he'd get another eight inches
then."</p>

<p>He turned to the girl. "You're quite positive the brush had
been moved?"</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;my uncle was most methodical and always put
everything in the same place."</p>

<p>"Well, I may, of course, be wrong, but things rather point to
a person shorter than myself and heavier. Now I want you to look
at the safe, please. Do you know what was inside?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "I never had anything to do with it,"
she said, "and don't know anything about what's inside, but he
told us something at dinner last night."</p>

<p>She paused for a moment to get control of her voice. "He told
us he had won over &pound;2,000 at the races yesterday and was going to
put the money in the safe."</p>

<p>"Did he put it in, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard the safe door bang soon after he had come in
from going to see Vulcan."</p>

<p>"It was those notes the murderer came after, Miss McIver,"
said the inspector sternly. "They're gone now. I spoke to your
uncle on the course yesterday and he told me what he'd won.
Unhappily I wasn't the only one that knew; he made no secret
about it."</p>

<p>There was a silence for a moment and the girl choked back a
sob.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss McIver," said the inspector at once. "Please
go now. You've been very brave. There'll be the inquest to-morrow
and you'll have to come. I shall have to see you again myself,
too. It's an awful time for you, I know, but I'll take care
you're bothered as little as possible. Thank you again."</p>

<p>The girl inclined her head ever so little and their eyes met.
How beautiful and liquid were hers, thought the inspector, and
then he frowned crossly to himself.</p>

<p>He found Sergeant Crow outside and together they proceeded to
examine the garden.</p>

<p>"Now where did he get over?" queried the inspector. "Most
likely at the back. He doped the dog somehow and knew the coast
was clear there. In the front some of the girls might have been
awake and seen him. We must go over every inch of the wall."</p>

<p>But very quickly they found out all they wanted. At the corner
of the garden farthest away from the garage there were
unmistakable marks of footprints on the celery bed, and a few
yards distant a turned-up seed box propped against the wall
showed clearly how the intruder had made his exit.</p>

<p>On the other side of the wall, corresponding with the
disturbance in the celery bed, a stout gimlet had been screwed
into the mortar between the bricks&mdash;giving a sure foothold
for anyone who had wanted to climb up. Some attempt had evidently
been made to withdraw the gimlet but the wooden handle had
apparently come off, and the steel blade had been abandoned where
it was.</p>

<p>"Looks as if he knew the place well," remarked the inspector
thoughtfully, "and had nothing to leave to chance. I don't think
we need worry any further about how he got over, eh? It's quite
clear to my mind. Now we'll get a vet. down and find out what we
can about that dog."</p>

<p>The veterinary surgeon nodded his head grimly immediately he
was brought up to the great boar hound.</p>

<p>"Opium, opium," he said decisively, "not the slightest doubt.
Look at the pupils of his eyes&mdash;just pin points. Poor brute,
he's feeling very sorry for himself, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"How do you think it was given him?" asked the inspector.</p>

<p>"In a bit of meat probably. Dogs are the easiest things in the
world to poison if you tuck the stuff away in something tasty.
He's been pretty bad, too, this chap here. He'll get over it now
but he won't be right for a couple of days. When do you reckon he
got the dose?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's mostly guessing, doctor, but we think he picked it
up directly he was let loose last night, just after ten o'clock.
I suppose he'd have found it pretty easily if it were thrown,
say, on the lawn there?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, at once. It might have been rubbed, too, with a drop
of aniseed to attract him and then he'd have smelt it a mile
away."</p>

<p>"Now, suppose he picked it up about ten," went on the
inspector; "when would it begin to act?"</p>

<p>"Well that, of course, would depend entirely on the form in
which it was given. If it was given him in powder, which was
probably the case, he would begin to feel the effect in about an
hour, and in three to four hours at most he would be quite
unconscious and in a state of absolute coma."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't the dog die?"</p>

<p>"They gave him too much probably, and it made him sick. It was
being sick that saved him. You see, his poisoner made the common
mistake of thinking a big dog necessarily required a big dose. It
isn't so. These big dogs are peculiarly susceptible to some
drugs, particularly to narcotics, and a very little brings them
quickly under its influence. Give them a big dose and they're
generally sick at once, and so get rid of most of the poison.
Don't you make any mistake&mdash;this dog was intended to die and
he's had a narrow escape, I can tell you."</p>

<p>Later in the day the inspector rang up Miss McIver. "Don't
worry about to-night please," he told her. "You shall be well
protected and, if you would like it, one of my men shall sleep in
the house&mdash;not for a moment that we expect anything, but
just to reassure you. Now another thing I want to tell you. If
any of you hear noises about you're not to be afraid. We're going
to try and get some idea of what went on outside in the garden
last night and we may be about late. You might kindly tell the
chauffeur and ask him to have the dog shut up."</p>

<p><br>
About a quarter to ten that night Inspector Romilly and two
plain-clothes detectives were standing outside the garden wall of
Clyde House. It was a beautiful still summer night, and the moon
shone clearly and bathed everything in silver radiance.</p>

<p>The inspector seemed quite cheerful. "We are lucky," he
whispered to his companions, "to have everything almost exactly
as it was last night. We are practically in the identical
surroundings that the murderer was then, and I want to do
everything exactly as he did, and according to time table. If we
carefully follow all his known lines of action they may lead us
to the unknown lines too."</p>

<p>Still keeping outside they moved up to the wall behind the
dog's house.</p>

<p>"Now this is where he probably stood," the inspector went on,
"precisely at this time last night. He knew exactly where to
throw the piece of doped meat. We can take it for granted all
along that he knew everything about the garden and house.
Everything points to careful premeditation and preparation, and
my opinion is that he did nothing unless there was a clear reason
for it. Well, he couldn't throw the meat directly over into the
dog's yard because of the iron roof that almost covers
it&mdash;so he threw it on the bit of lawn there, just in front,
where the dog would be certain to find it directly he came out.
The dog heard something to disturb him and started growling.
Probably he only heard the piece of meat falling on the lawn, for
the chauffeur says he only growled once or twice and then
stopped. I don't think for a moment the man himself could have
been in the garden then. He couldn't have dared risk the dog
scenting him when he got out. So, as I say, he threw the meat on
to the lawn, it being the only certain place where the dog would
find it at once. Well, he could only have thrown it on the lawn
from somewhere about here. Now let's look round."</p>

<p>"He must have taken a big risk," remarked one of the
detectives, "if he came and stood here in the open moonlight. He
was in plain view of the front of that house there and anyone
might have been about and seen him."</p>

<p>He pointed to a house that stood among some trees about two
hundred and fifty yards away. It was quite a small house, painted
white, and stood about a hundred yards on the other side of the
road which ran by the end of the dead man's garden.</p>

<p>"Is it occupied do you know?" asked the inspector.</p>

<p>"Yes, there was a light in one of the side rooms as we
passed."</p>

<p>The inspector measured the distance from the house with his
eye. "Less than three hundred yards," he said at length. "Yes, as
you say, anyone here could have been easily seen, but I don't
suppose the man stopped here. He would have just flung the meat
over as he walked along. Well, we'll go now to where we know for
certain he got over the wall, where he screwed the gimlet between
the bricks."</p>

<p>The detectives had not seen the place before and for some
minutes there was a quiet but animated discussion among the three
men.</p>

<p>"What I don't understand," remarked the inspector
thoughtfully, "is why he chose to get over the wall here. He had
to traverse a much further length of the garden than if he'd got
over on the other side and he's still in full view of that white
house, too. He seems to have been taking chances here that one
wouldn't expect."</p>

<p>"Well," argued one of the detectives, "if he'd got over the
other side he'd have had two houses in view of him. He could have
been seen from either of those big ones there."</p>

<p>"Yes, but they're much farther away, a good hundred yards
farther at least," remarked the inspector, "and as a set-off
against the very small added risk there he'd have had a much
shorter and safer passage in the garden. He wouldn't have had to
go near the garage, where he knew for certain there was the
probability of being seen if accidentally he made the slightest
noise. Getting over here as he did, he had to pass right in front
of the garage both going and coming, and, as I say, the slightest
sound might have upset everything."</p>

<p>There was a long silence and the three of them stood thinking
hard.</p>

<p>"I think we'd better have a look at that white house," said
one of the detectives, suddenly. "When you come to think of it,
there does seem something funny about the beggar seeming quite to
ignore the idea of any danger there."</p>

<p>"A very good idea, Jackson," replied the inspector. "We've a
good three hours to wait to the time he strangled
McIver&mdash;Dr. O'Grady reckoned he wasn't killed until about
two&mdash;and between now and then we'll have a good look at that
house. It'll be interesting at all events to see how this place
looks from over there."</p>

<p>"We'd better go round to it quietly from the back," said the
detective. "It might frighten anybody out of their lives if they
saw three men coming up, after what happened last night."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," replied the inspector. "Whoever lives
there mustn't see us at all. We'll go round by the sea first. But
just a moment, before we leave here. One thing begins to puzzle
me a lot." The inspector paused for quite a long time and then
said very impressively&mdash;"If the murderer threw the doped
meat over at a quarter to ten and strangled McIver about two,
what did he do with himself during those intervening four
hours?"</p>

<p>The three men looked at one another without speaking. Long
accustomed to crime as they all were, they seemed awed for the
moment at what their imaginations conjured up.</p>

<p>The murderer had prepared for his ghastly work, he had got
everything ready and had made his first step towards the destined
goal in the chamber of death. Then for four long hours he had had
to remain inactive, waiting, watching and full of suspense.
However great his courage, what must have been his thoughts as he
lay crouching somewhere like some foul beast of prey? They could
picture him in the black sweat and torture of his own doubts.</p>

<p>"Look here," said the inspector presently, "what I want to
know is where he went. He couldn't have just thrown the poison
over and then have gone away and come back quite casually in four
hours. He would have to remain in touch with the place the whole
time. There were a lot of things he would want to know. He would
want to make sure that the dog had taken the meat and that the
dope had acted somehow. He would want to know too that they
hadn't found out anything about it. The chauffeur might have gone
out late to meet a girl and come home and found the dog poisoned
and roused the house. He would have to be certain of a lot of
things and I don't see how he would have dared to let the place
out of his sight even for a single minute. Well, where could he
hide; from where could he safely watch the place? Mind you, it
was for four hours, not for two minutes or a quarter of an hour.
Now where did he go?"</p>

<p>"It isn't possible for a moment," said Jackson, one of the
plain-clothes men, "that he walked round and round the place the
whole time. He couldn't risk attracting attention. He couldn't
hide in the sand either, for then he would be missing everything
that might go on in the house. But I agree with you that he must
have watched from somewhere."</p>

<p>The three men moved off towards the sea and for more than two
hours went carefully over the surrounding country. Towards one
o'clock they were stealthily making their way towards the white
house that they had noticed earlier in the night. Their
wanderings had taken them in a wide circle and they were now
approaching the house from the back. Their approach was quite
hidden by a small clump of trees.</p>

<p>"We can get to within a hundred yards," whispered the
inspector. "It will never do for us to be seen. As you said, it
might terrify the people in the house."</p>

<p>They crawled carefully between the trees and rounding a small
hillock of sand came suddenly in view of Clyde House.</p>

<p>The inspector drew in his breath sharply. "My word," he
muttered, "the very place to keep watch. Just what the beggar
wanted."</p>

<p>He might well have been surprised, for from where they lay,
not only the house but almost every part of the garden came
easily under view. They could see the dog's enclosure, the strip
of lawn in front, the door of the garage, and the long French
windows of the dead man's room. The house itself was not three
hundred yards away and with the moon bright as it now was, even
small objects in the garden could be picked out easily with the
naked eye.</p>

<p>The inspector fished up a pair of small opera glasses from the
depths of his coat pocket and focussed them on the house.</p>

<p>"By Jove," he went on to himself, "what a soft thing if he was
watching from here. With a pair of binoculars he would have seen
right into McIver's bedroom and probably have been able to see
him go to the safe too."</p>

<p>For several minutes the watchers lay silent on the sand and
the inspector was just on the point of suggesting an equally
silent retreat, when he suddenly felt someone grip his arm
tightly and Jackson whispered very closely to his ear.</p>

<p>"Look on the verandah there, on the bed. We're not the only
ones watching here it seems."</p>

<p>The inspector whipped his glasses round at once in the
direction indicated.</p>

<p>They were close to the small white house, and rather to the
side of it. They could, however, just see the end of the verandah
running in the front, and there was a bed there. On the bed was a
man. He must have been there when they first arrived, but
apparently he had been lying down then, and had escaped their
notice. Now, however, he was leaning up on his elbow and intently
gazing through a large pair of binoculars undoubtedly turned in
the direction of Clyde House.</p>

<p>For a full minute he remained absolutely motionless, then he
abruptly lowered the glasses and his head immediately disappeared
from view.</p>

<p>"Good Lord," whispered the inspector, "can it possibly be the
man we're after? It's been too jolly easy to be true."</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour they waited expectantly and then up
came the man's head again. About a minute's intent stare and then
down again went everything as before.</p>

<p>The same thing happened twice and then the inspector, signing
to his two companions to follow him, wriggled cautiously back
along the sand between the trees.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said impressively when he was quite sure he
was out of earshot of the watcher on the verandah, "we must know
about the people in this house. Certainly it looks peculiar. It
may be only morbid curiosity, of course. It's quite natural that
they should be interested now in what's going on, even perhaps to
the point of missing part of a night's rest, but still it looks
funny, and we'll inquire well into them to-morrow. In the
meantime I must get back to the garden there; it's nearly two
o'clock. I particularly want to see how the moon served that man
last night when he got into McIver's room. But it isn't necessary
we should all go, and you, Jackson, can wait here and see exactly
what this johnny does when he sees us go over the wall. Here are
my opera glasses; go back to where we were lying and keep an eye
on him the whole time. You will see us come out of the garden and
half an hour later we'll be waiting for you in the car just by
the jetty. You understand?"</p>

<p>Leaving Jackson to watch by himself the inspector and the
other detective by a roundabout way returned to Clyde House. They
got over the wall in exactly the same place the intruder had
selected on the previous night, and making their way slowly
across the garden arrived at the long French windows of the
murdered man's room.</p>

<p>They peered through them. The body had been removed that
afternoon to the city, but they could see the bed in exactly the
same position that it had always been. Fully half of the chamber
was bathed in the moonlight, but the bed itself and all behind it
were buried in the shadows.</p>

<p>"As I thought," muttered Inspector Romilly. "He would have
required no electric torch to set about his bloody work. He
wanted the torch only when he came to look inside the safe, and
that's why he drew the curtains. Any light could have been seen
from the chauffeur's room."</p>

<p>For a few minutes they stood looking thoughtfully into the
room and then they returned slowly the way they had come.</p>

<p>"I don't think there's anything more to be learnt just now,"
said the inspector when they were over the wall again. "We know
for certain, however, that the murder was no chance crime.
Everything was deliberately planned and the man knew the premises
from A to Z. Now we'll go and wait for Jackson."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Jackson joined them at the jetty as
arranged. He had little to tell but what he did tell the
inspector considered very interesting.</p>

<p>"Of course, I saw everything you did," the detective said,
"and could even easily distinguish between you. The man on the
verandah wasn't watching you the whole time. He missed you going
over the wall, but he bobbed his head up when you were standing
before the window and never moved his glasses from you after
that. When you had gone out of sight he got off the bed and went
inside the house. I saw a light come up then at the back of the
house. It looked like the kitchen, I think. I waited about five
minutes but he didn't come out again. He evidently knew he had
come to the end of the show."</p>

<p>The inspector made no particular remark and almost in complete
silence the three men motored back to the city.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE SUSPICION OF THE INSPECTOR</h2>

<p class="first">THE crime at Clyde House created a great
sensation not only in the State of South Australia, but
throughout the whole great Commonwealth itself.</p>

<p>The well-known personality of the dead man both in commercial
and sporting circles, the dreadful and baffling nature of the
crime, and the apparent ease with which the murderer had escaped
with his booty, all tended to excite the interest of the
community to fever point.</p>

<p>The newspapers naturally made a great feature of the case and
everything was discussed and considered from all points. It was
generally conceded, however, that the murderer would never be
caught. The police authorities had been most reticent at the
inquest, but their reticence was only believed to cover an entire
absence of any clues likely to lead to the apprehension of the
criminal.</p>

<p>The sole remaining brother of the dead man, Mr. Thomas McIver,
a wealthy squatter, came down to the city post haste from Broken
Hill. He was very much upset at the awful end of his brother, and
immediately offered a reward of &pound;2,000 for the discovery of the
murderer.</p>

<p>"That ought to make someone speak," he said confidently; "and
if it's the work of a gang, as it probably is, it may make it
difficult for them to hang together. If any blackguard knows
about the murder and didn't actually do it himself&mdash;as
likely as not now he'll come forward and give us information on
the quiet."</p>

<p>He called on Inspector Romilly at Victoria Square&mdash;the
Scotland Yard of South Australia&mdash;and told him what he was
doing about the reward and of his hopes of getting news through
some member of a gang.</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head doubtfully. "I only hope you may
be successful, Mr. McIver, but, myself, I am quite sure it was
the work of only one man."</p>

<p>"One man?" asked his visitor frowning, "but what makes you
think that?"</p>

<p>The inspector was at some trouble to explain. "Well, you see,"
he said, "in minor crimes criminals often work together, but in
crimes like murder, deliberate murder, they invariably work
alone. And if you think for a moment, you will at once see why.
However many men may be planning a murder, the actual deed must
fall on one man, and one man alone. In the event of discovery, he
has to bear the brunt of the punishment himself. He knows the
others will get off with terms of imprisonment, but it's a
swinging matter for him himself. Why should he risk it
then&mdash;why should he pull the chestnuts out of the fire for
the others?&mdash;for you may be certain he'll only get an equal
share of the plunder if all goes well.</p>

<p>"Besides, another thing&mdash;murderers, deliberate murderers,
are very rare. Men of crime, as a type, fight very shy of
shedding blood, and generally only resort to violence when in a
state of panic or in actual self-defence.</p>

<p>"There was no panic about the killing of your brother&mdash;no
call for self-defence. It was a deliberate, callous, intentional
and most carefully-planned murder. It was in every way the work
of an expert, and I am convinced that if we ever find the man he
will prove to be a master criminal, with some black record of
crime already trailing behind him."</p>

<p>The inspector spoke deliberately and without hesitation and
the brother of the dead man was impressed in spite of himself. He
had come to the city with the casual, poor opinion of the police
that most people usually have, but the few minutes' conversation
he had had with the quiet, confident inspector had quite altered
his view of things.</p>

<p>"He's a fine man, that inspector," he said to his niece that
evening at dinner, "and quite a gentleman too. He told me nothing
in particular of what the police are doing but somehow he made me
feel quite hopeful of things generally. He seemed to have got a
grip somewhere and was just waiting to tighten his hold. You
see&mdash;we shall hear from him soon. I'm sure." And hear from
him they did, almost immediately.</p>

<p>Two days after the funeral Inspector Romilly telephoned Miss
McIver and asked for an appointment, urgently. He came up to
Clyde House that afternoon.</p>

<p>He was a fitting and splendid type of the majesty of the law
in his smart blue uniform, and the parlour-maid who answered the
door privately informed the cook afterwards that he looked as
stern as a judge.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I've nothing to hide," she said thankfully, "for I'm
sure that man would find it out at once if I had. He looks as if
he could read everyone like a book."</p>

<p>He was received in the drawing-room by Miss McIver and her
uncle. The girl gave him a pleasant smile, but her uncle came
forward at once and shook hands.</p>

<p>"I'm very pleased to see you," he said heartily. "I told my
niece yesterday I was sure we should be hearing from you soon.
Have you found out anything now. You haven't got the man?"</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head. "Unfortunately," he said gently,
"things don't move quite so quickly as that. But I want very
particularly to speak to Miss McIver; everything may depend on
what she is able to tell me."</p>

<p>He looked at the girl as he spoke, and again he thought how
beautiful she was. She looked sad and troubled, as she had done
when he had first seen her, but somehow she looked more gentle
now.</p>

<p>Her uncle was decidedly disappointed. "Oh, I did think,
inspector, when you 'phoned up that you at least had something
important to tell us; but never mind, it'll come soon, I've no
doubt. Now, how can my niece help you?"</p>

<p>The inspector, as was his custom, came bluntly to the point.
"Look here, Mr. McIver," he said calmly, "it was your niece I
wanted to speak to&mdash;she's the only one who can help me. I
shall, of course, be very glad if you will be present, but I want
you please to understand that not one whisper of what I am going
to say must get out of this room, or it will spoil
everything."</p>

<p>Thomas McIver was for a moment too indignant to know how to
reply. He quite saw what the inspector meant. The man was
doubtful about his being able to hold his tongue. He was just
framing what he considered a suitable reply when the inspector,
sensing his annoyance, went on quickly: "Pardon me, please, but I
don't know you yet and I don't want our chances, slight as they
unhappily at present seem to be, jeopardised by any indiscretion
straight away. Your poor brother was one of the most generous and
open-hearted men I ever met, but I believe he came to his death
simply through being indiscreet. He let people know too
much."</p>

<p>The girl looked scornfully at him. "I really think," she said
icily, "that we can, both of us, be depended upon to hold our
tongues, if that's all you mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Miss McIver," remonstrated the inspector quickly,
"I don't want to begin by prejudicing anyone against me. I'm only
doing what I consider my duty. What I mean is&mdash;I am going to
say something to you which is so important that if the very
slightest hint of it leaks out everything will instantly be
spoilt. If you mention it, perhaps even to Mrs. Carter, if you
discuss it at meals, or if the servants get any idea of it,
well," and he shrugged his shoulders despondently, "we may lose
our only chance of discovering the murderer."</p>

<p>The girl seemed in no way mollified, and still regarded the
inspector coldly. For the first time, however, it struck her he
was very good-looking. He puzzled her too. Only a policeman as he
was, there was no servility at all about him. He was quite at his
ease, and spoke almost, indeed, as if he were addressing his
inferiors.</p>

<p>Her uncle broke in emphatically. "But you're quite right,
inspector, and I respect you for it&mdash;you don't know me and
it's your duty, as you say, to prevent things leaking out. But
still for all that you can trust me; I'm not an old gas-bag. I
know when to hold my tongue and if you let me into your
confidence you won't regret it."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded his head thoughtfully and for a moment
hesitated as if weighing his words. Then he said very solemnly:
"Miss McIver, I believe the man who killed your uncle passed for
one of his friends."</p>

<p>There was a long silence and the room seemed very still.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the girl at length with a puzzled
frown. "One of his friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one of his friends. A man who knew everything about
him&mdash;who knew his ways of life&mdash;his habits and the
things he always did&mdash;a man who knew this house, and all the
rooms in it, who knew the inmates and who probably has often
shaken you by the hand."</p>

<p>"How do you know it?"</p>

<p>"It seems clear to me now. Listen, and I'll explain. I spoke
to your uncle just after the races on Saturday and one thing in
particular that he told me remains in my mind. He said he had
received &pound;300 on the previous morning which he hadn't expected,
and that he had mentioned to several of his friends that he was
going to the races to give the money a run. Well, he made, as you
know, over &pound;2,000 and someone killed him to get that money. He was
killed because he had that money&mdash;someone killed him who
knew he'd got it. Now do you think for a moment that some
stranger just by chance happened to see your uncle winning money
and there and then made up his mind to break into the house in
the middle of the night and commit a murder to get it? Do you
think such a crime as this was resolved upon only on the spur of
the moment; that someone said to himself just about half past
five after the races on that Saturday evening: 'There goes Mr.
McIver with all that money: I'll go at once and buy some poison
to kill his dog, and then later in the middle of the night I'll
break into where he lives and strangle him to get the notes?' Can
anyone think if the idea of murder only came for the first time
into some strange man's mind when he was on the racecourse that
afternoon&mdash;that he could arrange and carry everything
through, in a few hours, as mathematically as the murderer
did?"</p>

<p>The inspector paused for a reply but neither Mr. McIver nor
his niece spoke. They both regarded him intently. The inspector
went on.</p>

<p>"Now look on the other side. Suppose a so-called friend of
your uncle heard him say on the Friday that he was taking &pound;300 to
bet with at the races the next afternoon, and expected to have a
good day; and suppose the man who heard him say it was secretly a
criminal&mdash;what would he do? Wouldn't he say to himself
'Well, I'll keep an eye on you, Mr. McIver, and if you do happen
to win a decent bit of money I shall know at once how to get it
from you. I know your habits, I know all about your house, I know
about your garden, your chauffeur, your dog and all about your
servants too. I have all the information I require at my fingers'
ends and all I have to do is to get a few things ready in case I
may require them to-morrow night.'</p>

<p>"Now which of these two men I have imagined seems to you the
more likely to have committed the crime&mdash;the stranger who
carried out everything on the spur of the moment, or the man who
deliberately prepared beforehand to murder if he thought it worth
his while?"</p>

<p>Mr. McIver shook his head as if he were not by any means
convinced.</p>

<p>"But why, Mr. Inspector," he asked brusquely, "why do you say
it must have been a friend? Surely there are lots of people who
knew all about my brother and the house without being his
friends. Men who have worked on the premises, for instance.
Carpenters and plumbers and such like."</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir, but I am going on what your brother told me.
He said he had told some of his friends about that &pound;300 and I
suggest that that must have first put the idea of committing the
crime into someone's mind." The inspector turned to Miss McIver.
"You knew your uncle had received a cheque for &pound;300?" he asked
her.</p>

<p>"Yes, it came on Friday morning."</p>

<p>"Could you give me any idea of the friends he met that
day?"</p>

<p>"He hardly saw anyone as it happened. He didn't go up to the
city at all. He took the dog for a run on the sands."</p>

<p>"Was he by himself the whole of the time?"</p>

<p>"No, I think he said he met Major Poole and Mr. Eadie and went
for a short stroll with them."</p>

<p>"Major Poole lives in Glenelg, I know him&mdash;and Mr. Eadie
lives in the white house there across the road. Mr. Eadie's a
tenant of yours, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and my uncle knew him fairly well." The girl smiled
rather sarcastically. "Do you suspect Mr. Eadie?" she asked.</p>

<p>The inspector frowned. "Unhappily, Miss McIver, I suspect
nobody at present," he replied, "but all the same I should like
to learn all I can about this Mr. Eadie. Do you know what he
is?"</p>

<p>"He's nothing now, but he's been an artist, I believe. He's a
highly educated man and he's travelled a lot."</p>

<p>"How long have you known him?"</p>

<p>She thought for a moment. "Under a year&mdash;yes, about nine
months. He came to the White House last autumn."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about him?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "Nothing very much; he lives over
there alone with one man-servant. He goes out very little. He's
rather lame and is not in good health. He has been to lunch here
several times and once to dinner. That's all I know about him, I
think. He's a very interesting man to talk to."</p>

<p>"Does he go to race-meetings, do you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear me no," the girl laughed. "He's a student and I
believe hates all form of sport."</p>

<p>Half an hour later the inspector left. He had got very little
information and was not over-pleased with his progress. He was
more than usually interested, however, in Mr. Eadie and made his
way without delay straight across to the white house.</p>

<p>The little front garden was well stocked with flowers and very
tidy and beautifully kept. "A man of method and order at any
rate," muttered the inspector whimsically to himself as he walked
up the path; "two very essential factors always towards success
in crime."</p>

<p>He rang the front door bell and it was almost immediately
answered by a staid-looking man dressed in black. He was of about
middle age.</p>

<p>"Can I speak to Mr. Eadie, please?" asked the inspector.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir," the man replied very respectfully, "but my
master is out."</p>

<p>"Do you know when he will be in then?"</p>

<p>"I can't say, sir, but not much before eight, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"I suppose you couldn't tell me where I should be likely to
find him? I want to see him rather particularly."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I have no idea where he is."</p>

<p>The inspector stood thoughtfully regarding the man. Here, at
any rate, he told himself disappointedly, there was no cause for
suspicion.</p>

<p>The man before him was of medium height, plump almost to
stoutness, and had the sallow face associated with a life passed
much indoors. He had unmistakably the quiet deferential manner of
one accustomed to receive and obey orders. "An ideal type of a
well-trained gentleman's servant," regretfully thought the
inspector; "nothing doing here."</p>

<p>"Can I give my master any message, sir?" asked the man
respectfully.</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid that wouldn't do," replied the inspector, "I'm
Inspector Romilly, of the Adelaide Police, and I wanted just to
ask him a few questions about the late Mr. McIver. I suppose
you've had lots of people already inquiring here."</p>

<p>Just a flicker of very faint amusement seemed to cross over
the man's face.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and we've had two detectives here too."</p>

<p>"You had nothing to tell us&mdash;I expect&mdash;of anything
you saw or heard on the night of the murder?"</p>

<p>The man looked very grave again. "Unhappily no, sir. You see
master and I nearly always go to bed before ten. My master is not
very strong and we never sit up late. We make up for it by being
early risers."</p>

<p>"Very well," smiled the inspector pleasantly, "I won't bother
you with any more questions, but I'd like to see your master if I
could to-morrow. How would eleven o'clock do?"</p>

<p>"Very nicely, I should think, sir. I am sure my master will
arrange to be in."</p>

<p>Returning to headquarters that night the inspector at once
sent for Detective Jackson.</p>

<p>"When you went up inquiring to the White House tell me what
opinion you formed of that man Eadie's servant?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Harmless and most obliging," replied the detective without
hesitation. "I liked him better than I did his master, too. Mr.
Eadie himself was rather off-hand with us, but I put it down to
his being annoyed because he was hurried out of his bath. He
wasn't ready when we called and his man had to go and fetch him.
As I told you, we got nothing out of them. The master seemed a
bit of a crank, too, and I should say the servant has rather a
bad time."</p>

<p>"Well I'm going to see Mr. Eadie myself to-morrow, but I'm
afraid we shall have to wipe them both off the slate. I agree
with you: the man-servant seemed quite alright."</p>

<p>Punctually at eleven o'clock the next morning, Inspector
Romilly returned to the little white house. It was a glorious
morning, but very hot, and the inspector was not surprised to
find all the sun-blinds down on the verandah.</p>

<p>He had barely touched the bell when a high-pitched voice, and
one that to the visitor sounded rather irritable, called to him
to come in.</p>

<p>"Inspector Romilly, I expect&mdash;please come in. Excuse me
getting up, but my leg's rather bad this morning."</p>

<p>The inspector pulled open the wire door and found himself in
the refreshing coolness of the small lounge hall. The light was
naturally very poor and, coming out of the glaring sunlight, for
a moment he could distinguish little in the place. Soon, however,
his eyes were able to pick out the speaker. The latter was
sitting back on a large wicker chair with one of his legs
stretched out and resting on a stool. Apparently he had been
reading for there was a newspaper on his knees. Seated as he was,
he seemed rather a biggish man.</p>

<p>"Pull that curtain if you don't mind," he went on more
pleasantly, "then we shall be able to see each other better. I
always hate talking to anyone when I can't see his face."</p>

<p>The inspector did as he was bid and pulled back the curtain
that was covering a small window at the side of the hall. It
certainly did improve the light a little, but the hall was still
left in comparative gloom. The man in the chair, however, came
much better into view. His face was tanned to a rather dark
brown, he had a protruding upper lip with rather prominent front
teeth, and he was wearing glasses slightly coloured. He was
stylishly dressed and wore a large diamond pin in his neck-tie.</p>

<p>"Mr. Eadie?" queried Inspector Romilly.</p>

<p>"At your service, Inspector," and the man in the chair
inclined his head courteously. "I understand you want to speak to
me," he drawled. "I am sorry I was out when you called
yesterday."</p>

<p>The inspector was taking everything in and his senses were
very much on the alert. There was nothing whatever suspicious in
the manner of the man he was confronting, but at the same time it
somehow struck him at once that there was something carefully
studied in the reception he was receiving. It seemed to him to
have been rehearsed.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to ask you a few questions, Mr. Eadie," he said
at length. "You were a friend of Mr. McIver, I've heard, and you
went for a walk with him on the Friday, the day before he was
killed, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I had a little walk with him on the sands when he was
exercising his dog."</p>

<p>"Well, what I want to know is&mdash;did he happen to mention
to you that he was going to the races the next day?"</p>

<p>Mr. Eadie hesitated for quite a long while.</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you that for certain, Inspector. He may have
and he may have not. You see, I'm not a bit interested in races
myself and if he had mentioned it to me it would have made no
impression on my mind."</p>

<p>"Then you didn't hear anything about &pound;300 he was taking with
him to bet with?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't hear anything about that."</p>

<p>"But Major Poole says he was talking a lot about it?"</p>

<p>"He may have been but he never usually talked racing to
me."</p>

<p>"Did he meet anyone else when you were with him&mdash;except
Major Poole, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Not when I was with him, but he may easily have done so after
I left, for I came in when they were both still on the
sands."</p>

<p>The inspector was thoughtful for a minute. "You see, our point
is&mdash;the murder over there was premeditated. Mr. McIver was
incautious and let everyone know that he was going to bet in big
ready money, and we believe someone was waiting to take advantage
of it if he won."</p>

<p>Mr. Eadie looked bored. "Very probably," he remarked, "and
quite in accordance with my own views." He sniffed rather
contemptuously. "But I always hold that people who go racing mix
with the very scum. In my opinion they deserve all the risks they
run."</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly felt nettled. "Of course, everybody knows,"
he replied sharply, "that racing appeals to a bad class as well
as to a good. It's a form of adventure and attracts those who are
pleased to take risks. It doesn't appeal to a bad man just
because he happens to be bad but probably simply because he's
venturesome. I've been a policeman fifteen years and I've always
noticed all my life that there is one quality shared equally by
very good men and very bad, and that is&mdash;courage."</p>

<p>"Most interesting, most interesting," sneered the man in the
chair.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the inspector almost angrily. "You mustn't run
down racing because bad men go to it any more than you must decry
coinage because most law-breakers possess it."</p>

<p>Mr. Eadie appeared amused.</p>

<p>"Then, according to you, Mr. Inspector, the criminal is a
rather praiseworthy individual&mdash;a man to be admired,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Not for his crime, but for his courage he may be," returned
the inspector. "Look at the crime here now. Think of the courage
that man must have had. To scale that wall in the dead of night,
to cross over the garden under the full moon, to tiptoe into
McIver's room, knowing that at any moment he might get a bullet
for his pains. Surely what higher form of courage in a way could
you wish to see?"</p>

<p>The inspector stopped abruptly. The expression on the face of
the man in the chair had altered suddenly and it caught his
eye.</p>

<p>Mr. Eadie was no longer sneering.</p>

<p>"Really now," he laughed, "if I were a great criminal, I'm
sure I'd choose you to write my biography. I see you're quite a
student of crime."</p>

<p>The inspector was annoyed. He had come to pump this man and
unwittingly he had been drawn into a discussion in which he had
done most of the talking. He got up to go.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose there's no way in which you can help us?" he
asked as a parting question. "No suggestion to make? You didn't
notice anyone about late that night?"</p>

<p>Mr. Eadie shook his head. "No, we always go to bed before ten.
I'm not very strong and we never sit up late. We make up for it
by being early risers."</p>

<p>The inspector almost started in delight. Now here, at last,
was something suspicious. The master was using exactly the same
formula that his servant had used the previous day and in almost
exactly the same words. "We always go to bed early&mdash;not very
strong&mdash;never sit up after ten&mdash;early risers instead."
Could it possibly be accidental? If not&mdash;then master and man
must have arranged beforehand what they would say&mdash;and that
implied conspiracy and something to hide. What did it mean? He
looked hard at Mr. Eadie and for the first time during the
interview he thought that gentleman looked embarrassed. Was it,
he asked himself, because the man knew he'd made a slip?</p>

<p>But Mr. Eadie at any rate gave the inspector no further time
for reflection. He pressed him hospitably to have a glass of
wine, and upon the inspector's refusing seemed to be quite
disappointed.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate," he said heartily, "never hesitate to come
up at any time if you want to ask me anything. I only hope you
will catch the wretch. My man, Martin, gets quite nervous at
times and wonders if he's going to be the next. Well, good-bye,
if you must go. Excuse me getting up."</p>

<p>All the way back to the city Inspector Romilly was very
thoughtful. Later, alone in his room, he took stock of the whole
situation.</p>

<p>"Now let me see where I am," he said to himself, "and sum up
clearly why I seem to suspect that man. To begin with, he was a
friend of McIver. He knew the house and he knew all McIver's
ways. He talked to him the day before his death, but denies
hearing any mention of that &pound;300. On the other hand, Major Poole
says McIver was full of it, and it would have been unlikely a man
of McIver's temperament would not talk it over with all his
friends, whether they were interested or not. Is the man Eadie
lying then, and if so why? Then there is the position of Eadie's
house. An absolutely ideal spot for the murderer to have worked
from, and if the inmates are implicated it would explain at once
the complete indifference the assassin undoubtedly showed to
being overlooked from that quarter. Then in regard to the man
himself&mdash;does he fit the bill as the probable murderer? I
can't be sure about his height because I have only seen him
sitting down. He certainly is a heavy man but he looks about as
tall as I am. As far as appearances go, however, the man-servant
would better answer to the description I should be inclined to
give of the murderer. He would fit in with my ideas exactly. Now
as to my interview with Eadie to-day, he seemed open and to have
nothing to hide&mdash;but there was something funny in the way he
received me. What was it? He seemed to be posing for me and had
tucked himself away in a corner where the light was not too good.
Apparently he wanted it to appear that he had been reading his
newspaper, but he couldn't have read very comfortably where he
was. It was about the worst place to choose in the hall. I got a
bad view of his face the whole time, although he made a brave
show of asking me to pull that curtain. He must have known it
wouldn't do any good. Why mightn't he have wanted me then to see
his face? Was he afraid I should recognise him as an old lag or
was he disguised? Then he seemed pleased when I said the murderer
must be a man of great courage, but&mdash;I may have imagined
that. Of course, if he had had anything to do with the murder one
would have expected him to be pleased, for most criminals are
always vain. Then he used exactly the same words as his servant:
'Not very strong&mdash;we are early risers instead.' That looks
most damning in one way. Undoubtedly, master and man had agreed
exactly what they should say. Why had they agreed? Had they
anything to hide or was it simply to save themselves the
annoyance of more interviews and more questionings? Then there is
that affair of the man watching on the bed. That looks a bit
suspicious, because they neither of them said anything about it
afterwards. Whoever saw us in the garden of Clyde House that
night&mdash;whichever of them it was&mdash;couldn't have been
positive we were police officers, and if everything were above
board, surely it would have been the most natural thing in the
world for them to have said something about it afterwards? They
would have been only too anxious to mention it. Now, who is this
man Eadie? He's not been here a year and they say he came from
the Malay States. He passes as an artist and is certainly an
educated man. No one knows much about him. He hardly goes
anywhere except to a few shops in Glenelg, and as for his servant
no one appears to have seen him except the McIver people and the
tradesmen who deliver at the door."</p>

<p>The inspector thought for a long while.</p>

<p>"I'm puzzled. I'm puzzled," he muttered slowly. "There's
nothing much to go on and yet&mdash;and yet, instinct, if not
anything else, makes me sure there's something strange about that
house." He frowned thoughtfully. "I'll have him watched," he
exclaimed suddenly; "we'll watch both of that precious pair. No
watching now, I know, will tell us what they did a week ago, but
it may tell us if they are trying to find out if they're being
shadowed and if they act like men upon their guard."</p>

<p>Half an hour later the inspector gave his orders to the
detective Jackson.</p>

<p>"Look here, Jackson," he said sharply, "I want that white
house watched. You and another man&mdash;take Frognal if you
like&mdash;must start on it straightaway. I've arranged for you
to watch from the garage of Clyde House. You must watch day and
night and take it in turns. I want everything they do put down in
black and white; in black and white, mind you. Everything about
Eadie and his man&mdash;on paper, please. As far as you can find
out, I want to know all they do. What time they get up and what
time they go to bed. When they go out and when they come in.
Everything you can tell me. I'm suspicious about them and I want
to find out if they act like men who're afraid they're being
watched. One thing you can tell me now. When you called to see
Eadie the other day, you didn't think he was in any way made up,
did you?"</p>

<p>The detective shook his head. "It never struck me that he was.
When we saw him he was in his dressing-gown, only partly dressed.
The man answered the door and hesitated at first when we said we
must see his master. He said he was in his bath. The man went to
see and we were then asked into the sitting-room and told to
wait. We heard a lot of splashing about and in about ten minutes
Mr. Eadie appeared. His hair was all ruffled and he looked very
savage, he hadn't shaved. No, I don't think he was made up."</p>

<p>"Did you see him plainly&mdash;in a good light, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, I can't say we did that. Everywhere in that house
is dark. McIver's chauffeur says they always pull the sun-blinds
directly they get up."</p>

<p>"Well," continued the inspector, "you know what I want now. An
exact report every twenty-four hours of what goes on and
everything to be written down. I'll send for it every night. Now
mind and don't you be seen. Keep away from the window and
remember those binoculars of his."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY</h2>

<p class="first">THREE days later the detective was again
closeted with Inspector Romilly in his room. The latter looked
worried and his handsome face was drawn up into a puzzled
frown.</p>

<p>"Well, Jackson," he said grimly, "I've read your precious
report and if you stop fidgeting with your feet I'll read it over
again. I've read it a dozen times already, but I want to read it
again as if I'd never read it before. An idea that came to me the
very first time that I read it has developed now almost into a
certainty. I'll read it out and we'll see how it strikes
you."</p>

<p>"Report of watch kept on house of Mr. Charles Eadie, Barton
Road, Glenelg.</p>

<p>Monday 9 P.M. Commenced watch in room over garage in garden of
Clyde House. Noticed one light burning in front room of white
house.</p>

<p>9.45 Light went out.</p>

<p>10.5 Saw someone smoking cigar on front verandah.</p>

<p>10.37 Heard fly-proof door click. Smoker disappeared.</p>

<p>10.40 Someone again smoking cigar on verandah.</p>

<p>Tuesday 7.48 A.M. Man-servant came out on verandah in trousers
and shirt&mdash;stretched himself&mdash;yawned. Pulled down
sun-blinds. Put milk can outside on step. Went back indoors.</p>

<p>7.55 Milkman came and filled milk can.</p>

<p>8.37 Boy threw newspaper on lawn in front of verandah.</p>

<p>8.38 Man-servant came out and fetched paper&mdash;still in
trousers and shirt. Smoking a pipe.</p>

<p>9.2 Baker called. Knocked on back door. Man-servant came
out&mdash;dressed this time. Baker left one loaf.</p>

<p>9.4 Man-servant came out. Watered flowers in front garden.
Left hose sprinkler running on front lawn.</p>

<p>9.13 Man-servant went in.</p>

<p>10.5 Mr. E. came out. Smoking a cigar. Turned off hose on
lawn. Went to back of house and got a rake. Worked on flower
beds.</p>

<p>10.42 Butcher called. Mr. E. spoke to him over gate and
butcher went away.</p>

<p>10.45 Mr. E. went in.</p>

<p>10.48 Heard front door click. Mr. E. came out with stick and
in different hat. Limped off slowly towards Glenelg.</p>

<p>12.10 Mr. E. returned. Went in back door.</p>

<p>2.31 Man-servant came out. Did a bit of gardening. Banked up
potatoes, smoking pipe all the time.</p>

<p>4.5 Man-servant went in.</p>

<p>7.6 Mr. E. came out. Put hose sprinkler on lawn and watered
flowers. Pulled up sunblinds.</p>

<p>7.18 Major Poole called. Sat with Mr. E. on verandah. They had
drinks from small table on verandah.</p>

<p>8.10 Major Poole left. Mr. E. walked with him to garden gate
and then returned to verandah. Sat smoking on verandah.</p>

<p>9.3 Mr. E. went in. Saw light go up at back of house.</p>

<p>9.47 Light went out.</p>

<p>10.22 Someone smoking on verandah."</p>

<p>The inspector paused and looked up at the detective. "These
are the first day's notes and the second and third days are much
the same, except that the butcher called at 12.17 on Wednesday
and Mr. Eadie didn't go out until the afternoon&mdash;at nine
minutes past three to be precise. I notice also that the
man-servant went out yesterday evening at 8.9 and returned at
8.53&mdash;the first and only mention you make of his leaving the
house. I won't read any more. I think I've got the impression I
want. Now, Jackson, what do you make of it yourself? What do you
think?"</p>

<p>But the detective hesitated and from the expression on his
face was seemingly disinclined to commit himself. Before he was
ready with his reply, however, the inspector leant over the table
towards him and tapped him lightly on the arm.</p>

<p>"Look here, Jackson," he said impressively. "I don't wonder
you hesitate. I guess what your thoughts are, and I believe they
are the same as mine. Either we are tackling two very quiet and
inoffensive men, or else," and here the inspector leant forward
nearer still and dropped his voice almost to a whisper, "or else
we are dealing with a great artist&mdash;a very prince of crime.
I know what you think. You have asked yourself as I ask myself
now&mdash;Are there two men in that house or&mdash;is there only
one?"</p>

<p>There was a tense, deep silence and the inspector went on very
slowly. "You have watched there now for seventy-six hours. In
your notes I read fifty-one entries about these two
men&mdash;fifty-one separate entries and yet not once&mdash;never
once do you record having seen them both together at the same
time. Could it be chance, do you think? Could it be chance that
these men are always away from each other? It might easily happen
for a few hours or even perhaps at a stretch, for a whole day.
But for three days&mdash;for seventy-two hours, with them both in
such a small house, surely it is impossible. Of course, perhaps
it strikes me more than it does you, because in reading down your
notes I can take in the happenings of all one day in a single
glance of the eye. I am not confused as you may have been by the
waiting periods in between."</p>

<p>The detective nodded his head. "I believe, Inspector, it's as
you say," he replied gravely, "but the idea came to me first in
quite a different way. It never for a moment crossed my mind
until I happened to notice suddenly on the second day that both
men looked up from their work&mdash;as they were doing the garden
I mean&mdash;in exactly the same way when anyone went by down the
road. They both jerked their heads up sideways in a peculiar sort
of way. I pointed it out to Frognal and after that we watched for
it."</p>

<p>"But look now how everything fits in. It seems as clear as day
to me, sitting here."</p>

<p>"That's what I said to Frognal. Servant goes in&mdash;master
comes out. Master goes in&mdash;servant comes out. It quite
amused us after a little while&mdash;long before we thought there
was anything fishy about it. We joked to ourselves and said they
were taking it in turns to mind the baby."</p>

<p>The inspector was thinking hard again. "We can't be making a
mistake," he said after a short pause. "The trick is so simple
and yet so very clever." He turned back to the detective's notes.
"You see, Eadie never goes out until the tradesmen have been. Of
course he doesn't want them to notice that the house is locked
up. He knows the different hours and days they come and lays his
plans accordingly. He always leaves by the front door&mdash;I
notice once you mention hearing it clicked to&mdash;and comes in
by the back. Now what does it mean?"</p>

<p>"Something fishy," replied the detective; "he's in hiding
there, for sure, and his game's quite easy to understand. One
person living all alone would perhaps make people inquisitive,
but two persons," he shrugged his shoulders. "Well, no one would
give them a thought."</p>

<p>"By Jove," exclaimed the inspector, "if we're right, how that
beggar took me in. The servant looked respectability itself. I
would have gone bail for him as being only just what he appeared
to be. No wonder, too, he used exactly the same words as his
master." He shook his head. "But still, I'm not satisfied yet.
You must go back, both of you, and watch again. A third man must
go with you and when either Eadie or his servant leave the house
one of you must go and make sure that it is empty. If it's empty
we shall be certain of the trick." He paused for a moment and
then went on slowly. "I should like to see his finger-prints too.
If there's only one man, and he's playing this game, he's in
hiding, as you say. For sure he's wanted in some other State. He
wouldn't be just an ordinary criminal. He'd be an old hand up to
all the game. I tell you, Jackson, I don't like it. We may now be
hot on some important scent, but, if we are, we never, never
needed more care. The slightest hint, the faintest idea that we
are watching, and he'll trail off or at best if he's in anyway
implicated, destroy all trace of the McIver affair. Now go off
again and report the instant you have anything to tell. Meantime
I'll get the warrant ready. In any case, 'phone to me directly it
gets dark and you can slip away from the garage without the
chance of being seen."</p>

<p>For a long while after the detective had gone away Inspector
Romilly remained alone and wrapped in his own thoughts. He was an
ambitious man and just now was very worried over his want of
success in tracking down the assassin of McIver. It was the first
big case that had ever been entrusted entirely to him alone, and
he was beginning to think he would never have got it at all had
there been any reasonable chance of discovering the murderer.</p>

<p>A well-educated man, he had entered the police force of South
Australia at a much later period of life than the ordinary
constable. He was an only child and his father had been a captain
in the P. &amp; O. line of steamers, but dying before Mark
Romilly was twenty the latter had early been thrown upon his own
resources. Always with a great love of adventure, he had drifted
from one thing to another without for a time lighting upon any
settled career or occupation.</p>

<p>Things had not gone very well with him, however, and finally,
tired of continually knocking about, he had, almost in
desperation, so it seemed, become a policeman.</p>

<p>It was not an occupation his few friends would have ever
thought fitted to him, for it necessarily entailed a strict
subservience to discipline. They prophesied very early trouble
and gave him three months at most before his bold and adventurous
spirit would get him turned loose upon the world again.</p>

<p>But no&mdash;young Romilly had pulled himself together, and in
a few months there was no smarter nor more efficient policeman in
the force. Strange to say, he suddenly became ambitious too, and
religiously set himself to acquire whatever knowledge he thought
might be useful to him in his new career.</p>

<p>A man of imagination he became an ardent student of
criminology, and there were few important crimes with the history
of which he had no acquaintanceship. When occasion arose his
suggestions were often received with favour at headquarters.</p>

<p>At first promotion had come rapidly in a way and seven years
from joining the force he had become an inspector. Then the great
war had intervened and for four years he had been absent from the
Commonwealth. In the A.I.F. he had risen to the rank of major. He
had been twice mentioned in despatches and had been decorated
with the D.S.O. With the war over, he returned to his old
position in the Adelaide Police, but found, as so many others had
found, that however meritorious were his war services, the years
he had been absent had rather put up a barrier to higher
things.</p>

<p>Men who had been once below him and had stayed behind had
passed him on the ladder of success, and there was no gainsaying
but that his absence from Australia had detracted not a little
from the prospect of further promotion.</p>

<p>Thus it was with him at the time of the McIver murder.</p>

<p>The case had fallen to him at first because of the absence of
a higher official from the city, and then upon that officer's
return, because, as was generally believed, it was not a case
that seemed likely to bring much kudos to its unfortunate
possessor.</p>

<p>The inspector was very worried and he was frowning hard. He
must be careful, very careful, he knew. If he once arrested the
tenant of the white house and found it to be only a ghastly
mistake, the consequences might indeed be serious for him, for
there was nothing that so detracted from reputation as
ridicule.</p>

<p>His meditations were interrupted by the entrance of a
constable. The man saluted. "Letter for you, sir," he said, as he
placed a bulky-looking envelope on the table. "Just this moment
come."</p>

<p>The inspector was not pleased to be interrupted and for some
minutes allowed the letter to remain where it was whilst he
endeavoured to pick up his broken train of thoughts.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he sighed at last, "we can only wait and see."
He picked up the letter and at once noticed the Sydney postmark.
"Who the devil's writing to me from Sydney," he muttered, "and
marking the envelope 'private' too?"</p>

<p>Opening the letter he found its contents to consist of four
pages of closely written matter. It was simply headed Sydney and
was dated three days previously. The writing was quite unknown to
him and curiously he turned to the end of the letter for the
signature. It was signed "Shell-shock."</p>

<p>Very puzzled he turned back to the first page and read as
follows:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Sydney.<br>
Monday afternoon.</p>

<p class="letter">To <span class="smcap">Inspector Romilly</span> of the City of Adelaide Police,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">Although this letter is not signed, please, for
your own sake, read it very carefully through. I see by the
newspapers that you have charge of the murder case at Glenelg and
what I am going to tell you may, or may not, be of great help to
you. When you have read all I write you will understand why I do
not sign my name. But I tell you frankly now, at the very
beginning, that I am not supposed to be quite right in my
mind.</p>

<p class="letter">I fought with the Australians in France in the
Great War and was blown up by a shell when in a trench before
Amiens in August, 1918. I was seven months in hospital in England
suffering from shock and then three months later arrived back
here in Sydney, where I was born. I have never wholly recovered
from the injury I received in France and sometimes my memory
completely goes.</p>

<p class="letter">Just a year ago this month I was in your city
on a holiday and met with a dreadful accident there. Very late
one night, a Saturday I think, I was picked up unconscious in the
street, somewhere near the railway station on North Terrace. It
was never found out how it happened, but they told me I must have
been knocked down by a motor-car in the dark. I always believed
there was something more than that in it, for all my pockets were
found empty when I was picked up. However, I had got concussion
of the brain, and fever, and they took me to the Adelaide
Hospital. It was weeks before I remembered who I was; then when I
got better my friends came for me, and took me away. I had a
dreadful time in the hospital and was always having dreams. At
least I am told now they were dreams. My friends always say they
were dreams, and I am forbidden to talk about them at home.
People think I am not strong in my mind because of the result of
the accident in Adelaide, following upon my injury in France. I
overheard the doctor telling my mother one day that I must always
be kept very, very quiet for my mind was on the borderland. He
said I should always be subject to hallucinations and very little
would drive me altogether out of my mind. But I am not such a
fool as they imagine, and I often think that what I am supposed
only to have dreamt&mdash;is actually all true and did happen in
reality. I particularly thought so this morning when I was
reading in the newspaper about that poor old man being strangled
at Glenelg. There was a photograph of his house in the paper and
the sandhills near it reminded me of the sandhills of my dream. I
hate the very look of sand now. Well, this is what they tell me
was only all a dream.</p>

<p class="letter">When I was in Adelaide just a year ago, one
evening I remember being on road between some sandhills and it
had just got dark. I saw two men coming and for some reason, why,
I can't think now, I hid in a bush. They were looking for me, it
seemed, but in a little while they walked away. I followed them
and they went into a very lonely house, deep in the hollow of two
sandhills, just by the sea. I tried to find out what they were
doing, but they caught me looking through the shutters and
dragged me into the house. There were four of them there in a
very long room. They asked me a lot of questions, and I thought
they were judging me. I believe they condemned me to death,
because they thought I had discovered something. At any rate they
shut me up in a little out-house until they decided what they
should do. I got frightened (I hadn't been a bit frightened
before) and broke down the door with an axe that I found on a
heap of wood in the shed. Then I tried to run away. I don't
remember well anything that happened after that. I heard a lot of
shouting and bangs and I quite thought someone had shot me.</p>

<p class="letter">At any rate they threw my body in the sea for I
remember coming to when the water touched me. I believe I floated
a long way, for hours I think, for I remember very late at night
coming to a pier. I got out of the water there but couldn't find
anyone to help me, for all the houses were dark and every place
was shut. I know I started to walk back to the city but my
clothes felt heavy and there&mdash;my dream ends.</p>

<p class="letter">If it were a dream it's very strange to me how
clear some things are. I remember so very distinctly the house.
It was a long low bungalow affair with a good piece of lawn
between it and the sea. There was a fence at the end of the lawn.
I remember, too, the room where they talked to me. It was a very
long room with two windows to it, and all the men sat at a long
table. I can't think what any of the men were like except one.
This one, however, I remember very distinctly and his face even
now often breaks into my dreams. He was the leader I think and he
wanted me to die. He had a cruel white face. His lips shut very
close together and he never moved his eyes from me the whole
time. He was fat, I think, and reminded me all the time of
someone I used to know. I couldn't think of who it was for a long
time, but I remembered suddenly one night when I was lying awake
in the hospital in Adelaide. He was exactly like Lord Dulling's
butler in England. When I was getting well there, I was sent to
his great country house that he had turned into a convalescent
home for soldiers and this butler used to bring our letters to us
on a silver tray in the mornings. He was the living image of the
man in the bungalow. He spoke very quietly in a soft low voice. I
sometimes remember his name. It was a very peculiar one. I think
they called him 'the Shooter,' or something like that. Of the
other men one was called Phil. Before they caught me I heard them
speaking of one of their friends. He was in prison, I think, for
seven years and someone spoke of him as 'poor old Rook.' The man
they called 'the Shooter' asked me some funny questions, and one
in particular I remember well. He asked me the names of the
arteries of the neck. He was such a horrible man, the white-faced
one. Calm and collected and as polite as if he were answering the
door, but his face was cruel as Death and I felt there was no
evil he would not do.</p>

<p class="letter">I told them all about it at the hospital but
they only smoothed my forehead and gave me something to drink. No
one here will let me speak about it now; my mother cries if I
ever mention it. But I often brood over it and wonder if I am
going mad. Sometimes when I am quite alone and there is no one in
the house I creep into the library and take down a map of
Australia. My eyes turn always to that little corner of St.
Vincent Gulf just where the Outer Harbour of South Australia
lies. My finger traces shakily to where about I know the bungalow
must lie and I close my eyes to think. All comes up plain to me
again. I see the long dark sands, the lonely building in the
hollow of those hills, the winding path that leads to the
verandah door. I see the long low room, the table where the
wretches sat, and the evil face of him who was my judge. I see
them whispering together when I am in the shed, I hear a sound of
crashing wood. They start with eyes that glare out angrily in
their surprise&mdash;they rush to the door&mdash;there is a sound
of shooting and someone falls. Mercy&mdash;oh mercy, they have
thrown my body to the sea.</p>

<p class="letter">Oh, do you wonder that they think I'm growing
mad? That horrible white face is always there to haunt me still.
My hand is shaking even now as I write.</p>

<p class="letter">There is only one way of peace for me, I shall
never rest securely until I know the wretch is hanged. I shall
read the papers every day to see if you have caught him, for
instinct tells me that your murderer is also mine. Could it be
possible that one little strip of coast near Adelaide could hide
two such wicked men? But I can't write any more.</p>

<p class="letter">If you ever pray&mdash;pray for me, for I
believe my mind is breaking.</p>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Shell-Shock</span>."</p>


<p><br>
The inspector's face was white and clammy when he had finished. It seemed he could hardly get his breath.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, good Lord," he ejaculated hoarsely, "but what a
find! Looked like a butler did he? Oh, what a fool I've been.
This almost clinches everything if it's only true&mdash;and it
reads like truth in every line. But we'll soon see."</p>

<p>He rang his bell sharply.</p>

<p>"Hutchinson," he said to the constable who at once appeared,
"look in the record book for a Saturday evening, about this time
last year, when a man was picked up unconscious near North
Terrace Station and taken direct to the hospital.</p>

<p>"Now be quick, please, and bring the book here when you've
found it."</p>

<p>In three minutes the man was back in the room. He handed a
book to the inspector. "Here it is, sir, 2.15 a.m., Sunday,
January 13th. Report of P.C. Lodge. Unknown man found unconscious
in road near Newmarket Hotel. Passing lorry requisitioned and man
taken to Adelaide Hospital, Received there 2.29."</p>

<p>"Good," said the inspector briskly. "Now get me an ordnance
map, please, and a table of the tides for last year. Find one of
the men too who knows the district of Port Adelaide. I shall want
three plain-clothes men at once."</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was poring intently over a large scale map
of the whole coast-line from Glenelg to the Outer Harbour.</p>

<p>"Now, Lambert," he said to a young policeman who was standing
beside him. "Pull your wits together and try to help me. I'm told
you're a Semaphore man and know all the coast. Well, I want to
find a particular bungalow somewhere between two sandhills and
just on the sea. It's by itself in a lonely position and, I
think, not far off the Military Road. It's a long low bungalow,
and has a stretch of lawn running between it and the sands."</p>

<p>"Is it inhabited, sir?" asked the policeman.</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass now," retorted the inspector irritably. "What
does it matter if the bungalow's inhabited or not, if you know
where it is."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied the young policeman meekly, "I know of
several bungalows that answer to the description you mention, but
I thought it might save time if you could tell me anything
more."</p>

<p>"I know no more than what I have already told you. A man was
assaulted there some time ago and thrown in the sea, about high
tide. He drifted away, he says, for a long time to some pier and
then he walked into the city. From the direction of the tide then
flowing he must have been drifting south, and therefore I take it
he was thrown in this side of Semaphore."</p>

<p>The policeman thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"I think I know the place you want, sir," he said slowly. "At
any rate, there are several lonely bungalows there."</p>

<p>Less than an hour later a little party of four men might have
been observed stolidly tramping along the sands about two miles
distant from the town of Semaphore.</p>

<p>The inspector had lost no time, but had promptly motored down.
He had, however, deemed it best to leave the car upon a quiet
road behind the sandhills and begin his search by the margin of
the sea itself. In that way he argued that he could not possibly
miss any bungalow with a stretch of lawn running down before it
to the sea.</p>

<p>For a long while their search was crowned with no success, and
then suddenly they came upon the very bungalow they wanted.</p>

<p>They were just passing two large sandhills much higher than
the rest when deep in the hollow between them, they espied a long
but narrow strip of well-kept lawn. At the shore end of the lawn
was a low bungalow, painted a dark red.</p>

<p>The inspector felt his heart beats quicken.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he exclaimed exultingly; "the very bungalow and
someone's living in it too." Then he muttered to himself: "The
poor chap, I thought his letter rang true. But what a place to be
in at night. I don't wonder the memory of it haunts him now."</p>

<p>Cautiously they made towards the bungalow, but the inspector
felt his hopes chill suddenly by the appearance of three small
children upon the verandah. They were carrying little buckets and
spades and were evidently going down upon the sands to play.</p>

<p>Seeing the strangers, however, they stopped at once and the
eldest of them called out to someone inside the house. A
pleasant-looking, rosy-faced woman came out. "Good morning," said
the inspector, choking back his disappointment with an effort.
"May I ask if you live here?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," smiled the woman in answer, "this is our house. Can
I do anything for you?"</p>

<p>"Well," went on the inspector glibly, "I was looking for a
friend of mine. A Mr. Chambers&mdash;I thought he lived
here."</p>

<p>The woman shook her head. "No, you've come to the wrong
house." Then she added thoughtfully, "And I don't know any Mr.
Chambers at all about here. Is it a long time since you saw
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, about a year."</p>

<p>"Oh well, I'm afraid I can't help you then. We've not been
here a year ourselves yet. We came here ourselves only last
March. It must have been before we arrived."</p>

<p>The inspector's spirits rose again. "I expect that was it," he
replied. "I suppose you don't happen to know who was here before,
do you?"</p>

<p>"A Mr. Powell, I think, but I never saw him. We moved in the
day after he left&mdash;on the fifth of last March."</p>

<p>"You don't know where he went to?"</p>

<p>"No, we never heard about him after he left."</p>

<p>"Did he live here long?"</p>

<p>"No, he had only taken the place for six months."</p>

<p>"You never heard where he came from, I expect?"</p>

<p>The woman smiled amiably at so many questions.</p>

<p>"Well, we never heard," she replied, "but I think he must have
come from Sydney. He left such heaps of newspapers behind and
they all came from Sydney. The cupboards were full of them."</p>

<p>The inspector at once thought it best to speak openly.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said with the nicest smile that he could
muster. "I think you can help me. I'll be frank with you. I'm a
police officer and we're making inquiries about the people who
lived here a year ago. Is there anything you think you can tell
me?"</p>

<p>The woman's eyes opened in surprise. "I'd tell you anything I
could," she answered, "but I really know nothing at all about
them. They say there were three or four men living here, but no
one seems to have seen much of them. Mortlake and Brown are the
agents at Semaphore and perhaps they could tell you."</p>

<p>The inspector thanked her. "Well, if you don't mind, before I
go I'd like to have a look in that shed there. I want to see what
it's been used for."</p>

<p>The woman gave her permission at once and the men walked over
to the shed. The door was open, but the inspector noticed
immediately there was a good stout lock on it.</p>

<p>"Now for critical moment number two," he thought to himself;
"my esteemed correspondent distinctly mentioned that he broke
down the door with an axe."</p>

<p>The shed had evidently been recently painted and outside at
any rate there was no sign of any damage or repair.</p>

<p>Anxiously he pulled the door open to the light, and his face
relaxed instantly into a smile. Yes, undoubtedly the door had
been repaired. Two panels on one side were of quite different
wood from the rest, and the lock itself was not the first one
that had been fixed; he could tell that by the position of the
screws. He looked round the shed. It was quite a fair sized one
and evidently had originally been intended for a car. Now,
however, it was only being used for wood and there were chips all
about the place.</p>

<p>A thrill of satisfaction ran through him. There could be no
doubt now, he thought, but that the letter from Sydney was
genuine and in some respects at all events the happenings
mentioned in it were not imagined. It was, at any rate, a
promising trail for him to proceed along.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch and then turned to his companions. "I'm
sorry there's going to be no scrap for you," he said laughingly,
"but you may get one later. We're on the track right enough. Now
back to the car the quickest way we can and we'll interview the
agents."</p>

<p>But the agents unhappily knew nothing. The Mr. Powell, the
former tenant of the bungalow, had given no references. He had
paid his six months' money in advance. They knew nothing about
him, and had no recollection either of what he was like.</p>

<p>Returning to the city. Inspector Romilly proceeded at once to
send off an urgent telegram to Sydney. He had a personal friend
there in the Head Detective Office, the great Gilbert Larose, and
knew that by wiring to him personally he would get all possible
information at the earliest moment. The wire he sent read:</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">LAROSE POLICE SYDNEY.</p>

<p class="telegram">
URGENT REQUIRE INFORMATION IF ANYONE CALLED ROOK NOW
DOING SEVEN YEARS. INTERESTED ALSO CONVICT'S FORMER
ASSOCIATES. CAN YOU TELL ME?</p>

<p class="telegram">ROMILLY, ADELAIDE.</p>

<p><br>
He handed in the telegram himself, and, leaving the post office,
turned down King William Street to buy some cigarettes. A short
distance upon his way a small boy, evidently noticing his
uniform, stopped him timidly to ask about an address. The little
chap held up a very grubby piece of paper for his inspection.</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly at once gave the boy the information he was
requiring and always fond of children, gave it very nicely with a
pleasant smile. Most people, if they had happened to notice them
talking, would have remarked to themselves how very gentle the
stern face of the inspector could be.</p>

<p>At any rate Miss Maude McIver did so.</p>

<p>She was walking slowly up the street and saw the inspector
with the boy. She recognised him instantly and her first thought
again was that he was certainly very good-looking. She liked too
the kindly way in which he was regarding his little
interrogator.</p>

<p>Just as she drew level the little boy moved off and, the
inspector looking up, Miss McIver caught his eye. The smile
instantly left his face and gravely saluting her he made to pass
on.</p>

<p>For some reason the girl felt piqued, and turning she smiled
and asked him if he had any news.</p>

<p>"But perhaps I oughtn't to ask you," she added a trifle
archly. "You may be afraid I shall talk."</p>

<p>He quite ignored her suggestion.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied slowly, "I certainly have some news but I
hardly know yet exactly where we are. But anyhow I'm glad I met
you because I want to speak to you again. I was going to ring you
up to know when I could call."</p>

<p>"Oh, almost any time," said the girl, again as cold and
indifferent as ever. "I'm in almost any afternoon."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll come to-day at half past four if I may." The girl
just inclined her head and with a little bow moved away.</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly walked on to get his cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Beautiful face," he said to himself musingly, "and very
pretty mouth too. I'd never give a bean for a girl without pretty
lips. She's a little bit aloof though and pretends she's cold.
Bah! she'll be as sweet as they make 'em when she falls in love.
I know her kind, bless her heart."</p>

<p>He bought his cigarettes and started to walk back to Victoria
Square. No doubt he should have been thinking hard of all the
happenings of that morning, but, strange to say, it was still
Maude McIver who occupied his thoughts.</p>

<p>Punctually at half past four that afternoon he appeared at
Clyde House and, as before, was shown into the drawing-room. This
time, however, Maude McIver was there alone.</p>

<p>She asked the inspector to sit down.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss McIver," said the latter briskly, but smiling a
little, "when I feel sure of a person, I believe in coming at
once straight to the point, so here goes." His smile faded away
and he looked very stern. He went on. "You asked me when I was
here a few days ago if I suspected anyone and I told you, no.
Well, things have moved since then and I do suspect someone now."
He paused for a second and looked the girl straight in the face
to mark the effect of what he was going to say. Then he spoke
slowly and deliberately with a grim challenge in his tone. "I
suspect Mr. Eadie over there," he said; "I believe he's a
criminal. I believe he came into this house that night and
strangled your poor uncle."</p>

<p>His voice sounded harsh and brutal, but he had made it so on
purpose, in order to prevent the girl, knowing nothing as she
did, from at once insisting blindly upon the innocence of her
uncle's friend. He wished to break down her incredulity at the
beginning. The girl's face went ghastly white, but she took the
blow pluckily as indeed he had thought she would.</p>

<p>"It's too awful for me to believe;" she said faintly, "but
you've found out something?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered gravely, "I've found out a lot, but in
telling you it as I am now I am placing my whole reputation in
your hands. No one knows of it yet but you and me, not even my
superior officers in Adelaide. If you let me down," and here he
shrugged his shoulders and his pleasant smile came back again,
"you will be blighting a promising career."</p>

<p>But the girl could not smile back; she was too numbed yet to
have any feeling but one of horror in her mind.</p>

<p>The inspector became business-like again.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss McIver, I'm perhaps going to startle you again. You
can easily tell me, can't you, the exact date when Mr. Eadie
became a tenant at the White House, last year?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have it in my uncle's diary in the desk here." She
moved across the room to get it and began shakily to turn over
the leaves, but the inspector interrupted.</p>

<p>"One moment, please. Before you say anything&mdash;if there's
any truth in what I have just told you about Mr. Eadie&mdash;he
arrived here on March the 4th."</p>

<p>There was a minute's silence until she found the page. "Yes,"
she said quietly, "it was March the 4th, on a Thursday."</p>

<p>"Exactly," snapped Inspector Romilly in triumph. "On March the
4th he moved here from a bungalow near Semaphore. He was 'Mr.
Powell' there and by all my life's experience he'd had a dozen
names before that." Again his voice became very grave. "Miss
McIver, that man Eadie is no ordinary man. He's an adept in
crime. By what unhappy chance he came to this neighbourhood I
don't know yet, but long before he came here he was a breaker of
the law. When we learn everything, and we shall know all soon
now, I tell you we shall surely find a dreadful record of evil
behind his name."</p>

<p>For the first time the girl looked almost as if she were going
to cry, and the inspector, touched by her distress, dropped his
voice to the gentlest tones he could.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry to put you through all this," he said, "but
you're the only one who can give me exactly the help I want. I'll
tell you what we also believe we've found out. You'll be
interested now without any further shocks." He paused for a
moment and then went on quietly. "Do you know, Miss McIver, that
there are no such people as Mr. Eadie and his servant in that
white house over there."</p>

<p>The girl forced back her tears in her surprise. "What do you
mean?" she asked wonderingly; "you spring such dreadful things on
me that I don't profess to understand."</p>

<p>"Well, it's quite simple this time at any rate. There's only
one person living there and he takes it in turn to be the master
and the man. Accordingly, as he wishes it&mdash;the servant
Martin disguises himself as Mr. Eadie, or Mr. Eadie becomes the
servant man." He smiled at the girl's look of sheer amazement and
went on. "Come now, think. All the months they have been living
here, Mr. Eadie and his man, have you ever yet seen the two of
them together? Have you ever seen them both side by side? Please,
don't you say you have," he continued laughing, "or you will
spoil one of the prettiest little plots I could ever have
imagined."</p>

<p>The girl looked very puzzled and for a long time bit hard on
her lip in her surprise. Then her face broke into a pretty smile,
the colour came back into her cheeks, and she laughed in a
frankly pleasant sort of way.</p>

<p>"Really, you seem quite a wizard, Mr. Inspector," she said
smilingly at length, "for I do believe you're right. No, I don't
think I have seen them both together, and, what's more, now you
mention it, I can remember several little things that help to
bear out what you say. Oh, how very funny. I can't help being
amused. After all the horrible things you first told me I'm sure
I never thought I should be able to smile so soon again."</p>

<p>"Well, what are these little things you noticed?" asked the
inspector, greatly admiring the sweet, animated face before him,
but still intent on the matter in hand.</p>

<p>"Well, the man-servant's been up here several times with
messages. He always comes up here with the rent on the first of
the month, and both Mrs. Carter and myself have more than once
remarked that both master and man must both smoke the same kind
of tobacco. They were heavy smokers we knew, but when either of
them came into the hall there was always the same kind of tobacco
smell. As I say, we often noticed it and thought it strange,
because Mr. Eadie always smoked cigars and his man never anything
but a pipe. I don't think I have ever seen the servant without a
pipe in his mouth when I have been passing their garden and he
was working there."</p>

<p>"Excellent, and what else have you noticed?"</p>

<p>"They both have the same trick of inclining their heads ever
so little when you ask them to do anything. We thought Martin
must have caught the habit from his master. Only on Sunday I saw
Mr. Eadie passing the gate and asked him to post a letter for me.
I noticed then that he moved his head exactly as Martin had done
last week when I gave him the receipt for the rent, and asked him
to give it to his master. But, oh, Inspector Romilly, what a
difference in their teeth. They can't really be the same."</p>

<p>"False," sniffed the inspector, "the easiest thing in the
world to see through, when you're looking for it."</p>

<p>"But tell me, please, what first put the idea in your
mind?"</p>

<p>The inspector took some papers from his pocket and drawing his
chair a little nearer to the girl, handed over one of them to her
to read.</p>

<p>"You shall know all we have found out," he said gravely, "and
you will have no doubt then as to what is really true."</p>

<p>For more than an hour they remained talking, and when the
inspector finally got up to go the girl thanked him prettily for
his confidence in her.</p>

<p>"I quite appreciate your trust," she said, "and I'm sure it's
very nice of you to be so open with me."</p>

<p>"Well," he replied smiling, "I had to tell you everything or
nothing. I daren't just tell you a little or you wouldn't have
understood the graveness of things and by a chance word you might
have put the villain on his guard. A criminal of his type
generally calculates for everything, and if he gets the faintest
inkling that we're watching him he'll disappear at once. I've no
doubt he's got some other hiding-place already in his mind."</p>

<p>The inspector left Clyde House in quite a happy frame of mind,
and as he made his way towards the railway station of Glenelg,
his thoughts were undeniably pleasant ones, for again they
lingered on the pretty girl he had just left.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, his meditations were cut short. A bluff,
hearty voice broke in from behind.</p>

<p>"Hi, you there, Romilly," someone shouted, "pull in the reins
a bit, will you. I want you."</p>

<p>He looked up sharply. He was just passing Major Poole's
pretentious residence in the High Road, and the owner of the
house himself was hurrying down the lawn to catch him.</p>

<p>"Cheerio, Inspector. Your luck's in, old man," exclaimed the
jolly-looking major when he got up close. "Now, do you know
what's going to happen to you&mdash;yes, straight-away?"</p>

<p>The inspector looked at his watch. "I'm going to catch the
6.15 to the city," he replied, "but before that I believe some
wicked old wine-bibber is going to ask me to have a drink."</p>

<p>"Better than that," laughed the major, "better than that, my
boy. You're going to have the nicest little bit of dinner that
you've had for years. Look here, old man. I've got a little feed
on to-night, something special. There should have been seven of
us, all men, but one of them's put off, a chap you don't know.
Now I can't have a vacant chair and it'll be the kindest thing in
the world if you come in. Now, don't say no for I won't have it.
Be a sport; you needn't stay late for one of the men has got to
leave sharp at nine and I'm motoring him myself into the city;
you shall go with him. So there you are, everything's all cut and
dried."</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly looked down at his uniform. "But I can't
come in like this," he smiled. "It would frighten them all to
have a policeman in full kit, besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the major interrupted. "Oh, chuck it, old man. It won't
matter a bit. They all know you personally or by reputation, and
they'll be awfully pleased to have you with them. Come on; I
won't take no. We're just going to sit down."</p>

<p>The inspector hesitated. He liked company and he liked a good
dinner. Major Poole and he were old friends and had been brother
officers together in France. He was not shy of meeting anyone,
although now he was again only a policeman. He had mixed with
some of the best people in his campaigning days, and was quite
aware he could hold his own with anyone. Why shouldn't he enjoy
himself, he thought? Besides, he was hungry. He followed the
major in.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was being introduced to the company. Three
of them he already knew.</p>

<p>"Major Romilly," said his host to the other two. "Major
Romilly, Distinguished Service Order, late of the Second
Division, now the best-looking Inspector of Police in the State
of South Australia."</p>

<p>Everyone laughed, and the major went on in a loud stage
whisper.</p>

<p>"Almost had to put the dinner off. My parlour-maid skedaddled
in a temper this morning, and there was no one to wait on us.
Didn't know what to do, but Eadie very decently lent me his
butler and everything will be O.K. now. Nice man, Eadie, real
good sort."</p>

<p>The inspector nearly had a fit.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; PLAYING WITH FIRE</h2>

<p class="first">INSPECTOR ROMILLY thoroughly enjoyed himself
that evening and later on, when he was much better off and in a
position to give dinner parties himself, he often tried to
reproduce something of the spirit that so pervaded things
there.</p>

<p>All things harmonised so beautifully together. He was tired
and he was hungry, and he sank thankfully into the happiness of
it all.</p>

<p>Ease and wealth were so apparent everywhere.</p>

<p>There was the comfortable long room; the deeply cushioned
chairs and the softly shaded lights. There was the smell of
daintily cooked foods and the delicate aroma of fine old
wines.</p>

<p>There was the hum of happy voices, the laughter of contented
men at peace with all the world, and a gentle languorous feeling
that life was very pleasant after all.</p>

<p>Then there was Martin too. Martin, the ubiquitous, soft-soled
butler of the "nice chap, Mr. Eadie." Martin, who was always
there when he was wanted, but who was never in the way, who moved
phantom-like over the rich thick carpet without a sound, who
seemed just to glide in with the dishes and who was always handy
when the wine glass was getting low, who was never behind-hand
with anything and yet who was never hasty to insinuate a fresh
delicacy before the old one was completely gone.</p>

<p>Yes, he was a prince of waiters was Martin, and a very king in
kindly thought and in knowing exactly what to do.</p>

<p>The inspector felt quite happy and even crime, he thought, had
its amusing side.</p>

<p>Here was he, he told himself, dining with five just men and
being waited upon by a sixth whom he believed to be amongst the
vilest of his kind. The man was serving him with food and drink
with the self-same hands that only a few days previously had
encompassed a black and dreadful crime. The man seemed quite
innocent and unconcerned about it, too, never dreaming of the
damning papers concerning him that lay snug within a few inches
of his fingers every time he poured the wine.</p>

<p>The inspector almost thought it was a dream.</p>

<p>"Well, Romilly," presently called out his genial host, "and
how are you getting on? Got everything you want?"</p>

<p>"Everything, thank you, Major, I'm feeling grand."</p>

<p>"Well, it was lucky we saw you going by," went on the major;
"I was just going to tell Martin to re-lay the table when Spooner
called out&mdash;'There goes that damned policeman, Romilly,' and
I at once ran and fetched you in."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Major," indignantly expostulated a stout
red-faced individual at the far end of the table. "I'm sure I never
said anything of the kind. What I did say, and I call everyone
here to bear witness to it, was 'Hullo, there goes our
good-looking Police Inspector D.S.O.'"</p>

<p>The major winked an eye to the company generally.
"Tut&mdash;tut, Spooner, what's the good of quibbling about the
exact form of words you used. You meant what I said anyhow, even
if you expressed it differently. I could see at once you intended
to be deliberately disrespectful to the force."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a true bill, Spooner," broke in Dr. Taylor, another
of the guests. "Even if you didn't say it, I could see then by
the very expression of your eye that you had an animus against
the inspector here, and I beg humbly to call his attention to the
number of your car. Six hundred and six it is, and you're always
exceeding the speed limit, and never carry lights under any
circumstances whatsoever. Inspector Romilly, kindly note it
down."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," agreed the latter joining in the fun. "Ill
see he loses a fiver the next time he drives out. We must uphold
the majesty of the law somehow."</p>

<p>"Oh, curse your majesty of the law," spluttered the rubicond
Spooner, with his mouth full of turkey and tongue; "a fig for all
the policemen in the State. I've given up the police long ago and
got a couple of boy scouts to guard our bank instead. We've had
no trouble since then."</p>

<p>"Good gracious, man," broke in Major Poole again. "You don't
surely say your bank is still carrying on? I heard it had to
suspend payment when your cook withdrew her account."</p>

<p>Everybody laughed, and Banker Spooner embarking upon a second
adventure in the turkey and tongue line, the conversation again
became general.</p>

<p>Presently, however, Major Poole, catching the inspector's eye,
asked him casually how the McIver case was getting on. "Not for a
moment that I want to pump you," he added quickly; "I was only
inquiring in just a general sort of way."</p>

<p>"It's quite all right," readily replied the inspector, without
any hesitation. "We're always pleased to supply information up to
a certain point. It often helps us a great deal."</p>

<p>Everyone stopped talking and the inspector could feel the
interest they were all taking. Martin, he noted, was going round
again with the champagne.</p>

<p>"Well," went on the major cheerfully, "have you any hopes at
all of catching him, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the inspector stoutly, "we shall catch
him one day right enough. It's only a question of time."</p>

<p>"But shall you catch him to-night, to-morrow or next week, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't say we shall catch him as soon as that. I don't
even say now we shall ever catch him for this particular crime,
but the law will have him one day for some other crime, and then
all about this one will come to light."</p>

<p>The major looked disappointed and pretended to sniff a
little.</p>

<p>"Yes, but Romilly old man," he replied half banteringly,
"that's not much good to us now, is it? It seems like admitting
failure on your part." He went on&mdash;"You see, the way I look
at it is this. Here was a pal and neighbour of ours killed in a
most ghastly manner, almost so to speak at our very door. You men
of the force were hot-foot on the scent and the public, I am sure
you will agree, helped you in every possible way. Now, after all
this time, however, all you can say to us is&mdash;'Oh,
yes&mdash;no&mdash;we haven't exactly caught him yet, but just
wait till the beggar strangles someone else again and then we'll
have him sure.'"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," continued the major in mock judicial tones, "I
don't think our friend the D.S.O. comes out very well in this.
The force wants gingering up a bit."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear," said Banker Spooner; "they're a poor lot."</p>

<p>"It's all very well for you fellows to laugh," pleaded the
inspector, half in fun and half in earnest, "but when a man
commits a crime he doesn't go and just write his name and address
everywhere so that we can look him up and give him a call. He
clears off and is not particularly anxious to be found. The major
here says we were hot-foot on the scent, but where in the world
had we any scent to follow? We had nothing at all to go on except
that the murderer jolly well knew the place. There were no other
clues whatever and we couldn't make them even to please Major
Poole here."</p>

<p>Martin was just putting on the dessert and was busy at the
sideboard with the nuts.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Major Poole, as if forgivingly after a
short pause, "I suppose we'll have to overlook it this time and
trust to better luck." Then he added slyly, as an afterthought:
"But I don't think you're quite such duffers as you make out.
You've not given up hope yet, I know. A little bird whispered to
me that you've got someone still on the look-out in Clyde
House."</p>

<p>The inspector felt himself go cold in horror. What on earth
was coming out now, and what in Heaven's name did Major Poole
know? The blundering idiot would ruin all his plans before things
were ready. What dreadful luck, too, that Martin was here. The
slightest thing and Martin might suspect a watch was being kept.
Then it would be all up and hardly an hour could pass before he
would trail away. Everything stood on a razor's edge now.</p>

<p>Martin himself broke through his thoughts. He was standing at
his elbow.</p>

<p>"Will you take port, sir?" and the hand that held the decanter
was steady as a rock. Mechanically he nodded, "Yes."</p>

<p>All these fears had come chasing through him in a second and
in a second also he had determined what he would do. Quick always
on the up-take, he knew that safety far oftenest lay in boldness
and that upon occasion even open frankness itself could hide
secrets when everything else had failed. He was indignant at
once.</p>

<p>"Please don't for one moment imagine," he expostulated warmly,
"that it's Miss McIver who's frightened, for it is not. Mrs.
Carter's a lady deep in novelette lore and she's been trained to
believe that murderers always return to gloat over their crimes.
That's why I've set a guard. It's not Miss McIver at all."</p>

<p>"Who said it was?" replied the major, rather taken aback with
the vehemence of the outburst. "I never mentioned her name, did
I?"</p>

<p>The inspector seemed embarrassed, but he stuck to his guns. "I
tell you Miss McIver has nothing to do with it. Nothing."</p>

<p>"Dear me, Romilly," broke in Spooner coarsely, "but I believe
you're in love. Maude's a devilish fine girl anyhow, and man, I,
for one, admire your taste."</p>

<p>The inspector was really angry this time and he glanced
fiercely at the interruptor, but their host came tactfully to the
rescue before any further remarks could pass.</p>

<p>"Now no names, please, Spooner, although I confess I'm sweet
in that direction myself," and he sighed deeply and audibly.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment and then everyone burst into
laughter together. The very idea of the fat, even
corpulent-looking major being in love with anybody at all seemed
irresistibly funny, and the laughter was loud and prolonged.</p>

<p>Martin alone was silent and unperturbed. He was just
impressively serving the coffee as if it were part of some great
and solemn ritual.</p>

<p>When the laughter had in part subsided it was the inspector
who spoke again.</p>

<p>"Look here, you fellows," he said confidingly, "I tell you
it's no good at all to blame the police. We've done all we can
and I don't mind admitting that in a way we're stumped. I'm not
telling you a secret either, for it's all public property by now.
You see the whole business was so peculiar. We had nothing to
help us except the certain knowledge that the murderer knew all
about the house. We are sure of that. The night after it happened
we reconstructed everything and, exactly at the same hour, I went
over the whole ground exactly as we knew the murderer must have
done. It proved conclusively that whoever came into the house
that night just walked into it as if it were his own, and that is
all we could find out about him." He shrugged his shoulders
despondently and went on. "But I don't say for one moment that we
have given up hopes of catching him. We have done, and are doing
still, lots of things that the public never find out. The major
here has just given you an instance of what was of course not
supposed to be generally known."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I only found it out quite accidentally, too,"
exclaimed the gratified major, now beaming delightedly all round.
"I happened to see McIver's chauffeur, young Iredale, upon two
consecutive days buying packets of cigarettes, and in joke I
warned him of the dangers of smoking too much. He said the
cigarettes were not for him and then, when I asked him if he were
buying them for his young lady, he looked very knowing and said
they might be for a visitor who was staying with them on the
quiet. Then I twigged it at once."</p>

<p>Martin was handing round the liqueurs. He was a little world
to himself, and he moved impersonally in his orbit round these
well-fed men. He had no thought but for their comfort and
content. He was of different blood from them.</p>

<p>The inspector was meeting his misfortunes bravely. His
thoughts came like lightning flashes and he prepared to mine the
fields of battle that he already saw ahead.</p>

<p>"Oh, by-the-bye," he remarked carelessly, directly the major
had finished speaking, "talking of that chauffeur, I hear he's
had an accident this evening. Knocked down by a taxi and hurt his
leg. Nothing much I understand, but he's had to go to hospital
all the same."</p>

<p>There was mild interest in this and then to the inspector's
great relief the conversation drifted to safer and less dangerous
themes.</p>

<p>At twenty minutes to nine exactly their host looked at his
watch.</p>

<p>"Time's up for two of you," he said, "for Romilly and Spooner
here. As I promised, I'm going to motor you into the city." He
turned to the other guests. "No, don't you other chaps go. I'll
be back in half an hour at latest and we'll have a rubber then.
Martin will look after you while I am away. Be good boys now and
don't let the doctor tell you any naughty tales. If he's got
anything good, he's to keep it until I return."</p>

<p>He went round to the garage to get the car out and for quite a
minute the inspector was left alone with Martin in the hall.</p>

<p>"Nice little dinner that, Martin," he remarked pleasantly, as
the latter brought him his hat and gloves. "Good cook here at any
rate," he went on, "and you're quite an artist yourself too in
your way."</p>

<p>Martin smiled a faint inscrutable smile and the inspector
slipped a half-crown into his hand. Did the man's hand shake, he
thought, and were his eyes lowered suddenly to mask some sinister
amusement that he felt? At any rate the inspector himself wanted
to laugh.</p>

<p>The major's car was a fast one and three minutes after leaving
the house they were passing through the main street of Glenelg.
Suddenly inspector Romilly who was sitting next to the major
called on him to stop. Very puzzled the latter jammed on the
brakes and pulled up the big car with a jerk.</p>

<p>"What is it, man, have you lost your hat?" he inquired with
just that touch of irritability that all good drivers feel when
an expensive and high-powered car is asked to stop abruptly on
its course.</p>

<p>"No, I've not lost anything," replied the inspector gravely,
"but I want you to do me a great favour now." He laid his hand
solemnly on the major's arm. "Look here, Major," he continued,
"when you and I were in France, we often had to do things for
which we didn't know why. Didn't we?"</p>

<p>"Certainly we did and damned unpleasant things they sometimes
were too, old man."</p>

<p>"And we hadn't to ask questions about them either, had
we?"</p>

<p>"Great Scott no, but what the devil are you driving at
now?"</p>

<p>"I'll speak quite plainly. I want you and Spooner to get out
right here at once and I want you to lend me the car for ten
minutes to myself. For ten minutes, not a minute more, and I'll
be back to you here again."</p>

<p>The major looked incredulously at his companion.</p>

<p>"What the devil&mdash;&mdash;" he began again, almost
explosively, but the inspector stopped him.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, don't let Spooner hear. He's half asleep, there.
I tell you, Major, the matter's urgent and yet I can't explain.
Come, be a good pal now and don't ask me any questions. You'll
know some day and you'll be delighted then that you've been
helping in a real little romance."</p>

<p>The major's expression changed instantly and, all smiles now,
he dug the inspector in the ribs.</p>

<p>"Oh, you gay dog," he whispered slily, "a woman! why didn't
you say so at once? Of course you can have the car, old man, and
I'll never breathe it to a soul, but help me out with Spooner
first," and greatly to the somnolent and well-fed Spooner's
disgust he was disinterred from the tonneau of the car and
bundled unceremoniously out on to the road.</p>

<p>In half a minute the car had turned down a side street and was
out of sight.</p>

<p>Giving wide berth to the hospitable mansion wherein he had so
happily dined, the inspector doubled quickly back in the
direction of Clyde House.</p>

<p>He knew quite well how the ground lay, and did not for one
moment miscalculate the chances of his hand now being forced
before he was quite ready.</p>

<p>The major in his blundering way had let everyone know that the
police were still interested in the surroundings of Clyde House,
and there was no exactly gauging how the Eadie-Martin combination
would take it. The inspector had parried the blow as best he
could, but here again he was quite in the dark as to whether he
had been successful or not.</p>

<p>Martin might take affright or he might complacently swallow
the explanation that had been suggested rather than actually
given. At any rate he would be certain to make some inquiries,
and the chauffeur, the inspector knew, was the weak spot.</p>

<p>The chauffeur must be got right out of the way then for a
time. He was a fool, and once in touch with the crafty tenant of
the White House there could be no doubt whatever as to the
result. Once questioned he would be incapable of hiding anything
and would be just turned inside out. Then the game would be all
up, for the instant Martin-Eadie or Eadie-Martin became aware
that the room over the garage was the place of watch&mdash;he
would guess rightly of course that the White House itself was the
centre of interest and observation.</p>

<p>It was with these thoughts racing through his mind that the
inspector had spoken at dinner, when upon the spur of the moment
he had given out that the chauffeur had met with an accident and
had been taken to hospital. It was in his mind then forthwith to
spirit young Iredale away.</p>

<p>The big car drew up before the gates of Clyde House and the
inspector jumping out was comforted not a little to find the
chauffeur standing just inside.</p>

<p>"Quick," he called out impatiently, "tell Mr. Jackson I want
him at once and you also have got to come. It's a very urgent
matter and you mustn't wait a minute."</p>

<p>Almost before the minute was up the car had turned round and
was off again but this time with the detective Jackson and the
chauffeur in the back seat.</p>

<p>The two police officers had hardly exchanged a word.</p>

<p>"All right, Jackson," the inspector had said curtly, "I'll
have a word with you in a minute, but get in now quick."</p>

<p>Less than a mile on their journey the inspector pulled the car
up. "You get out here, please," he said to his passengers, "and I
want you both to go straight to headquarters, but a word with you
first, Jackson."</p>

<p>The chauffeur took the hint and moved out of earshot a few
yards away from the car.</p>

<p>"Well, Jackson," said the inspector quickly, "he's away. House
empty, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Major Poole fetched him at half past four in his
car this afternoon. Five minutes later I was up at the house. No
one apparently in it, quiet as the grave. There was a light,
however, in the kitchen and it's burning there still, to make
out, I suppose, that there's someone inside."</p>

<p>"Good," whispered the inspector quietly. "Now bring that
chauffeur up to headquarters quickly. You'll catch the 9.15 if
you're sharp. He's been blabbing, the fool, and I want him out of
the way. I'll see you later. I shall be up there when you
come."</p>

<p>Off went the car again, but only a very little way this time
and it turned into the main road and pulled up where the major
and Spooner were standing.</p>

<p>The former was holding his watch out in his hand. "Only just
in time, Romilly," he said sternly, "one kiss more and you'd have
been late. Now you'll please drive us up for a punishment and
Spooner and I will have a nap behind."</p>

<p>The first thing that the inspector saw when he went into his
room at headquarters was a telegram waiting for him on the desk.
Eagerly he tore it open.</p>

<p>"ROMILLY POLICE ADELAIDE.</p>

<p>NOT EXACTLY BUT THINK KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN IF CORRECT ASSOCIATES
WANTED BADLY INTERNATIONAL CROOKS BEWARE SMITER LETTER FOLLOWS
IMMEDIATELY. LAROSE."</p>

<p>Much puzzled the inspector read over the telegram several
times.</p>

<p>"Now, what in the name of fortune does he mean?", he muttered.
"'Beware smiter.' Why on earth can't some people be more
explicit? For a few pence of economy, I've got to worry and
puzzle for two days over what he means."</p>

<p>But he had at any rate to put it out of his mind then, for
there were pressing matters awaiting his attention.</p>

<p>He rang up Clyde House and without giving his name asked to
speak to Miss McIver. When the girl came to the 'phone he
instantly enjoined her on no account to let anyone in the house
know who was speaking to her.</p>

<p>"Look here, Miss McIver," he went on hurriedly, "I've taken
young Iredale away for a couple of days. I'm very sorry but for
reasons I can't explain now, I want him away from Clyde House.
No, no, it's nothing at all to do with that. He's quite harmless.
It's only because he is such a fool, and can't hold his tongue.
No one must know, however, that I've got anything at all to do
with his disappearance. You understand&mdash;it would spoil
everything. Now listen, in five minutes the 'phone will ring
again. Don't answer it yourself. One of my men here will be
ringing up to say the chauffeur has been knocked down and has
hurt his leg. Stunned a bit, too. Nothing serious, but been
obliged to go to hospital. Please do without the car for two
days. Good night. I won't keep you any longer. Oh&mdash;by-the-bye,
it might interest you to know that I've been dining
unexpectedly to-night at Major Poole's. We had a charming little
dinner and were waited upon by Mr. Eadie's butler, Martin. He had
been lent specially for the occasion. I thought you would like to
know, but good night again," and he rang off.</p>

<p>Jackson and the chauffeur appeared just when he had finished
with the telephone.</p>

<p>The inspector eyed young Iredale very grimly.</p>

<p>"Well, young man," he said brusquely, "I told you you were an
ass once and I take this opportunity of telling you so again."
His voice became angry and menacing. "You've been talking, you
young fool. Talking, and you swore solemnly you'd say nothing to
a living soul."</p>

<p>The chauffeur looked very white.</p>

<p>"No, sir," he muttered uneasily, "I've never said anything.
I've spoken to no one at all."</p>

<p>"What about Major Poole," sneered the inspector, "when he saw
you at the tobacconist's buying those cigarettes?"</p>

<p>"Major Poole?" stammered the young man. "Oh I just said
something in fun, about having visitors in the house."</p>

<p>"Yes, and your damned fun, let me tell you, has just about
spoilt everything. Oh, you young fool. Well, you're going to
suffer for it now. You're either going to prison in the cells
right away, or you're going to consent to hide quietly where I'll
send you&mdash;until I think it safe to let you out again. Now do
you understand?"</p>

<p>"I'll do anything you wish," replied the now thoroughly
frightened chauffeur. "I'm sure I never meant any harm."</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't; fools never do. But come now, have you
spoken to anybody else? Have you seen Mr. Eadie or Martin for
instance?"</p>

<p>Jack Iredale seemed to hesitate and the inspector pressed him
sharply. "Come, out with it," he said, "don't be afraid. I want
to know the worst you've done."</p>

<p>"I've done nothing worse," answered the chauffeur, beginning
to think himself misjudged. "I just saw Mr. Eadie in Glenelg on
Tuesday and he said a few words."</p>

<p>"Well, what did he say?" snapped the inspector; "speak
out&mdash;quick, I want to know."</p>

<p>"He didn't say anything particular," grumbled Jack Iredale;
"he just asked if you had finished coming up to the house, and
when I said 'no' he said you were a fusser, that's all."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm a fusser am I? Well, now I'm going to fuss over you.
But you're quite sure, are you, that you told nothing to this Mr.
Eadie; you said nothing more?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, I'm sure. We only spoke for a few seconds as
I was standing by the car. Miss McIver was in the post office and
I was waiting."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Jackson's going to take you to his house and you're
not to move from there until I give the word. I've explained
everything to your mistress. Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur nodded rather sullenly and went out in the care
of the detective.</p>

<p>The inspector took up the telegram again and his face puckered
to the frown that seemed almost to be habitual now.</p>

<p>"Looks hopeful," he thought, "at any rate I'm not on a blind
trail. I know I should be justified in arresting him straight
away now. This servant-master business is as ugly as anyone could
wish, but it clinches nothing by itself. It proves no absolute
connection with the Clyde House affair. If we jail him at once on
suspicion and search his place, we may find nothing there. There
are only poor old McIver's notes at best to connect anyone with
the murder and he may easily have sent those away. Besides, if I
arrest him now, I'm arresting an unknown man and even if he turns
out afterwards to be a gentleman very much wanted in another
State, most of the credit of his capture will be lost to me then.
The other johnnies here will see to that, sure. No, I must wait
until I get Larose's letter. I ought to get it in two days at
latest. Then I may find there's a big fish in the net and Mark
Romilly will be a made man." He smiled hopefully to himself, but
almost immediately his frown descended again. "But what if he
escapes?", he went on; "am I forgetting that? I can't shadow him
as I should like and I daren't ask for another single man. If I
ask, I must explain everything and then&mdash;bang goes all my
little plan. I shall be riding again 'to orders' then instead of
winning a good race in my own way. No, I must shoulder the risks
myself. I've always longed for a chance like this and now I've
got it I should be a coward to play for safety and chuck the
whole thing all away. Mark Romilly," he smiled here to himself,
"I'm afraid you're a gambler, my boy. You've won well enough
already but you're going double or quits now, and no one knows
better than you do that the luck doesn't hold for ever."</p>

<p>Jackson came back in half an hour. "He's alright, sir," he
said, "that chauffeur chap. He'll be quite happy at my house and
you've so frightened him that he won't put his nose outside the
door; I'm sure of that."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Jackson," replied the inspector pleasantly; "I'm
sure I'm very much obliged to you over this little affair, and if
it pans out as I believe it's going to you shall have a good
share of all the sugar in your tea. Sit down now and listen to
what I've got to say. My mind's quite made up about everything.
I'm quite convinced that this Eadie chap's a crook, and I
believe, too, he's the man of the McIver affair. But I don't want
to nail him until I know for certain who he is. I've not told you
half of what I know, but when we clap the darbies on him it won't
be just any ordinary criminal we are handcuffing, but a very
master of crime. In thirty-six hours now I ought to get a letter
from Sydney and we'll arrest him that same afternoon." The
inspector paused for a moment and then went on very quietly. "You
understand, Jackson, why I'm not making a fuss. If we pull in the
net now we shan't be knowing what kind of fish it is we're
catching, but if we wait awhile&mdash;if we wait only these few
hours the water will be much clearer then and we shall have all
the credit of the catch to ourselves. We're running some risk I
know, but I depend on you to see that the man doesn't get away.
If anyone leaves the White House&mdash;either as Eadie or the
man&mdash;he must be followed the whole time he is away and at
night you must close in and picket the house. I'm coming out to
help you myself. In the meantime we must try and take some
photographs of him somehow. You're handy with the camera and
we'll have to see about that to-morrow. We're chancing a lot as I
say in one way, but in another&mdash;we'll leave as little to
chance as possible. We'll be careful gamblers, Jackson&mdash;you
and I."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; AN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL</h2>

<p class="first">IT would express little to say that the
inspector was anxious during the next day. As he had told himself
plainly, he was a gambler and he was risking everything on a
single throw. Chance, that wayward goddess, alike of the timid
and the brave, had done her kindest to him, and like a wise man
he was exploiting her favours to the full. Adventure was
appealing at its boldest to him for he was quite aware that in
not arresting the tenant of the White House at once he was
risking all that might make or mar him in the end.</p>

<p>He knew enough now to justify that individual's arrest any
time, and if by so long withholding his hand he allowed the
wretch to escape from the meshes of the law, he would be blamed,
and rightly blamed, for sacrificing everything to his own
personal ends.</p>

<p>But the inspector had been brought up in a hard school, and
all his life long he had so plainly seen that success goes only
to him who is prepared to take risks. Courage, he believed, was
the quality that always counted for most in the end.</p>

<p>As he had said he would, he shared the vigil round the White
House that night, and with the three detectives by him made sure
that in the dark hours neither of Messrs. Eadie and Martin broke
away.</p>

<p>All night long, everything was quiet as the grave, but in
spite of its lack of incident the watch, to him, was not
uninteresting. It recalled so vividly those mighty days in
France, and yet&mdash;with such a difference.</p>

<p>In all the world over there can be nothing more beautiful than
an Adelaide summer night. All things so lend themselves to the
perfect harmony of paradise on earth. The warm soft air, the
scent of ripening fruits, the incense of the sleeping flowers,
the gentle moonlight on the sea, the rest, the quietness, and the
sweetness of it all.</p>

<p><br>
He rang up Miss McIver the next afternoon and received one
little interesting item of news. Martin had very nicely, she
said, been over to inquire about the chauffeur's injury. He had
come over just after breakfast in the morning. Mrs. Carter had
happened to meet him in the garden and had told all that she knew
with perhaps just a little bit more besides. Her aunt, she was
quite aware, added Miss McIver, never wilfully exaggerated, but
she was one of those ladies who always liked to embellish
everything a little, and who also always liked to appear well in
the know.</p>

<p>So, Mr. Martin had gone away that morning with quite a full
and circumstantial account of all the injuries the unfortunate
chauffeur of Clyde House had received, Mrs. Carter making it no
secret either that, in her opinion, things were much worse than
had officially been given out.</p>

<p>The girl gave a gentle little silvery laugh as she was
explaining everything and for the moment the much-worried
inspector had forgotten all his troubles in the music of her
pretty voice.</p>

<p>The same evening he was again taking his share in the watch,
but it must be confessed at once that his thoughts that night
were far more often with the mistress of Clyde House than with
the probable murderer of her uncle.</p>

<p>What a lovely girl she was, he told himself a hundred times
over, and how ridiculous were the barriers that prejudice and
custom had placed between them. She was just the girl that he
could love, and he felt that he could make her happy too. He was
strong and self-reliant and protecting, and she was of the new
type of woman that would come glad and clinging to his arms when
once the cold reserve of pride had given way. She was just the
woman made for him, he thought, for he would understand her. He
could see the soul within her eyes. And just because he was a
policeman and he was poor&mdash;neither of which things made him
any the less a man&mdash;he must look askance at her as if they
were both of them quite different beings, born in quite different
worlds, and not man and woman still together. It was a rotten
thing.</p>

<p>The morning following was an extremely anxious one. The mail
from Sydney was due to arrive just before eleven o'clock, and it
was in high concern that he awaited it. He was building so much
on that letter&mdash;on the possibility that when it did come it
would contain some certain information to link up with the man
they were shadowing. But at the same time he made up his mind
that, whether it came or not, it would not do for him to withhold
his hand any longer. That afternoon he would have to make an
official report to his superior and once he had disclosed all he
had already discovered he was quite aware that the whole business
would be taken out of his hands.</p>

<p>The Melbourne express was, of course, very late that morning,
and he was doing his best to reconcile himself philosophically to
a disappointment when suddenly the much-longed-for letter
arrived.</p>

<p>He breathed a deep sigh of relief as it was brought to him.
Yes, the Sydney postmark right enough, and in the well-remembered
handwriting of his old friend Larose, too.</p>

<p>He opened the envelope quickly and for a moment felt irritated
that the letter was so long. It comprised six large pages.</p>

<p>Recovering his composure he sat himself back in his chair and
commenced to read.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Headquarters, Detective Office</span>,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Sydney</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear Mark</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">Good luck to you, old man, and may the devil
take you. Funny, but I was not at all surprised to get your wire
an hour back. I was thinking of you this morning and you'll soon
see why. Now I've got an hour and five minutes before the mail
leaves and for old friendship's sake I'll spread myself out a bit
and give you a good old yarn.</p>

<p class="letter">No&mdash;there's no one here named Rook doing
seven years, but&mdash;there's a gentleman named Bird, Charles
Henry Bird, to be precise, doing that exact term of years; and to
his associates before touching quod he was, I believe, always
referred to as Rook. I have no doubt but that he is the party you
mean. Myself, I am particularly interested in this individual
because it was almost wholly through the activities of yours
truly that he is at present a tenant in the jug. Do you know,
Mark, my boy, that any mention of this self-same Bird recalls at
once one of the happiest and at the same time one of the very
saddest memories of my life. Happiest because I nabbed him under
circumstances of almost unparalleled difficulty and saddest
because I missed only by a hair's breadth potting all the members
of the gang. He was associated with the Goudie Street Bank crowd,
just eighteen months ago. If you remember they shot the bank
manager and raided the bank. All in broad daylight too. There
were five of them in it. Friend Rook, Burke the Forger, Phillip
Masterton, the lithographic crook, Andrew, the garrotter, and,
last but not least, Cloud the Smiter, of international fame. As
nice a little lot of first-class beauties as you could ever wish
to see hang. Every man-jack of them had well earned the rope.</p>

<p class="letter">Well, one dark August night I had shadowed them
all to a certain house, and was just beautifully closing the trap
when five minutes before&mdash;no, not three minutes
before&mdash;the Smiter sensed danger in that ghastly way of his
and everyone flew off. I tell you, Mark, I nearly died of
disappointment. I got Bird two days later, but that didn't make
up for it anyway. We have never yet learnt what made them all
suddenly fly. Just sheer intuition on the Smiter's part I shall
always believe. As I expect you know, we got all the forging
plant they left. They were by far the smartest and most artistic
utterers of false stuff that the Commonwealth has ever known.
Unhappily they got away with a whole heap of the falsies they had
already printed and, as no doubt you also know, there's been
trouble in the Commonwealth ever since. The banks here have had
the wind up terribly, although happily things have been quite
quiet lately in that line.</p>

<p class="letter">As I say, Bird we did catch, but, bad as he
was, he was quite the gentleman of the lot. Of the other four
devils we have never heard a thing since that night when they
escaped. Never a sign nor a sound has come out of the darkness
that seemed to completely swallow them up. How they got out of
the State goodness only knows, and where they are now it'd be
worth almost a king's ransom to find out.</p>

<p class="letter">I am telling you all this so that you may
understand the importance of what follows.</p>

<p class="letter">Well, you want to know something of these men,
these pals of Rook, now doing seven years hard. I have met all of
them separately at different times and if I had not foolishly
held my hand too long to nab them all together I should have at
least had three of them if not all the lot.</p>

<p class="letter">But, Mark, my boy, do you really want me to
tell you anything more about this remarkable man? As a budding
criminologist yourself, his history ought to be fairly familiar
to you. Perhaps, however, your war duties were engrossing you at
the time he was becoming famous. His life has been so crowded
with events that with all the interest that even I took in him I
have forgotten quite a lot. A first-class Yankee crook, he
escaped from Sing Sing prison about seven years ago, and worried
the authorities in the United States quite a lot until he
suddenly transferred his attentions to British India. He operated
there in one way and another for about four years, until the
place got too hot for him, and then he landed in this benighted
Commonwealth to give us a turn. His career here has been much the
same as in India and the United States, except that here he has
specialised particularly in bank work and forged treasury notes.
We would give anything to get hold of him, for not only is he
fearless and capable himself, but also he is a great organiser of
crime. The almost complete success of the long series of bank
robberies that he and his associates carried out over here about
two years ago was a stunning blow to the banking world as witness
the reward of &pound;2,000 on offer for his arrest. We know a good bit
about him for from time to time we have scooped in not a few of
the men who have been helping him, although I must say we have
never found any of them particularly anxious to give him away.
Curiously enough, they have a great respect for him and are
devilishly afraid of him too. They say he instantly punishes
anyone who disobeys; and certainly there were several mysterious
happenings to certain of his band two years ago, when he was
operating over here. He never hesitates in the use of the pistol
himself, and is twice wanted here on the capital charge.</p>

<p class="letter">Well, friend Romilly, you know now if you
didn't know before exactly what the Smiter is like. He is capable
of any crime that for its success requires to be boldly and
fearlessly carried out. That's why I was thinking of you this
morning long before your telegram came. I was reading about the
McIver case and you being in charge. Just such a job as the
Smiter would love, I said to myself, if he were acting on his
own.</p>

<p class="letter">So here's luck to you and if you see anyone at
all like Mr. Joseph Arthur Cloud in your neighbourhood, just you
nab him at once. But be careful, my boy, be very, very careful.
In a tight corner, he's a man who shoots on sight. He shoots from
the hip too. They say he carries poison about with him and has
boasted no one'll ever take him alive. So he's a nice beauty for
anyone to have anything to do with. One thing&mdash;as I've told
you before&mdash;he's a holy terror to get near to at any time if
your intentions are not friendly. He's got a sense, an extra
sense that seems always to warn him of danger. He's had escapes
without number and escapes by so narrow a margin that it's quite
incredible how he's managed so many times to get away. The very
slightest thing is sufficient to warn him and he vanishes at
once. Mind you&mdash;he's always got another hiding place ready
prepared.</p>

<p class="letter">Really, you will think I am dotty to have
written you all this, but I have special reasons for being so
discursive. I feel sure you would not have worried me about
Rook's associates if you had not happened to have one of them in
your mind's eye in connection with this present case of
yours&mdash;and if you have got one of them, it can only be the
Smiter. The strangling of that poor old man at Glenelg has all
the special features of the Smiter's daring when he is acting
solely on his own.</p>

<p class="letter">Well, good-bye, old chap; think of me when you
next crack a small bottle.</p>

<p class="letter">Your old pal.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Gilbert Larose</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">P.S. The Smiter was professor of Ju-Jitsu once,
and if you lift your fist to strike him when he's ready for you,
in nine cases out of ten he'll just reach out and break your arm.
He's got muscles of drawn steel. Andrew's a bad man to tackle
too&mdash;so look out for either of them.</p>

<p><br>
There was a long silence and the inspector sat quiet and
motionless in his chair. "Fate, fate," he muttered at last; "how
inscrutable are so many of the ways of this bad old world of
ours. Escape and immunity for so long and then"&mdash;he shrugged
his shoulders as if giving up the problem&mdash;"just one chance
word and the whole castle of good fortune crashes to the ground;
the Law gets busy and the hempen rope begins to swing." He
whistled softly to himself. "Cloud the Smiter, but what a
find!"</p>

<p>He rose briskly to his feet. "Now for the chief," he muttered
with a grim smile. "His Mightiness will be delighted with the
little present I am going to give him; let's hope he'll only be
grateful too. J. A. Cloud is a big fish for any net to draw in."
The inspector paused suddenly and looked troubled. "But it's a
pity," he added to himself, "a great pity we couldn't have landed
the whole gang." For some moments he stared meditatively out of
the window and then, turning, his eyes fell thoughtfully upon a
large map of Australia that hung upon the wall. "It's a big
country," he remarked slowly, "but I wonder, I wonder now why
Adelaide specially was chosen for the headquarters of the gang.
Headquarters, headquarters, great Scott, that gives me an idea."
He screwed his eyes up in perplexity. "Now was the Smiter
intending always to live alone? Where are the others, and what
have they been doing all this time? Friend Burke, the honest
burglar man&mdash;Masterton, the banker's pet, and jolly Andrew,
with his bit of rope. Have they been all resting, too?" Again the
inspector paused, and this time it was plain from the expression
of his face that he was thinking rapidly.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he ejaculated suddenly in great excitement, "but
haven't I finished yet; must it be double or quits again? I'll
see, I'll see."</p>

<p>He almost ran to a cupboard at the far end of the room and
reaching down a thick pile of newspapers began feverishly to turn
over their contents.</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER OF THE POLICE</h2>


<p class="first">IT had been half past eleven when the inspector
had finished the perusal of the letter from Sydney, but it was
fully two o'clock before he actually presented himself before the
Chief Commissioner of the Adelaide Police.</p>

<p>Inwardly, he was seething with excitement, but outwardly there
was no sign of any emotion upon his face. He was just the cold
and formal inspector making a report to his superior and he was
calm and official after the manner of his kind.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, Inspector?" asked the Chief rather
irritably. "Have you anything about the McIver case yet?"</p>

<p>"I have found out, sir," replied the inspector quietly, "that
J. A. Cloud is living in Glenelg; the J. A. Cloud wanted in
Sydney. He is living close to the house where Mr. McIver was
murdered. He has been there for nearly ten months and there is
every probability that he is the man we want."</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner sat bolt upright in his chair.</p>

<p>"What," he exclaimed incredulously, "Cloud, the Sydney
man!&mdash;the one wanted over the Goudie Street Bank affair,
down here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Cloud, the Smiter, the leader of the gang. He's
living at present as a gentleman of means in a house he actually
rented from the man who was killed. The two were on friendly
terms together."</p>

<p>The Commissioner stared hard at his subordinate.</p>

<p>"You've got him here then?" he asked quickly. "You've taken
him up?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I've only just learnt who he is; but he's under
close surveillance and won't be able to get away. He's J. A.
Cloud, right enough."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" ejaculated the Commissioner, "you certainly
have got something this time." Then he added anxiously&mdash;"But
you're quite sure, Inspector, quite sure, that he's the man?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, sir," replied the inspector quietly, "but it'll
take some minutes to tell you all. The story's rather
involved."</p>

<p>The Commissioner took off his glasses and proceeded to polish
them carefully upon his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"No hurry, Romilly," he said kindly. "Sit down and take your
time. If you're only right, it'll be a great day for us
here."</p>

<p>The inspector placed upon the table the bundle of papers he
had been holding, and drawing up his chair, sat down. He
moistened his lips with his tongue and then, fixing his eyes upon
his superior, began his report in quiet and even tones.</p>

<p>"Last year, sir, according to our records, at twenty minutes
past two upon the morning of Tuesday, the eighth of January, a
man was picked up in an unconscious condition by Constable Lodge,
in the roadway just opposite North Terrace Station. He was taken
to the Adelaide Hospital and was found to be suffering from
concussion. It was supposed he had been knocked down by a
motor-car. There was nothing at all in his pockets, and for the time
being there were no means of identifying him in any way. For a
week he was unable to give any account of himself and even then
he had apparently no clear recollection of what had occurred. But
inquiries soon came in about him from outside and he was claimed
by his relations from Sydney, and when able to travel was taken
back by them there,"&mdash;the inspector here looked down upon
the papers before him on the table&mdash;"and this apparently,
from the discharge book of the hospital, took place on the
ensuing February 6th. Well, sir, for the moment I have not
thought it necessary to go further into the identity of this man,
but last week on Thursday I received a letter from
him&mdash;despatched three days previously from Sydney. I have
the letter here and it is an extraordinary one. He says he is
induced to write to me personally because of an illustration he
happened to see in one of the Sydney newspapers. It appears he
came across a photograph of the house in which Mr. McIver was
murdered and he writes that the sandhills about the place
reminded him of a dreadful adventure he had&mdash;or dreamt he
had&mdash;over here, a little more than a year ago. He warns me
frankly, however, that he is supposed not to be quite right in
his mind and that no one will give credit to what he says.</p>

<p>"His story is this: He believes he was bicycling one evening
along the Military Road between Semaphore and Grange when he
overheard two men talking about a friend of theirs who had been
sentenced to seven years penal servitude. Curious, and suspecting
they themselves were evil doers too, he followed them to a lonely
bungalow among the sandhills and tried to spy upon them through
the shutters. He was discovered, however, and dragged inside.
Four men questioned him and then he was locked up in a wood-shed
in the yard. Terrified at the thought of what they might be going
to do to him he broke down the door and tried to escape. They
fired at him with a pistol and believing him to be dead they then
threw him into the sea. He drifted as far as some pier, probably
Henley Beach pier, and then dragged himself ashore, and started
to walk back to the city." The inspector paused for a moment and
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"That, sir, is all he
remembers."</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner looked puzzled. "An extraordinary
story, Romilly," he remarked drily, "and it strikes me as an
improbable one too."</p>

<p>"Last Tuesday, sir," replied the inspector quietly and
ignoring the comment, "we found the bungalow exactly as he
described it, about two miles from Semaphore, and in the yard
there was a shed the door of which had at one time been
undoubtedly violently broken down."</p>

<p>"Great Scott," exclaimed the Commissioner in some excitement,
"then it was true then?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly true, sir, at any rate in every particular that we
have been able to follow up."</p>

<p>"And who is living there now?" asked the Commissioner quickly,
"any of the four men?"</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head. "New tenants, sir, a man and a
woman and three children. They have been there since March 5th
last. Their predecessors, I learnt moved away on the previous
day, March 4th."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the Commissioner, "and come to the point."</p>

<p>The inspector resumed his narrative. "Well now, sir, I come
directly to the McIver case. From the first moment there I was of
opinion that the murder had been done by someone intimately
acquainted with the house&mdash;by someone who knew all the ways
of the inmates and who was quite aware of there being a large sum
of money in the house on that particular night. Everything about
the crime pointed to a careful and methodical preparation and yet
I knew the preparation could have only been, at most, a matter of
a little over twenty-four hours. It was on the Friday that Mr.
McIver received an unexpected cheque of &pound;300 and announced to his
friends his intention of giving the money a run at the races, and
it was on the Saturday that the watch dog of the house was
drugged. It was in the short interval, then, of these intervening
hours that someone had prepared and completed his plans. I at
once made searching inquiries as to whom McIver had been brought
in contact with on the Friday and was interested straight away,
for several reasons, in his friend and neighbour Mr. Charles
Eadie, the tenant of the White House.</p>

<p>"The White House is only distant about three hundred yards
from the scene of the murder and Miss McIver told me it was
occupied by this Mr. Eadie and his servant, a man called Martin.
Eadie had been quite friendly with her uncle and had dined and
lunched with them upon several occasions. He was, I was informed,
a gentleman of independent means, an artist for his own amusement
and had been residing there for about ten months. As far as I
could gather he was quite a reputable person and was well
respected by everyone in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"I interviewed him, however, and his man-servant, too, and the
similarity of a chance remark they both made roused my suspicion
that they had something to hide. I had the house watched
therefore by two of our men&mdash;from the window of the McIver
garage and they wrote down hour by hour everything exactly as it
occurred." The inspector paused here for a moment and then,
resuming his narrative, dropped his voice to a very low tone.
"Then we found&mdash;we found, sir, that although all the time we
were supposed to be watching two persons&mdash;actually we were
only watching one. The master and the servant were the same
man."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?", asked the Commissioner
sharply&mdash;"that there was only one man living in the
house?"</p>

<p>"Yes, only one. The master and his servant are identical. It
is one man and two disguises. There is no doubt about it. The
proofs are quite conclusive."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" ejaculated the Commissioner; "that's suspicious
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and remember that for ten months the deception has
been going on. Day upon day for the past ten months this man at
the White House has been continually changing his clothes, just
like a Jack-in-the-box. He has been altering his appearance at
least a dozen times a day, even to his sets of false teeth."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure?" asked the Commissioner thoughtfully.
"What is the nature of your proof?"</p>

<p>The inspector picked up a number of sheets of paper pinned
together and handed them across the table. "Here, sir," he said,
"is the record of several days' watching from the garage. One
hundred and ninety-four entries of what took place in the garden
and on the verandah of the house. One hundred and ninety-four
entries to report and yet never once you will notice that the
master and servant are seen together at the same time."</p>

<p>For a few moments the Commissioner scanned quickly over the
papers and then his face broke into a broad smile.</p>

<p>"Remarkable, Romilly," he exclaimed, "and very clever of you I
must admit." He tapped the papers. "Putting everything down like
this in black and white was quite a master stroke on your part
and it brings absolute conviction to my mind. When you were
telling me just now, I confess I wasn't over-much impressed, but
with these entries before my eyes the whole thing stands out as
clear as day. Of course, the man is hiding right enough and the
dual personality is a wonderful idea. It takes away all the
gossip and the interest that would be centred round a man who
lived alone."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the inspector, "everyone would be curious,
and suspicious about a man who lived by himself; they would be
wondering about his occupation and his source of income, and what
also made him come to live there at all, but"&mdash;the inspector
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"a gentleman and his man-servant!
Well, what could be more harmless and respectable?"</p>

<p>"When was this watch kept?" asked the Commissioner suddenly
with a frown, "I ought to have been informed what you were about
before."</p>

<p>"I only put the men on four days ago, sir," said the
inspector, speaking very rapidly and feeling rather like a man
who was skating over thin ice&mdash;"and it was only two days ago
that I became really suspicious. Then in the middle of it all I
received that anonymous letter and there is one thing there I
forgot to tell you. The writer described one of his captors that
night in the bungalow, and apparently the one in authority there,
as a man who looked like a butler. Well, the description is
exactly that of the manservant in the White House."</p>

<p>The Commissioner nodded his head. "Go on," he said, "what
comes next?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I come now to what indisputably links up
everything together. You will remember that I told you the woman
in the bungalow near Semaphore informed us she had moved in there
on the 5th of March last, and that the tenant before her had left
only the previous day. Well, directly I got that letter I went up
to Clyde House and saw Miss McIver. I asked the exact date when
this Mr. Eadie had come to live in their neighbourhood and,
looking into her late uncle's diary, she informed me at once that
it had occurred as I expected on the 4th of March. He had given
no references but had paid six months' rent in advance."</p>

<p>The Commissioner whistled. "Did you give Miss McIver any hint
of your suspicions? Did you let her know in any way, I mean, that
you were of opinion this man Eadie was a man of criminal
character?"</p>

<p>The inspector got a little red. "I told her everything," he
said firmly; "she is a woman you can trust."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the Commissioner, without any comment. "What did
you do then?"</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," continued the inspector, "I had wired to Sydney,
to my friend Larose. I know him very well."</p>

<p>"Ah! Larose," commented the Commissioner, "the great
Larose&mdash;the wizard detective as they call him, but why did
you wire particularly to him, to Sydney, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Because, sir, I learnt that the man in the Semaphore bungalow
had left behind him a lot of old newspapers that were Sydney
ones, and I gathered naturally therefore that some time or other
his interests had lain there."</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;and you got an answer to your telegram?"</p>

<p>The inspector held out a letter to the Chief Commissioner.</p>

<p>"This came this morning by the Melbourne express and it is so
vital, sir, that I will ask you to read it through yourself."</p>

<p>His superior took the letter at once and then for a long five
minutes there was silence in the room. The inspector leant back
in his chair, and appeared to be assiduously examining the
patterns that the cracks had made in the ceiling. For the first
time during the interview, however, it might now have been said
he was nervous.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner took quite a long time to read the
letter and several times he went through a passage twice. At
length he looked up and there was no doubt at all as to the
pleased expression on his face.</p>

<p>"Excellent," he exclaimed, "excellent; you've done splendidly.
Everything is quite conclusive to my mind. It's a great find and
we'll make the arrest at once."</p>

<p>The inspector rose suddenly to his feet. He was flushed and
expectant and there was a look of intense eagerness upon his
face.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said earnestly, "I have not done yet. J. A. Cloud is
only one of the four and we must get the whole gang. We must
wait."</p>

<p>"Wait?" asked the Commissioner with a frown, "what for?"</p>

<p>The inspector pulled his chair up close to the table and
calmly resumed his seat. Strangely enough now, all appearance of
excitement had died down and he was once again the cold and
business-like officer of the South Australian police. He picked
up a bundle of newspaper cuttings from among the little pile of
papers before him.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said calmly, "will you listen to me for a few
minutes? Something has come into my mind."</p>

<p>The Commissioner looked at him sharply. "Of course I'll listen
to you," he said pleasantly, "your work here has been so thorough
that I should be a fool now, or at any time, not to consider your
advice. Now what do you mean?"</p>

<p>For just a moment the inspector hesitated.</p>

<p>"The White House at Glenelg, sir," he replied solemnly, "is
about to become the headquarters of the Smiter's gang. J. A.
Cloud is waiting there for his associates and there is every
reason to believe that their coming is now only a matter of a few
days."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the Commissioner very coldly, "but have you
any proof?"</p>

<p>Again the inspector hesitated. "No proof that is direct, sir,
I admit, but hear what I have to say before you turn this
possibility down." He glanced up at the clock above the
Commissioner's desk.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said solemnly, "I received the letter from Sydney
that you have just read a little over three hours ago and if I
did not bring it to you at once, it was because I was following
up the train of thought that it suggested to me." He leant over
towards his superior and spoke very quietly. "If you look back,
sir, you will notice that up to about six weeks ago this State
has been singularly free from crime. For a long time from one end
of South Australia to the other there have been no unusual
happenings to record, and indeed the whole Commonwealth generally
has seemed to be enjoying a period of law-abiding repose. The
Goudie Street Bank case in Sydney eighteen months ago, where the
perpetrators, if not all brought to justice, were at least
scattered and forced to fly, is the last of the greater problems
that the Commonwealth police have been called upon to solve, and
since then the detective forces everywhere in Australia have been
having an easy time. But it has not unhappily been the same in
other countries not far away." The inspector picked up a
newspaper cutting. "Six months back&mdash;in July last for
instance&mdash;there was quite an epidemic of crime in the Malay
States. Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore had all a dose of
trouble and pretty severe trouble too. Robberies with violence on
the open road, two banks broken into, a murder in The Bentham,
Singapore's crack hotel, and the stabbing of the purser of the
mail boat Riallo when that vessel was in port there. All very
serious crimes and yet their perpetrators as far as I can gather
went quite unpunished. Nothing discovered and no one brought to
book. Then Java had a bad turn, more robberies and a jeweller
strangled at the back of his shop. Again no discovery and no one
brought to book. Then there was quiet again until that shooting
case in Darwin last September." The inspector dropped his voice
to a very significant tone. "You will notice now, sir, that the
incidence of crime is coming nearer home."</p>

<p>"Oh! I see what you mean, Romilly," smiled the Commissioner,
"and what you are trying to make out. You want to suggest to me
that all these happenings are the work of the Smiter's gang, who
for the time being has been giving the Commonwealth a rest."</p>

<p>"No, I don't want to suggest anything to you, sir," replied
the inspector diplomatically. "I only want to recall these facts
to you and leave you yourself to consider their significance in
the light of what we know of J. A. Cloud and the methods of his
associates in crime."</p>

<p>"Well, go on; but, of course, I remember that affair at Port
Darwin."</p>

<p>"An hotel-keeper shot," prompted the inspector, "with the
assassin getting away with about a hundred pounds. It was done in
broad daylight, too, and the man escaped through a window at the
back. It was a most daring piece of work because there were lots
of people in the hotel at the time."</p>

<p>"No trace was found either of the robber," commented the
Commissioner.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the inspector drily, "and the only description
I see from the cutting here that anyone could give of the robber
was that he was dark and not a big man." He paused for a moment
and then added quietly&mdash;"That, sir, is the exact description
that Larose gives of Andrew, the garrotter."</p>

<p>"Well, go on," said the Commissioner, "what comes next?"</p>

<p>The inspector took another cutting off the table. "Perth comes
next, sir, on October 24th. An unknown man murdered near the
race-course on the Western Cup day. Stunned and then thrown into
the creek. Nothing of value found upon him, but&mdash;a race-card
and a Grand Stand pass-out check in his pockets suggested that he
had been on the race-course." Again the inspector paused.
"Nathaniel Burke, sir," he said drily, "specialises in racecourse
crimes."</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner made no remark. He was frowning and
looking out of the window. The inspector went on.</p>

<p>"Next, sir, we have Oodnadatta in our own State, on November
8th last. Quite a trivial case here. A forged cheque cashed at
the Consolidated Bank. Only for &pound;75 it's true, but still it was
almost all the customer had lying then to his credit in the bank.
You will remember the manager's statement that the forged cheque
was the finest piece of work he had ever seen." The inspector
dropped his voice to almost purring tones. "Phillip Masterton,
sir, is a great artist with his pen."</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner shuffled uneasily in his chair. "You're
persistent, Romilly," he said still frowning, "and I suppose you
bring up Port Augusta next."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the relentless inspector, "and we're much
nearer home now. Port Augusta, 212 miles from Adelaide and just a
week ago. The Commonwealth Bank this time, and an attempt to
break in that luckily failed. Another bank, you see, but the
significance of everything does not lie all there." He fixed his
eyes intently upon the Commissioner. "The Darwin, Perth and
Oodnadatta crimes were all, as far as we can see, one-man
affairs. Where any evidence is adduced as to who was carrying
them out, it is only one individual in each particular case who
is ever mentioned. There is no suggestion in any of the separate
Press reports that I have here before me that any of these crimes
were engineered by partners or a gang. You follow me, sir?" The
Commissioner nodded. "Well, what happens at Port
Augusta&mdash;the junction at which the Perth and Oodnadatta
railway lines converge&mdash;what happens there?"</p>

<p>"Two men we know were on the business there," said the
Commissioner&mdash;"that's what you want to drive in, isn't it?
You think that the law-breaker from Perth joined forces at Port
Augusta with the law-breaker from Oodnadatta."</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir," said the inspector, "that's my point."</p>

<p>"And to elaborate it," continued the Commissioner drily in his
turn, "you think that the man of violence from Perth and the bank
specialist from Oodnadatta, so to speak, pooled their abilities
when they met, of course by pre-arrangement, at Port Augusta. The
bank specialist said 'I know all about banks,' and the man of
violence said 'and I can break in anywhere '&mdash;so, of course,
it was a bank that they at once selected as the subject for their
talents."</p>

<p>"Sir," said the inspector, speaking as if he were a little
nettled. "Two hours ago I went carefully through the records of
all the four men referred to in Larose's letter and the attempt
at Port Augusta three weeks ago appears to me to be, as you say,
exactly the sort of combination work that one expects when Burke
and Masterton were working in co."</p>

<p>"But surely, man," said the Commissioner rather testily, "even
if you have correctly dove-tailed together all these outrages
that you have enumerated&mdash;you don't think you have yet given
me anything tangible enough to make it worth the risk of letting
this J. A. Cloud remain free even for another four and twenty
hours? Remember what Larose says about him and how he vanishes at
once. What gives you even the faintest encouragement to hope that
we can get the others if we leave this Smiter free?"</p>

<p>"But I am going on what has always happened before, sir," the
inspector replied earnestly; "you will remember we have an
accurate crime record of J. A. Cloud for at least the last
fifteen years and in Professor Summerfield's monograph on Crime
there are eleven pages alone devoted to this remarkable man, and
as far back as we have any record of him we see one thing that
always stands out clearly. J. A. Cloud has been always an
organiser rather than an individual in crime. He has worked in
gangs always, and indeed before this McIver case there seems to
be no history of his ever having worked alone. His line of
activity has been invariably the same. He appears in a certain
part of the world. He collects round him men of his own abnormal
type. He starts operations and in a few months with his
associates deals out to the community a series of stunning blows.
For a time their activities are stupendous and then&mdash;when
things are getting too hot for them and it seems almost certain
they are about to be laid by the heels&mdash;the whole gang
breaks up in a moment, and every one of them disappears. In J. A.
Cloud's career this has happened over and over again. It happened
in Detroit in 1909, it happened in Pennsylvania two years
afterwards, it happened in Lahore four years ago and it happened
in Sydney the year before last. Always the same tactics, a total
disappearance for the time and then&mdash;resurrection and
re-union somewhere else later on."</p>

<p>"Really, Inspector&mdash;you're quite eloquent," broke in the
Commissioner smilingly, "and so you think all the portents are
that the Smiter's gang are now converging on Adelaide and picking
up so to speak individual little trifles on their way."</p>

<p>"I do, sir," said the inspector frowning. He did not quite
like the bantering tone of his superior.</p>

<p>"Don't be annoyed, Romilly," said the Commissioner, at once
becoming serious again, "for upon my soul in spite of myself you
have half-convinced me. Let me think now. Four men left in the
Smiter's gang and the Smiter himself now living alone in Glenelg.
It will be a great thing for us anyhow to have got J. A. Cloud,
but I agree with you it would be the coup of a generation if we
could catch the whole gang. The violent decease of Andrew, the
garrotter, especially is long overdue. Is it, however, in any way
feasible to expect a re-union of the gang again here and, if so,
are there any portents to suggest that it is going to take place
shortly? You are of the opinion that the omens are all favourable
and that from what has happened lately in other parts of this
State, the other three much-wanted gentry are now converging upon
Adelaide. In support of this idea you point out that one-man
crimes in Perth and Oodnadatta have quite automatically been
succeeded by a two-man crime at Port Augusta, when at the
junction of the railway lines, the two ruffians have finally
met."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is my point, sir," said the inspector.</p>

<p>"Well, Romilly, but so far we have at any rate only heard of
two men and we want three. Now, if we hold our hand here, how
long pray shall we have to wait for this third gentleman to
appear? He may be never coming for aught we know."</p>

<p>There was a sudden knock upon the door and a police sergeant
entered and saluted. He was carrying a paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"'Phone message from Peterborough, sir," he said briskly.
"Porter from the Consolidated Bank there knocked down and robbed
in the street and his satchel taken away. Three men attacked him
and they all got away."</p>

<p>The sergeant spread the paper open upon the desk before the
Commissioner and then, saluting again, retired quickly from the
room and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>For a full minute neither the Commissioner nor the inspector
spoke; then the former tilted himself back in his chair and
laughed softly.</p>

<p>"Excellent, even the stars are fighting for you, Romilly.
Peterborough now only 150 miles away and three men in it this
time." His voice suddenly became grave again, "Yes, yes, for a
little while at any rate, I'll risk it," then he glared almost
angrily at the inspector&mdash;"But look you here, Romilly, it'll
be disgrace for us both if we fail, you understand?"</p>

<p>The inspector smiled happily. "But we won't fail, sir."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE INVISIBLE CORDON</h2>

<p class="first">UPON the evening of the following day Inspector
Romilly was again closeted with the Chief Commissioner of the
Adelaide police. Both men were looking anxious and the
Commissioner was frowning over two large-sized photographs that
he was holding in his hands.</p>

<p>"I don't like it, Romilly," he said nervously, "it seems
devilish to me." He puckered his eyebrows close together. "Do you
mean to assure me that these photographs are of one and the same
man."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the inspector, "and both taken within a
quarter of an hour of one another. Jackson snapped them this
morning as I have told you from a laundry van going slowly before
the front of the house. He got the Smiter full in view both times
just by the garden hedge."</p>

<p>"Then think what we are up against. Here's a man who almost
can work miracles and who will be able to get away from us any
moment he wants to by just adopting another disguise. There are
no points in common between these photographs here."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir," protested the inspector, "look at the hands. We
were lucky in getting them there, for when out walking as Mr.
Eadie, the Smiter invariably wears gloves. There's a strong
similarity too in the poise of the head."</p>

<p>The Commissioner however still frowned. "But I don't like it,
I tell you, Romilly, and looking at the face of the man Martin
here, I doubt by a long way if we have all the trump cards in our
hands. Look at that forehead and those eyes. He's not a man to be
at any time caught unawares and he'll be thinking out every move
of the game, every moment as it goes along. It's quite possible
he's tumbled long ago to the fact that he's being watched and if
so he'll break away in spite of you all."</p>

<p>"But he can't, sir," insisted the inspector, not however
without a certain trace of misgiving in his own tones. "I've got
such a cordon round him that he can't break through. There are
ten of our men on watch within half a mile of the White House and
we have managed in one way and another that every one of them
knows him by sight; they have all had a good look at him, both as
Mr. Eadie and the man, and are all well acquainted with his
appearance now."</p>

<p>"Has he been shadowed everywhere whenever he has gone
out?"</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head emphatically. "No, sir, nothing
of that. We don't dare to, for one thing because the smoked
glasses that he wears as Mr. Eadie have got mirror-rims to them
at the side. I have caught the sun flashing on them several
times. He can see behind him without turning round."</p>

<p>"Then where is the security," asked the Commissioner
irritably, "that he can't just walk out of the house any moment
that he pleases, and just disappear?"</p>

<p>The inspector took a paper out of his breast pocket. "Sir," he
said quietly, "I'll explain what I have done and I believe you
will approve," he hesitated for a moment and then went on
confidently. "You see, sir, the instant I realised I was dealing
with J. A. Cloud, I knew it would be fatal to shadow him in the
ordinary way. As you have just said, he is no ordinary man and
although I am no believer in the extra sense that Larose mentions
in his letter, still, all Cloud's crime-story shows him to be
extraordinarily sensitive whenever unfriendly influences are near
him."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the Commissioner savagely, "he's a devil there.
I've been reading up everything about him."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," went on the inspector, "in consequence I have had
to go about things quite differently with him and I have
disturbed nothing that surrounds him in his daily life. For
instance I have not attempted to enlist against him one single
person with whom he is habitually brought in contact. I have not
dared either to ask one question of the postman, the newspaper
man, the tradesmen who call for orders or the people who serve
him in the shops. Even the policemen at Glenelg have not had a
whisper of what is going on; I have been afraid he would notice
something in their faces if he should happen to speak to
them."</p>

<p>"Good," said the Commissioner, "quite good and well thought
out too&mdash;but what about the shadowing then?"</p>

<p>The inspector handed him the paper he had been holding.</p>

<p>"This, sir, is a map of the surroundings of the White House
and you will see at once why he cannot break away."</p>

<p>"H'm," muttered the Commissioner, "a circle with the White
House in the centre?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and it has every road marked in it, every paddock
and every stretch of sand. Those red crosses show where our men
are stationed and all, you see, are about the circumference of
the circle. Except for two men over the McIver garage, there is
no one watching within a quarter of a mile of the White House. My
idea was that he should be free and untrammelled all about his
home for it is there, if he has any suspicions at all, he will be
most on the look out. As it is now there is no possibility of
awakening any distrust and he can go free and unwatched
until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Until when?" asked the Commissioner quickly.</p>

<p>"Until," said the inspector grimly, "that moment when he
crosses the circumference of the circle and then he will be
followed instantly and at all costs and never be lost sight
of."</p>

<p>"It's a risk," said the Commissioner gloomily, "a great risk.
We're gambling, Romilly, you and I."</p>

<p>"No, sir," smiled the inspector, "not such a risk as would
first appear, for as Mr. Eadie he wears a surgical boot on his
right foot and cannot on that account walk very far."</p>

<p>The Commissioner was silent for a moment. "Well, what about
his correspondence&mdash;he's in the habit of receiving letters
you say."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but then again I haven't dared to tamper with them
in case he should be setting traps for us to see if his letters
were being milked. That he often received letters I have learnt
right enough, but I rather fancy he occasionally writes them to
himself. You see it might look strange if he never received any
letters at all and in time it might ultimately get about and make
people talk." The inspector grinned. "I had a quiet talk with the
Glenelg postmaster last night and actually handled two letters
that 'Charles Eadie Esq.' was to receive this morning. One bore
the Adelaide postmark and from the printing on the envelope I saw
it came from Hackett, the seed merchant, of Rundle Street. Quite
unimportant to us I thought, and I let it go. The other however
bore the local postmark and the handwriting on it was of an
elaboration that suggested, at any rate to my mind, that it was
disguised. I dared not steam the envelope open to make sure, in
case he had sealed up a grain of permanganate of potash under the
flap for then the whole envelope would have turned pink."</p>

<p>The Commissioner smiled. "Well, Romilly, you are certainly
thoughtful and we'll hope for the best." His frown returned
again. "But mind you&mdash;mind you, I only intend to wait three
days and one of them has already gone."</p>

<p><br>
It was a pleasant sunny afternoon and Mr. Eadie came out of
the White House intent evidently upon a little stroll. He was
smartly and tastefully dressed and he was carrying, as he always
did, his heavy silver-handled walking stick. He paused
thoughtfully for a moment as he closed the wire door and
contemplatively regarded the exact way in which it shut. Then he
walked slowly down the garden path and from the pleased
expression on his face he was evidently noting with approval how
spick and span everything was. He turned into the high road and
in the same quiet and leisurely fashion walked towards the sea.
He met the afternoon postman returning from his round and in
passing gave him the time of day.</p>

<p>"No letters then for me, postman?" he said pleasantly. "You've
left me out this time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the postman smiling; "a very light
delivery for everyone this afternoon."</p>

<p>Mr. Eadie passed up a straight stretch of road about two
hundred yards long and then turned sharply at right angles into a
little side street. Once round the corner however he stopped
abruptly and for quite a long while stood admiringly before a
large bed of asters in the garden of the house before him. He was
in no hurry to move on and indeed it almost seemed as if he were
waiting for someone to come after him, although he never once
turned round. He just stared at the asters as if he had never
seen such beautiful flowers before. It was strange, for they were
quite ordinary asters and, besides that, the bed was not by any
means too well kept.</p>

<p>At last, however, he resumed his walk and leisurely as before
went on towards the sea. His lame foot was evidently troubling
him, and for quite half an hour he rested behind a small sandhill
before he started to return home. He did not then return by the
way he came; instead he proceeded through the town.</p>

<p>When nearly home again he encountered one of the township
policemen and the latter, evidently knowing him, saluted
respectfully. Mr. Eadie stopped at once.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, constable," he remarked, "lovely day, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the policeman, "but a little bit too hot
for me."</p>

<p>"Business slack?" asked Mr. Eadie, evidently noting that the
policeman seemed in no particular hurry to move on.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," smiled back the policeman, "nothing doing;
everything quiet as a Sunday school picnic."</p>

<p>"But you haven't caught the wretch who killed my poor friend
McIver yet?"</p>

<p>The policeman at once became grave. "No, sir, and we're not
likely too," he replied; "in my opinion men like that are never
caught at all, unless they are caught right away. A few days
undiscovered and they always get clear."</p>

<p>"But I see that clever inspector of yours, Inspector Romilly I
mean, still occasionally comes up here. I have sometimes noticed
him about."</p>

<p>"Very keen officer, Inspector Romilly," said the policeman and
then he grinned; "always keeps a good eye, too, for a pretty
face."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mr. Eadie nodding his head.</p>

<p>"Very handsome young lady Miss McIver," continued the
policeman.</p>

<p>"Very," said Mr. Eadie and then he sighed deeply, "but what a
pity it is some of us are getting too old; now isn't it,
constable?"</p>

<p>"A great pity, sir," replied the constable and with a smile,
he saluted again and walked on.</p>

<p>Mr. Eadie continued slowly on his way as if he were very deep
in thought but at the wire door of the White House he paused to
attentively regard it before he went in. Then to a secret
observer there his movements would certainly have appeared very
mysterious. One by one he went through the rooms of the house and
for a long minute he stood staring hard at every object they
contained. He scrutinised the fastenings of the windows too and
the floors as well came under his observation. It seemed as if he
wanted to make sure there had been no meddlers in the house
during his absence. Presently he seemed satisfied that everything
was exactly as he had left it and he turned back into the
dining-room in the front of the house.</p>

<p>Going to the side-board he mixed himself a strong whisky and
soda and sank back resignedly into a comfortable armchair. He
yawned heavily.</p>

<p>"Really," he muttered to himself, "life is getting quite
monotonous and I believe I'm getting fat."</p>

<p>He looked out through the window and then suddenly he frowned.
He rose quickly from his chair and took out a small pair of
binoculars from a drawer in the desk. He focussed them carefully
upon some object outside. For nearly five minutes then he never
moved. He just stood silently and patiently watching. At length
he put down the glasses, but even then without them he still
continued to stare.</p>

<p>"Now I wonder," he muttered, "I wonder why that window over
the garage is always open. The chauffeur has been away for more
than a week and the room must be untenanted. Now it must have
been noticed that the window had been left open; then why has no
one been up to close it?" He shook his head as if puzzled. "It's
not like the McIver girl; she's very particular."</p>

<p>He picked up the binoculars and proceeded to stare hard
again.</p>

<p><br>
The telephone bell rang sharply in the Chief Commissioner's
room. He was going through some papers with a subordinate. He
picked up the receiver.</p>

<p>"Chief speaking," he said, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Inspector Romilly to see you, sir, urgent he says," came the
voice over the 'phone.</p>

<p>"All right; tell him to come up."</p>

<p>A minute later and Inspector Romilly was in the room. The
Commissioner dismissed his attendant and waited until the latter
had closed the door behind him before he spoke.</p>

<p>"Well," he asked, "any news?"</p>

<p>The inspector looked white and troubled.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said quickly, "it would be best I think now to
arrest J. A. Cloud at once."</p>

<p>"Good," said the Commissioner. "I've been thinking that we've
waited long enough."</p>

<p>"It should be done at once, too, sir, straight away."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said the inspector, "he took two loaves this morning
instead of one."</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed the Commissioner brightening up, "he's
expecting visitors, is he? Then we mayn't have been waiting for
nothing, after all. But why this sudden change of plans, Romilly?
It was your obsession, remember, to get them all together and a
few hours more now won't add greatly to the risk."</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head. "He's restless, sir, and I
believe that he's become suspicious."</p>

<p>The Commissioner whistled. "What's happened then?" he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Nothing very much, sir, but for one thing he's not left the
house at all either yesterday or this morning, and, for another,
he's taken to watching the window over the garage in a way that I
don't like. He sits well back in his room and just stares through
his binoculars, literally for hours at a time. Fortunately for
us, the light's stronger on his place than ours and we have all
along, too, been watching through some holes in a screen."</p>

<p>"But haven't you any idea what's made him suspicious? Do you
think he can have possibly caught sight of any of you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I don't dream of that. The entrance to the garage is
at the back and no one has either come in or gone out unless we
have had J. A. Cloud in full view at the front at the time."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. "Well, what do you propose,"
sighed the Commissioner, "for my part I shan't be sorry when we
have this gentleman safely under lock and key&mdash;whether we
are lucky enough or not to get any of the others later on."</p>

<p>"If we get Cloud now, sir," replied the inspector confidently,
"and we can manage to keep news of the arrest quiet for a few
days, we may still get some of the others. If they are coming, it
can't be long now and with Cloud doubling his supply of bread, it
looks as if some of them at least were expected at once."</p>

<p>"All right," said the Commissioner after a pause, "but now
tell me, how are you going to set about arresting him?"</p>

<p><br>
Precisely at half past two that afternoon Inspector Mark
Romilly of the Adelaide Police might have been observed briskly
walking up the High Road of Glenelg in the direction of the
domicile of a Mr. Charles Eadie who resided in that quarter. The
inspector was looking, as he always looked, very spick and span,
but to-day he had assuredly got his best uniform on. He was the
last word in official splendour. His tunic fitted him like a
glove and the crease of his trousers was exactly and
mathematically in the middle. His white gloves were new and
spotless and the polish of his boots, too, left nothing to be
imagined.</p>

<p>He looked for all the world like a man about to take a
prominent position in some great and important guard of
honour.</p>

<p>He looked, too, so happy and content. He was smiling to
himself and a chance observer might have thought he was a lover.
His eyes were so bright and tender and the natural stern lines of
his face were so toned and softened by some pleasant
thoughts.</p>

<p>Suddenly an extremely pretty girl came tripping down a path
into the main road, and she and the dreamer met.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Mr. Inspector," smiled Miss McIver, for the
pretty girl was she, "are you coming up my way now?"</p>

<p>The inspector hesitated for perhaps the fraction of a second
and the girl thought he looked embarrassed. Then he replied
heartily enough. "Certainly I am if I may walk with you," and
taking assent for granted he immediately accommodated his steps
to hers.</p>

<p>"How do you like the heat, Miss McIver?" he went on with a
side-long admiring glance at her pretty oval face. "You don't
look as if it troubled you much."</p>

<p>"No, it always suits me," she replied. "I never feel so well
as when the temperature is well over a hundred in the shade."</p>

<p>"You're lucky," he sighed back, "ninety's quite good enough
for me. Our uniforms are not made for summer days."</p>

<p>For some minutes they chatted together and then, reaching the
entrance of Clyde House, the inspector held open the gate for her
to enter.</p>

<p>"But you're coming in?" she asked quickly, seeing that he
appeared to be about to turn away. "I thought you wanted to speak
to me. I can see you at once if you want to."</p>

<p>The inspector was undoubtedly embarrassed this time.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I may want to see you later," he replied evasively,
"but I have another call to make first."</p>

<p>The girl looked straight at him. "You're going to the White
House," she said quietly. "I knew you were directly I saw you a
few minutes ago." Then she smiled charmingly. "You men can never
hide anything, can you? But come in, please, I want to speak to
you."</p>

<p>The inspector pushed the gate to and resignedly followed her
into the garden.</p>

<p>"Miss McIver," he said solemnly, "if you're going to talk to
me, and I suppose I shall have to reply, will you please very
kindly turn your face so that anybody in the White House can't
see you? Our friend is always on the watch there with his
binoculars."</p>

<p>With no surprise she did as she was directed, but instantly
the pretty colour left her face and she looked white and ill at
ease.</p>

<p>"You're going to arrest him," she said with just the faintest
tremor in her voice. "You may as well be open with me. I shan't
cry or faint."</p>

<p>The inspector made no pretence of hiding his surprise. "How in
the name of fortune did you guess that?" he asked. "Great Scott,
if other people are as sharp as you, they'll be playing the Dead
March over me to-morrow for sure."</p>

<p>It was a foolish thing to say and he regretted it the moment
he had said it. He made to retrieve his mistake instantly. "No,
no," he added, "it won't, of course, be as bad as that, but what
I mean is&mdash;he won't perhaps take it quietly." Then, to
reassure her&mdash;"I've got an automatic with me anyhow."</p>

<p>But the girl was not to be so easily put off. She shook her
head gently. "Have you found out anything more about him?", she
asked. "Did he&mdash;did he&mdash;do you know for certain he came
here that night?"</p>

<p>The inspector looked intently at her. "Miss McIver," he said
very quietly, "that man over there was a murderer long ago, and
although we can't say for certain yet that he killed your poor
uncle, in all human certainty he did, for he has taken life
before&mdash;perhaps many times. I have found out all about him
now."</p>

<p>"And you are going to arrest him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he'll be in the cells in less than an hour."</p>

<p>"But you're going alone?"</p>

<p>"I have to." He shrugged his shoulders. "You see it is like
this. Our friend there has been wanted for many years, in the
United States, in India, and here these last two years in
Australia. Many people, lots of times, have tried to catch him,
but they've failed because they all frightened him somehow before
they came up. The man's supposed to have an extra sense that
tells him when danger is coming, but that's all rubbish, of
course. Well, I thought if I came up here by myself, alone, he
would never dream of danger and I might catch him before he got
his pistol ready. I tell you I was very hopeful about it, but I'm
not nearly so cock-sure now since you found me out. What made you
guess it?"</p>

<p>The girl smiled in spite of her paleness. She hesitated a
little before replying. "You looked&mdash;you looked so
particularly smart and spick and span that anyone would think you
had come for some special occasion. It made me search for the
reason at once."</p>

<p>The inspector frowned disgustedly. "Well, if I've overdone it,
it serves me right, but really&mdash;really the only thing
unusual about me is that I've got new white gloves." He smiled in
an amused sort of way at the girl. "I'm very sorry, however, that
I've let you in for it anyway. I'm afraid you'll be worried now
until it's all over; anyhow, it won't be long. I'll just go and
tap him on the shoulder now. You'll hear my whistle blow when
it's all right."</p>

<p>He saluted and was just turning round when a sudden thought
seemed to strike the girl. Her lips parted as if to speak, she
hesitated, and then blushed deeply. The warm rich colour
crimsoned over face and neck, and she looked the very picture of
sweet and adorable embarrassment.</p>

<p>Deliberately she turned herself full-face towards the White
House; then as deliberately, too, she plucked a small white rose
from the trellis near and daintily handed it to the astonished
inspector.</p>

<p>"There," she said, in a sweet low voice that trembled
slightly, "if he's looking at us now at any rate, he'll see
something to excuse your fine clothes. He'll think you came up to
see me and then&mdash;then&mdash;of course he'll understand."</p>

<p>Without another word, she turned up quickly towards the house.
Reaching the verandah door, she looked round for one brief second
to wave her hand and then immediately disappeared within. Her
face was still a flaming crimson.</p>

<p>The inspector, oblivious of the whole world watching, passed
his lips across the petals of the rose, and then, wrapping it
carefully in his handkerchief, placed it in his breast
pocket.</p>

<p>Sighing deeply he passed out of the garden and crossed over
the road.</p>

<p><br>
The servant Martin was writing a letter. He sat at the table
in the best room of the White House, puffing contentedly at a big
cigar with a strong whisky and soda by his side. He wrote in an
easy scholarly hand very different from the vile uneven scrawl
with which he generally pencilled receipts when goods were
brought up to the back door. The table was in front of the window
and from where he sat he had a good view out on to the trim
little garden and right across to the other houses facing the
sea. On the table near him there was a pair of excellent
binoculars and from time to time he swept them round casually to
take in all there was to be seen outside. He was evidently
interested in quite a methodical sort of way in all the
happenings of his little world.</p>

<p>He wrote with ease and facility.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">The White House</span>.<br>
Friday afternoon.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear Major Poole</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I am very sorry I shall not be able to accept
your kind invitation for to-morrow evening, but I have not been
feeling very well lately and under the circumstances think it
best to take things easy for a day or two. My confounded liver
plays me up directly I depart from the very simplest fare and I
know quite well what your 'little dinners' are. So I shall have
to rest content with the barley water and milk puddings that my
good Martin gives me and postpone the acceptance of your kind
hospitality until later times. By-the-bye, I am very glad you
were pleased with the manner in which Martin carried out his
duties the other night. He is certainly, as you say, a most
capable man but please, another time do not send him home with a
bottle of your brown sherry; he had no kick at all in him the
next day. Martin, like his master, is not as young as he used to
be and the simple life is best I am afraid for both of us old
fellows.</p>

<p class="letter">Again thanking you for your kind thought of me,
and with kindest regards.</p>

<p class="letter">Believe me, my dear Major Poole.</p>

<p class="letter">Very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Charles Eadie</span>.</p>

<p class="letter">P.S. I am sure....

<p><br>
But the post-script was never finished, for at that moment the
writer happened to look up through the open window and his hand
fell instantly upon the binoculars at his side.</p>

<p>"Well I'm damned, and what is it now?" he growled. "That nosey
inspector up here again and yarning with the pretty Maude. Why, I
wonder they allow him to waste his time so."</p>

<p>He put up the glasses and intently regarded the gossiping
pair. "The great bull calf," he ejaculated. "Now I'd like to know
what he's saying to her. He's got up in great style, too, to-day.
I suppose the idiot thinks he's in love, but I can't understand
the McIver girl encouraging him in the idea." He went on
sneeringly. "I'm really disappointed in you, Mr. Inspector
Romilly, D.S.O. Upon our first acquaintanceship I thought there
was more in you, and I candidly confess I was a little bit afraid
of you at the time. I didn't like the look of your eyes. I
thought you were a thinker; but you're not. You're just an
ordinary policeman, sir, and nothing else."</p>

<p>He watched for quite a long while. "Now, what are they talking
about? I wish to goodness she'd turn her face and I could tell at
once. When a woman thinks she's alone with a man, her face is an
open book to a third party who's watching on the quiet. Ah! now
she turns it and, by James, but what a blush! I'm astonished,
Maude, and I'm damned if the policeman isn't too. He looks like a
stuck calf. Great Jupiter&mdash;and she's plucking him a rose.
Really, Joseph, I think you ought to shut your eyes. This
courting's getting quite immodest. Oh! she's frightened now and
runs away and I don't wonder, too. Really, I thought I was some
judge of character, but I never dreamed the pretty Maude could
flirt like that. One thing to my credit anyhow, whatever else
I've done, I've brought two loving hearts together." He sneered
unpleasantly. "What a pretty little tableau it made to be
sure&mdash;so pretty that if I were a suspicious man now, I might
almost think it had been got up specially for my benefit. Dear
me&mdash;and now he's kissing the rose. Of course he would, and I
suppose she's watching, too, from behind the door. He wraps it in
his handkerchief&mdash;oh! how romantic&mdash;and now he sighs
and turns away. Curtain, curtain, it's all over. Very pretty and
I've quite enjoyed it. Hullo! hullo!&mdash;he's crossing the road
and coming up here! What does that mean? Perhaps if I offer him a
rose, he'll kiss that too now he's in the mood. But come, come
now, Martin, you forget yourself. Pull yourself together, sir,
and prepare to answer the door. Your master, Mr. Eadie, is out.
He's lunching with the Governor, he's buying socks and shoes, or
he's just gone to the Methodist Conference, whichever you think
best to say. Be polite, Martin&mdash;be respectful and then
perhaps if he's got it, he'll tip you another nice half-crown.
Ha! ha! But still&mdash;'semper paratus' is my little motto all
through life," and he took a pretty little automatic from a
drawer in the desk and seeing that it was loaded thrust it in his
trouser pocket. Then carefully extinguishing what remained of his
excellent cigar, he tiptoed into the hall and stealthily regarded
the approaching inspector through the obscurity of the wire
door.</p>

<p>His whole attitude had suddenly and strangely altered, for
with all his recent pleasantry he had now the exact pose and
bearing of a beast of prey.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE HEMPEN CORD</h2>

<p class="first">THE inspector came up the pathway walking
briskly. He looked solid and convincing as if it were his sole
mission in life to be just the ordinary uninteresting member of
the force. He appeared to be just a part of a machine, a
regulator of traffic, or at best a disturber of the peace of the
very minor offenders of the law. Not the man anyone would think
to be trusted with the handling of a great and important case. He
looked too heavy, altogether too much the embodiment of
stereotyped procedure and conventional ideas.</p>

<p>Martin, from the security of the fly-proof wire door, watched
the inspector critically and analytically every foot of the way.
He took in everything about him, but it was the expression of his
face he searched out most.</p>

<p>"All right," he told himself as the inspector reached the
door, "just the ordinary policeman here," and his right hand lost
its contact with the automatic in his pocket.</p>

<p>The inspector pushed the bell and then turned round and stood
waiting patiently with his back to the door. Apparently he was
deeply absorbed in a contemplation of the garden of Clyde House,
for Martin had to say "Yes, sir," twice before he seemed to
become aware of the fact.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," he exclaimed pleasantly, "but you
really move so quietly that I didn't hear you come. Now, is Mr.
Eadie at home by any chance?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the respectful Martin, "I'm sorry he is
not."</p>

<p>The inspector did not seem to be very disappointed.</p>

<p>"I hardly thought he would be," he went on, "but I looked in
on the chance. I suppose he's in most mornings, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, nearly always till about twelve, but if I tell him
you're coming I'm sure he'll remain in any time."</p>

<p>The inspector seemed thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't quite as particular as that. I want to ask him
something and I may call in and take my chance."</p>

<p>The conversation was taking place on the doorstep; at least,
the inspector was on the doorstep, while Martin was standing well
inside the door. The door was three parts open and both men were
interested in the distance between them&mdash;Martin because as a
matter of principle he never allowed a policeman at any time to
get too close to him, and the inspector because he was
calculating if he were near enough to rush in and take Martin by
surprise. He knew it must be a case of making sure for he had a
most wholesome respect for a one-time professor of ju-jitsu.</p>

<p>The inspector seemed in no hurry to go.</p>

<p>"You have a pretty lonely time here, Martin;" he suggested,
"you must find it very quiet, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I prefer it quiet, sir," and the man's eyes narrowed suddenly
and his hand slipped back into his trouser pocket.</p>

<p>"Have you been long with Mr. Eadie?" and the inspector now in
his turn became aware of some subtle and undefinable sense of
impending danger.</p>

<p>"Nearly twenty years, sir, come this next month."</p>

<p>"Well, it speaks jolly well for both of you," exclaimed the
inspector heartily, and he suddenly turned half round and bent
down to adjust a boot-lace that was apparently coming undone.</p>

<p>The man-servant's face relaxed to a half-smile.</p>

<p>Unthinking, of course, the inspector had placed himself in
absolutely the most defenceless position he could have assumed.
Martin thought instantly of quite a dozen unpleasant ways in
which he could have been finished off quietly and without the
slightest fuss or noise. The policeman was undoubtedly a fool.
There could be no danger here he told himself again, and the
little automatic slipped back as before to the bottom of his
pocket.</p>

<p>The inspector stood up and he was quite aware at once of the
change in the man's face. It was all right again. He had seen
danger a moment or two before and the quick falling back of the
right hand to the trouser pocket. So he had purposely turned
round and bent down to divert the man's suspicion, by his nakedly
defenceless position.</p>

<p>He stood up and straightened himself with a yawn. Then he took
a letter out of his pocket and appeared to be considering. Martin
continued to eye him narrowly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps after all," he said thoughtfully, "I'd better leave
this letter with you and your master can answer it by post. If
it's not all right I'll call again next time I am up here."</p>

<p>He held out the letter to the servant and the latter moved
just a little nearer to take it in his right hand. The door was
wide open now. In an instant the inspector crashed out with his
left hand and caught the man-servant square and full on the angle
of the jaw. The man saw the blow coming and his face flashed
lightning-like into an expression of bestial rage, but he was
just the very smallest fraction of a second too late to prevent
it and he went down like a stunned ox on to the floor.</p>

<p>The inspector leapt on to him to follow up the blow, but there
was no necessity&mdash;Martin was down and out and for the moment
oblivious to all that might be going on in the world.</p>

<p>"A foul blow, my friend," muttered the inspector grimly with
his face wet and pale with excitement, "but you won't grumble
much at that I'm sure. You're not one yourself to be over
particular at any time about the niceties of conflict, are you?
Now we'll just make sure and then for a little trussing up before
you get dangerous again." With hands that trembled slightly he
turned up the left-hand sleeve and exposed the unconscious man
fore-arm. Yes&mdash;there was the scar right enough It was
sufficient to clinch everything.</p>

<p>Producing some stout whipcord from his pocket he deftly and
securely bound Martin's limbs; then going out on to the verandah
he blew three shrill blasts upon his whistle.</p>

<p>Almost instantly three men appeared on the road and the hum of
a motor in the distance came up pleasantly to the inspector's
ears.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. "Good, everything going to schedule.
It's all right, Jackson," he called out as the three men came
running up. "Our luck's still in; he's waiting for the handcuffs
now, but I'm going to search him well."</p>

<p>Together they lifted up the still unconscious man on to the
sofa and thoroughly went through every part of his clothes. In
his right-hand pocket they at once came across the little
automatic and Inspector Romilly nodded grimly to his assistants.
"Yes, I nearly got a dose of that just now," he said; "it was
touch and go for a moment, but he thought better of it. Search
him thoroughly, for he's always boasted he'd never be taken
alive. It's a hundred to one he's got poison on him somewhere.
You know this chap's a medical man."</p>

<p>It was not long before they came across what they were looking
for. In his hip-pocket amongst other things they found a little
metal box and inside it, carefully packed in cotton-wool, two
fair-sized glass capsules.</p>

<p>"Prussic acid probably," said Detective Jackson, holding one
of them up to the light. "I was two years in a chemist's shop
before I entered the force, and a lot of Yankee stuff came over
from the States in capsules like this."</p>

<p>Leaving the now gradually recovering prisoner in charge of one
of their number&mdash;the other three men proceeded to go over
the house.</p>

<p>In the best bedroom was a large wardrobe and opening the door
the first things they came across were the wig and eyebrows of
Mr. Eadie. On the shelf above were the same gentleman's prominent
false teeth. His tinted eyeglasses were also close at hand and
indeed everything was so placed that it could be used at a
moment's notice. "Artful chap," commented Detective Jackson
again; "notice how beautifully creased all the trousers of Mr.
Eadie are, and here poor old Martin's been going about in baggy
clothes with no shape in them at all."</p>

<p>Presently the man left in charge called out that Martin had
recovered consciousness again, and the inspector went in to have
what he called a pleasant little talk.</p>

<p>The prisoner was leaning back in a big armchair. His wrists
were now handcuffed together in front of him but his legs were
still corded round at the ankles. He looked white and sickly, and
scowled menacingly for a second at the inspector when the latter
came and sat down just in front of him. But he made no remark and
a moment later his features were relaxed once again to the
expressionless composure of the servant Martin.</p>

<p>His captor made no attempt to gloat over him.</p>

<p>"Look here, my friend," he said quietly, "let's start clear.
It's my duty first to warn you that anything you say now may be
used in evidence against you." The detective looked almost
sympathetically at him. "Now don't take it over hard," he went
on, "that I got in first just now. You needn't kick yourself at
all about that, for we'd got you anyhow. We know all about you,
and you've been under observation for a great number of days.
Your life's an open book to us too. You were Mr. Eadie here, Mr.
Powell in Semaphore last year, you had perhaps a dozen aliases in
Sydney and Lahore, and in New York City you were born Joseph
Arthur Cloud."</p>

<p>"You've been jailed once, your finger prints are handy and
you've got the scar there on your left fore-arm from the bullet
in Lahore. So it's all cut and dried about you and you'll swing
for sure."</p>

<p>The prisoner made no movement and no response; he just stared
apathetically before him, as if of all present he were least
interested in what was going on. The inspector shrugged his
shoulders and continued.</p>

<p>"Not that the idea of swinging will, I think, worry you over
much. To a man of your temperament one way out of the world is as
good as another and I expect you must have always known it would
come one day to this. Your luck couldn't hold for ever. But it's
not to talk about your future that I'm here now. What I want is
this. You could do me a bit of a favour, and if you're a sport
you'll do it. No, don't pretend you're not curious to know what I
mean, for you must be. You must be darned curious also about a
great many other things, too, Dr. Cloud. That active brain of
yours must have been churning itself over a lot already in this
last ten minutes to guess out exactly how we got on your track
here."</p>

<p>Still no sign nor response from the handcuffed man. Just the
same dull, cold and expressionless stare into the empty spaces of
the room.</p>

<p>The speaker went on. "Look here, Doctor, nothing can make any
difference to you now and I want to do a deal. I'll send these
fellows out of the room though and then we can talk privately."
He signed to the detectives and without questioning they at once
left the room.</p>

<p>"Now it's a little bit less formal," said the inspector, when
the door was closed. "There are no witnesses and we shall neither
of us be giving ourselves away." He lowered his voice
impressively. "What I want to do is this&mdash;let's swap
information. I'll tell you everything how we came to find you
out, and how just by chance we got upon your track. Just by
chance mind you; no discredit to your cleverness there. It was
blind chance that led us where we are."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment to let his words sink in. The man was
watching him intently now and there was undeniably a glint of
interest in his eyes. His lips were still shut tight, however,
and no response came.</p>

<p>The inspector's voice became more persuasive. "You'll still go
down to history as perhaps the deepest schemer crime has ever
known. You weren't nabbed because of any false move you made
yourself, but just because of one chance word, uttered once at
night months ago in a lonely place. One word, uttered only once,
but remembered long afterwards; and it was just sufficient to
fire the train."</p>

<p>Again he paused and this time his silence was longer than
before. He knew quite well what he was doing and was not
mistaking his man. He had not been a student of crime for
nothing. Great criminals, he was quite aware, are nearly always
vain and in the world of crime their reputations are every whit
as dear to them as are the reputations of great personages in
other walks of life. Punishment too may have few terrors for
them, but ridicule&mdash;ridicule always tells. Hardened to every
hatred of the community upon which they prey, they are
nevertheless peculiarly sensitive to what they believe their
fellow criminals may think of them. It galls them to the quick if
it should appear they have been bested fairly by their natural
enemies, the despised and usually dull-witted police.</p>

<p>Now that the first shock of his arrest was over, the man known
to his associates as the Smiter was recovering something of the
contemptuous indifference that the habitual criminal has always
for whatsoever may be in store for him. Like all his kind he was
prepared to accept his defeat with tranquillity and just to
regard it as an unkind throw of Fate that could not have been
foreseen or prevented.</p>

<p>He was curious, too, and quite interested in what the
inspector was saying, but at the same time he was in no sort of
mood to oblige anyone in any way.</p>

<p>The inspector realised he had a difficult task before him. He
was putting up a great bluff and with an already excellent hand
to play, purposed discarding a few useless cards, hoping to draw
some of good value in their stead.</p>

<p>Despite his good fortune in having discovered and arrested a
malefactor of the importance of the Smiter, he was only too well
aware that so far he had got no evidence whatever to connect him
with the murder of Andy McIver. That he had done it was in every
way a moral certainty, but proofs so far there were none and
apart from an actual confession from the man himself&mdash;which
he knew was highly improbable&mdash;the only way of bringing it
home to him was by the actual discovery of the stolen bank-notes
themselves somewhere on the premises. But a comparatively small
number of bank-notes were of the easiest things to hide; even in
a small house there were a hundred places where they could be
secreted and, perhaps, never found. Besides, there was no knowing
that they were in the house at all. They might easily have been
hidden somewhere outside; buried in the sand, perhaps, or tucked
maybe in the hollow of some tree quite half a mile away.
Altogether, therefore, unless the man in front of him were
willing, it would be only by a miracle of chance that they could
be brought to light to finally convict him.</p>

<p>The inspector went on with his conversation in quite a casual
sort of way.</p>

<p>"But, of course, you couldn't possibly have known we were
shadowing you, and yet&mdash;and yet," he lowered his voice here
and bent forward confidentially, "if you had once suspected it,
you would have easily found out immediately. You remember when
you were lying on the bed there, watching on the verandah, those
three nights. The first night before the races, the next night
when you went over to kill that poor old man, and again the third
night, the night after, when you saw us going over the ground to
re-construct the crime. Well, did you never notice on any of the
next mornings that the sand had been disturbed over there under
the clump of trees? We knew you were in the habit of going there
to get sticks for your fire. Did you never notice anything."</p>

<p>The Smiter broke silence at last. "I'm not blind," he sneered
disdainfully, "but there happened to be sheep about as well as
policemen, and I thought it was sheep. I didn't blunder
there."</p>

<p>"But I suppose you think we blundered," broke in the inspector
sharply, secretly however very much elated that he had at last
got the man to speak, "because we didn't arrest you at once." He
went on, shaking his head emphatically. "No, we didn't blunder,
my friend, although if we had known you were going into Clyde
House to murder as well as steal we should, of course, have taken
you at once. We were waiting for you to communicate with some of
your pals. We wanted Andrew and Burke and Masterton. We hoped at
least one of them would turn up here."</p>

<p>"Well, you were disappointed," sneered the Smiter.</p>

<p>The inspector tried to look down in the mouth. "Yes&mdash;of
course we were, but still," brightening up a bit, "at any rate
we've got the best card in the pack, and I suppose we'll have to
be content with that now. But see here, Doctor, I'll just tell
you how it is we happened to get on your track. Now you listen
carefully and you'll see what chance has done."</p>

<p>The Smiter looked scornfully at the speaker, but the latter
was taking no rebuffs. He went on quite cheerfully, almost as if
he were speaking to a friend.</p>

<p>"One Saturday evening in the summer of last year&mdash;to be
exact on January 11th, a young fellow from Sydney strayed by
chance to the bungalow you had then near Semaphore. There were
the four of you there at the time, and one of you caught him
looking through the shutters. You dragged him into that long room
of yours, and you asked him a lot of questions. Then you had him
shut up in the woodshed, but he got out and you all caught him
again and threw him in the sea."</p>

<p>"I shot him first," calmly interrupted the Smiter.</p>

<p>"No, Doctor, you didn't&mdash;you may have thought you
did."</p>

<p>"I shot him in the forehead," said the Smiter.</p>

<p>The inspector shrugged his shoulders incredulously.</p>

<p>"Well, it evidently didn't do him much harm," he replied, "for
he was able to get out of the sea at Henley and walk all the way
to Adelaide before he fell insensible in the road, just near the
railway station on North Terrace. No, your bullet didn't touch
him and his head was all bloody only because he cut it against
the fence as he fell. Anyhow he wrote us a long letter about you
a little while back, remembering everything, even some of the
extraordinary questions you in particular asked him. He says for
example that you asked him the names of the arteries of the
neck."</p>

<p>The Smiter looked thoughtful for a moment and then his face
broke into a cold but rather amused smile.</p>

<p>"I suppose you must be right then," he said unconcernedly,
"but I certainly believed at the time that he was dead." He shook
his head frowningly. "Yes, it was a blunder that, but at any rate
we all shared in it! I'm not completely surprised though, for
several times I have thought vaguely that he seemed to fall
almost before my bullet could have reached him. He was just
jumping the fence."</p>

<p>"Yes, the fence at the bottom of the lawn," said the
inspector. "We noticed that particularly and also the panels of
the woodshed that he smashed in when he broke down the door."</p>

<p>"Dear me, dear me," smiled Joseph Arthur Cloud sarcastically,
but now apparently in a much better humour, "you've gone over the
ground well. For a policeman you appear to have been most
thorough in your investigations, although you haven't told me yet
where I came in. How you linked up all this with me, I mean."</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly smiled back at his handcuffed prisoner.
"Well, you're pretty cool, aren't you?" he replied admiringly.
"You take everything as if nothing worried you. I'll tell you how
it happened that we knew it was you. This young fellow heard
someone refer to one of your friends who was doing seven years.
Rook they called him. We made inquiries at once to find out who
this Rook doing seven years was, who his friends were and what
they were like. In forty-eight hours we were upon your track.
There was no Rook doing seven years, but there was a Charles
Henry Bird in for that term. His pals called him Rook, and his
pals were you, Andrew, Masterton, and Burke. Larose, the Sydney
detective, sent us most exhaustive descriptions of you all
and&mdash;there we were."</p>

<p>"A very capable officer, Larose," remarked the Smiter
judicially. "A genius in his way. I dreaded him more than any of
the others there. We had to keep him shadowed always to know what
he was doing. But how did you trace me to here? You haven't told
me that yet."</p>

<p>"Smiter," replied the inspector solemnly, "it's a bad error
for a man of your sagacity if he wants to hide his tracks to move
directly from one house into another on the self-same
day&mdash;and such a little distance apart too. Say, less than a
dozen miles as the crow flies. A man leaves one house on the 4th
of March. He doesn't go far away for he does his own removal.
[The inspector was guessing here, but he felt on sure ground].
Later on he's badly wanted. Well then&mdash;who's taken up a new
tenancy in the neighbourhood on March the 4th? Quite easy you
see&mdash;with any little bit of luck, which we had."</p>

<p>There was quite a long silence, and then the Smiter said very
quietly, "I mistook you for an ass the other night at Major
Poole's."</p>

<p>"And I was quite sincere when I told you then you were an
artist, Martin."</p>

<p>"What the major said at dinner nearly made me quit that night,
right off there and then. I got scared badly for the moment, and
was on the point of giving you a dose of something in your
coffee&mdash;one of those nice little capsules that you've just
stolen from me now. But you half convinced me by your bluff about
the McIver girl, and when you tipped me that half-crown&mdash;
like an ass myself I felt quite safe again."</p>

<p>The inspector thought the propitious moment had a last
arrived.</p>

<p>"What have you done with those notes, Doctor?" he said
quietly; "the McIver notes I mean. You may as well tell me. It
will save a deuce of a lot of trouble in looking for them if you
do and it will be a great feather in my cap as well."</p>

<p>"Why, pray, should I save you any trouble?" asked the Smiter
contemptuously&mdash;then he broke into a dry laugh. "You amuse
me, though, for it's certainly the very first occasion upon which
the police have ever invoked my aid."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to have amused you anyhow," remarked the
inspector, "but&mdash;it would be a decent thing to do."</p>

<p>The Smiter sighed for the first time. "I'm not particularly
keen about those notes anyhow," he said sadly. "I don't suppose I
shall ever spend any of them now, so you may just as well have
them. But tell me first," and his eyes half shut and his voice
hardened vengefully, "out there in the garden just now&mdash;were
you and the girl both fooling me and putting up a show, or was it
all real and you're just sweet on each other as some idiots
are?"</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly drew back instantly almost as if he had
received a blow. Anxious as he was to propitiate the prisoner, he
frowned angrily. He knew quite what was running through the
Smiter's brain. The man's self-love was wounded because he was
doubtful whether or not he had been taken in. If he were once
certain of it then it was good-bye for ever to his good offices
in the recovery of the notes. But, on the other hand, how was it
possible to admit to this wretch anything so sacred as being in
love with Maude McIver&mdash;let alone pretend that she was in
love too. He was in a quandary.</p>

<p>The spiteful voice of the Smiter broke through his
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Give me that rose," he sneered very softly, "the white rose
that you wrapped in the handkerchief in your pocket."</p>

<p>The inspector blazed into fury all at once. "No, I am damned
if I will," he replied without the fraction of a second's
hesitation at all. "I'll lose anything rather than that."</p>

<p>"Good man, good lover," laughed the Smiter, still, however,
with a sneer. "I needn't press you further. Your face gives you
away. You shall have the notes all right now. But you shouldn't
have had them through me if you had given up the rose." He nodded
his head complacently, but went on still sneering. "I thought I
couldn't be mistaken there. Maude's face was just the very
ordinary picture of a girl in love." He glanced towards his
binoculars on the table and laughed sarcastically. "Very good
glasses those. I could even see the blush going down below her
neck. Well, you want those notes, eh?"</p>

<p>The inspector choked back his indignation. After all, he
thought, it was all a game&mdash;a game of wits between them, and
he need not grudge this poor devil opposite any small pleasure
that he might derive from thinking himself more clever than he
really was. So he just said smilingly, "Yes, where are they
now?"</p>

<p>"I must have a drink first," replied the Smiter, "and one of
the best of my cigars. The whisky from the tantalus, please.
There're some glasses over there, too."</p>

<p>The inspector moved over to the sideboard to do as he was
requested, but there was something in the man's voice that made
him pause. Pretending to hold up a tumbler to the light to see if
it were clean, he shot a lightning glance in the direction of the
Smiter. The man looked strangely eager, with a strained
expression on his face, as if he were fighting down some great
and terrible excitement. The inspector was worried all at once.
"What the devil is he up to now?" he muttered to himself. "He's
got something on for sure and it's more than the idea of just
having a drink."</p>

<p>He took two glasses to put on the table and then noticed for
the first time that there was a bottle of whisky on the sideboard
as well as the whisky in the tantalus. The bottle was open, but
nearly full and looked as if two drinks at most had been taken
from it. "That's funny," he thought; "why was a new bottle opened
when the tantalus was still a quarter full?" He became suspicious
at once. The Smiter was a doctor of medicine he knew, and poison
was always possible as an auxiliary in that strange life of his.
What if the whisky in the tantalus had been doctored and left
handy in case at any time there might come a tight corner like
this?</p>

<p>It was quite possible and would account at once for the
eagerness of the Smiter to get hold of it.</p>

<p>Convinced there was a mystery somewhere, he pushed the two
glasses forward on to the table and then before any protest could
be made he quickly seized the bottle of whisky and poured out the
two drinks.</p>

<p>The Smiter sighed a long deep sigh, a sigh perhaps of
disappointment, perhaps of simple resignation to the fate that he
was sure must now be his. Who knows?</p>

<p>"What made you become a policeman?" he asked suddenly. The
inspector laughed. He felt quite happy again, and judged from the
dejected mien of his prisoner that whatever danger had just
threatened it had at all events now passed away.</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied lightly, "I became a policeman for the same
reason probably that you became a criminal&mdash;for the sake of
adventure."</p>

<p>"Bah," sneered the Smiter contemptuously, "the adventure of
chasing stray dogs and running in drunks. Fine life of adventure
that."</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;but we get higher game sometimes. Doctors of
medicine for instance, and great artists in crime. But, come now,
where are those notes?"</p>

<p>The Smiter seemed quite surprised. "The notes," he exclaimed
as if puzzled. "Well, where would you expect to find them? Where
does a gentleman generally keep his notes? Where would Mr.
Charles Eadie keep his? Where, but in his desk, of course."</p>

<p>The inspector looked incredulous. "What do you mean?" he asked
with a frown.</p>

<p>"What I say. They're in the desk, second drawer, left hand
side. You seem surprised. No, it isn't locked. You'll find them
quite easily. As a matter of fact, I was counting them myself not
half an hour ago. Yes&mdash;you've got them all there and I
should help myself to a few if I were you. They don't pay you too
well in the police, do they? But don't touch one of those
five-fifties, whatever you do. They're quite new notes and the
totalisator people evidently got them straight from the bank so
their numbers are known of course."</p>

<p>He leant back and chuckled sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Really, I've quite enjoyed this little half-hour. It's been
quite as good as a play. The clever inspector tactfully
extracting information from the stupid man of crime."</p>

<p>He laughed immoderately. "But what a sell for you, Mr.
Inspector. You would have found the notes in the first place in
which you looked for them and here you've been wasting all this
precious time confiding in me unnecessarily, and paying me pretty
compliments to get me in a good humour. I tell you, however, the
compliments have quite pleased me all the same."</p>

<p>The inspector looked rather sheepish. He was busy going
through the notes that he had found laid out in the drawer.</p>

<p>"But of course," went on the Smiter rather sadly, "I must say
your luck was in all round this time. I wasn't expecting any
visitors to-day, and I don't mind telling you the notes have
never been in the house at all before this afternoon. They were
hidden before where you would have never found them. But come on,
let's have that cigar you promised."</p>

<p>The inspector smiled good-humouredly in spite of the little
annoyance that he felt.</p>

<p>"All right, Doctor, just one moment and you shall have your
cigar. Then we must be going."</p>

<p>"One thing more," said the Smiter, "there's that diamond ring
I took too. I'm afraid I can't give you the ring because I've
thrown it away, but there's the diamond inside the piece of putty
in the tool box. I shouldn't give that up if I were you. Keep it
for yourself, man." He chuckled amusedly. "You may be glad of it
some day; it would look very fine for instance in an engagement
ring."</p>

<p>The inspector scowled.</p>

<p>Five minutes later and the Smiter was being escorted between
two detectives to the waiting car. He stopped suddenly on the
garden path and stood sniffing at the air.</p>

<p>"Don't hurry me," he said sharply. "I'm taking my last smell
of the sea. Good old sea," he exclaimed sadly, "how full of peace
you look to-day. There are not many things I shall be sorry to
leave, but at any rate you're one. I shan't be seeing you again.
Good-bye. Goodbye." He ended with a choke in his voice, but he
recovered himself quickly. "Oh, by-the-bye, you men," he said
pleasantly, "don't be too thirsty with that whisky in the
tantalus there." He nodded his head meaningly. "Cyanide of
potassium's not good for the health, you know."</p>

<p>Very quickly the car moved away.</p>

<p><br>Truly an eventful day for all concerned. A day of strange
happenings, and, surely, one not the least strange&mdash;Maude
McIver knew at last she was in love.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. &mdash; SONS OF THE JAIL</h2>

<p class="first">THE following evening, just towards dusk, three
men alighted from the train at Glenelg. They walked out of the
station together and then stood quietly chatting for a moment in
the road.</p>

<p>"Well, so long," said one of them at length. "I'll follow you
in ten minutes." He took out his watch. "Yes, in ten minutes to
the tick," and he walked abruptly away up the street.</p>

<p>One of the other men grinned. "Andy's a devil for system," he
remarked. "I'll bet he's not ten seconds out," and they turned
off at once in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"First on the right," went on the man who had just spoken,
"second on the left and then straight on for about half a mile.
Small white house with willow tree in front garden. Right
opposite large mansion surrounded by red brick wall. Walk
straight in." He spoke in a monotone as if he were reciting some
instructions that he had learnt by heart.</p>

<p>For some minutes then there was silence. It seemed as if they
were both oppressed by the importance of something that was about
to happen. Then one of them spoke; he was the smaller and much
more smartly attired of the two.</p>

<p>"Really, I shall be glad to see his old phiz again; it seems
ages, instead of little more than a year, since we last saw
him."</p>

<p>"Oh! he's all right," growled the other, "if he'd only cut out
his bad temper, his rages&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you smell those sandhills, Burke?" suddenly interrupted
the first speaker in great excitement; he dropped his voice to a
whisper. "What do they remind you of now&mdash;don't you
remember?"</p>

<p>His companion swore angrily. "Damn you, Phil, you're always on
the jump about something. What the devil is it this time?"</p>

<p>"The smell of this sand here&mdash;doesn't it call up anything
to you?"</p>

<p>The other looked round irritably. "No," he replied curtly,
"it's just ordinary sand to me, that's all."</p>

<p>But the man he had called Phil, had stopped walking in his
excitement.</p>

<p>"Lord," he exclaimed, "and the whole place is exactly like it,
too. Why, Burke, these sandhills are the very like of those round
that bungalow the Smiter had at Semaphore, and by cripes as we
walk here it's just as we were walking that very night when we
were spied on by that fellow. You know, the young chap we shot
and threw into the sea," he stared nervously round. "I tell you,
man, this road calls up everything to me&mdash;the night just
coming on, the smell of the hot sands, and you and I just going
to meet the Smiter." The speaker's voice began to quaver. "By
hell, Burke, I don't like it; it's an evil omen, we must turn
back."</p>

<p>But his companion gripped him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Come on, you fool. You're like a baby with your ideas. What
does it matter if that night was like this? It was the same time
of year, wasn't it, and the coasts are all the same about
here."</p>

<p>"But I don't like it, Burke," reiterated the other, and he
shook his head. "I'm sure it means danger to us again."</p>

<p>The big man's eyes began to glint angrily. "Come on, Phil," he
said menacingly, "and come on quickly too. If you don't I'll
break your arm."</p>

<p>The threat was evidently effective for their walking was at
once resumed, and in a few moments it seemed that the smaller man
had recovered from his nervousness, for he suddenly commenced to
laugh softly to himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am a fool, Burke," he said, "but still I'm sensitive
to things that you're not, and I notice a good deal more than you
ever do." He stretched out and pointed with his finger. "Look,
there is the little white house and opposite to it is the
red-brick wall." He drew in his breath suddenly with a sharp intake.
"Lord, look at that big house now," he exclaimed excitedly, "the
one surrounded by the big wall."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" snarled his companion. "You're like a
shickered fool to-night."</p>

<p>"But don't you recognise it&mdash;haven't you seen it
before&mdash;the picture of it, I mean, in the
newspapers?"&mdash;his voice dropped to an awe-struck whisper.
"It's Clyde House where that old man was strangled in Glenelg
about a month ago."</p>

<p>"Damnation," said the tall man, his interest precipitated at
last, "and the Smiter living just opposite." He spat on the
ground. "What a nerve!"</p>

<p>"He did it, of course," added the other. "We said at the time
it looked like his work."</p>

<p>"Yes, he did it sure, but why&mdash;&mdash;" the tall man was
thinking hard, "why the hell did he start working so near
home?"</p>

<p>They had stopped walking and were standing both quite still.
Darkness was falling quickly and they stared with something like
consternation on their faces into the shadows up the road. The
tall man was the first to recover.</p>

<p>"Well anyhow," he said brusquely, "it doesn't matter to us at
all. The Smiter was all right a couple of days ago and if he
survived up to then&mdash;I guess he's all right now. Come on,
we'll soon see, but we'll walk by first, to make sure."</p>

<p>They drew level quickly with the White House. A light was
burning somewhere within and there was a light also on the
outside verandah. They reached the garden gate and were making to
pass by when suddenly the tall man whispered exultingly.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Phil. I told you so. Look, there's his
binoculars on the table there and a box of his cigars. I know
that damned blue label well. The old boy's been having visitors,
too, by the look of it. Trust the Smiter to do himself well."</p>

<p>The light shone squarely on the verandah table and there was
certainly every appearance that several people had been enjoying
themselves that afternoon. There were three or four empty
glasses, a bottle of whisky, two syphons of soda water and a
plate of biscuits. Also several chairs were bunched close round
the table.</p>

<p>But the small man shook his head and wanted to hang back.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't like it, Burke," he whispered, "it looks a plant
to me. The Smiter's much too tidy to go in and leave things about
like that; besides he wouldn't have left the light on. It's not
his way to waste anything&mdash;ever."</p>

<p>"Oh, you fool!" was the quick rejoinder. "You'll drive me
crazy with your idiotic ideas." The voice turned into a jeer.
"I'm going in anyhow and I'll tell the Smiter you were afraid,"
and without more ado the tall man noisily pushed open the gate
and proceeded to walk briskly up the garden path. A moment's
hesitation and, with a shrug of resignation, his companion
followed.</p>

<p>"Walk straight in," jocularly remarked the tall man and he
pulled open the wire door. "Good luck to it," he went on with
gusto, "I smell cooking."</p>

<p>"Oh, Burke," almost wailed the little man, "I smell
policemen&mdash;the smell of their clothes, I'm sure."</p>

<p>The lounge hall was in darkness but at the far end there was
light from an open door. A sound of rattling plates and dishes
came from the back of the house.</p>

<p>"Supper," remarked the tall man gleefully, "and a bottle of
nice cool beer,"&mdash;he walked boldly forward.</p>

<p>A sudden click, the hall was flooded with bright light and big
burly men sprang out from every doorway. There was an oath from
Nathaniel Burke, a shrill cry from Phillip Masterton and
immediately they were overwhelmed and the handcuffs were clapped
on.</p>

<p>There was no struggling on the part of either of
them&mdash;everything was too sudden. They were blinded by the
light and blinked owlishly at their captors.</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen," said Inspector Romilly who had
appeared briskly from somewhere near the kitchen door. "You don't
know us, but we've been expecting you." He eyed the prisoners
with delighted interest. "Ah! Mr. Burke, I believe, and Mr.
Masterton, too. Nathaniel and Philip your Christian names. We're
members of the South Australian Police."</p>

<p>"Blast you," was the only comment of Nathaniel Burke.</p>

<p>"No doubt," said the inspector drily and he turned to two men
who had just come off the verandah into the hall.</p>

<p>"All right," he asked, "they came quite alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the reply, "we picked them up at the end of
the road and there was no one else with them. We watched them all
along."</p>

<p>Burke looked at the clock in the hall. It wanted seventeen
minutes to eight.</p>

<p>"Search them," said the inspector, "and do it thoroughly now.
Mind, they are not ordinary men."</p>

<p>But the search revealed nothing of much interest except that
Burke was carrying an automatic in his hip pocket and they each
had a return half of a ticket to the city.</p>

<p>"Where have you been putting up?" asked the inspector sharply;
"it's no good attempting now to hide anything; it'll all come
out."</p>

<p>Burke flashed a covert glance at his companion and his lips
curled into a sneer.</p>

<p>"You've got the wrong end of the stick this time, Mr.
Policeman," he said coolly; "we don't know what you mean. We're
respectable people and we've got nothing to hide."</p>

<p>"Nothing to hide?" said the inspector drily; "what about this
automatic for instance?"</p>

<p>"What does that prove?" said Burke, beginning to bluster,
"because a man's got a pistol, does that prove he's anybody you
try to make out?"</p>

<p>The inspector eyed him sardonically. "You're a fool, man, to
try to bluff us now," he said, "and it's only wasting time.
You're Burke right enough, and you've been wanted for years."</p>

<p>The prisoner again looked up at the clock; it was fourteen
minutes to eight. He smiled almost amiably at the inspector.</p>

<p>"Who is it you say I am?"</p>

<p>But the inspector did not deign to reply; and he turned to the
other man.</p>

<p>"You're Masterton," he said sternly, "and your sense will tell
you that the game's up. You've nothing to gain by lying for
you'll both be identified from Sydney within forty-eight hours."
His voice took on quite a friendly tone, "Now tell us where
you've been stopping in the city."</p>

<p>The tall man interrupted violently. "Don't say a word,
Marmaduke," he cried, "let them find out for themselves. You can
explain to them of course that you're in training for the
ministry and are a most refined and good young man; that's quite
all right."</p>

<p>The inspector turned sharply on the speaker. He sensed
suddenly that the man was fooling for some reason and he wanted
to fathom what was going on.</p>

<p>Burke glared at him defiantly. "Look away, Mr. Nosey
policeman. Stare at me as long as you like. Where d'you think
you've seen me before? Was it at the chapel the other night?"</p>

<p>The inspector eyed him contemptuously. "Pick him up," he said
sternly; "we won't waste any more time."</p>

<p>But Burke appeared suddenly to have become faint. "Give us a
drink of water, please," he said hoarsely; "you hurt me when you
pushed me down."</p>

<p>The inspector made a sign to one of the detectives and a glass
of water was brought to the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Steady on," said Burke, "I can't drink too fast; let me hold
it myself."</p>

<p>There was a minute's silence and he sipped the water slowly as
if it were some delicious wine; then covertly, he looked again at
the clock. It wanted exactly seven minutes to eight.</p>

<p>"Damn," he swore explosively and his voice rose instantly to a
loud shout; "the police are you? Damn all the police, I
say.&mdash;The police, the police, you'll jail us will you, you
damned police, you'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The inspector darted forward suddenly; he understood
everything now.</p>

<p>"Stop him," he cried, "stop him; he's shouting to put someone
wise. Quick, quick, there'll be another of them outside."</p>

<p>Three of the detectives sprang simultaneously to the door but
quick as they were there was one quicker. Burke literally leapt
from the chair where he had been placed and flung himself
hand-cuffed as he was upon the floor before the door. He clung
viciously to the post, kicking and yelling the whole time, and,
outnumbered though he was, it was a full minute before he could
be pulled away. Then it was found that the door had become jammed
in the struggling and another minute slipped by before it could
be finally wrenched open.</p>

<p>The detectives tore down the garden path. A woman and two
little boys were standing open-mouthed by the gate. They had
stopped in passing, interested to know what all the shouting was
about.</p>

<p>"Seen anyone about here," cried one of the detectives, "just
before we came out?"</p>

<p>"There was a man in front of us," said the woman; "he was just
inside the gate but he came out again when he heard the shouting
and he didn't wait."</p>

<p>"Which way did he go?", asked the inspector who had followed
his men down to the gate; "we're police officers and we want him,
quick."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the woman hesitatingly; "I was watching
the house."</p>

<p>The detectives looked round up and down the road and in every
direction but to their chagrin the whole place was quite deserted
and there was no one anywhere in sight. They had no idea which
way to run.</p>

<p>"Never mind," quickly said the inspector, "we may get him yet.
He should be Andrew, the garrotter, the last of the gang. He's of
medium size, good-looking and with dark eyes, and now he's scared
he'll almost certainly double back the same way he came. He has
no reason to believe we know anything about him, but it's an even
chance he came out with these other two from the city and, if so,
they of course all took their tickets at the same time. We've got
the return halves of those men inside, and the number of his
ticket therefore will be either one after or one before
theirs."</p>

<p>They raced back into the house and the inspector hurriedly
sorted out the two railway tickets from the prisoner's
belongings.</p>

<p>"Second class to Adelaide," he said; "numbers 7423 and 7424,
therefore the man we want will have either 7422 or 7425. Get on
the telephone quick for everyone to be examined at the barriers.
It looks a good thing to me."</p>

<p>Two of the detectives instantly went off and the inspector
turned his attention again to the prisoners. Burke had got a
nasty cut on his forehead in the scrimmage and a policeman was
now rendering him first aid.</p>

<p>"So, so, my friend," said the inspector not unkindly; "you
certainly scored one against us there, but I'm afraid it's the
last trick you'll ever take." His face broke into a pleasant
smile. "But you're a brave man, Burke, and you stick by your
pals;" he turned to one of the detectives; "give him a whisky and
soda, and make it a stiff one too."</p>

<p>Burke took down the spirit with evident relish and the
inspector went on talking.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you'll admit you're Burke now; you're Burke,
that's Masterton and the gentleman who's just given us the slip
is another wanted friend Mr. Andrew."</p>

<p>Burke smiled amiably; the whisky had not been without its
effect. "You'll never catch Andrew," he remarked, "now he's once
got away."</p>

<p>"Don't be too certain," said the inspector, "you heard about
those tickets just now."</p>

<p>"Pooh!", laughed Burke contemptuously, "Andy's a thinker and
he's not a mug like that. He'll tot up every chance you've got
against him and our tickets will come into his mind first. Ah!
you don't know Andy, he's got a brain like&mdash;&mdash;" he
stopped himself suddenly, "like someone else I know."</p>

<p>"Like the Smiter's for instance," suggested the inspector
gently. "I noticed you looked round so I expect he's in your
mind."</p>

<p>"What have you to do with the Smiter?" asked Burke
roughly.</p>

<p>"Oh nothing much," replied the inspector, "except that I
interviewed him in this very hall yesterday."</p>

<p>Burke stared hard at the inspector.</p>

<p>"How did you come to get on this job here?"</p>

<p>The inspector smiled most affably. "Well, if I explain that to
you," he said lightly, "you'll have to explain some things to me
too."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, Burke," suddenly interrupted Phillip
Masterton; "can't you see he's trying to pump you dry?"</p>

<p>Burke scowled at his companion. "No fear," he growled, "I
wasn't going to give anything away." He turned back to the
inspector and for a few moments eyed him intently as if he were
considering carefully what he was going to say. "Look here, Mr.
Policeman," he burst out at length. "I'll answer no questions,
understand,"&mdash;the inspector shrugged his shoulders
indifferently&mdash;"but I tell you what I'll do; give me another
drop of whisky and I'll be a sport and put you wise to something;
it'll be a good thing for you to know. Come on now, it'll be well
worth your while."</p>

<p>The inspector smiled. "Pass over another spot, Jackson, but
not quite such a big one this time. Now, what is it you've got to
tell me?"</p>

<p>Burke drank up the whisky before he spoke.</p>

<p>"It's about Andrew," he said grinning. "You've knocked up
against something hot there and I tell you flat I'll be sorry for
anyone who stands out too conspicuous in this business." His
voice dropped to a warning tone. "If it comes out now that we've
got to thank anyone in particular for getting lagged here, then
let that blighter keep an eye out for Master Andrew. Oh! you
needn't laugh any of you&mdash;it's dead truth I'm speaking now."
His voice rose again in its earnestness. "Andy's not an ordinary
man by a long chalk, I tell you. He takes things that most folks
leave alone and when he's got the dope in him there's nothing on
earth he won't do. He's like a weasel on a trail then." Burke
gritted his teeth together; "and he's as bloody and revengeful as
a stoat. Andrew, the garrotter, you call
him&mdash;well&mdash;he's well named, that's all."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the inspector thoughtfully, "I'll bear in
mind what you say."</p>

<p><br>
Burke proved a true prophet when he said that Andrew would get
away. He had vanished as if he had never existed and although the
authorities were certain that within twenty-four hours of his
supposed escape they had combed all possible parts of South
Australia, not a trail or a trace of him could be found anywhere.
Indeed so negative were the results of all investigations that
many shrewd and responsible people were not wanting who were of
opinion that he had never been in the State at all. They put down
everything to the natural suspicion of the official police mind
and considered all broadcasting of the absentee's description as
pure waste of time.</p>

<p>Three days later the prisoners were all brought into Court
together and an application was heard from New South Wales for
their extradition to that State. The application was granted in
the cases of Burke and Masterton, but refused in that of J. A.
Cloud, the latter being committed instead to take his trial in
Adelaide for the murder of McIver at Glenelg.</p>

<p>The three prisoners had nodded in a friendly manner to one
another when they had appeared together in the dock and the
Smiter had listened with a quiet inscrutable smile to the details
of how his two companions had been trapped in the White
House.</p>

<p>An intensely dramatic moment occurred, however towards the end
of the proceedings, when the presiding magistrate referred
specifically and in most laudatory terms to the parts played by
Inspector Romilly and Detectives Jackson, Frognal and Hart in
effecting the arrests. The prisoner Burke sprang suddenly to the
edge of the dock and, refusing to be silenced, shouted that the
four officers would now be marked men. He would not give a bean
now, he thundered, for the security of their lives and he
prophesied that within a few weeks, at most, they would all fall
under the vengeance of the still-at-large garrotter, Andrew. A
great stir was occasioned in the Court and some minutes elapsed
before the interrupter could be silenced and dragged away. It was
remarked afterwards that the prisoner-in-chief, J. A. Cloud, had
nodded significantly as if he had quite approved of all that was
being said.</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. &mdash; MAUDE MCIVER</h2>

<p class="first">THE arrest of Joseph Arthur Cloud, in
particular, created a tremendous amount of interest almost
everywhere, and a great sigh of relief went up in many far-away
cities of the world when the news was flashed along the cables
under the sea.</p>

<p>In banking circles, especially, was the event received
everywhere with the liveliest satisfaction. For so long indeed
had he been a thorn in their sides, and for so long had he
carried out his bold scheme against them successfully, that the
very silence which for months had preceded his arrest had worried
them not a little. They had been wondering amongst themselves in
what new direction his activities were next going to break out,
and in what unfortunate part of the world his offences against
these organisations would be resumed.</p>

<p>The highest praise was lavished unstintingly upon the
authorities of South Australia, and when the particular part that
Inspector Romilly had played in the arrest began gradually to
become realised, his achievements were in many ways lifted almost
into the regions of romance.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after the day when the Smiter had been
committed for trial, Mr. Thomas McIver and Major Poole met on the
high road of Glenelg.</p>

<p>"Just come back from Northern Territory," said the former as
they shook hands, "but what a time you've all been having since I
went away."</p>

<p>"Exciting, very!" remarked the genial major, "but I suppose
you've been seeing all the newspapers, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've read everything," replied McIver, "and I shudder
every time when I think of that wretch Cloud. I can never get him
out of my thoughts."</p>

<p>"But what a devil he was," said the major, "and how he took us
all in!"</p>

<p>"All but Inspector Romilly," corrected McIver; "he got on his
track almost at once."</p>

<p>"And how he stuck to him, too," said the major
enthusiastically, "and just bided his time. Never
hurried&mdash;but just waited until the tick of the right second
and then&mdash;'click' and he jailed him right away."</p>

<p>"The arrest was splendid and the act of a clever and brave
man."</p>

<p>"Pooh," said Major Poole, "but that's what one would expect of
Romilly, courage and brains every time."</p>

<p>"How will he get on with the authorities," asked McIver; "will
there be any promotion for him, do you think?"</p>

<p>The major pursed his lips dubiously and shook his head. "Too
much jealousy, and not enough influence behind him, I'm afraid."
His face brightened considerably; "but there'll be a good lump in
rewards anyhow; he's sure of them."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm to give him &pound;2,000," added McIver. "I offered
that for the capture of the criminal. Now that reminds me, how
can I give it him, Major&mdash;what's the best way?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Major Poole.</p>

<p>"Why, should I send it him by post, should I call upon him, or
should I suggest he comes up to the house to fetch it?"</p>

<p>"Ask him up to dinner," said the major promptly, "and let him
sit next to the pretty Maude." He smiled knowingly. "I believe
he's rather smitten in that quarter, in fact I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>Thomas McIver frowned. "He's a policeman. Major, isn't he?" he
said.</p>

<p>The major bristled up. "Yes, and by Gad he's a gentleman too."
He eyed the old man very sternly. "Do you know, sir, that for six
months he was my superior officer in France? He was one of the
finest men we had and was decorated for gallantry on the field.
He's a D.S.O."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't know anything of that," said McIver, looking
rather uncomfortable, "but I certainly admit he quite looks the
part."</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Major Poole, "everybody thought a lot of
Romilly then and if the war had lasted another six months, he'd
have been a brigadier at least."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said McIver, anxious to mollify his friend, "I
will certainly ask him up. I'm very glad I mentioned the matter
to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you be careful about the money question," was the
parting shot of Major Poole, "for now I come to think about it, I
doubt if he'll take anything from you." He nodded his head
vigorously. "You see if I'm not right."</p>

<p>Mr. McIver walked home very thoughtfully. He brought up the
matter to his niece at once when he got in.</p>

<p>"Look here, Maude," he said, "about Inspector Romilly. I think
we ought to invite him up one evening. I've got that reward to
give him, you see, and I want to do it as delicately as
possible."</p>

<p>The girl turned suddenly towards the window and busied herself
with the arrangement of some flowers.</p>

<p>"He's quite a gentleman," went on the old man, "and Major
Poole says he was a major in France and is a D.S.O. You don't
mind, do you?"</p>

<p>"Mind?" laughed the girl, looking round. "Why, of course I
don't mind, uncle. I like Mr. Romilly very much and think him a
very interesting man. He's been very considerate to us too."</p>

<p>Mr. McIver shot a quick glance at his niece. It was unusual of
her to express an opinion about any man. "Well," he said slowly,
after a moment's pause, "we'll ask him up to dinner for Saturday.
We shall be alone then."</p>

<p><br>
In the meantime the inspector had been seeing nothing more of
any of the occupants of Clyde House. They had apparently dropped
completely out of his life. He had thought a lot about the girl,
however, and indeed, in quiet moments, she had been seldom out of
his thoughts. Time after time he had scorned himself for thinking
of her and one night, very reverently, but very deliberately, he
had burnt the white rose that she had given him. He wasn't going
to be a fool, he had told himself, and whine for what he knew
well could never be his. So he would just forget her or remember
her only as a very pretty girl whom everyone would, of course,
admire. He made his resolve with the strongest determination
possible at the time, but even in the next few hours he had
reluctantly to admit to himself that it had produced very little
effect. Directly he was alone his thoughts harked back
irresistibly to the garden at Glenelg, and in his dreams the
proud sweet face of Maude McIver haunted and troubled him to the
verge, almost, of despair.</p>

<p>One morning, however, he received a letter in an unknown hand
marked 'Private.' Its arrival stirred no interest in him until he
noticed suddenly that the postmark on it was Glenelg. It was
opened instantly then.</p>

<p>It was from Mr. Thomas McIver, and was a very short little
note just asking him to come up to dinner one evening informally,
as a friend, and suggesting the following Saturday, if it were
convenient. The writer added he should have asked him before, but
he had been away in Northern Territory for some weeks and had
only just returned to the city.</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly stared thoughtfully out of the window for a
long while after he had read it. What on earth had he been
invited up for, he asked himself curiously, and what good would
it do if he accepted the invitation?</p>

<p>They couldn't want really to make a friend of him, he was
sure, and if they wanted to patronise him&mdash;well, he wasn't
having any. It was just politeness, he told himself, and nothing
more. He wouldn't go up&mdash;it would be a nuisance and a
bother. He would have to buy evening clothes, too, and he would
much rather put the money on a horse and give it a run that way.
Then he thought of Maude McIver, and his determination not to
accept died away all at once. How divinely sweet she had been
that last time he saw her. He remembered how she had looked at
him that afternoon in the garden when she had given him the rose.
Instinct told him that for one moment, then, the barrier between
them had been miraculously broken down. Policeman and heiress
they had not been then, but man and woman calling to each other
as sex had called to sex down all the ages. How heavenly it had
been!</p>

<p>But there&mdash;he was a fool again. It was idiocy to indulge
in those thoughts. She could never be anything to him. They were
both in different worlds. He was a policeman&mdash;poor and with
practically no prospects, and she was a rich heiress with all the
Commonwealth to choose from for a lover.</p>

<p>Still, he would go, if only to show her that out of his
policeman's uniform he could be just as were the other men she
was accustomed to meet. It was chance only that had made and kept
him a policeman. No one need be ever ashamed of him as a friend.
Both in France and England as a major in the A.I.F. he had been
on intimate terms with the best people in the old country and
their bearing and conduct were his naturally. He could flaunt it
with the best of them anywhere.</p>

<p><br>
The following Saturday, therefore, at half past six precisely,
he rang the bell of Clyde House and gave his hat and coat to the
trim maid who answered it.</p>

<p>For a moment the girl did not recognise the immaculately
dressed gentleman she was ushering in, and then with a start and
a little gasp of surprise she said demurely:</p>

<p>"Oh, if you please, sir, Mr. McIver wants to see you in the
library first. He told me to bring you straight in."</p>

<p>Mr. McIver was writing at his desk and there was another start
and another gasp of surprise when he, too, realised that it was
Inspector Romilly who had entered.</p>

<p>"Good man," he said heartily, at once coming forward to shake
hands. "I'm very pleased to see you. Now sit down here for a
moment," and he drew another chair up to the desk and resumed his
own. "I wanted to see you before we go in to the others. I hoped
we should have been alone, but two very old friends turned up
unexpectedly to-day and I had to ask them to stay." The old man
seemed to hesitate a bit and looked rather embarrassed.
"I&mdash;I intended to write you some weeks back but then I
thought it best to wait until I saw you personally." He smiled
kindly. "I hadn't forgotten my promise about the &pound;2,000 reward and
I'm delighted to give it you now&mdash;you've deserved it, every
penny of it." He took a sealed envelope off the desk and held it
out to the inspector. "I've put no name on the cheque," he added
slily, "but just made it payable to bearer. You can cash it over
the counter and no one will be any the wiser."</p>

<p>But Inspector Romilly made no movement to take the cheque. He
shook his head decidedly and drew back in his chair. "Thank you
very much indeed, sir," he said smilingly, "but I'd rather not
take it. I'm very grateful to you though, all the same."</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas McIver looked very puzzled.</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?" he asked with a frown,</p>

<p>"I can't take it," replied the inspector; "it's against our
regulations to accept rewards from private people, you know."</p>

<p>"Damn your regulations," spluttered the old man. "Do you mean
to tell me you're going to refuse &pound;2,000."</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly shrugged his shoulders and sighed
resignedly. "I must. It's very good of you, but I can't take
it."</p>

<p>"But, man, it's a fortune I want to give you. It's yours by
right. I promised it to you. I can afford it and you must take
it."</p>

<p>"I can't, Mr. McIver, and I don't want to. Look
here&mdash;I've been a soldier as well as a policeman, and
although I'm no saint, I've got a certain code of honour. I'm
sorry, but I have to refuse. Please don't say any more about it
for of course it's a temptation to me."</p>

<p>"You're a fool, Inspector," exclaimed Mr. McIver angrily, "and
deserve nothing good in your life. No, I don't mean that," went
on the old man repentantly, "but I do mean that you're really
stupid. I'm very disappointed with you."</p>

<p>The inspector smiled good-temperedly. "Please don't be cross
about it," he replied; "a policeman is a machine, not a man, you
know."</p>

<p>Mr. McIver shut down his desk with a snap. "Well, well," he
grumbled discontentedly, "you'll be a worry to me, anyhow. I
shall have to make it up to you in some way or other and it'll be
a devil of a job to find out exactly how." Then his face broke
into an amused smile. "You're a funny chap, Romilly, but come on
now, we'll go into the drawing-room&mdash;we mustn't keep them
waiting any longer."</p>

<p>The inspector drew himself up proudly, but not without some
quickening of his heart, and followed the old man out into the
hall.</p>

<p>There were four people in the drawing-room when they went in.
Two men, who were unknown to him, and Mrs Carter and Maude
McIver. The girl was talking to the two men, but hearing the door
open she looked round and her eyes instantly caught his. Just the
gentlest dropping of her eye-lids, just the faintest quiver of
the pretty lips, and with a becoming little blush, she rose at
once to greet him. If she was astonished at seeing him in evening
dress, her face in no way expressed it, and long before he had
reached her side, she was the cool self-possessed lady of the
house again. She smiled nicely and shook hands. Then she
introduced him to the two men.</p>

<p>"Sir Charles Andover, Mr. Hiram Pellew; my aunt, Mrs. Carter,
I think you already know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter bowed stiffly and, almost to the verge of
rudeness, stared Mark Romilly up and down. She had not forgotten
how once he had ordered her peremptorily to come out and be
questioned, and she had not forgiven him for it. She resented,
too, that he had been asked up to dinner at all, and she was
annoyed that he looked so presentable and well-dressed.</p>

<p>"Just as if he were a gentleman," she snorted to herself;
"really, Maude ought to have had more sense, and Thomas, too, for
suggesting it."</p>

<p>But the object of her annoyance was not worrying about her in
the least. He was determined to enjoy himself that evening, and
was chatting in the easiest way possible with the others in the
room.</p>

<p>Maude McIver, too, was watching him, and for some reason she
dare not even to herself explain, she was feeling quite proud
that in appearance he looked such a perfect gentleman. Evening
dress suited him so well, and of all the men present he was by
far the handsomest and most distinguished.</p>

<p>They went in to dinner and the hum of happy voices soon
pervaded softly through the room. Miss McIver occupied one end of
the table and adjoining her, on either side, sat Sir Charles and
the inspector. Mr. McIver sat at the other end.</p>

<p>"We don't go in for a butler, you see, Mr. Romilly," presently
said Maude McIver quietly, when Sir Charles was for the moment
replying to some remark of their host. "I'm afraid you'll find
this dinner not nearly so exciting as that other one in
Glenelg."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid," he replied piously, looking straight into the
lovely dark face now so close to him. "I never knew what was
going to happen that night. It was really a very anxious
time."</p>

<p>"Well, you must tell me about it some day. There are a lot of
other things I want to ask you, too." Then she added with a sweet
little half-bow of apology, "I'm afraid you must think us very
ungrateful, my uncle and me. We've never written to thank you for
everything you've done, but it wasn't because we weren't
grateful, really. My uncle was away and I couldn't very well
write to you on my own."</p>

<p>The inspector almost frowned. "Please don't say anything about
that," he replied. "There's nothing at all for you to be grateful
about; indeed, things are all the other way. You helped me
perhaps more than you'll ever know."</p>

<p>The girl looked down quickly to her plate, but before she
could say anything more the genial voice of her uncle came up
from the other end of the table.</p>

<p>"Now then, Romilly," he said emphatically, "I want your
corroboration here." He looked at the other two men. "Our friend
was Major in the A.I.F.," he explained, "over in France and
D.S.O. there, too. No, don't frown, Romilly, you're too modest by
a long way. Poole was in here yesterday and telling us all about
you, or we might never have known what an angel we were
entertaining unawares. Poole told us all about what you did in
France. Now, young man, you're getting red."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Mr. Romilly," smilingly broke in Maude McIver,
"Major Poole was very nice about you and only told us things that
as Australians we're very proud of. But what is it you want
corroborated, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I was forgetting. Now, Romilly, do you think you
could find a single Australian soldier who didn't appreciate and
wasn't grateful for the kindness he received in England?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I'm certain I couldn't find one. Next to the
fighting, the happiest thing we can remember is the way we were
received into the English homes. It humbled us a bit too, for
those of us who went over-seas will never think again that a good
Australian is better than a good Englishman. We've learnt our
lesson thoroughly. There was too much of the village mind about
us over here before."</p>

<p>"Well, Major Romilly," smiled Sir Charles, "I'm very glad you
thought we did you well. I'm in the Home Office over there you
see. Your boys were an eye-opener to us, I can tell you, and we
might have been very jealous if we hadn't known you were all in
the family. But you, yourself&mdash;you left the Army, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; I went back into the Police."</p>

<p>"You're Chief Commissioner here then?"</p>

<p>The inspector laughed. "I wish I were. I'm only inspector and
not a senior one even at that."</p>

<p>There was an embarrassed silence for a moment and then the
quiet-looking Mr. Pellew broke in, in an unmistakably nasal
drawl.</p>

<p>"Wa-al, you're a mighty creditable-looking one, anyhow. I must
say that. Sure, if they've men like you for inspectors over
here&mdash;to qualify for Commissioners, they'll be wanting Field
Marshals and archangels to properly look the part."</p>

<p>They all at once laughed merrily, except Mrs. Carter who took
up the conversation next.</p>

<p>"Oh, but Inspector," she said, rather sourly, "you must have
found it very dreadful to go back to police work. To see that the
public-houses close at proper time and stop betting and all
that."</p>

<p>The inspector showed his strong white teeth in an amused
smile. "There are worse things than that by a long way, Mrs.
Carter," he replied. "Point duty, for instance. Directing traffic
is a horrible thing. You're always expecting to be run over, and
in muddy weather you get just grimed up with mud. The motors
splash you terribly."</p>

<p>"Oh, now please tell us who drive the more carelessly, Major
Romilly," broke in Miss McIver sweetly, bending forward in the
friendliest way possible, "men or women? Come now, be honest. I
want to know. We're always arguing about it here, uncle and
I."</p>

<p>"No, Maude, I won't have it," interrupted her uncle in mock
displeasure; "you're corrupting the jury with your smiles." He
appealed to the company generally. "How can the poor man speak
truthfully when she's looking at him like that?"</p>

<p>"Quite right, sir," agreed Mr. Pellew. "If she looked at me
like that I'd have to say anything. Major Romilly, if you speak,
sir, I'll take back that pretty compliment I paid you a minute or
two ago. You'll be as weak as I am always with a pretty
girl."</p>

<p>The girl pretended to sigh in disappointment and the
conversation drifted again to the other end of the table.</p>

<p>She glanced down at her plate and then, looking up suddenly,
found the inspector's eyes upon her.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said quietly, "for coming to the rescue, but
I'm not ashamed anyhow."</p>

<p>"I didn't think for a moment you were," she rejoined equally
quietly, and then she added, smiling back, "I knew aunt would
never forgive you for making her come out that morning. She's
always most good-hearted, but very prejudiced once she's fancied
someone's offended her."</p>

<p>After dinner the girl played to them, and then later they sat
on the verandah in the dark, listening to the distant strains of
the band in Glenelg. The night was soft and warm, and the faint
moon just broke through the shadows on the sea. A silence fell
upon them all, and they sat each hushed in their own
thoughts.</p>

<p>One there was who watched the girl just by him, with her face
turned sideways, and every line of the lovely profile showing up
clear against the sky. He noted the beautiful low forehead, the
curving of the sweetly-parted lips, the chin that told of
character, and the queenly poise of the shapely little head. His
eyes followed longingly the lines of the slim proud neck and
rapturously he took in the rise and fall of the
exquisitely-moulded bosom. An angel almost he thought her, and of
the very type of woman that in all ages had atoned for the pains and
disappointments of life, and made love the great eternal
recompense for the sorrows of the world.</p>

<p>And Maude&mdash;what of Maude?</p>

<p>All like a fierce and terrifying storm had love come into her
life. She hardly herself knew exactly what had happened yet, but
she realised there was something different in every way about
her. Her very body seemed to have undergone some wonderful
physical change, and all her senses throbbed with some strange
and new emotion trying to express itself in a thousand different
ways.</p>

<p>There were thoughts and longings that she did not understand.
Thoughts that frightened her, and longings that she dared not
dwell on for their very wonder. She had known nothing of love
before, and had been scornful that sentiment would ever touch
her.</p>

<p>But now here, she herself was full of sighs and tremblings,
and all because of this man by her side. She could not help
admiring him, and oh! how she hoped that he would think that she
was pleasing, too. But she must hide it all because she was a
woman and not supposed, of course, to have the feelings that a
man would have. She must be cold, or he would think her forward,
and for all the world she must not let him see that she admired
him and was already thinking of him as her lord.</p>

<p>She looked straight out before her to the sea, but all the
while she knew that he was watching her.</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly came out of his delicious reverie with a
sigh, and, looking guiltily round, saw that the grizzled old
Hiram Pellew was observing him with what he thought was a faintly
amused smile.</p>

<p>Throwing away his cigarette, he got up to make his good-byes.
Just an ordinary leave-taking he told himself, and then back into
the old world again to stifle all his longings and forget.</p>

<p>He was thanking and saying good-bye to Maude, when her uncle
said they would both come down through the garden to see him out.
They walked down the path talking of nothing in particular, and
stopped just by the garden gate.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Romilly," said the old man genially, "now you've
found your way up here unofficially, we hope you'll often give us
a look up when you're disengaged and have got the time."</p>

<p>"I shall be very pleased to," replied the inspector. "I've
enjoyed myself immensely. It's been such a perfect night, too. By
Jove, how beautifully your flowers smell here."</p>

<p>"Water, my boy, water. That's the whole secret of it all.
Maude, give him a flower for a buttonhole. I'm sure he deserves
it."</p>

<p>The girl moved up to the trellis where the roses twined. It
was the same trellis from where she had picked the white rose
that day he so well remembered, but which now seemed so long ago.
Mark Romilly felt his heart stand still. For a moment she seemed
to hesitate as if she were looking for some particular bloom;
then with the same pretty movement as once before, she handed him
a flower. Again it was a rose, but this time the colour of it was
red. She turned her eyes away as she gave it to him. A moment
later and she was shaking hands in the cold and conventional way
of slight acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>"Good night, Mr. Romilly, I'm so glad you came," but her eyes
were still anywhere but on his. She seemed to be looking on the
ground. Then suddenly, just as he was going to turn away, she
looked up and flashed a glance straight at him that set every
nerve within him tingling.</p>

<p>The lids were lowered, but he could just see her eyes, and
there was the message in them that is old as the race is old. The
undying challenge of the woman to be taken, and the bugle call to
that uneven battle, where, in the end, the woman is invariably
both the conqueror and the conquered.</p>

<p><br>
Returning to the house the girl at once said good night, and
sought the quietness of her own room, but her uncle rejoined his
two other guests who were smoking on the verandah.</p>

<p>"Nice chap, that inspector," drawled Hiram Pellew, "and very
good-looking, too. I suppose all the girls are in love with him.
Is he married do you know?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied Mr. McIver, "in fact, I am sure
not. Major Poole here is his friend and he told us all about him
the other day. They were together in France during the war."</p>

<p>"Well, if I'd got a daughter," went on the old American, "he's
the very sort of chap I'd like for a son-in-law."</p>

<p>"What," asked the old man incredulously, "an Inspector of
Police for a son-in-law? You don't mean it?"</p>

<p>"Sure, and indeed I do. But he wouldn't be an Inspector of
Police long, if I were interested in him. I tell you, my friend,
there are the makings of anything in that man. I've been a boss
in New York State as you know for over thirty years, and I
recognise grit at once when I see it. That man's never had a
chance. He's a fine fellow, and damn proud, too."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he's proud enough anyhow. He refused &pound;2,000 before
dinner this evening."</p>

<p>"Gosh, tell us about it, do. I'm quite interested in him."</p>

<p>Mr. McIver explained all that had happened, and there was a
silence for a few moments when he had finished.</p>

<p>Mr. Hiram Pellew got up with a yawn. "Well. I'm off to bed,
old man," he remarked. Then he went on appreciatively&mdash;"Fine
climate this of yours, McIver, it quite takes the age out of
one's bones. I feel romance in me to-night. Love's in the very
air, and my thoughts go back to the old courting days." He looked
keenly at his friend.</p>

<p>"Do you remember that girl in California, Thomas? We were only
boys then. The little dark one, I mean. I forget her name. You
used to take her roses, but her father wouldn't have you anyhow,
because you weren't strong in the dollar line then. She married
that fat Dutchman afterwards&mdash;nice little thing she
was&mdash;it quite spoilt her life." He yawned again. "Lovely
girl, your niece, Thomas. Some man's going to be happy there. But
take care of her, my boy, and keep the bounders away. I shouldn't
think she wants a rich man, but she wants a decent one, anyhow,"
and with a final "Good night," he went off to bed.</p>

<p>There were three people in the house that night who took a
long while getting off to sleep. Maude, because she was in love,
Hiram Pellew, because he had taken a particular fancy to Mark
Romilly, and, guessing that the latter was in love with Maude,
was worrying his very active brain to devise how best he might be
able to help them, and old Thomas McIver himself, because he was
troubling about all the parties concerned. To begin with, his old
friend Pellew had ruthlessly started him on a train of thought
that was always a very painful one to him. A confirmed old
bachelor, he had nevertheless been once very much in love. As a
young man he had ardently loved this little Californian girl to
whom his friend had so tactlessly referred, and it had been the
great sorrow of his life that he had allowed himself to be so
weakly driven from her side. He ought to have stuck to her at any
cost, he was always telling himself, and in the end, she would
have certainly been his. His weakness had soured his life, and
the memory of it was always painful even after all these years.
Then, Pellew had spoken pointedly about some happy man who would
be marrying Maude one day, and it would be no good pretending
that he was unaware of what was in Pellew's mind at the moment.
It was not that he disliked the inspector or was in any way a
snob. He did like the man, and admired him very much indeed.</p>

<p>That evening he had looked what he was&mdash;a perfect
gentleman&mdash;and as Maude's husband he would be a credit to
her beauty and her wealth. But a man who had been a policeman!
What on earth would people say? Of course, he wouldn't be giving
even the remote possibility of such a thing a moment's thought if
Pellew's remark had had not set him thinking about a lot of
little things that he had noticed lately about his niece. She was
very interested in Romilly, as she had openly admitted, and only
the previous day she had brazenly pumped Major Poole to find out
all about him. He had joked with her about it afterwards, and he
remembered now that she had blushed a good deal. Then she had
fallen in so readily with the suggestion that the inspector
should be asked up to dinner when he was given that cheque. His
sister had been strongly against his coming, but Maude had
quietly put her foot down, and as the house and everything about
it was hers she had, of course, at once got her way. Then, too,
he remembered she had been rather put out when Andover and Pellew
had arrived suddenly from Melbourne, and as old and life-long
friends of his, he had said he couldn't well do otherwise than
ask them to stay at the house. She had been upset evidently
because the inspector would not be dining with them alone. Then
that night also she had been much more talkative than she
generally was, and several times he had noticed her and Romilly
carrying on a little conversation by themselves at dinner. It was
so unlike Maude to be interested particularly in any man.
Altogether he thought it was very annoying, for it was no good
forgetting that the girl was a rich heiress and a splendid catch
for any impecunious fortune-hunter who was on the look out.</p>

<p>It was long after midnight before he got to sleep.</p>

<p><br>
Two days after the dinner Inspector Romilly was riding down
the great Port Road. He was a fine horseman, and many an
approving glance was thrown in his direction as he rode along.
But he noticed no one on his way. He seemed preoccupied and
thoughtful, and there was an air of melancholy on his face.</p>

<p>Presently a big touring car flashed up. It was being driven
rapidly and held but a single occupant. The driver, when just
level, glanced casually towards the inspector and then, evidently
recognising him, pulled up sharply.</p>

<p>"Morning, Inspector," called out a hearty voice, "but, sure,
you've not forgotten me already?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," the inspector replied at once. "I should
remember you anywhere, Mr. Pellew."</p>

<p>They chatted for a few minutes and then the American, looking
at his watch, said he must go.</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Inspector," he said questioningly, with his foot out
on the clutch, "isn't this darned land of yours supposed to be a
democratic country?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and it is too. Everyone's as good as everybody else
here, or we're taught so at all events."</p>

<p>Mr. Hiram Pellew raised his eyebrows slightly as if
surprised.</p>

<p>"Wa-al, some of you seem darned slow anyhow," he drawled
quietly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Inspector Romilly, puzzled at the
drift of his remarks.</p>

<p>"Sure, in my country we don't expect the gals to do all the
courting, that's all. See?" and before the astonished inspector
could think of any reply, he slipped in the clutch and was off
down the road.</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; THE HELP OF LAROSE</h2>

<p class="first">THE trial of Joseph Arthur Cloud for the murder
at Glenelg was one of the very briefest on the capital charge
ever recorded in the State of South Australia. The prisoner made
no attempt at any defence, and listened with cynical indifference
to the marshalling of all the evidence against him. Merciless
himself he had been always in his dealings with the community,
and now he, in his turn, expected no mercy from them. He sat in
the dock between two warders, a cold and dominating personality,
with his face the perfect study of untroubled repose. And his
composure was in no way assumed either, but seemed rather the
natural expression of a calm and even disposition.</p>

<p>Only once did he appear to evince any interest at all in the
proceedings, and that was when Inspector Romilly went into the
witness-box. His eyes gleamed then with anger, when the story was
unfolded of the long and patient vigil over the garage of Clyde
House.</p>

<p>"But I suspected it," he broke in scornfully, with the only
comment that he made throughout the whole trial. "I thought many
times that there was smoke coming out of the window and, if it
were, I knew it could be only tobacco smoke from someone smoking
inside."</p>

<p>The judge bade him, sternly, not to interrupt, and he at once
subsided frowningly, as if he were annoyed that he had been
betrayed into speech at all.</p>

<p>When the verdict of 'guilty' was announced, and the judge
proceeded to don the black cap and sentence him to death, of all
there in the Court he appeared perhaps the least disturbed, and
he was ready even before his guards, to pass down the steps at
the back of the dock.</p>

<p>It was noticed, however, and remarked upon afterwards, that as
he turned away, his last look was directed towards Inspector
Romilly and Detective Jackson who were standing together at the
far side of the Court. His eyes had been seen to roam round as if
he were seeking someone and then lighting upon the inspector, he
had stared hard for a few seconds. A look of dreadful hatred had
crossed into his face and his lips had parted as if he were about
to speak. But for some reason he had apparently thought better of
it; he had smiled a cold and sinister smile and then, in an
instant again, his features had been masked to that complete
indifference that had characterised them throughout the
trial.</p>

<p>A learned professor of the University of Adelaide, a great
student of the human mind, who had been a privileged spectator at
the trial, remarked, when dining that evening with some friends,
that never could he have conceived so callous an individual as
the wretch whom he had seen sentenced to death that afternoon.
The man, he told his hearers, had apparently had no interest at
all in the dreadful fate that was awaiting him, he had seemingly
considered himself as superior to all censure of the community,
and he had left the Court exactly as if he were still holding
punishment in store for those who had offended him. In fact,
concluded the professor, he seemed exactly like a man in the
secret possession of a bomb.</p>

<p><br>
The next morning, Detective Jackson was shot dead by an
unknown person in broad daylight, as he was coming out of his
house, and, within a few hours, Detective Hart was reported
missing and his body discovered later, in the Torrens River, with
a thin cord tied tightly round its neck.</p>

<p><br>
The psychology of the crowd is not unlike that of the
individual, and they are at all times slow to take in the horror
of a calamity that does not directly affect them. They may be
interested and indeed shocked but, so long as the trouble is
distant far enough from them, only in an impersonal sort of way.
But once let that calamity come nearer, let it show signs of
spreading so that the well-being of any or every one of them is
in danger, then the horror of everything is at once grasped in
its proper perspective and a true appreciation arises of the evil
that is within their midst.</p>

<p>And so it was now with the inhabitants of South Australia when
the assassination of the two detectives became known. They were
roused on the instant to a state of consternation and rage.</p>

<p>The murder of Mr. McIver at Glenelg had moved them to an
interested and horrified speculation as to the identity of the
murderer. The crime had thrilled and excited them, but the
interest had been in the main an impersonal one, and did not come
home to them particularly in their daily lives.</p>

<p>But the murder of the two detectives was quite a different
matter. It had in every way a most direct bearing upon their
individual well-being, for it was a defiance to the forces that
were protecting them and it was a challenge to the authorities at
the very source of their power.</p>

<p>For the significance of their new crimes was clear to
everyone. Vengeance had been taken upon the two detectives
because of their part in the unmasking of the condemned J. A.
Cloud, and suspicion was directed immediately to the one
remaining member of the gang who was still at large, namely
Andrew, the notorious garrotter, of New South Wales. So they were
stung to anger as well as fear, and they called, in a thousand
voices, for the wretch to be run down. The more sanguine among
them expected that an arrest would be made at once, and when no
more than twenty-four hours had elapsed without anything
happening they began in no uncertain way to blame the police.</p>

<p>What were the police doing? they asked, and how, with the
description of the man so well known, was it possible for him to
be still hiding in the State, or, worse still, that he had been
able to get away across the border?</p>

<p>But it was all very well to decry the police. They could not
make bricks without straw and they had nothing to go on to effect
an arrest.</p>

<p>Detective Jackson had been fired at through his garden hedge,
but no one had had even a glimpse of the assassin. He had been
shot point blank, when only about five paces from the gate. His
housekeeper had been on the outside verandah at the time, but
although within a few yards of where the murderer must have
stood, she had seen no one.</p>

<p>The detective, she said, had been starting for work at his
usual time, at a quarter past eight. He had nodded good-bye to
her, and proceeded down the garden path towards the gate. She had
stopped to look at some plants, and then suddenly she had heard
the sharp crack of a pistol. Looking up instantly, she had seen
the detective stagger and then fall crashing to the ground. She
had rushed then to his side to find him badly wounded in the
head. Terrified at his condition, and knowing there was no one in
the house, she had rushed into the road for help.</p>

<p>The railway station of Goodwood was only about a hundred yards
away and, seeing some officials there, she had shrieked for them
to come at once. But a train was just then passing through the
station and for a minute and more, no one had heard her cries.
Then, when finally she had succeeded in attracting attention, the
unfortunate detective was quite dead and no traces of the
assassin were to be discovered anywhere around.</p>

<p>The second outrage was equally as mysterious as the first, and
investigation proved equally as barren in results. Detective Hart
had met with his death with no witnesses to see him die. He had
been visiting the goods-yard of the railway station on North
Terrace that morning. His mission there had been to investigate a
case of petty pilfering that had taken place from one of the
trucks. He had finished his inquiries, and had left the yard just
before half past ten. He had been last seen talking to a porter
near the entrance gates and, after that, nothing more was known
of him until at a quarter past six that evening, when his body
had been found in a clump of weeds just near the river bank. But
that something had happened to him was suspected even before an
hour had passed after he had been last seen, for he should have
been up at the Police Court in Victoria Square as witness in an
important case at eleven o'clock precisely and it was unlike him
to be even a minute behind time. The post-mortem showed that he
had been first stunned and then strangled and there were signs of
his body having been dragged about a hundred yards before it had
been consigned to its final resting place among the reeds.</p>

<p>It was concluded instantly that the two assassinations were
the work of the same man, and the authorities, too, were of the
same mind as the public as to the perpetrator being Andrew, of
the Smiter's gang.</p>

<p>It was known that Andrew was a man of reckless character and
that next to J. A. Cloud, he, of all the malefactors who had
disturbed the peace of the Commonwealth, was most to be feared.
He was a clever, daring criminal, and in desperate situations had
many times shown himself to be a man of great resource. For a
long time he had been a wanted man. His description had been
broadcast throughout the Commonwealth over and over again, but
the value of this was largely discounted by the fact that he was
a great master of disguises and could so alter his appearance, it
was said, that he was unrecognisable even to his own friends.</p>

<p>The police of South Australia needed no spurring on in their
endeavours to catch him, and, in the days ensuing upon the deaths
of the two detectives, the city and all likely townships were
gone through with a fine comb. All the hotels, the lodging-houses,
and apartment places were visited, and through the Press
generally everyone was invited to make known the presence of any
stranger within their midst. A reward of &pound;500 was offered by the
Government.</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner of the Police himself was at first
quite hopeful and candidly admitted that he was expecting any
moment they might make the arrest. Quite openly he took the
public into his confidence.</p>

<p>"You see," he said to a Press interviewer, "in all human
probability the assassin is still somewhere in South Australia,
for the hue-and-cry for him was raised so quickly that he can
have had no opportunity to bolt unobserved into another State by
a long distance train. He would have known, too, to a certainty,
that all arrivals anywhere that came from South Australia would
be subjected to a most rigorous scrutiny, and he would not have
risked it. Therefore he is hiding somewhere in this State, and if
that be so it is almost certain that it is Adelaide itself that
is giving him sanctuary.</p>

<p>"It is not likely he will have taken to the bush, for sooner
or later then he would have to come out for food and, on any
suspicions being aroused, he would know we should have the black
trackers on him at once. The outlying townships, too, would be
risky, for a stranger there, at the present time, would be at
once remarked upon. No, he is probably in the city now, and that
is why we ought to get him if every one of us keeps on the
look-out. His description has been published everywhere and although
he will undoubtedly have altered his appearance, still there are
three things that should inevitably undo him in the end&mdash;he
is a stranger to people here in the city, he is of medium height
and he has dark eyes." The Chief Commissioner here smiled at the
Press representative. "We must remind ourselves, too, that this
Andrew, with all his cleverness, is no super-man, and he must
somehow eat and drink and have somewhere to sleep too."</p>

<p>The remarks of the Chief Commissioner made a great impression
in the city, and everyone was at once buoyed up with the hope
that the desired arrest would eventuate, at least, within the
course of a few days. But when a week went by and nothing had
happened, people began rather to take the view that the Chief
Commissioner had overstated his case and, when a fortnight had
passed and still no one had been brought to book, there were few,
if any, who were not of opinion that somehow the assassin had
once again proved himself too good for the powers that were.</p>

<p>There was another aspect of the case too that was becoming now
more and more insistent in the public mind. Had they heard the
last of the garrotter they asked themselves, or were there more
horrors yet to come? What about Inspector Romilly and Detective
Frognal the two other officers who had been responsible for J. A.
Cloud's arrest. Were they marked out for assassination, too, and
was the wretch Andrew only just biding his time to wreak his
vengeance on them when he could?</p>

<p>And it was not only the Man in the Street who regarded matters
in this light. His apprehensions were prevalent in official
quarters too.</p>

<p>One afternoon the Chief Commissioner himself sent for
Inspector Romilly and he eyed him sternly when he appeared,
handsome and debonair as usual, as if he, at least, had no care
in all the world.</p>

<p>"I don't like it, Romilly," he said gruffly; "if we don't look
out, you and Frognal will be the next ones to go. That fellow
Burke knew what he was about when he said you would be all marked
men."</p>

<p>"He told us something of the kind, too, sir," replied the
inspector cheerfully, "when I got him that evening at the White
House. He warned us then that Andrew would get busy if any of us
should figure too largely in the arrest."</p>

<p>"Then why the devil didn't you act on it?" asked the
Commissioner irritably. "With this type of man, precautions are
never thrown away."</p>

<p>"Sir," said the inspector slowly, "we are always threatened."
He shrugged his shoulders. "But until the other day, we have
always lived."</p>

<p>"It was a mistake anyhow that your names were mentioned," went
on the Commissioner; then he added grimly, "but I suppose it was
only natural. It was a fine piece of work."</p>

<p>The inspector looked out of the window; apparently he had
nothing to say.</p>

<p>"But what are you doing, man?" went on the Commissioner
brusquely, "for unless we get Andrew soon, it seems to me that
you and Frognal are both dead men."</p>

<p>The inspector spoke drily. "Detective Frognal is a brave man,
sir, and he is carrying on his duties in the usual way"&mdash;he
drew himself up proudly&mdash;"and I, too, sir, am not
unaccustomed to being under fire."</p>

<p>The Commissioner scowled angrily. "You shall both have leave
of absence until we have got the man. You can go away."</p>

<p>Inspector Romilly shook his head. "No good, sir. If the fellow
means going for us, he'll only bide his time,
besides&mdash;besides, it would look as if the force were
afraid."</p>

<p>"But I don't like it, Romilly," reiterated the Commissioner in
dismissing him; "we are fighting in the dark, and I tell you
frankly, it will be no surprise to me to learn any day now that
something has happened to one or both of you two."</p>

<p>And that the Commissioner was amply justified in his
misgivings was soon proved, for less than a week later, and just
three days before J. A. Cloud was to suffer the extreme penalty
of the law, the dead body of Detective Frognal was discovered on
the railway line between Woodville and Kilkenny, just after the
passing of the mid-day train.</p>

<p>An engine-driver on a city-bound train was the first one to
see it, lying just off the permanent way and he pulled up at the
first signal box to report. The police were at once notified, and
the body was picked up and brought in. Immediately then, it was
recognised as that of Frognal, and from the nature of the
injuries it was clear that the detective must have come from a
passing train. His back was broken and there were terrible
injuries about the head. The body was still warm when it was
found, and it was at first thought that the tragedy was purely
accidental, but an examination of the carriages of the particular
train from which he must have fallen revealed unmistakable
evidence of foul play. In a smoking compartment two carriages
distant from the guard's van, there were signs that a deadly
struggle had taken place, and one of the seats there was smeared
over with blood. At the autopsy also, it was proved that he had
been savagely man-handled, at the throat.</p>

<p>The authorities were stupefied at the daring nature of the
outrage, for the crime had been accomplished in the middle of the
day and with many people on the train at the time. Indeed, it was
considered marvellous that no one had heard sounds of the
struggle or seen the body being thrown out.</p>

<p>No trace of the perpetrator of the deed was discovered, and in
the feverish investigations that ensued, no clue of any kind came
to light. No suspicious person had been seen either before or
after in the vicinity of the crime, and at no station farther
down the line was there any recollection of any passenger having
alighted from the train, who exhibited about him any signs
whatever of having been in a struggle or a fight.</p>

<p>The assassin, as twice before, had vanished like a shadow in
the night.</p>

<p><br>
Upon the following Tuesday, at five minutes past eight, Joseph
Arthur Cloud was duly 'hanged by the neck until he was dead.' He
died cynical and indifferent to the last, and spectators at the
execution said that the final expression of his face was that of
a smile.</p>

<p>Later, the same morning. Inspector Romilly sat alone in his
room. He looked worried and it was evident his thoughts were not
pleasant ones. In fact, the past three days he had not been
having at all a happy time. People had been making a fuss about
him, and he could not appear anywhere in public without being
made at once the cynosure of all eyes. Everybody stared at him,
and he knew quite well what was in their minds. They were
regarding him in the light of a dying man. He had heard
expressions of pity from them, and once a woman near him had
crossed herself and burst into tears. He himself was quite aware
he was in danger, but he was prepared to face that, and it
annoyed him that everyone should interfere in his affairs and
take it for granted that he had only a few more days to live.</p>

<p>The previous day he had been on duty at the races at Victoria
Park, and the whole time he had seen people watching him. They
had edged up to him and pointed him out to one another. Some of
them, indeed, had almost seemed to expect that he was going to be
shot publicly.</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair and looked despondently out of the
window. It was dreadful, he thought, the difficulty the police
force of South Australia were now in. They could find out
nothing; they could make no headway; they could not even protect
themselves. Something must be very wrong somewhere, for they were
like children in the hands of this man who assassinated where he
pleased. What a tragedy it was that they had no great detective
among them&mdash;no great detective, for instance, like Gilbert
Larose. Ah, Larose! Larose would have soon discovered something,
now, wouldn't he? He would have soon run the man to earth if he
had been in South Australia. But Larose was one of a million; he
was a man almost with a mind inspired; he was a prince of
detectives&mdash;a very king among the trackers of crime.
He&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>His meditations were abruptly interrupted by a constable who
came in with a visiting card and a letter.</p>

<p>"A clergyman to see you, sir; he says the matter is very
urgent, but will you please read the letter first."</p>

<p>The inspector looked at the card.</p>

<p>"Rev. Thomas Bloggs, Sydney," he muttered. "Now, what the
devil&mdash;&mdash;" he began, and then his eye fell upon the
letter. "Great Scott," he ejaculated, "from Larose&mdash;now
that's wonderful."</p>

<p>He tore the envelope open quickly. It was a very short letter
and dated Sydney, two days previously.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear Mark</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">re the trouble you are in.</p>

<p class="letter">The bearer of this, the Reverend Thomas Bloggs,
is a friend of mine and he thinks he can help you in the clearing
up of these crimes. At any rate be patient with him, for he is a
good fellow.<br> <br> Believe me always, my dear Mark,</p>

<p class="letter">Your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Gilbert Larose</span>.</p>

<p><br>
The inspector read through the letter twice, but from the expression on his face the second perusal left him even more puzzled than the first.</p>

<p>"A clergyman," he muttered. "A clergyman to give us help."</p>

<p>"Show him in," he said at length tersely, "but if I touch the
bell twice, come in and say I am wanted by the Chief. You
understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the policeman and his face broke into a
smile; "he's a peculiar looking man."</p>

<p>A minute later and the Reverend Thomas Bloggs was ushered into
the room. He was a man about thirty and he had an ordinary
commonplace looking face. His complexion was pasty looking, he
wore a pair of small pince-nez, and he had a weak tremulous
mouth. He had straight black hair and he walked with a stooping
gait.</p>

<p>"Good Lord," muttered the inspector, "and this comes from
Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>The clergyman advanced hesitatingly. "Mr. Romilly," he said in
a gentle voice.</p>

<p>The inspector stood up and bowed. "The same," he replied
smiling. "You come from my friend Larose, I understand. Take a
seat, will you?"</p>

<p>The clergyman sat down on the chair in front of the desk. In
spite of his generally limp appearance he was evidently a man of
business, for with no further preliminaries, he at once proceeded
to abstract a bulky envelope from his breast pocket.</p>

<p>"Mr. Romilly," he began quietly. "I have been reading about
the tragic endings of those three officers of yours and it struck
me I should be able to throw some light upon the matter. I
consulted my friend, Mr. Larose, and he advised me to come to you
at once."</p>

<p>"Very much obliged, I am sure," said the inspector, and he
glanced down covertly at the letter of introduction that the
speaker had brought.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it is I, all right," said the Rev. Thomas Bloggs,
instantly taking in the intent glance that the inspector had
given to the letter, "and that is Mr. Larose's handwriting sure
enough. We are great friends, he and I."</p>

<p>The inspector reddened uncomfortably, he did not like it that
his thoughts should be so easily read.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it's his handwriting," he said quickly and he
smiled to cover his annoyance. "I should know it anywhere."</p>

<p>"Well, he thought I could help you," said the clergyman
modestly. "I have read all the newspaper reports you see."</p>

<p>The inspector bit his lip to repress a smile. He did not
really know whether to be amused or angry. Gilbert Larose, of all
men, to send a creature to him like this.</p>

<p>The clergyman took some newspaper cuttings out of the envelope
and laid them out before him on the desk.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," he began slowly, "that some very important
points have been missed, points quite unimportant individually in
themselves, but which, if taken altogether, link up the evidence
in a surprising way and narrow down the field of inquiry to quite
a manageable extent "&mdash;he shook his head reprovingly. "I
cannot understand how these points have come to be
overlooked."</p>

<p>The inspector reddened again, but it was with anger this time.
He was in no mood to be trifled with and the fellow's remarks
were savouring of impertinence now.</p>

<p>The clergyman picked up a cutting. "This is an extract from
the report of the first inquest," he said; "the one on Detective
Jackson, where his housekeeper runs out into the road directly
after he has been shot. Hum!&mdash;let me see&mdash;ah, here it
is&mdash;'She ran out of the garden to get help, there was no one
in the road, but she saw some officials by the railway station.'
Now, she doesn't say how many officials she saw; she may have
seen three or four, she may have seen two, or perhaps she may
have seen only one. At any rate she saw someone in uniform there,
but as to what the exact nature of the uniform was we are kept in
the dark." He looked up inquiringly at the inspector. "Now was it
a station master's uniform she saw or was it only a porter's?
Probably the latter, for a train was leaving the station at the
time and it is the custom at all small stations, I believe, for
the station master to be on duty, on the platform, to
superintend. So in all likelihood, it was just a porter she saw
when she ran out into the road."</p>

<p>The inspector looked out of the window and repressed a yawn.
He was bored. He had gone through them so many times, that he
knew all the inquest reports, almost off by heart. Why had Larose
sent this man to him, he asked himself again? It was beyond a
joke.</p>

<p>The clergyman went on, and his voice lapsed into a drone.</p>

<p>"Now we come to the second inquest&mdash;that upon Detective
Hart&mdash;and I think I may remark here that I take it for
granted that the detective was at least an ordinarily astute man.
The fact that he had been five years a detective at headquarters
and that you, yourself, personally selected him to assist you in
the shadowing of J. A. Cloud, both prove conclusively that he was
experienced in his profession, and had all his wits about him. He
must too have been deeply affected by the manner of the death of
his colleague, Detective Jackson, and have realised perfectly
well that his own life was in probable danger from the same hand.
Therefore, we may take it that he would be very much on the
look-out&mdash;that he would be on his guard."</p>

<p>The inspector had looked back from the window, and was now
intently watching the speaker, with a look of curious perplexity
upon his face.</p>

<p>"Well," continued the clergyman, "to return to this inquest on
Detective Hart. He had been investigating some pilfering from a
railway truck we are told. He had left the goods-yard and he was
seen," the clergyman spoke very slowly here and his voice seemed
suddenly to deepen and to lose its drone, "he was last
seen&mdash;talking to a porter&mdash;a man in uniform again."</p>

<p>The inspector sat up with a jerk. He drew in a sharp breath
and the hand that had lain idly on his chair clenched itself
until the knuckles stood out white. His lips parted and his face
looked almost as if he were in pain.</p>

<p>But the Reverend Thomas Bloggs apparently noticed nothing, for
he bent, close-sighted, over a third cutting that he was holding
in his hand.</p>

<p>"Now we come," he said, "to the case of Frognal and at once we
have the railway again. Thrown out of a train this time. As
before&mdash;a warned, suspicious man&mdash;doubly warned,
however, and doubly suspicious this time, a man who must have
been actually on the look-out for the very end that eventually
overtook him. No mention certainly of any men in uniform here, no
tale of porters or officials, but
still&mdash;still&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;the clergyman's voice
became low and stern&mdash;"as we have to fill in the blanks of
those last few minutes for ourselves, is it difficult to imagine
how safe a passport to his side a uniform would have
been&mdash;how he would have been lulled into security by the
proximity of a railway official of any kind, how a murderer in a
porter's coat, for instance, would have been enabled to draw
close, and how that dreadful neck hold would have been effected
without the slightest chance of the victim breaking clear?"</p>

<p>The clergyman suddenly stopped speaking. It seemed the vision
he had conjured up was affecting him and that he wanted time to
calm himself down. And he was not by any means the only one whose
emotions had been stirred. The face of Inspector Romilly was the
very picture of distress. All on the instant as it were, he had
been stunned into enlightenment. Chagrin and anger were
struggling in him, for he was mortified to the last degree that
he and everyone else, too, should have missed the line of thought
that had just been suggested to him.</p>

<p>And it was all so probable too! A man in a porter's uniform.
Of course that would explain everything. The assassin would have
been enabled to move freely about everywhere and, even with all
eyes on the look-out for him, no one would have given a railway
official even a passing thought. There would not have been the
slightest suspicion at any time.</p>

<p>The inspector spoke after a long time, and he put as much
carelessness into his voice as he possibly could assume. He had
pulled himself together and his face was masked in calm.</p>

<p>"Quite an ingenious theory, Mr. Bloggs," he remarked
carelessly; "the only flaw in it is, however, that strangers to
this city do not get taken on as railway officials as easily as
you think. It's a difficult matter to get employed on the railway
at any time and it means a long waiting, generally, before your
turn comes."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" said the clergyman; "whoever suggested, pray,
that the man had got a job on the railway? All he did, probably,
was to steal a porter's coat."</p>

<p>The inspector this time got even redder than before; he was
being taught his business with a vengeance, he thought, and the
mortification of it was, his teacher was this stupid-looking
man.</p>

<p>"Send for the Report Book," continued the clergyman,
insinuatingly, "and see if any thefts were reported from a
railway station or from some porter's house about that time."</p>

<p>The inspector glared hard at the speaker, but the clergyman
was now, in his turn, looking out of the window and was
apparently oblivious of the ill-favour he was in. A long
hesitation, and the inspector touched the push of his bell.</p>

<p>"Bring the Report Book, please," he said to the policeman who
immediately appeared; "the reports of last month I want."</p>

<p>"The reports for about the 9th instant," supplemented the
clergyman very softly, "for the first days of the second
week."</p>

<p>The door closed and there was silence in the room. The
clergyman continued to look out of the window, and the inspector
was occupied in looking at him. Quite a different expression,
however, had all at once come into the inspector's face. It
seemed now that he was in a way of being only very puzzled and
that his anger had at all events died away. Quietly, but
intently, he looked the clergyman well up and down. He
scrutinised his face, his hair, the clothes he wore and next his
hand. Then he picked up the envelope in which the letter of
introduction had come and thoughtfully&mdash;very
thoughtfully&mdash;he stared at it as if it were a strange thing,
the like of which he had never seen before.</p>

<p>All at once then&mdash;he smiled.</p>

<p>A tap on the door and the policeman brought in a large thick
book&mdash;he placed it on the desk and at once retired.</p>

<p>The inspector took out a cigarette from somewhere in his desk
and, having lit it, proceeded briskly to go through the book
before him.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I might join you," suggested the clergyman meekly. "I
find tobacco very soothing when I have to think."</p>

<p>"No, no," replied the inspector brusquely and without looking
up, "clergymen shouldn't smoke; it's bad for their nerves."</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Bloggs took the reproof quite meekly. He just
sighed and continued watching the inspector at his task.</p>

<p>"April the 7th&mdash;8th," muttered the latter with his finger
running quickly down the pages, "no, nothing relevant there.
April 9th: no, nothing there either; April 10th, ah! here we have
it; this might be the very thing we want. 'Phone message from
Ovingham railway station, received 6.40 a.m. Station office
broken into during the night. Entrance effected through skylight.
Unsuccessful attempt made to open the safe. Thief probably
interrupted, for nothing taken except about ten shillings worth
of postage stamps, and some porters' clothes."</p>

<p>The inspector leant suddenly across the desk and seized hold
of one of the clergyman's hands.</p>

<p>"Gilbert, my boy," he exclaimed with enthusiasm, "you shall
have your cigarette at once. It was the action of a real pal to
come all the way to help us, and I believe you've scored a bull's
eye, first time."</p>

<p>The clergyman betrayed no astonishment, but at once warmly
returned the hand clasp and then almost in one moment, shed his
hair, his eye-brows and his pince-nez. His face seemed to alter
in outline and the tremulous mouth was replaced suddenly by one
of decision and strength.</p>

<p>"But where did I go wrong, Mark," he asked plaintively; "don't
spare me for I'm always learning, you know?"</p>

<p>The inspector seemed as pleased as a schoolboy.</p>

<p>"Ah, you young rogue, and don't you think I knew who you were
all along? Didn't I recognise you at once as the great Gilbert
Larose?"</p>

<p>"No, you didn't," said the other decisively. "You hadn't a
suspicion in the world, until I called for that beastly Report
Book."</p>

<p>"That made me think, I admit, Gilbert," laughed the inspector.
"You knew too much for a parson I could see." He picked up the
envelope on the table&mdash;"But it was this that finally gave
you away."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Larose. "It's one I brought with me from Sydney
and I wrote the letter there."</p>

<p>"But you overdid it, my boy. You have made the envelope look
altogether too travel-stained for the short journey from Sydney.
I recognised your handwriting, of course, but it struck me the
letter had been purposely given a rough passage in your pocket to
convince me that it had been written there; either that, I was
sure, or else you had been slovenly in taking care of it on the
journey. I didn't think the latter, for your other envelope there
with the newspaper cuttings was quite clean and even unrumpled."
The inspector laughed again and shrugged his shoulders. "A small
thing, Gilbert, I admit, but it made me suspicious and
then&mdash;I saw through your make-up at once."</p>

<p>Larose put back his wig and eye-brows and adjusted his
pince-nez. He was smiling now, himself.</p>

<p>"Well, I give you one there, Mark," he said. "I ought to have
remembered I was dealing with an intelligence like my own." He
grinned in amusement for a moment and then his face dropped back
and took on cold grave lines. "But look here, Romilly," he went
on very seriously, "you're in great danger, old man, as great as
you can possibly imagine." He lowered his voice impressively and
outstretched his hand. "I know that fellow, Andrew, mind. He's
been a thorn in my side and I've known all his ways and tricks
for years. He's a doped wretch who'll stop at nothing. He'll have
you, Romilly, as sure as you are sitting there, unless&mdash;we
get in on him before."</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it, too, Gilbert," said the inspector quietly,
"but up to now there's not been the ghost of a chance of getting
in first." He reddened under his friend's intent glance. "I shall
always kick myself that I didn't see what you've just pointed
out."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said Larose modestly, "I only noticed it because I
was a long way away. You were too close to things to get the real
perspective that I had. But look here, Mark, with any luck now,
we'll get the man. I came over in this rig because not a soul
must learn I'm in the city. I'm not boasting, but Andrew is a bit
afraid of me. He knows I understand his little ways. I've nearly
had him several times and if he thinks I'm here specially on his
account, then very probably, he'll lie doggo and give us a lot of
trouble before we turn him out. But say, Mark, none of you caught
a glimpse of him that evening when you nabbed Burke and Masterton
at the White House, did you?"</p>

<p>The inspector shook his head. "Not one of us saw him; there
was only a woman at the gate."</p>

<p>"Tell me exactly what happened, the little things as well as
the big things, you know."</p>

<p>"There's really nothing to tell, Gilbert," said the inspector
sadly. "Burke fooled me beautifully that evening. We had tied
them both up and I was questioning him. He was quite quiet and
was not disinclined to talk. I noticed subconsciously, however,
that he kept looking at the clock. Then suddenly he began to
shout loudly at the very top of his voice and shrieked out
something about 'damned police.' He shouted several times and at
last I tumbled to it that he was warning someone outside not to
come in. We rushed to the door, but the wretch Burke was there
first and it was quite a couple of minutes before we could drag
him away and get it open. We ran down the garden to find only a
woman and two children, standing in the road. They had heard the
shouting and had stopped to see what was going on. There was no
man to be seen anywhere but the woman said there had been one
about a moment before. He had been just opening the gate she
said, when the shouting had begun, and he had at once turned and
walked away. She hadn't noticed in which direction he had gone."
The inspector sighed. "That was the nearest we got to him,
Gilbert, and there has been no trace of him since."</p>

<p>"What was the night like?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Bright moonlight," said the inspector, "and there were
electric lamps both up and down the road. But there were so many
turnings he might have taken and so many ways he might have gone
over the sand that it was quite hopeless, with the few of us
there, to attempt to follow. The only thing we could do was to
try and block him from getting back to the city or unearth him if
he did manage to get back there." The inspector shrugged his
shoulders. "But we failed in every direction. He had vanished and
left no trace."</p>

<p>"The city was the last place he would run to," said Larose
meditatively; "more likely the sandhills or the empty spaces by
the sea."</p>

<p>"We thought of that," said the inspector, "but on the other
hand we argued he would try to get to his luggage before we could
find where he had left it. Remember, he had nothing but what he
stood up in, and no means of getting any materials for
disguise."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "You don't know Andrew, my boy. He is a
very fox in cunning and would have thought out every move you
could possibly make."</p>

<p>"Well," went on the inspector, "we located within two hours
where he had put up. He had got a room by himself at the Great
Central, and was quite the grand gentleman to judge by his
clothes. That's why we thought we should catch him; a well-dressed
man would not be able to obliterate himself as easily as
one in poor-looking clothes. We had got all his things for
making-up, too, and we knew he would be hard put to it to alter
his appearance in any way. They remembered him well at the office
of the hotel, and we got an excellent description from the
receiving clerk there."</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Larose, "that would be exactly six weeks
ago; six weeks now from the night when he escaped from
you,"&mdash;he looked thoughtfully at the inspector&mdash;"and
from that day to this you have never had the slightest inkling of
where he is hiding&mdash;no rumour or suspicion of any kind, no
traces in any direction?"</p>

<p>"Gilbert," said the inspector impressively, "for six weeks the
city has been put through a fine sieve; the whole time we have
had our eyes on every place possible where a man could hide, we
have watched every hotel, every lodging-house and every apartment
house. We have had everywhere in our minds, and yet&mdash;never
once have we had reason to think that we were near a
trail"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"the man is simply a
ghost that's all. He eats nowhere, he drinks nowhere, and he
sleeps nowhere. He only materialises when he commits a crime."
The inspector smiled drily. "But my great hope now is on a
porter's coat."</p>

<p>Larose looked at his watch and then stood up.</p>

<p>"Well, Mark," he said brightly, "we'll see now what we can do.
You know my eccentricity, old man, don't you? I always start off
from where the quarry was last seen. It gives me inspiration
somehow; it always does. So if you don't mind we'll go down to
Glenelg straight away." His voice dropped to an impressive tone,
"I want to see that house where the Smiter lived. I'm curious
about the environment of that evil man and I have it at the back
of my mind that somehow the wretch Andrew would have been curious
about it, too. Remember that there is sentiment even among the
beasts of crime, and between the Smiter and his associates, vile
as they were in our eyes, there was real affection and loyalty,
as you know. One thing more, if ever you see Andrew&mdash;shoot
on sight. No calling to surrender, no pity of any kind. Shoot on
the instant, for he's always got his finger on the trigger
himself. He's of that type of man who will deal out hell to
everyone around, and keep the last barrel for himself. Like the
recently departed J. A. Cloud, it's his obsession never to be
taken alive. Now come on."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; ANDREW, THE GARROTTER</h2>

<p class="first">EXACTLY at two o'clock that afternoon the
inspector and Larose met on the path just in front of the White
House. The detective was dressed now in ordinary clothes, but he
had deemed it best they should each come to the rendezvous by a
different way.</p>

<p>"Nice quiet little place this, Romilly," he remarked
interestedly, "quite the ideal spot for the headquarters of the
Smiter and his gang. Good thing you managed to break them up when
you did." He walked up to the garden gate. "Now you tell me the
place has been quite unoccupied since the departure of J. A.
Cloud?"</p>

<p>"Quite," replied the inspector, "and no one has been in it
except ourselves&mdash;myself and the Criminal Investigation lot,
I mean. Yale locks on both doors. Miss McIver passed over the
keys to me after the arrest and they have never been out of my
custody since. The place is just as it was when Cloud was living
here."</p>

<p>Larose thoughtfully took in the outside of the house. "H'm,"
he muttered, "one storey, with I suppose the usual four rooms;
pretty but quite ordinary and no one would ever dream the
dreadful history that it holds," he smiled grimly at the
inspector. "They ought to let in a tablet in the wall there,
Mark:</p>

<p>'HERE FOR ONE YEAR LIVED AN ENEMY OF THE HUMAN RACE.'"</p>

<p>"Very appropriate, I am sure," said the inspector drily, "and
it would add greatly to the selling value of the house. I'll
mention it to Miss McIver next time when I see her."</p>

<p>"So this is where the woman saw Andrew," went on Larose, "just
where I am standing now."</p>

<p>The inspector nodded. "She said he was just inside the
gate."</p>

<p>Larose looked up and down the road and then he shook his head.
"No, he would have turned off at once round the sandhills
somewhere," he remarked very quietly, as if he were speaking to
himself; "it would be harder going than the road, of course, but
he would be the sooner out of sight, and he didn't know at all
how much start he was going to get. I don't suppose he went very
far though, and as it was bright moonlight, he would probably
hide somewhere and watch the house." The detective turned round
sharply. "Well, come on, Romilly, let's go inside."</p>

<p>In a few moments they had unlocked the front door, and were
standing in the hall. The blinds were all drawn and the place was
in semi-darkness. The inspector closed the door behind them.</p>

<p>"Pshaw, what a smell of oranges," said Larose suddenly;
"didn't you take away all the food?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the inspector frowning; "the men were supposed
to have cleared it all out the next day."</p>

<p>They went into the front room, and the inspector pulled up a
chair and sat down at the table.</p>

<p>"This is where the wretch sat and watched the garage,
Gilbert," he said with a sort of shudder. "He'd sit here for
hours at a time with his binoculars and in the end it began to
get on our nerves. We thought any moment he might try a feeler on
us with his automatic."</p>

<p>But the detective made no comment. He was intently taking in
all the surroundings of the room and was picturing, in his mind,
something of the mode of life that the former tenant must have
lived.</p>

<p>"And here, no doubt, all his plans were made," he said
meditatively, after a long silence; "here he sat like some
venomous spider weaving his web, for instance, for that poor old
man opposite." The detective slowly shook his head. "Oh, if only
these walls could speak, Mark, and echo back his thoughts, how we
should shudder at the cruelty of the man! His was a dreadful mind
and he was Crime incarnate in a way."</p>

<p>They went over the house together and an awed silence came
upon them both. With all his sang-froid, the inspector wished
himself out in the road again.</p>

<p>They came finally to the kitchen and Larose settled himself
then into a well-padded and comfortable arm-chair. He smiled a
grim smile. "And here Martin no doubt often sat, too," he said
softly, "thinking perhaps of his own death as likely least of
all, and yet"&mdash;the detective took out his watch&mdash;"he's
been dead now exactly six hours."</p>

<p>The inspector frowned. He was not pleased at the reminder.
Hangings with him were by no means the ordinary affairs of life
and the ceremony that morning at the Stockade, in the early light
of the dawn, had left an uncomfortable impression upon his
mind.</p>

<p>The eyes of the detective roamed intently round the room.</p>

<p>"Hullo," he exclaimed suddenly, "who's been swatting flies?"
He got up at once and walked over to the window. He prodded with
his finger at some dead flies that lay&mdash;on the window-sill
and then, after quite a long while, it seemed, he returned
thoughtfully to his armchair and again renewed his scrutiny of
the room. The inspector leant against the dresser and yawned. He
was bored and he wanted to go.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;there was the sound of rustling by the
fireplace and a mouse came down the chimney. It ran out into the
room but catching sight of the two men, instantly wheeled round
and ran back up the chimney the way it came. It was down again,
however, in another second and this time, braving the inspector's
feet, it took refuge behind some cans in a corner of the kitchen.
At the same moment, a tiny fleck of plaster dropped from the
ceiling on to the floor.</p>

<p>A startled expression came instantly into Larose's face, one
almost of incredulous surprise. He dropped his eyes upon the
ground. For quite a minute then he remained motionless and then
suddenly he looked up at the inspector and began to talk very
quickly.</p>

<p>"You know, the Smiter was a most unusual man, Mark," he said
speaking loudly, "and in any profession would have made a name
for himself if he had gone straight. His intuition was really
wonderful and he was one of the finest judges of character I have
ever known. For instance, he went into a bank one day to cash a
cheque. He had never been near the bank before; there was a whole
row of clerks behind the counter at their desks and he just cast
his eye down them as they worked. It came out afterwards that he
was looking for a likely confederate inside the bank and
unerringly, in that one moment, he picked upon the one man who
was most likely to serve his ends. With no more ado, he made
overtures to him within twenty-four hours, as if he were quite
sure his advances would be accepted." The detective sighed. "Yes,
he recognised off-hand all the possibilities of a promising
criminal in that young fellow and yet for ten years the man had
been a most trusted servant at the bank. I'll tell you another
anecdote about old Cloud too, an amusing one this time."</p>

<p>Larose went on to recite another episode in the Smiter's
career, and then in the middle of it, but without interrupting
his speech, he stealthily took a pencil and a piece of paper out
of his pocket and quickly scribbled a few words. Very quietly he
pushed the paper across the table and the amazed inspector
read:</p>

<p>THIS HOUSE IS INHABITED, THERE'S SOMEONE ABOVE US IN THE
RAFTERS UNDER THE ROOF.</p>

<p>Larose went on talking, and then he motioned for the inspector
to push the paper back.</p>

<p>"Where's the trap-door leading to the roof?" he wrote next,
and he passed over the pencil as well this time.</p>

<p>"At the end of the hall," wrote the inspector, and the
correspondence closed when Larose added underneath. "Now you
talk&mdash;I want to think."</p>

<p>It was a queer comedy then that was enacted in the little
kitchen of the White House. Inspector Romilly, leaning carelessly
against the dresser, related laboriously all the happenings that
led up to the Smiter's arrest. He took plenty of time in the
narration, too, and it could hardly have been said that he
omitted anything at all relevant to the affair. But for the
greater part of the recital he had no audience, or no audience
that was visible, at any rate, for Larose had taken off his boots
and treading with the wariness of a cat had disappeared from the
room. For three&mdash;five&mdash;ten minutes he was away and then
just when the inspector was wondering how on earth the story
could be dragged out any longer, he tiptoed back and very quietly
resumed his foot gear.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Romilly," he said with a tired drawl, "you are an
admirable raconteur I am sure, and I could listen to it over and
over again, but I think we ought to be going now, there's a lot
to do when we get back. I've seen all I want to here."</p>

<p>He winked his eye and held out another slip of paper.</p>

<p>"Leave me behind," the inspector read. "I'm sure I'll get him.
I believe it's Andrew. Don't worry, but it may be a long wait;
perhaps until to-morrow, before he comes down."</p>

<p>Then the detective spoke quite loudly and very
impressively.</p>

<p>"But look here, Romilly, we must not be seen together, you and
I, and don't tell the Chief even that I am in the city. We'll
each go back by the same way we came and I'll meet you at
headquarters exactly two hours from now."</p>

<p>They walked noisily towards the hall door, and then Larose
plucked suddenly at the inspector's arm.</p>

<p>"Hand-cuffs," his lips framed rather than his voice whispered.
There was a moment's hesitation and then the inspector, with a
sceptical smile, abstracted a pair from his back pocket and
handed them over.</p>

<p>"Too impossible to be true," he whispered softly; he shrugged
his shoulders, "but then&mdash;you are Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>The front door was pulled open&mdash;there was some shuffling
of feet and the inspector, talking loudly to himself, went down
the garden path&mdash;alone.</p>

<p><br>
A silence then fell over the White House, and the flies
descended from the ceiling, and the mouse came out from behind
the cans. But it was not the silence of peace and rest, it was
not the silence of soft, gentle sleep, it was the silence of men
waiting&mdash;with Eternity behind the pressing of a trigger.</p>

<p>Up above the rooms of the house and upon a rough bed of sacks
just under the roof, was stretched a man. From head to foot he
was drenched in perspiration and the expression on his face was
one of mingled fury and dismay. His eyes were wide and staring,
and with his head low down against the laths, his ears were
strained to catch the slightest sound. With one hand he clutched
tightly to an automatic pistol, and the fingers of the other were
closed round a small tin box that he was carrying in his jacket
pocket. He was so still that it seemed he hardly breathed. He was
waiting, but&mdash;for what he was exactly waiting, even he
himself, with all his intensity of pose, could not have told.</p>

<p>And in the hall below another man was waiting, but he was
waiting confidently and with due regard to his convenience and
comfort. He had made himself a bed with some cushions in an
alcove just behind the front door, and he was stretched out, so
that his head just protruded sufficiently round the corner of the
alcove to allow of his eyes having full view of the trap-door in
the ceiling above. This man had an eager and expectant look upon
his face, but with all his eagerness, he was yet still, serene
and calm. Like the other watcher, he grasped an automatic pistol
with his right hand, but unlike him&mdash;from the expression of
his face at all events&mdash;he seemed to know exactly what he
was waiting for.</p>

<p>Half an hour&mdash;an hour&mdash;passed, and there was no
appreciable change in the positions of either of these two men.
One continued to lie with his ears strained, and the other
continued to stare with a gaze that never faltered upon the trap
door.</p>

<p>Slowly the afternoon passed, and the dusk of evening fell, but
still&mdash;one listened and the other watched. It was a duel of
two minds.</p>

<p><br>
Andrew, known as the Garrotter, was very much of the type of
man as described to the inspector by Gilbert Larose. A criminal
to the very tips of his fingers, he was a man, as has been said,
of great daring, and, in times of danger, of great resource. He
was also a man of some imagination, and delighted to pit himself
against the stereotyped procedure of the authorities with whom he
was always at war.</p>

<p>Upon the night when Burke and Masterton were surprised at the
White House, he was just about to walk up the garden path when
the cries of the former arrested him. He sensed instantly then
what had happened, but without losing his head, he turned at once
and walked calmly back on to the road. There, without hurrying,
he passed the woman and the two little boys. He saw they had been
attracted by the shouting and had stopped to see what it was. He
walked quite calmly by them, and then, confident that they were
giving no attention to him, he broke into a quick run. But as
Larose had afterwards surmised, he did not run very far. All
places in the vicinity he knew were equally as dangerous to him
and equally as safe, so in little more even than a hundred yards,
he turned off from the road on to the sand. He found a patch of
high grass nearby, and throwing himself down he proceeded coolly
to watch the house.</p>

<p>In a few seconds he saw the detectives rush down the garden
path and he heard them interrogate the woman as to which way he
had gone. But it was plain from her attitude that the woman could
tell them nothing; she looked round everywhere, and then he saw
her shake her head. He watched the detectives return reluctantly
to the house, and then, imbued with a sudden idea, he forsook his
hiding-place and, making a wide detour, boldly approached the
White House from the back. He crept over the fence into the yard
and standing on the windowsill was able to see over the blind
into the very room where the prisoners had been brought. He got a
close view of Inspector Romilly and the detectives, and as a
matter of pure routine, took careful stock of their appearances
for future guidance. He considered the number of them and
lovingly fingered the little automatic that he was carrying in
his pocket. He had half a mind to empty his pistol among them and
then chance it and run.</p>

<p>Presently he saw the prisoners taken away, and then the
departure of the detectives from the house. He waited until they
had all been gone about a quarter of an hour and then leisurely
forced one of the windows at the back and let himself into the
kitchen. Believing himself at any rate then safe for the night,
he lay down upon one of the beds and in a few minutes was fast
asleep. He was up, however, again in the early moments of the
dawn, and his first proceeding was to thoroughly explore the
house. It was in his mind that he might hide in it somewhere
until the hue and cry for him had at any rate partially died
down. He judged that of all places in South Australia, the White
House itself would be the very last one that the police would
search for him. He climbed up through the trap-door into the
roof, and making himself a bed between the rafters with some old
sacks, for thirty-six hours he alternately dozed and brooded away
the time. No one came near the house and no sign came to him from
the outside world.</p>

<p>The second evening at dusk he boldly left the house and went
in to Glenelg to buy some food. Then, having thought out his
plans, about midnight he broke into a suburban railway station
and stole, amongst other things some porters' clothes, returning
again across country to the White House during the night.</p>

<p>After that everything was easy for him, and clothed as a
porter in the regulation South Australian Railway uniform, from
henceforward he moved about everywhere exactly as he pleased.
Nobody questioned him, and nobody gave him a second look. He went
about the city free as air, had his meals regularly at different
eating-houses, and returned home every evening to the White House
to sleep. He never had a moment of anxiety or misgiving. He took
care however to keep as far away as possible from any railway
officials whom he saw.</p>

<p>Later, he made no attempt to get out of the city or the State,
indeed he was now staying on for a definite purpose. With the
vanity always associated with his type of criminals, he had
determined to show his contempt for the authorities generally by
revenging himself upon the four police officers who had been
primarily responsible for the arrest of his companions. He had
interestedly perused the daily newspapers, and the threats of
Burke during the extradition proceedings had appealed strongly to
his imagination. He brooded over the matter, and in a few days
the assassination of Inspector Romilly and the detectives became
quite an obsession. He learnt all their names from the
proceedings at the Police Court, and he easily got hold of their
home addresses from a perusal of the voting lists in the Public
Library. He killed the three detectives in the way already
described, but to get Inspector Romilly, he found a much more
difficult matter. Although, to all appearances, quite
contemptuous of any danger he might be in, the inspector was
nevertheless, however, leaving nothing to chance and three times,
almost in as many days, he changed his sleeping quarters. Also,
when he had to proceed out on business from the police
headquarters in Victoria Square, never by any chance, so Andrew
found, did he return by the same way. He always re-appeared from
an entirely different direction. Still Andrew had made up his
mind to get him, and he was quite confident it was only a matter
of time.</p>

<p>And this then was the position up to that afternoon when
Andrew, awaking from an afternoon slumber among the rafters of
the White House, heard to his annoyance the voices of Inspector
Romilly and Larose down in the hall below him.</p>

<p>For the moment he was only annoyed as he had no idea who
either of them were and he supposed without much interest that
they were just house-agents, or some people who had come from the
proprietor to look over the property. But, mixed up with unlawful
proceedings as he had been all his adult life, he was by habit
alert always to the possible proximity of any of his natural
enemies, the police, and he very quickly took on a graver view of
the situation, before even the interrupters had walked the whole
length of the hall, for one of them, it struck him, had the
unmistakable tread of a policeman.</p>

<p>Immediately then he crawled over the rafters and put his ear
down to the crevice of the trap door that led up through the
ceiling.</p>

<p>Almost at once he found his suspicions were justified. He
heard one of the men below talking about the Smiter and then the
other addressed the first speaker as 'Mark.'</p>

<p>"The inspector," he ejaculated to himself, his jaw dropped a
little, "and who's the other one now?"</p>

<p>He had not long to wait.</p>

<p>"Gilbert, my boy," he heard the inspector say.</p>

<p>"Gilbert!" hissed Andrew to himself, "Gilbert;" his jaw
dropped quite a lot this time, "not Gilbert Larose?"</p>

<p>An icy feeling ran down the garrotter's spine and his
automatic was out of his pocket in a flash.</p>

<p>Sweat stood out on his forehead in big beads and his heart
pumped like an engine at full speed.</p>

<p>"Gilbert Larose," he breathed hoarsely, "and he's come
here!"</p>

<p>Then some sort of reaction set in and he wiped the sweat from
his forehead with his sleeve. He smiled a sneering smile and
slipped the automatic back into his pocket.</p>

<p>"Plenty of time," he muttered thickly, "plenty of time, and
I'll get both of them before they get me."</p>

<p>He heard them go into the kitchen and he prepared to shift his
position towards the chimney where there was he knew a loose
brick that he could pull out. He must hear every word they said
now.</p>

<p>"Who's been swatting flies?" presently he heard Larose say,
and the sweat again came to his forehead.</p>

<p>"Yes, damn him," he swore savagely. "It's Larose; he's looking
about. Yes, it's Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>The ensuing half hour then was a terrible one for the listener
under the roof&mdash;terrible because of the suspense and
perplexity he was in. Rack his brains as he might, he could
determine in no way whether it was by chance or design, that
Larose was so near him now. From his former years in New South
Wales, he had a lively knowledge of Larose and, of all the
detectives in the Commonwealth, he had fear only for him. Callous
and hardened as he was to all the risks of criminal life, the
proximity of the Sydney detective now brought a cold shudder into
his heart. Larose had nearly caught him so many times; Larose
knew so much about him and his associates, and Larose had so
often fathomed the workings of their minds. And now this man was
close upon his tracks and within a few feet actually of where he
lay. He was certain too that Larose was devising something, for
why was he so silent in the room below and why was the
coarser-fibered inspector being left to do all the talking. Larose
was quick and alert he knew, and it was not like him to listen
uninterruptingly to a long story. He should be breaking in
continually; he should be asking questions, he should be cutting
the narrative short.</p>

<p>Yes, certainly, Larose was plotting something&mdash;he was
sure.</p>

<p>Then he heard Larose suddenly re-enter the conversation but
his suspicions were in no way allayed.</p>

<p>Andrew could be analytical as Larose himself, when he was in
danger, and it came to him instinctively that what the detective
was now saying did not ring quite true.</p>

<p>There was too much in his tones of the man who had just come
to some conclusion and who was masking his intentions in some
way.</p>

<p>In a few moments he heard them both apparently leave the house
and then, continuing to attempt to analyse the position, his
fears and perplexities increased four-fold.</p>

<p>What was going to happen now? he asked himself in a muck-sweat.
Was he trapped? Had Larose any suspicion that anyone was
hiding in the house? Had he seen any trace of anything in the
room below?</p>

<p>Andrew swore viciously under his breath. Curse this shaking of
his hands and the dry feeling that had come into his throat! But
how, after all, he suddenly asked himself, did he know that it
was Larose who had been there? Oh!&mdash;but it was Larose right
enough, he could be sure of that. No one but Larose could have
spoken of the Smiter as that man had done, and the fact alone
that the inspector had called him 'Gilbert' clinched the matter
there. Well, if it were Larose, that did not mean necessarily
that he was aware someone was above him under the roof. What
could there be now to have made him suspicious? Ah! but he had
asked, "Who's been swatting flies?" That meant something, of
course. To his cost, he knew something of Larose's mind.</p>

<p>Larose never asked idle questions, and there was
purpose&mdash;deadly purpose, always in his mind. Well, if the
dead flies had made him curious&mdash;what had happened after?
Had anything happened at all? What had Larose done next?</p>

<p>At any rate he had gone away&mdash;but ah! had he gone away?
There had been a lot of shuffling of feet by the front
door&mdash;too much shuffling, now he came to think of it, and
the inspector's voice, he remembered now, was the only one that
he had heard as they both were supposed to be walking down the
garden path.</p>

<p>Well, if Larose had not gone off with the inspector&mdash;he
must be waiting somewhere down below in the house and what would
he be waiting for then? Waiting for him to come down, of course,
so that he could plug him, and then deliver him over to the
police. The police! Ah! Perhaps the inspector had already gone
off for help and in a few minutes the house would be surrounded
and they would try to storm the place. Well&mdash;they would
never take him alive, anyhow, and he would not be by any means
the first to meet with death.</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on and his eyes blinked and blinked in the
perplexity that he was in, but always his ears were straining
towards the room below and always his hand was ready to the
automatic in his pocket.</p>

<p>Slowly the hours of the afternoon passed and then softly dusk
fell. Soon it grew quite dark under the roof and the blackness
and the silence there were those of the tomb.</p>

<p>Hour succeeded hour and still there was no movement anywhere
in the house. Towards midnight, however, Andrew changed on to his
other side and the faintest sound of his movement reached to the
ears of the watcher in the hall below. A smile then crossed over
the latter's face and with infinite care he lifted the safety
catch of the automatic that he was holding in his hand.
Undoubtedly he was expecting something to happen, for when about
a quarter of an hour had passed and everything had settled into
stillness again, he sighed disappointedly and returned the catch
of his pistol to the safety position.</p>

<p>The night crept on and the limbs of the detective became stiff
and cramped with cold. He had to chafe them continually to keep
some feeling in them, and it worried him a lot that it was only
with the greatest effort that he could continue to stare in the
direction where he knew the trap door in the ceiling was. He was
expecting now to see a speck of light there soon&mdash;the flash
of an electric torch.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Andrew had become gradually affected by the
pangs of thirst. He had drunk nothing since the previous morning
and the sweats that had bathed him had dried him up like a
sponge. He was not cold like Larose for a sort of fever had
seized him. The worries of his mind, too, were goading on his
body to uneasiness, and he wanted to twist and turn with every
moment as he lay. But he dared not move ever so little for if the
detective were below, he knew from the thin layer of plaster
between them how easily every sound would reach him. So he kept
himself immovable, and in time the very stillness began to
torment almost as much as the thirst. He cursed Larose
deeply.</p>

<p>Then, towards morning it began to come insistently to him that
he was a fool, that his fears were all imaginary and that in the
hall below there was no one there.</p>

<p>He put the idea away contemptuously at first&mdash;but it grew
upon him and, encouraged by his thirst and his bodily discomfort,
soon almost it had mastered his mind.</p>

<p>Yes, he was a fool, he swore; he had worked himself up into a
fever and he had no cause to fear. Just because he had killed a
few flies in the kitchen the previous morning, how could anyone,
even Larose, guess from that that it was he, Andrew, and that he
was then hiding under the roof.</p>

<p>Yes, the whole idea was preposterous and he had worried
himself for nothing. He would go down&mdash;he would get a drink
of water&mdash;he would&mdash;ah, but still he would give no
chances of being taken alive.</p>

<p>A minute later and in the gathering light of dawn he was
hitching a length of rope on to a short rail in the rafters,
preparatory to taking off the cover of the trap door. He was
still, however, holding a pistol in his right hand.</p>

<p>The detective felt sodden for want of sleep. For two nights
upon his journey from Sydney, he had been travelling in the
train, and now this third night he had never been able to so much
as close an eye. Bodily he was exhausted to the last degree, and
yet as a contrast&mdash;mentally, he was bright, confident and
extremely on the alert. It was the certainty that he was right
that was buoying him up.</p>

<p>Many times during that night he had figured it all up and
there was no doubt whatever in his mind that someone&mdash;and it
must be Andrew&mdash;was hiding above him in the roof.</p>

<p>To begin with, he told himself he had sensed the smell of
oranges directly he had come into the hall, and then afterwards
he had found no oranges or orange peel at all in the house. Now
the smell of an orange, he was quite aware, was only a matter of
at most a few hours. It was broadcast only whilst the orange was
being eaten and very quickly disappeared afterwards. So it had
come to him very early that someone had been visiting the house
and yet&mdash;yet the inspector had told him positively that he
alone had had the key. Then, he had noticed dead flies upon the
window sill in the kitchen and fresh fly-blood stains upon the
window itself. Also when he had touched the dead flies he had
found their bodies were quite soft and not dried up as they would
have been if they were even days old.</p>

<p>It was then he had begun to be really interested, for there
should have been no flies, he knew, in a house that had been
foodless and shut up for more than six weeks.</p>

<p>Next, when they had been talking the mouse had suddenly run
down the chimney, to be followed immediately by the falling of a
small fleck of plaster from the ceiling. The behaviour of the
mouse itself had been most significant. Something had frightened
it down from the chimney and when it had made to run back, the
same something had frightened it down again. That, coupled with
the falling fleck of plaster, had instantly suggested that
someone was moving across the beams above the ceiling with the
object probably of getting nearer to the chimney in order to
catch more plainly what was being said. Everyone was aware how
well the chimneys carried sound.</p>

<p>Then he had taken off his boots and, leaving the inspector
talking, had gone out from the kitchen for an investigation on
his own. He had soon found things that strengthened his
suspicions and made him sure that someone was making use of the
house. The pantry window had had the catch forced, and there was
distinct evidence that the fly-proof screen outside had recently
been many times taken in and out, for the edges were all rounded
and polished and there was no dust anywhere against the
sides.</p>

<p>Then he had noticed that the bath was not dry. There was water
about it that would never have been there after six weeks, indeed
it looked as if it had been made use of that very day and he was
almost certain, too, that he could smell soap, although there was
none to be seen anywhere about the place.</p>

<p>Then he had crept into the hall and stealthily inspected the
trap-door that led up into the roof. There was nothing unusual
about the trap-door itself, but there were distinct markings upon
the linoleum just underneath. "A pair of steps," he had instantly
ejaculated to himself, and he was of opinion from the impressions
on the floor that it had been used many times recently. In the
scullery, he had found the steps and approaching them for a close
scrutiny, his nostrils had again been instantly assailed by the
smell of oranges. There was no doubt about it; he had been
certain someone had eaten oranges within the last few hours.</p>

<p>Then he had gone outside round the house and at the back,
about a hundred yards away over the sand, he had seen a number of
seagulls busy by a small gully. Walking quickly up, he had found
they were raking over debris of food that had been buried just
underneath; some pieces of bread, the remnant of a stale cake and
orange peel galore. Some of the orange peel was quite fresh, and
with a beating of his heart he saw that it had been conveyed
there in a portion of a newspaper that was only three days old.
Lastly, he had unearthed a whole host of recently opened almond
shells.</p>

<p>"Andrew," he had gasped, for Andrew he knew was a vegetarian,
and it had been knocking subconsciously in his mind all along,
ever indeed since his first suspicions had been aroused, that of
all people it would best fit in with the cynical character of the
garrotter to make use of the house.</p>

<p>It would be just like Andrew, he had told himself, just like
the man's daring and resource and besides, besides&mdash;was not
this the very place near where the man had been last seen.</p>

<p>He knew so well the type of criminals which both the Smiter
and Andrew had always represented. They had never been weak,
frightened individuals to be stampeded into aimless directions
like bolting rabbits. They had shown themselves continually as
men of strong and purposeful character, and it would delight
Andrew, he knew, to be doing the very thing the authorities would
least of all expect.</p>

<p>He had returned stealthily to the house and then in a few
minutes, with the departure of the inspector, his long vigil had
commenced.</p>

<p>He had certainly expected things to move more quickly than
they had done, but when the night had finally settled down
without anything happening, he had comforted himself with the
reminder that the real psychological moment in one's thoughts was
always at the dawn.</p>

<p>It was when day was breaking that the reaction in the mind set
in. In darkness one could hold the easier to a fixed idea, but
with the coming of the shadows there was the tendency always for
everything to change, and, willingly or unwillingly, one had to
survey an outlook entirely different from that of the night.</p>

<p>So Larose was not in the least degree surprised when, just as
the lights were creeping grey and ghostly into the hall he heard
faint sounds of movement above the trapdoor in the roof.</p>

<p>On the instant he had risen to his feet and was crouching by
the wall. His stiffness disappeared as if by magic, his sense of
coldness had all gone, and if his face was damp and pale as
death, his eyes were, nevertheless, twinkling happily and his
lips were wreathed into a confident bright smile.</p>

<p>Things moved very quickly.</p>

<p>The top of the trap door was jerked off abruptly and a white
face was pushed down and turned sharply in every direction round
the hall. Then an electric torch was flashed and in a lightning
movement Larose was back in the alcove, with his ears, rather
than his eyes, now telling him what was happening in the
hall.</p>

<p>In about half a minute, however, the torch went out and
Larose, looking up again at the ceiling, saw suddenly a length of
rope drop down from the opening of the trap door and hang
dangling into the hall. The rope reached nearly to the floor and
was knotted at short intervals.</p>

<p>For a moment nothing happened and then a pair of legs were
thrust through the hole and a man began to lower himself quickly
down.</p>

<p>With a thrill Larose saw that the man was wearing trousers
with a red braid down the sides, the uniform of the South
Australian Railway.</p>

<p>The detective deliberately raised his automatic for, intending
to take no risks, he was about to render Andrew helpless, by
shooting him in the shoulder.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, there was a rattle on the floor followed by
a deep curse. Andrew had dropped the pistol he was carrying as he
was coming down.</p>

<p>A second later, however, and the malediction was merged into a
cry of terror, for the very instant he had reached the floor, his
legs had been knocked under him and with a fierce blow he had
been stretched upon his back.</p>

<p>Before he could recover or indeed in any way take in what was
happening to him, his wrists were next jerked together, there was
a sharp metallic click and he was lying handcuffed and helpless
at Larose's feet.</p>

<p>The detective was breathing hard with his exertions but there
was no particular expression of triumph upon his face as he
looked down at the prostrate man.</p>

<p>"I'm Larose," he said quietly, "and I've come all the way over
from Sydney to get you."</p>

<p>The prisoner, however, made no reply; he regarded him at first
with a dull stare and then, as his senses gradually came back,
with a look of hatred that was beast-like in its intensity.</p>

<p>"It's lucky for you," went on the detective pleasantly, "that
you did drop your pistol, for I should have shot you myself
before you reached the ground. I was taking no chances, and I
know you, Andrew, my boy."</p>

<p>Andrew glared at him and then his face broke into a cunning
smile.</p>

<p>"No, you don't," he said sneeringly, "you're a fool."</p>

<p>Larose shrugged his shoulders as if he knew he had the best of
the argument, and then he smiled, in his turn, but the nature of
his smile was different.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the expression on his face altered, for a
strange feeling of uneasiness had come into his mind.</p>

<p>Andrew was seemingly amused at something and there was a grin
almost of triumph now upon his face.</p>

<p>"What's he up to?" Larose asked himself; "goodness knows he's
not got much to laugh at, at any rate."</p>

<p>The garrotter had half closed his eyes; he looked
contemptuously at his captor and then suddenly he began to
fiercely clamp his jaws.</p>

<p>"I told you, you were a fool," he said hoarsely, "you've not
got me after all," and he spat out a piece of broken glass.</p>

<p>The detective bent down in consternation for the man's lips,
he saw, had suddenly become flecked with blood.</p>

<p>"Capsule&mdash;cyanide," grinned Andrew,
"never&mdash;be&mdash;taken&mdash;alive," and on the instant his
face became convulsed with pain. He grew ghastly white, his eyes
started from his head and his hands clawed in agony upon the
floor. His body writhed as if he were in torture and his chest
heaved frantically for breath.</p>

<p>A moan, a long deep moan, a moment's pause, a sigh, and then
with a shuddering jerk the head fell sideways and&mdash;the man
was dead.</p>

<p><br>
"But I couldn't help it, Mark," said the detective later, "I
had no chance. Andrew suspected all along that someone was
waiting for him there and he came down from the roof with the
capsule of cyanide ready in his mouth, in case he should find
himself in difficulties and unable to pull the trigger first."
Larose sighed deeply. "Yes, he was always a far-seeing man was
Andrew, but he wasn't a sport&mdash;he played with loaded
dice."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV. &mdash; THE PASSION YEARS</h2>

<p class="first">ONE morning about a month later at breakfast
time at Clyde House, Mr. Thomas McIver was feeling distinctly
annoyed; not that he showed it, however, for his niece was
sitting opposite to him and there were particular reasons why she
should not know he was disturbed.</p>

<p>The morning's letters had just arrived and there were two for
him. The first was from his solicitors announcing that, in the
interests of Miss Maude McIver, they had just negotiated for the
sale of a portion of the late Mr. Andrew McIver's landed
interests for the sum of &pound;118,000. The second was from Mark
Romilly and he wrote that he was shortly leaving South Australia
for good and would like to come and see them to bid good-bye. He
wondered if they were now at home at Glenelg.</p>

<p>He had resigned from the Police Force he said, and was joining
a relative upon a sheep station in New South Wales. He asked to
be very kindly remembered to Miss McIver.</p>

<p>Thomas McIver frowned angrily. Of course, he could see through
it, he told himself; the man only wanted to come down and see
Maude.</p>

<p>Thomas McIver was no fool, and ever since that evening when
Inspector Romilly had dined with them along with Sir Charles
Andover and Hiram Pellew, he had been anxious as to what his
niece might do. He had had a great shock that evening, and a
greater one, too, upon one of the days immediately following.</p>

<p>Before he left, his friend Pellew had been what he called
frank with him, and quite outspoken as to what was passing in his
mind. Indeed, much too outspoken, McIver had thought at the
time.</p>

<p>The morning the American had been going away, he had taken
McIver on to one side and had confided to him drily and with an
amused twinkle in his eye, that not only was Inspector Romilly
undoubtedly in love with his niece but also&mdash;and McIver here
had nearly had a fit&mdash;he was quite sure, that in return she
was in love with the inspector too.</p>

<p>McIver then, against his own instinct, for he had not been
unmindful of several little changes in his niece lately, had at
first been contemptuously incredulous, but his friend had snapped
his teeth together viciously and told him bluntly not to be an
old fool, but to just use his own eyes for himself; also, he had
added with a grin, that if he, Hiram Pellew, were any judge of
character, he was quite certain Maude would get her own way in
the end, even if she had to propose to the inspector herself. In
conclusion, he had given it as his deliberate opinion that it
would be quite an excellent match, and he had warned McIver with
some heat not to interfere and ruin his niece's whole life.</p>

<p>Pellew's words had worried the old man a good deal and, for
the first few days after his departure, every day he had been
expecting Romilly to be making some excuse to come up to the
house, but as the days and, finally, the weeks had passed and
they had heard nothing more of him, his fears had gradually begun
to die down.</p>

<p>Finally the danger was passed he told himself, and his niece
was safe. The man had gone out of her life and she might never
perhaps see him again. Any time, too, someone else might come
along and then once really in love, she would soon forget the
foolish fancy that she might have had. He had breathed in great
relief, for, of course, it was quite unthinkable that a girl with
all the money Maude was going to have, could marry a man with no
money at all, however nice and desirable he might be in himself.
And this &pound;118,000 was only a part of what the estate would bring.
The very idea was absurd!</p>

<p>Now, however, had come this letter, and it at once brought
everything back into the danger zone again.</p>

<p>Of course, he would have to make some excuse and put him off,
but then again, of course, he could not do so without mentioning
it to his niece first. He must be very diplomatic and very
tactful.</p>

<p>He glanced across the table at her. She was looking out of the
window and her thoughts were evidently far away, for the movement
he made in handing over one of the letters went unnoticed.</p>

<p>Critically he took in all the details of the beautiful face,
and with something of a pang he thought suddenly that she looked
ill.</p>

<p>She was certainly thinner than usual, and whiter, too, and
there were darker lines than there should be under her eyes. Then
the poise of her head was one of dejection, and there was sadness
and melancholy even in the way she sat.</p>

<p>In an instant then everything struck at him like a blow, and
the anger and annoyance that he had felt a moment before, melted
almost in the passing of a second to sympathy and regret.</p>

<p>"Damn it all," he said suddenly to himself in a complete
revulsion of feeling, "why after all shouldn't she have the man
she loves if he's her deliberate choice. What has money to do
with it? She has money enough for all they both can ever want.
What good are more thousands to her if her life isn't going to be
a happy one?" He thought of the little Californian girl, and
remembered he was growing old. Oh, how short life was and how
soon the grey days came! Dear, gentle Maud, and she was pining
now because she was without the lover that it was only natural
she should want to have. Hers was the very age for love. Not the
wandering, curious love of just awakened girlhood, but the calm,
reasoned love of a woman who would love with her head as well as
her heart, and to whom passion was the expression of her love and
not love itself. He was a fool to try and thwart her; instead he
would help her to her choice. He would have the man here, and in
closer intimacy she would be able to see it she were disappointed
or strengthened in her love.</p>

<p>Why hadn't he thought so about that before? It was really the
sensible thing to do. Maude was so refined and sensitive herself,
that very little would put her off the man if there were anything
rough or coarse about him.</p>

<p>That was why, he was sure, she had never taken to men
before.</p>

<p>He coughed loudly and rustled the papers.</p>

<p>"Maude, dear," he said, without looking up, "I have two
letters here, and both will interest you."</p>

<p>She turned languidly, with an almost audible sigh. "What is
it, uncle, lawyers' letters, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"One's from Brown and Riley; they've sold the Kingston estate
for &pound;118,000."</p>

<p>"What a lot of money!" again with a sigh. "What on earth shall
I do with it all?"</p>

<p>"Money's always useful, Maude," he replied; "you'll find some
use for it right enough. Then there's this other letter," and he
began very busily to stir his coffee. "It's from Mr. Romilly,
from Broken Hill. He wants to come down and see us to say
good-bye. He says he has left the police and is going on a station
in New South Wales."</p>

<p>There was a deadly silence for a moment and Maude got up to
attend to the urn.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Romilly!" she said quite steadily. "Yes, I heard he
had resigned from his position."</p>

<p>"He's coming to Adelaide in any case," went on her uncle, "but
here's his letter, read it. He asks to be kindly remembered to
you."</p>

<p>The girl took the letter and there was a long silence in the
room. Mr. McIver pretended to be busy with his newspaper but all
the time he kept a covert eye upon his niece. In appearance she
was quite cool and undisturbed.</p>

<p>She put down the letter presently and started interestedly
upon her breakfast.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, what shall we say?" asked the old man at
length.</p>

<p>The girl looked up quickly. "Why, ask him to come of course,"
she replied with a bright smile, "he was always very nice to us,"
and her uncle noticed with a glow of satisfaction that her sad
and dejected mien had all gone. For the remainder of the meal she
laughed and chatted in a manner very different from that of the
usual Maude of late.</p>

<p>He was convinced he was doing the right thing.</p>

<p>After breakfast they went out on to the verandah and stood
looking at the sea. A breeze was blowing down the gulf, but the
air was soft and balmy and something of the sweetness of life
came up to them both.</p>

<p>"I think, I think," said old McIver meditatively, at length,
"we had better ask that young man for a weekend, if he can come.
Say from next Friday to the Monday. It will be interesting to
hear all his adventures with the great Gilbert Larose. Don't you
think so, dear?"</p>

<p>The girl looked straight out to sea where the rippling waters
were.</p>

<p>"Just as you like, uncle," she replied very quietly. "If you
think it best."</p>

<p>Was there a tremor in her voice he thought, or was it just the
hesitation natural to her considering?</p>

<p>Affectionately she took her uncle's arm and some impulse made
him bend down and kiss her on the forehead. She smiled up
brightly at him, and then suddenly without a word she threw both
arms round his neck and buried her face in his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Dear little woman," he said fondly, pretending not to notice
anything. "I often think your nerves are all unstrung. I must
take you for a long sea-voyage some day. But just you go and
write that invitation to Mr. Romilly now and I'll post it
straight away when I am up in the city."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter was very angry when she heard the invitation had
been sent.</p>

<p>"Really, Thomas," she said sourly to her brother when they
were alone. "Sometimes I think you're almost a fool. Fancy asking
that man down here to stay. Can't you see what's in his mind?
He's in love with Maude. I saw it the instant he came here to
dinner that night. All his clothes were new: he'd bought them
purposely for the occasion. Fancy a policeman with a dress suit!
I don't care whether he was a major in the army or not. He was a
policeman when he came here and that's enough. I shall snub him
unmercifully when he comes, and put him in his proper place at
once; and I'm sure, if I know anything of Maude, she will do so,
too."</p>

<p>Thomas McIver said nothing, but he smiled a slow, inscrutable
smile. He wondered what exactly was going to be Mark Romilly's
proper place.</p>

<p><br>
A feeling of amazing happiness thrilled through Mark Romilly
when he received the letter from Clyde House. He had certainly
hoped they would ask him to call at the house, but he had never
for one moment dreamed that he would be invited to stay there,
and the significance of the invitation made him almost giddy in
surprise. What did it mean? he asked himself. The McIvers, as far
as their home life was concerned, were most particular people.
Why were they asking him now to stay with them in this easy way,
just as if he were a friend of the house? Really he was only an
acquaintance at best. True, he had been to dinner with them once,
but that had been more of an invitation of duty he felt sure. He
had been simply asked up then as a small return for the part he
had played in the Andy McIver case, and just to be quietly given
the cheque. But this visit would be quite different and there was
no question at all of duty or obligation about it. There was
intimacy about it, as if they were willing to regard him as a
friend. What could have happened since he last saw them? Was
it&mdash;could it be&mdash;and his heart beat furiously and he
crimsoned hotly at the thought&mdash;was it miraculously possible
that some part of the feeling he himself had for Maude McIver,
she on her side also had for him? Could it be she who had
suggested that he should be asked to stay for the week-end?
Surely it was hardly possible: the circumstances of her riches
placed her so much above him. It was not that he had no opinion
of himself, and had had no success in his life with the other
sex. He had had several love affairs, and the other sex generally
had not been particularly averse, when he had imagined, for the
time, he was in love with them.</p>

<p>But with Maude McIver it was quite different. She was holy in
his sight, and more an angel than a woman to be loved. It was
worship almost that he felt for her. Still&mdash;and he was
thoughtful for a long while&mdash;still ... .. Maude was a woman
after all and pure and heaven-faced though she was, one
day&mdash;one day&mdash;she would close those beautiful eyes of
hers&mdash;tilt up that proud, reliant chin and give to the
tingling fire of passion, the purity and sweetness of those
lovely lips. Yes&mdash;she was only a woman after all.</p>

<p>But old Thomas McIver&mdash;why had Thomas McIver asked him?
The old man least of anything was not a fool. He was a shrewd and
level-headed man of the world. There could be no sentiment about
him. He would understand the danger of any single man being
thrown much in contact with his niece. She was beautiful
undeniably&mdash;and rich, and anyone at any time might fall in
love with her and try to engage her love in return.</p>

<p>Certainly then it would be his aim to keep all undesirables
away, and if he admitted anyone into the charmed circle of their
home&mdash;then, again, he would do so clearly with the idea that
the intruder was not one of the black sheep to be purposely kept
out.</p>

<p>For a long, long while before replying to the invitation the
late inspector of the Adelaide Police pondered, and pondered
again. Then the solution flashed on him suddenly. Something had
happened, he told himself, to bring him forward into Mr. McIver's
mind, and the old man had invited him to stay at the house to
make sure what sort of man he was like. In other words, he was
going to be put on his trial.</p>

<p>Mark Romilly whistled to himself and the next moment was very
angry that he could really be so vain as to imagine that Mr.
McIver could be particularly interested in him in any way at
all.</p>

<p><br>
The following Friday afternoon Mark Romilly arrived at the
McIvers' just in time for the afternoon cup of tea. There were
several callers in the drawing-room, and Maude McIver was
presiding daintily over the tea. She gave him a friendly little
greeting, with perhaps just a trace of heightened colour, and
then waved him to a vacant chair that happened to be next to Mrs.
Carter.</p>

<p>He smiled grimly to himself when the latter lady gave him a
short and curt "Good-day," but at the same time he was certainly
not displeased at the early and opportune encounter. Indeed, it
was exactly what he wished.</p>

<p>He was still convinced that in some subtle sort of way he had
been invited up to Clyde House on trial, and, if that were so, he
argued there were going to be three people who would be his
judges and whom he would have to win over&mdash;Maude, Mr.
McIver, and Mrs. Carter.</p>

<p>Maude&mdash;well he hoped and prayed Maude was favourably
disposed to him already. Mr. McIver he put down as neutral and
prepared justly to judge him on his own merits. But Mrs. Carter
was hostile&mdash;decidedly hostile, and so she must be won over
without delay.</p>

<p>She was nursing a little parti-coloured Pomeranian, and he was
able to tell her at once with strict truth that the animal was a
beautiful little creature.</p>

<p>He leant over and stroked the dog, asked about his breeding,
and pointed out the good points that he had inherited from his
aristocratic ancestors.</p>

<p>He knew something about Poms fortunately, and Mrs. Carter was
soon convinced that he was worth listening to. In spite of
herself, she was attracted to him, and long before the callers
had taken themselves away, her voice had lost some of its
acerbity.</p>

<p>"But how do you come to know anything about Poms Mr. Romilly?"
she asked curiously. "I thought you men were never interested in
these little dogs."</p>

<p>"Oh, really that's quite a mistake! But I happen to be
particularly interested in Poms because the man who lived next
door to me at Prospect was the chief breeder in South Australia.
He had Poms all over the place, and I was always returning stray
ones to him over the garden fence. I got to know the good points
of them that way."</p>

<p>Mr. McIver came into the room at that moment and raised his
eyebrows just a little when he saw the two heads close
together.</p>

<p>"Great Jupiter," he ejaculated whimsically to himself, "what
if the aunt should cut the niece out. I never thought of
that."</p>

<p>It was a cosy little dinner that night with only the four of
them, and Romilly made further advance into the good graces of
the elder lady. She was an inveterate gambler of the half-crown
type at the racecourse tote, and if she was not going to the
races herself, always, nevertheless, managed to get someone to
put the money on for her instead. For the past few Saturdays it
appeared she had been heavily supporting&mdash;her brother smiled
and looked highly delighted here&mdash;a beast called Ragtime,
and each time the wretched animal had let her down badly. They
would only have just got about four to one, even if it had come
in first, but not only had it not come in first, but it had run
so extremely badly that at last in despair they and everyone else
interested had left off backing it. Then, of course, the
inevitable thing had happened. It had simply romped in first, and
paid over twenty to one in dividend.</p>

<p>Romilly agreed with her that it was a scandal and a shame.</p>

<p>"But what are the Stipendiary Stewards doing?" asked Mr.
McIver with a twinkle in his eye. "When my sister has heavily
supported any animal, they ought, of course, to be specially
vigilant to make sure it is run fairly."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't laugh Thomas," replied Mrs. Carter tartly.
"Everybody knows we can't get the class of men we ought to for
Stipendiary Stewards. They're a mistake altogether."</p>

<p>All this while Maude was serene and happy. Every time Mark
Romilly was speaking to the others it gave her the opportunity to
watch his face. What a fine strong face it was, she thought. He
looked so handsome and such a gentleman, too.</p>

<p>She preferred not to join in any of the conversation but was
quite content to listen and enjoy her own thoughts. Oh, how
dreadful if anyone should guess what those thoughts were! She
pondered, however, if someone in the room would one day know
them. Somehow she thought he would. She could feel he was
interested in her, although he did not glance much at her. But
she saw him several times looking down at her hands out of the
corner of his eye, and once for quite a long time his glance
rested on her arm and shoulder.</p>

<p>Mr. McIver, too, was quietly analysing his guest. He had drawn
him out on several subjects, and found him interesting and
well-informed. Pressed for some details of his life on active
service, the one-time major had given them a thrilling picture of
some happenings in the war. Without in any way boasting or making a
lot of things he had brought home to them the dreadful times they
had been through. He made little of what he had done himself, but
to all of them he gave the impression of the quiet, fine courage
of the soldier.</p>

<p>They went into the garden for a few minutes after dinner, and
quite naturally the two younger people wandered on alone. They
were silent for a minute, but of the two the girl was by far the
more self-possessed.</p>

<p>It was she who first broke the silence.</p>

<p>"I had no idea, Mr. Romilly," she said archly, "that you were
really such an authority on dogs. I'm sure you've quite won over
my aunt's heart by your admiration of Ko-Ko this evening."</p>

<p>Mark Romilly coughed moderately. "Knowledge is always useful,"
he replied guardedly, "and the young lady you now refer to as
Ko-Ko certainly has some very good points about her."</p>

<p>The girl opened her eyes very wide. "But I thought you said,"
she went on laughing, "she would deserve a prize anywhere."</p>

<p>"Certainly, undoubtedly she would, but whether the hard-hearted
judges would give her one is quite a different matter.
You see I was only putting everything in the best light
possible."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Romilly, I believe you're a fraud. I shall really
begin to be half afraid of you."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid," he exclaimed fervently, "the fear is on my
side. Your sex always frighten me. Witness my desire to stand
well with Mrs. Carter to-night."</p>

<p>They came to the end of the garden and instinctively both
halted by the trellis where the rose-trees were. Tacitly no
reference had been made to the former tenant of the White House,
but a chord of memory was now stirred in them both.</p>

<p>"I won't suggest a rose for you," she said demurely; "it's
never well to pick them at night."</p>

<p>"I don't want one yet," he replied pointedly, "I'm not going
until Monday."</p>

<p>She resumed her steps at once with this and they returned
slowly to the house.</p>

<p>The next day was one that would be always remembered by Mark
Romilly as a red-letter day in his life, for it was then that he
first realised decisively that Maude McIver might not after all
be beyond his reach.</p>

<p>She was almost constantly near him the whole day long. In the
morning they went for a long walk upon the sands. Mr. McIver
brought Vulcan out with them for exercise, and as he was
apparently far more interested in the big boar hound than in his
two companions they were consequently left very much to them
selves.</p>

<p>They talked confidingly together as if they were old friends,
and he told her a great deal of the happenings of his life. He
glanced at her a lot when he was talking, and very often their
eyes met in a deliciously sympathetic sort of way. A hundred
times he though to himself how beautiful her eyes were, but in
her face, with all its sweetness, there was such a wealth of
pride that she almost overawed him, and once or twice he was
quite frightened to remember that he had dared to fall in
love.</p>

<p>Maiden in every dainty way she was so obviously, and it would
be almost wicked, he told himself, to quicken answering love in
her. It would be like robbing the unpicked flower of its
fragrance or the untouched peach of its bloom.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mr. McIver took them for a drive among the
hills in the car.</p>

<p>"You will sit at the back with my aunt, Mr. Romilly," said the
girl, with a sly smile. "She is bringing Ko-Ko with her and so
both of you will be quite happy. You can be instructing aunt how
to prepare Ko-Ko for the next show. She is most keen now on
entering her."</p>

<p>Romilly made a little grimace of disappointment, but Mrs.
Carter at that moment coming out, he gallantly escorted her to
the car, and for the first part of the drive was intensely bored
by having again and again to enumerate the outstanding good
points of the wretched Pomeranian Ko-Ko.</p>

<p>Maude McIver, however, apparently enjoyed it all. Sitting just
in front she could, of course, hear most of what was being said,
and from time to time, her slim and elegant shoulders quivered in
real appreciation of the fun.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Carter began to complain that she was getting
too much wind, at the back, and with just a little hesitation,
her niece very obligingly offered to change places with her.</p>

<p>Henceforward the drive then was all a Paradise to Romilly. The
girl was close by him and sometimes when the car swayed among the
narrow turnings in the hills, for the fleeting seconds, he could
feel the touch of her lithe body next to his. Once under the
outspread rug their hands met accidentally, but she moved hers
away casually as if quite unaware of the fact. They touched again
in a minute or two, however, and this time at once, for a moment,
he imprisoned the soft warm fingers in his own. Only for a
moment, however, and she had quickly drawn her hand away.</p>

<p>For a little while then he was afraid to look at her, but
feeling her eyes upon him he glanced up suddenly and saw that she
was smiling and frowning at the same time, but with no appearance
of annoyance on her face. She only shook her head reprovingly at
him, and made a little meaning nod in the direction of the
unsuspicious aunt sitting just in front.</p>

<p>He smiled back in understanding, and for the rest of the drive
had to content himself with furtively regarding her out of the
corner of his eye. For her part she had folded her arms and lay
back looking straight in front of her.</p>

<p>No doubt she was thinking of what had just happened, but from
the expression of her face her thoughts were not unhappy
ones.</p>

<p><br>
It was the Sunday evening and they were walking slowly round
the garden the last thing before going to bed. Romilly had been
telling her his plans for the future and she had been listening
happily with her face upturned to his. Suddenly a silence fell
upon them as if they had nothing more to say.</p>

<p>Reaching the drawing-room windows she stopped before them in
the light.</p>

<p>"Well, good night," she said, with a sudden shyness. "I'll
leave you to your cigarette. I must be going in now."</p>

<p>"Oh, just once more round." he pleaded.</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment and then without replying, resumed
her walk. They were still silent, but it was the silence of
tender and caressing thoughts.</p>

<p>There was only the star-light above them but in their hearts
were lights that shine surely from another world.</p>

<p>So, they walked round the garden and, reaching the house
again, she stopped as she had done once before. But this time she
stopped in the shadows.</p>

<p>"Good night," she said very quietly, holding out her hand.</p>

<p>"Good night," he replied softly, taking it in his own.</p>

<p>So for a moment they stood, each looking down. He with his
eyes upon her face&mdash;she with her eyes upon the ground.</p>

<p>Suddenly she looked up and in an instant she was in his arms.
He had seen something in her face that had told him surely what
he might do. Tenderly, very tenderly, he tilted up her chin, just
as he had told himself in his dreaming that one day he would do.
She closed her eyes, and gently, very gently he put his lips on
hers.</p>

<p>She shivered violently and almost a cry escaped her. He
pressed her tightly to him, and then suddenly with a great sigh,
released her from his arms. She ran quickly into the house.</p>

<p>It was fully a quarter of an hour or more before Romilly went
into the house. Mr. McIver was standing by the dining-room
door.</p>

<p>"Come in and have a drink," said the old man, looking hard at
him over his glasses.</p>

<p>They sat down and for a little while there was silence between
them.</p>

<p>"I hope you've enjoyed your visit," said Mr. McIver at length.
"I'm sure we've been very pleased to have you."</p>

<p>Romilly replied how he had enjoyed himself and expressed his
appreciation of their kindness. Then again the silence fell.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy," said Mr. McIver in a moment, "you seem to have
got on very well with my niece." He went on grimly&mdash;"She is
a very rich woman, Miss McIver. I expect you understand
that."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," assented Romilly very quietly. "I quite expected
so."</p>

<p>"But then of course," said the old man drily, "money doesn't
count with you. A man who refuses two thousand pounds for nothing
must be pretty contemptuous of the advantages of hard cash."</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't rub that in," laughed Romilly; "it was hard
enough to refuse without the soreness of being reminded of
it."</p>

<p>"Well, I told you at the time you were a fool, but come now,
why didn't you take it? Be honest with me now. Was it because of
Maude? Was it a matter of sentiment with you?"</p>

<p>Romilly took a long thoughtful puff at his cigarette.</p>

<p>"It might have been partly that," he said slowly. Then he went
on warmly. "At any rate it gave me more pleasure to refuse than
to accept, and honestly I should do so again. That's truth."</p>

<p>The old man eyed him narrowly.</p>

<p>"Then I suppose you've fallen in love with Miss McIver,
haven't you?" he said brusquely.</p>

<p>Romilly was very calm and deliberate.</p>

<p>"Your niece is a lovely woman, sir," he replied, "and I should
be no man if I had not."</p>

<p>Mr. McIver was thoughtful again. "I like you, Romilly," he
said quite kindly at length, "or I shouldn't have asked you up
here. But it's a great matter to protect my niece. No, no, man,"
he went on quickly, "I'm not your enemy and I'm not against you.
Beyond certain limits it's not for me to interfere. I know it's
the girl's own affair, but I'm only anxious she should get
happiness in her life. But come, let us leave it for the present.
Help yourself to some whisky and tell me about your future
plans."</p>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; MARK JERVIS ROMILLY</h2>

<p class="first">BREAKFAST-TIME at Clyde House the next morning
was not without its embarrassments for three of the four people
seated at the table, and it was only Maude McIver herself who
seemed entirely at her ease.</p>

<p>Mr. McIver was thoughtful, and curious as to how far his niece
and Romilly had committed themselves together the previous day;
Mrs. Carter was in a bad humour because of an attack of
rheumatism that she was sure was coming on, and Romilly himself
was nervous that perhaps he had been too forward the previous
evening and had lost ground with the woman that he loved, for
with the morning light, the presumption of his intending to ask
her to be his wife, seemed, to say the least of it, to be a
staggering one.</p>

<p>But Maude herself was radiant, and the three others at the
table there wondered each in their own several ways if anywhere
there could be a brighter or a happier looking girl than the one
now sitting before them.</p>

<p>Romilly regarded her in the way a lover always does before his
happiness is assured&mdash;admiring, almost reverential and with
eyes of hungry longing. Mr. McIver smiled grimly to himself with
just a touch of sadness in his heart that the sweet white rose
was now so openly unfolding her petals, and Mrs. Carter wondered
rather sourly what on earth the girl had done to make herself so
pretty.</p>

<p>The meal over, they went into the garden, and Mrs. Carter,
whose animosity against Romilly had seemingly all returned, did
her utmost to make herself as disagreeable as possible.</p>

<p>She asked interestedly as to what time his train was going,
and she supposed, pointedly, that he would not be down in the
city again for some years. She gave it as her opinion, too, with
a significant glance at her niece, that probably some very great
changes would have eventuated before they would all be meeting
again and, finally, she advised him strongly to marry, for he
would find it hard, she said, to cook and manage on his own.</p>

<p>A deep flush of annoyance came into Maude McIver's face, but
Romilly himself took it all in good part and smiled as if in
amusement, when once he happened to catch the girl's eye.</p>

<p>Presently, to the great relief of the others, Mrs. Carter took
herself back into the house and then, as Romilly had not to leave
for some hours, Maude suggested a short walk along the sands.</p>

<p>Mr. McIver at once sportingly made an excuse for not coming
and so, in a few minutes, it was Maude and Romilly alone, who
were pacing slowly by the weaves.</p>

<p>In after-days Romilly always said that that walk was a very
miserable one for him for he had been no longer in a mood to
appreciate that he was alone with Maude.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his own self-reliant nature, his assurance had
been chilled violently by the remarks of the girl's aunt. It was
quite obvious what she meant to imply, and although he had no
opinion at all of her ideas, still she had undoubtedly revived to
great strength in him the recognition of the inequality between
his own position and that of Maude.</p>

<p>Was it colossal impudence, he now asked himself, that he
should be daring to ask her to be his wife?&mdash;She, a
well-endowed heiress and he, quite a poor man. There would be some
people who would always say he had come after her money, and if
fortune so greatly favoured him that Maude returned his
affection, there would still be always those who would sneer at
her that she had not been married for love. Could he, too, make
up to her for the other sneer that she had married a man who had
once been in the police?</p>

<p>His mind was in uncertainty and he wanted time to think.</p>

<p>His meditations were interrupted.</p>

<p>"You're very quiet, Mr. Romilly," said Maude with a smile. "I
hope your thoughts are pleasant ones."</p>

<p>Romilly sighed and then he smiled too.</p>

<p>"I've known better-and worse," he replied enigmatically, and
then he at once rallied himself, and went on to talk interestedly
about the beautiful view before them and the sea. Apparently, his
previous meditations had been quite trivial and casual ones.</p>

<p>But the girl was not deceived. She had guessed something of
what was passing in his mind and she wanted to make up for her
aunt's coldness and clear away the impression that her relative's
remarks might have made.</p>

<p>Hiram Pellew had not been a bad judge of character when he had
surmised that with all her gentleness and pride, love would give
Maude McIver courage and make her bold. Notwithstanding her
bright appearance at the breakfast-table that morning, she had
slept little the previous night and, being under no
misapprehension as to Romilly's feelings towards her, it was in
her mind to make it easy for him to ask her to be his wife. She
knew that she herself was willing, and she was determined that no
consideration of money, or the want of it, should debar them from
the happiness that she was sure might now be theirs.</p>

<p>So she laid herself out to be encouraging to him, and during
the next half-hour Romilly realised to the full then, if indeed
he had never done so before, how gracious and tender she could
be.</p>

<p>She asked him interestedly about the possibilities of his new
life and she looked him frankly in the eye as she spoke.</p>

<p>She thanked him prettily for his kindness to them in the great
trouble they had been in, and she told him frankly that both she
and her uncle would be very sorry now if he went out of their
lives. For herself, she said, she was quite disappointed he was
going away.</p>

<p>But it was all to no purpose. She had reckoned without the
chivalry of Romilly and the new-born determination on his part
that she must not be precipitated suddenly into any position she
might afterwards live to regret. He must have time to think, he
kept on telling himself, he must have time to think.</p>

<p>So he fenced lightly with her and persistently relegated the
personal equation into the background. He did not dare to look
much at her, however, and many times he groaned inwardly and
wondered if he were both a coward and a fool.</p>

<p>The girl was very puzzled at his attitude and could not
understand.</p>

<p>The walk ended at last and they returned to the garden of
Clyde House. Just inside the gate they met Mrs. Carter and Major
Poole, the major was gallantly escorting that lady to a sheltered
spot on the sandhills where she would be out of the wind.</p>

<p>The two men stopped to speak for a moment, and Mrs. Carter
seized the opportunity to sidle up to her niece.</p>

<p>"Keep him at his distance, Maude," she whispered. "He never
takes his eyes off you, when you are not looking, and if you're
not careful he'll propose," she nodded her head viciously. "I
believe the only thing that's kept him back so far is that he
knows he's got no money."</p>

<p>The girl looked at her coldly but made no remark, and Major
Poole having now finished his good-byes, the two couples again
went on.</p>

<p>Romilly and Maude passed down to the end of the garden along
by where the rose trees were, and suddenly the girl made up her
mind. They were quite by themselves now and out of view of all
the windows of the house. She stopped and faced her companion.
Her heart was beating furiously, but she smiled easily with a
happy smile. She had plucked a little Gloire de Dijon, and she
held it out now to him, in a beautiful white hand.</p>

<p>"Isn't it lovely?" She asked innocently.</p>

<p>"Yes, lovely," replied Romilly gravely, and for the moment
taken off his guard. "I've always thought it was."</p>

<p>Maude coloured up. She smelt the rose and brushed it lightly
over with her lips, then she held it out towards him once
more.</p>

<p>"Well, you can take it," she said ever so softly, "that is of
course, if you want to."</p>

<p>Romilly got as white as a ghost, but he reached out quickly
and took both the hand and the rose.</p>

<p>"Which may I have?" he asked hoarsely in a low whisper and
looking her straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>There was a long silence and then Romilly suddenly
straightened himself up and let her hand go.</p>

<p>"You're a rich woman, Maude," he said gently, "and I&mdash;am
a poor man," and with a grave bow he made as if to turn away.</p>

<p>But Maude laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Riches don't count always, Mark," she whispered, "and the
richest woman may be the poorest if she's not brave enough to
take love when it comes her way," and her voice choked as if she
were going to cry.</p>

<p>For perhaps one second Romilly hesitated, but it was
impossible now for him not to understand. With a great beating at
his heart, he slipped his arm around her and pulled her to his
side. Her head came to his shoulder unresistingly and for a long,
deep moment he looked passionately into her eyes.</p>

<p>Her lips parted to a long-drawn sigh and then closed
shiveringly as he bent to meet them with his own.</p>

<p>It was the moment to them&mdash;of both their lives, and love
in all its glory overflowed to them in that kiss, it was a kiss
of ecstasy, a kiss of rapture and yet a kiss so reverent and so
gentle that, but for its length, it might have been no kiss at
all.</p>

<p>Oh, love of man for maid, oh, love of maid for man. Lode-star
of life and mystery of all years. Was ever Heaven nearer to us
and was ever Earth more lovely, than when the swoon of passion
held us and we wandered in the garden of Desire?</p>

<p><br>
About an hour later coming in from the garden Mrs. Carter saw
Romilly opening the door of the garage.</p>

<p>"So," she remarked gleefully to her brother whom she
encountered the next minute in the hall, "Mr. Romilly's going off
before lunch, is he? . . . I see they're getting out the car;"
she laughed knowingly. "I thought he looked very dejected when we
met them a little while ago, but I knew," and the laugh became
almost spiteful here, "I knew that Maude would soon put him in
his proper place."</p>

<p>Thomas McIver looked thoughtfully at his sister and for just a
moment, perhaps, the very faintest flicker of a smile crossed
into his face. Then he sighed gently.</p>

<p>"Well, they'll be married in less than two months, Elizabeth,"
he said quietly. "They've gone off now to the city to buy the
engagement ring, but they'll be back in time for lunch."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carter, mute in the stalemate of her own emotions, sank
into a nearby chair.</p>

<p><br>
A few weeks later, one evening towards dusk, a big grey car
was speeding along the coast road under the cliffs towards Cape
Jervis. It is a lonely desolate road at all times and for many,
many miles the seagulls are the only signs of life. There were a
man and woman in the car and from the amount of luggage piled up
at the back it might quite reasonably have been assumed that they
were out on tour. A close observer, however, would have noticed
at once that there was something quite unusual both about the car
and its occupants. Everything about them was apparently quite
new. The car particularly would have arrested the eye. The enamel
on it was quite unscratched and without a blemish anywhere, the
upholstery was quite beautiful in its freshness, the bonnet
mirrored back exactly all the subtle shades of land and sky and
the very tyres themselves seemed new and quite unworn. One might
have almost thought that the car had just been bought, or given
as a present. A wedding present perhaps. Then, too, the leather
trunks looked new and one could have sworn that the very straps
were stiff and hard and would be difficult both to fasten and
undo.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a car that, quite apart from its occupants,
would have arrested attention anywhere.</p>

<p>But the man and woman were interesting too. They looked so
happy together, and all the time they seemed to be smiling and
looking at each other. Notwithstanding the care needed to
negotiate successfully the narrow, winding road, the man's eyes
never for long left the woman's face, and when he turned, her
eyes were always waiting to meet his.</p>

<p>The woman was certainly very pretty and something had given to
her face quite a lovely flush. Her eyes were sparkling brightly
and she looked as sweet and happy as if there were no pain nor
sorrow in all the world.</p>

<p>Altogether the car was in every way a car of joy and happiness
and no one would ever have dreamed that misfortune was hovering
so near. Yet so it was.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;there was a loud, crashing sound. The car
bumped roughly and tilting all on to one side swerved violently
across the road. With a great effort the driver turned it
straight again, and then, with a jar that shook both occupants
unpleasantly, brought it ingloriously to a standstill.</p>

<p>"Not hurt, darling," exclaimed Romilly anxiously, for it was
he who was driving the car, "not hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, dear," replied his wife brightly, "not a bit, but what's
happened now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much, only the axle broken I expect, but I don't mind
that so long as you're not hurt," and, helping her out of the
car, he kissed her tenderly as she stepped down.</p>

<p>"Oh, damn," he said, a moment later. "Beg pardon dear; yes,
we're snookered right enough, axle gone to the pack. Now, Mrs.
Romilly, what are we going to do?"</p>

<p>The girl laughed a bright silvery laugh. "What an adventure
for our first day of married life! It's quite thrilling, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Too thrilling for me," he replied grimly, taking out his
watch. "Here we are&mdash;a quarter to five, miles from anywhere,
absolutely helpless and it'll be dark in half an hour. Looks like
rain, too."</p>

<p>But the girl was still smiling. "Never mind, dear, nothing
matters on a day like this. But, oh, look, there's smoke over
there among the trees."</p>

<p>He turned quickly to the direction in which she was
pointing.</p>

<p>"By Jove, what a bit of luck, and I'd have sworn we were ten
miles at least from a house anywhere. We'll go at once and see
what's doing. We may be able to send for help, although I'm
afraid there's not much chance. If not, perhaps they may be able
to put us up."</p>

<p>Less than a hundred yards from where they were standing, the
cliffs fell away for a short distance, and about a quarter of a
mile inland they came upon a small farmhouse. A dog ran out to
meet them, barking vociferously; he was followed immediately by
two women and what seemed to Romilly, a whole pack of dirty and
untidy children.</p>

<p>"Good Lord," he ejaculated feebly to himself, "what a place to
commence one's honeymoon in, even if they can put us up."</p>

<p>He explained quickly what had happened and inquired anxiously
if there were any possible means of getting a conveyance to take
them to an hotel that night.</p>

<p>"No, sir," at once replied the elder woman shaking her head.
"It's seventeen miles to Yankalilla, the nearest place, and
there's no way of getting there to-night. My husband's away now,
and there's no horse or trap, till he comes back to-morrow."</p>

<p>Romilly almost groaned in anguish. "Can you put us up?" he
asked hesitatingly. "Can you give us a bed to-night?"</p>

<p>The woman looked doubtful. "We can give the lady a bed in the
room with us," she replied at length, "and there's a little tent
you can have to put up, outside; that's the best we can do. You
see, we've only three rooms here and there are seven of us
already to sleep."</p>

<p>There was no help for it and a few minutes later the
newly-married couple were getting what necessities they needed
urgently, for the night, from the car.</p>

<p>It was almost dark as they were retracing their steps to the
little house, and Romilly was glum and disappointed to a
degree.</p>

<p>But his wife squeezed his arm affectionately. "You dear old
thing," she laughed shyly. "I'm so sorry for you, but it's only a
few hours longer away, and I shall be all yours to-morrow. I
shall be dreaming of you to-night, dear, at any rate, so think of
me as you go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Go to sleep," growled her husband and then he, too, broke
into a laugh. He kissed her fondly. "It would be quite funny if
it weren't so tragic," he said. "Just fancy, anyone's honeymoon
commencing like this!"</p>

<p>They had their meal with the rest of the family, and the bride
and bridegroom, much to their astonishment soon found themselves
laughing and talking almost as it they were in their own home.
Maude had brought some biscuits with her from the car, and it was
a real delight to share them with the children there. The little
ones had soon forgotten their shyness, and, with their hands and
faces well scrubbed for the occasion, they were not half so
formidable to sit near to as Romilly had first thought. He joked
with them, chucked them under the chin, and tossed them for
sixpences, until, when bedtime came, so fascinating had he made
himself to them, their mother had great difficulty in getting
them away. Everyone went to bed early. Maude said she was not
sorry for she was tired and wanted a good sleep.</p>

<p>She bade her husband a passionate good night at the house
door, and with a whistle of philosophical resignation, the latter
marched off to his lonely couch in the little tent.</p>

<p>An old campaigner, he had made himself as cosy a shelter as
possible among the bracken on the hill side, about a hundred
yards from the house. The small tent they had provided for him
was a patchy dilapidated sort of affair at best, but he had fixed
it up in a workmanlike manner, and at least, he thought, it would
afford him cover should any rain fall.</p>

<p>He had made himself a comfortable bed of hay, spreading one
motor rug on top, and with another and a couple of blankets for
cover, he looked forward to being as comfortable as possible
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>He undressed, and, with a wistful glance at the little house
below, tucked himself in and tried to forget his disappointment
in sleep.</p>

<p>But sleep was decidedly shy of coming. Firstly, his thoughts
kept him awake and then the lighthouse on Cape Jervis troubled
him. He had left his tent flap open, so that as he lay he could
watch the window of the room where he knew his bride was
sleeping. He could be thinking of her all the time he told
himself, and would then gradually drop off to sleep. But he had
not taken into account the disturbing factor of the great light
on the Cape Head. It was directly opposite to him about three
miles away, and there was an annoying fascination in watching it
in the dim blackness of the night.</p>

<p>For quite an hour, but it seemed much longer to him, in spite
of his wish to ignore it and go to sleep, he lay watching it, and
in desperation he was just going to get up and pull the tent flap
down when suddenly a slight sound from the direction of the house
arrested his attention, and kept him perfectly still.</p>

<p>He heard the gentle click of a door and then saw a faint
shadow detach itself from the darkness of the house. To his
amazement it picked its way quickly in his direction. He leant up
upon his elbow and then&mdash;he held his breath. The figure was
all muffled up, but there was no mistaking that walk&mdash;it was
his wife's.</p>

<p>He was on his feet in an instant, and, holding open the tent
door, waited for her to approach. She saw him watching her and
put her finger to her lips. In a moment he had folded her
passionately in his arms.</p>

<p>"I simply had to come, dear," she whispered between his
kisses. "I couldn't bear to think of you here by yourself,
to-night."</p>

<p>"You are an angel, darling," he whispered back, "but you
really ought not to have come. You said&mdash;you said," and he
looked straight into her eyes, "you wanted to go to sleep."</p>

<p><br>
The months had rolled on and it was nearly spring again.</p>

<p>Two men were talking on the steps of the General Post Office
in Adelaide, when a big grey motor-car flashed by.</p>

<p>"There goes the luckiest man in all Australia," remarked one
of them enviously. "In the Police only about eighteen months ago,
and now one of the wealthiest men in city, and with a fine,
good-looking wife, too. My word, but she is a lovely woman, Mrs.
Romilly; do you know her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy," returned the other, "and she's as charming as
she's lovely. They've got a kid now too."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't know that, but I've been away from Adelaide
lately. What is it? a boy or a girl?"</p>

<p>"A boy. My wife went to the christening last week."</p>

<p>"A son, eh? Well, what have they called it?"</p>

<p>"One name is rather peculiar. It was christened Mark Jervis
Romilly."</p>

<p>"Oh, that sounds all right, but I quite thought for the moment
that you were going to tell me they had called it Joseph
Cloud."</p>
