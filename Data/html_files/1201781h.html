  <h2><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">I. &mdash; THE GAME BEGINS</a></h2>

  <p>Colonel Henry Talbot, C.M.G., D.S.O., pushed back his chair and rose from
  the dinner table. His wife had gone to the theatre, so that he was alone. And
  on that particular evening the fact caused him considerable relief. The lady
  of his bosom was no believer in the old tag that silence is golden.</p>

  <p>He crossed the hall and entered his study. There he lit a cigar, and threw
  his long, spare form into an easy chair. From the dining-room came the faint
  tinkle of glass as the butler cleared the table; save for that and the
  ticking of a clock on the mantelpiece the flat was silent.</p>

  <p>For perhaps ten minutes he sat motionless staring into the fire. Then he
  pulled a sheet of paper from his pocket and studied the contents
  thoughtfully, while a frown came on his forehead. And quite suddenly he spoke
  out loud.</p>

  <p>"It <i>can't</i> be coincidence."</p>

  <p>A coal fell into the grate, and as he bent over to replace it, the flames
  danced on his thin aquiline features.</p>

  <p>"It <i>can't</i> be," he muttered.</p>

  <p>The clock chimed nine, and as the final echo died Sway a bell shrilled
  out. Came a murmur of voices from the hall; then the butler opened the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond and Mr. Standish, sir."</p>

  <p>Colonel Talbot rose, as the two men came into the room.</p>

  <p>"Bring the coffee and port in here, Mallows," he said. "I take it you two
  fellows have had dinner?"</p>

  <p>"We have, Colonel," said Drummond, coming over to the fire. "And we're
  very curious to know the reason of the royal command."</p>

  <p>"I hope it wasn't inconvenient to either of you?" asked the colonel.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," answered Standish. "Not only are we curious, but we're
  hopeful."</p>

  <p>The colonel laughed; then he grew serious again.</p>

  <p>"You've seen the evening papers, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact I haven't," said Drummond. "Have you, Ronald?"</p>

  <p>"I only got back to London at eight," cried Standish. "What's in 'em?"</p>

  <p>There was a short pause; then Colonel Talbot spoke deliberately.</p>

  <p>"Jimmy Latimer is dead."</p>

  <p>"What!" The word burst simultaneously from both his listeners.
  "Jimmy&mdash;dead! How? When?"</p>

  <p>"Put the tray on my desk, Mallows," said the colonel. "We'll help
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>He waited until the butler had left the room; then standing with his back
  to the fire he studied the faces of the two men who were still staring at him
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>"A month ago," he began, "Jimmy put in for leave. Well, you two know what
  <i>our</i> leave frequently covers, but in this case it was the genuine
  article. He was going to the South of France, and there was no question of
  work. I got a letter from him about a fortnight ago, saying he was having a
  damned good time, and that he'd made a spot of cash at Monte. He also implied
  that there was a pretty helping him to spend it.</p>

  <p>"Last night, about ten o'clock, I got a call through here to my flat from
  Paris. Jimmy was at the other end. He told me he was on the biggest thing
  he'd ever handled&mdash;so big that he could hardly believe it himself. He
  was catching the eight-fifty-seven from the St. Lazare Station and crossing
  <i>via</i> Newhaven. It arrives at Victoria at six o'clock in the morning,
  and he was coming direct to me here. Couldn't even wait till I got to the
  office.</p>

  <p>"As you can imagine, I wondered a bit. Jimmy was not a man who went in off
  the deep end without a pretty good cause. So I ordered Mallows to have some
  breakfast ready, and to call me the instant jimmy arrived. He never did; when
  the boat reached Newhaven he was dead in his cabin."</p>

  <p>"Murdered?" asked Standish quietly.</p>

  <p>"My first thought, naturally, when I heard the news," said the colonel.
  "Since then we've obtained all the information available. He got on board the
  boat at midnight, and had a whisky and soda at the bar. Then he turned in. He
  was, apparently, in perfect health and spirits, though the steward in the bar
  seems to have noticed that he kept on glancing towards the door while he was
  drinking. Ordinarily that is a piece of evidence which I should discount very
  considerably. It is the sort of thing that, with the best will in the world,
  a man might imagine <i>after</i> the event. But in this case he actually
  mentioned the fact to his assistant last night. So there must have been
  something in it. And the next thing that was heard of the poor old boy was
  when his cabin steward called him this morning. He was partially undressed in
  his bunk, and quite dead.</p>

  <p>"When the boat berthed, the police were of course notified. Inspector
  Dorman, who is an officer of great ability, was in charge of the
  investigation, and very luckily he knew Jimmy and Jimmy's job. So the
  possibility of foul play at once occurred to him. But nothing that he could
  discover pointed to it. There was no sign of any wound, no trace of any
  weapon. His kit was, apparently, untouched; his money and watch were in the
  cubby-hole beside the bunk. In fact, everything seemed to indicate death from
  natural causes.</p>

  <p>"But Dorman was not satisfied; there still remained poison. But since that
  would necessitate a post-mortem, and it was clearly impossible to keep the
  passengers waiting while that was done, he sent one of his men up in the
  boat-train with instructions to get everybody's name and address. Meanwhile
  he had the body taken ashore, and got in touch with a doctor. Then he went on
  board again, and cross-examined everybody who could possibly throw any light
  on it.</p>

  <p>"He drew blank. Save for the one piece of evidence of the bar steward
  which I have already told you, no one could tell him anything. One sailor
  <i>thought</i> he had seen someone leaving Jimmy's cabin at about one
  o'clock, but when pressed he was so vague as to be useless. And so finally
  Dorman gave it up, and taking all the kit out of the cabin, he sat down to
  await the doctor's report."</p>

  <p>The colonel pitched the stub of his cigar into the fire.</p>

  <p>"Once again, blank. There was no trace of any poison whatsoever. The
  contents of the stomach were analysed; all the usual tests were done.
  Result&mdash;nothing. The doctor was prepared to swear that death was
  natural, though he admitted that every organ was in perfect condition."</p>

  <p>"I was just going to say," remarked Drummond, "that I've seldom met
  anybody who seemed fitter than Jimmy."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said the colonel.</p>

  <p>"What do you think yourself, sir?" asked Standish quietly.</p>

  <p>"I'm not satisfied, Ronald. I know that the idea of poisons that leave no
  trace is novelist's gup; I admit that on the face of it the doctor must be
  right. And still I'm not satisfied. If what that barman said is the truth
  Jimmy was afraid of being followed. We know that he was on to something big;
  we know that his health was perfect. And yet he dies. It can't be
  coincidence, you fellows."</p>

  <p>"If it is it's a very strange one," agreed Standish.</p>

  <p>"And if it isn't it must be murder. And if it was murder, the murderer was
  on board. Have you a copy of the list of the passengers?"</p>

  <p>Colonel Talbot walked over to his desk and handed Standish a paper.</p>

  <p>"As you will see," he remarked, "the boat was very empty. Most of the
  passengers were third class."</p>

  <p>"It's not a particularly popular boat, I should imagine," said Drummond.
  "I mean I can't see anybody who hadn't got to, for economy or some other
  reason, crossing by that route."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," remarked the colonel gravely, and the two men looked at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Something bitten you, Colonel?" cried Drummond. "Something so fantastic,
  Hugh, that I almost hesitate to mention it. But it was because what you have
  just said had struck me also that this wild idea occurred to me. Run your eye
  down the list of first class passengers&mdash;there are only eight&mdash;and
  see if one name doesn't strike you."</p>

  <p>"Alexander; Purvis; Reid; Burton...Charles Burton. The millionaire bloke
  who throws parties in Park Lane...Is that what you mean?"</p>

  <p>Colonel Talbot nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is what I mean."</p>

  <p>"But, damn it, Colonel, what on earth should he want to murder Jimmy
  for?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite so fast, Hugh," said the other. "As I said, the idea may be
  fantastically wrong. But we've all heard of Charles Burton. We all know that
  even if he isn't a millionaire he's extremely well off. But who is Charles
  Burton?"</p>

  <p>"I'll buy it," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"So would most people. Where does Charles Burton get his money from?"</p>

  <p>"I gathered he was something in the City."</p>

  <p>"Which covers a multitude of sins. But to cut the cackle, his name jumped
  at me out of that list. Why on earth should a man of his position and wealth
  choose one of the most uncomfortable Channel crossings to come over by?"</p>

  <p>"It's a goodish step from that to murder," said Standish.</p>

  <p>"Agreed, my dear fellow. But sitting in my office this afternoon, the
  question went on biting me. And at length I could stand it no longer. So I
  rang up the S&ucirc;ret&eacute; in Paris, and asked them if they could find out in what
  hotel he was staying. Of course I knew he'd left, but that didn't matter. A
  short while after they got back to me to say that he had been staying at the
  Crillon, but had left for England last night. So I got through to the
  Crillon, where I discovered that Mr. Charles Burton had intended to fly over
  to-day, but that he had suddenly changed his mind yesterday evening, and
  decided to go <i>via</i> Newhaven and Dieppe."</p>

  <p>"Strange," said Standish thoughtfully. "But it's still a goodly step,
  Colonel."</p>

  <p>"Again agreed. But having started I went on. And by dint of discreet
  enquiries one or two small but interesting facts came to light. For instance,
  I gathered that on his frequent journeys to the Continent, he <i>always</i>
  flies. He loathes trains. I further gathered, or rather failed to gather,
  from various men I rang up, what his business was. He has an office, and the
  nearest I could get to it was that he was something in the nature of a
  financial adviser, whatever that may be. No one seemed to know who he was or
  where he came from. It seems he just blossomed suddenly about two years ago.
  One day he was not; the next day he was. But the most interesting point of
  all was a casual remark I heard in the club this evening. His name cropped up
  and somebody said: 'I sometimes wonder if that man is English.' I docketed
  that for future reference."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Colonel," cried Drummond. "Let's get this straight. You
  started off by saying your idea was fantastic, but unless I'm suffering from
  senile decay, you're playing with the theory that Jimmy was murdered by
  Charles Burton."</p>

  <p>"You could not have expressed it better. <i>Playing</i> with the
  theory."</p>

  <p>"And you want us to play too?"</p>

  <p>"If you've got nothing better to do. I haven't a leg to stand on; I know
  that. But Jimmy, who was in possession of very important information, died.
  Travelling in the same boat was a man whose origin is, to say the least, not
  an open book. Further, a man who, if he did change his habitual method of
  transport, would surely choose the Golden Arrow. I remember what you two
  did," he continued, "when that Kalinsky affair was on, over Waldron's gas and
  Graham Caldwell's aeroplane. You were invaluable, and this <i>may</i> be a
  case of the same type. You both of you go everywhere in London; all I'm
  asking you to do is to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Cultivate Mr. Charles Burton," said Drummond with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Exactly, Hugh. For if there is anything in my suspicions, I think you
  two, acting unofficially, are far more likely to get to the bottom of the
  matter&mdash;or at any rate to get on the trail&mdash;than I am through
  official channels."</p>

  <p>"It's a date, Colonel," cried Standish. "But before we push off there are
  one or two points I want to get clear. In the letter you got from Jimmy a
  fortnight ago was there any hint he was on to something?"</p>

  <p>"None at all."</p>

  <p>"Have you heard from him since?"</p>

  <p>"Not until he telephoned yesterday."</p>

  <p>"So you don't know when he left the Riviera?"</p>

  <p>"Not got the ghost of an idea. But we could find that out by wiring the
  hotel."</p>

  <p>"Which was?"</p>

  <p>"The Metropole at Cannes."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would find out, Colonel. In your position you can do so more
  easily than we can, and it's information that may prove important."</p>

  <p>"I'll wire or 'phone to-morrow, Ronald."</p>

  <p>"Just one thing more. I assume some reliable person has gone through his
  kit and papers with a fine-tooth comb?"</p>

  <p>"Dorman himself. There was nothing; nothing at all. But if our wild
  surmise is correct that is what one would have expected, isn't it? The
  murderer had plenty of time to examine all the kit himself."</p>

  <p>"True," agreed Standish. "And yet a wary bird like poor old Jimmy has half
  a dozen tricks up his sleeve. Shaving soap; tooth paste..."</p>

  <p>"I know Dorman. He's up to every trick himself. And if he says there's
  nothing there&mdash;then there is nothing."</p>

  <p>"By the way," put in Drummond, "was Jimmy engaged?"</p>

  <p>"Not that I've ever heard of."</p>

  <p>"Who is his next of kin?"</p>

  <p>"His father&mdash;Major John Latimer. Lives at his club&mdash;the Senior
  Army and Navy."</p>

  <p>"A widower?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. His wife died about three years ago." Drummond rose and stretched
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Well, Ronald, old son, it seems to me that we've been handed out what
  dope there is. Let us go and kiss dear Charles good night."</p>

  <p>"One second, Hugh," said Standish. "I suppose you've got no idea, Colonel,
  what tree Jimmy was barking up?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely none. It may be a spy organisation; it may be a drug gang; it
  may be anything. But whatever it is, it's something big or Jimmy wouldn't
  have said so."</p>

  <p>"No hint, of course, of the possibility of foul play will appear in the
  papers?"</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens! no," cried Colonel Talbot. "No hint, in fact, that he was
  anything but an ordinary army officer with a job at the War Office."</p>

  <p>He strolled into the hall with the two men.</p>

  <p>"I'll let you know what I hear from Cannes," he said. "And you have my
  number here and at the office. Because I've got a sort of hunch, boys, that
  the less we actually see of one another in the near future the better. And my
  final word&mdash;watch your step."</p>

  <p>A slight drizzle was falling as Drummond and Standish reached the street,
  and they hailed a passing taxi.</p>

  <p>"United Sports Club," said Drummond. "We may as well get down to this over
  a pint, Ronald." Standish lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"A rum show," he remarked. "Damned rum. And the annoying part of it is
  that it's impossible to find out from Burton whether he had a good and
  perfectly genuine reason for crossing by that service. He may have had, and
  in that case the Chief's theory goes up in a cloud of steam. But if he didn't
  have&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In any event he'd manufacture one," Drummond cut in.</p>

  <p>"If it wasn't true it might be possible to discover the fact. But the
  trouble is that it would immediately arouse all Burton's suspicions."</p>

  <p>The taxi pulled up at the club, and they went inside. The smoking-room was
  practically empty, and drawing two easy chairs up to the fire they sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"Let's pool resources, Hugh," said Standish. "What, if anything, do you
  know of Charles Burton?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen him in all about six times," answered Drummond. "I
  accidentally trod on his foot at some ghastly cocktail party old Mary
  Wetherspoon threw at the Ritz, and we had a drink over the catastrophe. Save
  for that I don't think I've addressed three sentences to the man in my life.
  He seems a reasonable sort of individual though he ain't the type I'd choose
  to be shipwrecked on a desert island with."</p>

  <p>"How did that remark about his not being English strike you?"</p>

  <p>"It didn't&mdash;particularly. So far as I remember he speaks without the
  faintest trace of accent. In fact he must do, or the point would have
  occurred to me. But to be perfectly candid, Ronald, I do not feel that I know
  the man nearly well enough to form any opinion of him. He is the most casual
  of casual acquaintances."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been to his house in Park Lane?"</p>

  <p>"Once&mdash;with some wench. Another cocktail party. I don't think I even
  spoke to him."</p>

  <p>"But the flesh-pots of Egypt all right?"</p>

  <p>"Very much so. Though the whole turnout rather gave one the impression
  that he had issued an ultimatum&mdash;'Let there be furniture; rich, rare
  furniture. Let there be pictures; rich, rare pictures.'"</p>

  <p>"Precisely the criticism I heard," said Standish. "And it rather confirms
  what the Chief was saying about one day he was not&mdash;the next day he
  was."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Drummond doubtfully. "But I don't see that it takes us much
  further. I can think of three or four men who have suddenly made money, and
  promptly bought a large house with instructions to furnish regardless of
  cost."</p>

  <p>"Do you know when he bought that house?"</p>

  <p>"The time I went there was about a year ago, and so far as I know he'd
  been in it several months then."</p>

  <p>"So presumably he took it when he first blossomed out in the City."</p>

  <p>"Presumably."</p>

  <p>"It would be interesting to know his history before then."</p>

  <p>"That, I take it, he would say was nobody's business."</p>

  <p>"D'you see what I'm getting at, Hugh? If by some lucky speculation he made
  a packet in the City before he burst on society, it is one thing. If on the
  contrary he just arrived out of the blue, it is another. In the first event
  Talbot's question as to where he got his money is answered; in the second it
  isn't."</p>

  <p>"It should be easy to find out," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem as if the Chief has been able to do so, and he can ferret
  out information from a closed oyster. Of course, he's had a very short time.
  But I can't help feeling that our first line is Mr. Charles Burton's past.
  Did he have a father who left him money? Did he make it himself, and if so
  where? Or..."</p>

  <p>"Or what?" asked Drummond curiously.</p>

  <p>"Has he been installed there for some purpose which at the moment is
  beyond us?</p>

  <p>"And Jimmy was on the track."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. I believe that is what was at the bottom of the Chief's mind.
  And if so the sorest man in England was our Charles when his name was taken
  going up in the boat-train."</p>

  <p>Hugh Drummond lay back in his chair and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"First line settled," he remarked. "But it is the second that contains the
  snags, I'm thinking. I hardly know the blighter; you, I gather, don't know
  him at all. How do we set about attaching ourselves to his person with a view
  to extracting his maidenly secrets? Charlie is going to smell a rodent of
  that size pretty damn' quick."</p>

  <p>"Sufficient unto the day, old boy. It'll have to be worked through mutual
  friends. By the way, has he got any other house besides the one in Park
  Lane?"</p>

  <p>"Ask me another. Not that I know of, but that means nothing."</p>

  <p>Drummond sat up suddenly.</p>

  <p>"An idea, by Jove! Algy. Algy Longworth. He knows Burton fairly well.
  Waiter! Go and telephone to Mr. Longworth and tell him to come round to the
  club at once under pain of my severe displeasure.</p>

  <p>"I remember now," he continued, as the waiter left the room. "Burton has
  got a house in the country somewhere. Algy went and stayed there last summer.
  Crowds of fairies; swimming-pool; peacocks in the grounds type of thing."</p>

  <p>"However he got it the money is evidently there," said Standish dryly.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Longworth is coming round at once, sir." The waiter paused by
  Drummond's chair.</p>

  <p>"Good. Then repeat this dose and bring one for Mr. Longworth. A drivelling
  idiot is our Algy," he went on as the man moved away, "but there is a certain
  shrewdness concealed behind that eyeglass of his which may prove useful."</p>

  <p>"At any rate he gives us a point of contact with Burton," said Standish.
  "And that's all to the good."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later Algy Longworth arrived and Drummond swung round his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Come here, you pop-eyed excrescence. What the devil are you all dressed
  up like that for? And you've dribbled on your white waistcoat. You look
  awful."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, my sweet one. Evening, Ronald." The newcomer adjusted his
  eyeglass, and smiled benignly.</p>

  <p>"Evening, Algy. Take a pew."</p>

  <p>"You wish to confer with me&mdash;yes? To suck my brain on some deep point
  of international import? Gentlemen&mdash;if I may be permitted so to
  bastardise the word&mdash;I am at your service."</p>

  <p>"Look here, Algy," said Drummond, "there may be a spot of bother in the
  air. Only <i>may</i>; we don't know yet. So this conversation is not to go
  beyond you. What do you know about Charles Burton?"</p>

  <p>"Charles Burton!" Algy Longworth stared at him. "What's he been doing?
  Watering the Worcester sauce? As a matter of fact it's darned funny you
  should ask that, Hugh; I'm going to that place of his to-night. Hence the
  glad rags."</p>

  <p>"What place? His house in Park Lane?"</p>

  <p>"No; no. The Golden Boot."</p>

  <p>"The new Club that's just opened? It's Burton behind it, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Entirely. He found all the others so ghastly boring that he decided to
  have one run on his own lines. More than likely he'll be there himself.
  However, what is it you want to know about him?"</p>

  <p>"Everything you can tell. What sort of a bloke is he?"</p>

  <p>"He's all right. Throws a damned good party. Stinks of money. Clean about
  the house and all that kind of thing."</p>

  <p>"D'you know where he got his money?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't an earthly, old boy. Cornering lights for cats, or something of
  that sort, I suppose. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Where is his house in the country?"</p>

  <p>"West Sussex. Not far from Pulborough. I went and stayed there last
  July."</p>

  <p>"I remember you telling me about it," said Drummond. "Algy, would you say
  he was English?"</p>

  <p>Algy stared at him, his glass half-way to his mouth.</p>

  <p>"I've never really thought about it," he said at length. "I've always
  assumed he was, especially with that name. He speaks the language perfectly,
  but for that matter he speaks about six others equally well. I'd put it this
  way&mdash;he isn't obviously not English."</p>

  <p>"That I know," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"And I should think Sir George would have satisfied himself on that
  point," continued Algy. "You know old Castledon&mdash;the most crashing bore
  in Europe?"</p>

  <p>"His wife is the woman with a face like a cablose, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"That's it. Well, Molly, their daughter, is an absolute fizzer. When you
  see the three of 'em together you feel that you require the mysteries of
  parenthood explained to you again. However, Burton met Molly at some
  catch-'em-alive-'o dance in Ascot week, and as our society writers would say,
  paid her marked attention. So marked that Lady Castledon who was attending
  the parade as Molly's chaperon had a fit in a corner of the room, and was
  finally carried out neighing. She already heard the Burton doubloons jingling
  in the Castledon coffers, which by all accounts sadly need 'em."</p>

  <p>"What's the girl's reaction?" asked Drummond. "Definitely anti-click.
  After all, she's young; she's one of this year's brood of debs. But what I
  was getting at is, that though Sir George can clear a room quicker than an
  appeal for charity, he's a darned fine old boy. And he's not the sort of man
  who'd let his daughter marry merely for money, or get tied up with anyone he
  wasn't satisfied about."</p>

  <p>Algy drained his glass.</p>

  <p>"Look here, chaps," he said, "it seems to me I've done most of the turn up
  to date. Why this sudden interest in Charles Burton?"</p>

  <p>"We've got your word you'll keep it to yourself, Algy?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," was the quiet answer.</p>

  <p>"Good. Then listen."</p>

  <p>He did&mdash;in absolute silence&mdash;whilst they put him wise.</p>

  <p>"Seems a bit flimsy," he remarked when they had finished. "Though I agree
  that it's not like Burton to cross <i>via</i> Newhaven."</p>

  <p>"Of course it's flimsy," said Drummond. "There's not a shred of evidence
  to connect Burton with Jimmy's death. It's just a shot in the dark on the
  Chief's part. And if we find out nothing, no harm is done. On the other hand
  it is just possible we may discover that it was a bull's-eye."</p>

  <p>"I must say that he's not a man I'd like to fall foul of," remarked Algy
  thoughtfully. "I don't think he'd show one much mercy. He sacked the first
  manager he put into the Golden Boot at a moment's notice for the most trivial
  offence. But murder is rather a tall order."</p>

  <p>"My dear Algy," said Standish, "the tallness of the order is entirely
  dependent on the largeness of the stake. And if Jimmy was on to something
  really big..."</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," said Algy. "Well, boys, I'm afraid I haven't been
  of much assistance, but I really know very little about the fellow myself.
  Why don't you come round to the Golden Boot with me now?"</p>

  <p>"Short coats all right?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! yes. Though he insists on evening clothes. Of course, I can't
  guarantee that he'll be there, and even if he is I don't see that it will do
  any good. But you might stumble on something, and you're bound to find a lot
  of people there that you know."</p>

  <p>"What about it, Ronald?" said Drummond. "It can't do any harm."</p>

  <p>"It can't. But I don't think we'll both go, Hugh. If anything comes out of
  this show it would be well to have one completely unknown bloke on our
  side&mdash;unknown to Burton, I mean. Now he knows you and he knows Algy; he
  does not know me. So for the present, at any rate, we won't connect you and
  me. You toddle off with Algy; as he says, you might find out something. Let's
  meet here for lunch to-morrow, and I'll put out a few feelers in the City
  during the morning."</p>

  <p>Drummond nodded.</p>

  <p>"Sound idea. You've got a wench with you, I suppose, Algy?"</p>

  <p>"I'm with a party. Why don't you join up too?"</p>

  <p>"I'll see. It's one of these ordinary bottle places, I take it?"</p>

  <p>"That's right. Same old stunt in rather better setting than
  usual&mdash;that's all. Night-night, Ronald."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">II. &mdash; THE GOLDEN BOOT</a></h2>

  <p>As Algy Longworth had said, it was the same old stunt. After a slight
  financial formality at the door, Drummond became a guest of the management
  for the evening with all the privileges appertaining to such an honoured
  position. Though unable to order a whisky and soda, he was allowed&mdash;nay,
  expected&mdash;to order a bottle. To consume one drink was a crime comparable
  to murdering the Archbishop of Canterbury; to consume the entire bottle was a
  great and meritorious action.</p>

  <p>Accustomed, however, as he was to these interesting sidelights on our
  legal system he gave the necessary order, and then glanced round the room.
  Being only just midnight there were still many empty tables, though he saw
  several faces he recognised. It was a long, narrow building, and a band, in a
  fantastic red and green uniform, was playing at the far end. But the whole
  get-up of the place was, as Algy had said, distinctly better than usual.</p>

  <p>Algy's party had not yet arrived, so they sat down at an empty table, near
  the microscopic dancing-floor, and Drummond ordered a kipper.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait, old boy," said Algy, and at that moment a girl paused by their
  table.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! darling." He scrambled to his feet. "You look absolutely
  ravishing. Hugh, you old stiff&mdash;this is Alice. Around her rotates the
  whole place; she is our sun, our moon, our stars. Without her we wilt; we
  die. Hugh; Alice."</p>

  <p>"You blithering imbecile," said the girl with a particularly charming
  smile. "Are you his keeper, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>Drummond grinned&mdash;that slow, lazy grin of his, which made so many
  people wonder why they had ever thought him ugly.</p>

  <p>"Lions I have shot, Alice; tigers, even field mice; but there is a limit
  to my powers. When this palsied worm joins his unfortunate fellow guests will
  you come and kipper with me?"</p>

  <p>"I'd love to," she answered simply, and with a nod moved on.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you did that, Hugh," said Algy. "She's an absolute topper, that
  girl. Name of Blackton. Father was a soldier."</p>

  <p>"What's she doing this job for?"</p>

  <p>"He lost all his money in some speculation. But you'll really like her.
  There's no nonsense about her, and she dances like an angel." He lowered his
  voice. "No sign of C. B. so far."</p>

  <p>"The night is yet young," said Drummond. "And even if he does come I'm not
  likely to get anything out of him. It's more the atmosphere of this place
  that I want, and sidelights from other people."</p>

  <p>"Alice might help you there," remarked Algy. "She's been here since it
  opened. Hullo! here come my crowd. So long, old boy, and don't forget if
  anything does emerge the bunch are in on it."</p>

  <p>He drifted away and a smile twitched round Drummond's lips. How many times
  in the past had not the bunch been in on things? And they were all ready
  again if and when the necessity arose.</p>

  <p>If and when...The smile had gone, and he was conscious of a curious
  sensation. Suddenly the room seemed strangely unreal; the band, the women,
  the hum of conversation faded and died. In its place was a deserted
  cross-roads with the stench of death lying thick like a fetid pall. Against
  the darkening sky green pencil lines of light shot ceaselessly up, to turn
  into balls of fire as the flares lobbed softly into no-man's-land. In the
  distance the mutter of artillery; the sudden staccato burst of a machine-gun.
  And in the ditch close by, a motionless figure in khaki, with chalk white
  face and glazed staring eyes, that seemed to be mutely asking why its legs
  should be lying two yards away being gnawed by rats.</p>

  <p>"A penny, Hugh."</p>

  <p>With a start he glanced up; Alice was looking at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"For the moment I thought of other things," he said quietly. "I was back
  across the water, Alice; back in the days of the madness. I almost seemed to
  be there in reality&mdash;it was so vivid. Funny, isn't it, the tricks one's
  mind plays?"</p>

  <p>"You seemed to me, Hugh, to be staring into the future&mdash;not into the
  past." She sat down opposite him. "The world was on your shoulders and you
  found it heavy. This is the first time you've been here, isn't it?" she
  continued lightly.</p>

  <p>"The future." He stared at her gravely. "I wonder. However, a truce to
  this serious mood. Yes, it is the first time I've been here; I've been up in
  Scotland since it opened. And as such places go it seems good to me. I gather
  that one Charles Burton is behind it?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know the gentleman?" Her tone was non-committal, but he glanced at
  her quickly.</p>

  <p>"Very slightly," he said. "You do, of course."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know him. He is in here most nights when he's in London."</p>

  <p>"Do you like him?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Hugh, girls in my position neither like nor dislike the great
  man. We exist by virtue of his tolerance."</p>

  <p>Drummond studied her in silence.</p>

  <p>"Now what precisely do you mean?" he enquired at length.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what I say. Caesar holds the power of life or death. There is no
  appeal. If he says to me, 'Go'&mdash;I go. And lose my job. Which reminds me
  that you'll have to stand me a bottle of champagne for the good of the house.
  Sorry about it, but there you are."</p>

  <p>Drummond beckoned to a waiter and glanced at the wine list.</p>

  <p>"Number 35. Now tell me, Alice," he said when the man had gone, "do you
  like this job?"</p>

  <p>"Beggars can't be choosers, can they? And since secretaries are a drug on
  the market what is a poor girl to do?"</p>

  <p>"Does he expect you to&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Sleep with him?" She gave a short laugh. "So far, Hugh, I have not been
  honoured."</p>

  <p>"And if you are?"</p>

  <p>"I can think of nothing I should detest more. I hate the swine."</p>

  <p>"Steady, my dear." For a moment he laid his hand on hers. "The' swine' has
  just arrived. And I don't think you'll be honoured this evening at any
  rate."</p>

  <p>A sudden silence had fallen on the Golden Boot. Head waiters, waiters,
  under waiters were prostrating themselves at the door. And assuredly the
  woman who had entered with Charles Burton was sufficient cause. Tall, with a
  perfect figure, she stood for a moment regarding the room with an arrogance
  so superb, that its insolence was almost staggering. Her shimmering black
  velvet frock was skin-tight; she wore no jewels save one rope of magnificent
  pearls. Her eyes were blue and heavy lidded; her mouth a scarlet streak. And
  on one finger there glittered a priceless ruby.</p>

  <p>As if unconscious of the effect she had created she swept across the room
  behind the obsequious manager, whilst Charles Burton followed in leisurely
  fashion, stopping at different tables to speak to friends. At length he
  reached Drummond's and the eyes of the two men met.</p>

  <p>"Surely..." began Burton doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"We met at a cocktail party, Mr. Burton," said Drummond with a smile. "I
  trod on your foot and nearly broke it. Drummond is my name."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I remember perfectly. Ah! good evening, Miss Blackton." He
  gave the girl a perfunctory bow; then turned back to Drummond. "I don't think
  I've seen you here before."</p>

  <p>"For the very good reason that it is the first time I've been. I've only
  just got back from the north."</p>

  <p>"Shooting?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was stalking in Sutherland."</p>

  <p>"Well, now that you've been here once I hope you'll come again. It's my
  toy, you know."</p>

  <p>With a nod he moved on, and Drummond watched him as he joined the woman.
  Then he became aware that a waiter was standing by him with a note.</p>

  <p>"From the gentleman with the eyeglass, sir."</p>

  <p>He opened it, and saw a few words scrawled in pencil.</p>

  <blockquote style="font-style:italic">
    "Charlie B. He make whoopee. But what about poor Molly C."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Drummond smiled and put the note in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"From the idiot boy," he said. "Commenting on Mr. Burton's girl
  friend."</p>

  <p>"She's an extraordinarily striking woman," said Alice Blackton. "I wonder
  if he picked her up at Nice."</p>

  <p>Drummond stared at her.</p>

  <p>"Did you say Nice?"</p>

  <p>"I did. He's just come back from the Riviera, you know."</p>

  <p>"Has he indeed? That is rather interesting." She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you find it so. I'm afraid that Mr. Burton's comings and goings
  leave me stone cold."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Alice, why do you hate him?"</p>

  <p>"Hate is perhaps too strong a word," she said. "And yet I don't know. I
  think it's because I don't trust him a yard. I don't mean only over women,
  though that comes into it too. I wouldn't trust him over anything. He's
  completely and utterly unscrupulous."</p>

  <p>"Are you speaking from definite knowledge, or is that merely your private
  opinion?"</p>

  <p>"If by definite knowledge you mean do I know that he's ever robbed a
  church&mdash;then no. But you've only got to meet him in a subordinate
  capacity like I have, to get him taped."</p>

  <p>She looked at Drummond curiously.</p>

  <p>"You seem very interested in him, Hugh."</p>

  <p>"I am," said Drummond frankly. "Though the last thing I want is that he
  should know it."</p>

  <p>"You can be sure that I won't pass it on. Why are you so interested, or is
  it a secret?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it is, my dear. All I can tell you is that I'm very anxious to
  find out everything that I can about the gentleman. And though I can't say
  why, your little piece of information about his having been on the Riviera
  recently, is of the greatest value. Do you know how long he was there
  for?"</p>

  <p>"I can tell you when he left England. It was exactly a fortnight ago,
  because he was in here the night before he flew over."</p>

  <p>"I gather he always flies," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"He's got his own machine," remarked the girl. "And his own pilot."</p>

  <p>"Did he go over in it this time?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. He always does."</p>

  <p>"Curiouser and curiouser," said Drummond. "I know," he went on with a
  smile, "that this must seem very mysterious to you. Really, it isn't a bit.
  But at the moment I just can't tell you what it is all about. Your father was
  a soldier, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He was. Though how did you know?"</p>

  <p>"Algy told me. Now I can let you in to this much. It is the army that is
  interested in Mr. Burton. I tell you that, because I'm going to ask you to do
  something for me."</p>

  <p>"What?" said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Keep an eye on him&mdash;that's all, and let me know anything about his
  movements that you can find out, however seemingly trivial."</p>

  <p>"My dear man, I can't do much, I'm afraid."</p>

  <p>"You never know," said Drummond quietly. "As I've already told you, that
  piece of information about Nice is most valuable. Another thing. Not only his
  movements, but also the people he brings here. Now would it be possible to
  discover the name of that woman?"</p>

  <p>"Presumably he's signed her in, but whether under her real name or not is
  another matter. I can find out if you like."</p>

  <p>"Do&mdash;like an angel."</p>

  <p>"All right. I'll go and powder my nose."</p>

  <p>A good wench, reflected Drummond as he watched her threading her way
  through the tables. Definitely an asset. And though probably ninety per cent
  of what she could pass on would be valueless, the remaining ten might not.
  Witness the matter of Nice. True that would certainly have come out in the
  course of time&mdash;Burton's visit there was clearly no secret. At the same
  time it was useful to have it presented free of charge, so to speak. But the
  really important thing was the installation in one of the enemy's camps of a
  reliable friend.</p>

  <p>"O.K., baby?"</p>

  <p>Algy had strolled over to his table.</p>

  <p>"Very much so, old boy. A damned nice girl."</p>

  <p>"That's a bit of mother's ruin our Charlie has got with him."</p>

  <p>"Alice is just trying to find out who she is. Algy&mdash;Burton was at
  Nice, while Jimmy was at Cannes." Algy whistled.</p>

  <p>"The devil he was. Have you told Alice anything about it?"</p>

  <p>"No. Safer not to at present. She doesn't like him, Algy."</p>

  <p>"None of the staff do, old lad. Alice&mdash;my life, my all&mdash;this
  revolting man hasn't been making love to you, has he?"</p>

  <p>"Not so that you'd notice, Algy," laughed the girl, sitting down. "She is
  a Madame Tomesco, Hugh."</p>

  <p>"It has a Roumanian flavour," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"And mark you, boys and girls, I could do with a bit of Roumanian
  flavouring myself," declared Algy. "I could do that woman a kindness; yes, I
  could. Well, <i>au revoir,</i> my sweets. If he plucks at his collar, Alice,
  its either passion or indigestion, or possibly both. You have been
  warned."</p>

  <p>"Quite, quite mad," said the girl. "But rather a dear. You must give me
  your address, Hugh, before you go, so that I can send along the doings."</p>

  <p>He scribbled it down on a piece of paper and his telephone number.</p>

  <p>"Be careful, my dear," he said gravely. "I have a feeling that if the
  gentleman got an inkling that you were spying on him he would not be amused.
  I'll go further. If there is anything in what we suspect you'd be in grave
  danger."</p>

  <p>Her eyes opened wide.</p>

  <p>"How perfectly thrilling! Promise you'll tell me sometime what it's all
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Thumbs crossed. Waiter, let me have my bill. I've put my name on the
  whisky; keep it for me for next time."</p>

  <p>"Come again soon, Hugh," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"I sure will. Good night, dear. I really am infernally sleepy."</p>

  <p>The rain had ceased when he got outside, and refusing a taxi he started to
  walk to his flat. Though the Golden Boot was much better ventilated than the
  average night club, it was a relief to breathe fresh air again. The streets
  were wet and glistening in the glare of the arc lights; the pavements almost
  deserted. Every now and then some wretched woman appeared from seemingly
  nowhere, and it was while he was fumbling in his pocket for some money for
  one of them that his uncanny sixth sense began to assert itself.</p>

  <p>"Bless you! You're a toff," said the girl, but Drummond hardly heard her.
  He was staring back the way he had come. What was that man doing loitering
  about, some fifty yards away?</p>

  <p>He walked on two or three hundred yards; then on the pretext of doing up
  his shoe he stopped. The man was still there; he was being followed. With a
  puzzled frown he strode on; how in the name of all that was marvellous could
  he have incurred anybody's suspicions?</p>

  <p>He decided to make sure, and to do so he employed the old ruse. He swung
  round the corner from Piccadilly into Bond Street; then he stopped dead in
  his tracks. And ten seconds later the man shot round too, only to halt, in
  his turn, as he saw Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," said Drummond affably. "You are not, if I may say so, very
  expert at your game. Possibly you haven't had much practice."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," muttered the other, and Drummond
  studied him curiously. He looked about thirty, and was decently dressed. His
  voice was refined; he might have been a bank clerk.</p>

  <p>"Why are you following me?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean. I'm not following you."</p>

  <p>"Then why did you stop dead when you came round the corner and saw me? I
  fear that your powers of lying are about equivalent to your powers of
  tracking. Once again I wish to know why you are following me."</p>

  <p>"I refuse to say," said the man.</p>

  <p>"At any rate we advance," said Drummond. "You no longer deny the soft
  impeachment. But as it's confoundedly draughty here I suggest that we should
  stroll on together, chatting on this and that. And in case the point has
  escaped your notice, I will just remind you that I am a very much larger and
  more powerful man than you. And should the ghastly necessity of hitting you
  arise, it will probably be at least a week before you again take your morning
  Bengers."</p>

  <p>"You dare to lay a hand on me," blustered the man, "and I'll..."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Drummond politely. "You'll what? Call the police? Come on,
  little man; I would hold converse with you."</p>

  <p>With a grip of iron he took the man's right arm above the elbow, and
  turning back into Piccadilly he walked him along.</p>

  <p>"Who is employing you?"</p>

  <p>"I refuse to say. God! you'll break my arm."</p>

  <p>"Quite possibly."</p>

  <p>And at that moment a policeman came round Dover Street just in front of
  them.</p>

  <p>"Officer," cried the man. "Help!"</p>

  <p>For a moment Drummond's grip relaxed, and like a rabbit going down a
  bolt-hole the man was across the road and racing down St. James's Street.</p>

  <p>"What's all this, sir?" said the constable as Drummond began to laugh.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman who has been following me, officer," he said. "I'm afraid I
  was rather hurting him."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I see, sir."</p>

  <p>The constable looked at him significantly and winked. Then with a cheery
  "Good night, sir," he resumed his beat.</p>

  <p>But the smile soon faded from Drummond's face, and it was with a very
  grave expression that he walked on. He had only got down from Scotland that
  day, so under what conceivable circumstances could he be being followed? That
  it was added confirmation that the Chief was right was indubitable; it could
  not be anything else than the Jimmy Latimer affair. There was a literally
  <i>nothing</i> else that it could be. But how had they got on to
  <i>him</i>&mdash;Drummond? That was what completely defeated him. For one
  brief moment the possibility of Alice Blackton being a wrong 'un crossed his
  mind; then he dismissed it as absurd. What could be her object? She had his
  address; she knew his name, so what purpose would it serve to have him
  followed home? But if it was not her who could it be?</p>

  <p>He reached his house and produced his latch-key. The road was deserted;
  there was no sign of the man who had bolted so precipitately. But as he mixed
  himself a final night-cap he was still frowning thoughtfully. For he had
  suddenly realised that all the arguments that applied to Alice applied
  equally to Charles Burton. He, too, knew Drummond's name, and even if he did
  not know the address he could easily find it in the telephone directory. So
  again what was the object in having him followed? And the problem was still
  unsolved when he met Standish lust before lunch next day.</p>

  <p>"There can be only one solution, Hugh," said that worthy when Drummond had
  finished telling him. "They picked us up at the Chief's flat. It was he who
  was being watched, and anybody who went to see him."</p>

  <p>He sipped his sherry thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"We ought to have been more careful," he went on. "However, the mischief
  is done now, so it can't be helped. You see we gave the club address to the
  taxi-driver, which made it easy to follow us here. Then you were shadowed to
  the Golden Boot; I was almost certainly traced to my flat. As a matter of
  fact there was a loafer hanging about to open the door of the taxi who could
  easily have heard the address. And, finally, your friend tried to follow you
  home."</p>

  <p>"But if Burton is at the bottom of it, why worry about me? You, I can
  understand, but he knows me."</p>

  <p>"True, old boy," said Standish, "but he doesn't know, or didn't know then,
  that you were mixed up in the matter. Assuming for the moment that Burton is
  at the bottom of it, what happened, as I see it, is this. He issued orders
  for the Chief's flat to be watched, and anything of interest to be reported
  to him to-day. So by this time he knows that I' had an interview with the
  Colonel last night, and that a large man who left the Golden Boot in the
  early hours was also present at that interview. Which, I fear, points
  unerringly to you."</p>

  <p>"There were a lot of people there, Ronald."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's hope for the best. But we mustn't bank on it. We must play on
  the assumption that Burton knows we're both in the game."</p>

  <p>"You are definitely converted to the Chief's theory."</p>

  <p>"I am becoming more and more so. Would they have bothered to watch his
  flat if Jimmy's death had been a natural one? No; the cumulative effect of
  all this evidence, to my mind, is that Jimmy was murdered. And if he was
  murdered there is a strong probability that Burton had something to do with
  it."</p>

  <p>"I hope to Heaven I've not put that girl in any danger," said Drummond in
  a worried voice.</p>

  <p>"Drop her a line and tell her to watch her step."</p>

  <p>"And this Tomesco woman means nothing in your life?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing. But a name is a matter of small moment."</p>

  <p>"Did you find out anything this morning?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Merely additional confirmation that there doesn't seem to be anything to
  find out. Which in itself is suspicious. He has an office in Fenchurch Street
  with a small staff. Frequently for days on end he is not there. He doesn't
  appear to have many clients, and nobody seems to know exactly what his
  business actually is. One line, apparently, consists of considerable
  speculation in foreign currencies."</p>

  <p>A page boy came up with a letter on a salver.</p>

  <p>"From the Chief," said Standish quietly. "Let's see what he's got to
  say."</p>

  <p>He read the letter through; then handed it to Drummond.</p>

  <blockquote style="font-style:italic">
    "DEAR RONALD" [it ran],<br>
    <br>
    "I have been in 'touch with manager of the Metropole at Cannes. Jimmy died
    (?) on Wednesday night; he left the hotel most unexpectedly on the Tuesday
    and caught the Paris express. It came as a complete surprise to the manager
    as, only that very morning, he had booked his room for another week.<br>
    <br>
    "That was all I could get over the 'phone, Evidently something happened on
    Tuesday which caused this sudden change of plan. But there is another
    peculiar feature, He must have arrived in Paris early on Wednesday morning.
    Why did he not cross earlier, or fly over? What was he doing in Paris all
    that time? And if the matter was not so very urgent why didn't he wait till
    Thursday and cross in comfort?<br>
    <br>
    "I can't help thinking that one or both of you should go to Cannes, and see
    if you can pick up any threads there. Possibly also a few discreet
    enquiries at the Hotel Crillon might help.<br>
    <br>
    "Yours,<br>
    "HENRY TALBOT.<br>
    <br>
    "PS. Am sending this from my club. I shall be here for the next hour."
  </blockquote>

  <p>"I agree," said Drummond. "And since we know we've been shadowed, the
  objection to our being seen together no longer exists. I suggest that we both
  go."</p>

  <p>"O.K. by me," answered Standish, "just one moment, old boy; I'm going to
  drop a line to the Chief. Then we'll discuss plans."</p>

  <p>He went to a writing-desk, whilst Drummond lit a cigarette and ordered
  another glass of sherry. Undoubtedly the Chief was right; they were at a dead
  end here in London. And in Cannes they might stumble on something.</p>

  <p>"Read what I've said, Hugh. I'll send it round by hand to his club."</p>

  <blockquote style="font-style:italic">
    "DEAR COLONEL,<br>
    <br>
    "We will both go as you suggest. Do you know that Burton was in Nice while
    Jimmy was at Cannes?<br>
    <br>
    "Your flat is being watched; we were both shadowed last night when we left
    you. Hugh caught his sportsman who admitted the fact. This looks to me to
    be strong confirmation of your theory that Jimmy was murdered.<br>
    <br>
    "Have you a line on a Madame Tomesco? She was with Burton last night, and
    according to Hugh she knocked even the habitu&eacute;s of the Golden
    Boot&mdash;which is financed by Burton&mdash;quite flat.<br>

    "Yours sincerely,<br>

  <p>It came in five minutes, scribbled characteristically On the back of the

  </blockquote>

  <p>"How shall we go?" said Standish as they sat down to lunch.</p>

  <p>"Since there are no papers or <i>triptyques</i> required for France, I
  suggest we go by car," remarked Drummond. "It takes a little longer, I know,
  but once we're there it gives us much more freedom. Shall we do Paris before
  or after Cannes?"</p>

  <p>"After," said Standish decidedly. "Let's begin at the beginning if we can,
  and work forward."</p>

  <p>"And when shall we cross?"</p>

  <p>"As soon as possible. What about the four-thirty service <i>via</i>
  Folkestone? The boat leaves at six-thirty. We can be alongside by a quarter
  to six."</p>

  <p>"On our heads," said Drummond. "What's the distance from Boulogne to
  Cannes?"</p>

  <p>"Seven hundred miles odd."</p>

  <p>"We can do that to-morrow driving turn and turn about if we start
  early."</p>

  <p>"Right. All settled. And I for one, old boy, am taking a gun."</p>

  <p>"You stagger me," grinned Drummond, as he inspected the Stilton.
  "Personally, I think a piece of this would be just as efficacious."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">III. &mdash; MIDNIGHT INTERVIEW</a></h2>

  <p>The lounge in the Metropole was full of middle-aged women knitting
  incomprehensible garments when they arrived there at ten o'clock the
  following night.</p>

  <p>"What a galaxy!" muttered Drummond. "I wonder why Jimmy stopped here."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't think he was in much," laughed Standish.</p>

  <p>They were standing by the concierge's desk registering. The management had
  been enchanted to give them rooms on the third floor facing the sea, and as
  they signed their names, the manager himself approached with the air of a
  high priest.</p>

  <p>"You are staying long, gentlemen?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Probably three or four days," said Standish.</p>

  <p>The manager sighed. Extras were his life, and these two Englishmen did not
  look of the type who made a small bottle of <i>vin ordinaire</i> last a week,
  like most of his visitors.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if we could have a little private talk in your office,"
  continued Standish. "Perhaps you will join us in a bottle of wine, and we
  could have it sent in there."</p>

  <p>"But certainly," cried the Frenchman. "<i>Henri! la carte des vins.
  Messieurs; vous permettez? Une bouteille de dix neuf, et trois verres. Au
  bureau.</i> Follow me, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>He led the way along a passage, and opening a frosted glass door, he gave
  a brief order to a girl who was immersed in a vast ledger. She left the room,
  and, having sat down at his desk, the manager waved Drummond and Standish to
  two chairs.</p>

  <p>"Now, gentlemen. What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"You have recently had staying here, m'sieur," said Standish, "an English
  officer called Latimer&mdash;Major Latimer."</p>

  <p>The Frenchman nodded.</p>

  <p>"I had guessed, gentlemen, that that was your business. Only yesterday I
  was on the telephone to London about him."</p>

  <p>"You know, of course, that he is dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead!" The manager sat up with an amazed jerk. "Dead! <i>Ce n' est pas
  possible.</i> How did he die?"</p>

  <p>"We can rely on your discretion, m'sieur?"</p>

  <p>A superb gesture indicated that they could.</p>

  <p>"Major Latimer was found dead in his cabin in the Dieppe-Newhaven boat on
  Wednesday night. And we are not quite sure what caused his death. On the face
  of it, it appears to have been natural, but he was a singularly healthy man.
  We know that he was in possession of certain information which he was
  bringing back to England, and we are very anxious to find out what that
  information was. Now, in view of what you said over the telephone to London
  we cannot help thinking that his abrupt departure from this hotel has some
  vital bearing on the case. What we, therefore, would like to find out is what
  Major Latimer's movements were on Tuesday last, after he had renewed his room
  for another week. Because it seems clear that it must have been then, that
  whatever it was took place."</p>

  <p>The waiter paused in the act of pouring out the wine.</p>

  <p><i>"Pardon, m'sieu. Vous dites mardi? M'sieur le majeur a accompagn&eacute;
  Madame P&eacute;lain en auto. Ils sont sortis &agrave; onze heures."</i></p>

  <p>"<i>Merci, Henri.</i>"</p>

  <p>He dismissed the man, and himself handed the wine to his guests.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he cried, "I go&mdash;how do you say it&mdash;wool gathering.
  One must be of a discretion, <i>naturellement,</i> but since the poor fellow
  is dead one may be permitted to speak. As you will understand, most things in
  an hotel like this come to my ear sooner or later, and it would not be an
  exaggeration to say that the major and Madame P&eacute;lain saw much of each other
  during his stay here. He seemed to prefer her company to that of the other
  charming ladies whom you saw in the lounge as you passed through."</p>

  <p>His mouth twitched behind his moustache, and with one accord Drummond and
  Standish burst out laughing.</p>

  <p>"Precisely, messieurs," continued the manager, laughing himself. "In fact,
  though perhaps I should not say it, if Madame had not been here, I fear your
  poor friend would not have remained. It was reported to me by Henri that at
  dinner the first night he did nothing but call ceaselessly upon the good God
  to deliver him."</p>

  <p>"Do we understand," said Standish, "that Madame Pekin is still in your
  hotel?"</p>

  <p><i>"Mais oui, m'sieu.</i> It is for that I say I go wool gathering. For it
  is she who can tell you far more than I. But almost certainly will she be at
  the casino now. It will be a great shock to her. I will swear that she has no
  idea that he is dead."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette and looked curiously at the two men.</p>

  <p>"Is it permitted to ask, gentlemen, what it is that you think has
  happened? Is it that you fear he was the victim of foul play?"</p>

  <p>"You have struck it, m'sieur," said Drummond. "We think it more than
  possible that he was murdered."</p>

  <p><i>"Mon Dieu! c'est terrible."</i></p>

  <p>"But please keep that to yourself," said Standish. "All that has appeared
  in the papers is that he died in his sleep on board the boat. Have you any
  idea when Madame is likely to return?"</p>

  <p>The manager shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p><i>"A minuit, peut-&ecirc;tre.</i> You would wish to talk to her to-night?"</p>

  <p>"The sooner the better, Hugh, don't you think?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. Unless she is too tired. Tell me, m'sieur, of
  what&mdash;er&mdash;type is Madame?"</p>

  <p><i>"Tr&egrave;s chic; tr&egrave;s &eacute;l&eacute;gante."</i></p>

  <p>"Is there a Monsieur P&eacute;lain?"</p>

  <p>"I understand Monsieur P&eacute;lain resides in Paris," said the manager
  diplomatically.</p>

  <p>"And you think we can rely on anything she may tell us?"</p>

  <p>Once again the manager shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"If I knew enough about women, m'sieur, to be able to tell that concerning
  any member of their sex, I would be President of France. She has a
  sitting-room; if she consents to receive you&mdash;as I am sure she
  will&mdash;you must judge for yourselves. You are not, are you, from Scotland
  Yard?"</p>

  <p>"No. We are just two friends of Major Latimer's."</p>

  <p>"And what would you wish me to tell Madame? That he is dead?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Standish decidedly. "Just that we are two friends. And please
  impress upon her that if she is at all tired we would much prefer to wait
  till to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>A telephone rang on the desk, and the manager picked up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"<i>Certainement, Madame. Tout de suite.</i> Madame has returned," he went
  on as he replaced the instrument. "She orders Evian. I will go to her at once
  and enquire if she will receive you."</p>

  <p>"A nice little man," said Drummond as the door dosed behind him. "Very
  helpful and obliging."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if we'll get anything out of this woman," remarked Standish
  thoughtfully. "I shall be interested to see her reaction when she hears that
  Jimmy is dead. Who's going to do the talking&mdash;you or I?"</p>

  <p>"You do it," said Drummond. "You're better at it than I am."</p>

  <p>The door opened and the manager returned.</p>

  <p>"Madame will receive you, gentlemen. I have told her nothing save that you
  are two friends of Major Latimer. Will you come this way? Her rooms are an
  the same floor as yours."</p>

  <p>The lounge was deserted as they crossed it to go to the lift, and Drummond
  glanced at his watch. It was just half-past eleven, and he was beginning to
  wish that the interview had been postponed till the following morning. They
  had started from Boulogne at five o'clock, and though each of them had had an
  occasional doze while the other drove, he was feeling distinctly weary. At
  the same time he was conscious of a little tingle of excitement; would they
  find out anything worth while, or would they draw blank?</p>

  <p>The manager knocked at the door, and a woman's voice called
  "<i>Entrez</i>."</p>

  <p>Madame P&eacute;lain was standing by a table in the centre of the room, with the
  fingers of one hand lightly resting on it. She had not yet removed her cloak,
  which was open, revealing her evening frock underneath. Her hair was dark and
  beautifully coiffured; her nails were red though not outrageously so.
  Attractive, decided Drummond; more attractive than pretty. But, emphatically,
  a charming woman to look at.</p>

  <p>As the manager introduced the two men she gave each of them a keen
  searching glance; then sinking gracefully into an easy chair she lit a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Do smoke," she said. "Monsieur Lidet tells me that you are friends of
  Major Latimer."</p>

  <p>Her voice was musical; her English almost devoid of accent.</p>

  <p>"That is our excuse, Madame," said Standish, "for intruding on you at this
  hour."</p>

  <p>With a murmured apology the manager left the room, and she leaned forward
  in her chair.</p>

  <p>"You have a message for me from him?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I fear, Madame," answered Standish gravely, "that you must prepare
  yourself for a shock. Jimmy Latimer is dead."</p>

  <p>She sat staring at him speechlessly, her cigarette half-way to her lips.
  And it was obvious to both men that the news had come as a complete shock to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Dead," she stammered at length. "<i>Mais c'est incroyable.</i> How did he
  die, m'sieur?"</p>

  <p>Briefly Standish told her and she listened in silence. And when he had
  finished she still did not speak; she sat in a sort of frozen immobility with
  her eyes on the carpet. At length she drew a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madame?" said Standish quietly.</p>

  <p>"You think poor Jimmy was murdered?"</p>

  <p>"I think nothing, Madame. But something must have happened on Tuesday to
  make him change his plans so suddenly, and since you were with him all that
  day we think you might know what that something was."</p>

  <p>For a space she stared at them without speaking.</p>

  <p>"How am I to know that you are what you profess to be?" she said at
  length. "How can I be sure that you are Major Latimer's friends?"</p>

  <p>"I fear, Madame," said Standish frankly, "that you can only take our word
  for it."</p>

  <p>Once again she studied them thoughtfully; then, rising, she began to pace
  up and down the room.</p>

  <p>"I'll trust you," she said suddenly; "I will tell you all I know, though I
  fear it is not very much. On Tuesday Jimmy and I lunched Chez Paquay, a
  restaurant on the Corniche road between here and St. Raphael. Our table was
  laid in a covered balcony with no window. Almost was it a room from which the
  window had been removed, with a red brick wall along the side that faced the
  sea. Another table was laid, but it was empty, and so we had the place to
  ourselves.</p>

  <p>"Suddenly there came a gust of wind. The dust outside swirled in eddies;
  we gripped the tablecloth to save it blowing away, for it was fierce, that
  gust. And even as it died away two sheets of paper blew in and settled on the
  floor. Quite casually Jimmy bent down and picked them up. He glanced at them,
  and in an instant, m'sieurs, his face changed. To my amazement he crammed
  them in his pocket, and, even as he did so, we heard footsteps rushing down
  the stairs.</p>

  <p>"'Not a word, said Jimmy to me.'</p>

  <p>"The glass door was flung open, and a man dashed in.</p>

  <p>"'Pardon,' he cried, 'but have you seen two pieces of paper? They blew out
  of my bedroom window in the wind and fluttered in here.'</p>

  <p>"Jimmy made a pretence of helping him to look.</p>

  <p>"'I'm afraid they must have fluttered out again,' he said. 'What sort of
  size were they?'</p>

  <p>"'The size of a piece of note-paper,' answered the man, and he was staring
  hard at Jimmy. 'And they did not flutter out again.'</p>

  <p>"'Then they must still be here,' said Jimmy indifferently.</p>

  <p>"He sat down and poured me out some more wine, whilst the man stood
  hovering by the other table in a state of the most obvious indecision. He
  was, of course, in a quandary. It was clear to me that the papers were
  important, otherwise Jimmy would not have acted as he had; it was clear also
  that the man was convinced that they had not blown away. But what was he to
  do? Twice he made a step forward as if to speak; twice he drew back. And then
  he made up his mind.</p>

  <p>"'As a mere matter of form, sir,' he said, 'I wonder if you would mind
  turning out your pockets? The papers are of the utmost importance,
  and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'What the devil do you mean, sir,' remarked Jimmy, slowly getting up.
  'Your suggestion is the most monstrous piece of impertinence I have ever
  heard. Emphatically I will <i>not</i> turn out my pockets. Why, damn it, it's
  tantamount to accusing me of having taken your two confounded pieces of
  paper! Get to hell out of it.'</p>

  <p>"And then the lobster arrived, and Jimmy resumed his seat, the picture of
  righteous indignation, while the man, with one last vindictive look at both
  of us, left the room.</p>

  <p>"'Jimmy,' I said, when we were once more alone, 'that was very naughty of
  you. Why have you stolen the poor man's papers?'"</p>

  <p>He looked at me, and I had never seen him so serious.</p>

  <p>"'I've only had one fleeting glimpse at them,' he said, 'and I don't
  propose to do more than that here. But that glimpse was enough to make me
  wish I could steal all his other papers as well.'</p>

  <p>"And it was then, m'sieurs, he told me that he was in your Secret Service,
  and not, as I had thought, just an army officer <i>en permission."</i></p>

  <p>"Just one moment, Madame," said Standish. "This man&mdash;was he
  English?"</p>

  <p>"No. He spoke it well, but with a strong accent."</p>

  <p>"I see. Please go on, Madame, you are interesting as profoundly."</p>

  <p>"We finished our lunch," she continued, "but Jimmy was <i>distrait.</i>
  All the time I could see that he was itching to be gone so that he could
  examine the papers at his leisure. But he was far too clever to appear to he
  in a hurry.</p>

  <p>"'When one comes,' he said, 'to a restaurant where the food is as famous
  as here, one takes one's time. It is over little things like that, that
  mistakes are made. And mistakes in my trade are apt to be dangerous.'</p>

  <p>"So we had our coffee and liqueurs, and it was while we were drinking them
  that the man again came in, this time with a woman of most striking
  appearance. They took the other table, so that I had ample opportunity to
  study her. She was tall, slender, and very made-up, with an expression of
  insolent arrogance. But her expression did not ring true. It was a pose, a
  mask. The woman was bourgeoise.</p>

  <p>"They talked in French, but again that was not their native language. The
  man's was better than his English; the woman's very good. But they were
  neither of them French. I tried to listen, but could hear nothing of any
  interest. Just banalities on food and wine and the beauty of the coast.</p>

  <p>"When our bill was brought, the man came over to our table. I saw Jimmy
  stiffen, but this time it was only to apologise for his apparent rudeness. He
  again stressed the importance of the papers as his excuse, and there the
  matter ended, except that as we got into the car escorted by the
  <i>patron</i> Jimmy enquired their name. It was Pilofsky."</p>

  <p>Madame P&eacute;lain paused and took a sip of Evian water.</p>

  <p>"On the way back," she continued, "we examined the papers. The first was
  covered with writing in a foreign language which Jimmy told me was Russian.
  It was numbered three, and was evidently one of a series. I couldn't read a
  word of it, and was more interested in the second which, at any rate, was
  intelligible. It was a map of England and Scotland in outline. Jimmy said it
  was what you would give to children to fill in the counties. On it were a
  large number of red dots; I should say thirty or forty. In some places they
  were closely grouped together; in others they were scattered. And against
  each dot was a number.</p>

  <p>"These numbers varied considerably. The lowest I saw was 50, the highest
  2,500. But you will understand, m'sieurs, that it was difficult to read in
  the jolting car. However, one thing I did notice. It was in your
  manufacturing districts that the dots were close together, whereas in the
  agricultural areas they were few and far between.</p>

  <p>"I asked Jimmy what he made of it, and he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"'When I get back to the hotel,' he said, 'I'll try and make a rough
  translation of this other document. I know a certain amount of Russian, and I
  may be able to get the gist of it.'</p>

  <p>"He left me the instant we got back, and went to his room, whilst I
  awaited him here. One hour passed, two&mdash;and then he came."</p>

  <p>Once again she paused and the two men craned forward eagerly.</p>

  <p>"M'sieurs," she said deliberately, "I have never seen anyone in such a
  state of suppressed excitement. He was like a man in a fever; he paced up and
  down the room like a maniac.</p>

  <p>"'God!' he exclaimed again and again, 'if only I could get the rest of
  those papers.'</p>

  <p>"At length he calmed down a little, and threw himself into a chair.</p>

  <p>"'A plot,' he said, 'the like of which out-Vernes Jules Verne himself. And
  I'm only on the fringe of it. Or is it the wild fantasy of a diseased
  brain?'</p>

  <p>"Once more he began pacing up and down, talking half to himself.</p>

  <p>"'It's possible...Given the organisation it's possible...And the will to
  carry it through...Listen, Marie, I have made a rough translation of that
  paper. I cannot tell even you what it is; the whole thing is too
  gigantic&mdash;too incredible. It might put you in peril yourself. But I must
  leave for Paris to-night, and then return to England.'</p>

  <p>"Naturally," she continued, "I was very disappointed, but I made no effort
  to dissuade him. To do so would have been wrong, for with a man duty must
  always come first. But I went with him to the station to see him off. And as
  he was stowing his baggage in the sleeper I happened to look along the train.
  Getting into another coach were the Pilofskys; there was no mistaking that
  woman even at a distance. So I told Jimmy, and his face became grave.</p>

  <p>"'I wonder if that means he still suspects me,' he said.</p>

  <p>"'I don't see how he can,' I answered, though I was wondering the same
  thing myself.</p>

  <p>"And then just as the train was starting, he leant out of the window.</p>

  <p>"'If by any chance something happens to me,' he said, 'will you remember
  one thing? Sealed fruit tins.'"</p>

  <p>"Sealed how much?" ejaculated Drummond incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Sealed fruit tins," she repeated. "M'sieur, I was as amazed as you. I
  stared at him with my mouth open, almost wondering if he'd taken leave of his
  senses. And then the train steamed out, and I returned here. Which is all,
  messieurs, that I can tell you." She sighed. "Poor Jimmy!"</p>

  <p>For a space there was silence, whilst Drummond stared at Standish, and
  Standish stared at Drummond. The same thought was in both their minds; was
  the woman trying to pull their legs? All the first part of her story had the
  genuine ring of truth; but the climax was so utterly bizarre, so apparently
  fatuous that it had acted like a douche of cold water.</p>

  <p>"You have no idea what he meant by this strange remark, Madame?" said
  Standish after a while.</p>

  <p><i>"Mais non, m'sieu,"</i> she cried. "It was as incomprehensible to me
  then as it is to you now."</p>

  <p>"There was no little joke that had arisen between you during your
  acquaintanceship that could account for it," he persisted.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Standish," she said with a certain <i>hauteur,</i> "is this the
  moment I would choose to mention little jokes?"</p>

  <p>"I apologise, Madame. But you will, I am sure, agree that the remark seems
  so meaningless that I was trying to exhaust the possibilities of there being
  some commonplace explanation. But if there is none then it is quite certain
  that the words have a definite significance. And what that significance is,
  it must be our job to find out."</p>

  <p>Madame P&eacute;lain lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Both of you are also in the Secret Service?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Something of the sort," admitted Standish with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Then you realise that it is tantamount to signing your death-warrant if
  you proceed."</p>

  <p>"Our death-warrants have been signed so often in the past, Madame," said
  Drummond cheerfully, "that we keep carbon copies to save trouble. As a matter
  of interest, however, why are you so very pessimistic?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him gravely.</p>

  <p>"If it was worth while murdering one man because he was in possession of
  certain information, it is worth while murdering two. And the fact that in
  reality you have not got that information won't help you, if it becomes known
  that you have met me. So far as the other side is concerned, they have no
  idea what Jimmy told me. He might have told me everything, and I might have
  passed it on to you."</p>

  <p>"That is true, Madame," agreed Standish. "What alarms me, however, far
  more than that, is the possibility that you may be in danger."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately, m'sieur, I am a fatalist. I don't know if you have been out
  East; if so you will understand. <i>Tid apa.</i> Nothing matters. Jimmy was a
  dear; I liked him immensely. And if I can do anything to bring his murderer
  to book, you can count on me."</p>

  <p>"Good for you, Madame," cried Drummond approvingly. "At the same time,
  speaking on behalf of all my sex, please be careful."</p>

  <p>She flashed him a swift smile</p>

  <p><i>"Merci, m'sieu,"</i> she murmured. "<i>Vous &ecirc;tes gentil.</i> But what,"
  she continued, becoming practical again, "do you propose to do now?"</p>

  <p>"That requires a little thought," said Standish. "At the moment, it
  doesn't seem to me that there is much more to be found out here."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, Madame," put in Drummond suddenly, "that you have never met a
  man called Charles Burton on the Riviera? He was staying at Nice
  recently."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I do not recall the name," she said. "Burton; no. Do you know at what
  hotel he put up?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," answered Drummond. "Though one should have no difficulty
  in finding that out. He is a gentleman of great wealth, who would certainly
  stop at one of the best."</p>

  <p>"Is he involved in this matter?"</p>

  <p>"We do not know," said Drummond. "We think that possibly he may be. He was
  at Nice while Jimmy was here."</p>

  <p>"Jimmy never mentioned him to me."</p>

  <p>"There was no reason why he should. I doubt if he even knew the man. Well,
  Ronald," he went on, "I think we have kept Madame up quite long enough. What
  about a spot of bed?"</p>

  <p>The two men rose.</p>

  <p>"One minute before you go," she said. "With regard to this Mr. Burton.
  There is a man in Nice&mdash;an Englishman&mdash;who has made it his
  headquarters for years. He is a strange character; very intelligent; very
  cultured; very cosmopolitan. But if anybody can give you information about
  any well-known visitor, he can. His name is Humphrey Gasdon, and he lives at
  the Negresco. If you like you can easily meet him."</p>

  <p>"It must be done with great discretion, Madame," said Standish. "The last
  thing we want is even a hint that Charles Burton is anything but what he
  professes to be."</p>

  <p>"But why should there be any hint? Go, tomorrow, and lunch at the
  Negresco. Humphrey is invariably in the bar before lunch. Equally invariably
  does he talk to all and sundry whom he meets there. Mention that you come
  from this hotel in the most casual manner, and he will almost certainly ask
  if you know me..."</p>

  <p>"Which we don't, Madame," cut in Standish. "Don't forget that. So far as
  is humanly possible we wish to keep you out of this. To-morrow we meet as
  strangers."</p>

  <p>He paused suddenly, staring at Drummond.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>Moving with the silence of a cat, Drummond was crossing towards the door
  that led to Madame P&eacute;lain's bedroom. Crouched double, he flung it open, and
  even as he did so, there came the sound of the door leading into the corridor
  being closed.</p>

  <p>He darted across the room, and opened it. The corridor was empty, but just
  opposite the splash of water proclaimed that someone was turning on a late
  bath.</p>

  <p>He returned to the sitting-room and his face was grave.</p>

  <p>"Too late for that pretence, Ronald," he said. "Someone has been
  listening."</p>

  <p>"Their espionage system is certainly efficient," remarked Standish after a
  pause, watching Drummond who had gone to the sitting-room door and was
  peering out.</p>

  <p>"Still running the water," he said. "This complicates matters," he
  continued, coming back into the room.</p>

  <p>"It's obviously a guest or an employee of the hotel," said Standish
  thoughtfully. "Have you noticed anyone particularly these last two or three
  days, Madame?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Because it is clearly you who are being watched. The same as in London,
  Hugh. They got on to us there through the Chief; they've got on to us here
  through Madame."</p>

  <p>"But, m'sieur," she cried, "have you no inkling at all as to who 'they'
  are?"</p>

  <p>"Not the faintest, Madame," he answered. "But they are thorough in their
  methods, to put it mildly."</p>

  <p>"In any case it simplifies one thing," she said quietly. "Since they know
  you have met me I shall come with you openly to Nice to-morrow for lunch. I
  do not like being spied upon from my bedroom."</p>

  <p>She rose and held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Good night, messieurs. You must assuredly be tired after your long
  run."</p>

  <p>With a nod and a charming smile she dismissed them, and for a moment or
  two they stood talking in low tones outside her door. The bath was still
  occupied and Drummond eyed the door longingly.</p>

  <p>"I would greatly like to see the occupant," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"So would I," agreed Standish. "What do you make of her, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Genuine," said Drummond promptly. "I believe every word she said. I hope
  to Heaven she's in no danger."</p>

  <p>"She is sure to lock her door," answered Standish. "Anyway, old boy, I'm
  practically asleep as it is. We'll make discreet enquiries from Monsieur
  Lidet to-morrow, and see if we can get a line on the listener.
  Night-night."</p>

  <p>He opened his door, and Drummond went on to his own room, where he
  unpacked his bag. Then he undressed and got into bed, to find that all desire
  for sleep had left him. Light was streaming into his room through a frosted
  glass window over the door, and he grew more and more wide awake. And then
  the light went out; save for a faint glimmer from a street lamp outside, the
  room was in darkness.</p>

  <p>From across the road came the low murmur of the sea; except for that the
  night was silent as the tomb. Occasionally the leaves of an acacia tree
  outside his window rustled in a fitful eddy of wind, and once a belated motor
  passed the hotel at speed. Cannes slept; at length he began to feel drowsy
  himself.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he sat up in bed; a dim, flickering light was illuminating the
  glass above the door. It moved jerkily, increasing in power; then it died
  away again, and in a flash Drummond was putting on his dressing-gown.
  Somebody was moving in the passage outside carrying a torch or a candle.</p>

  <p>He crossed to the door, and with infinite care he opened it and peered
  out. And what he saw made him draw in his breath sharply. Some way along the
  corridor a circle of light was shining on a keyhole&mdash;a keyhole into
  which a hand was inserting a key. And the keyhole was that of Madame P&eacute;lain's
  bedroom.</p>

  <p>Not for an instant did he hesitate. The possibility of his appearance on
  the scene proving embarrassing he dismissed as absurd; if Madame was
  entertaining anyone she would hardly expect him to pick the lock. And so it
  transpired that the owner of the hand, though blissfully unconscious of the
  fact, had behind him, two seconds later, a foe more dangerous far than
  anything he had ever imagined in his wildest dreams.</p>

  <p>At length the key turned, and inch by inch the hand pushed the door open.
  Then the torch illuminated the bed, and there came a sigh of relief. Madame,
  breathing a trifle heavily, was fast asleep.</p>

  <p>The torch moved forward; still she did not stir, even when it halted by
  the bed. And then things happened quickly. For the hand that had held the key
  now held a stiletto, and even as it was raised to strike, a scream like a
  rabbit caught by a stoat, came from its owner's throat.</p>

  <p>The dagger and torch dropped from nerveless fingers and still Madame
  slept. Came a crack and a howl of agony, and the room was flooded with light.
  And the owner of the hand, the arm of which was now broken, stared fascinated
  at the terror which had come on him out of the night&mdash;a terror which had
  just been joined by a companion.</p>

  <p>"I heard the commotion, Hugh," said Standish. "What's the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"Attempted murder," answered Drummond, picking up an empty tumbler from
  beside the bed and sniffing it. "Drugged," he said laconically.</p>

  <p>"Who is this little swine?"</p>

  <p>"The would-be murderer. I've just broken his arm. Well, you rat, who and
  what are you?"</p>

  <p>The man scowled and said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Ring the bell, Ronald," said Drummond. "Presumably there's a night porter
  about. We must get Lidet up."</p>

  <p>At length a sleepy-eyed individual came padding along the corridor in
  carpet slippers, and he was promptly despatched to rouse the manager.
  Fortunately no one else seemed to have been awakened by the noise, and when
  Monsieur Lidet arrived a few minutes later he found the two Englishmen
  leaning up against the door smoking.</p>

  <p>"I fear, monsieur," said Drummond, with a smile, "that we are rather
  stormy petrels."</p>

  <p>"But what has happened?" cried the little man.</p>

  <p>"That engaging feller over there endeavoured to murder Madame P&eacute;lain,
  having previously drugged her, with the stiletto you see on the floor."</p>

  <p>"Murder Madame," stammered the manager. "But it is Louis&mdash;one of the
  floor waiters."</p>

  <p>"Nice pleasant manners he's got," said Drummond. "Very suitable for
  bringing one's breakfast."</p>

  <p>"You vile scoundrel," cried Monsieur Lidet in a frenzy. "Have you nothing
  to say?"</p>

  <p>"I should think he's got a lot," remarked Drummond. "But he doesn't seem
  to want to say it."</p>

  <p>"Villain, dastardly villain." The manager was almost beside himself with
  rage. "What did you want to murder Madame for?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head sullenly, and then a groan burst from his lips.</p>

  <p>"I broke his arm for him," explained Drummond. "Well, m'sieur, I suggest
  that you send for the police. Perhaps they will loosen his tongue. And since
  Madame may wake at any moment, I suggest also that we await their arrival
  somewhere else. It might embarrass her to find cohorts of men in the room."
  They went down to the lounge, where he turned to the waiter. "And if you try
  to bolt, you scum, I'll break your other arm."</p>

  <p>But there was no fight left in the would-be murderer; he sat dejectedly in
  a chair with his eyes fixed on the ground awaiting the gendarmes.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Ronald?" said Drummond in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"It's clear that the motive was not robbery," answered Standish. "Having
  drugged her, there was no need to murder her if that was the case. I'm
  inclined to think, old boy, that it was an attempt to kill two birds with one
  stone."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean that if Madame P&eacute;lain had been found dead when she was called
  to-morrow morning, you and I would have been in a very awkward position. We
  were the last people to be with her; our arrival at the hotel and our whole
  interview with her was unusual. And I think we should have found ourselves
  very seriously inconvenienced by enquiries."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we still shall," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Not if we can persuade Lidet to keep his mouth shut. There is no doubt,
  of course, that it was Louis you heard in her bedroom, and there is no doubt
  that it is our arrival here and our interview with her that has caused the
  whole thing. But I don't see why we should tell the police all that&mdash;at
  any rate, at present."</p>

  <p>"He may speak." Drummond jerked his thumb at the waiter.</p>

  <p>"On the other hand he may not. If, as seems fairly obvious, we are up
  against some powerful organisation, he may be frightened to tell the truth.
  Here is Lidet."</p>

  <p>"The police are coming at once," said the manager as he joined them. "It
  is a terrible thing this, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"It might have been very much worse, m'sieur," answered Standish. "Thanks
  to Captain Drummond no harm has actually been done. Which brings me to a
  request I am going to make to you. Had Madame P&eacute;lain been murdered it would,
  of course, have been impossible to keep back anything. But since she is
  unharmed I am going to ask you not to mention what we told you last night
  about Major Latimer."</p>

  <p>"You think there is a connection between the two things?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly. Otherwise the coincidence would be too incredible. We are
  moving in deep waters, M'sieur Lidet; how deep neither Captain Drummond nor I
  have at present any idea. But it will seriously hinder our enquiries if what
  we have told you is made public."</p>

  <p>The manager looked doubtful.</p>

  <p>"But is it fair to Madame?"</p>

  <p>"Let us leave that until Madame can answer the question herself,"
  suggested Standish.</p>

  <p>"What then will you say?"</p>

  <p>"The truth&mdash;so far as it goes. That Captain Drummond being wakeful,
  heard a sound in the corridor and looked out of his room. He saw Madame's
  door being opened, and fearing foul play he dashed along just in time to
  avert a brutal crime. Believe me, m'sieur," he continued earnestly, "there is
  much at stake. We are only on the fringe of things at the moment, and it is
  vital that we should remain free to carry on our investigations. As I said to
  Captain Drummond, I am sure that one object of the attempted crime was to
  incriminate us. Had it succeeded he and I would have been in a nasty hole.
  And that is why I don't want a word said which will enlarge the scope of the
  police enquiry. Let it remain what it appears to be on the surface&mdash;an
  inexplicable attempt at murder."</p>

  <p>"Very good, gentlemen," said the manager. "I will do as you ask. But only
  on the condition that Madame, when she recovers from the effect of the drug,
  must be consulted."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," answered Standish. "I quite agree with you. And now," he
  continued to Drummond as the manager went forward to greet the police who had
  just arrived, "all we can hope for is that that little worm of a waiter keeps
  his mouth shut."</p>

  <p>Which was precisely what he did do. No amount of
  cross-questioning&mdash;an art at which the French police are adept&mdash;had
  the smallest effect. He maintained an air of sullen silence, which even
  threats could not shake. And at length he was removed in custody by the two
  gendarmes, while the sergeant remained behind at the hotel to make a search
  through his belongings. This, too, proved abortive; nothing of the smallest
  interest was discovered. In fact the only information of any value came from
  the head waiter who had been fetched from his bed. According to him the man,
  Louis Fromac was a good and reliable waiter in every way: he would have to be
  so in order to be promoted to a floor, which was always regarded as a prize.
  But, though he never talked of such things in the hotel, he spent most of his
  leisure in a small inn, situated in the old part of the town, which was the
  headquarters of a revolutionary club. So far as he knew the members did no
  harm; they drank much wine and talked interminably.</p>

  <p>"I, too, know that club," said the sergeant. "It is the headquarters of
  the Communists in Cannes." He shrugged his shoulders. "They shout at one
  another without waiting for an answer, and think they are rebuilding the
  world. No, gentlemen, the more I think of it the more do I believe that this
  is one of those strange sex crimes of which one hears from time to time. It
  is more a matter for a doctor than for the police. But I will return
  to-morrow morning when Madame is recovered, and see if perchance she can
  throw any light on his motive."</p>

  <p>He bowed to the three men, and left the hotel.</p>

  <p>"His theory suits us, Hugh," said Standish as they walked up the stairs.
  "And the one thing we've got to do is to get Madame's ear before the worthy
  sergeant does his stuff."</p>

  <p>"Anything in this Communist business?" remarked Drummond thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me to be the one ray in the darkness," said Standish. "Though
  what the links are between Charles Burton, millionaire, and Louis Fromac,
  waiter, is a bit obscure."</p>

  <p>"Think so, Ronald? I don't. The links are two sleepy Englishmen, one of
  whom, at any rate, is now going to bed. Night-night."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">IV. &mdash; FAIR WARNING</a></h2>

  <p>Their luck was in next day. It seemed to Drummond that his head had only
  touched the pillow when he was awakened by a waiter with a note. It was from
  Madame P&eacute;lain.</p>

  <p>"Please come to my sitting-room at once."</p>

  <p>The sun was pouring in at the window as he shaved rapidly, and then
  scrambled into his clothes. And as he stepped into the corridor he ran into
  Standish evidently bound on the same errand.</p>

  <p>Madame was in a peignoir, and though pale she was completely
  self-possessed.</p>

  <p>"There is no time to lose," she began at once. "The sergeant of police is
  waiting below to see me. I have heard what has happened from Monsieur Lidet;
  I have heard, Captain Drummond, that I owe you my life. But the immediate
  point is, what am I to say to the sergeant? Lidet has told me the line you
  took up last night; is that what you want me to stick to?"</p>

  <p>"It is, Madame," said Standish promptly.</p>

  <p>The telephone jangled on the table, and she picked up the receiver.</p>

  <p><i>"En cinq minutes,"</i> she said.</p>

  <p>"You wish me to profess complete ignorance as to the reason of this
  waiter's action?</p>

  <p>"Please, Madame."</p>

  <p>"It was, of course, connected with Jimmy's death and our interview last
  night."</p>

  <p>"I see no other possibility," said Standish. "But with all due deference
  to the worthy sergeant, I think we are more likely to progress if he knows
  nothing about it."</p>

  <p>"Very good, messieurs. I will do as you say. It will be well now if you
  return to your rooms. We must not let the sergeant think that we have been
  arranging things. Come back in half an hour."</p>

  <p>They bowed and left her.</p>

  <p>"A worth-while ally, Ronald," said Drummond. "I liked that prompt,
  unquestioning acquiescence. Come and bite a roll in my room."</p>

  <p>Standish poured himself out a cup of coffee and strolled over to the
  window.</p>

  <p>"Worth while she may be, old boy," he agreed, "but it complicates matters.
  I don't quite know what we're going to do about her. There are other Louis
  Fromacs, and next time you may not be awake."</p>

  <p>"You think they'll have another dip at her?"</p>

  <p>"We dare not risk them not doing so. Though everything depends, of course,
  on the motive behind the attempt on her life. If it was merely to involve us
  with the police, and keep us tied by the heels here for some days, then she
  would be safe the instant we leave Cannes. But if there was any question of
  revenge in the matter, or if they have decided that she knows too much, she
  won't be safe wherever we are."</p>

  <p>"If it was a question of her knowing too much, why did they wait to
  strike? They could have doped her two nights ago."</p>

  <p>"That's perfectly true." Standish lit a cigarette. "And yet there is a
  certain Machiavellian cunning in getting at us through her which I should
  have said was a bit above a waiter's form."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear fellow, Fromac is very small beer. He was only carrying out
  instructions."</p>

  <p>"When did he get 'em? No one knew we were coming here till we
  arrived."</p>

  <p>"Not you and I personally, I grant you. But they must have guessed that
  <i>somebody</i> would arrive here to pump the lady. At any rate they took
  precautions in case anybody did come. If they were wrong, and no one came,
  then she was safe. There was no point in murdering her unnecessarily. What is
  more," continued Drummond, "it seems to me that there is no object in
  murdering her at all now. So far as they know we two are in possession of all
  the dope, so that getting her out of the way is merely bolting the stable
  door after the horse has hopped it. It's you and I, old son, who will have to
  watch our step."</p>

  <p>"That's nothing new," said Standish with a grin. "I wonder who this man
  Gasdon is she wants us to meet," he went on thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What I wonder a darned sight more," remarked Drummond, "is what poor old
  Jimmy meant by sealed fruit tins."</p>

  <p>There came a knock at the door, and Monsieur Lidet entered.</p>

  <p>"None the worse, I trust, gentlemen," he asked solicitously, "for your
  disturbed night?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit, thank you," answered Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Since the matter was bound to come out, I have let it be understood that
  the whole thing was an attempt on Madame's jewels," continued the manager.
  "It is as good a story as any other and it will satisfy the visitors. By the
  way, the sergeant is interrogating Madame now."</p>

  <p>"We have already seen Madame," said Standish. "She has agreed to follow
  our suggestion as to what she tells him."</p>

  <p>"Then the condition I made is fulfilled, gentlemen. And as for me, my lips
  are sealed. But I confess to an overwhelming curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Which I can assure you we would gratify if we knew the answer ourselves,"
  said Standish frankly. "But we are every bit as much in the dark as you are.
  There is, perhaps, one thing you could do for us," he added as an
  afterthought. "A Mr. Charles Burton was stopping at Nice about a week or ten
  days ago. Could you find out at what hotel he was staying and when he left?
  He is a man of considerable wealth, and so it would probably be one of the
  biggest."</p>

  <p>"I will do so at once," cried Monsieur Lidet. "I have below the <i>listes
  des etrangers</i> of the past month."</p>

  <p>He bustled out of the room, and a few moments later the telephone rang.
  Drummond answered it.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, m'sieur," he said when the voice ceased. "That is just what we
  wanted to know."</p>

  <p>He replaced the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Burton stayed at the Ruhl for the inside of a fortnight," he said. "He
  left last Friday."</p>

  <p>"Before the Pilofsky episode at Chez Paquay."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. Before that episode. It is, therefore, clear that Burton's
  departure was quite unconnected with Jimmy getting those papers."</p>

  <p>"So that if Burton murdered him it was because of what he learned from
  Pilofsky."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," said Drummond. "Pilofsky followed Jimmy to Paris, and there
  told Burton what had happened. My hat! old man, those papers must have been
  important. Remember Pilofsky had no proof that Jimmy had got them. And yet
  the bare chance of his having them was enough for murder."</p>

  <p>"Jimmy's sudden change of plan was suspicious. Pilofsky would have had no
  difficulty in tracing him to this hotel. He could have made enquiries from
  the driver of the car the instant he first suspected anything at Chez Paquay.
  Then it was easy money to discover that Jimmy, after taking on his room that
  very morning, had suddenly decided to leave. And a bloke who's running round
  with a delightful woman like Madame P&eacute;lain doesn't do that without a mighty
  good reason."</p>

  <p>Once again the telephone rang; this time it was the lady herself to say
  that the police had gone and that she would like to see them.</p>

  <p>"First and foremost," she said as they entered her sitting-room, "I want
  to thank you, Captain Drummond, for what you did."</p>

  <p>"It was nothing, Madame," said Drummond lightly. "The astounding piece of
  luck was that I happened to be awake, in view of how infernally sleepy I'd
  felt a bit earlier on."</p>

  <p>"Even so, <i>mon ami,</i> not everyone would have troubled to get out of
  bed in the middle of the night as you did. However," she added with a smile,
  "it is not difficult to see that you are the type of man who would loathe any
  further allusion to the subject."</p>

  <p>"You're quite right there, Madame," laughed Standish. "He might even
  blush."</p>

  <p>"And so," she continued, "let's come to the next point. What do we do
  now?"</p>

  <p>The laugh faded; Standish looked at her gravely.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said, "there is no good in beating about the bush. Last
  night's events prove conclusively that we are up against a powerful and
  dangerous organisation. What that organisation is it is Captain Drummond's
  and my job to try and find out. With you, however, it is a different matter
  altogether. You have become mixed up in it by a sheer accident, and to be
  perfectly frank I do not see that you can help us any more. You have told us
  all you know, and it merely means that you are running an unnecessary risk by
  remaining here."</p>

  <p>"What then do you suggest that I should do?" she asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Disappear, at any rate temporarily," answered Standish. "Go on a motor
  tour; anything you like. It will be necessary for us to remain here for a day
  or two over this Fromac affair, but then we shall be returning to England
  ourselves. And I know that we shall both feel easier in our minds if we know
  you are safe."</p>

  <p>"What about Humphrey Gasdon?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The main object in meeting him has gone," said Standish. "We have found
  out from Lidet about Charles Burton. He left the Ruhl in Nice last Friday.
  From there he went to Paris."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," she said thoughtfully, "I would like you to meet Humphrey.
  I have a feeling, Mr. Standish, that he can help you. As I told you last
  night he is a strange man, with an almost uncanny knowledge of all sorts of
  strange things."</p>

  <p>"Well, Madame," remarked Standish, "from what you said there should be no
  difficulty in making his acquaintance at the bar."</p>

  <p>"None. For all that, I think I will come too."</p>

  <p>"Stop, please," she said with a smile as Standish started to protest.
  "Your solicitude for my safety is very sweet and I appreciate it. But I am
  not going to run away from here because a miserable waiter tries to stab me.
  And that being the case I, personally, shall lunch with Humphrey to-day. I
  want his opinion on this strange attempt on my life. You and Captain Drummond
  must, of course, please yourselves. But should you happen to be in the bar of
  the Negresco at twelve o'clock to-day we could doubtless all lunch
  together."</p>

  <p>"We capitulate, Madame," laughed Standish. "So may we have the pleasure of
  taking you over?"</p>

  <p><i>"Enchant&eacute;e, m' sieu.</i> I will be in the lounge at eleven thirty."</p>

  <p>"What about a leg-stretcher?" said Drummond as they went down the stairs,
  but Standish shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not for me, old boy. Developments in this affair are so rapid that a full
  report to the Chief is indicated."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," said Drummond. "Thank God! no one can read my
  writing, so get to it, my trusty old comrade."</p>

  <p>He strolled through the open door and across the promenade. The sea was at
  its bluest, and for a while he stood, with eyes half closed, accustoming
  himself to the glare. To the right behind the Casino lay the harbour full of
  yachts of all sizes, and after a time he sauntered in that direction. How
  often, he reflected savagely, must Jimmy have taken the same stroll!</p>

  <p>By the door of the Casino he paused; should he go in and have a look at
  the papers? He decided he would and, after getting the <i>Continental Daily
  Mail</i> from the reading-room, he threw himself into an easy chair by the
  big window in the bar.</p>

  <p>The place was almost empty, and beckoning to the barman he ordered some
  beer. And it was while he was consuming it, resignedly&mdash;in Drummond's
  estimation, French beer was an outrage on public decency, and a probable
  cause of civil riot&mdash;that he noticed two men standing by the door in
  earnest conversation. And suddenly one of them glanced at him, only to look
  away immediately on catching his eye.</p>

  <p>A faint smile twitched round his lips; some more developments for
  Standish. Then from behind his paper he waited the next move.</p>

  <p>It came shortly. One man left the place; the other having given an order
  to the barman, came over to the window and took the easy chair next to
  his.</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond, I believe," he began without any preamble.</p>

  <p>"Your belief is correct," said Drummond. "Though I fear you have the
  advantage of me."</p>

  <p>"My name is quite immaterial," remarked the stranger lighting a cigarette.
  "From what happened at the hotel last night I gather that you are a man of
  prompt action. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Drummond stared at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Let us proceed on that assumption," he said.</p>

  <p>"Good. I am going to suggest a very prompt action to you now."</p>

  <p>Drummond raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Very kind of you," he drawled. "I am agog with excitement."</p>

  <p>"It is," continued the man calmly, "that you quit this place, and go on
  quitting. That you disappear entirely from the haunts of men, you and your
  friend&mdash;and hide yourselves, where not even your wife, if you have one,
  can find you."</p>

  <p>"Splendid," cried Drummond, pouring out some more beer. "May I ask why you
  suggest those somewhat drastic manoeuvres?"</p>

  <p>"For the simple reason that if you don't do what I say you will be killed
  as surely as night follows day. You laugh, but I can assure you, Captain
  Drummond, that it is no laughing matter. I myself am running a grave risk in
  talking to you. But I disapprove of life being taken unless it is
  unavoidable. And so I am warning you; disappear. For you have no more chance
  of escaping, if you continue on your present line, than a moth has of coming
  alive out of a killing-bottle."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, your solicitude for my safety is as touching as your
  simile is apt. What, precisely, may I ask, <i>is</i> my present line?"</p>

  <p>"You are out here in connection with the death of Major Latimer," answered
  the man quietly. "Further enquiries on that subject can only result in your
  own. So if you take my advice you will beat it while the going is good."</p>

  <p>The man drained his glass and rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," he went on, "that I am not exaggerating. I am speaking
  honest, unvarnished truth. You are meddling in things of the magnitude of
  which even I have only a hazy idea. And if you go on doing so you will die
  with the utmost certainty. Good morning."</p>

  <p>"It would be a much better one if this beer wasn't so foul," said
  Drummond. "However, I'm much obliged to you for our entertaining little
  chat."</p>

  <p>He watched the man till he was out of sight; then he beckoned to the
  bar-tender.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea who that gentleman was?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None at all, sir," said the barman. "I've never seen him before."</p>

  <p>Drummond lit a cigarette, and lay back in his chair. That the man had been
  in earnest he had no doubt. The quiet way in which he had spoken, the
  complete absence of any truculence or threats, proved that. And the calm
  assurance with which he had mentioned Jimmy Latimer showed that he had
  reliable inside information.</p>

  <p>It was very decent of the man, reflected Drummond. What he had said about
  the risk he ran himself was in all probability correct. And he had done it
  for an absolute stranger. The point to be decided, however, was what notice,
  if any, should be taken of the warning.</p>

  <p>All through his long and troublous career, there was one mistake Drummond
  had never committed; he had never underestimated his opponents. And the
  extreme efficiency of the staff work on the other side, in this case, showed
  that it was doubly important not to do so now. The difficulty lay in the fact
  that neither Standish nor he knew who those opponents were, whereas they
  themselves were marked down. As things stood at the moment, the dice were
  heavily loaded against them. Moreover, he failed to see how that state of
  affairs could be rectified unless they actually did what the stranger had
  recommended&mdash;disappear.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he saw Standish strolling along the road outside, and knocking on
  the window he beckoned him in.</p>

  <p>"I've had a little chat since I left you, Ronald." he said. "With a
  stranger of kindly disposition."</p>

  <p>Standish listened in silence, though his face became more and more
  grave.</p>

  <p>"It's not the threat of death that I mind," he said when Drummond had
  finished. "We're used to that. It's the infernal quickness of their
  information bureau."</p>

  <p>"Have you got that letter off to the Chief?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. But I'll send along a postscript about this. In any event one thing
  is now absolutely <i>proved</i>. Jimmy was murdered."</p>

  <p>"That's so." Drummond glanced at his watch. "What about this lunch?"</p>

  <p>"I'm still for going. It won't compromise Madame P&eacute;lain more than she is
  compromised already, and the whole thing is so incredibly obscure that any
  chance of a ray of light ought not to be missed. But we'd better watch our
  step with the gentleman."</p>

  <p>"You bet your life," said Drummond. "Let's get the bus."</p>

  <p>They walked in silence through the drifting crowd of loiterers, each busy
  with his own thoughts. It was a perfect Riviera day, and the sun had brought
  the antiques from their lairs in droves. Vendors of tinted spectacles
  proffered their wares hopefully; it seemed impossible that there could be
  anything dark and sinister under the surface. And when they brought the car
  round to the hotel to find Madame P&eacute;lain waiting for them, completely
  surrounded by the knitting brigade, it seemed more impossible still. Nothing
  more nerve-shattering than a dropped stitch could ever happen in such an
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>She seemed in no way surprised when Drummond told her of his encounter in
  the Casino. But her reaction to it was very definite.</p>

  <p>"It is what you must both do, my friends. I have been thinking things over
  since I saw you. When you leave Cannes you must vanish into thin air. If, as
  we think, big things are afoot, you must become the hunters and not the
  hunted. It is they who must be in ignorance of where you are going to strike;
  not the other way round, as it is at the moment."</p>

  <p>"There is a lot in what you say, Madame," said Standish. "And my own
  inclination would be to get away at once. The trouble is the police
  formalities over last night."</p>

  <p>"I think," she said, "that I can probably arrange matters over that. For
  I, too, have come to the conclusion that Cannes is not the only place in the
  world. And if I announce my intention of not pressing the charge against the
  wretched man, there should not be much bother."</p>

  <p>She smiled slightly.</p>

  <p>"Our police are very amenable at times."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you have decided that," remarked Drummond. "We shall both feel
  easier in our minds And even though I think that as soon as we have gone you
  will be safe, don't relax your guard, Madame. I am beginning to have a very
  healthy respect for these gentlemen, whoever they may be."</p>

  <p>They swung into the Promenade des Anglais and a few minutes later pulled
  up outside the Negresco.</p>

  <p>"Now let us see if we are in luck," she said, as they entered the hotel.
  "We are; the man himself."</p>

  <p>A tall, hatchet-faced man was standing by the concierge's desk glancing
  through a bundle of letters. On one cheek was the scar of an old wound, and
  his hands were the hands of a man on whose face such a mark would cause no
  surprise. His hair was greying; his age, the early fifties. And both Drummond
  and Standish, than whom no better judges of a man existed, metaphorically put
  their thumbs up.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Humphrey."</p>

  <p>With a start he looked up.</p>

  <p>"Marie!" he cried, and bending over kissed her hand&mdash;an action which
  only one Englishman in a hundred can do without looking a fool. "This is
  delightful. You will join me in an aperitif?"</p>

  <p>"Humphrey, I want you to meet two friends of mine&mdash;Captain Drummond
  and Mr. Standish."</p>

  <p>"Delighted. Let us become further acquainted in the bar. My mail seems
  more unbelievably dull than usual. And now"&mdash;when they were settled in a
  corner&mdash;"tell me what fortunate chance has brought you here?"</p>

  <p>"Easily told," she laughed. "The fact that Captain Drummond couldn't sleep
  last night."</p>

  <p>"I fear I may seem dense," he said with a smile, "but I think you must
  admit that your remark requires a little elucidation."</p>

  <p>He listened in silence, and when she had finished, he lit a cigarette
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate you, Captain Drummond," he said at length. "Though you
  hardly look the sort of bloke with whom congratulations cut much ice. What a
  very remarkable story."</p>

  <p>"Can you throw any light on the darkness, Humphrey?" And then she gave a
  sudden exclamation. "Look, Captain Drummond," she whispered. "Just coming
  into the bar now. Madame Pilofsky."</p>

  <p>Drummond glanced up, and as quickly looked away again.</p>

  <p>"Pilofsky," he muttered. "Ronald, it's Madame Tomesco."</p>

  <p>"Pilofsky!" drawled Humphrey Gasdon, as she went back into the hall.
  "Tomesco! A rose by any name, etc. What seems more to the point, however,
  than the name, is the rose itself."</p>

  <p>"Do you know the lady?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"By sight&mdash;well."</p>

  <p>"Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"The mistress of one of the most dangerous men in
  Europe&mdash;Menalin."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" cried Standish. "The Russian financier."</p>

  <p>"Is he Russian? Who knows? He is cosmopolitan. He knows no country; he
  cares for no country. He cares for nothing in this world save himself. And he
  is mad."</p>

  <p>"Mad!" echoed Standish.</p>

  <p>"Not in the sense of a man who thinks he is a poached egg and calls for
  toast to sit down on. But in an infinitely more dangerous way. He is the
  worlds supreme megalomaniac, and the main driving passion of his life is his
  hatred of Britain and things British&mdash;a sentiment which he does not
  share alone."</p>

  <p>"Now, Humphrey." Madame P&eacute;lain shook an admonitory finger at him.</p>

  <p>"It's no good doing that, Marie. I know you think I've got a bee in my
  bonnet over it, but I know also that you know I'm right."</p>

  <p>"You think as a nation we are disliked?" said Standish.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, we always have been. But in days gone by we were, at any
  rate, feared and respected. Now we are neither. How the devil can we expect
  to be when our armed strength might just cope with a three years' defensive
  war against Guatemala?"</p>

  <p>"A slight exaggeration," smiled Standish.</p>

  <p>"But with a very nasty element of truth in it. To me, living abroad, the
  thing is simply unbelievable as it is to every intelligent foreigner. <i>Quem
  Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.</i> One or two men at home have the
  courage to proclaim the truth; but the vast majority don't care."</p>

  <p>"You've got the League of Nations, Humphrey," said Madame P&eacute;lain.</p>

  <p>"League of Fiddlesticks, my dear," he answered. "If that damned hot air
  factory was anything resembling what it set out to be originally, there would
  be something in what you say. But we're not dealing with what might have
  been; we're dealing with reality.. And it is my considered opinion that as it
  stands the League of Nations is the greatest menace to peace that exists in
  the world to-day. It is the sand into which, ostrich-like, England has
  stuffed her great fat head, and believing it to be a safeguard against future
  war has proceeded to disarm. Sorry," he continued with a short laugh, "but it
  makes me hot under the collar. Look, you people, on this picture and on
  that."</p>

  <p>From his pocket-book he extracted two cuttings.</p>

  <p>"If I may, I will read them to you. Here is the first;</p>

  <blockquote>
    "'BROADCAST TO SIX MILLION.<br>
    <br>
    "'Six million Hitler boys and girls listened to this new version of the
    creed broadcast by all German stations from Leipzig, where a harvest
    festival of the Hitler Youth Organisation was celebrated (reported Reuter
    yesterday);<br>
    <br>
    "'I believe in the community of all Germans, in a life of service to this
    community; I believe in the revelation of the God-given creative force, in
    pure blood shed in war and peace by the sons of the community of the German
    people buried in the earth, hallowed by it, resurrected and living in all
    for whom the sacrifice was made.<br>
    <br>
    "'I believe in an eternal life of this shed and resurrected blood on earth
    in all who acknowledge the means of this sacrifice and are prepared to bow
    themselves down. Therefore, I believe in an eternal God, in an eternal
    Germany, and in an eternal life.'
  </blockquote>

  <p>"And here is the other;</p>

  <blockquote>
    "'BISHOP CONDEMNS PACIFISTS.<br>
    <br>
    "'The Bishop of Sussex strongly disapproves of the Oxford Union's decision
    that "in no circumstances will its members fight for King and country."'"
  </blockquote>

  <p>"More power to his Grace's elbow! But does he really imagine his
  disapproval will make 'em fight? Not on your life. They'll be lining the
  streets hopefully throwing red, red flowers at the great, blonde, fascinating
  brutes as they march in."</p>

  <p>He replaced the two cuttings in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Comment is unnecessary. You may not like the first, but, by Heaven above,
  it doesn't produce a strong desire to vomit like the second."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gasdon," said Standish, who had been whispering to Drummond, "it
  seems fairly obvious that you are, so to speak, one of the boys. And so with
  Drummond's approval, I am going to take you fully into our confidence. Madame
  P&eacute;lain has not told you everything. So if you can spare half an hour I would
  like to put you wise. Only I must have your word that you won't pass it
  on."</p>

  <p>"You have it," said Gasdon briefly.</p>

  <p>He listened with half-closed eyes as Standish told him the whole story,
  omitting nothing And on its conclusion he lay back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"How extraordinarily interesting," he remarked. "Let us get one or two
  things straight. It is, of course, obvious that the Madame Pilofsky of Chez
  Paquay would recognise you, Marie. What about the Madame Tomesco of the
  Golden Boot? Would she recognise you, Captain Drummond?"</p>

  <p>"Hard to say," said Drummond. "She had no cause to look at me that night,
  and my back was towards her. But I wouldn't bank on it."</p>

  <p>"And this Charles Burton. Is he a dark swarthy man?"</p>

  <p>"The very reverse."</p>

  <p>"Then he can't be Menalin under an assumed name. But since he was in the
  company of Menalin's mistress, it seems probable the two men know each other.
  And that throws a pretty sinister light on Mr. Charles Burton. Surely our
  police&mdash;for, whatever I may have said about our country as a whole, they
  are still the finest in the world&mdash;surely, they can get a line on
  him."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget," said Standish, "that it was only on Jimmy Latimer's death
  that the gentleman came into the limelight at all. And, but for Colonel
  Talbot's long shot, he wouldn't have done so even then."</p>

  <p>"That's true," agreed Gasdon.</p>

  <p>"And now that we know, from what you've told us, that he wants watching,
  he will certainly be watched."</p>

  <p>"You say, Marie, that Major Latimer was greatly excited by the contents of
  the papers," said Gasdon. "Very excited indeed. Gigantic; incredible; those
  were the words he used."</p>

  <p>"And he was a man on whose judgment you would rely?"</p>

  <p>"Emphatically," said Standish.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if it's possible that they're going to have a dip at us before
  our so-called rearmament takes place."</p>

  <p>"Who?" cried Standish.</p>

  <p>Gasdon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"France hates us, and only the fact that she is terrified of Germany
  prevents her showing it. Italy frankly detests us, and small blame to her.
  Germany is an armed camp. Russia&mdash;well, Russia is a problem."</p>

  <p>"Not the Communist bogey, surely," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Are you quite sure it is such a bogey?" asked Gasdon quietly. "What about
  France recently, and Belgium? And Spain? They're fanatics, you know, and
  fanatics are dangerous men. Moreover they've always looked on us and our
  empire as the principle stronghold of all that they're up against."</p>

  <p>"Jimmy said, given the organisation, it is possible," said Madame P&eacute;lain.
  "And the will to carry it through."</p>

  <p>"Both could come from Menalin," remarked Gasdon. "Mark you, I don't say
  I'm right, but clearly it is something very much out of the ordinary, and
  Menalin is mixed up in it. And since Latimer was hurrying home it seems
  probable that England is involved."</p>

  <p>"The idea seems almost fantastic," said Standish thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>Gasdon gave a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"Why? Fantastic perhaps when judged by the standards of even ten years
  ago. But is it fantastic now? We've got the biggest orchard in the world to
  rob, and one of the smallest forces to defend it with. We should, of course,
  regard it as a distinctly caddish action on the aggressor's part, and in the
  intervals of talking about the old school tie we should ask Honduras to apply
  sanctions. Damn it, man! When will our people begin to understand that
  because we don't want to go to war with anyone, having got all we want
  already, it doesn't follow that other nations feel the same about us. Lead me
  to alcohol; I get heated."</p>

  <p>He beckoned to a waiter.</p>

  <p>"What are those immortal lines of Sir William Watson?" he continued.</p>

  <blockquote style="font-style:italic">
    "'Time and the ocean, and some fostering star,<br>
    In high cabal have made us what we are.'
  </blockquote>

  <p>"Would he&mdash;<i>could</i> he&mdash;have written that to-day? At the
  present moment our fostering star is 'the voice that breathed o'er Eden': the
  ocean is as much use as a sick headache compared with the air, and in the
  next war we shan't have any time. However, I've been talking out of my turn.
  A desire for food is upon me. You will, I hope, all lunch with me, and we
  will forget such trifling matters in the joys of the chef's excellent
  <i>bouillabaisse."</i></p>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">V. &mdash; GLOVES OFF</a></h2>

  <p>Throughout the meal they discussed the matter from every angle, and the
  more Drummond and Standish saw of Humphrey Gasdon the more did they like him.
  From casual remarks he made it was evident that he had travelled not only
  widely but intelligently. Moreover he knew people as well as places, which
  was what was wanted in their present investigation. And towards the end of
  lunch his audience was more than half converted.</p>

  <p>"There are two main questions to be answered," was his argument.
  "First&mdash;is it worth while? To that my answer is&mdash;yes, if it can be
  done rapidly; no, if it can't. Another war, such as the last one, dragging on
  for four years, would be sheer madness. But will it drag on for four years?
  Will there be time for us laboriously to build up our fighting forces after
  it has begun? We have it on the authority of Ludendorff himself that next
  time there will be no declaration of war beforehand. Which brings us to the
  other main point. Is it possible to knock us out in the first few weeks? That
  obviously only the experts can answer. But one does not require to be an
  expert to see that if it <i>is</i> possible, it may be worth while
  trying."</p>

  <p>"Out-Vernes Jules Verne," said Standish half to himself. "I wonder if
  you're right, Gasdon."</p>

  <p>"Lord knows!" The other drained his <i>fin champagne</i>. "But I'm
  certainly coming over to with you to see. That is if we ever get there," he
  added with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"As bad as that, you think?" said Drummond.</p>

  <p>Gasdon nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is clear from what happened to you, Marie, that the Reds are mixed up
  in it. Which means rather more over here than, at present, it does in
  England. There, up to date, they've stopped short of murder. Here it's a
  common occurrence. And really it's not surprising. When you remember that the
  casualty list for the first four years of the U.S.S.R. was one million, eight
  hundred thousand dead, a few more thousand don't cut much ice."</p>

  <p>"Is that really so?" cried Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Certainly it is so. There it was the direct doing of the big men; here,
  as last night, it is an isolated job delegated by someone at the top to a
  local branch which obeys blindly. Do you remember the case of that White
  general in Paris who was reputed to have disappeared? Disappear my foot t He
  was murdered in broad daylight. An ambulance drove up behind him as he was
  strolling along, and the man beside the driver shot him from point-blank
  range with a gun fitted with a silencer. Before anybody had realised what had
  happened they had thrown the body inside and were off. That's how <i>he</i>
  disappeared. Another case I know of was that of the editor of a very anti-Red
  paper. He was reputed to have died of a heart attack when drinking an
  aperitif at his favourite caf&eacute;. He certainly had a heart attack, but it was
  brought on by having his drink poisoned. One man engaged him in conversation,
  his accomplice slipped the stuff into his glass. No, no, friends; do not, I
  beg of you, be under any delusions. As I say it has not got so far as that in
  England yet, but it is only a question of time. They've got all the necessary
  organisation there. And when you are dealing with a fanatic who is prepared
  to sacrifice his own life, if need be, provided he gets yours, and who, in
  addition, knows you while you don't know him, the thing becomes a little
  difficult."</p>

  <p>Standish lit a cigarette; then, with his elbows on the table, he leaned
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Let us work on the assumption, Gasdon, that you are right. What is to be
  our plan of campaign? First of all, who is on the marked list on our side?
  Drummond and I, naturally; Madame; and since we've lunched with you I'm
  afraid you must join the happy band."</p>

  <p>"Don't let that give you indigestion," said Gasdon with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Is there anyone else?"</p>

  <p>"Not over here," said Drummond. "But in England there's the Chief."</p>

  <p>"Right. Add him in. Now, exactly what do we want to do, and how do we
  propose to do it?"</p>

  <p>"First part easy," answered Drummond. "Get over to England."</p>

  <p>"And miss out Paris?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," said Drummond. "Now that we <i>know</i> what we do I see no
  object in going there. What more is there to find out in France? It doesn't
  matter <i>how</i> Burton got on Jimmy's tracks; all that matters is that he
  did. Our job is to reverse proceedings and get on to Burton. He's the key to
  the situation."</p>

  <p>"Make it so," said Standish. "And now, Madame, the next point is your
  charming self. What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I beg of you, Mr. Standish, not to worry about me. Concentrate entirely
  on your own plans."</p>

  <p>"My dear Marie, that is impossible," said Gasdon seriously. "It is
  essential that we should feel that you are safe. And I do most solemnly
  assure you that the danger is very real."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you suggest, Humphrey?"</p>

  <p>"Have you any friends with a villa near here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; at Mentone."</p>

  <p>"Excellent. Now it is most unlikely that you were followed here. Since all
  your kit is still at the Metropole, they will assume that you are returning
  there. My suggestion, therefore, is this. That you let me drive you to your
  friend's villa direct from here. I am fairly adept at the game, and I think I
  can spot at once if we are followed. From there you will telephone to
  Monsieur Lidet, but you will not give your address even to him. You will say
  that you will be returning in a week or a fortnight to the hotel, and give
  instructions for your room to be left intact. To your friends you can say as
  much or as little of the truth as you like. What necessaries you require your
  friend can obtain for you, but you yourself will lie low in the villa. Should
  the police make further enquiries with regard to last night, instruct Lidet
  to say that you are ill, and that he does not know where you are."</p>

  <p>For a while she sat in silence, then; "You think that is best?"</p>

  <p>"We all do, Madame," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Very well, <i>mes amis;</i> I will do it. And you&mdash;what of you?"</p>

  <p>"I would not presume to suggest a plan to you two fellows," said Gasdon.
  "But if you take my most earnest advice you, too, will not return to the
  Metropole."</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking the same thing myself," remarked Standish. "I am
  certainly prepared to sacrifice my kit, such as it is."</p>

  <p>"Same here," said Drummond. "And we can post a five-hundred-franc note to
  Lidet from somewhere en route. Were you serious when you said you were coming
  over to England, Gasdon?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. If you have no objections I would like to come with you.
  Otherwise I will travel alone."</p>

  <p>Drummond glanced at Standish, who nodded.</p>

  <p>"Of course we have no objections," he said. "And it will certainly be easy
  to see on the run north if we are being followed."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid, Drummond, that your kit is not the only thing you'll have to
  sacrifice temporarily," said Gasdon. "What is the object in following us?
  Just as Latimer's goal was England, they'll know that yours is. And when you
  don't return to the hotel, they'll warn every port, if they haven't done so
  already, to watch out, not for you, but for your car. They're not the sort of
  people who would neglect such an obvious precaution as taking its number. And
  on the chance of your going to Paris they'll have spies at the Porte
  d'Italie, and the Porte de la Gare. No, old boy, I'm afraid you'll have to
  leave her in <i>la belle France</i> for the time. At some such place as
  Orleans. You see," he went on, "what Standish said is perfectly correct. They
  got you taped in Cannes through Madame. But if you, or rather we, now vanish
  into space they must lose the trail unless we throw the car at their heads.
  Their spies at Boulogne or Calais don't know us personally."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," agreed Standish. "The man speaks sense. Well, I suggest,
  Gasdon, that the sooner we get on with it the better. Madame, I am not going
  to say an obvious good-bye. In case there is anybody watching us it's better
  that he should think we are just parting after lunch. But may I thank you
  from the bottom of my heart for all that you have done and told us."</p>

  <p>"It was nothing," she said sadly, "if it has helped to revenge Jimmy.
  Good-bye; good-bye, Captain Drummond. I won't thank <i>you</i> again."</p>

  <p>"And we will wait for you here, Gasdon," said Standish.</p>

  <p>"Right. Sit in the bar, and keep your backs to the wall."</p>

  <p>They sauntered across the room&mdash;a typical lunch party breaking up.
  And in the hall they paused.</p>

  <p>"So we dine together to-night, Madame," said Drummond. "I will see that
  Monsieur Lidet excels himself."</p>

  <p>"And after that the Casino," she cried. "<i>Au revoir</i>."</p>

  <p>"A damned plucky little woman," said Standish as they walked into the
  bar.</p>

  <p>"And I hope a fortunate remark of mine," said Drummond. "Did you see the
  gentleman in the hall who half rose as we left the dining-room, and then sat
  down again?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't."</p>

  <p>"He was behind you, but I marked him down. Strikes me, old boy, that their
  staff work is marvellous, but that the actual performers are not so
  good."</p>

  <p>"Full marks, I think, to Mr. Humphrey Gasdon."</p>

  <p>"Yes. Definitely good value. And a bloke of decided views. I wonder if
  he's right about this Communist stunt."</p>

  <p>"He's right over one thing," said Standish. "They've got the necessary
  organisation in the country. That I know for a certainty: factory cells,
  street cells, the necessary instructors, street newspapers. All of which is
  well known to the police. But taking it by and large, they have so far failed
  to make much headway. Our fellows in the main have too much common sense, I
  suppose. Hullo Here's the girl friend once again. I wonder who the lucky boy
  is this time."</p>

  <p>Madame Tomesco, <i>alias</i> Pilofsky, had entered the bar accompanied by
  a man.</p>

  <p>"Dark and swarthy," muttered Drummond. "Perhaps it's Menalin himself."</p>

  <p>As the two passed their table the lady's escort paused slightly and gave
  them each a cool and deliberate stare from under a pair of bushy eyebrows. He
  was clean-shaven with the high cheek-bones of the Slay. His nose was thick;
  his mouth both sensual and cruel. Not a very big man, yet he gave the
  impression of great physical strength. And there was a sort of feline grace
  in his walk as he followed the woman.</p>

  <p>"Menalin for a fiver," said Standish. "And seemingly interested in our
  unworthy selves. I don't know that I want him as a pet. What do you want,
  Johnny?"</p>

  <p>A small page with a newspaper on a salver had come up to the table.</p>

  <p>"<i>Vous avez commande ze</i> Daily Express, <i>m'sieu</i>?" said the
  boy.</p>

  <p>"I have not commanded it," answered Standish. "Nevertheless I should hate
  to disappoint you, laddie."</p>

  <p>He took the paper, and started fumbling in his pocket for a coin. And
  suddenly he stiffened; his eye had caught one of the headlines. He instantly
  recovered himself, tossed a coin on to the salver and put the paper on the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Show no interest, Hugh," he said quietly. "We are being watched. They've
  got the Chief."</p>

  <p>"My God!" muttered Drummond under his breath. "Let's see."</p>

  <p>Standish spread out the paper, and to all outward appearances two bored
  men bent forward to read it. And from a few tables away came a woman's low
  laugh...</p>

  <blockquote>
    MURDER OF ARMY OFFICER.<br>
    AMAZING CRIME IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. COLONEL HENRY TALBOT SHOT IN HYDE
    PARK.<br>
    <br>
    One of the most sensational crimes of modern times of a nature recalling
    the dastardly murder of the late Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, took place
    yesterday afternoon in Hyde Park.<br>
    <br>
    Colonel Henry Talbot, C.M.G., D.S.O., a highly-placed officer at the War
    Office, left Whitehall rather earlier than usual and started to walk home
    to his flat in Orme Square. This was his invariable custom if the weather
    was fine. His route was always the same; up Constitution Hill, into Hyde
    Park, and thence to Lancaster Gate.<br>
    <br>
    It would appear that the unfortunate officer paused on the outskirts of a
    crowd gathered round one of the inevitable orators near Marble Arch.
    Suddenly he was seen to fall to the ground. At first those near him thought
    he was ill, when, to their horror, they perceived blood flowing from his
    head.<br>
    <br>
    A constable was on the spot immediately, and it was obvious at once that
    the Colonel had been brutally murdered. He had been shot through the head
    from behind at point-blank range.<br>
    <br>
    That such a thing could happen in broad daylight, in such a place, is
    wellnigh inconceivable. No shot was heard, but this, of course, would be
    accounted for by the use of a silencer. None of the people in the vicinity
    had seen or heard anything suspicious, though one man&mdash;Mr. John
    Herbert, of Islington&mdash;said that he thought he had noticed two men
    getting hurriedly into a waiting taxi just after Colonel Talbot fell to the
    ground. But he had paid no attention and could give no description of
    them.<br>
    <br>
    What happened seems clear. The deceased officer, whose habit of walking
    home was evidently known to the murderer, must have been followed from his
    office. The man or men had a taxi in readiness behind them. When Colonel
    Talbot paused on the edge of the crowd they seized their opportunity to
    commit their atrocious crime, trusting to the shifting listeners to make a
    safe get-away. And this, unfortunately, they seem to have done.<br>
    <br>
    The crime is an inexplicable one. So far as is known Colonel Talbot had no
    enemies. His military record was a brilliant one. He served throughout the
    Egyptian campaign and the South African War, in the latter of which he was
    awarded the D.S.O. for conspicuous gallantry at Magersfontein. In the Great
    War he was twice wounded, receiving the C.M.G. and being five times
    mentioned in despatches.<br>
    <br>
    He leaves a widow and one son, Captain Edward Talbot, who is at present
    serving at Aldershot with his regiment, the Royal West Sussex.
  </blockquote>

  <p>And once again came the low mocking laugh of a woman...</p>

  <p>It failed conspicuously if, by it, she hoped to make them display any
  emotion; she was dealing with far too old hands for that. But inwardly both
  men were raging with anger. That she and the man with her were responsible
  for the paper being brought to them was a trifle; it was the filthy murder of
  one of the finest men in England, and a great friend into the bargain, that
  got them.</p>

  <p>Particularly Drummond. Similar though they were in many ways there was a
  streak of the primitive in him that Standish lacked. And though both of them
  had liked Jimmy Latimer, the murder of Colonel Talbot seemed more personal He
  was their Chief whom they were actually serving under at the time.</p>

  <p>One thing, however, it emphasised&mdash;the power of the organisation they
  were up against. Murder in the Park in broad daylight was not a matter to be
  undertaken lightly. It showed an almost incredible disregard for ordinary
  values. As Gasdon had said, England was not France; London was not Paris.</p>

  <p>"It would seem," said Drummond quietly, "that when we get back to England
  there will be several scores to settle."</p>

  <p>"When," remarked Standish with a short laugh. "We've been in many tight
  corners before, old boy, but we've never been in such danger as we are at the
  present moment seated in this bar. There is an efficient ruthlessness about
  our opponents that I find most refreshing. And it piles proof upon proof that
  the issue is big.</p>

  <p>"You're right there, by Jove!" Drummond's jaw was sticking out. "So much
  the better. For after this"&mdash;he tapped the paper&mdash;"it's war to the
  knife. No quarter given and none asked."</p>

  <p>"That'll be grand when we're in a position to give it," said Standish
  grimly. "Just at the moment I'm afraid the mouse has to be rather tight
  before he says it to the cat. Everything depends on whether we can do a
  get-away from here. And it's not going to be so easy as those swine found it
  at Marble Arch."</p>

  <p>The bar gradually filled, but of Gasdon there was no sign.
  Menalin&mdash;if it was Menalin&mdash;and the woman had gone shortly after
  the episode of the paper, but they neither of them felt any the easier for
  that. They were marked men, and they knew it. There was not the remotest
  chance of their leaving the hotel unnoticed.</p>

  <p>At last they saw Gasdon coming towards them, and he looked worried.</p>

  <p>"Madame P&eacute;lain is safe," he said as he sat down. "I am tolerably certain
  we were not followed. But she rang up Lidet while I was there. And the police
  have been round asking for you two, over last night's effort. At my
  instigation she said you were both returning to the Metropole for dinner, but
  that she did not know where you were at the moment. Now it is essential that
  you should not go back. There will be delays; possibly engineered
  delays..."</p>

  <p>"Not possibly, but certainly," said Standish. "Read that."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Gasdon as he put the paper down.</p>

  <p>"Worse still," continued Standish, and told him of the woman and her
  companion.</p>

  <p>"That's Menalin right enough," said Gasdon. "And he'll fix the police.
  You'll be kept there hanging about till there is a suitable opportunity to
  murder you."</p>

  <p>"The only chance," said Drummond, "is to walk calmly out of the hotel as
  if we were going back to Cannes&mdash;all three of us. We can talk as we go
  for the benefit of anyone in the hall. And it is just possible that if they
  think we are going to Cannes they will not bother to follow us."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it." Gasdon shook his head. "But it's the only thing to try. And
  at once. If that was Menalin, and from your description I'm sure it was, it
  is more than likely that he will put a call through to the police to say
  you're here. And if that happens you're done. Come on. We've got to make
  plans as we go."</p>

  <p>They rose and strolled into the hall, and a man studying some travel
  brochures drew slightly nearer.</p>

  <p>"Let's go back to the Metropole now and order the dinner," said Drummond.
  "Though personally I would sooner feed at the Reserve at Beaulieu."</p>

  <p>"Too far afterwards, old boy," objected Gasdon. "It's only a step to the
  Casino from the Metropole."</p>

  <p>"All right, have it your own way," said Drummond languidly. "<i>En
  voiture</i>."</p>

  <p>They sauntered outside, three care-free Englishmen, and got into the car.
  And the brochure studier sauntered also, at the same time giving the faintest
  perceptible nod to two men in a low-bodied, powerful racing car whose bonnet
  was almost touching the tail of Drummond's car.</p>

  <p>"Actual performers are poor," drawled Drummond.</p>

  <p>"That nod was quite unnecessary and settles things. We have equerries in
  attendance."</p>

  <p>He was fumbling in the cubby-hole in front of him as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Stupid of me, Ronald," he cried. "I never put a lashing on that luggage
  grid. Do you remember how it rattled like hell?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly could hear yourself speak, old boy," agreed Standish, lighting a
  cigarette, and watching Drummond out of the corner of his eye as he got out
  of the car.</p>

  <p>The brochure studier had disappeared; the light was failing, and Gasdon
  was fidgeting.</p>

  <p>"What the devil does it matter about the luggage grid?" he muttered.
  "Every second is precious."</p>

  <p>"My dear Gasdon," said Standish quietly, "you can take it from me that
  there is generally a reason for everything that Drummond does. In due course
  you will find that out for yourself&mdash;perhaps sooner than you think.
  There was no squeak in the luggage grid."</p>

  <p>Gasdon's lips twitched into a grin.</p>

  <p>"I'm beginning to like you two blokes," he remarked. "You're going to wake
  me up. I was getting fat and lazy."</p>

  <p>"Lucky they were so close to us," said Drummond, getting back into the
  car. "And now, my loved ones, hey&mdash;nonnie&mdash;no, for the great open
  spaces."</p>

  <p>"What on earth have you been doing?" asked Gasdon curiously as Drummond
  let in the clutch.</p>

  <p>"Adjusting my maiden's helps," answered Drummond. "Never known to fail.
  Entirely my own invention. If the little pretty wants to escape with boy
  friend from parents in attendant car so that she may daily awhile in leafy
  glades, she puts one of these under the front wheel of said parents' car
  after lunch. The most infallible puncture producer of this or any other age.
  I am never without 'em."</p>

  <p>Gasdon was shaking helplessly as he looked at the maiden's help. It
  consisted of a very sharp three-inch nail which, instead of possessing the
  usual head, was fitted with a small triangular stand so that the nail would
  stand upright in the road.</p>

  <p>"Placed so that the point of the nail just touches the tyre," explained
  Drummond, "and it's through Pop's reinforced Dunlop before the old boy has
  begun to digest the salmon mayonnaise. What's happened to our escort?"</p>

  <p>"They're about a hundred yards behind us," said Standish.
  "Yes...yes...O.K., boy. They're pulling up. They're out. By Jove! they've got
  two punctures. Both front wheels..."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," remarked Drummond calmly. "And they have only one spare. It
  would, I feel, be vulgar to wave. Now what's the plan; to Cannes or not to
  Cannes?"</p>

  <p>"I think not," said Gasdon, grown serious again. "We could, of course, go
  by the Rue d'Antibes, miss the hotel, and head for Brignoles. But if they do
  warn the police to stop the car that route will be watched for an absolute
  certainty. And we've got to run the gauntlet of every gendarme between here
  and Cannes. Our best hope is Grasse. Swing right-handed when we get to Cagnes
  golf course."</p>

  <p>"Your slightest word is law, dear boy," said Drummond. "You know this
  country a deuced sight better than we do, so we are in your hands. The car, I
  am glad to say, is fast."</p>

  <p>"Very fast," agreed Gasdon. "The trouble is that there is something which
  is a damned sight faster&mdash;the telephone. Drummond, we've got to abandon
  car mighty soon, I'm afraid. I know of a by-road by which we can skirt round
  Grasse, but after that the trouble begins. We get up into the mountains, and
  roads are few and far between."</p>

  <p>"What do you suggest?" asked Drummond. "As I said, you know the
  geography."</p>

  <p>"We've got to concentrate, chaps, on getting out of France. Now let us
  assume the worst. When it is discovered that we have bolted, the first thing
  the police will do is to issue a general warning to look out for the car.
  Therefore, as we have already agreed, the car must be abandoned, though
  possibly it might be safe to drive through to-night."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," said Standish, "but go on."</p>

  <p>"What is the next thing the police will do? They know our names, and when
  no information of the car comes to hand, they will assume we have taken to
  the railway. Which is what, incidentally, I suggest we should do at the
  earliest possible moment. And here comes the vital difference between our
  cases. Whatever Menalin and Co. may think of me, the police don't want me.
  You two are all that count in their young lives. And so I propose that we
  separate. I'll go to Paris and cross to England in the ordinary way, but what
  are you going to do? Let's work it out. Every railway frontier will be
  watched for you two by name. It is just possible, and it seems to me to be
  your only hope, that the road frontiers will be watched for by car."</p>

  <p>"My God!" cried Drummond, "you don't suggest we should walk across France,
  do you?"</p>

  <p>Gasdon laughed.</p>

  <p>"Not quite. I suggest that we should all make for the Grenoble line. That
  I should go to Paris, and that you should make for Geneva. Go to
  Aix-les-Bains. There hire a car and drive to Evian on the Lake Geneva, where
  you can pick up one of the steamers. And once you've done that you're in the
  straight run home."</p>

  <p>"It sounds feasible," said Standish. "The only drawback to my mind is that
  if we are caught, such a very elaborate scheme makes us look infernally
  guilty."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to chance that," answered Gasdon. "Don't forget you can
  always tell the police the real reason for what you've done."</p>

  <p>"That's so. Just now, however, the pressing need is the immediate future.
  It is almost dark, and, I take it, that's Grasse in front of us."</p>

  <p>"Go slow," said Gasdon. "Here is the turning to the left. It's a bad road,
  but we can skirt the town and come out beyond it on the Digne road. Then
  we're safe as far as Castellane."</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord you know the old terrain," laughed Drummond. "What a fun,
  boys, what a fun! But could little Hugh do with a pint? The answer, jolly old
  speaker, is in the affirmative."</p>

  <p>"It is definitely a sound idea, Gasdon," said Standish after they had
  driven in silence for some time. "If we can make Switzerland, we're on
  velvet. Through Germany to either the Hook or Ostend."</p>

  <p>"Just so," said Gasdon. "And before we separate we'll agree where we meet
  in England."</p>

  <p>"Sure bill," cried Standish. "But since you will certainly be there first,
  get in touch at once with Lawson&mdash;Major Lawson&mdash;at the War House,
  and tell him the whole story."</p>

  <p>Once more silence fell. By now it was quite dark, and the road was rising
  rapidly, though the car made light of the gradient. Mile after mile fell away
  behind them, and soon the lights of Castellane appeared ahead. And it was
  then that Drummond had a brain-storm.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong with you taking the car on, Gasdon?" he exclaimed. "As you
  said, the police don't want <i>you</i>. Standish and I will get out now and
  walk to the town. It goes to my heart to leave her in some wretched little
  garage here. If the police should stop you, you are merely driving the car to
  Paris at my request, and we are still, as far as you know, on the
  Riviera."</p>

  <p>He stopped the car and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"If the police don't stop you, you might even take her on to Boulogne," he
  continued. "But if you think that's unwise park her in some good garage in
  Paris."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure you're not right," said Gasdon. "It might help to throw 'em
  still off the scent. What do you think, Standish?"</p>

  <p>"I think it's a good idea. Where's our nearest station?"</p>

  <p>"Hire a car and make for Sisteron. It's about sixty miles. And now about
  England. Where do we meet?"</p>

  <p>"Keep in touch with Lawson. We'll get at you through him."</p>

  <p>"Right. Well, so long, chaps. And good luck."</p>

  <p>"Little did I think, old boy," said Drummond resignedly as the lights of
  the car vanished round a bend, "that I should ever be marooned amongst the
  virgin snows in the middle of the night. Come on, I could do with a spot of
  solids."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes' walk brought them to the bridge over the river Verdon, that
  marks the entrance to the town; another five and they were in the main
  square. And there with a gendarme on each side, stood the car.</p>

  <p>Matters had evidently reached a deadlock. One gendarme was scratching his
  head, the other was sucking a pencil. And Gasdon, a picture of outraged
  innocence, was haranguing them from the driver's seat in fluent French.</p>

  <p>"It is monstrous," he cried. "It is of an imbecility incredible. Is it the
  car that is required for these formalities at Cannes? The owner, my great
  friend, knowing he must await the police investigation, lends me his car to
  go to Paris. Is not that sufficient proof, you fatheads, that he is still
  there? If he had wished to go himself, would he not have been in the car? And
  in any case, why should he go? He was not accused of anything. It is merely a
  question of his evidence."</p>

  <p>"Our instructions are that there are three men in the car." The pencil
  sucker had produced his notebook. "Le Capitaine Drummond; M'sieur Standish
  and M'sieur Gasdon. And the M'sieur Gasdon has a scar on his face."</p>

  <p>"Name of a name," cried Gasdon. "Regard the scar. Obtained, <i>mon
  brave,</i> at Fricourt. I am Monsieur Gasdon, and when I left Nice le
  Capitaine Drummond and Monsieur Standish were with me in the car. But I
  dropped them near Cagnes."</p>

  <p>"At what house, m'sieur?" demanded the gendarme.</p>

  <p>"The house of a lady friend." Gasdon dug the pencil sucker in the ribs,
  and they all laughed. "And now since you are both satisfied that neither of
  them are in the car, I must get on."</p>

  <p>He let in the clutch and drove off, and after a while the two gendarmes
  went indoors. Assuredly very peculiar; if three men were reported to be in
  the car, it was obviously most irregular that there should only be one. And,
  as they disappeared the two onlookers did likewise in the opposite
  direction.</p>

  <p>"They lose no time," said Standish gravely. "And I have my doubts if
  Gasdon gets through."</p>

  <p>"Which makes it the more imperative that we should," answered Drummond.
  "There's a garage on the other side of the road. Let's see if we can raise a
  car."</p>

  <p>They could&mdash;an incredibly ancient Renault. And three hours later they
  bumped into Sisteron. The first part of their journey was over.</p>

  <p>"And now, old boy," said Drummond as they paid off the car, "we separate.
  It gives us two chances instead of one. Make for the Hotel les Bergues at
  Geneva."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">VI. &mdash; DRUMMOND ALONE</a></h2>

  <p>During the season Evian-les-Bains is a charming spot. On the high ground
  behind the town there are tennis courts and golf links set in delightful
  surroundings, for those who will to use. A tiny harbour filled with gaily
  coloured boats abuts the casino; beautiful women and brave men lounge
  gracefully over their "five o'clock." That is during the season.</p>

  <p>Out of the season Evian-les-Bains resembles a town of the dead. The links
  are shut; holland covers encase the casino furniture. The beautiful women
  have departed long since; the inhabitants appear to have fallen into a coma.
  And it was out of the season when Drummond, paying off his taxi on the
  outskirts of the town, proceeded to enter it on foot.</p>

  <p>The time was midday, and the boat, so he had discovered from the concierge
  at Aix, arrived at two-thirty. Which left him two and a half hours to put
  through, and made him regret that he had left his hotel quite so early. Not
  that he hankered after Evian in gala mood, but because, if the police were on
  the look-out, he was so much more conspicuous in the deserted streets.</p>

  <p>Strolling towards the harbour he espied a sports shop, in the window of
  which some rucksacks were hanging. And it struck him that it might help to
  account for his presence if he pretended to be on a walking tour. So he
  purchased one, and a long stick with an embossed handle. A hunting horn he
  refused; likewise a little green hat with feathers in it. To overdo a part is
  bad art...</p>

  <p>Leaving the shop he walked on towards the lake. And then, finding a small
  caf&eacute; within sight of the landing-stage, he entered and enquired about lunch.
  It seemed that an omelette and a bottle of wine was all that Madame could run
  to, so he ordered it and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>Since the morning before he had practically not seen Standish. They had
  travelled in the same train from Sisteron to Aix, but in different
  compartments, whilst at Aix they had stayed at different hotels. And now
  Drummond began wondering where he was. The two-thirty was the only boat he
  could catch, since the service was greatly curtailed as soon as the summer
  tourist season ceased.</p>

  <p>Slowly the time went by, until suddenly Madame pointed over the lake.</p>

  <p><i>"Voil&agrave;, m'sieu; le bateau."</i></p>

  <p>The paddle boat had just heaved in sight coming from St. Gingolph, and he
  frowned a little. Standish was cutting it fine. Faint human stirrings in the
  square outside began to manifest themselves; evidently this was the event of
  the day. He could hear the thresh of the paddles now, so, paying his bill, he
  rose to go. And at that moment a car drove up with Standish inside.</p>

  <p>From the doorway Drummond watched. The engines of the boat were in
  reverse; cables fore and aft were being flung ashore. And then he saw them.
  Advancing majestically towards the shore end of the gangway were two
  gendarmes in gorgeous uniforms. Moreover it appeared that they wished to see
  Standish's passport.</p>

  <p>Drummond's eyes narrowed; rapid thought was necessary. They were stopping
  Standish in spite of his indignant protestations. And if they stopped
  Standish they would also stop him. Madame was adjuring him to hurry if he
  wished to catch the boat, but he only smiled at her and came back into the
  caf&eacute;. It would not do to arouse her suspicions in any way, so he told her
  that he had decided to continue walking, and ordered another bottle of wine.
  From outside came again the sound of paddle wheels; the boat was leaving. And
  in a few minutes peace once more reigned in Evian.</p>

  <p>Convinced by now that the large Englishman was more than usually mad,
  Madame had retired into some inner fastness, leaving Drummond alone in the
  caf&eacute;. What was the best thing to do? Any attempt to rescue Standish or even
  to communicate with him would be madness. The police were merely doing their
  duty, and the only result would be that he would be stopped as well.</p>

  <p>Equally would it be madness to wait on with the idea of catching the boat
  on the following day; the police would still be on the look-out. In fact any
  idea of leaving France by Evian must be abandoned. Where, then, could he
  go?</p>

  <p>A map was hanging on the wall, and he rose and studied it. There, just
  across the water&mdash;so near and yet so far&mdash;lay Lausanne and safety.
  Should he wait for darkness, steal one of the boats in the harbour, and row
  across the lake? But after a few moments' reflection he dismissed the idea as
  too dangerous. The police headquarters were too close; the risk of being seen
  or heard too great. So the only alternative was to cross the frontier by
  land.</p>

  <p>To the east lay St. Gingolph only about twelve miles away. But to reach
  that he had to cross the square in front of the police station, and moreover
  do so fairly soon. For it had dawned on him that this caf&eacute; was not too safe.
  The gendarmes, exhausted by their labours, might decide to recuperate their
  strength with alcohol at any moment, and the caf&eacute; was very handy.</p>

  <p>So there was only one course open. He would strike westward towards Geneva
  and cross at Hermance. That they would be on the look-out for him there, was
  obvious, but the same thing applied to every <i>douane.</i> So the only thing
  was to hope for the best when he got there.</p>

  <p>He slipped into the street, and heaved a sigh of relief when he was out of
  sight of the police station. He had twenty-five miles to cover, and the
  prospect of walking did not amuse him. On the other hand if he hired a car
  and arrived in broad daylight, the attempt was foredoomed to failure.</p>

  <p>He strode along thinking things over, and wishing that he knew the country
  he would have to negotiate when he came to the frontier. For it had soon
  occurred to him that by far the best, if not the only, chance of getting
  through would be to cross between <i>douanes.</i> That would entail leaving
  the road before he got to the frontier: skirting round the village and
  rejoining the road again farther on when he was safe in Switzerland. What
  difficulties there would be he had no idea: as a performance it was a new one
  on him. But he assumed that in peace time any system of patrols between posts
  would be of a very perfunctory nature.</p>

  <p>And so, when it came to the point, it proved to be. Save for falling into
  a wet ditch the whole thing passed off without incident. As soon as the
  lights of the <i>douane</i> showed up in the distance he struck off
  left-handed across the fields. Once a dog began barking furiously, but,
  except for that, the night was still. Hardly a light was showing; the whole
  countryside was asleep. And at 11.41 p.m. Drummond stepped back on to the
  road with France a kilometre behind him. In the distance glittered the lights
  of Geneva; a far more welcome sight, however, was a faint chink filtering
  through the wooden shutters of an inn just ahead. A room was available, and
  ten minutes later Drummond, having taken off his shoes and coat, was fast
  asleep.</p>

  <p>It was past ten when he awoke next morning and the sun was streaming in
  through the window. So at peace with the world, and no longer feeling that at
  any moment he might feel a gendarme's hand on his shoulder, he drank two
  large cups of coffee. Then, having hired a taxi, he drove into Geneva over
  the Pont de Mont Blanc.</p>

  <p>It was his first visit to the Hotel les Bergues and the concierge eyed him
  a little doubtfully. With a certain amount of excuse let it be admitted; Hugh
  Drummond's general appearance was not such as is generally to be observed in
  that hotel. He wanted a shave, and his shoes still bore record to yesterday's
  walk. But at that moment an exquisite individual came sauntering down the
  stairs, who paused, stared, then with a cry of amazement held out his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"What in the name of all that's fortunate are you doing here, old boy? And
  why this strange garb with rucksacks and things?"</p>

  <p>"Hullo! potato face," said Drummond. "Glad to see you. I didn't know any
  of you blokes ever got up before midday."</p>

  <p>The Honourable James Tagley grinned amiably. A younger son of old Lord
  Storrington, he had drifted peacefully into the Foreign Office, where he
  remained a monument of beauty and a joy for ever.</p>

  <p>"We do every second Friday," he remarked. "But joking apart, Hugh, what
  does bring you here?"</p>

  <p>"A desire to study Swiss architecture first-hand," said Drummond with a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Are you up to some of your games?" demanded the Honourable James.</p>

  <p>"My dear potato face, I don't understand you. I am now a respectable
  member of society."</p>

  <p>"You're a damned old liar," said the other. "I say, what a shocking thing
  that was&mdash;those swines murdering Talbot."</p>

  <p>"You're right," agreed Drummond. "Any inside information come through to
  this centre of gossip?"</p>

  <p>"No. But the motive must have been political."</p>

  <p>Drummond raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have said that he was much mixed up in politics. However,
  doubtless you know best, James. Tell me; how stands the international
  barometer?"</p>

  <p>The other lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"Officially, old boy, set fair. Unofficially&mdash;not quite so good.
  There are vague mutterings and signs and portents."</p>

  <p>"Are you allowed to tell?"</p>

  <p>"The devil of it is that there's nothing to tell. Nothing definite, that's
  to say. But in some ways, you know, this place is as sensitive as the Stock
  Exchange. Whispers go round in the most incredible fashion, and when you've
  been here some time it's amazing how quickly you become aware of them.
  There's something in the air, Hugh; there has been for some time."</p>

  <p>"What sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know; I can't tell you."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean there's a possibility of war?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, that possibility is always there&mdash;League of Nations,
  or no League of Nations. But I don't mean war this time. It's something else,
  and"&mdash;his voice sank to a whisper&mdash;"we are involved."</p>

  <p>Drummond lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"You interest me profoundly, James," he remarked. "Mind you, Hugh," said
  Tagley, "this is not to go beyond you. Good morning, sir."</p>

  <p>A well-known figure in English public life nodded as he passed through the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"Do you want a lift?" he called out.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir. I must go, Hugh. Shall I see you at lunch?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, potato face. I don't know."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two Drummond stood motionless as Tagley hurried after the
  great man to a waiting car. Then he turned to the concierge.</p>

  <p>"I want a call to London," he said. "How long will it take?"</p>

  <p>"It depends, sir. But if you will give me the number I will get through
  for you. It would be well to remain at hand. Sometimes one connects almost at
  once."</p>

  <p>Taking a pencil Drummond wrote down Ginger Lawson's number at the War
  Office. Then he sat down on a chair near-by. So James Tagley confirmed the
  fact that something was in the wind...Strange&mdash;very strange...</p>

  <p>"God!" he muttered to himself. "If only Latimer had put those papers in an
  envelope and posted them in Paris!"</p>

  <p>For perhaps ten minutes he sat there, idly watching the people as they
  passed in and out of the hotel. Every nationality; every colour...Every
  nationality, that is to say, except three...What a farce; what a roaring
  farce.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he saw the concierge approaching him. "M'sieur's call to
  London."</p>

  <p>He entered the box and picked up the receiver. "Hullo! Ginger: that
  you?"</p>

  <p>With remarkable clearness he heard Lawson's voice from the other end.</p>

  <p>"Drummond speaking from Geneva."</p>

  <p>"Geneva! What on earth are you doing there?</p>

  <p>"Too long to tell you now, Ginger. I'm writing you a full report this
  morning, but it will be two or three days before I'm back. For reasons I
  can't go into at the moment I'm not going through France. I shall either fly
  from Brussels or cross via Ostend or the Hook."</p>

  <p>"Postpone it for a day or two, old boy," came Lawson's voice. "It's
  providential you're in Switzerland. Do you know young Cranmer&mdash;Archie
  Cranmer?"</p>

  <p>"Vaguely. He's with you, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"That's right. But he's new on the game. At the moment he is in Territet
  at the Grand Hotel. Will you go over and get in touch with him? I'll wire him
  to expect you."</p>

  <p>"All right, Ginger. It's urgent, is it? Because I want to get back to
  England as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>"It is urgent, Hugh. It concerns the Chief's murder. And I'd feel easier
  if you were helping Archie."</p>

  <p>"'Nough said, Ginger. I'll get off my report to you, and then go straight
  to Territet. By the way you have Ronald's from Cannes, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I recognised the writing and opened it. We are keeping an eye on the
  gentleman he mentions from here. Is Ronald with you?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'll explain everything in my report. So long, Ginger."</p>

  <p>He rang off, and having paid for the call he wandered upstairs in search
  of the writing-room. It was the part of the job that he disliked most, but he
  dared not bank on the fact that Standish would get another report off from
  France. And so for an hour he toiled laboriously; then with a sigh of relief
  he addressed the envelope and slipped it in his pocket. A shave; a drink;
  Territet&mdash;that was the programme as he proposed it. And that was the
  programme as he carried it out.</p>

  <p>He arrived at Territet at three o'clock, having lunched at Lausanne
  Station, and went straight to the Grand Hotel. And the first person he saw
  sitting in the glassed-in verandah was Archie Cranmer.</p>

  <p>"How are you, young feller!" he said. "I don't know if you remember me. My
  name is Drummond."</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," answered Cranmer getting up. "But it almost seemed as if
  you expected to find me here."</p>

  <p>"I did," laughed Drummond. "I've come over from Geneva especially to see
  you at Ginger Lawson's request. Have you had a wire from him?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"It'll come. And in the meantime let's hear all about it."</p>

  <p>Cranmer shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry, Drummond. I'm sure it's all right, but..."</p>

  <p>And once again he shook his head deliberately.</p>

  <p>"Good for you," said Drummond with a grin. "I was only trying you out. In
  our game, Cranmer, a man ought not to trust his own mother. However, I don't
  think we'll have long to wait. This page boy has the appearance of one who
  bringeth news. A telegram, my lad? There's the gentleman."</p>

  <p>Cranmer opened it; then with a smile passed it over to Drummond.</p>

  <p class="telegram">"WORK WITH HUGH DRUMMOND.&mdash;LAWSON."</p>

  <p>"So that's that," he said. "Sorry if I seemed suspicious, but your
  appearance was rather unexpected. How much do you know already?"</p>

  <p>"Merely that you are here in connection with the Chief's murder," answered
  Drummond.</p>

  <p>"I see. Then I'd better begin at the beginning. You remember, don't you,
  that he always used to walk to and from the office?"</p>

  <p>Drummond nodded.</p>

  <p>"On the morning of his murder it so happened that for some reason or other
  he did not walk, but took a taxi. Incidentally both Lawson and I are
  convinced that if he had walked they'd have got him then. However, that is
  beside the point. The instant he reached the office he sent for both of
  us."</p>

  <p>"'I had a visitor last night,' he began. At my fiat. A peculiar card.'</p>

  <p>"You remember that funny sort of clipped way he had of talking.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' he went on, 'a very peculiar card. At first I thought he wasn't
  all there. Mallows showed him into the study, and he kept looking round as if
  he expected a trap. Little, short, dark man with a Whacking great moustache.
  Obviously not English though he spoke it quite well.</p>

  <p>"'It transpired that he kept a barber's shop down Elephant and Castle way,
  which he ran under the name of Timpson. Further, that he was naturalised.</p>

  <p>"'I always believe,' continued the Chief, in letting a man tell his story
  in his own way, but after a bit I got a trifle bored.</p>

  <p>"'"Get down to it, Mr. Timpson," I said. "I assume you haven't come here
  merely to tell me you cut hair."</p>

  <p>"'He leaned forward impressively.</p>

  <p>"'"Colonel," he said, "I have very valuable information for you."</p>

  <p>"'"Good," I answered. "Fire ahead."</p>

  <p>"'Then one got his real character in his cunning, greedy eyes.</p>

  <p>"'How much is it worth?'</p>

  <p>"'That,' I said, 'depends entirely on what it is. If it really is valuable
  you won't have any cause for complaint.'</p>

  <p>"'Very good. I will trust you. Now you will understand, sir, that many
  foreigners come to my shop, as well as English. And frequently I overhear
  their conversations. This afternoon there came two. They were speaking
  French, but it was not the French of Frenchmen. And as I listened to what
  they said I realised what they were. They were Swiss. After a while they were
  joined by two Englishmen, and they all talked together in low tones. Much of
  what they said I could not hear, but one or two things I did catch.'</p>

  <p>"The little man's voice sank to a blood-curdling whisper.</p>

  <p>"'And one of them was your name often repeated.'"</p>

  <p>"Apparently," continued Cranmer, the Chief sat up at this. Why four
  scallywags should be discussing him in a cheap barber's shop was not easy to
  follow. He pressed this man Timpson as to how he knew it was him, since
  Talbot was not a particularly uncommon name. Answer was that Orme Square had
  been mentioned, which seemed fairly conclusive, and the Chief waited for
  more. He soon got it. The two Englishmen were known to Timpson as thoroughly
  dangerous characters, though he knew nothing about the Swiss. And it,
  therefore, seemed obvious that the conversation was not likely to have
  concerned a presentation of plate to the Chief.</p>

  <p>"'Not that that worries me in the slightest,' he went on. 'In the ordinary
  course of events I should take no notice at all. But coming so soon after
  Jimmy's death I have notified the Yard, and I expect to hear from them at any
  moment. Why I've sent for you two fellows concerns the one other item of
  interest that Mr. Timpson gave me. It's an address which he heard the Swiss
  mention two or three times: Villa Bon Ciel, Veytaux.'</p>

  <p>"'Where's Veytaux?' asked Ginger.</p>

  <p>"'Just what I wanted to know myself,' said the Chief. 'It's apparently a
  sort of continuation of Montreaux and Territet going towards Chinon Castle.
  And that's where you two boys are bound for. A nice holiday in beautiful
  Switzerland.'</p>

  <p>"'At that moment the telephone rang, and the Chief answered it. And when
  he put down the receiver his face was grave.</p>

  <p>"'Mr. Timpson has not yet returned to his shop,' he said. 'His bed has not
  been slept in. I very much fear that he has more than earned the fiver I gave
  him.'"</p>

  <p>"'You think they've got him?' said Ginger.</p>

  <p>"'My flat was probably being watched?' he said. 'Of course he may have
  gone on the binge and is sleeping it off, but...'</p>

  <p>"The shrug of his shoulders was eloquent; it was obvious what he thought.
  And then for a time he sat there drumming on the desk with his fingers.</p>

  <p>"'I don't like it,' he said at length. There's something going on I can't
  understand. Anyway you two had better keep your eyes skinned before, during,
  and after your visit to Veytaux.'</p>

  <p>"With that he dismissed us, and it was the last time I saw him alive.
  Those swine got him, as you know, when he was walking home that
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"What of this man Timpson?" asked Drummond after a pause.</p>

  <p>"There was no trace of him up to the time I left. You see, the Chief's
  death altered things. Ginger had to stop on in London, so I came over here
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Drummond absently. "Quite. When did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"Early this morning by the Orient express."</p>

  <p>"Have you done anything as yet?"</p>

  <p>"I took a walk towards Chinon Castle, and located the villa."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Drummond. "What sort of a place is it?"</p>

  <p>"An ordinary sort of shanty standing way back up the hill, overlooking the
  lake. It's got a glassed in verandah much like this one, only very much
  smaller, of course."</p>

  <p>"Any other houses near it?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, I should say, within a hundred yards."</p>

  <p>"How close did you get to it?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't. I saw it from the main road down below. That's this one that
  goes past the hotel."</p>

  <p>"And what were you proposing to do next?"</p>

  <p>"To tell the truth, Drummond," said Cranmer with an apologetic laugh. "I
  wasn't quite sure <i>what</i> to do next."</p>

  <p>"I don't wonder. The problem is not a very easy one."</p>

  <p>"I thought I might make enquiries of the concierge as to who lives
  there."</p>

  <p>Drummond shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not that. In a place of this sort things get round in an
  incredibly short time. And if it came out that two Englishmen were
  interesting themselves in the owner of the Bon Ciel the pitch is queered at
  once. No, my boy; nothing so direct as that. You didn't get near enough to
  find out if the owner kept a dog."</p>

  <p>Cranmer shook his head.</p>

  <p>"In any event it would probably have been inside the house," he said.</p>

  <p>"Not of necessity," said Drummond. "A lot of these people here keep a dog
  on a long chain, simply as a watchdog. Then they don't have to pay a licence.
  However, we can but find out. Got any rubber-soled shoes?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Nor have I. Now look here, Cranmer, we'll split this job to start with. I
  will go down the town and buy two pairs of rubber shoes&mdash;your size looks
  about the same as mine. You will get hold of a telephone book, remembering
  that under no circumstances must you let the concierge know why you want it.
  You will then go laboriously down the list on the chance of finding that the
  villa is on the 'phone. If it is we shall get the name of the owner, though
  not of necessity the present tenant. It may help; it may not. Then when I
  return we will both take a walk past the villa to ensure that we can find it
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"And to-night?"</p>

  <p>"We will take another walk," said Drummond with a grin. "And then we will
  be guided by circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" cried the other, "you don't intend to break in, do you?"</p>

  <p>Drummond's grin grew more pronounced.</p>

  <p>"Let us call it a tour of investigation," he remarked. "Get busy with the
  telephone book."</p>

  <p>He left Cranmer settling down to his monotonous task, and walking down to
  the station stood waiting for a tram. On the opposite side of the lake rose
  the mountains of Haute Savoie culminating in the giant Dent du Midi, golden
  crested in the westering sun. A thin wisp of fog lay like a serpent against
  the dark massif, and in the distance the same steamer that Standish had
  missed the day before was pursuing its lawful occasions.</p>

  <p>A tram came grinding to a standstill and he boarded it. Facing him, two
  very English old ladies were discussing church affairs with interest; he
  gathered that all was not going as it should do with regard to the
  approaching sale of work. And just for a second a faint smile twitched round
  his lips. They were so <i>very</i> earnest about it, and the ever-amazing
  contrasts that go to form this thing called life tickled his sense of
  humour.</p>

  <p>He found a shoe shop without difficulty, and made his purchases. Then,
  strolling through the empty market-place, he started to walk back to the
  hotel along the lake front. Gulls, shrieking discordantly, rose from the
  railings as he approached, only to resume their perches when he had gone by.
  And at one corner a man of unbelievable antiquity, who was fishing with the
  longest rod Drummond had ever seen, had just landed a fish nearly two inches
  long.</p>

  <p>He arrived back in the hotel, and told the concierge to have the parcel
  sent up to his room. Then he went through to the bar to find Cranmer who held
  up his thumbs as soon as he saw him.</p>

  <p>"Luck's in up to a point," he said. "The house belongs to a man called
  Maier, but since Maier is about as common here as Smith is in England it
  doesn't seem to help us much."</p>

  <p>"Still, it's something," answered Drummond. "Your shoes are in my
  room."</p>

  <p>"I'll get 'em after dinner," said Cranmer. "Shall we do a spot of scouting
  now?"</p>

  <p>Drummond nodded, and Cranmer rose.</p>

  <p>"We go out by the other door," he went on. "My hat's in the hall."</p>

  <p>In silence the two men strode along the main street until they came to a
  road branching off left-handed and leading up into the hills. Below them,
  about half a mile away, sombre and grim, Chillon Castle jutted out into the
  lake, whilst above it, far off in the distance, the peaks of the Dent du Midi
  had turned to purple.</p>

  <p>There was a nip in the air, and they walked briskly. At first the houses
  were continuous, small ones of the working-man type. But shortly they ceased,
  and scattered villas took their place&mdash;villas which were approached by
  drives of varying length.</p>

  <p>"There it is," said Cranmer. "The next one on the right."</p>

  <p>"Good," cried Drummond. "Don't pause; we'll walk straight past."</p>

  <p>It stood about thirty yards back from the road and below it. Though
  obviously inhabited there was no sign of any inmates. Nor was there any
  indication of a dog. An upstair window was open, and the curtains were
  stirring in the faint breeze. And as they passed a light was suddenly
  switched on in the room, and a man leant out. His back was to the light, so
  that all they could see was the silhouette of a broad-shouldered figure. Then
  he disappeared.</p>

  <p>They walked on another hundred yards when Drummond stopped.</p>

  <p>"About turn," he said. "There's nothing more to be found out now. Let's go
  back to the pub. Two things, old boy, which may help us. There's undergrowth
  on each side of the drive, and from the road one can see into the upstair
  window. Let us hope that the night may bring us luck."</p>

  <p>"Probably bring us jug," laughed Cranmer "However, the Swiss are a humane
  race. I don't suppose they torture their prisoners."</p>

  <p>The bar had filled up when they returned, and having ordered two drinks
  they stood by it. In an adjoining room four people were playing bridge, and
  in one corner of the bar itself a large cosmopolitan party was drinking
  cocktails. They were talking French, but some were obviously Germans, and the
  remainder Americans.</p>

  <p>"You see the very tall gentleman facing you, sir," said the barman in an
  undertone to Drummond. "That is your consul here&mdash;M'sieur L&eacute;nod."</p>

  <p>"The devil it is," murmured Drummond. "He is a Swiss?"</p>

  <p><i>"Mais oui, m'sieu.</i> But he has spent much of his time in England. He
  speaks it perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Drummond and turned to Cranmer. "I wonder if he could
  help us over Maier," he went on in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"No harm in trying," answered the other. "By Jove! he's coming over
  here."</p>

  <p>It was true; Monsieur L&eacute;nod was crossing to the bar to give an order.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, m'sieur," said Drummond when he had finished his instructions,
  "but I understand you are the British consul here."</p>

  <p>"That is so," returned the tall man.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I could have a few minutes' conversation with you this
  evening?"</p>

  <p>"If you wish to see me on business," said Monsieur L&eacute;nod, "you will find
  me at my office to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid to-morrow morning will be too late," said Drummond. "I should
  esteem it a very great favour if you could waive professional etiquette on
  this occasion. I can assure you that it is very important."</p>

  <p>"Under those circumstances, gentlemen, I will join you as soon as I can
  get away from my party."</p>

  <p>With a courteous bow he moved back to his table, and Drummond turned to
  Cranmer.</p>

  <p>"It may come to nothing," he said, "but as you say, it's worth trying.
  There's a vacant table over there. Let's go and sit down."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later the consul joined them.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen," he remarked. "What can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"In the first place," said Drummond, "we had better introduce ourselves.
  My name is Drummond, Captain Drummond, and this is Cranmer We are over here,
  M'sieur L&eacute;nod, in connection with the murder of Colonel Talbot in Hyde Park,
  which you have doubtless read about in the papers."</p>

  <p>The consul raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Police?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"No, not police. Shall we say&mdash;Secret Service!"</p>

  <p>Drummond paused for a moment and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"It has come to our knowledge," he continued, "that there is a certain
  villa in Veytaux which is in some way connected with the crime. In what way
  we don't know, but this villa was mentioned by men who are believed to be
  implicated in the murder."</p>

  <p>"And the name of it?" asked the consul.</p>

  <p>"The Bon Ciel."</p>

  <p>The consul nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Carl Maier," he said. "Well, gentlemen, I am not altogether
  surprised. Why he should be concerned in the murder of Colonel Talbot is
  completely beyond me, but if anybody here <i>is</i> concerned in it he would
  be the man I should pick on."</p>

  <p>"So you know something about Maier," remarked Drummond quietly.</p>

  <p>"Quite a lot. To begin with&mdash;though this is hardly relevant to the
  present matter&mdash;his villa was one of the centres of espionage during the
  war. As you can imagine all this shore of the lake was a happy hunting-ground
  for spies, who could enter the country from Germany, and find France just
  across the water. And though we could never prove it and, in fact, could do
  nothing even if we did prove it, Maier's villa was one of their principal
  rendezvous."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a man is he?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"He is a German Swiss, born not far from Basle. His age is about sixty. By
  profession he is a clock-maker, though he has long given up actual work. He
  is, however, extremely clever with his fingers, at any form of mechanical
  contrivance. It is his hobby&mdash;messing about with springs and cogged
  wheels. So much for one aspect of the man."</p>

  <p>The consul paused as if to weigh his words, and the others did not
  interrupt him.</p>

  <p>"Now for another and possibly more important one," continued Monsieur
  L&eacute;nod. "In his early days he was a red hot revolutionary&mdash;practically an
  anarchist. I gather that he has mellowed somewhat with advancing years, but
  up till long after the war he was a fanatical extremist. Incidentally,
  Captain Drummond, the actual chair in which you are sitting is the one in
  which Lenin sat&mdash;night after night&mdash;before he went to Russia, and I
  have often seen Maier in here talking to him."</p>

  <p>"How very interesting," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"But once again hardly relevant," said the consul with a smile. "However,
  I really don't know that I can tell you any more about him. I must say I
  would be interested to know how he can possibly be mixed up in that Hyde Park
  affair."</p>

  <p>"So would we, M'sieur L&eacute;nod," remarked Drummond drily. "By the way, is he
  married?"</p>

  <p>"He was, but his wife died some years ago."</p>

  <p>"Does he live alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Though sometimes a married daughter comes to stay with him, I
  believe."</p>

  <p>"Has he any servants?"</p>

  <p>The consul put down his glass.</p>

  <p>"Captain Drummond," he said quietly, "may I ask the purport of your last
  few questions?"</p>

  <p>Drummond's eyes twinkled.</p>

  <p>"Officially or unofficially, M'sieur L&eacute;nod?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'm not in my office."</p>

  <p>"A very good answer," laughed Drummond. "But even a better one is what the
  Governor of North Carolina said to the Governor of South Carolina."</p>

  <p>He beckoned to the barman.</p>

  <p>"M'sieur L&eacute;nod," he said quietly, "we are infinitely obliged to you for
  what you have told us. But I think in view of your position here it would be
  better if we now discussed the prospects of winter sport."</p>

  <p>The consul gave a little chuckle.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," he murmured. "Er&mdash;with reference to your last
  question&mdash;one old woman and she's deaf."</p>

  <p>"Our friend the consul was very helpful," remarked Drummond ten minutes
  later, as they watched the tall figure passing through the swing doors. "Only
  one old woman, my boy, and she's deaf."</p>

  <p>Cranmer looked a bit uneasy.</p>

  <p>"You know, it's all right for you," he said. "You're a blinking civilian.
  Don't forget I'm a H'army H'orficer. Do you really intend to break in?"</p>

  <p>Drummond lit a cigarette thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I take your meaning, Cranmer," he answered. "And I can assure you, my
  dear fellow, that civilian or no civilian, I don't intend to spend the next
  few months sampling Swiss prison diet. But there can be no drawing back now.
  The whole matter has gone far beyond us and our little affairs. And if
  there's the slightest chance of our finding even the smallest ray of light in
  that villa it's our obvious duty to go there."</p>

  <p>"And you think there is a chance?"</p>

  <p>"Most certainly. Once again, you see, we come up against a man of
  pronounced red tendencies."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that I'm still very much in the dark." said Cranmer.</p>

  <p>"I'll put you wise over dinner," remarked Drummond glancing at his watch.
  "And then we'll have to put through time till about midnight. It won't be
  safe to leave before."</p>

  <p>"Won't it look rather peculiar&mdash;our sneaking out of here in rubber
  shoes?"</p>

  <p>"We'll have to chance that, unless..."</p>

  <p>He turned to the barman.</p>

  <p>"Is there any haunt of vice in this delightful town?" he asked. "A night
  club, or something really dashing like that?"</p>

  <p>"There's the Kursaal, sir. They have classical concerts there."</p>

  <p>Drummond's face paled.</p>

  <p>"No, no. Nothing quite so immoral as that. I mean some place where my
  friend and I could go in safety after dinner to-night."</p>

  <p>"There's the Perroquet, sir. They dance there."</p>

  <p>"That sounds more our form, Cranmer. The Perroquet. Delightful. We will
  repair to this sink of iniquity and have a look at the pretties. And with
  us," he continued in a lower voice, "we will take my rucksac <i>mit</i>
  rubber shoes complete, into which we will change just before reaching the
  villa. It is goot&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>Cranmer grinned.</p>

  <p>"You seem in devilish high spirits," he said. You're used to little
  escapades of this sort; I'm not. And by the time it comes to midnight they
  won't need any castanets in the Perroquet band; I'll lend 'em my knees."</p>

  <p>Drummond roared with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and have some food," he cried. "You'll take to it like a duck
  does to water. And fortunately for us there's no moon."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">VII. &mdash; DEATH AT THE VILLA</a></h2>

  <p>It was just after mid-night when they once again approached the villa Bon
  Ciel. During their walk from the Perroquet they had hardly met a soul;
  Montreux is not a late town. One or two belated cars had passed them, and
  once, in the distance, under the light of a lamp they had seen the stocky
  form of a policeman.</p>

  <p>The night was dark and overcast. Not a star was showing, and there was a
  damp, raw feeling in the air. But the conditions, though unpleasant, were
  perfect for their purpose, and Drummond whistled cheerfully under his breath
  as they left the main road and started to climb.</p>

  <p>Two hundred yards from the villa they changed their shoes, and hid the
  rucksac under a bush. Then they stole forward towards a shaft of light which
  lay across the road, and which proved that someone was still up in Monsieur
  Maier's household. From far away came the ceaseless murmur of a mountain
  stream; otherwise the night was silent.</p>

  <p>At length they reached the line of light, and paused under cover of some
  shrubs to reconnoitre. It came from the room in which they had seen the man
  that afternoon&mdash;a bright bar of yellow shining out underneath the blind
  which had not been quite pulled down.</p>

  <p>The window was open, and the blind was moving gently in the faint night
  breeze. But from where they were standing it was impossible to see right into
  the room. They were too low down, and Drummond was just on the point of
  hoisting Cranmer up on his shoulders when a shadow appeared on the blind. It
  was that of a man standing with his hands in his pockets close to the window;
  they could actually see a strip of his legs through the chink.</p>

  <p>They crouched down waiting and after a few seconds the shadow moved across
  the window and vanished.</p>

  <p>"Our friend is evidently awake," whispered Drummond. "I fear, old boy, our
  vigil may be a long one."</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do?" muttered Cranmer.</p>

  <p>"Wait till he goes to bed, and then sample one of the downstair
  windows."</p>

  <p>Slowly, interminably the time passed, but there was no sign of the light
  being put out. Nor was there any further reappearance of the shadow. And at
  length Drummond stooped down.</p>

  <p>"Get your knees on my shoulders," he whispered, "and hold on to my hands.
  And for the love of Mike don't fall off in the bushes, or we're stung."</p>

  <p>He straightened up, and a moment later heard Cranmer's
  whispered&mdash;"All right."</p>

  <p>"What did you see?" he muttered as he put him down.</p>

  <p>"He's sprawling over the table asleep," said Cranmer. "Hell!" answered
  Drummond. "That's a nuisance. We'll have to chance it&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>And even as he spoke came the sound of the front door opening, and
  footsteps on the gravel.</p>

  <p>"Still as death," he breathed in Cranmer's ear. "If he comes this way I'll
  deal with him."</p>

  <p>The gate opened, and a man came out on to the road not three yards from
  where they were standing. He paused to shut the gate quietly; then he strode
  off away from them in the direction of Montreux.</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord for that," said Drummond. "It would have complicated
  things if I'd had to dot him one. Get up on my shoulders again and see if
  that other bloke is still asleep."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>From above his head came Cranmer's monosyllable.</p>

  <p>"Good. Then we'll chance it now, before the other bird has time to return.
  Let's try the front door."</p>

  <p>Cautiously Drummond pushed open the gate, and, followed by Cranmer crept
  towards the house. From above them came the tapping of the blind against the
  window sill as it oscillated to and fro. And once their shadows, distorted
  eerily, were flung on the bushes from the headlights of a car on the main
  road below.</p>

  <p>They reached the door and Drummond flashed his torch on it.</p>

  <p>"In luck," he whispered. "Not a Yale."</p>

  <p>He turned the handle, and a moment later they were both standing in the
  hall. The house was absolutely silent; even the sound of the stream had
  ceased. But to Cranmer it seemed as if the beating of his heart must be
  audible in Montreux. His hands were shaking; his mouth felt curiously dry.
  And he started like a frightened colt as Drummond laid a hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Steady, old boy," muttered Drummond with a little chuckle. "Just follow
  me, and don't make a noise."</p>

  <p>Once again the beam of the torch explored the darkness; in front of them
  were the stairs. And almost before Cranmer had moved he heard an impatient
  whisper from the landing above, though of Drummond's movement there had been
  no sound.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Cranmer; there's no time to lose."</p>

  <p>The stairs bent round at right angles, and as he joined his leader they
  could both see the light shining under the door of the occupied room.</p>

  <p>Step by step they mounted till they reached the top. And there Drummond
  bent down and peered through the keyhole.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it, Cranmer," he said quietly as he straightened up. "I
  can't quite see, but no man has ever slept in that position. Be prepared for
  something."</p>

  <p>He turned the handle, and gently pushed open the door. And Cranmer,
  standing behind him, heard his breath come in a sharp hiss, and saw his body
  stiffen. Then he peered over his shoulder, and felt violently sick.</p>

  <p>Seated at the desk, which was more like a working bench, was a man whose
  head had literally been battered in. His injuries could only have been caused
  by an attack of wellnigh inconceivable ferocity. The blood which had formed a
  great pool on the table had welled over and was dripping sluggishly on to the
  wooden floor. One hand hung limply down; the other, still clutching a small
  hammer, was on the bench. And in the dead man's eyes there seemed to linger
  an expression of mortal terror.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake&mdash;let's go," said a voice and Cranmer realised it was
  his own.</p>

  <p>Once more he felt that firm, reassuring pressure on his arms; once again
  he heard that quiet voice.</p>

  <p>"Steady, old boy. The poor devil's not a pretty sight, but we've got to go
  through with it. Stand here by the door, and don't under any circumstances
  let your shadow fall on the blind."</p>

  <p>Crouching down, Drummond moved over to the body, while Cranmer, still
  feeling faint and sick, watched him, fascinated. Watched him as he went
  swiftly through the dead man's pockets; watched him glancing through the
  letters he found. Saw him open drawer after drawer of a cupboard that stood
  against the wall, and rummage through their contents; saw him pause and stand
  motionless as he stared at the last one.</p>

  <p>For a moment what was in it conveyed nothing to Drummond; then, like a
  blinding flash there came back to his memory those last cryptic words of
  Jimmy Latimer to Madame P&eacute;lain as the train steamed out of Cannes Station.
  "Sealed fruit tins."</p>

  <p>And there in the drawer were two fruit tins. True, they were not sealed;
  they had been opened, and their contents had been removed. In fact they were
  just two empty tins, and only by the pictures of fruit on the paper wrapper
  that was pasted round each of them was it possible to know what their
  contents had been.</p>

  <p>Thoughtfully Drummond picked one up and examined it. It stood about four
  inches high; the diameter was approximately the same. The label proclaimed
  that it had contained Fancy Quality Fruit Salad, prepared by a firm called
  Petworth, who had packed it in their own orchard factory in
  Gloucestershire.</p>

  <p>He looked inside; nothing. And then a peculiar point struck him. Under
  ordinary circumstances when a top is removed with a tin-opener, the resulting
  cut has ragged edges. But in the tin which he held in his hand the top edge
  was perfectly smooth. And when he looked at it more closely he could plainly
  see in places the marks of a file. Why had the owner of the tin taken the
  trouble to do such a thing?</p>

  <p>He put it back and picked up the other one. And at once things became more
  interesting. To outward appearances the two tins were identical, but the
  interior revealed a striking difference. Soldered into the side, about an
  inch below the top, were three tiny metal cubes, each the size of a small
  die. Their positions formed the corners of an equilateral triangle.</p>

  <p>For a long while he stared at them trying to think what possible object
  they could fulfil. In view of the fact that the dead man's hobby had been
  playing about with springs and things, he might have assumed that the tin was
  the outer case for some patent model he was inventing. But Jimmy's remark
  could not be ignored, so that that simple solution would not hold water.</p>

  <p>He looked at the outside more carefully; no sign of the soldering appeared
  there. And a moment's reflection told him that even if any mark had shown on
  the metal, the paper wrapper would have concealed it.</p>

  <p>He glanced up; Cranmer was standing beside him looking curiously at the
  tin.</p>

  <p>"I told you about Jimmy's remark," said Drummond. "What's your reaction to
  this? You see the edge has been carefully filed down where the opener has
  been used."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," said Cranmer, "you don't use an ordinary opener
  with this brand. I happen to know, because I had to open one the other night.
  They have a key with a slot at the end into which you put a tongue of the
  metal fastening. Then you roll the key round and round..."</p>

  <p>"I know," interrupted Drummond. "Still that doesn't explain those
  studs."</p>

  <p>"It does not," agreed Cranmer. "My God! what's that?"</p>

  <p>Both men stood rigid; the gate had shut and steps could be heard on the
  gravel. Worse still&mdash;voices.</p>

  <p>"Quick," snapped Drummond. "Out on the landing and into some other
  room."</p>

  <p>Like a flash they were through the door, closing it after them. And as
  they were on the landing, the newcomers entered the hall below.</p>

  <p>"I tell you it's all right," came a guttural voice with a pronounced
  accent. "The woman is stone deaf. Almost as deaf"&mdash;he laughed
  harshly&mdash;"as he is."</p>

  <p>Like shadows Drummond and Cranmer faded into a bedroom opposite as the
  footsteps came up the stairs.</p>

  <p>"It is absurd," said another voice, "returning here at all. You have all
  that matters. Mother of Mercy!" The voice rose to a scream.</p>

  <p>Cautiously Drummond opened the door a little and peered out. Two men were
  standing in the room they had just left. One was a big fellow; the other was
  short and rather fat. And it was he who was covering his face with his hands,
  as if to shut out the dreadful thing at the desk.</p>

  <p>"Squeamish," sneered the big man. "When a man gets hit with a coal hammer
  he doesn't generally look as if he'd died of old age. Now then..."</p>

  <p>The words died away, and Drummond saw him take a spring forward. And then
  there came from the room a flood of the most fearful blasphemy.</p>

  <p>"It's gone, I tell you," cried the big man when he could again speak
  coherently. "It's gone."</p>

  <p>"It can't have gone," said his companion in a trembling voice. "You must
  have made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"I tell you, it's gone," snarled the other. "Here is the one without the
  studs, but the other is gone. Moreover"&mdash;into his voice there crept a
  note of fear&mdash;"this drawer was shut. He shut it himself."</p>

  <p>"Well, assuredly, he could not have opened it again. Let us go. For God's
  sake, let us go. You have all that really matters in your pocket."</p>

  <p>"How did that drawer come open?"</p>

  <p>The big man came into sight again and stood staring at his trembling
  companion.</p>

  <p>"I know it was shut," he went on. "When he became foolish he got up and he
  shut it. I can see him doing it now. He crossed and he shut it; then he
  returned to the chair and laughed at me."</p>

  <p>"It is a little thing anyway whether it was open or shut. Let us go."</p>

  <p>"But it is not a little thing that the tin has gone, you fool. Tins do not
  walk on their own. <i>He</i> could not have touched it. <i>So who
  has</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Who, indeed?" whispered Drummond, and Cranmer could feel his grin of pure
  joy. "Put the tin on the bed, old boy; we'll each want both our hands
  shortly. I'll take the big 'un."</p>

  <p>Again he peered out; the fat man was speaking in a quavering voice.</p>

  <p>"What does it matter? If we are found here all is lost. It means
  prison."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, you cur." His companion regarded him with contempt. "You haven't
  got the nerves of a louse. Don't you realise that someone has been here since
  I left?"</p>

  <p>"All the more reason for us to go at once."</p>

  <p>"It couldn't have been the police or they would still have been here."</p>

  <p>"No. But whoever it was may inform the police."</p>

  <p>The big man continued as if the other had not spoken.</p>

  <p>"Yes. They'd still have been here. Now why should this unknown visitor
  take such an apparently useless thing as that tin? Answer me that."</p>

  <p>But the fat man was beyond speech; rivers of perspiration were pouring
  down his face which he was endeavouring to mop up with a shaking hand.</p>

  <p>"Is there any other number in Montreux? Speak, you worm!"</p>

  <p>"Not that I know of," stuttered the fat man.</p>

  <p>"Then it's an enemy...An enemy who knows...Come on...we'll go."</p>

  <p>"Our cue," muttered Drummond, flinging open the door.</p>

  <p>His appearance was so utterly unexpected that for a moment or two the big
  man stood staring dumbfounded across the passage. Which was unwise on his
  part. He had a fleeting vision of a man as big as himself materialising from
  nowhere; then something that seemed like a steam hammer hit him on the jaw.
  He crashed over backwards and his head hit the edge of the bench with a crack
  like the impact of two billiard balls. And it was perhaps poetic justice
  that, as he lay unconscious on the floor, a little rivulet of the blood of
  the man he had murdered welled over and splashed on his face.</p>

  <p>"So much for you," grunted Drummond and turned to a corner from which a
  series of squeaks were issuing, reminiscent of a rabbit caught by a stoat.
  They came from the little fat man who was on his knees in prayer before
  Cranmer.</p>

  <p>At any other time Drummond would have laughed&mdash;the sight was so
  ludicrous. But speed was the order of the day, and his quick eye had spotted
  a length of rope in some lumber behind the door.</p>

  <p>"Bring him here, Cranmer," he said curtly. "Put him in that chair. Gag him
  with his own handkerchief...No, no. In his mouth, man, and knot it behind his
  head. Like a snaffle on a horse. That's right...Now his legs; there's some
  more rope over there."</p>

  <p>They worked in silence, and the result was creditable to all concerned. It
  would have been hard to imagine a more scientifically trussed and gagged
  gentleman than the one who gazed at them fearfully from the chair.</p>

  <p>"Go through his pockets, old boy," said Drummond. "I'll tackle the
  other."</p>

  <p>He crossed to the unconscious man and felt his pulse; it was beating
  evenly and steadily. Fortunate; it would have complicated matters if he had
  killed him. Then he ran over him with skilled hands, and at once found a
  prize.</p>

  <p>In one pocket was a piece of mechanism that looked like the inside of a
  clock. For a moment or two he studied it; evidently this was what had been
  alluded to as "all that really matters." He put it on the bench and continued
  his search. Two private letters; a pocket book which he went through; some
  money.</p>

  <p>"Found anything on yours?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a thing," said Cranmer.</p>

  <p>"Then we'll hop it. Get the tin."</p>

  <p>And with one last look at the room&mdash;at the little fat man whose
  terrified eyes were roving incessantly; at the dead man whose terrified eyes
  were fixed and staring; at the unconscious man sprawling on the
  floor&mdash;Drummond shut the door. And a few minutes later with sighs of
  relief they felt the night breeze cool on their faces, and heard from afar
  off the ceaseless murmur of the mountain stream.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shall wake up in a moment," said Cranmer as they retrieved
  the rucksac and changed their shoes.</p>

  <p>Drummond gave a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"It's been a bit hectic for a first try out," he agreed. "But you did very
  well, my lad&mdash;very well indeed. Now everything depends on Monsieur
  L&eacute;nod."</p>

  <p>Cranmer glanced at him.</p>

  <p>"How do you make that out?"</p>

  <p>"When the deaf servant wakes up to-morrow morning, it will not be long
  before she enters that room. Then the fat will be in the fire. By ten o'clock
  it will be all over the place. And after our conversation with L&eacute;nod to-night
  it would, under ordinary circumstances, be his bounden duty to tell the
  police."</p>

  <p>"I hadn't thought of that. What do you propose to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"Persuade him that the circumstances are <i>not</i> ordinary It's our only
  hope. If he tells the police, the delay will be interminable. And we can't
  afford delay, Cranmer. We've <i>got</i> to get back to England at the first
  possible moment."</p>

  <p>"The fat little man may squeal."</p>

  <p>"He may. On the other hand fear of vengeance may prevent him. Anyway we've
  got to chance that. He doesn't know who we are, which is the main point."</p>

  <p>They turned into the hotel, where a sleepy night porter wished them
  good-night.</p>

  <p>"Come into my room for a moment," said Drummond. "I want to look at this
  machine a little more closely."</p>

  <p>He took it and the fruit tin out of the rucksack, and placed them on the
  table. And the object of the studs inside the tin at once became obvious. For
  the diameter of the machine was such that it would just slip inside the tin
  and then come to rest on the studs.</p>

  <p>"So far so good," remarked Drummond. "But what the deuce happens
  next?"</p>

  <p>Cranmer yawned.</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," he said. "What feels like happening next to me is going
  to bed."</p>

  <p>"Then you push off, old boy. If I can square L&eacute;nod I'll want you to fly
  from Zurich to-morrow. And you'll have to take this machine with you. The tin
  doesn't matter; we can get dozens in England."</p>

  <p>"And what will you do?"</p>

  <p>"Go <i>via</i> Basle through Germany, and probably fly from Brussels."</p>

  <p>Cranmer yawned again.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'll hit the hay. Good night."</p>

  <p>"Night-night," said Drummond absently, and the last Cranmer saw of him as
  he closed the door was peering earnestly into the bowels of the machine.</p>

  <p>Sick with weariness Archie Cranmer stumbled into his room, and almost
  before his head touched the pillow he was asleep. And it seemed to him only
  the next moment that he was awakened by someone shaking his shoulder.</p>

  <p>The daylight was streaming into the room as he opened his eyes to find
  Drummond standing beside the bed.</p>

  <p>"I've been to the consul," said that worthy, "and may Heaven be praised
  the man's a sportsman. When he'd got over his very natural wrath at being
  dragged from his bed at such an ungodly hour, he listened to what I had to
  say. I told him the whole story from A to Z; pointed out to him that if we'd
  had anything to do with the murder we should hardly have talked to him as we
  did last night; and finally appealed to his patriotism. And though he's a
  Swiss there's no doubt about that latter commodity. However, to cut a long
  story short, he has agreed to forget our conversation here last night."</p>

  <p>"Stout feller," said Cranmer.</p>

  <p>"If the fat man spills the beans sufficiently for us to be identified
  L&eacute;nod, of course, can do nothing. But if we are detained here he has agreed
  to see personally that that machine gets back to London, even if he has to
  take it himself, and to tell Ginger Lawson what happened last night. So that
  side of it is settled, so far as anything can be settled in this affair."</p>

  <p>Cranmer jumped out of bed and began to shave.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to borrow my razor?" he asked with a glance at Drummond's
  chin.</p>

  <p>"No, old boy, I don't," said Drummond with a grin. "I have long had a
  fancy to see what I should look like with a beard. And I think it may prove
  useful in England."</p>

  <p>"When do we start?"</p>

  <p>"I've been looking up trains, and there seems a good one at
  eleven-fifteen. Part of it goes to Zurich and part to Basle. If we can get
  that I think we're safe."</p>

  <p>And suddenly Drummond began to laugh.</p>

  <p>"It seems funny, after my long career of singing in the village choir,
  that the only two occasions on which I've been really frightened of the
  police, are the two when I <i>haven't</i> done anything."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">VIII. &mdash; ALGY INTERVENES</a></h2>

  <p>Algy Longworth was singing in his bath. It was not a pleasant sound, but
  his servant, though a little white about the gills was hardened to it, and
  continued to lay the breakfast. He even survived the sudden appearance of his
  master clad only in a bath towel, and proceeded to hand him his letters.</p>

  <p>"We are in voice this morning, Marsh, are we not?" remarked Algy glancing
  through them. "Which, my trusty varlet, is surprising, because beneath this
  outer husk conditions are poor&mdash;very poor. Marsh, I could do with a
  horse's neck."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. How much brandy?"</p>

  <p>"Just as you take it yourself, Marsh. Or is it your considered opinion
  that half a pint of champagne would meet the case better?"</p>

  <p>"I prefer it myself, sir. I find a horse's neck a trifle sweet at this
  hour of the morning."</p>

  <p>"Spoken like a man. Champagne let it be. What are we doing to-day,
  Marsh?"</p>

  <p>"Your engagement book states, sir, that you are lunching at the Ritz with
  a tow-haired filly&mdash;name unknown, and slightly knock-kneed."</p>

  <p>"Impossible, Marsh. Impossible. How could a man of my exalted moral
  standing know anything about her knees. I wonder who the deuce she can
  be."</p>

  <p>"That, sir, I fear is beyond me. The entry was made two or three days ago,
  after an evening you spent at the Golden Boot."</p>

  <p>"I was there last night, Marsh. Tell me, old friend of my youth," he went
  on, lighting a cigarette, "have you noticed anything particularly attractive
  about me lately? Have I recently developed some hitherto latent charm of
  manner which endears me to the world at large?"</p>

  <p>"I have noticed no change, sir."</p>

  <p>"Last night, for instance, Marsh, I became conscious of an air of
  solicitude about my goings and comings, so to speak, which touched me
  greatly, but at the same time a little surprised me. Maiden and men concerned
  themselves with my poor affairs in a way which, I confess, astonished me. It
  removed, I am glad to say, any lingering doubts that I was one of the people
  aimed at in those delightful advertisements of 'What she said and 'What she
  really thought.' But apart from that, Marsh, there was, as I say, an interest
  displayed in me which I really cannot account for."</p>

  <p>His servant crossed to the window and glanced out.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if it's part of the same things, sir. This flat is being
  watched."</p>

  <p>"Watched! Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely, sir. There's the bloke on the other side now. Same man who
  was here for a time yesterday."</p>

  <p>"Come away from the window."</p>

  <p>Algy Longworth sat down at the table, and his eyes had suddenly grown
  thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"When did we last hear from Captain Drummond, Marsh?"</p>

  <p>"He rang you up from his club, sir, about eight days ago. I took the
  message, and you went round to see him."</p>

  <p>"And I rang him up two days after that and found he'd gone to France. It's
  funny, Marsh, all this. Mr. Burton was asking me about him the night before
  last. He, too, seems to have become popular. Ring up his house, and find out
  if he's back in London."</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Marsh returning a few moments later. "He has not come
  back. I took the liberty, sir, of asking his man Denny if anyone was watching
  his house. He had not noticed it up to date, but he is going to keep a
  look-out in future."</p>

  <p>"Good. I'm inclined to think, Marsh, that we may be finding ourselves on
  the warpath once again. And if so I must go into training. No more late
  nights; no more knock-kneed dames. Hullo! who's that?"</p>

  <p>The front door bell had rung.</p>

  <p>"Get me a dressing-gown, and go and see. And don't forget, the cautionary
  period has started."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir."</p>

  <p>Came a murmur of voices from outside, and then suddenly a well-known
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Marsh. I'm glad you didn't recognise me."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" cried Algy, going to the door. "Talk of the devil! My dear
  old boy&mdash;what a magnificent make-up! I wouldn't have known you
  myself."</p>

  <p>Hugh Drummond was standing in the hall, though only by his voice would
  anyone have known him. A master of disguise at any time, on this occasion he
  had excelled himself. A four-days' growth of beard adorned his chin; a greasy
  cap was pulled down over one eye. And by some extraordinary method he had
  managed to alter his actual features; slightly, but enough to deceive anyone.
  Round his neck was knotted a coloured handkerchief in place of a collar; his
  clothes were in keeping with his cap. And in his hand he carried a carpet bag
  of plumber's tools which he put down on the floor.</p>

  <p>"How are you, Algy?" he cried. "I'm just going to get through to Ginger
  Lawson and then I want a drink."</p>

  <p>He dialled the machine, whilst Algy Longworth went back to get dressed.
  And when he returned to his sitting-room it was to find Drummond sitting in
  an easy chair with his face buried in a tankard of ale.</p>

  <p>"What's the great idea?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Are you all ready for the road, Algy?"</p>

  <p>"Sure thing," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Because we'll want all the boys. Something damned funny is on foot, old
  lad. You know I went over to France?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll just tell you briefly what happened in that delectable
  country. You'd better make a few notes, because I'll want you to tell the
  others."</p>

  <p>Algy Longworth listened in silence, except for putting in an occasional
  question.</p>

  <p>"And you slipped out of Switzerland all right," he said, as Drummond
  paused for more beer.</p>

  <p>"No difficulty there. Young Cranmer flew from Zurich and has duly arrived.
  I went through Germany and caught the afternoon boat yesterday from Ostend.
  Strong men shrank from me, appalled at the sight of my beard, but that
  couldn't be helped. And having suitably disguised myself this morning the
  game begins on this side."</p>

  <p>He put down his tankard and his eyes were grim.</p>

  <p>"They've been scoring, Algy, in a way that must cease. First, Jimmy
  Latimer; then the Chief. And from what Ginger Lawson said over the 'phone
  neither Ronald nor Gasdon have rung him up. Which means that they are still
  detained in France&mdash;if not worse."</p>

  <p>Algy Longworth shouted for his servant.</p>

  <p>"Clear these things away, Marsh. Look here, are you <i>absolutely</i> sure
  about that man outside?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely, sir."</p>

  <p>"Rather a jolt, Hugh. This flat is being watched."</p>

  <p>"The devil it is," said Drummond. "That's a nuisance."</p>

  <p>"And last night at the Golden Boot several people were infernally
  inquisitive about you and me."</p>

  <p>"Was Burton there?"</p>

  <p>"Not last night. But little Alice Blackton told me that the day after you
  went there he tried to pump her about you."</p>

  <p>"I know they've got me taped all right. And they're on to you because of
  me."</p>

  <p>"You're sure you weren't spotted at Dover?"</p>

  <p>"My dear feller, with this crowd one can't be <i>sure</i> of anything. And
  I took one or two precautions on leaving the boat-train at Victoria, which
  ensured that I wasn't followed. But I must say that had I thought for an
  instant that they were favouring you with their attentions I should not have
  come here."</p>

  <p>"No one would spot you in that rig."</p>

  <p>"No," agreed Drummond, "I don't think they would. But although they're
  clumsy in their methods, there seems to be such an infernal number of them
  that one can't afford to take any chances. Moreover," he added savagely,
  "their manners if crude are drastic. When I think of poor old Talbot shot in
  cold blood, and in broad daylight in the Park, it fairly gets my goat."</p>

  <p>"Same here," said Algy. "Well, old boy, what are orders?"</p>

  <p>"First of all warn in the boys&mdash;Peter, Ted, the whole bunch. None of
  them are on the suspect list as yet. Get 'em to the club, Algy, and tell 'em
  the whole tale. They must cancel every engagement, and literally live at the
  end of a telephone wire."</p>

  <p>"Interrupting you for a moment, Hugh, since the affair seems to be so
  damned serious, can't you get Scotland Yard straight on to this swine
  Burton?"</p>

  <p>"Lawson has put them wise, of course. But at the moment there is nothing
  to go on. The mere fact that he took Menalin's girl friend to the Golden
  Boot, and that she jeered at us in Nice over the Chief's death, is not enough
  to hang a fly on. No, old boy, we've got to get something far more definite
  than that. And we're going to get it."</p>

  <p>"Right ho! Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"Warn 'em that this is no jest, but the grimmest thing we've ever been up
  against. I'll 'phone orders to Peter&mdash;not to you, since you are suspect.
  So under no circumstances must you be seen with Peter, or go to his flat. In
  fact, except for the meeting at the club, none of you must be seen together.
  When you get my orders you will come separately to the rendezvous I'll give
  Peter. Clear so far?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Where that rendezvous will be, I have no idea. When you will get the
  summons, I have no idea. But this matter is serious, Algy, and everything
  else must go by the board. Impress that on the boys."</p>

  <p>"I will."</p>

  <p>"If anything happens to me leadership devolves on Peter. Tell him
  that."</p>

  <p>"O.K."</p>

  <p>"As an additional precaution if it is easier to send orders by wire, I
  will sign the telegram HUD. Not Drummond; not Hugh. Just HUD. Over the
  telephone I will say 'HUD speaking.'"</p>

  <p>"I get you. I'll warn everyone in. What are you going to do yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Try and get on to Charles Burton's trail. What's the name of his house in
  Sussex?"</p>

  <p>"Birchington Towers. It's a biggish place standing on a bit of a hill, and
  surrounded by trees."</p>

  <p>"Sounds promising. Near Pulborough?"</p>

  <p>"About two miles from Pulborough on the Arundel road."</p>

  <p>"What's happened, Algy, about that girl you said he was keen
  on&mdash;Molly Castledon?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing so far as I know. But she'll certainly give him the raspberry.
  And from what you tell me it'll be a darned good thing if she does."</p>

  <p>Drummond looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What sort of a wench is she, Algy?"</p>

  <p>"Very nice. Charming girl. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Reliable?"</p>

  <p>"In what way?"</p>

  <p>"Supposing she didn't give him the raspberry. At least, not yet. Supposing
  she played with him gently, and wangled an invitation to Birchington
  Towers."</p>

  <p>"Hold 'ard, old man. Is it safe?"</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, Burton is not going to be such a congenital half-wit as to
  hurt her. What possible object could he have in so doing?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I can ask her. I can ring her up now and suggest a spot of alcohol.
  But I shall have to give her some reason."</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't you? You needn't tell her the whole thing. Just say that
  Charles is not all he seems on the surface, and that we are very anxious for
  any information we can collect about him. You can hint that it's a big thing,
  and that the country itself may be in danger."</p>

  <p>"He's not likely to breathe a word of anything to her."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not. But a girl with her eyes open can frequently find out
  things. Especially if Burton has entered for the matrimonial stakes. Any
  scrap of news, Algy, might prove of value."</p>

  <p>"Well, as I said, I can but ask her."</p>

  <p>"Her people won't mind, will they?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! My dear fellow, the old woman will swallow her false teeth in
  her excitement."</p>

  <p>"Then get on with it," said Drummond rising. "Do you know where Burton is
  now?"</p>

  <p>"No. But it's possible Alice might."</p>

  <p>"Do you know her number?"</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>"Then give her a ring on chance."</p>

  <p>Drummond crossed the room, and peered cautiously out of the window, as
  Algy went into the hall There on the opposite side of the road was a man
  rather obviously doing nothing. He was an inconspicuous individual, of much
  the same type as the man who had followed him in Piccadilly, but his
  occupation shouted itself aloud. And once again Drummond was struck with the
  extreme amateurishness of so many of the smaller fry on the other side. The
  man could never have shadowed anyone before in his life.</p>

  <p>"She believes he's down in Sussex," said Algy coming back into the room.
  "In any case she knows he's going there for the weekend."</p>

  <p>"Good. I've been watching your sleuth, old boy."</p>

  <p>"Still there, is he? Let's have a look at the blighter. Ah! yes, I see
  him. A respectable looking fellow too, you know. Shall I go out and push his
  face?"</p>

  <p>"No. But I'm going to let you leave the flat before me. I want to be quite
  sure that it is you and not me he's after. You barge on round to the club,
  old boy, and get busy."</p>

  <p>"Suppose we want to get in touch with you, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Agony column, <i>Morning Post</i>. Make it cryptic; address it to HUD and
  sign it P. for Peter."</p>

  <p>"It's a date. Well, so long, old man. I wish to God I could think who the
  knock-kneed girl is I'm supposed to be lunching with at the Ritz."</p>

  <p>A faint smile twitched round Drummond's lips as he heard the front door
  slam, and a moment or two later Algy appeared on the pavement, and began to
  saunter slowly along the street. Sure enough the man followed him at a decent
  interval, and Drummond gave a sigh of relief. So far as he could see he had
  successfully lost himself. And how long that state of affairs continued would
  depend entirely on his own skill.</p>

  <p>He poured himself out some more beer, and sat down in an easy chair. For
  the first time since the beginning of his hectic rush from Nice he really had
  leisure to review the situation; up till now his own getaway had occupied his
  whole mind.</p>

  <p>The thing that worried him most was the failure of Standish and Gasdon to
  reach England. Particularly Gasdon; Standish, assuming he had returned to
  Cannes, would barely have had time. But that Gasdon, who should have been in
  England two days ago, was still in France was ominous. However, they were
  both men well able to look after themselves, and in any case there was
  nothing that he could do. His immediate job was to follow the advice he had
  given Algy and get busy.</p>

  <p>The first thing to do was to have a talk with Ginger Lawson. But here a
  difficulty presented itself. They would almost certainly be shadowing him,
  and that meant running the risk of Drummond himself being picked up again.
  Especially as Ginger, though an excessively stout-hearted officer, was not
  very adept at work of that sort. As against that, to judge by the previous
  performers, nor were the other side.</p>

  <p>"Marsh," he called out, "ring up the War Office and ask for Major
  Lawson."</p>

  <p>A simple plan had suggested itself to his mind, and simplicity was
  advisable with Ginger.</p>

  <p>"On the line, sir."</p>

  <p>Marsh put his head in at the door, and Drummond went to the telephone.</p>

  <p>"That you, Ginger? Drummond again. I've got to have a talk with you."</p>

  <p>"Delighted, old boy. Come round now."</p>

  <p>"Not on your life," said Drummond with a short laugh. "Things are much too
  serious for that. You've got to come and see me, but I don't want you
  followed. When you go to the club for lunch go in as usual by the entrance in
  St. James's Square. Walk straight through and leave the club at once by the
  ladies' entrance in Pall Mall. Get into a taxi and drive to Heppel
  Street&mdash;Number 10."</p>

  <p>"Where the hell is Heppel Street?"</p>

  <p>"Behind the British Museum. I'll be waiting for you, and I'll have a lunch
  of sorts ready."</p>

  <p>"All right," came Ginger's resigned voice.</p>

  <p>"And should the necessity arise don't forget that my name is Johnson and
  I'm a plumber."</p>

  <p>"May Allah help the drains. Right ho! old lad. I'll be there. About
  one."</p>

  <p>Drummond replaced the receiver; so far so good. His next move must be to
  find out if his own house was being watched. It was almost a waste of time,
  but it was just possible that if they still believed him to be in France,
  they might not have bothered to do so. And if so, there were several things
  he would have liked to get hold of; in particular, a revolver, having left
  his other in Cannes.</p>

  <p>"I'm off now, Marsh," he said picking up his bag of tools. "See that Mr.
  Longworth behaves himself. No, don't open the door. I'm the plumber."</p>

  <p>He let himself out, and standing on the doorstep, he proceeded to fill a
  singularly offensive pipe. His eyes darted this way and that; there was no
  sign of anyone suspicious. Then once more picking up his bag, he slouched off
  down the street.</p>

  <p>One glance was sufficient as he neared his own house; they had not
  neglected the obvious precaution. But Drummond feeling perfectly secure in
  his disguise, determined on a bold move. He walked up the steps and rang the
  bell.</p>

  <p>"Is this Mrs. Rowbotham's 'ouse?" he demanded as Denny opened the
  door.</p>

  <p>"No, it ain't." Came a pause. "Good Lord! sir, I'd never have known
  you."</p>

  <p>"Dry up, you fool. I was told to come to Number 94...Mrs. Rowbotham. Bring
  my revolver to 10, Heppel Street to-night...Where is 'er blinking 'ouse?"</p>

  <p>"And watch that bloke opposite."</p>

  <p>Drummond consulted a dirty note-book.</p>

  <p>"There you are, see, Rowbotham. 94, Clarges Street. Bring some money too:
  twenty pounds."</p>

  <p>"This ain't Clarges Street; it's Half Moon Street. Very good, sir. Next
  street along there."</p>

  <p>"Thanks, mate."</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the steps he paused to relight his pipe and take stock of
  the man on the other side of the road. It was a tougher-looking specimen this
  time, who might have been a professional bruiser. But he evinced not the
  smallest interest in the passing plumber, and he was still on sentry go when
  Drummond boarded a bus in Piccadilly.</p>

  <p>As a residential quarter Heppel Street is not to be recommended. A row of
  dingy houses mournfully confronts another row of even dingier ones. At each
  end was traffic and life, but nothing ever came through that stagnant
  backwater. The arrival of a taxi was an event; the only wheeled traffic was
  the milkman's cart and an occasional tradesman's van.</p>

  <p>Number 10 differed only from Nos. 11 and 12 in one respect; it was owned
  by Mrs. Penny. And Mrs. Penny had been in the service of the Drummond family
  for many years in days gone by. Why, when she was pensioned off, she had
  decided to live in such a repulsive locality, was one of these mysteries
  which he had long given up trying to solve. It remained that she had done so,
  and the fact had proved very useful to him in the past.</p>

  <p>A better hiding-place it would have been impossible to find. Mrs. Penny
  worshipped him with that touching and dog-like devotion so often displayed by
  old retainers on the children they have looked after. Torture would not have
  made her speak if she thought she was giving Master Hugh away. And though she
  sometimes expressed mild disapproval of his goings-on, as she called them, it
  was with a twinkle in her eye which quite belied her words.</p>

  <p>One room in the house was permanently set aside for him. In it he kept
  half a dozen different disguises, and though he might not go near the place
  for a year he knew he would always find them in perfect condition whenever he
  wanted them.</p>

  <p>So far as is known there had never been a Mr. Penny. It was a courtesy
  title which lent, as Drummond always assured her, an air of respectability to
  their relations. But though he used to pull her leg about it in private,
  should a neighbour come in he was punctilious in his reference to the late
  lamented. On one evening it is true he had made a slight break by mentioning
  the grave at Wandsworth, and ten minutes later changing the venue to
  Hampstead, but in the wild hilarity of high tea the lapse had passed
  unnoticed.</p>

  <p>"Darling," he called out as he entered the house, "put on your bonnet and
  shawl and trot off to the market. Get me two juicy, succulent steaks, and a
  nice bit of cheese. A gentleman is coming to lunch at one o'clock."</p>

  <p>"That beard, Master Hugh!" The old lady emerged from the kitchen. "Can't
  you shave it off, lovey?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet, Jane. Soon I hope it may be but a fantastic dream, but not yet.
  Let's have some onions and fried potatoes, and if you can get some celery
  I'll give you a kiss. And if any strange woman offers you a chocolate tell
  her she's a hussy. You can't be too careful these days."</p>

  <p>"Will you be wanting some more beer, Master Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"How many bottles are there left?"</p>

  <p>"I ordered a dozen, dearie, last night. But I can only find four."</p>

  <p>"Strange, Jane&mdash;very strange. How I can possibly have left as many as
  that is beyond me. Another dozen, darling."</p>

  <p>"Who's the gentleman, Master Hugh? Do I know him?"</p>

  <p>"No, Jane&mdash;you've never met him. He's a Major Lawson."</p>

  <p>"Are you going on one of them wild pranks of yours again?"</p>

  <p>"I am, my angel."</p>

  <p>"Do be careful, dearie. You know what bad colds you used to have as a
  baby. And if you get your feet wet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Drummond burst into a roar of laughter.</p>

  <p>"I shall borrow your elastic-sided boots, you old darling. Now pop along,
  and don't forget the celery."</p>

  <p>He watched her waddle down the street; then picking up the morning paper
  he glanced through it. It was duller than usual, and he was on the point of
  throwing it down when a small paragraph caught his eye.</p>

  <blockquote>
    MYSTERY MILLIONAIRE<br>
    <br>
    ARRIVAL IN LONDON<br>
    M. Serge Menalin, sometimes alluded to as the mystery millionaire, has
    arrived in London, accompanied by his beautiful wife. They have taken a
    suite at the Ritz-Carlton, and it is understood that they are staying there
    for two or three weeks. They have recently been in the South of France.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Drummond's eyes narrowed; so Menalin had appeared on the scene in person,
  complete with lady. Did that mean that things were coming to a head?</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette and began to pace up and down the little room. If only
  there was some ray of light in the darkness, some pointer to act as a guide.
  He heard Mrs. Penny come in, and shortly after the wonderful smell of frying
  onions swept through room and house. But he was barely conscious of it; round
  and round in his brain turned the same unanswered question&mdash;what was at
  the bottom of it all?</p>

  <p>A taxi drawing up outside brought him to the window; it was Ginger Lawson
  arriving, and he went out into the hall to let him in.</p>

  <p>"Heavens above! old man," cried that outraged officer, pointing a finger
  at his chin, "why the grouse moor?"</p>

  <p>"All in good time, Ginger. I want to make quite sure you haven't been
  followed."</p>

  <p>Drummond was peering through the curtains, but there was no one in sight.
  And at length he came back into the room.</p>

  <p>"I carried out your instructions," said Lawson. "Though what the devil
  anyone should want to follow me for is beyond me."</p>

  <p>"They followed the Chief all right, didn't they?"</p>

  <p>"The swine," cried Lawson savagely. "If I could catch those devils..."</p>

  <p>"From what I read in the papers you're never likely to. When was the
  funeral?"</p>

  <p>"The day before yesterday. What on earth is it all about, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Penny came bustling in with the steaks.</p>

  <p>"Jane," cried Drummond, "this is Major Lawson. Short for antimacassar
  Jane, old boy. She has a passion for antimacassars which oversteps the bounds
  of decency. Put everything down, darling, and half a dozen bottles of beer
  and I'll shout when we're ready for the cheese."</p>

  <p>"I got the celery, Master Hugh."</p>

  <p>"Very good girl. Now, Ginger," he went on seriously as the old lady left
  the room. "Let's get down to things. Young Cranmer has, of course, told you
  about the show at the villa. Now have you made anything out of that
  mechanical device?"</p>

  <p>"I sent it to an expert at the Yard," said Lawson. "And the utmost he
  could say was that as the thing stood it could fulfil no purpose at all. But
  that with the insertion of a spring it could be wound up just as a clock is
  wound up. Further, that it contained the additional mechanism which you only
  find in an alarum clock&mdash;that's to say it could be set to go off at a
  given time."</p>

  <p>"Strange," said Drummond thoughtfully. "In conjunction with that fruit
  tin. And Jimmy's cryptic utterance."</p>

  <p>"Are you playing with the idea that it is some sort of bomb that is
  intended?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible to do otherwise."</p>

  <p>"Then why go to all the bother of obtaining a proprietary brand of fruit
  tin? Any old tin would do."</p>

  <p>"There's one very good reason, Ginger, so it seems to me. It's a stock
  size. There can be no mistake about its dimensions. And if these bombs are
  being manufactured in large quantities, possibly in different parts of the
  country, it might be most important to ensure that they were identical."</p>

  <p>"But, good Lord! man&mdash;" began Lawson incredulously and Drummond held
  up his hand.</p>

  <p>"I don't know if Ronald put it in his letter, but there was one remark
  that poor old Jimmy made to his girl friend out there that sticks in my
  memory. He said it was a plot which out-Vernes Jules Verne. And Jimmy was not
  an alarmist."</p>

  <p>"That's true," agreed Lawson.</p>

  <p>"You saw, didn't you, that Menalin has arrived in London complete with
  wife?"</p>

  <p>"I did." Lawson pushed away his plate and stared thoughtfully at the fire.
  "By the way," he said suddenly, "who is this man Gasdon you were talking
  about on the 'phone?"</p>

  <p>"An Englishman we met in Nice, again after Ronald wrote that letter. And
  full value, Ginger. He advanced a very remarkable theory. He suggested the
  possibility of a sudden devastating attack on England, financed, controlled
  and directed by the Reds."</p>

  <p>"Rot, old boy; rot. We have accurate information of the whole of their
  movement here in England. It's blah, blah, and talk from the word 'go.'"</p>

  <p>"Here in England&mdash;perhaps. Gasdon's theory is that the thing might be
  engineered from outside, and be under the control of this man Menalin."</p>

  <p>"He hates us, of course. We know that. But what could be his object?"</p>

  <p>Drummond shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Ask me another. There I'm out of my depth. But it seems to me that there
  are quite a number of people in Europe who would not be sorry to see us down
  and out."</p>

  <p>"That is perfectly true. At the same time, old boy, the whole idea seems
  most terribly far-fetched."</p>

  <p>"That was my first reaction, but I've been thinking it over since. And now
  I'm not so sure. We're in a pretty helpless condition, Ginger."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely helpless, I agree. True at long last we're re-arming, but most
  of our ships are antiquated, and as far as planes are concerned we're swamped
  for numbers."</p>

  <p>"It's a funny thing," said Drummond thoughtfully, "but the very first
  night the Chief put me on to this job, when I was round at the Golden Boot, I
  had a most extraordinary experience. I suppose it only lasted a second or
  two, but it was the most vivid thing I have ever known. For a space I was
  actually back in France, with the flares lobbing up close to and the stink of
  death all round. The room had gone, the band had ceased. I heard the phit of
  a bullet; I heard the drone of a crump. And then as suddenly as it had come,
  it went."</p>

  <p>"An omen?" Lawson looked at him curiously. Drummond shrugged his shoulders
  again.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a fanciful sort of bloke," he said, "but I wonder. Something
  pretty damnable is in the wind, Ginger. And the trouble, as I said to Algy,
  is that, officially, we haven't got a leg to stand on."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not enough for the police to act."</p>

  <p>"It would be fatal, Ginger, absolutely fatal. This has got to be done
  privately. The last thing we want to do is to arouse their suspicions. I'm
  hoping they think I'm still in France, but I'm not banking on it."</p>

  <p>"Well, old boy, what do you want me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Be the link, Ginger, between me and officialdom. And if anything happens
  to me&mdash;act immediately. I'll keep you posted in whatever I may find out.
  If Ronald or Gasdon ring you up tell 'em how matters stand, but be very sure
  that you're speaking to the right man. You know Ronald's voice, but you don't
  know Gasdon's, and they are quite capable of supplying a substitute. And
  don't forget that you're probably a marked man yourself."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Penny appeared at the door.</p>

  <p>"Are you ready for the cheese, Master Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"We are, my pet. And the steak was delicious." The old lady beamed all
  over her face.</p>

  <p>"Would you like a glass of red currant wine with your cheese?" she
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Jane darling," said Drummond. "I hate to hurt your feelings, but I cannot
  tell a lie. I can think of nothing I should abominate more."</p>

  <p>"You used to be very fond of it when you were small," she cried
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>"There you are, Ginger. There you see the woman who first set my toddling
  footsteps on the slippery path of drink. Away, temptress, and produce the
  celery."</p>

  <p>Lawson glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I must be getting back, old boy. But I understand the position, and I'll
  do just what you've suggested. Anyway&mdash;here's luck."</p>

  <p>He raised his tankard and drained it, then he rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"No, I won't have any cheese. I'm late already, and this is a day's march
  from the War House. Goodbye, Mrs. Penny, and thank you so much for a
  delightful lunch. So long, Hugh, I'll let myself out."</p>

  <p>"A good fellow, Jane," said Drummond as the front door banged. "And now,
  my love, I am going upstairs to sleep. I have a premonition that during the
  next week or so I'll have to go a bit short of that commodity."</p>

  <p>"When are you going, dearie?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, Jane. Denny is bringing one or two trifles round for me
  to-night, and you can give him some of your red currant wine. I wonder," he
  added half to himself, "what luck Algy has had."</p>

  <p>He was to find out next morning. For at that very moment Algy Longworth
  was handing in an advertisement for the Agony column of the <i>Morning
  Post.</i> And it ran as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "HUD. Filly agrees postpone raspberry. Will be there strong beginning. P."
  </blockquote>

  <p>Which was not difficult to interpret. Evidently Molly Castledon was going
  to play the game, and further would be at Birchington Towers for the
  week-end.</p>

  <p>"Stop snoring, George, and listen to me."</p>

  <p>With a slight start Sir George Castledon sat up in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Was I snoring, my love?"</p>

  <p>"Should I have said so, if you were not? It was that second glass of port
  after lunch."</p>

  <p>Resignedly Sir George watched the wife of his bosom lower her ample form
  into a chair facing him. The room was warm; he yearned for peace. But one
  glance at his wife's face had shattered that hope. A domestic storm was
  brewing.</p>

  <p>"Are you aware that Molly is now playing golf with that young man?"</p>

  <p>"What young man, my dear?" he said feebly.</p>

  <p>Lady Castledon regarded him stonily through her lorgnettes and Sir George
  wilted. Small wonder; there was a story current in London that on one
  occasion her Ladyship had inadvertently entered a field tenanted by a bull. A
  few moments later it was tenanted by her; the bull had left, snorting with
  terror.</p>

  <p>"Don't be more of a fool than God made you, George; you annoy me. What do
  you propose to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"Do about it, my dear?"</p>

  <p>The worthy baronet scratched his head.</p>

  <p>"Don't keep on repeating what I say, George. Even if you are completely
  fuddled with alcohol you can surely grasp the fact that Molly is playing golf
  with that imbecile Algy what's-his-name, and that Mr. Burton is all by
  himself."</p>

  <p>"What's that? I'd better go and talk to him, my love."</p>

  <p>He half rose from his chair.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, George. Do you imagine he wishes to listen to your half-witted
  utterances? You must talk to him."</p>

  <p>"But, damn it, Jane, that's what I suggested a moment ago, and you jumped
  down my throat."</p>

  <p>"Not Burton. I mean that idiot with an eyeglass."</p>

  <p>"What on earth am I to say to him? There's no harm in them playing golf if
  they want to."</p>

  <p>"George. I shall shake you in a minute. Who said there was any harm in it?
  But this afternoon was a heaven-sent opportunity for Mr. Burton to propose to
  Molly. If you'd had the gumption of an owl you would have taken that
  Longworth thing for a good brisk walk."</p>

  <p>"My God!" Sir George shuddered violently.</p>

  <p>"It would have been extremely good for your liver, and it would have got
  him out of the way. However, that can't be helped now; you must concentrate
  on after tea. The other guests do not arrive till about six, which should
  leave plenty of time. So as soon as tea is over you will suggest a game of
  billiards to Mr. Longworth. He won't like to refuse a man of your age. And
  when you've got him in the billiard-room you will keep him there. Do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my love. Supposing Molly comes too."</p>

  <p>"Leave that to me, George."</p>

  <p>Lady Castledon rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Leave that to me. Molly will not come to the billiard-room."</p>

  <p>She swept out and Sir George sighed, a thing he had done frequently of
  late. Ever since that cursed dance Jane had had only one idea in her head.
  And the trouble was he did not like Charles Burton. The man seemed a
  gentleman and all that sort of thing, and he was certainly wealthy, but he
  did not like him. No definite reason; nothing particular on which he could
  put a finger; he just couldn't cotton to the blighter. As he had wittily said
  to old Lord Crumpleigh; "It's not the clothes that make the man, Bill; it's
  what's inside 'em."</p>

  <p>A quick remark that; sized up the situation admirably. And he wasn't going
  to have Molly married to a shop in Savile Row, whatever Jane might say. True
  he had not actually put his foot down up to date, but on one point he was
  determined. There was to be no coercion. If Molly wanted to marry Burton she
  could, but he wouldn't have any pressure brought to bear on her.</p>

  <p>He rose and walked over to the window. The floods were out, and below him
  there stretched a huge expanse of water from which trees rose like scattered
  islands. Away in the distance lay the South Downs, with Chanctonbury Ring
  showing clear in the setting sun. A glorious view, unequalled in that part of
  Sussex, and he was on the point of stepping out on to the lawn when two men
  came round a corner of the house in earnest conversation. So earnest was it
  that they did not see him until they were close to, and when they did so the
  conversation ceased abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon," remarked Sir George affably.</p>

  <p>"Goot afternoon," answered one of them, speaking with a pronounced foreign
  accent.</p>

  <p>"Lovely view," continued Sir George, wondering who they were. For neither
  of them wore a hat, and they both gave the impression of having just come out
  of the house for a stroll. Possibly some of the party who had arrived early.
  And if they were typical of the remainder of the guests it looked as if it
  was going to be a jolly week-end. For with a surly grunt from the man who had
  first spoken, the two of them resumed their walk and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Sir George raised his eyebrows; then, lighting a cigarette, he stepped
  through the window. There was a faint and rather pleasant nip in the air, and
  he decided to have a stroll round the grounds. Doubtless, Jane would be
  entertaining their host, so that he was not wanted.</p>

  <p>He left the drive that ran down to the main road on his right, and walked
  towards a summer-house about a hundred yards away. His path was bordered on
  each side with rhododendron bushes, which in the spring would be a blaze of
  colour Just now, however, they seemed dank and gloomy, and the summer-house
  itself was even worse. Thick cobwebs covered the windows, and when he tried
  the door he found it was locked. Dimly inside he could see a pile of
  deck-chairs, but it surprised him that a man of Burton's money who must keep
  two or three gardeners, should allow such obvious neglect and untidiness on
  his property.</p>

  <p>Turning round he studied the house. It was bigger than he had thought,
  with an unsuspected wing at the back which gave it a T-shaped effect. Thirty
  bedrooms at least, reflected Sir George, and wondered what the deuce Burton
  wanted a house of that size for. "Wouldn't have the damn place as a gift
  myself," he muttered, and even as he spoke he saw his host coming towards
  him.</p>

  <p>"Inspecting the property, Burton," he said as the other approached.
  "Biggish place you've got here."</p>

  <p>"Too big sometimes, Sir George, and at others not big enough. I often have
  parties here when my accommodation is taxed to the uttermost."</p>

  <p>"Just met two of your guests a few minutes ago. Foreigners of sorts."</p>

  <p>Charles Burton laughed.</p>

  <p>"Not guests," he remarked. "They were two of my secretaries. I have so
  many connections in my business that I have to keep a foreign staff as well
  as an English one."</p>

  <p>"Really! Which reminds me, you know, though it is an extraordinary thing
  to say, I'm dashed if I know what your business is."</p>

  <p>The two men were strolling back towards the house, and for the fraction of
  a second a smile twitched round Burton's lips.</p>

  <p>"Quite a number of people have asked me the same question, Sir George, but
  I can assure you there is no mystery about it. I am the English
  representative of a financial group&mdash;or house if you prefer the
  word&mdash;that has ramifications all over the world. There is practically
  nothing that we do not deal in; from real estate to raw materials; from
  armaments to agricultural machinery. And because our tentacles are so
  far-flung we have information at our disposal which no one firm in any
  country could hope to possesss. And correct information is essential if you
  wish to make money."</p>

  <p>"Very true," agreed Sir George. "I wish my damned broker would give it to
  me a bit more often."</p>

  <p>Once again a smile flickered round Burton's mouth.</p>

  <p>"You must let me give you a tip or two. And I hope that perhaps in the not
  too distant future I may be in a position where it will not only be a
  pleasure to do so, but even a right."</p>

  <p>"Eh! What's that?"</p>

  <p>The baronet stared at him.</p>

  <p>"I have been talking to Lady Castledon," said Burton, "and I am glad to
  say that she has been good enough to approve of my suggestion. It concerns
  your charming daughter. Now I am fully aware that according to standards
  to-day, I am being old-fashioned; parents seem to be the last people who are
  consulted. I do not agree with that at all. And so I would like to know if I
  have your consent to approaching Molly and asking her to become my wife."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul," cried the baronet. "Most unexpected, my dear Burton;
  most unexpected." Must keep up the pretence of surprise anyway...And really
  it was decent of the man to have come to him and Jane first..."Little
  Molly...She's very young, you know; only just out...Not like these modern
  girls...Still, if her mother approves, and Molly herself is agreeable, I am
  quite prepared to give my consent."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Sir George. I am very sensible of the honour you have paid
  me."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, not at all. Well, I must go and talk to Jane about it."</p>

  <p>Charles Burton watched his retreating figure with an inscrutable look in
  his eyes. Now that the die was cast, now that he had put himself in such a
  position that he <i>must</i> ask Molly Castledon to marry him, he wondered if
  he had been a fool. What on earth did he want to tie himself up with a girl
  for? There were hundreds of other women to be had for the asking&mdash;or
  paying.</p>

  <p>The trouble was that for the first time one particular woman was seriously
  interfering with his life. Ever since he had first met Molly Castledon she
  had intruded on his thoughts in a way he found most disquieting. It was
  strange, for he had met many prettier girls. Nevertheless, the fact remained
  that, try as he would, he could not get her out of his mind. He wanted her as
  he had never wanted anyone before. And being no fool he realised that in her
  case his intentions, on the surface, at any rate, would have to be strictly
  honourable. Afterwards...Well, it would all depend on how long it lasted.</p>

  <p>That Molly herself would refuse never entered his head. Women did not
  refuse Charles Burton. Still it had been as well to pull out the dope with
  the old people; better to have everybody happy and satisfied. And there was
  no doubt that the horse-faced mother would prove a valuable ally, in case the
  girl did not jump to it at once.</p>

  <p>The sight of a car coming up the drive brought a faint frown to his
  forehead; Algy Longworth and Molly were returning from golf. Now the reason
  he had asked that brainless idiot down for the week-end had certainly not
  been that he should take Molly off to the links. In fact when he had realised
  after luncheon that they had gone, he had felt definitely annoyed. Charles
  Burton disliked his arrangements being interfered with. However as he walked
  towards the car his face expressed only benign satisfaction at two of his
  guests having enjoyed themselves.</p>

  <p>"Don't leave me, Algy," muttered the girl. "Stick closer than a clam. The
  blighter looks as if he was going to say his piece at any moment."</p>

  <p>"Trust Algy. But you'll have to go through it some time, my pet."</p>

  <p>"Had a good game?" said Charles Burton affably as he came up.</p>

  <p>"Tophole, my dear old host," answered Algy. "And if I'd sunk my sixth putt
  on the last green I'd have beaten her. Pretty hot&mdash;what!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you would care to see round the garden," remarked Burton
  turning to the girl. "Or are you too tired?"</p>

  <p>For a moment she hesitated, then she handed her clubs to Algy. She
  <i>had</i> promised to go through with it, so it might as well be now.</p>

  <p>"I should like to, Mr. Burton," she said. "Take those in for me,
  Algy."</p>

  <p>"Right, my angel. I feel honoured at the commission."</p>

  <p>He turned towards the house, as the other two strolled off, and not for
  the first time he felt misgivings over the whole thing. True it was only
  pretence on her part, but if Burton was the swine that recent events made him
  appear to be, even pretence was over the odds. In fact, if it had been anyone
  except Drummond who had suggested it, he would have turned it down flat.</p>

  <p>He entered the hall to perceive too late that it was largely occupied by
  Lady Castledon.</p>

  <p>"And where is Molly, Mr. Bugworth?" she boomed as soon as she saw him.</p>

  <p>"Treading a measure midst the anemones with our host, Lady Castlegong," he
  burbled genially. "Good game this. What's your next fancy in
  nomenclature?"</p>

  <p>He sauntered over to a side table and helped himself to a whisky and
  soda.</p>

  <p>"What about a spot of Auntie's ruin for you? It clarifies the brain, and
  prevents the nose turning blue."</p>

  <p>"I do not drink at this hour of the afternoon, young man."</p>

  <p>"Don't you? You look as if you did. Or when I say that what I really
  intend to convey is that you don't look as if you didn't, if you take my
  meaning."</p>

  <p>He came back to the fire with his glass in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Nice wench&mdash;your daughter," he continued. "Definitely a nifty bit. I
  suggested the old wedding bells to her this afternoon, but as it made her
  miss her drive I didn't pursue the subject."</p>

  <p>From the chair there arose sounds as of a cow elephant, suffering from
  asthma.</p>

  <p>"Am I to understand"&mdash;words came at last&mdash;"that you have
  proposed to Molly?</p>

  <p>"Such is my recollection. It must have been her, because the only other
  woman I met had a purple face and muscles like walnuts. She was murdering her
  caddie in a bunker when I last saw her."</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly cease talking for one moment and listen to me. Here and
  now I wish you clearly to understand that neither Sir George nor I would ever
  give our consent to Molly marrying a...a specimen like you. I believe you
  have a certain amount of money, but from what little I have heard about you,
  you represent a type of modern young man for whose continued existence I can
  see no possible object." She glared at him. "What are you waggling your
  finger for?"</p>

  <p>"I was just trying to get the tempo and the first note of the seven-fold
  Amen," explained Algy. "No, it eludes me. But how right you are&mdash;how
  very right. There is just one academic point, however, on which I would like
  to join issue with you. Do we exist? Or is it just the figment of a
  disordered stomach? If you carefully study the works of Einstein and P. G.
  Wodehouse you will have to agree, that amongst the master brains there is
  considerable doubt on the subject. Are you really you, or are you a sweet
  ethereal wraith, wrapped round a central electron?"</p>

  <p>Lady Castledon rose to her feet.</p>

  <p>"If you were my son, Mr. Longworth, and a little younger you would soon
  find out if I was an ethereal wraith wrapped round an electron or not. Don't
  forget what I said about Molly. Ah! Mr. Burton, I hear you have been showing
  my little girl round the garden."</p>

  <p>Charles Burton and Molly had just come in by the front door, and Algy
  stole a glance at his face. But he gathered nothing from it; as always, it
  was like a mask.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we've been having a stroll round," he said.</p>

  <p>"Begonias on the up grade?" asked Algy hopefully as Molly joined him by
  the fire.</p>

  <p>"Move over in the bed, Algy," she remarked. "You take up too much
  room."</p>

  <p>"Molly!" Lady Castledon gave a gasp of horror, "What was that you
  said?"</p>

  <p>"Well he does, mother. Why men should always consider that they have a
  prescriptive right to the centre of the fireplace, is one of those things
  that defeats me. Algy darling, I need alcohol. What's on that tray?"</p>

  <p>Charles Burton had gone upstairs and Algy looked at her with a grin.</p>

  <p>"Have you something to confess to your mamma, my precious?"</p>

  <p>"Shut up. And get me a drink. What's in that bottle?"</p>

  <p>"Sloe gin."</p>

  <p>"That'll do. And I want a lot."</p>

  <p>"Molly dear," said her mother, "am I to understand that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are, darling; you are. Thanks, Algy."</p>

  <p>"Oh! my dear, I'm so glad. And your father will be delighted."</p>

  <p>"Good Heavens! I haven't accepted the man, if that's what you mean. But I
  haven't actually refused him. What are you pinching my leg for, Algy?"</p>

  <p>"Only, my love, that I am sure it will merely be a question of time before
  you make him the happiest man alive."</p>

  <p>His back was towards Lady Castledon, and he frowned horribly at Molly.</p>

  <p>"We will resume our talk later, Molly," said her mother acidly, "when this
  impossible young man is not present."</p>

  <p>She swept out of the hall, and Algy gave a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, my dear, if I nipped the old suspender," he said, "but you must
  remember one thing. On the face of it this has got to be a genuine affair.
  Your mother has got to believe that you really are thinking the matter over,
  if she's going to pull her weight properly. For, if that fellow Burton gets
  an inkling that this is a put up job, we're absolutely in the
  <i>consomm&eacute;."</i></p>

  <p>"All right, Algy; I'll remember. But I draw the line at him kissing
  me."</p>

  <p>"I don't think that's necessary. If I was you, I'd just say with simple
  maidenly sincerity that you'll let him know when you've made up your
  mind."</p>

  <p>"I can't make out why, if he's what you say he is, he wants to marry me,"
  said the girl thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, old dear, I've seen people with worse dials than yours, you know.
  What <i>I</i> can't make out is why the devil he's asked <i>me</i> down here
  this week-end."</p>

  <p>"No; I don't see that either. Get me some more sloe gin, like a dear."</p>

  <p>"I say, Molly," remarked Algy, returning with the glass, "as chap to chap,
  do you like your mother?"</p>

  <p>"One gets used to her in time. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I don't. I think she's dreadful."</p>

  <p>"I know. So do a lot of people."</p>

  <p>"I thought she was going to burst on me while you were doing the
  herbaceous border act with Charles. I told her I'd proposed to you on the
  links."</p>

  <p>"Yes; that would cause an eruption. But why did you tell her that? I mean,
  you didn't, did you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing to speak of. Though every movement of my driver must have
  revealed my hopeless passion. You see we weren't getting on very well, and
  she'd just called me Bugworth. So I thought I'd give her a jolt in the
  corsets."</p>

  <p>The girl began to laugh.</p>

  <p>"You are a prize buffoon, Algy. But, tell me, while we've got the chance,
  what's the next move? I've done what Captain Drummond wanted, so far as Mr.
  Burton is concerned, but what now?"</p>

  <p>"His idea is, dear, that you <i>may</i> be able to find out something If
  you don't, you don't; it can't be helped. But there's a chance. And I've
  never known Hugh Drummond so serious as he is over this affair. Hullo! here's
  another arrival."</p>

  <p>From outside came the sound of wheels on the drive, and simultaneously
  Charles Burton came running down the stairs. And as the front door opened he
  reached it.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, my dear fellow," he said. "I hope you had no trouble in finding
  the way."</p>

  <p>He came in with another man, who was wearing an astrakhan coat.</p>

  <p>"Let me introduce you to Miss Castledon," he continued, "and Mr.
  Longworth...Mr. Menalin."</p>

  <p>The newcomer bowed without speaking, and allowed the butler, who had just
  appeared, to divest him of his coat. Then he turned to Burton.</p>

  <p>"Would it be convenient," he asked, "for us to have a little chat as soon
  as possible? A matter of business." He bowed again to Molly Castledon.</p>

  <p>"At once, if you like," said Burton. "Let us go to my study."</p>

  <p>They crossed the hall and disappeared, and the girl looked at Algy.</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" she said.</p>

  <p>"According to Hugh," answered Algy gravely, "the big noise who is at the
  bottom of the whole thing. I'd give a lot to be in the study at the
  moment."</p>

  <p>The girl glanced at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"You're a funny mixture, Algy," she said. "You're looking quite the
  strong, silent man."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he laughed. "Not as bad as that surely."</p>

  <p>"Tell me more about Hugh Drummond," she said after a pause. "He sounds
  rather a pet."</p>

  <p>"He's a topper," answered Algy simply. "You'd love him."</p>

  <p>"What's he look like?"</p>

  <p>"Great big chap. Ugly as be damned, and frightfully powerful. He and I and
  one or two others have always hunted together, but it's Hugh who gives the
  orders."</p>

  <p>"But what makes him suspect this Burton man?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you more than I have told you already, my angel, because I'm
  not allowed to. But you can take it from me that Charles is a nasty bit of
  work."</p>

  <p>"I hate the man; he's so dreadfully in love with himself. But I should
  never have thought he was a criminal."</p>

  <p>"Nor did anybody else until quite recently. Which is why he's so
  dangerous."</p>

  <p>"And you've got no idea what he's trying to do?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest, dear. Nor has Hugh. That's what we're trying to find
  out."</p>

  <p>"Does he know that Captain Drummond is in England?"</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, no! And he mustn't, either. What is it, Molly?"</p>

  <p>She had suddenly gripped his arm.</p>

  <p>"That window beside the front door, Algy. A man had his face pressed
  against it."</p>

  <p>He rose and crossed the hall; then, opening the door, he peered out into
  the darkness. There was no one to be seen, and after a while he came back to
  the fire.</p>

  <p>"Probably a gardener," he said reassuringly. "Or one of those
  funny-looking birds I've seen creeping about the place."</p>

  <p>"I've seen some too," she answered. "I wonder who they are."</p>

  <p>"Ask me another, my pet. Since they didn't come in to lunch, I suppose
  they're servants of sorts."</p>

  <p>Molly Castledon got up.</p>

  <p>"I don't like this house," she said. "It's very comfortable, but there's
  something about it that gives me the shivers."</p>

  <p>"You aren't leaving little Algy, are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am, my sweet. I'm going to have a bath."</p>

  <p>He watched her as she went up the stairs; then, with a slight frown, he
  helped himself to another whisky and soda. For the first time in his life he
  found himself at variance with Hugh Drummond. He did not like the part the
  girl was playing. True, Hugh would never have suggested it without good
  reason, and so far as he could see, Molly was incurring no risk. At the same
  time it went against the grain.</p>

  <p>After a while he lit a cigarette, and his thoughts turned to the other
  subject that worried him. Why had Charles Burton asked him down? The
  invitation had come quite unexpectedly the morning after he had seen
  Drummond; and had it not been for the fact that he had persuaded Molly, much
  against her will, to accept the preceding day, he would have refused. And now
  that he had arrived, he was even more surprised.</p>

  <p>He had expected a large party, similar to the one he had been to before.
  But, so far as he could make out, save for this man Menalin, the Castledons
  and he were the only guests. And since Burton was not a man who did anything
  without a reason, he asked himself what that reason could be. That his host
  had conceived a sudden and violent friendship for him he dismissed as
  improbable, to put it mildly.</p>

  <p>The sound of voices interrupted his train of thought; Burton and Menalin
  were returning to the hall. And immediately Algy's face became vacant.</p>

  <p>"All alone, Longworth," cried his host as he entered.</p>

  <p>"Deserted, dear old host, by men, women and children," he said mournfully.
  "Come and chat to me on this and that."</p>

  <p>"I tried to get that pal of yours down for the weekend," continued Burton,
  splashing some soda into a glass. "Captain Drummond. I looked him up in the
  book, and dropped him a line, but I've had no reply."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't. The old scout is in France. At least, he was the last time
  I heard from him."</p>

  <p>"Really! When did he go?"</p>

  <p>"About a week ago."</p>

  <p>"I want to get in touch with him rather badly," said Burton. "You haven't
  by any chance got his address?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I haven't. I tore up his letter. But in any event it wouldn't
  have been much use even if I'd kept it. He was just passing through, if you
  take my meaning, from hither to thither."</p>

  <p>"Did he happen to mention when he was returning to England?"</p>

  <p>"No. But he's an uncommunicative old bean, you know. Just said he couldn't
  shoot last Wednesday."</p>

  <p>"I see. Well, I'd be very much obliged, Longworth, if you'd ask him to
  ring me up when he does come back."</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I'll let him know the instant he returns. How goes the Golden
  Boot? I haven't seen you there lately."</p>

  <p>"I was in a couple of nights ago. You use it a good deal, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I've masticated quite a number of kippers there. God bless!" He
  finished his drink. "I'm for a spot of hot water."</p>

  <p>He lounged up the stairs and Burton looked at Menalin with a faint
  smile.</p>

  <p>"That, I think, settles the matter," he remarked as Algy disappeared. "The
  two are great friends, which is really why I asked that idiot down here. He,
  if anybody, would know Drummond's whereabouts. So I think we can assume that
  the gentleman is still in France. The point is&mdash;how much does he know or
  guess?</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Menalin, lighting a cigarette. "How much does he know or
  guess? One of my principal reasons for coming here was to discuss that very
  matter."</p>

  <p>"So I gathered from your letter. And as I said a moment or two ago my sole
  reason for asking Longworth here was to try and get in touch with
  Drummond."</p>

  <p>"The manoeuvre does not seem to have been very successful. However, for
  the moment we will let that pass. How much does he know? It is a matter to
  which I have given a good deal of thought, and <i>at present</i> I do not
  think we need worry. All that he can <i>know</i> is what Madame P&eacute;lain told
  him."</p>

  <p>"Which may have been a lot," said Burton uneasily.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," answered Menalin. "Had she told him anything of real
  value it would have been contained in the letter which Standish wrote to
  Talbot from Cannes. Since, however, you have observed nothing suspicious
  since the receipt of that letter, we can assume, I think, that it did not
  contain any such information."</p>

  <p>"It would have been well if you could have got that letter."</p>

  <p>"Had it been possible we would have. But Standish registered it himself at
  the main post office."</p>

  <p>"And where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"He was caught as I informed you at Evian, and taken back to Cannes. And
  when the police had finished with him I intervened. You need not trouble
  about Standish: he is safely under lock and key."</p>

  <p>"I'd far sooner he was dead."</p>

  <p>"Possibly. But we do not all of us possess your method, my dear Burton, of
  causing&mdash;er&mdash;natural death. And murder always excites the
  police."</p>

  <p>"You got Gasdon in Paris?"</p>

  <p>"He was picked up as he came in by the Porte d'Italie driving Drummond's
  car. He is still in hospital with a bad knife-wound."</p>

  <p>"So only Drummond remains."</p>

  <p>"As you say&mdash;only Drummond remains. And that, Burton, is a state of
  affairs that has got to be rectified as soon as possible. That man is
  dangerous."</p>

  <p>"But if he knows nothing..."</p>

  <p>"I said that I don't think he knows anything of importance <i>at
  present.</i> But if I'm any judge of human nature, that will merely spur him
  on to greater activity. Drummond, my friend, must go."</p>

  <p>"Once I can lay my hands on him he will trouble us no more."</p>

  <p>"Ah I&mdash;once you can. He has, I take it, no reason to suspect
  you?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever. No one has. It was a nuisance that I had to give my name
  going up in the boat-train, but it couldn't be avoided."</p>

  <p>"And how goes this new venture of yours&mdash;the night club?"</p>

  <p>"Hardly a venture, Menalin. The Golden Boot is a blind. The fact that it's
  a paying blind is all to the good, but I should keep it going even if it
  wasn't. Like the parties I throw; and this house. Also, in a different way,
  like my marriage to that girl you met. They all help to keep my real
  activities out of the limelight."</p>

  <p>"I see the idea. Dorina told me that for an English night club yours was
  much better than the usual abomination."</p>

  <p>"I think she enjoyed herself. Funnily enough that was the last time I saw
  Drummond."</p>

  <p>Menalin stared at him.</p>

  <p>"What's that you say? Was Drummond at the Golden Boot the night you took
  Dorina there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. What of it?"</p>

  <p>"And he saw her?"</p>

  <p>"Of course he did. Why shouldn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Because she was with me in the bar of the Negresco on the occasion that I
  saw him."</p>

  <p>"But why the devil," said Burton, "did Donna go into the bar if Drummond
  was there?"</p>

  <p>"Because she didn't know him from Adam. How could she? He was never
  introduced to her at the Golden Boot. He was merely one man in a crowded
  night club. What was there to make her notice him? You never drew her
  attention to him."</p>

  <p>"That's true. I didn't know anything about him then."</p>

  <p>Burton began to pace up and down the hall.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he didn't recognise her," he said at length.</p>

  <p>"Not recognise Dorina! Don't be a damned fool. No one could fail to
  recognise her. It didn't matter if Madame P&eacute;lain realised that Dorina was the
  woman who had been at Chez Paquay that day, so long as she was only seen with
  me. But that Drummond should have seen her with <i>you,</i> is awkward."</p>

  <p>"Was the P&eacute;lain woman with Drummond at the time?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Then it is possible that Drummond does not know that Dorina was at Chez
  Paquay. You see what I'm getting at. Dorina as a link between you and me I
  don't mind; Dorina as a link between Latimer and me would be infernally
  dangerous."</p>

  <p>Menalin shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I fear it is a possibility that you've got to consider," he remarked
  shortly.</p>

  <p>The two men stared at one another.</p>

  <p>"Moreover," continued Menalin, "should it prove to be so, your pleasant
  conceit that you resemble Caesar's wife rather goes by the board. You'd
  better get Drummond, Burton, dead or alive. And now I think I shall follow
  that young man's example and go and have a bath."</p>

  <p>"I will show you your room," said his host, leading the way up the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>And once again, pressed against the window beside the front door, there
  appeared for a second the face of a man.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X. &mdash; LIMERICK BY ALGY</a></h2>&gt;

  <p>It cannot be said that the evening was a success. Some ten people from the
  neighbourhood came in for dinner, but though Charles Burton's chef was as
  famous as his cellar, conversation flagged. And the fault lay in the host
  himself.</p>

  <p>This sudden disclosure on the part of Menalin had upset him more than he
  cared to admit It had transported him from a mood of absolute confidence and
  security into one of doubt and uneasiness. He had returned to the subject in
  Menalin's room, and though the Russian had told him that he was almost sure
  Madame P&eacute;lain had <i>not</i> seen Dorina in the Negresco there was an element
  of uncertainty about the matter which worried him.</p>

  <p>At the time he had been doubtful as to the wisdom of taking such a
  singularly striking woman to the Golden Boot. But she was a lady who
  possessed a very decided will of her own, and when she expressed a wish to go
  there he had agreed. And the fact that Drummond should have selected that
  particular night to go there himself, was one of those chances which no one
  could legislate for.</p>

  <p>Then a further disquieting thought occurred to his mind&mdash;one, which
  oddly enough had not struck him before. Was it chance that had taken Drummond
  that night? The interview with Talbot must have taken place <i>before</i> he
  arrived at the Golden Boot. Was it possible that some deeper motive had
  caused his presence at the night club? If so, it meant that Talbot had
  suspected him then.</p>

  <p>He ran over the chain of events from Latimer's arrival in Paris to his
  death on board. From the moment he had left the Gare de Lyon he had never
  been out of observation. He had put through a call to London, but it had been
  so short that it was out of the question that anything really incriminating
  could have been mentioned. And that was confirmed by the fact that nothing
  had subsequently happened. For although there was no mention of him by name
  on the papers in Latimer's possession there was a very vital clue to his
  present activities. And had that come out Charles Burton would have known
  about it at once; the police would have been buzzing like a hive of bees.</p>

  <p>The same thing applied to the letter which, so Menalin told him, Standish
  had written to Talbot from Cannes. Though it was most improbable that a man
  like Latimer could have passed on valuable information to a woman he had only
  known a fortnight, it was possible. In which case Madame P&eacute;lain would have
  passed it on to Standish, and it would have been in the letter&mdash;a letter
  which, though Talbot himself never received it, must have been opened by
  somebody else. In short, he was convinced that the contents of the papers had
  not been passed on; Latimer's death had ensured that.</p>

  <p>Once more his thoughts reverted to Drummond's presence at the Golden Boot.
  And with growing irritation he realised all that it might entail if Drummond
  with the help of Madame P&eacute;lain, had realised that the woman of Chez Paquay
  was the woman who had been with him that night. True, there could be no
  question of proof; Latimer had died of natural causes. They could exhume him
  till they were black in the face; they would find no trace of anything. But
  they might suspect, and he did not want suspicion. No one desired to blush
  unseen for the next few weeks more fervently than did Charles Burton.</p>

  <p>An abstemious man as a rule, to-night he was drinking more than usual. And
  after a while the champagne began to take effect. He was worrying
  unnecessarily; what could Drummond do anyway? The instant he showed up in
  England he was a doomed man; if he was still in France the police were bound
  to get him sooner or later and then Menalin would do the rest.</p>

  <p>A sudden sentence caught his ear; they were discussing the murder of
  Colonel Talbot.</p>

  <p>"A dastardly outrage," cried a retired general. "I've known Harry Talbot
  since we were subalterns together. Member of my club. And that he should have
  been murdered in cold blood in broad daylight in the middle of the Park
  reveals a scandalous state of affairs. You might expect it with gangsters in
  America, but that it should happen in London is simply unbelievable."</p>

  <p>For the fraction of a second he caught Menalin's eye; that, too, had been
  a well-planned bit of work. And even if he had not been fortified by his own
  excellent champagne, he knew that no shadow of suspicion could attach to him
  over that. The orders had passed through too many channels for him ever to be
  traced.</p>

  <p>And it had been necessary&mdash;or, at any rate, expedient. Talbot had
  been far too clever and able a man to leave alive. But for Latimer he might
  have risked it; as things stood, it had been impossible. And so...</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon."</p>

  <p>He suddenly became aware that his prospective father-in-law was in vocal
  labour.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of the state of affairs, Burton? You're one of these
  international financial fellahs. Any chance of another war?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps my friend, Mr. Menalin, is better informed than I am, Sir
  George," he murmured.</p>

  <p>With an effort the worthy baronet shifted his focus. "Of course, of
  course," he grunted. "Well, sir&mdash;what do <i>you</i> think?"</p>

  <p>"It is an interesting field of thought," answered Menalin. "So much
  depends on the <i>chef."</i></p>

  <p>"The <i>chef</i>!" spluttered Sir George. "'Fraid I don't quite get
  you."</p>

  <p>"Liver, my dear sir; liver. Have you never realised the appalling danger
  of a dictator with too much bile?"</p>

  <p>"Deuced good. 'Pon my soul&mdash;that's deuced clever. Must get that off
  at the club."</p>

  <p>"Where the members will be greatly edified, no doubt," said Menalin with a
  smile. "Seriously though, has it never occurred to you, that the ordinary
  factors which used to govern international relations are quite dead to-day?
  War used to creak into being; next time it will flash. Hence the danger of a
  bad egg at a crucial moment. And now most moments are crucial."</p>

  <p>"Horrible," shuddered Algy. "You make me go all goosey. Me for the bottom
  of a disused well."</p>

  <p>"It would be hard to think of a more suitable place for you, Mr.
  Longworth," remarked Lady Castledon acidly.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, mother," cried Molly Castledon, "he got a bar to his Military
  Cross. Don't look sheeplike, Algy; I know you did. What did you get it
  for?"</p>

  <p>"Saving the rum at divisional headquarters, darling. But joking apart, Mr.
  Menalin, do you really think we're going to get all hot and bothered
  again?"</p>

  <p>"I am not a prophet, Mr. Longworth. All I say is that when supreme power
  over a nation is vested in one man the situation is dangerous. And you must
  admit that your country has not gone out of its way to ease it. Actuated
  doubtless by the highest motives you have, as your first contribution,
  successfully turned an old friend into a bitter enemy without achieving the
  slightest result..."</p>

  <p>"A moral one surely," remarked the vicar.</p>

  <p>"Assuredly," agreed Menalin with a smile. "But hardly in the way you
  think. Had you closed the Suez Canal you would, at any rate, have done
  something, even if it was only to start a European war. But doing what you
  did do in the sacred name of justice produced, if I may say so, one of the
  most Gilbertian situations of recent centuries. That is why I said that the
  moral result was hardly what you intended. The benefit was entirely to
  Italy."</p>

  <p>"Don't hold with sanctions," grunted the general. "Damn foolishness. For
  all that I don't quite follow you, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Menalin."</p>

  <p>"And yet, General, it is very simple. At the beginning the Abyssinian war
  was intensely unpopular in Italy, except among a minority of hot-headed boys.
  And then the League applied sanctions. Immediately the war became a
  crusade&mdash;not against the Abyssinians, but against what the Italians
  considered injustice. The entire country closed up; every dissentient voice
  was stilled. A united nation with a common ideal came into being as a result
  of your action. And the fact that it was the unfortunate Ethiopians who were
  left to carry the baby was, of course, nobody's business."</p>

  <p>"Rather a novel way of looking at it," remarked Sir George,</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, I should have thought it was obvious. True, I know Italy
  better, perhaps, than most of you here, but even without that knowledge it is
  difficult to see how anyone could have expected a different result. You may
  take it from me that the powers that be in that country mention you with
  gratitude in their prayers every night. To keep up appearances they have to
  pretend you are the villain in the piece, and the <i>hoi polloi</i> believe
  it. But in reality you have saved them at what one must admit was a trifling
  cost. You only ruined two or three of your own fishing centres, and caused a
  coal mine or two in Wales to close down. In fact, I don't suppose helping
  Italy to win the war has cost you more than six or seven millions."</p>

  <p>"Do you suggest that we should have stood aside and done nothing?"
  demanded the vicar.</p>

  <p>"I fear, sir," said Menalin, "that I am a practical man. Until this world
  becomes Utopia, judgment goes by results. And when I see a policy pursued,
  from no matter what exalted motives, that produces the result your policy did
  I can only sit back and thank Heaven that the balance sheets of my companies
  are compiled by business men. Would you excuse me, Burton?"</p>

  <p>A footman was standing beside him with a telegram on a salver.</p>

  <p>"The worst of being one of those unfortunate individuals&mdash;business
  men," he murmured to the woman on his right as he opened the envelope. And as
  he read the contents two pairs of eyes were unobtrusively fastened on him.
  One pair belonged to his host; the other to a guest who wore an eyeglass. And
  it seemed to Algy that for the fraction of a second, Menalin's face
  registered uneasiness. However, as he thrust the wire in his pocket and
  turned to his neighbour his expression was as impassive as ever.</p>

  <p>To Algy the entire party was becoming like a dream. Numbed by the two
  women he was sitting between, and who mercifully were discussing county
  affairs with their other partners, he felt a curious sense of detachment.
  Here, seated round Burton's table, was gathered a group of people who, save
  for a difference in clothes, might have been sitting there fifty years ago.
  To them England was England&mdash;a thing as constant as the sun itself. That
  anything serious could really happen to their country literally never entered
  their heads. Other nations might bicker and fight, have revolutions, don
  different-coloured shirts&mdash;but not England. The whole thing was rather
  vulgar and ridiculous.</p>

  <p>And since Algy was born and bred in the same caste himself he understood
  their point of view. Understood, too, the veiled hostility engendered in all
  of them by Menalin's remarks. For whatever criticisms they might feel
  disposed to make on their country's actions themselves, it was a totally
  different matter for a foreigner. Any disparagement from an outsider was
  sufficient to unite the most rabid enemies against the common foe.</p>

  <p>He stole a glance at Menalin, who was apparently engrossed in conversation
  with the general's wife. Was it possible that behind that inscrutable mask
  some amazing plot was being hatched that threatened the very foundations of
  their life, so far as the rest of the party was concerned? It seemed
  fantastic, and yet Hugh Drummond was not in the habit of making fantastic
  statements.</p>

  <p>"Sweet, sir?"</p>

  <p>He looked up; a footman was offering him a dish&mdash;a footman who stared
  him straight in the face and then gave the barest perceptible wink.</p>

  <p>"Your napkin is on the floor, sir," murmured the man and passed on.</p>

  <p>It was a prophecy, if not a fact. A moment later it was on the floor,
  covering a twisted scrap of paper; two moments later the napkin was restored
  to its proper position and the floor was bare.</p>

  <p>Not in vain had been Drummond's teaching; Algy's face, as he unrolled the
  message under cover of the table, was more asinine than usual. But no one had
  noticed anything; conversation was still general.</p>

  <p>He straightened out the note, and glancing down he recognised the writing
  with a sudden thrill.</p>

  <blockquote style="font-style:italic">
    "Mention island of Varda. Get reactions B. and M.&mdash;HUD."
  </blockquote>

  <p>So ran the note; concise and to the point. But, Algy reflected, as he put
  it in his pocket, not the easiest order ever. A: he had never heard of the
  darned place. B: suddenly to interject a remark about Varda in the middle of
  a description of last Tuesday's hunt might cause aspersions to be cast on his
  sanity. However, it had to be done, and that was that. So Algy came out of
  his stupor, and gave his celebrated imitation of a horse neighing.</p>

  <p>In his usual haunts it was a certain winner; on this occasion the effect
  was electrical. A dead silence settled on the room and everyone stared at
  him.</p>

  <p>"Molly, my angel," he burbled, "I've got it."</p>

  <p>"Got what, you fathead?"</p>

  <p>"The last line of that limerick, darling. The one we were trying before
  dinner. Not your sort, Lady Castledon. This one is quite proper. And one gets
  a guinea for the best effort. Hence my recent silence; my brain had been in
  action."</p>

  <p>He beamed genially on the company.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "There was a young lady called Mahda<br>
    Who had hidden her stays in the lahda<br>
    When asked to explain<br>
    She said it might rain&mdash;
  </blockquote>

  <p>"Now here's my effort:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "I'm going back to the island of Vahda.
  </blockquote>

  <p>"Pretty hot that&mdash;what? I suppose," he added anxiously, "there
  <i>is</i> an island called Vahda."</p>

  <p>"Have you been drinking too much, Mr. Longworth?" remarked Lady Castledon
  ominously.</p>

  <p>"Of course. I always do. But I haven't reached the Plimsoll line yet. You
  know&mdash;half-way up the tonsils. Well, people, what do you think of
  it?"</p>

  <p>He gazed round hopefully.</p>

  <p>"No bon! No guinea! Tum-tum-ti-ti-tum-ti-ti-tum-tum. I think it's dashed
  good myself. Witty; cryptic; neat. What say you, old host?"</p>

  <p>"I had no idea you were so accomplished, Mr. Longworth," said Burton
  suavely. "I should think it will certainly win the prize."</p>

  <p>"There you are, Molly, my dear," remarked Algy complacently. "You can put
  your shirt on little Algy every time."</p>

  <p>"And in what paper is that interesting competition?" asked Burton.</p>

  <p>"Not one that you're ever likely to see, Charles," said Molly calmly. "A
  fashion paper, my poor dear, which gives you patterns for garments no nice
  girl ever mentions. Personally, Algy, I think it's a rotten line."</p>

  <p>"Take it or leave it, my child," said Algy airily. "Possibly it wants a
  bit of polishing, but the basic idea is good. Don't you agree?"</p>

  <p>He turned to his dinner partner who was regarding him dispassionately
  through lorgnettes.</p>

  <p>"Are you by any chance mental?" she asked with interest.</p>

  <p>"Only at high tide; then I bark like a dog. My grandmother was the same,
  only she carried it further and bit people in the leg, until she had finally
  to go about on a lead, poor old soul."</p>

  <p>"It seems a great pity that you don't follow your grandmother's example,"
  she remarked acidly.</p>

  <p>With relief he contemplated a bony shoulder blade; evidently the only
  reaction felt by the guests was that he was half-witted. But what about
  Menalin and his host? Had he been <i>too</i> damned stupid?</p>

  <p>That he had succeeded beyond his wildest expectations was beside the
  point. The reaction of the two men had stuck out a yard, though it had passed
  in a flash. Menalin had stiffened like a pointer marking a bird, only to
  relax instantly; Burton had given an unmistakable start. So he had carried
  out Drummond's order all right. But did they suspect him?</p>

  <p>Another thing; where was Drummond? Presumably somewhere in the
  neighbourhood since he had got a note through to the footman. And who was the
  footman?</p>

  <p>Algy glanced at him; he had never seen the man before in his life. But
  that he was in the show on their side was obvious. And presumably it would
  have to be through him that he'd get the answer back to Drummond. Which might
  be difficult unless he was the footman who was valeting him.</p>

  <p>His clothes had been laid out that evening when he went up to dress, so he
  didn't know who was looking after him. And he would not know, in all
  probability until the following morning when he was called.</p>

  <p>Came a sudden pushing back of chairs and the ladies rose to leave the
  room. For a second he caught Molly's eye; what a girl! How marvellously she
  had played up, with her yarn about a fashion paper! And then the door closed
  and the men were left alone.</p>

  <p>It came as no surprise to him when Menalin rose and, coming round the
  table, took the next chair.</p>

  <p>"Do you often indulge in these poetical flights, Mr. Longworth?" he asked
  with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Rather," cried Algy. "Must do something, don't you know, to keep the old
  grey matter up to scratch."</p>

  <p>He was conscious that the other man was watching him like a lynx, but in
  his own particular line Algy was unbeatable. No man living could look such a
  completely congenital idiot at will.</p>

  <p>"Quite," murmured Menalin. "A very praiseworthy idea. But tell me, Mr.
  Longworth&mdash;I ask out of idle curiosity&mdash;why did you select the
  letter V? You might have had Garda, or Sarda, or Tarda, which would all have
  rhymed equally brilliantly. Why Varda?"</p>

  <p>"'Pon my soul," cried Algy. "I never thought of that."</p>

  <p>He gazed at Menalin with rising excitement.</p>

  <p>"I believe Garda is better. Much better. You see, you get a play on the
  words. By Jove! you're a genius&mdash;a blinking marvel. In the second line
  there's that snappy bit about her stays in the lahda. You remember that!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, thank you," said Menalin.</p>

  <p>"Well now, that's where your notion hits the roof. Garda sounds very like
  garta. So you've got stays and garter. Gad! I must remember that. If that
  doesn't knock 'em for the count, nothing will. I say," he asked anxiously,
  "you haven't any objection to my using your idea, have you?"</p>

  <p>"Not the smallest," Menalin assured him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I call it deuced sporting of you," said Algy with feeling. "I don't
  mind telling you that there are mighty few fellahs who wouldn't insist on
  fifty-fifty. But I tell you what I will do though. I mean fair play's a jewel
  and all that sort of bilge. Now have you heard the story of the charwoman who
  had tripe for dinner I say, don't go, old friend. That story is an absolute
  wow."</p>

  <p>"I'll take your word for it, Mr. Longworth," said Menalin grimly. "At the
  moment I fear it might prove too much for me."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," murmured Algy resignedly, as he watched Menalin take a
  vacant chair by his host, "this doesn't seem to be Algy's night out."</p>

  <p>"What did you say?" grunted the man on his other side.</p>

  <p>"An airy nothing," answered Algy, "tossed into the port-laden atmosphere.
  I say, what do you think would happen if we started to flick bread pellets at
  the General?"</p>

  <p>"Bread pellets at the General! Good Gad I sir&mdash;are you mad? Are you
  aware that his coverts march with mine."</p>

  <p>With an effort Algy controlled his face; he was beginning to enjoy
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Where to?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"How d'you mean&mdash;where to?"</p>

  <p>"Where do they march to? And do they have a band?"</p>

  <p>His neighbour swallowed twice.</p>

  <p>"Coverts, sir, are woods. And the phrase 'march' means that his land
  adjoins mine."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I see," said Algy. "My father has a wood on his land...Near
  Wigan..."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Does he preserve? Birds, I mean&mdash;not jam."</p>

  <p>"Rather...I shot some starlings there the other day...And a fox...We've
  got its tail hanging up in the downstairs lavatory."</p>

  <p>For a space there was silence, broken only by the sound of heavy breathing
  Then:</p>

  <p>"You shot a fox! Tail! By God sir, where were you dragged up?"</p>

  <p>"It was a lady fox, too," said Algy hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Lady fox! Lady fox! By Heavens, sir, you ought to be in prison."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, John?" called out the General. "You seem excited."</p>

  <p>"Excited, Henry&mdash;excited! So would you be. Are you aware that
  this&mdash;this gentleman has just told me that he shot a vixen&mdash;I beg
  his pardon, a lady fox&mdash;the other day and that her tail&mdash;her tail,
  mark you&mdash;is hanging in the downstairs lavatory."</p>

  <p>The General took it in slowly.</p>

  <p>"Deuced bad form, my dear John," he remarked at length, "deuced bad. But
  these boys know no better. Gad, young man, it's a good thing for you that you
  weren't in Poona in 'eighty-three. Or was it 'eighty-four? Old Shirty
  Ramsbotham would have put the wind up you. Damn' good fellow&mdash;Shirty,"
  he added reminiscently. "Used to eat wineglasses after mess."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked Algy brightly.</p>

  <p>"Why!" The General glared at him. "Confound you, sir; what d'you
  mean&mdash;why? Just to show you that he could, of course...Why!"</p>

  <p>He subsided into a heavy rumble of disgust, and Algy viewed him with
  alarm.</p>

  <p>"Have I said the wrong thing?" he murmured to his neighbour.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever said the right?" answered that worthy witheringly, and at
  that moment Burton rose.</p>

  <p>"Shall we join the ladies?" he remarked to the room at large. "Hope you
  found the port to your liking, General."</p>

  <p>"Very good, Burton. Excellent. Wish I could say the same of your guests,"
  he added darkly.</p>

  <p>The disgruntled warrior hoisted himself to his feet, and moved towards the
  door.</p>

  <p>"We'll have our coffee and brandy in the hall," continued Burton.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that Algy caught the footman's eye. He had suddenly
  appeared, and was standing in such a position that Algy would have to pass
  close to him. And as he got abreast of him, having lagged a little behind the
  others, he heard a whisper; "Your room; ten-thirty."</p>

  <p>Algy glanced at the clock; just a quarter-past ten. Presumably the zoo
  would break up about eleven; until then would it be safe to talk to Molly?
  Must keep up the fiction about the limerick, of course, but they'd better not
  seem too matey...Just in case...</p>

  <p>She was sitting by herself near the fireplace and he strolled over to
  her.</p>

  <p>"Grand idea, my pet, about the limerick," he announced. "Straight from the
  horse's mouth. Not Varda, but Garda."</p>

  <p>He was conscious that Burton was watching them.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Menalin's own," he continued. "You see the great notion.
  Garda&mdash;garter. Pretty hot&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"You complete idiot," she laughed. And then without altering her voice:
  "What on earth is the game? Careful, Algy."</p>

  <p>"Send it up to-morrow," he said. "Right-ho, my dear. Don't worry."</p>

  <p>"What would be a good thing to do?" remarked Burton as he joined them.
  "Invent more limericks? It seems to be Longworth's strong point."</p>

  <p>A burst of laughter came from the other side of the hall, and the words
  "lady fox" and "tail" floated across.</p>

  <p>"You're entertaining a real sportsman unawares, Burton," said Algy's
  dinner neighbour coming over. "He tells us he's just shot a lady fox in his
  father's wood and hung the tail in the&mdash;er&mdash;hung it
  downstairs."</p>

  <p>For a moment there was silence, while Burton stared at Algy through
  narrowed eyes.</p>

  <p>"Really," he remarked softly. "Now I wonder why you said that,
  Longworth."</p>

  <p>Inwardly Algy was cursing; he had been a fool to go so far. Actually he
  had completely forgotten that Burton hunted in the shires himself. But his
  face remained its usual vacant self.</p>

  <p>"Bit of a leg-pull, old host," he burbled genially. "Wanted to see if
  anyone would have apoplexy. And this sportsman damn near did."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" The harbinger of <i>bon mots</i> had got even redder
  in the face.</p>

  <p>"Merely, my dear Livermore," said Burton quietly, "that it seems a
  peculiar pastime for a man who hunts with the Pytchley."</p>

  <p>He turned away, leaving Mr. Livermore gasping like a fish.</p>

  <p>"Deuced good!" he said at length. "You had me that time,
  Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Longworth," remarked Algy politely. "Algernon to my friends."</p>

  <p>He took out his cigarette case from which he had taken the precaution to
  remove the cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"Dash!" he murmured. "Must go up to my room. No, thank you, Mr. Livermore;
  I only smoke my own poison."</p>

  <p>He crossed the hall, and began to mount the stairs. Burton and Menalin
  were both engaged in conversation with different people, and there was no one
  in sight as he opened the door of his room. The footman was laying out his
  pyjamas.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" said Algy quickly.</p>

  <p>"Talbot. It was my father they murdered. I got special leave and shaved my
  moustache."</p>

  <p>Algy whistled.</p>

  <p>"How the devil did you get in here?"</p>

  <p>"Drummond fixed it. By God! that man would fix anything. Burton was
  advertising for another footman, and Drummond arranged it somehow."</p>

  <p>"Where is the old scout?"</p>

  <p>"Don't know. But he's somewhere about. Saw him this evening. Listen for
  you mustn't be too long. First, I was to tell you that Standish has
  escaped."</p>

  <p>Once again Algy whistled.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if that's the wire Menalin got at dinner. It shook
  him&mdash;that message."</p>

  <p>"It may have been. Second, this Varda business. Incidentally I darned near
  dropped the whole outfit with laughing over that limerick. What's your
  report?</p>

  <p>"They both definitely reacted," said Algy.</p>

  <p>"I agree. Quite definitely."</p>

  <p>"Where is the blasted place? I've never even heard of it."</p>

  <p>"No more have I. For that matter no more had Drummond when he gave me that
  note to give you. But you're to insert an advertisement in the <i>Morning
  Post</i> as to the reaction."</p>

  <p>"Can't get it in till Tuesday's issue," said Algy. "However, that's
  O.K."</p>

  <p>"Third. You're to go to the Golden Boot on Monday night, and see one Alice
  Blackton."</p>

  <p>"Right. Anything more&mdash;for I must go downstairs again?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that's the lot."</p>

  <p>"And you don't know where Hugh is? Drummond, I mean."</p>

  <p>Talbot shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My hat What a man!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"You're telling me," said Algy. "By the way what's your name here?"</p>

  <p>"Simpson. Henry Simpson."</p>

  <p>"Are you looking after me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"A new job for you, Henry," grinned Algy. "And I don't mind warning you,
  old lad, that you won't get fat on your tip."</p>

  <p>He crammed some cigarettes into his case and sauntered out of the room.
  The passage was still deserted; no one appeared to have moved in the hall. In
  fact his absence seemed to have passed unnoticed. And a few minutes later, to
  his intense relief, signs of a general departure began to manifest
  themselves.</p>

  <p>"Don't overdo the village idiot stuff," came a low voice in his ear. "I
  don't think dear Charles is amused."</p>

  <p>Molly Castledon drifted on past him, but he had got her warning. And she
  was right; he knew that. Neither Burton nor Menalin were gentlemen with whom
  to run unnecessary risks. And he had no desire to share Latimer's and
  Talbot's fate.</p>

  <p>Not that anything was likely to happen to him in that house; Burton would
  hardly dare to do anything actually on his own property. But the week-end
  would not last for ever, and after that it would be a very different
  matter.</p>

  <p>The last guests had gone as he crossed to the drinks table and helped
  himself to a whisky and soda. Molly had disappeared, and so had Burton.
  Menalin had been buttonholed by Sir George, and was regarding him with
  intense disfavour. So that an imperative summons from an armchair near the
  fire came as no surprise.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Longworth," boomed Lady Castledon, "come here. I wish to speak to
  you. I have noticed," continued the voice as he approached the presence,
  "with great disapproval, your habit of addressing my daughter by such titles
  as 'darling' and 'angel.' In public too. To-night, for instance, at dinner,
  when you produced that idiotic and vulgar limerick&mdash;was a case in point.
  Kindly understand that it must cease at once."</p>

  <p>"It will break her virginal heart," said Algy sorrowfully. "So is it fair?
  Is it just? Has she done anything to deserve such cruel punishment? I
  beg&mdash;nay, I implore you&mdash;as her mother, not to let the poor child
  think that she has incurred my displeasure. If she puts her head in a gas
  oven it will be your fault."</p>

  <p>Lady Castledon rose majestically.</p>

  <p>"George," she remarked, "I am going to bed. I will leave you to deal with
  this case of arrested mental development."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, my love, certainly."</p>

  <p>"And remember what I said, Mr. Longworth. Good night, Mr. Menalin."</p>

  <p>The Russian bowed, and at that moment Molly came in from the
  billiard-room. Her face was slightly flushed and there was an ominous glint
  in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Going to bed, mother? I think I'll come too. Night-night, Algy."</p>

  <p>"Too-te-loo, scab face. Mind you wash under the ears."</p>

  <p>"What did you call me?" demanded the girl, pausing at the foot of the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"Mother's orders, my pet. She doesn't like me calling you 'darling.'"</p>

  <p>He was looking at her closely; something had evidently upset her.</p>

  <p>"Now pop up and lower your Glaxo like a good girl," he continued. "And
  then Algy will come and kiss you good night."</p>

  <p>And even as he spoke there came from some way off, though perfectly clear
  and distinct, a sudden cry of "Help."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI. &mdash; THE SLEEPWALKER</a></h2>

  <p>For a moment there was silence. Lady Castledon had disappeared, and Molly,
  one hand on the banisters, stood staring at Algy.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" cried Sir George. "Sounded like someone shouting."</p>

  <p>"It did," agreed Menalin. "I wonder where our host is."</p>

  <p>Not a muscle in his face had moved; hearing calls for help might have been
  part of his daily routine.</p>

  <p>"We must renew our discussion to-morrow, Sir George," he continued,
  lighting a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but oughtn't we to do something about that shout?" said the baronet
  uneasily.</p>

  <p>"I feel sure that Burton...Ah! here he is. What's the trouble, Charles? We
  heard a cry a few moments ago."</p>

  <p>"Please don't be alarmed," said Burton. "No damage done. One of the men
  who looks after the electric-light plant got his hand jammed. But no bones
  broken, I'm glad to say."</p>

  <p>"That's good," cried Sir George. "Well, I think I'm going to bed. Good
  night, my dear fellow; good Right. Are you coming, Molly?"</p>

  <p>He went up the stairs with his daughter, whilst Algy crossed to the drinks
  and helped himself to another whisky. That Burton was lying he felt
  convinced; you don't get your hand jammed in an engine and have no damage
  done. So who was it who had shouted, and why?</p>

  <p>"Do you hit the old golf ball, Mr. Menalin?" he asked casually, as he
  resumed his position by the fire.</p>

  <p>"I fear I do not," said the Russian.</p>

  <p>"A pity. Darned good links those, Burton. Absolutely first-class. We might
  have a round to-morrow if you feel like it."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I shall be too busy, Longworth. But doubtless you'll be able
  to fix up a game."</p>

  <p>"I'll have a dip at it," he answered. "Perhaps Molly would care for a
  return."</p>

  <p>The two men were standing, one on each side of him, and in spite of
  himself he found that his pulse was going a little quicker. Not that they
  could do anything to him&mdash;such an idea was absurd. But with his
  knowledge of what Drummond had told him, he rather wished they were not quite
  so adjacent.</p>

  <p>"Longworth," said Burton abruptly, "both Mr. Menalin and I are a little
  worried over what I am sure is a small thing. That limerick of yours. Now
  what was it that made you think of the island of Varda?"</p>

  <p>Algy stared at him blankly.</p>

  <p>"It rhymed, old host; that's all. And now we're not using it; it's Garda,
  thanks to Mr. Menalin. But anyway, why should you be worried? I mean, is
  there anything particularly fruity over the island of Varda, wherever it
  is?"</p>

  <p>"Only this. Very few people know of its existence, and we discovered it
  quite by accident when cruising in Mr. Menalin's yacht. We were immediately
  struck by its immense possibilities as a health resort&mdash;it's a second
  Madeira. And amongst some other activities we are floating a company for its
  development. Which brings me to the point. As you will naturally understand,
  the fewer people who know about it, with matters in their present stage, the
  better. And what we feared was that you might have heard the scheme being
  discussed owing to some leakage, and that that had put the name into your
  head."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, no!" cried Algy. "Never heard of the bally place in my life.
  Rest easy in your beds, my jolly old financial magnates. Your secret is
  locked in my bosom. All I ask is that the bridal suite should be reserved for
  me when you open."</p>

  <p>He yawned cavernously, and put down his glass.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I'm for bed. And to-morrow, refreshed and invigorated by a
  night of dreamless sleep, we will all dance a merry roundelay in the garden
  before breakfast."</p>

  <p>He strolled up the stairs and paused at the top.</p>

  <p>"I must warn you of one thing, chaps; I sing in my bath."</p>

  <p>He disappeared, and the two men stared at one another.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Menalin thoughtfully, "that he really is not quite all
  there. Though why," he continued irritably, "you should have asked any of
  these unbelievable individuals at all passes my comprehension. The girl's the
  only possible one and it struck me that you weren't getting on quite as well
  as might be expected in that quarter."</p>

  <p>Burton flushed at the sneer, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>"What actually was that shout?" continued Menalin.</p>

  <p>"He'd slipped his gag somehow and got in one cry before they stopped
  him."</p>

  <p>"I see. Well, my friend, this is disquieting news about Standish."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't reflect too well on your staff work out there," said Burton,
  getting some of his own back. "Have you heard how it happened?"</p>

  <p>"Only the bare detail that he has escaped. Do not worry; he will not get
  far. And even if he does he knows nothing. I am much more concerned about
  Drummond. I have heard something new, Burton, which I have had no chance to
  pass on to you as yet. Tosco was in my room before dinner and told me."</p>

  <p>"I didn't even know he'd arrived," said Burton. "What is this news?"</p>

  <p>"It concerns the murder of Maier in Territet," went on Menalin.
  "Apparently Tosco managed to get into communication with our agents who, as
  you know, were arrested. And from them he got a description of the two men
  who were in the house when they returned. It appears that they were both
  English, and that one of them was a big, strong man who was remarkably ugly.
  It was he who knocked out Number ten as if he'd been pole-axed."</p>

  <p>"You mean it might have been Drummond."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. We know that Standish was making for the Lake of Geneva; isn't
  it more than likely that Drummond did the same? And that Drummond got into
  Switzerland whilst Standish didn't?"</p>

  <p>Burton nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"In which case any chance of catching Drummond in France may be
  eliminated. He would naturally return to England via Germany and
  Holland."</p>

  <p>"That is so," agreed Burton.</p>

  <p>"Moreover, he will have brought with him Maier's model, which as you know
  was missing."</p>

  <p>"Why should he?" demanded Burton. "For that matter why should he go to
  Maier's house at all?"</p>

  <p>"On the face of it&mdash;quite true. And I don't say for a moment that it
  <i>was</i> Drummond. But <i>if</i> it was the affair is disquieting. Not so
  much that Maier is dead, and the model missing, but because it reveals a
  knowledge of certain parts of our organisation which I had not suspected the
  other side possessed. Who put them on to Maier in the first place?"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that little rat of a barber overheard anything and passed it
  on to Talbot?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly. I cannot say. But the bald fact remains, Burton, that <i>if</i>
  it was Drummond, it shows there is a leakage somewhere. Fortunately that
  leakage can only be on the fringe of our scheme, but one never knows when one
  thing may not lead to another. And whatever you may say about the English,
  you cannot deny that their Special Service men are second to none, and that
  once they've got on to a thing they never let go."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is necessary to remove our friend below?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. He has suddenly developed scruples, and he knows too much.
  God! I wish I'd got Drummond down there as well."</p>

  <p>Menalin laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you haven't. And from what little I've seen of the gentleman,
  I don't think you're likely to. Shall we adjourn? There is a lot to be
  discussed, and I am anxious to see this method of yours in action."</p>

  <p>They crossed the hall towards Burton's study, and Algy who had been lying
  with his ear glued to the banisters on the first floor landing, rose and
  dusted his trousers. Except for an acute attack of cramp he had gained
  nothing. One or two odd words here and there were all that he had heard, and
  they had been of no help.</p>

  <p>The house was very silent as he walked to his room. From the further end
  of the corridor a faint roaring noise proclaimed that Sir George had given up
  the labours of the day; a suddenly extinguished light under the door of the
  adjacent room indicated that his wife was about to imitate him.</p>

  <p>A fire was burning brightly in the grate, and throwing himself into an
  easy chair he lit a cigarette. He had half hoped to find some message from
  Talbot concerning the shout, but there was no sign of one. And the
  possibility that it was Talbot himself who had called out, struck him for the
  first time.</p>

  <p>He rose and began to pace up and down the floor. That something was going
  on he knew; how to find out what it was&mdash;that was the point. And it was
  no question of fear or danger that deterred him, but just ordinary
  horse-sense.</p>

  <p>In the first place, save for the hall and the sitting-rooms, he did not
  know the geography of the house. It would, therefore, if he had a look round,
  be a blind search. And was the bare chance of discovering something worth the
  risk of being discovered himself? For if that happened, no amount of
  pretended buffoonery could possibly save him. He would stand self-convicted
  as a spy, and, apart from anything they might do to him, his value to the
  side would become nil on the spot.</p>

  <p>He drew back the curtain and looked out. It was an overcast, rather
  unpleasant night, and very dark. From a room at one end of the annexe, light
  was filtering through a blind, and it seemed to him that he could Catch the
  faint murmur of voices. The room was on the same floor as his own; if only he
  could see inside. But it was impossible, and once more he started pacing
  restlessly up and down.</p>

  <p>After a while he got undressed, but he knew that sleep would be out of the
  question. So, putting on a dressing-gown, he again flung himself into a
  chair, and picked up a book. But he could not concentrate. Round and round in
  his mind went the ceaseless questions. Where was the island of Varda? What
  was really happening there, for he no more believed Burton's explanation
  about that, than he believed his story about the electric-light plant? Where
  was Drummond? Was he outside there in the darkness prowling round the
  house?</p>

  <p>Suddenly he put down his book and leaned forward, listening intently. And
  this time there was no mistake; a board had creaked in the passage outside.
  Like a flash Algy was across the room and had switched off the light. Then,
  crouching behind the bed, he waited tensely.</p>

  <p>Came another creak&mdash;this time just outside the door, and the handle
  was gently tried. The flames were throwing dancing shadows, as with every
  muscle taut he watched the door slowly open. Watched and waited, only to
  relax suddenly with a gasp.</p>

  <p>With her eyes open and staring and her hands groping in front of her,
  Molly Castledon closed the door and came on into the room, She moved with a
  strange impression of sureness&mdash;slowly, but unfalteringly, and Algy
  watched her with some dismay. By now he realised what had happened; she was
  walking in her sleep. And his only coherent prayer was that her gorgon of a
  mother would not follow her. He felt that explanation would be
  difficult...</p>

  <p>But what on earth was he to do? Dimly he remembered that the one thing you
  must <i>not</i> do is to wake a sleep-walker. He had an idea that one took
  them by the hand and led them gently back to their own room. And one slight
  difficulty was that he had no idea which was her room. The prospect of a
  hand-in-hand search for it, and encountering mother minus hair and teeth in
  the process, made him break out in a cold sweat. Especially as, somewhat
  naturally, Molly had omitted to put on a wrap and was clad only in
  pyjamas.</p>

  <p>Algy drew a deep breath; something had to be done quickly as, to make
  matters worse, she was now preparing to get into bed. Wild thoughts of
  singing "You can't do that there 'ere" he dismissed as impracticable, and
  then the tension broke.</p>

  <p>"Are you never going to speak, fathead?" demanded the girl.</p>

  <p>"What the...Why the&mdash;" spluttered Algy. "I thought you were walking
  in your sleep."</p>

  <p>"Bright boy," she said sitting on the edge of the bed. "That's what I
  meant you to think. I used to when I was a kid, and I was afraid I might have
  forgotten how. Did I do it well?"</p>

  <p>"My angel woman&mdash;magnificently," he remarked. "But what on earth is
  the notion?"</p>

  <p>"Give me a cigarette," she said.</p>

  <p>"But, Molly," he cried, "you can't stop here. What on earth are people
  going to say if you're found out?"</p>

  <p>"Who's going to find out? Father had too much port, and mother's taken her
  usual sleep dope."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that," breathed Algy fervently.</p>

  <p>"And if it eases your mind I'm not going to stop here. You're coming to my
  room when I've finished this cigarette. Algy, that little performance was a
  dress rehearsal."</p>

  <p>"Go on, dear heart," he said resignedly. "I suppose I'll get this right
  sometime."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice I was a little annoyed when I came in from the
  billiard-room?"</p>

  <p>"It did not escape Algy's attention."</p>

  <p>"I don't know if the gentleman had been liquoring up, but the result left
  much to be desired."</p>

  <p>"I guessed it was that."</p>

  <p>"Much," she repeated. "His ideas of fun and laughter and mine do not
  coincide. And when I told you I'd play I did not bargain for that."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, dear," said Algy quietly. "Very sorry indeed. And I know that
  Hugh will be too."</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry about that; this child can look after herself. But, Algy
  I want to get a bit of my own back. Hence the sleep walking."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm a bit dense, my love, but..." Algy looked frankly
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Come over here."</p>

  <p>She took him by the arm and drew him to the window.</p>

  <p>"You see that room with the light on. I can see it much better from mine
  than you can from here. There's something going on in it. And I'm going to
  find out what that something is."</p>

  <p>"But how the devil do you propose to do it?"</p>

  <p>"If I can sleep walk into this room, I can sleep walk into that."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two he stared at her speechlessly.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl," he gasped at length, "don't be such an ass. It's out of
  the question. I absolutely forbid you to do anything of the sort. You're to
  go straight back to bed."</p>

  <p>She blew out a cloud of smoke.</p>

  <p>"Algy, my pet, you're rather angelic when you do the cave man stuff. Now
  listen to me, big boy. First of all what was all that Varda business
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Hugh got a note to me through one of the footmen. Incidentally he's not a
  footman at all, but the son of Colonel Talbot who was murdered the other day.
  And in the note I was told to get Burton's and Menalin's reaction to the
  island of Varda."</p>

  <p>She began to laugh.</p>

  <p>"And was that the best you could do, my poor lamb? However, we'll let that
  pass, and go on. Do you believe what our charming host said about that man
  who screamed?"</p>

  <p>"No," admitted Algy. "I don't."</p>

  <p>"Good. Two points. A third you've just told me yourself; this show is
  sufficiently big not only for a man to come masquerading as a footman, but
  for me to have been given the job I've got. O.K. up to date?"</p>

  <p>"You little devil," grinned Algy. "You're not going to get me that
  way."</p>

  <p>"Shut up," said the girl. "So much for that side of the situation; now for
  the other. I never liked Charles, but you can take it from me that, compared
  to my feelings for him now, those of yester year were like a crooning
  mother's. So you see that everything adds up; no subtraction anywhere."</p>

  <p>"But Molly, my dear," he said, "it's not safe. There are probably a lot of
  men there."</p>

  <p>"What if there are? They won't eat me."</p>

  <p>"And the chances are very small that you'll find out anything if you
  do."</p>

  <p>"The chances are non-existent that I'll find out anything if I don't."</p>

  <p>"Besides&mdash;your rig."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with it? I'm decent, ain't I?"</p>

  <p>"Of course you are, my dear," he said feebly. "Perfectly adorable,
  but..."</p>

  <p>She rose and pitched her cigarette into the fire.</p>

  <p>"Algy dear," she said quietly. "My mind is absolutely made up. There's no
  good pretending that if you thought you had half a chance of getting into
  that room successfully yourself you wouldn't take it."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right," he admitted grudgingly.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm right. Well you haven't half a chance&mdash;not the
  hundredth part of a chance. They're more than a bit suspicious of you
  already. So the only hope is me. I may find out nothing; the door may be
  locked; they may be holding a Bible meeting. But I'm going to have a look
  see."</p>

  <p>"You are a fizzer, Molly," he cried. "But it's all wrong, you know. And if
  anything happens to you, I'll never forgive myself."</p>

  <p>"Don't be an ass. What can happen to me? Now come along to my room, and
  we'll have a preliminary investigation. Then once I'm away you must come back
  here, and wait for me."</p>

  <p>"I'll wait in your room."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. When Charles leads me back by the hand it'll look grand,
  won't it, if the first person he sees is you. Come on."</p>

  <p>Side by side they crept along the passage till they came to her door. And
  it was as they got to it that Algy suddenly stiffened; from close by he had
  heard a faint sound of movement. His grip on her arm tightened, and she
  paused pressing close to him in the darkness.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"There's someone here," he breathed. "Go into your room; shut and lock the
  door. I'll come in later&mdash;if it's safe."</p>

  <p>He crouched back against the wall as she opened the door. And in the faint
  light that filtered out from the fire he saw for a second the outline of a
  man not a yard away. And seeing&mdash;sprang.</p>

  <p>Came a grunt and a stifled curse as he closed, and the next moment he was
  fighting in earnest. And then more light; Molly had reopened her door.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" muttered Algy, letting go. His opponent was Talbot.</p>

  <p>"What's the game?" he demanded suspiciously. "What are you doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>Talbot raised his eyebrows, and Algy frowned. It had just struck him that,
  on the face of it, the same question applied to him even more forcibly. Then
  he realised Molly was still standing in the open doorway.</p>

  <p>"Molly," he said, "this is the footman I told you about. Captain Talbot;
  Miss Castledon."</p>

  <p>She gave an amused little laugh.</p>

  <p>"How d'you do," she remarked, holding out her hand. "Don't look so
  embarrassed, you poor man. I can assure you that Algy's intentions are
  strictly honourable. Come in; we can't all stand about in the passage."</p>

  <p>"You see," explained Talbot, when the door was shut, "Drummond didn't know
  that Longworth was going to be here when he first sent me. And so, amongst
  other things one of the jobs he gave me was to look after you, Miss
  Castledon. He told me what you were doing&mdash;leading Burton up the garden
  path and so forth&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;happened to be
  passing the billiard-room to-night when you were in there. So I
  thought&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Molly quietly. "You thought he might endeavour to follow
  up the good work."</p>

  <p>"Something of the sort," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, Captain Talbot. It was sweet of you. So far I am
  glad to say I have been spared that. This is something quite different.
  Explain to him, Algy."</p>

  <p>Talbot listened with a look of admiration growing on his face.</p>

  <p>"But it's super," he cried, enthusiastically.</p>

  <p>"Simply super. I congratulate you, Miss Castledon."</p>

  <p>"Rot," said Algy. "She oughtn't to do it."</p>

  <p>"But she's going to, my pet," answered Molly.</p>

  <p>"And I shall be on hand," said Talbot.</p>

  <p>Algy stared at him.</p>

  <p>"That makes it better," he said thoughtfully. "Much better."</p>

  <p>"But how can you be?" cried Molly. "You can't be sleep-walking too."</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," laughed Talbot. "But I am a footman. I can be in parts of
  the house, quite safely, where Longworth couldn't possibly be without raising
  suspicion."</p>

  <p>"Have you got any idea how many there are in this party?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"There's a permanent staff here of six men," said Talbot. "They've got a
  dining-room of their own, and four of 'em are foreigners."</p>

  <p>"What do they do?"</p>

  <p>"Secretarial work apparently. But it's really only guess-work on my part,
  because they've got a special staff who look after them."</p>

  <p>"And was it one of them who screamed?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," answered Talbot. "I heard it, of course, but there's one
  thing you soon discover in this house. Curiosity is not encouraged."</p>

  <p>"Burton said it was someone getting tied up in the the electric-light
  plant," remarked Algy.</p>

  <p>"That I can assure you it wasn't," said Talbot. "The engine is a hundred
  yards away in the wood. No; that scream came from the house."</p>

  <p>"Come on, Captain Talbot," cried Molly. "If we stop here talking all
  night, their meeting will be over."</p>

  <p>"Dash it, Molly," said Algy. "I <i>don't</i> like it."</p>

  <p>"Dry up," she laughed. "Now what are you going to do?" She turned to the
  soldier.</p>

  <p>"Go with you and show you the room. Then lurk round a corner out of sight,
  but within hearing. And if anything happens, just give <i>a</i> call and I'll
  be with you."</p>

  <p>"And you, Algy?"</p>

  <p>"I'll watch from here for a bit, but I'll be away before there's any
  chance of your coming back. It's all wrong this, but good luck, bless
  you."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind her and Talbot, and Algy crossed to the window. The
  girl had been right; he could see straight into the room opposite. But the
  blind was pulled down, so that the fact did not avail much. And then to his
  amaze and delight a thing happened which he would not have dared to hope for.
  With a click the blind flew up, and there was Menalin leaning out of the
  window.</p>

  <p>Algy crouched down still lower, though he knew he could not be seen. What
  an unprecedented stroke of luck! Every detail of the room was plainly
  visible. Facing him, and sitting at one end of a table was Burton, and the
  six men mentioned by Talbot were flanking him, three on either side. Nearest
  to him was a pushed back chair, evidently the one which Menalin had just
  vacated.</p>

  <p>At the moment Burton was doing the talking, though it was impossible to
  hear anything he said. Occasionally one of the others would make a note, or
  consult a paper, whilst Menalin, his back to the room, stood quietly smoking.
  It might, reflected Algy, have been the most ordinary common or garden
  business meeting, with the chairman addressing his board of directors.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Algy grew tense; the moment had come. Menalin had swung round;
  the other men had all risen and were staring open-mouthed at some obviously
  amazing spectacle. And then Molly herself came into view. Heavens! but she
  was superb. Even at that distance he could see the outstretched hands, sense
  those wide-open staring eyes as she moved across the room.</p>

  <p>She came to a chair, and began slowly to feel her way round the table. And
  it was then that Burton seemed to come out of his stupor. He lifted one hand
  in an imperative signal for silence, and moved swiftly towards the girl. For
  a moment Algy's heart stood still. What was he going to do? And with
  unspeakable relief he saw that all was well; Burton had been taken in even as
  he had.</p>

  <p>Very gently he took the girl's hand, and began to lead her towards the
  door. Which, reflected Algy, was his cue not to linger on the order of his
  going. Five seconds later he was back in his own room, marvelling at the
  pluck which had carried a girl of her age through such an ordeal. Whether she
  had found out anything or not was beside the point; nothing could detract
  from the merit of the performance. In fact he was still taking off his hat to
  it when Talbot shook him into consciousness next morning at eight
  o'clock.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't have believed it possible that I could have slept," Algy
  announced. "God! man&mdash;she was immense. Did you see it?"</p>

  <p>Talbot shook his head.</p>

  <p>"But I followed back to her room at a discreet distance to make sure
  Burton didn't try any funny stuff."</p>

  <p>"He didn't, did he?"</p>

  <p>"No. I'll give the swine credit for that. I wonder whether she's got on to
  anything."</p>

  <p>"We'll find out this morning. Jove! that girl can act."</p>

  <p>Algy lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"All the six worthies you told us about, and the great Menalin himself,
  gaping at her like a group of dead codfish."</p>

  <p>"I wish I'd seen it," said Talbot.</p>

  <p>"The incredible bit of luck was that just before the performance started
  Menalin went and loosed up the blind. So that I saw the whole outfit from A
  to Z. Look here, old lad, we'll have to keep up the fiction. D'you mind
  turning me on a bath?"</p>

  <p>Talbot grinned.</p>

  <p>"As your lordship wishes. Shall I carry in the ducal loofah?"</p>

  <p>"Go to hell," said Algy amiably. "You're a foul valet, and if the water
  isn't the right temperature I shall report you to that pompous-stomached
  butler."</p>

  <p>The male members of the party were already down when he arrived for
  breakfast an hour later.</p>

  <p>"Good morrow, my dear old proprietor and fellow guests," he burbled,
  wandering over to the hot plate on a tour of inspection. "What is the popular
  line in nourishment?"</p>

  <p>"Eggs in silence," said Burton. "You'll find papers on the sideboard."</p>

  <p>"Eggs in silence!" Algy guffawed. "By Jove I That's good; I must remember
  that one."</p>

  <p>He glanced sideways as the door opened and Molly came in.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Miss Castledon." He bowed deeply and realised that not for
  nothing did she pass her hand wearily over her forehead, and give him the
  barest suspicion of a wink. "We are in great heart, are we?"</p>

  <p>"Please don't get up." She turned to the others who had risen. "Not very
  great, Algy."</p>

  <p>"My angel&mdash;you shake me to the core. What ails thee?"</p>

  <p>"I had the most extraordinary vivid dream last night," she said.</p>

  <p>"Really." Burton looked at her solicitously. "Nothing to do with the
  dinner, I hope."</p>

  <p>"It was about you," she went on. "And Mr. Menalin. You were in a room
  which had a big table in it, and there were six other men with you. There
  were chairs round the table, and a lot of papers scattered on it. And you
  were all standing up and looking at me. I know it all sounds very stupid and
  ordinary, but it was so vivid that it might have been real."</p>

  <p>"Not at all stupid, Miss Castledon," said Menalin. "In fact very
  interesting. And I'll tell you why in a minute. Was that all you saw in the
  room?"</p>

  <p>"No. There was a man asleep on the sofa."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," repeated Menalin. "Isn't it, Charles?"</p>

  <p>Burton nodded and the girl looked in bewilderment from one to the
  other.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she said at length.</p>

  <p>"Because it wasn't a dream, Miss Castledon," answered Menalin. "Tell me,
  do you often walk in your sleep?"</p>

  <p>"No. I don't, do I, Daddy?"</p>

  <p>"What's this? What's this?" Sir George came out from behind his paper with
  a start. "Walk in your sleep! You haven't since you were a child."</p>

  <p>"She did last night, Sir George," said Burton. "We were having a business
  conference which lasted rather late, and suddenly the door opened and your
  daughter came in. I'd never seen a case of sleepwalking before; in fact none
  of us had. But she went quite peacefully back to her room and never woke at
  all."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" cried the startled baronet. "You don't say so. She
  used to do it when she was small, but she hasn't for years."</p>

  <p>"And why I said it was interesting," remarked Menalin, "was that Burton
  and I had a little argument as to how much anyone in that condition really
  sees. From what Miss Castledon tells us, everything is imprinted on the
  brain, just like a camera exposure."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that it really <i>was</i> you I saw last night?" cried
  Molly.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," said Menalin. "And our host. And the six other men. And the
  man asleep on the sofa."</p>

  <p>"Then that probably accounts for my feeling so tired this morning," she
  said. "You poor people! I'm sorry I was such a nuisance."</p>

  <p>"A very charming one, at any rate," laughed Menalin. "I wish we could
  always have such delightful interruptions to prosaic business meetings."</p>

  <p>"Do you feel up to golf, old thing?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"Rather. Of course I do. Ring up for caddies. You see, Algy," she said
  half an hour later as they swung out of the drive in his car, "I thought it
  was safer to take the bull by the horns. Telling the whole thing like that,
  and looking a bit washed-out ought to dispel any possible suspicion. And in
  view of everything, it's advisable."</p>

  <p>"My dear!" he cried enthusiastically, "you were superb. I watched the
  whole thing through the window." He glanced at her as he spoke. "What's the
  matter, kid? In view of everything...Is there..."</p>

  <p>She was staring straight in front of her.</p>

  <p>"There was one moment, Algy, when I nearly gave the whole show away."</p>

  <p>"Was there? When?"</p>

  <p>"The man who was asleep on the sofa..."</p>

  <p>"What about him?"</p>

  <p>"He wasn't asleep. He was dead."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII. &mdash; CADDIE MOST FOUL</a></h2>

  <p>Algy pulled into the side of the road and stopped the car.</p>

  <p>"What is that you said?" he asked very quietly.</p>

  <p>"I said that the man lying on the sofa was not asleep. He was dead."</p>

  <p>"Look here, dear," he continued. "I don't want you to think I'm being
  stupid or unbelieving. But this is serious. Are you sure?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever seen a dead man?"</p>

  <p>"No. Not till last night."</p>

  <p>"And you're quite certain he wasn't asleep?"</p>

  <p>"A man breathes when he's asleep, doesn't he, Algy? He doesn't lie
  motionless with his mouth open, and his eyes wide and staring...Oh! God, I
  nearly screamed."</p>

  <p>"May He be praised that you didn't," said Algy gravely. "You wouldn't have
  been here now if you had, Molly; nor would Talbot, nor would I."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette and leaned forward over the steering-wheel.</p>

  <p>"What did they kill for, Algy?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," he said. "Same as you can over everything connected with
  this show. He was probably the poor blighter we heard shout for help earlier
  on."</p>

  <p>All around them stretched the floods, the water lapping idly against the
  sides of the road.</p>

  <p>"You do believe me, don't you?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Yes, my dear, I do&mdash;in view of what we know of these gentlemen. The
  point is&mdash;what to do?"</p>

  <p>There came the faint swish of a bicycle approaching from behind, and a man
  rode slowly past them.</p>

  <p>"Get on, Algy, you fool," said a well-known voice. "You're in sight of the
  house. Go to the golf club. Play a round. Look out for me there."</p>

  <p>As silently as he had come the cyclist departed, without even having
  turned his head. And as they overtook him again half a minute later, a
  typical caddie was still bicycling stoically along the road towards the
  links.</p>

  <p>"Who was that?" gasped the girl.</p>

  <p>"Hugh Drummond," said Algy shortly. "I <i>would</i> make an idiot mistake
  like that."</p>

  <p>"But I don't see what was wrong," she cried.</p>

  <p>"Darling," he said, "you don't see what was wrong, because you don't know
  what we're up against. Why should we stop and talk in the middle of a ruddy
  lake, unless we had something very important to discuss, especially as
  ostensibly we're on our way to play golf? We're fighting a gang of utterly
  unscrupulous men, and once let them think that we're in collusion, it's all U
  P."</p>

  <p>"So that was the mysterious Captain Drummond," she said after a pause. "I
  want to meet him."</p>

  <p>"You evidently will&mdash;this morning. But don't forget that so far as
  you are concerned he's just an unknown man of the caddie type. This is a game
  of no mistakes, Molly, in spite of the fact that I've just made a
  crasher."</p>

  <p>There were some twenty cars parked when they arrived, and Algy, taking out
  the two bags, walked over to the pro's shop.</p>

  <p>"Bit short this morning, sir, I'm afraid," remarked that worthy. "There's
  a match on. I can manage one caddie for the lady, but..."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," said Algy casually. "If anyone else turns up send him out to
  me."</p>

  <p>A bit of luck, he reflected as he strolled over to the club house...Left
  Hugh to do as he liked...</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed; coming up the road was a car he knew well&mdash;Charles
  Burton's. And the owner was inside.</p>

  <p>"Changed your mind?" he called out as the car stopped. "Come and play a
  three ball."</p>

  <p>"No, thank you," answered Burton. "I've only come up to see the secretary,
  and get my clubs."</p>

  <p>Algy wandered into the bar looking thoughtful. On the face of it Burton
  might have telephoned the secretary and asked Algy to bring back his clubs.
  So was that the real reason that had brought his host here, or was it to make
  sure the golf was genuine? And at that moment he noticed the group by the
  bar; Peter Darrell, Ted Jerningham, Toby Sinclair&mdash;the whole of
  Drummond's gang. Moreover, everyone of them glanced at him as if he was a
  stranger...The game was beginning in earnest. He ordered a pint of beer, and
  stood leaning up against the bar and almost touching Peter Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Quid corners, boys?" Peter was saying.</p>

  <p>"Goes with me," answered Jerningham.</p>

  <p>"By the way, steward," went on Peter, "is there any good hotel near-by
  where we could put up for the night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Two or three. I can give you the names if you like."</p>

  <p>Algy strolled over to the window; certainly the game was beginning. And as
  he looked out, he saw Drummond standing by the caddie master's but
  shouldering his bag of clubs.</p>

  <p>"Steward," he called out, "would you telephone through to the professional
  and ask him to give my caddie a couple of Bromfolds. Hud something or other
  is his name."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir."</p>

  <p>The steward turned away, and for an instant the eyes of all of them met.
  Then Algy put down his tankard and went out into the hall to find Charles
  Burton talking to Molly.</p>

  <p>"Come on, you boozing hound," she cried. "I don't believe you've even got
  a ball down."</p>

  <p>"I hope you have a good game," said Burton politely.</p>

  <p>"Sorry you won't make a three ball, old host." The door had flung open
  behind him and the others were coming out of the bar. "Come on, Molly. I've
  got a caddie after all."</p>

  <p>"Algy," she said as they walked to the tee, "wasn't that Ted Jerningham I
  saw in the hall?"</p>

  <p>"It was," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Why did he look straight at me and cut me dead?"</p>

  <p>"Because I got in 'old host' just in time," grinned Algy. "You wouldn't
  have thought, would you, that I'd known the whole crowd for fifteen
  years?"</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Drummond, dear. They're all his gang&mdash;same as I am. And you're our
  latest and most priceless addition. So for to-day you don't know Ted, and he
  doesn't know you. See?"</p>

  <p>"You know," she said happily, "I'm beginning to like this. What are they
  doing down here?"</p>

  <p>"Stopping for the night for one thing. But I'll know more by the end of
  the round. Good-bye, darling. I think you've hooked into Kent."</p>

  <p>"A grand girl, Algy," said Drummond, as Molly and her caddie disappeared.
  "That show of hers last night was magnificent&mdash;simply magnificent."</p>

  <p>"You saw it, did you?"</p>

  <p>"I was up in a tree. Did she find out anything?" He fumbled suddenly with
  the bag. "Bit to the right of the 'ole, sir. Gaw blimey&mdash;wot a
  putt!"</p>

  <p>"Not up to your usual form, that one, Longworth?"</p>

  <p>From nowhere, apparently, Charles Burton had unexpectedly
  materialised.</p>

  <p>"D'you mind if I stroll round with you for a bit?"</p>

  <p>"An honour, dear old boy, an honour. I admit that putt was not struck with
  my usual fluent form, but the round is yet young."</p>

  <p>"I had an idea," remarked Burton a little later, "that you knew Peter
  Darrell."</p>

  <p>"Peter Darrell!" Algy frowned thoughtfully. "What do I want here,
  caddie?"</p>

  <p>"Yer driver," answered that worthy contemptuously. "It's more'n a 'undred
  yards. 'Ere&mdash;try a number five. The young laidy's dead. Caw!" He viewed
  the shot dispassionately. "Wot you wants is a 'ockey stick. Now, Mr. Darrell,
  sir&mdash;wot this gentleman was talking abaht&mdash;he <i>can</i> play.
  Caddied for 'im, I did, sir, last Hamateur up at Prestwick. 'E ain't down
  'ere to-day, is he, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Are you speaking to me, my man?" said Burton. But Algy's caddie was not
  listening; he was staring at a four ball coming up the last fairway.</p>

  <p>"That's 'im," he announced triumphantly. "That tall gent in the levver
  jacket. Know 'im anywhere I would, though I've only met 'im once or
  twice."</p>

  <p>"When you've quite finished your interesting reminiscences," said Burton
  coldly, "would it be too much to hope that you could keep your mouth shut for
  a minute or two?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I begs yer pardon, sir."</p>

  <p>"As I was saying, Longworth, I thought you knew Darrell."</p>

  <p>"Like our loquacious friend here, I have met him once or twice," said Algy
  as if searching in his memory. "That's the crowd who were in the bar, isn't
  it? I thought I recognised one of them...Of course it was Darrell, now I come
  to think of it...Silly of me...We sort of stared at one another...Can I go
  yet, caddie?"</p>

  <p>"Yus. But you'd better not. Yer <i>might</i> 'it it this time."</p>

  <p>The four ball had reached their tee and sat down on <i>a</i> bench.</p>

  <p>"Remember me, Mr. Darrell, sir?" Algy's caddie touched his cap. "Caddied
  for you, I did, sir, last summer at Prestwick. 'Udson's my name."</p>

  <p>"Of course, Hudson. I remember you perfectly. How's the world treating
  you?"</p>

  <p>"So-so, sir. Been 'aving a spot of trouble with me kidneys, but not too
  bad."</p>

  <p>"Sorry about that." Darrell got up as Algy approached him.</p>

  <p>"Stupid of me not to recognise you in the bar, Darrell," said Algy. "I
  forgot where we met, but..."</p>

  <p>"So do I. And d'you know I'm ashamed to confess it, but I've completely
  forgotten your name."</p>

  <p>"Longworth. We must have a spot afterwards. Can't I go now, Hudson?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yer ain't Bobby Jones, are yer? Nor Cyril Tolley. If yer keeps yer
  'ead dahn for once yer might clear the rough. Cripes! That one's killed a
  rabbit orl right."</p>

  <p>Muttering darkly he plunged into the heather brandishing a niblick.</p>

  <p>"'Ere we are," he announced morosely. "Can't even see the perishing ball,
  though it don't make no odds seeing as 'ow yer never looks at it."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake shut up, you awful mess," muttered Algy in a shaking
  voice. "If I begin to laugh we're ungummed!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't realise Burton would be coming up to the club," said Drummond.
  "Look out&mdash;here he is. Well aht, sir; good one, that was."</p>

  <p>"Well, Longworth," said Burton with a laugh, "if you aren't stunned by
  your caddie's verbosity, I'll expect you both at lunch."</p>

  <p>"Going back?" cried Algy. "Right ho! old host. We'll masticate the
  rissoles later."</p>

  <p>"By God! that bloke wants watching," said Drummond as Burton disappeared
  over the rise in the direction of the club house. Then he looked across at
  Molly Castledon, who was searching for her ball in the rough on the left.
  "Tell me, Algy, did she find out anything last night?"</p>

  <p>"You know she was pretending to sleep-walk?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Talbot told me that this morning. But what did she hear&mdash;or
  see?"</p>

  <p>"A man lying dead on the sofa," said Algy quietly.</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>Drummond for one second halted dead in his tracks. Then, true to his role,
  he ambled forward again.</p>

  <p>"Is she certain?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. We were discussing it when you rode past us this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"So they've got him, have they?" muttered Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who he was?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>They were converging on the green, and the girl came towards them.</p>

  <p>"How many have you played, Algy?" she called out.</p>

  <p>"Three, my love," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Pretty foul player, aren't you? D'you see the man," she continued as she
  joined them, "standing by the tree at the next tee?"</p>

  <p>"I do," said Algy, missing his putt by a yard.</p>

  <p>"He was in the room last night. One of the six. Have I got this for
  it?"</p>

  <p>"You have, darling. Well holed: in all the way. You heard that, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"I did. Gad! that girl's a fizzer."</p>

  <p>He said no more until they had topped the hill in front of the seventh
  tee. Behind them the watcher at the sixth green seemed to be growing a little
  bored, and was showing signs of following them. And then the crest of the
  bunker hid him from sight.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Algy," said Drummond quietly, "obviously this isn't safe. How
  much they suspect, I don't know&mdash;but they suspect something.
  Luckily&mdash;here comes the rain. Quit your game at the next green, and go
  back to the club house.</p>

  <p>"This afternoon you have got to go to London. I will arrange for a
  telephone call to come through to you."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget," put in Algy, "that there are extensions all over the
  place, and it's more than likely to be tapped."</p>

  <p>"Right," said Drummond. "Molly Castledon will remain here; she'll be
  perfectly safe, especially with Talbot in the house. Arrived in London you
  will ring up Alice Blackton and arrange to meet somewhere. That's instead of
  Monday night. You'll have to watch it; she will almost certainly be followed.
  And that you've got to dodge. You will then bring her down here."</p>

  <p>"Here?" cried Algy.</p>

  <p>"Yes: here. Go back to the Black Horse at Storrington and await further
  orders. Here's a brassie, and, for Heaven's sake, hit it. I've got a lot to
  say yet, and this is our last chance.</p>

  <p>"Now," he continued, when Algy had despatched the ball towards the green,
  "the situation is this. As Talbot told you, Ronald Standish has escaped.
  Incidentally you needn't worry about the <i>Morning Post;</i> Talbot told me
  their reaction to the word Varda. It was Ronald who cabled me about it; he
  too is in ignorance of where it is. And that is what we have got to find out;
  so far as I can see, it is not mentioned in any atlas. Which is where Alice
  Blackton comes in."</p>

  <p>"Does she know where it is?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"No. But she knows a man who probably does. The trouble is that, unless
  I'm much mistaken, that's the man Miss Castledon saw lying dead last
  night."</p>

  <p>Algy whistled.</p>

  <p>"The devil it is," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"I don't know him by sight," continued Drummond, "so it's useless for me
  to work on my own. Alice is the only person who does, so she's got to do the
  identification."</p>

  <p>"But where?"</p>

  <p>"Unless I'm much mistaken," said Drummond quietly, "he was killed even as
  Latimer was killed. Earlier in the evening, from my point of vantage, I
  caught a glimpse of Burton with a hypodermic syringe in his hand. Now the
  body was not moved last night, and they won't dare to do so to-day. So he'll
  be deposited somewhere to-night. Almost certainly not in the
  grounds&mdash;that would be too close home; but they'll dump him on the
  Downs. That's where the boys come in; lucky I got 'em down. Tell Peter he'll
  get his orders in due course, and that it's an all-night job to-night for
  everybody."</p>

  <p>"What's the great point over the identification?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"If it's Alice Blackton's man they've killed, we're no further on than we
  were before over locating this island. But if it isn't, we needn't
  worry."</p>

  <p>"I get you. Hugh, are you any nearer what's going on?"</p>

  <p>"A few months ago France wasn't far off a revolution," said Drummond
  grimly. "Nor was Belgium. Let's leave it at that. Stopping, sir?" he
  continued in a louder voice. "It is coming dahn a bit."</p>

  <p>Molly Castledon took her cue instantly.</p>

  <p>"Not much fun, is it, Algy?" she remarked. "Let's go back to the club
  house."</p>

  <p>"Right, old dear."</p>

  <p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw the watcher approaching.</p>

  <p>"Dry the clubs, caddie," he continued, "and put 'em in my car,
  please."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. Thank you, sir."</p>

  <p>His hand closed round his fee, and for the fraction of a second his lips
  twitched.</p>

  <p>"A bit of my own back," said Algy happily to Molly as they started to walk
  back. "I gave him a farthing and a trouser button."</p>

  <p>"What's it all about, Algy?" she asked eagerly. Briefly he told her, and
  she began to frown mutinously.</p>

  <p>"But I wanted to be in it," she said. "It's not fair of Captain
  Drummond."</p>

  <p>"Darling," he assured her, "you shall be later. Tonight you <i>can't</i>
  do any good, and if you were found to be missing from the house, the whole
  outfit goes west. Don't forget that Hugh has had very little time; all these
  orders have had to be worked out since I told him that man was dead. He's
  simply raving over what you did."</p>

  <p>"All right," she said. "I'll forgive him this time. Let's have a
  drink."</p>

  <p>"It will be interesting to see what our friend the watcher does," he
  murmured, as they sat down in the lounge. "Here he comes."</p>

  <p>With his coat collar turned up, for the rain was now coming down in
  earnest, the man came in through the swing doors and went into the
  cloakroom.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what the deuce he thinks he's going to find out," said Algy.
  "Burton I can understand; obviously he suspected Peter and me. But this bloke
  defeats me."</p>

  <p>"Just watching, I should think," said the girl, "to see if there's any
  reaction between you and the others when you might think it was safe."</p>

  <p>"There's no doubt," remarked Algy thoughtfully, "that Hugh is right. We're
  suspect. But I must say it amused me to-day&mdash;the old boy caddying right,
  under that swab Burton's nose. Now what do you suggest we should do, my pet?
  Here comes Peter and Co., and I've got to get a message through to him. But
  after that?"</p>

  <p>"Let's go back as late as possible," she said. "I dread the thought of
  that house without you there to support me."</p>

  <p>"Pretty foul, I agree," said Algy. "Still, you can always plead a head and
  get to bed early to-night...And lock your door, my dear; don't forget."</p>

  <p>The lounge was filling as more people came in out of the rain. The
  watcher, engrossed in a paper, was sitting inconspicuously in a corner; Peter
  Darrell, passing on his way to the bar, had been formally introduced to Molly
  Castledon. And in the process thereof had been given Drummond's message...But
  since it had been contained in a story of apparently sultry hue, which had
  given rise to much ribald merriment, the watcher was blissfully ignorant of
  it. In fact he was blissfully ignorant of anything, save that he had spent a
  wasted morning, when at a quarter to one Molly and Algy rose to go back to
  Birchington Towers.</p>

  <p>The rain had ceased, and Algy proceeded to offend God and man by singing
  as they drove along.</p>

  <p>"Feed me with ortolans; nurture me with the wines of Cathay," he
  declaimed. "You know, darling," he continued, relapsing into speech, "the
  more I think of it, the more unutterably foul do I regard that limerick last
  night."</p>

  <p>"That's something, anyway," she agreed kindly.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless it succeeded in its object. The name Varda stabbed 'em both
  in the stomach."</p>

  <p>"And you think this girl, Alice Blackton, will know where it is?"</p>

  <p>"Such seems to be Hugh's idea."</p>

  <p>"And if she does, or can find out?"</p>

  <p>"Presumably we go there, and the fun really begins." She lit a cigarette
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Do you always follow Hugh Drummond blind?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Always. The only time that I've ever faintly jibbed was over his
  suggestion that you should dally with Burton. However, up to date, there's no
  harm done."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going on with it much more, my lad."</p>

  <p>Algy turned in at the drive.</p>

  <p>"My angel child," he said quietly, "don't worry. If I'm any judge of
  matters you won't need to. It won't be long now before things come to a head.
  We're on the warpath properly."</p>

  <p>"Who is telephoning you from Town?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't an earthly. Hugh is fixing it."</p>

  <p>It proved to be Algy's Uncle William who was leaving for Egypt next day. A
  faint click as he picked up the receiver when the message came through after
  lunch, assured him that another person had done likewise, elsewhere in the
  house, but Uncle William was foolproof. His seat was reserved; his cabin was
  booked; and it was essential he should see Algy before he went. There was
  some business connected with the estate which he wanted cleared up at once.
  So he would await Algy at his club, and if he wished would give him dinner
  that night.</p>

  <p>"That's torn it," said Algy, re-entering the hall. "Little Algy must leave
  you for the metropolis. Uncle William has escaped from the home we keep him
  in and would fain see his nephew before leaving for Egypt. So if you will
  excuse me, old host, I will see about getting my things packed."</p>

  <p>Talbot answered his bell, and there was a faint grin on his face.</p>

  <p>"The secretary was listening in to your London call," he remarked. "Was it
  O.K.?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," said Algy. "Dear Uncle William was word perfect. Have you seen
  Drummond?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. For a minute before lunch on the road."</p>

  <p>"You know about the dead man?"</p>

  <p>Talbot nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do I take off my hat to that girl? I'm asking you."</p>

  <p>"Look after her, old boy," said Algy.</p>

  <p>"Leave me to it," answered Talbot. "I only wish I could talk to her
  openly."</p>

  <p>Then his face set grimly.</p>

  <p>"By God Longworth&mdash;I'm just waiting for the moment when I can get my
  own back on these swine. My dear old guv'nor&mdash;who'd never harmed a
  child..."</p>

  <p>"Trust Hugh Drummond, old boy," said Algy. "It'll come sooner than you
  think. Put the bags in my car, will you! And I may be seeing you
  to-night..."</p>

  <p>It certainly seemed as if Uncle William had pulled it off. Burton was
  politely disappointed at his having to go; Menalin did not even appear on the
  scene. Even Lady Castledon, overjoyed at the prospect of Algy's departure, so
  far forgot herself as to ask him to call in London.</p>

  <p>But for all that Algy was taking no risks. It was a Sunday and traffic was
  heavy on the main Bognor road, even though it was late in the year. An easy
  day, in fact, to follow a car, however fast it was, since high speed was out
  of the question.</p>

  <p>So he swung into a network of lanes, when he had gone a few miles, and
  slowed up his pace. And a few minutes convinced him that he was safe; no one
  was on his heels. He pulled up and lit a cigarette; a plan of campaign was
  necessary.</p>

  <p>To begin with, his own flat and club would almost certainly be under
  supervision. To go to London at all, therefore, seemed foolish. The point was
  whether Alice Blackton could smuggle herself out of town without being
  spotted. And the only way of finding that out was to get through to her on
  the telephone.</p>

  <p>He drove on, keeping well clear of the London road, until he came at
  length to a village which a notice-board proclaimed was Rodsworth. It
  appeared to be wrapped in slumber, though one dilapidated Ford stood outside
  the Chequers Inn. It would serve, he decided, as well as any other, and
  backing his car into the so-called garage, he entered the hotel and booked a
  room, to the evident amazement of the landlord. Then he put through a
  telephone call to Alice.</p>

  <p>By an amazing stroke of luck he caught her just as she was going out; in
  fact, he gathered the boy friend was even then blaspheming in the hall at the
  delay.</p>

  <p>"He must blaspheme, dear," said Algy firmly. "Has he a motor-car? He has.
  Outside the door at the moment? Good. Now listen, Alice. Is your place being
  watched? Not that you know of. Not good enough, my dear. We can't run any
  risks. Tell your pal that he's got to cancel any plans he may have made for
  this afternoon. He is to start off in any direction he may think
  fit&mdash;preferably as if he was going to John o' Groat's&mdash;and then
  after devious detours he is to arrive with you at the Chequers Inn, situated
  in the fascinating old world village of Rodsworth in Sussex. Got that? Good.
  You must make absolutely certain you're not followed...No. I don't want to be
  more explicit over the 'phone...What time? Any time before it's dark.
  Good-bye, my angel."</p>

  <p>He replaced the receiver, and crossed to the window. The village street
  was still deserted, which confirmed his own safety. Would Alice and her
  escort be equally fortunate?</p>

  <p>Slowly the hours dragged by. A watery sun had come out, throwing fitful
  shadows on the stuffed horsehair furniture of the parlour. Over the
  mantelpiece his host, encased in his wedding glory of frock coat and bowler
  complete gazed at him sheepishly from the wall; whilst flanked on each side
  of him, two masterpieces depicted shoals of fat and very naked babies
  floating hopefully in space.</p>

  <p>It was six o'clock when he awoke, cramped in every limb, from a painful
  doze. A car was thrumming softly outside the window, and in the gathering
  darkness he could just see Alice and a man getting out.</p>

  <p>"Great," he cried, meeting them at the door. "Sure you've not been
  followed?"</p>

  <p>"Certain," said Alice. "This is Jimmy Parker...Algy Longworth..."</p>

  <p>The two men shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Run her into the garage, Parker," said Algy. "Then we'll have a
  drink."</p>

  <p>"What's the great idea, Algy?" demanded the girl, as Parker rejoined them.
  "Jimmy's been breathing blood all the way here."</p>

  <p>"Sorry about that," said Algy with a grin, "but it was unavoidable. You're
  for a job of work to-night, Alice."</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"And incidentally so are you, Parker," he added. "What is it, chaps? Two
  pints and a gin and french, please. Now," he continued as the landlord left
  the room, "is this bloke reliable, Alice?"</p>

  <p>"Quite," she said. "He's an N.0."</p>

  <p>"Grand. Couldn't be better. Have you told him anything, my dear?"</p>

  <p>"Vaguely. I guessed it was to do with the Drummond show."</p>

  <p>"Right. Well, please keep that to yourself, Parker. It's a case of murder,
  Alice, and you've got to identify the victim."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" cried Parker sharply. "Why should she?"</p>

  <p>"Dry up, Jimmy," said the girl. "Tell me, Algy." They listened in silence
  while Algy told them briefly what had occurred, and when he'd finished Alice
  Blackton sat twisting her pocket handkerchief in her fingers.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if it's Mrs. Cartwright's husband," she said in a low voice, and
  Algy looked at her quickly.</p>

  <p>"Who's he?" he cried.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you later," she said. "What does Captain Drummond want me to
  do?"</p>

  <p>"Come with me to the Black Horse at Storrington to start with," answered
  Algy. "We'll get further orders there."</p>

  <p>"And what about Jimmy?"</p>

  <p>"I want him, if he will, to do a much more uninteresting job," said Algy,
  "but a very important one. It's my own idea, I admit, because no one knew he
  was coming into the picture till this afternoon. Now it will be of the
  greatest advantage if the other side think I'm safely in my flat to-night. So
  if you will, Parker, what I'd like you to do is this.</p>

  <p>"Drive my car back to London, leaving yours here for me. At about ten or
  so go round to my flat&mdash;I'll give you the address&mdash;and leave the
  car outside the door, where in due course its number will be noted by the
  gentleman on guard. Then go straight indoors&mdash;here is the
  latchkey&mdash;keeping your coat collar turned up and your face away from the
  light. Once inside you will encounter a large and forbidding-looking man
  called Marsh. To him you will hand a letter I will give you, which will say
  that you are stopping the night in the flat, and that <i>he</i> is to put the
  car away in the garage. After that my cellar is yours, but don't go near
  enough to the window to be recognised."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned," remarked the Navy. "It sounds a perfectly riotous
  evening. Is this what I came up from Pompey for?"</p>

  <p>"Anyway, old man," laughed Algy, "it's better than hiding in a gorse bush
  on the Downs, which looks like being our portion."</p>

  <p>"Can't I come too?" pleaded the sailor.</p>

  <p>"No, Jimmy," said the girl firmly. "Algy is right. You've got to do as he
  says."</p>

  <p>"It's big stuff, Parker," put in Algy quietly. "You can take that from
  me."</p>

  <p>"Orl right," said Parker resignedly. "I'll play. What's your bus?"</p>

  <p>"A Lagonda. She can move."</p>

  <p>"And what will you do with mine to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"Leave her in St. James's Square at eleven o'clock."</p>

  <p>"O.K.," said the sailor. "Gawd 'elp all poor blokes at sea. What ho!
  without, mine host. Send in thy tire-maidens bearing foaming goblets. The
  poor, bloody Navy is in the chair."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">XIII. &mdash; BURGLARS IN BATTERSEA</a></h2>

  <p>"And now, bless you, I'm just waiting to hear how you've come into it
  again."</p>

  <p>Algy drew up his chair to the fire and lit a cigarette. Dinner at the
  Black Horse was over, and the sitting-room was empty. Outside, the West
  Sussex darts championship was in full swing; a low hum of conversation,
  punctuated by an occasional jovial laugh, provided the unbeatable setting of
  the old English coaching inn.</p>

  <p>He had arrived there with Alice Blackton an hour before, having first seen
  Jimmy Parker safely on the road to London from Rodsworth. As yet no orders
  had arrived from Drummond, but the night was still young. And until these
  came there was nothing more to be done.</p>

  <p>"There's not much to tell, Algy," said the girl. "But for what there is,
  here goes. Last Wednesday night just before I was starting off for the Golden
  Boot, I happened to go into my landlady's room. She's an awfully nice woman
  is Mrs. Turnbull, and I often go and have a talk with her. On this occasion
  there was another woman with her, and a glance at her face showed that she'd
  been crying.</p>

  <p>"Of course I felt a bit embarrassed, and was on the point of going out
  again when Mrs. Turnbull suddenly turned to me.</p>

  <p>"'What's the name of the man who owns the Golden Boot, dearie?' she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"'Burton,' I said. 'Charles Burton. Why?'</p>

  <p>"She looked at the other woman triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"'What did I tell you?' she cried. 'I was sure I knew the name. This is
  Mrs. Cartwright, dear. Sit down and have a cup of tea.'</p>

  <p>"Well, Mrs. Cartwright was an elderly body who looked rather like a
  prosperous cook, and, under ordinary circumstances, I should have made some
  excuse. But the instant I heard dear Charles' name, I determined to hear
  more. So I sat down.</p>

  <p>"'A devil he is&mdash;that Burton,' sniffed Mrs. Cartwright. 'You be
  careful of him, my dear.'</p>

  <p>"'What's he done to you, Mrs. Cartwright?' I asked.</p>

  <p>"'It's her 'usband,' explained Mrs. Turnbull, 'two h's in succession
  generally defeat her, poor dear. Tell Miss Blackton, Amelia.'</p>

  <p>"So Amelia, bless her heart, gave tongue. I won't attempt to give it
  verbatim, but what it boiled down to was this. Her husband, Samuel
  Cartwright, was a working watch and clock maker, living down Battersea way.
  And some months ago he'd begun to dabble in politics in a mild way. At first
  she'd been rather pleased; it kept him quiet, and got him out of the house.
  But after a while she began to notice a change in him. He became morose and
  secretive, and what upset her most of all was that he began to ask some funny
  sort of men to their house&mdash;men she didn't like at all. And when she
  reasoned with him about it he used to fly into a passion.</p>

  <p>"Another thing, too, that worried her was this. In their little backyard
  he had a shed where he did a lot of his work. In the past the door had always
  been open, and she had never thought twice about walking in if she wanted to
  ask him anything. And then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, he had begun to
  keep the door locked.</p>

  <p>"That there was something on his mind, was obvious, but try as she would
  she couldn't find out what it was. His appetite fell away. He began to sleep
  badly and, in short, the man was clearly ill. But any suggestion of a doctor
  was met with a flat refusal.</p>

  <p>"'Not that a doctor would have done any good,' as she admitted. 'Sam's
  trouble was in his mind.'</p>

  <p>"And then, a few days before I met her, matters had come to a head. Sam
  had announced his intention of going down to the country for the
  night&mdash;alone. Well, I gathered from Mrs. Sam that such a proceeding was
  almost as amazing as the descent of Nelson into Trafalgar Square. He loathed
  and detested the country; even on Bank Holidays Epping Forest was the
  farthest he would ever go. And here he was proposing to venture forth alone
  into places full of uncharted terrors. Moreover&mdash;and this is what upset
  her most&mdash;she was convinced he didn't want to go. He was going because
  he had to.</p>

  <p>"So the old girl decided to get at the bottom of matters once for all. She
  couldn't follow him herself, since he'd have recognised her&mdash;but she got
  hold of a young nephew whom Sam didn't know. And, having pointed Sam out to
  the boy, she gave him some money and told him off to do the job.</p>

  <p>"The boy was a cockney and quick on the uptake, and had no difficulty over
  following his uncle. And, my dear Watson, you will have no difficulty in
  guessing where Sam went to&mdash;Charles Burton's house near Pulborough.</p>

  <p>"By this time I was beginning to look at my watch, for the old girl had
  taken about half an hour to get that lot off her chest. But it was important
  to hear everything, so I stayed on. And it appeared that far from his visit
  to the country having done Sam any good, it had made him much worse. The very
  night he came back he started shouting, 'I won't; I won't,' in his sleep, and
  woke up bathed in perspiration.</p>

  <p>"So the next day she really got down to it with him. And this time,
  apparently, he proved a bit more amenable, and she did get something out of
  him It appeared that, without intending to, he had got mixed up in some
  secret society, and they were compelling him to do something he didn't want
  to do. That he hadn't known when he joined them what they really were, and
  that now it was too late to draw back. But what the something was he wouldn't
  tell her."</p>

  <p>Alice Blackton lit another cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Now that was last Friday week&mdash;five days before I met Mrs.
  Cartwright. And it struck me, of course, that it was vital to let Captain
  Drummond know at once. I'd had a line from him, saying where I could get hold
  of him&mdash;Mr. Hudson, c/o G.P.O., Petworth&mdash;and I was just wondering
  whether to write him before going to the Golden Boot, when the door opened
  and in walked Sam himself. He'd come to fetch his wife, and I took stock of
  him.</p>

  <p>"Algy, if ever a man was frightened unto death, he was that man. He must
  have lost stones in weight, if his clothes were any criterion; they hung on
  him like sacks. His hands were shaking, and he reeked of whisky. So, after a
  moment or two, I got up and left, and that was that up till last Wednesday
  night."</p>

  <p>"You got it all through to Hugh?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"Next day."</p>

  <p>"And has anything else happened?"</p>

  <p>"One thing. On Friday&mdash;that's the day before yesterday&mdash;Mrs.
  Turnbull came into my sitting-room about lunch time.</p>

  <p>"'You remember Mrs. Cartwright, miss,' she said.</p>

  <p>"'Of course,' I cried. 'What about her?'</p>

  <p>"'Samuel's going down to the country again to-morrow,' she said. 'And
  Amelia is fair worried to death.'</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," remarked Algy thoughtfully. "That is&mdash;yesterday. And
  last night a man was killed. Things become clearer, my dear."</p>

  <p>"Can it be him, Algy?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"Anything can be anything with this crowd," he answered. "But it's now
  obvious why Hugh wanted you. You're the only player on our side who can
  identify the poor devil."</p>

  <p>He rose and strolled over to the window.</p>

  <p>"Thank the Lord, it isn't raining," he said. "The stars are out, and with
  luck it will keep fine. Hullo! what do you want?"</p>

  <p>A young farm-hand was standing by the door, fingering his cap.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Longworth?" he said.</p>

  <p>Algy nodded.</p>

  <p>"Bloke called 'Udson told me to give you this. Said as 'ow you'd give me
  'alf-a-dollar if I did."</p>

  <p>Algy held out his hand for the note, with the coin in view.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, my lad," he said. "Thank you. And shut the door when you go
  out."</p>

  <p>He came back to the fire, slitting open the envelope. "Orders, my
  dear&mdash;at last."</p>

  <p>He grinned faintly as he looked at them.</p>

  <p>"Got a warm coat, my love? You'll need one."</p>

  <p>"What does he say?"</p>

  <blockquote style="font-style:italic">
    "'Be at the cross-roads quarter of a mile north of main entrance to
    Birchington Towers by eleven p.m. Remain in car, which hide in entrance to
    quarry. No lights. If nothing happened by three, return London. HUD.'
  </blockquote>

  <p>"There you are, my dear. Terse and to the point. And it looks like four
  hours of fun and laughter for the chaps."</p>

  <p>"You know where it is?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I know the quarry," said Algy, once again crossing over to the window.
  "It's not going to be too bad; you can do a bit of shut-eye under the
  rug."</p>

  <p>And as it turned out the night proved almost muggy. Punctually at eleven
  Algy backed the car into the narrow track that led to the sand quarry, taking
  it far enough in not to be visible in the lights of any passing car. Away to
  the right, on the high ground, lay Birchington Towers, almost invisible in
  the trees. Only a faint general light gave its position, and after a time
  that was extinguished.</p>

  <p>Occasionally a car roared past on the main road homeward bound, but they
  grew fewer and fewer, and when midnight chimed out across the low ground from
  a neighbouring church, the whole countryside seemed asleep.</p>

  <p>Interminably the time dragged by. Alice Blackton, tucked up in the back of
  the car, was dozing, but Algy afraid of doing likewise, kept on sentry go
  between the car and the road. And he was just wondering if he dared risk a
  cigarette under cover of some bushes, when he heard, in the distance, the
  sound of a car coming from the direction of the Downs. It came nearer; then
  abruptly the engine stopped.</p>

  <p>He waited; peering along the road. Once he thought he heard footsteps, but
  it might have been imagination. And it came as a shock, when, from close
  beside him, he suddenly heard a low voice.</p>

  <p>"That you, Algy?"</p>

  <p>It was Hugh Drummond; small wonder he'd heard no sound.</p>

  <p>"Here I am," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Got the girl?"</p>

  <p>"She's in the back of the car. I'll wake her."</p>

  <p>But she was already with them, and Drummond shook hands.</p>

  <p>"Good for you, Alice," he said. "Leave your car here, and we'll get into
  Peter's, which is down the road."</p>

  <p>"What's happened, Hugh?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"As I thought, they moved the body to-night. I had Peter and Toby watching
  one drive, and Ted the other. They brought him out in a large car, and
  they've dumped him in some wooded ground on top of Bury Hill. Then the car
  went on towards London. Peter knows the exact spot where they left the road.
  And that is our destination now. Sorry I've got to ask you to do it, Alice,
  but you're the only one of us who can. Ahoy, Peter..."</p>

  <p>A car, standing in the road, loomed out of the darkness.</p>

  <p>"You don't know Miss Blackton, do you...Mr. Darrell...Let's get to
  it..."</p>

  <p>"Where's Toby?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"On guard by the wood," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>They settled into the car, and Peter drove off. It was just a quarter to
  one and they did not meet a soul in the four-mile run; the only sound they
  heard was a dog barking furiously in a farm they passed. And at the top of
  Bury Hill they stopped.</p>

  <p>To their right stretched the open Downs, and it was from here that after a
  moment or two Toby Sinclair materialised.</p>

  <p>"O.K., Toby?" cried Drummond.</p>

  <p>"O.K. Shall I lead the way?"</p>

  <p>He plunged into the trees, and Drummond took Alice Blackton by the
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Careful, my dear," he said. "We don't want you spraining your ankle."</p>

  <p>It was not far to go; the body had been dumped about thirty yards from the
  road, in an open grass clearing. Actually it was hidden from the road itself,
  though anyone going a few feet into the trees would see it.</p>

  <p>"Clever," said Drummond quietly. "They don't mind it being found; that's
  why they haven't concealed it. He died naturally just like Jimmy Latimer, and
  a man who dies naturally don't hide himself He was hiking...You see his boots
  are dirty, and his clothes sodden with rain&mdash;though there hasn't been
  any since this morning...Probably put the poor devil in a bath before they
  started...Well, Alice?"</p>

  <p>He switched his torch on the dead man's face, and the girl shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "It's Samuel Cartwright, all right..."</p>

  <p>"I'd have betted on it," remarked Drummond. "Well, there's no more to be
  done here, so we may as well go home."</p>

  <p>"But aren't you going to do anything about it?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"What can we do, my dear?" said Drummond. "Nothing can bring him back to
  life. And the instant the matter is mentioned to the police, we've got to
  come into it. Which is the thing of all others I want to avoid."</p>

  <p>"Have you been through his pockets, Hugh?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"With a vacuum cleaner. And found nothing. Come on, chaps. You can drop
  me, Peter, at the quarry..."</p>

  <p>"And what are we to do to-morrow?" asked Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Play a round in the morning, and come up to London in the afternoon.
  There's nothing more to be done down here."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Go up to-night with Algy...Hell!" he muttered. "To think that poor
  blighter knew what I'd give my eyes to know..."</p>

  <p>He relapsed into silence till the car drew up at the entrance to the
  quarry.</p>

  <p>"Night-night, boys," he said. "I'll get in touch with you to-morrow."</p>

  <p>He watched Darrell's tail lamp disappear; then he walked towards Algy's
  car.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he cried. "What's this bus? Good for you," he continued, after
  Algy's explanation. "We'll go to Heppel Street and our Mrs. Penny for what's
  left of the night."</p>

  <p>And they were running into London before he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Mrs. Cartwright's address, Alice?"</p>

  <p>"No. But I can easily get it from Mrs. Turnbull."</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking of that shed," said Drummond. "That shed in the backyard.
  I'd like to see inside that shed very much."</p>

  <p>"Well, as I say, I can get the address quite easily."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would. But you mustn't say that Cartwright's dead. That's a
  thing you know nothing about. It's our best chance, Algy," he continued
  thoughtfully. "That poor devil knew enough for them to kill him. Has he left
  any record behind?"</p>

  <p>"The only way to find out is to go see," said Algy.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. But how to do it is the point. Once Mrs. Cartwright realises her
  husband is dead she's going up in steam. In addition the police will be
  buzzing round like a swarm of bees. Burglary, old boy, is the only hope. I'll
  think it over and let you know later. But the first and main thing is the
  address."</p>

  <p>And that, as Alice had prophesied, presented no difficulty. It transpired
  next day over the telephone to Mrs. Turnbull, that Mrs. Cartwright lived in a
  street off the Albert Bridge Road, and, moreover, that she would be at home
  that night. Further, that she was worried to death over Sam's continued
  absence.</p>

  <p>"It's going to be a little awkward for Burton," said Algy, "if she goes to
  the police. She'll tell 'em he was going to Birchington Towers, and, when his
  body is ultimately discovered on Bury Hill, what does Charles say?"</p>

  <p>"That he never arrived," answered Drummond promptly. "That he knows
  nothing about the man at all. That from enquiries he has made a man with some
  fancied grievance asked for an interview last week, but was turned away, and
  on identification of the body by one of his servants it transpires that it is
  the same individual. No, Algy&mdash;they won't catch Charles that way. You
  see there will be no trace of murder on Samuel...And if the widow mentions
  his nervous state, the answer is that obviously it was some strange case of
  hallucination. What could Charles Burton have to do with a clockmaker in the
  Albert Bridge Road?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," said Algy. "So what do we do about it?"</p>

  <p>"Will you still help us, Alice?" asked Drummond. "Of course," she
  answered.</p>

  <p>"Your job this evening is to keep Mrs. Cartwright occupied whilst I
  explore that shed. If necessary take that female of yours&mdash;Mrs.
  Turnbull&mdash;with you; in fact it will seem more natural if you do. Algy
  will come with me, and will be on hand in case you should want him."</p>

  <p>"What time shall I go there?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest nine o'clock. And keep the lady occupied for an hour."</p>

  <p>"That won't be difficult," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"Your excuse for going, naturally, is her husband. You can invent some
  stuff about Burton to keep her interested, but don't, under any
  circumstances, let her come into the shed..."</p>

  <p>"Right," she nodded. "I'll do just what you say."</p>

  <p>"Grand girl! Jane!" he shouted, and Mrs. Penny waddled in. "I'll want some
  lunch to-day, my pet," he announced. "And Mr. Longworth and I will be
  sleeping here to-night."</p>

  <p>"That'll be all right, Mr. Hugh...And the young lady?"</p>

  <p>"I think you'd better lunch here too, Alice, and not go back to your rooms
  till later."</p>

  <p>"Just as you like," she said. "I could do with some more sleep."</p>

  <p>"Algy, you take the car to St. James's Square&mdash;and then come back
  here. We've got to alter your appearance before to-night."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do, old boy?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"A little spot of exploration," said Drummond with a grin. "My knowledge
  of the Albert Bridge Road is not all it might be. But I shan't go till after
  lunch."</p>

  <p>It was six o'clock when he returned in excellent spirits.</p>

  <p>"Luck is in," he announced. "I do not think our burglarious adventure is
  going to be very difficult."</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock Alice Blackton left; at eight, two typical dockyard
  natives slouched out of Number 10, Heppel Street, and were soon lost in the
  busy traffic of Tottenham Court Road.</p>

  <p>"There is a pub of reasonable excellence, Algy," said the larger of the
  two, "not far from our destination, where we might while away a few fleeting
  seconds. And then&mdash;what luck? I wonder..."</p>

  <p>It was just after nine that they swung out of the saloon bar and slouched
  along the street towards the Cartwrights' house. A few scattered groups were
  congregated under the lamp posts, but the night was raw and most of the
  inhabitants were indoors. The houses were small, but the street was in no
  sense a slum. Shops alternated with private dwellings, and suddenly Algy saw
  on the other side of the road the notice&mdash;"S. CARTWRIGHT, WORKING
  CLOCKMAKER."</p>

  <p>Drummond led him on about fifty yards; then he abruptly crossed over, and
  retraced his footsteps slowly. A wireless was blaring forth from an open
  window as they passed, but no pedestrians seemed near at hand. And with a
  quick movement Drummond turned into a narrow path along a fence that
  terminated in a wooden door.</p>

  <p>"The back entrance," he whispered.</p>

  <p>Cautiously he pushed the door open and in a second they were both through
  with it closed behind them.</p>

  <p>"The yard," he muttered. "And there's the shed in front of us."</p>

  <p>From above their heads light was filtering out from a curtained window,
  and they could hear the sound of women's voices. Evidently Alice and Mrs.
  Turnbull had arrived and were holding the fort.</p>

  <p>Like a shadow Drummond moved over to the shed, and for the fraction of a
  second a pin-point of light shone on the lock. Then it was extinguished, and
  he jumbled in his pocket. Came one short sharp crack, which sounded like a
  pistol shot to Algy, and the door flew open.</p>

  <p>They paused motionless; had it been heard? But no sign came from the
  neighbouring houses, and the faint drone of voices from Mrs. Cartwright's
  room was still audible. From his pocket Drummond took two pieces of felt and
  pinned them over the cobwebby windows. Then he closed the door and made Algy
  stand with his back against the crack.</p>

  <p>"We must chance the rest," he said, switching on his torch, and letting
  the beam play around.</p>

  <p>It was a small shed, not much larger than a bathing-hut. The whole of one
  side was occupied by a bench, on which was fitted the ordinary implements of
  the owner's trade. A large open box containing drills and other tools stood
  in one corner, and two upturned packing-cases apparently constituted the
  seating accommodation. Of papers there was no sign.</p>

  <p>The walls were bare of shelves or cupboards; there was no drawer in the
  bench. And with a muttered curse Drummond was on the point of giving it up,
  when he gave a sudden exclamation. A board under his foot had moved. He
  turned his torch on to it; it was loose. And even as he did so there came the
  sound of a door closing gently, somewhere close by...</p>

  <p>He switched off his torch and straightened up. He could hear Algy's
  breathing; otherwise everything was silent. And suddenly it struck him that
  the voices from the house had ceased.</p>

  <p>He moved over to Algy, and pulled him back against the bench.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear that?" he breathed.</p>

  <p>"Yes," came the answer. "Back door, I think."</p>

  <p>"Take the torch. Switch on if I tell you."</p>

  <p>They waited tensely; outside a twig snapped. And then came the sound of
  fingers fumbling at the door, followed by a stifled exclamation of surprise.
  The newcomer had evidently discovered the broken lock.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two he hesitated; then very cautiously the door was pushed
  open inch by inch, and framed in the faint light they could see the outline
  of a crouching man. At length he was in, with the door closed behind him.</p>

  <p>As it happened he missed them both as he moved forward. Then he knelt down
  and they could hear him fumbling on the floor. He was breathing heavily, and
  muttering imprecations to himself. And at last he struck a match.</p>

  <p>His back was towards them, and beyond him they could see a dark cavity in
  the floor. The board Drummond had trodden on had been removed, and from the
  hole underneath the man was pulling out some documents. He did not trouble to
  examine them, but just laid them beside the opening. Then, having satisfied
  himself that he had the lot, he replaced the board and stood up.</p>

  <p>Which so far as he was concerned constituted the end of a perfect day. He
  felt two vice-like hands grip his neck; was aware dimly through the roaring
  in his ears that a torch was flashing on his face&mdash;and then blackness.
  And he was quite unconscious when he was deposited in a corner.</p>

  <p>"Saves bother," said Drummond, cramming the papers in his pocket. "He
  won't come to for half an hour."</p>

  <p>He was crossing the yard as he spoke and suddenly he paused.</p>

  <p>"They've stopped talking, Algy," he whispered, "which is unlike women.
  We'd better go and see."</p>

  <p>The back door was open, and they crept into the passage. In front of them
  light was shining out from a half-shut door, and they stopped outside it;
  stopped to see reflected in a mirror a woman sitting in a chair, whose
  terrified eyes met theirs from above the gag in her mouth.</p>

  <p>"Just in time," muttered Drummond as he entered.</p>

  <p>A man, who had been leaning out of the window, swung round and stared at
  them, his jaw dropping as he did so. And then, he too was spared any further
  worry for a space. Drummond was not wasting time though this one struggled
  more than his friend outside.</p>

  <p>"Undo the women, Algy," he said, as he dropped his limp opponent on the
  floor.</p>

  <p>They were all three there, tightly bound and gagged. "They came in
  suddenly on us," said Alice Blackton as she stood up. "Have you got the
  other?</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Drummond. "I don't know who you ladies are," he continued,
  staring straight at her, "but if I was you I'd go home before the police
  come."</p>

  <p>The emphasis was clear and she nodded.</p>

  <p>"And if your name comes out you must disappear for a time."</p>

  <p>Again she nodded, and then smiled faintly at the outburst in the corner.
  For it was going to be even money whether Mrs. Cartwright or Mrs. Turnbull
  had hysterics first.</p>

  <p>"Come back with us, lovey," sobbed Mrs. Turnbull, "and we'll telephone the
  police from my house."</p>

  <p>"I couldn't stop here," sniffed Mrs. Cartwright. "In my own parlour
  too."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," whispered Drummond to the girl. "Get 'em back. And postpone
  telephoning as long as you can. If possible I <i>don't</i> want these men
  caught. And, of course, you don't know us..."</p>

  <p>He beckoned to Algy and they faded silently away.</p>

  <p>"Much better if they are not caught," he repeated as they walked along the
  street. "For if they are, Burton will know they've failed; but if they're
  not, they'll pretend they've succeeded and destroyed the papers."</p>

  <p>"Where to now?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"Back to Heppel Street to examine our catch," said Drummond, hailing a
  taxi. "Jove! Algy, what we'd have done without those two girls in this show
  don't bear thinking about."</p>

  <p>They were met at the door by Mrs. Penny.</p>

  <p>"That gentleman that lunched with you the other day, dearie," she said,
  "rang up half an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"Ginger Lawson," said Drummond to Algy. "What did he want, Jane?"</p>

  <p>"To see you, Master Hugh. I said you were out and he's coming round at
  eleven."</p>

  <p>"Ten-thirty now. All right, Jane. Show him in when he comes. Now, Algy,
  let's get to it."</p>

  <p>He drew up a chair to the table, and from his pocket he pulled out the
  bundle of papers. There were five in all, and picking up the first he opened
  it.</p>

  <p>It was a blue print such as is common in engineering plans. But this one
  seemed to consist entirely of wheels and springs. There was one central
  diagram, and a series of smaller ones which seemed to represent parts of the
  main design enlarged. Drummond stared at it; then he suddenly rose and
  pressed the bell.</p>

  <p>"Jane," he said, "do we patronise Petworth's Fruit Salad?"</p>

  <p>"I've got a tin in the house now, dearie."</p>

  <p>"Then bring it here, like an angel," he cried. "Don't open it."</p>

  <p>Somewhat mystified, the old dame retired and brought the tin.</p>

  <p>"All right, Jane, leave it here. As I thought, Algy," he said when she had
  gone, "it's the exact size of the central diagram. This is the print of the
  mechanism we got from Maier's house in Switzerland&mdash;or at any rate,
  something of the same type."</p>

  <p>"On which, presumably, Cartwright was working," remarked Algy.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. But since we've got the actual machine itself, the print
  doesn't seem of much importance, except that it brings the actual doings to
  England. Let's go on."</p>

  <p>The second and third were in the nature of lists of stores. They were
  compiled in pencil with numerous erasion and alterations. 250 No. 1 wheels
  had been altered to 320; 150 D. springs had been half rubbed out and the
  number 200 substituted; 1,000 nuts various were a few of many similar
  items.</p>

  <p>"It fits in so far, Algy," said Drummond, lighting a cigarette. "Even to
  my limited brain it is obvious that there are not 150 D. springs, whatever a
  D. spring may be, in that one machine. Therefore Cartwright was employed in
  making a number of them. And I think we can take as a working theory that Mr.
  Maier of Veytaux was the original pebble on the beach. He it was who designed
  the first mechanism&mdash;the one that he kept, and which for some reason or
  other was stolen from him the night he was murdered, and which we've now got.
  Why they murdered him, we don't know&mdash;since he must have been in their
  confidence to start with. Perhaps he started opening his mouth too wide;
  perhaps he threatened them. Anyway, that doesn't matter. Maier produced the
  original, a blue print of which was sent to Cartwright to copy. How's
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Sounds perfectly feasible to me," answered Algy.</p>

  <p>"So let us to Number 4," said Drummond. "By Jove! Algy," he cried
  excitedly. "Look. One of the very papers Jimmy Latimer got hold of."</p>

  <p>He spread it out and they both pored over it. It was an outline map of
  England and Scotland, with dots sprinkled all over it. No names were printed
  at all, but it was easy to see that the dots represented towns. And as Madame
  P&eacute;lain had said, they were far more numerous in the Midlands and north than
  in the south.</p>

  <p>Against some of them numbers in red were written. And the area so filled
  in on the map before them comprised Bristol and the South of Wales, and a few
  isolated ones in Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. Further, in the margin, was a
  total which read 320.</p>

  <p>"And we have 320 No. 1 wheels," said Drummond thoughtfully. "Listen, Algy.
  In the map Madame P&eacute;lain saw, these numbers were entered everywhere&mdash;not
  only in one district. What do you make of that?"</p>

  <p>"That the district marked here was Cartwright's? remarked Algy
  promptly.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," agreed Drummond. "In which case, he was only one of several
  employed on the same game&mdash;all working on identical blue prints. Very
  possibly each of them was given a district far removed from where he lives,
  to prevent any personal feeling coming into the matter, and the finished map
  is never seen by the underlings."</p>

  <p>Algy nodded.</p>

  <p>"It all sounds perfectly feasible to me," he said.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, there's nothing wildly fantastic so far," remarked Drummond,
  picking up the last paper. "What's this?" he said, staring at it. "Helverton;
  where or what the deuce is Helverton?"</p>

  <p>There came the sound of voices in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Ginger," he called out. "You arrive in the nick of time. Where,
  or what, or why is Helverton?"</p>

  <p>Ginger Lawson stood in the doorway eyeing him queerly.</p>

  <p>"Strange you should ask that," he said at length. "Helverton is a village
  in Cornwall, near which there have been strange doings of late. So strange
  that it's filtered through to the Yard."</p>

  <p>It was Drummond's turn to stare.</p>

  <p>"What sort of doings?"</p>

  <p>"They say that a headland not far from the village is haunted, and
  undoubtedly a man who went out to investigate was found dead."</p>

  <p>"How did he die?"</p>

  <p>Ginger Lawson closed the door.</p>

  <p>"He was washed ashore four days later. The body was beginning to
  decompose, and the natural assumption was that he had been drowned. But when
  they came to examine him more closely, they came to the amazing conclusion
  that he had been burned, if not to death, at any rate very near it."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; THE TRAIL NARROWS</a></h2>

  <p>He came on into the room.</p>

  <p>"And how, might I ask, did <i>you</i> come to hear of Helverton?"</p>

  <p>In silence Drummond pushed the documents over to him, and Lawson studied
  them.</p>

  <p>"Where did these come from?" he said at length.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman who was murdered the night before last by Burton," answered
  Drummond. "His body, which may or may not have been discovered by now, is in
  a wood on the top of Bury Hill in Sussex. Unfortunately his death, as in
  Jimmy's case, will, apparently, have been due to natural causes."</p>

  <p>"Who was the man?" asked Ginger.</p>

  <p>"Samuel Cartwright&mdash;if that conveys anything to you. A working
  clock-maker, old boy "&mdash;and Drummond put a significant finger on the
  blue print. "We're getting warm, Ginger," he continued. "Unless I'm much
  mistaken, that print represents Maier's model. And that district"&mdash;he
  pointed to the map&mdash;"is Cartwright's district. Now we happen to know
  that Cartwright joined some so-called political society a few months ago. We
  also know that recently he has been an extremely worried and nervy man. And
  now he's dead. What do you make of it?"</p>

  <p>"That he showed signs of splitting and had to be put out of the way," said
  Lawson.</p>

  <p>"Exactly. Now take that figure 320. My idea is that he had to make 320
  similar machines to the one we took from Maier's house. Other people in other
  districts had to make their quotas also, so that the total would be
  sufficient to account for the whole map. And then these various contributions
  have been or will be collected at one central depot."</p>

  <p>"And after that?"</p>

  <p>"I wonder if it would be possible," said Drummond thoughtfully, "to find
  out if any large order from a new customer has been given recently for
  Petworth's Fancy Quality Fruit Salad?"</p>

  <p>"It could probably be done," answered Lawson.</p>

  <p>"And where it's been despatched to...Ginger," he continued gravely. "I'm
  no ruddy engineer. But what would be the result if you took a dynamo or a
  fly-wheel, rotating at speed, and exploded a bomb on one of its
  bearings?"</p>

  <p>"Hell let loose backwards, I should say. The whole thing would fly to
  pieces and smash up the entire shooting-box."</p>

  <p>"Just what I thought," said Drummond. "We've got to find where that
  central depot is."</p>

  <p>"What price this place&mdash;Helverton?" remarked Algy. "Why such a remote
  spot?" objected Lawson.</p>

  <p>"Ask me another," said Drummond. "But it's a strange
  coincidence&mdash;this paper, and what you've just told us about the man
  being burned."</p>

  <p>"Didn't you find out anything about the island of Varda?"</p>

  <p>"Algy, with great brilliance, took that on. Both Burton and Menalin
  reacted to it."</p>

  <p>"So Ronald is on the track," said Lawson.</p>

  <p>"What news of him? I've heard nothing except that he's escaped."</p>

  <p>"That's the main reason that I came round to see you," answered Lawson.
  "Somehow or other he got away from the place where Menalin was holding him as
  a prisoner, and swam out to a private yacht. He must have heard Varda
  mentioned in the house before he escaped, I suppose. Anyway he got a wire
  through to me from the yacht, whose owner he must have bluffed into keeping
  him. And he's on his way home now..."</p>

  <p>"What about Gasdon?"</p>

  <p>"He was knifed in Paris as he drove in. He was taken to hospital, but I
  gather it's not serious." Drummond shook both his fists in the air.</p>

  <p>"By God! Ginger&mdash;what a day of reckoning there's going to be. And
  it's not going to be put off long, either. In fact, I seem to feel that the
  overture is playing for the last act..."</p>

  <p>With eyes half closed he stared across the smoke-filled room.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember what I told you once, that strange vision of a fleeting
  second that I had in the Golden Boot? It's coming; I know it. And it will be
  battle, murder and sudden death before we get through to the end..."</p>

  <p>"What about bringing in the police now?"</p>

  <p>"We can't, Ginger&mdash;yet...We don't <i>know.</i> It's all guess work.
  We've <i>got</i> to find out first. Otherwise we'll merely put them on their
  guard."</p>

  <p>"And how do you propose to do so?"</p>

  <p>"Go to Helverton. I'll take Algy and Peter with me. This <i>can't</i> be
  coincidence."</p>

  <p>"I wish to Heaven I could come with you," said Lawson.</p>

  <p>"I know you do, old man but you can't. If Ronald arrives, or Gasdon, tell
  them where I am. I'll keep in touch with you. I'll send you a wire every day,
  signed H U D with just the day of the week on it. If you don't get it you'll
  know something has happened, and you can get gay."</p>

  <p>Ginger Lawson nodded, and rose.</p>

  <p>"Trust me, Hugh. How shall I get at you if I want to?"</p>

  <p>"Where is this place, Helverton?"</p>

  <p>"On the coast&mdash;not far from Bodmin."</p>

  <p>"Then send anything you want to Hudson at the post office, Bodmin,
  Night-night, old boy...We shall start to-morrow."</p>

  <p>He came back into the room after he had locked the front door.</p>

  <p>"It's big stuff this time, Algy," he said quietly. "Very big. I think
  we're going to get our money's worth. Ring Peter up at his pub to-morrow
  morning, and tell him to motor straight to Exeter. Chuck over that A.A.
  book...Here's a one star pub. He is to go to the Lowestoft and wait for us
  there. I'll bring a a gun for him and a disguise."</p>

  <p>And when Algy went to bed five minutes later, Drummond was still sitting
  hunched in his chair staring at the embers of the dying fire.
  Strange&mdash;this premonition of his, for he was one of the least fanciful
  men in the world. But try as he would he could not shake it off. And the
  thought that worried him was whether he was justified in what he had said to
  Ginger Lawson about the police...Was he justified in trying to tackle the
  show on his own?</p>

  <p>That he was itching to get at it was neither here nor there. But supposing
  they got him and Peter and Algy&mdash;what then? There might be
  delay&mdash;fatal delay. On the other hand, if the police started making
  enquiries Menalin and Burton might close the whole thing down for a time, and
  come back with it again later under more favourable conditions.</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette and poured out some more beer. Balancing the two
  alternatives he felt he was right. The delay would not be great if he had bad
  luck; just one day when Ginger got no wire. And, in any event, he felt
  certain that there was one big point he would be able to clear up. Was this
  village of Helverton a spot of importance, or not?</p>

  <p>At the bottom of his mind he felt it must be. That Cartwright&mdash;a
  confirmed Cockney should have troubled to write down the name of an obscure
  Cornish village without some good reason, seemed very improbable. And, even
  if he had, why put the paper with documents connected with the other affair?
  This mystery, too, of the burned man...</p>

  <p>"Helverton has it," he muttered to himself. "All Lombard Street to a china
  orange on it...Go to bed, my boy, go to bed."</p>

  <p>It was Algy who woke him the next morning at nine o'clock.</p>

  <p>"I've just got through to Peter," he said. "He lost three quid to Ted
  yesterday, and is blaspheming with rage at not getting it back this morning.
  He's going straight to Exeter."</p>

  <p>"Well done, Algy. So we shan't want another car there. Go and look up the
  trains, while I dress."</p>

  <p>"There's a ten-thirty-five from Paddington," sang out Algy from the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't be better," answered Drummond. "We will honour it with our
  presence."</p>

  <p>Gone completely were the doubts of last night; life was just a hundred per
  cent.</p>

  <p>"Money, fool," he roared. "Have we any? If not, go out and cash your
  maintenance order."</p>

  <p>"Is forty quid enough to keep you in beer?"</p>

  <p>"No. Tell Jane I'll be down in ten minutes. And, Algy, look in the papers
  and see if they've found the body on Bury Hill."</p>

  <p>Came a pause and then Algy's voice:</p>

  <p>"Don't see any sign of it. But there's a paragraph here about last
  night."</p>

  <p>He came upstairs with the paper in his hand.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "'A strange outrage occurred last night at the house of Mrs. Samuel
    Cartwright, who lives near the Royal Albert road. She was entertaining two
    friends after supper when the house was entered by two men, who bound and
    gagged all three of them. One of the men remained on guard, whilst the
    other went into the yard at the back.<br>
    <br>
    "'Shortly afterwards two other men appeared..."
  </blockquote>

  <p>"Damn!" said Drummond. "I'd hoped we might have been left out of it. Go
  on."</p>

  <blockquote>
    "'...appeared, who overpowered the man on guard and stunned him. Then
    having set free the three ladies these men disappeared. Mrs. Cartwright,
    who was overcome with the shock, accompanied her friends to their house,
    from where she rang up the police, who at once went to the scene of the
    outrage. Unfortunately they were too late; the house was empty, the
    miscreants had fled.<br>
    <br>
    "'The motive of the crime is obscure. The door of a shed in the yard, which
    is used by Mr. Cartwright, a clock-maker, and at present away from home,
    had been forced. But since nothing had apparently been taken from it, or
    from the house, the whole matter is difficult to understand.<br>
    <br>
    "'Unfortunately, the descriptions of the men, as given by Mrs. Cartwright,
    are so vague as to be almost valueless. The most she can say is that the
    second pair, who liberated her and her friends, looked like dockyard
    hands.'"
  </blockquote>

  <p>"Good up to a point," said Drummond, brushing his hair. "There's no
  mention of Alice. But I wonder if the old girl said anything about Burton.
  And the police have suppressed it. For if so, Master Charles won't feel so
  good, when Cartwright's body is found and identified."</p>

  <p>"He can still bluff it," remarked Algy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes! he can still bluff it," agreed Drummond. "But I've got a sort of
  idea that our Charles is not quite as happy as he was. After you went up for
  your bath on Saturday night, he and Menalin were having a little heart to
  heart chat in the hall..."</p>

  <p>"Was it you," interrupted Algy, "that Molly saw looking through the window
  by the front door?"</p>

  <p>"Who the hell did you think it was? An anthroppoidal ape? As I say, they
  were having a little chat. I couldn't, of course, hear what they said, but it
  struck me that Burton was a bit worried."</p>

  <p>"He was damned silent during the early part of dinner," said Algy.</p>

  <p>"So Talbot told me. By the same token," he added with a grin, "it strikes
  me that Captain Talbot would not be averse to a spot of walking out with
  little Molly Castledon. I definitely caught the love-light in his eyes when
  discussing her. And before breakfast, too, which takes a lot of getting
  round."</p>

  <p>"How on earth did you manage to get him there?"</p>

  <p>"A sheer lucky break. A pal of Denny's was engaged, so I wangled the
  change. You see, Algy, I didn't know you were going there for the
  week-end...Let us to our eggs."</p>

  <p>"I'm still in the dark as to why he asked me."</p>

  <p>"To pump you about me, of course. And, my dear old lad, you did
  magnificently. Talbot swears that he distinctly heard Burton tell Menalin
  that you were a cross between a Mongolian idiot and that monkey at the zoo
  with the purple bottom. Jane darling&mdash;don't listen. Algy would like a
  tumbler of your red currant wine&mdash;hot."</p>

  <p>"You're very rude about my red currant wine, Master Hugh," said Jane
  indignantly.</p>

  <p>"Jealousy, my sweet; jealousy." He peered suspiciously at his plate. "A
  little on this egg might be a good thing; I think the hen gave up half way
  through."</p>

  <p>She snatched up the dish.</p>

  <p>"That there Johnson at the corner," she cried as she sniffed it, "swore
  they were new laid. Leave it to me, dearie."</p>

  <p>"I will, Jane, if you will substitute one of this year's vintage. Your
  baby boy needs building up."</p>

  <p>He picked up one of the papers and opened it.</p>

  <p>"Hullo! Algy," he said quietly. "Here's a little item of possible
  interest. All in the Court Circular column too.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "'Mr. and Mrs. Serge Menalin have left the Ritz-Carlton for a few days'
    tour in the West Country. No letters will be forwarded.'
  </blockquote>

  <p>"Now isn't that strange, boy?" He stared at Algy thoughtfully. "That means
  they went yesterday. And it means another thing as well. Up till then they
  had no reason to be secret over their movements. Until yesterday everything
  in their garden was lovely. Which is all to the good...Long may it
  continue."</p>

  <p>"They'll smell a rat over the account of the Cartwright affair," said
  Algy.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps; perhaps not. I think that if we were in the position of the two
  blokes we laid out, we should pretend that we were the dockyard hands who had
  done the laying. There would be no one to call us liars, and we could pretend
  we'd succeeded."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Come along, Algy; time we pushed off. I've got everything in the
  suit-case."</p>

  <p>"What are we going to be?" demanded Algy.</p>

  <p>"Hikers, old boy. Scout masters in shorts, covered with badges. You'll
  probably have to make a fire by rubbing sticks together. And then we shall
  eat poisoned berries and die, and the robins will cover us with leaves.
  Bye-bye, Jane; don't take in any male lodgers while I'm away."</p>

  <p>They arrived at Exeter to the minute, and sought out the Lowestoft. It was
  a small hotel in a back street, but clean and comfortable, and they found
  Peter in a front room building up nature with something in a glass. And
  having ordered likewise, and closed the door, Drummond produced a half-inch
  ordnance map of Cornwall and spread it on a table.</p>

  <p>"Just as well to get the lie of the country before we start. As the crow
  flies this place Helverton is about fifteen miles from Bodmin, so that,
  judging by the way the road twists, it's about twenty miles by car. To the
  east and west of it the ground rises steeply, so that it really lies in a gap
  in the cliffs."</p>

  <p>"And a bit back from the sea," said Darrell. "Presumably it's a little
  fishing village."</p>

  <p>"In which case the arrival of three strangers will go the rounds,"
  remarked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"We might pretend to be journalists," suggested Algy.</p>

  <p>"Probably lousy with them already over the burned man episode," said
  Drummond. "However, we'll see. Anyway, there's the rough lay-out. Obviously
  the coast is rocky and deserted, except for Helverton itself. Let's get
  changed here, and leave the suit-cases with mine host. Then we'll motor to
  Bodmin, leave the car, and get off the mark."</p>

  <p>Dusk was falling when they arrived at Cornwall's county town, and parked
  the car in a garage.</p>

  <p>"Walking tour?" said the proprietor, scratching his head. "Well, for them
  as likes it, it may be all right. But it ain't my idea of fun. Which way be
  you going?"</p>

  <p>"Thought of starting off from Helverton," answered Drummond.</p>

  <p>"You be on it too, are you?" laughed the other. "The drowned man that was
  burned! Rot&mdash;sez I. Haunted, indeed. Them villagers would imagine
  anything..."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we haven't heard anything about it," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;you will, if you goes there. Won't they, George?"</p>

  <p>A shock-headed individual emerged from the back of a carrier's van.</p>

  <p>"What do'ee say?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"These gents are going to Helverton. I was telling 'em about the
  ghost."</p>

  <p>The van driver spat thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"'Tis more in it, sur, than that," he said. "Be you gentlemen new to these
  'ere parts?"</p>

  <p>"We are," said Drummond. "We're on a walking tour."</p>

  <p>"Well, sur&mdash;if you takes my advice you'll walk elsewhere..."</p>

  <p>He retired inside his van again and the owner of the garage smiled at
  Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Just like the rest of 'em," he said confidentially. "As a matter of fact
  he's going to Helverton to-night. He's the local carrier."</p>

  <p>"The devil he is," remarked Drummond. "I wonder if he'd give us a
  lift."</p>

  <p>"Sure," cried the other. "George&mdash;you'll give these gents a lift,
  won't you?"</p>

  <p>Once more the head emerged.</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;if they're wanting to come. I'm starting now..."</p>

  <p>"Then we'll leave the car here," said Drummond, "and call for it in a few
  days."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir. It'll be quite safe with me."</p>

  <p>The ancient Ford van wheezed into life, and the three men clambered
  inside. A number of motley parcels comprised the load; two big packing-cases
  on the floor afforded some sort of seat. But springs were non-existent, and
  by the time they had crashed and rattled through the night for about a
  quarter of an hour they were all partially winded.</p>

  <p>It was a slow journey. Every mile or so they stopped, and the driver
  appeared and searched for a parcel. This was duly handed to someone in the
  darkness; a book was signed, and the health of everybody's relations was
  discussed at length. But after they had been going for an hour only the two
  packing-cases remained.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the van halted, and Drummond peered through a tear in the cover.
  They seemed to be in the middle of a large open moor; no house or cottage was
  in sight.</p>

  <p>"'Ave to wait 'ere, gennelmen, for them cases to be picked up. Sends a van
  'e does for 'em."</p>

  <p>"How far are we from Helverton?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Two miles, sur..."</p>

  <p>"And who is this who is sending a van?" continued Drummond
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stangerton, sur...The artist...'Im who 'as the 'ouse called Hooting
  Carn...Where the terror is..."</p>

  <p>"What terror?"</p>

  <p>"The ghost, sur..."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Drummond. "You say you have to wait here for the cases to be
  picked up. Have you delivered many before?"</p>

  <p>"A tidy few, sur."</p>

  <p>"Get out of the van," muttered Drummond to Peter and Algy. "Listen,
  George; do you want to earn a pound?"</p>

  <p>"Sure I do, sur."</p>

  <p>"Then don't mention the fact that you've given us three a lift to whoever
  comes for the packing-cases."</p>

  <p>"They be a-coming now, sur. I see the lights."</p>

  <p>In front, a dim grey streak, stretched the road to Helverton; away up to
  the left, coming down from the high ground, were the headlights of a car. And
  as they got out they realised they had stopped at a fork in the road.</p>

  <p>They slipped into a ditch as the car reached the spot and proceeded to
  turn. Then two men who had come in it, assisted by George, lifted each case
  in turn out of the van and put them in a trailer that was attached. A book
  was signed, cartage was paid, and in a minute the car was on its way back up
  the hill.</p>

  <p>"Pretty heavy&mdash;those cases, George?" said Drummond casually.</p>

  <p>"Aye, sur. A tidy weight."</p>

  <p>"And you say you've delivered a good many of 'em?"</p>

  <p>"Them two makes eight, sur."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where they come from?"</p>

  <p>"Different parts, sur. I picks 'em up at the station. Them two came from
  Leeds."</p>

  <p>"I see. Stangerton, you say, is the name of the gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"Ess, sur; that's right."</p>

  <p>"And what's this terror you talk about, George?"</p>

  <p>"'Tis an old fable, sur. My father heard it, and his father afore him.
  'Tis the ghost, they do say, of a Spaniard. Hundreds o' years ago a big
  Spanish ship was in danger of driving ashore here in a gale. And the captain
  'e sold 'isself to old Nick if so be his ship was saved. A wicked man he was,
  and when the officers and crew, who were praying to the Holy Virgin, heard
  what he had done, they threw him overboard. And just as soon as he was in the
  sea the wind shifted and blew them off the lee shore into safety. But the
  captain he was drowned, and his body was washed ashore on the little
  island...And because he had sold 'isself to the devil he can't rest in his
  grave, and his ghost is sometimes seen flitting round Hooting Carn, and
  sometimes on the island itself...And them as sees it had best mind
  out&mdash;for it means death..."</p>

  <p>"That's very interesting, George," said Drummond. "And has it been seen
  much lately?"</p>

  <p>"That be the funny thing, sur," answered the driver. "Just a legend it was
  till a few months ago; I can't rightly recollect anybody who had actually
  seed it. All the chaps used to talk about it at times, but it was alms
  somebody else who had told 'em they'd seed it. And then lots of 'em started
  to see it."</p>

  <p>"Very strange," agreed Drummond quietly. "And what was it they saw?"</p>

  <p>"A yellow figure, sur, that seemed to glide over the ground&mdash;and then
  suddenly disappeared. Afeard they were&mdash;until young Jan Penderby said he
  weren't. Ghost or no ghost he was going to lay it. And 'tis him who is dead.
  Aye, sur&mdash;dead...Drowned they say, but it's burned he was&mdash;just as
  you'd expect. For isn't it the devil himself that Captain Varda sold his soul
  to?"</p>

  <p>"Captain&mdash;who?" Try as he would to speak calmly, Drummond's voice
  shook.</p>

  <p>"Varda, sur. Don Miguel Varda&mdash;his name is on the grave at Hooting
  Carn. The grave from which he walks and into which he disappears."</p>

  <p>"This island you mentioned," said Drummond. "What is it called?"</p>

  <p>"Varda, sur...After the Spaniard...Not that it's really an island; 'tis
  just a big rugged rock that sticks out of the sea eighty yards from the
  cliffs. And sometimes, as I was telling 'ee, the ghost can be seen flitting
  over the top of it for 'twas there he was beaten to death by the waves."</p>

  <p>The van pulled up outside the Jolly Fisherman.</p>

  <p>"Here we be, sur...You'll be hearing all about Jan Penderby from the lads
  inside..." He pocketed his pound note. "Thank 'ee kindly, sur...I'm out here
  every day, if so be there be anything you're wanting."</p>

  <p>The street was long and straggling. Lights filtered out from the cottage
  windows, and in the distance they could hear the lazy roar of breakers on the
  rock. Most of the male population of Helverton seemed to be assembled in the
  bar as they entered, and a sudden silence fell at the appearance of three
  strangers.</p>

  <p>"What about a pint, George?" cried Drummond cheerfully; and the arrival of
  the carrier broke the awkward pause. As their link with the outside world,
  who daily brought them spicy tit-bits of gossip from Bodmin, he occupied an
  unassailable position in the community. And the sight of him drinking with
  the new arrivals was a sufficient introduction.</p>

  <p>A little man with a straggling grey beard appeared to have the ear of the
  meeting. Even the landlord, after drawing the beer, returned to his position
  at the other end of the bar, and resumed his air of interested attention.</p>

  <p>"'Ess, sur," cried the speaker, banging his tankard on the table. "I seed
  'un orl rit. I went out night arter young Jan were washed ashore. It were
  dark, an' I told meself I were a fool to go poking me 'ead in at all. Still I
  kept on. And I'd just got to that li'l' rise afore you comes to Hooting Carn,
  when I looks to me left. An' there I seed 'un. There 'ee were as 'igh as a
  'ouse, an' gleamin' all over 'ee were&mdash;from 'ead to foot. For a bit I
  couldn't move&mdash;struck frozen I were, and then 'ee started to walk
  towards me. I gave one yell an' turned on me 'eels an' I never stopped
  running till I got back&mdash;an' that's all of two mile."</p>

  <p>"Tall as a 'ouse, Mr. Dogerty?" said someone doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Tall as a 'ouse," repeated greybeard firmly, "an' gleaming all over. I
  tell 'ee it's the devil 'isself that got young Jan."</p>

  <p>"You be new to these parts, sur?" said the landlord, coming back to
  Drummond.</p>

  <p>"We are," answered Drummond. "George has been telling us about your
  excitement here."</p>

  <p>"Bad affair it was, sur...Very bad...Young Jan Penderby was as nice a boy
  as you could meet."</p>

  <p>"They say he was burned," remarked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Well, sur&mdash;I did see the corpse. An' there sure was something mighty
  odd about it...I've seen drowned men before, but never a one like Jan. All
  yaller 'e was, as if 'e'd been scorched with fire."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the ghost yourself, landlord?"</p>

  <p>"I have not, sur. An' I don't want to neither. Be you gentlemen on a
  walking tour?"</p>

  <p>"That's the idea," said Drummond. "Hope it keeps fine."</p>

  <p>"The weather will be all right. But if you takes my advice you'll not walk
  past Hooting Carn save by daylight..."</p>

  <p>"Belongs to a Mr. Stangerton, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"That's so, sur. Rented it, he did, about a year ago...Been empty some
  time afore that."</p>

  <p>"And what does he say about the ghost?"</p>

  <p>"Bless you, sur&mdash;we don't never see him. Keeps 'isself in 'is 'ouse,
  he does; never goes out at all, so far as I knows."</p>

  <p>"This little island Varda," continued Drummond, "that George was telling
  us about. Does anyone live on it?"</p>

  <p>"Bless you, no, sur. Only the seagulls. Rises well nigh sheer out of the
  sea. They do say as 'ow in the old days it was used by smugglers. But them be
  old tales."</p>

  <p>"It's not marked on any map, is it?"</p>

  <p>The landlord laughed.</p>

  <p>"Marked on a map? No, sur. 'Tis only a small rock. And the name is just a
  local one&mdash;given after the Spaniard who was drowned there."</p>

  <p>He turned away to supply another customer, and Drummond looked at the
  other two.</p>

  <p>"Can you beat it for luck?" he muttered. "I just want to ask him one or
  two more questions, and then we might have a pow-wow. Do you happen to know,
  landlord," he continued, "if this Mr. Stangerton is married?"</p>

  <p>"Never heard as how he was, sur. But that's not saying he ain't."</p>

  <p>"An artist, so George was saying. Is it a big house?"</p>

  <p>"Middlin', sur. About a hundred yards from the top of the cliff."</p>

  <p>"Does he keep a large staff?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say as I rightly knows, sur. As I was telling you, he keeps 'isself
  to 'isself."</p>

  <p>"One would have thought that tradesmen delivering goods would have known,"
  said Drummond casually.</p>

  <p>"That's where you're wrong, sur. He gets all his stuff from Bodmin. Sends
  in for it, he does."</p>

  <p>"Quite a mystery man," laughed Drummond.</p>

  <p>"And when did the ghost first begin to show itself?"</p>

  <p>"Nigh on two months ago, sur. Regular walk it used to be for couples
  courting. But now not one of 'em would go near it..."</p>

  <p>"Don't blame 'em," agreed Drummond. "Could you let me have some bread and
  cheese, and another pint all round. Over in that alcove would do nicely."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sur...Will you be wanting rooms for to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, please," said Drummond. "Well, boys," he went on as they sat down in
  their corner, "as I said before, can you beat it for luck?"</p>

  <p>"What do you make of this ghost business?" remarked Darrell.</p>

  <p>"Ghost my foot," cried Drummond. "You heard what the landlord said. All
  the necking pairs in Cornwall were using it as a lovers' lane. Which did not
  suit this man Stangerton. So, having heard about the legend, he produced the
  ghost."</p>

  <p>"And this fellow who was killed?"</p>

  <p>"Happened to find out too much," said Drummond quietly. "That's how I read
  it. What was in those packing-cases, chaps? They seemed damned heavy."</p>

  <p>"Some of Mr. Sam Cartwright's little machines," hazarded Algy.</p>

  <p>"That's what I think, old boy. And there have been six before those two.
  But it isn't that," he continued after a pause, "that is making me scratch my
  head. You heard what mine host said about this little island. He said it
  rises wellnigh sheer out of the sea. But, according to our friend George, the
  ghost has been seen flitting over the top of it. How did it get there?"</p>

  <p>"Boat and rope ladder."</p>

  <p>"Which presupposes someone on the top of the island beforehand, to let
  down the ladder. Further, even to a superstitious crowd like these people,
  the spectacle of a ghost laboriously climbing up the side of a cliff would
  shatter 'em a bit. No&mdash;I'm wondering..."</p>

  <p>"We'll buy it."</p>

  <p>"You heard what the landlord said about smugglers in the old days. Is it
  possible that there is a connection between that island and the
  mainland&mdash;under the sea? And that that is what Jan Penderby found?"</p>

  <p>"I like it," said Algy. "Definitely&mdash;I like it. Starting from the
  house, or something of that sort?"</p>

  <p>Drummond nodded.</p>

  <p>"You've got it," he said. "Though probably not from the house itself, as I
  don't see how a local man could have got inside. But he found it, and being a
  courageous lad he followed it up. And that was his death-warrant."</p>

  <p>"What puzzles me," remarked Darrell, "is this burning business. Why go out
  of your way to draw attention to the thing? Why not knock him on the head and
  throw him in the sea? Then it's plain drowning."</p>

  <p>"I agree," said Drummond. "That's been worrying me. And from what we know
  up to date, there's no answer..."</p>

  <p>"If you're right about the passage," reverted Algy, "how are we going to
  find the entrance?"</p>

  <p>"How did Jan Penderby?"</p>

  <p>"Stumbled on it by chance."</p>

  <p>"At night! Again&mdash;I wonder. I think he happened to see the ghost go
  to ground. Is there any reason why we shouldn't do likewise?"</p>

  <p>Peter Darrell began to rub his hands together ecstatically.</p>

  <p>"Good boy," he cried. "Very good boy...Go right up to the top of the
  class. Teacher is pleased with you. So your suggestion is...?"</p>

  <p>"Same as yours."</p>

  <p>"To-night?"</p>

  <p>"As ever is," said Drummond. "Let's have some more ale."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">XV. &mdash; THE GHOST WALKS</a></h2>

  <p>The weather was warm and almost muggy when they started. The last visitor
  had left the bar; the landlord of the Jolly Fisherman was preparing to shut
  up for the night. It was useless to try to conceal their intentions from him,
  even had they wanted to, and he regarded them with a pleasingly benign
  toleration.</p>

  <p>"Well, gents," he said, "everyone to their own way of thinking. Give me my
  bed. I'll leave the door open, and the candles on the table."</p>

  <p>At first the rise was almost imperceptible; then it grew steeper. And a
  quarter of an hour after they had left the inn they reached the top of the
  cliff. Behind them lay the village, though no light could be seen from far
  below came the monotonous beat of the sea on the rocks.</p>

  <p>The going was smooth and springy, and they swung forward in silence. From
  the map they knew that Hooting Carn lay just on two miles from Helverton, but
  they were still some way short of that distance when they saw in front of
  them a solitary light. It was shining through trees and lay in a hollow.</p>

  <p>"The house, presumably," remarked Drummond. "I think a little
  closer&mdash;" He paused suddenly. "What's that noise?"</p>

  <p>They listened intently, but the other two could hear nothing.</p>

  <p>"I can," said Drummond, lying down on the ground and pressing his ear to
  the grass. "Why, it's unmistakable."</p>

  <p>They followed his example, and then it was obvious, too, to them. Very
  faint, but perfectly distinct, there came to their ears a gentle, rhythmic
  thump&mdash;thump&mdash;thump. Almost could they feel a faint tremor in the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"An engine of sorts," said Algy.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," remarked Drummond. "But what sort? And where? No electric-light
  machine ever made that noise. It might be a pump for water, but it seems a
  rum time to have one going. However, let's investigate further."</p>

  <p>They walked on, their footsteps making no sound on the soft turf. Dimly
  they could see the outline of the house, against the ground that rose again
  on the other side of it. And at last they got near enough to see into the
  room from which the light was shining.</p>

  <p>A man was seated at a table smoking. In front of him were a batch of
  papers and a ledger which he consulted from time to time, and in which he
  made periodical entries. He was not a prepossessing-looking individual, and
  evidently the thought of water with his whisky was not one that appealed to
  him. His features were red and coarse, but the breadth of his shoulders
  denoted strength.</p>

  <p>"Is that our artist?" whispered Drummond.</p>

  <p>"I should think his sole claim to painting ability," answered Darrell,
  "would be covered by disinfecting the chicken run."</p>

  <p>After a few moments the door opened, and another man entered. He was
  obviously an underling as he did not venture to sit down, but stood waiting
  for orders. And, having received them, he left as abruptly as he had come.
  Twice more the performance was repeated; then the leader lit a cigarette and
  rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>He was a bigger man than he had seemed when sitting down, and for a while
  he stood looking out into the night. Then, pitching away his cigarette he
  closed the window and switched off the light. And a moment or two later a
  gleam from an upstair room proclaimed that he had gone to bed.</p>

  <p>"Evidently he doesn't mind being seen," said Drummond quietly. "Though
  when all is said and done the whole proceeding was perfectly harmless. Let's
  explore a bit more."</p>

  <p>Cautiously they circled round the house, keeping some fifty yards away
  from it, but there was nothing to be seen. There were lights in a few of the
  top rooms, but one by one these went out. And at length the place was in
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"What do we do now?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and wait," said Drummond. "It's only just eleven. The trouble is
  we mustn't smoke. Incidentally that engine is still going strong."</p>

  <p>"I wonder where the deuce it is," remarked Darrell. "It's not loud enough
  to be coming from the house."</p>

  <p>"It sounds to me," said Drummond with his ear again pressed to the ground,
  "as if it was underneath us somewhere. My God I look there."</p>

  <p>Motionless they sat staring at the house. Out to sea a syren blared
  mournfully; near-by a fitful eddy of wind stirred the trees. But the three
  silent watchers had only eyes and ears for one thing.</p>

  <p>Behind a clump of bushes near the house a light was gradually beginning to
  materialise. It rolled and swirled, shapeless to start with, until it seemed
  to take the form of a gigantic man. And then, abruptly, with a curious
  gliding movement, it passed from behind the screen of undergrowth out into
  the open.</p>

  <p>Fascinated, they watched it as it passed over the ground. Its height was
  fantastic&mdash;twice that of an ordinary man, and as it moved it seemed to
  be dripping fire. It went away from them, up the rise they had come down,
  then, making a detour, it circled round towards them.</p>

  <p>"No wonder the locals were frightened," muttered Drummond. "It's a
  fearsome-looking object."</p>

  <p>It passed about twenty yards away from them, and at that range, they could
  see how the effect had been produced. The luminosity was obviously caused by
  a preparation of phosphorus; the great height by some form of superstructure
  carried on the shoulders. But it was in the apparent movement of gliding that
  the cleverness lay. For the ghost's legs were covered with a voluminous skirt
  reaching almost to the ground, which effectually prevented the actual feet
  being seen.</p>

  <p>It drifted on aimlessly first in one direction, then in another until, at
  length, it halted. But only for a second; even as they watched it, it sank
  into the ground and disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Quick," said Drummond. "Now's our chance."</p>

  <p>They walked towards the spot from which a faint glow still emanated. Then,
  as if a light had been turned out, all was dark again.</p>

  <p>They groped forward cautiously, and suddenly Drummond paused. Just in
  front of them, from what seemed to be a crack in the ground, there still
  filtered a chink of light. And then that, too, went out; everything was
  dark.</p>

  <p>"Run to earth," said Drummond quietly. "What the deuce have we here? It
  feels like a stone. Form a scrum, boys, between me and the house; I'm going
  to chance the torch for a second."</p>

  <p>It flashed out; at their feet was a mildewed, moss covered stone slab. But
  three words cut in it were sufficient to show what it was:</p>

  <blockquote>
    "DON MIGUEL VARDA."
  </blockquote>

  <p>"The Spaniard's tomb," breathed Drummond. "Well, I'm damned I It bears out
  what George said. The grave from which he walks and into which he disappears.
  And Jan Penderby found it."</p>

  <p>He was staring out to sea as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Give it a minute or two, yet chaps, and we'll see if I was right. I was;
  by God I I was."</p>

  <p>Floating, apparently in space, over the sea was the gliding yellow figure.
  Twice, three times it went backwards and forwards some three or four hundred
  yards away; then, even as it had done on the mainland, it sank down and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Yes; I was right," repeated Drummond. "That was the ghost doing its piece
  on the island of Varda. Which means that if the ghost can get there, we
  can."</p>

  <p>"Is it likely to come back this way?" said Darrell thoughtfully. "Because,
  if so, we'd better allow a few minutes. We don't particularly want to meet it
  in a narrow passage."</p>

  <p>"Agreed," said Drummond, who was fumbling with the tombstone. "Got it," he
  muttered suddenly. "The whole thing slides back."</p>

  <p>They retreated a little distance and sat down to wait. And it was not for
  long. Barely five minutes had elapsed before there came a faint rumble from
  in front of them, and a dark figure emerged from the ground. The ghost minus
  its make up had returned. Came another rumble; a faint clank as of a metal
  bar being shot into position&mdash;and silence. The ghost had departed to
  bed.</p>

  <p>They gave it another quarter of an hour before they again approached the
  grave. And then one gleam from the torch was sufficient to show the cause of
  the clank. A steel bar had been shot home which bolted the stone slab in
  position. It was not locked in any way; evidently Mr. Stangerton relied on
  superstition to prevent any undue curiosity about the tomb. And it was a
  simple matter to slide the bar from its sockets and lay it on the grass. Then
  very cautiously they pulled back the slab.</p>

  <p>Below them yawned a black hole, and one after another they lowered
  themselves down into it. And then, having pulled back the stone into its
  normal position, Drummond switched on his torch.</p>

  <p>They were standing in a small vault like cave. In places the walls had
  been shored up with baulks of timber, and the work was obviously recent. A
  ladder, which they had not seen led to the stone above them; in front was a
  black opening that looked like the entrance to a mine shaft. From it,
  descending sharply, ran a tunnel. And in this, too, the walls were supported
  in various places with new timbering.</p>

  <p>The going, though steep, was good. The roof was high enough to allow them
  to walk without stooping, but caution was necessary. And every few yards
  Drummond stopped, torch switched off, to listen. But no sound could be heard;
  the engine they had noticed earlier, had ceased.</p>

  <p>It was at the third halt that they struck another gallery coming in from
  the right&mdash;a gallery completely shored with mine cases, which was
  obviously all new work. And here they paused for a space; there were points
  of considerable interest to be noted.</p>

  <p>First&mdash;from its direction it could lead to only one place, the house.
  Second&mdash;the wires. Looped to the roof ran half a dozen&mdash;some thick
  insulated cables, others which might have been telephone connections. And
  they all stretched away into the darkness in front of them. Moreover at ten
  yard intervals there now hung electric light bulbs from the top of the
  tunnel.</p>

  <p>"They evidently feel pretty safe here," whispered Drummond. "Which is not
  to be wondered at seeing we must be fifty feet underground by now. But
  there's no doubt about one thing, boys, this has taken a bit of doing. Even
  granted the original foundation which they had to work on, a hell of a lot of
  labour has been put into this show. And what I'm wondering is where all that
  labour is. Have they got a young army billeted about the place? Or did they
  chance letting the men who did this job go?"</p>

  <p>The angle of descent became steeper after the junction. In places rough
  steps had been constructed, with lengths of rope attached to the wall as an
  additional help. And as they descended lower the air grew dank and cold.</p>

  <p>At last the shaft flattened out; they were under the bed of the sea. And
  here the timbering was far more elaborate and powerful, though the roof
  dripped water in places, and puddles lay on the floor. For about a hundred
  yards the tunnel continued horizontal; then it began to rise steeply again.
  And with a feeling of relief the three men ascended into drier air.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Drummond switched off his torch; a faint light was beginning to
  filter down the shaft from an opening in front, which grew stronger as they
  got higher. They were moving with the utmost caution, their rubber-soled
  shoes making no sound as they climbed. And at length, inch by inch, Drummond
  hoisted himself up so that he could see what the shaft led into.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott!" he breathed. "Look at that."</p>

  <p>The other two joined him, and side by side they lay staring at the scene
  in front of them. And assuredly it was an amazing one.</p>

  <p>They were looking into a large cave, from the roof of which hung two
  electric bulbs, throwing an eerie white light into the gloom below. Fantastic
  shadows lay across the floor, and as their eyes grew accustomed to it they
  began to see the details of the place more clearly.</p>

  <p>Around the walls various types of machines had been erected&mdash;lathes
  and the like, each one of which must have been carried along the passage that
  lay behind them. In the centre there stood what looked like a crushing
  machine, with a heavy vertical rod moving in guides&mdash;the machine that
  had probably been making the thumping noise they had heard on the
  mainland.</p>

  <p>Close by it stood a huge pile of tins neatly stacked, and on which they
  could see the label of Petworth's Fruit. Packing-cases&mdash;some open and
  some shut littered the floor, and in the far corner was a wooden partition
  marked "Danger."</p>

  <p>Of human beings there was no sign; evidently work had ceased for the time.
  And after a moment Drummond rose and crept forward followed by the other two.
  They skirted round, keeping as much as possible in the shadows, and as they
  investigated further the whole gigantic scheme became clear. One packing case
  labelled Leeds&mdash;one of the two that had come with George&mdash;was open,
  and contained as they had guessed a number of clockwork machines similar to
  the one Drummond had found in Switzerland. Another was full of unopened fruit
  tins all of the same Petworth brand.</p>

  <p>The tins stacked in the centre were empty, and a thing like a pig tub
  close by was full of lemon cling peaches, slices of banana, apricots, and
  pink cherries; Mr. Petworth's Fancy Quality Fruit Salad had come to an
  undignified end. And picking up a few of the tins Drummond noticed that some
  of them had three little cubes inside, while others were plain.</p>

  <p>He walked over to the wooden partition labelled "Danger"; there was a door
  in it which he tried cautiously. But it was locked, and he made no attempt to
  force it.</p>

  <p>"Presumably the explosive for this jolly little scheme," he muttered, and
  even as he spoke the unmistakable sound of a human snore fell on their ears.
  It came from the other side of the cave, and looking across they saw a
  blanket hanging in the wall.</p>

  <p>Creeping over they listened; from behind the blanket came sounds as of a
  barrack room at night&mdash;heavy breathing and an occasional creak as a
  sleeper turned over in bed.</p>

  <p>"Fitted with dormitory complete," whispered Drummond. "I wonder how many
  of the swine there are."</p>

  <p>The other two laid hands on him.</p>

  <p>"Come away," muttered Darrell firmly. "None of your charge of the Light
  Brigade here. We've found out all we want to find out, old lad; let's hop
  it."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," agreed Drummond with a grin. "We'll go."</p>

  <p>With one last look at that converted smuggler's cave they began the return
  journey down the shaft. Details might be&mdash;were&mdash;lacking, but the
  main outline of the plot was clear. And as Drummond went along, once again
  did those words of Jimmy Latimer come back to him&mdash;"Out-Vernes Jules
  Verne."</p>

  <p>"Not this time, my friends," he muttered to himself; "not this time."</p>

  <p>And at that moment all the lights in the tunnel went on.</p>

  <p>They halted dead in their tracks; the thing was so utterly unexpected as
  to stagger them momentarily. They were in the horizontal section under the
  sea, and no one was in sight. Only the bulbs gleaming dully through the
  moisture that covered them showed that somewhere someone was awake. But was
  it in front, or was it behind? Had the lights been switched on from the
  mainland or from the island?</p>

  <p>Drummond produced his wire cutters.</p>

  <p>"Better anything than light," he muttered, as he cut the flex. "They may
  think a fuse has blown, or that there's a short."</p>

  <p>They stood motionless&mdash;listening. Around them pressed the
  darkness&mdash;so black that it could be felt. And then, step by step, they
  began to feel their way towards the mainland end of the shaft.</p>

  <p>From behind them came suddenly the faint sound of voices, and Drummond
  swore under his breath. Cutting the wire had put not only the lights in the
  tunnel out of commission, but also the two that had been on in the cave. And,
  presumably, somebody who had been awake behind the blanket had given the
  alarm. Which meant, if the original switch on had come from the house end,
  they were caught between two fires.</p>

  <p>Undeniably the situation was awkward. To use a torch was out of the
  question; they could only grope blindly on by feel. And the trouble was that
  if the men from the island did come to investigate there was no reason why
  <i>they</i> should not use a torch, which meant instant discovery. The shaft
  ran straight; there was no recess in either wall which would hide one man,
  much less three.</p>

  <p>They were climbing now&mdash;scrambling up the steep slope as silently as
  they could. There was no sign, as yet, of any light ahead, and hope began to
  rise in their breasts. Once over the steepest section progress would be
  quicker; if only they could make the grave they were safe. And at last with a
  sigh of relief Drummond who was leading, topped the rise and felt the ground
  become flatter under his feet. Just in time; a torch was flashing down below
  them as the island contingent came into view.</p>

  <p>His pace quickened; speed was essential. Half running, half stumbling,
  their hands outstretched to feel the walls they pushed forward. And at last
  they reached their goal.</p>

  <p>"Heave," he muttered, "heave like hell. Those blighters will be in the
  straight soon."</p>

  <p>And they might as well have heaved at solid rock; the tombstone would not
  budge an inch. Someone had replaced the bar; they were caught like rats in a
  trap.</p>

  <p>"'Pish!' said Eric, now thoroughly aroused," remarked Drummond with a
  short laugh. "That, chaps, would seem to have torn it. Especially as hounds
  are in sight."</p>

  <p>It was true. The island party led by two men with torches had come into
  view. As yet they were too far off for the light to pick them up, but it
  would only be a question of moments before they were spotted. And then there
  occurred an unexpected development. The whole pack swung away up the gallery
  leading to the house.</p>

  <p>"Now what the devil is that for?" said Drummond thoughtfully. "Is it a
  trap, or..."</p>

  <p>They were not long in getting the answer. Came a vicious phut, and a
  bullet buried itself in the ground behind them&mdash;followed by another, and
  yet a third&mdash;a third which ended with a different note. Too often in the
  old days had they heard it in France.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, old man," said Algy with a groan. "They've got me through the
  shoulder."</p>

  <p>"Lie down," came Drummond's quiet order. Then he cupped his mouth in his
  hands. "We surrender." he called out.</p>

  <p>The object of the move up the branch gallery was clear; they could be shot
  at without being able to answer. A man firing round the fork of the two
  shafts would be bound to get them in time, and they had nothing to fire back
  at.</p>

  <p>"Hurt, old Algy?" he asked gently.</p>

  <p>"Only a Blighty," answered Algy. "Blast their eyesight."</p>

  <p>There was a silence from the other end; then with a sudden spluttering
  noise a tiny search-light flared into life. The beam shifted, then focussed
  and grew steady on the three prone men.</p>

  <p>"Stand up," came a harsh voice. "I am watching you through a
  periscope."</p>

  <p>They rose to their feet.</p>

  <p>"Hold up any revolvers or other weapons you possess. Now put them on the
  floor beside you."</p>

  <p>The voice waited until the order had been carried out.</p>

  <p>"Now come along the shaft until you are within two yards of the
  search-light. I warn you that you are covered, and that on the slightest sign
  of your doing anything foolish, you will be killed."</p>

  <p>In silence they did as they were told.</p>

  <p>"Bind their wrists behind them," continued the voice.</p>

  <p>Three men stepped forward, each with a length of cord, and though Algy
  turned white no sound escaped his lips as one of them wrenched his wounded
  arm back.</p>

  <p>"So we scored one bull, did we?" went on the voice. "A foretaste of more
  to come. We will now show you to your temporary quarters."</p>

  <p>The man behind Drummond gave him a jolt in the back.</p>

  <p>"Move," he grunted.</p>

  <p>He jerked Drummond's arm and pushed him into the gallery leading to the
  house. At the far end was a square of light, and as he got up to it he saw
  that the shaft opened into a big cellar. A flight of stone stairs opposite
  him led up into the house, but the room itself was empty, save for a table
  and some chairs. The walls were of stone and were also bare, except for a
  small switchboard flanked with coloured bulbs.</p>

  <p>"How are you feeling, Algy?" asked Drummond as the other two were pushed
  in beside him.</p>

  <p>"Fine, to what he will do," remarked the voice materialising. It was the
  man who they had seen working in the downstair room earlier in the
  evening.</p>

  <p>The rest of the men came in behind him, and Drummond took stock of them.
  And with one or two exceptions he was struck by their appearance of
  respectability. This was no collection of gangsters or toughs; they looked
  like a bunch of hard-working mechanics. Save for the exceptions, who were the
  men who had bound them. And they looked what they were&mdash;rough stuff who
  would bump off anyone for a dollar.</p>

  <p>"And now," continued the leader, "may I ask what you were doing down
  below?"</p>

  <p>"By all manner of means," said Drummond frankly. "We are, as you see, on a
  hiking tour, and this evening we reached the Jolly Fisherman at Helverton.
  There we heard stories of a mysterious ghost that had been seen near this
  house. So we decided to investigate. We saw the ghost; we saw it go to ground
  in what appeared to be a grave. And having waited a bit we proceeded to
  explore out of curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Do you usually go on a hiking tour armed with revolvers?" asked the other
  with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"Not usually," answered Drummond. "But we had them with us, and decided to
  bring them to-night."</p>

  <p>"Most convincing. And how far did you get in your exploration?"</p>

  <p>"Down to the bottom of a tunnel Then it seemed to be getting so wet that
  we only went a short way along the level..."</p>

  <p>"When the lights were switched on?</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"And you cut the wire?"</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"And now supposing you tell me the truth. It will perhaps assist you if I
  tell you what you did. You continued along the level and climbed the shaft on
  the other side. There you entered a large cave, which unfortunately for you
  has its entrance guarded by that burglar proof light ray of which you may
  have heard, and which rang the alarm in my room. You remained in the cave
  some ten minutes, and then left. You again sounded the alarm, by which time I
  had taken the necessary precautions to prevent you escaping. Am I right?"</p>

  <p>Drummond shrugged his shoulders; denial was stupid.</p>

  <p>"I see that I am. Now then&mdash;who are you?"</p>

  <p>"My name is Hillman; this is Mr. Singer, and the man you've wounded is
  Morris."</p>

  <p>"Names are notoriously difficult to invent on the spur of the moment, I
  agree. But if you must go to the car industry why not Mr. Rolls, Mr. Royce,
  and Mr. Bentley? Still the point is immaterial."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"My name is Stangerton," he continued. "Will you smoke? Unlash them. I
  think," he went on as the ropes were cast off, "that you have sufficient
  sense to realise that any attempt to throw your weight about will merely
  precipitate your inevitable end."</p>

  <p>"Which is?" asked Drummond politely.</p>

  <p>"Very simple. The only difficulty lies in the fact that
  Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Morris has been wounded. Otherwise by now you would all
  have&mdash;ah&mdash;fallen over the cliff in your pursuit of that elusive
  ghost, which the whole village will be sure to know you came to look for.
  Very dangerous cliffs here."</p>

  <p>"I appreciate your quandary," said Drummond pleasantly. "Even the most
  warlike of ghosts is unlikely to plug a man through the arm. So what do we
  do?"</p>

  <p>"The programme still remains the same for you and Mr. Singer. You see the
  currents in this part of the coast are notoriously treacherous. So if two of
  the bodies are ultimately washed up that will be sufficient. The third need
  not be discovered, and won't be. So Mr. Morris will be buried on the island
  to-morrow night."</p>

  <p>Drummond blew out a cloud of smoke.</p>

  <p>"So you intend to murder us in cold blood," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry about it," said Stangerton quietly, "but I have no
  alternative. You must put yourselves in my place. You are not fools; you must
  realise that something is going on here which I require kept secret. How dare
  I let you go? You are bound to talk of what you have seen. If, on the other
  hand, I keep you all as prisoners&mdash;what then? The villagers will talk.
  Hooting Carn will become a centre of publicity&mdash;the very thing I wish to
  avoid. And so&mdash;though believe me, I have no personal animosity against
  you&mdash;you must be killed...And killed in such a way that the manner of
  your death will arouse no suspicion. Another cigarette? And then I fear we
  must get on with it."</p>

  <p>"Thanks," drawled Drummond.</p>

  <p>His hand was as steady as a rock as he helped himself from the tin, though
  for the life of him he could see no way out. What Stangerton had said was
  plain, horse-sense; from his point of view there was no other way of looking
  at it. He could neither afford to let them go nor keep them as prisoners. But
  one more effort could do no harm.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Mr. Stangerton," he said quietly, "aren't you being a little
  drastic? I admit we were trespassing, and that we went where we had no right
  to go. But surely our curiosity was understandable."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. But your revolvers were not...In short, Mr. Hillman, I do not
  believe that you are three genuine hikers."</p>

  <p>"Really! What do you think we are?"</p>

  <p>"Journalists."</p>

  <p>Drummond raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Under these circumstances aren't you afraid that our papers may become
  inquisitive?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure they will. Hence the necessity of your accidental death. I
  anticipate that quite a number of people will follow you up, but they will
  discover nothing. For one thing, the ghost has walked for the last time; his
  utility is exhausted. As a matter of fact it was, I think, a mistake on my
  part not to have stopped him after that young fisherman's death...However,
  that cannot be helped now. Tell me"&mdash;he stared suddenly at
  Drummond&mdash;"what was it that brought you here? Was it the fact that the
  man was burned?"</p>

  <p>"That certainly has given rise to comment," answered Drummond.</p>

  <p>"You were a fool, Freystadt, a damned fool," said Stangerton angrily. "I
  told you so at the time."</p>

  <p>A heavy-jowled German looked up sullenly.</p>

  <p>"It vos a great opportunity the gaz to test," he muttered. "I did not of
  other things think."</p>

  <p>"Gas," remarked Drummond languidly. "Is that what you're making in the
  chamber of horrors?"</p>

  <p>"Amongst other things, Mr. Hillman; amongst other things."</p>

  <p>Drummond's brain was racing; this was something new. Gas had so far not
  entered into their calculations; it was a completely fresh development and
  one which, at the moment, he could not fit in. And then with a bitter sense
  of futility came the realisation that it did not much matter whether he could
  or could not.</p>

  <p>"And now I think we must conclude our talk." Stangerton was speaking
  again. "I am genuinely sorry that I have to take this course. I bear you no
  animosity whatever personally; to me you are just three individuals who have
  found out more than it is good for you to know. And so you must be removed.
  Bind their arms again."</p>

  <p>It was then that Drummond went berserk. With one glorious upper-cut he
  broke the jaw of the man behind him and the fight began. Once, twice, and yet
  again he threw them off him as they waded in, his fists smashing into every
  face he could see. The table overturned; two chairs were splintered to
  matchwood. And it was not until one man got him by the ankles that like a
  falling oak he finally crashed to the ground, with ten of them on top of him.
  He felt his arms lashed behind his back as he lay there panting. He heard, as
  balm to his soul, the groans and curses of the men he had hit. Then came a
  boot in his ribs, and he was hauled to his feet...</p>

  <p>He stood there swaying drunkenly, with the blood streaming down his face.
  On the floor lay Peter unconscious. His guard had hit him on the base of the
  skull with a piece of gas-piping before he had had time to join in. And Algy,
  helpless with his shattered shoulder, stood against the wall watching.</p>

  <p>"A good one, old Algy," laughed Drummond. "A good one for the last."</p>

  <p>His eyes roved round the ring of men; paused on Stangerton's plum-coloured
  eye; paused on the gas expert pulling out some teeth in a corner. And once
  again he laughed, a great laugh that rang through the room, and rang and rang
  again as a challenge to the last grim Visitor he had diced with so often in
  the past.</p>

  <p>"Come on, you spawn," he roared. "Or are you still afraid?"</p>

  <p>"Lay him out, Pete," snarled Stangerton, to the wielder of the gas-piping.
  "Lay the devil out and sling 'em both over the cliff."</p>

  <p>Three men sprang on Drummond and held him, and he grinned at Algy.</p>

  <p>"So long, old man, so long."</p>

  <p>He braced himself for the blow; then gradually he relaxed. For a sudden
  silence had fallen on the room; the grip of the men who held him had
  loosened. And glancing up he saw that a man was standing at the top of the
  stairs&mdash;a man whose face was in the shadow.</p>

  <p>"What an appalling noise," came a quiet voice, and Algy gave a start of
  surprise. "What on earth is happening, Mr. Stangerton?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer came down into the room; it was Menalin.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" he remarked staring at Algy. "If it isn't our friend Mr.
  Longworth&mdash;the village idiot. And what may I ask are you doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Having a look at the bridal suite in the new Madeira," drawled Algy.</p>

  <p>"And you?" Menalin paused in front of Drummond. "Who are you?"</p>

  <p>His eyes narrowed; he leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Surely I cannot be mistaken even though I have only seen you once. Remove
  the beard; remove the blood...It is...Well, Captain Drummond we meet at
  last."</p>

  <p>"The honour," remarked Drummond, "is entirely yours."</p>

  <p>"You know these men, sir?" Stangerton had found his voice.</p>

  <p>"Not the one on the floor&mdash;but the other two."</p>

  <p>"They are journalists who have been spying."</p>

  <p>"Journalists!" Menalin smiled. "Well, it's as good a profession as any
  other when pushed to it."</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette, and stared at Drummond.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, sir?" cried Stangerton.</p>

  <p>"They're no more journalists than you are," answered Menalin. "They're in
  the British Secret Service, and I pay this gentleman, at any rate, the
  compliment of saying that he's one of the very few really dangerous men I've
  ever met in my life."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI. &mdash; CHALLENGE ACCEPTED</a></h2>

  <p>An angry murmur ran round the room, and Menalin held up his hand.</p>

  <p>"I do not think we want all these people here, Stangerton," he remarked.
  "The room is insufferably hot, and Captain Drummond has not improved their
  appearance."</p>

  <p>With a gesture Stangerton dismissed them, keeping only those who had acted
  as guards.</p>

  <p>"Lash their legs," ordered Menalin, "and then you three can go also.
  Remain within call. I fear, Captain Drummond, that you will have to sit on
  the floor, since you appear to have broken all the chairs except this
  one."</p>

  <p>"But surely, sir," said Stangerton nervously, "if these men are in the
  Secret Service it is all the more important to dispose of them at once."</p>

  <p>"And have every policeman in England on the spot when their bodies are
  washed ashore? Don't be a fool, Stangerton. The one place they must not be
  disposed of is here."</p>

  <p>"But it would appear accidental," persisted the other.</p>

  <p>"What does it signify how it appears?" snapped Menalin. "All that would
  matter is that they were in this locality&mdash;not that they were dead."</p>

  <p>He sat down and lit another cigarette.</p>

  <p>"But supposing that it is known that they came here?" cried
  Stangerton.</p>

  <p>"The supposition had already occurred to me," said Menalin calmly. "And if
  it is correct, nothing that we can do will alter the fact. Our one aim must
  be to create the impression that, although they came here, they left again,
  having found nothing of interest. And our only method of doing that is to
  have their bodies found as soon as possible and as far away as possible. So
  will you get through to Mr. Burton at once. It will probably take you a
  considerable time at this hour of the night, but that can't be helped. And,
  when you've got him, ask him to start at once, bringing his cure for
  asthma."</p>

  <p>"For what?" cried Stangerton.</p>

  <p>"Asthma. He will understand. You might add that a mutual friend has
  arrived from the Continent who needs it badly. And now," he continued as
  Stangerton left the cellar, "I feel that I should enjoy a chat with you,
  Captain Drummond."</p>

  <p>Drummond looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What is the programme?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"So far as you are concerned, a perfectly painless death as soon as Burton
  arrives. One, moreover, which has the advantage of appearing natural. I can
  assure you that when he first told me that he could do it, I didn't believe
  him. I thought it was the figment of a novelist's imagination. But there is
  no doubt about it; his claim is justified. It appears that if a large
  injection of a drug called adrenalin is made into a vein, death occurs in
  about five minutes. And since the drug is destroyed very quickly by the
  blood, no trace remains. I was so taken by the idea that I asked a Harley
  Street man at dinner the other night, and he confirmed it. Apparently, so he
  told me, pituitrin has the same effect. But, as adrenalin is used for hay
  fever and asthma, and pituitrin only in childbirth, I suppose Burton, dear
  fellow, thought the former more suitable."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that Burton jabbed a needle into Jimmy Latimer
  without waking him?" cried Drummond.</p>

  <p>"I fear there was a little lying on that occasion, Captain Drummond,"
  smiled Menalin. "The barman's assistant had his orders before the boat
  sailed. Had Latimer not had a drink&mdash;well, there were other methods
  available. But since he did&mdash;it was easy."</p>

  <p>"It was doped, you mean."</p>

  <p>"Precisely. Enough to produce a very sound sleep. And a whiff of
  chloroform did the rest. But that is all <i>vieux jeu.</i> Tell me about
  yourself. I little thought when I arrived here yesterday that I should have
  the pleasure of meeting you."</p>

  <p>In spite of himself Drummond smiled; there was no trace of sarcasm in the
  words.</p>

  <p>"Under slightly different conditions, I would have said the same," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Conditions which no one regrets more than I do," said Menalin. "But when
  one enters a game of this sort, one knows the risks."</p>

  <p>"Are you prepared to put your cards on the table?" Drummond looked at him
  questioningly. "I know something; I may say I know a good deal. But there are
  still many gaps. And since I am in your power..."</p>

  <p>"You would like your curiosity gratified? Certainly, Captain Drummond. I
  will pay you the compliment of saying you deserve it. And perhaps you, too,
  will gratify mine over one or two points that are not quite clear to me.</p>

  <p>"We must go back nearly two years," he began, "if we are to get the matter
  in its true perspective. It was then becoming evident to everyone who knew
  anything that the situation in Europe could not remain as it was. I am not
  going to bore you with a dissertation on international politics, but it was
  obvious that, within the next few years, matters must come to a head. Every
  big power was arming feverishly, with the exception of England, who seemed
  fundamentally incapable of appreciating the situation. Strange, too, for she
  must have known...</p>

  <p>"It was at this stage of the proceedings that I was called in and given
  <i>carte blanche.</i> England&mdash;or rather her Empire&mdash;was the prize,
  and the problem that I had to solve was the simplest method of obtaining it.
  There was no urgency; the time was not then ripe. But, as you can imagine, a
  matter of such magnitude could not be solved in a few weeks.</p>

  <p>"To start with I dismissed at once any idea of a war <i>&agrave; outrance</i>
  like 1914. Not only was it a clumsy proceeding, but because that war had
  proved almost, if not quite, as damaging to the victors as to the vanquished.
  Besides, in anything of the nature of drawn-out proceedings, your country has
  always shown an amazing power of recovery. And so I concentrated on something
  in the nature of a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat,</i> where a smashing blow could be
  delivered before the war began. In fact, I still hope that we shall avert war
  altogether, which will be most satisfactory financially."</p>

  <p>Menalin lit another cigarette.</p>

  <p>"I regret I cannot offer you one?" he said, "but, from what I saw of your
  fighting capabilities, I fear your arms must remain bound. To continue,
  however; I happened to be staying with a friend of mine in Milan, when an act
  of sabotage took place in a factory in which he was interested. A
  discontented workman had managed to get hold of some explosive, and with it
  had wrecked a large and costly piece of machinery. And though there was
  nothing novel in that, it gave me the germ of an idea. For the thing that
  struck me was the very small amount of explosive that was required to do
  almost irreparable damage, <i>if it was applied at the right spot in the
  machine.</i></p>

  <p>"As I say&mdash;there was the germ; from it grew my present scheme, which
  you have by now, doubtless, grasped in its main outline. If so much damage
  could be done in one factory, what would be the result if it occurred
  simultaneously all over the country?</p>

  <p>"There were, of course, difficulties&mdash;serious difficulties. The first
  was to devise some method by which explosive could be delivered to a large
  number of different places in safety. The second was to get it introduced
  into the factories without it being spotted. The third was to ensure that it
  would be fired successfully. And it was at once obvious that something in the
  nature of a time bomb was the only solution.</p>

  <p>"It was the second of these points that decided us in our choice. Any form
  of tin would have been good enough for one and three, but, in order to comply
  with two, we decided to use a tin that apparently contained food. No one
  would then say anything to a man taking it in for his dinner. In addition it
  gave us a standard size, a point of value which you have also, doubtless,
  appreciated. We could now decentralise our work. By the way, do you like
  Burton?"</p>

  <p>"I do not," said Drummond grimly.</p>

  <p>"No more do L But he has been very useful to me. I met him first some
  years ago, and he is efficient. He will do anything for money, and in
  addition, for some reason, he dislikes this country intensely. And so I
  installed him in England to do the preliminary spade work at this end. I must
  say I have no fault to find with the way he has done it.</p>

  <p>"It was he who first hit on Maier&mdash;the Swiss. Incidentally, was it
  you that night, Captain Drummond?"</p>

  <p>"It was," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Dear me! It seems to me that you must know much more than is good for
  you."</p>

  <p>"I admit," remarked Drummond calmly, "that up to date you have told me
  very little that I hadn't guessed. Why did your men kill Maier?"</p>

  <p>"He was foolish enough to try blackmail."</p>

  <p>"I thought it was something like that. However, please go on."</p>

  <p>"Or perhaps you would like to continue for me?"</p>

  <p>"If you prefer it," said Drummond calmly. "The machine made by Maier was
  some form of time fuse which fits into the top of a Petworth fruit tin. These
  tins, having been emptied of fruit, are filled with explosive and resealed in
  that island. In due course they will be despatched all over the country, and
  at a previously arranged time they will be exploded in different works."</p>

  <p>"Capital," cried Menalin. "Capital. And perfectly correct. One refinement,
  however, I would like to point out to you, which was Maier's pride and joy.
  According to the distance which the opener travels round the tin depends the
  time it takes for the bomb to explode."</p>

  <p>"And what of those tins that are not fitted for a fuse?"</p>

  <p>"You note everything. In many cases more explosive&mdash;ammonal
  incidentally&mdash;than can be contained in one tin, is necessary. So there
  are some tins full of plain explosive. One of these lashed to a fused tin
  increases the charge."</p>

  <p>"A pretty plot," said Drummond slowly. "And you really believe that that
  will bring this country to her knees?"</p>

  <p>"Good God! No!" laughed Menalin. "That is only half the entertainment. The
  other half I made myself personally responsible for. And upon that side of
  the scheme I doubt if you are quite so well informed. No mention of it was
  contained in the papers that blew into Major Latimer's possession. And that
  is another thing I have often wondered. How much did he tell that woman,
  Madame P&eacute;lain."</p>

  <p>Drummond smiled.</p>

  <p>"We will leave the ladies' names out of it, Mr. Menalin, if you don't
  mind!"</p>

  <p>"As you will. Though I can assure you no harm will come to her. I know he
  got the map of the bomb distribution, and one sheet of the general
  instructions. To refer, however, to the second half of the programme.</p>

  <p>"You, of course, fought in the last war, when doubtless you sampled from
  time to time the unpleasant effects of gas. Starting in its rudimentary
  method with chlorine, various products such as phosgene, mustard gas or
  yperite and others were involved. But the war came to an end before some of
  the more advanced compounds were used. And it was to them that I naturally
  turned in my researches.</p>

  <p>"There was one invented by an American chemist, to which was given the
  name of Lewisite. It is a pale yellow liquid, which smells faintly of
  geraniums, and is made, if it interests you, from acetylene, arsenious oxide,
  and sulphur chloride. It is extremely poisonous and, under good conditions,
  sixteen hundredweight of the stuff would be sufficient to give a blanket of
  lethal gas twenty feet high, over an area of one square mile. Or to take
  another calculation, a hundred bombers, each carrying five thousand pounds of
  Lewisite could poison an area of three hundred square miles. No wonder it is
  generally known as 'The Dew of Death.'</p>

  <p>"Starting with this as a foundation Freystadt, whom you have seen, tells
  me that he has evolved a formula which is fifty per cent more powerful. But,
  even if he is optimistic, the figures I have given you should be good enough
  for my purpose&mdash;which is the simultaneous knock-out of certain
  strategical spots, of which, naturally, London is the first. The liquid will
  be dropped in hundreds of thin containers which will burst on hitting the
  ground. Then the gas is given off, and, since it is heavier than air, there
  is no escape in the streets of a city. And, if a few machines are hit, it
  does not matter in the slightest. The gas will be disseminated just the same
  when the plane hits the ground. Even in an open district, such as Aldershot,
  the effect should be considerable, though not so deadly as in a confined
  space."</p>

  <p>Drummond was gazing at him speechlessly, and Menalin smiled.</p>

  <p>"You may think," he continued, "that I am trying to harrow your
  imagination; possibly that I am exaggerating. My dear sir&mdash;why should I?
  In a few hours you will be dead, so what could be my object?"</p>

  <p>"But what <i>is</i> your object in such a devilish scheme?" shouted
  Drummond.</p>

  <p>"The finish of England as a world power," said Menalin, and though he
  spoke calmly his eyes were gleaming. "For centuries you have taken what you
  want, and done what you want; for centuries you have ridden rough shod over
  anyone who crossed your path. And now you have been so amazingly foolish as
  to cut down your fighting forces, when the countries who loathe and detest
  you have increased theirs. True you are thinking of increasing them again;
  but, my friend, it is too late. And I can imagine nothing more dreadful and
  humiliating to an erstwhile great power than the position you have recently
  found yourselves in. Egged on by wild theorists, both lay and clerical, your
  government has brandished a stick which, when its bluff was called, turned
  out to be a paper wand. And the utterly incomprehensible thing, to me, is
  that you must have known what the result was going to be before you
  started."</p>

  <p>"Let's cut that out," said Drummond harshly. "Who are flying these
  planes?"</p>

  <p>[*]"The ... of course."</p>

  <blockquote>
    <small>[* AUTHOR'S NOTE&mdash;In view of the tension that still exists in
    the European situation to-day, it has been considered advisable to suppress
    Menalin's reply. But it should not be difficult for the reader to fill the
    gap.]</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>"And are they doing this bomb business also?" continued Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Not entirely. One might almost say that that is cosmopolitan, though many
  of your own countrymen are involved in it. You must surely be aware, Captain
  Drummond of the immense number of people who in the old days were called
  Anarchists, and now disguise themselves as Communists or Workers of the
  World. But a rose by any other name...And when it comes down to brass tacks
  the main plank of their creed is destruction of the capitalist. You'll find a
  cell of them in every big works, and all we have done is to harness their
  activities to our own ends.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," he went on, "great care has been necessary in dealing with
  them. Even now the vast majority of them will only receive their orders at
  the last moment when they are actually issued with the tins. So that, if
  mistakes have been made, and some of them communicate with the police, it
  will be too late for the authorities to do anything."</p>

  <p>Drummond sat staring at him dully, and it was Algy who suddenly spoke.</p>

  <p>"What do you get out of it, you bloody swine?" he said.</p>

  <p>Menalin swung round and stared at him.</p>

  <p>"I'd quite forgotten the village idiot," he remarked. "Though I must
  really congratulate you on the way you played the role. Tell me&mdash;how did
  you hear of the island of Varda?"</p>

  <p>"It gave you a bit of a jolt didn't it, hog hound? Why&mdash;everybody
  knows of it, you poor fish."</p>

  <p>Drummond gave him a quick glance; Algy was no fool and it was a possible
  line to take up.</p>

  <p>"That," said Menalin calmly, "is a lie. But evidently somebody does."</p>

  <p>"And so," continued Algy, "it has really been most entertaining listening
  to your ridiculous scheme. We realise that you can kill us with some ease,
  but I don't think murder will make it any better for you when you're
  caught."</p>

  <p>"Please don't relapse to the idiot level, Mr. Longworth," begged Menalin.
  "It hurts me when you do. Can you really imagine that we have not guarded
  against the possibility of the island being discovered?"</p>

  <p>He lit another cigarette, and Drummond made an urgent sign to Algy to
  signal him out of action. The man's overweening conceit might make him
  speak.</p>

  <p>"Every good general," continued Menalin, "has a line of retreat. And this
  old house with its marvellous facilities for our purpose, was not quite safe
  enough as it stood. There is, of course, nothing incriminating in this house
  at all; everything is in the island. But it was obvious that we might come
  under suspicion, in which case we had to allow for the possibility of the
  police doing what you gentlemen have done to-night. And so, to obviate that
  risk, we mined the part of the tunnel that goes under the sea. Fire that
  mine&mdash;and it is fired electrically from here&mdash;and a seal of water,
  eighty yards long, forms between the island and the mainland..."</p>

  <p>"Jolly for the birds on the island," drawled Drummond. "And for all the
  pretty fruit tins which would seem to lose some of their efficacy."</p>

  <p>"I said a line of retreat, Captain Drummond. There is another exit from
  the island on the side looking out to sea. Impracticable, it is true, when it
  is rough, but feasible when calm. It would be a nuisance to have to use it,
  as it entails boats and a ship, instead of transport by lorry. But it is
  there just in case of necessity."</p>

  <p>The door flung open and Stangerton returned.</p>

  <p>"It's taken me all this time to get through," he cried.
  "However&mdash;it's all right. Mr. Burton is starting at once."</p>

  <p>Menalin glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"So he should be here about nine to-morrow&mdash;or rather this morning.
  Well," he continued, getting up and stretching himself. "I think I shall
  retire to bed again. I have enjoyed our chat immensely, Captain Drummond, and
  I shall doubtless see you once again. You had better leave a couple of armed
  men on guard, Stangerton. I have a wholesome respect for these young
  men."</p>

  <p>He yawned, and went up the steps.</p>

  <p>"Good night to you all; good night."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind him and Stangerton went to the entrance of the
  tunnel.</p>

  <p>"Come in here," he called out, and the men who had lashed them up in the
  first instance entered. "I leave them in your charge," he continued. "And
  don't let there be any error."</p>

  <p>"Trust us," said the man with the broken jaw, kicking Drummond in the
  ribs. "There ain't going to be no perishing error."</p>

  <p>Stangerton followed Menalin, and silence fell on the room. At the
  table&mdash;their guns in front of them&mdash;sat the three guards smoking.
  Peter still sprawled unconscious on the floor; Drummond and Algy, arms and
  legs lashed, leaned uncomfortably against the wall. Once in a while came an
  involuntary grunt of pain from Algy, for his arm was hurting abominably;
  otherwise there was silence.</p>

  <p>Nine o'clock in the morning; could nothing be done before that?
  Ceaselessly the problem went round and round in Drummond's brain. He had
  tried the lashing behind his back, and given it up. An expert in the art
  himself, he recognised another expert's handiwork. And even if he did get his
  arms loose, what was the good? His feet would still be lashed, and he
  couldn't undo them unseen.</p>

  <p>Nine o'clock! Ginger Lawson would not begin to be uneasy until the whole
  day had gone by without receiving a wire. Under no circumstances could he be
  there until the following day. And that would be twenty-four hours too late.
  By that time they would be dead and their bodies dumped two hundred miles
  away. If there was only some way of getting the information through. Even a
  clue...</p>

  <p>God! What a scheme! Out-Vernes Jules Verne...And Jimmy Latimer had known
  nothing about the gas! Moreover&mdash;and there lay the appalling side of
  it&mdash;the thing was practicable. A few bombs might go wrong; a few
  aeroplanes might crash&mdash;what did it matter? There would be a trail of
  death and destruction over England beside which the devastated areas of
  France in the last war would have appeared as smiling fields. And suddenly he
  gave a short laugh...</p>

  <p>"Glad you find it funny," sneered one of the men at the table.</p>

  <p>"Frightfully," said Drummond.</p>

  <p>He had just visualised the scream of merriment with which the whole story
  would be greeted at the Golden Boot...Or in his club...</p>

  <p>He could hear the remarks.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellah&mdash;fancy resurrecting that old fable...Why, the damn'
  thing came out of the ark with Noah."</p>

  <p>And yet it was practicable; the more he turned the scheme over in his mind
  the more did he become convinced of that fact. Even if the results were not
  all that Menalin expected, the material damage inflicted would be enormous,
  apart altogether from the ghastly loss of life. Even if they were able to
  fight on, and the blow was not an absolute knock-out, the dice would be
  hideously loaded against them.</p>

  <p>At length he fell into an uneasy doze. He was utterly exhausted; not even
  his magnificent constitution could last for ever. The fight on top of the
  doings of the last few days had temporarily finished him. And when he opened
  his eyes again a dull grey light was filtering through a grimy, cobwebbed
  window high up in the wall. Day had dawned, and with it full recollection
  came flooding back.</p>

  <p>The three men still sat at the table; the electric bulbs still shone in
  the smoke-laden air. And in the distance the thump-thump of the machine
  proclaimed that work on the island had started again.</p>

  <p>He looked across at Algy, who was muttering deliriously to himself; he
  looked at Peter who still lay unconscious on the floor. And for those two
  things he gave thanks. They, at any rate, would be spared the hours of
  waiting for the inevitable end.</p>

  <p>Footsteps sounded on the floor above; the house was awake. And he wondered
  apathetically what the time was. How long was there to go? How long before
  Burton arrived?</p>

  <p>Like most people he had often wondered what were the feelings of a man in
  the condemned cell when he woke on that last fateful morning. And now he was
  in the same position himself. Fear? No, he was not afraid. His principal
  emotion was one of rage at his helplessness. If only he could get free, even
  for one half-minute...And in a fit of almost childish fury he strained at the
  rope round his arms; strained till the veins stood out on his forehead...</p>

  <p>Suddenly the door opened and Stangerton came down the steps.</p>

  <p>"All right?" he asked. "Given no trouble?"</p>

  <p>"None at all," said the leader of the guard. "The guy with the wounded arm
  has gone a bit queer, and the big feller has been asleep."</p>

  <p>"Is the other one dead?"</p>

  <p>"No. He's breathing. But he hasn't moved since I hit him."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;it's over now. Mr. Burton has arrived sooner than I thought he
  would. Are you ready, Captain Drummond?"</p>

  <p>And just for the fraction of a second Hugh Drummond's mouth went dry.</p>

  <p>"Delightful of you to ask me," he said after a short pause. "I take it
  that it doesn't much matter whether I am or not."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry that it is necessary," remarked Stangerton quietly. "Unlash his
  legs."</p>

  <p>So they were going to move him, and for an instant wild hope surged up in
  his breast. Anyway, it was better than being killed like a trussed pig.</p>

  <p>He got stiffly to his feet, and stood swaying slightly. "Up the stairs,
  please," said Stangerton. "Two of you come with him."</p>

  <p>He found himself in the hall. At the foot of the stairs Burton was talking
  earnestly to Menalin, and Stangerton joined them. The matter under discussion
  was evidently important; the words "urgent" and "vital" caught his ear, as he
  glanced idly round.</p>

  <p>He felt a curious sense of detachment&mdash;almost of unreality&mdash;now
  that the end had come. On a table by an open window lay a large hypodermic
  syringe; beside it stood a blue medicine bottle. And even as he stared at
  them curiously, it happened. Like lightning a hand shot in from outside
  holding a similar bottle, which it substituted for the first.</p>

  <p>Drummond felt his mouth opening; the thing had been so quick that he could
  hardly believe his eyes. Who did the hand belong to? The men guarding him had
  seen nothing; the other three were far too engrossed in their conversation to
  have noticed. Who did the hand belong to? What did it mean? And the wild hope
  he had felt in the cellar below came surging back again.</p>

  <p>"We must get off at once." He heard Burton's voice from across the hall.
  "Will you tell Dorina? I'll get this done, and then we'll have our
  inspection. Now Captain Drummond, I'm sorry matters should have come to this,
  but I understand Mr. Menalin has explained the situation to you."</p>

  <p>He picked up the bottle and the syringe.</p>

  <p>"I can assure you of one thing; it is perfectly painless. You will just
  fall asleep. Unlash his wrists and roll up that sleeve."</p>

  <p>His mind a seething medley of conflicting thoughts, Drummond felt the
  prick of a needle in his arm. And then his brain grew ice-cold. He must
  act&mdash;act for his hope of life.</p>

  <p>"You will just fall asleep."</p>

  <p>Burton's words rang in his ears; so be it&mdash;he would. "Lay him on the
  floor," came Burton's order, and the two guards put him down.</p>

  <p>Act&mdash;act for his life. And for more than his life; for the
  possibility of defeating them after all. So he stared at Burton with a sneer
  on his face, then let his eyes close, only to force them open again with a
  great effort. Closed again; opened. And then at last they did not open...</p>

  <p>"Good," said Burton quietly. "Now the other two."</p>

  <p>"How long before he's dead?" asked Stangerton.</p>

  <p>"It varies. He's a very powerful man, so that in his case it may be ten
  minutes. But he'll never wake again. Have you told Dorina?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." It was Menalin speaking. "She'll be ready in half an hour. And she
  doesn't want to come to the island."</p>

  <p>"Half an hour will just give us comfortable time," said Burton.</p>

  <p>Came the sound of footsteps descending into the cellar, and still Drummond
  lay motionless, eyes closed, breathing deeply. Of ill effects he felt no
  trace; whatever it was that was in the second bottle was harmless.</p>

  <p>And now there began a period of tension which well nigh drove him crazy.
  For there had dawned on him a scheme so utterly gorgeous in its simplicity
  that he could scarcely lie still in his excitement. If only he could do
  it...</p>

  <p>From the cellar came the sound of voices, but he did not know if they were
  all down there, or whether someone had been left on guard. He dared not open
  his eyes, though the temptation to do so was almost overwhelming. He must
  wait...wait...</p>

  <p>Suddenly he felt that someone was bending over him, and a voice whispered
  "Drummond." He looked up; it was Talbot.</p>

  <p>"Got a gun?" he whispered and Talbot shook his head. "Then hide yourself
  and stand by to help."</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes and listened. No time now to wonder how Talbot had got
  there; no time for anything but his plan...</p>

  <p>The minutes dragged on leaden feet; a clock near by ticked maddeningly.
  And then came a sentence from the cellar.</p>

  <p>"The damned dope doesn't seem to have had any effect on this crazy guy. Go
  and see how the big stiff is getting on."</p>

  <p>Drummond smiled inwardly; Algy, being delirious, would naturally have
  shown no reaction to a harmless injection. Then he braced himself; the moment
  had come. Steps were ascending the stairs; one of the guards was stooping
  over him and he had held his breath.</p>

  <p>"This one's a goner," the man sang out, and the words died away in a
  strangled scream of terror. For the goner had wrenched the gun from his hand,
  and had him by the throat in a grip of such ferocity that his eyes were
  starting from his head. And the next instant he was rushed backwards to the
  top of the cellar stairs.</p>

  <p>The two men below were staring in amazement; amazement which turned to
  terror as they looked up. "Shoot," howled one. "He's got a gun."</p>

  <p>Two shots rang out, and Drummond felt them thud into the back of the man
  he held. And then two more, and from Drummond's side there came a quick gasp.
  For Talbot was standing there, and Talbot was no mean shot himself. And
  Talbot had seen two faces cease to be faces as a bullet crashed home in each.
  Drummond had shot to kill...</p>

  <p>His grip relaxed on the man he held, who toppled over and fell like a sack
  to the floor below. And for one moment Drummond stood motionless, his head
  thrown back. Then he gave a bellow of triumph; he had done it. For the shaft
  was mined, and in front of him was the switch-board.</p>

  <p>It was the third key he pressed that did it. From far off there came a
  dull rumble that seemed to shake the house, followed by a terrific blast of
  air that swept from the entrance of the tunnel. Then silence&mdash;save for
  Algy's delirious muttering...</p>

  <p>"Quick," cried Drummond. "Follow me."</p>

  <p>He raced from the house with Talbot behind him, and made for the edge of
  the cliff. There&mdash;the first time he had seen it from the
  outside&mdash;lay the island of Varda, its red cliffs rising sheer from the
  water. And half way between it and the mainland there floated a mass of dirt
  and timber, which still eddied lazily in the oily swell.</p>

  <p>"Trapped," said Drummond quietly. "Like rats. I wonder if they'll
  bolt."</p>

  <p>But that they were never destined to see. Suddenly the whole island seemed
  to split open in front of them. A sheet of flame shot into the sky; rocks,
  chairs, bedsteads, men and portions of men were hurled upwards and outwards
  to finish finally in a sea that now boiled angrily as tons of stuff fell into
  it.</p>

  <p>Appalled, yet fascinated they watched, until the last echo had died away;
  the last traces had vanished beneath the water. From out to sea came the wail
  of a syren&mdash;for the day was misty; above their heads ten thousand gulls
  screamed discordantly. And over what had once been the Island of Varda there
  drifted sluggishly a pink cloud...</p>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII. &mdash; A DOUBLE TOAST</a></h2>

  <p>And so it ended in failure&mdash;that monstrous and diabolical plot. What
  caused the ammonal in the island cavern to explode must remain for ever
  uncertain. One man and one man only was saved and his mind was deranged. He
  was picked up in the sea clinging to a baulk of wood. And sometimes in the
  night he would wake and shriek&mdash;"Don't shoot. For God's sake, don't
  shoot. You'll kill us all"&mdash;till he lay back exhausted and drenched with
  sweat.</p>

  <p>And it may well be that in that dark cave, the lights extinguished, the
  tunnel blown in, blind panic reigned. Men fought and screamed; guns were
  drawn. And some chance bullet found its target in the high explosive. But as
  I say it will never be known.</p>

  <p>Of the woman Dorina, no trace was ever seen again. When Drummond and
  Talbot returned to the house her car had gone; only the one in which Burton
  had come from Birchington Towers remained&mdash;the one in which Talbot had
  travelled, hidden in the boot.</p>

  <p>For he, in accordance with Drummond's orders, had been on the watch when
  the telephone call from Stangerton came through. And he had overheard it. He
  had seen Burton's preparations, and had managed to get hold of a similar
  bottle which he filled with water. Then with a tremendous effort he had
  squeezed himself into the boot, and thus had he come at the crucial moment to
  Hooting Carn.</p>

  <p>So that there may be some who will say that it is he to whom the principal
  credit should be given; that save for him Drummond would have died. Others
  may claim that, save for Ronald Standish's message about the Island of Varda,
  the scheme would have succeeded. As for me, I prefer Hugh Drummond's own
  opinion.</p>

  <p>It was expressed at a dinner party he gave three weeks later&mdash;a party
  I was privileged to attend. Ronald had returned; Humphrey Gasdon had come
  over from Paris. Ginger Lawson was there, and Talbot; Algy with his arm in a
  sling&mdash;Peter still very shaky. And two others, who sat, one on each side
  of their host.</p>

  <p>The port had gone round, and suddenly Drummond rapped on the table, and
  stood up.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said quietly, "there is only one possible toast to-night,
  and that is a double one. To the girl who walked on the Downs, and to the
  girl who walked in her sleep."</p>
