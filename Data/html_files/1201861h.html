<h3>WHAT THIS STORY IS ABOUT</h3>

<p class="first"><i>During a few short weeks, four persons
residing in adjoining towns and villages upon the coast of
Suffolk had mysteriously disappeared from their homes, leaving no
traces behind them. The local authorities were disinclined to
move in the matter, but Scotland Yard was doubtful if all these
disappearances could be merely coincidences, and despatched
Gilbert Larose to determine if the country-side were not choking
under the grip of an unknown and bloody assassin.</i></p>

<p><i>Another thrilling adventure of the great international detective.</i></p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I. &mdash; BIRDS OF PREY</h2>

<p class="first">GRIM and grey was Thralldom Castle. Eight
hundred years and more its mighty walls had reared their heights
to Heaven, scorched by the suns, buffeted by the tempests and
fretted by the lashing rains.</p>

<p>Old, old was its story and many were the dark and sinister
secrets that it held. Its dungeons had echoed to the groans of
the dying and its vaults had witnessed many a hurried burial of
the dead. All down the ages the tides of battle had beaten round
it, cruel and devouring as the storm driven tides of the sea. Its
great stones had been hewn and fashioned in the days of the
lance, the battleaxe, and the arrow, and the turmoil and din of
battle had been its cradle song and the anthem of its later
years.</p>

<p>Generation upon generation of the fierce lords of Thralldom
had been born there, and always the lust of strife and conflict
had flowed strongly in their veins. Often, in the heyday of
Merrie England they had fought for their kings, and often, again,
they had fought against them, but always, the shadow of their
might had loomed dark and chilling upon the country-side.</p>

<p>And now the last of the Thralldoms lived there, Roger, 27th
lord of Thralldom, a frail, worn, and childless old man.</p>

<p>Grim and grey was Thralldom Castle.</p>


<p><br>
THE well-dressed man spoke irritably, and with a frown upon his handsome, but rather dissipated-looking face.</p>

<p>"The telephone wires are all laid underground, there are
burglar alarms to every door and window, and there is a bell in
the belfry of the east tower that can be heard five miles away.
There are four men-servants and at night they are all armed. The
great door of the castle is locked and barred at ten and opened
for no one after then. There is a strong steel grille cutting off
the hall and, at the entrance to the picture gallery there is an
even stronger one." He nodded emphatically. "I tell you the whole
place is guarded like a prison and"&mdash;he flicked the ashes
from his cigarette&mdash;"there are paintings there worth a
hundred thousand pounds."</p>

<p>Four men were seated in a long oak-panelled room of an old
house that stood close beside the sea-shore upon a lonely stretch
of the Suffolk coast. It was late afternoon, the light was waning
and the moan of the sea mingled with their low voices. From the
windows, it could be seen that the sky was overcast with heavy
clouds. A storm was working up from over the sea.</p>

<p>"And you can suggest then no way at all in which we can get
in, Captain?" asked a tall, shrewd-looking man, with a small
Vandyke beard, speaking with a slight American twang. He added
sharply: "Surely, after all this time and with all the
opportunities you have had, you must have formed some ideas."</p>

<p>"No satisfactory ones, Hudson," was the reply. "The place
seems absolutely fool-proof to me."</p>

<p>"But with you staying right in the castle," went on the
American, obviously in some annoyance, "could you not arrange for
some door or window to be left unsecured one night?"</p>

<p>"Impossible," replied Captain Bonnett, "for directly it is
dark, two of the men go round and bolt and lock every door and
set the alarms, and as often as not, Lord Thralldom goes with
them to see that it is properly done. He's a tottering old man,
but he's fierce, and rules the castle with a rod of iron. As for
the windows, they are barred outside with thick steel bars, and
if you lift any of the sashes at night, the alarm rings instantly
in the hall." He shook his head frowningly. "Besides, the only
way in which you can approach the castle at all is through the
big spiked doors on the drawbridge and they are locked at ten and
an alarm switched on that would wake the dead."</p>

<p>"But we could avoid the drawbridge altogether," said Hudson,
"by getting over across the moat."</p>

<p>"Ten feet deep," commented the captain dryly, "and a barbed
wire fence on both banks." He shook his head again. "No, old
Thralldom has thought of everything and we have a hard nut to
crack."</p>

<p>"But I am certain, Captain Bonnett," said a third man with a
high forehead, and the long and oval face of an artist, "that
this secret passage under the moat exists. As I have told you, it
is referred to most definitely three times in those 'Chronicles
of East Anglia,' and the writer, from his perfectly confident
tone, evidently knew what he was writing about."</p>

<p>The captain sighed. "But what good is that to us, Fenner," he
replied, "if we don't know where the passage is?" He raised his
voice a little. "But, mind you, I agree that the passage exists
and I am certain Thralldom knows about it, too, for I brought up
the matter casually at dinner last night, and he denied all
knowledge of it in a way that made me suspicious at once. He
seemed most annoyed that I had mentioned it, and pressed me as to
where I had got the idea. But I just told him all old castles
were supposed to have secret passages and tried to pass it off at
that. Still, he was annoyed, as I say, and showed his annoyance
plainly."</p>

<p>"Of course he'd know all about it," exclaimed Hudson testily.
"It's not likely that a man whose ancestors have been at
Thralldom Castle for all these hundreds of years would not know
everything about his own place." He snapped his fingers
disdainfully. "But he's not going to shout about it to all the
world, especially now he's got that Rubens there."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow we ought to be making more efforts than we are
to find it," said Fenner warmly, "for its discovery would solve
our greatest difficulty at once." He raised one long slim
forefinger solemnly. "Remember, the information I have obtained
about it is exclusive, for it must have been more than 300 years
since anyone had touched that manuscript until I chanced upon it
among the archives in the Cathedral Library at Norwich. As I have
told you, it was dated 1586, and the writing was so faded that I
could hardly read it." He looked round challengingly at the
others. "I risked my whole career in taking it, and I say we
ought to concentrate upon finding the opening to that
passage."</p>

<p>The captain shook his head. "But it is not practical, Fenner,
for if you went searching anywhere in the castle grounds you'd be
seen and it would be reported to Lord Thralldom at once."</p>

<p>"But I've been searching at night," replied Fenner quickly,
"and these last three nights I have located several likely spots
and one particularly&mdash;the ruins of the Priory, for it was
built about the same time as the castle and, although it is at
least 300 yards away, still, the lie of the land would favour a
passage there. I can only search, however, when there's a moon,
for its dangerous crossing over the marshes in the dark."</p>

<p>Silas Hudson looked contemptuous. "Well, I don't think much of
your secret passage and I never did." He turned sharply to the
captain. "Have you made any attempt to look for it inside the
castle?"</p>

<p>The captain seemed greatly amused. "Made any attempt!" he
laughed. "Why,&mdash;although I've been his guest there for
nearly three weeks now, and although he has known me since I was
a boy and my father before me for nearly all his life&mdash;he
would trust me little more than he would a perfect stranger and
the walled-up part of the castle is barred to me, as to everyone
else." His voice hardened in emphasis. "I tell you, now he's
bought that Rubens, the safety of his paintings has become an
obsession with him, a perfect mania, and since his friend, the
Earl of Blair, lost those two Hogarths, night and day he is
terrified that Thralldom Castle is going to be raided. He is
crazed about it, and I hear him asking the servants a dozen times
a day if they have noticed any suspicious strangers about." He
shrugged his shoulders. "As to exploring any of the underground
parts on my own&mdash;why, he's had a big iron door fitted at the
top of the stairs leading to the dungeons and it's always kept
locked."</p>

<p>A fourth man spoke gruffly. "Well, if a door can be locked, it
can be unlocked, and I'd like to see the one that would trouble
me for long."</p>

<p>The last speaker was quite different in appearance from any of
the three men who had already spoken. He was obviously of the
superior artisan class and dark and swarthy of complexion, and
short and thick in stature, there was nothing attractive about
him. His expression was a quarrelsome one, and he was now
regarding his companions from scowling eyes under big and bushy
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"All right, Kelly," said the captain in a careless, offhanded
way, "we don't doubt that, of course, and if we could only put
you alongside any door, I am sure that part of the business would
be easy." He turned back to the others. "But I admit I'm quite at
a dead-end now, and unless chance comes to our aid, I have little
hope of our getting at any of those paintings." He added
impatiently. "I've been there nearly three weeks already, and I
can't stretch out the copying of that Turner for ever. If I
hadn't been pretty competent with my brush, he'd have been
suspicious of me long before now, but I'm really surprised at the
colours I've managed to put in."</p>

<p>"Those burglar alarms could be knocked out of action, quick
and lively," said Kelly, "and once in the castle, I'd soon make
short work of them." He regarded the captain resentfully. "Surely
they must go to sleep there sometime. They can't be keeping awake
all night."</p>

<p>"That's true enough, Kelly," replied the captain, "but how to
get you all into the castle when they are taking that sleep, and
arrange for you to work undisturbed, is the difficulty."</p>

<p>"You may think the castle fool-proof," went on Kelly
brusquely, "but if I could get a squint inside, I reckon I could
soon find a weak place somewhere."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it," exclaimed Hudson, quickly, "and that's been
our mistake. Kelly's the practical man when it comes to breaking
in anywhere, and he ought to have been given a chance to look
round."</p>

<p>"Quite so, Hudson," commented the captain dryly, "and it's so
simple that I only wonder we did not think of it before." He
smiled sarcastically. "We might drop his lordship a
line&mdash;'Mr. Kelly presents his compliments and would like to
look over the castle, with a view to effecting a forcible entry
later on. If his lordship has no objection, Mr. Kelly will leave
his bag of tools, ready to hand, just outside the premises.'"</p>

<p>"You're funny," snarled Kelly, "but it's not funny business we
want, and as for those armed men-servants, I'm not worrying about
them. I met one of the footmen in the bar of the Westleton pub
last week, and, although he's a big lout of a chap, there
wouldn't be much fight in him, besides"&mdash;and he looked more
unattractive than ever&mdash;"two could play at that game,
couldn't they?"</p>

<p>"But no violence, Kelly," exclaimed the American quickly. "I
would never countenance that. We want a peaceful acquisition of
those paintings, and we must come and go in complete secrecy. No
one must see or hear us, and we must leave no trails behind."</p>

<p>"That's all very well," growled Kelly, "but how are we going
to do it?" He laughed coarsely. "As for violence&mdash;you were
pretty ready with your knuckle-duster, weren't you, that
afternoon in the Jew's shop in Houndsditch? I remember
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do," interrupted Hudson hastily. "Our hands were
forced then, and we had to make a quick getaway at any cost." He
shook his head and looked very stern. "But Thralldom is not
Houndsditch, Kelly, and those methods won't do here."</p>

<p>Kelly scoffed contemptuously and then directed his black looks
again upon the captain. "And you told us it was going to be an
easy job directly you got into the castle," he said sourly, "and
the boss put up the money and rigged you up to go visiting your
flash friends, and now after all these weeks,"&mdash;he
sneered&mdash;"you come here and tell us the time's been wasted
and there's nothing doing."</p>

<p>The captain reddened angrily. "Well, you don't want to be told
a pack of lies do you? I'm doing my part and shirking nothing."
He thumped his fist upon the table. "I'm up to the neck in this
as deep as any of you, and if the thing's going to be done at
all, I'll see it's going to be done properly, and we'll attempt
nothing unless there's a reasonable chance of success." He
dropped his voice suddenly to a cold contemptuous tone. "You
can't barge into Thralldom Castle, Mr. Kelly, like a bull
crashing through a gate. It needs thought and preparation and a
certain amount of intelligence as well." He spoke most politely.
"So we'll decide what is best to be done, Mr. Kelly, and then
when the purely mechanical part is required"&mdash;he
bowed&mdash;"your services will be most handy, I am sure."</p>

<p>Kelly looked as black as thunder and was obviously about to
make some furious retort when the American broke in quickly.</p>

<p>"All right, all right," he said, "we'll take it you are doing
your best, but all the same, it's annoying with expenses mounting
up every day and nothing to show for them." He turned the subject
abruptly. "Why didn't Lord Thralldom answer Fenner's letter?"</p>

<p>"He never will let people in to view his paintings," replied
Captain Bonnett, "and it's his craze now to keep everyone away
from the castle."</p>

<p>"But Fenner wrote he was the curator of the Norwich Art
Gallery," went on Hudson, "and that should have been a passport
anywhere." He pursed up his lips as if he were very puzzled.
"Fenner wrote a most courteous letter."</p>

<p>"Too courteous," laughed the captain, "and so he just threw it
in the waste-paper basket in consequence." He nodded his head.
"Now, if Fenner had written and called him a selfish old fool for
keeping his paintings to himself, he'd have probably taken some
notice of the letter and sent an angry reply. He's a fiery old
fellow, his lordship."</p>

<p>The American whistled. "Oh! he's like that, is he? Well, I'll
write and call him one," he exclaimed. "I'll string him on into
starting a correspondence and then perhaps I may get a look into
the castle that way." His voice rose excitedly. "Yes, I know what
I'll do. I'll write and tell him that his precious Rubens is not
genuine. I'll write and say it's only an early Van Dyck." He
rubbed his hands together. "That'll rattle him. He's sure to have
heard of me as a dealer of some standing, and if I give that as
my considered opinion, he's bound to take notice." He beamed
round at the others. "I know these crazy collectors, and if you
can only manage them properly, you can draw them every time. What
do you say. Captain?"</p>

<p>The captain looked thoughtful. "Not at all a bad idea," he
said after a moment. "You write like that and when he gets your
letter I'll boost you up and say you're the biggest noise in the
picture world over in New York. I'll tell him&mdash;&mdash;" He
stopped suddenly and eyed the American intently. "But if he's
heard of you, he may have heard some queer things, Hudson. You've
been in the newspapers a few times, remember, and although no
one's been successful in their actions against you, still
there've been some nasty remarks published about you."</p>

<p>"And I could have sued those who made them, if I'd wanted to,"
replied Hudson quickly, "but it wasn't worth my while."</p>

<p>"No-o," agreed the captain slowly, "it wasn't worth your
while, was it."</p>

<p>"But where do I come in?" asked Kelly, frowningly, of the
American. "Your getting into the castle will be no more good to
us than the captain, here."</p>

<p>"Oh! won't it?" exclaimed Hudson gleefully. "You just see. If
old Thralldom says I can inspect his Rubens, then I'll take you
in with me as my servant as a matter of course. I'll make out I'm
crippled with rheumatism and can't walk without your help." He
turned to the captain. "What do you say to that, Bonnett?"</p>

<p>Captain Bonnett nodded. "If you can screw Thralldom up to the
point of agreeing to let you into his gallery, I don't suppose
he'd mind Kelly coming too." He laughed spitefully. "But Kelly'll
have to cultivate a slightly more agreeable look, or the whole
business may fall through directly he sees him."</p>

<p>Kelly made no comment and contented himself with regarding the
speaker contemptuously.</p>

<p>The captain went on. "And another thing strikes me. If ever we
are successful at getting at those paintings, we shall have to be
devilish careful afterwards." He spoke impressively. "None of you
here can bolt away at once."</p>

<p>"We never intended doing so," replied Hudson smiling. "We
shall just hide the canvases and remain on here as simple
holiday-makers until things have blown over."</p>

<p>He laughed. "We've thought of somewhere to hide them, where no
one would look in a thousand years."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right," said the captain, "because apart
from Fenner being a known authority in the Art world and you a
dealer in pictures,"&mdash;he grinned&mdash;"friend Kelly's got a
sort of reputation as being an artist in his profession, too, and
the police would be interested in him at once."</p>

<p>"There's never been any conviction recorded against me,"
exclaimed Kelly quickly; "the police have nothing on me."</p>

<p>"That may be," commented the captain dryly, "but don't you
forget, Kelly, you've been up for trial, and the old judge said
then you were devilishly lucky to have been given the benefit of
the doubt, also&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well," interrupted the American, anxious to prevent any
quarrelling, "there's no need to go into that. We've got plenty
of other things to think about, and we must find a way of getting
that Rubens. After all this trouble we're not going to be beaten
by a dodderry old man."</p>

<p>"Oh! but he's not dodderry," said Captain Bonnett quickly,
"and don't you go imagining it for a moment. The old boy's
seventy-live, and weak and shaky in his legs, but in his mind
he's as keen and alert as he ever was and, except in the matter
of his paintings, he's a shrewd and capable old man."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll write that letter to him anyhow," commented
Hudson, "and pitch it in hot and strong and we'll see what'll
happen then." He stretched out his hand. "Now, pass over that
plan you've made and it'll be hard luck if it doesn't come in
useful some time."</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II. &mdash; THE LORD OF THRALLDOM</h2>

<p class="first">IT was breakfast time at Thralldom Castle and
four persons were seated at one end of a long table, in a very
large room that at one time had formed part of the old banqueting
hall.</p>

<p>The room was replete with every comfort and furnished in a
modern fashion with a rich, thick carpet covering the huge
floor.</p>

<p>The meal was proceeding with its usual ceremony, and three men
servants were in attendance, a butler and two footmen, with the
latter attired in the Thralldom livery of gold and green.</p>

<p>The owner of the castle was seated at the head of the table,
and notwithstanding his general appearance of weakness and ill-health, his sunken cheeks and pallor of complexion, he looked
every inch a great lord of Thralldom.</p>

<p>Tall and gaunt and of tremendous frame, it was evident that at
one time he had been of great strength, and if now his body were
yielding to the infirmities of age, there were yet all signs that
the spirit in him was still unquenched.</p>

<p>His whole mien was one of authority. He held his head in the
commanding poise of a man who was accustomed to be obeyed. The
lines of his face were set and stern, and his big, fierce eyes
glared out of their bony sockets with the same fire with which
his ancestors had glared over the battlefields of Agincourt and
Crecy.</p>

<p>That he was not in a particularly good humour that morning was
evidenced by the silence of the others participating in the
meal.</p>

<p>Lady Deering, his niece by marriage, made no attempt to start
any conversation; her step-daughter, Ann Devenham, was pensive
and thoughtful and his guest Marmaduke Bonnett, looked bored and
as if he would be glad when the meal were over.</p>

<p>Presently Lord Thralldom spoke, and his voice was deep and
vibrant and very different from what might have been expected
from his frail appearance.</p>

<p>"And are you sure, Bevan," he asked frowningly of the butler,
"that Rawlings had not arrived before I sat down?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, my lord," replied the butler with great
deference.</p>

<p>"But I ordered him to be here at a quarter to nine," went on
Lord Thralldom, looking round impressively at the others, "and
it's a nice thing when my bailiff does not condescend to obey my
orders."</p>

<p>"But he's generally most punctual, Uncle," remarked Lady
Deering, meekly, "and I never remember him being unpunctual
before." She was a pretty but rather faded-looking woman in the
middle forties and evidently stood in great awe of her lordly
relation.</p>

<p>"Well, he's not punctual this morning," boomed Lord Thralldom,
"and I shall have something to say about it when he arrives." His
voice hardened. "Ring up at once, Bevan, and ascertain why he's
late." He turned to his grand-niece and eyed her sternly. "You
look tired this morning, Ann. Didn't you sleep well, last
night?"</p>

<p>Ann Devenham had just turned twenty-one, and a charmingly
pretty girl, she showed all signs of her aristocratic ancestry.
She was slightly built but of a beautifully proportioned figure.
Her features were finely chiselled and she had large, very dark,
blue eyes. Ordinarily of a bright disposition, just now she
looked quiet and rather sad.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, Uncle," she replied in a melodious voice. "I
slept quite well."</p>

<p>"But you look tired," went on Lord Thralldom. "I expect you
had too many late nights last week at Saxmundham."</p>

<p>"But I didn't," replied the girl quickly. "The vicar would
only allow me to go out twice." She smiled. "He said he had
strict orders from you."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom eyed her solemnly. "But your sleep was broken
last night," he said. "You heard noises and were disturbed by the
hooting of the owls."</p>

<p>"No, I was not," replied the girl. "I heard no noises at all
and slept quite well, I tell you."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom turned to one of the footmen. "You heard
noises, you say, William? You heard the hooting of an owl?"</p>

<p>The footman addressed inclined his head in assent. "Several
times, my lord," he replied. "It kept me awake."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom frowned uneasily. "I don't like it," he
remarked. "It was very disquieting. I heard it many times."</p>

<p>"But what's wrong in that, sir?" asked Captain Bonnett,
looking very puzzled. "There are plenty of owls about here, and
night is their time to hoot."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom shook his head ominously. "But it wasn't an owl
that hooted. It was a man."</p>

<p>Captain Bonnett put down the cup he was in the act of raising
to his lips. "Good gracious!" he exclaimed, "but what was he
hooting for?"</p>

<p>"That's what we want to know," replied his lordship sternly.
"It was a signal of some sort. The castle is being watched." He
turned to the footman whom he had addressed before. "It didn't
sound like an owl, did it, William?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord," replied the footman instantly. "It didn't sound
like one."</p>

<p>"It was someone trying to imitate an owl, wasn't it?" went on
Lord Thralldom, and when William had at once acquiesced, he
turned to the other footman. "And you heard it, too, didn't you,
James?"</p>

<p>"Quite plainly, my lord," was the reply. "Several times."</p>

<p>His lordship looked satisfied. "Well, you always have your
automatics ready, both of you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," instantly replied the two footmen
together.</p>

<p>"Then don't hesitate to use them," said his lordship. "Shoot
at once if you see any movement below the castle, at night."</p>

<p>"Oh Uncle! But it would be so very dreadful if anyone were
killed," exclaimed Ann Devenham quickly. "It would be
terrible&mdash;and they might be quite innocent people."</p>

<p>"Not they," returned Lord Thralldom brusquely. "They'd
certainly be armed themselves, and at any rate, they'd be there
for no good purpose. If they come round here spying at night and
meet with any accident," he shrugged his shoulders, "then, that's
their own look out."</p>

<p>"But it frightens me," went on the girl impulsively, "the very
idea."</p>

<p>"Frightens you!" echoed Lord Thralldom. He laughed grimly.
"Why, there's nothing in killing a man when he's out to kill you.
It takes very little getting used to, and the novelty soon
passes." He stirred his coffee slowly and continued
reminiscently. "I was a young subaltern in India when I killed my
first man, and I remember it was just as dawn was breaking in a
deep valley between two high hills. I stabbed him in a hand-to-hand fight and I admit the look upon his face, as he fell,
haunted me for quite a little while"&mdash;he
frowned&mdash;"until I had had my breakfast, in fact, but after
that I might never have thought of it again if I had not happened
to have broken a good knife." He eyed Ann again very sternly.
"But nothing ought to frighten you, Ann, for you have Thralldom
blood in you and a Thralldom never knows fear."</p>

<p>"But I am frightened of lots of things," exclaimed the girl
quickly, "and if I thought as you do, I should be afraid to be
living here. Really, Uncle," she went on frowningly, "I am sure
you must be imagining everything."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom's eyes glowed like coals of fire. "I
imagining!" he retorted angrily. "You don't know what you are
talking about, girl." He clenched his bony hands together
convulsively. "Why, since I bought that Rubens, six months ago,
all eyes in the art world have been focused on this castle, and a
thousand miscreants, if one, are scheming to obtain it." His
voice rose in the intensity of his passion. "Night and day, if we
only knew it, we are being watched, and only the utmost vigilance
on our part can preserve my collection of paintings intact." He
glared round at everyone. "Night after night, when you have all
been sleeping, I have laboured up on to the battlements and seen
figures flitting through the mist. Yes, it may be thought that I
am mad and crazy in my precautions, but I realise, only too well,
that I am not."</p>

<p>The footmen preserved the uninterested and impassive
expressions of well-trained servants, but the others at the table
glanced covertly at one another and then turned down their
eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened and the butler glided in. "Well,"
enquired Lord Thralldom irritably, but dropping his voice at once
to a quieter tone, "why is not Rawlings here?"</p>

<p>The butler spoke very quickly and in some excitement, "He's
not at his home, my lord. He went out just before eleven and has
not been home all night. No one knows where he is, and Mrs.
Rawlings is very anxious. She thinks he must have met with some
accident."</p>

<p>A moment's silence followed and then Lord Thralldom exclaimed
angrily, "Rubbish! What possible accident can he have met with?"
He glared at the butler as if he were the offender. "More likely
she's had a quarrel with him and is afraid to say, and he's
absenting himself now to teach her a lesson." He looked round at
the others at the table. "His wife's a nagger and he's sick of
it. That's it." He waved to the butler. "At any rate, ring up
again and say I'm most annoyed."</p>

<p>The butler left the room and Lady Deering gave an amused
little laugh. "Really," she said, addressing herself to Captain
Bonnett, "it's becoming quite the fashion for husbands about here
to go off and leave their wives and now, if Rawlings has gone
off, he'll be the third one who has done so in the last few
weeks."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed Captain Bonnett politely.
"That's very strange."</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Lady Deering, "first there was Mr. McHenty,
from the bank in Saxmundham, who went off with a school-teacher
from Leiston, then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! Mother, don't be so horrid," broke in her stepdaughter
warmly. "You are only repeating the scandal of these little
towns. It may not be true at all that he went off with Miss
Pascoe. No one is sure of it. He may just have lost his memory,
like many over-worked people do and not remember where he
lives."</p>

<p>Lady Deering smiled indulgently. "Well, they both disappeared
the same night, dear, didn't they? And it came out afterwards,
too, that they were both upon unexpectedly friendly terms." She
turned again to Captain Bonnett. "Now it looks suspicious,
doesn't it? A middle-aged man and a young girl both missing at
the same time?"</p>

<p>The captain hesitated a moment. "On the face of it," he
replied judicially, "I am afraid it does. When did it happen?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"About a month ago," replied Lady Deering, "and nothing's been
heard of either of them since. Of course it created a great
sensation, because they were both naturally well-known where they
lived." She smiled again. "But really, as I say, this running
away seems to be quite infectious, for not a week after they were
missing, a man who keeps an inn at Yoxford, went off and left his
wife in exactly the same way. Everyone said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nagging wives," interrupted Lord Thralldom sharply. "I tell
you, men won't put up with what they did years ago, and Rawlings'
wife must have tried his temper quite a lot."</p>

<p>"Oh! Uncle," reproved Ann Devenham reproachfully, "She's not a
nagger. I'm sure of it. She's very quiet and good-tempered."</p>

<p>"Well, she never looks it to me," said Lord Thralldom coldly,
"and I'm not likely to be mistaken in a woman at my time of
life."</p>

<p>The butler brought in some letters upon a salver and handed
them round. There were several for Lord Thralldom, two for Lady
Deering and one for Ann. Ann did not open hers but, after one
quick glance at the handwriting, laid the envelope, face-downwards, upon the table and turning to Captain Bonnett began
talking to him in a subdued tone of voice.</p>

<p>The captain regarded her admiringly. She had beautiful, even,
white teeth and a very pretty mouth and when she talked or
smiled, an attractive dimple appeared upon her cheek. There was
nothing in any way intimate in the nature of their conversation,
and the girl was only apparently now indulging in it in order to
give her relatives an opportunity of going through their
correspondence undisturbed.</p>

<p>Presently rumbles of annoyance began to come from Lord
Thralldom, and as usual with him when upset, he began talking to
himself. He was reading a letter written in bold, big,
handwriting, and his lips quivered and his face grew furious as
his eyes travelled down the sheet.</p>

<p>"Impertinence!" he muttered, "insolence, a brazen piece of
effrontery!" He looked up suddenly with blazing eyes. "Listen to
this, Marmaduke," he said. "Can you conceive of greater impudence
in all your life?"</p>

<p>"What is it, sir?" asked the captain with an appearance of
great interest.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom spoke in a tone of concentrated fury. "A man
writes, a fellow writes"&mdash;he could hardly get his
breath&mdash;"that my Rubens is not genuine and that it is only
an early Van Dyck."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the captain, "quite a good joke." He
scoffed. "Some jealous crank, probably, who just writes to annoy
you."</p>

<p>"An early Van Dyck!" repeated Lord Thralldom breathlessly.
"What colossal impertinence!" He scowled. "It certainly does
annoy me. It annoys me a great deal."</p>

<p>"Well, tear it up," said the captain promptly, "and don't give
it another thought." He shook his head. "I can never understand
these anonymous letter-writers, wasting the price of a postage
stamp."</p>

<p>"But it's not anonymous," frowned Lord Thralldom. "He signs
his name and"&mdash;he scowled again at the sheet before
him&mdash;"it looks like 'Hudson'."</p>

<p>"Hudson! Hudson!" repeated the captain. "Well, that's a very
common name and I've never heard of any Hudson who knows anything
about paintings except a Yank, and he's a Silas Hudson, of New
York."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom was glancing at the letter in his hand. "This
signature," he said slowly, and there was just a little quiver in
his voice, "looks like 'Silas Hudson,' 'Silas Q. Hudson,' I
think."</p>

<p>The captain almost fell back in his chair in astonishment.
"Silas Q. Hudson!" he exclaimed. "Why that is he. Silas Quaver
Hudson, one of the greatest experts in the United States." He
leant forward excitedly. "Good heavens! What does he say?"</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom was now coldly contemptuous. "He writes this,"
he replied,</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">"I consider it my duty to inform you that I have strong
reasons for believing that 'The Man of Sorrows' you purchased
last March from Mr. Claud Happer is not a genuine Rubens. I think
I know the painting, and if so, it is one of the early works of
Van Dyck! If you wish, I shall be agreeable to examine it and
pronounce my opinion. I am approaching you, because I happen to
be in your neighbourhood and upon a holiday.</p>

<p class="letter">"Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Silas Q. Hudson</span>."</p>

<p><br>
A few moments' silence followed and then Lord Thralldom burst
out angrily. "The man's an imbecile, a perfect fool! How dare he
suggest such a thing?" He turned sharply to the captain. "You say
you know him?"</p>

<p>Captain Bonnett nodded. "Slightly," he replied. "I was
introduced to him, a couple of years or so back, in New York. I
just spoke to him and that was all, for, as usual, he was
monopolising all the conversation."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom glared. "Well, he's mad, isn't he, quite
mad?"</p>

<p>The captain shook his head. "I wouldn't like to say that, sir,
for"&mdash;he hesitated and then admitted as if with some
reluctance&mdash;"he's supposed to be about the cutest dealer on
the other side."</p>

<p>"The sharpest, perhaps, the most unscrupulous," sneered Lord
Thralldom. He lifted his hand suddenly. "Ah! I remember now. I've
heard of him. It was he who paid that poor widow in Denver two
thousand dollars for her Botticelli last year and sold it the
same week to Sir Charles Medway for more than ten times that
amount."</p>

<p>"Well, two thousand dollars," commented the captain slowly,
"was all the executors under the will asked, and Hudson was quite
justified in accepting those terms upon the spot, besides
"&mdash;and he smiled&mdash;"that widow was not in any way poor.
Her husband left her over a hundred thousand&mdash;not in
dollars, but in pounds."</p>

<p>"Well, Hudson's a rogue, anyhow," said Lord Thralldom, "and
I'd never trust him a yard." Anger flared up into his eyes again.
"But what does he know about my Rubens? He's never seen it?"</p>

<p>The captain looked very impartial. "Oh! I wouldn't like to say
that, sir. He's supposed to have seen every painting of note
that's come into the market during the last twenty years, and
remember&mdash;your 'Man of Sorrows' has changed hands three
times since Lord Molesbury died."</p>

<p>"Yes," sneered Lord Thralldom, "and in the salerooms the
greatest art experts in the world have examined it and pronounced
it genuine, so this Hudson's opinion is of no value and," he
snapped his fingers together&mdash;"I'll ignore him."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right," agreed the captain instantly. "Treat him
with contempt and don't reply to his letter." An idea seemed to
strike him suddenly and he shook his head slowly. "But the
fellow's a great talker and of course he'd broadcast it all about
that you don't dare to allow him to examine your painting."</p>

<p>"Don't dare?" sneered Lord Thralldom. "Don't condescend, you
mean!"</p>

<p>"And it'll be disappointing in a way," went on the captain
meditatively, "for I'd have loved to have watched him when you
showed him the Rubens. He's such a cocksure beggar and it would
have been such a slap in the face for him."</p>

<p>"Probably not," growled Lord Thralldom, "for whatever opinion
he'd come to&mdash;to save his own face he'd still stick to it
that he was right."</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed the captain most emphatically, "he'd never
do that, for whatever his faults, Art is an obsession with him.
His whole life is wrapped up in the works of the great masters
and he thinks of nothing but them." He spoke with enthusiasm.
"No, Silas Q. Hudson would grovel in abject humility before his
worst enemy, if that enemy possessed a canvas of great beauty or
note."</p>

<p>"Well, my 'Man of Sorrows' has great beauty," said Lord
Thralldom slowly, "and it's one of the great paintings of the
world," He was silent for a few moments and then went on
hesitatingly, "Really, from what you tell me of the fellow, I'd
like to humiliate him. I detest all Americans."</p>

<p>"Oh! you'd humiliate him right enough," laughed the captain.
"In two minutes he'd be as limp as a rag."</p>

<p>"What's he like to look at?" asked Lord Thralldom
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, you couldn't mistake him for anything else but an
American," was the reply. "He's tall and skinny and has a sharp,
hatchet face with hard, calculating eyes, and lips that are
pressed up tight. He'd walk in here as if he owned the earth,
with no respect for anyone, and as if he were better than you
and, indeed, it would almost be an act of grace, I think, if he
took off his hat."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom regarded the letter again. "And he's on the
telephone," he said slowly. "He's stopping at that old house on
Minsmere Haven." He suddenly snarled savagely. "Gad! I'll have
him up." He turned to the butler. "Ring up Minsmere House, Bevan.
Ask for a man called Hudson, and instruct him to come up here at
eleven this morning. Order him to be up at the exact time. And
you, William and James," he went on, "see to it the whole time
that this man is here, that you keep by him. Never leave his side
unless I order you to."</p>

<p>The old man, with no further appetite for his breakfast, then
rose shakily from his chair and with tottering steps, and leaning
heavily upon Lady Deering's arm, passed out of the room.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes or so later the Captain and Ann Devenham
were together in the music room. She had made a sign to him to
follow her, and never loth to dance attendance upon a pretty
girl, he had, with no demur, complied. But it was quickly
apparent that it was for no sentimental reason that she wished to
speak to him alone, for addressing him at once, she said
sharply,</p>

<p>"Captain Bonnett, I am very angry with you. You know what
uncle is and yet you deliberately egged him on to ask that
American to come up to the castle. It'll only upset him and
perhaps make him downright ill again." She stamped her foot. "I
don't know what you did it for, but you ought to have had more
sense."</p>

<p>Captain Bonnett's face flushed. The accusation was so direct
and so unexpected that, for the moment, he was not ready with any
reply.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the girl with her eyes flashing, "it was very
clever the way you did it, and you may have thought no one would
have seen through it, but I did."</p>

<p>The captain had quite recovered himself now, and smiled as if
he were amused. "But you are really too clever, Miss Devenham,
and like so many of your charming sex, too quick in jumping at
conclusions." His voice hardened resentfully. "I never tried to
influence your uncle in the slightest and am not in the least bit
interested in this man, Hudson, coming up."</p>

<p>"Well, it looked like it," said Ann Devenham, "and at any
rate, you might have influenced him the other way."</p>

<p>Captain Bonnett shrugged his shoulders. "But does it matter?"
he asked. "Besides, if you want my candid opinion, it'll do him
good. He wants to throw off this nonsensical idea that everybody
is trying to rob him." He lowered his voice to gentleness. "But
look here, Miss Devenham, you've not been at all nice to me these
last few days, in fact ever since you came back from Saxmundham.
I've noticed it in many ways. You're different from what you were
before you went away."</p>

<p>It was now the girl's turn to flush, but she answered quickly
enough. "I am sure I don't know what you mean. I am no different
from what I have ever been." She regarded him, as cold as ice. "I
was never particularly nice to you at any time, was I?"</p>

<p>"But you let me kiss you that night in the chapel," he
retorted, stung to anger by the contemptuous look she was now
giving him.</p>

<p>"Let you!" she exclaimed indignantly. "It was done before I
could prevent it. You kissed my arm when I was playing at the
organ, and if the matter had been worth mentioning I should have
spoken to my uncle about it." She inclined her head, and added
cuttingly, "But it was after dinner, Captain Bonnett."</p>

<p>"Bah! a woman always knows when a man is wanting to kiss her,"
scoffed the captain, "and you deliberately put temptation in my
way. You were quite&mdash;&mdash;" but the girl had turned
quickly and was leaving the room.</p>

<p>"Pretty little vixen," he remarked after she had gone. "She
wants a good slapping, and I'd like to be the one to give it to
her." He nodded his head smilingly. "But I'd make love to her
well, first."</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock, when Lord Thralldom was reading in the
great library of the castle, the door opened and the butler
announced, "That Mr. Hudson has arrived, my lord."</p>

<p>His lordship looked up sharply from his book. "Oh! he has, has
he?" he frowned. "Well, tell Captain Bonnett to come here and
then bring the man in."</p>

<p>Captain Bonnett was quickly on the spot, and a couple of
minutes or so later, Silas Hudson was ushered into the room. He
was accompanied by Kelly and was leaning heavily upon the
latter's arm. Kelly, dressed decorously in sober black and with
his hair well plastered down, was trying hard to assume what he
believed to be the correct appearance of a gentleman's
servant.</p>

<p>As Captain Bonnett had prophesied, there were certainly no
indications of any feelings of awe about the American, and the
moment he was within speaking distance of Lord Thralldom, and
almost, indeed, before he had crossed the threshold, of the
library door, he called out loudly,</p>

<p>"Good day, my lord. I'm up to time, you see."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom regarded him intently but in chilling silence,
and Captain Bonnett, standing close beside his lordship with
difficulty repressed a smile, for he was intrigued with the
spectacle of the truculent Kelly endeavouring to mask his
pugnacious features with lines of respectful servility.</p>

<p>Silas Hudson went on as if he were well content to be doing
all the greetings, "Nice little place you've got here&mdash;this
castle, and I reckon if you carried it across the water, I could
guarantee you a quarter of a million dollars for it, easy." He
looked round the walls of the room. "Pretty old, I should
say."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom turned to Captain Bonnett. "This is Mr.
Hudson?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>Captain Bonnett nodded. "Yes, he's Silas Q. Hudson, of New
York."</p>

<p>The American looked quickly at the captain. "I don't know you,
sir," he remarked, frowningly, "and I don't reckon I've seen you
before, but you've got me all right, and I'm Silas Q. Hudson and
no one else."</p>

<p>"And this other gentleman," asked Lord Thralldom sharply,
indicating Kelly, "who is he?"</p>

<p>"My body-servant and my masseur," replied Hudson promptly.
"It's my bad luck to have become rheumatic since I came over here
and I can't walk well without him." He patted Kelly on the
shoulder. "He's a capable fellow."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom regarded Hudson with contempt. "And you say you
have reason to believe"&mdash;he spoke with an effort&mdash;"that
a certain painting in my possession is not what it purports to
be; in other words, that it is a forgery."</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all," exclaimed the American loudly. "I
never used the word forgery. I believe your 'Man of Sorrows' may
be a true and very great painting but, from what I know of its
history, it was never suggested by anyone until within the last
fifty years that it was the work of P. P. Rubens."</p>

<p>He plunged headlong in the matter and went on glibly. "You
bought it from Happer, Happer bought it when Kreutz sent it up
for sale seven years ago, and we know everyone who has possessed
it since 1893. Prior to 1893, however, and back to the end of the
eighteenth century, we cannot trace any of its places of domicile
and my belief that it is purely a Van Dyke is based on the fact
that in 1797 it was sold by the heirs of Otto Hansen, of
Stuttgart, and Hansen was a known collector, almost exclusively,
of the paintings of that artist." He paused a moment to take
breath. "And that is why, my lord, I have consideredly formed the
opinion that your 'Man of Sorrows' is no work of Rubens at
all."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom's face had paled a little, and it was evident
that he was perturbed to some extent by the confident assurance
of the American dealer. He kept opening and shutting his mouth,
and moistening his lips with his tongue.</p>

<p>"But it is nonsense," he burst out angrily. "Not one&mdash;but
a hundred experts have examined my Rubens and pronounced it
genuine."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't done so," asserted Hudson truculently, "and
until I've looked it over, I keep to my opinion that it is not a
Rubens." He looked contemptuously in his turn at Lord Thralldom.
"But I'll tell you in one glance, if it's a Rubens or not. That's
my life's work and I've got paintings in my blood."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom composed himself with a strong effort. "Follow
me, then," he said haughtily. "I'll teach you a lesson."</p>

<p>"And I'm willing to learn one," almost shouted back Hudson.
"I'll take any lesson you can give me and thank you for it."</p>

<p>Followed by Captain Bonnett and his two visitors and with the
footmen pressing close behind, Lord Thralldom moved with slow and
shaking steps along a richly-carpeted passage to the picture
gallery of the castle.</p>

<p>The gallery was some distance away and was a long oblong
chamber, obtaining its natural light from above, and from long
windows, the whole length of one side. To all of these windows
there were stout steel bars, and the door was a heavy, closely-meshed, steel grille. There was a number of deeply-cushioned arm-chairs along the middle of the gallery with their backs turned
towards the windows.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom advanced to about half-way along the entire
length of the gallery, until he came to a large painting hanging
alone and separated by many feet from any other. A stout brass
rail waist-high, prevented a too near approach to this
painting.</p>

<p>He stretched out his arm. "'The Man of Sorrows'," he
exclaimed, with a deep note of challenge in his voice, "painted
by Peter Paul Rubens, year 1621."</p>

<p>Silas Hudson, supported by Kelly, limped forward and with a
swift backward glance over his shoulder at the light, took up a
position above half a dozen paces from the canvas, facing it
exactly in the middle.</p>

<p>A long minute's silence then ensued, everyone in the gallery
standing perfectly still, their eyes fastened intently upon
Hudson, while the latter stared at the painting.</p>

<p>The American stood as immovable as a rock, with the exception
of his eyes, which shut and opened several times. Then he sighed,
a deep, intense sigh that everyone there heard. Then he swallowed
hard and, at last, he spoke, but hardly louder than a whisper. It
seemed as though he were quite oblivious to the others standing
round him and were talking to himself.</p>

<p>"Wonderful! wonderful!" he ejaculated. He seemed to hardly
breathe. "The most beautiful thing on earth. Wonderful," he
repeated. "A miracle of colour and design! One of the greatest
masterpieces in the world of art!" His voice trailed away to
silence and, head bowed and hands clasped, his attitude was one
of awed reverence.</p>

<p>"And it is a forgery?" sneered Lord Thralldom who had endured
the American's silence with great impatience. "It is not the work
of Rubens you say?"</p>

<p>Hudson awoke from his reverie with a start. "No! no!" he
exclaimed passionately. "It is all Rubens and perhaps"&mdash;his
voice was harsh in its earnestness&mdash;"the greatest of all his
works!" and then, obviously with great reluctance, he withdrew
his eyes from the canvas and faced Lord Thralldom.</p>

<p>"My lord," he said humbly, now a very different person from
the arrogant picture dealer of a few minutes ago, "I owe you no
apology, for a sincere and honest man should never need to
apologise for anything he has said when he believed he was
speaking the truth, but"&mdash;he bowed most
respectfully&mdash;"I am most devoutly sorry that I wrote you
that letter. No,"&mdash;he corrected himself quickly, and with
something of his former spirit appearing to
return&mdash;"selfishly speaking, I am not sorry at all, for it
has been the means of enabling me to stand before one of the most
beautiful paintings I have ever seen."</p>

<p>He went on in sharp and businesslike tones&mdash;"It did not
take me that long time before I spoke to determine it was a
Rubens. It did not, indeed, take me five seconds to discern the
truth, for with my lifelong experience of the works of the great
masters, one glance only, was sufficient to convince me that no
other brush save that of Rubens has touched this canvas." He
bowed again. "I congratulate you, my lord, from the bottom of my
heart upon its possession."</p>

<p>The expression upon Lord Thralldom's face had been gradually
softening whilst the American was speaking, for the heart of no
collector could remain for long hardened against such unstinted
praise. His face now became suffused with pride and pleasure and,
indeed, he was so gratified with the abject capitulations of the
dealer, that the taunts and sneers he had prepared for him, died
still-born.</p>

<p>"And you don't want to examine the signature?" he asked with a
smile. "Surely, you have brought a magnifying glass with
you?"</p>

<p>Silas Hudson smiled back. "No need, my lord. That rich
colouring and bold design, that superb mastery of detail, and
that glorious portrayal of the fullness of life can only be
Rubens and Rubens alone." He nodded his head. "And I have had
some experience, you know."</p>

<p>"And you admire the painting then?" asked Lord Thraldom,
thirsting to hear, again and again, such words of praise.</p>

<p>"Admire it!" queried Hudson. "Why, I could spend days before
it and then not have absorbed one tenth of the beauty of its
detail. Three weeks ago, I viewed what I consider now may perhaps
be its companion picture 'The Descent from the Cross' in Antwerp
Cathedral and"&mdash;he nodded his head solemnly&mdash;"it lacks
something of the mastery of this."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom could hardly contain himself in his delight.
"And I have other paintings here that you may perhaps admire," he
exclaimed, rubbing his hands together, "if you would care to
inspect them."</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted, if I may," returned Hudson warmly, and
his eyes ranged quickly round the gallery. "Ah! a Botticelli, I
see; an Andrea del Sarto, a Titian, a Paul Veronese, a Rembrandt.
Good Heavens!" he exclaimed in astonishment. "What a priceless
collection! I had no idea you possessed all these."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom chuckled like a pleased child. "And there's a
Hogarth over there," he said, "a Gainsborough, a Constable, an M.
W. Turner and lots of others."</p>

<p>The American appeared most astonished and then, suddenly, his
expression altered. He frowned and looked apprehensively round.
He limped a few paces from Kelly, and close up to Lord Thralldom,
lowered his voice to an intense whisper.</p>

<p>"But, my lord," he breathed softly and with his eyes as round
as saucers, "do you realise that, in a lonely spot like this, you
are running a great risk in gathering together so many valuable
paintings?" He raised a warning finger. "Have you taken all
precautions against burglars?"</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom nodded, but at the same time looked rather
uneasy. "Every precaution," he replied. "It is quite impossible,
I think, for anyone to break in and, more impossible still, to
take my Rubens."</p>

<p>Silas Hudson seemed greatly relieved. "Well, that's good," he
said, "for, in the interests of Art, it would be a calamity if
any of your pictures were stolen."</p>

<p>"And you think I am wise," asked Lord Thralldom anxiously, "in
being prepared for any such attempt?"</p>

<p>"Sure," replied the American emphatically, "for if it's
generally known that you have got all these paintings here," he
nodded his head significantly&mdash;"you can bet your life the
castle is being watched."</p>

<p>"That's what I say," exclaimed Lord Thralldom excitedly, "and
yet all the others here think that I am alarming myself
unnecessarily. It is quite a bone of contention between us." He
became most friendly. "Sit down, Mr. Hudson. I'd like to have a
good chat with you." He raised his voice. "James, take Mr.
Hudson's man into the servants' hall and give him some
refreshment." He turned back to the American. "And you'll have
something, too, sir, presently, or perhaps you will do me the
favour of staying to lunch? No, it will be a great treat to me, I
assure you, for I don't often get someone I can talk paintings
to."</p>

<p>"It's very good of you and I shall be most pleased," replied
Hudson. "My time is quite free for I'm on holiday, as I told
you."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom turned to Captain Bonnett. "You needn't wait,
Marmaduke," he said dryly. "You can join the ladies. I know
you're wanting to. No, I shan't require anyone to remain. Mr.
Hudson and I shall be staying here until lunch-time," he smiled
at the American, "talking shop."</p>

<p>Captain Bonnett and the footmen at once left the gallery and
for two hours Lord Thralldom and the American enjoyed the benefit
of each other's society. The former was delighted with his
visitor, for the American was unstinting in his praise of all the
paintings, and was moreover, able to point out their merits with
the knowledge and experience of a man who had travelled all over
Europe in the pursuit of his calling.</p>

<p>Then at lunch, Silas Hudson gathered yet further laurels from
Lady Deering and Ann Devenham. The latter had at first been
minded to be very cool and distant, but the frank yet respectful
admiration with which he regarded her and the beneficial effect
that she could not help seeing he was exerting over her grand-uncle, very quickly disarmed her, and in the end, she was smiling
at him as much as was Lord Thralldom himself.</p>

<p>Hudson was a good talker and not only had he, as Captain
Bonnett had said, actually seen most of the great paintings of
the world, but he was able to describe his travels and adventures
in pursuit of them in a most interesting way, and grip the
attention of his hearers with everything he said.</p>

<p>Indeed, the only one at the meal who did not appear to be
enjoying the presence of their visitor to the full was Captain
Bonnett, and his annoyance sprang from two sources. He did not
like it that Hudson was so lavish with his compliments to Ann and
evidently meant them, and also he was really angry because the
American chaffed him so unmercifully about the unfinished copy of
the Turner upon the easel in the picture gallery.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" Hudson had exclaimed with a merry glance round at the
others, "but I can see, Captain, you're dangerous. If you go on
copying paintings like that, no one in the art world will be
safe. One day you'll make a copy of his lordship's Rubens here,
and then he'll wake up one morning and see two canvases and not
know which is which." And he had laughed so merrily at his wit
that Bonnett would have liked to have slapped his face.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Kelly was all eyes and ears in the servants'
hall and, never at any time averse from female society, was soon
enjoying himself quite a lot.</p>

<p>None of the maids was bad looking and indeed, two of them were
distinctly pretty, and all five of them did their best to make
their visitor feel at ease. Then too, the chef turned out to be a
most obliging man, and in addition to the really dainty meal that
he had provided for the staff, for Kelly's special benefit he
produced a most delicious sweet omelette.</p>

<p>The lunch in the dining-room over, it was the turn of James,
the under-footman, to be off duty, and in the men-servants'
special little room over a renewed supply of good sound ale, he
opened out and gave his guest quite a lot of information about
the castle and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Old Thralldom was a bit trying with his cranky ways, he told
the American's servant, but the wages were very good and the food
could not be better.</p>

<p>No, there wasn't much freedom for the staff, for everyone had
to be indoors by ten o'clock and then the castle was sealed up
like a tomb. There were locks and bolts and bars everywhere, as
if the place were a blooming prison, and they had to keep wicked-looking pistols&mdash;one of which was exhibited in proof of the
assertion&mdash;in case burglars should attempt to break in.</p>

<p>Old Thralldom thought of nothing but his pictures and he would
sit for hours and hours at a time staring at them, for all the
world as if they were a row of pretty girls.</p>

<p>Lady Deering was uppish but Ann was sweet. She was a deuced
pretty bit, but her uncle took darned good care that she should
not get a boy. She had recently, however, been stopping for a
week in Saxmundham and there were rumours that she had at last
met someone whom she liked. At any rate, she had had five dances
with a young chap in a bank there, at the Shire Ball. He, James,
had heard it, with his own ears from a gent, a friend of his, who
had been in charge of the cloakroom at the Assembly Hall upon the
night of the ball.</p>

<p>Ann was a wonderful musician, too, and once when she had been
playing upon the organ in the castle chapel, Bert Bevan, the
butler, who privately was a bit of a Bolshevist, had stated
openly that he felt inclined to sing a hymn or say his blooming
prayers.</p>

<p>Oh! Captain Bonnett! Well, they knew more about the captain
than he dreamed, for Bertha, one of the girls he, Mr. Kelly, had
just seen, had once been in service in a family in London when
Bonnett had been visiting there. The captain didn't remember her
but she remembered him right enough. He was a gay bird&mdash;a
darned gay bird, and he had been bankrupt twice and was always
hard up. He had been divorced from his wife and there were lots
of tales going about him; in fact his reputation was none too
good, but old Thralldom lived in a world of his own, and never
heard anything about anyone, and as Bonnett was some distant
connection of Lady Deering, he was allowed to visit the castle.
He thought he could paint but he, James, and the butler were in
complete agreement that he daubed on rotten stuff.</p>

<p>About the castle? Yes, half of it had been walled off and a
devilish good thing too, for horrible murders had been done in it
and ghosts walked at night. Yes, of course there were secret
passages all over the place and twice he had caught the chef
tapping the walls to try and find them. The chef was a poor
specimen of a man, but a darned good cook, and was always making
sweets for the girls.</p>

<p>For a solid two hours and more Kelly was entertained by the
loquacious and friendly footman, and then returning once again to
the kitchen, he topped down the four glasses of ale he had
imbibed with two cups of strong tea. By that time he had come
definitely to four conclusions.</p>

<p>The first&mdash;he would like to take Bertha, the under-parlourmaid out for a walk one evening and, preferably, he would
choose a night when there was no moon.</p>

<p>The second&mdash;although the elaborate system of locks and
bolts and bars that existed in the castle might be most perfect,
still, the human element behind it&mdash;he did not put it to
himself in quite that way&mdash;was weak and could be easily
dealt with.</p>

<p>The third&mdash;the panes of glass in the windows appeared to
be of an unusual size everywhere, and if they were cut, it would
be quite possible for a full sized man to pass through, without
in any way interfering with the window sashes to which the alarms
were fixed.</p>

<p>The fourth&mdash;he didn't like the dandy-looking chef, for
the chap was by no means the softy the other servants took him to
be. His eyes were everywhere and nothing escaped him.</p>

<p>A summons came for Kelly at last and he was called to assist
his master back into the car, and into such esteem had the latter
leapt, that a little group were assembled round the big entrance
door to bid him good-bye. Kelly noted, with distinct approval,
the aristocratic beauty of Ann Devenham.</p>

<p>"Mind you come again on Friday," said Lord Thralldom, "and
we'll have another long talk together."</p>

<p>"Sure, I will," replied the American heartily, "and I'll be
greatly pleased." He screwed up his face into a grimace. "But I
realise I made one great mistake, my lord. I thought this morning
that your Rubens was the most beautiful thing in the castle but
now"&mdash;and he made a gallant bow in the direction of Ann
Devenham&mdash;"I see I must modify that opinion."</p>

<p>"And perhaps you're right, sir," laughed back Lord Thralldom.
He made the pretence of nodding his head doubtfully. "But at any
rate, it's a close call."</p>

<p>The two drove away with Hudson at the wheel, and for two
hundred yards, at least, neither of them made any remark. Then
the American leant back in his seat and gave vent to a long,
intense chuckle of laughter.</p>

<p>"Gad!" he exclaimed delightedly, "but sure, I'm some actor. It
was a miracle the way I did it, and things couldn't be going
better."</p>

<p>"Oh! you pugged up the old fool, right enough," growled Kelly,
"but it was child's play. He's a darned fool about his
pictures."</p>

<p>"And I'm to go up on Friday again," chuckled Hudson, "and
you"&mdash;he could hardly speak for laughing&mdash;"are to go up
to-morrow and massage his niece."</p>

<p>"Massage!" snarled Kelly. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You've&mdash;got&mdash;to&mdash;give&mdash;her massage
for&mdash;her back," jerked out Hudson in an ecstasy of
merriment. "I&mdash;have
arranged&mdash;it&mdash;for&mdash;you."</p>

<p>He sobered down at the fury in the other's face. "It was like
this," he explained. "I told them you were my body-servant and my
masseur, didn't I? Well it came out after lunch that his niece
was suffering from lumbago and her doctor had said she must have
a course of massage. Then Lord Thralldom hopped in with the
suggestion that as there was no masseur, nearer than Norwich,
perhaps I'd oblige by lending you." His eyes twinkled again. "So
what could I do?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was damned foolery," exclaimed Kelly. "I don't know
anything about massage."</p>

<p>"But you soon will," replied Hudson quickly, "for between now
and to-morrow at eleven when you've got to go up to the castle,
I'll give you some lessons and you shall learn on Fenner. I know
something about it, for, two years ago, I had to have fifty
dollars' worth in Chicago." He was most enthusiastic. "Why, man!
It's a wonderful chance of spying out inside the castle, for
you're to go up every day for a fortnight, and it's quite the
luck of our lives."</p>

<p>"But I don't look like a man who gives massage, do I?" snarled
Kelly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," agreed Hudson with a covert smile, "but as she
says she's never had any massage before, she mayn't notice it."
He spoke sharply. "Now, no nonsense. You've got to massage that
female's back, and you'll have to wear rubber gloves to cover
those dreadful paws of yours. Oh!" he went on quickly, "I was
forgetting. Did you find out much to-day?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did," replied Kelly in a surly tone. "I'm not a
fool like that dandy Bonnett. I found out quite a lot." He jerked
his head. "The place'll be quite easy to get into, but I'll talk
about it when we're out of this rotten old car. The bumping makes
me sick."</p>

<p>A long silence followed and they drove on quite half a mile
before either of them spoke again. Then Kelly said meditatively,
"And the niece is that girl, Ann?"</p>

<p>"No," grinned Hudson, "it's her mother," and Kelly just
ejaculated "Ah!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE TASK OF LAROSE</h2>

<p class="first">"AND it is an entirely mistaken idea, as no one
will of course know better than yourself, Mr. Larose," said the
Chief Commissioner of Scotland Yard, "that crime, as we
understand it, finds its most fertile soil in great cities, and
where people are gathered together in large numbers." He shook
his head slowly. "The lonely places of the land, in proportion to
the dwellers there, have just as many dark and sinister secrets
to hide." He smiled sadly. "The little, sleepy village tucked
away in some quiet corner of the country-side, the almost
desolate coast about some lonely stretch of sea, or the moor that
shelters only some isolated shepherd's hut, may all hug, if we
only knew it, their secrets of dark and undiscovered crime."</p>

<p>Gilbert Larose nodded. He was a boyish-looking man, still
under thirty, and no one would have imagined, from a cursory
glance at his frank and open features, that he was a detective of
international reputation, and in his own country was responsible
for many an unmarked grave within the prison walls of the cities
of the great Commonwealth of Australia.</p>

<p>"Individual crimes, sir," he said respectfully, "particularly
those of violence are, I think, always more prone to occur where
people live much by themselves. They seem to become morbid then,
and brood over little things. I have often noticed that in the
lonely parts of Australia."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the Commissioner, "for they lose the right
perspective of things." He smiled. "Now, leading up from these
conclusions, I have a nice little problem to place before you.
No," he corrected himself quickly, "I am not sure whether it is a
problem at all but to determine it, one way or the other, is why
I have summoned you here."</p>

<p>He motioned Larose to bring his chair nearer, and unfolding a
large ordnance map, spread it out upon the desk before him.</p>

<p>"Now, this is a map of Suffolk," he went on, "and there is a
small corner here that just now is very interesting." He pointed
with his pencil. "It is this part adjacent to the coast that
embraces the towns of Saxmundham, Leiston and Yoxford, and the
little village of Westleton."</p>

<p>He leant back in his chair and regarded the detective very
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"To put it in a nutshell, Mr. Larose, within the last few
weeks, or to be exact, thirty-five days, four people in this
district, all unrelated to one another and of varying ages and
differing conditions of life have just walked out of their homes
and disappeared, and we are wondering"&mdash;he paused a
moment&mdash;"we are wondering if their several disappearances
are just merely coincidences, or if, on the other hand, they are
all linked up together by happenings of which we have no
knowledge and the significance of which we do not
understand."</p>

<p>"Very interesting," commented the detective, "and did all
these disappearances take place on different dates?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the Commissioner reaching for a paper that lay
upon the desk. "On the night of Sunday, August 13th, the manager
of one of the banks in Saxmundham and a school teacher from the
neighbouring town of Leiston, about three miles away,
disappeared. On the night of Tuesday, August 29th, an innkeeper
from Yoxford went, and on Friday, September 15th, just two weeks
ago, the bailiff of Lord Thralldom, of Thralldom Castle, walked
out into the night and has not been heard of since."</p>

<p>"They all disappeared at night, then?" commented Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, the bank manager, and the school teacher left their
respective homes just before 9.30, but the innkeeper and the
bailiff left later. The innkeeper just after ten and the bailiff
at a quarter to eleven."</p>

<p>"And were the bank manager and the school teacher acquainted
with one another?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>The Commissioner of Police laughed, and raised one hand in
mock reproof. "Ah! I knew you'd ask that. That was, of course,
the first thought that came into everybody's mind, and it must
have been a nice tit-bit of scandal for the two towns. Yes, they
were acquainted, and, added to that, the school teacher,
although, as I have said, a resident in Leiston, had an account
in the Saxmundham bank." He shook his head. "Yes, that made
people talk."</p>

<p>"And what is the general view then that people take of these
disappearances?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied the Commissioner, "that the two of them eloped,
of course; that the innkeeper went off with another woman,
unknown; and that the bailiff fell over the cliffs in the dark
and was drowned."</p>

<p>"Then what made the Suffolk police come to us?" asked Larose.
"There would seem to be no particular need unless they are in the
possession of more facts than you have outlined to me."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the Commissioner, "there are wheels within
wheels." He nodded his head. "It so happens that Mrs. Rawlings,
the wife of the missing bailiff, was at one time a cook in the
service of the present member of Parliament for the Borough of
Ipswich, and, dissatisfied with the efforts of the local police,
and angry, so she said, that they were taking no more interest in
her husband's disappearance than they had taken in the cases of
the others, she went to her one-time master for help. He is an
influential supporter of the Government and approached the Home
Office direct. They got in touch with me and upon my suggestion,
the Chief Constable of Suffolk then forwarded copies of the
police reports." He smiled. "That's how it is we come to be drawn
in."</p>

<p>"And the local police are not much impressed then? asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"No," smiled the Commissioner, "in fact they are inclined to
be very annoyed that we have been applied to, but the Chief
Constable of Suffolk is a particular friend of mine and, in the
course of some conversation over the phone yesterday, he
suggested jokingly that as we had got the celebrated Gilbert
Larose here, then he ought to be sent down." The Commissioner
shrugged his shoulders and laughed. "So, here am I, obliging a
friend."</p>

<p>"And what do you think of it yourself, sir?" asked the
detective, laughing back.</p>

<p>The smile immediately left the Commissioner's face, and he
hesitated some moments before replying. Then he said very slowly,
"Frankly, Mr. Larose, I do not know, for taking the reports
singly, the four disappearances seem trivial and of no importance
except to those intimately concerned." He spoke sharply. "Taken
singly, I say, but"&mdash;and he looked troubled&mdash;"taken all
four together, there are features about them that I do not like
and I am now wondering if that pretty little corner of
Suffolk"&mdash;he pointed to the outstretched map upon the
desk&mdash;"usually so given up to holiday-makers and happiness,
is not now choking under the grip of some unknown and bloody
assassin."</p>

<p>He picked up a bundle of papers lying before him and in a
quick movement handed them across to the detective.</p>

<p>"Here, take these," he said, "and go down into Suffolk, the
first thing to-morrow." He was smiling again now. "You will come
back looking rather foolish or else"&mdash;he nodded his head
grimly&mdash;"I shall expect you to be giving evidence, in the
near future, at the Ipswich Assizes."</p>

<p>For a long time then, when alone in his room that night,
Larose considered the reports that the Chief Commissioner had
handed over, but it was the photographs of the missing persons
that first engaged his attention. They were all of fairly recent
dates.</p>

<p>The school teacher was a plain-looking brunette of an
unattractive type. She had a grave, thoughtful face, with oval,
rather dreamy-looking, dark eyes.</p>

<p>The bank manager was a plain, matter-of-fact looking man, with
closely cut hair over a square forehead. He had a shrewd face,
and a chin that spoke of resolution and self-control.</p>

<p>The innkeeper looked jovial and merry. His face was round and
chubby and his lips were parted in a smile.</p>

<p>The bailiff's face was long and taciturn-looking. Its
expression was grave and he had the appearance of a man with no
imagination but with a strong sense of duty.</p>

<p>"Well, certainly this bailiff was no gay Don Juan," muttered
the detective, "nor the banker, either, I should say. The
innkeeper, however, would appreciate the good things of life, for
he looks a bit of a sport. As for the girl"&mdash;he
hesitated&mdash;"well, I can't think of anyone eloping with her
and certainly not a man of the type of the bank manager. Indeed,
I can hardly imagine either of them inspiring romance in
anyone."</p>

<p>He unfolded the reports. They had been drawn up by the local
constables, and amplified later by the enquiries of special
plain-clothes officers who had been sent down from Ipswich. He
carefully and methodically proceeded to pick out the main
facts.</p>

<p>Rita Ethelton, single, lived with her parents at Leiston. She
was twenty-seven years of age and had taught in the town for
upwards of three years. She was well-thought of by her superiors.
She was not keeping company with anyone. She was grave, studious,
and of a quiet disposition. Her only out-door recreation was
walking, and she often went for long walks by herself.</p>

<p>On the night of her disappearance, she had announced to her
parents that she would go out for some fresh air, and had left
her home about 9.30. No one in the town seemed to have noticed
her, and consequently it was not known in which direction she had
gone. It was a moonlight night, but clouds were threatening and
she had taken her macintosh with her. It was certain she was
carrying no money, for her bag with her purse in it had been left
behind in her bedroom.</p>

<p>She had not been missed until the next morning, for her
parents, accustomed to her roaming expeditions, had retired to
rest as usual at 10 o'clock, leaving the front door unlocked.</p>

<p>There were no circumstances that could suggest to them any
reason for their daughter going away. She was their only child,
she had no troubles that they were aware of, and was in perfect
health.</p>

<p>She was quite well-off for she had more than &pound;30 in the
Post Office Savings Bank, and &pound;200 on fixed deposit, in the
Saxmundham branch of the East Anglian bank.</p>

<p>The plain-clothes officer, sent down from Ipswich, was of the
opinion that if the going off were a premeditated one, then most
elaborate precautions had been taken to prevent it being
established as such.</p>

<p>Augustus Andrew Holden was forty-two years of age and had been
the manager of the East Anglian bank in Saxmundham, where he had
two assistants under him, for upwards of five years. He was
married and had three children, two boys, aged eight and eleven,
and a girl, six. He was apparently living on happy terms with his
wife, who was five years his junior. He resided over the bank
premises in the High Street, and there was a private entrance to
his house at the side.</p>

<p>He enjoyed a good reputation in the town and was respected by
everyone. He was a man of simple habits, golf being his only
recreation. He was invariably in good health.</p>

<p>He was in no financial trouble, and had a good balance at the
Ipswich branch of Lloyds bank. He had also &pound;1,200 invested
in Government securities.</p>

<p>He was regarded as a valuable and trusted servant of the head
office of his bank in Norwich.</p>

<p>On the night of his disappearance, he had been writing after
supper and then, just as Mrs. Holden was upon the point of going
to bed, he had remarked that he was suffering from a slight
headache, and would go for a brisk walk before turning in. He had
taken a cap and stick from the hall and let himself out of the
door, and that was the last that anyone had seen of him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holden, retiring to bed, had at once fallen into a sound
sleep, but awakening during the night and becoming aware that her
husband was not beside her, she had switched on the light and
found to her consternation that it was past three o'clock.</p>

<p>She had then immediately rung up the police station and,
getting speech with the officer on night duty there, had
explained what had happened and had insisted that a search should
be made at once. But as she could furnish no idea as to in which
direction her husband had gone, nothing, of course, had been
done.</p>

<p>Later, she had stated that she had no idea how much money Mr.
Holden had had upon him when he left the house, but it would not
have been much, she was sure, for it was never his habit to carry
more than a few shillings about with him at a time.</p>

<p>Samuel Baxter was 34 and had been the landlord of the Yoxford
Arms for just over three years. He was married to a woman about
his own age and there was one child of the marriage, a girl of
six. He was apparently quite happy in his married life.</p>

<p>The inn was a small and unpretentious one, but he did a good
trade and, keeping a good table, on market days had always as
many customers as he could accommodate. He was one of the local
bookmakers of the town and being of a happy, care-free
disposition, was liked by everyone.</p>

<p>The night of his disappearance, it had been noted by those
then present in the inn that he had closed the bar sharp to the
very second of ten o'clock. Indeed there had been remonstrance
upon the part of one customer that Baxter was turning them out
before the legal time.</p>

<p>Then next, one of the two serving maids, an elderly woman, had
heard him go into the back yard as she was getting into bed and
she had told the police that it could not have been later than
five minutes after ten.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter was out at the time, having gone to the talkies in
the town. She had, however, returned home a few minutes after
eleven and, not seeing her husband, she thought that he must have
gone out, as he sometimes did, to have a chat with some friend.
So she had gone to bed, and quickly falling asleep, had not
awakened until the maid had brought in a cup of tea just before
seven the next morning. Then she had been astonished to find that
her husband was not in the bed alongside of her.</p>

<p>No information was then forthcoming in any direction as to
what had happened to Baxter. He had visited none of his friends,
no one had seen him after he had closed the inn, and no traces of
any of his movements had been found anywhere.</p>

<p>It was remembered, however, by the Yoxford townspeople that
once before, about eighteen months previously, Baxter had been
missing for a week, and upon his return had given the information
that he had been called suddenly to London upon important
business.</p>

<p>Peter Rawlings was forty-five years of age and for twenty-two
of those years had been in the service of the present Lord
Thralldom. For the last nine he had been his bailiff and had had
entire charge of the farms and lands attached to the castle. He
resided at what was known as the Home Farm, and his house was
about a mile distant from the castle. The land belonging to Lord
Thralldom was roughly 3,000 acres, and comprised arable land,
pastures, plantations, marshes and a stretch of the sea-shore,
and as Lord Thralldom was old and an invalid, the bailiff had
plenty to look after and was a busy man.</p>

<p>Rawlings was married and his wife was five years older than he
was. They had no children and kept one maid, a young woman of
twenty. They were supposed by everyone to be a happy and
contented couple.</p>

<p>The bailiff had the reputation of being a quiet, sober, and
industrious man, and financially he was in good circumstances. He
had saved money. He lived a very uneventful life and had never
been known to take a holiday. He was most zealous in looking
after all his master's affairs, but his chief interest was
supposed to be in the herd of pure-bred jersey cattle that Lord
Thralldom possessed.</p>

<p>On the night of his disappearance, he and his wife had retired
to bed, as usual, about 9.30, but Rawlings had been very restless
and unable to get to sleep. Suddenly, just before eleven o-clock,
so his wife judged to be the time, he had jumped out of bed, and
huddling on some clothes, had muttered something about some
matter he ought to have seen to before going to bed. His wife had
been too sleepy to take much notice of what he had said, but she
had heard him pull on his boots and then go out through the back
door. Then she herself had been unable to get to sleep and
finally, beginning to wonder what her husband had gone out for,
and thinking that at any rate he had been gone long enough, she
had struck a match and found it was half-past twelve.</p>

<p>Then she had not gone to sleep at all and the hours going by
with no return of her husband, she had at first become frightened
and then hysterical. She had awakened the maid and the two women
had sat together, waiting for daylight to come.</p>

<p>And when it had come, they could find out nothing. Nothing had
been heard or seen of the bailiff since.</p>

<p>As to what he had been wearing when he had left the house, he
had been only partially dressed, for he had just put his trousers
and jacket over his pyjamas. There might have been a few odd
shillings in his pockets but certainly nothing more.</p>

<p>That concluded the four reports. There was a note added by the
Chief Constable of Suffolk that the investigations in all four
cases had been of a most exhaustive nature, but that in not any
one of them had anything been discovered to furnish a
satisfactory explanation for the disappearance.</p>

<p>Larose put down the reports with a frown. "Four very ordinary
persons," he remarked, "and it is difficult to conceive of any of
them leading a double life, still," and he shook his head slowly,
"you never can tell." He looked musingly out of the window. "No
one but our own selves can ever know the secrets of our own
hearts and, if we are honest, we must admit that moments have
come to us all when if we had followed our own inclinations, the
law of the jungle would have been the only law we should have
obeyed. We have thought things we have never dared to write down,
we have had longings we should never dare to express, and we
have"&mdash;he shook his head in annoyance&mdash;"but Gilbert,
Gilbert, I believe you're a very bad man. All people are not like
you."</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE SECRET OF THE MARSH</h2>

<p class="first">THE following morning just after ten, the
detective drove up in a small car to the house where Rita
Ethelton had lived in the little town of Leiston in Suffolk, just
over a hundred miles from London.</p>

<p>The girl's mother answered his ring, and learning he had come
from Scotland Yard, admitted him at once and led him into the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>"But what is the good of your coming?" she asked tearfully. "I
am sure now that she is dead."</p>

<p>"But you would wish to know what had happened to her," said
the detective gently, "and if, after all, it were an
accident?"</p>

<p>"Oh! it was no accident!" she exclaimed passionately. "Someone
killed her, and it's no good shirking the truth. I am sure of it
because there is no place within miles of here where an accident
could have occurred. I've gone over everything in my mind
thousands and thousands of times."</p>

<p>"Well," persisted the detective, "if anyone did her any
injury, you would like him punished for it, wouldn't you? No, no,
I'm not going over all the old ground again," he said quickly,
"but I just want to satisfy myself on one or two points."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think," said the woman with her face
darkening, "that my daughter went off with Mr. McHenry?"</p>

<p>"Not for a moment," replied Larose emphatically. "That's only
the idle gossip of these little towns, and I don't believe that
any people really believe it themselves." He took the chair that
she offered. "Now, Mrs. Ethelton," he went on in a sharp and
business-like tone, "the great difficulty that has presented
itself to everyone who has attempted to find out what happened to
your daughter that night, has been that they had not known where
to begin. They haven't had any idea in which direction your
daughter went when she started for that walk."</p>

<p>"No," admitted the woman sadly, "there are so many ways she
might have gone. There was no particular walk that I know of
which was her favourite one. She was fond of them all."</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Ethelton," said the detective, "please listen to
me very carefully and then perhaps we shall be able to pick up
what the others missed." He spoke very slowly. "Now there is
nothing that any of us do, in any moment of our lives, that is
not the result of some previous thought or act." He shook his
head. "We do nothing, as people call it, 'by chance.' Something
always decides what we must do. Something we have thought or said
or done, just before." His face brightened. "So let us put our
heads together and try to guess something of what were your
daughter's thoughts in the last minutes before she went out."</p>

<p>"I wish I could," sighed Mrs. Ethelton, "but Rita was always a
very reserved girl and no one ever knew what she was thinking
about."</p>

<p>"Well," went on Larose again, "in these dreadful weeks you
must, of course, have recalled many, many times, every trifling
little thing that happened that night."</p>

<p>"Everything," replied the woman, "over and over again."</p>

<p>"Then tell me exactly," said Larose, "what happened, say after
eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"I can't tell from eight o'clock," said Mrs. Ethelton, "for
Rita was in her own room until half past. She came in here then
to listen to the wireless. There was 'An hour with Chopin' on and
she had been waiting for it, because Chopin was her favourite
composer."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the detective, because she had stopped
speaking.</p>

<p>"Her father and I were reading, and she brought in a book
herself. Then, I don't think any of us said a word for the whole
hour until the music stopped. And then I remember Rita looking
out of the window for a few moments&mdash;the blind was
drawn&mdash;then she got up suddenly and said she was going for a
walk. Then she came over and kissed Dad and me."</p>

<p>"That was meant to be good night?" suggested Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, because Dad and I always go to bed directly the clock
strikes ten, and I suppose she was thinking she mightn't be back
before we had gone upstairs."</p>

<p>"And she went out of the room then," said the detective,
speaking very softly, "and that was all?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the woman equally softly and with a catch in
her voice, "that was all. We never saw her again."</p>

<p>"What book had she been reading?" asked Larose after a
pause.</p>

<p>"Sir Walter Scott's <i>Ivanhoe</i>," was the reply. "It was a
favourite book of hers and she had read it many times."</p>

<p>"And I understand," went on Larose, "from what you told the
others who have been here, that she changed her indoor shoes for
walking ones and went out in her mackintosh and a beret?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ethelton nodded. She could not speak.</p>

<p>The detective rose briskly to his feet. "And now, just one
more thing," he said. "I'd like to look over her room if I
may."</p>

<p>The woman's woe-begone expression changed instantly into a
frown and, for the moment, she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you may," she said rather reluctantly,
"although no one has asked to go in there before." She sighed.
"It's just as she left it, except, of course, that its been
dusted every day." Her voice choked. "I know she'll never return,
but I hope against hope that she will."</p>

<p>She led the way into a daintily furnished little room at the
back of the house and the detective stepped reverently over the
threshold. Then, for a long minute, he let his eyes roam all
round, over everything. He took in the small, narrow bed, with
the counterpane of sky blue, the bright curtains draping the
window, the pictures upon the walls, the tortoise-shell backed
brushes upon the dressing table, and the little simple ornaments
on the mantleshelf.</p>

<p>He looked thoughtfully at the pictures and apparently was
particularly interested in three large, framed photographs that
he saw. 'A Rough Sea at Aldeburgh' was printed under one,
'Dunwich Cliffs' under another, and 'Thralldom Castle in the
Moonlight,' under the third.</p>

<p>Then he looked at the titles of the books in a small
bookcase.</p>

<p>"So she was fond of poetry," he said gently. "Chaucer,
Swinburne, Tennyson and Sea Music, and she liked history and
novels of an historical kind. Now, where is that Ivanhoe she was
reading when the music was on?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ethelton indicated the book and Larose, picking it out
from among the others, opened it where a bookmarker had been left
in. Then, to the woman's astonishment he pulled a chair forward
and sitting down, proceeded carefully to scan through the opened
pages. It was quite a long time before he rose to his feet again
and replaced the book.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said quietly, "and now about that photograph,
'Thralldom Castle,' I see. How far is it from here?"</p>

<p>"About two miles and a half," replied Mrs. Ethelton, "or a
little longer if you go round by the sea."</p>

<p>"And she might have gone in that direction?" suggested
Larose.</p>

<p>The woman threw out her hands. "She might have gone anywhere,"
she exclaimed. "That is the dreadful part of it all."</p>

<p>The detective asked a few more questions and then, bidding her
good-bye, in less than twenty minutes was interviewing the bank
manager's wife in Saxmundham.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holden was still living in the bank house, as an act of
grace, he learnt afterwards, of the bank authorities who were
reluctant to accept as a fact that their trusted manager would
never return.</p>

<p>He found her a very different type of woman from Mrs.
Ethelton, and rather difficult to make any headway with. She
seemed to be resenting his coming, and every second to be waiting
for him to couple up her husband's name with that of the missing
school-teacher from Leiston. Her answers to his questions added
no further information to that he already had.</p>

<p>At his request, however, although certainly not without some
reluctance, she took him into her husband's little private room
and, under her watchful eyes, he proceeded to look round. He
noticed a large old-fashioned telescope bracketed upon the wall,
with the initials of "J.B.H." on its broad, brass end and at once
asked Mrs. Holden if it had belonged to her husband's father.</p>

<p>"No," replied Mrs. Holden, "to his grandfather, Captain John
Holden. My husband's ancestors were all sea-faring people," she
added, "and his own father was a captain in the P. &amp; 0.
Company. My husband, too, would have gone to sea, if it had not
been for his eyes. He was very short-sighted as a young man, and
it was a great disappointment that they wouldn't pass him."</p>

<p>"Where was Mr. Holden born?" asked the detective
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"At Tynemouth," she replied. "The Holdens are a very old
Tynemouth family."</p>

<p>"And you have not the very faintest idea in which direction
your husband started for his walk, upon that night?" asked
Larose, following upon some further questioning.</p>

<p>"Not the very faintest," was the reply. "My husband was always
fond of walking, and knowing every road in the country for miles
round, he may have gone anywhere."</p>

<p>The detective next went into the bank and obtained a brief
interview with the clerk who had been the second in command under
Mr. Holden's managership. He was a good-looking young fellow,
John Harden by name, with a clear-cut profile and frank, open,
blue eyes. He was quite polite but very firm in his assertion
that he could not help the detective in any way.</p>

<p>"And if you want to put it to me," he said warmly, "that there
is the slightest truth in the rumour that there was anything on
between that girl in Leiston and Mr. Holden, then I'll tell you
straight, it's a lie. Mr. Holden was not that type of man and
Miss Ethelton simply did her banking here, in preference to her
own town because"&mdash;he looked very disdainful&mdash;"in these
little country places everyone likes to poke their noses into
other people's business and I suppose, naturally, she did not
want hers known."</p>

<p>Larose visited the local police station and made a few
enquiries in the town but, the disappearance of the bank-manager
being now five weeks old, almost all the interest seemed to have
died down and he got nothing for his pains.</p>

<p>But one thing struck him as peculiar. All that morning, not
one single person he approached made any reference at all, either
to the disappearance of the inn-keeper at Yoxford or to that of
the bailiff of Lord Thralldom. Indeed, it seemed that they had
not heard about them.</p>

<p>The afternoon found him in the pretty little town of Yoxford,
and calling at the Yoxford Arms, he came upon Mrs. Baxter in the
bar, which happened to be empty at the time.</p>

<p>She was a handsome woman of a rather florid type but her eyes,
he thought, were rather hard. Directly she learnt who he was, to
his surprise, she gave him an annoyed and frowning look.</p>

<p>"I'm sick of you police," she said bluntly, "and I don't know
what you want by coming bothering me any more. I've told
everything I know, and all of you round here are an incompetent
lot. You've found out nothing and I don't want to have anything
more to do with you."</p>

<p>"But, Mrs. Baxter," exclaimed the detective, very astonished,
"surely you want to know what has become of your husband?"</p>

<p>"All in good time," snapped the woman, "and when I do know,
I'm sure from your methods, that it won't come through any of
<i>you</i>." She tossed her head angrily. "So, I'm not going to
answer any more questions, and if you want to know anything, you
can just go off to the police station here." She sniffed
contemptuously. "They've got all my answers written down."</p>

<p>The detective eyed her very sternly. "But you'll have to give
me an answer to every question that I put," he replied sharply.
"I've come down expressly from London and I want, too, to look
over the inn."</p>

<p>"Want to look over the inn!" gasped the woman in great
astonishment. "Why, do you think Sam's in hiding here?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied Larose in matter-of-fact, business-like tones, "but I've come all the way down from Scotland Yard
and I have to make a full report." He spoke most politely. "I'd
like to go over the place straightaway, please."</p>

<p>The woman hesitated and looked as if she were going to refuse
but then, shrugging her shoulders in contempt, she called for one
of the maids to attend to the bar in her absence and led the way
into the living parts of the inn.</p>

<p>The detective looked into every room, and noted from the guns
and fishing tackle upon the walls in one of them that Sam
Baxter's activities ran in more than one direction of sport. He
asked Mrs. Baxter several questions, but she replied in curt
monosyllables whenever possible, or else made her answers snappy
and short.</p>

<p>In their common bedroom he came upon a large framed photograph
of a group of cricketers, and approaching it closely, he
recognised the round, smiling face of the innkeeper amongst
them.</p>

<p>"Alfreton Cricket Club, August, 1923," he read.</p>

<p>He made no comment but out again in the hall, asked suddenly,
"And for what reason, in your opinion, did your husband go into
the back-yard that night? Can you think of anything he might have
been wanting there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lots of things," replied Mrs. Baxter flippantly. "Pigs,
dogs, cats, fowls or even ducks down by the ponds."</p>

<p>She smiled coldly. "He was always wanting one thing or
another."</p>

<p>Larose gave her up at last and proceeding to the police
station in the town, the sergeant-in-charge there showed him in
neat handwriting, upon many pages of foolscap, all the
information that had been gathered together and the detective
went through it carefully.</p>

<p>"And why," he asked presently, "was Mrs. Baxter so
antagonistic towards me? She was as uncommunicative and
unpleasant as possible."</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir," replied the sergeant, shaking his head.
"She's only been like that lately. I think she's been upset by so
many outsiders pestering her with questions. Not that I've ever
quite understood her," he added thoughtfully, "for she's been a
bit queer all the time. At first, as you have read, she never
said a word about Baxter's disappearance to anyone, and for a few
days everybody was told he was away on business. Then she came
here crying and said she was sure someone had murdered him and
then, this last week, she's shut up like an oyster, and been rude
to everyone."</p>

<p>"What reason did she give for thinking he'd been murdered?"
asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No reason at all," smiled the sergeant. "Just a woman's
intuition, she said." He shook his head. "But we didn't think
much of it, for Baxter had gone off for a week once before." He
smiled again. "Sam is a good publican and when he does go on the
booze, he boozes away from home."</p>

<p>"But his wife is keeping back something now," said Larose
sharply, "and there must be some reason for her not wanting the
enquiry to go on. It wasn't mere annoyance that made her so
evasive with me just now. She was fencing the whole time." He
looked intently at the sergeant. "Was she supposed to be fond of
her husband?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, and she was!" was the reply. "She was very proud of
him, too, for he was a popular chap. She bossed him about and
kept him in order, but she was fond of him right enough, and only
as late as yesterday, I saw her with her eyes heavy and swollen
from crying."</p>

<p>"Anything known about him before he came here?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"Nothing much," replied the sergeant. "The references he had
to put in when he applied for the transfer of the licence of this
inn both came from London, where he'd been a barman for three
years."</p>

<p>"Anything known about him before that?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>The sergeant shook his head. "No, I never heard tell where
he'd lived before."</p>

<p>"Well, ring up a place called Alfreton," said the detective
sharply, "and get me the police station there. Baxter was in the
Alfreton Cricket Club in 1923, and we're sure to learn something
from them. Be quick please, because I'm in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Alfreton's in Nottinghamshire," said the sergeant, "and it
may take a bit of a while to get through."</p>

<p>However, in less than ten minutes Larose was speaking to the
Alfreton police, and was soon in possession of some interesting
information about the missing inn-keeper.</p>

<p>Yes, they remembered Sam Baxter quite well. He had kept the
'Wheatsheaf' public-house there six years ago, but the licence
had been taken away from him because he had been sentenced to two
months' imprisonment for poaching. He had been known to be an
inveterate poacher for a long time, but he had been very artful
and they had not been able to catch him. No, beyond that there
had been nothing against him. He had been a good fellow and very
popular in the town. He had married a London girl, Sally
Matters.</p>

<p>Larose hung up the receiver and passed the information to the
sergeant. "Now," he asked, "was Baxter given to poaching
here?"</p>

<p>The sergeant frowned. "Not that I know of," he replied, "for
he would of course have lost his licence here, as well, if he'd
been caught." He reflected. "He might have been, for when I come
to think of it, he kept a very good table at his inn, and either
rabbit pie or jugged hare were often on the bill of fare. Not
that he'd have had to poach for the rabbits though, for there'd
have always been plenty of farmers who'd have given him a day's
rabbiting whenever he wanted it, but hares"&mdash;and the
sergeant shook his head&mdash;"hares are a different matter, for
they belong to the gentry and the big landowners."</p>

<p>"But he kept dogs that would have coursed hares," said Larose.
"I saw a greyhound in the yard just now."</p>

<p>"It's not a pure greyhound," remarked the sergeant. "It's a
bit of a mongrel, but still it would run down hares right
enough."</p>

<p>"And if he wanted to get a hare," asked Larose, "where would
he go for it?"</p>

<p>"Sefton Park, or on the meadows adjoining Thralldom marshes,"
was the prompt reply. "There are plenty of hares in both those
places. But it'd have been a bit risky taking a dog near
Thralldom Castle just now for, of late, there have been a number
of them poisoned there. Someone has been laying down strychnine
baits."</p>

<p>"Who's laid them down?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>The sergeant laughed grimly. "That's what we'd like to know.
The Thralldom people say they know nothing about it." He looked
very stem. "It's against the law, you know."</p>

<p>The detective asked a few more questions and then left, to
make his last enquiries, at the home of Lord Thralldom's
bailiff.</p>

<p>After a couple of miles or so, he arrived at the top of a
hill. A wide view of the surrounding country spread itself before
his admiring eyes and, almost involuntarily, he drew up to the
side of the road, and switching off his engine, sat silent and
enthralled, to drink in the beauty of the scene.</p>

<p>Only about five miles distant from the sea, between the hill
and the glistening waters, rolled a wide and slightly undulating
plain, dotted here and there with farm buildings and little
groups of cottages, and with a narrow river winding in and out
among the pasture lands.</p>

<p>But it was Thralldom Castle that dominated everything, and its
majesty and beauty gripped him with delight.</p>

<p>It stood alone, in a wide clearing of its own, and like some
great over-lord of the country-side, its massive heights were a
landmark in every direction.</p>

<p>"What a glorious old pile!" he ejaculated, "and what a view
one would get from those battlements!" He sighed. "We have
nothing like that in Australia and never shall have. Those days
are gone."</p>

<p>He soon found the bailiff's home, and directly she knew from
where he came, was welcomed thankfully by Mrs. Rawlings. She took
him into what was obviously the best room, but the carpet there
was folded up and all the pictures and furniture stacked in one
corner.</p>

<p>"I'm moving," she explained with a choke in her voice, "and
the new bailiff is coming in to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But it's very sudden, isn't it," queried Larose, "with your
husband&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Only gone a fortnight to-morrow," supplemented the woman
quickly. "And it's very unkind of his lordship, and I don't
understand it, for"&mdash;her voice broke again&mdash;"we can't
be certain yet that my husband is dead." She wiped away a tear.
"It's so unsympathetic."</p>

<p>"Is Lord Thralldom a hard man then?" asked the detective.</p>

<p>"No, usually not at all so," was the quick reply. "He spoke
very kindly to me when I went up to the castle last week, but
since then he's got to hear that I went to my old master, Colonel
Edis, who's a member of parliament, and he's very angry about it.
He told me not to go to the police for they couldn't get me back
my husband if he'd walked over the cliffs and got drowned which,
he was sure, had happened, and he said any publicity would
attract attention to the Castle and then people would come and
rob him of his pictures." She began to cry. "Of course he's very
old and ill, and can think of nothing but his pictures now." She
clasped her hands together. "Oh! do you think, sir, that my poor
husband is really dead?"</p>

<p>"Sit down and tell me all that happened," said Larose
soothingly, "and then, we'll see what we can find out."</p>

<p>For upwards of an hour the detective questioned her, but at
the end of that time he had reluctantly to admit to himself that,
once again, he had added little to the knowledge he already
possessed.</p>

<p>"You see, Mrs. Rawlings," he said at last, "if you could only
give me some idea where your husband was going that night, then
we should be able to start our search in some definite
direction."</p>

<p>"But as I say, I can't tell you," she replied tearfully. "My
husband never talked to me about any of the business of the
estate. He was a very reserved man and spoke very little at any
time and he had the idea, too, that all a woman's interests
should be in the home. But he was a devoted husband to me and all
our married life we have been very happy together. He never,
however, brought his business worries to me at any time."</p>

<p>The detective thought for a moment. "And you don't know, then,
what particular work your husband had been doing during the day
previous to the night when he disappeared?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rawlings shook her head. "No, he was busy the whole day,"
she replied, "and I only saw him at meals, and then he was
writing all the evening."</p>

<p>"He kept a diary?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>The woman's face brightened. "Oh! yes, and I believe he put
down the minutest things that happened."</p>

<p>"Show me the diary, then," said the detective, and she at once
led him into another room and began looking among a number of
books and ledgers piled upon the table.</p>

<p>"Here it is," she said and Larose pulled up a chair, and
sitting down, began turning over the leaves of the book she had
handed to him. The scrutiny, however, was very short before he
spoke to her again.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" he asked, pointing to an entry under
the date of Saturday, September 16th. The entry consisted of two
words only, "Queen Guinivere," upon an otherwise entirely blank
page.</p>

<p>The woman smiled a wan smile. "We have a herd of Jersey
cattle," she replied, "and Queen Guinivere is one of the cows.
She was due to have her calf on that day. She is the matron of
the whole herd and a valuable animal. She has taken lots of
prizes."</p>

<p>"And did she have her calf on that date?" asked the detective.
"Remember, it would be the day after your husband
disappeared."</p>

<p>"Oh! no," replied Mrs. Rawlings, "not until the day before
yesterday. Look, you can see them, if you want to. They are both
in the meadow there."</p>

<p>Larose walked over to the window. "And do you think it is
likely," he asked, "that your husband went out that night to see
if she was all right?"</p>

<p>For a few moments, the woman stood silent. "It might be," she
replied, speaking very slowly. "Yes, it might be, for I know he
was rather anxious about her. She's getting old and nearly died
with her last calf." She bit her lip in vexation. "I never
thought of that."</p>

<p>"And where would she have been that night?" asked the
detective, "if he had gone to her."</p>

<p>"In the same meadow where she is now," replied Mrs. Rawlings,
"somewhere between here and the castle. The Home meadow, we call
it."</p>

<p>"Now, another thing," went on Larose. "Poison baits are said
to have been laid about here. Do you know anything about
that."</p>

<p>"They've been laid," she replied slowly, "because several dogs
have died and now no one dares to keep one on the estate." She
shook her head. "But no one knows who lays them and it's been a
mystery to everyone for some time. It's very queer."</p>

<p>The detective made no comment. "And you have a lot of hares
here, I understand," he said after a moment. "Now whereabouts
would you find them?"</p>

<p>"Oh! all round," she replied. "They come to feed in the clover
fields at night."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then Larose got up to bid her
good-bye. "I shan't be far away," he said, "for I'm going to stop
for a few days at that inn, there by the beach. Oh! I was
forgetting," he exclaimed. "Where will you be if I want to ask
you any more questions?"</p>

<p>Her face brightened. "At Westleton," she replied, "and it's
only a mile from here. Lord Thralldom has been very kind about
that and has given me a cottage and two pounds a week for as long
as I live."</p>

<p>"Well, that's good," nodded Larose. "Good-bye," he said
smilingly, "I'm sure to be seeing you again soon."</p>

<p>But the smile dropped from his face directly he was
outside.</p>

<p>That night, as upon every night when he was engaged upon a
case, Larose went very carefully over everything that had
happened during the day and with a map of Suffolk spread out
before him, began talking softly to himself.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll sort out all my cards," he said, "and just see
what sort of a hand I have. Now what does it all mean?" He spoke
very solemnly. "Within the space of a few short weeks these four
persons, all residing within a few miles of one another and all
in happy and comfortable circumstances have all disappeared off
the face of the earth, and I ask myself, from what I have learnt
to-day, am I dealing with four separate happenings, having no
connection or relation to one another, or am I faced with one
main problem, of which each of these four disappearances form
only a part?"</p>

<p>He punctuated every word slowly with his hand. "Is it
reasonable to suppose that the same unaccountable urge came to
each of these four persons&mdash;to break all in an instant from
the peaceful and settled order of their lives, to forsake kith
and kin, father, mother, wife and children with no word or
message of regret and no goodbye? To leave those who loved them,
to be night and day, and day and night, torturing their brains as
to what calamity could possibly have overtaken them?"</p>

<p>He shook his head emphatically. "No, no, I can rule that out
at once. Upon the face of it, I can be sure the disappearances of
all these people were not voluntary. They were forced upon them.
Something happened to keep them from returning to their homes and
that something"&mdash;he spoke in a whisper that was almost
inaudible&mdash;"can surely only mean that they are dead."</p>

<p>He paused for a long time here before going on. "Yes, that is
the only way I must account for their silence, for their silence
can only be the silence of the grave." His tone became much more
brisk. "Well, what happened? Did they then all meet with some
such accident that their bodies as a natural consequence have
been hidden ever since from the gaze of human eyes?" He shook his
head again. "No, impossible. The coincidences would be too
strained. They were killed somehow. Yes, they were killed and the
fact that no traces of any one of them have been found, suggests
that they all came to their deaths in the same manner and by the
striking of the same hand."</p>

<p>He paused again as if to check up his thoughts. "Then, if that
were so, surely the killer did not seek them all out individually
in the vicinity of their own homes. He was not waiting at Leiston
for the school-teacher, at Saxmundham for the bank-manager, at
Yoxford for the innkeeper and here at Thralldom for the bailiff.
No, no, they came to him, and it was upon some single, common
meeting-ground that they encountered him and passed into
eternity. Each of them upon the night when they disappeared, by
chance, came within reach of that uplifted arm, and it remains
for me to find out when they set out upon their journeys; where
their paths eventually converged; and at which particular place
they all met with their mysterious ends." He was quite convinced.
"Yes, I am dealing with one main problem, and the four
disappearances are part of a whole."</p>

<p>He considered for a moment. "So, I'll try and put myself in
the minds of some of those people upon the nights when they
disappeared, and see where their thoughts will lead me if, in my
subsequent actions, there be anything in common with them at
all."</p>

<p>He settled himself back in his chair. "First, I am that
school-teacher, and I am twenty-seven, and well among the years
when, if any lover were coming to me, he should have come by now.
But I am plain and uninteresting-looking and no man has arrived
to give me those mad moments for which I crave. Oh, yes, I want
them. I want them badly, for I am very romantic. I love all the
beauty in life. I love the sea, I love flowers and I love
scenery. I love poetry, too, of the romantic kind." He nodded; "I
could see how often that Tennyson of hers had been opened at
'Idylls of the King.' In effect, I am a girl who must be finding
my unfulfilled womanhood very hard.</p>

<p>"Well, that night I am sitting with my parents and there is no
conversation. I am reading, but the soft, sensuous music of the
divine Chopin is filtering through into my brain. I am reading
Ivanhoe and I have just come to that part,"&mdash;he
frowned&mdash;"now what were those lines in particular that
caught my eye when I opened the book? Ah! I remember&mdash;'they
hurl the defenders from the battlements, they throw them into the
moat'."</p>

<p>He shook his head and sighed. "But I close the book there and,
for a little while sit thinking. Then what are my thoughts?
Surely I am thinking of gay ladies and gallant knights, of
battle-axes and shining armour, of a mighty castle with high
towers and towering battlements, and&mdash;Thralldom Castle at
once leaps up before my eyes."</p>

<p>His own eyes sparkled. "Of course it would, for all my life I
have known Thralldom Castle, and night and morning in that large
photograph its grim walls have been always under my gaze. So the
castle in Ivanhoe becomes real to me and I picture it as
Thralldom is, and see them hurling defenders over battlements
that are familiar to me, and into a moat that I know quite
well."</p>

<p>"Then I look out of the window and see the moon is shining."
The detective made a muttered aside here. "There was some moon
shining on each of the nights when those poor souls disappeared."
He went on. "So all on the instant, I make up my mind to take a
walk and then, what is more natural than that, with these
thoughts in my mind, I should turn my steps in the direction of
Thralldom Castle?" He paused for a long moment. "Surely I should
have gone that way."</p>

<p>He leant back in his chair and sighed. "Guess-work, Gilbert,
just guesswork and nothing more," he nodded his head grimly, "but
for all that you may not be very far astray."</p>

<p>His voice took on a sharp and business-like tone. "Now, for
disappearance number two, and I am the bank manager in
Saxmundham. It is after supper and I have a headache. I have been
writing all the evening and am not unnaturally tired. I think I
will go for a walk. It will do me good and clear the cobwebs from
my brain. Well, where shall I go? It is just a walk that I want,
and therefore, I suppose all directions will be the same to me.
Ah! but will they? I was born by the sea and all my boyhood's
recollections are associated with the shore, the sands, the waves
and the breezes of the sea. My father was a sailor and his father
before him and his father before that. So, I have the very salt
of the sea in my blood, and what is more natural then than that I
should turn to the sea when I am feeling tired&mdash;as a tired
child turns to his mother in any distress? Yes, I'd take my walk
in the direction of the sea."</p>

<p>He looked down at the map before him and went on. "And if I
take my walk towards the sea, by where will it lead me?" He spoke
very slowly and deliberately now. "I shall pass Thralldom
Castle"&mdash;his voice trailed away to nothing&mdash;"Thralldom
Castle again!"</p>

<p>There was a long pause and then he shook his head. "A guess in
the dark, Gilbert, just a guess and yet"&mdash;he
nodded&mdash;"for all that, you may be dead on the spot
again."</p>

<p>He smiled. "Now, for disappearance number three, and I am Sam
Baxter, a merry-hearted publican and I shut up my bar sharper
than usual to-night. Punctual to the tick of ten, for I have
something to do and I am in a hurry to get on with it. I put on
my cap and let myself out into the yard."</p>

<p>He screwed up his eyes and looked very puzzled. "Now what do I
go into the yard for? What could I be wanting there at that time
of night? I have gone there to get something and I am afterwards
going for a walk or upon an expedition of some kind for I have
taken my cap from the hall. Well, what am I wanting from the
yard? There is no car, nor horse there. Nothing but sheds, with
fowls, ducks, pigs and a dog. Ah! a dog."</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on. "Yes, I was a poacher six years ago, an
inveterate poacher, so the Alfreton police said, and I suppose
once a poacher, always a poacher. So perhaps, I am going out
poaching to-night, and I have gone into the yard to get the dog.
Well then, if I am going poaching, what am I going poaching for?
Not rabbits&mdash;the sergeant ruled that out&mdash;and certainly
not partridges or pheasants, for they are out of season, and
could not be put on the public table, and again, I should not be
wanting a dog to get them. Then, I must be thinking about hares,
and that means that I am going either to Sefton Park or
Thralldom. Sefton Park or Thralldom," he repeated slowly, "and I
shall most probably choose Thralldom because it is a moonlight
night, and my inn is on the Thralldom side of the town, and so by
going in that direction there will be less chance of anyone
seeing me with my dog."</p>

<p>The detective nodded. "And that brings me to Thralldom
again&mdash;always Thralldom." He looked very grave. "It may be
that I am only guessing again, but now the startling fact is
emerging from my guesses that by deductions that are perfectly
reasonable, and by no undue stretching of the imagination, I am
leading each of these three persons, the school-teacher, from
Leiston, the bank-manager from Saxmundham and the inn-keeper from
Yoxford, all to the very spot where we know for certain that the
bailiff himself disappeared. Yes, Thralldom lures them all to
their destruction; Rita Ethelton, because she is thinking of the
castle by moonlight; Augustus Andrew Holden because he and his
forebears have been all born by the sea, and Samuel Baxter
because it is there he must go poaching for his hares."</p>

<p>He nodded his head again. "Yes, and if anyone had deliberately
planned a common meeting place for these three, where they would
have to travel the least distances from their several homes, he
would have chosen Thralldom, for Thralldom is the centre of that
circle from the circumference of which they would have all
started upon their journeys."</p>

<p>He went on. "So, I come finally to the case of Rawlings, and,
in a way, his last movements present the smallest difficulty of
all, for if I cannot with certainty say he was going to visit
that much-prized matron of the Jersey herd, I can at least assume
from his half-dressed condition that he was not going far away
from his home." He pursed up his lips. "But I can be pretty
certain he was going after that cow in the meadow there, for if
he considered the matter that was worrying him after he had
retired to rest, to be of such urgency that he felt compelled to
get out of his bed almost in the middle of the night, then it
undoubtedly suggests that he was going to attend to some living
creature, and the fact that he took no lantern with him indicates
that he was content with the light of the moon for whatever he
had to do"&mdash;he nodded for the third time&mdash;"which brings
in the meadow where the cow was again."</p>

<p>He leant back once more. "And if these four poor creatures
have met with some untimely and violent form of death, who but a
madman could have inflicted it upon them, for what reason other
than the sheer lust of blood could have urged him upon his path
of murder? It could not have been for money that they were
killed, for they practically carried none, and it could not have
been for any feelings of personal animosity, for they all came
from widely separated places and there was nothing that one can
conceive, except pure chance, that could have brought them one
after another, within reach of the wretch who assassinated
them."</p>

<p>He rose up from his chair and began taking off his
clothes.</p>

<p>"Yes, Gilbert," he said, "to-morrow, it's a madman you've got
to start looking for, and you'll have all your work cut out to
find him. You have, however, two things in your favour. You know
the exact date when this nice gentleman first started
business"&mdash;his eyes glinted&mdash;"and you know the place
about where he takes his walks at night." He fished his pyjamas
out of his portmanteau. "So, to-morrow after supper you'll go out
to try and meet him and say 'how-do-you-do.' You can be very nice
and polite and all that, but I think first you had better shoot
him in the legs."</p>

<p>And he put out the light and composed himself placidly to
sleep.</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE HALESWORTH BUTCHER</h2>

<p class="first">THE next morning Larose was early abroad and
driving into the adjoining village of Westleton, proceeded to
interview the village policeman.</p>

<p>Police Constable Plummer was fat and comfortable-looking and
from his general appearance might easily, with no make-up at all,
have just stepped off the stage from taking part in some old-time
blood and thunder melodrama.</p>

<p>He was heavy and ponderous in manner, with a big and rather
stupid face and very round blue eyes, but it was evident that he
regarded with becoming gravity the responsibilities of his
position as village constable, and so answerable to the Crown for
all the crimes and misdemeanors of the one hundred and fifty and
more souls under his charge.</p>

<p>His uniform fitted him closely, and although the weather was
far from being warm, he perspired freely. He lived in a small
house and seemed himself to fill the greater part of the little
room in which he interviewed the detective.</p>

<p>He was duly impressed when he learnt who his visitor was, and
regarded him stolidly, breathing hard.</p>

<p>Without disclosing in any way what his mission was, Larose
began at once to enquire about the people in the district.</p>

<p>"Now," he said briskly, "what I want to know, Constable, is
this. Is there anyone in this neighbourhood who has the
reputation of not being quite right; who is eccentric in his
ways, amongst other things, is known to be in the habit of
roaming about alone, late at night?"</p>

<p>The policeman looked very solemn for a moment and then
suddenly a gleam of intelligence stirred in his face. "Yes," he
nodded, "I know the man you want," and the detective's heart gave
a bound at the apparently so easy termination of his quest.</p>

<p>"The Reverend Finch answers to all these descriptions," went
on the policeman. "His mind is failing and he mutters a lot to
himself. He will preach for longer than an hour on Sundays until
the people begin to walk out, and sometimes he is missing from
the Rectory for hours at night."</p>

<p>The face of the detective fell. A clergyman did not seem very
promising, but still&mdash;still, he thought, one never can
tell.</p>

<p>"He goes out at night!" he ejaculated. "For how long is he
away?"</p>

<p>"A couple of hours and more," replied the policeman, "and
quite half a dozen times lately, I've been fetched by Miss Finch
at one and two in the morning to go and look for him."</p>

<p>"And where does he go to?" asked Larose quickly. "Do you
know?"</p>

<p>"Oh! not very far," was the reply. "Never more than two or
three hundred yards. He's ninety-three next birthday and not too
steady on his pins."</p>

<p>The detective muttered a bad word, but his face betrayed no
sign of his disappointment.</p>

<p>"Anyone else?" he asked.</p>

<p>The policeman thought hard. "Young Pidgeon," he said, "but
you'd hardly call him a man. He's fifteen and mazed on fishing.
He'd sit all night on Minsmere Jetty if his mother would let him,
and his father often has to bicycle over and fetch him home."</p>

<p>The detective realised there was evidently going to be no corn
in this mill, so he rose to his feet. "Well, Constable," he
asked, "which doctor has the largest practice in this
neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Steven, of Halesworth," was the reply. "He's my doctor
and if it's for rheumatism&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How far is Halesworth from here?" interrupted the
detective.</p>

<p>"About eight miles," said the policeman. His eyes brightened.
"But if you want to see Dr. Steven you can catch him in the
village now." He pointed through the window. "There's his car
just outside old Mrs. Rumbleton's. He's attending her for
lumbago, but her sister died of cancer a couple of years or so
back and everyone believes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Larose bade him a quick good morning and hurrying out into
the street, was just in time to catch the doctor as the latter
was getting into his car.</p>

<p>"Can I speak to you for one minute, please, Dr. Steven?" he
asked and the doctor, after one hard scrutiny of his
interrogator, nodded a quick assent. The doctor was a keen,
intelligent-looking man in the middle fifties, cleanshaven, with
a good chin and a pair of very shrewd grey eyes. He looked
exactly what he was, a busy country doctor, sharp and
businesslike and with no time to waste.</p>

<p>Larose told him who he was and showed him his badge. "I am
very sorry to trouble you, Doctor," he said, "but you may be able
to do me a great service. I need not mention," he added, "that I
am speaking to you in the strictest confidence."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," nodded the doctor frowningly, "that is
understood."</p>

<p>"I am down here on a special mission," went on Larose, "and,
in a sentence, I am looking for a man of deranged mind with
homicidal tendencies. Now, do you happen to know of anyone about
here who answers to that description?"</p>

<p>The doctor regarded Larose with a grim smile. "If I did," he
replied, "I should get him put away at once, for I am a
magistrate as well as a doctor." He shook his head. "No, I know
of no one like that."</p>

<p>"You have been practising here for some time?" asked the
detective.</p>

<p>"Thirty years," was the reply, with a deep sigh. "Thirty out
of my fifty-four."</p>

<p>"Then you know everyone in the neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>"Nearly everyone. Two thirds of those under thirty I have
brought into the world and for half of them"&mdash;another deep
sigh&mdash;"I have not yet been paid."</p>

<p>"And you can think of no one," went on the detective, "who,
although outwardly normal in appearance, may yet be the man I
want?"</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head again. "No, I can think of no
one."</p>

<p>"Are there any drug-addicts about?" was Larose's next
question.</p>

<p>"A few," was the reply, "but quite harmless."</p>

<p>"Well, are there any private asylums in the neighbourhood, or
any doctors who have charge of private lunatics?"</p>

<p>"There is a private asylum at Beccles, about eighteen miles
away, and a practitioner in Framlingham has two certified cases
under his care." Dr. Steven smiled. "But these latter are both
old ladies, so I am afraid there will be nothing to interest you
there."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then Larose asked. "Well one more
question. Doctor, and then I am afraid I shall have finished.
Now, is there anyone at present living in the neighbourhood who,
to your knowledge, has at one time been in an asylum for the
insane."</p>

<p>Instantly then, the doctor's face hardened and looking very
sternly at the detective, he replied quickly&mdash;"Now there,
sir, you are asking a question I am not prepared to answer. I say
neither yes nor no to that for there are some things a medical
man may not divulge."</p>

<p>A great exultation thrilled through the detective's heart. Was
he upon the trail at last?</p>

<p>"But, Doctor," he went on impressively, "what I am asking you
may be a matter of life or death, and if you refuse to tell me,
you may be condemning yet another poor soul to a ghastly and
bloody end."</p>

<p>The doctor opened his eyes wide in astonishment. "Then has
some murder been already committed in this neighbourhood?" he
asked sharply. "I have heard of none."</p>

<p>Larose picked his words very carefully. "That for the moment,
sir, is impossible to answer with any certainty, but I assure you
there are strong suspicions that more than one has been already
done." He spoke very solemnly. "We are looking for a man whose
mental condition is such that he might be a murderer, and it is
only by lighting upon such an individual and setting a watch upon
him, that we can determine whether or not he has already taken
life, not once, but several times."</p>

<p>The doctor looked very puzzled. "I would help you if I could,"
he said slowly, "but to put it bluntly I don't feel justified in
exposing to your attentions anyone whom I, as a medical man,
consider to be perfectly harmless."</p>

<p>"But, Doctor," persisted Larose eagerly, "it is exactly a man
whom everyone considers as perfectly harmless that I am looking
for. A man who by day is perhaps just an ordinary respectable
member of the community, but who, by night, is a maniac and
prowling about the country, as dangerous to all he meets as the
angel of death. He may have bouts of mania, too, that only come
on at intervals, and in his sane moments may be quite ignorant of
all he does at other times." He spoke very sternly. "I am not
appealing to you as an officer of the forces of law and order
only, but in the name of a humanity common to us all."</p>

<p>A troubled expression came over the doctor's face. "You are
quite eloquent, sir," he said, "and almost I feel
inclined&mdash;&mdash;No, no, I'll not tell you." He smiled
pleasantly. "But at any rate I'll give you some good advice
although you need not mention to anyone that it was I who gave it
to you." He started his engine and let in the dutch. "Go and see
Inspector Ferguson, in Halesworth. He may be able to help you
when I can't." And away he drove with a friendly wave of his
hand.</p>

<p>"Good!" remarked the detective as he climbed into his own car.
"Now, my instinct tells me I'm going to get something out of
this." His face fell. "But I hope they don't put me on to anyone
who lives in Halesworth, for Halesworth is a good nine miles from
Thralldom."</p>

<p>Inspector Ferguson, of Halesworth, proved to be a smart,
intelligent officer and there was no hesitation about his answer
when after due formalities of introduction had been effected,
Larose put to him the question.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, regarding his visitor interestedly, "I do know
of a man living here who, at one time, has been confined to a
lunatic asylum. The information, however, came to me quite by
accident and not in my official capacity, and I believe only one
other person in the town is aware of the fact. The man is
Ridgeway Turnbull and he is a butcher here."</p>

<p>The detective suppressed the excitement that he felt. "Well,
tell me everything you know about him," he said sharply.</p>

<p>Inspector Ferguson had been well trained and, in the presence
of one of the reputation of Larose, asked no preliminary
questions, but proceeded at once and with no appearance of
curiosity, to impart all the knowledge he possessed.</p>

<p>"It happens I am well acquainted with him," he said, "for I
come from Saxmundham, near here, and we were boys together.
Ridgeway Turnbull is forty-five years of age and was born in the
village of Westleton, eight miles from here. His father was a
labourer in the employ of the then Lord Thralldom, the uncle of
the present one, and Ridgeway, as a boy, worked on the Thralldom
lands too. He was a wild youth and gave his parents a lot of
trouble. At seventeen he ran away and went to sea and we heard
nothing of him for six or seven years. Then he came home on a
visit, with a girl whom he married. He had given up the sea and
was working for a butcher in London. Then we lost sight of him
for about ten years until he came to this town, and obtained
employment as an assistant to one of the butchers here. He is
prosperous now and a well-to-do man. He is a widower, having lost
his wife the year before last. He has no children."</p>

<p>Larose listened with an intense thrill to the Inspector's
recital. Here might be the very man he wanted. One who had an
intimate acquaintance with the Thralldom lands and whose
occupation would have hardened him to the shedding of blood, and
tended to make him callous to the suffering he was
inflicting.</p>

<p>"And when was he in an asylum?" he asked.</p>

<p>The Inspector hesitated. "I cannot tell you that with any
certainty," he replied, "but it was not long before he came here,
which would make it about thirteen or fourteen years ago. He was
in an asylum for more than two years and the information reached
me in a very curious manner. I play bowls, and so does he, and
four years ago I won the trophy and he was the runner-up. I sent
a copy of the local paper with all the details in about the
match, to an uncle of mine who is also interested in the game,
and in acknowledging the receipt of the paper, my uncle asked who
the R. Turnbull was, because, he said, a butcher's assistant in
Forest Gate, of that name, and with that initial, had once been
put into an asylum after attempting to cut his wife's throat, and
the description he gave coincided exactly with the appearance of
Turnbull here."</p>

<p>"And who else knows about it in this town?" asked Larose. "You
said a second person had heard about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dr. Steven here," replied the Inspector. "Turnbull's
wife told him about it, once when the doctor was called in after
one of her husband's heavy drinking bouts. I had taken Ridgeway
home that night and heard her telling him."</p>

<p>"Then he drinks!" said the detective.</p>

<p>"Yes, he breaks out every few months and we've had to gaol him
several times. He's been up before the magistrates twice this
year."</p>

<p>"What's he like to look at?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"He passed you just as you were getting out of your car to
come in here," was the reply. "I was standing at the window and
saw you both in the same glance. He's a tall, gaunt man, with a
big nose and a rather distinguished-looking face." The Inspector
smiled for the first time and lowered his voice to a whisper. "In
fact there's a little bit of scandal about his father's
parentage, for his father was supposed to be an illegitimate son
of the Lord Thralldom of that time, and there may be something in
it, for Ridge is not unlike the present lord."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" ejaculated Larose. "Do you really think it's
true?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the Inspector judicially, "his grandmother was a
maid once up at the castle and she left hurriedly
and&mdash;Ridge's father was born. At any rate, she had an
allowance from some source she would never disclose, and when
Ridge gets drunk he boasts he is a cousin of the present Lord
Thralldom."</p>

<p>The detective smiled. "And does Lord Thralldom know about it?"
he asked.</p>

<p>The Inspector looked amused. "You bet he does," he replied,
"for I heard Ridge tell him so once openly to his face. Lord
Thralldom was presiding on the bench that day, and Ridge was up
as usual for being drunk, and when his lordship gave him ten days
without the option of a fine. Ridge shouted out that if a priest
had only mumbled a few words over his grandmother, he'd have been
the Lord Thralldom now, instead of only a blanky butcher selling
chops and steaks."</p>

<p>They both enjoyed a good laugh, and then Larose asked. "And
what about the man's mental condition now? Does he show any signs
of not being in his right mind?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the inspector, "he seems quite all right to
me."</p>

<p>"And except for getting drunk then," went on the detective,
"you have nothing against him?"</p>

<p>"No, he's quite a good member of the community and very good
company."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then Larose asked sharply, "Does
he go out by himself at night on a bicycle or in a car?"</p>

<p>The Inspector looked embarrassed and almost as if he had been
found out in some misdemeanour himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, he does," he frowned, "in his car, and I've caught him
twice lately coming home without any lights."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" exclaimed the detective, "and when was that?"</p>

<p>The Inspector considered. "I can't tell you exactly," he
replied, "but the last time was about midnight, three weeks ago.
No, it's no good. I'm sorry I can't give you the exact date."</p>

<p>"Well, does he often go out at night in his car?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>The Inspector hesitated. "I really can't tell you that either,
although we live almost opposite to one another. It's like this.
His shop and my house are both about half-way up this hill
running through the town, and if he wants to go out on the quiet
after dark, he can just push his car out on to the road, and then
free-wheel down and not start his engine until he's out of
hearing. Then, he can return home by another way and come into
the road at the top of the hill this time, so that by shutting
off the engine again, he can just glide down into the yard
without a sound."</p>

<p>"What does he go out at night after, do you know?"</p>

<p>The Inspector raised his eyebrows. "Oh! after some woman, I
suppose, and if he's of Thralldom descent that would be the
natural thing, for they've always been a gay lot," he nodded his
head, "and half mad too."</p>

<p>"Is he bitter against the present Lord Thralldom?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"Very," was the reply, "for his lordship always makes it hot
for him if Ridge comes up when he's on the bench, and when Ridge
is drunk he talks a lot about having his revenge."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then the detective remarked:
"Well, Inspector, I've no doubt you are wondering why I'm
interested in the man."</p>

<p>"Naturally," smiled the Inspector, and he bowed, "for we don't
often get anyone of your reputation coining down into these
parts."</p>

<p>"It's about that bailiff of Lord Thralldom's I've come," said
Larose. "We are not satisfied up at the Yard with the
explanation, or rather the want of explanation, relating to his
disappearance."</p>

<p>"And I should think not," said the Inspector decisively, "for
it's most mysterious." He looked sharply at Larose. "What about
those other disappearances? Have you heard of them?"</p>

<p>The detective nodded. "Yes, and I don't like the look of them
either."</p>

<p>Inspector Ferguson frowned. "I knew that Mr. Holden, of
Saxmundham, well, and he was a good fellow. I met him one evening
only the week before he disappeared. He was going down to have a
bathe at Minsmere Haven, and he was making a short cut across
Lord Thralldom's land."</p>

<p>Larose pricked up his ears. "Oh! now tell me exactly where you
met him?"</p>

<p>"Just by the Thralldom marshes," replied the Inspector, "and
close near a little plantation of larches where the ground begins
to rise. About 300 yards from the ruins of the old Priory. He was
trespassing of course." He smiled. "But we all trespass when we
go near Thralldom Castle. It ought to belong to the nation, and
public opinion is dead against all the notice boards that his
lordship has put everywhere. People do no harm in crossing over
his meadows."</p>

<p>"Well," said Larose sharply, "I'm looking for a madman who
prowls round Thralldom at night and who attacks anyone he comes
across. That's the only theory I can form to account for all
these disappearances, and if I am right, I am pretty sure, for
reasons that would take too long to tell you now, that they have
all occurred near Thralldom Castle itself."</p>

<p>The Inspector whistled. "What an idea!" he exclaimed. "I'd
have never dreamed of such a thing." He thought for a moment.
"But what about the bodies? No traces of any bodies have been
found."</p>

<p>"All in good time," nodded the detective. He spoke sharply.
"Now about this Turnbull here. I want to go over his house. How
can I manage it?"</p>

<p>"A search warrant!" suggested the Inspector.</p>

<p>"No, no, the last thing in the world," exclaimed Larose. "I
must go over it without anyone knowing. Not a soul must know I'm
interested in the man. Now how can it be arranged?"</p>

<p>The Inspector snapped his fingers together. "You couldn't have
come at a better time. It's early closing to-day and Turnbull is
playing bowls this afternoon. There'll only be his housekeeper in
the house, and she will be going out to visit her sister who's in
hospital with a bad leg. All you've got to do is to come over to
my place, wait until the coast is clear, and get into the house
through the back door. I don't suppose for a moment that it will
be locked." He laughed. "Turnbull's a careless man, and besides,
we are all supposed to be honest people about here." He shook his
head. "But of course this is going to be done unofficially. I
must know nothing about it."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," agreed Larose. He rose to his feet. "And
now I'll go and have a close-up view of this descendant of the
Thralldom's. I suppose he'll be in his shop."</p>

<p>"Most probably," replied the Inspector. "He was going that
way."</p>

<p>Larose parked his car behind the police station and proceeding
to the butcher's shop, walked in and for want of something
cheaper, ordered a pound of chops. He recognised Turnbull
instantly from the description the Inspector had given him. The
man was alone in his shop.</p>

<p>The butcher had a proud and not unhandsome face. His eyes were
big and fierce under bushy eyebrows and he had a high forehead
and a large mouth, with very tightly-closed lips. He was clean
shaven, his appearance being not unlike that of a priest. He gave
his customer a hard scrutiny as he came in.</p>

<p>"Nice weather," said Larose, and the butcher looked up from
cutting the chops and nodded. "Yes, very nice," he replied.</p>

<p>"We could do with some rain though," went on Larose, and the
butcher looked up and nodded again.</p>

<p>"How far is it to Thralldom Castle?" asked the detective next,
and this time the butcher did not look up as he replied
quietly,</p>

<p>"About six miles, I should say."</p>

<p>Larose left the shop in two minds. In one, he was disappointed
that the butcher looked so normal and matter-of-fact, and in the
other, he was elated that the man had not stated correctly the
distance to the castle.</p>

<p>"Of course he would know," ran his exultant thoughts, "but he
mis-stated it deliberately because he wanted to make out he took
no particular interest in anything about Thralldom. He evidently
noticed me, a stranger to the town, going into the police
station, and is prepared to be careful about anyone whom he knows
has been speaking to the police." He smiled to himself.
"Therefore he has something to hide, and things look quite
hopeful."</p>

<p>He had lunch at the Inspector's home, and then watched behind
the curtain of one of the front rooms for the butcher to go
out.</p>

<p>"The bowling green is only just up the road," the Inspector
informed him, "so Turnbull won't be taking his car."</p>

<p>Just after two, the butcher, dressed in a smart navy-blue
suit, came out and proceeded up the road, to be followed half an
hour later by an elderly woman in a mackintosh, carrying a bunch
of flowers.</p>

<p>"And that means," said the Inspector, "that she won't be away
long. She's not dressed herself up as she usually does, and has
only just slipped the mackintosh over her ordinary clothes. Now,
off you go, Mr. Larose, and if you find the back door locked,
which is not very likely, you are sure to find one of the windows
unlatched."</p>

<p>Waiting until the woman was well up the road, Larose strolled
across and slipped into the butcher's yard. The back door was not
fastened and he was soon inside the house.</p>

<p>There were four rooms at the back of the shop and he at once
picked out the two that belonged to the butcher. They were not
over clean and very untidy. He soon finished with the bedroom,
but in the other room there was more to interest him. It was
evidently used partly as an office and partly as a sitting-room
and in one corner there was a big desk with three good-sized
drawers down upon each side.</p>

<p>"Now, what am I looking for?" he asked himself as he rapidly
surveyed the contents of the room. He made a grimace. "I really
don't know."</p>

<p>There were a number of books upon a long shelf and they were
all piled anyhow, with no regard to shapes or sizes, one upon the
top of another; novels with highly coloured jackets, books on
history and travel, Gibbon's <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire</i>, Carlyle's <i>French Revolution</i>, books on popular
science and a ten year's old edition of <i>Burke's
Peerage</i>.</p>

<p>"Not an uneducated man by any means," commented the detective,
"and that class of criminal is always the more dangerous." He
picked up the Burke's Peerage and it opened, as if of its own
accord, at the Barony of Thralldom. "So, so," he smiled, "then
our friend is evidently seriously of opinion that he comes of the
Thralldom stock."</p>

<p>He turned to the desk and began pulling out the drawers. They
were crammed untidily with bills, receipts and stock reports.
Five of them he glanced through hurriedly and then, coming to the
sixth, he found that it was locked.</p>

<p>"Ah! now what's in this?" he remarked, and he took a small
bunch of keys out of his pocket and, one by one, tried to fit
them into the lock. But they were none of them of any use, so
after one quick glance round to see if there were anything more
of interest in the room, he ran out into the yard to the garage.
The garage door was pulled to but not fastened in any way, and as
he slid it open, wide enough to pass in, a clucking fowl darted
through his legs into the yard. He searched quickly for a pair of
pliers and a piece of stout wire.</p>

<p>"Waste of time, probably," he muttered, as when back in the
sitting-room again he was kneeling before the locked drawer, "but
it's curious that only this one drawer of the six should be
locked."</p>

<p>The lock was a common one and he had soon dealt with it to
expose to view, as in the other drawers, a mass of untidy papers
pushed in anyhow.</p>

<p>"Still," he nodded, "there was probably purpose in the man's
mind when he locked this drawer, and as a matter of routine, I'd
like to know what that purpose was," and he thrust his hand down
among the papers to feel round at the sides and bottom of the
drawer.</p>

<p>Instantly then the expression on his face became more intent
and he drew out a small, flat packet from under all the papers
and at the very back of the drawer. Its covering was just
ordinary newspaper folded several times, and dirty with traces of
oil upon it. Unfolding it quickly, he was staring at the number
plates of a car, with the inscription on them "AN-17151."</p>

<p>The figures had been evidently home-painted for they were
straggling and uneven and slovenly. They were well splattered
over with dried mud.</p>

<p>"Now, that's funny," he remarked, and after a few moments'
thought, he laid them upon the floor and ran into the garage
again. There were two cars there. A meat delivery one and a Ford
tourer. Their number plates were RF-2709 and RF-8421
respectively.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he whistled, "then those are false number plates he is
hiding in that drawer." He bent down and examined the fastenings
of the plates. "And it's the tourer that he uses them upon."</p>

<p>He spent five minutes in the garage and then returning into
the house, replaced the number plates where he had found them,
and left everything as before. He next proceeded to the police
station and informed the Inspector of his discoveries.</p>

<p>"And the piece of newspaper they are wrapped in is a sheet
from the <i>Ipswich Guardian</i>," he said, "and it is dated
August the 5th. That would be eight days before Mrs. Holden and
the school-teacher disappeared. From the look of the paper, the
plates have been wrapped and unwrapped many times since it was
first brought into use, for it fits them now almost like a case,
and folds of its own accord into their shape. The plates are
muddied, too, which shows that when he has been using them he has
been driving the car off the bitumen and in by-lanes."</p>

<p>"It looks fishy," commented the Inspector, "very. He's up to
something right enough."</p>

<p>"And it's the tourer he's been using them on," continued
Larose, "for the nuts of the plates on the delivery van are well
rusted whereas those of the tourer have been oiled recently and
unscrew easily, which explains the oily finger-marks on the
paper. There's another thing, too, that wants some explanation. I
lifted the piece of carpet upon the floor of the back of the
car,"&mdash;he looked impressively at the inspector&mdash;"and
saw unmistakable stains of blood upon the floor-boards
there."</p>

<p>The Inspector shook his head. "But I shouldn't bank much on
that," he said, "for two or three times lately his van has broken
down, and the meat has been delivered in the tourer."</p>

<p>"No matter," said Larose, rather disappointedly, "at any rate
we've got enough to go on to make it desirable&mdash;if not in my
interests in yours&mdash;to set a watch upon him and find out
what he's after."</p>

<p>"Certainly," agreed the Inspector, "but he's a sharp man, and
will be difficult to trail."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Larose, "for up to a certain point the more insane
a man is, the more cunning he is." He took a map of Suffolk out
of his pocket and spread it out upon the desk. "Now, we'll take
it for granted that he's not finished with those false number-plates of his, but will go on using them for the same purpose
he's been employing them up to now, and we must trail him to find
out what that purpose is. Well, of course, it's no good our
trying to start following him anywhere near the town. We must
pick him up when he's a good distance from here, so that he will
have no idea anyone is interested in his movements and that being
so, if he is going to Thralldom, when is it likely he will first
turn off from the main road?"</p>

<p>"At one of those by-roads there," pointed the Inspector,
"after he's got on to the Norwich-London road. About half a mile
this side of Darsham, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Well, you have a man ready at Darsham, with a bicycle say
every night for the next week, starting with to-night. Let him be
waiting where you can phone him and you keep watch this end and
ring up if Turnbull leaves his house. If he does leave, it should
not be later than ten o'clock and when there's a moon shining.
Ten to eleven is the critical time when all these people have
disappeared, also, the maniac I have in my imagination never
works in complete darkness. Then, if your chap gets a ring, he
can bicycle up this way and meet Turnbull, and he'll be a poor
fellow if he doesn't find out which way Turnbull goes. Myself,
I'll be on the look-out on the Thralldom lands every night, and I
ought to hear his car if he comes anywhere near." He held out his
hand to the Inspector. "But now I think I'll be getting back, for
I want to take a walk round the castle lands before it gets dark.
I am staying at the inn on Minsmere Haven and let me have a ring
at once if the butcher starts out to-night. I'll wait at home on
the chance."</p>

<p>When the butcher came home for his tea that evening, his
housekeeper met him with some very disquieting news. "I found
that white hen shut out of the garage when I got back," she said.
"I was rather late because I had met some friends at the
hospital, and all her eggs were stone cold. Someone must have
been to the garage and let her out, when I was away."</p>

<p>Her master was in the act of taking off his coat, but at her
words he stopped, with one arm out, and opened his mouth very
wide. Then he went into the garage, and for a long while stood
staring thoughtfully round.</p>

<p>"What's happening?" he whispered at last. "A man with a London
registration plate on his car, goes into the police-station and
then comes round to me for a pound of chops. He stares at me so
hard that he forgets to pick up his change. Then someone comes in
and lets the fowl out of the garage when we are both away." He
frowned, "Yes, what's up?"</p>

<p>The detective had bad luck that afternoon, for he was delayed
at Yoxford with a broken spring, and in consequence did not get
back to Minsmere in time to make a survey of the land round the
castle as he had told the Inspector he was intending to do,
before dark.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; THE TRAIL OF BLOOD</h2>

<p class="first">THE following morning Larose, leaving his car in
the garage of the inn, went for a three hours' tramp, circling
round Thralldom Castle in every direction, but never going much
farther than a mile away from it. Once, he approached to within a
few hundred yards, and only desisted from a very close
inspection, because of the many warning notices he saw displayed
everywhere, that trespassers would be prosecuted.</p>

<p>"A most exclusive old gentleman," was his comment upon the
lord of the castle, "and perhaps it is a good thing that his line
is dying out. Surely a castle like this should belong to the
nation and not to any particular individual."</p>

<p>Still, he had a pair of good binoculars with him and taking up
a comfortable position against a fence, he sat back and, for a
long time, took in the beautiful proportions of the castle. The
longer he regarded it, the more he was inclined to appreciate its
loveliness. "Yet, upon what violence, what cruelties and what
bloodiness has it looked down," he murmured, "and who dare say it
is not now looking down upon more bloodiness, still?"</p>

<p>He returned to the inn in good time for the midday meal, and
proceeding first into the bar for a glass of ale, found a couple
of fishermen likewise intent upon refreshing themselves. He
nodded good-day to them and then, taking his tankard with him,
moved off to a long wooden form by the window, leaving the
fishermen to continue their conversation with the landlord.</p>

<p>Presently the door of the bar was pushed open and a fourth
customer appeared. He was a tall, thin man with a meditative,
gloomy face, but upon every stitch of his attire was written
'holiday-maker.' Thick woollen stockings covered his lanky legs,
and he wore baggy trousers and a short jacket. A big tweed
golfing cap was pulled down low upon his forehead and he carried
a thick, hefty-looking walking stick.</p>

<p>He was standing at the counter of the bar with his back turned
toward the detective when Larose first happened to catch sight of
him.</p>

<p>The latter thoughtfully regarded the lanky figure for a few
moments and then frowned in a puzzled way, for some chord of
memory had subconsciously been stirred in him.</p>

<p>The man received his tankard and turning round, walked up to
the bench where Larose was, and seated himself at the other end.
In the act of sitting down he nodded a casual good-day, following
it up at once, however, with a slow and solemn wink.</p>

<p>"Naughton Jones!" gasped Larose. "The greatest private
detective of the age! The cleverest and yet the most conceited
worker in the trade! Now what on earth is he doing down here, got
up like that?"</p>

<p>But it was evidently not the desire of the great Jones that he
should be spoken to, for he now turned his face away and puffed
steadily at a big pipe.</p>

<p>"Dinner is ready, sir," called out the landlord a minute or
two later, and Larose, rising leisurely to his feet, proceeded to
pass out of the bar. When, however, he was just level with
Naughton Jones, he stooped, and bending down to adjust a
bootlace, at once received a communication as he had expected he
would.</p>

<p>"I'll be outside in half an hour," came from the half-closed
lips of Naughton Jones. "Follow me, at a distance. It's
important."</p>

<p>And so, accordingly, half an hour later, Larose was following
in the wake of the lanky holiday-maker who walked about a hundred
yards in advance.</p>

<p>Jones led the way round a corner of the cliffs and when they
had gone about a quarter of a mile and had lost sight of the inn,
he sat down upon the beach and beckoned to the detective to come
up to him.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mr. Larose," he said with a dry smile. "I'm pleased
to meet you again. I had my eye on you the day before
yesterday."</p>

<p>"Oh! you had, had you?" exclaimed Larose, looking rather taken
aback.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Jones carelessly. "I saw you pull up at Mrs.
Rawlings'. I was in the small plantation near there, watching the
house." He laughed slily. "I thought there was just the chance
that Gilbert Larose would be turning up, for it has been shouted
all round the country that she had applied to Scotland Yard." He
looked hard at the detective. "You've been sent down on a special
mission, have you?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded. "Yes," he replied quietly. "I've come down to
try and find out what happened to the bailiff."</p>

<p>"And I'd like to know too," commented Jones dryly. "I'd like
very much to have a little talk with that gentleman."</p>

<p>"So you're interested too, are you?" said Larose. He spoke as
if with great respect. "May I ask how it happened you have come
down?"</p>

<p>"You may ask," replied Jones curtly. He appeared to consider
for a moment and then added, "And I see no reason why I should
not tell you. In fact," and he smiled quite genially now, "I have
been thinking that you might, perhaps, be of some help to me. I
don't forget you proved very useful when we were hounding down
the racketeers of Ephraim Smith."</p>

<p>Larose suppressed a smile. "I always try to do my best, Mr.
Jones," he replied, "but of course I have not had your
experience."</p>

<p>"No," commented Jones grandly, "for you're younger than I am
and experience can only come with age." He went on a quick crisp
tone. "Now, I'll tell you what I am down here for. I am acting on
behalf of a Mrs. Baxter, whose husband kept the Oxford Arms, four
miles away." He looked sharply at Larose. "You have heard,
perhaps, that he disappeared three weeks ago?"</p>

<p>The detective drew in a deep breath, and it was with a great
effort only that he managed to suppress an exclamation of
surprise. He composed his features, however, to a calm and casual
expression.</p>

<p>"Yes," he nodded, "I heard that he could not be found." He put
up one hand to cover a yawn. "Do you know anything about
him?"</p>

<p>"Only that he's dead," snapped Jones. "Murdered on these
meadows here and within a mile of where we are sitting now."</p>

<p>This time Larose made no effort to suppress his surprise.
"Dead!" he exclaimed incredulously. "Murdered! Good God! Are you
sure?"</p>

<p>"Well, I found his cap," replied Jones, smiling grimly at the
consternation in the detective's face, "and it had been full of
blood. It had a great slit in it and sticking to the edges of the
slit were scalp, brain tissue and sandy-coloured hairs. Baxter's
hair was sandy and he had undoubtedly been killed with a chopper,
or an axe of some kind."</p>

<p>Accustomed as he was, by his life's work, to horrors of all
kinds, the detective nevertheless experienced a feeling of nausea
at the words so glibly spoken, and he swallowed hard, several
times.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it, will you," he said after a few seconds.</p>

<p>Naughton Jones settled himself comfortably back upon the
beach. "Well, I'll begin from when I first took up the case. I
had&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment, please," interrupted Larose. "Does his wife
know?"</p>

<p>A cloud passed over the face of the great investigator. "No,"
he admitted reluctantly. "I have not thought it wise to inform
her yet." His expression brightened a little. "In fact I am
waiting by express purpose, for I am hoping to present both heads
upon the same charger, her husband's and that of his
assassin."</p>

<p>Larose made no comment, and after an impressive pause, Jones
went on. "Eight days ago, I had a call from this Mrs. Baxter to
find her husband for her, but I should not have thought of taking
up the case, for I am very busy, had she not reminded me that
last year I was instrumental in getting a cousin of hers five
years for burglary, and she seemed to think that gave her a
certain claim on me. So, upon consideration, I complied with her
request."</p>

<p>He looked very stern. "I told her, however, straightaway, to
have no further dealings with the official police, and on no
account to mention to anyone that I was investigating the matter.
If she did, I warned her, I should return to London immediately.
I also enjoined her that if any of the police called again, she
was to refuse to answer any of their questions."</p>

<p>Larose frowned and seemed upon the point of making some sharp
comment, but he thought better of it, and with a half smile
turned away his eyes.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Jones in sonorous tones, and as if he were a
schoolmaster addressing a class, "when I take up a case I always
insist upon no half confidences. I demand entire confidence from
the party calling me in, and with Mrs. Baxter it was particularly
fortunate that I did so, for I learnt at once that she had let
four days pass before informing anyone that her husband was
missing, and I at once wanted to know the reason why. She was
reluctant to tell me at first, but at length I dragged from her
that he was given to poaching, and had indeed once served a term
of imprisonment for that offence and it was her belief that he
was out again upon such an expedition the night he
disappeared."</p>

<p>Naughton Jones paused a few moments to rekindle his pipe and
then went on.</p>

<p>"You must understand, of course, Mr. Larose, that poaching is
a serious offence with anyone in Great Britain, but doubly so in
the case of a publican, for to hold a license of a hotel or
public-house in this country a man must be of exemplary character
and with no history of any bad conduct against him. So we can
quite understand why Mrs. Baxter had not dared to broadcast her
suspicions at the time, even though they might materially have
helped the authorities in their investigations. She was hoping,
too, on the other hand, that her husband might possibly have gone
off upon a drinking bout&mdash;he had done that several times in
the nine years of their married life&mdash;and there again, she
wanted to hush things up as much as possible."</p>

<p>"Well, having got this far, I probed for the reason why she
thought her husband had gone poaching, and learnt she was of that
opinion, because firstly, she had noticed him mending an old dog
leash in the afternoon, and it was no longer to be found upon the
premises, and secondly, because the greyhound or lurcher, or
whatever kind of breed the animal is, had been found unchained in
his kennel the following morning, which was most unusual, and
moreover, he had been very tired and stiff all the succeeding
day, as if he had had a hard night's work. Added to that, the
beast had refused all food as if he had recently had a
surfeit."</p>

<p>Jones nodded solemnly. "I thought over everything well, and
came to the conclusion that the deductions were quite sound and
that therefore, the next matter for me to consider was where the
poaching had been done. I was of opinion pretty soon that Baxter
could have only been going after hares, because he had taken the
lurcher with him, obviously with the intention of running them
down, and I straightaway started upon discreet enquiries in the
town as to where most hares were to be found."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment again and Larose asked curiously, "And
you picked upon Thralldom at once, Mr. Jones?"</p>

<p>Jones looked very pleased with himself. "No, no," he smiled,
"and there, Mr. Larose, I flatter myself upon a very pretty
little piece of reasoning." He lifted one long forefinger. "There
are several places around Yoxford where hares can be found, but I
was emphatically warned by a richly-complexioned individual, to
whom I supplied certain forms of liquid refreshment, and who was
undoubtedly of opinion that I was going to indulge in a little
poaching myself, above all places to avoid Thralldom for there,
he averred, poison baits had been extensively laid down."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Larose, for the great master was tantalisingly
making a long pause.</p>

<p>"Well," smiled Jones, "I at once thought of that dog-leash and
hurried back to Mrs. Baxter to question her about the dog. It was
a most obedient animal, I learnt, and would follow and always
come to heel. Then where was the necessity for the leash? I asked
myself, unless&mdash;&mdash;" and he nodded his head
significantly&mdash;"it were needed to keep the dog close to his
owner's side so that no poison baits should be picked up on the
journeys to and fro? In effect, so that the animal should only
have his head free when in actual pursuit of a hare."</p>

<p>"A most sound piece of reasoning, Mr. Jones," commented
Larose, "and it seems so simple when you explain it."</p>

<p>Naughton Jones smiled with appreciation at the compliment and
went on briskly, "So to Thralldom I came, and I spent four hard
days among these meadows, these plantations, and these marshes
going carefully almost yard by yard, over the ground." He
frowned. "I received several rebuffs, and three times was warned
away by different employees of Lord Thralldom, but I invariably
returned from another direction a few minutes later, and in the
end, I obtained my reward. I found the cap by the end of a small
plantation of larch trees, about a quarter of a mile from the
castle itself."</p>

<p>"You are sure it had belonged to Baxter?" rapped out Larose
sharply.</p>

<p>Naughton Jones smiled again. "Quite sure," he replied. "His
wife had given me the description of the only cap that was
missing, and besides, it had his initials 'S.B.' in the lining,
in indelible blue pencil. It had evidently been blown under the
bush when I discovered it."</p>

<p>"But you have found no traces of the body?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"None whatever, and there was nothing to show that Baxter had
been killed within a hundred yards of the plantation. From the
bloody condition of the cap, a lot of blood must have been spilt,
but I could see no sign of it anywhere about." Jones shook his
head. "But that is not to be wondered at for it was exactly three
weeks to the day after Baxter disappeared that I found the cap
and there had been several rainy days in between."</p>

<p>"But the body!" exclaimed Larose. "If Baxter were killed as
you say, it must surely have been hidden somewhere near?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," smiled Jones. "It may have been carried a
long way, with the cap falling off at any moment of the
journey."</p>

<p>"But who would have gone to the trouble of carrying the body a
long way?" asked Larose bluntly. "Once the man was dead, surely
the murderer would have cleared off and left the body where it
was?" He looked with hard intentness at Jones as he put the
question and almost as if he had no belief in his own suggestion,
but were only desirous of learning what the other's opinion might
be.</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Jones quickly, "and that is just my point."
His face grew very stern and he spoke in a slow and solemn tone.
"Whoever killed Sam Baxter was not content only that he had
killed him but he also held that it was necessary that nothing
that had happened should be known. He was killing upon ground to
which he desired no suspicion should be drawn, for"&mdash;and
here Jones paused dramatically&mdash;"it was in his mind that it
might be necessary for him to kill there again."</p>

<p>The heart of the detective was beating rapidly, and once more
he had to mask from his face all indication of what was passing
in his mind. So, this pompous and long-winded pedant, with his
petty and laughable conceits, was nevertheless trailing
unerringly upon the very path that he, Larose, had been imagining
he, alone, had picked up!</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Jones calmly, "and in my opinion we have a
madman here and I know who he is."</p>

<p>"Who?" burst out Larose quickly.</p>

<p>"James Augustus Rawlings," was the instant reply. "He came
upon Baxter poaching, but thought Baxter was there to injure his
blessed cows. That's the whole thing in a nutshell."</p>

<p>A long silence followed and then Jones dropped into sonorous
academic tones again. "The human mind, Mr. Larose, is at times
the victim of its own marvellous evolution for its weakness lies
in its very strength. Concentration in any particular and
strictly definite direction is always prone to induce a condition
of morbidity, a pathological&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But have you the very slightest evidence," broke in Larose
sharply, "that Rawlings had anything to do with Baxter's murder
even if it be, as you say, that Baxter is dead?"</p>

<p>Naughton Jones held up his hand. "Listen, Mr. Larose. It is
now three days since I found that cap, and I have not been idle,
indeed, I do not think I have ever worked harder in all my life.
I have enquired into the private histories and dispositions of
most of the responsible people about here, and this is what,
amongst other things, I have found out." He spoke in natural
tones now. "Rawlings is a quiet and taciturn man, and
passionately devoted to all his duties. He is thorough in
everything, but is not liked because he is hard, cold and
unsympathetic in his dealings with everyone outside his home.
Lord Thralldom, a weak old man, and thinking of little now except
his paintings, leaves all the management of the estate to him and
the bailiff does pretty well everything he likes. His word is
law. Well, his one passion in life appears to be a herd of Jersey
cows. It is his obsession and, to the exclusion of everything
else, it is the only thing he loves. He has been very successful
with them, and the Thralldom strain is spoken of wherever men
talk of cattle, and at all the Agricultural Shows, when a beast
is entered in his name, Lord Thralldom is invariably a prize-winner."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Larose, because Jones was exasperatingly
stopping to fill his pipe again.</p>

<p>But Jones was not to be hurried, and not until the pipe was
well alight would he condescend to continue.</p>

<p>"Now, Rawlings is quite aware he is not popular, and, of late,
he has come to the idea that, to spite him, people are on the
look-out to injure his cows. He has been heard to state that to
several, and to prevent any dogs coming on to the estate, he has
been laying strychnine about. He denies it, but his denial is not
credited. Well, just now he has been very much on his toes
because the pride of the herd, a beast known as Queen Guinivere,
is calving and he is certain that many of his enemies would like
to get at her. So, what does he do?"</p>

<p>"Well, what?" broke in Larose impatiently, because Jones had
stopped again.</p>

<p>"He takes to roaming about at night. He stalks the meadows,
the cliffs and the marshes. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know this?" interrupted Larose, with his eyes
opened very wide.</p>

<p>"Because several lots of people have seen him and it can be
corroborated. Not single individuals, I tell you, but groups of
people. Four men and a woman met him about three weeks ago
towards midnight, when they were coming back to Dunwich from
Saxmundham. Two couples met him last Sunday night, near
Thebarton, and this week, no later than Tuesday, half a dozen
glee-singers passed him as they were going to Darsham."</p>

<p>"This week!" ejaculated Larose. "Since he disappeared!"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Jones, "five nights ago, and they all
recognised him."</p>

<p>The face of Larose was the very picture of astonishment. "Did
they speak to him?" he gasped.</p>

<p>Jones shook his head. "No, they called out to him, but he did
not answer."</p>

<p>"But his wife never mentioned to me," said Larose frowning,
"that he ever went out at night."</p>

<p>"Did you ask her?" demanded Jones, and when Larose shook his
head, the great investigator rapped out, "And perhaps she didn't
know. Do they sleep in the same bed? Did you make sure of
that?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," replied Larose, now beginning to look annoyed.
"I never went into their bedroom, and it would have been of no
use if I had. She was moving out late yesterday afternoon and the
place was all upside down." He spoke very sharply. "But, good
heavens! if the bailiff is still alive, then what on earth has he
disappeared for?"</p>

<p>Jones looked very mysterious. "That's what I want to know," he
replied. "My personal opinion is that he has gone mad and has
just pretended to disappear, in the expectation of the more
easily catching one of his enemies in the act of attacking his
cows."</p>

<p>"Well, his master thinks he's dead," said Larose bluntly, "for
he has appointed a successor to him." He rose to his feet. "Well,
at any rate, I intend going up to the castle to see Lord
Thralldom this afternoon and then I'll be able to tell you what
his opinion is of his late bailiff, but I'll go and have another
talk with Mrs. Rawlings first." He looked sharply at Jones. "But
if Rawlings killed the innkeeper, what did he do with the
body?"</p>

<p>"Buried it," replied Jones promptly. "I am now looking for a
grave upon the ploughed land. I can find no trace of recently
turned earth anywhere in any of the plantations." He nodded. "I
was suspicious of the castle moat until I learnt that it is
cleaned out periodically, and the last occasion was not three
weeks ago. They open a sluice gate and the moat empties itself on
to the marshes. Then it is filled again by water pumped from the
river. It is one of the present Lord Thralldom's fads to keep the
water always fresh, and a very good fad too. He had the pipes
laid down some years ago."</p>

<p>They walked slowly back in the direction of the inn and then,
suddenly, Naughton Jones swept his arm all round upon the lands
of Thralldom.</p>

<p>"A beautiful scene, is it not, Mr. Larose?" he remarked. "All
peace and quiet and the tranquillity of the smiling countryside,"
he shook his head frowningly, "and yet I am sure that at the
present moment it shelters forces of evil that do not meet the
eye." He lowered his voice. "There are some queer people about
here, I tell you." He pointed with his hand to an old house,
close down upon the shore. "Now there are three birds living
there that are interesting. One is an American&mdash;I have heard
him talk&mdash;and he is a purposeful, bustling type of man that
looks quite out of place down here; a second is supposed to be
his servant, but he has the cut about his jib of a house-breaker
to me, and to the third I have given the time of day four or five
times upon the marshes, and <i>he</i> always looks at me with a
sort of look 'I am up to some fishy business and what are you
here for?'" Naughton Jones sighed. "I listened under their window
last night, but it was well shut down, and all I got for my pains
was a torn stocking and some tar upon my clothes."</p>

<p>Larose smiled. "You are always so energetic, Mr. Jones. Do you
never allow yourself any rest?"</p>

<p>"I have so trained my subconscious mind&mdash;&mdash;" began
Jones grandly, and then suddenly he clutched his companion by the
arm, and pointed to a man coming towards them upon the sands.
"Quick, quick," he exclaimed, "isn't it that fellow Croupin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Raphael Croupin!" ejaculated Larose. "So it is. Our
lively colleague from Paris!"</p>

<p>"Quick, down under this groyne," commanded Jones sternly. "He
mayn't have seen us and may pass by," and almost dragging the
detective with him, he darted behind a big, wooden groyne, one of
the many erected there, to stem the inroads of the sea.</p>

<p>"Our lively colleague from Paris!" he went on sneeringly, as
they were crouching upon the stones. He looked very sternly at
the detective. "Do you know, Mr. Larose, I have thousands of
times regretted my association with that man in the assistance I
gave to Ephraim Smith last year? It detracts from my self-respect
to think that I ever worked, side by side, with a thief."</p>

<p>"But he was a great help to us, Mr. Jones," said the detective
gently, "and personally, he is a pleasant, likeable fellow."</p>

<p>"But a thief!" exclaimed Jones, "a self-admitted thief. A man
who in his own Paris has his own organisation of crime." He
laughed scornfully. "And just because he is good-looking in his
simpering way, and comes from aristocratic forbears, and steals
only from the very rich, and broadcasts his successful thievings
from the housetops, and has amorous intrigues with silly women in
Society," he shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, "he is the
idol and joke of all France, and of that France I should say who
would be great rogues themselves if they had the courage and the
brains." He pressed hard on the detective's arm. "But look out,
here he comes."</p>

<p>The man, whose demerits Naughton Jones had been so
energetically discussing, reached to within a few paces of where
they were crouching, and then stayed his steps and stood quite
still, looking out over the sea.</p>

<p>As Naughton Jones had said, he was certainly good-looking. Of
medium height and slight in build, he had wavy chestnut hair and
nicely chiselled features. He had an aristocratic, aquiline nose
and a sensitive, refined mouth. His dark eyes were large and
dreamy, and shaded with long lashes. Indeed, he was as pretty as
a woman except for the firmness and virility of his
expression.</p>

<p>For quite a long while he stood gazing upon the sea, as if
drinking in to the full the beauty of its rolling waves. Then he
sighed and was about to continue upon his walk, when his eyes
fell upon the two figures crouching under the groyne. He just
gave a careless glance but suddenly, then, looked very puzzled,
and finally his face broke into a radiant smile and he came
forward quickly with outstretched arms.</p>

<p>"My friends!" he exclaimed in perfect English and speaking
with only a very slight accent. "Gilbert Larose and the great
Meester Naughton Jones! Oh! but I am pleased to meet you."</p>

<p>Naughton Jones rose up with a frown and Larose followed,
looking very amused.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Monsieur Croupin?" said the detective,
smiling, and he at once took the hand the Frenchman proffered and
shook it warmly.</p>

<p>Jones, however, kept his arms close to his side and made no
movement to shake hands. "Good day, Mr. Croupin," he said with
marked disfavour in his voice. "I did not expect to meet you
again in England." He eyed him quickly up and down and added
rudely, "But I notice you are not attired after your usual
fashion."</p>

<p>Croupin opened his eyes wide, as if very surprised, and then
with a worried look proceeded to glance down over his
clothes.</p>

<p>"But I am all right," he said wonderingly, "all good English
clothes. Everything bought in London."</p>

<p>"But they are black," persisted Jones, with a sour smile.
"Where is your cravat of peacock blue, your vest of rainbow
colours and the buttonhole of the philanderer?" He laughed
sneeringly. "Your whole get-up is less of the style of the
seducer, Mr. Croupin."</p>

<p>"Oh! Meester Jones!" exclaimed Croupin reproachfully, "and I
am thinking of joining the Young Men's Christian Association. I
have been pressed by several clergymen to do so."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you doing here?" asked Jones truculently and
as if it were his right to know. "Up to no good, I am sure."</p>

<p>The Frenchman looked aggrieved. "I am on holiday, just on
holiday in your beautiful country." He grinned confidingly. "I am
too popular just at present over the sea, and my company is too
much desired in my beloved Paris." An idea seemed suddenly to
strike him, and he looked with interest at the great Jones. "But
you, Meester Jones, what has happened to you? You are dressed
differently now"&mdash;he spread out his hands&mdash;"and you
look less like a bloodhound. You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where were you staying?" broke in Jones angrily.</p>

<p>"Oh! staying!" ejaculated Croupin apparently in no wise
aggrieved at being so unceremoniously interrupted. "I am staying
at Southwold, ah! and that reminds me." He glanced at his wrist
watch and then whistled in dismay. "Oh! I have to be back at four
o'clock. There is a Mission Service on the sands then and I am to
lead the singing of the hymns." He raised his hat hurriedly, with
a grand flourish and then, with the suspicion of a wink in the
direction of Larose, called out "Good-bye, good-bye," and turning
upon his heels made off as quickly as he could.</p>

<p>"A natural rogue!" remarked Jones with a scowl following the
retreating figure with his eyes, "and upon another thieving
expedition, without doubt." He nodded his head viciously. "At any
rate, I'll make some enquiries in Southwold to-night."</p>

<p>The two parted a few minutes later, with Jones enjoining upon
the detective to meet him on the morrow at the same place, and
inform him as to the result of his interview with Lord
Thralldom.</p>

<p>Returning to the inn, Larose took out his car and drove into
Thebarton to have a few words with Mrs. Rawlings. He was very
perplexed about the discovery Naughton Jones had imparted to him.
"But if Rawlings be still alive," he argued to himself, "and if
he is the madman I am looking for, then where does that
Halesworth butcher come in?" He shook his head. "But it does not
seem feasible to me that the bailiff could have been leading that
double life without his wife having had some suspicion about it,
and she is certainly in the dark, for her distress is genuine,
and she is not a woman who could play her part in a conspiracy
like this. She is genuinely grieved, too, at being turned out of
her house." He tossed his head contemptuously. "And if she knows
her husband to be still alive, why was she at such pains to
obtain the intervention of the Yard."</p>

<p>He found Mrs. Rawlings in her new home, and asking her at once
if her husband were in the habit of going out at night, she
replied most emphatically, "No." She admitted, however, that they
had always occupied separate beds, and indeed that she was not a
light sleeper, but she scoffed altogether at the idea that
Rawlings could have gone out more than once or twice without her
hearing him.</p>

<p>"Besides," she said in conclusion, "I know every pair of boots
he's got, and clean them all, so if he had been going out at
night, I should have noticed it, at once." And the detective
parted from her, more puzzled than ever.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; LAROSE AT THRALLDOM CASTLE</h2>

<p class="first">JOHN HARDEN was certainly no laggard in love. He
had seen Ann Devenham often at the bank, had met her twice
outside, had danced with her seven times, and was convinced that
she was the most beautiful and wonderful creature in all the
world. Also, he was certain that she had not resented that last
final pressure of the hand that he had given her upon the night
of the Shire Ball, and almost, he thought, and his heart beat
tumultuously at the idea, she had in a gentle way returned
it.</p>

<p>He was in no wise deterred by the knowledge that she was a
relation of the great Lord Thralldom and he only a bank clerk
upon a salary of &pound;5 a week, with his father a struggling
doctor in the East End of London. It was sufficient to him that
she was a woman and would one day, he knew, be he rich or poor,
noble or otherwise, respond to the advances of a lover.</p>

<p>So that bright afternoon found him tramping over the Thralldom
marshes to the castle, to obtain speech with her again, his
excuse being that he was bringing up some books they had been
discussing at the last dance. He had written her that he might be
passing, one day, and would leave them for her.</p>

<p>He was striding along full of his own thoughts, wondering if
she would be at the castle, how she would meet him, what she
would say, and what sort of reception he would get for his
enterprise from Lady Deering and the great Lord of Thralldom,
when gradually he became aware that a motor car was coming up
behind him and, turning round, recognised in the driver, the
detective from Scotland Yard who had called at the bank the
previous day.</p>

<p>Larose recognising him at the same moment, pulled up, and
asked if he would like a lift.</p>

<p>"You are going to the castle, of course," he said as the young
fellow jumped up beside him, "I understand this road leads only
to there."</p>

<p>John Harden nodded and then asked smilingly, "Found anything
yet to help you about Mr. Holden?"</p>

<p>Larose looked sideways at him. He was quite a handsome boy,
with good chin and mouth and nice honest eyes. He saw he was
being well scrutinised, and noticed, too, the hesitation of the
detective in replying to his question.</p>

<p>"But I suppose I ought not to have asked you that," he added.
"All detectives, I understand are very secretive."</p>

<p>"On the contrary," laughed Larose, "for we often obtain vital
information by imparting information ourselves, first. No, I
haven't found out anything for certain yet, but I am staying for
a few days at the inn on Minsmere Haven and may pick up something
any time. But tell me," he added, "did Mr. Holden know Lord
Thralldom?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," was the reply, "his lordship has an account at our
bank. He very rarely comes in, however, and we haven't seen him
at all since his illness about six months ago. He can hardly walk
now."</p>

<p>"And you are going up to see him on business, may I ask?" said
Larose.</p>

<p>"No-o," replied the young man hesitatingly, and the detective
made a mental note that he had got rather red.</p>

<p>A moment's silence followed and then the boy went on&mdash;"A
wonderful old place this, sir, is it not? One of the best
preserved castles in England. There's a lot of romance about it,
too, for gold treasure is supposed to be hidden somewhere, and
generations of Thralldoms have been trying to find it."</p>

<p>They chatted on during the short journey and then, as they
were approaching close to the castle young Harden exclaimed
suddenly, "Oh! you might just put me down here, if you don't
mind; I may not be going into the castle until later."</p>

<p>Instantly, Larose following the direction of the boy's eyes,
saw the bright colour of a woman's dress among the trees of the
big garden upon one side of the road.</p>

<p>"Ah! ah!" he thought, "but I might have guessed something of
that nature from his happy expression." He sighed. "Really, I am
not much of a detective and am growing old."</p>

<p>He dropped his passenger as requested, and with his eyes
roaming everywhere, crossed the bridge over the moat. Alighting
from the car, he pressed upon the bell at the side of the big
door.</p>

<p>"My conscience!" he ejaculated looking round, "but this place
looks prepared for a siege, even now. With that great spiked door
shut, it would need a battering ram before one could cross the
bridge and, although this front door is invitingly open, that
steel grille inside has first to be passed before one can enter
the castle." He nodded, "Yes, this old chap here certainly keeps
himself select."</p>

<p>A tall footman, resplendently attired in the livery of the
Thralldoms appeared, and with a sharp movement of his arm, opened
a small door in the grille.</p>

<p>"I want to see Lord Thralldom, please," said Larose.</p>

<p>The footman, eyeing him intently, shook his head. "I'm sorry,
sir," he replied, "but his lordship sees no one except by
appointment and he has made no appointments for to-day."</p>

<p>"But he'll see me," said the detective. "I'm from Scotland
Yard. Take this card to him, please."</p>

<p>The footman received the card and glanced down at it, but he
still looked doubtful. "I'll enquire, sir," he said, and
retreating behind the grille, he pushed it to and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Larose looked out across the moat and was an interested
observer of the meeting of young Harden and the wearer of the
bright dress among the trees. The lifting of a hat with great
reverence, the outstretching of two hands, and the gentle
inclination towards each other of two heads.</p>

<p>"Like two doves meeting upon the roof," he commented dryly.
"The madness of life, its greatest mystery, its greatest urge!"
He sighed. "Nothing in it at all and yet&mdash;the very glory of
life itself." He looked again at the huge, spiked door upon the
bridge and then at the grille. "But it seems I shall be getting a
cool reception here."</p>

<p>But he was quite mistaken there, for the footman returning in
less than a minute, the grille was opened and he was conducted
through an immense hall and down a long corridor into the library
where the great Lord of Thralldom received him with a courteous,
if haughty, bow.</p>

<p>His lordship was standing, supporting himself against a big
arm-chair, and he waved the detective to another chair placed at
the other side of the table, before seating himself. He stared
intently at his visitor with big, fierce, penetrating eyes. The
footman, evidently acting upon instructions, took up a position
behind his master, and immediately proceeded to assume the
detached and impassive pose of the well-trained servant.</p>

<p>"I must apologise for troubling you, my lord," began the
detective, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You say you are from Scotland Yard," interrupted Lord
Thralldom. "Show me your badge. I am a magistrate and understand
these things."</p>

<p>Larose at once complied and then began again. "I am sorry, my
lord, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?" came the deep, stern tones.</p>

<p>"I have come about your bailiff, Rawlings," replied
Larose.</p>

<p>"So I supposed," commented Lord Thralldom instantly. "I
understand his wife had approached the London police." He looked
scornful. "But what her reason was, I cannot see. The local
police are quite capable enough to deal with a matter such as
this."</p>

<p>"What do you think has happened to him?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Happened!" exclaimed his lordship. "How do I know? I am as
much in the dark as anyone. He may have walked over the cliff and
got drowned. I have been losing a lot of my sheep lately, that
way. He was short-sighted and very obstinate in refusing to wear
glasses, and those over-hanging cliffs are dangerous to people of
good sight, even in the day time. He may have done that or he
may&mdash;&mdash;" He turned sharply to the footman. "You can
leave us, James, and close the door after you."</p>

<p>He ceased speaking until the footman had left the room and
then went on very quietly. "Or he may have had a quarrel with his
wife and just taken himself off to be away from her for a few
days." He nodded his head. "That is quite possible, for she is
pig-headed and obstinate, that woman. Just as obstinate as he
used to be."</p>

<p>"But you are certain he is dead, are you not, my lord?"
persisted Larose. "You are assured of that in your own mind?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all," replied Lord Thralldom quickly. "I
am assured of nothing, I tell you, except that his absence from
his duties dates from that morning when he could not be
found."</p>

<p>"But you have made Mrs. Rawlings leave her home," frowned
Larose, "and appointed a new bailiff."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom shrugged his shoulders. "As a matter of
routine, sir," he replied. "Upon a large estate like mine, I
cannot spare any servant for any length of time."</p>

<p>"Another question, my lord," said the detective. "I understand
that Rawlings was in your service for over twenty years and
therefore I am quite sure you must have formed a very accurate
estimation of his character." He looked sharply at him. "Now did
it ever strike you that he was unbalanced in his mind?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" replied Lord Thralldom promptly. "He was a
cold, unemotional man, and secretive and reserved, if you like,
but there was nothing, no nothing, mentally deficient about him.
He was as sane as you or I." He bent forward confidingly towards
the detective. "Now, you take it from me, sir, that there is no
occasion to go further into this matter. Either Rawlings has
given himself leave of absence and will return of his own accord
in due time, or else he has fallen over those cliffs and been
drowned. Of course there is nothing certain, but those are the
only two alternatives that I can suggest." He smiled in a
friendly way at the detective. "So you just go back to Scotland
Yard, say you have seen Lord Thralldom and that there is no need
to make any further enquiries." He frowned. "It is most annoying
to me to have detectives coming about the place, and it is most
distressing for Mrs. Rawlings to have the matter kept open for so
long."</p>

<p>"But if he has been drowned," said Larose, "the
body&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bodies are never washed up here," broke in Lord Thralldom.
"It is a peculiarity of the current round this coast, that they
are carried out into deep water and then&mdash;well I suppose
they are eaten by the conger eels. We never see anything of my
drowned sheep."</p>

<p>"But is your lordship aware," went on Larose, "that it is
rumoured Rawlings was in the habit of roaming about in the dark,
even as late as midnight and at hours after that?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not aware," replied Lord Thralldom, instantly. He
looked scornful. "But then the gossip of the villages never comes
to my ears."</p>

<p>"Do you believe it?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom appeared quite uninterested. "I knew nothing of
my bailiff's private life." He looked sharply at the detective.
"But what if he did? It might have been his habit to take walking
exercise at night."</p>

<p>"But there are people who say they have actually met him,"
continued Larose, "even upon nights later than the one upon which
he disappeared. Upon one occasion, as recently as last
Tuesday."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom was interested now. He looked astounded and
raised himself quickly with a jerk. "What!" he exclaimed, with
his eyes opened very wide, "who saw him last Tuesday?"</p>

<p>"Some men who were returning from Darsham," replied Larose.
"They called out to him, but he didn't answer."</p>

<p>For a few moments then, there was silence, with Lord Thralldom
staring hard at the detective, with his face all puckered into a
heavy frown. Then he laughed scoffingly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," he said sharply, "for if he's about the
place, he would have returned to duty. I know enough about the
man to be sure of that."</p>

<p>"But these men&mdash;&mdash;" began Larose.</p>

<p>"Will say anything," interrupted his lordship, "and spread any
tales." He shook his head solemnly. "None but they, sir, who have
lived on the countryside can realise the foolishness and
credulity of these villagers. They will see and say anything.
They believe in ghosts and charms and witches and nothing is too
gross for their superstitions." He looked contemptuous. "They
never saw Rawlings, they just imagined they did."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, and then the detective said slowly,
"So you can give me no help at all, my lord?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," was the reply. "Either the man will turn up
of his own accord, as I say, or else&mdash;his disappearance will
remain a mystery for ever."</p>

<p>The detective was rising to his feet to terminate the
interview when Lord Thralldom said suddenly, "Oh! whilst you are
here, sir, perhaps you will very kindly give me your opinion upon
another matter." The fierce, intent look came again into his
eyes. "I have some very valuable paintings here, and among
others, have recently acquired a Rubens that I would not sell for
&pound;40,000. I have taken every conceivable precaution for
their safety, but do you think"&mdash;he looked most worried and
anxious&mdash;"that any miscreants would dare to make use of
explosives, to break in here."</p>

<p>Larose laughed. "Explosives make a lot of noise, my lord," he
replied, "and this castle is not sufficiently isolated for any
burglars to run the risk of arousing the countryside."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom pursed up his lips. "But the Earl of Balir lost
two Hogarths that way, and remember, they used explosives
there."</p>

<p>"A lonely house in the Highlands," smiled Larose, "an aged
caretaker and his wife, and no help forthcoming within twenty
miles."</p>

<p>But Lord Thralldom looked unconvinced. "I am an old man," he
said wistfully, "and have little to live for but my
paintings"&mdash;he sighed&mdash;"and they are a great worry to
me. I am in poor health and an invalid and have to leave
everything to others." His face grew hard and grim again. "And
this castle is being watched, I know. These last few days even,
an evil-looking man has been seen prowling about the meadows. I
have seen him myself through my glasses, several times. He is
disguised, I am sure, for he is got up like a golfer on the
stage. I have had him ordered away, but he always returns."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think you need worry, my lord," smiled Larose,
very much amused at this description of the great Naughton Jones.
"You are well protected. That grille in the hall would take a lot
of breaking through." He rose to his feet and inclined his head.
"I am much obliged to your lordship for seeing me."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Lord Thralldom, brightening up. "I only
wish I could help you. But you'll take some refreshment," he
added. He pressed a bell upon the table. "Oh! but I insist. My
footman will take you to the pantry."</p>

<p>The detective acquiesced. It was a hot day and he was thirsty,
besides he was nothing loth to have the chance of picking up some
information from the servants and accordingly, he was led away in
the direction of the kitchen regions.</p>

<p>Reaching the servants' hall, where three prepossessing maids
were having tea, the footman paused. "Which would you prefer,
sir?" he asked the detective, "a glass of beer in the pantry, or
a cup of tea with the young ladies here."</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied Larose gallantly, "a cup of tea, of course," and
at once a place was made for him at the table, and tea poured out
by one of the smiling girls.</p>

<p>"Froggy, Froggy," called out the footman, "we've got a
visitor, so bring out some of those poisonous cakes of yours,"
and then winking at the detective, he whispered, "We've got a new
French chef here and he can beat the world with his stuff."</p>

<p>"'Orl right, I come, I come," came a merry voice from the
kitchen and Larose gasped in surprise, for the voice of the
unseen Froggy was undoubtedly that of the jovial thief, Raphael
Croupin.</p>

<p>Half a minute later, the chef came into view, carrying a
generous pile of cakes upon a dish, but dish and all began
slipping from his hands as his eyes fell upon Larose. His jaw
dropped and he was the very picture of consternation.</p>

<p>"Steady, Froggy," called out the footman angrily. "What's up
with you? You'll be spilling all your trash."</p>

<p>The chef recovered himself instantly, and the look of
consternation changed in a flash to one of impudent
amusement.</p>

<p>"This is Froggy," introduced the footman, "and this gentleman,
Froggy," he added in mock severity, "is a detective who has come
down from Scotland Yard to arrest you for bigamy."</p>

<p>"Non, non," laughed Croupin showing his beautiful white teeth,
"for I have nevaire even a sweetheart until I come here and
now"&mdash;he bowed to the giggling girls&mdash;"I have three all
at once."</p>

<p>He set the dish upon the table with a great flourish, and then
asked smilingly of Larose, "You speak French, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Not much," replied the detective, a little grimly, "but I
understand it."</p>

<p>Immediately, then Croupin spoke rapidly in French. "Meet me at
nine o'clock at the old hut by the plantation on the marsh road.
I will explain. It is urgent." And then he turned with a mirthful
eye to the girls. "Zat means in my language, 'You must not fall
in love with any of zem, for I love zem all.'" And he laughed
heartily at his own impudence.</p>

<p>Over the tea and cakes the detective then proceeded to chat
easily with the servants, and was at once on good terms with
them. He speedily brought round the conversation to the
disappearance of the bailiff, and soon learnt that they were
unanimously of opinion that the man had fallen over the cliff and
been drowned.</p>

<p>The footman, James, a big, strong fellow, but apparently not
over-gifted with brains and inclined to be loquacious, was sure
of it. Two holiday-makers were drowned there last year, he gave
as his reason for being so certain, and as things always happened
in threes, then of course, it had been for the bailiff to
complete the sequence.</p>

<p>At the last moment, when the detective had made his good-byes
to the girls and was leaving the room, Croupin again spoke in
French and, as before, very rapidly.</p>

<p>"To-night at nine," he called out, "and I'll startle you. I
believe that man was murdered." And then he smilingly explained
to the girls, "Zat means I shall be marrying one of you, but I am
not certain which one yet."</p>

<p>The detective was not a little thoughtful upon his journey
back to the inn, and he had to confess to himself that his ideas
were now in a state of bewildering chaos. Was Rawlings alive or
dead, and could the information that Naughton Jones had picked up
be relied upon? If Jones were right about Rawlings, then
everything would fit in with the ideas that he, Larose, had
conceived, and the disappearances of the other three missing
people would be explained. A madman roaming upon Thralldom at
night, and striking down indiscriminately everyone he met! But if
Jones were wrong then the mystery was in a way as far from being
solved as ever, unless the butcher from Halesworth stepped in to
fill the bill.</p>

<p>He gave it up at last with a sigh and then he nodded his head
with a grim smile. "Well, we'll see what Monsieur Croupin has to
say to-night. He may be a thief and everything that Jones said
about him, but for all that, he's a shrewd fellow, and it's a
Heaven-sent gift having him now as an ally inside the
castle."</p>

<p>Now there is always a mystery about the way of a man with a
maid and the wile of a maid with a man, and when the two have
fallen in love with one another, long before the boundaries of
the polite and distant conventionalities of life are passed,
there is always a perfect, though it may be wholly unconscious,
understanding between them.</p>

<p>And so it was now with Ann Devenham and young Harden. They
were in love with one another and both desirous, in their
differing ways, that the raptures of real love-making should
eventuate as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>The boy, man-like, would have stormed the castle at once with
no delay, and the girl would have been quite willing, except that
the usages and customs of her class demanded that she should be
courted with due ceremony, in stages, and with the usual
maddening uncertainty upon her lover's side. She had never been
really in love before, but now she had quite made up her mind
that she would like young Harden for a husband, and so, when she
had said good-bye to him after the last dance at the Assembly
Hall, she had smiled upon him in such a way that only the densest
youth could have failed to realise that he was being encouraged
to seek further opportunities for seeing her.</p>

<p>Ann was quite a determined young woman, and although she knew
that neither her step-mother nor her great-uncle would look with
favour upon his suit, she did not forget that she was over
twenty-one years old and her own mistress, as far as the bestowal
of her affections was concerned. She was sure Lord Thralldom
would be furious, for he was always reminding her of her
Thralldom blood, and took it for granted that she would, one day,
ally herself with a family that was as old and distinguished as
her own.</p>

<p>She was weary of her days at Thralldom Castle, however, and
the advent of John Harden into her life was like the sunshine
breaking through upon the drab and dreariness of a winter's
day.</p>

<p>But, of course, when young Harden appeared among the trees
that sunny afternoon, the ordinary happenings as usual upon such
occasions, occurred.</p>

<p>She saw him coming perfectly well, but pretended not to have
done so, and turned a slim and dainty shoulder in his direction.
Then when he spoke, she appeared startled, as is customary, and
returned his greeting with a most becoming blush upon her
face.</p>

<p>They shook hands, and while his would have lingered, she drew
hers gently away.</p>

<p>"I've brought you those books of poems that we spoke about,"
he said, and his voice was a little husky.</p>

<p>"Oh I how very nice of you! I've wanted to read them for ever
so long," she fibbed sweetly, for she was quite aware there were
copies of the same books, that she could have perused any time,
in the castle library. "Did you walk here?" she went on,
evidently desirous of giving him the impression that she had not
seen him alight from a car.</p>

<p>"Part of the way," he replied, "but then someone who was going
to see Lord Thralldom, gave me a lift."</p>

<p>"Still, you must be tired," she said smiling. "Come over here
and we'll sit down," and she led the way to a big garden seat
that was partly hidden from view among the trees.</p>

<p>They were soon chatting easily and naturally to one another,
but each with a set purpose in everything they said. He told her
that his father was a doctor in London, that his life in the bank
was very monotonous and dreary, but that he was ambitious, and
writing a book, and she told him about herself and her life in
the castle.</p>

<p>Her father was dead and she had intended to be a nurse once,
then she and her stepmother had come to Thralldom because they
had not been left well off, and her grand-uncle had offered them
a home. Not that he would have been lonely if they had not come,
for he lived so much for his paintings and nothing else really
mattered to him. His paintings, however, were a great worry to
him and often at night he would hobble up on to the battlements,
and through his glasses, imagine he saw people watching the
castle. Also he used to walk up and down the corridors when
everybody else was in bed.</p>

<p>The castle was really very wonderful&mdash;she would take him
there presently&mdash;but there were many parts of it she had not
seen. More than half of it had been walled off for more than
fifty years and the uninhabited portion was very much as it had
been, hundreds of years ago. No, she had never attempted to
explore it, for Lord Thralldom was fidgety in some ways and did
not like anyone to go in. Once, she had just been shown the
entrance to the dungeons and that was all.</p>

<p>But there were a tremendous number of rooms under the castle
she understood. Huge storage places, dungeons, vaults with graves
and coffins in them, and long passages that descended even deeper
than the moat.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, it was said there were ghosts haunting the
castle. She had never seen any, but occasionally she had heard
noises at night behind the walls, but she had imagined they had
only been rats and she had not been afraid.</p>

<p>Strangers often wrote, asking if they might go over the
castle, but Lord Thralldom always refused. There was supposed to
be treasure buried somewhere in the vaults, gold plate that had
been hidden away when Henry VIII. seized the monasteries, and the
lords of Thralldom had been looking for it for hundreds of years
but none of them had found it.</p>

<p>Her great hobby was music, and she would have been very lonely
but for that. There was a beautiful organ in the chapel&mdash;the
last Lord Thralldom had paid a fortune for it&mdash;and she
played on it every day. Certainly she would take him into the
chapel and show it him, after she had given him some tea.</p>

<p>So, for an hour and more, they talked on, and then having
walked round the garden, they turned their steps towards the
bridge over the moat.</p>

<p>Passing upon their way, they met Larose, who was then leaving
the castle, and the detective flashed an admiring glance upon the
girl.</p>

<p>"Nothing in it, did I say?" he sighed, as he sped by. "Well,
perhaps I might be inclined to qualify that statement in certain
circumstances"&mdash;he smiled&mdash;"and this might be one."</p>

<p>Harden was introduced to Lady Deering, who was very polite, if
a little curious, when she learnt that her stepdaughter had met
him at a dance during her recent stay with the vicar at
Saxmundham. She was puzzled, however, why Ann had mentioned
nothing about his coming up, for, of course, she told herself, he
would not have come without being invited.</p>

<p>Captain Bonnett was puzzled, too, but for a different reason.
He had recognised Harden at once as having been one of the clerks
who had changed one of Silas Hudson's &pound;5 bank notes for him
in the bank at Saxmundham, and he wondered how the devil it was
the fellow came to be having tea at the castle. The captain was
not only puzzled, but in a way of being distinctly furious as
well, for he noticed a most becoming blush upon Ann's face, and
there could be no doubt from her manner towards young Harden,
what had brought it there.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom came in later, and after one hard glance at the
visitor, was courteous but quite uninterested until he heard them
discussing Ruskin's <i>Modern Pictures</i>, and then finding
that, at any rate, the boy knew a little about art, upon Ann's
suggestion, he consented to take them into the picture gallery.
There, Harden was so obviously enthralled with the beauty of 'The
Man of Sorrows' that his manner towards him thawed considerably
and finally, he invited him to stay to dinner.</p>

<p>At first young Harden was not a little awed with the
ceremonies of the meal, but Ann was an inspiration, and an
incentive to his courage and he soon appeared as if it were quite
an ordinary thing for him to be waited upon by a butler, and
footmen, attired in gorgeous liveries.</p>

<p>Dinner over, Lord Thralldom retired to the library, and Lady
Deering commandeering Captain Bonnett for a game of chess, Ann
took Harden into the chapel. There, she played for him, like an
angel herself, he thought&mdash;among the angels in the stained
glass windows and the frescoes on the walls.</p>

<p>She played soft, dreamy pieces in the dim religious light, and
carried away by the beauty of the music, he was soon regarding
her with such reverence that he chided himself it was a sacrilege
ever to have been hoping, one day, even to kiss her hand.</p>

<p>She was hallowed, she was divine, and no one was worthy even
to kiss her in their secret thoughts!</p>

<p>But it all came to an end at last with the rapturous sweetness
of a mediaeval vesper, and a few minutes later he was walking
through the scented dusk, bearing in his heart so great a
happiness that he was astonished it did not burst.</p>

<p>She had invited him to come again!</p>

<p>Ann returned to the drawing-room where her stepmother was
still engaged at chess with the angry Captain Bonnett. Lady
Deering looked up as the girl entered, and it was evident from
her manner that she had now been informed by the captain as to
the status of their visitor.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have brought him in, Ann, before asking us,"
she said querulously. "You know how particular your uncle is,"
and when the girl made no reply, she asked&mdash;"What did he
come after?"</p>

<p>Ann smiled as if she were very amused. "Why me, of course,"
she answered, and then when her stepmother looked scandalised at
so unmaidenly an avowal, the girl added with mischief in her
eyes, "or else after uncle's paintings."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE SECRET DOOR</h2>

<p class="first">IT wanted yet five minutes to nine when Raphael
Croupin slipped into the ruined hut by the marsh road and found
Larose waiting for him, seated upon a heap of stones.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Monsieur Croupin," said the detective dryly.
"Then you are not staying in Southwold after all?"</p>

<p>But there was no embarrassment about the Frenchman, and his
eyes twinkled. "Oh! but it was droll you should meet me in the
castle," he exclaimed smilingly, "and yet, when the shock was
over, I was never more glad of anything in all my life, for I
have so much to tell you."</p>

<p>He spoke in excellent English and there was now no trace of
the exaggerated accent that he had made use of in the servants'
hall earlier in the day.</p>

<p>The detective eyed him very sternly. "Well, what are you doing
up there, my friend," he asked, "masquerading as a cook?"</p>

<p>Croupin threw out his hands in a gesture of amazement.
"Masquerading!" he exclaimed indignantly. "And did you not notice
the flavour of my cakes?" He shook his finger accusingly. "You
ate four of them, I saw."</p>

<p>"Never mind about the cakes," said Larose sharply, "but what
did you take that situation at the castle for?"</p>

<p>Croupin appeared surprised at the question. "Why, for the
Rubens, of course." He was quite calm and unflurried. "I thought
it much too beautiful to be in this cold and unappreciative
country and so, I came to borrow it&mdash;for France."</p>

<p>"Oh! you did, did you?" commented Larose grimly. "Then I'll
stop that and you'll clear out at once."</p>

<p>"But it is not necessary, for I have no longer any hope of
it," went on Croupin sadly. "First because it is an old man's
treasure and I would not break his heart, and secondly," he
sighed&mdash;"I see I cannot get it." He shook his head. "No, I
make no attempt to touch it now for I do not understand the
wiring of those alarms. They are of a kind I do not know and are
even fused into the glass. There is talk, too, that they ring
direct into the police station at Saxmundham." He shrugged his
shoulders resignedly. "So, I leave that 'Man of Sorrows'
alone."</p>

<p>"Then for what purpose are you continuing on at the castle?"
asked Larose as if not yet convinced.</p>

<p>The Frenchman's face became all smiles again. "Ah! now that is
quite a different matter and I wait there"&mdash;he lowered his
voice to a whisper&mdash;"because I am in the midst of one of
those mysteries that I love."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head frowningly. "Monsieur Croupin," he said,
"you'll have to make a clean breast of everything. I have a
certain regard for you, as you know, but as an officer attached
to Scotland Yard"&mdash;he nodded&mdash;"but you understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand," nodded back Croupin. He beamed in the
most friendly maimer at the detective. "But I am going to be of
great help to you, Monsieur," he went on, "for I think I know who
killed that bailiff of Lord Thralldom." He paused dramatically.
"He is in the castle now and he is William, one of the footmen up
there."</p>

<p>If he had expected Larose to show any astonishment, he was
disappointed, for the detective eyed him with an expression in
which there was no surprise. "Oh! he is dead, is he?" he said
quietly. "How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," exclaimed Croupin quickly. "I only guess. But
it looks like it. Now, you listen to me." He went on very
solemnly, "That night when the bailiff disappeared, I was up on
the battlements. I had no business to be there because it is
forbidden. It is one of the rules of the castle that the servants
must not go anywhere except where their work is. Besides, it was
late and we are all ordered to go to our rooms at ten. We are
kept like prisoners there, for at ten o'clock to the minute, the
castle is locked and barred everywhere because of those pictures
the lord has, and if you touched a door or a window, alarms would
ring all over the place. Well, it was not long after eleven and
close near to the time when the woman said her husband had got
out of his bed. It was half-moonlight and there was a mist
rolling over the meadows from the marshes, and the moon was
blurred over with clouds. Suddenly I saw someone running and he
had one arm raised up higher than the other. He ran on his toes,
as we run when we do not want our footsteps to be heard. I only
saw him&mdash;just a glimpse&mdash;and then I lost him in the
mist."</p>

<p>"Then?" exclaimed Larose, for Croupin had stopped
speaking.</p>

<p>"Then," went on the Frenchman, breathlessly and stirred into
excitement by his own recital, "I heard a little cry, a cry that
just began and then stopped. I was sure of it. Just a little cry
and very short but&mdash;it was a cry. Then I leant over the
battlements and stared into the shadows of the mist again and
then, whilst he was in my sight for perhaps a dozen
yards"&mdash;he spoke very slowly&mdash;"I saw, it might have
been a different man go by."</p>

<p>"Not the same man?" asked Larose quickly.</p>

<p>"I do not think so," was the reply, "but I only saw him from
above the waist for he was in the mist up to his loins. He looked
tall and big and he walked heavily, as if he were very tired."
Croupin nodded solemnly. "Do you know, Monsieur, I believe the
first man was running with something lifted in his hand, and the
second man"&mdash;his voice had dropped to a whisper
now&mdash;"was carrying a body."</p>

<p>"In which direction was he going?" asked the detective
sharply.</p>

<p>Croupin shook his head. "I cannot be quite sure," he replied,
"but it might have been towards the Priory, I often think."</p>

<p>"And where exactly was this man, or these men, when you saw
them?" went on Larose.</p>

<p>Croupin shook his head for the second time. "Again, I am not
sure, for the mist was so deceiving, but I looked across the
battlements upon the next night, when it was clear, and I thought
it may have been on this side of the plantation, close to the
edge of the big meadow where the cows are."</p>

<p>"And you recognised the footman, you say," asked the detective
with obvious doubt in his voice, "in the mist and darkness and
all that way away?"</p>

<p>"No, no," replied Croupin quickly. "I did not recognise him. I
saw no face at all, and it was not until a few days ago that the
idea came to me that it was William, and then it exploded in me
like a bomb." He spoke most impressively. "It was like this. Last
Tuesday two men came up to the castle to deliver coal and one of
them hurt his wrist in backing the horses and could not lift the
sacks. They told Lady Deering, and as the other footman was in
the village, William had to help. He did not like it, but he got
some overalls from the garage and went carrying the sacks. Then,
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on, Monsieur," said the detective sharply, for Croupin was
hesitating as if he did not know what to say.</p>

<p>"Then," said Croupin slowly, "I was sitting in the kitchen and
I saw him pass before the window every time he carried a sack. I
was not a bit interested at first, but then he got tired and
began to walk slower and slower every time he passed, and
suddenly, I could feel that I was frowning. I was puzzled about
something, and I moved up to the window to make out what it was.
Then, all in an instant I knew why I had frowned." He leant
forward and almost hissed in the detective's ear. "He was walking
in exactly the same way as that second man had walked that night
when I thought he was carrying a body with him through the
mist."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Larose and he glared at the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Yes, his head was bent, his shoulders were bowed and he
walked with the same peculiar, short stride." Croupin threw out
his hands. "It gave me a shock for their way of walking was
exactly the same."</p>

<p>"But how could that footman have got out of the castle," asked
Larose incredulously, "to have been walking about at that time of
night? You say the place is all locked up at ten."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the Frenchman in his turn and his eyes were
bright as stars, "and now I come to something that will even
puzzle the great Larose." He raised one finger warningly. "Listen
carefully for I have a lot to say and must be quick, for
remember, I have to be back in the <i>sacre</i> castle by ten or
I shall be locked out."</p>

<p>He paused a moment as if to marshal all his facts in their
proper order and then went on.</p>

<p>"You have not seen William yet, but only James." He shook his
head. "But of course their names are not really James and
William. The lord always calls all his footmen James and William,
just as if they were his slaves and he has bred them like his
cows. Well, this William is a peculiar man. No, he is not common.
He is educated and has books upon his shelves about great men who
are dead, that I would never read. He is a favourite with the
lord and waits upon him, more than anybody else. He talks very
little and is tall and big. He never opens his eyes wide. They
are like slits, and he turns them from side to side without
moving his head. Rosa&mdash;she is one of the maids&mdash;says
she is sure he is not right and sometimes I, too, have thought
him half mad."</p>

<p>Croupin broke off his narrative and asked suddenly: "You have
never been in prison, Monsieur Larose?" He smiled. "No, I thought
not, but it happens I have. It was when I was quite a young man
and I was punished for what I had not done." He nodded. "That's
what made me the man I am now." He screwed up his face and picked
out his words very carefully. "Now, I think somehow that William
has been in prison, too. I have been in his room several times
and he is very tidy, and always, I notice, he folds up his spare
blanket, just as we did ours in our cells. And another thing, if
you speak to him very suddenly, very softly, he answers you back
without any movement of his lips, just like we did in prison
too."</p>

<p>Croupin smiled again. "So I began to be puzzled about William
soon after I came to the castle and I kept my eyes on him. Then
one morning he borrowed a penknife from James and went out for
his free afternoon before he had returned it. And James wanted it
back and went into William's room to try and find it. And he
looked in a drawer that he ought not to have looked into and
found something hidden at the bottom, so secretly under a lot of
clothes, that he brought it out to show me."</p>

<p>The Frenchman laughed at the intent look upon the detective's
face. "No, nothing startling yet. It was just a book about the
castles of England, but there were well-thumbed pages where it
spoke about this castle here, and it said that there was gold
hidden underneath which had never been found." He shrugged his
shoulders. "But of course we have all heard about that, and
secret passages too. It is the common talk in the villages. So
James was only amused and he put back the book, but he mentioned
then that weeks before he had caught William tapping upon the
chapel walls with a small hammer. James thought nothing of it,
but I"&mdash;and Croupin drew in a deep breath&mdash;"knew at
once what must be in William's mind."</p>

<p>He broke off his narrative here. "That chapel, Monsieur, is
the most interesting of that part of the castle, where we live.
It is very, very old, and it has never been altered in any way.
It is right at the end of the castle and up against the old
walls. We are none of us allowed to go in there, except Rose, who
dusts it every morning, but I have paid several visits, for the
stained-glass windows are supposed to be of great value, and I
was wondering," he grinned, "if they could be cut out and taken
away."</p>

<p>"Go on, Monsieur Croupin," said the detective sternly. "You
can make up your mind that the belongings of the castle will
remain intact. You will take nothing away."</p>

<p>A merry smile was Croupin's only reply, and he picked up the
threads of his story again. "Then, two weeks passed and I was
taking notice, too, to try and find a passage to those vaults. I
thought of likely places and whenever I could get a chance I
sounded upon the walls. But I could discover nothing, and in the
end I told myself I was a fool, for hundred and hundreds before
me must have done the same thing." He lowered his voice
impressively. "Then suddenly I made the startling discovery that
William was in the habit of leaving his room in the middle of the
night. His room is next to mine and many nights, I remembered, I
had heard noises. I had given no thought to them at the time,
believing they were only the rats. We have no rats where we live
in the castle, but we can often hear them in the parts that are
bricked off. Then one night I was wakeful and I heard him coming
into his room about four o'clock in the morning, and the next day
I noticed that he looked very tired."</p>

<p>Croupin paused a few seconds to puff at his cigarette, and
then went on.</p>

<p>"So, that night I kept awake and watched, all ready to follow
him if he went out. But nothing happened that night nor the next,
and the third night I was so tired that I fell asleep, and I was
furious, for I woke up just before four o'clock and heard William
creeping into his room again. Also I heard him pulling out his
trunk that is kept under his bed."</p>

<p>"You are very interesting, Monsieur Croupin," remarked Larose
grimly, as the Frenchman paused again, "but it would be best if
you got on a little quicker, because it will soon be ten
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was furious," went on Croupin taking no notice of the
interruption, "and I made up my mind I would stand no more
nonsense. So, that night I put fifteen grains of veronal into his
coffee and at one o'clock in the morning went in to search his
room. He was sleeping like a dead man and I knew I was safe. It
was a long while, however, before I could find his keys for he
was carrying them in a belt round his body. I wanted to get them,
for the lock on his trunk was a Yale and difficult to pick. I
opened his trunk quickly and made a thorough search "&mdash;a
note of triumph came into his voice&mdash;"and what do you think
I found?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "It is not fair to ask me"&mdash;he
looked at his watch&mdash;"and you are wasting time."</p>

<p>"Two old bracelets of beaten gold with the Thralldom arms upon
them and a gold crucifix," exclaimed Croupin excitedly, "tied up
in some shaving paper and a handkerchief, and stuffed in a pair
of slippers at the very bottom of the trunk, also a big overall
and a jacket that smelt horribly of earth, wrapped round in
newspaper many times."</p>

<p>"So, he'd found a way down into the vaults, had he?" commented
Larose. "Go on, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Well, after that," went on Croupin, "I let nothing escape me,
and I watched William as a cat does a mouse. Night after night, I
sat up in a hard chair with my ear close to the door and with no
shoes on, and never allowed myself to go to sleep until well
after three o'clock. But nothing happened until last night," he
heaved a great sigh of relief, "and that is why I am so pleased
to have you now."</p>

<p>"Go on, Monsieur," said Larose again. "Quick, come to the
point."</p>

<p>"Well, last night just before twelve," said Croupin, "I heard
a movement in his room, but he was too quick for me and when I
followed into the passage, I could not see which way he had gone.
I wondered if it was to the chapel and crept round the many
corners and down the long corridors until I came there. The
chapel door was shut but the key was outside, in the lock, and I
saw it was not turned. I waited a moment and then went in. Then,
as everything was silent, I ventured to flash my torch, but the
chapel was all empty except for a big rat which darted from under
the organ and ran straight across the floor. I was in despair and
raced up to William's room to see if he was really gone. I risked
everything and opened his door. Yes, he had gone and his bed had
not been slept in."</p>

<p>Croupin looked the very picture of despondency as if he were
experiencing all over again the disappointment he had received
then. Soon, however, his face brightened.</p>

<p>"But suddenly the idea came to me that if I could not find out
where William had gone, I could at least find out from whence he
was going to return. I would stretch black cotton across all the
passages and as he broke it coming back, it would be as plain as
footsteps in the sand. I almost laughed with joy and then I was
in despair again. It was after midnight and I had no black
cotton."</p>

<p>Croupin paused dramatically and the detective did not speak.
He judged it best to let him take his time.</p>

<p>Croupin continued. "Then I did something that I have never
done in all my life before and I did it in great fear." He looked
very troubled. "I went into a young girl's room when she was
sleeping and she might have wakened and thought I was a bad man.
It was Bertha's room I went into. She is the sewing maid, and I
knew I should find cotton there." He looked interrogatively at
Larose. "You remember Bertha? She is the little dark one whose
figure I saw you admiring this afternoon when she was pouring out
the tea. She is very pretty with those dark eyes and long lashes
of hers, and I do not wonder that you were looking
at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The detective got rather red. "Go on, Monsieur," he
interrupted testily. "You are too imaginative in your
observations and we shall be here all night."</p>

<p>Croupin grinned. "Well, I went to her door and found it
locked, as I expected, but I had a few things ready in my pocket
that I had thought I might want when I was intending to follow
William, and I knew I could soon make short work of that. I
listened and heard no sound and so quickly had the door opened.
Then I crept in." He spoke very softly now. "The moon was shining
on her as she slept and everything was plain. Her dark head was
on the pillow, her neck was open and her bosom rose and fell. I
stopped for one moment and my heart was in my mouth for she
looked so beautiful and I thought of the husband she would one
day have. Then suddenly she turned upon her back and oh! she
commenced to snore!" He threw out his hands in horror. "I just
grabbed up the cotton from the work-basket and got as quickly as
I could from the room."</p>

<p>"She didn't hear you at all?" frowned Larose, who, from the
expression on his face, had been getting restive at this part of
the recital.</p>

<p>"No, she did not wake and I ran to the kitchen and made a
little piece of dough. Then, I stuck the cotton with it, across
all the passages and went back to my room to wait until it was
light. William came back just after three, and in the morning,"
the Frenchman made one of his irritating pauses here, "I found
all the cottons broken in all the corridors leading to the chapel
and so I knew where he had been."</p>

<p>"Good!" remarked the detective, "a fine piece of work!"</p>

<p>"But that is not all," went on Croupin quickly, "for again I
took another risk. Just before the family had finished lunch,
when I hoped everyone would be out of the way, I left my kitchen
and ran into the chapel, for during the morning I had been seized
with an idea. It was associated with that big rat that I
mentioned had rushed out when I flashed my torch round the
chapel. I remembered it had run straight to one place in the
wainscoting where there was no possible cover for it, and for two
or three seconds perhaps, it had run backwards and forwards
there, as if looking for some opening that it could not find.
Now, as I have told you there are no rats in our part of the
castle and therefore I knew it had come up from the dungeons and
had certainly got in when William had opened the secret door that
he must have found. So, when I disturbed it, I argued to myself
that it had run where it had, to try and get back to its home by
the way it had come."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" exclaimed Larose nodding his head. "A piece of
good reasoning."</p>

<p>"Well," smiled Croupin, gratified at the compliment, "I
examined that part of the wall to where it had run. It was oak
panelling and black with age. I tapped it everywhere but could
get no hollow sounds. Then I held a lighted match low down where
the panel reached the stone flags of the chapel floor
and"&mdash;he rubbed his hand delightedly&mdash;"there was a
draught blowing and immediately my match went out."</p>

<p>"Excellent again!" exclaimed Larose.</p>

<p>"Then," said Croupin, "I began pulling and pushing at the
panels, and almost before I knew what had happened"&mdash;he
could hardly speak in his excitement&mdash;"a panel slipped to
one side, there was a gush of air, and an opening, big enough to
admit a man, gaped before my eyes."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment as if quite exhausted and then added
quietly. "And that is the end of my story. Monsieur Larose."</p>

<p>"You didn't go down?" asked the detective. "You made no
attempt to see where it led to?"</p>

<p>Croupin threw out his bands. "How could I?" he exclaimed. "It
was only this afternoon that I found it."</p>

<p>Larose regarded him frowningly. "But how does this help us to
link up the footman with the man who was out on the marshes that
night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It helps us a great deal," replied Croupin quickly, "for it
is common talk that there is a passage from the dungeons leading
under the moat to somewhere on the castle lands. The tradesmen
who come to the door have talked about it to us, and a guest at
the lord's table, a Captain Bonnett, asked about it at dinner the
other night. James told us the lord was very angry and said it
was all nonsense, but"&mdash;he shrugged his
shoulders&mdash;"everyone believes it, although no one knows
where the entrance is, outside." His voice rose in excitement.
"But I will find it, now I know of that panel that slides back in
the chapel."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Larose emphatically, "you must not take it on
by yourself." He held up his hand. "Now wait a minute. I want to
think."</p>

<p>The Frenchman lit a cigarette and Larose, looking out into the
darkness, sat biting at his lip in his perplexity. So another
supposed madman had come upon the scene and there must be madness
in the very air about Thralldom! What was he to do, with these
three trails to follow&mdash;the footman's&mdash;the bailiff's
and the butcher's from Halesworth?</p>

<p>A long silence ensued and then the detective spoke as if he
had at last made up his mind.</p>

<p>"Croupin, my boy," he said, and he laughed good-humouredly,
"you're not quite a prize-packet for a Sunday school, and I'm
quite sure that our mutual friend, Mr. Jones, does not think too
much of you at any time, still&mdash;" and he pretended to heave
a great sigh&mdash;"we'll have to go into partnership, you and I,
and work out this puzzle together." He pointed into the darkness
in the direction of the marshes and spoke very sternly. "And it
is not one death only we shall have to consider, but four, for
three men and one woman, I am thinking died bloody deaths within
one mile of where we now are."</p>

<p>Then very briefly but omitting no material facts, he told
Raphael Croupin about his mission from Scotland Yard and how far
his discoveries had led him.</p>

<p>The Frenchman listened wide-eyed in horror, but with the
recital over, snapped his fingers exultingly together.</p>

<p>"We will find him, you and I," he exclaimed, "whether it be
William or some one else. He will be a cunning fox that will hide
his tracks when we are hunting together." He suddenly remembered
something and his face fell. "But about Meester Jones, what shall
we tell him?"</p>

<p>"Not much," replied Larose grimly, "and we can leave
<i>you</i> out, anyhow." He smiled. "We will solve his problem
for him and give it him as a present."</p>

<p>"But one moment," exclaimed Croupin quickly. "There are yet
some things going on in that castle that we must understand,
although I think they have nothing to do with William." He spoke
very impressively. "Now, two men who are staying at a house on
the beach here come up to the castle almost every day and I have
my suspicions about them. One is a man called Hudson who is from
America, and sells pictures there. He is clever and is great
friends with the lord, because he praises that Rubens so much.
The butler and James say he agrees with everything the lord says,
to please him. I have only seen him once, but he looks to me like
a man who would not waste his time so&mdash;for nothing. The
other man is his servant and is called Thompson and he gives
massage to Lady Deering. He has had refreshments many times with
us, in our hall, and he is always asking questions about
everything."</p>

<p>"What sort of questions?" asked Larose frowning.</p>

<p>"Oh! why the windows have such big bolts, and why the doors
are so thick and where we all sleep. He asks what we are afraid
of, and who sets the alarms, and isn't it a business to always
remember to turn them off in the mornings." Croupin nodded his
head significantly. "But I notice he does not ask questions now
when I am there. He does not like me, and he watches me. He says
he is this Hudson's body servant but"&mdash;and the Frenchman
laughed slyly&mdash;"he has more, to me, of the air of a man I
would give work to if I were wanting to open a safe."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Larose. "I have heard of them. Our friend
Jones is interested in them too."</p>

<p>"Then a third man," went on Croupin, "and he is this Captain
Bonnett who is staying at the castle as a visitor. He is an
unpleasant fellow. He wants that beautiful Ann, but she does not
want him." An eager note came into his voice. "You have seen Ann?
Ah! you do not know. Well, she is like an angel. She has a figure
better even than Bertha's. She has eyes that are pools of love.
She has a mouth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do, that'll do," interrupted Larose sharply. "Now,
what about this Bonnett man?"</p>

<p>"He knows more about Hudson than he makes out," replied
Croupin, "and secret signs pass between them when the lord is not
looking. James has caught them at it. And the servant, Thompson,
sneers at Bonnett as if they were familiar and did not like each
other." He shook his head. "They look like a gang to me and are
up there for something."</p>

<p>"But this captain is a visitor there, you tell me," said
Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, but the servants say he is a bad lot. He has no money
and there is much talk about him. He has been warned off the
turf."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind him for the present," said Larose, "for he's
not likely to be the man we want, and we've something much more
important to think about." He rose to his feet. "Now, off you go,
quick, and do nothing in the castle for the moment, except keep
watch. There's too much at stake for you to work alone. Can you
get out and meet me anywhere to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"My afternoons are always free," replied Croupin. "Make it
here, at four o'clock."</p>

<p>"Good," said Larose, "and by then I'll have thought out some
plan." He gripped the Frenchman by the arm. "It's in my mind,
Monsieur, that you'll have to get me into that castle one night,
without anyone seeing me, and open that secret door."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" exclaimed Croupin, "but it is impossible. The castle
is all bolts and bars."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; THE MYSTERY OF THE MOAT</h2>

<p class="first">HALF an hour after he had parted with Croupin,
Larose was sitting just inside the corner of the small plantation
where Naughton Jones had described to him the finding of the
missing Sam Baxter's blood-stained cap.</p>

<p>The night was misty and vapour was rising from the marshes.
There was a faint moon showing, but every now and then, it was
obscured by the clouds.</p>

<p>The detective had placed his folded mackintosh under him, for
the ground was very damp. He had a small pair of binoculars in
his hand, and from time to time, he lifted them to his eyes and
searched the marshlands round. He was only about three hundred
yards distant from Thralldom Castle, but could not see where its
mighty walls sprang from the ground, because of the mist. He was
frowning thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Now it is incredible," he whispered, "but it must be we are
dealing with a maniac, and as I surmise that all four of these
people were murdered in this locality, and am certain that two of
them were killed, actually within a few yards of where I am now
sitting, it must be, again, that this is the particular place
which he haunts." He nodded his head. "So if I am patient and
come here every night about this time when there is a moon
showing, sooner or later, I shall catch him and lay him by the
heels, whether he be that butcher, the footman, or the bailiff,
risen from the dead."</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on. "Croupin told a very straightforward tale
and he is a shrewd fellow and can be relied upon. He is very
observant and misses nothing." He lifted his glasses and swept
them round in every direction. "Now according to him it was just
such a night as this when the bailiff was killed. A fitful moon,
hidden every other minute by the clouds and a heavy mist rising
from the marshes. So, if this madman is looking for another
victim, everything is propitious for him to be prowling about
now. Nothing could be more in his favour for&mdash;&mdash;" But
he suddenly became aware of a faint rustle behind him and he
jerked up his head, in doubt as to whether it was only a rustle
of the wind.</p>

<p>Now in after-days, it was always a bitter memory to Larose
that he had not been quite quick enough that night, when he sat
watching upon the marshes of Thralldom, for, hitherto, it had
been the obsession of his life that he was always alert and
ready, and that in moments of danger or uncertainty his hand
would slip to the safety catch of his automatic as quickly as
that of any man in the world.</p>

<p>But that night, at any rate, he was caught napping and, for
just the fraction of a second, he waited too long. And this
fraction of a second proved nearly fatal to him, for, the thought
of possible danger at last avalanching itself upon him, he was
springing to his feet, when he felt, rather than heard, the swish
of something passing close by his head.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, it almost missed him altogether. It missed
his head but fell with a glancing blow upon the extreme edge of
his shoulder, and he felt a pull as if someone were tearing at
his jacket there, as some weapon hurtled forward and slapped on
to the ground.</p>

<p>It had not hurt him in the least, but it had unbalanced him,
and the next second, before he could recover himself, he was
gripped fiercely by the back of his neck, and almost lifted off
his feet by a hand of steel, was forced down until his face was
pressing into the moist earth. Then he heard heavy, stertorous
breathing, and from the movements of his assailant, it seemed as
if the latter were groping with his free hand for the weapon that
had slipped from his grasp.</p>

<p>The grip on the detective's neck was agonising, and a feeling
of faintness surging through him, he realised that he was losing
consciousness, but with a last despairing effort, he struck a
spasmodic blow behind him with the binoculars that he was still
gripping in his hand.</p>

<p>He felt them strike something and then, to his immense relief,
his neck was instantly released. He heard a deep gasp, a groan of
pain, and then complete silence reigned.</p>

<p>For perhaps ten second he lay on exactly where he had fallen.
Then, with shaky movements, he sat up and drew in a deep breath.
He could not think coherently, and it felt as if his neck were
dislocated, but the feeling of faintness had passed.</p>

<p>The moon was behind a cloud and the darkness was complete.</p>

<p>Gradually, at first, but then very quickly, he regained his
senses and he scowled with rage at the poor figure he had cut. He
had missed the chance of a lifetime, he told himself. He had let
everything slip from him when he had almost had the assassin
actually under his very hands.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, the miracle of his escape came to him, and
galvanised into activity by the possible danger that might be
still threatening, with many grimaces of pain, he crawled, with
what speed he could, until he was a good twenty yards and more
distant from the spot where he had so narrowly escaped
disaster.</p>

<p>"I won't be caught napping again," he scowled, gritting his
teeth, "and maybe, I have not finished with him yet. When that
cloud passes I may get another chance. The brute may be still
about, for probably, I've winded him. I must not forget, however,
that if it's dark for both of us, he knows the place better than
I do and is fighting upon his own ground," and he sat on as if
carved in stone, straining his ears into the darkness, with his
finger upon the trigger of his automatic.</p>

<p>One, two, five minutes passed, and still the moon was hidden.
Then all at once the cloud passed, and everything was flooded in
a ghostly light.</p>

<p>Holding his breath in his excitement, he darted his eyes round
and round in every direction, but for a few moments could
perceive no movement anywhere. Then suddenly, about a hundred
yards away a shadow seemed to rise up from the ground and started
to glide slowly along by the edge of the plantation.</p>

<p>It was not near enough for the detective to use his automatic
effectively, and added to that, he was not minded to disclose his
own whereabouts, but he sprang to his feet and bending down so
that his body was almost doubled, darted after the shadow.</p>

<p>But the owner of the shadow, glancing back over his shoulder,
apparently at once became aware that he was being followed, and
changing his direction instantly, he accelerated his pace and
sped furiously down the slope, towards the deep belt of mist that
was enveloping the base of the castle.</p>

<p>All his pains forgotten in his eagerness, Larose raced after
him, but then, when he judged he could be only about seventy or
eighty yards from the moat, the mist swallowed up the shadow and
it was gone.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" swore the detective and he, too, plunged into the
mist, but he pulled himself up short after a few strides and with
his electric torch in one hand and his automatic held hip-high in
the other, stood stock still, hoping that his enemy would betray
his whereabouts by some sound.</p>

<p>"He can't get far away," he whispered, "for we are right by
the moat now, and as there's every probability he's not got a
gun, things are distinctly in my favour, if he doesn't hear
me."</p>

<p>A long minute went by in the ghostly silence and with the
sweat dripping from his forehead, the detective was yet chilled
to the bone by the icy vapour rising off the moat.</p>

<p>"A devilish unhealthy place," he muttered, "and I wonder they
don't all get ague in this castle." Then finding the inaction
intolerable, he moved forward stealthily, step by step, until his
hand came in contact with the wire fence encircling the moat. He
rested the hand holding the torch upon the uppermost strand of
the wire and then&mdash;his heart began to beat furiously.</p>

<p>He had felt the wire vibrating, as if someone else were
touching it and perhaps, feeling his way along by its help.</p>

<p>A long time now passed, hours it seemed to the detective,
although he knew it could be only a matter of minutes. Then,
suddenly, the wire was pulled taut, it oscillated violently, and
a tremendous splash came from the moat&mdash;a splash as of some
big body plunging in.</p>

<p>Larose darted forward in the direction of the splash, and
risking everything now, flashed his powerful torch upon the black
waters. They were rolling up in small waves against the bank,
thousands of bubbles were rising to the surface and across the
moat a huge eddy was spreading in ever-widening circles.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" gasped Larose, "he's jumped in!" and just
beyond the rays of his torch, he fancied he could make out a dark
shape moving under the water.</p>

<p>The waves died down, the bubbles ceased to rise and the eddies
all faded away.</p>

<p>"The luck's been all with him," snarled the detective, "and
he's escaped me now."</p>

<p>But for several minutes he ran up and down and along the wire
fencing all round the moat, flashing his torch in all directions
across the water and straining his eyes everywhere, in the hope
of catching sight of the swimmer pulling himself up on the
opposite bank. But he saw nothing, and he heard nothing, and
gloom and silence surrounded him on every side.</p>

<p>"Now, was it that butcher?" he asked himself breathlessly,
"and has he climbed out of the moat somewhere, and slipped off to
where he's hidden his car? That shadow might easily have been his
and that grip on my neck"&mdash;he felt it tenderly with his
hand&mdash;"was just the grip of a man who could have felled an
ox." He frowned thoughtfully. "But he was out of condition. His
breathing was very hard."</p>

<p>He shivered violently. "Now, quick back to the inn and I'll
ring up Halesworth and then have a hot bath."</p>

<p>He set off at a sharp run away from the castle, but very soon
began to slow down, for his neck was hurting and he was hampered
by having to hold it to one side, finding that, the least
uncomfortable position.</p>

<p>And then, all in a moment, the excitement of the manhunt again
surged through him. He threw off his pains in a lightning flash,
and like a plummet, dropped into the ditch that bounded the
meadow along which he had been running.</p>

<p>He had caught sight of a dark figure coming up stealthily
behind him.</p>

<p>It was only by chance that he had seen him, and he swore
angrily at his own carelessness. He had happened to glance back
to see how far he had come from the castle and then to his
amazement had become aware that he was being followed.</p>

<p>That the man who was now trailing him was his adversary of not
half an hour ago, he was quite sure. It was true he had had only
the briefest glimpse of his would-be murderer then, but the
figures of the two were identical, except that now this man
behind him appeared to be of less bulky build, which would
naturally be accounted for, he told himself, by the saturated
condition of his clothes which would be clinging to him.</p>

<p>"He's mad, right enough," panted the detective, "quite mad,
for no one but a madman would dare to make a second attempt and
right out in the open this time. Well, we're pretty clear of the
mist here, and he has no chance of escaping as long as the moon
does not go in."</p>

<p>He raised himself up cautiously to look across the meadow but,
to his dismay, could now see no sign of his pursuer, and so,
after a moment's consideration, he started to crawl back along
the bottom of the ditch.</p>

<p>"I'll get behind him," he muttered, "and I'll shoot on sight.
But I'll shoot him in the legs."</p>

<p>A hundred yards of laborious crawling, looking up every ten
yards or so but seeing no sign of his enemy, brought the
detective at last to the end of the ditch. Then he slowly
straightened himself, inch by inch, until his eyes were level
with the grass upon the meadow and&mdash;his heart gave a great
bound.</p>

<p>Not thirty paces away from him, a man was crouching behind a
bush.</p>

<p>The man was crouching, perfectly still, but from his attitude
he was in every way as much upon the alert as the detective. He
was apparently, however, keeping watch in the other
direction.</p>

<p>A thrill of exultant joy surged through Larose for he felt
that by his strategy he was now atoning for his failure earlier
in the night.</p>

<p>"But a little too far off for a shot," he whispered with his
raised automatic before him, "and I don't like to risk it, for
it's his legs I want."</p>

<p>And then came a quiet voice, close behind him. "Don't shoot,
please, Mr. Larose, I paid three guineas for that coat and it's
still serviceable, also that cap is an old favourite of
mine."</p>

<p>Larose almost jumped out of his skin and, jerking himself
round, thanked Heaven that the shadows hid the shame and
mortification in his face.</p>

<p>It was Naughton Jones who was speaking and it was his coat and
cap only that were hanging upon the bush.</p>

<p>"Oh! that's you, is it, Mr. Jones?" the detective replied
carelessly, and repressing his rage with a tremendous effort. "I
was ready for whoever it might have been." He spoke as if with
some concern. "But you will be catching cold without your
coat."</p>

<p>The great investigator was by no means a romantic sight. He
was minus cap and coat and his long lanky figure, now stripped
almost bare, was skeleton-like in its proportions. But his manner
was just as pompous and pedantic as ever.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" he commented judicially. "You have, certainly, a
most wonderful gift of recovery, Mr. Larose. I must have startled
you pretty considerably, and yet there is no trace of emotion now
in your voice." He sighed and went on with a great affectation of
humility. "But I do not come out of it too well myself, for I
have been trailing you for the last half mile, thinking you were
that man Rawlings. Your stoop and style of walking were not your
natural ones." He looked curiously at him. "But what's the matter
with your neck?"</p>

<p>"I have had fingers on it that I do not want to feel again,"
replied Larose grimly, "and it was a near thing that I was not
killed, too, by that plantation where you found Baxter's cap."
And then he proceeded to relate to Naughton Jones everything that
had happened.</p>

<p>Jones listened without any comment until he had finished and
then remarked: "Rawlings, of course. There cannot be the shadow
of a doubt about it. He has got a hiding place somewhere upon the
Thralldom lands. He is a tall man, just six feet, but stoops a
lot. He is of great strength, and in his youth was a noted
swimmer. You will find, if you enquire, that until a few years
ago, he used to dive off the end of Minsmere jetting every
morning, winter and summer, and he could stay under water for so
long that strangers, observing his display, often began to think
that he was drowned."</p>

<p>"But where is he hiding then?" demanded Larose, without the
slightest belief, however, in Jones's statement, and yet curious
to find out what the latter's ideas might be. "He must come out
to eat and drink."</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied Jones sharply, "and that is what we have to
find out. I've got my eye upon that ruined Priory, but I have had
no luck there yet." He appeared to remember something. "Yes, and
there's something more that interests me now. You remember I
mentioned to you this afternoon those three queer birds who are
staying at that house upon the foreshore. Well, one of them, the
individual who goes under the name of Martin Fenner, has been
nosing round here upon these meadows to-night. I've seen him
three times, and he spent quite half an hour in that old hut by
the marsh road." The great investigator spoke very sternly. "I'm
half inclined to call upon him tomorrow morning and ask him what
he means by it."</p>

<p>Larose shivered. "But I must be getting home," he said. "I'm
wet through and want a hot bath."</p>

<p>"Good," commented Jones, "I'll walk with you, when I've picked
up my bicycle which is hidden in that long grass over there, and
you can be telling me what Lord Thralldom said to you this
afternoon as we go along." He tossed his head. "Not that it will
alter my opinion in any way for I am convinced that Rawlings is
our man."</p>

<p>"Oh! but my neck's sore!" exclaimed Larose. "The wretch had
fingers like steel claws."</p>

<p>Jones stopped and flashed his torch. "Let me have a look at
it. I'm as good as a medical man." He handled the detective very
gently and then pronounced his opinion. "It's only a bruise, and
there are no nail marks, and the skin is not even broken." He
spoke thoughtfully. "It seems that Rawlings must have been
wearing gloves, and you're fortunate, for his dirty finger nails
might easily have given you a septic wound."</p>

<p>They parted at the inn and Larose found the landlord waiting
up for him. A telephone call had come for him, the man said, but
the caller had left no message and had rung off without giving
his name. Larose immediately then rang up the Halesworth police
station and the inspector himself answered the call. Yes, the
butcher had driven out in his car at 9.42 with the proper number
plates on and and had gone as they had expected in the direction
of Yoxford. He, the inspector, had at once warned the plain-clothes officer waiting at Darsham that the butcher was on the
road and the officer had immediately set out to meet him. But he
had not succeeded in getting in touch with him although, for an
hour and a half and more he had patrolled the Halesworth-Darsham
Road. Finally, at 11.32 he had returned to Halesworth to report
his non-success. Three minutes later, then, Turnbull had driven
up the road and turned into his yard. The Inspector was very
annoyed and would like to see Larose on the morrow to make
further plans.</p>

<p>It was a long while before the detective dropped off to sleep
that night. His neck was hurting him and he was very troubled in
his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a madman, right enough, who is haunting these
marshes," he said, "and that I have been in actual contact with
him, I can be quite sure, but that he is not Rawlings I am
equally as sure. Rawlings is dead, and Croupin's testimony upon
that point, seems to me, conclusive. Then, in that case, who is
the man whose mind has given way? It may, of course, be this
William, but for the moment there is only the very faintest
suspicion in his direction and, indeed, until it is strengthened
by further discoveries, it is of no value at all, except for
inclining us to look pretty closely into all that gentleman's
activities." He shook his head. "Still, William is worth looking
after, apart from the idea of Croupin that he was walking like
that man did in the mist, because the very fact that he now has
access to the dungeons, suggests that he, of all others, may have
come upon that passage under the moat and so is able to go to and
fro upon the Thralldom lands at night, whenever he will." He
thought for a long while. "Well, what about the butcher? It is
most unfortunate he was not picked up to-night, for it leaves us
exactly in the position we were in before, except of course that
we know he was abroad upon one of his mysterious expeditions and
seen to be proceeding in this direction during the very hour when
I was attacked. As for his carrying his correct number plates
when he started out, I think nothing of that. Of course he would
always do that, and only change into the false ones when he was
parking his car somewhere, preparatory to patrolling these
marshes."</p>

<p>He rubbed his neck tenderly to ease the pain. "So, I'll go up
to the castle to-day, on the chance of setting eyes on this
William and to have another talk with Lord Thralldom at the same
time. I'll tell his lordship what happened to-night and upon the
way in which he receives my news, will depend what confidences I
shall give him. If he does not take a serious view of the matter,
which somehow I am inclined to think will be his attitude, I
won't tell him anything about his footman, but will then just
trust wholly to Croupin's resource to get me into the castle, so
that I can make some investigations upon my own."</p>

<p>He laughed to himself. "As for the great Jones, well, he is so
certain about Rawlings that it would be a pity to unsettle his
mind, at any rate, for the present."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE MORNING AFTER</h2>

<p class="first">A FEW minutes after ten the next morning, Larose
set off at a good pace to walk to the castle. It was a lovely
morning, and he thought the exercise would do him good. He was
not feeling much the worse for his adventure of the previous
night, except that his neck was very stiff and there was a big,
ugly-looking bruise where he had been gripped so forcibly by his
unknown assailant.</p>

<p>When about a mile from the castle, he saw a young girl coming
towards him and, as they approached closer, he recognised her as
the one he had seen with young Harden, the previous
afternoon.</p>

<p>"Miss Devenham, of course!" he ejaculated to himself, "and
she's almost as pretty as Croupin said, in fact, I think, she's
quite."</p>

<p>The road was lonely and as a matter of country politeness, he
lifted his hat to her as he was passing. "Besides," was his
thought, "I'd like to see her smile. A pretty girl is always
doubly worth looking at when she smiles."</p>

<p>The girl acknowledged his courtesy with a little bow and, as
he had hoped she would, with a smile as well. Then suddenly, she
stopped and to his surprise, addressed him.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she said, in a voice like a silver bell,
"but are you not the gentleman who gave Mr. Harden a lift
yesterday afternoon?" and when the detective had smilingly
admitted that he was, she added, "And did he by any chance leave
a book in your car?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "Not that I know of," he replied. "I
remember, however, that he had got a small parcel with him."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "but there should have been three books in it
and there were only two. He had dropped one somewhere and he
thought perhaps it might have been in your car."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll look for it when I get back," replied Larose, "and
if I find it, I'll send it up to you. You are Miss Devenham, are
you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the girl replied, "and you are Mr. Larose from Scotland
Yard. You are going up to see my uncle again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I want to see him for a few minutes and I hope he won't
mind."</p>

<p>She looked a little doubtful. "I don't think he's up yet. At
any rate he wasn't half an hour ago. Some days," she explained,
"when he's not feeling too well, he breakfasts in his room."</p>

<p>"Well, I can enquire," said Larose, "and if he can't see me
this morning, I'll have to come back this afternoon."</p>

<p>The girl hesitated a moment and then spoke very quickly. "But
it's very dreadful about Mr. Rawlings, is it not? And I'm so
sorry for his wife." She frowned prettily. "Do you think there's
any chance that he's still alive?"</p>

<p>"It's very hard to say," replied the detective. "The whole
business is very mysterious." He regarded her thoughtfully. "Of
course, you knew Mr. Rawlings?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes!" she replied. "He and I were good friends. I am
interested in Botany and he used to collect wild flowers for
me."</p>

<p>"What kind of man did you think he was," said Larose, "that
is, if you don't mind my asking you?" He bowed. "You see, Miss
Devenham, I ask you because I always think a woman is so often a
much better judge of character than a man. She doesn't
necessarily reason, but she blunders on to the truth
somehow."</p>

<p>The girl pretended to look indignant. "She doesn't blunder at
all, Mr. Larose, but she can generally tell at a glance what sort
of person a man is." She smiled. "I wouldn't be talking to you
here, now, if I didn't think you were quite nice, although you
are a detective."</p>

<p>Larose smiled back at the compliment. "Well, what sort of a
man was Mr. Rawlings then?" he asked. "Was he nice too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite nice," was the reply. "He was quiet and reserved,
but a very high-principled man. I have many times heard my uncle
say he was the best servant he had ever had."</p>

<p>"I expect he misses him, then," suggested Larose.</p>

<p>"Very much," she replied. She looked troubled. "But I think as
people grow old, Mr. Larose, they are not quite as sympathetic as
they used to be. Uncle is seventy-five, and he seems to take the
loss of Mr. Rawlings quite as a matter of course, and it's rather
sad." She shook her head slowly. "His only anxiety now, seems to
be for his paintings, and from time to time, they are a great
worry to him. One day he is sure people have been watching round
the castle all night, but the next, he forgets that, and has a
new idea that thieves are coming up hidden in the tradesmen's
vans."</p>

<p>"It must be very trying for all of you," said Larose
sympathetically. "Now one question more, if you'll forgive me. Is
it likely, do you think, that Mr. Rawlings did fall over those
cliffs?"</p>

<p>"Not at all likely," she replied instantly. "He'd lived all
his life here and knew quite well where the cliffs are dangerous.
Besides, what should he have been doing upon the cliffs, more
than a mile away from his home at that time of night?" She looked
scornful. "I have always thought that suggestion ridiculous."</p>

<p>They chatted for a minute or two longer and then the girl
looked at her wrist watch and with a smiling goodbye, turned to
walk on. "And you won't forget to look for my book, will you?"
she called out, glancing back over her shoulder. She blushed
prettily. "It has my name in it, 'Ann Devenham'."</p>

<p>"A very charming young woman," remarked Larose as he walked
on, "and quite a shrewd one, too. She's certainly given me some
things to think about and one, that uncle of hers is a selfish
and callous old man."</p>

<p>Arriving at the castle bridge, he paused before passing over
and allowed his eyes to rove round upon the moat. "Now, that's
about where he jumped in," he said thoughtfully, "for I remember
that tower was right above me when I flashed my torch."</p>

<p>He looked meditatively at the wire fence over which his
adversary of the previous night had flung himself to gain the
sanctuary of the water. It was stout and strong, and pinned down
at the bottom, along its whole length, by large pieces of rocks
that had been laid down methodically at regular intervals. They
had evidently been placed there to keep the wires from lifting up
should cattle or sheep stray up against them.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he gave a sharp exclamation, for he had become aware
that the even row was broken and there was a gap where one of the
rocks should obviously have been.</p>

<p>He ran quickly down to the moat side and bending down over the
ground, uttered a cry that he had difficulty in stifling.</p>

<p>The missing rock had been only very recently removed for the
edges of its bed were sharp and clear.</p>

<p>He clenched his hands together fiercely. "Oh! what a fool!
What an abject fool I was!" he groaned. "Of course the wretch
threw this rock over to make me believe he'd jumped in and then
when I was dancing about, staring at the ripples it had made, he
got away. He took in the large size of the hole left in the
ground. But, by James, he must be a strong man to have been able
to lift a rock like that, and no wonder I was helpless when he'd
gripped me by the neck."</p>

<p>In a few moments his anger had abated and he moved away with a
grim smile upon his face. "Gilbert! Gilbert!" he murmured, "and
you even thought that you saw him moving under the water."</p>

<p>Ringing the castle bell, the door was answered by a footman,
whom he knew instantly must be William.</p>

<p>The man was tall, and, of a lithe, greyhound-like build, was
quite refined in his appearance. His forehead was high and he had
a good-shaped nose, but his complexion was dead white and he had
dark eyes of a peculiarly constricted shape. His mouth was
straight and he held his lips pressed tightly together.
Altogether he was not unhandsome but his expression was stealthy
and not pleasing, and his eyes suggested that he would be always
watching what other people did.</p>

<p>He subjected Larose to a hard scrutiny.</p>

<p>The detective asked to see Lord Thralldom, adding that he had
called the previous afternoon and was an officer from Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p>The footman's face betrayed no interest. "I'll tell him, sir,"
he said, and he took Larose into a small room just off the
entrance hall and retired noiselessly, closing the door behind
him.</p>

<p>"So that is William," thought Larose, "and he would just fit
the bill everywhere we want him to. He's crafty and secretive if
ever I saw anyone that was, and the expression of those eyes is
not normal, but he's capable and determined and that forehead of
his means that he can think and plan." He stroked his neck
gingerly. "Well, this afternoon Croupin will tell me whether the
gentleman went out of his room again last night."</p>

<p>The detective was not kept waiting very long, for the footman
speedily returned.</p>

<p>"His lordship will see you, sir," he said, "if you will follow
me," and he led the way up a broad flight of stairs, to the door
of a room upon the first floor.</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled Larose softly to himself, "the castle may be
hundreds of years old, but everything in this part is new, and no
expense has been spared either."</p>

<p>The room the detective was ushered into was very large. It was
comfortably furnished with every modern convenience and the only
antique thing was a huge four-poster bed with a high canopy at
the far end.</p>

<p>"The dickens!" thought Larose, "and I suppose then, that that
is the great ancestral bed upon which long generations of the
Thralldoms have been born."</p>

<p>The owner of the castle was sitting up in the bed wearing a
dressing-gown of cardinal red, but clad even as he was, he had
evidently no intention that anyone should forget he was the great
lord of Thralldom, and he glared now out of his fierce eyes, as a
man accustomed to regard only his inferiors.</p>

<p>"So you've come to trouble me again, have you?" he said
instantly, in commanding tones, and giving the detective no time
to speak first.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, your lordship," replied Larose in as
conciliatory a manner as possible, "but I have an important
communication to make to you, and when you have heard what I have
to say, I am sure you will excuse me."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" came the sharp reply. "What is the
communication?"</p>

<p>"I should like to make it to your lordship alone," replied
Larose with a glance in the direction of the footman who was
standing motionless and seemingly uninterested, by the
bedside.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom lowered his eyebrows frowningly, and then
nodded to the footman. "You can go, William," he said, and when
the man had left the room he repeated his enquiry with some
irritation.</p>

<p>"I regret to have to inform you, my lord," began Larose, "but
I have every reason to believe that your bailiff was murdered.
He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Murdered!" ejaculated Lord Thralldom incredulously. "Then you
have found the body?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the detective, "I have only evidence, so far,
that it is probable he met with foul play, for a few minutes
after the time when it is known he left his home that night, a
cry was heard upon the marshes and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A cry!" exclaimed Lord Thralldom interrupting again. He
looked scornful. "Why, that's nothing. Plenty of cries are heard
upon the marshes at night. Stoats, weasels, foxes and rabbits and
many other creatures make their noises there. The hours of
darkness are never still."</p>

<p>The detective spoke very quietly. "But this was a human cry,
my lord, and a witness is prepared to come forward and state that
there were two men upon the marshes that night, and, after the
cry, one of them was carrying the other."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom's eyes were now half-closed and inclining his
head sideways, he looked in a strange and curious manner at the
detective.</p>

<p>"Oh! he is, is he?" he said slowly, and there was the
suspicion of a sneer in his voice. "Then who is this witness and
what was he himself doing upon the marshes at that time of
night?" The sneer gave place to anger and his voice rose. "He was
a trespasser on my lands."</p>

<p>"I am not prepared, for the moment, my lord," replied the
detective, "to disclose who my informant was, but I assure you
that he is a reliable person."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom straightened himself up in a grand gesture of
disdain. "Well, no matter, I don't believe a word of it," he said
emphatically. He smiled suddenly in a quite genial manner. "You
must know, sir, that upon an occasion such as this, when any
mystery presents itself, there are always people ready to come
forward and say they've seen one thing or heard another." His
voice became scornful again. "It is the opportunity of their
common lives to crawl into the limelight, and they are ready to
swear anything for purposes of publicity."</p>

<p>"But that is not all, my lord," exclaimed Larose sharply, "for
we have every reason to believe another man met a dreadful death
upon the same marshes, less than three weeks ago." He paused a
moment to let his words sink in and then continued very slowly.
"The cap of the innkeeper of Yoxford, who disappeared then, was
found near the same spot where those two men were seen, and it
was cut and bloodied, as if he too, had come to a violent
end."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom had listened as if he had not been taking in
what the detective was saying, and he now regarded him with a
puzzled stare.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Larose sternly, "and we cannot ignore the
significance of these two happenings. Each one, singly, is
suspicious, but the two together, are very damning evidence that
all is not right about here."</p>

<p>"What inn-keeper do you say?" asked Lord Thralldom finding his
voice at last.</p>

<p>"Baxter, who kept the Yoxford Arms," replied the detective.
"He's been missing now for nearly three weeks and the cap, with
his initials in it, was picked up close by the small plantation
by the marshes, not 300 yards from here."</p>

<p>"And what was he doing on my land?" burst out Lord Thralldom,
his anger flaming up again.</p>

<p>"Poaching," replied Larose, "or, at least, it is supposed he
came here after hares."</p>

<p>"And who found the cap?" went on Lord Thralldom. He scoffed.
"The same witness as before, I suppose, the one who saw the body
of my bailiff being carried away."</p>

<p>"No," replied Larose instantly, "quite a different man this
time, but one whose evidence is equally reliable." He spoke very
sternly. "But I have more, yet, to tell you, Lord Thralldom, for
there is a third happening to record that I can verify myself."
He stepped up to the bed and bending down, turned his head
sideways, so that Lord Thralldom could see his neck.</p>

<p>"Look at that bruise, my lord. I myself was attacked last
night upon the same spot and, from the ferocity of the attack,
was fortunate to have escaped with my life."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom's face was a study. His lips were parted, his
eyes were wide and staring, and his whole expression was one of
dumbfounded surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the detective, "someone sprang upon me when I
was sitting by that plantation of larches. He struck at me with
some weapon, but he missed me and then tried to choke me, when he
had got me on the ground."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom could hardly get his breath. "But it is
incredible," he gasped, "unless he were one of some gang who is
after my paintings." He hesitated a moment and then asked
hoarsely, "But what kind of man was he? Did you see his
face?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the detective, "unhappily I did not. I got out
of his clutch but he was too cunning for me, and escaped in the
mist." He went on. "And that can only mean, my lord, that some
madman is haunting these marshes at night. We can be almost
certain that he has killed two people"&mdash;he paused a
moment&mdash;"and there may be others that he has killed as
well."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom had calmed down and now spoke very quietly.
"And what were you doing, sir, by the plantation?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was watching," replied Larose, "for I had already come to
the conclusion that a madman is making a nightly round there and
that it is dangerous ground."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom meditatively regarded the detective for a
moment, and then he sighed as if he were very troubled.</p>

<p>"Show me that bruise again, please," he said and then when
Larose had complied he went on: "And now, I'll tell you what I
think it was." He seemed quite himself again, now, and smiled
grimly. "You interrupted a courting couple, sir; that is all,
and, as is not unusual at such times, the man lost his temper.
You flashed a torch, perhaps, and the man thought you were spying
upon them&mdash;with the result he tried to punish you."</p>

<p>The detective was too angry to mind his words. "Your
suggestion is childish, my lord," he said sharply, "and unless
you are wilfully refusing to face the facts, the attitude you are
taking up is not understandable. You must realise that bloody
murder has been done upon your lands and that the murderer is
still at large, and lurking somewhere, a menace to everyone who
passes by."</p>

<p>"In the hours of the night, you should add," was the stern
rejoinder, "when folks of decent character are in bed and not
trespassing, for nefarious purposes, upon other people's lands."
His whole demeanour altered suddenly and he sank back limply upon
the pillows. "But what, in any case, has it to do with me, and
how can I prevent it? I am an old man, sir, and my health is not
good"&mdash;he was almost pathetic now in his distress&mdash;"and
why do you come worrying me? You are a policeman and it is your
business to find out these things. So, please find them out and
leave me alone."</p>

<p>"But you can help me." said the detective sternly, "and it is
your duty to do so."</p>

<p>"Help you!" exclaimed Lord Thralldom piteously. "How can I
help you when I can only walk with difficulty and am a frail, old
man?"</p>

<p>"You know every part of your property?" asked the detective in
business-like tones.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom looked astounded, and was animated at once.
"Know every part of my property!" he repeated. He looked
scornful. "Every yard of it, sir, every foot." His eyes dilated.
"Why, as a boy I played in every wood and every meadow and, as a
man every part of the estate came under my supervision. I planted
those very larches even where you say you were attacked."</p>

<p>"Then where do you think any madman can be hiding?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>"Nowhere," was the instant reply. "Nowhere, when as you say,
the fellow has been hiding for weeks. It is quite impossible." He
spoke contemptuously. "There are no caves, nor caverns upon
Thralldom where a murderer could hide away and sally forth at
night as a beast of prey."</p>

<p>"But there are said to be secret hiding places, my lord," said
Larose sharply, "both in the castle and among the ruins of the
Priory as well."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom sat up with a jerk. "Kitchen talk," he sneered.
"The gossip of the scullery and the servants' hall." His eyes
glared suddenly. "But you don't seriously suggest, do you, that
anyone here in the castle is masquerading as an assassin at
night?"</p>

<p>Larose smiled as if the very idea was absurd. "But as an
officer of the law," he replied, "it is my duty to make all
enquiries about everybody and everything in a quarter where we
suspect crime has been done." He eyed Lord Thralldom intently.
"Now, my lord, is there a secret passage under the moat leading
into the castle from the Thralldom lands?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied Lord Thralldom emphatically, adding
sarcastically, "Or at least not one that is known to me or has
been known to any of my ancestors for eight hundred years."</p>

<p>"And the walled-in parts of the castle," went on the
detective, "are inaccessible to everybody?"</p>

<p>"Except to me," was the reply. "I, of course, possess a key to
the door that opens to them, but I have not unlocked it for a
number of years."</p>

<p>"And the dungeons underneath?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Can only be reached through the closed door."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment and then the detective asked:
"And your servants are quite trustworthy?"</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom nodded. "As far as I know. They all came to me
with excellent references. I saw well to that."</p>

<p>"And have they all been with you for a long time?" asked
Larose.</p>

<p>An amused chuckle came from the bed. "The longest, the butler,
for five months, and the shortest, Antoine, the chef, for five
weeks. You must understand, sir," went on Lord Thralldom "that
when I acquired my Rubens, last March, I took every conceivable
precaution that it should not be stolen. I expressly brought over
an electrician from Berlin, to do all the wiring of the alarms,
and I only employed him upon the distinct understanding that he
could not speak a word of English. Then, with his work completed,
in order that no hints as to the system of the wiring should leak
out, I got rid of all my servants at a day's notice, butler,
footmen, maids, every one of them. I made a clean sweep."</p>

<p>"And your present butler?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Came from Lord Tenterden, James from Sir Charles Saxby, and
William from the household of an old friend of mine, Professor
Dangerton, the great archaeologist." He nodded. "I was very lucky
to get William, for the professor had died only the previous
week."</p>

<p>"That was William who was here just now," said Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a most valuable servant," was the reply. "He valets
me and I have come to depend upon him for many things. He is a
most intelligent man."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom now became much more communicative, in his
manner, and all traces of his irritation having passed, he
answered with no hesitation, a number of further questions that
the detective put.</p>

<p>"But mind you," he said presently, "although I think this
notion of yours about people being killed upon my lands is all
nonsense, still," and a strange faraway look came into his eyes,
"when I shall have thought over what you tell me happened to you
last night, I admit it may be very disturbing to my peace of
mind,"&mdash;he nodded his head very solemnly&mdash;"because, for
many months it has been my considered opinion that strangers are
watching round the castle here. But they would not be madmen," he
added quickly, "far from it. They are shrewd, keen, level-headed
men, waiting to catch me unawares," his voice trailed away to a
troubled sigh, "and rob me of my Rubens."</p>

<p>Larose sighed too. "No help for me in this quarter," he
thought sadly as he rose to take his leave. "He's a cranky old
man, and to take him into my confidence would be fatal at once. I
can only depend on Croupin now, here in the castle."</p>

<p>He had another good look over the footman as the latter was
showing him out, pausing at the hall door for a short
conversation.</p>

<p>"And what do <i>you</i> make out of Mr. Rawlings's
disappearance?" he asked, coming at once to the point.</p>

<p>The man's body remained quite immovable, but his eyes, under
their half-closed lids, shifted restlessly from side to side. "I
make nothing out of it, sir," he replied quietly. "It is very
mysterious."</p>

<p>"Oh! you think it very mysterious do you?" said Larose. "Well,
is it your idea that he fell over the cliffs?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea at all, sir," was the reply, "but that seems
to be the general opinion."</p>

<p>They talked for a few minutes, but Larose could get no
satisfaction out of him. The man was ready and polite with all
his answers and most respectful, too, in his demeanour, and there
was nothing in any way to suggest that he had anything but the
most casual interest in the bailiff's disappearance. He seemed to
be merely what he purported to be&mdash;a deferential and well-trained gentleman's servant.</p>

<p>"And yet we know," ran the detective's thoughts, when finally
he was upon his way back to the inn, "that he is leading a double
life, and under that calm and unruffled exterior, is a man who
goes nightly upon his mission of theft." He started to nod his
head and then winced. "Yes, and with all his gentlemanly
appearance, only a few hours back his fingers may have been upon
my neck with all the ferocity of a wild beast." He sighed. "Well,
I have nothing much to tell Croupin this afternoon, except that I
have been nearly killed, and that by hook or by crook he must
smuggle me into the castle to-night."</p>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI. &mdash; THE VAULTS OF THRALLDOM CASTLE</h2>

<p class="first">THAT same evening, just after half past eight,
Monsieur Antoine, the amiable and very efficient chef of
Thralldom Castle, was entertaining James, the footman, in the
former's little private sanctum just off the kitchen regions. A
bottle of wine and two glasses stood upon the table before them,
and that there had been no lack of the wherewithal for good
fellowship was evidenced by an empty bottle that lay upon the
floor beside them.</p>

<p>James looked hot and red in the face, but the Frenchman was as
cool as a cucumber, and brimming over with the vivacity of his
race.</p>

<p>"But drink up, James, old boy," he said, filling up the
footman's glass. "Zere is no headache in a whole bottle of zis."
He poked his companion in the ribs. "But it is good that I have a
key of ze cellar for I am good judge of wine."</p>

<p>The footman laughed thickly. "Oh! you're a good judge, right
enough, Froggy," he exclaimed, "and not half as stingy as the
last bloke was. We could screw nothing out of him."</p>

<p>The chef patted him upon the shoulder. "But I do good service
to zis great lord of Thralldom in seeing zat you have a little of
his wine, for wine is good for ze stomach and with a good
stomach, you work better for him."</p>

<p>"You're right, Froggy," nodded the footman. "Feed me well and
I'll work well. That's my motto every time." He looked knowingly
at the chef. "But you're flash. You're all togged up to-night.
Got a date with a skirt, somewhere?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman instantly leant forward and clutched him by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Hush! hush!" he hissed sharply, "not a whisper! Not a word!"
His eyes sparkled joyfully and he put his mouth down close to the
other's ear. "Yes, I have an appointment, to-night"&mdash;he
spread himself out like a peacock&mdash;"wis a lovely girl."</p>

<p>The footman breathed heavily. "Gee! but you're lucky. What
tart is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Monsieur Antoine shook his finger playfully. "No, I not tell
you, Meester James, for I have fear of you. If my girl see you, I
not know what would happen." He poured out another glass of wine.
"But drink up, son. I must leave by nine o'clock for I meet zis
girl at nine and a quarter." He threw up his eyes. "Oh! but she
is lovely." He looked searchingly at the footman. "You have
kissed many girls?"</p>

<p>The footman's rather stupid face looked annoyed. "I've asked
plenty," he began, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Asked!" almost shrieked the Frenchman. "Oh! James, ze great
mistake." He spoke very earnestly. "Nevaire, nevaire ask a woman
for a kiss, for she have never love for a man who ask her." He
lifted up one finger impressively. "Take hold her hand, James,
and if she do not draw it away, zen you know you can kiss her,
quick, for she is all for you at once." He looked horrified. "But
ask! No, nevaire ask. It is indelicate and it offend ze modesty
of ze girl."</p>

<p>The footman looked muddled. "Oh! that's the dodge is it? Good
for you, Froggy." He blinked his eyes alcoholically. "I'll try it
next time."</p>

<p>The Frenchman took out his watch and then rose sharply to his
feet. "But see, I must not wait." He placed his hand upon his
heart. "Love calls."</p>

<p>"Lucky beggar!" grunted the footman. "Alone with a tart, to-night. I wish I was you."</p>

<p>"Now, listen, James," said the chef, and speaking now with a
sharp note of authority in his tone, "you must do exactly as I
tell you, and if you do not, not anozzer drop of wine for you as
long as I am here." He buttoned up his jacket in a business-like
way. "I am to meet zis girl at nine and a quarter, I tell you,
and if she is not zere, zen I know her mother will not let her
out and she will not come." He nodded his head emphatically. "So,
I come back at once, you understand?"</p>

<p>"All right," said the footman. "I'll let you in. I shall be at
the door all the evening."</p>

<p>"Yes, and let me in quickly, too," went on the Frenchman, "for
I shall be angry and not want to speak to anyone. I will not ring
ze bell. I will tap on ze window of your little room and mind you
be ready for me."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll be ready, Froggy," replied James, now
blinking his eyes more than ever. "I may be having a little
snooze then."</p>

<p>"And if I meet her," exclaimed the chef, raising his eyes
ecstatically, "it will be just before ten when I come in and zen
I will tap on ze window too."</p>

<p>"And don't you be later," said the footman, frowning, "for you
know old Thralldom may be starting on the prowl. What!" he went
on, "you're taking your mackintosh. What for? It's a fine night
and not going to rain."</p>

<p>"It might," said the Frenchman. He grinned delightedly and
lowered his voice. "Besides, it will come in for sitting
down."</p>

<p>James winked to the full extent that the wine he had imbibed
would allow him, and accompanying the amorous chef into the hall,
let him out of the front door.</p>

<p>"Now, mind and be ready," were the last whispered instructions
of the latter, "for I don't want ze lord to know I am out. He
complain zis morning that I go out too much, and want to know
what for. You bring your wine into your little room and finish it
zere. See, don't switch on ze lights when I come in."</p>

<p>The Frenchman gone, the footman made himself comfortable in
the small room just off the hall and had soon finished up the
wine. "And I could drink another bottle of it," was his grumbling
comment. He smiled stupidly as he sank back into a big chair.
"Still, Froggy's not a bad sort, and wouldn't old Thralldom
grouse if he knew the booze I've had."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes luxuriously, and in a few minutes his deep
snores were testifying eloquently to the potency of the wine he
had imbibed.</p>

<p>But he had not slept ten minutes, it seemed only one to him,
when his dreams were disturbed by a gentle tapping upon the
window.</p>

<p>"Let me in, James," came the sharp voice of the chef. "I am
all tears for she have not come."</p>

<p>Rising a little unsteadily to his feet, the footman tottered
to the steel grille and unlocked it. Then he fumbled for a few
moments with the catch of the big door.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick," called out the chef angrily. "I am in bad
temper for zat lovely girl have cruel mother and she would not
let her come. Do not speak to me for I am full of tears."</p>

<p>The door was opened at last and, without a word of thanks, a
mackintoshed figure, with cap well pulled down over its eyes,
darted through.</p>

<p>"Straight on to the end of the hall," it muttered in a voice
very different from that of the musical one of the chef. "Then
round to the right for about ten paces, then to the left and up
the staircase at the end of the passage, then to the left again,
and it is the fourth door on the right. Good! and I am to tread
like a cat and get under the bed."</p>

<p>The footman closed the big door and, relocking the grille,
returned to his interrupted alcoholic slumber. His head was
beginning to ache.</p>

<p>He slept for more than half an hour this time, without any
disturbance and then was awakened by a sharp pinging on the bell
within a few feet of his ear.</p>

<p>"Blast!" he exclaimed, looking hazily at the clock. "It's
nearly ten and who the blazes is ringing at this time. They're
all in, in the castle."</p>

<p>He passed through the steel grille and, approaching close to
the big door, demanded, according to his usual instructions, who
was there.</p>

<p>"It is I, booby," came the angry voice of the chef. "You have
kept me waiting and I told you not to. I tap ze window and you
not hear it, an I have to ring ze bell."</p>

<p>The footman fell back aghast. "What do you mean?" he called
out, sobered in his surprise. "It's not Antoine. You've been in
an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Open ze door, you fool," hissed the Frenchman, "and speak
softly. You'll wake all ze house."</p>

<p>"But I've let you in once already," insisted the footman. "You
said you'd not met the girl."</p>

<p>"You great fool," returned the chef. "You have been dreaming.
You have had too much to drink. I have been with ze girl all zis
time and she was lovely. I tell you about it when I am in. Open
ze door, quick."</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, James heard a movement in the hall and
turning, saw the gaunt figure and grim visage of Lord Thralldom
just behind him.</p>

<p>"Who is it, James, and what's this noise about?" asked his
lordship sternly.</p>

<p>"I thought, my lord&mdash;&mdash;" began the footman.</p>

<p>"Open ze door, James," called out the chef, his voice now
rising almost to a shout. "It is I, Antoine and if you do not
open quickly, I nevaire have you in my little room again and
nevaire give you more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's Monsieur Antoine, my lord," exclaimed the flustered
James, speaking now himself very loudly, and anxious that at all
costs his master should hear nothing about the wine. He added
spitefully, "He's very late."</p>

<p>"Open the door, then," was his lordship's command, and then
when James had complied, and the chef came tripping blithely into
the hall, the latter was pulled up in consternation at the sight
of the scowling face of the lord of the castle.</p>

<p>"And did I not, only this morning," boomed Lord Thralldom
fiercely, "express my displeasure at the many occasions upon
which you went out at night?"</p>

<p>The Frenchman was all excuses and apologies, "But it was ze
toothache, to-night, my lord," he explained volubly, "and I go to
the doctaire to have it pulled out. Look, see," and pressing a
handkerchief to his lips, he withdrew it, with the stain of blood
showing.</p>

<p>"Oh!" grunted Lord Thralldom, and he frowned as if annoyed
that there was something in the excuse.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," went on the chef, "I was in pain, and in fear
that my cooking would be spoilt."</p>

<p>"Well, don't go out at night any more for a week," grunted his
lordship again, "and don't make your Tartare sauce so thick in
future. I don't like it," and waiting until he had seen the
footman close the doors upon the bridge, he strode out of the
hall.</p>

<p>The chef made a grimace behind his back and then turned
frowningly to the footman. "But what is up with you, my son?" he
asked. "You have too much wine and got drunk. Zat is it and you
get me into trouble with ze lord."</p>

<p>James was angry, with the anger of a man with a thick head.
"I'll swear," he said huskily, "that I let you in an hour ago."
He blinked his eyes hard. "Now where's that mackintosh you went
out with?"</p>

<p>"Hush! hush!" exclaimed the chef with his eyes twinkling in
amusement. "I lend it to ze girl to cover her white dress wiz. It
show too much in the dark." He threw out his hands
disconsolately. "And I forgot to ask for it back. Nevaire mind,"
he went on. "I get it back on Sunday." He seemed suddenly to
remember something. "Oh! she want to see you, and I am to take
you wiz me next time. You will come?"</p>

<p>But the footman was not to be so easily mollified, and it was
not until Monsieur Antoine had produced two stiff liqueur
brandies from his private cupboard, that James would consent to
view things in their proper light.</p>

<p>"I was half-shickered, Froggy, that's what it was," he
explained thickly, "and my legs feel all wobbly now. Help me to
bed, old man, and I'll sleep it off."</p>

<p>The forgiving Frenchman did as he was requested, but not until
he was certain from the footman's heavy snores that the latter
was finally settled for the night, did he seek the sanctuary of
his own room.</p>

<p>"It is all right, Mr. Larose," he whispered delightedly, as
the detective crept out from under the bed, "I managed it fine,"
and he proceeded with many chuckles, to relate everything that
had happened.</p>

<p>"You are a great artist, Monsieur," commented the detective,
smilingly, "and if only you turned your talents into the right
direction, you might become as renowned as Mr. Jones."</p>

<p>Croupin screwed up his eyes. "Oh! but it was droll to see that
look on James's face, and it was difficult to persuade him that
he had been dreaming. He was most suspicious about it." He
grinned in amusement. "Really, that James is more intelligent
when he is tipsy than when he is sober." His grin broadened and
he looked slily at the detective. "And it is droll, too, that I
should now be helping a great detective from Scotland Yard to
break into a nobleman's castle."</p>

<p>Larose frowned. "It is not breaking in, Croupin, and I am here
in the interests of the law. I consider it best for all concerned
to act in this way." He brushed the matter aside. "And now we can
do nothing until after midnight, you are sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure," replied Croupin, "for it is never certain that
the lord has gone to his room until after then. He prowls up and
down the corridors; he goes and sits for an hour in the gallery
worshipping his Rubens, or else, he drags himself up on to the
battlements with some big field-glasses that he has." He nodded
his head solemnly. "I tell you, I have had some narrow escapes of
meeting him."</p>

<p>"Then why hasn't he caught William?" frowned Larose.</p>

<p>"Ah! William has privileges," was the reply, "and he can
always have the excuse that he is about to see if the lord wants
anything. He does a lot for the lord, and can be always sure when
the lord is in bed and it is safe for him to go down to the
chapel. Some nights the coast will have been clear for him soon
after ten, but it will always be clear after midnight."</p>

<p>"Where is that music coming from?" asked the detective
suddenly, lifting up his hand.</p>

<p>"It is Ann," replied Croupin, "and she is playing upon the
organ in the chapel. We are not far from the chapel here." He
paused a moment to listen. "It is a funeral dirge she is playing.
She is very sad."</p>

<p>For a little while they sat silent as the glorious strains of
the Dead March in 'Saul' came up softly to their ears, but with
the ending of the march, the music ceased.</p>

<p>"It was an omen, perhaps," sighed Croupin, "for are not we
ourselves going down among the dead? They say that twenty-three
of the lords are buried in the vaults and all of their ladies
too. Yes," he went on, turning his thoughts now back to the
music, "the beautiful Ann is very sad. She has a lover and he
came up to see her yesterday but after he had gone, the lord and
her stepmother were angry with her. The stepmother told her she
was to have no hopes of him because he was only a clerk in the
Saxmundham bank, and one day she was to marry a man of a higher
birth. James listened at the door and heard it all."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked the detective, "if I am any judge of
character, she'll have her own way whatever they say."</p>

<p>"Her stepmother is not fond of her," remarked Croupin, "and is
often angry with her. James listens a lot at the doors, I tell
you."</p>

<p>The detective was restless and kept looking at his watch. "And
you are sure," he asked, "that William is safe for the
night?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen grains of veronal again," smiled Croupin, "and he is
sleeping like a dead man. I put it in his coffee and looked to
see that he drank it too." He nodded. "I wish I'd given him a
dose last night, then he would not have half-broken your neck. I
am sure it was William who attacked you, and I grieve that I went
to bed directly I got in. But I was so tired because I had no
sleep at all the night before and could hardly keep my eyes
open." He snapped his fingers together. "So, with the lord in bed
early, too, with a bad cold, William could have been in the
dungeons by ten o'clock and passed the whole night there."</p>

<p>The minutes dragged slowly by but, at last, Larose rose
briskly. "Come on," he said. "It's time now. I make it a good
quarter past twelve."</p>

<p>Croupin opened the door very softly and then, for a long
while, stood with his head craned forward listening.</p>

<p>"It is all right," he whispered at last. "Now hold tightly to
the bottom of my jacket. It will be pitch dark but I know every
foot of the way and shall not have to flash my torch."</p>

<p>They were both wearing rubber shoes and, by touch only, they
crept down the stairs, feeling along the walls of the long
corridor leading to the chapel door.</p>

<p>"Now wait," Croupin breathed softly. "They lock this door when
they remember it and then the key is hung in the hall, but unless
the lord is with them they don't generally trouble. Ah! it is not
locked to-night and so our adventure commences well."</p>

<p>They crept into the chapel like shadows and closed the door
behind them. They were still in inky blackness, for the night was
stormy and no moonlight was filtering through the stained-glass
windows.</p>

<p>Then, at last, Croupin flashed his torch, trailing the light,
however, cautiously upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you can find the opening again?" whispered
Larose.</p>

<p>"Quite sure," Croupin whispered back. "I killed a fly and
stuck it upon the wall the breadth of my left hand from where the
panel opens. If the fly's dropped off, I shall still see the mark
of blood."</p>

<p>But the fly had not dropped off and some thrilling seconds
followed. Then Croupin found the right spot and, with a slight
grating noise, the panel slid back and showed a gaping aperture
just wide enough to admit a man.</p>

<p>Both their hearts beat tumultuously. "I'll go in first,"
whispered Larose, "and then we must make sure how it opens from
inside before we shut it."</p>

<p>But there was no mystery about that for there was an oak knob
upon the inner side of the panel, and so they very quickly pulled
it to behind them and started to descend the narrow spiral
staircase that they saw before them.</p>

<p>"Splendid! Meester Larose," ejaculated Croupin with
enthusiasm. "We are wonderful when we work together, you and I.
Everything runs smoothly, like the ticking of a clock."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the detective complacently, "we take some
risks, certainly, but we minimise those risks as much as we
can."</p>

<p>But they would not by any means have been so assured in their
minds had they been aware of what was taking place in the chapel
at that moment.</p>

<p>A white-faced and badly frightened girl was sitting bolt
upright in the high chair before the organ there, staring wide-eyed at the wall through which they had just passed.</p>

<p>Ann Devenham had fallen asleep when she had finished playing
the Dead March in 'Saul,' the solitary candle above the keys had
burnt itself out, and the girl had awakened suddenly to catch a
fleeting glimpse of Croupin as he was passing through the secret
door behind Larose.</p>

<p>For a minute and longer, unwilling to believe the evidence of
her eyes, she sat on as if paralysed and then regaining the use
of her limbs, she sprang up with a little sob of terror and,
groping her way out of the chapel, tore along the more familiar
passages outside, finally locking herself, breathlessly, in her
own room.</p>

<p>In the meantime, all unknowing of what was happening behind
them, the detective and Croupin had descended the winding stairs.
Eighteen of them, they counted, and then they were brought up
dead against what appeared to be a solid wall. But the detective
at once noticed upon one of the big stones that faced them, a
small patch that was darker than anywhere else.</p>

<p>"That's where they press," he whispered, "and there should be
finger-marks." He hesitated a moment. "But it doesn't matter," he
went on, "for we know who comes down here," and he immediately
pressed upon the dark patch with his open hand.</p>

<p>The stone revolved at once, easily and without noise, and they
stepped into a long corridor whose ends were lost in darkness in
both directions. The roof of the corridor was low and not much
higher than their heads. Its walls were made of big blocks of
stone, roughly hewn; its floor was also of stone, but there, the
long flags were smooth and fitting closely into one another.</p>

<p>A peculiar smell at once assailed their nostrils, dank and
stinging, as of a cellar in which the air had not been stirred
for many years.</p>

<p>"Oh! what a dreadful place!" exclaimed Croupin with a shudder.
"And what a graveyard smell!" His voice rose in horror. "And, oh!
look at those rats!"</p>

<p>He might well exclaim, for with the flashing round of their
torches, myriads of rats seemed to have sprung out from
everywhere. They dashed out of the open doors that gaped into the
corridor, they raced along the ledges just under the low roof,
and they scampered over the very feet of the intruders in their
frantic efforts to hide themselves, as speedily as possible from
the fight.</p>

<p>"Never mind the rats," said the detective, "they won't hurt
us. But we mustn't let this smell get up into the chapel," and
carefully noting its position, he pushed round the big stone
until it was flush again with the other stones in the wall of the
corridor. "See how beautifully it fits," he went on, "no wonder
they smell nothing up there." He tucked the ends of his trousers
into his socks and smiled as if he were quite pleased with
everything. "Now, friend Croupin, at any rate we'll find out
where that precious footman of yours has been digging for the
treasure."</p>

<p>But they soon realised they had an almost superhuman task
before them, for the dungeons and other chambers seemed
innumerable, and there were passages branching off from the main
corridor, that led in all directions.</p>

<p>They went into dungeon after dungeon but their conditions were
all the same. Empty, as they probably had been for hundreds and
hundreds of years, with only their big iron staples, embedded in
the walls, and lengths of gruesome-looking rusted chains to
testify to what dreadful uses they had been put in years gone
by.</p>

<p>"Look at those doors, Monsieur," whispered Larose. "There are
no locks to them that you or I could have picked. They are just
banged to, and those heavy bars fall into their sockets
automatically, and there is no opening them from inside."</p>

<p>They came, at length, to four broad steps and descended by
them into a chamber, larger and loftier than any they had
hitherto been in. It was paved with large oblong stones and many
of them had been cut by deep lettering.</p>

<p>"The vaults!" exclaimed Croupin breathlessly, "where the lords
are buried!"</p>

<p>Larose flashed his torch upon the flags. The lettering worn
and corroded by the years, was yet quite decipherable upon many
of them.</p>

<p>"Maurice, seventh lord of Thralldom, 1374," he read. "Thomas,
tenth lord of Thralldom, 1493. Berenice&mdash;&mdash;" But
suddenly he darted forward and bent low over the stones. "Look,
look," he exclaimed with a catch in his voice, "this stone has
been lifted recently, this grave of Berenice." He clutched
Croupin by the arm. "It is here that William got that crucifix
and those bracelets. He has been rifling the graves."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" ejaculated the Frenchman. "If the lord only
knew!"</p>

<p>There was no doubt that the flag had been interfered with, for
its edges were chipped and broken, and the intervening mortar
scraped away. There was also a deep hole where a crowbar had
evidently been inserted in a final effort to lift up the
flag.</p>

<p>"And it is not the only one that has been lifted," cried
Croupin excitedly. "Those others have been tampered with. See,
that and that."</p>

<p>In all then, they found four flags had been lifted and the
chipping round of a fifth begun.</p>

<p>"And but for that dose of veronal," grinned the Frenchman
pointing to the last stone, "this night the bones of Alicia would
have been rattling in her coffin."</p>

<p>The detective made no comment. He was searching behind a heap
of crumbling stones and rubbish at one end of the vault.</p>

<p>"And here are his tools," he said. "A spade, a crowbar, a
hammer and chisels and a paraffin lantern"&mdash;he examined the
wick&mdash;"recently trimmed."</p>

<p>He sat down and considered everything for a few minutes. "But
this does not help us in the least," he said finally. "I want to
find a passage leading from under the moat to somewhere on the
Thralldom lands, and unless I do, all the risks I am taking with
you will have been wasted." He sprang to his feet again. "Come,
Monsieur, it is half past two and the night will not last for
ever. We must search quickly."</p>

<p>"But where are we to begin the search?" asked the Frenchman
despairingly. He threw out his hands. "It will take months to go
over all these dreadful places."</p>

<p>Larose looked anxious, for remembering the accuracy with which
the revolving stone had been fitted, he realised it would be a
stupendous task to examine the walls everywhere, with the minute
care that would be required to find another opening&mdash;if,
indeed, it existed.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, his eyes fell carelessly upon a broad,
stone slab that had been built into the wall just at the entrance
to the vaults. It was about three feet in height and had
evidently been placed there to rest the coffins upon when they
were brought into the vaults and before they were lowered into
the graves.</p>

<p>He regarded it without interest for a moment, but his eyes,
trained by his life's work to notice anything out of the
ordinary, he noted there was a black patch upon one end of the
slab. It looked like paint at first sight, and he began to wonder
sub-consciously what paint could be doing there. His interest
quickening, he moved forward and flashed his torch upon the
patch. Then he bent down closely and then, suddenly, he
straightened himself up and his eyes opened very wide. "But this
is blood," he exclaimed hoarsely, "and there is a long hair
sticking to it. It is a woman's hair and jet black"&mdash;he
could hardly get his breath&mdash;"and Rita Ethelton's hair was
jet black."</p>

<p>Croupin sprang to his side and flashed his own light upon the
patch too, and then, in startled silence they stood regarding
each other, with faces that showed up pale and ghastly even among
the shadows of the vault.</p>

<p>The detective was the first to recover his composure. "Yes,
that is blood," he said quietly, "and see&mdash;it has dripped
too over the edge of the slab. The hair is human because of its
length and, for the same reason, it must have belonged to a
woman. Therefore the body of a woman was placed here and if she
were already dead, from the extent of the bloodstains, it could
only have been very shortly after the moment of her death." He
paused a moment and then added very slowly, "Unless, that dried
blood there be the blood of all four deaths, and each time the
assassin has waited here to rest."</p>

<p>Bidding Croupin stand back, he proceeded to minutely examine
the stone flags all round the base of the slab, and was at once
rewarded by further discoveries, for he picked up quite a number
of small pieces of dried black mud.</p>

<p>"And they were brought in upon the boots of someone who had
just come off the marshes," he whispered. He could not hide the
exultation in his voice. "Oh! how it all fits in!"</p>

<p>"Then William is the madman who has been killing all these
people," exclaimed Croupin excitedly, "and he found those gold
ornaments, only by chance." He grabbed Larose by the arm. "Don't
you see it, Monsieur? It is as clear as daylight to me." His eyes
were almost starting from his head. "He has killed four persons
and he has brought them all down here by that passage he has
discovered, and has buried them under those four flagstones he
has lifted up. Quick! where is that crowbar you saw?"</p>

<p>The detective whistled. "By Jove! you may be right," and in a
few seconds they were handling the crowbar and proceeding
feverishly to raise the first flag.</p>

<p>But the flag was thick and heavy and they could only raise it
inch by inch, and then were obliged to wedge stones under it to
prevent it falling back.</p>

<p>And their exultation died down quickly with the coming up of
the stone, for there was no suggestion at all that any body had
been interred there recently.</p>

<p>"But perhaps it is well covered over," panted Croupin "and
that is why there is no smell."</p>

<p>The stone was up at last and they were gazing upon a bed of
dry and crumbled earth with no suggestion, however that any
corpse had been interred there recently. A few minutes of
strenuous digging and then up came a piece of bone.</p>

<p>"A leg bone," said Larose grimly, "and from the look of it,
it's been there for hundreds of years." He shook his head. "No,
it's no good digging deeper here. Now for the other ones."</p>

<p>With great labour, one after another, they lifted up the three
other flags, but made no attempt at digging very deep down for
the earth beneath was just the same as in the first one, crumbled
and disturbed, but with no odour other than that of the dried
earth of hundreds of years.</p>

<p>"Now," said Larose, "we'll just sit down and sum everything
up," and he was joined by Croupin upon the steps at the entrance
to the vaults. "No, no smoking, Monsieur," he went on sternly,
for the Frenchman had been upon the point of lighting a
cigarette. "To smoke here, might prove as dangerous to us as
smoking in a powder magazine. You say William doesn't smoke, and
a non-smoker would detect the smell of tobacco smoke, even after
forty-eight hours. Switch off your torch, too, for we'll probably
want every minute of our lights now and we can talk just as well
in the dark."</p>

<p>Croupin complied at once and the inky blackness of the vaults
enveloped them. A short silence followed and then the detective
began in a calm and measured tone.</p>

<p>"This is exactly what the position is. We are looking for a
madman whom we suppose killed a girl, with jet-black hair, in the
neighbourhood of this castle here, and disposed of her body in a
place we cannot find&mdash;and our attention has unexpectedly
been drawn to an individual whom we have found out has access to
these vaults. Our attention was not drawn to him, in the first
instance, because of the disappearance of this girl, but because
we imagined him to have had something to do with the killing and
disappearance of quite another person. We suspect him of
murderous tendencies, quite apart from anything to do with this
girl."</p>

<p>Larose paused here for a moment, and, in the silence and
darkness, the emotional Frenchman edged up a little closer to him
to make sure that be had not moved away.</p>

<p>The detective went on. "Well, we get on to this man's tracks,
we follow them and they lead us down to this slab of stone upon
which we find dried blood and a long jet-black, woman's hair." He
lowered his voice impressively. "We have suspected him of one
killing and we find concrete evidence of another, in a spot that
we know he is in the habit of frequenting. We also find mud here
similar to that upon the marshlands outside." He reached out and
gripped Croupin by the arm. "Now, what conclusion, therefore, are
we justified in arriving at?"</p>

<p>"Firstly," replied Croupin promptly, "that he is the killer of
both these people and secondly, that the secret of that passage
under the moat is his." A little of the assurance in his voice
died away. "But where has he hidden the bodies?"</p>

<p>"They should be close here and the entrance to the passages
too," replied the detective sharply, "for he laid that woman's
body upon the slab either as I have suggested, to rest himself
after having brought it under the moat, or else to get the burial
place prepared."</p>

<p>But all at once the Frenchman was disturbed by an idea that
had come to him. "Why should he have brought the bodies down
here?" he asked anxiously. "Why should he have gone to all that
labour?"</p>

<p>"Why should he have killed these poor people at all, if it
comes to that?" replied Larose. "You see, Monsieur," he went on,
"we are undoubtedly dealing with a madman here, and therefore we
cannot judge his actions by what we should have done ourselves.
We can conceive, as yet, of no reason why he should have taken
these poor creatures' lives, but when we do find out what turned
him all at once into an assassin, we may, at the same time, learn
why he chose to hide the bodies here."</p>

<p>"I realise that," said Croupin slowly, "but not knowing his
motives will make our work ever so much more difficult."</p>

<p>"And another thing," said Larose. "We cannot be sure yet that
it is William. We can only surmise, too, that it was he who gave
me this bruised neck last night. Don't forget we know for certain
that that Halesworth butcher has been in a madhouse once, and
remember&mdash;he was born near here and should therefore know
every yard of the Thralldom lands. As a boy, he worked on them
and what is more possible than that in the course of his work in
his young days, he learnt that very secret that we think William
now possesses? No, no, we can't rule out that butcher yet. After
last night things are very suspicious about him." He switched on
his torch and looked at his watch. "But it is nearly four o'clock
and you must be back again up those stairs before morning
comes."</p>

<p>"And we must think, too, how I am to get you out of the
castle," said Croupin, "and how you are to get back again to
continue the search."</p>

<p>"I shall not go out," replied Larose quickly. "I shall remain
on down here, and whether I find the bodies or not, I shall wait
for that madman to come here again." He nodded his head. "He will
return sure enough if he does not learn anyone is after him."</p>

<p>"Well, William, will certainly come again," said Croupin
gleefully, "for he has those other graves to dig up yet." He
looked anxious. "But I don't like leaving you, for this is a
dreadful place to be in, alone."</p>

<p>Larose laughed. "It is a great adventure, Monsieur, and one
which I shall love. But you must go up now and get me a few
things that I shall have to have, a blanket, some candles, a
bottle of water and a little food."</p>

<p>"But what about to-night?" asked Croupin. "I cannot come
before midnight because of the lord and after that"&mdash;he
shook his head ominously&mdash;"I may run into William."</p>

<p>"Now, that's awkward," said Larose frowning, "for I must keep
in touch with you all the time. Let me think."</p>

<p>"I could come down just as it begins to get light," said
Croupin, "or failing that, you could come into my little room
just off the kitchen and I will leave food for you there and a
note, if I have anything to tell you, under the leg of the
kitchen table. There is always a wedge of paper there to keep it
from rocking."</p>

<p>They replaced the flags they had lifted and removed all traces
of their work and then after Croupin had been up to obtain the
things that the detective required, the latter was left alone in
the darkness, among the rats, and in the presence of the
dead.</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII. &mdash; THE SUSPICIONS OF WILLIAM</h2>

<p class="first">THE following morning William awoke with a head,
which if it had belonged to James, the latter would have
described as 'muzzy.'</p>

<p>But William was not aware what a muzzy head was, for he had
never indulged in too much alcohol. Indeed, he had been a
teetotaller all his life, and had always a great contempt for
those who took anything stronger than water or tea or coffee.</p>

<p>He felt languid and depressed and he counted his pulse and
found that it was very slow. Also, he had a bitter taste in his
mouth, and he looked at his tongue in the mirror which showed
that it was furred and of an ugly colour.</p>

<p>He sat upon the edge of his bed and thought. This was the
second time that he had felt like this lately; the other time had
been not a fortnight ago. Then, as now, he had slept all night
like a dead man, to awake in the morning with all the symptoms of
one who had taken a heavy dose of some powerful drug. And he had
been suspicious then that someone had been drugging him, and had
looked hastily to see if any one had been opening his trunk while
he had been asleep.</p>

<p>But he had found his keys in their usual pocket in the belt
that he always wore upon him, night and day, and all his locked
up belongings had been intact. Still he had half thought that the
two gold bangles he had tied up in his handkerchief and had
thrust at the bottom of all the other things in the trunk, were
not tied up in exactly the same way as he had left them, and he
had been doubtful, too, if the crucifix were not wrapped up
differently in the piece of shaving paper.</p>

<p>Yes, he remembered how strong his suspicions had been then,
and he became doubly suspicious now.</p>

<p>He knew something of the after effects of drugs, for there had
been a time in his life when drugs had played a prominent and
unpleasant part.</p>

<p>It was true he had only very vague memories of those days and
nothing stood out really clearly to him, except a large garden
with very high walls. But he could dimly remember being given
nasty-tasting things to drink, and if he refused them, as he
sometimes did, a cultured voice would say, "A fiftieth of
hyosine, I think." And then would come a struggle and someone
would prick his arm, and he would fight fiercely and
then&mdash;drop off to sleep for a hundred years.</p>

<p>Then next, he would wake up with a head exactly like he had
now.</p>

<p>He screwed up his eyes in perplexity.</p>

<p>Surely this heavy head, this tired feeling, and this bitter
taste he was now experiencing for the second time, could not be
natural? It must be something he had been given to eat or drink
that was causing it.</p>

<p>He went carefully over all he had had for supper the previous
night. Just some cold lamb and bread-and-butter, some salad, a
little stewed fruit and a small piece of cheese. They had all had
the same things in the servants' hall and they had all been
served from the same dishes.</p>

<p>Then he had had two glasses of water and a small cup of
coffee. Ah! he remembered now&mdash;that coffee! It had tasted
burnt and he had remarked upon it, but everyone else had said
theirs was all right.</p>

<p>And Antoine, the chef, had handed him that cup of coffee! A
hot wave of colour surged his sallow face. Yes, then if anyone
had doped him, it had been that cursed Antoine, and he believed
the chef had done it.</p>

<p>He clenched his teeth together and his thoughts ran on.</p>

<p>No, he had never liked Antoine, and from the first moment of
the Frenchman's arrival at the castle, for some reason that he
had never been able to explain, he had always been doubtful about
him.</p>

<p>The chef was such a watchful-looking, prying fellow, and he
was always so curious about everything. And it was strange, too,
about that old violin of his that he could play upon like a
professional musician. He had always denied that it was of any
particular value, and yet once when one of the girls had
accidentally knocked it off a chair, he had gone as white as a
sheet and had trembled all over until he had found it had not
been injured.</p>

<p>The footman thought rapidly. But if Antoine had drugged him,
what had he drugged him for? Who was Antoine and what was he
after?</p>

<p>Antoine was nothing but a cook, an ordinary cook. Ah! but was
he only a cook? He wasn't ordinary either. He was clever, much
too clever, he, William, had often thought to be taking service
in a private family. Yes, there was something very unusual about
him.</p>

<p>William thought on for a long while and then, realising that
he would be late for his work, began to make his toilet
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll watch that Antoine," he snarled. His face suddenly
took on an ashen hue. "But what if he's been watching me?" A
cruel and cunning expression came into his eyes and he shifted
them rapidly from one side to the other and added menacingly.
"It'll be bad for him if he has."</p>

<p>So Croupin noticed a subtle something about William the first
moment that morning when he set eyes upon him.</p>

<p>He felt, rather than saw, that the footman was watching him,
and when he handed him his cup of coffee, William sipped the
first few drops very cautiously, as if he were not quite sure it
was all right.</p>

<p>During the morning, whenever the two were brought in contact
with each other in the course of their duties, William's manner
towards the chef was more constrained and unresponsive than
ever.</p>

<p>When he took his lordship's breakfast tray from him, he lidded
his eyes so that their expression should not be seen, and when
Croupin spoke, he answered curtly and in the coldest manner
possible.</p>

<p>Croupin would have been terribly mortified if he had known
that William was remarking something peculiar in him, too. The
footman was sure that there was embarrassment in the chef's
manner, and that he was more anxious to ingratiate himself and
more anxious to please.</p>

<p>And then suddenly, when alone upon his duties in the library,
William began wondering with a sort of shock, if there were
anything in connection with the visits of the detective from
Scotland Yard and the drug that he was now quite certain had been
administered to him the previous night.</p>

<p>He had not been present when the detective had come into the
servants' hall, but he had heard about all that had happened from
the girls and how the chef had twice spoken very rapidly in his
own tongue to their visitor.</p>

<p>Now, was Antoine acting in collusion with the police, and had
those hurried, sharp words meant any passing on to the detective
of some discovery that he had made? And if he had made any
discovery might it not be that he was aware of the secret passage
leading down into into the vaults and that he knew that he,
William, had been making use of it, night after night?</p>

<p>He looked stealthily round, but he was quite alone in the
room. His thoughts ran on.</p>

<p>What if he were found out and they were going to take those
nights from him?</p>

<p>He bent his head forward with a strange light in his eyes.</p>

<p>Those nights! Ah! he was a different being then! He was no
longer a hireling, decked out in the livery of servitude and
carrying out menial tasks at the bidding of a querulous old
man!</p>

<p>Another life came to him amid the dust of those dead years and
he was the sovereign of all about him there! The reek of the bone
earth was an opiate then to his scarred and tortured brain and he
was King, Emperor and God in a dark world all of his own!</p>

<p>Myriads of rats were among his subjects and he had dealt out
death to them when he had been in the mood! With his bare hands,
he had torn them from the crevices along the corridors and their
blood had been sprinkled upon the stones!</p>

<p>"Ah! there had been blood sometimes! Blood! Blood!" Then he
passed his hand over his forehead and stared wonderingly round,
like a man awakening from a dream.</p>

<p>But he heard shuffling footsteps behind him, and in the
passing of a second was the quiet and subservient footman
again.</p>

<p>His thoughts had, however, left their aftermath, but with
cunning now taking the place of rage, and no one at the midday
meal would have dreamed, from his impassive demeanour, the red
mist that he was seeing before his eyes.</p>

<p>He would not leave his room for a few nights, he told himself,
and, in the meantime, if he could murder the chef in a manner
that would not direct the slightest suspicion upon himself, he
would do so. But nothing must be done that would bring him in
contact with the police. He shook his head energetically. No, he
had no wish to be questioned by them.</p>

<p>He thought of many unpleasant ways in which he could get rid
of Antoine, but all his ideas were tempered with a foresight that
would leave nothing to chance.</p>

<p>To induce the chef to come up upon the battlements and then
throw him over would be the simplest plan, but it was not
practicable for he could think of no excuse to inveigle him into
going up there.</p>

<p>Then he thought of poisoning him, and he remembered some mice
poison that he had seen upon a shelf in the scullery. It would
contain strychnine, probably, and he would look for an
opportunity to place it in something the chef was going to eat or
drink.</p>

<p>So choosing a moment early in the afternoon, when no one was
about, he tiptoed into the scullery and reached for the tin of
poison upon the shelf. But ill-fortune was dogging him there, for
he had only just taken it down when Rosa, the under-housemaid,
came in and seeing what he was handling, asked immediately what
he wanted mice poison for.</p>

<p>He was quite calm and collected and explained he was looking
for Insectibain, as he had just seen a black-beetle going under
the big cupboard in the servants' hall. She told him where the
Insectibain was and he had to replace the mice poison and that
cut out all thoughts of dealing with the chef in that way.</p>

<p>Later, about four o'clock, it being his afternoon off, he went
for a long walk to clear his head, and when passing through the
village of Westleton, he suddenly saw Antoine coming out of the
little general shop, with a parcel in his hand. The chef did not
see him, but turned at once to walk back in the direction of the
castle.</p>

<p>William waited a couple of minutes and then went into the shop
himself and bought three pennyworth of boiled sweets, asking
laughingly when the sweets were handed over, if the Frenchman had
just been buying any chocolates for the girls up at the
castle.</p>

<p>"No," replied the shopman, laughing back, "he only bought a
pound of candles."</p>

<p>"Candles!" ejaculated William uneasily, when he was outside
the shop again, and continuing his walk towards the sea. "Now
what does he want candles for? I used candles until I'd bought
that hurricane lamp." And he became more disturbed in his mind,
than ever.</p>

<p>The goddess of ill-fortune was certainly following William
that afternoon, for he had not left the shop two minutes when
Croupin returned to it. He had forgotten he was out of
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"And I was sure it was chocolates you'd come back for,"
laughed the shopman. "Mr. William's just been in, and he asked if
you'd been buying any for the pretty girls up at the castle. He
saw you go out with your parcel and was very astonished you'd
only been buying candles."</p>

<p>"Oh! he was, was he?" commented the very discomfited Croupin.
"Well, he's always as curious as an old woman that chap." And he
proceeded to walk back to the castle, feeling most uneasy,
looking many times over his shoulder, to see if William were
coming up behind him.</p>

<p>"He suspects something," he muttered hoarsely. "I am sure he
was different this morning, and now, he'll murder me if he gets
the chance." He nodded his head. "I'll not leave my room to-night." A catch came into his voice. "But I must warn that
Gilbert somehow. Croupin's not the man to let down a friend."</p>

<p>And so, directly he arrived back at the castle and had changed
into his chef's clothes, he chanced everything and ran into the
chapel. He had put a big dab of flour upon his face and carried a
big rolling pin with plenty of flour adhering to it, with the
intention of declaring excitedly that he was chasing a rat, if he
were unlucky enough to meet anyone upon his way.</p>

<p>But he encountered no one and very quickly had negotiated the
spiral staircase and was running along the corridor leading to
the dungeons.</p>

<p>"Meester Larose," he called out shrilly, "it is I, Croupin and
I want you! Quick!" The detective at once appeared with his torch
flashed.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"William suspects something," he exclaimed breathlessly, "and
is watching me now! I don't suppose he'll come down to-night, and
I'd better not either."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Monsieur," exclaimed Larose. "You're a good friend
to have."</p>

<p>"Found anything?" asked Croupin. "I can't stop a second."</p>

<p>"No, nothing as yet," replied Larose, "but I've a lot more
places to search round."</p>

<p>"Well, as I'd better not come down with your food to-night,
you must come up and get it yourself, directly it begins to get
light in the morning. I'll leave it all ready under the dresser
in my kitchen. You know where it is. <i>Au revoir</i>. Good
fortune to you." In two minutes he was back again in the kitchen,
without having encountered anyone.</p>

<p>"<i>Bien</i>, Monsieur Croupin," he chuckled as he got busy
with his pots and pans, "but you are a great man and like
Napoleon, nothing is impossible with you." He shook his head
slowly, "But you have had a worrying day."</p>

<p>And he was by no means the only one in the castle who had been
worried that day for in addition to himself and William, both Ann
Devenham and Lord Thralldom had had their unpleasant times.</p>

<p>The girl had risen that morning after a very broken night, and
had tried in vain to persuade herself that what she had seen in
the chapel had been only a dream.</p>

<p>But she was too certain she could not have been mistaken. She
had seen a man carrying a light pass into the solid wall that she
had many times helped Rosa, the housemaid, to dust.</p>

<p>"What did it mean," she asked herself. "What could it mean but
that someone, unknown to them all, had access to the underground
parts of the castle and was descending into them for some
sinister purpose of his own. And that purpose could not be a good
one," she argued, "because who would be moving about in the dead
of night unless he were doing something wrong?"</p>

<p>She was angry with herself that she had no idea at what exact
time she had run from the chapel for, upon gaining the sanctuary
of her bedroom, she had been so frightened that she had just
flung herself upon the bed as she was and not until the dawn was
beginning to filter through the windows, had she undressed
properly and put herself into bed.</p>

<p>Then when the hour for getting up had come, she was oppressed
with the thought that she must tell her uncle. It would worry
him, she was sure, but it was not right that he should not know
what had happened, and so she must find the first opportunity she
could and speak to him alone.</p>

<p>But it was not until the morning was well advanced that she
could get that opportunity and then, following him into the
library, she told him everything.</p>

<p>With her first words a look almost of consternation came into
his face, but it was quickly succeeded by a look of stony
incredibility. He made no remark, however, until she had
finished. Then he asked sharply. "What was the man like?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't say," she replied. "I didn't see his face. His
back was towards me and he was flashing a torch before him and
stooping to pass through the opening in the wall." She hesitated
a moment. "But, oh! uncle, it was someone I know, I am sure, for
there was something familiar about his figure to me."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom eyed her very sternly. "Have you said anything
about this to anyone else?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, I've spoken to no one," she replied. "It would terrify
mother if I did. But I thought I ought to tell you."</p>

<p>A long silence followed and then Lord Thralldom heaved a heavy
sigh. "I've lived nearly all my life here," he said slowly, "and
until these last few days there has been no nonsense about
mysterious secret passages. Then, within a few days, Marmaduke
Bonnett mentions them, that man from Scotland Yard brings them
up, and now you come with a tale that I can hardly believe to be
true." He rose wearily from his chair. "Come with me and show me
where you saw this door." He smiled kindly. "I believe you dreamt
it all."</p>

<p>They went together into the chapel and shutting the door
behind them, he asked her to point out where the opening had
been.</p>

<p>Ann hesitated. "I don't know exactly," she said, "but it was
somewhere about there," and together, they approached where she
indicated, and proceeded to examine the oak panelling
carefully.</p>

<p>They tapped upon every inch, and pushed and pulled against the
panelling in all directions, but the oak was firm and solid as a
rock and no discovery rewarded their efforts.</p>

<p>With every minute Lord Thralldom's face grew sterner. "I'm not
pleased with you, Ann," he said at last. "You're a foolish girl
and are worrying me unnecessarily. Of course you didn't see a man
go in here and if you mention about it to anyone"&mdash;his voice
was almost menacing in his displeasure&mdash;"there will be a
pack of rumours going about that will torment me out of my
fife."</p>

<p>"But I'm certain, Uncle&mdash;&mdash;" began Ann.</p>

<p>"You are not certain," interrupted Lord Thralldom angrily.
"You are just at that unbalanced age that comes to all women,
when their judgment and reason cannot be relied upon." He snapped
his fingers in a gesture of contempt. "Look at your conduct with
that young fellow that came up the other night and whom I
foolishly asked to stay to dinner. Why, Marmaduke Bonnett informs
me he is only a clerk in a bank and you"&mdash;he glared angrily
at her&mdash;"are a Thralldom. I am ashamed of you, Ann."</p>

<p>Ann was upon the verge of tears, but she restrained them
bravely.</p>

<p>"He is in every way a gentleman, Uncle," she said quickly. She
tossed her head defiantly and with something of her lordly
relation's spirit. "But that has nothing to do with what I saw
last night."</p>

<p>"And I say you saw nothing," insisted Lord Thralldom firmly,
"and if you persist in your folly, it will occasion me great
annoyance." He clenched his hands together. "Don't you realise,
girl, that if it gets about that you say you saw a man going
through a secret passage here, all the gossips in the county will
be talking about it, and it will draw attention to my paintings.
Good Heavens!" he ejaculated, "just as if they were not a great
enough responsibility already."</p>

<p>Ann made no comment and he went on very sternly, "Now, you
listen to me. You must give me your solemn promise that you will
not mention about this to a soul in the castle." He glared at
her. "You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand," she replied.</p>

<p>"And you promise?" he went on sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise." Her face was very pale but her expression
was not a cowed one and indeed, she looked just as angry as he
was.</p>

<p>"Good," he remarked, and he added grimly, "a Thralldom never
lies." And he left the chapel without another word.</p>

<p>Ann went up to her bedroom and gave way to her emotions in a
flood of tears. She felt very miserable, but all her fear of the
man whom she was still certain she had seen going through the
secret passage, was now lost in the indignity under which she was
smarting. Her uncle had treated her in a way that was
humiliating. He had not only been contemptuously incredulous
about what she had told him, but also he had spoken as if there
were something despicable in her friendship with John Harden.</p>

<p>She recovered herself very quickly, however, and sponging her
face well, with cold water, there was nothing at lunch time to
give any indication of the emotional stress through which she had
passed.</p>

<p>She was losing, too, something of the resentment she had felt
towards her uncle. After all, she told herself, he was an old
man, and he could not have many years to live. The doctors told
them he might have another stroke any time and the next one might
be fatal. It was less easy to forgive his reference to John
Harden, however, but there again his mind had undoubtedly been
poisoned by that detestable Captain Bonnett.</p>

<p>All these thoughts coursed quickly through her mind, and very
soon she was smiling again at her uncle as if there had been no
unpleasantness between them that morning. She was considering,
too, how she could help him, notwithstanding that he was
incredulous of all she had told him and so insistent that he was
not in a position to need any help.</p>

<p>Something was going on in the castle that was mysterious and,
with those almost priceless paintings in the picture gallery, she
was sure it was not safe there should be any strange happenings
that could not be explained.</p>

<p>She had promised her uncle that she would not speak to anyone
about what she knew had happened in the chapel the previous
night, but that promise she reminded herself, only extended to
those inside the castle and she had made no promise about anyone
else outside.</p>

<p>She wondered then how she could get in touch with that
detective from Scotland Yard. He had seemed to be a man whom she
could trust and, if she told him everything he would surely
advise her, and in any case she then would have done what she
felt she ought to, whether any misfortune came upon her uncle or
not.</p>

<p>So, after lunch, finding an opportunity when no one was about,
she shut herself up in the telephone cabinet and with a little
quickening of the beatings of her heart, rang up the bank at
Saxmundham and asked for John Harden. She was put through to him
at once and she flushed happily when she caught the thrill in his
voice as he answered her.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, he would be delighted to do anything for her,
he said. No, he did not know where that Mr. Larose was staying,
except that he knew it was somewhere in Minsmere Haven. But he
would soon find out, for he would go there straight away directly
he was free, which would be about four o'clock. Should he come up
and tell her? Oh! well, he was to get the detective to ring her
up! Exactly at eight o'clock, and if he could not get hold of the
detective, he was to ring her up himself and tell her!</p>

<p>"And don't let Mr. Larose give his name," she enjoined
impressively, "nor you either, if you ring up. I don't want
anyone to know. Just ask for me and say there's a message from
Miss Smith, but if the call is put through exactly at eight, I
will be by the telephone cabinet myself and answer when anyone
rings."</p>

<p>Then followed a few minutes' conversation, which would have
meant nothing to any outsider listening, but where every word of
it was nevertheless laden to each speaker with the most beautiful
message in all the world. It was the message that man and woman
have been whispering to each other as long as time has run.</p>

<p>Ann left the telephone with her eyes sparkling. "I don't mind
what anyone says," she told herself defiantly, "as long as he
wants me." Her face flushed. "And I know he does."</p>

<p>Three minutes before eight, she was again in the telephone
cabinet and holding back the hammer of the bell with her fingers.
It vibrated at exactly eight o'clock.</p>

<p>It was John Harden speaking and he told her he had not been
able to get in touch with Larose. He had found out where the
detective was staying, at the inn on Minsmere Haven, but he had
not been home since the previous evening, and no one knew where
he had gone. He had not left for good, however, because his car
was still in the garage and so he, John Harden, had left a note
for him, telling him exactly what to do when he came back.</p>

<p>She rang off reluctantly a few minutes later, and, with no
inclination to visit the chapel, went into the drawing-room,
where she found her stepmother sitting alone.</p>

<p>"Captain Bonnett has been looking for you," said Lady Deering.
"He wanted you to go up on the battlements with him. There's a
big schooner anchored in the haven." Ann made no remark and she
added with a smile, "Marmaduke is very interested in you, Ann,
and you might do worse. He comes of a very good family and your
uncle likes him."</p>

<p>The girl tossed her head contemptuously. "Well, I don't,
Mother," she replied. "He bores me more every time I see
him."</p>

<p>Lady Deering frowned. "Well, don't be foolish, Ann," she
replied, "for you cannot afford to offend your uncle. Remember,
he's an old man and all your future lies in his hands. He may
make ample provision for you if you do as he wants you to." She
spoke sharply. "I know he's annoyed with you about that young
fellow in Saxmundham."</p>

<p>Ann made no comment. "Where's Captain Bonnett now?" she asked.
"Do you know?"</p>

<p>Her stepmother smiled. "That's a good girl," she replied. "You
will find him with your uncle in the gallery."</p>

<p>"I don't want to find him," said Ann calmly. "I only wanted to
know where he was so that I could avoid him," and before her
stepmother could think of any adequate reply, she swept from the
room.</p>

<p>Shortly after half past nine Lord Thralldom, who was alone in
his bedroom, summoned James and announced that he was going up on
to the battlements.</p>

<p>"I've heard the hooting of the owl again, just now," he said
sternly, "and we'll go up and see if we can stop that nonsense
for good."</p>

<p>James cursed under his breath. He had been disturbed at a most
interesting moment in a game of bridge, when he and Rosa were
winning from the butler and Mary, and it should have meant a
couple of shillings at least. He had just sorted a good no-trump
hand, too, when the bell had rung.</p>

<p>But he bowed most deferentially. "Very good, my lord," and he
added as if with great solicitude for his master's health, but
really with the hope that he might put him off from the
ridiculous excursion, "Your lordship had better wear an overcoat
for I think it's going to rain."</p>

<p>"You've got your pistol, of course?" asked Lord Thralldom
sharply, and James cursed under his breath again, as he replied
that he had.</p>

<p>They ascended the stairs leading up on to the battlements,
very slowly, and with Lord Thralldom leaning heavily upon his
servant's arm. A slight drizzling rain greeted them when they
arrived at the top and were in the open air.</p>

<p>"Now bend down and don't show too much of yourself," said his
lordship sharply. "I'll go the north side. You go the other way
and we'll meet at the east tower. Hold your pistol ready and
shoot on the instant if you see anything moving."</p>

<p>"Very good, my lord," replied James, and he cursed under his
breath for the third time. He hated firearms of all descriptions,
considering them always as an abiding source of danger to their
possessors.</p>

<p>He commenced circling slowly round the battlements, as ordered
by his employer, but he took no interest in anything that might
be below the castle, all his thoughts being directed upon what
they were probably then doing in the servants' hall.</p>

<p>"I'd have given old Bevan hell," he muttered, "and with any
help at all from the tart, it'd have been a grand slam."</p>

<p>But his meditations were interrupted suddenly by a sharp call
from Lord Thralldom. "Over here, at once, James. I see something
moving." With a grimace of resignation but with all appearances
of great energy, the disgusted footman ran to his master.</p>

<p>"Quick, there he is at the end of the ditch," hissed Lord
Thralldom. "It's a long shot, but if you're pretty good with a
pistol as you told me when I engaged you, you may at least wing
him."</p>

<p>James released the safety catch of his pistol with a shudder
and raising his arm shakily, pointed his weapon in the direction
indicated. He had seen nothing, but that did not matter. He
pulled the trigger and the pistol went off.</p>

<p>"Did you hit him?" asked Thralldom. "I thought I saw him
fall."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, I hit him," replied the footman grinning to
himself in the dark. "In the leg, I think. I aimed pretty
low."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" exclaimed Lord Thralldom. "That'll teach him a
lesson anyhow." He peered over into the darkness. "Now can you
see anybody else?"</p>

<p>But the footman was thankful his master could pick out no more
shadows at which to make him fire that awful pistol, and so,
after circling round the battlements several times, they
descended the stairs into the castle.</p>

<p>James was free again at last, but almost racing into the
servants' hall directly he had got rid of his master, dreadful
news awaited him. In his absence, Isobel, the head-parlourmaid,
had been given his hand to play and she had slipped badly by
going down four tricks. The game was finished and he had three
and twopence to pay.</p>

<p>Then in due time they were all sleeping in Thralldom Castle,
but in their slumbers their subconscious minds were all stirring
in curious and widely differing ways.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom dreamed happily that injury had at last been
inflicted upon one of his phantom enemies; William was restless
and tossed about, dreaming that he was back among those high
walls again; James had a horrid nightmare that he was missing
another grand slam; Larose had only snatches of sleep because the
rats ran over him and even crept under his blankets. Ann
dreamed&mdash;ah! but what were Ann's dreams and who would dare
pry among the slumbers of a young girl in love? No, let us leave
Ann alone.</p>

<p>In the meantime Naughton Jones was most annoyed. Rawlings had
shot a hole right through the side of his overcoat and he had
only recently purchased the garment for four pounds ten! He was
sure it was Rawlings although he had not actually seen him nor,
indeed, had he been able to find any trace of the man
afterwards.</p>

<p>The great investigator had been prospecting round the castle
in the darkness, hoping that he might catch the demented bailiff
upon the warpath again and then suddenly he had heard a hissing
noise and felt some disturbance in the garments at his side. Then
had come a sharp crack from behind him and he knew a pistol had
been fired. He had turned like lightning but was too late to see
any flash and so could not determine from which direction the
shot had come.</p>

<p>Feeling his rent garment, he realised what a narrow escape it
had been for him. But any thankfulness on that account was quite
out-weighed by the knowledge, firstly, that he had been beaten in
scoutscraft by a madman, for he had never been aware of the
presence of his assailant and yet the latter had evidently seen
him, and secondly, that Rawlings was now evidently in the
possession of fire-arms.</p>

<p>The position, in Jones's opinion, had become so serious that
he took two hours and more crawling along ditches with his
stomach flat upon the ground, before he reached in safety the
little cottage where he had taken rooms.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; AT NIGHT IN THE CHAPEL</h2>

<p class="first">THE following day it was as if a number of
trains of gunpowder were being laid in the great castle of
Thralldom, with the possibility of any one of them exploding at
any moment.</p>

<p>Larose was searching feverishly for the place where the body
of a woman with jet-black hair had been interred; William was
nursing murderous thoughts towards Antoine, the chef, and racking
his brain how best to put them into action; Ann was
hoping&mdash;with what possible consequences she did not
dream&mdash;to have speech with the detective from Scotland Yard
before another night had fallen, and Silas Q. Hudson, of New
York, was perfecting his final arrangements for breaking into the
picture gallery and purloining the Rubens and any other canvasses
he and his companions could manage to carry away.</p>

<p>The American was lunching in the castle and his faithful body-servant and masseur was participating in the midday meal in the
servants' hall.</p>

<p>"As you are coming up to lunch, Mr. Hudson," Lord Thralldom
had telephoned earlier in the morning, "your man may just as well
wait and return with you later in the car."</p>

<p>Nothing could have suited Silas Hudson better, for with
arrangements almost complete for breaking into the castle, it was
yet most desirable that Kelly should have a close-up view of the
wiring of the alarms attached to the frame of 'The Man of
Sorrows' before the actual night of the attempt.</p>

<p>Thus far, although Kelly had been coming up to the castle upon
every other day, to give his customary half hour's massage to
Lady Deering, the gang had not been able to think of any
reasonable excuse to get him into the picture gallery, but with
the near approach of the critical hour, Hudson's imagination had
been stirred into activity and at last he had thought of an
idea.</p>

<p>He began to work round to it directly he arrived at the
castle.</p>

<p>They were all sitting in the lounge waiting for the luncheon
gong to sound when he turned smilingly to Lady Deering.</p>

<p>"And how is the lumbago getting on?" he asked. "It ought to be
getting better by now."</p>

<p>"It is, Mr. Hudson," replied Lady Deering thankfully. "I am
beginning to feel quite a different person." She flushed ever so
little. "Your man has such wonderful strength in his hands that
now I have got accustomed to him, I really think that, apart from
his curing my lumbago, he is imparting some of his vigour to
me."</p>

<p>"Quite so, Lady Deering," commented Hudson glibly, "and that
is what often happens. It is well recognised in medical circles
that strength can be imparted from one person to another." He
laughed. "You know, if I had made this world, I should have made
health catching, instead of disease."</p>

<p>Lady Deering lowered her voice so that James, who was handing
round cocktails should not hear. "But oh! I didn't like him at
all at first and being massaged, too, was not a bit like what I'd
thought it would be. He seemed terribly rough"&mdash;she looked
puzzled&mdash;"and I never knew they wore rubber gloves."</p>

<p>"Oh! but that's the latest thing in the medical world,"
replied Hudson quickly, and choking back a grin. "The elasticity
of the rubber is supposed to set up vibrations and their effect
is wonderful upon the patient."</p>

<p>"Well, they have certainly been wonderful for me," agreed Lady
Deering, "and I've been trying to induce my daughter here to let
Mr. Thompson give her a course for her leg. She ricked her thigh
about six months ago and her leg is often stiff after a dance."
She looked frowningly at Ann. "But the foolish girl won't have
it."</p>

<p>The American with great difficulty cut short a loud guffaw. He
looked with twinkling eyes at Ann Devenham.</p>

<p>"So you won't have any massage, young lady?" he smiled. "You
don't like the idea?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," replied Ann laconically. She had quite got over
the feelings of cordiality she had momentarily experienced for
the American upon his first visit to the castle, and she now
regarded him as a vulgar specimen of the great country that had
given him birth. As for the masseur, Thompson, she always
shuddered when she thought of the very idea of him pawing over
her white limbs with his coarse hands.</p>

<p>Silas Hudson turned now to Lord Thralldom.</p>

<p>"There's one very curious thing about that man of mine my
lord," he said. "He's a very good fellow and very intelligent,
but he has no bump of veneration, and absolutely no appreciation
of the beautiful things in life. The other day I pointed out to
him the grave of one of the kings of England in Westminster
Abbey, and his only comment was that his mother had got a good
headstone too, over her grave in the cemetery at Bethnal Green.
Then I asked him, only yesterday, what he thought of your 'Man of
Sorrows' and he replied, 'All right at a distance, but it
wouldn't bear close looking into and that's why they've got that
rail up to keep people away.'"</p>

<p>The expression on Lord Thralldom's face was a pained one.
"What colossal ignorance!" he ejaculated. "It's pitiable."</p>

<p>"He ought to have his nose rubbed against the glass," growled
Captain Bonnett, "and then he'd know different."</p>

<p>"But he won't believe," went on Hudson, "that the closer you
examine a great painting, the more impressed you become at the
splendour and minuteness of its detail." He shook his head. "But
it annoys me that the man is so obstinate in his opinion."</p>

<p>"Well, you can show him he is wrong, if you want to," said
Lord Thralldom with a smile. "If it will be any satisfaction to
you, he can come into the gallery after lunch and we'll see if he
persists in his obstinacy."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed the American laughingly. "It will be amusing
to watch his face."</p>

<p>And so, when luncheon was over and coffee had been served to
them all in the gallery, with Lord Thralldom's permission, James
was despatched with a message to Hudson's servant in the
servants' hall.</p>

<p>"Tell him," said the American "that I want to speak to him,
and that he is to bring up the rheumatism tablets from the pocket
of my car; the rheumatism tablets, not the indigestion ones.
He'll know which are which." And a few minutes later Kelly
appeared in the gallery with the usual sullen expression on his
face.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Hudson when the tablets were handed over to
him. "We shall be going home shortly and you might see if any
water is wanted in the radiator of the car. Oh! by-the-bye," he
added, "you always say you'd like to examine this painting
here"&mdash;he indicated 'The Man of Sorrows'&mdash;"and his
lordship now very kindly gives his permission for you to do
so."</p>

<p>Kelly frowned as if he were annoyed for all eyes to be focused
upon him, and he stood hesitating, looking from his master to
Lord Thralldom and then back to his master again.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lord," he said at length and in a very gruff
tone. "I always wanted to look closely at one of those pictures,
but I've never had the chance." And walking up to the Rubens, he
bent his squat figure and passed under the rail.</p>

<p>"Don't touch it!" exclaimed Hudson in horrified tones, for
Kelly, not content with gluing his face as close as possible to
the glass, was laying his big hands upon it, and, seemingly,
pressing on it to see if it were firm.</p>

<p>"He won't hurt it," smiled Lord Thralldom now appearing quite
amused. "Take a good look at it, Thompson, and see if the painter
has put in anything wrong."</p>

<p>They all watched the slow and clumsy movements of the masseur,
as with his eyes never an inch away from the glass, he moved his
head slowly from side to side along the whole breadth of the
canvas and tapped upon the glass several times.</p>

<p>"Oh! it fits well, Thompson," laughed the American, "and not
one particle of dust will get inside if it hangs there for a
hundred years."</p>

<p>And then suddenly it came to Ann Devenham with a shock, that
both Hudson and his servant were playing a part. Yes, she was
sure of it. Hudson was like a showman who was exhibiting a
performing animal and the servant was acting as if it had all
been arranged beforehand exactly what he should do.</p>

<p>In a flash, her mind went back to the conversation in the
lounge before lunch and she saw how, step by step, her uncle had
been led up to the point of himself suggesting that the man
should be brought into the picture gallery and allowed to go
under the rail to have a close up view of the Rubens.</p>

<p>"And what does it all mean?" she asked herself and she caught
her breath in the possibility that might lie in the answer, for
she had never forgotten how sure she had been that it was only
through the scheming of Captain Bonnett that Silas Hudson had
been introduced into the castle.</p>

<p>But the play, if indeed it were a play, was soon over, for the
American's servant, apparently satisfied that he had seen all he
wanted to, ducked back under the rail and bowed jerkily to Lord
Thralldom.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lord," he said quietly. "I don't know how he
could have done it." And Lord Thralldom thought it a really fine
tribute to the genius of Peter Paul Rubens from a very simple-minded man.</p>

<p>That evening, just before eight, more disturbed than ever in
her mind, Ann went into the telephone cabinet and muted the
hammer of the bell as she had done before. A call came through
almost immediately and with a mingling of delight and
disappointment, she recognised it was John Harden's voice
again.</p>

<p>Larose had not returned to the inn, he told her, and there was
no news of him. His car was still in the garage. What should he,
John, do? He was telephoning from Minsmere Haven and was not two
miles away. There was an invitation in his voice.</p>

<p>Ann hesitated a moment and then, taking her courage in her
hands, gave a reply that thrilled and delighted the boy.</p>

<p>"Meet me in the garden, in exactly half an hour from now," she
said. "Go to the seat where we were the other day and wait for
me, if I'm not there when you arrive. Don't be seen by anybody if
you can help it." And she rang off with a frightened and very
guilty feeling at her heart.</p>

<p>Just before the half hour had elapsed, like a conspirator, she
went round to make sure where everyone was. Lord Thralldom and
Captain Bonnett were smoking in the library, her stepmother was
reading in the music room, and all the servants were apparently
in their quarters.</p>

<p>Ann unlocked the grille in the hall and pulled it to, without
latching it. She did the same to the front door. Then with her
heart bumping furiously, she ran quickly across the draw-bridge
and down into the garden in the further side.</p>

<p>She realised she must hurry, for it was beginning to get
dark.</p>

<p>She arrived at the seat where she had told John Harden he was
to meet her and, for the moment, consternation seized her, for
there was no one there. But young Harden stepped from behind a
tree and smilingly took the hand that she thankfully extended to
him.</p>

<p>"You told me not to be seen," he said softly, and the shadows
hid the colour in her cheeks as she realised suddenly that there
was now a secret between them. He would have held her hand
longer, but she drew it away.</p>

<p>"I'm very worried, John," she said with a little tremor and
slipping unconsciously into the use of his Christian name. "Oh! I
beg your pardon"&mdash;she went on correcting herself
quickly&mdash;"Mr. Harden, of course, I mean."</p>

<p>"No, John, from now, Ann," he said decisively and there was a
firmness in his voice that heartened her at once. "Now tell me
what it is?" And then with no hesitation she plunged into her
story.</p>

<p>She told him how she had fallen asleep in the chapel; how she
had wakened to see a man going through a door in the wall; how
terrified she had been; how she had told her uncle; with what
unbelief and then anger he had received her news, and how he had
made her promise to tell no one in the castle. Finally, she
mentioned her suspicions of the American and his servant, but for
pride's sake because Captain Bonnett was a connection of her
stepmother, she made no mention of the latter.</p>

<p>Young Harden listened without any comment, just standing and
looking down upon her, delighting his eyes to the full extent
that the quickly gathering darkness would allow him. Then with
her recital finished, he guided her gently to the big rustic seat
upon which they had sat at their last meeting in the garden.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Ann," he said quickly. "This certainly wants
looking into, and if we could have got in touch with Mr. Larose
he would have been the very man to have advised us." He thought
for a moment. "Now, are you quite certain it would be useless to
speak to your uncle again?"</p>

<p>"Quite," she replied. "It would only make him angry again, and
really I have nothing but my suspicions against Mr. Hudson."</p>

<p>"Well what about me calling upon Lord Thralldom now, straight
away," said Harden, "and then you taking me afterwards into the
chapel, as you did before, and I'll have a look to see if I can
find that secret door. I am a pretty good amateur carpenter and
might see a join in the panelling which both of you overlooked. I
have a wonderful excuse," he added smilingly, "for I have brought
up a cheque with me that arrived by post at the bank this
afternoon, that your uncle has paid in to us and not
endorsed."</p>

<p>Ann looked very uncomfortable. "It wouldn't do," she said
slowly. "My uncle wouldn't like it, and they wouldn't let me take
you into the chapel afterwards." She laid her hand lightly upon
his arm and went on in a shamed sort of way. "John, after you had
been the other evening, they were angry and said you must not be
asked again. Captain Bonnett had told them you came from the bank
and so"&mdash;her voice trembled&mdash;"because you have not had
so many wicked ancestors as I have had, they don't like
you"&mdash;she hesitated and picked her words very
carefully&mdash;"being my friend."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's it, is it?" said John grimly, and he spoke in
quiet ordinary matter-of-fact tones. "So they don't think I'm
good enough to be your friend." He smiled and nodded his head
approvingly. "And they are quite right and I don't disagree with
them." He paused a moment. "No one is really good enough." His
voice was very gentle. "And what does Ann say?"</p>

<p>The girl laughed nervously. "Ann comes to you for help, John,"
she replied, "and she's sure you'll give it her, too."</p>

<p>The boy looked her straight in the face and she, if very
flushed and hot, yet returned his look unflinchingly.</p>

<p>He waited just a moment and then, reaching out, pulled her
gently to him and kissed her once, very softly upon the lips. She
seemed to draw herself away, but then suddenly lifting up her
face to his, she kissed him back in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>And by both of them it had been done as if it were the most
natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>"Good!" said John Harden with a deep sigh. "Then that's that,
and we can now settle down to business." He gently imprisoned one
of her hands. "You must get me into the chapel, dear, and I'll
keep watch there to-night."</p>

<p>The girl gave a startled exclamation. "But, oh! John, you
couldn't."</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked briskly. "No one need know. I came on a
bicycle and I've got it hidden away in those bushes. I can go
away early in the morning. No one will miss me at my lodgings for
I often go out fishing all night. And I've got a good electric
torch. Things couldn't be better. Now, can you smuggle me in
without anyone seeing me?"</p>

<p>Ann sat with her brain in a whirl. "I could get you in," she
said hesitatingly, "that is if you went in at once before the
alarms are set, because I've left the doors open, but how about
getting you out in the morning?"</p>

<p>Young Harden rose quickly to his feet. "Come on," he said.
"The morning can take care of itself." He laughed lightly. "And
by then, perhaps, I may have earned the undying gratitude of your
uncle and he'll overlook that little matter of no unbeheaded
ancestors of mine." Literally sweeping Ann off her feet and
giving her no time to consider or draw back, he commenced to
hurry her towards the castle.</p>

<p>The big door was open as she had left it and so was the
grille, and now, closing both behind them, Ann led the way into
the chapel. They met no one upon their way and less than three
minutes from leaving the seat in the garden, were sitting behind
the curtain in front of the organ and breathlessly regarding each
other with feelings of triumph, in which, however, upon Ann's
part, was soon mingling not a little consternation at the
realisation of what she had done so hurriedly.</p>

<p>"And so great decisions are made," whispered young Harden
nodding his head. "No, don't worry, Ann," he went on quickly,
noting the troubled look upon the girl's face. "Everything will
be quite all right. We'll rest a minute or two and then when it's
dark, we'll have a look for that door. We'll be more likely to
find it with my torch then, than in the half light now." He
reached over and took her hand. "Now I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>But for the next few minutes there was not much talking done,
and indeed it seemed for the time that they had both forgotten
what had brought them there. They exchanged many kisses, and
there were long silences and many sighs.</p>

<p>"Won't they be wondering where you are?" he whispered
presently.</p>

<p>"No," she whispered back, "they'll only think I've gone to
bed. They never trouble about me." Then followed another silence
and the exaltation of the Cherubim and Seraphim in the stained
glass windows could surely have never surpassed that of John and
Ann.</p>

<p>But presently John flashed his torch. "Come on, darling," he
said, "and show me where you saw the man go in. It's heavenly
being with you like this, but we must do some work."</p>

<p>And so for half an hour and more they examined the panelling
where Ann had seen the open door, but again, as with Ann and her
uncle, all to no purpose. Nothing moved and everything was as
solid as a rock.</p>

<p>"But you believe me, John, don't you?" asked the girl at
last.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," he replied. "I never had a doubt about it.
That panelling is just where a secret door would be; the lines in
the carving would mask the opening so well."</p>

<p>And then suddenly both their hearts came into their mouths and
Ann clutched at John's arm in consternation. They had heard
footsteps, and then the deep voice of Lord Thralldom boomed just
outside the chapel door. "And always see this door is locked,
James," called out Lord Thralldom angrily, "and hang up the key
in its proper place in the hall. What are locks for unless they
are to be used. This door in particular is always being
forgotten." Then they heard the big key grate in the lock and the
sound of its being withdrawn, and the footsteps and the voices
died away.</p>

<p>"Oh! John," exclaimed Ann piteously and clinging to him, "what
shall we do? We're locked in."</p>

<p>But young Harden, if he were frightened, did not show it.</p>

<p>"Oh! we'll think of some way of getting out," he said
reassuringly. "I've got a big penknife with a screwdriver in it
and I may be able to pick the lock." He snapped off his torch and
struck a match. "But we'd better light that candle there and save
my torch." He bent down and kissed her. "Don't worry, dear, it'll
be all right."</p>

<p>But a very few seconds' inspection of the big door convinced
them, without any shadow of doubt that there was no chance of
picking the lock. There were no screws on their side of the door
and the oak was much too thick and hard to hack away.</p>

<p>"Well, it's no good us losing our heads," said John calmly,
"and we'll just think things over. Come and sit by the organ
again."</p>

<p>They sat together, side by side, and for a few moments neither
spoke. From the expression upon her face, Ann was now quite as
calm and collected as he was, but the quick rise and fall of her
bosom betokened the emotional distress she was in.</p>

<p>"I've got you into all this trouble, little one," John said
gently. "I ought never to have asked you to bring me up here.
It's all my fault." He reached for her hand and held it. "But
it's no good regretting it now."</p>

<p>"I don't regret it, John," she whispered softly, "whatever
happens to me." She answered the pressure of his hand. "It
doesn't matter," she went on with eyes shining tenderly in the
candlelight. "Nothing matters, now we know we are fond of each
other, dear."</p>

<p>"That's all very well for me, darling," smiled John happily,
and he drew her again to him, "but a girl's reputation is more
delicate than a man's, remember. Now what are we going to
do?"</p>

<p>Ann spoke quickly. "Well, it would be no good calling for help
now. It wouldn't make things even a little bit better." She
laughed nervously. "My reputation's gone in any case." She became
most matter-of-fact all at once. "Now, this is our only chance.
Rosa, the under-housemaid will come in here to dust, at seven to-morrow morning. She's a good girl and I can trust her. I'll
explain what's happened and she won't say a word to anybody. Then
about getting you out of the castle. Uncle switches off the
alarms from the control board in his bedroom directly the
servants are about, but you'll have to wait in here until just
after nine when we shall all be at breakfast. Then I'll make an
excuse and leave the table and let you out."</p>

<p>"And that means," said John slowly, "that amongst other
things"&mdash;his voice was husky&mdash;"you've got to pass about
eight hours here in that thin dress and"&mdash;he shook his
head&mdash;"it's going to be very cold."</p>

<p>She averted her eyes from his. "Then we'll take down the organ
curtains," she said. "They'll be dusty but better than nothing."
She nodded her head. "You shall have that side of the chapel,
John, and I'll have this and we can talk across to one another
until we go to sleep.</p>

<p>"No," said John firmly, "we'll keep together for a time yet.
Remember, whoever's using that secret door may be coming here any
moment."</p>

<p>She laughed in amusement now. "Oh! I had quite forgotten about
it. Hadn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he laughed back. "I never thought of it until this
moment. We had our own big trouble to worry about. Now, I think
we'd better put out that candle and watch. I see it's not going
to be quite dark. There's a little moon."</p>

<p>Then, hand in hand, they sat and whispered together with many
moments of silence, beyond all words, in between. They spoke of
the wonder of the life that would lie before them; how they would
be married soon and then how happy they would be.</p>

<p>"But I've no money, John," said Ann presently. "You'll be
marrying quite a penniless girl."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven for that," replied young Harden instantly. "You
don't want money with a face like yours."</p>

<p>"And uncle will never give his consent," went on Ann. "We
shall have to go off without telling anyone."</p>

<p>"All the better," said John, "and then there'll be no
fuss."</p>

<p>Presently he looked at his watch. It had seemed to them as if
a few minutes only had passed, but it was nearly two o'clock.</p>

<p>"And now you'll go to sleep," said John masterfully. "I'll
tuck you up here and then go and lie down in one of those pews. I
don't feel sleepy and shall go on keeping watch. No, I'll not
kiss you any more. You've had quite enough, and besides"&mdash;he
pushed her gently away from him&mdash;"I never know when to
stop."</p>

<p>He tucked her up in the big seat of the organ and then
crossing the aisle, stretched himself out in one of the pews and,
with a hassock under his head, prepared to make himself as
comfortable as possible.</p>

<p>Ten minutes&mdash;twenty&mdash;perhaps half an hour passed,
and then a small voice came from the direction of the organ.</p>

<p>"Are you asleep, John?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not. Don't talk. Try and go to sleep
yourself."</p>

<p>Five minutes&mdash;ten&mdash;perhaps a quarter of an hour
passed and then came the small voice again,</p>

<p>"I'm cold, John. I'm shivering. Come over to me, please."</p>

<p>John shivered too, but it was not from cold. "You're a bad
little girl," he said, "and it's a nurse, not a husband, that I
see you want." Then switching on his torch, and carrying his
share of the curtain he walked towards where she was lying by the
organ.</p>

<p>And then surely, under the dim moonlight there, the saints and
angels in the stained-glass windows of the old chapel were mute
witnesses of the strangest happening of all their eight hundred
and more years.</p>

<p>Many a fair maid had they watched walk up the aisle, that
after due ceremony and in course of time she might bear babes of
the Thralldom blood to carry on the Thralldom line, and many of
these babes had they seen later baptised at the font.</p>

<p>But now, they were beholding a maiden of the Thralldom blood,
unwedded and unblest by sacrament of Mother Church, asleep in the
arms of a man to whom she was bound by no ties, and whose very
lips, even, had not touched hers until within a few short hours
ago.</p>

<p>And she was sleeping so peacefully, too, with her head upon
his shoulder, just for all the world as if under his protection
she was assured there could be no danger and she need have no
fear.</p>

<p>The man was wide awake and although he looked round, from time
to time, his eyes were never long away from the girl's face.</p>

<p>It was thus as they were, when just as dawn was breaking,
Larose pulled back the secret panel and stepped into the chapel.
There had been no appearance of Croupin in the dungeons and the
detective, according to the arrangement made with the chef, had
come up in search of food.</p>

<p>The sliding back of the panel made a slight noise and young
Harden, hearing it, instantly jerked his head round and riveted
his eyes in the direction from which the sound had come.</p>

<p>He saw Larose before Larose saw him and, realising in a flash
what was happening, disentangled himself from the sleeping girl
and springing up, advanced to interrupt the detective, just as
the latter had pulled the panel back into its place.</p>

<p>Ann awoke with a start and sat up. Larose heard the noise
behind him, and the strike of a snake could not have been swifter
than his movements in turning to face young Harden.</p>

<p>He realised instantly that Harden's intentions were
unfriendly, for the boy's face was grim and set and he had all
the appearance about him of one who was about to grapple with an
enemy.</p>

<p>But Larose recognised him in two seconds and called out
quickly, though not loudly.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Mr. Harden. Quite all right. I'm Larose, the
detective from Scotland Yard." And then, seeing the white-faced
Ann behind the organ rails, he exclaimed in amazed
surprise&mdash;"Good Heavens! but what's Miss Devenham doing
here?"</p>

<p>Then it seemed that Ann herself was the first of them to
recover from the surprise, for springing up and smoothing down
the crumples in her dress, she advanced quickly to the
detective.</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Larose," she exclaimed, "then it was you I saw going
in there the other night?"</p>

<p>The detective held up a warning hand. "Hush!" he said sharply.
"Don't speak so loudly. We mustn't be heard."</p>

<p>"But what is beyond that door?" asked Ann with widely opened
eyes. "And what are you doing there? Does my uncle know?"</p>

<p>"Three questions, young lady," replied the detective, "and I
can't answer them all at once. But what are you and Mr. Harden
here for at this time of the morning?"</p>

<p>"We are locked in," replied John Harden grimly, "and we can't
get out. That's why we are here."</p>

<p>"But who locked you in?" asked Larose. "And have you been here
all night?"</p>

<p>A hot wave of crimson surged over Ann's face and neck, but she
moved defiantly up to Harden's side and slipped her arm through
his.</p>

<p>"Two questions, Mr. Larose," she replied with a bow, "and like
you, we shall find it easier to answer one question at a
time."</p>

<p>"Good," said the detective and his face broke into a grim
smile. "I see we shall have to exchange confidences."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Harden looking very stern, "but before we go any
farther, I'd like to know if it's with Lord Thralldom's
permission that you are acting as you are."</p>

<p>"No," replied Larose instantly, "Lord Thralldom is not aware
that I am here and for the time being it is not in his best
interests that he should know." He looked every bit as stern as
young Harden. "I am acting on behalf of the Crown and in my
capacity as an officer from Scotland Yard." He turned sharply to
Ann. "And now Miss Devenham, will you please tell me when you saw
anyone using this door before?"</p>

<p>And then Ann related quickly everything that had happened from
the time of her falling asleep at the organ, two nights
previously, to the moment when they had heard Lord Thralldom
speaking outside the chapel door and he had locked them in.</p>

<p>"We didn't call to anyone to let us out, Mr. Larose," she
added, with her head held very high, "because I knew I had broken
the spirit of my promise to my uncle by asking Mr. Harden to try
and find you, and I was sure he would have been furious with me
for doing it."</p>

<p>Young Harden had listened to her recital with swiftly
quickening feelings of anger against himself for, with the
appearance of Larose, he was now realising for the first time the
dreadful interpretation outsiders might put upon his night in the
chapel with Ann. Alone with her, everything had seemed paltry and
insignificant in the light of the ecstasy of her companionship,
but now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Larose turned sharply to him and asked frowningly, "What time
were you locked in?"</p>

<p>"At about half past nine," he replied, now getting very red in
his turn, "and I saw at once that it was hopeless to pick the
lock." He spoke hoarsely. "Of course it was a tragic mistake upon
my part, Mr. Larose, that I asked Miss Devenham to bring me here,
for I am not a welcome visitor to the castle at any time. But it
was all done on the spur of the moment and then when we were
locked in"&mdash;he looked challengingly at the
detective&mdash;"I judged it best from the certain censure that
would follow if we were discovered, to remain on here until we
were released in the morning." He was trying hard to keep his
voice under control. "It was the lesser of two evils."</p>

<p>"And you did quite right, John," said Ann decisively, "and I
shall always thank you for it." She turned to the detective. "My
uncle would never have forgiven me if he had found out that I had
acted contrary to his wishes, and it might have brought on all
his illness again if he had known." She nodded her head
emphatically to the detective. "Yes, whatever may be the
consequences to me, Mr. Harden did the right thing."</p>

<p>Larose smiled kindly at her. "And there shall be no
consequences, Miss Devenham," he said briskly, "for we will
arrange that it shall be a secret between us three." He corrected
himself quickly. "Between us three and one other who will have to
be taken into our confidence."</p>

<p>"But where does that door lead to?" asked Ann, her curiosity
now beginning to overcome her embarrassment.</p>

<p>"To the castle dungeons," replied the detective, "and I have
been watching among them now for two nights and a day."</p>

<p>"But what are you doing there?" went on the girl.</p>

<p>Larose hesitated a moment. "It would probably have been better
for the peace of mind of us all," he said gravely, "if you had
not come upon me in this way, for now I have no option but to
take you into my confidence and tell you things that are not
pretty, at any rate for a young girl, to hear." He frowned. "You
are both of you almost strangers to me, but now I have to entrust
you with a secret, upon the keeping of which my very life may
depend."</p>

<p>"You need have no worry about that, Mr. Larose," said Harden
quietly, "for it would be unfortunate for us to have to explain
under what circumstances you were compelled to give us your
confidence."</p>

<p>The detective laughed softly. "Quite a good answer, sir," he
said, "and I believe I shall be safe." He nodded his head.
"Besides, if I am any judge of character, I cannot imagine either
of you are cowards. Now listen to me." He spoke very slowly. "I
am waiting down there for the coming of a man who is using those
dark chambers for a very dreadful purpose. We are not certain who
the man is, and we cannot determine as yet whether he comes from
inside the castle or is a stranger who has effected an entrance
through some passage that he has discovered, leading in from
outside. At any rate he is mad"&mdash;he paused a
moment&mdash;"and is a murderer."</p>

<p>"A murderer!" gasped Ann. "And he may live inside the castle!
Oh! who can you suspect here?"</p>

<p>"The footman, William," was the stem reply. "There are very
strong suspicions against him, for we know for certain that he
has been rifling the coffins in the vaults."</p>

<p>"My God!" came from the girl. "And William is near us all,
night and day." Her eyes dilated in horror. "But whom do you
suspect him of murdering?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Rawlings, for one," snapped Larose, "and perhaps others.
Mind you," he went on, "we have no absolute proof yet that the
bailiff is dead, but we believe he is and that his body lies
buried somewhere down below. As I have said, the murderer we are
waiting for is a madman, and if it indeed be William, then having
discovered a secret passage leading out under the moat from the
castle, he has been going on to the marshes, night after night,
and attacking anyone whom he has chanced to meet."</p>

<p>Then he proceeded to relate, in part, the discoveries that
Antoine had made about the footman; how the chef had passed them
on to him, Larose, and how they had gone together into the
dungeons two nights previously.</p>

<p>"And is Monsieur Antoine then a detective too?" asked Ann
incredulously.</p>

<p>"No," replied Larose, suppressing a smile, "but he is an old
friend of mine and after we had met by chance in the servants'
hall the other day, he came to me the same night and told
everything he had found out." He nodded. "You can trust him as
you would Mr. Harden here."</p>

<p>"Well, what are we going to do now?" asked Ann, too stunned to
suggest anything herself.</p>

<p>"You're going to help us," said the detective, "and the very
knowledge that you are doing so will steady your nerves and
lessen your sense of fear." He smiled. "And for a reward, the
first thing I am going to do is to get you out of your trouble
here. Presently, I will take Mr. Harden back through that door
and when the housemaid comes at seven, she will find you here
alone. Then, you will have to speak to Monsieur Antoine and tell
him exactly how things are and later bring some food and water
for me and leave it under one of the pews here. Now, pull
yourself together, young lady, and think how Mr. Harden can be
got out of the castle, without anyone seeing him."</p>

<p>They talked together for a long while, and it was only almost
upon the very stroke of seven that the detective and John Harden
disappeared behind the panelling. The detective went in first
and, for quite a long moment, stood with his back turned towards
the lovers, pretending to make sure there were no sounds coming
up from the spiral staircase below.</p>

<p>The panel closed behind them and alone at last, Ann sank back
into one of the pews, physically and mentally exhausted. Her
dress was soiled and rumpled, her face was all smudged over and
her hair was all dishevelled. She was just worn out with the
varying emotions of the night and her mind was torn and wounded
with the memory of the horrors that the detective had
outlined.</p>

<p>But for all that she did not look unhappy. Her eyes were
bright and sparkling, her cheeks were flushed daintily and there
was a curve, a very tender curve, about the corners of her
mouth.</p>

<p>She looked in the direction of the organ many times and smiled
and blushed and sighed.</p>

<p>Very little more than an hour later, Miss Ann Devenham, the
grand-niece of Lord Thralldom, walked into the big kitchen of the
castle and asked Antoine, the chef, for a lemon rind for her
hands.</p>

<p>She looked spick and span and as fresh and sweet as a morning
rose.</p>

<p>The chef was busy in his preparations for breakfast and there
were two maids with him.</p>

<p>Ann thanked him graciously for the lemon and then remarked
with a pretty smile, "And I suppose, Monsieur Antoine, one of the
things you miss over here is hearing your beautiful language
spoken?"</p>

<p>"But yes, Mademoiselle," replied the chef smilingly, "Zere is
much beauty in zis country"&mdash;he bowed gallantly&mdash;"but
ze words spoken are not like zose of my beloved Paris."</p>

<p>And then Ann rapped out in French, very sharply, but still
preserving the pretty smile upon her face,</p>

<p>"Don't show any surprise. I'm going to drop my handkerchief.
Follow me out into the hall with it. I want to speak to you most
urgently. It's about your friend in the vaults."</p>

<p>The Frenchman's heart beat violently, but his face continued
to be all smiles. "I will follow at once, Mademoiselle," he
replied quickly, and speaking also in his own tongue, "but if you
can help it, don't let that footman with the long face see us
talking together."</p>

<p>And then for two minutes in the hall Ann issued her
instructions rapidly. "I know everything," she said, "and am
helping Mr. Larose. Be in the garden by the artichokes just
before ten. In the meantime, exactly at a quarter past nine,
manage somehow to keep all the maids in the kitchen. I want to
keep the hall clear, for a friend of mine to get away from the
castle. Mr. Larose is quite all right."</p>

<p>"<i>Bien</i>, Mademoiselle," exclaimed the bewildered chef.
"It shall be done as you order."</p>

<p>And so, at a quarter past nine exactly, young Harden passed
like a shadow out of the castle, unhindered, and unseen by
everyone except Ann. He seemed to be in a great hurry, but for
all that he had time enough to pause for one long and passionate
moment to embrace the flushing Ann.</p>

<p>Later in the morning, it was reported to Lady Deering that
there had been a most regrettable accident in the kitchen for,
just after breakfast, the chef had had the misfortune to break
one of the large, old-fashioned, hundreds-of-years old soup
tureens.</p>

<p>Her ladyship was most annoyed at the clumsiness of the
chef.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; THE DREADFUL VIGIL</h2>

<p class="first">TWO days and two nights had passed and Larose
was still watching for the coming of that assassin, who in some
recess of those dark chambers had secreted the bodies of the
murdered dead. He was certain that he was upon the right trail,
and that down the side of that gruesome slab had dripped the
blood of more than one victim whose last remains he was now
seeking.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful vigil, for night and day were the same to
him in the darkness there, and it was by his watch only that he
could determine when day had dawned or night had fallen.</p>

<p>At first he had searched feverishly to find either an opening
in the walls that would disclose a passage down under the moat,
or one that would lead him to where the bodies had been buried,
but he had soon come to realise that only by a miracle, almost,
would he be successful in either quest.</p>

<p>He was hampered so greatly by the poor light at his service,
for it was only by candlelight that he could search. His torch
would have soon run down and he had to conserve that for an
emergency. He dared not light the lantern that he had seen in the
vaults, because with the coming of whomsoever had been using it,
the smell of the burning oil might warn him as he approached.
Besides there was not more than two or three hours' oil left in
the lantern.</p>

<p>So, in the end, he had come to the conclusion that the only
thing for him to do, was to wait with what patience he could and
let the assassin himself be the guide who should lead him to the
places he was searching for.</p>

<p>But with two nights passing with no one appearing in the
dungeons, a feeling of great depression began to take possession
of him. The dungeons were so cold and chilling and from time to
time he shivered violently as if he were going to become
downright ill.</p>

<p>He was weakening, too, for want of proper sleep. One fold of
the blanket was all there was between him and the hard flags and
his only pillow was his arm.</p>

<p>The rats which at first were only an annoyance, had speedily
become a positive torture, for their incessant squeaking was the
least of their activities.</p>

<p>In the darkness they never for one moment left him alone, and
at last, in desperation, he tried to sleep with the candle
burning. But after a while even that made no difference, for they
took to running boldly over him, and twice he was awakened by one
of them actually biting him.</p>

<p>When he was eating his sandwiches, too, their beady eyes were
always upon him, and when he dropped a crumb, they dashed for it
as if they were expecting him to feed them.</p>

<p>He had seen nothing of Croupin, but upon both mornings just
before five, had crept up into the castle for his food, to learn
then from a cryptic message under the leg of the kitchen table,
that the Frenchman was certain he was still being watched and
accordingly was going to take no risks. Larose had left a message
in return, that all was well.</p>

<p>So things were, when towards noon upon the fourth day of his
vigil a great catastrophe occurred. His watch stopped and he had
no longer any means of learning the time.</p>

<p>He did not awake to the calamity at first, but between fitful
snatches of sleep began to worry subconsciously, how slowly the
hours were passing, and he had flashed his torch three times to
see what the time was, before it came to him what had actually
happened.</p>

<p>"Still not midday," he had murmured with his eyes half closed,
"and I can hardly have slept at all." Then the third time, the
position of the hands seemed strangely familiar to him, and with
a cry of dismay, he sat up with a jerk and held the watch up to
his ear. There was no tick in it and it had stopped at ten
minutes to twelve. He shook it and opened it and shook it again,
but to no purpose. Some of the dust of the dungeons had got in
and it was as dead as a nail.</p>

<p>He was in dismay for now, he realised, there could be no
pretence of sleep at all. He must remain awake until he dropped
from sheer exhaustion and then that would be the end of all this
fine adventure upon which he had set such hopes.</p>

<p>"No, no, Gilbert," he said, bracing himself up, "this will
never do. You're made of better stuff than that. You're not
beaten by a long way yet. Where's your resource, my boy?" He
smiled weakly. "You'll have to take a greater risk, that's
all."</p>

<p>So he left the dungeon where he had been lying, and with
unsteady steps negotiated the corridor and climbed up the spiral
staircase to the panel behind the chapel wall. He stood listening
there for a long time, but all was quiet, and he slid back the
secret door. The chapel was empty and he drew in big draughts of
the purer air.</p>

<p>"Now, if I'd only thought of it," he frowned, "I could have
made this a place of rendezvous with the charming Ann, but it's
too late now."</p>

<p>The light from the stained glass window, dim as it was, made
his eyes blink. "There's no sun," he whispered, "and it may be
any time after two o'clock."</p>

<p>Greatly daring, he crept to the chapel door and opened it a
little way. He heard the cheerful sounds of people moving about,
the sounds of distant voices and once someone laughed. Growing
bolder, he crept into the passage and tiptoeing along its entire
length, craned his head round the corner. He could hear the
voices much plainer then and soon came the chink of cups and
saucers.</p>

<p>"Ah! afternoon tea in the lounge?" he exclaimed longingly. He
sighed. "That should make it about four o'clock." He blinked his
eyes wearily. "But oh! I'm so tired and I shall drop if I don't
get some sleep."</p>

<p>But suddenly he straightened himself up with animation, for an
idea had come to him. "I'll have a nap in the chapel," he
exclaimed. He smiled with something of his old vivacity coming
back. "I'll sleep where the charming Ann slept, although I can
hardly hope to have such happy dreams."</p>

<p>So, in two minutes he was settling himself back luxuriously in
the big seat before the organ, where three nights previously Ann
Devenham had lain sleeping in her lover's arms.</p>

<p>"No, I'll not lie down," he whispered, "or goodness knows when
I shall wake up. Just a little doze," he went on drunkenly, "and
at any rate, there'll be some peace from those rats. It'll revive
me a bit anyhow."</p>

<p>However, he did not by any means derive the benefit that he
was expecting, for the whole time his sleep was nothing but a
series of short dozes, with him waking up every few minutes and
harassing his mind with each awakening as to whether he had been
asleep too long.</p>

<p>A dozen times and more he forced himself into complete
wakefulness to make certain the light was not waning through the
stained-glass windows, and as many times again, he crept out of
the chapel door to determine by any sounds that he might hear, as
to how near the hour of darkness was approaching.</p>

<p>At last, upon one of these excursions into the passage, he no
longer heard anyone talking, but now the faint aroma of the
preparation of food was wafted to him.</p>

<p>"Dinner!" he murmured brokenly. "A hot dinner with good things
to drink! Then later, a hot bath perhaps, and a divine sleep in
some comfortable bed!" He frowned angrily. "Oh! what a fool I am,
when I might have the life of a happy human being, instead of
always going upon this infernal crime stunt." But a smile quickly
replaced the frown. "No, no, Gilbert, you're not built that way.
The gods made you a very foolish man."</p>

<p>He rubbed his eyes vigorously with his knuckles to dispel as
much desire for sleep as possible and proceeded down into the
dungeons again.</p>

<p>"After to-night, my boy," he said sadly, "you'll have to alter
all your plans. You're coming to the end of your tether and with
all the spirit in the world, you can't go without sleep for ever.
You never bargained for this long watch."</p>

<p>Mentally, if not physically, refreshed by his incursion up
into the chapel, he returned to the dungeon that he was making
his temporary home. It was the one nearest to the steps leading
down into the vaults and he had chosen it in preference to any
other because he was sure that it was about there would lie the
opening to the passage under the moat, and reclining upon his
blanket in the corner, he would have a clear view, too, of the
slab upon which he had found those sinister traces of blood.</p>

<p>He pulled the door half to, as he always did, and then
proceeded to take down his blanket from where he had stuffed it,
high up in a wide crevice in the wall.</p>

<p>But he trod on something soft, and flashing his torch down, a
cry of fury escaped him. His blanket had been torn to shreds and
there was not a piece in sight larger than the palm of a child's
hand.</p>

<p>He shivered violently. "Oh! well, it is my own fault," he
exclaimed woefully. "I ought to have taken it with me. Now, I
shall have a dreadful night."</p>

<p>And it required no great gift of prophecy to make him realise
very quickly that in this last surmise he was going to be quite
correct.</p>

<p>He sat huddled in a corner on the bare stone in the darkness
and he was soon in what he considered must surely be the last
state of misery.</p>

<p>He was depressed with the thought of the long hours of torture
that lay before him; he was chilled to the bone and shivering
violently; also, he was deadly tired and almost sick for want of
sleep. But it was the rats that were his greatest torment. He
dared not light a candle, for it was now approaching towards that
hour when if anyone were coming down into the vaults he would
arrive soon, and, as before, they gave him no peace. As long as
he was upon his feet and flashing the light upon them, they kept
their distance, but directly he sat down and extinguished the
torch, they swarmed upon him from all directions.</p>

<p>Unhappily, he had no satisfactory weapon with which to beat
them off, but he struck continuously at them with a big lump of
stone, and time after time, exasperated almost to the point of
frenzy, jumped to his feet and scattered them.</p>

<p>All the time, however, it was with the greatest difficulty
that he could keep awake, even when he was in the very act of
repulsing his tormentors.</p>

<p>So, the hours dragged on until he reckoned it could not be far
off eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>Then suddenly it seemed as if the rats had at last had enough,
for immediately after one of his fierce dashes upon them, they
all in a moment turned and scampered off. He was too tired to
feel in the least degree surprised at their departure and sinking
back exhausted, in a minute at the longest was fast asleep.</p>

<p>But his sleep had only lasted a very little time when they
were back all round him again, and he was awakened by one of them
running over his face.</p>

<p>Then the battle commenced all anew but it was a very wearied
man now who was defending himself. Indeed, after a while his
actions seemed to have become almost mechanical, and he
alternately kicked with his feet and thrust out with the hand
that held the blood-stained stone.</p>

<p>A long while passed, hours and hours the detective thought,
and then as suddenly as before, all the rats left him, and in a
few seconds, in spite of almost superhuman efforts, he was asleep
again.</p>

<p>He had no idea as to how long the respite lasted and it was
not the rats who finally broke into his troubled dreams. It was
something quite different this time.</p>

<p>He had many times been stirring in his sleep as if some
subconscious warning were being given him, and at length half-awakened and drawing in a deep breath preparatory to a long sigh,
his nostrils were assailed with an unaccustomed odour.</p>

<p>He shook his head vexatiously, not willing to be disturbed,
but he had not smoked now for four days and his sense of smell
was in consequence very keen, and soon, very soon, he found
himself wide awake and sniffing hard, with his eyes blinking
bewilderedly into the darkness.</p>

<p>Then all at once, he sprang to his feet as if no such things
as exhaustion or weariness existed.</p>

<p>He had recognised the smell at last. It was that of burning
oil!</p>

<p>Someone had just passed along the corridor with a lighted
lantern!</p>

<p>He darted to the half opened door and with dilated pupils
stared up and down the corridor. All was black and empty and he
could see no light or hear no sound anywhere. Indeed so quiet was
everything that the hush filled him with foreboding for it was
exactly as if some greater force for evil than they had terrified
the rats, and in the presence of some danger that they knew, they
had swept panic-stricken into their holes.</p>

<p>But if the sudden silence was inexplicable, the explanation of
the smell that had awakened him was very clear and definite, for
the instant he stepped out into the corridor the reek of burning
oil was almost nauseating in its strength. Not only had someone
passed with a lantern but he had been carrying it with the wick
turned too high and it had been smoking badly.</p>

<p>For a long minute the detective stood in the darkness, almost
holding his breath in his excitement, and straining eyes and ears
for some sight or sound.</p>

<p>But he saw nothing and he heard nothing and he bit hard upon
his lips to make certain everything were not a dream.</p>

<p>Then he flashed his torch round and instantly he gave a gasp
of horror and pressed his hand upon his heart for it had started
to throb so violently.</p>

<p>Upon the slab at the entrance to the vaults was outstretched
the body of a man and from its overhanging head, the ghastly
pallor of its face, and its sagging open mouth, it could only be
that the man was dead.</p>

<p>The detective clenched his jaws together like a steel trap,
and invigorated as if he had imbibed a deep draught of wine,
sprang over to the slab and touched the body. It was still
warm.</p>

<p>Switching off his torch for a second to make certain that his
was the only light in the corridor, he snapped it on again
quickly and took a searching look at the body.</p>

<p>It was that of a man unknown to him and he was neither young
nor old. His appearance was refined and he had long white hands,
upon one finger of which was a signet ring. At the back of the
head was a dreadful gaping wound.</p>

<p>But the detective snapped off his torch and darted to the
entrance of the dungeon again, for he had heard a faint sound in
the distance, up along the corridor.</p>

<p>He stood, hardly daring to breathe, with his head just round
the dungeon door.</p>

<p>One minute, two minutes went by, and then about seventy or
eighty yards away a glow of light appeared in the corridor. It
came from the floor of the corridor itself, and a few seconds
later it gave a shadow to a flag-stone, upraised, and at right
angles to the walls. Then a long arm, holding a lantern, came
into view and lifted the lantern out into the corridor, then the
head and shoulders of a man appeared and finally, the man himself
stepped out, and picking up the lantern began to walk slowly
towards that end of the corridor where the detective was hiding
behind the opened dungeon door.</p>

<p>Larose darted back a few feet into the dungeon and with his
body pressed up closely to the wall, and almost suffocated in his
excitement, awaited the coming of the bearer of the lantern.</p>

<p>His heart was beating like a sledge-hammer.</p>

<p>"At last, at last," ran his exultant thoughts, "in a few
seconds the assassin will be unmasked. I will wait until he has
passed the door and then spring upon him and bring him down. I
shall not need to use my pistol."</p>

<p>The lantern swayed and swayed and the man came nearer and
nearer. Larose could hear his shuffling footsteps and his heavy
breathing.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the totally unexpected happened, for in passing
the dungeon where Larose was hidden, either of deliberate purpose
because the detective had unwittingly left it jutting too far
into the corridor, or just by chance, the man lurched against the
open door and banged it to.</p>

<p>Two moments of agonising suspense ensued for Larose as the big
iron bar outside quivered ominously against the door. Then it
crashed down noisily into its heavy socket and the suspense was
over&mdash;for the detective knew he was a prisoner.</p>

<p>The man with the lantern passed on and shuffled down the steps
into the vaults.</p>

<p>A sweat of fury burst upon the forehead of Larose, but by no
gesture or exclamation did he betray his discomfiture. He was
mortified beyond all words, but it was his life's training to
remain cool and unflurried in great crises.</p>

<p>He threw himself down at full length upon the stones and glued
his eyes upon the narrow crack below the door.</p>

<p>A few moments passed and then came the unmistakable sounds of
the man returning.</p>

<p>But he shuffled along even more slowly this time and panting
hard, swayed the lantern more than ever. He soon passed out of
hearing, however, and the light faded away.</p>

<p>It was about five minutes before the detective heard any other
sound, and then it was a distant thump as if the upraised flag
that he had seen had been dropped into its place.</p>

<p>The light, however, did not return and once again silence
reigned.</p>

<p>"He's not passed again, at any rate," whispered the detective
hoarsely, "and therefore, whoever he was, he must have come from
inside the castle,"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"unless he has not
gone away yet." He nodded emphatically. "But I was right in what
I thought. The entrance to the passage under the moat is
somewhere by the vaults and he lays the bodies each time upon
that slab after he has brought them in." He shuddered. "But who
was that last poor wretch?"</p>

<p>A few minutes went by and then the rats began to squeal again.
He rose stiffly to his feet with a wan smile. "Yes, he's gone
right enough and they think they're safe now. They evidently know
him and are more afraid of him than they are of me. Anyhow, they
won't trouble me now, for if I cannot get out, they cannot get in
and I shall have some peace at last." He shook his head
disgustedly. "But I ought to have thought about that bar and
jammed it, so that it couldn't fall."</p>

<p>He returned to his position in the comer and wearily fussed
his hand over his forehead. "Now, of course, I shall have to
remain shut up here all night, but to-morrow morning when Croupin
sees I have not been up for my food, he'll, he'll&mdash;&mdash;"
But he was so exhausted that he could not think coherently and
after a few seconds closed his eyes, and tried to forget
everything in sleep.</p>

<p>But cruelly enough, sleep would not come to him now. His brain
was in a whirl, and confused and rambling thoughts circled
insistently through his mind. He was so cold and stiff, too, and
although so tired, could not keep his limbs still.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he pulled himself together and his heart began
to beat tumultuously once more, for all in an instant the
squealings of the rats had become accentuated to an extraordinary
degree, and he heard the pad of quickly rushing footsteps as if
someone were now chasing them and striking at them with some
heavy implement like a spade. A light, too, flashed again under
the door, but it was not the lantern this time, for the flash as
it passed was too steady to be anything but that of an electric
torch.</p>

<p>Then came low chuckling laughs in quick spasmodic jerks, as if
the laugher were laughing with his mouth shut.</p>

<p>"Mad! mad!" ejaculated the detective wearily, "and so, he's
not yet sated his lust for blood. No wonder the rats scuttled off
when he came! They knew what to expect."</p>

<p>The sounds soon died down in the corridor nearby, but they
were repeated at short intervals in more distant parts of the
underground passages and Larose could distinctly hear what he was
now sure was the thud of a spade.</p>

<p>Four times he heard the thuddings, with the squealings each
time rising to a crescendo and then everything stopped as
suddenly as it had begun. By then, however, a feeling of such
utter prostration had come over him that he had lost interest in
all that was happening.</p>

<p>The next morning Croupin was very worried. He had seen that
Larose had not been up for his provisions and he did not dare to
risk a lightning visit to the dungeons, because he was positive
that William was watching his, Croupin's, every movement. He
could not move anywhere out of the kitchen without finding the
footman, upon one excuse or another, always at his heels.</p>

<p>But he considered it vital that he should know what was
happening to Larose, and, from the moment of finding that the
provisions had not been fetched, he taxed his fertile brain to
think of some way of getting in touch with the detective, and at
last, while he was preparing the breakfast for the family, he hit
upon an idea.</p>

<p>He had not seen Ann to speak to since their meeting three days
previously in the kitchen garden by the bed of artichokes, but
their conversation then had impressed him with the strength of
the girl's character, and he now determined to appeal to her and
induce her to go down into the dungeon and see what had happened
to Larose.</p>

<p>"But she will not like it, the pretty one," he sighed, "to go
down into the darkness among those rats, but she has the courage
of those wicked ancestors of hers and when I tell her how serious
things are, she will not refuse."</p>

<p>So he cut a lemon in two halves and also a small Jerusalem
artichoke, and placing the four pieces upon a plate among some
dainty paper frills, instructed one of the housemaids to take
them up at once to Miss Devenham's room.</p>

<p>"And you be quick, Rose," he said looking very distressed.
"Zey were to have gone up by eight o'clock and she will be very
angry. Tell ze beautiful miss I am so sorry but I forget and I
hope she will forgive me."</p>

<p>The girl looked at the plate. "But what's that artichoke for?"
she asked, "What is the use of that?"</p>

<p>The chef threw out his hands. "Why, for ze finger nails, of
course." He smiled pityingly. "Zey always use zem in France. Now
you go up quick, or I get ze sack, Oh! and mind and see if she is
angry," he called out as the girl was leaving the kitchen. "You
will tell by ze look on her face."</p>

<p>The girl was back again almost at once. "And she was not
angry?" asked the chef for all the world as if he depended for
his very life upon the answer he was going to receive.</p>

<p>"No," smiled the girl. "She just looked very hard at the
artichoke to see if you had given her a nice one and then said
'It's quite all right, tell Monsieur Antoine.'"</p>

<p>The chef was delighted. "Ah!" he exclaimed, "she have a most
sweet disposition! I knew she had."</p>

<p>Soon after breakfast Croupin, having all the time kept a close
watch from the kitchen window, saw Ann walking in the garden, and
he quickly made his way there, too, carrying a small basket upon
his arm.</p>

<p>"I will get my own vegetables zis day," he had announced to
the girls. "Zat gardener pick ze first one he sees and have no
judgment."</p>

<p>He passed Ann with a deferential bow, without speaking, but
then having proceeded a few yards, he stopped suddenly and turned
back as if she had called him.</p>

<p>"You are wonderful, Miss Devenham," he said smiling, "and I
knew you would guess that I wanted to speak to you." His face
became very grave. "I have something serious to tell you and I
want you to do something for me."</p>

<p>Ann regarded him curiously and with a certain feeling of
annoyance. There was almost a note of authority in his tone, she
thought, and he&mdash;the castle chef!</p>

<p>"Quick! turn your back to the windows," Croupin went on. "They
may be watching and see your face. I was on the stage once and
they will get nothing from mine."</p>

<p>Ann complied frowningly and Croupin threw out his hands with
his face again all smiles, but when he spoke it was very
sternly.</p>

<p>"Miss Devenham," he said quickly, "I have a favour to ask of
you. No," he corrected himself, "because so much depends upon it
it is almost an order that I am going to give you."</p>

<p>"An order, Monsieur!" ejaculated Ann. "You give me an
order&mdash;you?"</p>

<p>"And it will be no disrespect if I do, Mademoiselle," replied
Croupin sharply, "for my ancestors were such as yours. My
grandfather was of the French nobility and the noblest blood of
France ran, too, in my mother's veins."</p>

<p>The girl's anger all suddenly died down and regarding with
slightly heightened colour the good-looking face before her, she
said simply, "And I believe you, Monsieur."</p>

<p>Croupin bowed and now spoke rapidly. "I am very anxious about
Monsieur Larose," he said. "He is still watching in the dungeons
but I have not seen him for three days. This night he has not
come up for his provisions and this morning"&mdash;he hesitated
as if he did not like to utter the words&mdash;"this morning,
there was blood upon the handle of William's door."</p>

<p>"My God!" ejaculated the girl, as white as a sheet. "What do
you think has happened?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Croupin, "and I cannot go down myself
because William is watching me. To my great grief, I slept last
night, as I had not intended to, and where William went, I do not
know."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want me to do?" panted Ann. "Go down there
myself?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Croupin instantly, and taking it for granted
that she would do so, he proceeded to give her the most minute
instructions. "Now, I dropped my electric torch in the bed of
mint as I came by," he said. "Pick it up as you pass. Go into the
chapel and upon the panelling about where you saw us go through
that night, you will find a dead fly. Press sideways about the
breadth of my hand to the left of the fly, and the panel will
slide open. Close it after you have gone in. Then you will
descend eighteen steps, and at the bottom you will come up
against a stone wall. Press upon a dark patch that you will see
at about the height of your shoulder and the stone will revolve.
Pass through but don't shut that door. Leave it open for you to
come back. Then you will find yourself in a long corridor. Turn
to the left and walk about a hundred yards. Monsieur Larose will
be in the last chamber on the right hand side of the corridor,
and a few yards before you see some steps that lead to the
vaults. You understand?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. She was too overcome to speak.</p>

<p>"Ah! and another thing," went on Croupin carelessly, and as if
it were of no importance, "you may see some rats. Don't take any
notice of them. They will run away." He eyed her intently. "You
are not afraid?"</p>

<p>"I'm terribly afraid," replied Ann, half choking, "but I will
go all the same."</p>

<p>"<i>Bien</i>, Mademoiselle," said Croupin, and his stern face
relaxed into a warm, approving smile. "I was sure you would. You
are not really afraid but only think you are and it will be a
great adventure." He nodded his head. "And if you are not back in
twenty minutes from now, I will risk everything and come after
you." He smiled back. "If everything be all right, send Rosa for
another lemon."</p>

<p>Ann had spoken truly when she said she was afraid but, for all
that, she held her head high and there was no wavering in her
steps as she approached the panel in the chapel. Contrary to her
expectations, she found the opening easily and according to the
instructions of Croupin, although not without a tremor, she
closed it behind her. The stairs were quickly negotiated and the
revolving stone at the bottom did not worry her, but it was when
she stepped into the long, low corridor, and the rays of her
torch shone down its ghostly lengths that the real test of her
courage and determination began.</p>

<p>She choked down a sob of terror as her torch reflected the the
light from hundreds of beady eyes, and stood stock still with her
feet as if rooted to the ground. But remaining stationary was
really the best thing she could have done, for the rats scuttled
past her and in a few seconds she was alone.</p>

<p>With a great effort of will then, she forced herself to move
forward and her courage coming back, she started to run quickly
and to call out for the detective.</p>

<p>"Mr. Larose," she shouted, "it is Miss Devenham! Where are
you? Are you here?"</p>

<p>But she had run almost to the length of the corridor before
any reply came and then a muffled and hoarse voice answered
"Here! here! Let me out! Someone has shut me in!"</p>

<p>Her heart gave a great bound of thankfulness and all her fears
forgotten, she turned to the door from behind which the voice had
come.</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" she asked breathlessly. "How can I open
it?"</p>

<p>"Lift up the bar you see outside," replied Larose with
surprising cheerfulness for a man who but a short while before
had thought he was sinking into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"But I can't," she replied after a moment. "It's too heavy. I
must go and get help from the castle."</p>

<p>"No, no," came sternly from the detective, "anything but that.
Do as I tell you and you'll get it up. Now listen. Take off one
of your shoes, place it upon your shoulder. Then lean hard
against the door and put your shoulder under the bar as near as
you can to the socket and heave up slowly. No jerking, and take a
deep breath before you begin. Don't be in a hurry."</p>

<p>She did as he told her and three times struggled to raise the
bar, without however receiving the faintest promise of
success.</p>

<p>"I can't move it," she panted at last. "It's too heavy or it's
jammed. Oh! let me go for Monsieur Antoine."</p>

<p>"Not yet," called back Larose imperatively. "We'll try another
way. You'll see some steps a few yards further on. There are only
four of them. Go down and turn round to the right. Then in the
corner there, behind some stones, you'll find a crowbar. Bring it
and swing it against the bar. You'll loosen it from the socket
then."</p>

<p>A couple of minutes elapsed and then he heard the girl return
dragging the big crowbar behind her.</p>

<p>"But it's too heavy for me to swing," she cried despairingly.
"I can hardly lift it off the ground."</p>

<p>"Take it with both hands, by the middle, and then you'll be
able to. Swing it a few times backwards and forwards first and
then bang it hard against the bar."</p>

<p>Laying her torch upon the ground, with a great effort Ann
managed to at last get the long length of iron properly balanced,
and she started resolutely to swing it against the door. But the
bar was high and she missed it every time. She soon tired, and
with every swing her efforts became weaker. At last, with one
despairing effort she lunged forward, and very wide of the bar
again, the iron nevertheless just flicked against the socket. It
touched it very lightly but a sharp crack followed and then both
socket and bar crashed on to the ground.</p>

<p>The door swung open, missing the girl narrowly and the
detective reeled out into the corridor.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" he asked hoarsely, and Ann replied, "I
don't know."</p>

<p>He stooped and picked up the broken socket. "Oh! oh!" he
exclaimed ruefully, "if I'd pushed against the door, ever so
gently, it would have given way. This socket's almost rusted
through."</p>

<p>Then the reaction set in and he sank down upon the stones.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" asked Ann anxiously as she flashed the torch
upon his face. "Oh! how ill you look!"</p>

<p>She might well say that, for the detective was an appalling
spectacle. He looked the wreck of a man. He was shivering
violently, his face was drawn and ghastly pale, his eyes were
swollen and bloodshot and he had been unshaved for four days.</p>

<p>"I've had no sleep," he whispered, "and I'm almost dead from
cold. I couldn't sleep all last night. I was so frozen." He
smiled weakly and a little animation crept back into his face.
"But how is it you came down here?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Antoine sent me," she replied. "William was watching
him and he dared not come himself." She put one of her arms under
his and helped him to his feet, thinking rapidly all the time.
"Now don't worry any more," she went on. "I'm going to take you
up into the castle and you shall have some proper food and
sleep."</p>

<p>"No," said Larose firmly and freeing himself from her arm. "I
must remain down here. With something to eat and another blanket,
I shall soon be all right again. The rats took the blanket that I
had or I should not be like this now."</p>

<p>"You will come up," said Ann with great sternness, "and I
insist upon it. I didn't torture myself to come down here for
nothing, and you'll break down altogether if you don't get proper
attention now. I was training for a nurse once and know what I am
talking about."</p>

<p>The detective shook his head. "But it won't be for long," he
pleaded. He passed his hand across his forehead and added weakly,
"I think my work is almost done here."</p>

<p>But Ann had not been given her good chin for nothing and she
took his arm in a firm grip again.</p>

<p>"You're coming with me," she said quietly, "and you're going
to have a hot bath, some champagne, and a good sleep."</p>

<p>It was the thought of a hot bath that made the detective waver
and his resolution was weakening palpably when he spoke
again.</p>

<p>"But how can it be managed?" he asked shakily. "No one in the
castle but Monsieur Antoine must know."</p>

<p>"You'll see," replied Ann quickly. "I'll arrange it somehow.
Now you lean on me and take short steps! Come on, for those awful
rats are here again," and from that moment she had things all her
own way.</p>

<p>She helped him, almost pushing him at times, up into the
chapel and there she left him, lying in one of the pews whilst
she went to make her arrangements.</p>

<p>"Keep still," she said, "and don't worry. It will be a miracle
if anyone comes in here, but if they do, pretend to be
unconscious and don't answer any questions. I'll be back very
soon and you shall have that hot bath I promised you."</p>

<p>She went up to her little suite of rooms which consisted of a
small boudoir, with a bedroom, and a bathroom attached. One of
the housemaids was making the bed.</p>

<p>"Be quick, please, Rosa," she said. "I've got a bad headache
and am going to have a sleep and don't want to be disturbed."</p>

<p>The maid left in a few minutes and Ann turned on the bath.
"Now for the critical moment," she thought, "and if anyone meets
us, I'll just have to say I found him wandering about." She
caught her breath in apprehension. "But oh! if uncle ever gets to
know."</p>

<p>She had only one flight of stairs to go down and then she
turned into the long corridor leading to the chapel.</p>

<p>"Now quick, Mr. Larose," she said briskly, hiding all trace of
her nervousness. "We have only this corridor to go along and then
up one flight of stairs and we shall be all right." She fibbed
boldly. "We are certain to meet no one."</p>

<p>And they did meet no one, but Ann had two frights. She heard
Lord Thralldom's voice a very little way away, just round the
corner in the lounge, and William himself passed across the end
of the corridor, happily, however, without looking round.</p>

<p>The detective took no interest in anything. He was just
content to be led along, with his eyes half shut and breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>They reached Ann's room at last and she took the detective at
once into the bathroom. "Here's the bath all ready," she said,
"and it's as hot as you can bear it." Then with no demur on his
part she proceeded to help him to begin to undress. "Don't be too
long," she went on, "and when you've dried, get quickly into bed.
I've no pyjamas to offer you"&mdash;she blushed ever so
slightly&mdash;"mine would be much too small, but here's a
blanket you can wrap round you and it'll answer quite as well.
Now, I'll go for that champagne."</p>

<p>She found the chef alone in the kitchen and told him quickly
everything that had happened. Croupin gave her a low bow when she
had finished. "You are an angel, Mademoiselle," he said gently.
"Just an angel, that is all."</p>

<p>Larose had just thrown himself into the bed as she returned
with some sandwiches and the champagne, and after eating a little
and taking a long draught of the wine, he felt revived enough to
be for the first time interested in his surroundings.</p>

<p>"But where am I, Miss Devenham?" he asked, looking in a dazed
way round the chamber.</p>

<p>"In my bedroom,"&mdash;she blushed prettily&mdash;"and in my
bed." She bowed and smiled. "It is some small return for your
consideration to me the other morning when we met in the
chapel."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" exclaimed Larose and with all his weakness he
blushed too; "then I am exposing you to a terrible censure. If
your uncle learns&mdash;&mdash;" But his eyes closed in dreadful
sleepiness and his voice trailed away.</p>

<p>"That's right," said the girl as she tucked the clothes round
him. "You just go to sleep. You will be quite all right and no
one will disturb you."</p>

<p>"But I must be up again to-night," said the detective
drowsily. "I must&mdash;I must&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll see," replied the girl. "Now don't talk any more," and
in half a minute he was as sound asleep as he had ever been in
all his life.</p>

<p>Ann remained in her room all the morning, and at lunch-time,
pleading the headache again, had her lunch brought up to her.
Larose slept peacefully like a dead man and apparently, by his
stillness, was disturbed by no unpleasant dreams. Every now and
then she tiptoed into the bedroom and looked at him. The
afternoon waned and evening began to draw in. Then Ann summoned
the maid again and announced her intention of having dinner, too,
in her room.</p>

<p>"Tell Lady Deering, please," she said, "that I am feeling much
better, but want to keep quiet and not talk until my headache is
quite gone."</p>

<p>At nine o'clock, she was sitting reading in her boudoir when
she heard a knock upon the door and mechanically called out "Come
in." The handle of the door was turned slowly and then, to her
consternation, her uncle walked into the room. With a strong
effort she repressed all traces of emotion as she rose up and
advanced to meet him, bestowing a covert glance, however, at the
door leading into her bedroom, which was ajar a few inches.</p>

<p>"Oh! Uncle," she said, forcing her face into a smile. "It's
very nice of you, I am sure. But why did you come up? I'm feeling
quite all right now."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom sank wearily into the arm-chair, which she had
moved forward for him.</p>

<p>"I wanted to speak to you," he replied fixing his great eyes
upon her, "for I am worried about you."</p>

<p>"Worried!" she exclaimed. "But I tell you I am quite all
right."</p>

<p>"Oh! it wasn't about that," he replied carelessly. "Girls are
always imagining they've got headaches and other things." He
looked at her very sternly. "I am worried about that business in
the chapel the other day."</p>

<p>The girl's heart beat unpleasantly, but her smile was a ready
one. "Well, forget about it," she replied brightly, "and don't
let it worry you any more. It doesn't worry me." She laughed with
animation. "Now, have you been worshipping as usual before the
Rubens to-day?"</p>

<p>But her uncle was not to be put off. "I am always afraid of a
woman with a secret," he said frowningly, "for they are creatures
of impulse and never to be fully trusted." He spoke sharply. "Now
have you said a word to anyone about the idea you had of that
secret door?"</p>

<p>She drew herself up proudly. "Did I not make a promise to
you?" she asked, speaking quite as sharply as he had done.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did," he said with his eyes intently holding
hers.</p>

<p>She tossed her head defiantly. "Well, a Thralldom never lies,"
and she bowed as if to dismiss the whole matter.</p>

<p>He regarded her very thoughtfully. "I'll take you down in the
dungeons one day," he went on, "and let you see what they are
like"&mdash;he turned his eyes away now and put up his hand to
stifle a yawn&mdash;"perhaps to-morrow or the day after." He
looked back at her again. "But no mentioning it to anybody, mind.
I don't want a pack of sightseers at our heels. Oh! and one thing
more. I have upon several occasions mentioned to you and your
mother that I have willed all my possessions to the National
Gallery in the interests of Art." He nodded significantly. "Well,
my lawyer will be coming here on Thursday and I intend"&mdash;he
smiled a slow inscrutable smile&mdash;"to make a different
decision then."</p>

<p>He bade her good-night and walked slowly from the room.
Breathing a great sigh of relief, she went into the bedroom and,
finding her patient was now wide awake, switched on the light.
She thought he looked very frightened.</p>

<p>"It's all right," she said soothingly, "he's gone. How are you
feeling?"</p>

<p>"Much better," replied the detective. He leant upon his elbow.
"But look here. I heard what your uncle said and you must promise
me"&mdash;he spoke most deliberately&mdash;"that under no
circumstances whatever will you go down into those dungeons
unless I am with you. You understand? Under no circumstances;
whoever asks you."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked, very surprised at his earnestness.</p>

<p>"Because," he replied, "you are forcing me to tell you, there
are the bodies of the murdered dead down there and, if you see
them, they will become the nightmare of all your life and you may
be so horrified that when you have children they may be born
imbeciles."</p>

<p>The pallor on the girl's face was now even greater than his
own and she caught her breath in a nervous gasp, "But you
frighten me!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I mean to," he said sharply, "for there are things there no
young girl should see." He repeated his request. "Now, you
promise me."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied faintly, "I promise you."</p>

<p>"You swear?" he went on.</p>

<p>"Yes, I swear," she said.</p>

<p>Larose dropped back upon the pillow and then spoke in quite a
different tone. "You've been an angel of compassion to me, Miss
Devenham," he said gently, "and I can never be grateful enough to
you." He looked round and then laughed with some embarrassment.
"I wonder how you dared to bring me up here."</p>

<p>The girl laughed back. "I had to, Mr. Larose," she replied.
"It was forced upon me. I couldn't leave you down there in the
condition you were in, and this is the only room I could be sure
no one would come into. Besides"&mdash;and she flushed
hotly&mdash;"you were so nice to us that morning in the chapel.
You didn't smile and think we were horrid. You just took
everything as a matter of course, and as if it were nothing out
of the ordinary." She bowed. "You saved my reputation, sir, and
you drew all the sting out of the remorse Mr. Harden was feeling
because he had asked me to bring him into the chapel."</p>

<p>"Well, he'll have no remorse in years to come," smiled Larose,
"for it consecrated you to each other for all your lives." He
sighed. "You are a charming girl, Miss Devenham, and I envy Mr.
Harden from the bottom of my heart." He craned his head above the
bedclothes and looked round for his clothes. "Now, I'll be
getting up."</p>

<p>But Ann was instantly the imperious nurse again. "No, Mr.
Larose, you won't," she said firmly. "As I told you this morning
I've harrowed my feelings a lot for you and run a lot of risks,
too, so you're going to obey me now. To-morrow morning before
anyone's up, you shall get up and go, but until then"&mdash;she
smiled&mdash;"you are my patient."</p>

<p>"But I must," began the detective, "I have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't give you your clothes," she interrupted, "so that's
final. Now, you'll have something more to eat and then go off to
sleep again. Remember, you have three nights' sleep to pick
up."</p>

<p>Larose frowned. He realised the wisdom of doing as she
suggested, but was worried at the idea of not at once resuming
his search. "But where are you going to sleep?" he asked
hesitantly.</p>

<p>"In the next room," she replied, "and I will be at hand any
moment you want me."</p>

<p>"Well," he said after a moment, "can you take a message for me
to Monsieur Antoine?" and when she nodded he went on with a
smile, "Tell him you are allowing me to get up to-morrow morning
at five and I'll go straight to the kitchen then."</p>

<p>She switched off the lights and, assuring him that no one
would be likely to disturb him in her absence, departed upon her
mission, to return, however, very shortly with the information
that she had spoken to the chef and that the latter would be
waiting for him at five o'clock.</p>

<p>Larose thanked her gratefully and then, turning on his side,
was asleep again almost at once.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV. &mdash; THE RAID UPON THE CASTLE</h2>

<p class="first">CROUPIN was very thoughtful that evening when,
in a few and hurried words, Ann had told him that Larose would be
remaining on in her room until the morning, but was intending to
go back into the vaults at five o'clock on the morrow, refreshed
with a good night's rest.</p>

<p>The chef had received with great relief her assurance that
Larose was recovering, but, after she had left him, with the
realisation all at once that no one would be keeping watch now in
the vaults that night, he began to be very troubled.</p>

<p>"And to-night William himself may go down into the vaults," he
thought ruefully, "and if he does, may easily chance upon some
evidence that another person has been there recently. Miss Ann
says Larose was dazed and most exhausted when she found him, and
in that condition it is hardly probable that he thought of
bringing up his blanket with him. So, if William sees it there,
or any of the paper that I wrapped the sandwiches in, or the
empty bottles of wine or the little basket that carried
them"&mdash;he threw out his hands despairingly&mdash;"then
everything will be ruined, for he will take warning and perhaps
never give us a chance of catching him again."</p>

<p>He frowned. "And I don't like the look of that William now.
There's some change in him that I don't understand. He is
brighter, and has been smiling that strange smile of his as if,
at last, he is relieved about something and able to throw off
some feeling of dread or suspicion that has been haunting him. I
don't understand either about that blood upon the door-handle. He
may have cut his hand, of course, but he is so secretive about
himself that I have never had a chance to see."</p>

<p>He thought for a long while and then snapped his fingers
together with a grin. "Well, I must dope him again; that's all.
It will stir up all his suspicions, but I can't help it. Anything
rather than that he should go into the vaults to-night."</p>

<p>He went on. "But how am I going to do it? He refuses coffee
now and draws his own water from the tap. He will only drink tea
when he has seen one of the girls make it, actually under his
very eyes, and he himself picks out every cake and biscuit that
he eats. He watches me carving too, as if he were a cat watching
a mouse." He grinned again. "No matter, old Croupin is a boy of
great resource and he'll manage it somehow."</p>

<p>Monsieur Antoine, then appeared to be in a merry mood that
night as he prepared the supper for the servants' hall, and as
usual with him when he was happy, talked a lot to everybody.</p>

<p>"Now, as you have all been good girls and boys to-day," he
announced with twinkling eyes, "I give you special treat. You
shall have some of zat famous soup zat no one but me can make.
The secret was only known to me and ze Pope of Rome, as he tell
me the other day he have forgotten it, zen only me can make it as
it should be done. So get your mouths ready to water when I put
it on to ze table."</p>

<p>Then, in due time, after much mystery and with the juggling
together of many pots and pans, he produced a saucepan of
steaming soup, giving off most delicious and appetising
aromas.</p>

<p>"No, no pushing," he remonstrated, as if he were addressing a
crowd of hungry school-children, "zere is enough for all. But you
sit down, everyone, and I will serve it myself so zat no one get
too much. Also, as it is my birthday and I am just twenty-one to-day&mdash;you need not laugh Mees Rosa for it is ze wisdom in my
face zat make me look so old&mdash;I will put on a bottle of ze
wine of France afterwards."</p>

<p>They took their seats as he had ordered, and he proceeded to
serve them, one by one, leaving William and himself until
last.</p>

<p>Then he came over to the table with two servings, one, a good
one which he set down before William, and the other a much
smaller one which he was reserving for himself.</p>

<p>"Ah! but you will enjoy zis," he beamed round upon them all.
"Ze Pope of Rome once say&mdash;Why what is zat for?" he
exclaimed, for William had suddenly reached over across the table
and exchanged his own serving for that of the chef.</p>

<p>"Only that you are helping me to too much," replied the
footman with a quiet smile. "I'll have this little serving that
you were taking yourself," and giving the apparently disgusted
chef no time to remonstrate, he dipped his spoon in his plate and
began to eat.</p>

<p>Outwardly, certainly Monsieur Antoine was the very picture of
astonishment, as if amazed beyond all measure that anyone could
have too much of his precious soup, but inwardly he was chuckling
in his joy.</p>

<p>"I knew, I knew you'd do it," danced his exultant thoughts,
"and now you've given the veronal to yourself. You are clever,
Meester William, and prepared for everything, but there is one
cleverer than you, and he is the poor old Croupin here. Ha! ha!
ha! Deep dreams, my son, for there'll be only bed for you to-night."</p>

<p>"But, Monsieur Antoine," called out the pretty Rosa, "the
fried onions in this soup are very strong. It is delicious but we
shall all smell."</p>

<p>"Zat is what ze Pope of Rome say," laughed the chef
delightedly, "but he have it all ze same." He shook his head.
"Ah! zis is not ze soup for lovers, Mees Rosa. Nevaire, nevaire
eat onions before you go to make ze love." He sighed heavily. "I
forgot zat once and lose a lovely lady. She was rich countess wiz
millions of pounds. She turn her nose away and love anuzzer at
once. It was very sad."</p>

<p>"Law! but what company you must have kept, Monsieur Antoine,"
exclaimed Rosa. "Fancy you knowing a countess to speak to!"</p>

<p>"Oh! I did much more zan speak to her," smiled the chef, "and
when I lose her, it was a great blow."</p>

<p>"But you've made up for it since, Froggy," laughed James
coarsely; "I'll bet you've had hundreds after her."</p>

<p>"No, no," denied the chef quickly, "I am a woman hater ever
since."</p>

<p>They all laughed derisively, but Monsieur Antoine, as if to at
once prove the truth of his assertion, took the hand of Bertha
who was sitting next to him, and squeezed it tenderly in front of
them all.</p>

<p>The chef was at his merriest after the meal, and it was with
regret, when ten o'clock arrived, that Isobel, the head
parlourmaid, shepherded the maids up to their respective rooms,
with the men-servants proceeding to lock up for the night.</p>

<p>In the meantime Hudson and Kelly down at the old house on the
Haven had passed a very worried day. They were furious, for they
were in a way of being hampered in all their plans because Fenner
had taken himself off without a word of explanation, and the only
reason they could think of for his going, was that he must have
become frightened at the last moment and determined to sever all
association with them in their contemplated raid that night upon
Thralldom Castle.</p>

<p>The last they had seen of him was on the previous evening
when, just as it was beginning to get dark, he had announced his
intention of going out as usual to continue his search for the
opening to the passage that would lead them into the castle under
the moat.</p>

<p>"And I'll be making a last search among the ruins of the
Priory," he said, "and there is still a chance we may be able to
avoid all the danger of having to break in." And Kelly had jeered
at him, as he always did, for being so obstinate.</p>

<p>They had not become aware that Fenner had left them until well
on towards midday when Hudson had gone into the bedroom, to find
that it was unoccupied and, moreover, that the bed had not been
slept in.</p>

<p>"He's quit, right enough," snarled Kelly, "and I'm not a bit
surprised. There was always too much of the kid-glove about him,
and he was full of his blasted arguing instead of being willing
to get to work."</p>

<p>Their anger was the greater because they had definitely fixed
that night, or rather, the very early morning, for their attempt
to obtain the Rubens, and they could not possibly postpone it.
The captain's stay at the castle was almost at an end, the moon
would be just right, there had been no rain for three days to
allow of any incriminating footmarks being left, and they had
everything prepared.</p>

<p>Exactly at a quarter past two, Captain Bonnett was to signal
to them by the flashing of a torch in the window of the footman's
little room off the entrance hall. Then they would climb over the
big gate on the drawbridge by means of a rope ladder, long enough
to reach down over both sides at once; then Kelly would cut
through the bars of the window with an oxy-acetylene torch and
afterwards cut out the entire window pane with a diamond.</p>

<p>They believed they had provided for every possible contingency
and Fenner's part, a very subordinate although a very essential
one, would have been to have first helped with the carrying of
the heavy cylinders and the other things that they were taking,
and then to have kept watch outside the castle to warn them of
any danger approaching from along the marsh road.</p>

<p>They sat outside, about the house all day, gloomy and
fidgeting and saying very little to each other. It was not a day
when Kelly was due up at the castle, and Hudson would dearly have
liked to have got into communication with Captain Bonnett, if
only to be assured that all was quiet and everything still
propitious for the adventure of the night, but he had no adequate
excuse to ring up and did not dare to do so, being mindful of the
enquiries that would be made later everywhere, if their raid upon
the paintings were successful.</p>

<p>"But, my word!" he exclaimed suddenly, breaking one of the
long silences, "won't there be a hell of a stir tomorrow. We
shall have the 'tecs from all over this darned country down here
and they'll want to have a jaw with everyone," and he laughed
nervously as if, with the actual moment of the attempt
approaching, he was not too easy in his mind.</p>

<p>"And what does it matter if they do?" commented Kelly gruffly.
"They can't touch us unless they've got some proof, and who the
blazes would think of digging in these sandhills for stuff worth
fifty thousand quid. No," he went on emphatically, "we're quite
safe and nothing can go wrong if that fool Bonnett does exactly
as we told him, and by this time to-morrow we shall be sitting
quiet and enjoying watching the rotten police dancing all about
the place."</p>

<p>The day dragged on and at last darkness fell with all the
promise of it going to be a fine night.</p>

<p>They had a light supper just before midnight, which, on the
American's part, at all events, consisted in the main of stiff
brandies and sodas, and then they began to gather up their
apparatus.</p>

<p>"Curse that Fenner," growled Kelly deeply, "these cylinders
are darned heavy and at least he'd have been of some use,
carrying one."</p>

<p>At twenty minutes to two they set off along the road leading
over the marshes. The stars were showing and the moon, towards
the end of its last quarter, gave them just sufficient light to
pick their way.</p>

<p>A few minutes after two they were crouching by the castle
drawbridge and at a quarter past, to the very second, the light
flashed in the little room.</p>

<p>"A good beginning," whispered Hudson, moistening his dry lips,
"now, over with the ladder and I'll go first."</p>

<p>The gate was easily negotiated and leaving the rope-ladder
with both its ends trailing upon the ground, they crept up to the
castle walls. They saw Captain Bonnett inside the footman's room
with his face pressed up close against the window pane. He looked
ghastly white, but he nodded and his lips framed the words "All
right."</p>

<p>The American's teeth were chattering, but the cool and
business-like way in which Kelly proceeded to set about his work
soon calmed him and his hand was quite steady as he helped to
screw the connections on to the cylinders.</p>

<p>"A wonderful little invention, the oxy-acetylene torch"
whispered Kelly enthusiastically, "and you'll be surprised at the
little noise it makes&mdash;no louder than the burning of a small
Primus stove."</p>

<p>He slipped a roll of stout asbestos padding behind the bars so
that the heat of the torch should not crack the glass in the
window and then, with Hudson holding a large beach umbrella lined
with thick black cloth behind him so that no one across the
meadows should see the light of the flame he set a match to the
oxygen and started operations.</p>

<p>"No one will see us a hundred yards away," he whispered
exultingly, "and no one will hear us, twenty. Keep the umbrella
as close as you can."</p>

<p>The torch hissed sibilantly, and under its fierce heat the
solid bars were cut through, almost as if they were butter. Kelly
might have been a man of most unpleasant disposition, but he was
certainly a most efficient workman and knew what he was
about.</p>

<p>"Now quick, grab hold of that bar," he ordered sharply. "It's
just going to fall and we mustn't have a sound." He laughed
sneeringly. "I've always wondered this old fool here doesn't keep
a couple of savage dogs. They'd have made things difficult, if
you like."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the bars were all cut out and then Kelly,
first tightly wedging the window frame with some strips of lead
that he had provided, proceeded to cut all round the glass with a
diamond. Captain Bonnett was now standing close up to the window
again and holding a blanket, folded, in his hand.</p>

<p>Kelly nodded and the captain at once began to press lightly
against the glass with his blanket. Then Kelly, with his elbows
held closely to his sides and with the palms of his hands wide
open, struck sharply against the glass. Once, twice, three times
he struck, and then with just a gentle crack, the glass fell into
the blanket that the captain was holding, and Kelly and Hudson
stepped into the room.</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" ejaculated Hudson wiping the perspiration from
his forehead, "I should never have thought it would be so
simple."</p>

<p>"Simple!" growled Kelly contemptuously. "You just try it one
day and see."</p>

<p>"Everything's all right," whispered the captain breathlessly,
"but put the sucker on." He looked anxious. "You haven't
forgotten that?"</p>

<p>Kelly smiled contemptuously, but then taking a large suction
disc from his pocket, spat vigorously upon it a few times and
then attached it to the middle of the pane of glass now lying
down upon the ground. A line of stout whipcord was then tied
round the handle of the sucker.</p>

<p>"So, your pretty little soul is saved," he jeered, "and you
needn't worry." He handed over some small coils of wire to the
captain. "Get away, quick now, and screw these across the stairs.
Half way down, too, so that anyone will have a good tumble.
They're all measured off and of just the right length. I haven't
been coming up here for nothing." He flashed his torch upon the
captain's face and spoke menacingly. "And mind you watch, all
right. No shouting if you hear anything suspicious but just come
and tell me. I've got a knuckle-duster and am good for a footman
or two," and he and Hudson then padded softly away in the
direction of the gallery.</p>

<p>"Everything's going splendidly," whispered Hudson as they
arrived at the big grille, "and if you cut these bars as easily
as you did the others, we shall never need to work for another
day in our lives. Things couldn't be better."</p>

<p>But he was very much mistaken, for Croupin had been an unseen
and intensely interested spectator of all that had been going on
from the moment when they had started the oxy-acetylene torch
outside the window, and behind a big settee in the hall, had
nodded many times in professional appreciation of the expeditious
manner in which they had effected an entrance.</p>

<p>He had tucked himself up in bed soon after ten, but for some
reason he had been very restless and the hours going by without
his falling asleep, the idea had suddenly come to him that he
would go down into the dungeons and bring up the things that he
was sure the detective had left behind, for after all he told
himself, it was quite possible Larose might not be well enough to
resume his watching in the morning and he, Croupin, could not go
on doping the footman indefinitely.</p>

<p>So, partially dressing himself, he had crept down the stairs
and had been just upon the point of turning into the corridor
leading to the chapel, when a faint hissing sound had caught his
ear.</p>

<p>He had stood as if rooted to the floor for a few seconds and
then he had caught his breath in a thrill of ecstasy.</p>

<p>"An acetylene torch!" he gasped. "Someone is trying to break
in." He drew himself up to his full height and grinned
delightedly. "And I, Croupin, am here to prevent it."</p>

<p>He crept like lightning into the hall and along its entire
length and then crouching down was a witness of all that was
happening.</p>

<p>"Captain Bonnett!" he gasped again as his amazed eyes took in
the figure of the captain silhouetted against the flare of the
acetylene torch. "Then he is helping them! The wretch, and I owe
him one, for James said he agreed with the lord that my Tartare
sauce was too thick. A guest here, too! Oh! the bad lot!"</p>

<p>He saw the pane of glass removed and Kelly and Hudson step
into the room and he gasped again. "But I might have known it,"
he breathed. "I guessed it all along."</p>

<p>He heard the sharp whispered instructions that Kelly gave to
the captain and with the disappearance of the latter, he followed
the other two at a respectful distance, up the stairs leading to
the picture gallery.</p>

<p>"They'll cut through the grille in the same way, of course,"
he went on, "but they'll have to be very clever if they get the
Rubens out of its frame without sounding the alarms." He nodded
his head. "But I won't give them the chance. I'll just let them
get going well and then I'll give the alarm myself." He grinned
delightedly. "The honest Croupin saving the priceless Rubens for
the great lord!"</p>

<p>He watched them adjust the cylinders, and setting light to the
torch, start upon the bars of the big grille. Kelly was as quick
and dexterous as before and, one by one, the bars were cut
through. Four, Croupin counted them and then he thought it about
time to interfere.</p>

<p>"But I'll lock the door of the little room first," he
murmured, "and cut off their retreat. I saw the key was in the
lock outside."</p>

<p>He ran down the stairs and swiftly through the hall, but
approaching the little room was brought up dead by the flash of a
torch through the glassless window frame, and the sound of low
voices.</p>

<p>"They went in here, Inspector," he heard someone say. "They've
cut the window pane right out."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll follow the same way," came a voice of authority,
"in you go, Barney and you, too, Valentine. You, Reney watch
outside. Stand well clear of the window so that you can see if
they attempt to break away from somewhere else."</p>

<p>Croupin did not wait to hear any more, but raced like a
greyhound towards the chapel. "It's the police," he gasped. "They
are after them, and will steal all my glory if I do not look out.
But I'll get in first and ring the great bell in the belfry," and
he began to tear up a narrow flight of steps not far from the
chapel door.</p>

<p>Kelly had proceeded quickly with his work and seven bars were
cut through. "That'll do," he grunted, "we can get through now,"
and he turned off the gas.</p>

<p>Then just as he was in the very act of squeezing through the
opening he had made, a loud resounding clang broke into the
silence of the night.</p>

<p>"Dong, dong, dong," and the echoes of the great bell were
reverberating for miles over the countryside.</p>

<p>"Hell!" roared the American, "someone's heard us! Get for your
life," and, followed by the deeply cursing Kelly, he flew down
the stairs.</p>

<p>But the flight of both of them came to a very speedy
conclusion. Hudson bumped straight into the arms of Inspector
Dollard, of Saxmundham, who promptly tripped him up and held him
down, while Kelly was floored by the outstretched leg of Police
Constable Valentine, who had flashed his torch just in time to
see him coming.</p>

<p>"Switch on the lights," shouted the Inspector, and at once the
hall was as light as day.</p>

<p>Hudson made no attempt at resistance, but Kelly showed fight
and got in some nasty blows at two of the policemen before he was
finally knocked down and handcuffed.</p>

<p>Then for a few minutes pandemonium raged. Shouts and cries
came from all parts of the castle; the alarms buzzed everywhere
and there were loud thumps as James and the butler were tripped
upon the stairs.</p>

<p>"Look out, my lord," shrieked Croupin, who had now returned to
the scene of the conflict. "Zere may be a wire stretched across
zose stairs," and Lord Thralldom, with surprising agility,
avoided the wire that had almost caught him.</p>

<p>"But what's happened?" roared the master of the castle like an
old lion roused from his sleep. He threw up his hands. "My
Rubens! my Rubens! What's happened? Tell me quick."</p>

<p>"It's all right, my lord," replied Inspector Dollard smiling.
"Quite all right. They've not touched any of your pictures. We
got here just in time."</p>

<p>Then Lord Thralldom started back as if he had been struck with
the lash of a whip.</p>

<p>"Great God!" he cried, glaring at the two handcuffed
prisoners. "Mr. Hudson and the masseur!"</p>

<p>Hudson was ghastly white and breathing hard, but Kelly was
smiling and looking quite pleasant for him. "Yes, the masseur, my
lord," he grinned. "The masseur who massaged your niece."</p>

<p>"But it's incredible," he gasped again. "Incredible!
incredible!"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, my lord, it isn't," laughed the Inspector. He jerked
his head round. "They got in through that little room there by
oxy-acetylening the bars and taking out the entire window
pane."</p>

<p>"But were they alone?" asked Lord Thralldom wildly. "Someone
inside here must have helped them."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said the Inspector, "for after they had
broken the glass, they lowered it to the floor with a large
sucker on a piece of cord. That looks as if they had no help
inside."</p>

<p>"But how did you come to know they were here?" asked Lord
Thralldom now beginning to recover from his panic.</p>

<p>Inspector Dollard took out his watch. "Twenty-seven minutes
ago, my lord," he replied, "we got a telephone call from a party
who declined to give his name, that two suspicious-looking
characters were approaching the castle along the marsh road,
heavily laden, and he was of opinion that they were carrying gas
cylinders. I immediately tried to get you on the 'phone here to
ascertain if all was right, but learning that your wires were
dead, I suspected something and came along at once." He smiled
happily and put back his watch. "And a good thing we lost no
time."</p>

<p>"But who ordered the great bell in the belfry to be rung?"
asked Lord Thralldom sharply. "Did you do it to summon more
help?"</p>

<p>The Inspector, looking very puzzled, shook his head, and then
Croupin thought that he himself ought now to step into the
picture.</p>

<p>He glanced round and his chest expanded, for he saw he would
be having a splendid audience. All the inmates of the castle
appeared to be there.</p>

<p>The maids were huddled in a corner of the hall, with
frightened eyes and in varying conditions of undress; Ann
Devenham looked charming in a pink dressing gown, with her pretty
hair all ruffled up, and the men servants were gaping in
amazement, although William could hardly keep his eyes open.</p>

<p>Croupin stepped forward into the centre of the hall. "My
lord," he said, bowing, "it was I who rang ze big bell."</p>

<p>"You!" glowered Lord Thralldom. "How did you know anything was
wrong?"</p>

<p>Croupin shot out his arm and pointed dramatically at the
prisoners. "I saw zose men zere melting ze bars of ze grille. It
was like zis. I could not sleep and leant out of my window
because I have ze headache. Zen I smell something and knew it was
carbide. I ask myself 'Who is using carbide in ze middle of ze
night?' I open my door and ze smell is stronger. I follow ze
smell and it lead me to ze gallery. I guess at once what was
happening and I ring ze bell to wake all ze country so zat ze
great Rubens be not taken."</p>

<p>"And you tumbled them into our arms," laughed the Inspector.
"You could not have done better."</p>

<p>"These two wretches were alone, and there was no one else with
them?" asked Lord Thralldom sharply.</p>

<p>Croupin was silent for a moment and then his words were like
the exploding of a bomb.</p>

<p>"Only Captain Bonnett," he replied calmly, "and he watch so
that no one come near to interfere." He looked with accusing
sternness at the captain. "I see him, but he not see me. He knew
zey were zere right enough."</p>

<p>Captain Bonnett had gone as white as a ghost, but he shouted
energetically enough. "You liar! I was asleep in my bed when the
bell rang." He turned to Lord Thralldom. "The man is mad,
sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! no you were not in your bedroom," insisted Croupin. "You
stood by zat door and you were listening first one way and zen ze
other. I saw you."</p>

<p>"You scoundrel!" began the captain, "I
believe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Kelly interrupted harshly. "Oh, chuck it, Bonnett," he
sneered. "You'll come along with us, too." His anger rose. "You
great fool! If you'd kept your eyes open and seen this damned
cook here, we might have throttled him and nothing would have
gone wrong." He gritted his teeth. "Now, it'll be seven years for
us&mdash;hard labour." The captain was speechless. He could not
get his breath. Lord Thralldom spoke very slowly. "It's not true,
Thompson. You are lying and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lying, you old fool!" retorted Kelly coarsely. "Then who cut
the telephone wires in here if it wasn't your precious captain?"
He laughed mockingly and turned to the Inspector who was holding
Hudson by the arm.</p>

<p>"Put your hand in that chap's breast pocket," he jeered, "and
pull out the paper there. It's a map of all the rooms here, with
notes, in the dandy captain's own handwriting and the rooms of
the men are marked with a cross."</p>

<p>The Inspector hesitated a moment and then, apparently with no
objection on the part of the American, did as he was requested.
He drew out a folded paper and after one quick glance over it,
handed it to Lord Thralldom.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom's glance was a quick one, too, and then looking
up, he regarded the captain as if he could have killed him.
"Handcuff him," he shouted, "and if I could get him hanged for
this, I would." His voice boomed thunderously. "Take them all
away quick, out of my sight or I shall strike them. My Rubens is
a sacred trust and I would spare no one, not even my own flesh
and blood, if they laid hands upon it." He was sweeping out of
the hall when he turned again to the Inspector and spoke sharply.
"I shall want police protection until the morning and every night
until I have taken further measures to protect my property." He
beckoned to the footmen. "Leave all the lights on now until the
morning, and you, James, go and keep watch in the gallery until
it is light. Don't close an eye. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," bowed James, but surely no one had cursed
deeper that night than did James then, under his breath.</p>

<p>The prisoners were removed in the police car and in a few
minutes all the inmates of the castle had left the hall.</p>

<p>Lady Deering ascended the staircase leading to the bedrooms,
leaning heavily upon her stepdaughter's arm.</p>

<p>"But this is awful, Ann," she exclaimed tearfully, "for your
uncle and I were arranging that you should marry Marmaduke
shortly." She shook with fright. "Oh! I feel I shall never go to
sleep again. At any rate I dare not sleep by myself any more to-night. I will come into your bed with you at once."</p>

<p>It was now Ann's turn to shake. "No, not in my bed,
Mother,"'she said quickly, "but I will come and sleep with you.
The owls outside my window are terrible to-night and we shall be
thinking all the time, as uncle says, that they are men
signalling to one another."</p>

<p>In her confused state of mind that was quite enough for Lady
Deering and she consented to be led to her own room without any
further remonstrance. Then Ann returned to hers to switch off the
lights and, as she had told her stepmother, to fetch her hot-water bottle.</p>

<p>She found Larose was up and dressed and very anxious as to
what had been going on downstairs. She told him quickly and then
asked, very troubled, "And do you think William had anything to
do with it too? I was watching him just now and, all the time, he
was pretending to be so sleepy that he could hardly keep his eyes
open."</p>

<p>The detective shook his head. "No, I don't think for one
moment that he was mixed up in this," he replied, "and it may be
he was not pretending either when he looked, as you say, as if he
could hardly keep awake." His tone was very grave. "As I have
told you, we are endeavouring to track down the perpetrators of
those dreadful crimes that have been committed here, and the
matter is so serious that it is quite probable Monsieur Antoine
somehow gave William a sleeping draught so that, in my absence,
he should not go down into the vaults to-night."</p>

<p>The girl shivered. "But oh! this is a horrible place," she
exclaimed, "and with all its luxury, I wish I were away from
it."</p>

<p>"I expect you soon will be," smiled Larose, "and then the
happiness of your new life will make up for all you lose here."
He spoke very earnestly. "If I were you, Miss Devenham, I
wouldn't hesitate a moment, but would let Mr. Harden have his way
and take you off at once, as he wants to. From all you both have
told me, you will have to run away in the end."</p>

<p>Ann was silent for a few moments and then she sighed deeply.
"But no girl in my position, Mr. Larose," she saw slowly, "likes
to go to her husband with just the clothes she stands up in, and
a few shillings in her purse, as I should have to if I ran away."
She held her head up proudly. "It wouldn't be fair to Mr.
Harden."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," smiled the detective; "if I know anything of Mr.
Harden, he'll be thrilled to take you even if you haven't got a
postage stamp." His expression changed suddenly to one of great
sternness. "Now, listen, Miss Devenham. I may very shortly be
advising you to do something, and I want you to be prepared to do
that something, without questioning and at once. You
understand?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," she replied, "but I'll always consider what you
say, for, as you have seen, I trust you." She blushed prettily.
"But now, please, shut yourself up in the bathroom for two
minutes. I want to get undressed, and then I'm going to sleep for
the rest of the night with mother. She's very upset and wants
company."</p>

<p>Larose did as she requested and then even before the two
minutes had elapsed, she knocked softly on the bathroom door.
"You can come out," she said, "and you can have another hour's
sleep. There's an alarm on this clock and I've set it for twenty
minutes to five. Also, I've borrowed one of Monsieur Antoine's
razors for you. You look awful as you are." She gave him a
charming smile. "Good-night, Mr. Larose, and pleasant dreams to
you."</p>

<p>The detective switched off the lights and lay down upon the
bed. "Yes," he sighed sleepily, "I could very easily fall in love
with that young woman, myself."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; THE MAJESTY OF DEATH</h2>

<p class="first">A LITTLE more than an hour later, the moment the
alarm went off, Larose roused himself and rolled off the bed. He
was still terribly sleepy and felt rather weak.</p>

<p>"But I'll be better when I've had another hot bath," he told
himself, "and, at any rate, I can stick it out for one more
night. I've an exciting day before me, but when I can think
clearly again I'll soon gather up all the threads." He glanced at
himself in the mirror, and made a grimace, "Yes, I look pretty
awful, as Ann said&mdash;like a man risen from the dead."</p>

<p>He felt much better after his bath, but when he had well
soaped over his face preparatory to the much-needed shave, a most
annoying surprise awaited him, for there was no blade in the
razor Ann had brought up.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he whistled disgustedly, "so I shall have to go on
looking pretty awful and in no respectable condition to meet that
assassin. But there's no help for it," and resigned to his
continued unkempt condition, he put the useless razor in his
pocket.</p>

<p>He tidied his hair, however, with the monogrammed silver
brushes that were lying upon the dressing table.</p>

<p>"Ann's," he whispered, "and dainty, as she is." He sniffed
delicately at them. "Yes, they remind me of her." He sighed
again. "Young Harden's a lucky fellow."</p>

<p>Opening the door softly, everything seemed as silent as the
grave, and after pausing a moment to make sure no one was about,
he tiptoed softly down the stairs and proceeded into the kitchen.
It was not yet fully light, but a fire was burning there and it
partially illuminated the room.</p>

<p>He was well inside and almost up to the table before he
perceived that a man was seated before the fire, and to his
consternation, he realised in a lightning flash, that the man was
not Croupin. He was a uniformed policeman and was meditatively
smoking a pipe.</p>

<p>It was too late for Larose to draw back, for the policeman
looked up sharply and then, as if suspicious of the detective's
noiseless approach, rose instantly to his feet and stood
regarding him from out of a pair of very shrewd blue eyes.</p>

<p>But Larose had been in many a tight corner before and if he
were now very much dismayed, the expression upon his face did not
show any signs of it.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said most politely. He held up his hand.
"Hush, don't speak too loudly. Everybody's nerves are on edge
after last night and if they hear a strange voice they may take
another fright."</p>

<p>He walked up to the fireplace. "What! where's the kettle?" he
went on, "Not on yet! Darn that French cook. He never sympathises
with anyone who wants a cup of tea, and he ought to have been up
before now, getting me my breakfast. I told him five o'clock,"
and picking up a kettle and filling it at the tap, he placed it
on the fire.</p>

<p>All this time the policeman had not spoken a word, but Larose
noticed with some uneasiness that he had knocked the ashes out of
his pipe and put the pipe in his pocket in a most business-like
manner.</p>

<p>"Who are you," he asked sharply, at length breaking his
silence, "and what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>Larose smiled. "Ah! of course, I forgot!" he said. "I'm from
the Yard. I'm Larose, Gilbert Larose." He added carelessly, "I
called on Inspector Dollard last week, in reference to the
disappearance of that Mr. Holden."</p>

<p>The policeman stood hesitating. He had heard right enough
about Larose having called at the police station in Saxmundham,
and if it were truly the Australian now, was prepared to be duly
respectful, but no one had mentioned anything about Larose being
in the castle and, with the exciting experiences of the night
still stirring in his mind, he was inclined to be suspicious.</p>

<p>And certainly, he thought, he had reason to be. The night had
barely waned and tiptoeing into the kitchen, with all the actions
of a man not desirous of being heard, had come this unheralded
stranger, looking disreputable and unkempt and very unlike any
officer associated with the Yard.</p>

<p>Then, at that moment, he heard more soft footfalls, and
Antoine, the chef of the castle, in his turn came in softly.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Antoine!" exclaimed the detective angrily, before
the chef had had time to utter even an "oh," but addressing him
in the same guarded tone that he had used towards the policeman,
"when will you understand that we Australians cannot do without
our tea? You are late and I am pining for a cup now."</p>

<p>Croupin picked up his cue instantly. The detective evidently
wished it to be known who he was.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Meester Larose," he said, "but I oversleep
myself. You shall have ze tea at once."</p>

<p>"And why did you send me up a razor without any blade in it?"
went on Larose irritably, proceeding to produce Croupin's empty
razor from his pocket. "It was very careless of you. Look at my
face. No, it's no good now. I shall leave it until to-night."</p>

<p>The policeman was instantly relieved of all his doubts, for
that the chef of the castle should be now addressing this
unshaved stranger as Mr. Larose was quite sufficient. He had been
present in the hall when the Frenchman had so dramatically
related the story of the ringing of the bell and later, too, that
amiable gentleman had stood him a stiff whisky after the other
policeman had gone. So it must be quite all right.</p>

<p>He nodded most respectfully. "Pleased to meet you, sir," he
said, "but I didn't know you were working with us."</p>

<p>"And I'm not," said Larose quickly. "I'm here on quite a
different matter and his lordship, even, is not aware as yet that
I am in the castle." He dropped his voice to a whisper. "I am
here upon that Holden case and another matter, and you must
please not bring up my name at any time, to anyone." He spoke
most emphatically. "You must understand I am here on secret
work."</p>

<p>"Quite all right, sir," said the policeman briskly. He smiled.
"I'll forget that I've seen you."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence and then came another
interruption, and yet another person came into the kitchen and he
tiptoed in, in exactly the same furtive manner as Larose and the
chef had done. It was William.</p>

<p>The footman was looking very ill; for he had passed a wretched
night. During the first half of it he had lain like a dead man,
but awakened roughly by James when the great bell had sounded, he
had been almost dragged from his bed, to take in with difficulty
all that had happened downstairs in the hall. Then, retiring to
his bedroom again, he had been violently sick. The sickness had
in part cleared away his stupor, but it had left a splitting
headache behind, with all the feelings that he had experienced
twice before when he had been so certain that the chef had
drugged him. So, although he could not explain how it had been
done, he was equally as positive that he had been drugged
again.</p>

<p>There had been no more sleep for him, and he had sat up,
nursing an unreasoning and murderous anger, until the dawn. Then,
all at once he had heard the chef leaving his room and, seized
with a sudden resolution, he had hastily pulled on some clothes
and followed after him, with the determination that at last he
would avenge himself, but with no clear purpose in his mind as to
how exactly he was going to do it.</p>

<p>His face was furious with anger as he glided into the kitchen
and he licked his lips in preparation for the curses he was going
to hurl at the luckless chef.</p>

<p>Then, all in an instant, he was brought to a standstill, his
limbs became as if turned to stone, his jaw dropped and the
expression of rage upon his face gave way to one of great dismay.
He had expected only Antoine, but to his amazement, he now saw a
policeman and worse still, the dreaded detective from Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p>Instantly then, he began shifting his eyes rapidly from side
to side; he licked his lips anew and he breathed very hard. His
whole attitude was that of a guilty man, caught in the very
act.</p>

<p>Croupin suppressed a grin in which amusement and consternation
would have been blended and the policeman stared stolidly,
recognising William as one of the footmen he had seen during the
night.</p>

<p>Larose spoke up at once. "Good morning," he said genially; "it
would seem we are all going to be early risers this morning."</p>

<p>William had now in part recovered himself and, mumbling
something about not having been able to sleep, was about to
shuffle away again, when Croupin called out quickly, "Have a cup
of tea, William. Yes, come on now. Zere's plenty for you and you
look as if you wanted somezing. You look dam crook, old man."</p>

<p>The footman shook his head, but hesitated. He was cowed and
shaky and for the moment clay in anybody's hands.</p>

<p>"Come on, sit down," went on the chef. "You must have a cup,"
and the footman, incapable of any resistance, sank limply into a
chair.</p>

<p>Croupin passed over a cup of tea and then asked sharply, "Why,
what's zat on your hand?"</p>

<p>The dazed footman at once held one forward, palm upward. "No,
on ze uzzer one," said Croupin.</p>

<p>William complied again and Croupin laughed. "It is nuzzing. I
imagine I see a spider."</p>

<p>The footman was then left out of the conversation that ensued
and gulping down his tea as quickly as he could, he rose from his
chair, and unhindered this time, shuffled from the room. A minute
or two afterwards the policeman got up to go, too.</p>

<p>"I must be off to that gallery again," he announced with a
smile, "for if his lordship turns up and I'm not there, there'll
be the very devil to pay. I only came down to get a warm. It's
hellish cold up there and that other footman has been cursing all
the time."</p>

<p>The sound of his heavy footsteps died away and then Larose
asked sharply&mdash;"Quick! tell me, did William go out of his
room the night before last?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied Croupin very shamefacedly, "for
unfortunately I slept all night." He spoke in an intense whisper.
"But there was a mark of blood upon his door handle in the
morning and I was very worried about you. The mark was sticky
when I touched it, and it had not been there long. Tell me what
happened to you?"</p>

<p>Larose very briefly outlined everything that had taken place
in the dungeons and Croupin listened with his face as white as
his own flour.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" he exclaimed, "then it is certain William
is the one we want!"</p>

<p>The detective hesitated a moment. "It looks like it," he
replied, and then he asked quickly: "Have you ever heard him
laugh?"</p>

<p>"No," said Croupin emphatically, "he never laughs." He looked
round apprehensively and put his lips close up to the detective's
ear. "But there's something going on in the man's mind now and
he's getting dangerous. He's taken to following me everywhere,
and didn't you notice his face when he came in just now? He was
mad with fury, and I believe he was going to attack me. He knows
he was doped again last night."</p>

<p>"Well, you look out," nodded Larose. He spoke thoughtfully.
"But I don't think he'll do anything until he's worked himself up
again. All the kick went out of him when he saw the policeman and
me here." He frowned. "That was very awkward, for he may mention
about it to Lord Thralldom."</p>

<p>"No, he won't," said Croupin at once. "He never speaks unless
he's spoken to, and the lord never asks any questions of the
servants."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, provided with another blanket and a watch
that he had borrowed from Croupin, the detective once again
passed through the panel in the chapel wall and descended the
spiral stairway leading into the dungeons.</p>

<p>Now there are some days that, even in the most adventurous
lives, stand out in memory above all others and that day when
Larose went down into the vaults for the last time, was one,
every happening of which he was to remember all his life. It was
a day starting in dreadful disappointment, then proceeding to one
of dreadful horror, and finally culminating in a series of
startling surprises that left him in a whirl of bewildering doubt
and wonder.</p>

<p>To begin with, it was hours and hours before he could locate
the opening in the corridor from where he had seen the unknown
man come out with the lantern.</p>

<p>And yet at first he had thought it would be so easy, for he
told himself he had only to stand by the door of the dungeon
where he had been imprisoned and measuring the distance with his
eye, just walk forward until he came to a flagstone that would
certainly show signs of being different to all the others.</p>

<p>So, he stood by the dungeon door and called up to his sight
the whole scene of the two previous nights before.</p>

<p>"Here, I was standing," he said, "and about there was the
shadow of the upraised flag. There, on the roof I saw the light
and there by the wall I saw the arm appear and place the lantern
upon the floor."</p>

<p>It seemed to be so very simple, but when he came to put the
idea to an actual test, it yielded no result at all. All the
flagstones were of exactly the same size and no particular one of
them seemed any different to the others.</p>

<p>They were all solidly embedded and gave forth no hollow
sounds. They fitted pretty closely against one another and
nowhere was there any sign that they did not all form one
continuous pavement.</p>

<p>The rats were again a great annoyance, for as before, as long
as he was upon his feet, they kept at a respectful distance, but
the moment he crouched down to flash his torch between the
crevices or lie flat, as he continually did to listen whilst he
tapped upon the stones, they immediately ran over him and one
even bit him through his sock.</p>

<p>For two hours and more he scrutinised the floor of the
corridor stone by stone, and his hopes went soaring when he found
that between some of them he could just insert the thinnest blade
of his pocket knife, but they soon sank again when he invariably
struck hard mortar upon which the blade could make no impression
after thrusting it down about half an inch.</p>

<p>Then he thought of another idea, and proceeding into the
vaults, went behind the heap of stones and picked up the lantern
that he had seen there upon the first night when he had had
Croupin with him. Lifting up the glass to put a light to the
wick, he was then instantly of opinion that the lantern had been
used since he had last handled it, for the wick had been trimmed
then and now it needed trimming again. He looked hard at it for
quite a long time to make sure, with his face puckered in a
frown.</p>

<p>"Then it must be William," he said slowly, and as if arguing
with himself, "for I can be sure from the lantern being in this
place, that whoever rifled the coffins was making use of it and
we know it was William who rifled the coffins because of those
bracelets and the crucifix that he's got."</p>

<p>He made a sharp exclamation as he threw the light of his torch
upon a spade that was lying near. "Ah! and there's blood on it!
Of course, of course, as I thought, he was hitting at the rats
with it, that night."</p>

<p>He stood for a moment in deep thought and then with a shrug of
his shoulders proceeded to light the lantern. He carried it into
the corridor and placed it where he was of opinion he had seen
the lantern put down. Then he went back to the dungeon door and,
concentrating all his thoughts, endeavoured to determine if he
had got the distance right.</p>

<p>But he was not satisfied, and not once but many times, shifted
the position of the lantern. At last it seemed that he was
pleased.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate I'm within a few feet of it," he said, "and
if I have to crowbar up every stone, I'll find the opening
now."</p>

<p>Then he looked round in astonishment realising for the first
time that the rats had all left him and there was not a single
one in sight.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" he ejaculated. "Something's frightened them.
Someone's coming," and he was in the very act of hastily
extinguishing the lantern when he stopped suddenly and a smile
took the place of his anxious look. "Of course, that's it," he
went on. "I understand everything now. That gentleman of the
lantern is not too kind in his ways with them and directly it is
lit, they expect trouble and rush away. They know him and that's
why they left me the other night. The first time, when he came
down empty handed and the second"&mdash;he nodded very
slowly&mdash;"when he returned with that dead man."</p>

<p>He dismissed the matter from his mind, and kneeling down,
methodically, stone by stone, examined the joins between each
flag. But no success rewarded him. The blade of his knife would
penetrate down the interstices a little way in many places and
indeed all along the sides and end of one big flag, but every one
of them was quite immovable and there was not the slightest
indication that there had been any interference with them for
hundreds of years.</p>

<p>He gave it up at last and went and fetched the crowbar.
"There's no help for it," he said, "but it's a pity for now the
next time he comes down he will see at once that someone's been
here, and may take alarm and get out before I have time to lay
hands upon him."</p>

<p>He looked down to see where to begin operations. One flag, he
had noticed many times, appeared to be cracked slightly at one
corner and the crack was uneven and roughly triangular in shape.
He lifted the crowbar and prepared to begin chipping away by the
side of the crack.</p>

<p>Then with the first fall of the crowbar an amazing thing
happened. The whole cracked piece of the flag jumped out of its
bed, leaving a hole about an inch in depth, and to his thrilled
excitement, exposed to view a thick iron ring lying flush with
the bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>"Gee!" he exclaimed delightedly, "I've got it at last," and
dropping upon his knees, he grabbed at the ring and bracing
himself for a great effort, prepared to heave with all his
strength.</p>

<p>But he soon realised that very little strength would be
required for, after raising the flag a few inches, it suddenly
swung up of its own accord and looking down into the gaping
opening that presented itself, he perceived that the stone was
balanced by a large pendulum-like weight underneath. All along
the edges of the stone had been cut a ledge fully two inches in
width.</p>

<p>"No wonder I couldn't get my knife down any deeper," he
breathed excitedly, "for I was trying to cut into the solid
stone."</p>

<p>He carefully examined the big flag to make sure it would not
fall again, and then taking the crowbar with him, proceeded with
an unpleasant thumping of his heart, down the flight of narrow
steps that he saw before him.</p>

<p>A descent of ten steps brought him to the bottom and he raised
his lantern high above his head, to take in his surroundings.
Before him and on one side he could see the enclosing walls, but
in the other direction the light of the lantern was lost in
shadows. The floor of the chamber was of beaten earth, but it was
not of a pavement-like hardness. The air was dank and tainted
with a horrible, indescribable smell, but it was not so foul as
he had expected, and swinging the lantern round, he saw no sign
of the earth having been disturbed anywhere. As far as he could
see, the whole place was empty.</p>

<p>He had soon examined the part of the chamber that ended near
the bottom of the steps and then he moved forward in the other
direction and soon, very soon, a sense other than sight, plainer
and more plain with every step that he advanced, told him that he
was nearing his goal.</p>

<p>But he could still see no sign of any body anywhere, and
proceeding about fifty yards, and when the rays of his lantern
were falling upon the farthest enclosing wall, there was still
nothing to indicate to his eyes that anyone had been there before
him for hundreds and hundreds of years. Only a cold and chilling
emptiness on every side with the earthen floor unbroken and
undisturbed in all directions.</p>

<p>But still that other sense had become more and more insistent
that if he were not in the presence of the living, he was
certainly in that of the dead.</p>

<p>He moved up quickly towards the extreme end of the chamber,
the thought now flashing through his mind that he might have to
search for yet another hidden door. Then, when almost up to the
wall itself, turning his head sideways, his eyes fell upon
something that almost made his heart stand still.</p>

<p>In one of the extreme corners of the chamber gaped the opening
of a large well!</p>

<p>He darted forward and held up the lantern. The top of the well
was widely margined round with stonework and its coping was just
level with the beaten earth. The well itself was about seven feet
in diameter and, as far as he could see, its sides were stone-lined, too.</p>

<p>He approached close up and swung the lantern round, but it did
not throw its light down far enough and so placing it upon the
ground; he bent over the well and flashed his torch.</p>

<p>Then the torch almost dropped from his hand, and forgetting he
had been holding in his breath, he opened his mouth wide and
gasped in horror. He had been quite prepared to expect what now
lay before him, but in all his life of the tracking down of
crime, never had he met death in such a dreadful setting
before.</p>

<p>Not four feet below him rested the body of a man. It lay upon
its back, partly submerged in the clear water of the well. Its
head was raised as if upon a pillow and its calm white face was
serene in the peace and majesty of death. Its eyes were closed as
if it were very tired, its forehead was fretted over with a
straggling wisp of hair and a long, white hand, with a gold
signet ring upon one finger, was stretched against its side.</p>

<p>But it was its pillow that gave the horror to the scene, for
it rested upon the body of another man, and this body was
ballooned to such a size that there was no neck to its head, and
its face was but the semblance of a face. One of its arms was
flung across the chest of the first man and the hand of the other
arm was just showing above the water, like a claw. This second
body seemed also to be buoyed up in some way.</p>

<p>Larose took in everything in a lightning glance and then
completely overcome for the moment and leaving his lantern where
it was, he darted back to the foot of the steps and drew in deep
draughts of the less tainted air there.</p>

<p>But it was only for a few seconds that he remained inactive
and then he was once again the cool, calculating detective inured
to all the gruesome happenings of his profession.</p>

<p>He picked up the long crowbar and returning to the well, lay
flat down upon the earth and stretched the crowbar down.</p>

<p>Very gently he levered against the side of the topmost body.
It sank and rose and quivered as if it were upon springs, but
then suddenly it slipped into the deep water and, all in an
instant, had disappeared to the accompaniment of thousands and
thousands of little bubbles.</p>

<p>Immediately then it was as if some great monster had been
disturbed in the depths of the well, for the surface of the water
was broken violently and, one after another, strange, horrible-looking objects heaved themselves up into view.</p>

<p>The back of a man arched like a bow and with arms and legs
spread out at dreadful angles; a black mass that had no shape at
all and finally, a foot shod with a woman's shoe. The ankle above
this shoe was grotesque and shapeless.</p>

<p>The detective, with his lips tightly compressed, pulled up the
crowbar and rising to his feet, sprang away from the side of the
well. Then happening to glance up, he saw far away a small, round
patch of light. There was a chimney over the well, and it tapered
up to some opening high upon the castle walls.</p>

<p>"And that is why the air down here is not so foul, away from
this cursed well," he murmured. "I couldn't understand it."</p>

<p>He picked up the lantern and with one last shuddering glance
all round, made his way quickly across the chamber and up the
steps. He lowered the big flag-stone again into its bed, and
returning to the entrance to the vaults sat down and leant
against the wall.</p>

<p>He saw that there was still plenty of oil remaining in the
lantern and he left it burning.</p>

<p>For a long while then, he sat very still with his elbows upon
his knees and his chin upon his hands. There was no elation in
the expression upon his face, indeed he looked very worried.</p>

<p>"I am troubled, I am troubled," he whispered. "I am not ready
and I am not certain yet. I must be very careful or I shall ruin
my whole career. If I strike now I may be only striking the air."
He thought for a long while. "Yes, I am afraid and I do not know
what to do next."</p>

<p>He went on. "This is a terrible business, the most terrible I
ever remember, and if William be the murderer, his actions are so
motiveless and ununderstandable. Just the blind slaughter and the
sheer lust of shedding blood! And how does it happen that, all in
the course of a few short weeks, he has become the possessor of
all the three secrets of these dungeons; the door leading down
from the chapel, the secret of the chamber with the well, and the
secret of the passage leading under the moat?" He shook his head.
"No, no, it seems absolutely impossible."</p>

<p>He went on frowningly. "But it must be William, for everything
points to him. Croupin does not lie, and his evidence, if
indirect, is nevertheless almost overwhelming. The many
disappearances of the man from his bedroom during the night, the
similarity of his walk to that of the slayer of the bailiff, the
possession of those gold bracelets, his unusual behaviour all
along, and finally, that blood upon the handle of the door."</p>

<p>He nodded his head again. "That's all right, but what evidence
have I against him that I could produce in a court of law?
Practically none. Only the evidence of Croupin that he saw those
bracelets in the man's trunk, and that evidence, too, obtained in
a most questionable way. Besides, Croupin himself is a fugitive
from his own country and I could not expect him to go into the
witness-box. Also, that footman has been badly frightened lately,
and it is quite on the cards that he has got rid of those
brackets, so that no evidence may really be forthcoming against
him. Then&mdash;finger-prints? No, I don't think so. I looked
particularly at his hands this morning and they were smooth and
well-kept and wholly unlike those of a man who has been doing
this rough work in the vaults, so he undoubtedly wears
gloves."</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on. "Then the butcher, what about him? It
might possibly be he, after all, who is the assassin, for from
his early and long association with Thralldom, he is far more
likely than William, to have acquired the secrets of these
passages." He shook his head. "I can do nothing there, however,
until I learn if he was away from home the night before
last."</p>

<p>He sat on for a long while. "And there are other things I do
not understand," he murmured, "for I have thoughts, yes, I have
thoughts&mdash;&mdash;" But his voice trailed away into silence
and he stared and stared into the shadows cast by the
lantern.</p>

<p>Presently he looked at the watch Croupin had lent him and at
once yawned sleepily, and leant back with what comfort he could,
against the hard wall.</p>

<p>"Really, I could drop off to sleep again," he whispered. "I am
still dreadfully tired." And drop off he did, for in a couple of
minutes at most, he was snoring deeply.</p>

<p>An hour passed&mdash;two&mdash;and he was still asleep. The
lantern burned low, waved and flickered and finally went out.</p>

<p>The detective's sleep was deep and long but at last he awoke
with a sharp cry, for a rat was biting at his hand. He sprang up
with a savage imprecation and finding he was in total darkness,
flashed his torch in bewilderment, not realising for the moment
what had happened.</p>

<p>Then he ruefully regarded the lantern and touching it with his
hands, found it was quite cold. He shook it. It was empty.</p>

<p>"Now, that's awkward," he whistled, "for when the party who
has been using it comes down, the first thing he'll want to do
will be to light it. He'll find it empty and know at once that
someone else has been here."</p>

<p>Then suddenly he caught his breath and instantly switched off
his torch.</p>

<p>He had heard muffled sounds somewhere between the walls.</p>

<p>For a few moments he could not locate them and then he
realised that they came from behind that part of the wall against
which he had been leaning when he had fallen asleep. They grew
louder and were unmistakably now the footsteps of someone who was
approaching the wall.</p>

<p>He darted into the nearest dungeon and stood with his head
leaning out into the corridor. A long, thin streak of light
appeared through the cracks of the wall.</p>

<p>"At last! at last!" he whispered excitedly. "Blind chance is
playing into my hands!" and he snatched out his pistol and held
it ready.</p>

<p>A short silence followed but the light was still there.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the wall opened and after a moment's hesitation
a man stepped cautiously into the corridor and swung a lantern
high above his head. In the other hand, he was holding a large
revolver. The man was tall and thin and his cap was pulled down
over his forehead.</p>

<p>"Naughton Jones!" gasped the detective disgustedly. "He's
beaten me again!"</p>

<p>He stepped out into the corridor and Jones perceiving his
approach, instantly covered him with the revolver.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, please, Mr. Jones," he exclaimed quickly. "This
is the only suit I have."</p>

<p>The great investigator regarded him intently for a moment and
then pocketed the revolver. There was no expression of surprise
upon his face.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's you again, is it?" he remarked coldly. "We are
always meeting one another, it seems." He nodded significantly.
"I was aware no one had heard of you for four days and I quite
thought Rawlings had got you. I am agreeably surprised."</p>

<p>"But how did you get here?" asked Larose excitedly.</p>

<p>"Very simple," was the reply. "I found a movable stone in one
of the chambers under the Priory. It opened into a passage, and I
followed the passage here."</p>

<p>"But how did you pick out the stone?" went on Larose.</p>

<p>"Very simple, again," said Jones. "I followed a trail of blood
by the plantation and it led me there. There was a mark of blood
also upon the stone. Without doubt Rawlings had been upon the war
path again." He looked rather annoyed. "I found the opening just
after lunch to-day, but had to return to Minsmere to borrow a
lantern, otherwise"&mdash;he spoke carelessly&mdash;"the whole
business would not have taken me half an hour." He looked
intently at the detective. "But how do you come to be here?"</p>

<p>"I have been keeping watch in these dungeons," replied Larose,
"from the night following the day upon which I last saw you."</p>

<p>"Then Lord Thralldom himself has commissioned you," remarked
Jones. "I thought his lordship&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord Thralldom knows nothing about it," interrupted Larose
quickly. He hesitated a moment. "I am here with the connivance of
someone in the castle."</p>

<p>"Someone in the castle, and not Lord Thralldom!" exclaimed
Jones. He looked incredulous. "Whom?"</p>

<p>Larose hesitated again. "One of the servants," he replied in
some annoyance.</p>

<p>"Oh! that's it, is it?" commented Jones frowningly and as if
he did not quite approve. "Then you'd better be careful of the
company you keep for, unless I am very much mistaken, one of the
footmen there&mdash;I gather in the village that he goes under
the name of William&mdash;is an escaped convict, from the
Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. I am sure I recognise
him."</p>

<p>The detective was too dumbfounded to speak. He felt, as
Croupin has once expressed it, as if a bomb were bursting in his
brain.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Jones angrily, "and I was grossly insulted this
morning. I called to speak to Lord Thralldom and sent in my card,
but he refused to see me and I was informed to that effect in an
offensive message by the mouth of the same footman." He tossed
his head contemptuously. "I was calling, too, to do Lord
Thralldom a service for last night I came upon a man killing his
sheep and was intending to put his lordship in the way of
apprehending the thief."</p>

<p>"Killing his sheep!" ejaculated Larose. "Another madman!"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," replied Jones calmly. "Just an
ordinary case of larceny. The fellow was killing the animals and
taking the carcases away and, from the expeditious manner in
which he cut their throats, I should say he was a butcher by
trade. He was driving a Ford touring car."</p>

<p>Surprise upon surprise was avalanching itself upon the
bewildered detective. "What was he like?" he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I really can't say," was the reply, "except that he was tall
and gaunt. I never saw his face. I did not interfere, because I
was not desirous of any publicity. However, I took the number of
his car although that may be of no help for the plates were
obviously substitutes. Apparently they had only just been screwed
on, for the oil on the nuts was clean."</p>

<p>"Then you went up close to the car?" asked the detective very
astonished.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," replied Jones carelessly, "and I watched all the
proceedings from start to finish. It happened in this way," he
went on. "It was getting on for eleven and I was lying upon the
watch, behind some oak trees there, when he drove up and parked
his car. I should say, too, it was not his first visit to the
spot, firstly, because of the oil marks upon the ground that I
had noticed before he arrived, and secondly, because there was no
hesitation in the manner in which he backed his car into the
deepest shadows. I was interested, naturally, but I knew it was
not Rawlings, for he has never driven a car and moreover hates
the things." He regarded Larose intently. "You knew that, of
course?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Larose, "he was knocked down by one in the early
days of motoring and never forgave it."</p>

<p>"Well," continued Jones, "I soon saw what the fellow was up
to. There were some sheep camping near and he was in among them
and had grabbed two before any of them had had time to get up.
Then he cut their throats, jumped upon them, let them bleed for a
little while, and had bundled them in the back of the car and was
driving off, all in less than six or seven minutes. A very neat
job, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, what about the footman?" asked Larose anxiously.</p>

<p>Jones smiled. "Ah! I was digressing, I see," he said. "Well,
about that man, if I am right and I almost am positive about it,
he is Carl Heidelburg who escaped from Broadmoor about three
years ago. He is a homicidal lunatic, and he killed his employer,
Sir Rainton Baynes, the great architect, just because the latter
had had occasion mildly to reprimand him. He was condemned to
death by Judge Bambury at the Leeds Assizes, but he was held to
be insane and confined in Broadmoor. He escaped from there,
however, about six months later and the relatives of the
architect were so incensed firstly because he had not been
hanged, and secondly because he had escaped, that they offered a
reward of &pound;2,000 for his capture. The reward, I understand,
still holds good, but I shall not be able to move in the matter
until I get him identified by a friend of mine, the chief warder
of the asylum who at the present moment is in the South of
France. I have, however, communicated with the gentleman, and he
is now on his way home. I have said nothing to the official
police because the reward is worth having and I want to be sure
of it for myself." He looked hard at the detective. "But that is
digressing again. Now what are you watching here for?"</p>

<p>"For a homicidal lunatic," replied Larose dryly, "who has
committed several murders and who, I know for certain, is
frequenting these dungeons."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Jones frowning, "and do you suspect
anybody?"</p>

<p>"Yes, this same William for one person," replied Larose.</p>

<p>"Then whom has he murdered?" asked Jones quickly.</p>

<p>"Lord Thralldom's bailiff among others," was the calm
reply.</p>

<p>The frown upon the face of the great investigator darkened.
"Mr. Larose," he said coldly, "you are a very obstinate man, and
in spite of the overwhelming evidence I have produced that
Rawlings is still alive, you yet refuse to credit anything I have
said and when Rawlings is before us in the flesh, it will be one
of the most humiliating moments of your life."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Larose quietly. "He is before us now. He is
down here."</p>

<p>"What!" almost shouted Jones incredulously. "He is a prisoner
here!"</p>

<p>The detective nodded. "Yes," he replied quietly, "but it is
not I who am his guardian." He stretched out his hand. "Here,
give me that lantern, and you come with me."</p>

<p>Jones handed over the lantern without a word and followed
after the detective. His expression was that of a man who was
endeavouring to mask a certain feeling of uneasiness under one of
contemptuous disdain.</p>

<p>With a face of stone, he saw Larose put down the lantern and
kneel in the empty corridor. As cold as ice, he watched him lift
up the big flag and it was only when he bent over the gaping
opening and a whiff of the tainted air was wafted up to him from
below, that he allowed his features to give any indication of the
real state of his mind.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he gasped. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>Larose nodded and leading the way down the steps, guided him
across the earth floor chamber up to the side of the well. Then
they both knelt down and the detective flashed his torch.</p>

<p>"That, I think, is the bailiff," he whispered. "See, the
pyjamas showing, where the jacket has burst."</p>

<p>The great investigator was breathing hard. He frowned and
scowled and appeared to be most annoyed that he should have been
proved to be in the wrong.</p>

<p>In a few moments, however, his interest in what lay before him
overwhelmed all other feelings, and in perfect calmness and as
unconcerned as if he were only regarding objects under a glass
case, he then proceeded to enunciate his opinions.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is Rawlings," he agreed. "He always wore a double-breasted jacket. And that's the inn-keeper's hand&mdash;his wife
told me he had lost the tip of one forefinger. But do you know
who all the others are? Who's the woman there?"</p>

<p>Then Larose had almost to drag him away. The detective was not
inclined for any prolonged conversation over the foul air of the
well and it was not until they were once more in the corridor and
the flag had been let down, that he answered the question.</p>

<p>"But there was a body there when I looked this morning," he
added, "and I do not know whose it can be. It was the last one
thrown in and was in a perfect state of preservation. It had a
brown suit on; it had dark hair and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An oval face," supplemented Jones sharply, "an aquiline nose,
a small mouth, long, shapely hands and a gold signet ring."</p>

<p>"Yes," exclaimed the detective very astonished. "You know who
he is?"</p>

<p>"Martin Fenner," replied Jones, "an associate of the gang that
I was instrumental in laying by the heels last night, and the
individual that I have mentioned to you I have encountered
several times upon the marshes." He snapped his fingers together.
"I have been wondering all along why he was not in their
company." He laid his hand upon the detective's arm. "Now let us
sit down somewhere. You must have a lot to tell me."</p>

<p>And certainly Larose had a lot to tell him, but he did not
disclose everything. He resolutely declined to name his associate
in the castle, and he made no mention of Ann Devenham or young
Harden, also he said nothing about the footman having been
drugged.</p>

<p>Naughton Jones listened intently with his eyes never for one
moment straying from the detective's face. Towards the end of the
recital, he was frowning hard.</p>

<p>"Well," he said at last, "I must ask you to oblige me in one
way. I have been more open with you than you have been with me
and I deserve some consideration." He rapped out quickly as if he
were giving an order. "I want no interference with that footman
for forty-eight hours. He is my bird and I want to bring him
down. I want to claim that reward."</p>

<p>"I'm not certain," began Larose, "whether&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm very sorry to steal any of your thunder,"
interrupted Jones quickly, "but as you admitted that you had no
direct evidence against the man, it was practically only my
disclosure to you of his being a homicidal lunatic that warrants
you making any arrest. You would not have dared to do it if I had
not furnished you with that information."</p>

<p>Larose hesitated. "But he is dangerous," he said, "and to
wait, may endanger more lives."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Jones quickly, "for we will block up that
opening in the Priory and he won't possibly be able to get
out."</p>

<p>"All right," said the detective after a moment, "until the day
after to-morrow then, and you are to do nothing without advising
me. I will come up with you when he is apprehended." He spoke
briskly. "Now let me have some of the oil out of your lantern.
I've emptied all mine and it won't do for anyone to see that it
has been interfered with."</p>

<p>They had just effected the exchange of the oil when suddenly,
they both, as in one movement, jerked up their heads and stared
open-mouthed at each other. They had heard a noise behind the
wall. "Quick," exclaimed Larose, "someone's coming. Put out the
light and into this dungeon, quick."</p>

<p>The lantern was instantly extinguished and they sprang back in
the darkness. The noises came nearer and then, as once before,
the detective saw a streak of light appear on the wall.</p>

<p>The door opened and, following upon some hoarse whisperings,
three men emerged into the corridor. Two of them were in ordinary
clothes but the third was in the uniform of an inspector of
police and Larose recognised Inspector Ferguson, of
Halesworth.</p>

<p>Naughton Jones was quite calm and unflurried. "They're
police," he said quietly in the detective's ear. "Really, the
locals here are more efficient than I thought," and he proceeded
at once to step into the corridor, into the light of the lantern
they were holding up.</p>

<p>"That's him," cried one of the plain-clothes men quickly, and
he sprang forward and seized Jones by the arm. "Who are you now,
and what are you after here?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"My name is Naughton Jones," began the great investigator
haughtily. "I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the name apparently struck no chord of memory in the man's
mind, for he interrupted brusquely. "Well, whoever you are, we're
suspicious about you and we've been watching you for two days. We
want to know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's all right, he's a colleague of mine," called out Larose,
stepping into the corridor, too. He laughed merrily. "Good
afternoon, Inspector. How do you do?"</p>

<p>The Inspector gave a cry of glad surprise. "Good heavens! What
a relief!" he exclaimed. "I've been very anxious about you and
was sure something bad had happened. I sent two men out and they
got upon the track of the gentleman and saw where he went in
through the wall of the Priory. One came and fetched me
and"&mdash;he took off his cap and wiped his forehead&mdash;"here
I am."</p>

<p>The rather mortified Naughton Jones was introduced and partial
explanations followed. Then the Inspector took Larose aside.</p>

<p>"Ridge has been out for two nights, since you've been
missing," he whispered, "but he managed to dodge us both
times"&mdash;his voice was hoarse in its
impressiveness&mdash;"and this morning one of my men paid a
secret visit to his garage and saw blood upon the floor of his
tourer. Lots of it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," whispered back Larose, "and I'll put you wise
about him later on when my friend here isn't present. Turnbull's
only been stealing sheep."</p>

<p>They chatted together for a few minutes and then, upon the
Inspector suggesting that, as he and his men were there and might
never get another chance, they should see something of the
dungeons, Naughton Jones, taking charge of the lantern, at once
proceeded to act as guide and conductor, and from his
condescending manner it might almost have been assumed that he
himself was the lord of the castle.</p>

<p>Then they all filed away along the passage under the moat, and
during their uncomfortable journey there, for the passage was
barely five feet in height, Larose considered with many a pang
for what dreadful tragedies it had been so recently
responsible.</p>

<p>Arriving at the other end among the ruined walls of the
Priory, for a good ten minutes they all worked hard, piling up
great slabs of stone where the door opened, thereby rendering it
quite impossible for one person, by himself, to clear the
entrance. Then, promising the Inspector that he would look him up
the following morning, Larose and Naughton Jones parted from him
and his men and returned to the inn upon the Haven.</p>

<p>"I am putting up there, myself, now," the great man announced,
"for one reason because it is imperative I should be in close
proximity to the telephone during the next forty-eight hours, and
for another, because the people where I lodge are becoming too
inquisitive about me. They don't understand my being out so late
at night and I am sure they have been talking to the local
policeman about it. At any rate, I have encountered the fellow
upon more occasions than I can believe to be mere coincidences,
and also he eyes me in a manner that I consider impertinent.
Indeed, I am almost inclined to report him to headquarters."</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the inn, Larose asked the landlady to ring up
the castle and have a message taken to Ann that a Mrs. Smith was
wanting to speak to her. The girl was at the other end very
quickly, and then the detective spoke to her himself.</p>

<p>In carefully guarded language, he asked her to inform Monsieur
Antoine that he had left the castle, but would the chef please
meet him upon the beach the following afternoon. Also, he
reminded her of her promise to on no account go down into the
dungeons.</p>

<p>Then receiving her emphatic assurance that she would do as he
bade her, he rang off, and after a good meal, retired to bed. He
resolutely refused to allow his thoughts to wander, and making
his mind a blank, soon dropped off to sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; THE MASTER MINDS</h2>

<p class="first">THE following day it was almost as if the
detective were a gentleman of leisure. He rose late, he took
plenty of time over his breakfast and then, for an hour and more,
he sat smoking upon the beach. He saw nothing of Naughton Jones
and was glad to learn from the landlord that the latter had been
out and about before seven, and was not likely to be in for
lunch. The landlord also informed him that Jones had been called
to the telephone before six.</p>

<p>Towards eleven o'clock the detective took out his car and
drove over to Halesworth to keep his appointment with the
Inspector there, driving very slowly, however, and stopping many
times to admire the views.</p>

<p>He was back again at the inn in time for lunch and then,
towards three o'clock, took up his position under the cliffs
about half a mile away, at the spot he had appointed for a
rendezvous with Raphael Croupin.</p>

<p>The lively Frenchman arrived on time and was prepared for a
thousand excited questionings, but Larose cut him short by asking
to be first informed as to all that had been happening at the
castle since their last meeting.</p>

<p>"Oh! it has been like a hive of bees ever since," exclaimed
Croupin with great animation, "and policemen and detectives have
been arriving all the time to talk with the lord and examine how
those wretches got in. A tremendous fuss is being made, and to-day the Chief Constable himself arrived and stayed to lunch."</p>

<p>"And Lord Thralldom," asked Larose, "is he knocked up?"</p>

<p>"Knocked up!" echoed Croupin sarcastically, "why, it's taken
ten years off his age! He is full of energy and like a raging
lion. Yesterday, he was on the go all day long, and ordering the
policemen about as if they were his private servants. James says,
too, that at lunch just now he was insisting to the Chief
Constable that the police force at Saxmundham must be doubled and
that any attempt upon his pictures should be made a hanging
matter. He's going to speak about it in the House of Lords."</p>

<p>He grinned. "Poor old James and the butler are in for a bad
time. They are to sleep on mattresses now in the picture gallery,
with loaded shot-guns as well as pistols by their sides. James is
terrified because he is sure there is something wrong with the
shot-gun the lord has given him and that it will go off without
anyone touching the trigger. Both the footmen, and the butler,
too, are to carry their pistols about with them, night and day
now."</p>

<p>"And William?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>Croupin nodded significantly. "He is stunned and cowed and has
got all the fight knocked out of him. He avoids the policemen as
much as he can and slinks out of our hall whenever any of them
come in." He looked up excitedly to Larose. "But tell me all that
has happened to you?"</p>

<p>Then with widely dilated pupils and with many "Ohs" and "Ahs"
Croupin listened to the detective's tale. Larose kept nothing
back but related in detail everything that had happened.</p>

<p>"So, Meester Jones will take all the glory from you,"
exclaimed the Frenchman disgustedly, when the recital was ended,
"and this Carl Heidelburg will be actually in the hands of the
police before you can tell what you know"&mdash;he looked very
sorrowful&mdash;"and we have both run such risks."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Larose, "we have both run such risks." Croupin
went on in great dejection. "This Jones is spoiling everything,
for when they have arrested William, I do not see even then, how
you can bring your charge against him. You are not ready, for you
cannot prove yet that it is William." He threw out his hands. "We
know it, but there is no actual proof. What can you do?"</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "I am very troubled, Monsieur," he
said, "very troubled indeed."</p>

<p>They talked on for an hour and more and then Croupin rose up
to return to the castle.</p>

<p>"And it may be good-bye," he said sadly, "for any moment I may
be going now. When they learn who William is, the police may
start making enquiries about all of us servants and
then"&mdash;he laughed impudently&mdash;"they will find out that
my testimonials were forged."</p>

<p>"Tut! tut!" frowned the detective, "and it was only yesterday
that Mr. Jones was warning me to beware of what company I kept."
He smiled. "Still I am most grateful to you, Monsieur Croupin,
and I wish I could repay you in some way."</p>

<p>"Tut! tut!" mimicked Croupin, "it has been a great adventure
to me and you have repaid me many times." He bowed. "You have
repaid me by your trust in me, in me Raphael Croupin, the wicked
thief." He laughed merrily. "How strange life is! Six weeks ago I
came here to steal the Rubens from the lord and to-day, he has
given me &pound;50 because I rang the big bell to prevent others
taking it."</p>

<p>"But seriously," said Larose, "I am anxious about you.
Naughton Jones may be spiteful because he knows you always make
fun of him, and it is quite likely he will have told the police
that he met you here the other day."</p>

<p>Croupin shrugged his shoulders. "Well, I'll risk it, anyhow, a
little longer, for I must see what happens to-morrow." He laughed
slyly. "You are very thoughtful to-day, Meester Larose, and you
are a great man and I should never be surprised if at the last
moment you did not manage somehow to trump this Jones's ace!" and
waving his hand in good-bye, he strolled away humming a lively
time.</p>

<p>Larose sat on for a long while after Croupin had left him and
never once did it seem that he took his eyes off the sea. Indeed,
from his concentration it might almost have been thought that he
was expecting to see something rise up out of the waves. At last,
however, he looked at his watch and with a troubled sigh rose up
and walked back to the inn. He chatted to the landlord for a few
minutes and then went into the dining-room for the evening
meal.</p>

<p>He sat down to the table by himself, but almost immediately
Naughton Jones arrived and took the chair opposite to him. The
great man was looking very pleased with himself.</p>

<p>"I have had a busy and interesting day," he said, "and have
put in quite a lot of good work. I had another look at that
footman, too, and am satisfied he is the man I want."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Larose, aroused to interest at once. "You've
been up to the castle!"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" smiled Jones. "Why not? I induced the village
grocer to take me up with him in his van, when he was delivering
stores there this morning. I made out I had an overwhelming
desire for a close up view of the castle and I sat inside at the
back, well away among the tea and sugar and the pots of jam. I
had a pair of field glasses with me and was very entertained. I
saw Lord Thralldom himself. He was busy outside the castle door
superintending the unpacking of a big dynamo that I understand is
going to be installed for the electrocution of anyone who in
future attempts to raid his paintings. He was strutting about
like an old turkey-cock and giving orders all round. He looked
very active and full of life."</p>

<p>"He's a remarkable old man," commented Larose
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He certainly is," went on Jones, "but of course it was
William who interested me most, and I had him under my glasses
for quite a long time, not five yards away. Every line of his
face showed up and he looked careworn and tired, I thought. But
he was different to-day to the last time I saw him, for then he
had all the appearance of a man who had been taking drugs."</p>

<p>"Did he see you?" asked Larose, avoiding the searching eyes of
the investigator.</p>

<p>"Oh! dear me no," laughed Jones. "I was crouching among the
treacle tins, and indeed was being so careful to make certain
that I should not be seen that I trod upon a few of them." He
passed his hand down one leg of his trousers and looked annoyed.
"I believe I have some of the syrup adhering to me now."</p>

<p>The detective made no comment. He was in no mood for
conversation, and was wishing Jones would let him eat his meal in
peace, but Jones was not to be denied and ambled on.</p>

<p>"Hark! hear those church bells!" he exclaimed. "There must be
a service on to-night. Very pretty, but very sad," he went on
musingly. "Yes, there is always a sadness in church bells, for
they remind us how uncertain is our life here. They chill,
somehow, those feelings of hope and yearning that we all have for
length of days and they strike some chord of sentiment in us that
is most unreasonable and peculiar. Why, I have known men who
could cut your throat for half a note, stand listening to them
with their eyes filled with tears."</p>

<p>The night was cold and with the remains of the meal cleared
away, the two remained on sitting before the fire. Naughton Jones
was lively and talkative, but the detective was very quiet and
spoke as little as he could. He wanted to think.</p>

<p>Presently Jones stopped to light his pipe, and the detective
making no attempt to carry on the conversation, contented himself
with staring into the fire.</p>

<p>Then Jones rubbed his hands together and smiled happily.
"Well, to-morrow," he said, "should be a great day in both our
lives, for I am going to earn &pound;2,000 and you, if you take
your courage in your hands"&mdash;he spoke in an easy and
conversational tone&mdash;"are going to arrest Lord
Thralldom."</p>

<p>A long silence followed and even, it seemed the fire ceased to
crackle and the embers ceased to burn. For a few moments it might
almost have been as if Larose had not heard, for he made no
movement and did not withdraw his eyes from the fire. Then he
turned his head slowly and regarded Jones with an intent
stare.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the latter and now himself looking in the fire,
"you have played a lone hand and deserve all the credit that will
accrue." He shook his head. "But your difficulties are not all
over yet, for I doubt if you will find it easy to induce anybody
to sign the warrant for his lordship's arrest."</p>

<p>Still Larose did not speak. His face was like a mask and he
continued to stare stonily at his companion. The great
investigator looked back at him again, and now smiled an amused
smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are naturally surprised," he said, "but since our
little talk in the vaults yesterday, I have thought over
everything and can come to no other conclusion but that you are
sure now it is Lord Thralldom himself who is this unknown
assassin."</p>

<p>He bent forward and went on very quietly. "You see, Mr.
Larose, with no intention at all to flatter you, our two brains
were cast in very similar moulds and in consequence I am able to
follow the workings of your mind almost as easily as I can follow
the workings of my own."</p>

<p>He raised one long forefinger to emphasise what he was going
to say. "Now, your description of what took place that night when
you were imprisoned in the dungeons was so graphic that when I
came to go over it afterwards, it was almost as if I had been
there myself, and I was soon analysing everything in exactly the
same manner that I was sure you had done. Then your doubts as to
the footman being the actual assassin became my doubts, and I was
soon hot upon the other trail. Of course," he added quickly, "it
may be that you unconsciously stressed upon the points that were
troubling you, but I was soon, very soon, like you, of the
opinion that there had been two visitors to the dungeons that
night; first Lord Thralldom and then this Carl Heidelburg." He
shrugged his shoulders. "Like you, I fought against the idea, but
in the end, as with you again, it triumphed over me."</p>

<p>Larose spoke at last. "You are a great Master, Mr. Jones," he
said quietly, "and what I obtain with infinite labour, comes to
you by intuition alone."</p>

<p>Jones patted him smilingly upon the arm. "A very pretty
compliment, sir," he said warmly, "very pretty indeed." He
laughed. "But here, at all events, you yourself have helped me
most materially to form my ideas. You told me, and although you
may not have realised it, you repeated it twice, so that I could
see what was in your mind, that when you were shut in the dungeon
that night, the light that first showed under the door was slow
and wavering, but the second time, it came and went in quick
jerks. That suggested to me two different persons at the
different times. One, tired and exhausted by the labour of
carrying a corpse for a long way, and the other vigorous and
fresh for his warfare upon the rats. I was the more imbued with
this idea because one man had been silent and the other had
accompanied his activities with laughter and shouts." He looked
enquiringly at Larose. "Now, those were your thoughts, too, were
they not?"</p>

<p>The detective nodded. "And they passed along the corridor
quite differently," he said. "One shuffled and the other
ran."</p>

<p>"Then the idea is preposterous," went on Jones frowning, "that
any comparative newcomer to the castle, such as this Heidelburg
is, could possibly have discovered those steps leading down under
the corridor to that well. No one would have lighted upon them by
chance in a thousand years, and the man who has been using them
must either have been actually shown where the particular flag is
and how it lifts up, or else&mdash;he must have seen the flag
upraised, as you did."</p>

<p>He paused a moment and then nodded emphatically. "So when I
had dismissed the idea that this footman was the assassin, my
mind at once then turned to the owner of the castle for he, of
all people, I told myself, would most likely be in possession of
its secrets." He raised his voice stridently. "Lord Thralldom
answers so well, too, to the temperament and disposition of the
very man we want. Not only is he eccentric, to the point of
insanity, but we have with him the clear outstanding motive for
these murders. He is obsessed with the idea that all trespassers
upon the Thralldom lands are after his paintings and it is the
common talk of the villages, that at night he abrogates to
himself the duty of protecting the castle." He looked as shocked
as if some dreadful sacrilege had been committed. "Why! I myself
was fired upon one night, as I have told you, and I am convinced
now that the bullet came from the direction of the castle." He
nodded emphatically. "Yes, there can be no doubt at all. Lord
Thralldom is the man you want."</p>

<p>Larose sat up stiffly in his chair. "I agree to a very great
extent with what you say, Mr. Jones," he said slowly, "but still,
with all my suspicions about Lord Thralldom it is not yet clear
to me that I can definitely discard the idea that this footman is
the murderer."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" scoffed Jones, "then you think he first found the
secret door in the chapel, then that leading down under the moat
and then, by some miraculous chance he came to know what was
under the flag-stone in the corridor and how it was lifted up!"
He laughed mockingly. "Then, stimulated by these discoveries and
finding all these conveniences ready to his hand, the idea came
to him suddenly that he would embark upon a course of murder. Do
you really think that?"</p>

<p>Larose laughed back. "Hardly," he replied, "but what is
troubling me is this. We know now without any doubt that this
footman is insane and already a murderer, and unhappily for my
peace of mind, under certain not wholly improbable circumstances,
everything can still suggest to us that he and not Lord Thralldom
may be the assassin we are looking for."</p>

<p>"No," said Jones sharply, "we can rub Heidelburg out once and
for all, firstly because there is no motive in his case for
committing the murders, and secondly because he could never have
found those passages and that well."</p>

<p>"But we need not necessarily expect to find a motive," argued
Larose, "for a man of insane mind surely does not have a motive
for all he does." He smiled. "Now what motive can you suggest
that the footman had to compel him to go battering at those rats
with the spade?"</p>

<p>Jones made no answer, and the detective went on, "Then is it
not possible that the footman learnt all about those passages
from some book or plan of the castle that is in the possession of
Lord Thralldom? Remember, you have told me that the man is an
architect by profession, and I learnt from Lord Thralldom he had
been for six months in the service of Professor Dangerton, the
well-known archaeologist. So all his training would assist him in
making good in any searching he was undertaking."</p>

<p>"But if any such book or plan existed," scowled Jones, "his
lordship would see to it that no one could get hold of it."</p>

<p>"Still, the footman has had every opportunity," said Larose,
"and constantly in attendance upon Lord Thralldom when the latter
has been asleep or ill, he may easily have taken his keys and
opened drawers and desks everywhere." He spoke most impressively.
"The man must have got a hint from somewhere, to have been able
to find that opening in the chapel wall and remember, he is most
cunning and capable or he would never have escaped from Broadmoor
in the way that you told me he did. I don't forget you dwelt upon
how his architectural knowledge had helped him there?"</p>

<p>Jones looked very disgusted. "Then you have gone back on the
first opinion you held," he said, "that two men came down into
the dungeons that night. You think now that there was only
one?"</p>

<p>Larose hesitated. "I don't know what to think," he replied. "I
was dazed and drunkenly sleepy then, and I've no idea how long a
time elapsed between the passing of the two lights before my
door. The tired man may have rested and become refreshed enough
to go again after those rats." He spoke most respectfully. "You
see, Mr. Jones, I am putting everything before you to get your
advice. The matter is vital to me, for if I dare to act upon my
own, as I want to, and intimidate the people here into issuing a
warrant for the arrest of Lord Thralldom, and then it turns out I
have made a mistake"&mdash;he shook his head gloomily&mdash;"then
I am disgraced and ruined for ever."</p>

<p>"I think you have a clear case," said Jones firmly, "and I
shall be disappointed in you if you do not strike and strike
quickly."</p>

<p>The detective sighed. "Certainly, so many things came into my
mind," he said, "directly my suspicions were turned upon Lord
Thralldom. For one thing, I went over all you had told me about
those different people who were positive they had seen the
bailiff upon the Thralldom lands at night, many days after I was
certain he had been dead, and I know they must have seen someone
who was not unlike the dead man in appearance. Then I thought of
Lord Thralldom at once, for although much taller than Rawlings,
he stoops a lot and that would take off the height. Also I
argued, who would habitually take walks about Thralldom except
one connected in some way with the estate, and again, whoever the
nightly prowler was, he evidently did not want his identity
disclosed or he would have replied to the hails of those who
accosted him."</p>

<p>"Exactly," commented Jones, "and that was one reason why I was
so certain it was Rawlings. The prowler did not want to be
recognised."</p>

<p>"Then, there was another thing," went on Larose. "I had always
wondered why Lord Thralldom with all his desire to prevent the
approach of strangers to the castle, had never kept any dogs.
That would surely, I thought, have been the first thing to
suggest itself to anyone, for savage dogs would not only have
given an unhealthy reputation to the Thralldom lands, but would
also have been invaluable in giving warning at night. But no,
there were no dogs attached to the castle and not only that, but
other folks on outlying farms could not keep them because of the
poison baits that had been strewn about." He nodded solemnly. "It
was just as if someone were not wanting his excursions anywhere
upon the Thralldom lands to be heralded by the barking of
dogs."</p>

<p>"The poisoning began about two months ago," supplemented
Jones, "towards the end of July. Joe Gregorsen, a Westleton
farmer, lost a fox terrier on the night of Tuesday, August the
first."</p>

<p>"And Rita Ethelton and Augustus Holden were killed on the
13th," said Larose. "You must understand, Mr. Jones," he went on
quickly, "one great doubt I still have, is whether an infirm old
man such as Lord Thralldom appears to be, can possibly possess
the necessary physical strength to carry out these murders. I can
never put away the certainty that the man who attacked me that
night was no weakling. On the contrary, he had great
strength."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" exclaimed Jones, "that's nothing, for in moments of
great excitement all his virility might have come back. The
affection he now suffers from is, I gather, purely of nervous
origin, and there are cases recorded in medical annals, where
persons so afflicted have accomplished feats of superhuman
strength, almost upon their very death-beds."</p>

<p>"Well," said Larose, "I have certainly noticed in my
interviews with him, that the moment his anger is roused, he
becomes a different man. He sits up erectly or he strides about
the room and there is no sign of weakness about him then, except
that he breathes very heavily." He nodded. "And the man who
attacked me was breathing exactly as I have heard Lord Thralldom
breathe, and exactly as the man was breathing that night as he
passed the dungeon door, labouring under the burden of the dead
man."</p>

<p>A short silence followed, and then Jones said briskly. "Well,
I repeat, in my opinion, you have a clear case and I think you
are fully justified in effecting his arrest."</p>

<p>"But it is not clear," persisted Larose, "for I have no direct
evidence to present to a court of law."</p>

<p>Naughton Jones looked very angry. "You have found the bodies
of five murdered people," he said sternly, "in a place that Lord
Thralldom has told you is only accessible to him. Therefore, an
explanation is demanded from him as to how they got there. Good
gracious!" he went on, "suppose you found a dead body in the
cellar of a man's house, when that man was known to have a grudge
against the person dead, would you not take him in charge at
once, if only on suspicion? Well, treat Lord Thralldom as you
would an ordinary person and don't let the heads take all the
credit from you." He shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.
"That's all the advice I shall give you."</p>

<p>The detective rose up from his chair. "Well, I'm off to bed,
now," he said, "and I shall think it over. At any rate I shall go
up and see Lord Thralldom to-morrow morning, and be guided by
what I learn then. Good night."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; LAROSE PREPARES TO STRIKE</h2>

<p class="first">THE following morning, as if exhausted with all
the excitements of the past forty eight hours, Lord Thralldom
breakfasted in bed. During the course of the meal, he received a
message through the extension telephone by his bedside that
Larose would be much obliged if he would kindly grant him an
interview that morning, and frowning in some annoyance, he had
replied that the detective could come up at half-past ten.</p>

<p>He finished his breakfast and then leisurely bathing and
dressing, took himself into a small room adjoining his bedroom, a
sort of study and business room, and proceeded to go through the
morning newspapers.</p>

<p>But he was very thoughtful about something, and evidently not
much interested in the news, for he frowned many times, looked
out of the window very often, and muttered a lot to himself.
Finally, he snapped his fingers together as if he had at last
come to some decision and pressed the bell upon the desk. James
at once appeared.</p>

<p>"Tell Miss Devenham that I wish to speak to her," he said, and
when the footman was leaving the room, he added&mdash;"I expect
that man again from Scotland Yard, at half-past ten. Show him up
here at once when he arrives and then, when he has been here five
minutes, one of you come in and say I am wanted by the
electricians. You understand, I do not wish him to take up my
time."</p>

<p>"Very good, my lord," said the footman and he left the
room.</p>

<p>Ann appeared very shortly. She looked bright and smiling and
very happy. She had had a letter from John Harden that morning,
saying that he had commenced his annual three weeks' holiday and
would be ringing her up on the morrow to know where they could
meet. She had read the letter many times and it was now tucked in
the bosom of her dress.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom regarded her with feelings of no particular
interest. She was no canvas with oil paint smeared across it,
only just a creature of flesh and blood, and a woman at that.</p>

<p>"Ann," he said quietly, and regarding her in a way which she
thought very strange, "since we had that little conversation in
your room, you have not spoken to anyone about that incident in
the chapel?"</p>

<p>"No, uncle," she replied, rather uneasy at the intentness of
his gaze. "Why should I have spoken about it? It would not
interest anyone."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," he replied, still staring very hard, "of
course not, why should it?" He spoke carelessly. "Well, I
promised you the other day that I would take you down into the
dungeons sometime, and as I shall be going there myself after
luncheon"&mdash;he turned away his eyes at last and looked out of
the window&mdash;"you shall come with me then." His eyes were
back upon her in a sudden flash. "But not a word to anybody," he
added sternly, "not a word to anybody, remember. It is just a
secret between ourselves."</p>

<p>The girl's heart beat unpleasantly. There was more of a
command than a request in his tones and, although she did not
want to offend him, she was remembering her solemn promise to
Larose. She stood, hesitating, not knowing how to frame her
reply.</p>

<p>But Lord Thralldom appeared to take it for granted that an
answer was not required, and producing a bundle of keys from his
pocket, he turned round to his desk and opening a drawer, took
out a bundle of bank notes. He counted off ten of them and held
them out to her.</p>

<p>"Here's a little present of &pound;100," he said. "Your mother
informs me that you want some more clothes and so you and she can
make a trip into Norwich to-morrow and do some shopping. No, you
needn't thank me," he went on as she took the notes. He smiled
peculiarly. "Now, run away and come to me in the library at half
past three." He raised his finger warningly. "But remember, not a
word to anyone where we are going."</p>

<p>The girl laughed embarrassedly. "Thank you very much for the
present, Uncle," she said. "I'm sure it's awfully kind of you."
She stood hesitating. "But about going down into the dungeons,
I'd rather not, if you don't mind. We've had so many horrors
lately and really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not want to go down!" exclaimed Lord Thralldom sharply. "Why
not?"</p>

<p>"Because I don't want to," she replied. "I haven't the
slightest wish."</p>

<p>"But I want you to come with me," he insisted. He smiled
peculiarly again. "I want you for company, my dear."</p>

<p>"But I can't come, Uncle," she pleaded. "I really can't."</p>

<p>There was a gentle knock upon the door and it was opened by
William. Larose was standing behind him.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom had not heard the knock, and with his back
towards the door, he was not aware that it was open.</p>

<p>"But you must come with me," he went on angrily. "I insist
upon it and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Larose, my lord," announced the footman and Lord
Thralldom, turning quickly, composed his features instantly to a
careless and indifferent expression.</p>

<p>"All right," he said quietly. "Ann, you needn't wait. Good
morning, Mr. Larose."</p>

<p>The detective flashed a quick look at the girl as she was
leaving the room, and she returned it with a smile and a little
bow. The door closed behind her and Larose was alone with Lord
Thralldom.</p>

<p>"But I thought you had left the neighbourhood long ago," said
his lordship with a frown. "I was very surprised to learn you
were on the telephone." He motioned to a chair against a small
cupboard built in flush against the wall. "Sit down."</p>

<p>"My enquiries are not yet finished, my lord," replied the
detective, "and I have still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not finished!" interrupted his lordship angrily, "and whilst
you have been wasting the authorities' time, that dastardly
attempt was made upon my possessions here. It is a scandal that a
closer watch should not be kept upon the criminal classes and
that we taxpayers should have to pay out for services that are
not rendered. I understand now that that man Kelly was a known
bad character, with his history among the records of the police."
He looked curiously at Larose. "Well, what do you want now?"</p>

<p>"To go through the underground parts of this castle," replied
Larose promptly. "I am not satisfied that there is no passage
there leading out on to the lands outside."</p>

<p>"Oh!" sneered Lord Thralldom, "you are not, are you?" He spoke
with intense sarcasm. "And you think you can find one, if there
is?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Larose hesitantly, "I should like a half
hour's inspection, anyhow."</p>

<p>"A half hour's inspection!" gasped Lord Thralldom
incredulously. "You think you can search my dungeons, my vaults
and my underground passages&mdash;in half an hour? Good Heavens!"
He laughed scoffingly. "Well, you shall have your chance."</p>

<p>He pinged hard upon the bell in high good humour and William
appeared.</p>

<p>"The petrol lantern from the garage," ordered his lordship
sharply, "and be quick about it, please," and when the footman
had left upon his errand, he looked at his wrist watch and added
to Larose&mdash;"Yes, I can give you just half an hour, and then
I have an appointment with my bailiff, and then I am supervising
some new electric installations." He rubbed his hands together.
"Upon the next occasion when any enterprising gentleman attempts
to enter the gallery without invitation, there will be no need
for any charge to be made against him, for he will be
electrocuted at once."</p>

<p>Larose made no comment, for he was thinking hard. He had
suddenly become very puzzled, for the memory of those awful days
and nights that he had spent in the dungeons had all at once
recurred to him. He did not know what had stirred the memory but
its chords were now vibrating violently and he was asking
himself&mdash;"why?"</p>

<p>"Oh! by-the-bye," went on Lord Thralldom pleasantly, "my
friend, Colonel Wedgwood, the Chief Constable of Suffolk, was
lunching here yesterday, and your name cropping up, he spoke very
highly of you. But I did not know you were an Australian." He
nodded. "I was in South Australia myself once, upon a sheep
station near Lake Frome and I remember I had a very sporting
time. I am pretty good with the rifle, as with all fire-arms, and
my chief occupation was keeping down the wild dogs. I became
quite an expert too, in trapping them and laying the poison
baits."</p>

<p>The eyes of the detective gleamed, but before he had time to
make any comment, William arrived with the petrol lantern.</p>

<p>"We are making a visit to below the castle," explained Lord
Thralldom sharply to the footman, "and you will come and carry
the lantern."</p>

<p>Larose was watching the footman closely, but if the latter
were dismayed by the announcement, his face, nevertheless, did
not show it. Perhaps his eyes moved more restlessly, but that was
all.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom led the way down a long corridor parallel with
the chapel walls, until they came to a large, closely-fitting
door at the end. He unlocked it and they passed inside.</p>

<p>"Mind the steps," he said. "They are rather steep," and the
detective noted he was walking strongly and did not need any
assistance. At the bottom of the steps there was another door and
as Lord Thralldom opened it, Larose started, for he knew then why
he had been so suddenly reminded of his recent sufferings, when
he had been sitting talking to Lord Thralldom upstairs.</p>

<p>He had received just a faint whiff then of the same dank,
suffocating smell that he had endured for so long in the
dungeons, and he realised in a flash, that it must have come from
the cupboard behind where he had been sitting.</p>

<p>But he had no time to pursue this train of thought, for, with
the second door opened and closed behind them, he was once again
in the long, low corridor that he had come to know so well, and
Lord Thralldom was addressing him.</p>

<p>"Well, here you are, sir," he said sarcastically, "and where
will you go first? Hold the light up, William, and never mind the
rats. They won't spring at you, unless they're cornered. Come on,
we'll go straight forward." He turned again to the detective and
spoke most politely. "I am afraid I cannot help you much in your
search, for my eyesight is very poor in semi-darkness, so much
so, that I am quite unable to distinguish between one person and
another when I encounter them."</p>

<p>They walked slowly down along the corridor with Lord Thralldom
stopping many times to point out to the detective the innumerable
chambers with their dark gaping entrances, and the passages that
branched off on either side.</p>

<p>"A good half-hour's work, Mr. Larose," he remarked pleasantly,
"and we've a lot more to see yet. What!" he exclaimed sharply and
turning now to the footman who had just kicked viciously at a big
rat, "you're afraid of them are you, William?"</p>

<p>Then perhaps for the first time his master saw William smile,
as without a word in reply, the footman plunged his arm deep down
into a space between the stones of the wall and with his naked
hand tore out a squealing, struggling rat. He held it up for
inspection for a few moments, and then transferring his grip to
the tail, he whirled the animal round and round and then finally
dashed it to a pulp against the wall.</p>

<p>"Good!" said his lordship grimly, "then I see you are not
afraid." He nodded his head. "I've fought in three wars, but I
would not have cared to do that."</p>

<p>They came in a few minutes to the flags under which lay the
steps leading to the chamber with the hidden well, and Larose
stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"Hullo! what's here?" he exclaimed, sniffing hard. "I smell a
nasty smell."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom and the footman stopped too. "I smell nothing,"
said his lordship sharply. "Do you, William?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord," the footman replied, and his master at once
signed to him to move on.</p>

<p>They went about another twenty yards and then Larose stopped
again. "It's here too," he exclaimed. "A smell of putrefying
flesh."</p>

<p>This time Lord Thralldom seemed more disposed to stop, and for
a few moments sniffed as hard as the detective was doing. Then he
moved on again. "Come on," he said testily. "You can't expect the
perfume of a lady's boudoir in these dungeons, and we are not
here to differentiate between the various smells."</p>

<p>They descended the steps leading down into the vaults and Lord
Thralldom remarked casually, "This is where my ancestors are
buried, going back for more than 800 years."</p>

<p>"And what's that for?" asked the detective pointing to the
long stone slab upon which, three nights previously, he had seen
the dead body.</p>

<p>"For the bearers to rest the coffins upon," replied Lord
Thralldom, "while they prepared the ropes for lowering them into
the graves." He spoke proudly. "Many who have contributed to the
glory of our great country have passed their last moments above
the earth there."</p>

<p>"Very interesting," commented Larose. He approached the slab
and then, with a quick movement, bent down and there was a note
of startled surprise in his voice when after a few moments he
spoke again.</p>

<p>"But what's this?" he asked, pointing to the dark patch. "It
looks like blood."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom turned his head sharply and opened his eyes
very wide. Then instantly his look of astonishment changed to a
scowl and he strode over to where the detective was standing.</p>

<p>"Hold up the light, William," he said, and then after a
moment's inspection, he exclaimed, "Nonsense! it's only some mark
in the stone."</p>

<p>"No, it's blood," said the detective firmly. "I'm sure of
it."</p>

<p>"And how could blood get down here?" sneered Lord Thralldom.
"Really, sir, you have a mind for horrors. First, you smell
putrefying flesh and then you say this mark is blood. Both
impossibilities," and he turned away, as if the matter were
worthy of no more consideration.</p>

<p>The detective followed after him into the vaults. "And all
your ancestors, my lord, are buried under these stones?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Up to the last two generations," replied Lord Thralldom. "The
last interment here, was ninety-three years ago."</p>

<p>Larose appeared to be most interested and stared down at the
big flags. "Thomas, tenth lord of Thralldom," he read out, "in ye
yeare of oure lorde&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off suddenly. "But
this has been lifted recently!"</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom glanced down without much interest. "Another of
your extraordinary ideas," he began, "really&mdash;&mdash;" But
he stopped speaking and stood frowningly regarding the flag.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the petrol lantern that the footman was carrying
began to give trouble. Its fight flickered and wavered and began
to die away, finally it almost went out.</p>

<p>But Larose sprang to the footman's side and snatched the
lantern from him.</p>

<p>"You duffer!" he laughed. "You were turning it off and not
on," and in an aside to himself he added, "I've no hankering to
be here with two madmen in the dark."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom was still looking at the big flag stone. "Now
that's strange," he said, "for bar myself, no one has been down
here for a score and more of years."</p>

<p>But Larose had almost fallen up against him. "Oh! I feel
faint," he exclaimed. "Let's get out of this. I've had quite
enough," and still holding to the lantern, he tottered to the
entrance to the vaults.</p>

<p>The others followed him and proceeding with all haste, for the
detective kept on averting that he was suffocating, they reached
the first door leading up into the castle.</p>

<p>Then a most disconcerting surprise awaited them, for Lord
Thralldom could not find his bunch of keys. He went through every
pocket and flashed the light everywhere upon the ground, but
there was no sign of them anywhere. They were lost.</p>

<p>"Oh! I remember hearing something drop," said the detective
faintly, "when we were in one of those dungeons at the far end,
but I have no recollection which."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have to go back and search," said Lord Thralldom,
looking very annoyed. "We know where we've been and they must he
about somewhere."</p>

<p>"But I can't come with you," wailed Larose, "I don't feel
equal to it. I'll stay here and wait."</p>

<p>"Keep where you are, then," said Lord Thralldom sharply, "or
you may easily get lost."</p>

<p>They left the detective almost upon the verge of collapse, but
the instant they had moved away and he was beyond the rays of the
lantern, a most extraordinary change at once took place in his
condition, for he sprang briskly to his feet and producing the
missing keys from his pocket, began feverishly to insert them,
one after another, in the lock.</p>

<p>"But I'm a most competent pickpocket," he chuckled gleefully,
"and if the worse comes to the worse, I can look up some
reputable practitioner and go into partnership with him. But Oh!
these keys!" he went on ruefully, "There must be quite twenty of
them."</p>

<p>And it was not until he had tried fully half of the bunch that
he found the one he wanted and then to his great relief, he
discovered that it opened the second door as well.</p>

<p>"Now for it," he panted breathlessly as he raced along the
passage, "and I'll see what's in that cupboard. I can't have been
mistaken in that smell."</p>

<p>Coming out of the passage he at once slowed down to an
ordinary walk and it was well he did, for just as he had turned
the corner he met James. The latter smiled and stood aside for
him to pass, for he was by now so accustomed to the coming and
going of detectives that he experienced no surprise at seeing
Larose there, alone.</p>

<p>The detective was soon in the little room and standing before
the cupboard door. He sniffed hard as he began trying out the
keys. "Yes, there's no mistake about it," he whispered. "This is
the dungeon smell."</p>

<p>The fourth key that he inserted was the one that fitted the
lock and in a second the door was swung open. For the moment
then, his heart almost stopped beating in disappointment, for the
cupboard seemed only to contain innumerable ledgers and account
books. Then just as he was beginning to feel almost sick with
disgust, his eyes fell upon a long, plain wooden box below the
bottom shelf, and in a trice he had lifted it out upon the
floor.</p>

<p>It was locked, and from the appearance of the lock, it did not
seem as if the key that belonged to it were upon the bunch that
he had taken from the pocket of Lord Thralldom.</p>

<p>But he was in no mood for any more delay and so picking up the
poker that was lying in the grate, with a few vigorous blows, he
burst in the lock.</p>

<p>Then, it took only ten seconds to satisfy him that he had
found all he wanted.</p>

<p>A pair of big rubber boots, well muddied over with black mud;
a long overall of black cloth, with ugly stains upon it; two
pairs of gloves, the fingers of one of which were caked stiff
with what looked like dried blood, and lastly, a short battle-axe
whose unwiped blade had evidently seen dreadful service at a very
recent date!</p>

<p>And over everything hung the foul, dank, reek of the dungeons.
The detective's face was ghastly white, but he did not tremble
and his hands did not shake as he quickly replaced the box with
its contents and locked the cupboard door.</p>

<p>"My God!" he whispered, "but it's too horrible to believe and
he a peer of the realm, too!"</p>

<p>Then, looking round quickly, he tore a piece of blotting paper
from the pad upon the desk and lighting it at the fire, blew out
the flame and waved the smouldering paper round.</p>

<p>"That should make it all right," he whispered again, "and
he'll not notice that the cupboard has been opened." His voice
hardened. "Now for those two wretches below, and I'm half
inclined to leave them where they are. They both know the way out
and yet neither of them will dare to use that chapel door." He
thought for a moment. "I'd like to, but no, this dreadful drama
must not be played out there."</p>

<p>So, in two minutes he was back again in the dungeon corridor
and saw the faint light of the lantern wavering to and fro in the
distance. He waited a minute or so to recover his breath and then
called out shrilly. "I've got them. They are here. I just felt
them under my feet."</p>

<p>The light stopped wavering. He heard Lord Thralldom's deep
voice and then the latter, followed by the footman, came up to
where he was lying. The lord of the castle looked very tired.</p>

<p>"So, you found them here," he growled as Larose handed him the
keys. "Then you couldn't have heard them drop at all." He eyed
the detective angrily. "Well, I hope this is the last of you.
You've been a great annoyance to me and I'm weary of it."</p>

<p>Not another word was spoken as they ascended the stairs and
then when finally they had reached the hall, Lord Thralldom bade
the detective a curt good morning and and turned off in the
direction of his room.</p>

<p>Larose slipped a half note into the footman's hand. "Whew!" he
exclaimed, "but that was an unpleasant experience and I shouldn't
care to go through it again." He looked round enquiringly. "But
see, I've got a message for Miss Devenham. Do you know where she
is?"</p>

<p>The footman was nervously crushing the note in his hand, for,
with all his impassive appearance, he was inwardly in a state of
great mental stress and was exhausted with the varying emotions
that, like storm upon storm, had just been sweeping through his
brain.</p>

<p>At one moment the foul air of the dungeons had been as a deep
draught of wine to him, and he had had difficulty in remembering
that he was not there alone. Then, he had shaken in terror when
Lord Thralldom had been so curiously regarding the lifted flags,
but anger swiftly supervening, murderous intentions had flared up
and he had started to extinguish the lantern. But the grip of the
detective had recalled him to a less courageous state of mind,
and from then he had been expecting every moment that something
terrible was going to happen to him.</p>

<p>Now, however, the present of the ten shillings from Larose
reassured him in some degree, and he was able to answer calmly
enough.</p>

<p>"I'll fetch her, sir, if you'll wait a few moments."</p>

<p>A minute or so passed and then Ann came quickly into the hall,
with a very anxious expression upon her face. She could not
understand how the detective had dared to send for her so
openly.</p>

<p>Larose wasted no time. "You must leave here almost at once,"
he said sharply, "for within a few hours this will be no place
for you. This afternoon your uncle will learn everything."</p>

<p>"Why, what's happened?" asked the girl with a very white
face.</p>

<p>"Nothing as yet," was the stern reply, "but a lot's going to
happen before this evening. Now look here. At half past two Mr.
Harden will be waiting for you on the marsh road. Slip out and
meet him. Take no luggage with you, only a parcel that you can
carry in your hand. Pack a suit-case if you like and hide it
under the bed in your room. I will pick it up later in the day
and take it to Mr. Harden's lodgings, where it can be forwarded
to any address you leave."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but what am I going away for?" stammered the
girl.</p>

<p>"To be married," and the detective's grim face relaxed to a
kindly smile. "Miss Devenham," he went on earnestly, "I swear to
you solemnly that in all my life I have never tried to render
greater service to any human being, than I am trying to render to
you now. If you have any affection for Mr. Harden, if you have
any love for the man who wants to marry you"&mdash;he was almost
threatening her now&mdash;"do as I implore you and leave this
accursed place for ever. Good-bye. I can't wait a minute.
Remember at half past two standing on the marsh road," and he
walked quickly over to the grille where William was waiting to
let him out.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom had spoken truly when he had told the detective
that he had an appointment with his bailiff in half an hour, and
five minutes after he returned from the visit to the dungeons, he
was interviewing the man in the same room where he had spoken to
Larose.</p>

<p>Their discussion had proceeded for some little time, when Lord
Thralldom had occasion to consult one of the big ledgers in the
cupboard Larose had opened. He had taken down the book he wanted
when his eyes happened to fall upon the box under the bottom
shelf. Perceiving instantly its battered condition, he stared
incredulously for a few moments. Then he lifted the broken lid
and looked inside. But his glance was a very brief one and
closing the box, he replaced the book and locked the
cupboard.</p>

<p>Then with the excuse that he was tired, he at once dismissed
the bailiff and alone again in the room, stood for quite a long
while looking out of the window.</p>

<p>There was no appearance of panic about him, on the contrary he
was quite calm and collected.</p>

<p>He pressed upon the bell and William glided noiselessly into
the room. He looked frowningly at him.</p>

<p>"How long was it," he asked, "that we were looking for those
keys?"</p>

<p>"About ten minutes, I should say, my lord," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And did that detective say anything to you," was the next
question, "after I had left the hall?"</p>

<p>"Nothing particular, my lord. He just waited until he had
spoken to Miss Devenham and then I showed him straight out."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom lifted his eyebrows. "Oh! he spoke to Miss
Devenham did he? How was that?"</p>

<p>"He said he had a message for her," replied the footman, "and
asked me to fetch her."</p>

<p>A short silence followed and then Lord Thralldom said, "Send
James to me," and when the second footman appeared he asked
sharply,</p>

<p>"Did you throw any paper on the fire here, when I was below
the castle with William and that man from Scotland Yard?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord," replied James, "but I put some coal on just
before that Mr. Larose came up. He passed me in the passage."</p>

<p>"He came up here?"</p>

<p>"I think so, my lord. At any rate, he came up those
stairs."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed his lordship. He turned away to the window.
"Thank you. Now, tell Miss Devenham that I want to speak to
her."</p>

<p>"So, so," he murmured when the footman had gone, "then it is
me he has been interested in all along, and by some miraculous
means he has discovered things it is unfortunate for me that he
should know. He did not then ask those questions for nothing just
now, and if I do not take steps to close his mouth, the worst may
happen." He paced up and down the room. "It is a sacred duty that
at all costs I should protect my Rubens, and although I may
regret that upon some occasions I have had to take extreme
measures, still it was right that I acted as I did. With every
hour, innumerable new lives are being given to the world, but a
'Man of Sorrows' such as mine, is painted once only, in the
lifetime of all mankind."</p>

<p>Ann came into the room and, although her face was quite
composed, she was feeling very frightened.</p>

<p>"You wanted me, Uncle?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "I wish to speak to you." He paused a
moment and then asked very sternly, "What did that detective want
with you just now?"</p>

<p>The girl laughed nervously. "He had a message for me from Mr.
Harden," she replied. "They are friends and Mr. Harden wants to
know if I am going to Lady Pouncett's dance next week. He will be
there."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Lord Thralldom eyeing her intently. "And that
was all?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she nodded, "that was all." A little warmth came into
her face. "I don't think you and mother," she went on, "are at
all nice about Mr. Harden, Uncle. I like him and I don't see why
I shouldn't meet him again."</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom was frowning hard, but then all suddenly his
face broke into a pleasant smile. "Well, well," he said as if
rather amused, "perhaps we have been a little too hard on him."
He nodded. "You can go to that dance next week. Tell your mother
I said so. Run away now, I'm busy, but don't forget this
afternoon," and he began turning over the papers on his desk.</p>

<p>"She was probably lying," he said when she had left the room,
"but still it won't matter after this afternoon." He shook his
head and his eyes gleamed fiercely. "No, nothing will ever matter
as long as I keep my Rubens."</p>

<p>He strode quickly over to the cupboard and unlocked it. Then
he drew out the gloves and overall from the box and threw them on
the fire. He picked up the battle-axe and stood regarding it
thoughtfully for a few moments. Then with a grim smile he carried
it into the bathroom and held it under the tap there until the
blade was quite clean. Then he dried it carefully upon one of the
towels and replaced it again in the box, relocking the cupboard
door.</p>

<p>"Now for that man from the Yard," he muttered, and he picked
up the receiver of the telephone upon his desk. "He said he was
staying at Minsmere and so he'll probably be at the inn."</p>

<p>He was put through to the inn, and learning that Larose was
staying there but had just gone out, left a message that he would
like to see the detective, upon an important matter, immediately
upon his return.</p>

<p>Then he opened a drawer in the desk and took out a small
automatic pistol, making sure before he transferred it to his
pocket that it was fully loaded.</p>

<p>"Accidents so often happen with firearms," he remarked dryly,
"and when I am showing this little toy to the gentleman from
Scotland Yard, if it should happen to go off, well," he looked
very disdainful&mdash;"who would dare bring any accusation
against Lord Thralldom?" He nodded his head slowly. "Yes, the
Chief Constable said the fellow always works alone, and delights
in springing dramatic surprises at the very end." He nodded
again.</p>

<p>"Well, I will be the one to spring the surprise this
time."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; THE TOLLING OF THE BELL</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Larose returned to the inn on Minsmere
Haven he found Naughton Jones with the head warder of the
Broadmoor Lunatic Asylum who had arrived about an hour
previously, impatiently awaiting him.</p>

<p>The warder was a very homely-looking man with all the
appearance of an unsophisticated farmer, but he at once proceeded
to question the detective in a sharp and businesslike manner
about the suspected footman at the castle.</p>

<p>"That's him," he said at once, "and we'll have to be darned
careful how we nab him. If we rush him and don't give him any
time to think, he'll be all shaken up and come like a lamb, but
if we give him the chance to get his wits together, he's likely
to give a lot of trouble. He's dangerous when he's roused. We'll
take up a couple of Roberts with us from Saxmundham."</p>

<p>Without waiting for any meal, they drove at once into
Saxmundham, Larose going in his own car and the warder taking
Naughton Jones with him in the car in which he had driven down
from London.</p>

<p>"You go on to the police station," said Larose, "and I'll
follow in ten minutes. I have a call to make, first."</p>

<p>The detective pulled up at the house where he knew John Harden
was lodging and found the latter about to sit down to his midday
meal.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he asked anxiously, the moment he set eyes upon
Larose. "Anything happened?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied Larose, "but something's going to, this
afternoon." He looked him straight in the face. "Now, Mr. Harden,
have you any ready money?"</p>

<p>Harden looked very surprised but answered quickly enough.
"Yes, I can lend you some. How much do you want?"</p>

<p>The detective smiled. "I don't want any, thank you, but now,
have you sufficient to get married straight-away upon, and go for
a nice honeymoon with?"</p>

<p>The young fellow got very red. "Plenty, if it comes to that,"
he replied. He laughed nervously. "But what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, have you got a motor-car?" went on the detective.
Harden nodded. "I can borrow one," he replied. "I've started my
holidays to-day, and a friend has offered to lend me his for as
long as I like."</p>

<p>"Good," said Larose, "then go and borrow it at once. Don't
wait for any dinner. You can make up for that this evening in
very pleasant company." He spoke sharply. "At half past two, Miss
Devenham will be waiting for you upon the marsh road. Drive away
with her at once and marry her to-morrow by special licence in
London."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Larose," began Harden, "I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You want to marry her, don't you?" snapped the detective.</p>

<p>"Want to marry her!" exclaimed the boy. "Good Heavens! Why,
I'd give&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, now's your chance," interrupted Larose. "She's waiting
for you and if you miss this opportunity, you will regret it all
your days, and even if you marry her later, she will never be the
same woman if she's been a spectator of what's going to take
place at the castle this afternoon." His voice was harsh in its
insistence. "Take her away, John, and give her the happiness that
she deserves. Don't ask questions, but we've found the murderer
and a bomb is going to burst within a couple of hours." He drew
in a deep breath. "God only knows what's going to happen."</p>

<p>He walked quickly to the door. "I can't wait." He nodded
smilingly. "If ever a man has had happiness thrust upon him, you
are having it thrust upon you now. Goodbye. Good luck to you.
I'll be seeing you again some day."</p>

<p>He drove up to the police station and found the head warder
and Jones waiting there. Much to the annoyance of them all, the
Inspector was out and they had to wait nearly an hour and a half
before he returned.</p>

<p>The warder's business was quickly dealt with, and then Larose,
with no preliminaries, demanded a warrant for the arrest of Lord
Thralldom upon the charge of having murdered Augustus Holden,
Rita Ethelton and three other persons.</p>

<p>The Inspector was aghast and although Larose briefly outlined
the discoveries he had made, and was supported by Naughton Jones
as to the finding of the bodies in the well, at first resolutely
refused to issue the warrant.</p>

<p>"Lord Thralldom is the chief magistrate here," he argued, with
a very white face, "and I dare not move until I have consulted
headquarters. I'll ring up the Chief Constable in Ipswich. You
can wait until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We can't wait a moment," interrupted Larose sternly. "We have
already wasted an hour and a half here and every minute's delay
is dangerous. Lord Thralldom is a madman and to my certain
knowledge has determined to make away with yet another person
this afternoon." He looked very sternly at the Inspector. "If you
fail in your duty now, it will mean dismissal from the
Force."</p>

<p>"I don't need to be told my duty by anyone," replied the
Inspector angrily. "I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you do need to be told it," interrupted Larose again. "I
have given you the clearest proofs, supported by the word of Mr.
Naughton Jones, whose reputation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said the flurried Inspector wiping the
perspiration from his forehead, "but you see, you are putting me
in a dreadful position, Mr. Larose, and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The detective saw that he was wavering. "Make out the warrant,
sir," he said quietly. "The responsibility is all mine."</p>

<p>The Inspector gave in, and five minutes later, seated next to
Larose, was being driven up to Thralldom Castle. In the car
behind were Naughton Jones, the warder from Broadmoor and two
uniformed policemen.</p>

<p>During the short drive Larose gave yet more details to the
Inspector and by the time they were approaching the castle, that
official was much easier in his mind, and indeed was almost
pleasantly excited.</p>

<p>"And the coincidence is, Mr. Larose," he remarked, "that I was
actually intending to come up to the castle this afternoon, for
the description of a man wanted by the French police corresponds
pretty closely to that of the chef they've got here. He's wanted
for several burglaries across the channel."</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought Larose, "then poor old Croupin'll have to flap
his wings at once."</p>

<p>According to arrangement, the warder was kept out of sight
until they had seen which footman answered their ring. It turned
out to be James and directly he had unlocked the grille, Larose
seized him by one arm and the Inspector by the other.</p>

<p>"Where's William?" asked Larose sharply.</p>

<p>"With his lordship in the gallery," gasped the footman, very
frightened when he saw the other four men come trooping in. "I'll
go and tell his lordship&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you won't," said Larose. "We'll just announce ourselves.
I'll go first," he went on to the Inspector, "and the others had
better follow pretty close. We'll take them by surprise and not
give them that moment's chance, for the footman will possibly be
armed. It's unfortunate they are in the gallery though, for the
gallery's very long and if they're at the other end, they may
wake up to what's happening before we're on them."</p>

<p>They crept softly up the stairs and round the corner to the
opening of the gallery. The gate of the mutilated grille was
standing wide open and they had a clear view of everything
inside.</p>

<p>A big arm-chair had been drawn up close before 'The Man of
Sorrows,' and Lord Thralldom was lying back in a profound
reverie, with his eyes half closed in ecstatic contemplation of
the canvas. His massive head was sunk upon his chest, his arms
were folded and he breathed in the quiet and tranquil manner of
one asleep.</p>

<p>The footman at the far end of the gallery was busy with a
feather duster, with his back towards the grille.</p>

<p>Larose tiptoed softly forward, with the Inspector and the
others close upon his heels.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, one of the policemen slipped upon the parquet
flooring and crashed heavily against the wall.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom looked up sharply to see what had occasioned
the noise, and perceiving Larose with the little crowd behind
him, after one startled moment of surprise sprang like lightning
to his feet and snatching a pistol from his pocket, pointed it
straight before him.</p>

<p>"Stop, stop," he shouted fiercely. "Stop, all of you, or I
fire." His voice rose to a shriek. "Stop, you, Larose, and keep
your hands away from your body. Quick, sharp! or I fire."</p>

<p>Larose gritted his teeth in fury, for he realised in a flash
that there was no help for it but to stop. Forty feet and more
separated him from Lord Thralldom and there was that deadly
little blue barrel just level with his eyes.</p>

<p>"Not a movement, any of you," roared Lord Thralldom. "I've
seven bullets here, and I'll not miss with one. I was the best
shot in the British Army once. William," he called out without
turning his head, "you've got your pistol, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," replied the footman tremulously, "I've got
it."</p>

<p>"Then empty it among them if any of them move," shouted his
master. "Don't wait an instant."</p>

<p>A short silence followed, with the little huddled crowd by the
grille mortified beyond all expression. They were as if caught in
a trap and it looked instant death if any of them moved. They
were not too certain either, that death was not inevitable for
some of them whatever they did.</p>

<p>Lord Thralldom laughed mockingly. "Ah! but I was prepared for
you," he scoffed. "I expected something like this." The light of
madness gleamed in his eyes. "You are all conspirators and you
have come to rob me of my Rubens. You&mdash;you, Larose"&mdash;he
could hardly get his breath&mdash;"you are the ring-leader of
them all, and a bullet will be too merciful for you." He spat out
his words. "You have been spying on my lands here, you have been
spying in this castle, and you have been rifling the graves of my
dead!" His voice rose to a shriek again. "Why! you even dared to
point out to me this morning the very stones that you have lifted
up! You boasted&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Larose had been thinking rapidly. He was sure that if this
madman before them were allowed to have all the fury on his own,
then things would speedily work up to a climax and they would end
by his discharging his pistol indiscriminately among them.</p>

<p>So the only chance, and it was a frail one, was to so protract
the duration of his fury, that his emotions would exhaust him and
thereby render him less capable of using his weapon effectively.
Already, the detective saw that the pistol hand was wavering.</p>

<p>He risked everything and interrupted loudly and with great
violence.</p>

<p>"You lie, my lord," he shouted. "I have rifled no graves and
it is not I who have been violating your dead. It is that shaking
wretch behind you who has done it. He knows the secret of the
chapel door, and night after night he has been descending into
the vaults, and desecrating the resting places of those from
whose loins your great house has sprung. He has defiled this
castle and brought shame upon you, who are the custodian of your
dead."</p>

<p>The detective stopped for want of breath and Lord Thralldom,
stunned into silence by his outburst, gaped at him as if he were
a ghost.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Larose in sharp ringing tones, "and he is a
convict, that man. He has escaped from Broadmoor and we have come
to arrest him. He is Carl Heidelburg and the head warder of the
asylum is here to identify him. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But a snarl of fury came from the far end of the gallery, a
cry as if some wild beast cornered by its enemies, and the
footman was seen to spring forward and, with one hand shading his
eyes against the sunlight that was streaming through the windows,
with the other to menace the little group of police officers with
his pistol.</p>

<p>He seemed to be trying to pick out someone among them.</p>

<p>He danced and chattered in his rage and his pistol was a
danger to everyone before him.</p>

<p>"It's me he's looking for," whispered the head warder through
dry lips, "and I'll be cold meat in two seconds, if he's any good
with his gun."</p>

<p>Then suddenly two shots rang out in quick succession. One
crashed splinteringly through the glass protecting the Rubens,
but for the moment it was not known where the other had gone.</p>

<p>Then, with a strangled cry Lord Thralldom fell forward on to
the floor. Blood gushed from his mouth, he coughed horribly, and
then gasping, "My Rubens, my Rubens!" turned over and closed his
eyes.</p>

<p>Roger, 27th Lord of Thralldom was dead.</p>

<p>A fierce rush followed, for regardless of all consequences, a
wave of men surged over towards the convict Heidelburg.</p>

<p>The man stood staring at the fallen body of his master and
then looking up and seeing that his enemies were almost upon him,
he smiled a dreadful smile and putting the muzzle of his pistol
between his teeth, blew his brains out.</p>

<p>Then, when everyone was standing speechless and appalled at
the double tragedy that had occurred, the great bell in the
belfry began to toll.</p>

<p>"Dong&mdash;dong&mdash;dong&mdash;dong," as it had tolled all
down the ages when a lord of Thralldom had passed away.</p>

<p>Naughton Jones was the first to recover himself. He thought it
time he should assert his individuality among the official
police, and he bent down in a grave professional manner over the
body of Lord Thralldom.</p>

<p>"The bullet severed the carotid artery," he announced, "and
there was no hope in the world for him then. I
remember&mdash;&mdash;" but to his great annoyance, he found no
one was listening.</p>

<p>"Gee!" exclaimed the Inspector, "but that was a close shave,
and it was Mr. Larose who saved us." He looked round to speak to
the detective, but the latter was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Then excited voices were heard upon the stairs and Lady
Deering, followed by some of the maids, came running into the
gallery.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" she asked in a terrified tone, and then
seeing the Inspector and the policeman there, she went on
thankfully, "Oh! we thought it was another raid and I sent James
up into the belfry to ring the big bell."</p>

<p>But she caught sight of the body of Lord Thralldom upon the
floor, and her voice rose instantly to a wail. "Oh! tell me
what's happened! Quick!"</p>

<p>The Inspector broke the dreadful news as gently as he could,
and she burst instantly into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>"But where's my daughter?" she sobbed. "Someone fetch her at
once."</p>

<p>"Keep her out of it, my lady," said the Inspector sternly.
"This is no place for a young girl."</p>

<p>"But she's the heiress of Thralldom," she cried. "Her uncle's
left everything to her, and it's only right that she should be
here."</p>

<p>In the meantime, Larose had made his way swiftly, at first, to
his car, and then back towards the servants' hall. He came upon
Croupin craning his head round the corridor.</p>

<p>"William's shot Lord Thralldom," panted Larose, "and he's
dead."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" gasped Croupin, "but has William
escaped?"</p>

<p>"No, he's shot himself and he's dead too; but quick, you must
get away. They're after you, and Naughton Jones is here."</p>

<p>Croupin made a grimace of dismay and darting into the kitchen,
reappeared, struggling to get James's overcoat over his chef's
clothes.</p>

<p>"Go to my car, quick," exclaimed Larose. "It's the red one
just outside the door. Hide under the rug upon the floor at the
back. No one will go and sit there, because I've spilt oil all
over the cushions. Now, quick, at once, for you've not a second
to spare. Lie quiet, whatever happens, and I'll get you out of
this somehow."</p>

<p>"<i>Bien</i>, I'm quite sure you will," grinned the Frenchman
turning to run off. "With you and me, together, we cannot
fail."</p> <hr> <p>"You did splendidly, Mr. Larose," said the
Chief Commissioner of Police when, a few days later, he and the
detective were talking things over at Scotland Yard, "and
although the arrest of Lord Thralldom would have been a great
feather in your cap, still it was best for everyone that the
matter should have ended as it did. After all, as a nation we are
proud of our aristocracy, and it would have been a terrible
scandal if Lord Thralldom had been charged."</p>

<p>"And it was best, too, for Miss Devenham, or rather Mrs.
Harden I should say," said Larose, "for it would have been a
dreadful shadow on her life if she had learnt everything. Now,
she need never know what her uncle was and what a narrow escape
she herself had."</p>

<p>The Commissioner nodded. "But fancy the old wretch altering
his will the very day he was intending to kill her and making her
his sole heiress so that if her body had ever come to be found
afterwards, it would have looked incredible that he could have
had a hand in her death! Ah! but he was cunning!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he was much more cunning than I could have thought,"
commented Larose, "but it was only by chance that he found out I
had broken open that box. If he had not gone to the cupboard for
that ledger, he would never have suspected anything. Then, of
course, he remembered having smelt the paper that I had
smouldered and after that&mdash;well, James gave everything away
to him." He nodded. "Still, those four metal buttons in the ashes
were conclusive that he had destroyed the overall in the fire and
that towel in the bathroom showed where he had cleaned up the
axe."</p>

<p>The Commissioner nodded in his turn. "But we were bound to act
upon that hint we received from high up," he said, "and you
gained a lot in the estimation of everyone who knows the real
facts, by the tactful way in which you gave your evidence at the
inquest. You avoided most skilfully a lot of awkward points and I
don't wonder the coroner summed up dead against Heidelburg,
giving the jury practically no option but to return a verdict of
wilful murder against him." He frowned. "But it didn't matter. We
knew him to have been responsible for two deaths and he was a
most repellent character."</p>

<p>"Well, it was a good thing, in any case, that he shot
himself," commented Larose. "It saved a lot of trouble."</p>

<p>"Yes, and there's another thing," laughed the Commissioner.
"The Suffolk police were perfectly dumbfounded at what you had
found out, and they have been feeling very cheap ever since. I
saw their Chief Constable yesterday and he said, 'Confound that
Gilbert Larose of yours and please keep him out of my county in
future. I should probably have been in the next honour's list but
for him, and now I shall have to remain plain Colonel Wedgewood
for the rest of my life!'"</p>

<p>"He'll never be plain," laughed back Larose, "for he's a very
handsome man."</p>

<p>They chatted for a few moments and then Larose got up to take
his leave.</p>

<p>"Oh! by-the-bye, one thing more," exclaimed the Commissioner,
pretending to look very stern. "About that French chef who was so
very useful to you up at the castle and is supposed to be the man
the Paris people are wanting so badly. It has come to me in a
very roundabout way that Naughton Jones is of the opinion you
helped the fellow to escape. He says that when your car was
requisitioned to give a lift to those two policemen, back to
Saxmundham, you made them squeeze into the front seat along with
you, because some oil had been spilt on the back cushions."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?" asked Larose innocently. "They wouldn't
want to soil their uniforms would they?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," agreed the Commissioner smiling, "but Jones
remembered afterwards there was a thick rug flung loosely over
the floor at the back of the car and later after having shaken
hands with you in saying good-bye, when he came to light his
pipe, he smelt oil upon his fingers."</p>

<p>Larose grinned. "A very remarkable man, sir, that Jones," he
replied, "but he's got too much imagination by far, when he's
talking about his friends," and bowing most respectfully, he
proceeded to leave the room.</p> <hr> <p>The following year, upon
one gorgeous day in early June, Larose met John Harden in Regent
Street, just as the latter had alighted from a very beautiful
looking car. They shook hands warmly.</p>

<p>"You must come down and see us, Mr. Larose," said Harden after
they had exchanged a few remarks. "We've got a lovely place just
outside Haslemere and I'm going in extensively for Jersey cows.
They are the only things my wife brought from Thralldom. You
heard, of course, that she sold the castle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, an American bought it, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a Judge Morrison, and he's a very good fellow." He
laughed. "He's immensely proud of those dungeons and especially
of that dreadful one with the well."</p>

<p>"But where's Mrs. Harden?" asked Larose. "Isn't she up with
you to-day?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Harden quickly. "I came up alone for a couple of
hours to do some shopping for her." He pretended to look very
annoyed. "You know, Mr. Larose, my wife thinks the world of you,
and if I hadn't happened to meet her first, I'd have never had a
look in." He shook his head. "She's always trying to make me
jealous by reminding me of that night when she took care of you
in her bedroom."</p>

<p>"She's a charming girl, Mr. Harden," said Larose solemnly,
"and you had the luck of the world when you married her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," nodded Harden, "and I shall always be grateful
to you for the way you ordered us about that dreadful day." He
smiled. "But now look here, do you happen to know that Monsieur
Antoine's address?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't for the moment," replied Larose, "but he's back
in France, I think. What do you want to know for?"</p>

<p>"Because we had a beautiful wedding present from him last
week," replied Harden. "Three pairs of most lovely, old silver
candlesticks. We've never seen anything like them before, and
they must have cost him a lot of money. He's had my wife's
initials 'A.H.' engraved on them, too, and we're wondering where
he can have picked the candlesticks up."</p>

<p>Larose made no comment, but he was now wondering too. He had
very recently been in Paris and he remembered hearing then of a
burglary that had just taken place at Count Hauteville's
magnificent chateau in Chantilly and the count's christian name
was Armande. Ann Harden and Armande Hauteville! both the same
initials 'A.H.!'</p>

<p>It was a singular coincidence, certainly.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll be coming to see us one day, won't you?" said
Harden after having shaken hands, and turning to go back to his
car.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I will," replied Larose. "How about next Sunday?
Will that suit you?"</p>

<p>The young husband looked very embarrassed. "Well, no," he
replied hesitatingly. "Wait a bit, if you don't mind. Come, say
in a month's time." He laughed slily. "We may have a little
surprise for you then."</p>

<p>"But it will be no surprise at all," murmured Larose as the
car moved away.</p>

<p><br>
THE new owner of Thralldom Castle had been showing a party of guests over the dungeons and was now providing them with cocktails in the lounge.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said proudly, "everything in the dungeons is exactly
as it was upon the day when Lord Thralldom died. Except for the
electric light that I had installed there, those seats in the
corridor and that half of the well chamber that is railed off for
my mushroom beds, nothing is different." He smiled round
impressively upon the company. "You have seen it, ladies and
gentlemen as it has been for over 800 years."</p>

<p>"It was thrilling, Judge," said a pretty girl
enthusiastically, "and I have never enjoyed anything so much in
all my life." She made a little grimace of disappointment. "But I
think you ought to have left a few of those rats. Then we should
have known something of the horror that detective, Larose, must
have felt, when they were running all over his legs."</p>

<p>"Oh! I really couldn't have done that," replied Judge
Morrison. "They had to be got rid of. There were millions of them
down there." He turned and addressed the resplendently attired
footman who was serving the cocktails "James, how many brace did
those ratcatchers kill?"</p>

<p>"Twelve hundred and four, my lord&mdash;sir, I beg your
pardon," replied the footman deferentially. "That was the count
when they left."</p>

<p>The judge turned back to his guests and joined merrily in the
general laugh. "Well, I knew it was a good number," he said, "and
some were as big as young cats."</p>

<p>"But that Lord Thralldom must have been half mad himself,"
commented a tall, distinguished looking man, "to have allowed the
rats to breed to that extent, for so long."</p>

<p>The judge flashed a covert look at the last speaker, and
putting his finger to his lips, waited until the footman had
moved out of hearing.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he said solemnly. "There are many tales about that
lord." He drew the little company together with his eyes and
lowered his voice to a mysterious whisper. "He was mad and there
are rumours, too, that he and that convict footman had been
carrying out that dreadful work together. They say the murders
were done between them and the lord knew all along what was going
on." He nodded darkly. "But of course, it was all hushed up."</p>

<p>"Oh, Judge, Judge," shuddered the pretty girl, "and you sleep
in that same bed of his, that you showed us just now!"</p>

<p>"And why not?" laughed the Judge. "It is mine and I've paid
for it. I bought everything in the castle, lock, stock and
barrel, just as it stands. I took over all the staff, too, and
to-night you will be waited upon by the same servants that waited
upon the mad lord. Yes, I kept everybody and&mdash;&mdash;" He
corrected himself quickly. "Ah! no, I did not keep everybody, for
there was one person who wouldn't come back and that
person"&mdash;he sighed and looked very sad&mdash;"I would have
perhaps liked to have kept, best of all."</p>

<p>"Oh! who was it?" asked a stout lady, very red in the face
after her third cocktail.</p>

<p>The judge put his finger to his lips again. "Hush! don't tell
my wife." He just breathed his next words. "It was the great
lord's niece, Ann." He clasped his hands together in ecstasy.
"She is a real peach!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've seen her and so she is," commented the
distinguished looking man when the laughter had subsided. He
shook his finger reprovingly at his host. "You are a bad man,
sir&mdash;but a darned good judge."</p> <hr> <p>James and Bertha,
the pretty sewing-maid were walking in the moonlight among the
plum-trees in the castle garden. He had his arm round her waist
and every now and then he stooped and took a loud kiss.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said meditatively, "it doesn't seem as if anyone
could believe it, but I've had nearly &pound;50 this month
already, in tips, and if it goes on like this, in six months
we'll be taking over that Westleton pub."</p>

<p>The girl nestled up closer to him. "And they grow such lovely
nasturtiums in the garden there at the back," she sighed. "I've
always longed to have flowers like that."</p>

<p>"They'll be yours, my dear," said the footman, squeezing her
hand, "for we're going to have plenty more visitors here yet. I
heard the old woman telling the judge last night that every room
in the castle was booked up for nearly four months and they
mustn't invite any more. But about those tips," he went on,
"these swell people who are here now, are real suckers about
having chippings off that darned well, and I've only got to
mention about them taking a souvenir from where those bodies were
found and they go balmy at once. I could have chipped the whole
well to bits, twice over." He chuckled. "But of course they don't
want the old judge to know." He squeezed her again. "You do love
me, don't you, Bertha?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, dear. I always have done."</p>

<p>"And you don't ever think about that old Froggy that used to
be here?"</p>

<p>The shadows hid the tenderness in the girl's eyes. "No no, I
never do," she replied quickly. She caught her breath. "But oh!
dear, I had a strange dream once and I can tell you, now we are
engaged. I dreamt before he left, that Monsieur Antoine came into
my room in the middle of the night and stood watching me in the
moonlight. I was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! in your room in the middle of the night!" ejaculated
the footman. He clenched his fists. "It's a good thing I didn't
know."</p>

<p>"But it was only a dream," said the girl quickly "for the door
was locked. I dreamed he was there and that he crept over to my
work basket. So, I pretended to snore and he went away.</p>

<p>"Dream or no dream," said James, "I'd have broken his neck, if
I'd known. Going over to your work basket, indeed! Ah! that
reminds me, I must borrow one of your baskets to-morrow." He
grinned. "I've run out of my chips again and must go down to the
quarry and get some more. They're hot stuff on the souvenirs,
this lot here, especially the women." He tilted up her chin.
"Now, give give us another kiss."</p>
